<text>Fort Concho is a former United States Army installation and National Historic Landmark District located in San Angelo, Texas. It was established in November 1867 at the confluence of the North and South Concho Rivers, on the routes of the Butterfield Overland Mail Route and Goodnight–Loving Trail, and was an active military base for the next 22 years. Fort Concho was the principal base of the 4th Cavalry from 1867 to 1875 and then the &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot; of the 10th Cavalry from 1875 to 1882. The troops stationed at Fort Concho participated in Ranald S. Mackenzie&#x27;s 1872 campaign, the Red River War in 1874, and the Victorio Campaign of 1879–1880.

The fort was abandoned in June 1889, and over the next 20 years was divided into residences and businesses, with the buildings repurposed or recycled for their materials. Efforts to preserve and restore Fort Concho began in the 1900s and resulted in the foundation of the Fort Concho Museum in 1929. The property has been owned and operated by the city of San Angelo since 1935. Fort Concho was named a National Historic Landmark on July 4, 1961, and is one of the best-preserved examples of the military installations built by the US Army in Texas.

The Fort Concho Historic District covers the fort&#x27;s original grounds and 23 buildings, some of which are the oldest in San Angelo. , about 55,000 people visit the fort annually.

==Operation by the US military==
Fort Concho was established during the American colonization of Texas in the 19th century, a process that began in the 1820s with the immigration of Anglo-Americans into Spanish, later Mexican, Texas. Europeans first reached the Concho River valley in the 16th century. The Spanish established contact and then trade with the Jumano people, who inhabited the valley until they were driven out of it by the Apache peoples in the 1690s. The Apache were themselves expelled by the mid-18th century by the Comanche. However, in 1849, American colonists began crossing West Texas in large numbers to reach California, where gold had been discovered. To protect its citizens, the United States Army ordered the construction of a string of forts along the frontier&#x27;s routes of travel from 1850 to 1852. Among those forts was Fort Chadbourne, established on October 28, 1852, and among those avenues was the Butterfield Overland Mail route, established in 1858 with Fort Chadbourne as one of its stations.

The beginning of the American Civil War in 1861 ended both enterprises. The Butterfield route moved out of Texas, and the federal government ceded its Texas forts to the Confederate States of America. Confederate Texas was unable to secure its territories, so as a consequence, white settlers retreated eastward throughout the war. After the end of the war in 1865, though, immigrants from the war-torn Southern States decamped for Texas. Many of these immigrants became cattle herders and followed routes such as the Goodnight–Loving Trail, established in 1866 on the Butterfield route – which brought large volumes of cattle through the Concho Valley.

Major General Philip Sheridan, appointed to command the postwar military district covering Texas and Louisiana on March 19, 1867, at first ignored reports of raiding by indigenous peoples, but later that year, the US Army was ordered to reoccupy its pre-war billets in Texas, and that May, Fort Chadbourne was reoccupied by the 4th Cavalry. Fort Chadbourne was, however, poorly supplied with water. The US Army decided to replace Fort Chadbourne with a new installation. They identified the junction of the Concho Rivers as an ideal site because of its proximity to the routes it was to guard and nearby grazing land, and the abundance of water.

In mid-1867, Major John Porter Hatch, commanding the 4th Cavalry, dispatched Lieutenant Peter M. Boehm to establish a camp on the Middle Concho, to the south of Fort Chadbourne. Captain Michael J. Kelly and 50 troopers established this camp, albeit on the North Concho, and remained there over the summer of 1867. On November 28, 1867, the 4th Cavalry&#x27;s H Company departed from Fort Chadbourne for the Conchos. H Company&#x27;s commander, Captain George G. Huntt, named the site of the new fort &quot;Camp Hatch&quot;, but changed it at Hatch&#x27;s request to &quot;Camp Kelly&quot; in January 1868 to honor Kelly, who had died on August 13, 1867, of typhoid fever. Construction of a permanent outpost began on a site north of the camp, which was named Fort Concho in March 1868 by Edward M. Stanton, United States Secretary of War.

===Construction===
Captain David W. Porter, assistant quartermaster of the Department of Texas, was tasked with constructing Fort Concho on December 10, 1867. Progress was slow, as all building materials had to be shipped in and there was frequent bickering among the fort&#x27;s officers, Huntt and Porter included. Porter employed civilian masons and carpenters, but also oversaw the construction of Forts Griffin and Richardson. As such, he was often not present at the fort to direct building work. In March 1868, Porter was replaced at Fort Concho by Major George C. Cram, who built a temporary guardhouse. Cram was also frequently absent from the fort, and in the year of his arrival had the regional mail line superintendent, Major Ben Ficklin, arrested. The United States Postmaster General intervened and by August, Cram was reassigned and construction was handed to Captain Joseph Rendlebrock, the 4th Cavalry&#x27;s quartermaster. By the end of the year, Rendlebrock had completed the commissary, quartermaster&#x27;s storehouse, and a wing of the hospital.

The first permanent military structures on the fort grounds, five of the officer&#x27;s residences and the first regimental barracks, were completed by August 1869. They were followed over the next year by two more officer&#x27;s residences, another barracks, and a permanent guardhouse and stables. Hatch pushed for the completion of the fort through 1870–71, directing the building of a quartermaster&#x27;s corral and a wagon shed. In February 1872, however, budget cuts by the US War Department resulted in the dismissal of the civilian workers and another lull in construction. By the end of the year, Fort Concho consisted of four barracks, eight officers&#x27; residences, the hospital, a magazine, bakery, several storehouses, workshops, and stables.

In 1875, the parade ground was cleared and a flagstaff placed in its center. In the process, the adjutant&#x27;s office was moved to the headquarters building. It was replaced in short order with a stone command structure, the headquarters building, built in 1876. Another officers&#x27; residence was built in 1877, as were the foundations for another that went unfinished for lack of funding. This building was completed in February 1879 as the schoolhouse and chapel. It was the final permanent structure completed at Fort Concho. By 1879, the fort was an eight-company installation. Construction had, by 1877, cost the US Army $1 million ($, adjusted for inflation) on land it had leased. Thirty-nine permanent buildings were on the fort grounds by April 1889.

===Base of the 4th Cavalry===
In the first seven months of Fort Concho&#x27;s existence, its garrison – numbering 129, out of a force of 3,672 in Texas, according to the 1869 reports of the War Department – were occupied by its plodding construction. This was the cause of much criticism by local Texas newspapers; the frontier continued to retreat in the remaining years of the 1860s. Meanwhile, outside of building work, the garrison patrolled, scouted, and escorted cattle herds and wagon trains on the San Antonio–El Paso Road. There was thus little combat in Texas, according to the US Army records. Inaction by the army, whose garrisons were poorly and irregularly supplied, and criticism of that inaction, continued into 1871. Beginning with the creation of the Department of Texas that March, however, US Army activity in Texas changed. Sheridan adopted a strategy of feinting and constant movement early in the year, and then punitive expeditions in the winter, when the tribes&#x27; ponies would be weakest. As part of Sheridan&#x27;s plan, the garrisons of the Texas forts established subposts. Among these were Fort Chadbourne, which was reoccupied, and Camp Charlotte, on the Middle Concho.

On February 25, 1871, Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie took command of the 4th Cavalry. He moved the regimental headquarters to Fort Richardson a month later, but kept a few companies at Fort Concho. These companies participated in an inconclusive campaign against the Kiowa from May to September 1871, returning to Fort Concho in November. Comanche and Kiowa raids became more frequent over the rest of 1871, prompting a number of expeditions that rarely saw Native Americans. A notable exception was a patrol carried out by Sergeant William Wilson from March 26 to 29, 1872, that led to the US Army&#x27;s discovery of water in the Staked Plains and a large Comanche settlement at Mushaway Peak. Hatch, in charge of Fort Concho for Mackenzie, reported Wilson&#x27;s findings, which were confirmed by another patrol by Captain Napoleon B. McLaughlen.

After Mackenzie and Hatch met with Brigadier General Christopher C. Augur, in command of the Department of Texas, Mackenzie and McLaughlen, commanding Companies D and I, departed from their respective installations on June 17. Over the following months, the 4th Cavalry explored the South Plains and fought the Comanche at the Battle of the North Fork on September 29. As a result of that battle, the 4th Cavalry captured 124 women and children, 116 of whom were taken back to Fort Concho on October 21. The captives were interned in the quartermaster&#x27;s corral and remained there until the Department of Texas ordered their release on April 14, 1873. They departed Fort Concho on May 24 under escort from the 11th Infantry and arrived at Fort Sill on June 10.

On June 27, 1874, more than 200 indigenous warriors attacked a group of buffalo hunters camped at Adobe Walls, beginning the Red River War. In response, Augur ordered Mackenzie and the 4th Cavalry back to Fort Concho in July. By August, Sheridan, now commanding the Military Division of the Missouri, ordered five expeditionary forces of more than 3,000 soldiers each into the South Plains. The southern force, under Mackenzie, left Fort Concho on August 23, 1874, with eight companies of the 4th Cavalry, four of the 10th Infantry, and one from the 11th Infantry. Over the following year, Mackenzie chased the Comanche to their base of operations in the Palo Duro Canyon and destroyed it on September 28. His force continued to patrol the area over the winter, preventing the Comanche from rebuilding their supplies and forcing their return to their reservation.

===Base of the 10th Cavalry===
By 1875, Fort Concho had become one of the main US Army bases in Texas, but early in the year, the 4th Cavalry was transferred to Fort Sill to keep the South Plains nations on their reservation. They were replaced at Fort Concho by the 10th Cavalry, an all-black regiment commanded by Colonel Benjamin Grierson. He arrived at Fort Concho on April 17, 1875, and established the regimental headquarters there. Stationed at Forts Concho, Stockton, Davis, Quitman, and Clark, and their subposts, the 10th Cavalry was tasked with patrolling the frontier, escorting wagons and settlers, and mounting expeditions. Beginning in 1877, starving Plains tribes began killing buffalo hunters and raiding white settlements. In response, Grierson sent Captain Nicholas M. Nolan and a company of the 10th to subdue the raiders. Nolan set out in July, and achieved nothing but the death of four soldiers from the 10th Cavalry&#x27;s Company A.

In late 1879, Grierson received word that a war party of Ojo Caliente and Mescalero Apache under Chief Victorio entered the Trans-Pecos. He left Fort Concho on March 23, 1880, at the head of five companies of the 10th Cavalry and some of the 25th Infantry to disarm the Mescaleros of the Fort Stanton reservation. Grierson&#x27;s soldiers fought with Apache raiders over early April, then reached Fort Stanton on April 12. The disarmament was delayed until April 16 because of rains and resulted in failure when the Mescalero Apache escaped with most of their arms. Grierson returned to Fort Concho on May 16, but left the 10th Cavalry&#x27;s M Company at the head of the North Concho in case the Apache appeared in the area.

On June 17, 1880, Nolan and a battalion of the 10th Cavalry at Fort Sill returned to Fort Concho by Grierson&#x27;s order. Ten days later, Grierson sent Nolan to patrol the Guadalupe Mountains and himself set out from Fort Concho on July 10. Grierson harried Victorio over the summer until he was defeated at Rattlesnake Springs and driven into Mexico, where Victorio&#x27;s band was destroyed on October 15, 1880, by the Mexican Army. The 10th Cavalry transferred permanently to Fort Davis, farther to the west, in July 1882.

===Post-Texas Indian Wars and deactivation===
On January 27, 1881, the Texas Rangers fought and defeated what was left of Victorio&#x27;s band in the final battle of the American Indian Wars fought in Texas. The 10th Cavalry was replaced at Fort Concho in 1882 by the 16th Infantry, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Alfred L. Hough. Ten days before Hough and the regimental headquarters arrived at the fort that August, the Concho River flooded, destroying the town of Ben Ficklin and badly damaging San Angelo. As a result, the 16th Infantry spent its first week on-site rendering humanitarian aid. After recovering, San Angelo began to prosper, while Fort Concho declined from poor maintenance. From 1882 until the fort&#x27;s final closure, it served primarily as a base for troops awaiting transfer elsewhere in Texas. When Fort McKavett was abandoned by the US Army in June 1883, its garrison moved to Fort Concho.

By the mid-1880s, ranches enclosed the surrounding plains with barbed-wire fencing; the soldiers, barred by law from cutting the wire, were reduced to patrolling roads. Many of the frontier forts, such as Forts Davis and Griffin, had either been abandoned or were awaiting deactivation. After the 16th Infantry left Fort Concho for Fort Bliss in February 1887, locals believed Fort Concho would also be abandoned. In early 1888, the 8th Cavalry gathered at Fort Concho from around Texas and then left in June for Fort Meade, South Dakota. With their departure, only the 19th Infantry&#x27;s K Company was garrisoned at Fort Concho. On June 20, 1889, the men of K Company lowered the flag over the fort for the final time and left the next morning.

==Relationship with San Angelo, Texas==

In 1870, entrepreneur Bartholomew J. DeWitt purchased a half-section of land () across the Concho from Fort Concho. He divided the area into plots to build a town, later to be known as San Angelo. The township was not a profitable venture and its lots were sold at low prices. By 1875, San Angelo was a collection of saloons and brothels. Relations between the town and Fort Concho&#x27;s garrison were strained and often outright hostile. Violence between Fort Concho&#x27;s black servicemen and townspeople was common, and continued until the 10th Cavalry was replaced by the 16th Infantry in 1882. Humanitarian aid rendered to locals by the garrison, especially following the flood of 1882, eventually evaporated the lingering animosity.

Fort Concho was crucial to San Angelo&#x27;s early growth. The presence of its garrison attracted traders and settlers and allowed diversification in the town&#x27;s economy. The fort&#x27;s chaplains were some of the first preachers and educators in the town and its medical staff, chiefly surgeon William Notson, also treated civilians. One of Notson&#x27;s civilian assistants, Samuel L. S. Smith, became San Angelo&#x27;s first physician, and in 1910 helped establish its first civilian hospital. The government-contracted merchants who serviced the fort would all settle in San Angelo and be counted among its architects.

===Preservation===
Following the closure of the fort in 1889, it was divided into commercial and residential lots and its buildings were accordingly renovated or demolished. Enlisted Barracks 3 and 4 were replaced with a series of residences, while the officers&#x27; residences were preserved as private homes. Additional buildings were built in and around the fort, including a school constructed on the parade ground in 1907. As early as 1905, however, influential locals tried to conserve the fort. J. L. Millspaugh, one of the merchants contracted to supply Fort Concho, suggested without success that the city buy it. That same year, realtor C. A. Broome formed the Fort Concho Realty Company in 1905 to sell his properties on the fort&#x27;s grounds to the city. The eastern third of the fort grounds, which had remained preserved, was given to the city by the Santa Fe Railroad Company in 1913. Eleven years later, the Daughters of the American Revolution raised funds to preserve the fort and secured a designation for it as a Texas state historic site, with accompanying plaque.

In 1927, a local named Ginevra Wood Carson acquired a room in the Tom Green County Courthouse for an exhibit on local history, and there established what would become the Fort Concho Museum. After the museum began expanding into other rooms of the courthouse, Carson moved it into Fort Concho&#x27;s headquarters building on August 8, 1930. Carson struggled to raise a sum of $6,000 ($, adjusted for inflation) to purchase the building from its owner, who in 1935 relented and accepted the $3,000 ($, adjusted for inflation) she had been able to raise. That same year, the city of San Angelo assumed partial administrative responsibility for the museum, to be managed by a board of directors headed by Carson until she retired in 1953. Funding for the museum was slashed during the Great Depression and World War II, though four buildings were acquired in 1939. Further acquisitions occurred in the later 1940s, until the 1950s Texas drought again strained municipal resources. The museum was made a department of the city of San Angelo in 1955, but only one property purchased in that decade; the Fort Concho Museum by this time controlled only about a quarter of the fort grounds. In the 1960s, the city of San Angelo sought to cede the Fort Concho Museum to the federal and state governments, but both were prioritizing other Texas forts.

On July 4, 1961, Fort Concho was named a National Historic Landmark District, and on October 15, 1966, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, by the National Park Service (NPS). A plan was prepared by the NPS in 1961, and again in 1967. In 1980, the Fort Concho Museum collaborated with Bell, Klein and Hoffman, an Austin-based architecture firm specializing in restorations, to prepare another, three-phase plan to acquire the rest of the fort&#x27;s grounds and demolish its 19th and 20th century modifications. The museum began implementing that plan in 1981, spending over $900,000 ($). Those funds were raised by matched grants from the NPS via the Historic Preservation Fund. The parade ground was then brought fully under the museum&#x27;s control with the move of the school to a new campus. An NPS survey in June 1985 found that the fort was in generally good condition, though a number of later buildings were still on its grounds. On January 1, 1986, it was named a Texas State Antiquities Landmark by the Texas Historical Commission. By 1989, the district consisted of 16 original buildings, six reconstructed buildings, and a stabilized ruin.

In 2015, an anonymous donor gave $2,000,000 ($, adjusted for inflation) to the Fort Concho Museum. Two years later, the museum announced that it would use the donated money and other proceeds to expand its visitors center and rebuild Barracks 3 and 4 over 2018. No commissions were made until December 2020, however, when the City of San Angelo announced imminent repairs to 14 buildings, and that the reconstructed Barracks 3 and the mess hall of Barracks 4 would house a research library on loan to the museum. A permit was issued for the reconstruction of Barracks 3 and 4 in September 2021.

===Involvement in the YFZ ranch raid===
On April 3, 2008, following a call from an alleged victim of abuse by members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, a polygamist Mormon sect, Texas authorities raided the YFZ Ranch, from San Angelo. The authorities began removing children from the ranch the next day, and relocated them to Fort Concho on April 5. The State of Texas was granted conservatorship over the children on April 7, and seven days later moved all women accompanying children older than five years to the Foster Communications Coliseum, also in San Angelo. On June 2, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the seizure of the children was unlawful, and the children were released from state custody.

==Grounds and architecture==
 the Fort Concho Historic District consists of 25 buildings standing on a site, with a museum collection of 40,000 items. The district&#x27;s boundaries are formed by East Avenue A and the railroad track to the north, South Oakes Street to the west, a fence behind Officer&#x27;s Row to the south, and a service road behind the administrative buildings to the east. The fort is visited annually by 55,000 people.

Fort Concho, like the forts built and operated by the US Army in Texas, is not fortified. It was designed as a cantonment, where troops could recuperate after being on campaign. Its buildings are arranged around a parade ground, measuring long by wide, that was the hub of its activity. The design of those buildings is a blend of the Neoclassical and Territorial styles, with the only ornament in the buildings being the stone lintels over each window. Each building was constructed from limestone upon a low-lying stone foundation, usually with an attached wooden veranda, with gabled roofs shingled in wood. A low, stone wall surrounded the fort to keep buffalo out of the fort. The material used in the fort&#x27;s construction was sourced externally; the stone and mortar came from Ben Ficklin, to the south of the fort, and the wood was shipped from the Gulf Coast, as the native pecan and mesquite were unsuitable for construction.

===Barracks Row===
Barracks Row is made up by the six enlisted men&#x27;s barracks that line the northern side of the parade ground. The barracks are rectangular, one-story dormitories with an attached kitchen and mess hall to the north of each barracks. They are topped with hipped roofs, crowned with one windcatcher and one single chimney each. A veranda wraps each barracks, but not their attached mess halls. North of the barracks are the stables, built like the rest of the fort, but with a flat roof.

Barracks 1 and 2 were built in 1869 and 1870, respectively, and each contained two cavalry companies. These barracks are unique in having sally ports at their centers for leading horses through, rather than around, the barracks to reach the stables. Barracks 1 had two dining halls to Barracks 2&#x27;s one, but they were demolished sometime after the fort was abandoned. Barracks 1 is the visitor&#x27;s center, while Barracks 2 is a display space housing wagons and replica artillery pieces. Barracks 1 and 2 were acquired by the Fort Concho Museum in 1981.

The other four barracks buildings were built to house infantrymen. Barracks 5 and 6 were built in 1871 and remodeled in the 1920s to house a unit of US National Guard. The buildings had mostly fallen to ruin by 1947, when they were purchased by the Fort Concho Museum. Reconstruction of Barracks 5 and 6 was completed in 1951 as living history spaces. A veranda wraps around the mess halls. Barracks 3 and 4, which were demolished after the fort was abandoned and remain ruins, were identical to Barracks 5 and 6.

===Administrative Row===
The commissary and quartermaster&#x27;s warehouse, built to the same plan in 1868 and 1869, respectively, are the oldest buildings in the city of San Angelo. The commissary was purchased by the city government in 1939, but was used as a garage by the municipal transit department until 1974. It was restored in 1980 and then used as a meeting space. The quartermaster&#x27;s warehouse opened in 1985 as an art museum.

The headquarters building was constructed on Grierson&#x27;s orders in 1876, a decade into the fort&#x27;s military operation. The building is U-shaped, opening to the east, with two chimneys in the main structure and one in the north and south wings. A veranda is attached to the façade and back of the building, between the wings. The headquarters building was used in various capacities in the 20 years after the US Army left Fort Concho. Four of the rooms on the ground floor, the court martial, orderly&#x27;s room, adjutant&#x27;s office, and regimental headquarters, have been remodeled to appear as they would have during the fort&#x27;s military career. About behind the headquarters building is the former residence of Oscar Ruffini, San Angelo&#x27;s first civic architect. The house was moved to its present location on May 14, 1951.

The original hospital was built from 1868 to 1870. After the fort&#x27;s deactivation, the hospital was used as a rooming house and for storage until it was destroyed by fire in 1911. The building was rebuilt in the mid-1980s with the aid of architectural and historical records. The hospital contains a museum about frontier medicine in its north ward, a library in the south ward, and general medical exhibits in the center.

===Officers&#x27; Row===
The Officers&#x27; Row are the ten buildings on the south side of the parade ground, comprised by Officer&#x27;s Quarters 1 through 9 and the schoolhouse and chapel. These houses were built in several phases from 1869 to the mid-1870s. They generally follow an L-shaped plan with a primary residential building and kitchen, connected by a veranda. Interiors consisted of four equally sized rooms and a central hallway on the first floor and two more rooms on a second. The houses have three fireplaces; two in the main building and a third in the kitchen.

Officer&#x27;s Quarters 1 was built from 1870 to 1872 and served as the commanding officer&#x27;s residence. Grierson, who lived there from 1875 to 1882,
added a kitchen and office onto the building, on the south and west ends, respectively, in 1881. Grierson also added a carriage house and placed locks on every door in the building. The Fort Concho Museum purchased the building in 1964. In 1994, it was renovated and became the Concho Valley Pioneer Heritage Center. Officer&#x27;s Quarters 8 and 9 were built to the same plan as Officer&#x27;s Quarters 1 and were also completed in 1872. Another room was added to the south side of Officer&#x27;s Quarters 8 in 1936. Officer&#x27;s Quarters 9 was restored to its original appearance in 1905.

Officer&#x27;s Quarters 2, 4, 5, and 6 were all built in 1870 and all follow the general plan. Their roofs extend over the verandas to cover them. Officer&#x27;s Quarters 2 was purchased by the Fort Concho Museum in 1952. Officer&#x27;s Quarters 5 is a ruin; only its foundations remain. About to the south of Officer&#x27;s Quarters 5 is the site of a carriage house thought to be associated with the house. Officer&#x27;s Quarters 6 was damaged by fire in 1961, but was repaired and turned into a living history exhibit.

Officer&#x27;s Quarters 3 was built in 1870, possibly in March, which would make it the first of the officers&#x27; houses to be completed. The house was the fort commander&#x27;s residence until Officer&#x27;s Quarters 1 and 2 were finished. The building has a total of five rooms, as it lacks a second floor. The two structures making up Officer&#x27;s Quarters 7 were built from 1870 to 1877 to house field officers and their families. The buildings form a duplex and stand to the same height and have two fireplaces each. A porch connects the between the buildings. On July 13, 1990, the E. H. Danner Museum of Telephony, part of the West Texas Collection of Angelo State University, was opened in the building.

The schoolhouse and chapel was completed and dedicated on February 22, 1879, making it the last permanent structure to be completed during its military career. The chapel is built like the officers&#x27; residences and it was first intended to be another duplex. Funding was only sufficient for the foundation of the kitchen to be completed, so the building was finished as the present schoolhouse and chapel. After the US Army left, the building continued to function as a schoolhouse, and at one point, a private home. The Fort Concho Museum purchased the schoolhouse in 1946 and restored it with funds raised by US military personnel on nearby Goodfellow Air Force Base.

<text>was a town located in Nishikubiku District, Niigata Prefecture, Japan.

==Overview==
Ōmi was located on the Japan Sea coast, about four hundred kilometres north-west of Tokyo. The town also had two additional neighborhoods, Oyashirazu and Ichiburi, located six kilometres and thirteen kilometres respectively further down the coast from the main part of Ōmi.

On March 19, 2005, Ōmi, along with the town of Nō (also from Nishikubiki District), was merged into the expanded city of Itoigawa. 

==Demographics==
The town was a classic case of rural decline now often found in modern Japan. Over a period of 30 years, the population had decreased from around 17,000 to 9,797 as of 2003, with a population density of 75.87 persons per km2. The total area was 129.13 km2. After graduating from high school, many young people are forced to move to major population centres for university or in search of work. This was reflected in the population, with the majority of residents aged over 35. Concurrently the number of students attending Ōmi Junior High School fell from 568 to below 300 over a period of 20 years.

Ōmi had many well-funded facilities, including regular local bus and train services (but only a few long-distance services), an indoor heated pool, gymnasium, baseball field, several small local parks, mountain camping sites, plus a new natural history museum, library, and performance hall seating 500 people.

However, there were only a few small local shops, supermarkets and restaurants, and no entertainment facilities. With the declining population many such facilities (such as the movie theatre and baseball stadium) were closed and demolished in recent years.

==Travel information==
Ōmi — The temple and park above Ōmi Kindergarten are quite pretty with a good view of the town. There is also a natural history museum at Kirara Ōmi Hall near the train station. Apart from these the only other real attractions are the nearby mountains and beach where one can go fossicking for jade washed down from Hisui Gorge in the nearby mountains.

Oyashirazu — An old village with many older houses. It is a popular beach during summer with some beer stalls, plus a &quot;Sunset Station&quot; (Pier Park) and shops.

Ichiburi — This is a quaint little fishing village with still many signs of old Japan.

==Festivals==
&quot;Ōmi no take no karakai&quot; is a traditional New Years event that has been carried out since the Edo period (1603–1867). The event is performed in competition between the Eastern area of the town and the Western side. It begins with &quot;Omatsutori&quot; on January 7, where the two sides try to compete over &quot;kazaritake&quot; (ornamental bamboo) and two bamboos (isamitake and awasetake) tell the fortune regarding any bumper crop. The &quot;isamitake&quot; and &quot;awasetake&quot; activities, where bamboo branches are hooked and pulled, are joined in by young and old alike while the audience cheers. Although it is said that there used to be a few similar examples of this kind of New Years event in Japan, this one in Ōmi is the only remaining one. This event was designated a National Important Intangible Folk Cultural Property on December 28, 1987.

<text>The Chrysler E-Class was a mid-size car produced by Chrysler. Introduced in 1983 on a stretched version of the Chrysler K platform, the E-Class was a less expensive, less equipped version of the similar 1983 New Yorker.

==History==

The Chrysler E-Class was targeted at those who wanted Chrysler luxury at a more affordable price than the flagship New Yorker. Due to this reason, the E-Class is the &quot;de facto&quot; replacement for the 1981 Newport, which had been Chrysler&#x27;s cheaper, more basic version of the New Yorker. The E-Class was originally to be called the &quot;Grand LeBaron&quot;, however Chrysler decided to name it &quot;E-Class&quot; in reference to the new E-platform.

The E-Class came with a number of features and options including a cassette player, split 50/50 front bench with middle seat mounted console, woodgrain interior trim, two-tone exterior paint, power window &amp; door locks, and air conditioning. Engines were the 2.2 L naturally aspirated I4 and the Mitsubishi 2.6 L I4. 1984 saw the debut of fuel injection on the 2.2 L engine and an optional Garrett AiResearch T-03 turbocharger. Larger, wraparound tail lights were also added for 1984.

The E-Class however, was not a sales success. Sales of the more expensive New Yorker were nearly double the E-Class&#x27;s sales for 1984. Its slow sales caused it to be dropped from Chrysler&#x27;s lineup after only two years on the market. Rather than discontinue a lower-priced model to be sold on Chrysler-Plymouth lots, Chrysler gave the car a minor refreshment (it lost the waterfall grille and crystal pentastar hood ornament) and transferred it to Plymouth&#x27;s lineup, where it became the Caravelle for 1985.

<text>was a district located in Niigata Prefecture, Japan that was dissolved in 2005.

As of 2003, the district had an estimated population of 23,292 with a density of 67.40 persons per km2. The total area was 345.56 km2.

== Municipalities ==
Prior to its dissolution, the district consisted of three towns:

* Nadachi
* Nō
* Ōmi

;Notes:
==History==
The district was founded in 1878, when the former Kubiki District was split into Higashikubiki District, Nakakubiki District, and Nishikubiki District. At the time of founding, the district covered the city of Itoigawa and the Nadachi section of the city of Jōetsu. The district seat was located at the town of Itoigawa (now the city of Itoigawa).

===District Timeline===
* On April 1, 1954 - The former town of Itoigawa absorbed the villages of Uramoto, Shimohayakawa, Kamihayakawa, Yamatogawa, Saikai, Ōno (Daino), Nechi and Kotati (Otaki) to create the city of Itoigawa.

===Recent mergers===
* On January 1, 2005 - The town of Nadachi, along with the town of Yasuzuka, the villages of Maki, Ōshima and Uragawara (all from Higashikubiki District), the towns of Itakura, Kakizaki, Ōgata and Yoshikawa, and the villages of Kiyosato, Kubiki, Nakagō and Sanwa (all from Nakakubiki District), was merged into the expanded city of Jōetsu.
* On March 19, 2005 - The towns of Nō and Ōmi were merged into the expanded city of Itoigawa. Therefore, Nishikubiki District was dissolved as a result of this merger.

<text>The Plymouth Caravelle is a mid-size sedan that was introduced by Plymouth as a 1983 Canadian model. The Caravelle came to the United States in 1985 to replace the Chrysler E-Class. It was essentially identical to the concurrent Dodge 600. It was replaced by the Plymouth Acclaim in 1989. The Caravelle was Plymouth&#x27;s first front wheel drive mid-size sedan.

The name of the vehicle was inspired by the word Caravel, a 15th-century sailing ship used by the Portuguese; the ship was noted for its speed and agility.

==United States==

For 1985, the Chrysler brand dropped its unsuccessful entry-level variant of the E platform, the Chrysler E-Class (the idea of a more mainstream Chrysler was not well received by consumers). Even though the Dodge 600 was mainstream, Dodges were not generally sold with Chryslers, so rather than only having the upscale New Yorker on Chrysler-Plymouth dealer lots, the former E-Class was given a new grille and rebranded as a Plymouth and thus the U.S. Caravelle was created. This model was slotted between the compact Reliant K and the large rear-wheel drive Gran Fury.

For its first year the Caravelle came in one trim level with a number of standard features, the Caravelle SE. These standard features including: AM/FM stereo, power windows, power locks, power adjustable mirrors, deck lid release, cruise control, air conditioning, and a 50/50 split front bench seat, with dual recliners. For 1986, the Caravelle was given a facelift, which rounded many of the sharp angles, giving it a more aerodynamic appearance. Also from 1986 onward, a base model was offered, without some of the standard features of the &quot;SE&quot;. The Caravelle continued in the U.S. until 1988, when it was replaced by the new A body Acclaim for 1989. Unlike the identical Canadian Caravelle, a 2-door coupe model was never offered in the U.S.

===Engines===
*2.2L I4 - 96 hp (72 kW) and of torque - 1985-1988
*2.2L I4 Turbo - 146 hp (109 kW) and of torque - 1985-1988
*2.5L I4 - 100 hp (75 kW) and of torque - 1986-1988
*2.6L I4 - 1986 (replaced by Chrysler&#x27;s 2.5 L engine)

==Canada==

In Canada, the Caravelle first appeared for the 1978 model year as a version of the Dodge Diplomat for Canadian Chrysler-Plymouth dealers. As all Chrysler Canada dealers sold Chryslers, only the top-of-the-line LeBaron was sold in Canada, and the Diplomat and Caravelle did not offer the top line models. The top of the range Caravelle was approximately $670 cheaper than the LeBaron. Between 1978 and mid-1981, all Caravelles were built at the Chrysler plant in St Louis. In 1983, Chrysler Canada added the E-body version of the Dodge 600, also offering it as a Plymouth Caravelle. The rear wheel drive Caravelle then became the Caravelle Salon, rather than taking the American &quot;Gran Fury&quot; name. Also in 1983, Chrysler Canada added a Caravelle version of the Dodge 400 2-door coupe. Thus the Caravelle name was used for three models in three sizes based on three platforms - K, E, and M.

The coupe was dropped after 1986 while sedan production came to an end in 1988. Like the U.S. version, the Canadian Caravelle was replaced by the Plymouth Acclaim for 1989. The Caravelle Salon, which was the original rear wheel drive version, survived until 1989.

<doc id="862339" wikidata="Q1234126" url="?curid=862339" title="Dodge 600">
<text>The Dodge 600 is a mid-size car that was sold by Dodge from the 1983 to 1988 model year. Serving as the replacement of the Dodge 400 coupe and convertible, the 600 also included a four-door sedan. Within the Dodge car line, the 600 was slotted between the Dodge Aries (later, the Dodge Lancer) and the Dodge Diplomat. 

The 600 coupe/convertible used the Chrysler K platform, shared with the Chrysler LeBaron; the four-door used the Chrysler E platform, an extended-wheelbase variant of the K platform. The 600 was a counterpart of the Plymouth Caravelle, the Chrysler E-Class, and the 1983–1988 Chrysler New Yorker. 

Chrysler assembled the 600 four-door at Jefferson Avenue Assembly (Detroit, Michigan) and the two-door/convertible at Saint Louis Assembly (Fenton, Missouri). For 1989, the 600 was replaced by the Dodge Dynasty in the United States; in Canada (where the Dynasty were badged as a Chrysler), the 600 was replaced by the Dodge Spirit. 

==Debut==
The 600 was intended to be Dodge&#x27;s answer to the European sedans of the day. Its numerical name and rear-end styling was designed to evoke thoughts of Mercedes-Benz models, however it fell more in line with North American contemporaries such as the Chevrolet Celebrity, Pontiac 6000 and the Ford Fairmont (the 600 actually resembled the Dodge Mirada more than any European car). It debuted as a four-door sedan, available in two trims: Base and ES (&quot;Euro Sport&quot;). Power was provided by Chrysler&#x27;s 2.2 L 4-cylinder engine, with the Mitsubishi-built 2.6 L 4-cylinder available as an option.

Sales of the 600 nearly doubled in its second year. This was in large part due to the addition of the former 400&#x27;s coupe and convertible body styles to the 600&#x27;s range (which continued to stay on the K platform). Like most midrange-to-upscale K-car derivatives, digital dashboards and the Electronic Voice Alert were options.

==ES Turbo==
Midway into 1984 Dodge introduced a sporty new &quot;ES Turbo&quot; package for convertibles. It featured Chrysler&#x27;s new 2.2 L Turbocharged engine (which also became an option on sedans and coupes) and a special sport-tuned &quot;ES&quot; suspension. The interior came with standard leather seats, digital dashboard, and four-spoke steering wheel (redesigned in 1985). Visual exterior cues differentiate ES models from base convertibles by way of blacked-out trim (replacing much of the chrome), 15-inch &quot;pizza&quot; style aluminum wheels, &quot;ES&quot; decklid badges, Turbo fender badges, and functioning dual hood vents.

Sales of the ES Turbo were initially slow, with only 1786 copies being sold for the 1984 model year. Output increased to 5621 for 1985, then eased to 4759 for 1986, after which the model was discontinued along with all 600 convertibles. Base price for the 1986 ES Turbo convertible was $14,856.

==Midlife changes==
Several changes were made to the 600 in 1985. The former base and ES trims were dropped, replaced by a new SE trim. This was due in part to the introduction of the Lancer, which would have competed directly with the 600 (the 5-speed manual transmission was no longer offered as well, in an attempt to keep competition between the Lancer and 600 to a minimum). The coupe and convertible remained relatively unchanged except for minor trim and interior changes. The only significant advancement was the replacement of the 2.2 L engine&#x27;s two-barrel Holley electronic feedback carburetor by an electronic throttle-body fuel injection system.

The sedan&#x27;s base trim returned in 1986, while all 600s were given new, restyled front and rear fascias (the front in particular adopted the now familiar &quot;crosshair&quot; grille, dropping the Mirada-inspired horizontal slats). The 2.6 L engine was replaced by a modified 2.5 L version of the Chrysler 2.2 L.

==End of production==
The phase out of the 600 started in 1987 with the coupe and convertible versions being discontinued in that year. Production of the sedan ended in 1988. The 600 was replaced by the 1988 Dodge Dynasty (badged as a Chrysler in Canada, whereas the Canadian successor is the Dodge Spirit).

There were negotiations to build the car in China after production ended. Hongqi imported a couple of 600s and applied a new rear end and Hongqi badging, intending to sell them as the Hongqi CA750F in China. However, Volkswagen&#x27;s long-term outlook convinced the Chinese otherwise and Hongqi chose to build the Audi 100 instead, albeit fitted with a locally built version of Chrysler&#x27;s 2.2-liter inline-four.

<text>In electrical wiring, a light switch is a switch most commonly used to operate electric lights, permanently connected equipment, or electrical outlets. Portable lamps such as table lamps may have a light switch mounted on the socket, base, or in-line with the cord. Manually operated on/off switches may be substituted by dimmer switches that allow controlling the brightness of lamps as well as turning them on or off, time-controlled switches, occupancy-sensing switches, and remotely controlled switches and dimmers. Light switches are also found in flashlights, vehicles, and other devices.

==History, culture, examples, and style==

The first light switch employing &quot;quick-break technology&quot; was invented by John Henry Holmes in 1884 in the Shieldfield district of Newcastle upon Tyne. The &quot;quick-break&quot; switch overcame the problem of a switch&#x27;s contacts developing electric arcing whenever the circuit was opened or closed. Arcing would cause pitting on one contact and the build-up of residue on the other, and the switch&#x27;s useful life would be diminished. Holmes&#x27; invention ensured that the contacts would separate or come together very quickly, however much or little pressure was exerted by the user on the switch actuator. The action of this &quot;quick break&quot; mechanism meant that there was insufficient time for an arc to form, and the switch would thus have a long working life. This &quot;quick break&quot; technology is still in use in almost every ordinary light switch in the world today, numbering in the billions, as well as in many other forms of electric switch.

The &quot;toggle light switch&quot; was invented in 1916 by William J. Newton.

As a component of an electrical wiring or home wiring system, the installation of light switches is regulated by some authority concerned with safety and standards. In different countries the standard dimensions of the wall mounting hardware (boxes, plates, etc.) may differ. Since the face-plates used must cover this hardware, these standards determine the minimum sizes of all wall mounted equipment. Hence, the shape and size of the boxes and face-plates, as well as what is integrated, varies from country to country.

The dimensions, mechanical designs, and even the general appearance of light switches have changed slowly over time. Switches typically remain in service for many decades, often being changed only when a portion of a house is rewired. It is not unusual to see century-old light switches still in functional use. Manufacturers introduce various new forms and styles, but for the most part decoration and fashion concerns are limited to the face-plates or wall-plates. Even the &quot;modern&quot; dimmer switch with knob is at least forty years old, and in even the newest construction the familiar toggle and rocker switch formats predominate.

===Orientation===
The direction which represents &quot;on&quot; also varies by country. In the US and Canada, it is usual for the &quot;on&quot; position of a toggle switch to be &quot;up&quot;, whereas in many other countries such as the UK, Ireland, and other European countries as well as India, Australia, New Zealand (Commonwealth countries), Egypt, and China it is &quot;down&quot;. (In multiway switching, the correspondence between a single switch&#x27;s state and whether lights are on or off depends on the state of the other switch[es] in the circuit.)

==Design==
The switches may be single or multiple, designed for indoor or outdoor use. Optional extras may include dimmer-controls, environmental protection, weather and security protection. In residential and light commercial lighting systems, the light switch directly controls the circuit feeding the lamps. In larger lighting systems, for example warehouses or outdoor lighting systems, the required current may be too high for a manual switch. In these systems light switches control lighting contactors, a relay that allows the manual light switch to operate on a lower current, with smaller wiring than would be required in the main lighting circuit.

In the UK, putting 13-ampere BS 1363 sockets on a lighting circuit is discouraged (although not outright prohibited), but 2-ampere or 5-ampere BS 546 outlets are often put on lighting circuits to allow control of free-standing lamps from the room&#x27;s light switches. In North American site-built and mobile homes, often living rooms and bedrooms have a switched receptacle for a floor or table lamp. Such receptacles are referred to as &#x27; or &#x27;.

==Variations on design==

===Push button===

The push-button light switch has two buttons: one that closes the contacts and one that opens the contacts. Pushing the raised button opens or closes the contacts and pops out the previously depressed button so the process can be reversed. In the U.S., the buttons were commonly black; the &quot;on&quot; button typically had a white mother-of-pearl (real or simulated) inlay to indicate its function. By convention, the switch was customarily installed with the &quot;on&quot; button on top. Push-button switch reproductions are available on the market today for vintage or authentic styling.
===Toggle===
The toggle mechanism provides &quot;snap-action&quot; through the use of an &quot;over-center&quot; geometry. The design was patented in 1916 by William J. Newton and Morris Goldberg. The switch actuator does not control the contacts directly, but through an intermediate arrangement of springs and levers. Turning the actuator does not initially cause any motion of the contacts, which in fact continue to be positively held open by the force of the spring. Turning the actuator gradually stretches the spring. When the mechanism passes over the center point, the spring energy is released and the spring, rather than the actuator, drives the contacts rapidly and forcibly to the closed position with an audible &quot;snapping&quot; sound. This mechanism is safe, reliable, and durable, but produces a loud snap or click.

===Illuminated switch===

Illuminated switches incorporate a small neon lamp or LED, allowing the user easily to locate the switch in the dark. Household illuminated switches were introduced in the mid-1950s.

Single-pole illuminated switches derive the power to energize their in-built illuminating source (usually, a &quot;neon&quot; lamp) from the current passing through the lamp(s) which they control. Such switches work satisfactorily with incandescent lamps, halogen lighting, and non-electronic fluorescent fixtures, because the small current required for the switch&#x27;s illuminating source is too small to produce any visible light from such devices controlled by the illuminated switch. However, if they control only compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and/or LED lamps, the small amount of current required to energize the lighting source within switch also slowly charges the internal input capacitor in the electronic ballast of the CFL or LED until the voltage across it rises to the point where it produces a brief discharge through the CFL. This cycle may repeat indefinitely, resulting in repetitive brief flashing of the lamp(s) (and the light inside the switch) while the illuminated switch is in the &quot;off&quot; position.
===Rocker===

An alternative design to the toggle switch is the rocker switch. Large switches of this design are commonly known in the United States as &quot;decorator&quot; or &quot;Decora&quot; style. &quot;Decora&quot; is a trademark of Leviton, and the term in recent years has become a genericized trademark in the United States for any rocker light switch regardless of brand. Switches of this design sit almost flush with the wall plate, and are activated by &quot;rocking&quot; a flat, broad lever, rather than pushing a short protruding actuator up or down.

In Europe, Brazil, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, and India this type is near-universal, and toggle style switches would be considered old-fashioned.
===Australian rocker switches===

In Australia and New Zealand, a small rocker switch is almost universally used, in the form of a switch mechanism, which is mounted from behind into a wall-plate—attaching via mounting lugs, as shown in the photo on the left. A slightly larger &quot;cover plate&quot;, supplied with the wall-plate, or additional to it, then clips over the assembly, as an additional insulating barrier covering the deep set wall-plate mounting screws - which are &quot;deep set&quot; to prevent inadvertent human contact. The &quot;cover plate&quot; can be removed without the use of tools, such as when wall painting is required.

While larger &quot;decorator&quot; style switches are readily available in Australia, the advantage of the smaller mechanisms is that wall-plates are available to mount from one to six individual switch mechanisms, or other correspondingly sized &quot;mechanisms&quot; - such as dimmers and indicator lights - in the same space as one (or two) switches of larger design could be mounted. Since the mechanisms are small, they can also be mounted into &quot;architrave&quot; plates, for mounting in positions where it is not possible to mount a &quot;standard&quot; sized wall-plate. An example is shown in the picture below on the right. All of the switch mechanisms have no exposed metal parts requiring grounding (earthing). While switches, wall-plates, and cover plates from different manufacturers tend not to be interchangeable, switch mechanisms of this type have been available in Australia since 1951.

The keystone module system for extra-low voltage electrical jacks (patented in 1975) is somewhat similar in appearance to these modules, but the design of the keystone mountings are different, and keystone modules can be removed without a tool. (A similar system, but with bigger switches, is used in Italy.)

As shown in the disassembly photo, the switch actuator pivots in two holes in the sides of the plastic switch body. An actuator bar slides in two grooves inside the actuator, pressed down by a compression spring into a notch in the common contact bar. The common contact bar is free to rock on a small diameter rod, welded to the common terminal. However, because of the pressure applied by the compression spring, the common contact bar will always be held against one of the two contacts.

When the actuator is moved, mechanical energy is stored in the compression spring until the actuator passes its mid-position. At that time, the common contact bar is forced in the opposite direction by the compression spring, acting via the actuator bar, thus breaking the connection with the existing contact and making connection with the other contact. The common contact bar is made of copper, with an inlay of harder contact metal on the underside. While it is free to move the required distance lengthwise, it is constrained from moving sideways by the construction of the molded plastic body.

The screw terminals are hollow and allow up to at least three 1 mm (CSA) wires, twisted together, to be inserted to a depth of up to and secured with a set screw. The contact terminal set screws are installed at a slight angle to allow easier screwdriver access after the switch mechanism has been installed into a wall-plate - before fixing the wall-plate to the wall. Also shown is a &quot;loop&quot; connection terminal. This terminal plays no part in the action of the switch but, because there is available space, it is provided as an insulated terminal for joining other wires, if required (such as the neutral wires). Each Australian rocker switch mechanism is actually a single-pole, double-throw (SPDT) Switch, also known as a &quot;two-way switch&quot;, and has three terminals.

A switch of basically the same design is also used on Australian power outlet wall-plates. It is now extremely rare to find any other type of switch in Australian homes, although the Australian Wiring Standard AS 3112 does not forbid other types.
While many variations of Australian designs and cover plates are available, some designers and renovators may import UK- and European-designed switches when they desire a particular finish. However, while standard Australian wall &quot;mounting&quot; plates have the same dimensions as those used in North America, they have different dimensions from those used in the UK or Europe.

Switches (and other mechanisms) of this Australian design series are currently available in the UK (and other countries), together with wall-plates appropriate to the mounting standards of the countries concerned.

For a short time, Australian rocker switches were exported to the United States in the 1960s. Although the switches had adequate ratings for usage on 120 V circuits and had advantages of compactness and distinctive appearance, they failed to establish themselves in the American market.
===Tamper resistant===
Where lighting circuits must not be accidentally switched off, for example, corridor and restroom lighting controls in public buildings such as schools, a tamper-resistant switch may be installed. These require a key to operate and so discourage casual or accidental operation of the switch.

===Voltage class===
In North American commercial and industrial lighting installations, lighting installed on 480Y/277 V 3-phase circuits uses voltages higher than the rating of common 120 V switches.

===Mercury switch===
Around the middle of the 20th century, &quot;quiet&quot; switches were introduced that used mercury to make the connection, avoiding the loud snap made by the spring-loaded toggle switches that were then the norm. One form of mercury light switch uses a sealed glass vial that is tipped by the toggle lever, causing a drop of liquid metallic mercury to roll from one end to the other, bridging a pair of contacts to complete the circuit. Another style of mercury light switch uses a metal wheel with an insulator separating the two halves that has a hole which allows the mercury to connect either side of the wheel in only one position.

Some of these switches were also equipped with a neon lamp connected across the contacts, and thus in series with the electrical load. This caused the indicator to glow faintly when the switch was off, as an aid to finding the switch in a dark room.

By the 1970s, other quiet switch designs that did not require mercury (and were thus simpler and cheaper to produce) came into widespread use, gradually replacing both conventional &quot;snap&quot; toggle switches and mercury-based quiet switches.
===Pull-chain or pull-cord===

A light switch combined with a light socket is sometimes installed in basement or utility areas of homes. The switch is operated by a pull chain or cord. It is also possible to have the cord-operated switch separate from the light socket, which is particularly common in British bathrooms. Until 2001, UK wiring regulations required that all bathroom switches were operated by pull cords.

===Floor switch===

Also called foot switch. It is a type of switch for tall floor lamps, mounted on the power cord, usually stays on the floor and it is operated by foot. It is also used for other small home appliances, like fans or heaters (usually higher ratings). 

===Power cord mounted===
This type of switch is mounted on the power cord, both in middle or at the end. They are light weight, and they are used mainly for low power devices, like table lamps, table fans, radios and many other low power devices. Usually, they are single pole single throw but can also double pole single throw. They can be mounted either in the middle of the plug and consumer or they may be mounted at the end of the cable. 
There are also more sophisticated cord mounted switches, like multiple switching (for lamps with more than one bulb, or fans with more speeds, in this case they have one input and 2 or more outputs), variators and dimmers (light dimmers, electric pillows and mattresses or some fans with more speeds). Some older heaters may also use such switches, but with higher ratings. 
Usually their current rating is between 0.5 A, mainly limited to low powered lamps at mains voltage, up to 6 or even 10 A (like heaters) . Higher current ratings may also allow usage in high current but low voltage (6-24 V) applications.

===Dimmer switch===

A dimmer switch, properly called a &quot;dimmer control&quot;, contains a solid-state circuit to allow changing the brightness by reducing the average voltage applied to the lamp.

===Electronic switches===
In principle, it is easy to design silent switches in which the mechanical contacts do not directly control the current but simply signal a solid-state device such as a thyristor to complete the circuit. Many variations on this theme have been created and marketed. &quot;Touch-plate&quot; devices can be operated by touching or merely waving a hand near the switch. Touch switches have no moving parts and electronically switch the light circuit. these remain specialty items. Electronic switches provide flexibility in terms of different interfaces for their operations, such as touch plates, soft-touch controls, pressure or light sensor-based control, interactive touch-screens (which are widely used in aircraft for lighting control), and others.

Public buildings such as hospitals frequently save energy by using motion detector switches, also known as occupancy sensors. The occupancy sensors can also be used in residential applications such as in bathrooms, garages, and hallways.

A wireless light switch provides remote control of lighting using a hand-held transmitter. While the controlling device may be a unit dedicated to this purpose, increasingly such switches may be controlled by the technology (such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi) now found in smartphones.

Wired remote control of lighting switches is also possible using, for example, X10 signaling over the power wires.

==Multiway switching==
Two or more light switches can be interconnected to allow control of lighting from, for example, two ends of a long hallway or landings at the upper and lower landings of a flight of stairs. Multiway switching is done using special switches that have additional contacts.

==Materials==

Earlier switches were made of porcelain in the surface-mounted version and operated as a rotary switch with a rotary mechanism. Later, more durable Bakelite and Ebonite was used. Today they are made of modern plastics, like Polycarbonate or fire-resistant ABS. Some switches may also be manufactured from other plastics like polyamide, polypropylene or pvc but mainly limited to wire mounted switches (like night lamp switches) mainly due to reduced weight, and most such switches are not used in high power devices (mainly table lamps, table fans, some radios) mainly up to 2 amperes. In some cases, especially in hospitals and other public facilities, exposed parts of light switches are made of antimicrobial materials such as copper, for infection control.

<text>The Music Factory (TMF) was an originally Dutch brand of television and radio channels operated focusing on pop music. It was similar to the American MTV which took over TMF in 2002. 

TMF operated channels in the Netherlands (TMF Nederland) as well as in the UK with TMF UK and Australia with (TMF Australia). The brand is owned by MTV Networks International (part of the Viacom conglomerate). It shows only pop videos and locally produced live programming in Belgium. Likewise, with TMF Netherlands before its closure, the British TMF aired some of MTV&#x27;s and VH1&#x27;s programmes like &quot;Cribs&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Hogan Knows Best&quot; and &quot;Run&#x27;s House&quot;. 

The channel operated until 26 October 2009 in the UK and Ireland, 1 September 2011 in the Netherlands and 1 November 2015 in Belgium. Viacom International Media Networks, the international arm of Viacom, owns the brand.

==TMF Nederland==

TMF Nederland was launched on 1 May 1995 as the only local pop station in the Netherlands. It was founded by Lex Harding and the Arcade company. The station gradually began to get better viewer figures than MTV, so in 2002, MTV bought shares in TMF. Since 1996 headquartered in Bussum, the channel was notable for its dance music mixes. In 2005, three new channels, plus a radio station began broadcasting in the Netherlands under the TMF brand:

* TMF Dance - specialised in German, British, French, Belgian and Dutch trance and house music. Formerly known as &quot;TMF Party&quot;.
* TMF NL - specialised in local Dutch music.
* TMF Pure - specialised in Soul, and R&amp;B music.
* TMF Hit Radio - Launched on 27 December 2006 and later dropped the TMF branding which soon after became &#x27;Hit Radio&#x27;

On 1 September 2011, TMF Nederland ceased broadcasting in the Netherlands entirely, and on 31 December 2011 all digital channels ceased operations.

==TMF Flanders==
TMF Flanders (TMF Vlaanderen) was the first international extension of the TMF brand, broadcast to viewers in the Belgian region of Flanders. TMF Flanders first day on air was October 3, 1998. TMF Flanders was the first Flemish-specific channel that was dedicated to video clip broadcast. VJs at the beginning included Stijn Smets, Yasmine, Inge Moerenhout and Katja Retsin. In the early few years, the broadcasts of TMF Flanders were conducted from the same Dutch studio facility that operated TMF Netherlands.

Until 2010 its broadcast were entirely in Dutch with local Flemish presenters. From the start, TMF Flanders is being distributed via cable-TV (analog and/or digital) and IPTV. Founded in 1998, its headquarters were in Mechelen but moved to Lint and later (after the re-alignment of VIMN Northern Europe) to Antwerp (local office) and Stockholm (channel operations). It is the sole TMF channel that is currently still in operation, but it has dropped all its presented programs in 2012. Since 2014 Comedy Central airs on its channel after 10pm. On November 1, 2015 TMF Vlaanderen ceased broadcasting. The channel was replaced by Comedy Central Vlaanderen, ending the TMF-era. In 2007, a second channel was launched and began broadcasting under the TMF brand: 

* TMF Live HD - specialised in live music.

On 31 July 2010, TMF Live HD ceased operations.

On 1 November 2015, TMF Flanders ceased broadcasting in Belgium entirely, making Comedy Central a 24 hours channel.

==TMF UK &amp; Ireland==

TMF launched on 30 October 2002 as a counter against EMAP&#x27;s The Hits request music channel on Freeview. The channel was also available on Sky Digital and Virgin Media. The channel, alongside its music output, showed reruns of successful MTV and VH1 shows such as &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot;, &quot;Jackass&quot; and &quot;Cribs&quot;. There was also a Noggin strand in the morning for pre-school children.

On Mondays, TMF used to broadcast The Official UK Top 40 narrated by Phil Clifton, a day after it was broadcast on BBC Radio 1. The show featured videos of the singles of the previous week and charts their position in terms of record sales. On 26 October 2009, TMF UK &amp; Ireland was replaced with the UK version of VIVA.

== TMF Australia ==
MTV Networks Australia launched a local version of TMF as a fully integrated, multi-platform 24-hour music channel in May 2007. TMF focused on the interactive playground and along with a selection of music video clips including programming and viewer-generated content including images, videos, text-based applications and graphics. Furthering the connectivity between the platforms, TMF was the first music channel in Australia to seamlessly connect all platforms as well as simulcast to mobile 24 a day via the Optus Zoo mobile portal launched in September 2007.

However, in November 2010, TMF Australia was replaced with an Australian version of MTV Hits.

==TMF Awards==

The channel organized an annual music award show, the TMF Awards, in the Netherlands and Belgium.
In addition, there were the TMF Game Awards, an annual awards show for games.

<doc id="862355" wikidata="Q7960181" url="?curid=862355" title="Masquerade (trope)">
<text>A masquerade is a Trope (literature) that is used to conceal the identity and certain characteristics of a figure. This concealment has the effect of highlighting some unique or noteworthy aspect of a character or situation, despite its suggested intention of subtlety. There exists the true nature of a character or situation alongside the image that is outwardly displayed and perceived by others in that universe, which can create a layered complexity that adds depth and dimension to the narrative.

The historical traces of this term extend deeply throughout history and its influence on the texts in which appears becomes increasingly more dynamic and a variety of genres take advantage of the masquerade trope. It&#x27;s popularly employed in the fantasy and superhero genres, but there are other instances in which it can be found across various fictional works. 

== Etymology ==
The late 16th century English word &quot;masquerade&quot; is reported to have origins in the French word &quot;mascarade&quot;, the Spanish word &quot;mascarada&quot;, and the Italian word &quot;mascarata&quot;, all of which relate to the masking of one&#x27;s appearance or identity. Contemporary uses and meaning of the word has become more broad, but initial uses only served to define the literal act of donning a mask or in the context of a masquerade ball.

== Usage ==
The use of masquerade tropes is extensive and spans across many different sub-genres of fictional work. Evidence of masks being used as a way of marking and emphasizing certain character traits first surface in early Greek and Roman theatrical works. This motif evolves and becomes more complex at the beginning of the Middle Ages with the introduction of separation of character and identity of an individual by Augustine of Hippo and experienced further growth beyond this time period. 

Its use as a more advanced literary device begins to emerge particularly in pieces produced in the 18th century and many significant stages of its growth can be traced to this period. However, there can be examples found across a vast majority of different types of media, and is not limited to only written literature. Some have pointed to how characterization is further built and developed as a result of using masquerade tropes. It constructs more dimension around characters, in some situations attributing conflicting traits to a single individual, which leads readers to regard them as more complex and unique rather than a predictable figure. 

=== 18th century literature ===
This trope was particularly prevalent in fictional works produced in the 18th century. Its implementation has been discussed as a way to explore the various social constraints placed on the authors and their own realities. The masquerade trope is also often pointed to as a way of expressing or commenting on different forms of femininity. As its use increased the masquerade became associated heavily with themes of female promiscuity and sexual freedom.

Initial signs of this trope appearing have been found as early as 1673 with John Dryden&#x27;s Marriage à la mode, which had continued and increased adaptations of the original playwright through the mid-1700&#x27;s. The focus placed on masquerade is comparatively primitive and sparse in this original production. However, it has been considered to be the inspiration of the emergence of various subsequent performances, each of which have provided contributions to the formation of the contemporary masquerade trope.

There have been several notable women writers that have utilized this trope as a way of speaking on and representing both the expectations and reality of the feminine experience. Eliza Haywood is one of many known for expressing this perspective and is often referenced when analyzing this theme. Her works tend to highlight female characters, who are otherwise oppressed by socio-economic normative expectations, explore their gender identity and sexuality in an uninhibited way as a result of the masquerade. The false identity that is adopted by these characters allows them to act in ways that would be considered atypical or even prohibited. Women writers such as Haywood have been known for cultivating this relationship between using the mask and themes of femininity, establishing greater associations of promiscuity and sexual freedoms surrounding masquerades more broadly.

=== Fantasy ===
Commonly used in speculative fiction, a group of supernatural or otherwise extraordinary people will hide their existence from the mainstream society in their respective setting. These hidden groups are sometimes referred to as a &quot;wainscot society&quot;, wherein they live parallel to mainstream society in a covert manner, but overall remain their own distinct entity with their own culture.

In a fantasy context, it means that magic is hidden, whether in secret locations, such as Diagon Alley in &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, or by magical forces, such as the Mist in &quot;Percy Jackson&quot;, or a glamour placed on individuals.

That is typically done to avoid some type of mass panic that would result in the destruction of the magical world by far more numerous normal people fearing the unknown. Masquerade societies may seek to hide this information from outsiders, or they may be disbelieved due to ignorance, conspiracies, or consensus reality. In works of fantasy with horror aspects, such as H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos, the Buffyverse, or White Wolf Games&#x27; World of Darkness setting, the majority&#x27;s ignorance of the fantastical elements of their world will be portrayed as being to their own benefit.

The trope is used not only in fantasy but also in science fiction and superhero stories. A common device to keep hidden events from the masses in science fiction is the existence of aliens, such as in the &quot;Men in Black&quot; series. The secret identities of superheroes are also a type of masquerade, and the only superheroes that show their true identity are ones who can keep their family safe or have nothing to protect.

The masquerade trope assists writers by adding additional tension to the story, as well as helping the story appear plausible. It also saves the author from needing to write an alternate history in order to explain the existence of magic.

<doc id="862359" wikidata="Q936196" url="?curid=862359" title="John Harkes">
<text>John Andrew Harkes (born March 8, 1967) is an American soccer coach and former professional player who last coached Greenville Triumph SC.

A member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame, Harkes was the first American to play in the English Premier League with Sheffield Wednesday, the second American to score at Wembley, and the first American soccer player to appear in the final of a major English tournament, in the 1991 Football League Cup Final with Sheffield Wednesday. After moving to Major League Soccer in 1996, he won two MLS Cup titles with D.C. United.

A mainstay in the U.S. national team midfield for most of the 1990s, Harkes appeared in two FIFA World Cup tournaments. He was named the team&#x27;s &quot;Captain for Life&quot; by then-head coach Steve Sampson before having that title stripped ahead of the 1998 World Cup. Harkes ended his national team career with 90 caps and six goals.

Following his retirement, he served as a color commentator for ESPN&#x27;s coverage of MLS and U.S. international matches, including the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

==Amateur career==
===High school===
Harkes grew up in the soccer hotbed of Kearny, New Jersey, and played youth and high school soccer with future national team teammates Tony Meola and Tab Ramos.

Harkes graduated from Kearny High School in 1985. During his high school career, Harkes played in four New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association championship matches and led his team to the 1984 Group 4 State Championship and a 24–0 record. He was the 1984 Parade High School Player of the Year.

In 1999, he was named by &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; as one of the top ten New Jersey high school soccer players of the 1980s.

===College===
Harkes played for University of Virginia where he was named 1st team All-American in 1986 and 1987, and was the Hermann Award winner in 1987, as the best player in US colleges.

==Professional career==
===England: 1990–1996===
Harkes moved to Sheffield Wednesday of the English Football League in 1990. In a game that season against Derby County, his 35-yard blast glided into the net past former England World Cup goalkeeper Peter Shilton and earned him English football&#x27;s &quot;Goal of the Season&quot; award. That season, Harkes became the third American (after Bill Regan for Romford in the 1948–49 FA Amateur Cup final and Mike Masters for Colchester United in the 1991-92 FA Trophy final) to play at Wembley when Sheffield Wednesday reached the 1991 League Cup final. There, the Second Division (now Football League Championship) Wednesday upset the First Division (now Premier League) side Manchester United 1–0. Also that year, Wednesday won promotion to the First Division.

In 1993, Harkes became the only American to score in a League Cup Final, in a 2–1 loss to Arsenal. His goal was the second by an American at Wembley Stadium following Mike Masters&#x27; goal for Colchester United in the F.A. Trophy Final the year before. He appeared in the FA Cup Final one month after that League Cup disappointment, with Sheffield Wednesday again losing to Arsenal (2–1 in the replay, after a 1–1 draw in the first game). Harkes played one more season in England after moving to Derby County in the summer of 1993. In 1995, Major League Soccer (MLS) began preparing for its first season, which it first thought would come in the fall of 1995. As part of that process, MLS signed prominent U.S. players to league contracts. Harkes was one of the players who signed with MLS, only to discover the league would not begin play until 1996. Therefore, he, and MLS, negotiated a one-year loan to West Ham United.

===Major League Soccer: 1996–2003===

In 1996, Harkes, along with his U.S. national teammates based overseas, returned to the U.S. for the launch of Major League Soccer. MLS had signed numerous prominent U.S. players and eventually allocated them throughout the league&#x27;s teams in order to create an initial equitable distribution of talent. MLS allocated Harkes to D.C. United, making him the team&#x27;s first player ever. That first season, he led the club to a MLS Cup win and a U.S. Open Cup title. D.C. United successfully defended its MLS Cup title in 1997, with Harkes assisting on the match-winning goal in the cup final.

Despite the disappointment of being left off the 1998 World Cup squad, Harkes helped United capture the Supporters Shield for the best regular season record in the league, before losing in the MLS Cup Final to the Chicago Fire. He also helped United become the first MLS club to win the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup and upset Brazil&#x27;s Vasco Da Gama in the Interamerican Cup.

At the end of the 1998 season, he traveled back to England for a two-week trial with Nottingham Forest. On January 28, 1999, the team accepted Harkes for a two-month loan period. He played only three games for Forest (including the infamous 8–1 defeat to Manchester United) before returning to the U.S.

====New England Revolution====

On February 2, 1999 While Harkes was in England, D.C. United traded him to the New England Revolution in exchange for New England’s first- and second-round picks in the 2000 MLS SuperDraft and future considerations. United traded Harkes in order to make room under the salary cap. Some uncertainty surrounded the trade, as the Revolution expected Harkes to report by March 15, while Forest insisted the loan would keep Harkes in England until the end of the Premier League season. Revolution General Manager Brian O&#x27;Donovan stated that if Harkes failed to join by mid-March, the deal would be off.

Ultimately, on March 16, Harkes&#x27; loan spell ended, allowing him to officially join New England. Harkes made his New England debut on May 15 vs. the Columbus Crew, coming on as a 75th minute substitute for Edwin Gorter. He made his first start for the Revolution on May 23 in a 1-0 loss to the LA Galaxy. He made his home debut on June 5 in a 2-0 loss to the Chicago Fire. Additionally, Harkes captained the Revolution twice in the 1999 New England Revolution season, on August 6 and October 9. He recorded 8 assists in 22 matches played during his inaugural Revolution campaign. Harkes wore the captain&#x27;s armband for much of the 2000 New England Revolution season, helping the Revolution reach the MLS Playoffs for the first time since 1997. He scored his first goal for the club on June 3 in the Revolution&#x27;s 2-0 win over the Miami Fusion. Harkes was the only player to represent the Revolution in the 2000 MLS All-Star Game. Harkes would make only five appearances for the Revolution during the 2001 New England Revolution season as on May 11, 2001, the Revolution dealt Harkes to the Columbus Crew in exchange for Pato Aguilera and a conditional pick in
the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. After an injury-plagued 2002 season, Harkes announced his retirement in 2003.

==International career==

John Harkes played in the 1990 and 1994 FIFA World Cup
Harkes made his national team debut on March 23, 1987, against Canada. He was on the U.S. team at the 1987 Pan American Games. He quickly established himself as a national team regular and was selected for the 1988 Olympics. That year the U.S. went 1–1–1 and failed to qualify for the second round. Harkes continued to play for the national team as it went through the qualification process for the upcoming World Cup. The team qualified for those games after an improbable 1–0 road victory over Trinidad and Tobago in the final qualification match.

In 1990, he was a member of a World Cup squad made up mostly of college and semi-professional players. The United States side was routed 1–5 by Czechoslovakia, but were respectable losing 0–1 to host nation and eventual semi-finalist Italy, and 1–2 to Austria. Despite losing all three matches, many players from the 1990 squad, including Harkes, Ramos, Meola, Marcelo Balboa formed the core of the U.S. national team for most of the decade and played an important role in the development of MLS.

U.S. fared better as the host nation in the 1994 World Cup, upsetting Colombia 2–1 in a group stage match to advance to the Round of 16. Harkes contributed to the Andrés Escobar own goal which arguably led to the Colombian defender&#x27;s shooting death weeks later. Harkes delivered a cross from the left aimed at Earnie Stewart, which Escobar attempted to clear, but instead sent the ball past his goalkeeper.

However, Harkes missed the Round of 16 match against Brazil after receiving his second yellow card of the group stage against Romania, earning a one-match suspension. Brazil won the match 1–0 and went on to win the World Cup.

In Copa América 1995, Harkes led the United States, a guest team at the tournament, to a 3–0 upset of defending champion Argentina and a semi-final finish. He was named co-Most Valuable Player of the tournament, along with Uruguayan Enzo Francescoli.

===1998 World Cup controversy===
In 1996, before the beginning of the qualifying for the 1998 World Cup, head coach Steve Sampson named Harkes &quot;Captain For Life&quot;, which meant Harkes would be the captain of the national team as long as he wished and Sampson was the coach. He responded by leading the team in assists in qualifying and helped the United States qualify for a third straight World Cup finals appearance.

However, Sampson controversially left Harkes off the World Cup squad, citing &quot;leadership issues&quot;, although the decision was never fully explained at the time. The bitterness resulting from the omission and the irony of the &quot;Captain for Life&quot; title would serve as the inspiration for his autobiography, &quot;Captain for Life: And Other Temporary Assignments&quot; (), co-written with Denise Kiernan and published in 1999. In the book, Harkes criticized Sampson for lacking &quot;credibility to a group of guys who had hundreds and hundreds of caps among them&quot; and &quot;putting a huge amount of pressure on young, internationally inexperienced players&quot;, and concluded, &quot;I can&#x27;t think of one thing that Steve did right in the months leading up to the World Cup&quot;. The 1998 team lost all three games in the group stage, finishing last overall.

In February 2010 Sampson and former teammate Eric Wynalda revealed that an alleged affair between Harkes and Wynalda&#x27;s wife, Amy, had prompted Harkes&#x27; sudden dismissal. Sampson confirmed Wynalda&#x27;s claim in a 2016 podcast interview with Alexi Lalas.

Harkes was called up to the national team again by his former college coach, Bruce Arena in 1999, and helped the United States win the bronze medal in the Confederations Cup that year. He ended his international career in 2000 with 90 appearances.

==Coaching career==

In August 2015, the formation of FC Cincinnati, a new franchise in the then-third-division United Soccer League, was announced, with Harkes as the team&#x27;s first head coach. In FC Cincinnati&#x27;s first season under Harkes, the club finished third in the USL Eastern Conference with a 12–6–4 record. However, on February 17, 2017, FC Cincinnati announced the firing of Harkes ahead of the 2017 season. From outside the club, the dismissal was seen as a surprise; reports later emerged of a 2016–17 offseason that was &quot;unstructured and somewhat chaotic behind the scenes&quot;, according to &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;&#x27;s Pat Brennan.

In August 2018, Harkes was named as the first head coach of Greenville Triumph, a new club set to join USL League One in 2019. Harkes was signed to a three-year contract to lead the entire technical side of the organization. In the team&#x27;s first season, they finished third in the standings and were the runner-up in the playoffs. In the 2020 season, the Triumph finished first in the standings and won the playoffs, and Harkes was named the USL League One Coach of the Year. On January 26, 2021, the Triumph extended Harkes&#x27;s contract through the 2023 season. The Triumph finished second in the standings in both the 2021 and 2022 seasons.

==Off the field==
In 2010, Eric Wynalda stated that former U.S. national team head coach Steve Sampson had dropped Harkes from the 1998 World Cup team two months prior to the tournament because Harkes had been having relations with teammate Wynalda&#x27;s wife, Amy, in the couple&#x27;s house, and near the playpen of their young child. Sampson became aware of the scandal and brewing feud between Wynalda and Harkes, and chose to drop Harkes to restore dressing room accord. Despite intense criticism from the media and subsequent failure in the World Cup, Sampson remained silent regarding the true reason for Harkes&#x27; dismissal from the team out of respect for the privacy of those involved. Harkes himself published an autobiography in 1999 panning Sampson&#x27;s tenure as coach, but made no mention of the affair.

===Personal life===
Both of Harkes&#x27; parents are Scottish immigrants; his father Jim is originally from Dundee, and was a youth team player at Dundee United.

He is the father of Lauren Harkes, who played collegiately at Clemson University, and Ian Harkes, who won the Hermann Trophy in 2016, played for John&#x27;s old team, D.C. United, Dundee United in Scotland, and for the New England Revolution, where John played from 1999 to 2001.

<doc id="862361" wikidata="Q534307" url="?curid=862361" title="Hückel's rule">
<text>In organic chemistry, Hückel&#x27;s rule predicts that a planar ring molecule will have aromatic properties if it has 4&quot;n&quot; + 2 π-electrons, where &quot;n&quot; is a non-negative integer. The quantum mechanical basis for its formulation was first worked out by physical chemist Erich Hückel in 1931. The succinct expression as the 4&quot;n&quot; + 2 rule has been attributed to W. v. E. Doering (1951), although several authors were using this form at around the same time.

In agreement with the Möbius–Hückel concept, a cyclic ring molecule follows Hückel&#x27;s rule when the number of its π-electrons equals 4&quot;n&quot; + 2, although clearcut examples are really only established for values of &quot;n&quot; = 0 up to about &quot;n&quot; = 6. Hückel&#x27;s rule was originally based on calculations using the Hückel method, although it can also be justified by considering a particle in a ring system, by the LCAO method and by the Pariser–Parr–Pople method.

Aromatic compounds are more stable than theoretically predicted using hydrogenation data of simple alkenes; the additional stability is due to the delocalized cloud of electrons, called &quot;resonance energy&quot;. Criteria for simple aromatics are:
# the molecule must have 4&quot;n&quot; + 2 (a so-called &quot;Hückel number&quot;) π electrons (2, 6, 10, ...) in a conjugated system of p orbitals (usually on sp2-hybridized atoms, but sometimes sp-hybridized);
# the molecule must be (close to) planar (p orbitals must be roughly parallel and able to interact, implicit in the requirement for conjugation);
# the molecule must be cyclic (as opposed to linear);
# the molecule must have a continuous ring of p atomic orbitals (there cannot be any sp3 atoms in the ring, nor do exocyclic p orbitals count).

==Monocyclic hydrocarbons==
The rule can be used to understand the stability of completely conjugated monocyclic hydrocarbons (known as annulenes) as well as their cations and anions.
The best-known example is benzene (C6H6) with a conjugated system of six π electrons, which equals 4&quot;n&quot; + 2 for &quot;n&quot; = 1. The molecule undergoes substitution reactions which preserve the six π electron system rather than addition reactions which would destroy it. The stability of this π electron system is referred to as aromaticity. Still, in most cases, catalysts are necessary for substitution reactions to occur.

The cyclopentadienyl anion () with six π electrons is planar and readily generated from the unusually acidic cyclopentadiene (p&quot;K&quot;a 16), while the corresponding cation with four π electrons is destabilized, being harder to generate than a typical acyclic pentadienyl cations and is thought to be antiaromatic. Similarly, the tropylium cation (), also with six π electrons, is so stable compared to a typical carbocation that its salts can be crystallized from ethanol. On the other hand, in contrast to cyclopentadiene, cycloheptatriene is not particularly acidic (p&quot;K&quot;a 37) and the anion is considered nonaromatic. The cyclopropenyl cation () and the triboracyclopropenyl dianion () are considered examples of a two π electron system, which are stabilized relative to the open system, despite the angle strain imposed by the 60° bond angles.

Planar ring molecules with 4&quot;n&quot; π electrons do not obey Hückel&#x27;s rule, and theory predicts that they are less stable and have triplet ground states with two unpaired electrons. In practice, such molecules distort from planar regular polygons. Cyclobutadiene (C4H4) with four π electrons is stable only at temperatures below 35 K and is rectangular rather than square. Cyclooctatetraene (C8H8) with eight π electrons has a nonplanar &quot;tub&quot; structure. However, the dianion (cyclooctatetraenide anion), with ten π electrons obeys the 4&quot;n&quot; + 2 rule for &quot;n&quot; = 2 and is planar, while the 1,4-dimethyl derivative of the dication, with six π electrons, is also believed to be planar and aromatic. The Cyclononatetraenide anion () is the largest all-&quot;cis&quot; monocyclic annulene/annulenyl system that is planar and aromatic. These bond angles (140°) differ significantly from the ideal angles of 120°. Larger rings possess &quot;trans&quot; bonds to avoid the increased angle strain. However, 10 to 14-membered systems all experience considerable transannular strain. Thus, these systems are either nonaromatic or experience modest aromaticity. This changes when we get to [18]annulene, with (4×4) + 2 = 18 π electrons, which is large enough to accommodate six interior hydrogen atoms in a planar configuration (3 &quot;cis&quot; double bonds and 6 &quot;trans&quot; double bonds). Thermodynamic stabilization, NMR chemical shifts, and nearly equal bond lengths all point to considerable aromaticity for [18]annulene.

The (4n+2) rule is a consequence of the degeneracy of the π orbitals in cyclic conjugated hydrocarbon molecules. As predicted by Hückel molecular orbital theory, the lowest π orbital in such molecules is non-degenerate and the higher orbitals form degenerate pairs. Benzene&#x27;s lowest π orbital is non-degenerate and can hold 2 electrons, and its next 2 π orbitals form a degenerate pair which can hold 4 electrons. Its 6 π electrons therefore form a stable closed shell in a regular hexagonal molecule.

However for cyclobutadiene or cyclooctatrene with regular geometries, the highest molecular orbital pair is occupied by only 2 π electrons forming a less stable open shell. The molecules therefore stabilize by geometrical distortions which separate the degenerate orbital energies so that the last two electrons occupy the same orbital, but the molecule as a whole is less stable in the presence of such a distortion.

==Heteroatoms==
Hückel&#x27;s rule can also be applied to molecules containing other atoms such as nitrogen or oxygen. For example, pyridine (C5H5N) has a ring structure similar to benzene, except that one -CH- group is replaced by a nitrogen atom with no hydrogen. There are still six π electrons and the pyridine molecule is also aromatic and known for its stability.

==Polycyclic hydrocarbons==
Hückel&#x27;s rule is not valid for many compounds containing more than one ring. For example, pyrene and trans-bicalicene contain 16 conjugated electrons (8 bonds), and coronene contains 24 conjugated electrons (12 bonds). Both of these polycyclic molecules are aromatic, even though they fail the 4&quot;n&quot; + 2 rule. Indeed, Hückel&#x27;s rule can only be theoretically justified for monocyclic systems.

==Three-dimensional rule==

In 2000, Andreas Hirsch and coworkers in Erlangen, Germany, formulated a rule to determine when a spherical compound will be aromatic. They found that closed-shell compounds were aromatic when they had 2(&quot;n&quot; + 1)2 π-electrons, for instance the buckminsterfullerene species C6010+.

In 2011, Jordi Poater and Miquel Solà expanded the rule to open-shell spherical compounds, finding they were aromatic when they had 2&quot;n&quot;2 + 2&quot;n&quot; + 1 π-electrons, with spin S = (n + 1/2) - corresponding to a half-filled last occupied energy level with the same spin. For instance C601– is also observed to be aromatic with a spin of 11/2.

<doc id="862363" wikidata="Q713679" url="?curid=862363" title="Timotheus (general)">
<text>Timotheus (; died 354 BC) was a Greek statesman and general who sought to revive Athenian imperial ambitions by making Athens dominant in a Second Athenian League. He was the son of the Athenian general, Conon. Isocrates considered that Timotheus was superior to the other commanders of his time and showed all the requisites and abilities of a good general.

==Strategos==
From 378 BC to 356 BC, Timotheus frequently held command as &quot;strategos&quot; in the wars between Athens (in alliance with Thebes), and Sparta. At this time, Athens&#x27; ambition was to revive the Delian League and to regain command of the sea. In 375 BC, during the Boeotian War, Timotheus was sent with a fleet to sail round Peloponnesus by way of a demonstration of Athens&#x27; power against Sparta. He persuaded Cephallenia to side with Athens and secured the friendship of the Acarnanians and Molossians. In 373 BC, Timotheus was appointed to the command of a fleet for the relief of Corcyra, then beleaguered by the Spartans, but his ships were not fully manned, and to increase their manpower he cruised in the Aegean. The delay upset the Athenians, who brought him to trial; but, thanks to the intervention of his allies – Jason, tyrant of Pherae, and Alcetas I of Epirus, King of the Molossians, both of whom went to Athens to plead his cause he was acquitted. In way of support, Amyntas, King of Macedon, sent timber to Timeotheus&#x27; house in the Piraeus. Upon his acquittal, he went to sea with his fleet and captured Corcyra and then defeated the Spartans at sea off Alyzia (Acarnania). However, with little money to his name—for he had used his own funds to build up the Athenian fleet—he left Athens and took service with the king of Persia as a mercenary.

==Asia Minor==
Having returned to Athens, in 366 BC he was sent to support Ariobarzanes, satrap of Phrygia. But, finding that the satrap was in open rebellion against Persia (Revolt of the Satraps), Timotheus, in line with his instructions, abstained from helping him and rather used his army against Samos, then occupied by a Persian garrison, and took it after a ten months&#x27; siege (366 BC-365 BC). He then took Sestus, Crithote, Torone, Potidaea, Methone, Pydna and many other cities; but two attempts to capture Amphipolis failed.

==Court case==
An action was brought against him by Apollodorus, the son of the banker Pasion, for the return of money lent by his father. The speech for the plaintiff is still extant, and is attributed to Demosthenes (see also Pseudo-Demosthenes). It is interesting as it describes the manner in which Timotheus had exhausted the large fortune inherited from his father and the straits to which he was reduced by his sacrifices in the public cause.

==Social War==
In 358 BC or 357 BC, an Athenian force, in response to a spirited appeal from Timotheus, crossed over to Euboea and expelled the Thebans in three days. In the course of the Social War Timotheus was dispatched with Iphicrates, Menestheus, son of Iphicrates, and Chares to put down the revolt. The hostile fleets sighted each other in the Hellespont; but a gale was blowing, and Iphicrates and Timotheus decided not to engage. Chares, disregarding the advice of his colleagues, lost many ships.

==Final years==
In his dispatches after the battle, Chares complained so bitterly about Iphicrates and Timotheus that the Athenians put them on their trial. The accusers were Chares and Aristophon. Iphicrates, who had fewer enemies than Timotheus, was acquitted; but Timotheus, who had always been disliked for his perceived arrogance, was condemned to pay a very heavy fine. Being unable to pay, he withdrew to Chalcis, where he died soon afterwards. The Athenians later showed their sorrow over the treatment of Timotheus by forgiving the greater part of the fine that had passed onto his son Conon to pay. Timotheus was buried in the Ceramicus and statues were erected to his memory in the Agora and the Acropolis.

==Reputation==
Timotheus inspired much jealousy among his rivals, his reputation somewhat tarnished by the record of his final years. Aelian sums up much of the negative perception of Timotheus&#x27; generalship: &quot;Note that the Athenian general Timotheus was reckoned to be fortunate. People said fortune was responsible, and Timotheus had no part in it. They ridiculed him on the stage, and painters portrayed him asleep, with Tyche (Fortune) hovering above his head and pulling the cities into her net.&quot; This commentary is balanced by the credible picture (presented by Isocrates) of a skilled and cautious general, magnanimous victor and low-key diplomat.

<doc id="862374" wikidata="Q4340240" url="?curid=862374" title="Gueorgui Otyrba">
<text>Gueorgui Otyrba is an Abkhazian politician and academic. He was the first Human Rights Commissioner of Abkhazia between 2007 and 2016 and acting Foreign Affairs Minister between June and July 2004.

==Education and career==

Otyrba studied history at the Institute of History and Archives in Moscow, receiving his first degree in 1984, as well as a second degree from the Institute of General History in 1990. He was appointed as a Professor in the Department of Modern History at Abkhazian State University in the same year, and through the early 1990s, served as a visiting scholar in a number of universities around the world, including Johns Hopkins University and Maryland University in the United States and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel, often dealing in topics associated with the civil war in his homeland.

These experiences saw Otyrba take an interest in foreign policy, and in 1996, he underwent a course in mediation and human rights monitoring in Austria. He became involved in trying to establish dialogue between the two sides, and in 1997, was appointed Deputy Foreign Minister of Abkhazia. In the same year, he became Director of the Civil Society Development Centre a non-government organization based in the city of Gagra, a position which he held for approximately a year. Otyrba continued to both work in academia and serve as Deputy Foreign Minister for several years, and when long-serving Foreign Minister Sergey Shamba resigned to run in the 2004 elections, Otyrba was a natural choice to fill in as a temporary replacement. However, the position only lasted for two months before he was replaced by Igor Akhba on 28 July 2004., and Otyrba has since returned to his prior roles.

In his capacity of acting Foreign Minister, Otyrba headed the Abkhazian delegation to the meeting on repatriation of refugees held 20 July 2004 in Sochi.

On 3 March 2007, Otyrba was appointed the first Commissioner for Human Rights of Abkhazia under the President of Abkhazia by Sergei Bagapsh.
Following the adoption of a law constituting a new, independent, Human Rights Commissioner, the old office under the President was abolished and Otyrba was formally dismissed by Raul Khajimba on 4 May 2016.

Otyrba is a native speaker of Abkhaz and Russian, speaks English fluently, and is also competent in Italian.

<text>The University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) is a public research university in Huntsville, Alabama, United States. The university is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and comprises eight colleges: arts, humanities &amp; social sciences; business; education; engineering; honors; nursing; science; and graduate. The university&#x27;s enrollment is approximately 10,000. It is part of the University of Alabama System and is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity&quot;.

==History==

===Early history===
The genesis for a publicly funded institution of higher education in Huntsville was years in the making. Beginning in January 1950 as an extension of the University of Alabama and known as the University of Alabama Huntsville Center, classes were first taught at West Huntsville High School.

However, the university&#x27;s direction changed in 1961, when Wernher von Braun, a German rocket scientist brought to the United States under Operation Paperclip after working for the Nazi regime, helped create a research institute to provide advanced engineering and science curricula to NASA scientists and engineers. This institute was built right off US 72 which was renamed University Drive quickly after. Throughout the years, the campus expanded south along Sparkman Drive to reach Interstate 565.

===Autonomy===
UAH&#x27;s first undergraduate degrees were awarded in May 1968 as part of the spring commencement ceremony at The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, (although a &quot;cap and gown&quot; ceremony was held in Huntsville). One year later, the University of Alabama System Board of Trustees voted to make UAH an independent and autonomous campus. Benjamin Graves, a 1942 graduate of the University of Mississippi and president of Millsaps College in Jackson, Mississippi, was tapped as UAH&#x27;s first president in 1970. He returned to faculty status in 1979 and retired in 1989. The first degree awarded for work completed entirely on the UAH campus was awarded to Julian Palmore in 1964. Mr. Palmore was at the time a United States Navy ensign assigned to NASA&#x27;s Research Projects Division. The first official on-campus graduation ceremony at UAH was in June 1970. The first woman to earn a Ph.D. from UAH was Virginia Kobler in 1979, in Industrial Engineering.

UAH&#x27;s second president, John Wright, former Vice Chancellor of the West Virginia University, served from 1979 to 1988. UAH&#x27;s third president was Louis Padulo, former Stanford professor and dean of engineering of Boston University. Huntsville leader Joseph Moquin took over the UAH presidency on an interim basis in 1990. Frank Franz, who was then provost at West Virginia University, was chosen as UAH&#x27;s fourth president. His wife, Judy Franz, accompanied him and was granted full professorship in the physics faculty. Her renown in the scientific community was reaffirmed when she was named executive officer of the American Physical Society in 1994.

===2000s to present===
At the beginning of the 2006–2007 academic year, Franz announced his plan to step down as president after that year. On July 1, 2007, David B. Williams, formerly a professor of materials science and engineering and the vice provost for research at Lehigh University, began serving as UAH&#x27;s fifth president. He left in 2011 to join Ohio State University as dean of engineering.

Robert Altenkirch was hired as the university&#x27;s sixth president in September 2011. Altenkirch served as president of the New Jersey Institute of Technology for nine years before joining UAH. In 2019, Darren Dawson, former dean of the College of Engineering at Kansas State University, became UAH&#x27;s seventh president. Dawson announced his retirement in November 2021, and Charles L. Karr, former dean of the University of Alabama&#x27;s College of Engineering, was named interim president. In September 2022, Karr was named president.

===Mass shooting===

The university briefly gained national attention in February 2010 when a professor killed three people and wounded three others during a faculty meeting.

==Academics==

UAH offers 89 degree-granting programs, including 44 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs, 30 master&#x27;s degree programs, and 15 PhD programs through its eight colleges: arts, humanities &amp; social sciences; business; education; engineering; honors; nursing; science; and graduate. Nursing is UAH&#x27;s largest single major, although Engineering is the largest college. There is also an Honors College that offers an enriched academic and community experience for undergraduates in all disciplines.

Not surprisingly given Huntsville&#x27;s technology-based economy, UAH is known for engineering and science programs, including astrophysics, atmospheric science, aerospace engineering, cybersecurity, and digital animation. The first &quot;commercial&quot; non-rocketry programs (Consort and Joust) in the U.S. were managed by UAH scientists, the first &quot;high-temperature&quot; superconductor was discovered at UAH, and the first U.S. experiment flown aboard the Soviet Mir Space Station was from UAH. UAH is a Space Grant university and has a history of cooperation with NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center and the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command at Redstone Arsenal. In conjunction with helping NASA reach its goals, UAH makes NASA&#x27;s research and technology available to all of Alabama&#x27;s colleges and universities. The National Space Science and Technology Center is one of 17 high-tech research centers on UAH 505-acre campus.

The UAH Propulsion Research Center (PRC) promotes interdisciplinary research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. The PRC was founded by Dr. Clark W. Hawk in 1991 and has since provided support for NASA, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and the U.S. Department of Energy. Research topics include air-breathing and electric propulsion; solid, liquid &amp; hybrid propellant combustion; magnetoinertial fusion; high-temperature materials; and space and terrestrial power systems.

Research in nanotechnology and microfabrication is conducted by the Nano and Micro Devices Center.

Atmospheric Sciences and related research areas are headquartered in the NSSTC and SWIRLL buildings.

At least nine departments or programs also hold accreditation from professional associations, including the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, the American Chemical Society, the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, the Computing Sciences Accreditation Board, The National Association of Schools of Art and Design, and the National Association of Schools of Music.

==Rankings==
UAH ranked 263rd among &quot;National Universities&quot; and No. 128 for &quot;Top Public Schools&quot; in the 2020 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; &quot;Best Colleges&quot; report.

==Athletics==

UAH sponsors six men&#x27;s and seven women&#x27;s varsity athletics programs. In 2016, UAH added men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse to its varsity athletic programs. UAH is a member of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA), competing in Division II in 15 sports. UAH is a member of the Gulf South Conference in all sports except men&#x27;s lacrosse, which plays in the men&#x27;s lacrosse (Peach Belt Conference).

Both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis programs were discontinued in June 2020 due to financial difficulties from COVID-19. After a privately funded 2020–2021 season, the men&#x27;s hockey program was also discontinued in May 2021.

==Student life and activities==
===Student government===
The UAH Student Government Association is the primary recipient of student-activity funding from UAH&#x27;s Office of Student Life; the Space Hardware Club, a registered student organization in the College of Engineering is the secondary recipient. The SGA holds an advisory role with campus administrators on activities involving students. The SGA hosts a number of events including Week of Welcome, a bi-annual event welcoming students back to campus that begins the weekend they arrive on campus and runs through the first week of each semester.

===Residence halls===
UAH has seven residence halls: Bevill Center, Central Campus, Charger Village Addition, Charger Village Original, Frank Franz, North Campus, and Southeast. Central Campus, Frank Franz, and North are reserved for first-time freshmen. Frank Franz Hall is reserved for First time Honors College students. Charger Village Addition and Charger Village Original are reserved for sophomores, whereas upperclass students have the option of living at the other residence halls.

Campus housing originated with the construction of Southeast Campus Housing. These suites were originally built under the auspices of the late Dr. Benjamin Graves, the first President of UAH, with the assistance of the late Alabama Senator John Sparkman.

===Greek life===
UAH is home to several fraternities and sororities. Most Greek organizations rent a fraternity or sorority house from the university. Construction of the original houses was made possible by donations from Mark and Linda Smith and Jim and Susie Hudson.

===ACE===
The Association for Campus Entertainment (ACE) is a student run and operated organization that hosts weekly events throughout the academic year as well as standing programs such as Friday Night Flicks, Sunday Cinema, Late-Night Breakfast, and ACE Wednesday. Notable guests include Daniel Tosh and Recycled Percussion.

===Clubs and organizations===
UAH has more than 150 student-run organizations on campus. Team UAH has won several concrete canoe construction competitions with five national titles in 1993, 1994, 1996, 1998, and 2001. The National Concrete Canoe Competition is sponsored annually by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The UAH American Society of Mechanical Engineers student chapter also competes in the annual NASA Human Exploration Rover Challenge. It holds two championship titles. The UAH Space Hardware Club conceptualizes, designs, builds, tests, and flies hardware for high-altitude balloons, satellites (ChargerSat Program), the CanSat competition, and high-powered rocketry.

===Student Success Center===
The Student Success Center (SSC) offers tutoring for nearly all freshman- and sophomore-level courses offered at UAH. Additional tutoring is available for math courses online and in person.

The SSC recruits university students for its PASS (Peer Assisted Study Sessions) program, in which students sit in on courses that they have already succeeded in, and offers class-specific study sessions outside of class, usually 3 hours per week. Historically difficult freshman courses are targeted for PASS, including calculus, chemistry, and economics.

<doc id="862386" wikidata="Q339524" url="?curid=862386" title="Dodge 400">
<text>The Dodge 400 was a mid-size car built by Dodge. It was similar to the Chrysler LeBaron of the same era. The 400 was introduced for the 1982 model year but renamed and merged into the Dodge 600 lineup just two years later. An improved version of Chrysler&#x27;s K-cars, it was called the Super K platform.

==Design==
While heavily dependent on the K-car, the suspension geometry was revised with computer-aided design (CAD), one of Chrysler&#x27;s first forays into this area. Aside from the suspension modifications, the interior was plusher and the front and rear designs were different. To provide higher comfort than in the regular K-cars, particular care was paid to sound proofing, with a redesigned firewall and additional isolating material throughout.

Aside from the stacked-slat grille being different from that of the LeBaron, the 400 was somewhat less ornate overall. Faux louvres on the front fenders were unique to the 400.

==Model years==
===1982===
The 400 was intended to be a more upmarket version of the Aries and a corporate twin of the downsized LeBaron. It was originally only available as a two-door coupé. In the spring of 1982 two additional bodystyles appeared: a convertible and a four-door sedan. The 400&#x27;s suspension, while soft, was somewhat firmer than that of its LeBaron sister.

This was Dodge&#x27;s first convertible since the 1971 Challenger and one of the first domestically-manufactured convertibles since 1976, when Cadillac had phased out the Eldorado convertible.

The 400 was available in two trim levels: base and LS. Engine choices were limited to a 2.2 L inline-four engine or an optional Mitsubishi-sourced 2.6 L &quot;Silent Shaft&quot; four-cylinder; this was only available coupled to an automatic. The convertible came with the Mitsubishi-sourced engine as standard. Outputs were respectively.

===1983===
There were no major changes made for 1983 other than the LS trim being omitted from the lineup. During 1983, the 400 sedan was replaced by the longer wheelbase Dodge 600. The coupes and convertibles remained on the shorter wheelbase but were rebadged as Dodge 600 from 1984.

<doc id="862394" wikidata="Q1088714" url="?curid=862394" title="Chrysler LeBaron">
<text>The Chrysler LeBaron is a line of automobiles built by Chrysler from 1931 to 1941 and from 1977 to 1995. Chrysler also used the LeBaron name for the Imperial LeBaron from 1957 to 1975.

The model was introduced in 1931, with a body manufactured by LeBaron, and competed with other luxury cars of the era, such as Lincoln and Packard. After purchasing LeBaron with its parent Briggs Manufacturing Company, Chrysler introduced the luxury make Imperial in 1955, and sold automobiles under the name Imperial LeBaron from 1957 until 1975. Chrysler discontinued the Imperial brand for 1976 and reintroduced the Chrysler LeBaron in 1977 to what was then Chrysler&#x27;s lowest-priced model.

The &quot;LeBaron&quot; name has since been applied to five different cars built by the Chrysler Division:
* 1977–1981 M-body (mid-size) LeBaron sedan, coupe, and wagon
* 1982–1988 K-body (mid-size) LeBaron sedan, coupe, convertible, and wagon
* 1985–1989 H-body (mid-size) LeBaron GTS hatchback
* 1987–1995 J-body (personal luxury) LeBaron coupe and convertible
* 1990–1994 AA-body (mid-size) LeBaron sedan
The last Chrysler LeBaron was produced in 1995, to be replaced with the Cirrus and Sebring. The LeBaron was one of Chrysler&#x27;s longest-running brands.

== The LeBaron background ==

LeBaron was one of the many prominent coachbuilders in the 1920s and 1930s to provide bodies for luxury cars. It was founded in Bridgeport, Connecticut, in 1920 by Thomas L. Hibbard and Raymond H. Dietrich. It was later purchased by Briggs Manufacturing Company of Detroit in 1926, the major manufacturer of bodies for Ford, Chrysler, Hudson, Packard, and others, and operated as a Briggs specialist subsidiary.

LeBaron supplied exquisite custom bodies for various car companies such as Chrysler&#x27;s luxury Imperial line, Duesenberg, and Cadillac.
LeBaron&#x27;s last projects for Chrysler were the Chrysler Newport Phaeton, a super-streamlined dual cowl phaeton with an aluminum body, and the remarkable 1941 Chrysler Thunderbolt, a sleek roadster with concealed headlights (like the 1936 Cord 810/812) and a retractable metal hardtop styled by Alex Tremulis, who would later style the legendary Tucker of 1948.

Chrysler purchased Briggs Manufacturing Company in 1953.
Two years after the Chrysler Corporation introduced the Imperial as a separate luxury division, LeBaron was designated the top-of-the-line Imperial models in 1957 through 1975.
==Classic generation (1931–1941)==

The LeBarons started in the 1930s during the automobile&#x27;s Classic era and competed directly with the luxury brands of its day, such as Lincoln, Cadillac, and Packard. In the mid-1930s, Chrysler added a radical new &quot;Art Deco&quot; design shape, known as the Airflow Imperials, to the Chrysler line. LeBaron supplied the high-end CW series. The design features were considered advanced and perhaps ahead of their time. However, the shape was too radical for buyer&#x27;s tastes, and non-Airflow models outsold Airflows by about 3 to 1. Raymond Dietrich, co-founder and former stylist at LeBaron, was hired in 1932 to be Chrysler&#x27;s in-house stylist. Dietrich restyled the Airflow line and moved Chryslers to more mainstream styles. As a result of the poor Airflow sales, Chrysler&#x27;s designs became quite conservative for the next two decades. Auto manufacturers continued to build up their in-house styling departments and bodyworks. LeBaron thus became less important to most of its customers for design ideas and bodies. Toward the late 1930s, LeBaron/Briggs built more bodies for Chrysler and fewer for Ford. Chrysler became their biggest customer, with additional bodies built for Packard, Hudson, and Graham-Paige. During the late 1930s and early 1940s, the LeBaron name and division became less critical for Briggs, although it remained a division of Briggs until the Chrysler buy-out in 1953.

LeBaron&#x27;s last projects for Chrysler were two concept cars: the Chrysler Newport Phaeton, a super-streamlined dual cowl phaeton with an aluminum body, and the remarkable 1941 Chrysler Thunderbolt, a sleek roadster with concealed headlights and a retractable metal hardtop styled by Alex Tremulis, who went on to later style part of the legendary Tucker of 1948. Only 6 of each were made.

==Imperial generation (1955–1975)==

For the 1955 model year, Chrysler Corporation spun off Imperial as a separate make and division, its flagship luxury brand, taking its name from the original Chrysler Imperial series. Intended as a direct competitor for Cadillac, Lincoln, and Packard, Imperial was a completely distinct vehicle make/brand that did not use the Chrysler nameplate.

Through the existence of the division, Imperial used two nameplates alongside a nameless base model (Imperial Custom, from 1960–1963). Its mid-range line was the Imperial Crown, with the flagship line branded as the Imperial LeBaron (in deference to the coachbuilder); Southampton was a sub-designation applied for pillarless hardtop bodystyles.

In June 1975, Chrysler retired the Imperial brand in response to declining sales of the marque; the Imperial LeBaron was repackaged for 1976 as the Chrysler New Yorker Brougham.


==First generation (1977–1981)==


For 1977, the LeBaron returned, moving from Imperial to Chrysler. Introduced as a late model-year response to the Cadillac Seville and Lincoln Versailles, the Chrysler LeBaron was the first compact Chrysler ever produced. Effectively a new generation of the Dodge Aspen/Plymouth Volaré, the LeBaron was the inaugural model of the M platform (alongside the Dodge Diplomat). In contrast to the Seville and Versailles, the LeBaron was offered as both a two-door coupe and a four-door sedan, with a Town &amp; Country five-door station wagon added for 1978.

Though the LeBaron sedan and station wagon were visibly similar to the Volaré (which shared the wheelbase), they had different hoods, trunk lids, and front and rear header panels. The LeBaron coupe shared the same wheelbase as the sedan/wagon (4 inches longer than the F-body coupe), with a sleeker roofline. A Slant Six was the standard engine, with the or V8s optional. A three-speed Torqueflite automatic transmission was offered with all three engines, though a four-speed manual overdrive transmission was offered with the 225 and 318 engines through 1981.

For 1980, the LeBaron underwent an mid-cycle facelift. The exterior was styled with sharper-edged sheetmetal and restyled with a waterfall grille (similar to the 1974-1975 Imperial); the sedan roofline underwent aerodynamic revisions (no longer shared with the Volaré). The two-door moved to the shorter F-body wheelbase, also receiving aerodynamic enhancements to its rear sheetmetal. The interior underwent design upgrades to make the model line more luxurious. Chrysler introduced a limited-edition &quot;Fifth Avenue&quot; option package for the 1980 LeBaron four-door sedan. A conversion by American Sunroof Corporation, the Fifth Avenue featured a padded vinyl roof covering the quarter glass of the rear doors and interior trim upgrades.

Following the discontinuation of the Volaré for 1981, Chrysler introduced a police-equipment option package (keeping Chrysler-Plymouth dealers in competition for law enforcement fleet contracts); for 1982, the Plymouth Gran Fury was downsized to the M-body, directly replacing the Volaré. After the LeBaron was moved to the K platform for 1982, the M-platform remained in use until the end of the 1980s, supporting several Chrysler-brand nameplates (alongside the Dodge Diplomat and Plymouth Gran Fury).

(For 1979 and 1981, coupe and sedan production figures are not separated)

==Second generation (1982–1988)==
For 1982, the LeBaron moved to the front-wheel drive Chrysler K platform, where it was the upscale brand&#x27;s lowest-priced offering. It was initially available in just sedan and coupe versions. In early 1982, it was released in a convertible version, bringing to the market the first factory-built open-topped domestic vehicle since the 1976 Cadillac Eldorado.

A station wagon version called the Town and Country was also added. A unique Town and Country convertible was also made from 1983 until 1986 with a 1,105 total produced, which, like the wagon, featured simulated wood paneling that made it resemble the original 1940s Town and Country. This model was part of the well-equipped Mark Cross option package for the latter years.

Despite being mechanically similar to the Aries and Reliant, its fascias closely resembled the larger E-body sedans. This generation featured Chrysler&#x27;s Electronic Voice Alert, a computerized voice that warned drivers about various conditions with phrases such as &quot;A door is ajar&quot; or &quot;Your engine oil pressure is low&quot;.

The LeBaron was facelifted for 1986, receiving rounder front and rear ends to improve aerodynamics. A landau padded top replaced the sedan&#x27;s full vinyl roof. The instrumentation cluster was revised from a rectangle speedometer and fuel gauge with a message center to round gauges similar to the Reliant/Aries but with an argent surround for a more upscale appearance. Coupes and convertibles were dropped for 1987, replaced by the all-new J-body LeBaron released that year. The sedan and wagon continued with minor changes until 1988. A new digital dashboard replaced the analog gauges for a more modern appearance. A larger LeBaron sedan based on the Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim would arrive for the 1990 model year.

===1985–1989 LeBaron GTS===

The 1985 LeBaron GTS was a somewhat different car than the standard LeBaron and was based on the Chrysler H platform. It was available at the same time as the Cadillac Cimarron as a luxury-brand model while offering a similar level of equipment to the small Cadillac. As a 5-door hatchback still derived from the K-car, the GTS (and the similar Dodge Lancer) was more of a performance vehicle than the softer-tuned K-car LeBaron sedan. In base configuration, the car was powered by Chrysler&#x27;s 2.2 liter inline-4 engine, later replaced by a 2.5 L TBI version generating . A turbocharged 2.2 L engine producing was also available. The GTS moniker was dropped for 1989, the final year of this vehicle&#x27;s production, after the K-based LeBaron sedan was discontinued after 1988.

===Trim levels===
* &quot;High Line&quot; - 1985–1989
* &quot;Premium&quot; - 1985–1988
* &quot;GTS&quot; - 1989 (replaced &quot;Premium&quot; after the &quot;GTS&quot; was dropped from the name of the car)
* &quot;Pacifica&quot; 1986 (replaced by Shelby Lancer in 1987) Limited 500 run
Production Figures:
===European market - the Chrysler GTS===
After some years of absence, Chrysler officially started offering some models under its brand on the European market from April 1988. One of them was the &quot;Chrysler GTS&quot;, which was a rebadged version of the Dodge Lancer ES. Sales figures were moderate.
== Third generation coupe/convertible (1987–1995) ==
After discontinuing the first generation LeBaron coupe and convertible in 1986, Chrysler released a new LeBaron for 1987, built on the J platform (a K platform derivative) and available as a coupe or convertible. The all-new LeBaron looked modern and aerodynamic compared to its boxy predecessor and was quite stylish for its day, featuring headlights hidden behind retractable metal covers and a waterfall grille, steeply raked windshield, full-width taillight lenses though only the edges lit up, and curved (Coke bottle) style rocker panels. The LeBaron was equipped with a trip and fuel economy computer as well as full instrumentation. In Mexico, these models were marketed as the Chrysler Phantom. The available engines were the stock 2.2-liter and 2.5-liter, naturally aspirated or turbocharged, and for the 1990 model year, a 3.0-liter Mitsubishi V6 became available, although the Mexican Chrysler Phantom R/T DOHC 16V also offered the same 2.2-liter turbo engine as used in the U.S. market Dodge Spirit R/T.
For 1990, the LeBaron&#x27;s interior was refreshed, featuring an all new dashboard, gauge cluster, door panels, and center console design. All of the new components were designed to be smoother and more flowing than the comparatively boxy 1987-89 interior style, making it more in tune with the &quot;aero&quot; revolution of the early 1990s. The 1992 LeBaron coupes and convertibles could be ordered with a new &quot;sport package&quot;, which featured a monochrome appearance including body-colored grille, accent stripe, and decklid logo. The package also included 14-inch &quot;lace&quot; style wheelcovers and a black strip below the taillights in place of chrome, with special blacked-out window moldings on coupe models.

===1993 Facelift===


In 1992 for the 1993 model year, the LeBaron received a slight facelift. The hidden headlamps of the 1987-1992 models were deleted in favor of less costly flush-mounted replaceable-bulb headlamps, new wheel styles were made available, and all models got the amber rear turn signals introduced on the deluxe 1992 models. For 1994, a passenger side airbag became standard on all models. Also new for 1994 was the &quot;Bright LX&quot; decor package which included a &quot;bright&quot; chrome grille, &quot;bright&quot; chrome badging, and &quot;bright&quot; chrome molding inserts, as opposed to being body-colored on the GTC.

The available engines were a naturally aspirated 2.5 L and a turbocharged 2.2 and 2.5 L versions of Chrysler&#x27;s inline-four, and the 3.0 L Mitsubishi V6 making a in this application. The turbocharged engines were dropped from the lineup in 1992 for the 1993 model year. The coupe was discontinued after 1993. For the last two model years, the 3.0 was the only available engine. The convertible was discontinued after 1995, to make way for the new Chrysler Sebring coupes and convertibles, for 1995 and 1996 respectively.

===Trim levels: 1987–1995===

Throughout its lifetime, the LeBaron convertible/coupe was available in many trim levels. For its first year, the LeBaron was available in &quot;Highline&quot; and &quot;Premium&quot;, typical Chrysler trims at the time. The number of trims grew, peaking in 1990, with six available. After that, the number decreased until just two trim levels remained for 1995.

* 1987: Highline, Premium
* 1988: Highline, Premium, GT
* 1989: GTS Turbo, GT Turbo, GTC Turbo, Highline, Premium
* 1990: GT, GT Turbo, GTC Turbo, Highline, Highline Turbo, Premium
* 1991: GTC, GTC Turbo, Highline, Highline Turbo, Premium LX
* 1992: GTC, GTC Turbo, Highline, Highline Turbo, LX
* 1993: GTC, Highline, LX
* 1994: GTC, LX
* 1995: GTC, LX

===Export===
The LeBaron coupe/convertible was part of Chrysler&#x27;s export push and was regularly available across Europe. Springs and shocks were somewhat firmer on European-market cars. The initial European lineup was made up of the naturally aspirated 2.5 and the turbocharged 2.2; both were offered with a 5-speed manual or a 3-speed automatic. Power is respectively. In mid-1988, the turbocharged 2.2 was partially replaced by the 2.5 Turbo, with power slightly lower at . The 2.2 Turbo received an intercooler, which boosted maximum power to . Called the LeBaron GTC, it was not offered with the automatic. Both turbo versions were discontinued during 1989; the 2.5 Turbo returned (only with the five-speed manual transmission) some time during 1990. The new version produces at 4700 rpm, but it was discontinued yet again in 1991. The 3.0-liter Mitsubishi V6 engine was introduced to European buyers in mid-1989, and was only available with the four-speed automatic. It produces somewhat less power than the American models; at 5200 rpm. The top speed was and the sprint took 10.8 seconds. After the 2.5 Turbo was discontinued in 1991, the V6 remained the only regular option until the LeBaron Coupé/Convertible ended European sales in mid-1994.

===Racing===
Several ARCA (one tier down from &quot;NASCAR&quot; cup racing) teams built &quot;LeBaron&quot; based race cars (supported by a revitalized &quot;Chrysler&quot; Direct Connection performance parts division) and ran them from 1988 until 1998.

==Third generation sedan (1990–1994)==

The last LeBaron sedan was built on the front wheel drive AA platform, another K derivative, as junior level sedan to the more upscale New Yorker. It offered rebadged versions under the Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim nameplates, and the three differed mostly in detail and trim choices, as well as the European Chrysler Saratoga.

Theoretically, as historically was the case in this era versus its Dodge and Plymouth corporate siblings, the LeBaron was marketed as the luxury version, reflecting the Chrysler brand&#x27;s flagship status. In reality, however, there was considerable overlap amongst the three in available trim, equipment and features. Launched in a single trim, the top-line LeBaron Landau model offered a padded vinyl half-roof with smaller &quot;formal&quot; backlight, as well as unique button-tufted bench seats. All LeBaron sedans came with a standard driver&#x27;s side airbag, and could seat up to six passengers.

Due to Chrysler&#x27;s efforts to refocus the Plymouth brand at the value end and to expand the Chrysler brand&#x27;s sales, for 1992 the Plymouth Acclaim would lose its mid-range LE and top-line LX trims. They were instead added to the LeBaron lineup as the base and LX trims, below the former standard trim, which was now called Landau. The LX, which retained the Acclaim&#x27;s taillights instead of the LeBaron&#x27;s full-width treatment was available for 1992 only, and now the only model to feature the V6 as standard. For 1993, the LeBaron sedan received new rear lights, which incorporated the reversing lamps previously located in the bumper fascia. Trim levels were reduced to just the base model, renamed LE, and the luxury Landau. The LeBaron sedan was discontinued on May 18, 1994, while the Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim continued production until December 21, 1994. The Chrysler LeBaron was replaced by the &quot;Cloud Car&quot; Chrysler Cirrus.

===Safety===
In 1994, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration rated the LeBaron a 4 out of 5 for driver side and a 3 out of 5 for passenger side frontal impact occupant protection.

===Trim levels===
* base - 1990–1992
* &quot;LX&quot; - 1992
* &quot;Landau&quot; - 1992–1994
* &quot;LE&quot; - 1993–1994

==Mexican market==
M and K-platform cars were assembled in the Toluca, Mexico facility. The M-platform LeBaron was sold in Mexico from the 1977 to the 1982 model years. The K-car LeBaron was also produced in Toluca and was sold for the 1983 through 1987 model years. There were no K-platform convertibles offered from the factory.

Chrysler Phantom was the Mexican-market version of the J-Body LeBaron Coupe. There were no convertibles of the J-body 2-door for the Mexican market. Phantoms were Chrysler&#x27;s top-of-the-line model in Mexico and generally sold with a higher trim level than their United States counterparts; the Phantom was also only ever available with the more powerful, turbocharged engines. Chrysler Phantoms were marketed from 1987 until 1994, with the first cars delivered in December 1986. A more powerful R/T version (similar to the American LeBaron GTC but using a higher-tuned turbo engine) was also available in 1992 and 1993. The Phantom R/T originally received the 2.5-liter Turbo II engine, coupled to a three-speed automatic, but this was quickly changed to the Turbo III engine with a five-speed Getrag manual transmission.

The Mexican AA-body Chrysler LeBaron 4-door sedan was called the New Yorker (all of them with Landau roof), and the &quot;K&quot; body (slightly shorter) was reserved for the 4-door LeBaron&#x27;s, which were sold in two trim levels, one with Landau roof and leather, and the other one without those two options.

<doc id="862396" wikidata="Q3245936" url="?curid=862396" title="Pioche, Nevada">
<text>Pioche () is an unincorporated town in Lincoln County, Nevada, United States, approximately northeast of Las Vegas. U.S. Route 93 is the main route to Pioche and bypasses the town center just to the east, with Nevada State Route 321 and Nevada State Route 322 providing direct access. Pioche is the county seat of Lincoln County. Pioche is named after François Louis Alfred Pioche, a San Francisco financier and land speculator originally from France. The town&#x27;s population was 1,002 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
The first modern settlement of the area occurred in 1864 with the opening of a silver mine. The settlers abandoned the area when local Indian tribes launched a series of raids and massacres. Recolonization was launched in 1868, after the Indian raids were stopped and François Pioche bought the town in 1869. By the early 1870s, Pioche had grown larger, to become one of the most important silver-mining towns in Nevada. Because of the town&#x27;s remoteness which had earlier allowed the Indian raids to occur, Pioche had a reputation for being one of the roughest towns in the Old West.

Due mostly to confusion over the exact location of mining claims, mine owners finally resorted to hiring guards. In 1872, Tom and Ed Newland hired gunmen to take over the very profitable mine owned by William H. Raymond and John Ely. They in turn hired four more men who during a raid in the middle of the night killed one of the guards and drove off the remainder. One of the four hired gunmen, Michael Casey, killed miner Tom Gossen after refusing to pay interest on a $100 loan. Before he died the next day, Gossen left a $5,000 reward to the man who killed Casey. Jim Leavy swore Casey had not shot Gossen in self defense, and Casey challenged Leavy to get his gun. The two men met in front of Felsenthal&#x27;s store. Leavy shot Casey and then beat him to death with his pistol. Leavy in turn was wounded by David Neagle, who shot Leavy through the cheeks, leaving him permanently disfigured.

It was reported that nearly 60 percent of the homicides reported in Nevada during 1871–72 took place in and around Pioche. Local lore says 72 men were killed in gunfights before the first natural death occurred in the camp. This legend is immortalized by the creation of Boot Hill, now a landmark in the city.

==Climate==
Pioche has a cool semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;) bordering on a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;/&quot;Dsa&quot;) due to its high altitude and exposure to rain-bearing winds. The high elevation means summers are much cooler than in Clark County, with temperatures of reached upon only one afternoon every five years, and reached only upon 23.1 afternoons. The hottest month recorded was July 2005, with a mean maximum of , a record hot day of on July 17, and nine days above the century mark from July 11 to 19. Although summers are mostly dry with mild nights, it is not unknown for “Arizona rains” to penetrate into Lincoln County during July and August, as happened in August 1945 when of rain fell on a total of eleven “wet” days, and during August 1955 when seventeen days saw at least of rain.

The fall season sees warm days and cold nights: the freeze-free period usually extends from May 17 to October 10, although temperatures below are very rare even during winter with an average of 1.1 mornings falling this low; the coldest temperature in Pioche has been on January 12, 1963. The coldest month has been January 1949 with a mean maximum of , although in a normal winter only 10.3 afternoons will not top freezing. During the winter, days are cool to cold – although even in January 7.1 afternoons top – and nights are very cold, although snowfall is extremely erratic. During the very wet and cold spell of January and February 1993, of snow fell in Pioche; however, in warm, dry winters like 1999/2000, almost no snow may occur.


==Landmarks and attractions==

Pioche is known for its &quot;Million Dollar Courthouse,&quot; built in 1872. The original cost of $88,000 far exceeded initial estimates and was financed, and refinanced with bonds totaling nearly $1 million. Pioche currently contains the county administrative offices and has one of the oldest grade schools in the state.

Two historic theaters site side by side on a hill overlooking downtown. Thompson&#x27;s Opera House was built in 1873 and restored in 2009 while the Gem Theater was built in 1937 and ongoing restoration began in 2022.

Next door to the courthouse sits the old Mountain View Hotel, where President Herbert Hoover is said to have stayed in 1930. Built in 1895, the hotel served the lodging needs of dignitaries visiting Pioche on court business. Although the building no longer serves as a hotel, it is an example of turn-of-the-century western architecture. There is another hotel, the Overland, which is still operating, with 14 themed rooms on the second floor over the main saloon.

An aerial tramway carried buckets of ore from the mines to the Godbe Mill. The tramway ran during the 1920s and 1930s and was used for the transportation of silver and nickel ore. The abandoned tramway used cables which still stretch over parts of the town, with some original ore buckets intact.

During Labor Day in September, the population swells for events including fireworks, history-based theater and mining car filling contests called &quot;mucking events.&quot; In December, the town holds a public Christmas tree lighting.

The town of Pioche is Nevada Historical Marker 5.

<text>Múm (stylized in lowercase) () is an Icelandic indietronica band whose music is characterized by soft vocals, electronic glitch beats and effects, and a variety of traditional and unconventional instruments.

== History ==
The band was formed in 1997 by original members Gunnar Örn Tynes and Örvar Þóreyjarson Smárason, who were joined by twin sisters Gyða and Kristín Anna Valtýsdóttir. According to Kristín, the band&#x27;s name was not intended to mean anything. Gyða left the band to return to her studies after the release of &quot;Finally We Are No One&quot;. In early 2006, Kristín also left the band, although it was not officially announced until 23 November of that year. With only Tynes and Smárason remaining in the group, a large group of new musicians were brought on board: guitarist/vocalist/violinist Ólöf Arnalds, trumpet/keyboard player Eiríkur Orri Ólafsson, vocalist/cellist Hildur Guðnadóttir, percussionist Samuli Kosminen, and multi-instrumentalist/vocalist Mr. Silla. The new collective of musicians recorded their fourth album during 2006; &quot;Go Go Smear the Poison Ivy&quot; was released on 24 September 2007.

Múm toured the East Coast of the US with German musician Volker &quot;Hauschka&quot; Bertelmann In November 2007. They returned in Spring 2008 with the same set list. Both tours included songs from the album, &quot;Go, Go Smear the Poison Ivy&quot;.

On 27 August 2008, they announced on their official website that &quot;múm is quietly but surely [working on] their new album. No release date has been etched in stone, but every day will bring it closer.&quot; Múm also released several pictures of themselves during the recording process on their MySpace page.

During a 22 May 2009 concert in Burgos, Spain, Múm played songs from their newest album &quot;Sing Along to Songs You Don&#x27;t Know&quot;. The album, recorded in Finland, Estonia, and Iceland, was released as a download through Gogoyoko on 17 August 2009, and on CD on 24 August 2009.

In December 2011, Múm released an EP called &quot;Gleðileg Jól&quot; (Merry Christmas in Icelandic) with traditional Icelandic Christmas songs. There are two songs plus one extra track.

On 1 June 2012, Múm released a compilation titled &quot;Early Birds&quot;, featuring 15 tracks recorded between 1998 and 2000. On 9 February 2013, a collaboration of theirs with Kylie Minogue called &quot;Whistle&quot; surfaced on SoundCloud.

Múm released their sixth album &quot;Smilewound&quot; in September, 2013 on CD, vinyl and digital download. On 7 September, it was released on cassette for Cassette Store Day.

In 2019, Morr Music celebrated the 20th anniversary of múm&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Yesterday Was Dramatic – Today Is OK&quot;, by rereleasing it. Múm toured around Europe and China following this rerelease, and also announced a US tour that was to take place in March and April 2020.

<text>The last voyage of the &quot;Karluk&quot;, flagship of the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913–16, ended with the loss of the ship in the Arctic seas, and the subsequent deaths of nearly half her complement of 25.

In August 1913, &quot;Karluk&quot;, a brigantine formerly used as a whaler, became trapped in the ice while sailing to a rendezvous point at Herschel Island. After a long drift across the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, in January 1914 the ship was crushed and sank. In the ensuing months, the crew and expedition staff struggled to survive, first on the ice and later on the shores of Wrangel Island. In all, eleven men died before rescue.

The Canadian Arctic Expedition was organised under the leadership of Canadian anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and had both scientific and geographic purposes. Shortly after &quot;Karluk&quot; was trapped, Stefansson left the ship with a small party, claiming that he intended to hunt for caribou. The ice then carried &quot;Karluk&quot; westwards. Upon reaching land Stefansson devoted himself to the expedition&#x27;s scientific objectives, leaving the crew and staff on board the ship to their own devices under the charge of its captain, Robert Bartlett. After the sinking, Bartlett organised a march across the ice to Wrangel Island, away. Conditions were difficult and dangerous; two four-man parties were lost before the island was reached.

From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk companion, Kataktovik, set out across the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances; 14 were rescued.

Historians have divided views on Stefansson&#x27;s decision to leave the ship. Some of the voyage&#x27;s survivors were critical of his seeming indifference to their ordeal and the loss of their comrades. He escaped official censure, and was publicly honoured for his later work on the expedition despite the Canadian government&#x27;s reservations about its overall management. Although Bartlett was criticised by an admiralty commission for taking &quot;Karluk&quot; into the ice, he was hailed as a hero by the public and by his former &quot;Karluk&quot; shipmates.

==Canadian Arctic Expedition==

===Background===

The Canadian Arctic Expedition was the brainchild of Vilhjalmur Stefansson, a US-based, Canadian-born anthropologist of Icelandic extraction who had spent most of the years between 1906 and 1912 studying Inuit life in the remote Arctic Canada. His fieldwork had resulted in the first detailed information on the life and culture of the Copper Inuit, the so-called &quot;blond Eskimos&quot;. Stefansson had returned home with plans for another expedition to continue his Arctic studies, and obtained promises of financial backing totalling US$45,000 (around US$750,000 in 2010) from the National Geographic Society (NGS) in Washington and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. However, he wanted to extend his plans to include geographical exploration in the Beaufort Sea, then a blank space on the world&#x27;s maps. For these expanded aims he needed more money, and approached the Canadian government for assistance.

The area known as the &quot;High Arctic&quot; was subject to claims of sovereignty not only from Canada, but also from Norway and the United States. The Canadian government was concerned that an American-financed expedition would give the United States a legal claim to any new land discovered in the Beaufort Sea, so when the Canadian prime minister Robert Borden met Stefansson in Ottawa in February 1913 he offered to assume financial responsibility for the entire expedition. Borden&#x27;s government was hopeful that the expedition would strengthen Canada&#x27;s claim to sovereignty over the Arctic islands. The American sponsors agreed to withdraw, subject to an NGS condition that the Society could reclaim its rights to the expedition if Stefansson failed to depart by June 1913. This created a narrow deadline and hurried preparations for the journey north, although Stefansson maintained in his 1921 account that &quot;forethought appeared to have anticipated every eventuality&quot;.

===Objectives and strategy===
The Canadian government&#x27;s financial involvement represented a shift in the expedition&#x27;s emphasis, towards geographical exploration rather than the original purpose of ethnological and scientific studies. In a letter to the Canadian &quot;Victoria Daily Times&quot;, Stefansson set out these separate aims. The main object was to explore the &quot;area of a million or so square miles that is represented by white patches on our map, lying between Alaska and the North Pole&quot;. The expedition also aimed to be the most comprehensive scientific study of the Arctic ever attempted. While a Northern Party searched for new lands, a mainly land-based Southern Party under zoologist Rudolph Anderson would carry out surveys and anthropological studies in the islands off the northern Canadian coast.

The Northern Party&#x27;s ship, &quot;Karluk&quot;, would proceed north from the Canadian coast until it either found land or was stopped by ice. It would explore any land it encountered; otherwise it would follow the ice edge eastward and attempt to winter at either Banks Island or Prince Patrick Island. If the ship was trapped in the ice and forced to drift, the party would study the direction of Arctic currents and carry out oceanographic research. Meanwhile, Rudolph Anderson&#x27;s party was expected to continue with the anthropological studies of the &quot;blond Eskimo&quot;, to collect varieties of Arctic flora and fauna, to carry out geological research, and to seek open-water channels in the hope of establishing new trade routes.

===Organisation and personnel===

Stefansson&#x27;s plan was to take the expedition to the old whaling station at Herschel Island off the Canadian Arctic coast, where the final composition of the Northern and Southern Parties would be decided and where equipment and supplies would be divided among the different strands of the venture. The haste to meet the NGS deadline led to concerns among the expedition&#x27;s members about the adequacy of the provision of food, clothing and equipment. Stefansson, who was largely absent in the hectic weeks immediately before sailing and who revealed few of his plans to his team, dismissed such concerns as &quot;impertinent and disloyal&quot;. There were disputes between Stefansson and the scientists over the chain of command; the Canadian Geological Survey, which had provided four scientists to the expedition, wanted these men to report to them rather than to Stefansson. Southern Party leader Rudolph Anderson threatened to resign over Stefansson&#x27;s claim to the publication rights of all private expedition journals.

The scientific team, made up of some of the most distinguished men in their fields, included representatives from the United States, Denmark, Norway and France, as well as from Britain and its Empire. Only two, however, had previous polar experience: Alistair Forbes Mackay, the expedition&#x27;s medical officer, had visited Antarctica with Sir Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s &quot;Nimrod&quot; expedition in 1907–09, and had been one of the party of three to discover the location of the South Magnetic Pole. Another &quot;Nimrod&quot; veteran, the 46-year-old James Murray, was Stefansson&#x27;s oceanographer. Among the younger scientists were William Laird McKinlay (1889–1983), a 24-year-old science teacher from Glasgow who was recommended by the British explorer William Speirs Bruce, and Bjarne Mamen (1893–1914), a 20-year-old skiing champion from Christiania, Norway, who was taken on as a forester, despite lacking scientific experience.

Stefansson had wanted American whaling skipper Christian Theodore Pedersen to captain &quot;Karluk&quot;, the ship designated for the Northern Party. When Pedersen withdrew, the captaincy was offered to 36-year-old Newfoundland-born Robert Bartlett, an experienced polar navigator who had commanded Robert Peary&#x27;s ship, , on Peary&#x27;s 1906 and 1909 polar expeditions. Bartlett did not have time, however, to select &quot;Karluk&#x27;s&quot; crew, which was hurriedly assembled from around the Royal Navy Dockyard at Esquimalt in British Columbia. McKinlay later wrote of the crew that &quot;one was a confirmed drug addict ... another suffered from venereal disease; and in spite of orders that no liquor was to be carried, at least two smuggled supplies on board&quot;. McKinlay worried that this crew might lack the qualities and character necessary in the arduous months ahead, concerns shared by Bartlett, whose first act on arrival in Esquimalt was to fire the first officer for incompetence. In his place he appointed the 22-year-old Alexander &quot;Sandy&quot; Anderson.

===Ships===
&quot;Karluk&quot; had been chosen by Pedersen and bought by Stefansson for the bargain price of US$10,000. Stefansson was advised by Pedersen that, of four ships that were available, &quot;Karluk&quot; was &quot;the soundest and best adapted for our purpose&quot;, but Bartlett had deep reservations about her fitness for prolonged Arctic service. The ship, a 29-year-old brigantine, was in length with a beam of . She had been built for the Aleutian fishing industry (&quot;karluk&quot; is the Aleut word for &quot;fish&quot;) and later converted for whaling, when her bows and sides had been sheathed with Australian ironwood. Despite 14 arctic whaling voyages, including six overwinterings, she had not been built to withstand sustained ice pressure, and lacked the engine power to force a passage through the ice. She did not match the expectations of Bartlett, or of many of the more experienced crew.

The ship spent most of April and May 1913 undergoing repairs and refitting at the dockyard in Esquimalt. When Bartlett arrived in early June he immediately ordered further repair work. In addition to &quot;Karluk&quot;, Stefansson had purchased sight unseen a small gasoline-driven schooner, &quot;Alaska&quot;, to act as a supply ship for the Southern Party. He later added a second schooner, &quot;Mary Sachs&quot;, when the hold space in &quot;Alaska&quot; proved inadequate. In the confusion surrounding the expedition&#x27;s departure, McKinlay notes, no attempt was made to align men or equipment to their appropriate ships. Thus anthropologists Henri Beuchat and Diamond Jenness, both designated for the Southern Party, found themselves sailing with &quot;Karluk&quot;, while their equipment was on board &quot;Alaska&quot;. McKinlay himself, aboard &quot;Karluk&quot; as magnetic observer, discovered that most of his equipment was with &quot;Alaska&quot;. Stefansson insisted that all would be sorted out when the ships reached their Herschel Island rendezvous. &quot;Heaven help us all if we failed to reach Herschel Island&quot;, McKinlay wrote.

===Towards Herschel Island===
&quot;Karluk&quot; left Esquimalt on 17 June 1913, sailing north towards Alaska. The immediate destination was Nome, on the coast of the Bering Sea. There was trouble from the beginning with the steering gear and with the engines, both of which needed frequent attention. On 2 July &quot;Karluk&quot; reached the Bering Sea in mist, fog and rapidly falling temperatures; six days later she arrived at Nome where she joined &quot;Alaska&quot; and &quot;Mary Sachs&quot;. While the ships were being loaded in Nome, some of the scientists pressed for a meeting with the leader to clarify plans, particularly with regard to the Northern Party whose schedule was vague. The meeting was unsatisfactory. Stefansson&#x27;s attitude offended several of the men, some of whom threatened to leave the expedition. They had read press reports in which Stefansson had apparently said that he expected &quot;Karluk&quot; to be crushed, and that the lives of the staff were secondary to the scientific work. Stefansson would not explain these matters, nor give further details of his plans for the Northern Party. Despite the scientists&#x27; alarm and dissatisfaction, none resigned.

At Port Clarence, just north of Nome, 28 dogs were taken on board before &quot;Karluk&quot; sailed north on 27 July. The next day she crossed the Arctic Circle, and almost immediately encountered rough weather which resulted in flooded cabins and seasickness. However, McKinlay noted that &quot;whatever defects she had, &quot;Karluk&quot; was proving herself a fine sea-boat.&quot; On 31 July they reached Point Hope, where two Inuit hunters, known as &quot;Jerry&quot; and &quot;Jimmy&quot;, joined the ship. On 1 August the permanent Arctic ice pack was seen; Bartlett made several attempts to breach the ice, but each time was forced back. On 2 August, about from Point Barrow, &quot;Karluk&quot; thrust her way into the ice but was soon trapped, and drifted slowly eastward for three days before reaching open water off Cape Smythe. Meanwhile, Stefansson had left to travel over the ice to Point Barrow. He rejoined the ship at Cape Smythe on 6 August, bringing with him Jack Hadley, a veteran trapper who required passage east. Hadley, a long-time acquaintance of Stefansson&#x27;s, was entered in the ship&#x27;s books as carpenter.

At Cape Smythe two more Inuit hunters, Keraluk and Kataktovik, joined the expedition, together with Keraluk&#x27;s family—wife Keruk and their two young daughters Helen and Mugpi. As the voyage proceeded, Bartlett became increasingly anxious about the extent of ice in the area, and noted that the brass stemplates on the ship&#x27;s bow had already been damaged. Over the next few days &quot;Karluk&quot; struggled to make headway, as Bartlett took the ship northwards away from the coast, following channels of open water. The only scientific tasks of substance that could be carried out during this period were Murray&#x27;s dredging operations, through which he collected many species of Arctic sea life, and the regular depth soundings. On 13 August Bartlett calculated their position as east of Point Barrow, with a similar distance to travel to Herschel Island. This proved to be the ship&#x27;s farthest point east, as at that position she became firmly trapped in the ice and began to move slowly westward; by 10 September &quot;Karluk&quot; had retreated nearly back towards Point Barrow. Shortly afterwards, Stefansson informed Bartlett that all hopes for further progress that year had ended, and that &quot;Karluk&quot; would have to winter in the ice.

==In the ice==

===Drifting west===

On 19 September, with &quot;Karluk&quot; ice-bound and largely stationary, Stefansson announced that in view of the shortage of fresh meat and the likelihood of a long sojourn in the ice, he would lead a small hunting party that would search for caribou and other game in the area of the Colville River. He would take with him the two Inuit &quot;Jimmy&quot; and &quot;Jerry&quot;, the expedition secretary Burt McConnell, the photographer George Wilkins, and the anthropologist Diamond Jenness. Stefansson expected to be gone for about ten days; Bartlett was instructed by letter that, if the ship should move from its present position, he should &quot;send a party ashore, to erect one or more beacons giving information of the ship&#x27;s whereabouts.&quot; The next day the six men departed. On 23 September, following a blizzard, the ice floe in which &quot;Karluk&quot; was trapped began to move, and soon the ship was travelling at between a day—but to the west, steadily further from Herschel Island and from Stefansson&#x27;s party who, it soon became clear, would not be able to find their way back to the ship.

In an unpublished journal and later correspondence, McKinlay suggested that Stefansson&#x27;s departure amounted to abandoning the ship to its fate. The expedition&#x27;s historian S.E. Jenness (son of Diamond Jenness) rejects this view, pointing out that Stefansson and the hunting party members had left valuable property aboard &quot;Karluk&quot;; a possible motive for the trip, Jenness surmises, was to train the younger staff. The anthropologist Gísli Pálsson, writing of the expedition, asserts that while the anger of Bartlett and the crew is understandable, there is no evidence that Stefansson deliberately abandoned the men. It is arguable, Pálsson says, that Stefansson acted responsibly in attempting to secure a supply of fresh meat which would counter the possibility of scurvy, should &quot;Karluk&quot; be trapped in the ice for a long time. The historian Richard Diubaldo writes &quot;The evidence suggests that this was a normal hunting trip&quot; and &quot;... there is strong evidence to suggest he [Stefansson] wished he had never left [the ship]&quot;.
The constant snow and thick mists made it difficult for Bartlett to calculate the &quot;Karluk&#x27;s&quot; position accurately, although during a brief break in the weather on 30 September they glimpsed land which they took to be Cooper Island, in the vicinity of Point Barrow where they had been at the start of August. On 3 October the anxiety of crew and staff increased when, with Point Barrow just distant, the drift turned northwards, away from the land. There were fears among some that &quot;Karluk&quot; would repeat the experience of the &quot;Jeannette&quot;, an American vessel that 30 years previously had drifted in the Arctic ice for months before sinking, with the subsequent loss of most of her crew. Bartlett became aware that Murray and McKay, the two veterans of Shackleton&#x27;s &quot;Nimrod&quot; expedition, were openly contemptuous of their captain&#x27;s leadership. They were making plans to leave the ship at an appropriate time, and head for land on their own.

As the weather grew worse Bartlett ordered supplies and equipment to be transferred onto the ice, both to lighten the ship and as a precaution should it be necessary to abandon the vessel in a hurry. Food supplies were augmented by seal hunts—two or three seals a day was the average bag, according to McKinlay—and by a single polar bear that had wandered near the ship in mid-November. On 15 November &quot;Karluk&quot; reached 73°N, the most northerly point of its drift, and then began moving south-west, in the general direction of the Siberian coast. By mid-December the estimated position was from Wrangel Island. Despite the bleak outlook—Bartlett was privately convinced that &quot;Karluk&quot; would not survive the winter— a determined effort was made to celebrate Christmas, with decorations, presents, a programme of sports on the ice, and a banquet. By then they were just north of Herald Island, a rocky outpost east of Wrangel Island; on 29 December land was visible in the distance, though whether this was Herald Island or Wrangel Island was not clear. The sighting of land briefly raised morale, but in the New Year the ice began breaking up and forming pressure ridges. Over the next few days, wrote McKinlay, &quot;the twanging, drumming, ominous ice sounds got louder and nearer.&quot;

===Sinking===

Early in the morning of 10 January 1914, McKinlay records, &quot;a severe shudder shook the whole ship&quot; as the ice attacked the hull. Bartlett, still hoping to save his ship, gave orders to lighten her by removing all accumulated snow from the decks. He also ordered all hands to have warm clothing ready. At 6.45 in the evening a loud bang indicated that the hull had been punctured; Bartlett went immediately to the engine room and observed water pouring in through a gash long. There was no possibility that the pumps could deal with the inflow, and the captain gave the order to abandon ship. Weather conditions, says McKinlay, could hardly have been worse, but the crew and staff worked throughout the night, in pitch darkness and driving snow, to add to the quantities of rations and equipment already stored on the ice. Bartlett remained on board until the last moments, playing loud music on the ship&#x27;s Victrola and burning each record upon finishing it. At 3:15 p.m. on 11 January, Bartlett put on Chopin&#x27;s Funeral March as a final salute to the ship, and stepped off. &quot;Karluk&quot; sank within minutes, her yardarms snapping off as she disappeared through the narrow hole in the ice. McKinlay took stock of the stranded party: 22 men, one woman, two children, 16 dogs and a cat.

===Shipwreck Camp===

Bartlett&#x27;s decision to deposit stores on the ice ensured that an ice camp, known as &quot;Shipwreck Camp&quot;, was more or less established by the time &quot;Karluk&quot; sank. Two shelters had been built, one a snow igloo with a canvas roof, the other constructed from packing cases. To the latter was added a kitchen with a large stove rescued from &quot;Karluk&#x27;s&quot; engine room. A small, separate shelter was built for the five Inuit, and a rough perimeter created from coal bags and assorted containers. In McKinlay&#x27;s words, the camp provided &quot;substantial and comfortable houses on which we could rely for shelter for a long time.&quot; Stores were plentiful, and the party was able to eat well. Much of the time in the first days of the camp was spent preparing and adjusting clothing and sleeping gear, in readiness for the forthcoming march to Wrangel Island. The ice drift was slowly moving the camp in the direction of the island, but as yet there was insufficient daylight to attempt the march.

Amid this activity Mackay and Murray, now joined by the anthropologist Henri Beuchat, played little part in the general life of the camp and expressed their determination to leave it, independently, as soon as possible. Bartlett wanted to wait for the longer daylight hours of February before attempting the march, but was persuaded by McKinlay and Mamen to send a trailbreaking group to set up an advance camp on Wrangel Island. A party of four, led by &quot;Karluk&#x27;s&quot; first officer Alexander Anderson and including crew members Charles Barker, John Brady and Edmund Golightly, left Shipwreck Camp on 21 January with instructions from Bartlett to establish their camp at or near Berry Point on the north shore of Wrangel Island. On 4 February Bjarne Mamen, who accompanied the party as a scout, returned to Shipwreck Camp and reported that he had left the group a few miles short of land that was evidently not Wrangel Island, and was probably Herald Island, from their intended destination. This was the last sighting of Anderson&#x27;s party; their ultimate fate was not established until ten years later, when their remains were found on Herald Island.

===March to Wrangel Island===

Bartlett decided to send a team back to establish the exact location of the island that the Anderson party had approached, and to determine if Anderson had actually landed there. An injury to his knee ruled Mamen out from this mission, which was undertaken by ship&#x27;s steward Ernest Chafe, with the Inuit pair, Kataktovik and Kuraluk. Chafe&#x27;s group came within 2 miles (3 km) of Herald Island before being stopped by open water. A careful examination through binoculars revealed no signs of the missing party, and Chafe concluded that Anderson and company had not reached the island. Chafe and his party then returned to Shipwreck Camp.

Meanwhile, on 4 February, Mackay and his group (Murray and Beuchat, joined by seaman Stanley Morris) announced they were leaving the next day, to seek land. Mackay presented Bartlett with a letter dated 1 February that began: &quot;We, the undersigned, in consideration of the present critical situation, desire to make an attempt to reach the land.&quot; The letter requested appropriate supplies, and concluded by emphasising that the journey was on their own initiative and absolving Bartlett from all responsibilities. Bartlett allocated them a sledge, a tent, six gallons of oil, a rifle and ammunition and food for 50 days. They left on 5 February; the last sighting of them was a few days later, by Chafe and the Inuit, returning from their abortive trip to Herald Island. They found Mackay&#x27;s party struggling to make headway, with some of their provisions lost and clothing and other equipment discarded to lighten their load. Beuchat in particular was in a distressed state, nearly delirious and in the throes of hypothermia. However, the party refused assistance and rejected Chafe&#x27;s pleas that they return with him to Shipwreck Camp. Thereafter the only hint of their fate was a sailor&#x27;s scarf belonging to Morris, later found buried in an ice floe. It was assumed that the four had either been crushed by the ice, or had fallen through it.
Bartlett&#x27;s party now consisted of eight &quot;Karluk&quot; crew members (himself, engineers John Munro and Robert Williamson, seamen Hugh Williams and Fred Maurer, fireman George Breddy, cook Robert Templeman, and Chafe), three scientists (McKinlay, Mamen and geologist George Malloch), John Hadley, and five Inuit (the family of four and Kataktovik). Hadley, nearing 60 years of age, was one of the few, along with Bartlett and the Inuit, with experience of travelling for distances over ice. Bartlett sent his forces out, in groups, to blaze a trail and lay down supply depots on the route to Wrangel Island, thus preparing his inexperienced party for the hazards of ice travel. When he felt they were ready for the main journey he divided them into four teams and sent the first two away on 19 February. Bartlett himself led the last two groups from the camp on 24 February, leaving a note of the party&#x27;s location in a copper drum in case the camp should drift into an inhabited area. The distance to Wrangel Island was estimated at , but the journey proved to be twice that in length.

The ice surface was very broken up, making travel slow and difficult. At first the parties were able to travel along a track that had been marked out by the advance parties. However, recent storms had destroyed much of the trail, and in places progress was held up by breaking ice which at one point almost wrecked Bartlett&#x27;s camp as his team slept. On 28 February all the parties came together in front of the first of a series of high ridges, from in height, that halted their progress. These stretched east and west, blocking any route to the island. McKinlay, Hadley and Chafe were sent on a risky journey back to Shipwreck Camp to pick up supplies that had been left there, while the rest slowly chopped and cut a pathway through the towering ridges. When McKinlay&#x27;s group returned to the main party a week later, the path forward had been advanced by only three miles (5 km), but the worst of the ridges had been overcome. Hadley claimed that the ridges were worse than anything he had seen in his long years of Arctic experience. The later stages of the journey were easier, as the group travelled over steadily smoother ice, and on 12 March they reached land, a long spit of sand stretching out from the northern shores of Wrangel Island.

==Bartlett&#x27;s journey==
Bartlett&#x27;s initial plan had been for the group to rest briefly on Wrangel Island and then to move on together to the Siberian coast. However, because three men—Mamen, Malloch and Maurer—were injured, and others were weak and frostbitten, Bartlett decided that the main party should remain on the island while he went for help taking only Kataktovik. The pair started off on 18 March, with seven dogs and provisions for 48 days (30 days for the dogs), and took an extended route round the island&#x27;s southern shores to look for signs of Anderson&#x27;s or Mackay&#x27;s parties. After finding nothing, they headed across the ice towards Siberia, but progress was slow over a surface that was frequently shifting and breaking up to form leads of open water. More time was lost digging out their provisions from the steadily drifting snow. As they drew nearer to the mainland, Kataktovik became nervous; he had heard that the Alaskan Inuit were disliked in Siberia by the native Chukchi people, and feared for his life. Bartlett did his best to reassure him as they moved slowly forward.
On 4 April the pair reached land near Cape Jakan, west of Cape North on the northern Siberian coast. The presence of sledge marks in the snow showed they had landed in an inhabited area. They followed these tracks for a day, before arriving at a small Chukchi village. Here, contrary to Kataktovik&#x27;s fears, they were received hospitably, and given shelter and food. On 7 April they set out for East Cape. Bartlett had not previously experienced such relentlessly cold weather, with blizzards, hurricane-force winds, and temperatures often below . On the way they passed through several Chukchi villages, where Bartlett traded goods for necessary supplies—he exchanged his Colt revolver for a young, strong dog. Bartlett was touched by the kindness and generosity shown by many of those they encountered on the way, &quot;typical of the true humanity of these kindly people&quot;. On 24 April they arrived at Emma Town, a settlement a few miles west of East Cape. Bartlett calculated that in the 37 days since leaving Wrangel Island, he and Kataktovik had travelled about , all but the last stage on foot.

At Emma Town Bartlett met Baron Kleist, a distinguished Russian official who offered to take him to Emma Harbour on the coast, a week&#x27;s journey away, where he could look for a ship to Alaska. Bartlett accepted, and on 10 May, though still weak from his journey and an attack of tonsillitis, said goodbye to Kataktovik (who was remaining for the time being in Emma Town), and set off with the baron. On the way they learned that Captain Pedersen was in the area. On 16 May they reached Emma Harbour; five days later Pedersen arrived in the whaler &quot;Herman&quot; and, without delay, took Bartlett on board and set out for Alaska. They arrived off Nome on 24 May, but ice prevented them reaching the shore. After three days&#x27; waiting they turned south, and landed at St Michael, where Bartlett was at last able to send a radio message to Ottawa informing the government of &quot;Karluk&#x27;s&quot; fate. He also made enquiries about the whereabouts of the United States revenue cutter &quot;Bear&quot;, which he saw as a possible rescue vessel for the stranded party.

==On Wrangel Island==

The landfall from Shipwreck Camp had been on the north side of Wrangel Island, at a spot which they named &quot;Icy Spit&quot;. Before his departure, Bartlett asked the party to set up several camps around the island, which would increase the hunting areas. The captain also felt that separation into smaller groups would assist general harmony by keeping incompatible characters apart. He wanted all groups to reassemble at Rodgers Harbor, on the south side of the island, about the middle of July.

However, dissension broke out almost immediately after Bartlett&#x27;s departure over the sharing of food. It had not been possible to drag all the supplies from Shipwreck Camp, and the trek had taken longer than expected; consequently there were shortages of biscuit, pemmican (a compound of dried meat, fat and sugar) and dog food. There was little prospect of augmenting supplies by hunting birds and game until the weather improved in May or June. When Hadley and the Inuit, Kuraluk, returned from a seal hunt on the ice, Hadley was widely suspected of concealing the proceeds of the hunt for his own consumption; the same pair were also accused of wasting scarce cooking oil. McKinlay records that the circumstances depressed morale and destroyed comradeship: &quot;The misery and desperation of our situation multiplied every weakness, every quirk of personality, every flaw in character, a thousandfold.&quot;

Two attempts were made to travel back to Shipwreck Camp to pick up extra food, but both failed, the second resulting in further losses of dogs and equipment. Chafe, whose feet had become gangrenous after severe frostbite, had his toes removed by second engineer Williamson, with improvised tools. McKinlay and Munro risked their lives by travelling over the sea ice towards Herald Island, in a final effort to locate either of the missing parties. They could get no nearer than , and from an examination of the distant island through binoculars could see no indications of life.

Other health problems persisted; Malloch&#x27;s frostbitten feet failed to heal, and Mamen&#x27;s knee, which he had dislocated during the days at Shipwreck Camp, troubled him continuously. A worrying illness began to affect many of the party: the general symptoms were swelling of the legs, ankles and other body parts, accompanied by acute lethargy. Malloch was the worst affected; he died on 17 May, but his tent-mate Mamen was too ill to see to his burial, so the body lay in the tent for several days, creating a &quot;frightful smell&quot;, until McKinlay arrived to help. Mamen himself died ten days later of the same debilitating disease.

From early June the diet was augmented with the appearance of birds. These birds and their eggs became a vital source of food; as the supply of seal meat dwindled to nothing, the party was reduced to eating rotten flippers, hide, or any part of a seal that was remotely edible. The sharing of birds became another bone of contention; according to Williamson &quot;Wednesday last, [Breddy and Chafe] really obtained 6 eggs and 5 birds instead of 2 eggs and 4 birds as they reported.&quot; Breddy was suspected of other thefts. On 25 June, after a gunshot was heard, Breddy was found dead in his tent. The circumstances of his death, whether accident, suicide or in Hadley&#x27;s view, murder (with Williamson as the chief suspect) could not be determined. Williamson later called Hadley&#x27;s suspicions &quot;hallucinations and absolutely untrue.&quot; Various items stolen from McKinlay were found among Breddy&#x27;s personal effects.

Despite the sombre outlook, the Canadian flag was raised at Rodgers Harbor on 1 July in honour of Dominion Day. Later in the month the party&#x27;s spirits improved when Kuraluk caught a walrus, which provided fresh meat for several days. As August came without sign of a ship and the weather began to turn wintry again, hopes of rescue fell; the party began to prepare for another winter.

==Rescue==
The revenue cutter &quot;Bear&quot; arrived in St Michael, Alaska, midway through June. Her master, Captain Cochran, agreed to go to Wrangel Island as soon as he got permission from the United States government. It would be impossible, in any event, to attempt the rescue before mid-July; ice conditions in the Arctic that year were reported as severe. After receiving permission, &quot;Bear&quot;, with Bartlett aboard, left St Michael on 13 July; the ship had many calls to make along the Alaskan coast before she could proceed with the rescue. On 5 August, at Port Hope, Bartlett met with Kataktovik and gave him his expedition wages and a new suit of clothing. At Point Barrow on 21 August Bartlett encountered Burt McConnell, Stefansson&#x27;s erstwhile secretary, who gave details of Stefansson&#x27;s movements after leaving &quot;Karluk&quot; the previous September. In April 1914, McConnell reported, Stefansson had headed north with two companions, searching for new lands.

McConnell left Point Barrow for Nome aboard &quot;King and Winge&quot;, an American-registered walrus hunter, while &quot;Bear&quot; finally sailed for Wrangel Island. On 25 August &quot;Bear&quot; was stopped by ice from the island, and after failing to force a way through, Cochran had to return to Nome for more coal—a decision which, says Bartlett, gave him &quot;days to try a man&#x27;s soul&quot;. Back in Nome Bartlett met Olaf Swenson, who had chartered &quot;King and Winge&quot; for the season and was about to sail for Siberia. Bartlett requested that, if possible, &quot;King and Winge&quot; stop by Wrangel Island and look for the stranded &quot;Karluk&quot; party. &quot;Bear&quot; left Nome on 4 September, a few days after Swenson&#x27;s ship. &quot;King and Winge&quot;, with McConnell still aboard, reached Wrangel Island on 7 September. That morning the group at Rodgers Harbor were awakened early in the morning by the sound of a ship&#x27;s whistle, and found &quot;King and Winge&quot; lying a quarter of a mile offshore. They were rapidly transferred to the ship, which then picked up the remainder of the stranded party who were camped along the coast at Waring Point. By the afternoon all 14 survivors were aboard.

After a futile attempt to approach Herald Island, the ship began the journey back to Alaska; next day she encountered &quot;Bear&quot;, with Bartlett aboard. McConnell records that the party were unanimous in their desire to remain with the ship that had effected their rescue, but Bartlett ordered them aboard &quot;Bear&quot;. Before returning to Alaska, &quot;Bear&quot; made a final attempt to reach Herald Island; ice limited their approach to , and they saw no signs of life. The reunited party arrived at Nome on 13 September, to a great welcome from the local population.

==Aftermath==
Bartlett, celebrated as a hero by press and public, was honoured for &quot;outstanding bravery&quot; by the Royal Geographical Society. However, he was later censured by an admiralty commission for taking &quot;Karluk&quot; into the ice, and for allowing Mackay&#x27;s party to leave the main group—despite the letter that Mackay and the others had signed, absolving the captain from responsibility. Stefansson, too, was privately critical of Bartlett&#x27;s conduct. Bartlett resumed his career at sea, and over the next 30 years led many more excursions to the Arctic. During the Second World War he carried out surveying and supply work for the Allies; he died, aged 70, in April 1946. His account of the &quot;Karluk&quot; disaster, published in 1916, makes no direct criticism of Stefansson or anyone else; Niven records, however, that to his friends Bartlett was highly uncomplimentary about his former leader.

In 1918 Stefansson returned after four years&#x27; absence, reporting the discovery of three new islands. He was honoured by the National Geographical Society, received tributes from polar veterans such as Peary and Adolphus Greely, and was given the presidency of the Explorers Club of New York. In Canada his reception was more muted; there were questions relating to the overall costs of the expedition, its poor initial organisation, and his handling of the Southern Party which, under Rudolph Anderson, completed its work independently of Stefansson. Anderson and other members of the Southern Party later petitioned the Canadian government to investigate statements made by Stefansson in his 1921 book &quot;The Friendly Arctic&quot;, which they felt reflected poorly on their honour. The request was declined on the ground that &quot;no good could come of the enquiry.&quot; In his book Stefansson takes responsibility for the &quot;bold&quot; decision to take &quot;Karluk&quot; into the ice rather than hugging the coast on the way to Herschel Island, and accepts that he &quot;chose the wrong alternative&quot;. However, McKinlay felt that the book gave an inaccurate account of the &quot;Karluk&quot; voyage and its consequences, &quot;putting the blame ... on everyone but Vilhjalmur Stefansson.&quot; The historian Tom Henighan believes that McKinlay&#x27;s biggest complaint against his leader was that &quot;Stefansson never at any time seemed able to express an appropriate sorrow over his lost men.&quot; Stefansson, who never returned to the Arctic, died in 1962 at the age of 82.

The fate of First Officer Alexander Anderson&#x27;s party remained unknown until 1924, when an American vessel landed at Herald Island and found human remains, with supplies of food, clothing, ammunition and equipment. From these artefacts it was established that this was Anderson&#x27;s party. No cause of death was established, though the plentiful unconsumed supplies ruled out starvation. One theory was that the tent had blown away in a storm and that the party had frozen to death. Another was carbon monoxide poisoning within the tent.

The mystery illness which affected most of the Wrangel Island party and accelerated the deaths of Malloch and Mamen was later diagnosed as a form of nephritis brought about by eating faulty pemmican. Stefansson explained this by saying that &quot;our pemmican makers has failed us through supplying us with a product deficient in fat.&quot; Peary had emphasised that a polar explorer should &quot;give his personal, constant and insistent attention&quot; to the making of his pemmican; McKinlay believed that Stefansson had devoted too much time selling the idea of the expedition, and too little ensuring the quality of the food that its members would depend upon.

Of the survivors, Hadley continued working for the Canadian Arctic Expedition, becoming second officer and later master of the supply ship &quot;Polar Bear&quot;. He died of influenza, in San Francisco in 1918. Hadley and McConnell wrote accounts of their experiences for Stefansson, who incorporated them in &quot;The Friendly Arctic&quot;. Chafe also wrote and published a short account. Most of the others quickly returned to relative obscurity, but in 1922, Fred Maurer was persuaded by Stefansson to join an attempt to colonise Wrangel Island. To the embarrassment of the Canadian government, Stefansson insisted on going ahead, even though Wrangel Island was indisputably part of what had then become the Soviet Union. A party of five, including Maurer, was sent to the island; only one, an Inuk woman Ada Blackjack, survived. Despite their ordeal, many of the &quot;Karluk&quot; survivors lived long lives; Williamson, who declined to speak or write of his experiences in the Arctic, lived to be 97, dying in Victoria, Canada, in 1975. McKinlay died in 1983, aged 95, having published his account of the expedition in 1976. Kuraluk, Kuruk and their daughters, Helen and Mugpi, returned to their former life at Point Barrow. The two girls, says Pálsson, had provided &quot;important sources of cheer at the darkest moments.&quot; Mugpi, who later was known as Ruth Makpii Ipalook, became the very last survivor of the &quot;Karluk&quot; voyage, dying in 2008 at the age of 97.

==Published voyage accounts==
Six first-hand accounts of &quot;Karluk&#x27;s&quot; last voyage have been published. These include Stefansson&#x27;s account which only covers the June to September 1913 period. Expedition secretary Burt McConnell wrote an account of the Wrangel Island rescue which was published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, 15 September 1914. A version of McConnell&#x27;s account appears in Stefansson&#x27;s book.

<text>RAGBRAI, short for &quot;Register&quot; Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa, is a non-competitive bicycle tour across the U.S. state of Iowa from the western to eastern border. First held in 1973, RAGBRAI is the largest bike-touring event in the world.

The 50th ride, RAGBRAI L, took place from July 23-29, 2023, and retraced much of the first year&#x27;s route. Carroll replaced Fort Dodge and the much larger town/area of Coralville-Iowa City replaced the small town of Williamsburg. The ride from Ames to Des Moines had over 60,000 riders, the most riders of any stop in the history of the event.

==Description==
Each year&#x27;s route begins at a community near Iowa&#x27;s western border and ends at a community near the eastern border, with stops in towns across the state. The ride is one week long and ends on the last Saturday of July each year. The earliest possible starting date is July 19, and the latest is July 25.

While formerly a lottery was held to select participants, registration is now on a first-come-first-serve basis. Iowa bicycle clubs and charters, as well as teams and groups, many of whom are from out of state, also receive a number of passes for which members apply through those organizations. Despite the official limits, unregistered riders have on many days swelled the actual number of riders to well over the registered number count.
The length of the entire week&#x27;s route over RAGBRAI&#x27;s first 40 years from 1973 through 2012, not including the Century Loop, averaged ; the average daily distance between host communities is . Eight &quot;host communities&quot; are selected each year, one each for the beginning and end points, the other six serving as overnight stops from Sunday through Friday for the bicyclists. At the beginning of the ride, participants traditionally dip the rear wheels of their bikes in either the Missouri River or the Big Sioux River; at the end, riders dip their front wheels in the Mississippi River.

===Overnight stops===
The ride has passed through all 99 of Iowa&#x27;s counties in its history. Fourteen different communities have served as the starting point, while 12 have hosted the finish. 108 other communities have been overnight hosts during the week of the ride.

An event known as the RAGBRAI Route Announcement Party is held the last part of January to release the names of the overnight towns. The route is fleshed out in the following weeks and is announced in the &quot;Des Moines Register&quot; and on the RAGBRAI website in early March.

==History==
===The Great Six-Day Bicycle Ride (1973)===
RAGBRAI began in 1973, when &quot;Des Moines Register&quot; feature writers John Karras and Donald Kaul decided to go on a bicycle ride across Iowa; both men were avid cyclists. Karras challenged Kaul to do the ride and write articles about what he experienced. Kaul agreed to do it, but only if Karras also did the ride. Karras then agreed to ride, as well.

The newspaper&#x27;s management approved of the plan. Don Benson, a public-relations director at the &quot;Register&quot;, was assigned to coordinate the event. Upon the suggestion of Ed Heins, the managing editor, the writers invited the public to accompany them.

The ride was planned to start on Sunday, August 26 in Sioux City and end in Davenport on Friday, August 31. The overnight stops were Storm Lake, Fort Dodge, Ames, Des Moines, and Williamsburg. The &quot;Register&quot; informed readers of the event and the planned route. The ride was informally referred to as &quot;the Great Six-Day Bicycle Ride&quot;.

Some 300 cyclists began the ride in Sioux City; 114 of them rode the entire route. A number of other people rode part of the route. Attendance was light the first year. The ride was announced with only six weeks&#x27; notice and it conflicted with both the first week of school and the final weekend of the Iowa State Fair.

After the ride was over, Kaul and Karras wrote numerous articles that captured the imaginations of many readers. Among those who completed the 1973 ride was 83-year-old Clarence Pickard of Indianola. He rode a used ladies Schwinn and wore a long-sleeved shirt, trousers, woolen long underwear, and a silver pith helmet. He said that the underwear blocked out the sun and kept his skin cool. The newspaper received many calls and letters from people who wanted to go on the ride, but were unable to for various reasons. Because of this public response and demand, a second ride was scheduled for August 4–10, 1974, before the Iowa State Fair.

===Second year: SAGBRAI, August 4–10, 1974===
The 1974 ride, known as the Second Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa (or SAGBRAI), was more carefully planned. For example, each morning, the official start time was 7:30 am; however, by Wednesday, the start time was dropped so that riders could depart at any time that was appropriate for the rider. The Iowa State Patrol was involved for the first time to control traffic and assure safety, and arrangements were made to have medical services available for riders. For the first time, the route was driven in advance for inspection purposes. The start of the ride was in Council Bluffs, had overnight stops in Atlantic, Guthrie Center, Camp Dodge (near Des Moines), Marshalltown, Waterloo, and Monticello, and finished in the riverfront city of Dubuque. The ride occurred in the same week as the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon. The high point of the trip for many of the riders was the second overnight stop, where a sign greeted the riders outside of the designated overnight town, Guthrie Center. It read, &quot;Please be kind. You outnumber us two to one.&quot; About a half hour in length, &quot;SAGBRAI – the Second Annual Great Bike Ride Across Iowa&quot; is a black and white documentary film about the 1974 ride. OHP Marketing Services of Webster City, Iowa, converted the 16-mm film to a digital format in 2012, and the digital format was screened in Webster City on Monday July 13, 2015.

===As RAGBRAI annual event===
After the second year, the ride continued to grow in popularity. Michael Gartner, then the editor of the &quot;Register&quot;, directed John Karras to include the word &quot;Register&quot; in the ride title; thus the RAGBRAI name, with Roman numerals following it, was adopted for RAGBRAI III in 1975 (the 2012 ride was RAGBRAI XL). RAGBRAI V, from Onawa to Lansing, was the shortest in RAGBRAI history at . Until 2014, it also had the fewest feet in vertical hill climbing. Beginning in 1978, RAGBRAI included a 100-mile century ride to offer a greater challenge. The second day of RAGBRAI IX came to be known as &quot;Soggy Monday&quot; and is generally regarded as the worst weather day in RAGBRAI history. To commemorate it, the &quot;Register&quot; marketed a bicycle patch. Beginning with RAGBRAI X, the dates were moved to the last full week in July, starting on Sunday and ending on Saturday. This ride was also the last for Donald Kaul as co-host; he had ridden with John Karras on the first ten rides. Chuck Offenburger, writer of the &quot;Register&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Iowa Boy&quot; column, joined Karras as co-host in 1983.

With XIV, RAGBRAI introduced a Century Loop. While the day&#x27;s ride might be shorter, a loop was included on the route for cyclists who wanted to ride . This ride went from Council Bluffs to Muscatine, and the optional loop was on the day between Perry and Eldora. The loop was renamed the &quot;Karras Loop&quot; in 2001, in honor of John Karras. On the XXIII ride, the day from Tama-Toledo to Sigourney featured a strong south headwind, much heat and humidity, and many hills. The day came to be known as &quot;Saggy Thursday&quot;. After the XXV ride, which passed through Lucas County, RAGBRAI in its history had gone through all of Iowa&#x27;s 99 counties. John Karras retired as co-host after RAGBRAI XXVIII in 2000, which began at Council Bluffs and ended at Burlington. He died November 10th, 2021, and the 2022 ride (XLIX) featured a 100-mile plus day instead of the Karras Loop.

RAGBRAI XLIII in 2015 was the first to feature an optional gravel loop. The loop was in honor of Steve Hed, the Minnesotan founder of HED Cycling Products and wheel innovator, who had died the previous November. The first gravel loop was part of the second-day ride from Storm Lake to Fort Dodge. Also, the 43rd ride was the first since the initial ride in 1973 to start in Sioux City and end in Davenport. In 2016, the &quot;Mile of Silence&quot;, which remembers the riders who have been lost throughout the years, was started. In 2020, RAGBRAI XLVIII was postponed for a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The rescheduled ride began on July 25, 2021, in Le Mars and ended July 31 in Clinton. The route stopped in Sac City, Fort Dodge, Iowa Falls, Waterloo, Anamosa, and DeWitt. The planned 2020 route had included overnight stops in Storm Lake and Maquoketa, but were replaced by Sac City and DeWitt, respectively, for the 2021 route.

In 2024, the tour would travel through Greenfield, a city that had been devastated by an EF4 tornado two months prior. This included damaged areas of the city, with debris cleanup being done by volunteers before the event.

==Notable incidents==
===Deaths===
Over the first 42 years of the ride (through 2014), 30 deaths of ride participants or volunteers have officially occurred during the week of RAGBRAI because of accidents or injuries suffered on the ride. Although the event began in 1973, the first death did not occur until RAGBRAI XII in 1984. Many of the deaths were due to heart attacks that riders suffered while resting. However, in Sheldon on the first night of the 2005 ride, a weather-related fatality occurred as Michael Thomas Burke (a native of Donnellson, Iowa and an industrial engineering graduate from the University of Iowa, who was living in New York City) died when a storm caused a tree limb to fall on him as he was sleeping in a tent.

Only a few deaths resulted from injuries sustained while actually riding on bicycles. The first was in 1987, when 19-year-old John Boyle of Rockwell City fell under the wheels of a flatbed trailer. On Monday, July 30, 2007, at 12:52 pm, a Waterloo man, who was rescued from the Wapsipinicon River in Independence, subsequently died; 62-year-old Rich Droste had been participating in RAGBRAI, which made an overnight stop in Independence on Thursday. Droste was swimming in the Wapsi when he apparently got caught in the current upstream from the dam. On July 25, 2009, Donald D. Myers from Rolla, Missouri, died of injuries sustained in a crash at the bottom of the hill near Geode Lake dam at Geode State Park. On July 30, 2010, Stephen Briggs of Waverly, Iowa died after his bike clipped the tire of another bike and he was thrown from his bike.

After Briggs&#x27; death, no more fatalities occurred until 2014, when on Monday, July 21, Tom Teesdale, 62, of West Branch died of a heart attack between Terril and Graettinger, and on Wednesday, July 23, George &#x27;Frank&#x27; Brinkerhoff of Sioux City died of natural causes and was found dead in his tent Thursday morning. On Sunday, July 24, 2016, at the 2-mile marker on US Highway 34 near Glenwood, Wayne Ezell, 72, of Jacksonville, Florida, was westbound when a pickup truck driven by Robb Philippus, 34, of Glenwood, hit him from behind about 6:40 am. Ezell, who died from his injuries sustained during the accident, was a rider participating in RAGBRAI XLIV. Also, in 2016, on the Tuesday of RAGBRAI XLIV, a 60-year-old RAGBRAI rider, Clifton Kahler, had a heart attack while riding along Highway 2 between Creston and Leon and died. In 2023 on RAGBRAI L, a rider in his 50s had a medical emergency while riding his bicycle on the route on Tuesday day 3 of RAGBRAI between Carroll and Ames near the intersection of J Avenue and 270th Street in Boone County at approximately 1:16 p.m. but did not survive after transported in an ambulance from the scene.

A plane carrying a pilot and a young Canadian woman who was making a documentary about the ride crashed during the course of the 2005 RAGBRAI. In this case, the pair suffered minor injuries. Pilot Jim Hill of Manchester, Iowa, and Amy Throop of Ottawa, Canada, were following the route on a plane near Riceville, Iowa, when the plane went down. Both Hill and Throop walked away from the accident. Throughout the ride, ultralights have flown over riders a few feet above the trees to get good shots of the riders.

===Crawford County lawsuit and ban===
During 2004&#x27;s RAGBRAI XXXII, Kirk Ullrich was thrown from his bicycle after contacting a crack in the center of the road and died. Ullrich&#x27;s widow Betty Jo Ullrich sued Crawford County and settled for $350,000. The board of supervisors for Crawford County banned RAGBRAI (and other, similar events) to avoid future liability. As of December 2008, however, Crawford County supervisors voted to rescind this ban after the RAGBRAI organizers took steps to indemnify third parties in the case of such events in the future.

===2013 sinkhole along XLI route===
On May 31, 2013, a large sinkhole, at least wide by deep, occurred along Iowa Highway 384 (160th Road in Guthrie County) under the asphalt at the entrance of Springbrook State Park, which is near the boat ramp at the base of Mockingbird Hill. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources (DNR) contacted the Iowa Department of Transportation, which deemed the sinkhole to be unsafe. The Iowa DNR immediately evacuated the campers at Springbrook. In the spring (March, April, and May) of 2013, according to Harry Hillaker, the state of Iowa climatologist, Iowa had the wettest spring on record. The record precipitation, both rainfall and snowfall, contributed to the formation of the sinkhole. On June 3, 2013, the RAGBRAI XLI route inspection preride assessed the sinkhole in considering changes to the route through Springbrook and up Mockingbird Hill, the steepest hill on any RAGBRAI route; however, no changes to the RAGBRAI XLI route were made.

==Food vendors==
During RAGBRAI, food and drink are available in campgrounds, churches, and restaurants, and along the route. Vendors who are officially sanctioned are identified by a sign reading, OFFICIAL RAGBRAI VENDOR. Perhaps the most famed vendor in RAGBRAI history was Paul Bernhard, who along the day&#x27;s route at a rural location sold corn on the cob and pork chops that were basted in melted butter and grilled over charcoal. He began selling chops at RAGBRAI in 1985 and retired after the 2008 ride, leaving the vendorship to his son, Matt. In 1996, he sold 2500 chops in his hometown of Bancroft, Iowa, when the ride passed through there. He was called Mr. Pork Chop and was known for his cry of &quot;Pooooork Chooooooooooop!&quot; He died at age 88.

==Teams and charters==

Riders come from all over the world, and many ride as clubs or teams. Dozens of organized teams go on the ride. In 2007 and 2008, Lance Armstrong organized a LIVESTRONG team of about 200 riders and participated in RAGBRAI; each rider raised $1000 or more towards fighting cancer.

Teams create a social and support system that adds a noncycling dimension to RAGBRAI. While some of the teams have a well-earned reputation for hard partying and heavy drinking, most are serious bicyclists. Teams often customize old school buses and vans. The team buses serve as transportation to and from the ride, and a combination clubhouse and sleeping quarters during the ride. These buses typically sport enormous custom stereos, roof mounted, rail-equipped platforms, which serve as bicycle racks and a place to relax, and interior bathrooms. Several carry 55-gallon plastic water barrels, which become warm during the day. Attached to a gravity-fed hose, they provide teams with a spartan shower at the end of the day&#x27;s ride.

Teams often conform their clothing or partake in certain gimmicks to add levity to the ride and make team members easily identifiable. This can be as simple as wearing identical cycling jerseys with the team logo or various wacky traditions such as purple “troll hair” wigs (Team Spin). Gimmicks include adorning road kill along the route with Mardi Gras beads (Team Road Kill), various drinking games, and a team who carries 5-gallon buckets on their bicycles and challenge riders to “Get on the Bucket” and get tackled off of it by a team member or friend to raise awareness for cancer research (Team Tacklebucket). Many teams also produce logoed team paraphernalia to distribute and trade with other teams (stickers, bracelets, or can koozies being common items).

Charters are bicycle clubs and for-profit companies that provide weeklong support for riders. For a fee, charters typically transport riders to and from the ride, secure preferred camping areas, rent and sometimes pitch tents, provide some bicycle repair services, and offer additional evening social activities. Charters are a common option for riders coming from outside Iowa.

Team Gourmet, based in Chicago, is a group that currently works RAGBRAI and has done so for more than 20 years. They travel with three chefs, who prepare elaborate meals that are served at 6:00 pm. Membership in the team for RAGBRAI and the cuisine included cost around $900. Another charter from Chicago is CUBS, which stands for Chicago Urban Bicycling Society, formed in 1996 especially to ride RAGBRAI. Other charters and clubs involved with RAGBRAI XLII in 2014 include: Team Jorts, Bicycle Illinois, Shuttleguy, Brancel Charters, Bubba&#x27;s Pampered Pedalers, Out of Staters, Pork Belly Ventures, Riverbend Bike Club, Quad Cities Bicycle Club, Lost &amp; Found Adventures, Bike World, Lake Country Cyclist Ankeny, RAGBRAI In Style, Emmetsburg Bike Club, Bikes To You, Bicyclists of Iowa City, Iowa Valley Bicycle Club, North Iowa Touring Club, Melon City Bike Club, Cedar Valley Cyclists, The Pfalcons, Overland Touring Charter, Padre&#x27;s Cycle Inn, and Ron Oman Charters. The Sprint Selzer Bicycle Club is among the longest-running clubs in existence, having formed at RAGBRAI III, by creating a fictional celebrity named Sprint. Team Skunk, the second oldest team on RAGBRAI, goes by the motto &quot;Tails Up!&quot; Most members come from the Ames/Des Moines area, but membership has included riders from 20+ states and several foreign countries.

==Media exposure==
RAGBRAI has had nationwide media exposure, and other rides based on RAGBRAI have been started in other areas of the country. Bil Gilbert, after riding in SAGBRAI, wrote an enthusiastic report that appeared in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. After Gilbert&#x27;s essay, additional writers with &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; have mentioned RAGBRAI over the years. In April 1984, Fredric Dannen wrote an article for the Saturday Evening Post. Harry Smith of &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; rode part of RAGBRAI XXV in 1997 and aired a report. In addition, numerous articles about the ride have appeared over the years in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. Following RAGBRAI XLVII in August 2019, Lonely Planet listed RAGBRAI as one of the top 50 bicycle rides in both North America and South America combined in the book &quot;Epic Bike Rides of the Americas&quot; and, in the book, included Dennis Coello&#x27;s picture of a brightly colored support vehicle with the lyrics to The B-52&#x27;s song &quot;Love Shack&quot; on the side of the Iowa Falls middle school principal Jeff Burchfield&#x27;s &quot;Team Love Shack&quot; RAGBRAI bus of Hardin County, Iowa which supports the group of about 20 riders on &quot;Team Love Shack&quot;, a RAGBRAI team which was established with about 5 or 6 riders in 2007 for RAGBRAI XXXV but, in 2010 for RAGBRAI XXXVIII, purchased an old school bus as the support vehicle for &quot;Team Love Shack&quot; and had the bus painted accordingly according to Scott Kosanke of &quot;Team Love Shack&quot;. Although RAGBRAI XLVIII was postponed from 2020 until 2021 because of the Coronavirus pandemic, news media covered Team Love Shack of Hardin County and especially the Eldora, Iowa area participating in an unofficial ride along the XLVIII route during July 2020. Also in August 2019, CNN featured a travel story &quot;RAGBRAI: A newbie&#x27;s guide to cycling across Iowa&quot; by Christi Scott.

A documentary was made for the 50th ride in 2023 entitled &quot;Shift&quot;. The film was showcased across Iowa and was also broadcast on Iowa PBS.

==Celebrities and athletes==
Ben Davidson, former professional football star player mainly with the Oakland Raiders, rode on RAGBRAI for several years, beginning in 1987. Lance Armstrong rode the Wednesday and Thursday stages in 2006, speaking to a large throng of the riders in Newton. He then completed most of the 2007 ride before leaving a couple of days early to support Team Discovery&#x27;s Alberto Contador and his Tour de France victory. In 2008, Armstrong also made an appearance on the Ames, Iowa, leg of the trip. In 2011, 2013, 2014, 2017, and 2018, he again participated. Ottumwa-born actor/comedian Tom Arnold has ridden a few RAGBRAIs, including XXIV in 1996. Other participants have included three-time Tour de France champ Greg LeMond, columnist Dave Barry, NASCAR drivers Matt Kenseth and Jimmie Johnson, Motocross champion Ryan Dungey, 2004 Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean and former Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt.
Colorado governor and Democratic Presidential candidate John Hickenlooper rode in the 2019 ride. Hickenlooper, his spouse and his crew joined Team Skunk in Indianola where he provided a keg of his signature beer while using the shower of the host home.

<text>David Edward Hughes (16 May 1830 – 22 January 1900), was a British-American inventor, practical experimenter, and professor of music known for his work on the printing telegraph and the microphone. He is generally considered to have been born in London but his family moved around that time so he may have been born in Corwen, Wales.

His family moved to the U.S. while he was a child and he became a professor of music in Kentucky. In 1855 he patented a printing telegraph. He moved back to London in 1857 and further pursued experimentation and invention, coming up with an improved carbon microphone in 1878.

In 1879 he identified what seemed to be a new phenomenon during his experiments: electric sparks generated in one device could be heard in a separate portable microphone apparatus he had set up. It was most probably radio transmissions but this was nine years before electromagnetic radiation was a proven concept and Hughes was convinced by others that his discovery was simply electromagnetic induction.

==Biography==
Hughes was born in 1830, the son of a musically talented family hailing originally from Y Bala (the place of birth was either London or Corwen, Denbighshire), and emigrated to the United States at the age of seven. At only six years old, he is known to have played the harp and english concertina to a very high standard. At an early age, Hughes developed such musical ability that he is reported to have attracted attention of Herr Hast, an eminent German pianist in America, who procured for him a professorship of music at St. Joseph&#x27;s College in Bardstown, Kentucky. Hughes also worked as a practical experimenter, coming up with the printing telegraph in 1855. He moved back to London in 1857 to sell his invention, and worked on the transmission of sound over wires. He worked on microphones and the development of the induction balance (later used in metal detectors). Despite Hughes&#x27; facility as an experimenter, he had little mathematical training. He was a friend of William Henry Preece.

== Printing telegraph ==
In 1855, Hughes designed a printing telegraph system. In less than two years a number of small telegraph companies, including Western Union in early stages of development, united to form one large corporation — Western Union Telegraph Company — to carry on the business of telegraphy on the Hughes system. In Europe, the Hughes Telegraph System became an international standard.

==Microphone==
In 1878 Hughes published his work on the effects of sound on the powered electronic sound pickups, called &quot;transmitters&quot;, being developed for telephones. He showed that the change in resistance in carbon telephone transmitters was a result of the interaction between carbon parts instead of the commonly held theory that it was from the compression of the carbon itself. Based on its ability to pick up extremely weak sounds, Hughes referred to it as a &quot;&quot;microphone&quot; effect&quot; (using a word coined by Charles Wheatstone in 1827 for a mechanical sound amplifier). He conducted a simple demonstration of this principle of loose contact by laying an iron nail across two other nails connected to a battery and galvanometer. His paper was read before the Royal Society of London by Thomas Henry Huxley on May 8, 1878, and his new &quot;microphone&quot; was covered in the July 1 edition of &quot;Telegraph Journal and Electrical Review&quot;. Hughes published his work during the time that Thomas Edison was working on a carbon telephone transmitter and Emile Berliner was working on a loose-contact transmitter. Both Hughes and Edison may have based their work on Philipp Reis&#x27; telephone work. Hughes would refine his microphone design using a series of &quot;carbon pencils&quot; stuck into blocks of carbon to better pick up sound but never patented his work, thinking it should be publicly available for development by others.

== Probable pre-Hertz radio wave detection ==

Hughes seems to have come across the phenomenon of radio waves nine years before they were proven to exist by Heinrich Hertz in 1888. In 1879 while working in London Hughes discovered that a bad contact in a Bell telephone he was using in his experiments seemed to be sparking when he worked on a nearby induction balance. He developed an improved detector to pick up this unknown &quot;extra current&quot; based on his new microphone design and developed a way to interrupt his induction balance via a clockwork mechanism to produce a series of sparks. By trial and error experiments he eventually found he could pick up these &quot;aerial waves&quot; as he carried his telephone device down the street out to a range of .

On February 20, 1880, he demonstrated his technology to representatives of the Royal Society including Thomas Henry Huxley, Sir George Gabriel Stokes, and William Spottiswoode, then president of the Society. Stokes was convinced the phenomenon Hughes was demonstrating was merely electromagnetic induction, not a type of transmission through the air. Hughes was not a physicist and seems to have accepted Stokes observations and did not pursue the experiments any further. A connection with Hughes phenomenon and radio waves seems to show up 4 years after Heinrich Hertz&#x27;s 1888 proof of their existence when Sir William Crookes mentioned in his 1892 Fortnightly Review article on &quot;Some Possibilities of Electricity&quot; that he had already participated in &quot;wireless telegraphy&quot; by an &quot;identical means&quot; to Hertz, a statement showing Crookes was probably another attendee at Hughes&#x27; demonstration.

Hughes did not publish his findings but did finally mention them in an 1899 letter to &quot;The Electrician&quot; magazine where he commented that Hertz&#x27;s experiments were &quot;&quot;far more conclusive than mine&quot;, and that Marconi&#x27;s &quot;efforts at demonstration merit the success he has received&quot;...[and] &quot;the world will be right in placing his name on the highest pinnacle, in relation to aerial electric telegraphy&quot;&quot;. In the same publication Elihu Thomson put forward a claim that Hughes was really the first to transmit radio.

Hughes&#x27; discovery that his devices, based on a loose contact between a carbon rod and two carbon blocks as well as the metallic granules in a microphone that exhibited unusual properties in the presence of sparks generated in a nearby apparatus, may have anticipated later devices known as coherers. The carbon rod and two carbon blocks, which he would refer to as a &quot;coherer&quot; in 1899 is also similar to devices known as crystal radio detectors.

==The Royal Society==
Hughes was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1880, and won their Royal Medal in 1885. After Hughes&#x27; death the Hughes Medal was created by the Royal Society in his honour, to be awarded to other scientists &quot;in recognition of an original discovery in the physical sciences, particularly electricity and magnetism or their applications&quot;. It included a gift of £1000 and was first awarded in 1902. A listing follows of Hughes Medal recipients:

==Death==
Hughes died in London and was buried in a family vault on the outer ring of the Circle of Lebanon at Highgate Cemetery.

His wife Anna Chadbourne Hughes was buried with him.

In his will he left the greater part of his property (£473,034) to a trust fund, to be distributed between the four London hospitals, the Middlesex Hospital, the London Hospital, the King&#x27;s College Hospital and the Charing Cross Hospital. He also left bequests to the Institute of Electrical Engineers, the Société Internationale des Electriciens, the Royal Society, the Académie des Sciences de l&#x27;Institut, and to the Royal Institution of Great Britain.

That same year, he was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society.

Preece was born in Caernarfon (Gwynedd), Wales. He was educated at King&#x27;s College School and King&#x27;s College London. Preece studied at the Royal Institution in London (Great Britain) under Michael Faraday. He later was the consulting engineer for the Post Office (1870s). He became Engineer-in-Chief of the British General Post Office in 1892. He developed several improvements in railroad signalling system that increased railway safety. Preece and Oliver Lodge maintained a correspondence during this period. Upon Lodge&#x27;s proposal of &quot;loading coils&quot; applied to submerged cables, Preece did not realise that &quot;Earthing&quot; would extend the distance and efficiency.

==Telegraphy==
In 1889 Preece assembled a group of men at Coniston Water in the Lake District in Lancashire and succeeded in transmitting and receiving Morse radio signals over a distance of about 1 mile (1.6 km) across water.

Preece also developed a wireless telegraphy and telephony system in 1892. Preece developed a telephone system and implemented it in England. A similar telephone system was patented in the United States by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876. In 1885, Preece and Arthur West Heaviside (Oliver Heaviside&#x27;s brother) experimented with parallel telegraph lines and an unwired telephone receiver, discovering radio induction (later identified with the effects of crosstalk).

Preece blocked publication of some of Arthur and Oliver Heaviside&#x27;s work. There was a long history of animosity between Preece and Oliver Heaviside. Oliver considered Preece to be mathematically incompetent, an assessment supported by the biographer Paul J. Nahin: &quot;Preece was a powerful government official, enormously ambitious, and in some remarkable ways, an utter blockhead.&quot; Preece&#x27;s motivations in suppressing Heaviside&#x27;s work were more to do with protecting Preece&#x27;s own reputation and avoiding having to admit error than any perceived faults in Heaviside&#x27;s work.

==Radio==
In 1897, with Marconi radio experiments from Lavernock Point in south Wales to the island of Flat Holm, Preece became one of Marconi&#x27;s most ardent supporters. He made various efforts to support Guglielmo Marconi in the wireless field. Preece gained financial assistance from the Post Office to help expand Marconi&#x27;s work. Preece believed incorrectly that the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field was critical in the propagation of radio waves over long distances.

He had a long-standing rivalry with Oliver Heaviside over his understanding of electricity. It was derisively referred to as &quot;the drain-pipe theory&quot; by Heaviside, because Preece relied on an analogy between electricity and water for thought experiments. Reportedly, he rejected and never understood James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s advances to mathematical physics, and insisted that adding inductance to a telegraph line could only be detrimental, even while Maxwell&#x27;s and Heaviside&#x27;s theory and experiments showed that inductance could help.

Preece once stated, conveying sentiments later expressed by Edwin Armstrong, 
Preece served as president of the Institution of Civil Engineers between April 1898 and November 1899.

<text>Sir Peter Tait (5 September 1915 – 31 January 1996) was a New Zealand National Party Member of Parliament, mayor of Napier, small businessman and opponent of New Zealand&#x27;s Homosexual Law Reform Act.

==Early life==

Tait was born on 5 September 1915, in Wellington&#x27;s Island Bay suburb. His family were Scottish immigrants, originally from the Shetland Islands. His father Jack and his uncles Peter and Ross belonged to the best known Shetland fishing families in Island Bay. Through his early life, Tait suffered from tuberculosis, which meant that he was unable to play an active role in New Zealand&#x27;s Second World War effort, nor could he become a Baptist minister.

He recovered from tuberculosis at the Pukeora sanitorium at Waipukurau, a rural community, to the East Coast of the North Island. From there he moved to, and ultimately settled in Napier. Once established there, he opened a shoe store, which came to have branches in Waipukurau, Napier, Hastings and Dannevirke.

He married Lilian Jean Dunn in 1946 with whom he had one son and one daughter.

==Political career==

===Member of Parliament===

In August 1951 he was selected over six other nominees to be the National Party candidate for the Napier electorate. National won a landslide victory at the election and Tait won the Napier seat, somewhat surprisingly as Napier had been a relatively safe Labour seat for decades. Tait served as a Member of Parliament for one term until he was defeated by Labour&#x27;s Jim Edwards. In 1953, he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal.

===Mayor of Napier===
Two years after leaving Parliament, he was elected Mayor of Napier, defeating the incumbent mayor Ron Spriggs. He remained mayor for the next eighteen years until 1974 when he retired. He campaigned on a platform of improving council services and recreational facilities, increasing pensioner housing and tourist promotion. Major projects were completed during his mayoralty including the construction of the National Aquarium of New Zealand and Marineland. The council began cleaning up the inner Ahuriri harbour by shifting sewerage outfall to Awatoto from Perfume Point, the construction of a new Civic Centre and a massive extension of land for housing. Napier also absorbed the Taradale Borough Council after a 1968 amalgamation and Tait secured Napier Airport being designated the main airport for Hawke&#x27;s Bay in preference to the Hastings Aerodrome. Some of his projects caused opposition such as the building of a boating marina in the Ahuriri inner lagoon and a proposal to demolish the iconic Sound Shell.

Tait was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1967 New Year Honours and promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1975 New Year Honours. 

==Later life and death==
After leaving office Tait worked as a financial consultant and was appointed as a financial adviser and professional fundraiser for the Auckland Regional Authority in 1977. Later that year he was appointed chairman of directors of Bowring Burgess Finance.

Tait was a Baptist, who helped to organise the Coalition of Concerned Citizens in the mid-eighties, and argued against homosexual law reform. Together with Keith Hay, the former Mount Roskill, he organised a public petition to oppose the Homosexual Law Reform bill in Parliament. Ultimately, though, the Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986 passed its final reading.

He sold his company Tait Associates Limited to AdvisorCorp, contributory mortgage company he chaired. The company failed in 1988, causing Tait (and his investors) much emotional and financial grief. Tait himself was suspected of corporate fraud in relation to AdvisorCorp however he escaped any prosecution, though two of the principals in the company were successfully prosecuted after AdvisorCorp collapsed. He fought for years afterwards attempting to clear his name. AdvisorCorp, found itself the target of attacks from National Party leader Jim Bolger in the &#x27;Gang of Twenty&#x27; affair in 1989. Bolger would later publicly apologise to Tait.

He funded the Tait Fountain in Napier, which commemorates Victory in Europe Day and was dedicated on 9 May 1995 on the 50th anniversary of the end of that war.

He died in 1996, aged 80. His widow, Lilian, died in 2011.

<text>John Perry (14 February 1850 – 4 August 1920) was a pioneering engineer and mathematician from Ireland.

==Life==
He was born on 14 February 1850 at Garvagh, County Londonderry, the second son of Samuel Perry and a Scottish-born wife. John&#x27;s brother James was the County Surveyor in Galway West and co-founded the Galway Electric Light Company. One of James Perry’s daughters, Alice, was one of the first women in the world with an engineering degree.

Perry worked as Lord Kelvin&#x27;s assistant at the University of Glasgow, and later became professor of mechanical engineering at Finsbury Technical College. He was a colleague of William Edward Ayrton and John Milne at the Imperial College of Engineering in Tokyo, 1875–79, and was also a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was professor of mathematics at Imperial College in London from 1896 to 1913. In 1900 he was elected president of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, and from 1906 to 1908 served as president of the Physical Society of London.

Perry was a great admirer of his employer, Lord Kelvin. In the printing of his 1890 lecture on spinning tops, Perry inscribed the following acknowledgement: &quot;This report of an experimental lecture is inscribed to Sir William Thomson, by his affectionate pupil, the lecturer, who hereby takes a convenient method of acknowledging the real author of whatever is worth publication in the following pages.&quot; The book was later reprinted by Dover Publications in 1957 as &quot;Spinning Tops and Gyroscopic Motions.&quot; Although others (Max Schuler in Germany, Sperry in the USA) had been working on developing practical gyrocompasses, Perry collaborated with Sidney Brown to further develop these and they were awarded : &quot;Gyro-compass&quot; by John Perry, Sidney George Brown, filed August 1917; granted 1919.

Perry received an honorary doctorate (LL.D) from the University of Glasgow in June 1901.

== Challenging Lord Kelvin ==
In 1895, Perry published a paper challenging Kelvin&#x27;s assumption of low thermal conductivity inside the Earth, and thus disputing Kelvin&#x27;s estimate that the Earth was only 20–400 million years old, but this had little impact. It was not until the discovery in 1903 that radioactive decay releases heat and the development a few years later of radiometric dating of rocks that it was accepted that the age of Earth was many times greater, as Perry had argued. Perry&#x27;s reasoning held that if the interior of the Earth was fluid, or partly fluid, it would transfer heat much more effectively than the conductivity which Kelvin assumed, and he stated that &quot;much internal fluidity would practically mean infinite conductivity for our purpose.&quot;

Kelvin rejected this idea as there was no evidence of tidal deformation of the Earth&#x27;s crust, and in response Perry made a reference to Kelvin&#x27;s favourite demonstration of the slow deformation of shoemaker&#x27;s wax to illustrate the supposed qualities of the presumed luminiferous aether thought then to be necessary to transmit light through space. Perry wrote that &quot;the real basis of your calculation is your assumption that the solid earth cannot alter its shape ... even in 1000 million years, under the action of forces constantly tending to alter its shape, and yet we see the gradual closing up of passages in a mine, and we know that wrinkling and faults and other changes of shape are always going on in the earth under the action of long-continued forces. I know that solid rock is not like cobbler&#x27;s wax, but 109 years is a long time, and the forces are great.&quot;

The failure of the scientific community to accept a fluid interior to the Earth held back ideas in geology until the concept was revived by proponents of continental drift, and even in the 1960s geophysical models were still being constructed on the basis that the Earth was solid.

<text>John of Biclaro, Biclar, or Biclarum (&quot;c.&quot; 540 – after 621), also &quot;Iohannes Biclarensis&quot;, was a Visigoth chronicler. He was born in Lusitania, in the city of &quot;Scallabis&quot; (modern Santarém in Portugal). He was also bishop of Girona.

== Early life ==
He was educated at Constantinople, where he devoted between 7-17 years to the study of Latin and Greek. 

== Career ==

=== Imprisonment ===
When he returned to his homeland, he was imprisoned for several years in Barcelona. Isidore of Seville ascribes this to his refusal to join the Arian Church of the Visigothic realm in Hispania.

Modern historians note that other contemporary Iberian sources, including John&#x27;s own &quot;Chronicle&quot; do not attest a Visigothic campaign of persecution of Catholics until the revolt of Hermenegild divided Visigothic loyalties. The Visigothic persecutions of dissenters and Jews may be a more recent Catholic myth. Indeed, John wrote that, in 578, &quot;Leovigild had peace to reside with his own people.&quot;

A more likely reason for John&#x27;s detention was his lengthy stay at Constantinople, with the possibility that he might be a spy for the Byzantine governors in the far south of Iberia. An enforced stay in Barcelona certainly put him out of possible treasonous contact with the Byzantines. John does imply that Arians received favorable treatment under Leovigild, once, in connection with the Arian council convened by Leovigild in 580, where Catholic bishops were ignored.

=== Monastery ===
After Leovigild&#x27;s death in 586, John was released and founded a Benedictine monastery at &quot;Biclaro&quot; (the exact site is undetermined), where he presided as abbot and finished his &quot;Chronicle&quot; (in 590), before he was appointed Catholic Bishop of Girona under the new episcopal government.

=== Bishop ===
John took part in the synods of Zaragoza (592), of Barcelona (599), and of Egara (&quot;Municipium Flavium Egara&quot;) (614). His chronicle, which is a continuation (from 567) of the chronicle of Victor of Tunnuna, in Africa (&quot;Chronicon continuans Victorem Tunnunensem&quot;), reaches to the year 590. It was printed as early as 1600. It is the most complete and reliable authority on Leovigild&#x27;s stormy reign, and on the Visigothic conversion from Arianism to Catholicism.

Three other chronicles cover parts of the Visigothic rule of Hispania: the bishop Hydatius, bishop Isidore of Seville, both of the doctrinally unified Catholic Visigothic establishment, and the fragmentary but apparently secular Chronicle of Zaragoza.

A bishop of Girona known as &quot;Johannes Gerundensis&quot; (&quot;John of Girona&quot;) seems to have been a successor of the chronicler, though some have identified him with the chronicler.

<doc id="862456" wikidata="Q379222" url="?curid=862456" title="Advance Publications">
<text>Advance Publications, Inc. is a privately held American media company owned by the families of Donald Newhouse and Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr., the sons of company founder Samuel Irving Newhouse Sr. It owns publishing-related companies including American City Business Journals, MLive Media Group, and Condé Nast, and is a major shareholder in Charter Communications (13% ownership), Reddit (30% ownership), and Warner Bros. Discovery (8% ownership).

== History ==

The company is named after the &quot;Staten Island Advance&quot;, the first newspaper owned by the Newhouse family, in which Sam Newhouse bought a controlling interest in 1922.

On August 25, 2018, Advance/Newhouse (&quot;A/N&quot;) notified Charter Communications that it intended to establish a credit facility collateralized by a portion of Advance/Newhouse Common Units in Charter Communications Holdings, LLC. That same month, Condé Nast CEO Robert A. Sauerberg Jr. announced his five-year strategy to generate $600 million in new revenue from new revenue streams while driving costs out of the business.

In March 2020, the company acquired The Ironman Group, a mass participation sports platform including the Ironman Triathlons and Absa Cape Epic mountain bike race, from the Wanda Sports Group.

== Description ==

For most of its history, Advance had no official headquarters; most publications listed the &quot;Advance&quot; offices in Staten Island&#x27;s Grasmere neighborhood as its nominal headquarters.

While it did not have a corporate headquarters, Advance operated a press bureau in Washington, D.C.—the Newhouse News Service (NNS). Opened in 1961, NNS served as a national news bureau for all Advance portfolio publications until it closed in late 2008 as a cost-cutting measure due to the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

 Advance was ranked as the 221st largest privately held company in the United States, according to &quot;Forbes&quot;.

== Subsidiaries ==

 the group owns Condé Nast (which includes the magazines &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and &quot;&quot;Wired&quot;)&quot;, The Ironman Group, Turnitin, Advance Local, American City Business Journals, Stage Entertainment, Leaders Group, and the Seattle-based digital agency Pop, Inc., and is a large shareholder in Reddit.

The company holds an 8.16% ownership in media conglomerate Warner Bros. Discovery, carried over from its 31% stake in predecessor Discovery, Inc. Advance also owns a 13% stake (as of 2016) in Charter Communications, which it received when Bright House Networks merged with Charter.

<text>Theodor &quot;Teddy&quot; Kollek (; 27 May 1911 – 2 January 2007) was an Israeli politician who served as the mayor of Jerusalem from 1965 to 1993, and founder of the Jerusalem Foundation. Kollek was re-elected five times, in 1969, 1973, 1978, 1983, and 1989. During his tenure, Jerusalem developed into a modern city, especially after its reunification in 1967. He was once called 

After reluctantly running for a seventh term in 1993 at the age of 82, he lost to Likud candidate and future Prime Minister of Israel Ehud Olmert.

== Early life and marriage ==
Theodor Kollek () was born in Nagy-Vázsony, 120km (75 miles) from Budapest, Hungary. His parents, Alfred and Margaret (), named him after Theodor Herzl. The family moved to Vienna in 1918. Growing up in the Austrian capital city, Kollek came to share his father Alfréd&#x27;s Zionist convictions.
In 1935, three years before the Nazis seized power in Austria, the Kollek family immigrated to British-controlled Mandatory Palestine. In 1937, he was one of the founders of Kibbutz Ein Gev, on the shore of Lake Kinneret. That same year he married Tamar Schwarz (1917–2013). They had two children, a son, the film director Amos Kollek (born in 1947), and a daughter, Osnat.

== Intelligence services ==
=== The &quot;Hunting Season&quot; ===
In 1942 Kollek was appointed the Jewish Agency&#x27;s deputy head of intelligence. Between January 1945 and May 1946 he was the Agency&#x27;s chief external liaison officer in Jerusalem and was in contact with MI5&#x27;s main representative as well as members of British Military Intelligence. In the 1940s, on behalf of the Jewish Agency (Sochnut) and as part of the &quot;Hunting Season&quot; or &quot;Saison&quot;, Teddy Kollek was the Jewish Agency&#x27;s contact person with the British Mandate MI5, providing information against right-wing Jewish underground groups Irgun and Lehi (known as &quot;Stern Gang&quot;). He succeeded Reuven Zaslani and preceded Zeev Sherf in this function, and was carrying out the Jewish Agency&#x27;s policy of assisting the British in fighting these groups. On 10 August 1945, he revealed to MI5 the location of a secret Irgun training camp near Binyamina. Twenty-seven Irgun members were arrested in the raid that followed.

=== Second World War ===
During World War II, Kollek tried to represent Jewish interests in Europe on behalf of the Jewish Agency.

=== Cooperation with the USA ===
In 1947–48, he represented the Haganah in Washington, where he assisted in acquiring ammunition for Israel&#x27;s then-fledgling army.

Kollek was a key figure in creating an alliance between the Mossad and the CIA during the 1940s and 1950s.

== In national politics ==
Kollek became a close ally of David Ben-Gurion, serving in the latter&#x27;s governments from 1952 as the director general of the prime minister&#x27;s office.

== Mayor of Jerusalem ==
In 1965 Teddy Kollek succeeded Mordechai Ish-Shalom as Mayor of Jerusalem. On his motivations for seeking the mayor&#x27;s office in Jerusalem, Kollek once recalled:
During his tenure Jerusalem developed into a modern city, especially after its reunification in 1967. He was once called 

Kollek was re-elected five times, in 1969, 1973, 1978, 1983, and 1989, serving 28 years as mayor of Jerusalem. In a reluctant seventh bid for mayor in 1993, Kollek, aged 82, lost to Likud candidate Ehud Olmert.

=== Relationship with the Arab community ===
In the Six-Day War of 1967, East Jerusalem, which had been under Jordanian control since 1948, was captured by Israel. As mayor of a newly united Jerusalem, Kollek&#x27;s approach toward the Arab inhabitants was governed by pragmatism. Within hours of the transfer of authority, he arranged for the provision of milk for Arab children. Some Israelis considered him pro-Arab. Kollek advocated religious tolerance and made numerous efforts to reach out to the Arab community during his tenure. Muslims continued to have access to Masjid Al-Aqsa (i.e. the Temple Mount) for worship. While he was adamant that Jerusalem never be divided again and remain under Israeli sovereignty, he believed in concessions to reach a final settlement.

Kollek&#x27;s views on the annexation of East Jerusalem softened after leaving office.

=== Civic and cultural projects ===
Kollek dedicated himself to many cultural projects during his lengthy term in office, and served as the founder and head of the Jerusalem Foundation, through which he helped finance the projects. Kollek was also instrumental in the establishment of the Jerusalem Theater.

==== The Israel Museum ====
Kollek&#x27;s most notable cultural project was the development and expansion of the Israel Museum. From 1965 to 1996, he was president of the museum, and officially designated its founder in 2000. When the museum celebrated its 25th anniversary in 1990, Kollek was named &quot;Avi Ha-muze&#x27;on&quot; (&quot;father of the museum&quot;).

Through a leadership which spanned decades, Kollek raised millions of dollars from private donors for civic development projects and cultural programs. Kollek once remarked that Israel needed a strong army, but it also needed expressions of culture and civilization.

==== Jerusalem zoo ====

Kollek was considered the &quot;number-one friend&quot; of the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo, which occupied a site in Romema from 1950 to 1991. Though the zoo attracted many visitors to its exhibits of animals, reptiles and birds mentioned in the Bible and was successful in breeding and protecting endangered species, it was considered small and inferior to zoos in Tel Aviv and Haifa. Kollek promoted the idea of moving the zoo to a larger location and upgrading it to a state-of-the-art institution. Around 1990, under the auspices of the Jerusalem Foundation, the Tisch family of New York agreed to underwrite the expensive undertaking. The zoo re-opened as The Tisch Family Zoological Garden in Jerusalem on a expanse near the neighborhood of Malha in 1993. Kollek helped the zoo raise money to build the elephant enclosure and to bring in female elephants from Thailand at $50,000 apiece. The zoo named its male elephant Teddy and one of its female elephants Tamar in honor of the mayor and his wife.
For Kollek&#x27;s 90th birthday in 2001, the zoo feted him and the Jerusalem Foundation unveiled a new sculpture garden dedicated in his honor.

== Retirement and death ==
Kollek continued to be active in retirement, maintaining a five-day work week into his nineties, even as he became increasingly infirm. He and his wife lived in their walk-up Rehavia apartment until the mid-1990s, when they moved to Hod Yerushalayim, a retirement home in the Kiryat HaYovel neighborhood.
Kollek died on 2 January 2007. He is buried at the Mount Herzl national cemetery, Jerusalem.

== 1979–81 ==

=== Solo and with various New York rock bands ===
* &quot;No Running in the City&quot; and &quot;All My Love&quot; appear on a 1979 acoustic, solo demo tape alongside early versions of &quot;Simon Says&quot;, &quot;Shine A Light&quot; (introduced as &quot;Hear Me&quot;), &quot;Little Boy Lost&quot;, &quot;Safe Neighbourhood&quot;, &quot;Love Express&quot;, three instrumentals and two takes of an unknown and un-named song. The tape originates from the post-Breakfast Club / pre-Emmy period when Madonna was recruiting musicians for her own ensemble. The full story of the tape – remarkable as it is performed almost entirely solo with Madonna playing guitar and singing – appears in the March 2009 issue of UK magazine &quot;Record Collector&quot; and was featured on MSNBC.
* &quot;Born to Be a Dancer&quot;, an alternate version of &quot;Over &amp; Over&quot;, &quot;Tell the Truth&quot; and &quot;I Got Trouble (Roll Over It)&quot; taken from Dan and Ed Gilroy&#x27;s private tapes (1979). Audio excerpts were made available by Andrew Morton on &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; news-reporting and opinion website in 2009 as &quot;The Gilroys&#x27; Lost Madonna Tapes&quot;. Another song not made available; &quot;Trouble&quot; is remembered by Ed Gilroy as the first song Madonna wrote (instead of &quot;Tell the Truth&quot;, as Madonna recalls).
* &quot;(I Like) Love for Tender&quot;, &quot;No Time for Love&quot;, &quot;Bells Ringing&quot; and &quot;Drowning&quot; are all featured on Madonna&#x27;s studio demo tape with the band Emmy and the Emmy&#x27;s in 1980. Other Emmy tracks such as &quot;Simon Says&quot; are not included here because they were either live recordings or already legally released on a small indie label. They belong listed on the Madonna discography page. NOTE: A studio version of &quot;Simon Says&quot; is included on the Shamrock Tape. See below for corrected track listing. &quot;Do You?&quot; and &quot;Hothouse Flower&quot; were performed in an art film of which excerpts have been shown on TV.
* &quot;Tell the Truth&quot; and &quot;Hothouse Flower&quot; and &quot;Simon Says&quot; and &quot;I Got Trouble (Roll Over It)&quot; and &quot;Oh Oh (The Sky Is Blue)&quot; and &quot;Nobody Wants to Be Alone (Once I Thought I Was Good)&quot; and &quot;Well Well&quot; – early recordings recorded on the &quot;Shamrock&quot; reel-to-reel tape. It was recently auctioned to a private owner. &quot;Tell the Truth&quot; was allegedly the very first song Madonna ever recorded (with the help of Dan Gilroy of the band The Breakfast Club). In 2005 Madonna sang the chorus of &quot;Tell the Truth&quot; during an interview with Parkinson on UK TV. She also discussed writing the song in Rolling Stone magazine (October 2009).
* &quot;Take Me (I Want You)&quot;, &quot;Best Girl&quot; and &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot;, with Emmy And The Emmys. Demo recordings of &quot;Take Me (I Want You)&quot; have leaked online. Live versions of &quot;Best Girl&quot; and &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot; songs have also leaked, along with live versions of other Emmy-era tracks (already mentioned) from this period.
* &quot;Prisoner&quot;, &quot;Head Over Heels&quot;, &quot;Get Away&quot; and &quot;Call on Me&quot; – possible early recordings from the Emmys era; those titles are listed on a hand-written set-list spotted in some pictures of a 1980/1981 live gig, taken by photographer George DuBose. Those pictures are famous among collectors as being related to the Underground Club performance. There is actually no evidence that Madonna recorded those songs on tape, they could be compositions written and intended just for live concerts; some audio-tape from rehearsals (featuring those songs) may or may not exist. The existence of these tracks has been confirmed as being on the actual set-list. Those Underground Club pictures can be seen in a large number of fan sites&#x27; photo-galleries and even on George DuBose&#x27;s official site.
* &quot;We Live in a House&quot;, written by Josh Braun, Janis Galloway and Madonna in 1982. US copyright registration # PAu-1-843-482. It was recorded with the second incarnation of the band Spinal Root Gang, which co-writer Josh Braun founded with his twin brother and his father in the early 80s, as he explained interviewed in 2017. In the interview Braun says he met Madonna when she was rehearsing with Emmy at the Music Building in New York, and that by coincidence around the same time she rented a room to Braun senior in the Upper East Side. Josh Braun&#x27;s father wanted to put a new version of Spinal Root Gang together with Madonna as a singer. She asked if her friend Janis Galloway could be part of the band too and they agreed. Josh says they wrote &quot;We Live in a House&quot; together and recorded a demo with his father playing saxophone and Madonna as the only singer, since for some reason she said Janis that the scheduled recording wasn&#x27;t happening. Sample lyric: &quot;We live in a house, and people just don&#x27;t care. We live in a house, they don&#x27;t go anywhere.&quot; Madonna screams at one point: &quot;You can&#x27;t come into my house.&quot;
* &quot;The Sky Is Blue&quot;. Written and performed by Madonna. The song appears on a cassette auctioned in Invaluable.com. In the overview, Dan Gilroy remembers: &quot;This cassette has a very early Madonna song that she wrote and sings alone, playing the Carlo Rbelli acoustic guitar. It&#x27;s possible that no one else has ever heard this song. Her handwriting is on the cassette. This cassette has 2 performances of Madonna singing &quot;The Sky Is Blue.&quot;
* &quot;Kiss Me&quot;, &quot;Coming in Fine&quot;, &quot;Moving Along&quot;, &quot;Hot House Flower&quot;, &quot;While My Baby Walks the Streets&quot;, &quot;Tears in My Eye&quot;, &quot;Coming in Fine&quot;, &quot;I Wonder What Happened to Her&quot;, &quot;Letter from Daddy&quot;, &quot;Hurry Hurry Hurry&quot;, and &quot;Song for Danny&quot; are featured on a cassette auctioned by Invaluable.com. All songs written by Madonna.
* &quot;Bird Free&quot;, &quot;Trouble&quot;, &quot;Shine a Light&quot;, and &quot;Tell the Truth&quot; are featured on a cassette auctioned by Invaluable.com.
* &quot;Curtis Come Back&quot;, &quot;Glad You Were Born&quot;, &quot;Trouble&quot;, &quot;Hot House Flower&quot;, &quot;Give It a Try&quot;, &quot;Born to be a Dancer&quot;, &quot;Even My Tears Run Away from Me&quot;, and &quot;Again and Again&quot; are featured on a Vintage Shamrock Recording Reel tape auctioned by Invaluable.com. Madonna sings, plays drums and guitar. 
* &quot;Say hey, Joe&quot; is featured along with &quot;Curtis Come Back&quot;, &quot;Again and Again&quot;, &quot;Trouble&quot;, and &quot;Hot House Flower&quot; in a cassette auctioned by Invaluable.com.

=== Solo vocal recordings ===
* &quot;I Want You&quot;, &quot;Love on the Run&quot;, &quot;Get Up&quot; and &quot;High Society&quot;, a Pat Benatar style pop-rock Madonna demo produced under the direction of Madonna&#x27;s first manager Camille Barbone of August Artists Ltd and Gotham Sound Studios in New York City with guitarist Jon Gordon in 1981. All four of these tracks have leaked on the internet in high quality. Two more songs were recorded at Mediasound Studios but not used on the 1981 demo circulating at the time called &quot;Remembering Your Touch&quot; and &quot;Are You Ready For It&quot; which are also reasonably easily available for internet download.
* &quot;Shake Your Head (Let&#x27;s Go To Bed)&quot; Madonna recorded lead vocal with Don and David for the Was (Not Was) album &quot;Born to Laugh at Tornadoes&quot; produced in Detroit in 1982–83. The released vocal were by Ozzy Osbourne with backing vocals by Kathy Kosins and Carol Hall. Madonna and John &quot;Jellybean&quot; Benitez are both in the album credits. During a May 2006 Kathy Kosins phone interview with Bruce Baron it was revealed that Ozzy recorded his vocal first. Kathy and Carol added vocals in Detroit. Kathy&#x27;s vocals were intended to be replaced by Madonna by producer Don Was. Madonna&#x27;s label Sire Records did not agree to the release and Kathy&#x27;s vocals were restored for the ZE Records release as a backing track. Kathy then became a longtime Was (not Was) contributor. Madonna originally became involved via her friendship with Stephen Bray and his group The Breakfast Club who were also signed with ZE Records (later acquired by MCA). Madonna requested her original vocal not to be used in an early 1990s remix released as a single in Europe to support a Was (Not Was) Greatest Hits album. Kim Basinger did the new vocals. The 1990s remix version with Madonna&#x27;s vocals leaked onto the internet in April 2008.
* &quot;Sidewalk Talk&quot;, written by Madonna for former producer and boyfriend John &quot;Jellybean&quot; Benitez. The 1983 commercially released version features vocalist Catherine Buchanan on lead vocals and Madonna singing on the chorus and bridge. The original demo version with Madonna on the lead vocal remains unreleased and was produced with Stephen Bray as confirmed by interviews.
* &quot;Afterglo&quot;, &quot;Rock Your Body&quot;, &quot;Girl with Stars in Her Eyes&quot;, &quot;Swing with Me&quot; and &quot;Cherish&quot;. In early 2011 several other previously unknown songs came to light penned by Madonna via handwritten lyric sheets on an auction site. Cherish is different from the song of the same title from the Like A Prayer album released in 1989. To date, these songs have not been released.

== 1982–89 ==

=== &quot;Madonna&quot; ===
* &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Big Deal&quot; The released version was produced by Reggie Lucas in 1982 and appeared as the B-side of her &quot;True Blue&quot; single in 1986, though this is an alternate version to the unreleased version mentioned above. Originally intended to be Madonna&#x27;s first single. Three more separate unreleased studio versions were also produced each by Mark Kamins, Stephen Bray and John &quot;Jellybean&quot; Benitez. They were all shelved by Sire Records when the song was recorded and released in 1983 by the female disco act Barracuda on 12-inch vinyl Epic Records release 49-04264. &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Big Deal&quot; was included in the US compilation album &quot;Revenge of the Killer B&#x27;s, Vol. 2&quot;. On June 12, 2024, the song was released onto digital platforms as a B-side to &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot;.
* &quot;Physical Attraction&quot;, US copyright registration PAu-484-430 from February 1983 credits words and music created in 1982 only to Madonna as sole author as does April 1983 publisher transfer registration PAu-506-929. Producer Reggie Lucas is not credited as the sole author of this song until 1984 registration PA-210-598 for the 12&quot; commercial single release for the work created and published in 1983 and has been the only credited songwriter since.
* &quot;Writer&#x27;s Block&quot;, listed in the MCPS-PRS database as being written by Madonna and Richard Lewis Warren for the 1984 TV show &quot;Cover Up&quot; starring Jon Erik-Hexum and Jennifer O&#x27;Neill. An episode by this name first aired on November 24, 1984 (Season 1, Episode 7) without crediting either Madonna or Richard Lewis Warren. However, that episode does include &quot;Lucky Star&quot; which means this entry is most likely an error in the database.

=== &quot;Vision Quest&quot; soundtrack ===
* &quot;Warning Signs&quot;, the third Madonna song recorded for the soundtrack to the film but never used. It remains unheard by the public to this day. A collaboration with Stephen Bray from 1984, US copyright registration# PAu-590-962. Bray describes it as a cool synth track. The lyric sheet reveals the opening intro as &quot;I see danger up ahead&quot;, &quot;Warning (echo), Warning (echo)&quot;. Chorus is &quot;Warning I see danger up ahead. I can see it in your eyes, and it&#x27;s really no surprise. Because, I can see your warning signs&quot;. Supposed complete lyrics for the song have surfaced online on various lyric websites.

=== &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; ===
* &quot;(title uncertain)&quot;, Simon Le Bon of the group Duran Duran mentioned in a mid-1980s interview for the BBC TV show &quot;Breakfast&quot; that Madonna did backing vocals for them that were never released. On Duran Duran&#x27;s official website in the &#x27;Ask Katy&#x27; section the band members denied that Madonna ever recorded backing vocals on any of their tracks.
* &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot;, written by Madonna and Stephen Bray. Unreleased title track for the Orion Pictures movie of the same name according to former Madonna collaborator Stephen Bray from 1999 interview. Another &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot; title song was written by Michael Bramon. &quot;Into the Groove&quot; overshadowed both &quot;Susan&quot; themes, and both were shelved.

=== &quot;True Blue&quot; ===
* &quot;Working My Fingers to the Bone&quot; and &quot;Pipeline&quot;, recorded with frequent collaborator Stephen Bray.
* &quot;Spotlight&quot;, original version 1985 US copyright registration PAu-716-379 written in 1984. Curtis Hudson &amp; Lisa Stevens. Stevens&#x27;s demo version sounds remarkably like &quot;Holiday&quot; which she also co-wrote. Madonna and Stephen Bray changed lyrics and music to this in 1985 via copyright registration PAu-924-278. The demo also has a different rhythm and chorus melody. Sample lyric &quot;Spotlight shine on you. Be what you want to be, do what you want to do&quot; and &quot;Spotlight shine so bright, spotlight shine tonight&quot;. A short clip of the demo version is available on the internet.
* &quot;(title(s) unknown)&quot;, musician Fred Zarr tried to write two or three songs with Madonna around the time of &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; but never finished.
* &quot;Each Time You Break My Heart&quot;, written and produced by Madonna and Stephen Bray. Nick Kamen later recorded his version of this song with Madonna as backing vocals. It was a big hit in Europe (number 1 in Italy, number 5 in the UK in November 1986). Madonna&#x27;s version has appeared on various file-sharing networks. Bray described Madonna&#x27;s demo in an interview with Bruce Baron for Goldmine Magazine as &quot;virtually unchanged from the version later recorded and released by Nick Kamen&quot;.
* &quot;Tell Me&quot; Stephen Bray confirmed the existence of this demo with Madonna singing as the lead vocal; in the &quot;Extended version&quot;, Nick Kamen sings lead vocals and Madonna sings backing vocals and a solo.
* &quot;I Want You&quot; Stephen Bray confirmed the existence of this unreleased track in an interview with Madonna music expert, Peter Magennis in 2009. To date this song has never been leaked.

=== &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; ===
* &quot;Possessive Love&quot;, written and recorded with Patrick Leonard, Madonna and Jai Winding. CMRRA database# 875911 Madonna&#x27;s original demo was given to singer Marilyn Martin for her to record. The song was included on her 1988 album &quot;This is Serious&quot;. The song was also released as a single by Atlantic Records in 1988 but did not do very well. ASCAP title code #460268111
* &quot;Love Attack&quot; and &quot;First Is a Kiss&quot; Two songs Madonna recorded and produced with Stephen Bray but were never used. In 1989 Madonna talked in a Bravo magazine about &quot;First Is a Kiss&quot; as explaining that it is a song about the friends she lost because of AIDS. A short excerpt of &quot;Love Attack&quot; leaked to the Internet.
* &quot;Just A Dream&quot; (original Madonna demo) Written by Madonna and Patrick Leonard. Given later to her long-time backing vocalist Donna De Lory for her MCA self-titled debut solo album. Madonna does appear on backing vocals, but the original Madonna lead vocal recording remains unreleased. DeLory&#x27;s version did manage to crack the US Dance Club Play Chart.
* &quot;Angels With Dirty Faces&quot; Bruce Gaitsch, co-writer of &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; and guitarist on &quot;True Blue&quot; and &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; alluded to the fact that he was involved with this unreleased track in an interview with Madonna music expert, Peter Magennis in 2006. &quot;I have a tape somewhere of some songs I had to learn parts from and none of these songs are on it. But there is a song called Angels with Dirty Faces on it that is killer&quot;. On July 11, 2017, the co-writer of the track, Patrick Leonard, shared a 20 second video clip of the song on his official Instagram page. On July 22, 2019, Patrick Leonard published the full demo on his YouTube channel after discovering that someone had sold it at an auction.
*&quot;I Surrender Dear&quot; was recorded for the 1989 film, &quot;Bloodhounds of Broadway&quot;, where Madonna sang it with actress Jennifer Grey, but the song was not included in the soundtrack and has never appeared on any legally published records.

== 1990–99 ==

=== &quot;I&#x27;m Breathless and The Immaculate Collection&quot; ===
* &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, written by Patrick Leonard. This did not appear on the &quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot; album. ASCAP title code# 340325268. Another &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; performed by Madonna is listed in the APRA database id code# GW04472893 and was written solely by Daniel Elfman.
* &quot;Dog House&quot; Another title reported in &quot;Billboard magazine&quot; circa 1990 for the film &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;. A song titled &quot;You&#x27;re in the Dog House Now&quot; performed by Brenda Lee and co-written by Andy Paley was included on the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; soundtrack. This is a possible replacement for the Madonna recorded track, considering the precedents of Madonna&#x27;s own recordings of &quot;Now I&#x27;m Following You&quot; which was replaced in the film by a version sung by co-writer Andy Paley, and &quot;Back In Business&quot; being replaced by a same-titled track by Stephen Sondheim.
* Various &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; demos – Leaked on 7-inch bootleg vinyl in the early-1990s at record collector shows under the name of &quot;MA-HONEY&quot;. Rehearsal sound quality is rather poor and the printed jacket track listing was incorrect and is corrected as follows &quot;More&quot;, &quot;I Always Get My Man&quot; (actually &quot;Sooner or Later&quot;), &quot;What Can You Get&quot; (actually &quot;What Can You Lose&quot;, sung by Madonna only (ie without her duet partner Mandy Patinkin)). These recordings (which included two different versions of &#x27;I Always Get My Man&#x27; and a demo version of &#x27;Now I&#x27;m Following You&#x27;) were included on a bootleg album called &#x27;Calendar Girl&#x27; in 1991. This album is credited to a &quot;B. Mahoney&quot; and includes the official Color Mix of &quot;True Blue&quot;, four songs from the Blond Ambition Tour live in Barcelona, the faux-Madonna track &#x27;Lies in Your Eyes&#x27;, and a recording of Madonna singing &quot;Santa Baby&quot; taken from the &quot;A Very Special Christmas&quot; compilation released in 1987.
* &quot;To Love You&quot;, written by Madonna and Andy Paley. Listed in the Warner-Chappel database but remains unreleased. The demo was re-recorded in 1994 but it is unreleased too. The supposed full lyrics for this song have been published on several song lyric websites.
* &quot;Get Over&quot;, recorded with Stephen Bray around the time of the Immaculate Collection. (It was going to be the third new song on the greatest hits album.) Madonna&#x27;s demo version remains unreleased. The song was later recorded and released by actor/model Nick Scotti with Madonna backing vocals produced by Madonna and Shep Pettibone for the film &quot;Nothing But Trouble&quot; in 1992. Listed as song #301415 in the CMRRA database. It was also included on Nick Scotti&#x27;s self-titled debut album, and released as a single.

=== &quot;Erotica&quot; ===
* &quot;Dear Father&quot;, an unreleased collaboration with André Betts and Mic Murphy (former member of duo The System). An uptempo dance track. Part of the lyrics include: &quot;Dear Father forgive me/ I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ve done...&quot; The song appears in the EMI Music publishing database and in the UK based MCPS system. APRA id# GW09823950. This demo leaked in its entirety online in June 2008.
* &quot;Love Hurts&quot; – A unique song title listed in the discography of producer/remixer Junior Vasquez. See Junior Vasquez Music Site. This is an early version of ‘Erotica’ with a different chorus and slightly altered lyrics (“I’ll hit you like a Mack truck” compared to the official version’s “I’ll hit you like a truck.”) Leaked to the internet in March 2017. 
* &quot;You Are The One&quot;, U.S. copyright registration# PAu-1-605-636 Song from &quot;The Rain Tapes&quot; written by Madonna, Shep Pettibone and Tony Shimkin not used on the album. The lyrics include, &quot;You are the one, my only one – you are the one for me&quot;. The sound is very dance/club/house. It was abandoned in the demo stage. On December 19, the complete lyrics leaked onto the Internet. The refrain runs, &quot;You (you) are the one (are the one), Make me feel, Our love is alive...&quot; A fake fan-made version leaked on the fake &quot;Rain Tapes&quot;. The full demo leaked online on July 27, 2014.
* &quot;Shame&quot;, U.S. copyright registration# PAu-1-605-637 and separate ASCAP registration# 491644325. Also a CMRRA song registration# 1776484 Song from &quot;The Rain Tapes&quot; not used on the album. The song opens with a spoken intro, &quot;Why do you wanna waste your life away? It&#x27;s a shame.&quot; Later she sings, &quot;Anyone can learn to fly, keep your head up...&quot; She also says, &quot;You&#x27;ve got no one to blame.&quot; The chorus starts with &quot;It&#x27;s a Shaaaaaame&quot;, which sounds similar to the song of the same title and time period by Monie Love. This is possibly the source of the rumor that she and Madonna were going to do something together. The similarity ends there, with Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Shame&quot; breaking off into its own unique melody. A 20-second clip has leaked on the Internet. On December 19, the complete lyrics were leaked. The full demo leaked online on July 27, 2014.
* &quot;Goodbye to Innocence&quot;, alternate version written and produced by Madonna, Shep Pettibone and Tony Shimkin. U.S. copyright registration# PAu-1-605-640 – This is very different from the commercially released remixed version which appeared on the various artists collection &quot;Just Say Roe&quot; and in a further revised dub from as &quot;Up Down Suite&quot; as one of the B-sides for the &quot;Rain&quot; single. The unreleased demo versions use the same theme and many of the same lyrics, but everything is switched around. It is a different vocal recording (strong-and-clear unlike the commercial mix). Much of the song&#x27;s melody is different including the chorus. The arrangement is pure pop-funk-dance, no club remix style here. Extra lyrics include the spoken line: &quot;Goodbye to innocence, , peace of mind..&quot; The chorus includes: &quot;You know you&#x27;d better stop, stop and think...&quot; A full demo of this song leaked onto the Internet in February 2008. Another version with similar arrangements to Fever is available on the internet.
* &quot;Actions Speak Louder Than Words&quot; (two alternate demo versions) – Both versions are without the eastern instrument found in the released version simply called &quot;Words&quot;. Instead the synth keys that are found at the end of the commercial mix are used during the chorus. There is also a subtle guitar-like sound. Additional lyrics include &quot;I can&#x27;t fight with your words, they come disguised as love, but your words are so cruel&quot;, and &quot;I can&#x27;t fight with your words, they pretend to be kind, but your words are for fools&quot;. The backing vocals and bridge arrangements are slightly different. U.S. copyright office registration PAu-1-605-641. As with most of the Rain Tapes tracks, fakes are in circulation which have no relevance to the authentic demos. Finally, one of the real demos leaked online on September 26, 2019.
* &quot;Erotica&quot; (unreleased demo). U.S. copyright registration PAu-1-605-642 – Known among fans as &quot;You Thrill Me&quot; since these words are contained in the alternate lyrics. Madonna incorporated this demo into the version of Erotica that she performed on her 2006 Confessions Tour. It is significantly different from the released album version. The verse lyrics are the same as those used on the album, though there is no trace of the familiar chorus lyric &quot;Erotic, Erotic, put your hands all over my body&quot;. Instead Madonna sings a different chorus line with a different melody in the same type of voice that ends with the line:
:&quot;...You are who you are...and I
:Wouldn&#x27;t want to change a thing...in spite of
:All the pain that love can bring...
:Tell me, what can I do? I&#x27;m so in love with you.
:You thrill me, surround me, you fill me
:You send me, you put me in a trance
:You fill me, inside of me, you take me
:You thrill me, you put me in a trance.&quot;

:The instrumentation is approximately the same as the commercial mix but the released mix is more distinctive, more complex, and more exotic. The Rough Mix includes the complete refrain, &quot;Erotica, romance, I&#x27;d like to put you in a trance...&quot;. A full demo of this song, called &quot;Final Demo 2&quot;, leaked onto the internet in February 2008.
* &quot;Jitterbug&quot; (song fragment, about 30–45 seconds) – Included on &quot;The Rain Tapes&quot; cassette tapes submitted by Shep Pettibone to the U.S. copyright office. It was mostly taped over, but showed up between two of the other tracks. It is listed on the handwritten tape label, but it has no copyright registration of its own. The title was originally spelled with a &quot;G&quot;, but was written over darker with a &quot;J&quot; in blue ink. It features typical generic Shep Pettibone dance music with Madonna finishing up with &quot;Jitterbug, Jitterbug&quot;. Madonna stops singing but the music continues, and she can be heard asking: &quot;Is this gonna go on forever and ever? Somebody end this dance lesson.&quot; The music abruptly stops. She then says into the microphone: &quot;There were some cute ideas there.&quot; A fake is in circulation which uses a Cathy Dennis instrumental and a peculiar vocal which seems to be a recreation of the word &quot;Jitterbug&quot; using the relevant vowels and consonants from other Madonna songs as well as an excerpt from Truth Or dare – &quot;Do I have to listen to this?&quot; In 2011, Tony Shimkin, co-producer of the track, confirmed in an interview that this song was intended to be featured in &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; together with &quot;This Used to Be My Playground&quot;. However, it was abandoned because, as Shimkin states: &quot;we were in the middle of so many other things at the time and maybe there wasn’t a necessity for it in the movie.&quot; Leaked onto the internet in September 2019.
* &quot;Thief of Hearts&quot; (alternate demo versions) U.S. copyright registration# PAu-1-605-643 – Uses slightly different intro, bridge and outro arrangements. One version has what was eventually the end of the song placed at the beginning. One uses the voice of a southern black woman to say the line &quot;sit your ass down&quot; instead of Madonna herself as done on the commercial release, and Madonna is briefly heard laughing immediately after. A full-length version of one of the demos – Old Music – became available on file-sharing networks in February 2008. The others in circulation are, as before, fakes. The &#x27;New Music&#x27; demo leaked in September 2019.
* &quot;Secret Garden (Demo Version)&quot;, demo version of the released last album track. It features same lyrics and music, but the vocals are stronger and clearer, with some alternate music choice, i.e. in some points there&#x27;s only the bass line and Madonna&#x27;s voice. It clocks 3&#x27;47, and has been available on peer-to-peer sharing software since July 2008.

=== &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; ===
* &quot;Something&#x27;s Coming Over Me&quot; – The unreleased original version of the song &quot;Secret&quot; written and produced with Shep Pettibone and then abandoned. US copyright registration# PAu-1-889-253. This version does not have the downbeat guitar R&amp;B vibe of the released song. During the unique bridge of the unreleased demo the music drops out and Madonna speaks: &quot;I see your love coming down...&quot; Then the bass and the drum kick back up in club anthem style where she sings: &quot;Something&#x27;s coming over me...&quot; Shep Pettibone later did get co-writing credit for &quot;Secret&quot; due to this initial work which he did not originally get when the album &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; was first released in 1994.
* &quot;I Will Always Have You&quot; – The unreleased original version of what became the released song &quot;Inside Of Me&quot; recorded with Shep Pettibone and then abandoned. US copyright registration# PAu-1-889-251. This ballad sounds more like the familiar style of &quot;Crazy for You&quot; or &quot;You&#x27;ll See&quot; than what later became the soft, lullaby-like released version. The released song&#x27;s theme is all about Madonna cherishing the memory of a loved one, but in this demo she also wants to be the object of the song to also be remembered. The words &quot;inside of me&quot; are hardly used but many of the same lyrics are switched around. The melody is significantly different from the released version.
* &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Be Your Lover (feat. Tupac Shakur)&quot;, an alternate version of the song where, instead of Me&#x27;Shell NdegeOcello rapping the breakdown, Tupac is rapping. This version was originally meant to be released, but was scrapped due to serious criminal charges brought against the late rapper and since the album was to present a kinder, more gentle Madonna, any unnecessary controversy was best avoided. Leaked to the internet in November 2009.
* &quot;Love Won&#x27;t Wait&quot; (original 1994 demo), a song abandoned and not used on the &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; album. Madonna and Shep Pettibone later gave it to former Take That singer Gary Barlow. It was not written specifically for him. He received a demo tape with that song including her lead and backing vocals. The unreleased Madonna demo is US copyright registration# PAu-1-889-250. The demo leaked onto file-sharing services from sources unknown around the year 2000. Madonna&#x27;s version has a strong clear vocal with bubblegum instrumentation that vaguely sounds like synth-Motown.
* &quot;Bring It&quot;, written and produced by Madonna and Shep Pettibone but never released. US copyright registration# PAu-1-889-252. Partial lyric reads: &quot;I know your love is bad for me, but I won&#x27;t give up until you bring it to me.&quot;
* &quot;Goodtime&quot; and &quot;Tongue Tied&quot;, listed in the Warner/Chappell Music database, along with &quot;Bring It&quot;. All three songs are listed as written by Madonna and Shep Pettibone, copyright ASCAP.
* &quot;Right On Time&quot;, written by Madonna and Dallas Austin. Listed in the European MCPS database. APRA id# GW0916567.

=== &quot;Something to Remember&quot; ===
* &quot;I Can&#x27;t Forget&quot; An unreleased collaboration with David Foster. Recorded with two other released songs for the &quot;Something to Remember&quot; retrospective album but this one was never used. BMI work# 2133633 published by Peermusic Ltd. and Warner/Chappell Music. The song was later recorded by Tilt. They released their version titled &quot;Come Closer&quot; on their 2006 album &quot;Vaults&quot;. Madonna is credited as writer of the song. The song was also given to Canadian singer Angelica DiCastro for her album &quot;Beautiful Feeling&quot;. The song is credited to David Foster and Madonna. A couple of clips from Madonna&#x27;s demo version leaked onto the internet on September 26, 2008. On February 17, 2010, Madonna&#x27;s demo version leaked to the internet in full.
* &quot;You&#x27;ll Stay&quot;, written with Patrick Leonard and appeared in publishing records. Also found at the APRA site, song id# GW15524580.
* &quot;Indian Summer&quot;, written in 1995. Found as ID #GW14567699. A short excerpt of the song was used in a 1995 Japanese Takara commercial, with the slogan &quot;Takara Jun Legend&quot;. Lyrics include &quot;How can I be pure (how can I be pure)&quot;, &quot;All the strength I have, is breaking me&quot;, &quot;How can I be sure (How can I be sure)&quot;, &quot;Where the road I chose, is taking me.&quot;

=== &quot;Ray of Light&quot; ===
Unreleased demos recorded for the album &quot;Ray of Light&quot; written with Rick Nowels.
The CMRRA has Madonna, Rick Nowels and Greg Fitzgerald:
* &quot;Be Careful&quot;, written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard only, APRA song id# GW23038624. A possible early version of the song &quot;Be Careful (Cuidado Con Mi Corazon)&quot; recorded with Ricky Martin and William Orbit, APRA song id# GW1552449. Leonard is not credited on the released Madonna-Orbit version with Ricky Martin but he has his own separate Madonna-Leonard documented entry in the Warner-Chappell publishing database. Oddly, the CMRRA lists them all, along with Susan Leonard, as co-writers together on one song work# 732670. The ASCAP database lists only Madonna and William Orbit as writers, with the song listed as &quot;Cuidado Con Mi Corazon&quot;. In September 2010, another supposed demo leaked. This file was titled &quot;Corazon&quot; and contains Madonna singing over typical William Orbit synths. This may in fact be a fan creation and not a real demo recording as the music appears to be sampled from William Orbit&#x27;s single &quot;Dice&quot; for Finley Quaye in collaboration with Beth Orton.
* &quot;Gone, Gone, Gone&quot; – Song from the early stages of &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; in 1997, when Orbit wasn&#x27;t asked yet for the album. The song appeared on the internet. Sometimes the song is also called &quot;Gone Gone Gone (This Love Affair Is Over)&quot;.
* &quot;Like A Flower&quot; – CMRRA song registration# 888544. The demo of this song leaked onto the Internet around 2003. It was later given to Italian singer Laura Pausini for her 2004 album &quot;Resta In Ascolto&quot; (Italian for &quot;Remain listening!&quot;) and re-titled &quot;Mi Abbandono A Te&quot; (Italian for &quot;I Give Up on You&quot;). ASCAP song registration# 431644652; CMRRA song registration# 1012340. This song was recorded also in Spanish with the title &quot;Me Abandono A Ti&quot; for the Spanish version of &quot;Resta In Ascolto&quot; named &quot;Escucha&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Listen!&quot;).
* &quot;No Substitute For Love&quot;, the original name for what became &quot;Drowned World/Substitute For Love&quot; with different lyrics, vocal melody and instrumentation. The chorus starting: &quot;Face the truth, no substitute for love&quot;. The song is also without the San Sebastian Strings sample of &quot;Why I Follow the Tigers&quot; that is present in the released version. This version has leaked onto the internet.
* &quot;Regfresando,&quot; a Madonna and Patrick Leonard collaboration of unknown origin, listed in the Warner-Chappell database as &quot;Regfresando&quot;. APRA song id# GW19069760. The never released title might actually be a misspelling for the Spanish word &quot;Regresando&quot; which translates to English as meaning &quot;Returning&quot;. Until additional information is provided, the inclusion of the letter &quot;f&quot; in the original word spelling is thought by many fans to be nonsensical and probably listed incorrectly in the publisher database.
* &quot;Revenge&quot; – CMRRA song registration# 742435. The song was one of the early demos of the Ray Of Light album from 1997, produced by Greg Fitzgerald and Rick Nowells before William Orbit&#x27;s involvement in the project. In 2002 it was rumored to be the new recorded song from Madonna for the James Bond movie, and the leaked demo even got some airplay. In early 2005 it was also rumored to be Madonna&#x27;s new single from her then upcoming album Confessions On A Dancefloor. The song has since been recorded by English singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor, as revealed by Peter Magennis in an interview with Greg Fitzgerald for his July 2008 cover feature for UK magazine, Record Collector (issue #351). A vinyl acetate exists, the version is 3 minutes 45 seconds.
* &quot;You&#x27;ll Stay,&quot; a variation of &quot;Like A Flower&quot; produced by Patrick Leonard. The song leaked in February 2019.
* &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Gone&quot; and &quot;Never Love A Stranger&quot; produced by Babyface. Both songs leaked in 2019.
* &quot;Flirtation Dance&quot;, an early version of &quot;Skin&quot; produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard.

== 2000–09 ==

=== &quot;Music&quot; ===
* &quot;Alone Again&quot;, a Madonna co-write with Rick Nowels, CMRRA song registration# 1775314. A song widely publicised in the media in 2002 as having been recorded by Kylie Minogue. The Minogue version was supposed to be the B-side to her &quot;Come into My World&quot; single, but the song remained unreleased until it was featured in the Kylie documentary &quot;White Diamond&quot;, which premiered on October 16, 2007. Madonna and Rick Nowels are credited as writers. Madonna is also thanked in the credits of the film. Madonna has two ASCAP entries for this song. Her own version remains unreleased.
* &quot;Like an Angel Passing Through My Room&quot; Madonna and Orbit covered this ABBA song during the Music sessions. The demo and the Orbit instrumental leaked onto the internet on August 15, 2008.
* &quot;Little Girl&quot; and &quot;La Petite Jeune Fille&quot; (translation: &quot;The Little Girl&quot;) Written and produced with William Orbit, recorded during the &quot;Music&quot; sessions. The original ballad &quot;Little Girl&quot; leaked onto the internet on September 18, 2010. An early demo instrumental version of the song, with the title of &#x27;Dear Pumpkin&#x27; leaked onto the internet in April 2011. Confirmed ASCAP title codes 420566552. 420566570 and 430653519. The second version of the song, &quot;La Petite Jeune Fille&quot; with similar lyrics, is an up-tempo dance song (resembling &quot;Runaway Lover&quot; from the same album) and leaked on the internet on December 14, 2011. A William Orbit produced alternate demo also leaked in April 2021.
* &quot;Liquid Love&quot;, co-written and produced by William Orbit, originates from late 1999, presumably from the same sessions that yielded &quot;Amazing&quot; and &quot;Runaway Lover&quot;, which would end up being featured on her &quot;Music&quot; album in 2000. Madonna confirmed in a 2005 interview with &quot;Attitude&quot; that the track was also supposed to be on the album but was axed because it gave her &quot;the wrong tingles&quot;. When the song leaked onto the internet on June 3, 2006, it became clear that the song &quot;Bubble Universe&quot; from William Orbit&#x27;s album &quot;Hello Waveforms&quot; was actually based on the same instrumental track. An alternate mix of &quot;Liquid Love&quot; leaked onto the internet on August 15, 2008.
* &quot;Mysore Smile&quot;. Written and produced with William Orbit but never used or released. Instrumental leaked by William Orbit in 2013. It appeared to be an early version of &quot;Cyber-Raga&quot;, a B-side for &quot;Music&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; and also a bonus track for the Japanese and Australian editions of &quot;Music&quot;, the album. Mysore is a city in India, a center of yoga and meditation study.
* &quot;Run&quot;. Written and produced with William Orbit but never used or released. Confirmed ASCAP title code 480358398. &quot;Run&quot; has since been released in instrumental form on William Orbit&#x27;s official Streamcast site, with the track retitled &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;. It was also revealed by Peter Magennis in a 2008 interview with madonnalicious.com that Swedish girl group Sahara Hotnights recorded a cover of &quot;Run&quot; that remains unreleased, as was revealed to Peter during his interview with long-time Orbit collaborator, Rico Conning. On January 11, 2011, William Orbit commented on &quot;Run&quot; on his Twitter account. He stated that he would not release the song, after receiving multiple requests from fans to leak the song in full. Clips of Madonna&#x27;s Run demo leaked onto the internet on April 19, 2011, the full demo leaking two days later.
* &quot;Arioso&quot;, written and produced by Madonna and William Orbit. The title was misspelled as &quot;Ariosa&quot;. In classical music, arioso is a type of solo vocal piece, usually occurring in an opera. Literally, arioso means airy. This song is actually from where the notorious Wonderland 47-seconds track – used for a TV series from 1999 – comes (see below). A 30-second snippet leaked online, on August 4, 2014. The song leaked in full on December 25, 2014 amidst the mass leak of demos from her album &quot;Rebel Heart&quot;. The demo was based on Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s Arioso, Adagio in G from &quot;Cantata BWV 156&quot;.
* &quot;Wonderland&quot;, the 45-second score to the short lived ABC TV show of the same name. The series aired only two episodes due to controversial content which viewers found disturbing. ASCAP title code 530521409. Written by Madonna and William Orbit. The full track remained unreleased until &quot;Arioso&quot; surfaced at Christmas 2014 (see above). When various other Madonna demos recorded with William Orbit leaked onto the internet in the summer of 2008, a slightly different version of this track leaked, crediting actor Rupert Everett as a co-vocalist (cf. William Orbit&#x27;s blog post 54).
* &quot;The Funny Song&quot;. ASCAP Title Code: 501807576. Writers: Ciccone Madonna L. Madonna performed a live version of this song as part of her 2001 Drowned World Tour setlist, calling it her &quot;brand new song&quot;. Madonna recorded a studio version in preparation for the tour, along with the rest of the setlist. While most of the other studio recorded setlist songs have been made available online, the studio version of this song remains unleaked. The track is also listed in the Warner/Chappell Music database with Madonna again credited as sole composer. The song is often listed as &quot;Oh Dear Daddy&quot; or &quot;The Funny Song (Oh Dear Daddy)&quot; on lyric web sites, due to its chorus.
* &quot;(title(s) unknown)&quot;, two songs recorded with Belgian-Congolese fusion group Zap Mama mixed by Pairs-based Bengali artist Subhendu Bapi Das Baul says the Screen India June 8, 2001. Plus a third recording is a Madonna guest vocal on a Bapi Das Baul track says the India Today April 2, 2001. Ultimately, Shubhendu ended up cutting not one, but two tracks. So far, these collaborations have not surfaced.

=== &quot;Die Another Day&quot; soundtrack ===
* &quot;Can&#x27;t You See My Mind&quot; Recorded and produced with French-techno producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï for the James Bond film &quot;Die Another Day&quot;. Widely reported in the media and was revealed to be an alternate title for &quot;Die Another Day&quot;. Listing confirmed at Warner-Chappell Music Publishing. Also ASCAP title code# 330991414.

=== &quot;American Life&quot; ===
* &quot;Cool Song&quot; is a track written with Mirwais and Monte Pittman. A remixed version by Paul Oakenfold, retitled &quot;It&#x27;s So Cool&quot;, appears as an iTunes-only bonus track on Madonna&#x27;s greatest hits compilation &quot;Celebration&quot; (see below). The original recording from 2002 leaked in full onto the internet on August 31, 2010. It features a stripped-down, acoustic performance by Madonna and includes a children&#x27;s choir during the final chorus. Another recording without the choir leaked on September 1, 2010 and is most likely an earlier version of the 2002 recording.
* &quot;The Game&quot; is a song written and produced with Mirwais. It became available on file-sharing networks in August 2008. The song has a stripped-down acoustic folk feel.
* “Miss You” is a song written and produced during the &quot;American Life&quot; sessions with Mirwais, but didn’t end up on the finalised album. It is a stripped-down folk ballad, and the demo leaked online in September 2010. One line was later recycled for “Like it Or Not”, a song from her 2005 album Confessions On A Dance Floor.
* &quot;Set the Right&quot; is a song produced by Mirwais and recorded during the &quot;American Life&quot; sessions. It was later suggested to be titled as &quot;To the Left, To the Right&quot; or &quot;Set To Right&quot; without further proof or citation. The song leaked in full as &quot;Set the Right&quot; on Internet on September 18, 2010.
* &quot;React&quot;. Listed on the BMI Music Licensing website. BMI Work #7337527. Composers are Ahmadzai, Mirwais and Ciccone, Madonna L. The song remains unleaked.

=== &quot;Re-Invention Tour&quot; era &amp; musicals projects ===
* &quot;I&#x27;m in Love with Love&quot; A song supposedly written with Mirwais and Monte Pittman during the 2004 Re-Invention World Tour. It was actually recorded between American Life and the &quot;Post Re-Invention Tour Musicals&quot;. To confuse this timeline, the individual who leaked the song mixed it with the original &quot;I Love New York&quot; from &quot;I&#x27;m Going To Tell You A Secret&quot;. Both of these tracks are indicative of the sound originally conceptualised for the next album, before the project evolved into what became &quot;Confessions On A Dance Floor&quot;. The full song leaked on Internet on September 20, 2010. A low-quality clip of an alternate version with different lyrics has leaked, as well.
* &quot;Miss You&quot;, &quot;If You Go Away&quot;, &quot;How High&quot;, &quot;Curtain&quot;, &quot;The Devil Wouldn&#x27;t Recognize You&quot; and &quot;Is this Love (Bon D&#x27;Accord)&quot; – among a number of songs written for a planned musical &quot;Hello Suckers&quot;, a 1920s-style musical loosely based on the life of Texas Guinan. Songs were written with a number of co-writers including Patrick Leonard and Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Lyrics from &quot;How High&quot; were later reworked into a song for &quot;Confessions on a Dance Floor&quot;. Some lyrics from &quot;Is This Love&quot; were later re-used on the song &quot;Voices&quot; on the album &quot;Hard Candy&quot;. &quot;The Devil Wouldn&#x27;t Recognize You&quot; was planned to be included on The Re-Invention Tour, but was later reworked with Madonna&#x27;s brother-in-law Joe Henry. Ultimately, the song did not surface until the album &quot;Hard Candy&quot; following further development with Timbaland, Justin Timberlake and Nate Hills. &quot;Is this Love (Bon D&#x27;Accord)&quot; has since been leaked to the internet. &quot;If You Go Away&quot; is based on the classic &quot;Ne me quitte pas&quot; by Jaques Brel. The English version has been covered by a wide range of artists, including Marlene Dietrich, Shirley Bassey and Tom Jones. Madonna&#x27;s version leaked onto the internet on September 2, 2010.
* &quot;(titles unknown)&quot; – A second musical to have been directed by filmmaker Luc Besson was also in pre-production during 2005, but was abandoned when Madonna read the script and was dissatisfied with the result. See Observer Guardian UK Madonna interview Nov 2005.

=== &quot;Confessions on a Dance Floor&quot; ===
* &quot;Get Together&quot;, original unreleased version, produced by Anders Bagge and Peer Åstrom. Dramatically different from the released album version. Leaked onto the internet in April 2008.
* &quot;History (Land of The Free)&quot; Completely different version from the song released as the B-side to Jump. Madonna&#x27;s voice is more pure, and the song has a completely different structure. Two different demos with slightly different lyrics leaked, the first in 2007 and the second in April 2008.
* &quot;Keep the Trance&quot; A collaboration with Mirwais that was not used for the album. A short edit of this track that was recorded during the album sessions, leaked onto the internet in January 2008. An alternate mix (reportedly final) leaked in August 2008. The lyrics were eventually reworked and used for the Live Earth charity release &quot;Hey You&quot;, which has very similar lyrics. The instrumental track was later reworked and used for the song &quot;Get It Right&quot; by Y.A.S., taken from their album &quot;Arabology&quot;, which was also produced by Mirwais.
* &quot;(title uncertain)&quot; Brother-in-law Joe Henry mentioned in an interview that he was working with Madonna on two songs. Only one of these collaborations (Jump), appeared on the final cut of the album. The second song may have been &quot;Devil Wouldn&#x27;t Recognize You&quot; which Madonna developed with Henry in 2005 before re-working it with other writers for inclusion on her 2008 album &quot;Hard Candy&quot;.
* &quot;Triggering&quot; Another collaboration between Madonna and Mirwais. The song leaked in full on August 21, 2008. Sometimes referred to by fans as &quot;Triggering Your Senses&quot; due to the song&#x27;s chorus. Registered ASCAP Work ID# 502697032

=== &quot;Hard Candy&quot; ===
* &quot;Across the Sky&quot;, a reported collaboration with Justin Timberlake, Danja and Timbaland. An edited nine-second low-quality a capella clip was leaked onto the internet in 2009; the full song leaked on January 21, 2010. An earlier version leaked on September 5, 2010. Justin Timberlake sings on the chorus of both demos.
* &quot;Animal&quot; is another Timbaland outtake. The full song leaked onto the internet on September 6, 2010.
* &quot;Beat Goes On (Demo)&quot;, an early version leaked onto the internet in August 2007 titled as &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot;. It features significantly different lyrics and musical structure from the album version. The song was completely reworked after this demo leaked, and another demo with Pharrell Williams titled &quot;Silly Girl&quot; was supposedly incorporated into the final album version of &quot;Beat Goes On&quot;. The Kanye West rap present in the released version was recorded after this demo leaked. The original instrumental was reworked and given to rapper Busta Rhymes, it appears as &quot;G Stro&quot; on the &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; soundtrack.
* &quot;Infinity&quot;, an early version of &quot;Give It 2 Me&quot;. The full song leaked onto the internet on September 3, 2010. It features similar lyrics, but the musical structure is completely different compared to the released version. It has been suggested that this early recording was produced by Timbaland and Timberlake, and that an alternate version with added elements also exists.
* &quot;Latte a.k.a. Pala Tute&quot; (aka &quot;Lela Pala Tute&quot;, translation: The Madness of Love), a collaboration with Justin Timberlake, Timbaland and Danja. The full demo leaked onto the internet on September 7, 2010 as the incorrect title &quot;Latte&quot;. Timbaland mentioned the song during an interview with MTV, then calling it &quot;La La&quot;. He has also been heard describing the song as &quot;Coffee Song&quot;. The chorus is sung in Romani and incorporates lyrics from the song &quot;Pala Tute&quot; by Gogol Bordello. It has been said that Timbaland misunderstood the lyrics of the chorus, erroneously assuming that it was about coffee. A final version of the song exists, with slightly different instrumentation and additional vocals by Justin Timberlake. Madonna incorporated some parts of &quot;Pala Tute&quot; into &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; during her Live Earth performance and again on her Sticky &amp; Sweet Tour in 2008/2009. Most file-sharing sites, lyric websites, and her fans still refer to the song as &quot;Latte&quot; instead of its correct title.
* &quot;The Beat Is So Crazy&quot;, a reported collaboration with Eve and produced by Pharrell Williams. The song was originally recorded with Pharrell for Hard Candy, but was given to Eve when it didn&#x27;t make the cut. Then, the song was supposed to be included on Eve&#x27;s &quot;Here I Am&quot; album, slated to drop in 2007, but was never released due to creative differences with her label at the time, Interscope Records (which later became Madonna&#x27;s label for a period). Eve sings the verses, and Madonna joins her on the hook: &quot;The beat is so crazy / It makes me want to let go / And totally forget today / I&#x27;m better off anyway,&quot;. In addition, Pharrell makes a brief vocal cameo at the latter part of the song. The version recorded for Eve&#x27;s album leaked on August 16, 2014. The original version of the song leaked in August 2015.

=== &quot;Celebration&quot; ===
* &quot;Broken&quot;, was mentioned by Paul Oakenfold, another track recorded for the compilation. Lyrics include, &quot;Broken like a crooked smile, a little hunched over...&quot;. Parts of the lyrics were taken from the previously released song &quot;Miles Away&quot;. The full song leaked onto the internet on September 6, 2010. Clips of the original acoustic demo of &quot;Broken&quot;, possibly recorded in 2007, leaked on April 19, 2011. The full acoustic demo leaked two days later. On August 25, 2011, it was announced on Madonna&#x27;s official website that fans who active Platinum members or renewed their membership of Madonna&#x27;s official fanclub, ICON, in 2010, would receive a limited edition 12&quot; vinyl single of the song, including the Original Extended Mix and the Instrumental Version. The vinyl has later appeared in the official Madonna online store as available for redemption only by qualified 2010 Madonna Platinum ICON members who received a redemption coupon code.
* &quot;It&#x27;s So Cool&quot; is a song originally written with Mirwais and Monte Pittman, CMRRA registration# 1852456 (see above). A remixed version by Paul Oakenfold appears as an iTunes-only bonus track on Madonna&#x27;s greatest hits compilation &quot;Celebration&quot;. In an interview for the June 2009 Têtu Magazine, Mirwais stated that: &quot;We still have some tracks we&#x27;re supposed to do together. Especially one that I really like, a very folkish song, but her last album (&quot;Hard Candy&quot;) had a more R&amp;B sound.&quot; It is suspected he was in fact talking about the demo &quot;Cool Song&quot;. Mirwais was commissioned to rework this track initially recorded with Madonna for the &quot;American Life&quot; album. For the &quot;Celebration&quot; album, Madonna chose to use Oakenfold&#x27;s version; however, Mirwais&#x27;s 2002 and 2009 versions leaked onto the internet in full on August 31, 2010.

== 2010–19 ==

=== &quot;MDNA&quot; ===
* &quot;Bang Bang Boom&quot;, original demo for &quot;Gang Bang&quot;. The song contains some of the same lyrics but the composition is completely different from the album version released on &quot;MDNA&quot;. The lyrical structure of the song is somewhat altered, however, the intonation of the vocals is very different. The song leaked in full via the internet on May 14, 2012. The Priscilla Renea songwriter&#x27;s demo, sung entirely by Renea herself, also leaked to the Internet some time in 2012/13.

=== &quot;Rebel Heart&quot; ===
* Thirteen demos from the album had leaked online by the night of December 16, 2014, before a title or release date had been announced. Along with the leak came false rumors of possible album titles, &quot;Iconic&quot; and &quot;Unapologetic Bitch&quot;. Snippets of the demos for &quot;Rebel Heart&quot; and &quot;Wash All Over Me&quot; leaked prior to this date some time in late November of the same year. Before the mass leak of demos, the songs &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;, &quot;Rebel Heart&quot;, &quot;Wash All Over Me&quot;, and &quot;Two Steps Behind Me&quot; had been confirmed to have been recorded for the album by August 2014. Madonna revealed through social media that half of the leaked demos won&#x27;t be released on the final version of the album, and &quot;the other half have changed [or] evolved&quot;. Fourteen further demos were leaked to the internet on December 23, including &quot;Back That Up (Do It)&quot;, which was eventually reworked and included as a bonus track on her 2019 album &quot;Madame X&quot; titled as Back That Up to the Beat. The demo later became viral in 2022 on the social-media platform TikTok and was officially released. Over the following day, three more demos leaked, including alternate acoustic takes of &quot;Rebel Heart&quot; and &quot;Wash All Over Me&quot;. &quot;Arioso&quot;, a demo from &quot;Music&quot;, leaked on December 25 amidst this mass leak of materials. On December 27 two more songs were leaked online, including the long-rumored &quot;Two Steps Behind Me&quot;, which is reported to be a Lady Gaga diss track, though the claim has been denied by both Madonna and her management.

<doc id="862471" wikidata="Q473652" url="?curid=862471" title="Effeminacy">
<text>Effeminacy or male femininity is the embodiment of feminine traits in boys or men, particularly those considered untypical of men or masculinity. These traits include roles, stereotypes, behaviors, and appearances that are socially associated with girls and women. Throughout Western civilization, men considered effeminate have faced prejudice and discrimination. Gay men are often stereotyped as being effeminate, and vice versa. However, femininity, masculinity, and other forms of gender expression are independent of sexual orientation.

==Terminology==
&quot;Effeminate&quot; comes from Latin &quot;&quot;, from the factitive prefix &quot;ex-&quot; (from &quot;ex&quot; &#x27;out&#x27;) and &quot;femina&quot; &#x27;woman&#x27;; it means &#x27;made feminine, emasculated, weakened&#x27;.

Other vernacular words for effeminacy include: &quot;pansy&quot;, &quot;nelly&quot;, &quot;pretty boy&quot;, &quot;nancy boy&quot;, &quot;girly boy&quot;, &quot;molly&quot;, &quot;sissy&quot;, &quot;pussy&quot;, &quot;tomgirl&quot;, &quot;femboy&quot;, &quot;roseboy&quot;, &quot;baby&quot;, and &quot;girl&quot; (when applied to a boy or, especially, adult man). The word &quot;effete&quot; similarly implies effeminacy or over-refinement, but comes from the Latin term &quot;effetus&quot; meaning &#x27;having given birth; exhausted&#x27;, from &quot;ex-&quot; and &quot;fetus&quot; &#x27;offspring&#x27;. The term &quot;tomgirl&quot;, meaning a girlish boy, comes from an inversion of &quot;tomboy&quot;, meaning a boyish girl. The term &quot;girly boy&quot; comes from a gender-inversion of &quot;girly girl&quot;.

==History==
===Ancient Greece and Rome===
====Greece====

Greek historian Plutarch recounts that Periander, the tyrant of Ambracia, asked his &quot;boy&quot;, &quot;Aren&#x27;t you pregnant yet?&quot; in the presence of other people, causing the boy to kill him in revenge for being treated as if effeminate or a woman (&quot;Amatorius&quot; 768F).

When Aeschines was accused of treason by Athenians Timarchus and Demosthenes in 346 BC, he brought a counter suit claiming Timarchus had prostituted himself to (or been &quot;kept&quot; by) other men (&quot;Against Timarchus&quot;). He also attributed Demosthenes&#x27; nickname Batalos (&quot;arse&quot;) to his &quot;unmanliness and &quot;kinaidiā&quot;&quot; and frequently commented on his &quot;unmanly and womanish temper&quot;, even criticising his clothing: &quot;If anyone took those dainty little coats and soft shirts off you... and took them round for the jurors to handle, I think they&#x27;d be quite unable to say, if they hadn&#x27;t been told in advance, whether they had hold of a man&#x27;s clothing or a woman&#x27;s.&quot;

In ancient Koine Greek, the word for effeminate is κίναιδος &quot;kinaidos&quot; (&quot;cinaedus&quot; in its Latinized form), or μαλακός &quot;malakoi&quot;: a man &quot;whose most salient feature was a supposedly &#x27;feminine&#x27; love of being sexually penetrated by other men&quot;:

The late Greek &quot;Erôtes&quot; (&quot;Loves&quot;, &quot;Forms of Desire&quot;, &quot;Affairs of the Heart&quot;), preserved with manuscripts by Lucian, contains a debate &quot;between two men, Charicles and Callicratidas, over the relative merits of women and boys as vehicles of male sexual pleasure.&quot; Callicratidas, &quot;far from being effeminised by his sexual predilection for boys... Callicratidas&#x27;s inclination renders him hypervirile... Callicratidas&#x27;s sexual desire for boys, then, makes him more of a man; it does not weaken or subvert his male gender identity but rather consolidates it.&quot; In contrast, &quot;Charicles&#x27; erotic preference for women seems to have had the corresponding effect of effeminising him: when the reader first encounters him, for example, Charicles is described as exhibiting &#x27;a skillful use of cosmetics, so as to be attractive to women.

====Rome====
Over-refinement, fine clothes and other possessions, the company of women, certain trades, and too much fondness with women were all deemed effeminate traits in Roman society. Taking an inappropriate sexual position, passive or &quot;bottom&quot;, in same-gender sex was considered effeminate and unnatural. Touching the head with a finger and wearing a goatee were also considered effeminate.

Roman consul Scipio Aemilianus questioned one of his opponents, P. Sulpicius Galus: &quot;For the kind of man who adorns himself daily in front of a mirror, wearing perfume; whose eyebrows are shaved off; who walks around with plucked beard and thighs; who when he was a young man reclined at banquets next to his lover, wearing a long-sleeved tunic; who is fond of men as he is of wine: can anyone doubt that he has done what &quot;cinaedi&quot; are in the habit of doing?&quot;

Roman orator Quintilian described, &quot;The plucked body, the broken walk, the female attire,&quot; as &quot;signs of one who is soft [mollis] and not a real man.&quot;

For Roman men masculinity also meant self-control, even in the face of painful emotions, illnesses, or death. Cicero says, &quot;There exist certain precepts, even laws, that prohibit a man from being effeminate in pain,&quot; and Seneca adds, &quot;If I must suffer illness, it will be my wish to do nothing out of control, nothing effeminately.&quot;

Emperor/philosopher Julian the Apostate, in his &quot;Against the Galileans&quot;, wrote: &quot;Why are the Egyptians more intelligent and more given to crafts, and the Syrians unwarlike and effeminate, but at the same time intelligent, hot-tempered, vain and quick to learn?&quot;

In his &quot;Commentaries on the Gallic Wars&quot;, Julius Caesar wrote that the Belgians were the bravest of all Gauls because &quot;merchants least frequently resort to them, and import those things which tend to effeminate the mind&quot;.

Emperor Marcus Aurelius evidently considered effeminacy an undesirable trait, but it is unclear what or who was being referred to.

==Gay men==
===China===
The Chinese term for &#x27;girlie men&#x27; is &quot;niang pao&quot;.

In September 2021, the Associated Press reported that the mainland Chinese government has banned effeminate men from appearing in television commercials. The Chinese government instructed broadcasters to stop showing &quot;sissy men&quot;.

===United States===
In the United States, boys are often homosocial, and gender role performance determines social rank. While gay boys receive the same enculturation, they are less compliant. Martin Levine summarizes: &quot;Harry (1982, 51–52), for example, found that 42 percent of his gay respondents were &#x27;sissies&#x27; during childhood. Only 11 percent of his heterosexual samples were gender-role nonconformists. Bell, Weinberg, and Hammersmith (1981, 188) reported that half of their male homosexual subjects practised gender-inappropriate behaviour in childhood. Among their heterosexual men, the rate of noncompliance was 25 percent. Saghir and Robins (1973, 18) found that one-third of their gay man respondents conformed to gender role dictates. Only 3 percent of their heterosexual men deviated from the norm.&quot; Thus effeminate boys, or sissies, are physically and verbally harassed (Saghir and Robins, 1973, 17–18; Bell, Weinberg, and Hammersmith 1981, 74–84), causing them to feel worthless and &quot;de-feminise&quot;.

Before the Stonewall riots, inconsistent gender role performance had been noticed among gay men: &quot;They have a different face for different occasions. In conversations with each other, they often undergo a subtle change. I have seen men who appeared to be normal suddenly smile roguishly, soften their voices, and simper as they greeted homosexual friends [...] Many times I saw these changes occur after I had gained a homosexual&#x27;s confidence and he could safely risk my disapproval. Once as I watched a luncheon companion become an effeminate caricature of himself, he apologized, &#x27;It is hard to always remember that one is a man.&#x27;&quot; Before Stonewall, &quot;closet&quot; culture accepted homosexuality as effeminate behaviour, and thus emphasized camp, drag, and swish, including an interest in fashion and decorating. Masculine gay men were marginalised and formed their own communities, such as the leather subculture, and/or wore clothes that were commonly associated with working-class individuals, such as sailor uniforms.

After Stonewall, &quot;clone culture&quot; became dominant and effeminacy is now marginalised. One indicator of this is a definite preference shown in personal ads for masculine-behaving men. The avoidance of effeminacy by men, including gay ones, has been linked to possible impedance of personal and public health. Regarding HIV/AIDS, masculine behaviour was stereotyped as being unconcerned about safe sex practices while engaging in promiscuous sexual behaviour. Early reports from New York City indicated that more women had themselves tested for HIV/AIDS than men. David Halperin compares &quot;universalising&quot; and &quot;minoritising&quot; notions of gender deviance: &quot;&#x27;Softness&#x27; either may represent the specter of potential gender failure that haunts all normative masculinity, an ever-present threat to the masculinity of every man, or it may represent the disfiguring peculiarity of a small class of deviant individuals.&quot;

The term &quot;effeminiphobia&quot; (sometimes &quot;effemiphobic&quot;, as used by Randy P. Conner) was coined by Will Fellows to describe strong anti-effeminacy. Michael Bailey coined the similar term &quot;femiphobia&quot; to describe the ambivalence gay men and culture have about effeminate behaviour in 1995. Gay author Tim Bergling popularized the term &quot;sissyphobia&quot; in &quot;&quot;, although it was used before. Transgender writer and biologist Julia Serano has coined the similar term &quot;effemimania&quot;. Feminist sociologist Rhea Ashley Hoskin suggests that these terms can be understood as relating to a larger construct of &quot;&quot;, or &quot;prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone who is &quot;perceived&quot; to identify, embody, or express femininely and toward people and objects gendered femininely.&quot; Since the 2000s, Peter Hennen&#x27;s cultural analysis of gay masculinities has found effeminacy to be a &quot;historically varying concept deployed primarily as a means of stabilising a given society&#x27;s concept of masculinity and controlling the conduct of its men based upon the repudiation of the feminine&quot;.

== Modern context ==
Femboy (alternatively spelled femboi) is a modern slang term used to refer to a male who displays traditionally feminine characteristics, such as wearing dresses, skirts, and/or thigh-highs. It is a portmanteau of &quot;feminine&quot; and &quot;boy&quot;. The term &quot;femboy&quot; emerged by at least the 1990s and gained traction online, used in both sexual and non-sexual contexts. Recently, femboys have become increasingly visible due to their inclusion in popular media, and trends such as &quot;Femboy Friday&quot; and &quot;Femboy Hooters&quot;. These trends involve self-identifying femboys posting images of themselves in online groups and forums, dressed in feminine clothing or a form of cosplay. Cosplay has become exceedingly popular among online femboys, usually cosplaying female, non-binary, or effeminate male characters.

While the term can be used as a slur towards trans women, it is also used as a positive/self-describing term within the LGBT community.

<text>Kapila Vatsyayan (25 December 1928 – 16 September 2020) was a leading scholar of Indian classical dance, art, architecture, and art history. She served as a member of parliament and bureaucrat in India, and also served as the founding director of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts.

In 1970, Vatsyayan received the Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship, the highest honour conferred by the Sangeet Natak Akademi, India&#x27;s national academy for music, dance and drama; this was followed by the Lalit Kala Akademi Fellowship, the highest honour in the fine arts conferred by Lalit Kala Akademi, India&#x27;s national academy for fine arts in 1995. In 2011, the Government of India bestowed upon her the Padma Vibhushan, India&#x27;s second highest civilian honour.

==Early life and background==
She was born in Delhi to Ram Lal and Satyawati Malik. She earned an MA in English literature from Delhi University. Thereafter, she completed a second MA in Education at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and a PhD at the Banaras Hindu University.

The poet and art critic Keshav Malik was her older brother, and she was married to the noted Hindi Writer S.H. Vatsyayan &#x27;Ajneya&#x27; (1911–1987). They married in 1956 and separated in 1969.

==Career==
Vatsyayan authored many books, including &quot;The Square and the Circle of Indian Arts (1997)&quot;, &quot;Bharata: The Natya Sastra&quot; (1996), and &quot;Matralaksanam&quot; (1988).

In 1987, she became the founder trustee and member secretary of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (Indira Kalakendra), India&#x27;s premier arts organisation, in Delhi. Thereafter, in 1993, she was made its academic director, a post she held until 2000, when she was retired by a BJP-led centre-right government. 

In 2005, when an Indian National Congress-led centre-left government returned to power, she was made the chairperson of the institution. She also served as Secretary to the Government of India in the Ministry of Education, where she was responsible for the establishment of a large number of national institutions of higher education. She was the chairperson of the Asia Project at the India International Centre, New Delhi.

She is known for her collaboration with great artists, such as legendary Koodiyattam maestro Guru Mani Madhava Chakyar (1899-1990) and played pivotal role in safeguarding the legacy of classical Indian art forms.

She was nominated as a member of the Upper House of Parliament of India, the Rajya Sabha in 2006, though subsequently in March 2006, she resigned following an office of profit controversy. In April 2007, she was renominated to the Rajya Sabha, with a term expiring in February 2012.

== Death ==
Kapila Vatsyayan died on 16 September 2020, aged 92, at her home in New Delhi.

==Awards==

<text>John David Roberts (born November 15, 1956) is a Canadian-American television journalist currently working for the Fox News Channel, as the co-anchor of &quot;America Reports&quot;. Roberts formerly worked as the Fox News Chief White House Correspondent from 2017 to 2021, covering the Donald Trump presidency.

He joined Fox News in January 2011. Prior to Fox News, Roberts was at CNN where he was an anchor and Senior National Correspondent. He worked at various radio and television jobs before joining CTV in 1990, CBS News in 1992 and CNN in 2006. On March 12, 2009, Roberts was inducted into the Canadian Broadcast Hall of Fame. Prior to becoming their chief White House correspondent, Roberts was a national correspondent for Fox News, based in Atlanta.

==Early life==
Roberts was born in Toronto, Ontario, and grew up in Mississauga, Ontario. He attended Erindale Secondary School and Lorne Park Secondary School and later the University of Toronto&#x27;s Erindale College.

==Career==

Roberts was born John Robertson, but shortened his professional name so as not to be confused with his uncle John Robertson, who was then a Canadian sports reporter and columnist.

===Local radio===
He first started working in radio at the local college station, CFRE-FM in Mississauga. His first professional job was as reporter and news anchor with CFOS in Owen Sound, Ontario, in 1975.

From there, Roberts went to CHYM in Kitchener, where he worked as a newsman and DJ, then worked on-air for radio station CJBK in London, Ontario, in 1977, before moving back to Toronto to join top-40 powerhouse CHUM later that year as a weekday evening disc jockey. 1050 CHUM and CITY-TV gave him the on-air name J. D. Roberts.

===CITY-TV and MuchMusic===
In 1979, he branched out from his radio work to co-host with Jeanne Beker the music newsmagazine &quot;The NewMusic&quot; on CITY-TV until 1985. &quot;The New Music&quot; was a pioneering program that pre-dated MTV. Roberts, Beker and the &quot;New Music&quot; team won many awards for their work. During that time, Roberts also served as Entertainment reporter for CITY-TV and on occasion filled in for John Majhor and later Brad Giffen on CITY-TV&#x27;s local music video show &quot;Toronto Rocks&quot;. In 1984, Roberts was tapped to front Canada&#x27;s music channel MuchMusic. He and Christopher Ward were the first on-air personalities appearing when the network launched in 1984. At MuchMusic he hosted many programs, including a one-hour heavy metal video show called &quot;The Power Hour&quot;.

In 1987, Roberts left MuchMusic to anchor CITY-TV&#x27;s &quot;CityPulse&quot;, and became anchor of the 10 pm &quot;CityPulse Tonight&quot; when Anne Mroczkowski moved from anchoring that newscast to join Gord Martineau on the 6 pm edition.

===WCIX===
Between 1989 and 1990 Roberts was an anchor and reporter for WCIX (now WFOR-TV), the CBS-owned and operated television station in Miami, Florida.

===CTV===
Roberts returned to Canada in September 1990 to co-host the national CTV morning show &quot;Canada AM&quot;, initially with Deborah McGregor, and later with Pamela Wallin.

===CBS===
In 1992, Roberts moved to CBS News in New York. His initial assignment was anchoring the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; with co-anchor Meredith Vieira. Roberts was also the news reader and substitute anchor for Harry Smith on &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; and &quot;The Early Show&quot;. From 1994 to 1995 Roberts anchored the 5pm and 11pm newscasts at CBS&#x27;s flagship station in New York, WCBS-TV. In March 1995, he moved back to the CBS Network as anchor of the &quot;CBS Sunday Evening News,&quot; remaining in that position for nearly 11 years. He also anchored the &quot;CBS Saturday Evening News&quot; from February 1999 until he became CBS chief White House Correspondent in August 1999.

Roberts served as chief White House Correspondent at CBS from August 1999 to February 2006, and regularly anchored a Sunday-afternoon 3pm ET newscast for the CBS Radio Network. In March 2003, Roberts was embedded with the 2nd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion of the U.S. Marines during the initial invasion of Iraq.

On July 19, 2005, he introduced CBS&#x27;s coverage on the announcement of the nomination of John Roberts for the Supreme Court of the United States. He jokingly asked colleagues to refer to him as &quot;Your Honor&quot; because he and Justice Roberts bear the same name.

He had been widely considered a potential replacement for &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; anchor Dan Rather after Rather stepped down from the anchor desk in March 2005, but Bob Schieffer was chosen on an interim basis to be the next &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; anchor, and in subsequent months, it became clear that Roberts was not under consideration for the job.. During his time at CBS, Roberts received three national Emmy awards as well as a Gracie award for his coverage of a groundbreaking surgery to repair neural tube defects.

===CNN===
In February 2006, Roberts left CBS and joined CNN. In July 2006 and August 2006, Roberts reported from the front lines in the Israel/Hezbollah war and at one point, embedded with an Israeli infantry unit, marching 10 miles into Lebanon. Roberts was recognized with a Headline Award for that embed. CNN&#x27;s coverage of the war was recognized with an Edward R. Murrow Award.

In October 2006, he returned to Iraq as the first anchor of &quot;This Week at War&quot; and served as the Senior National Correspondent based in Washington. He has also substituted for Anderson Cooper on &quot;Anderson Cooper 360°&quot;. Roberts was co-anchor of CNN&#x27;s morning program &quot;American Morning&quot; from 2007 to 2010. He anchored from New York. In 2010, &quot;American Morning&quot; was nominated for &quot;best morning program&quot; at the Daytime Emmy Awards, losing to &quot;Good Morning America&quot;.

The Associated Press reported that Roberts&#x27; departure from &quot;American Morning&quot; was at his request so he could move closer to fiancée and CNN anchor Kyra Phillips.

===Fox News===
Executives at CNN confirmed on January 3, 2011, that Roberts would be leaving CNN to join Fox News as a national correspondent, based in Atlanta.

Roberts reported on numerous breaking news events including the murder trial of real estate heir Robert Durst, the U.S. Ebola outbreak, the 2013 EF5 tornado in Moore, Oklahoma, and the aftermath of Hurricane Irene in 2011 as well continuing his coverage of American politics.

In an August 2016 sexual harassment lawsuit against Fox News, Andrea Tantaros claimed that Roberts, Scott Brown, and Bill O&#x27;Reilly sexually harassed her. The case was dismissed.

In January 2017, Roberts became chief White House correspondent for Fox News, covering the activities of US President Donald Trump. Roberts garnered significant attention in 2020 for criticizing the Trump presidency&#x27;s hostility with the media and its failure to properly inform the media. Following the first presidential debate in the 2020 elections, Roberts got into a heated exchange with press secretary Kayleigh McEnany over the president&#x27;s failure to explicitly denounce white supremacy. During the press briefing, Roberts frustratedly told McEnany to &quot;stop deflecting, stop blaming the media&quot;, to which he received much backlash, prompting controversy over the subject in the media and among politicians.

In October 2020, Fox News announced that Roberts had signed a multi-year contract extension and that he would remain with Fox News for the coming years.

On January 14, 2021, Fox News announced that Roberts was being promoted to an anchor position, with a 1-3 pm show entitled &quot;America Reports&quot;. Peter Doocy took Roberts&#x27; former position as the White House correspondent during the Joe Biden administration.

On October 18, 2021, Roberts tweeted that the death of Colin Powell, who died at the age of 84 as a result of complications due to COVID-19 despite being fully vaccinated, raised &quot;new concerns&quot; about the long-term efficacy of vaccines. His tweet was criticized for not taking into account Powell&#x27;s age and health history, which reportedly included a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer that weakens the body&#x27;s ability to protect against infections. Roberts eventually deleted the tweet, and subsequently saying he did so because the tweet was interpreted as &quot;anti-vax&quot;, when &quot;it was not&quot;.

==Personal life==
Divorced in 2008 from his high school sweetheart with whom he shares two children, John Roberts announced his engagement to Kyra Phillips on April 25, 2010. They have twin children named Sage Ann and Kellan Clay. As of 2018, the couple are married.

<text>A gamma camera (γ-camera), also called a scintillation camera or Anger camera, is a device used to image gamma radiation emitting radioisotopes, a technique known as scintigraphy. The applications of scintigraphy include early drug development and nuclear medical imaging to view and analyse images of the human body or the distribution of medically injected, inhaled, or ingested radionuclides emitting gamma rays.

==Imaging techniques==

Scintigraphy (&quot;scint&quot;) is the use of gamma cameras to capture emitted radiation from internal radioisotopes to create two-dimensional images.

SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) imaging, as used in nuclear cardiac stress testing, is performed using gamma cameras. Usually one, two or three detectors or heads, are slowly rotated around the patient.

==Construction==

A gamma camera consists of one or more flat crystal planes (or detectors) optically coupled to an array of photomultiplier tubes in an assembly known as a &quot;head&quot;, mounted on a gantry. The gantry is connected to a computer system that both controls the operation of the camera and acquires and stores images. The construction of a gamma camera is sometimes known as a compartmental radiation construction.

The system accumulates events, or counts, of gamma photons that are absorbed by the crystal in the camera. Usually a large flat crystal of sodium iodide with thallium doping NaI(Tl) in a light-sealed housing is used. The highly efficient capture method of this combination for detecting gamma rays was discovered in 1944 by Sir Samuel Curran whilst he was working on the Manhattan Project at the University of California at Berkeley. Nobel prize-winning physicist Robert Hofstadter also worked on the technique in 1948.

The crystal scintillates in response to incident gamma radiation. When a gamma photon leaves the patient (who has been injected with a radioactive pharmaceutical), it knocks an electron loose from an iodine atom in the crystal, and a faint flash of light is produced when the dislocated electron again finds a minimal energy state. The initial phenomenon of the excited electron is similar to the photoelectric effect and (particularly with gamma rays) the Compton effect. After the flash of light is produced, it is detected. Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) behind the crystal detect the fluorescent flashes (events) and a computer sums the counts. The computer reconstructs and displays a two dimensional image of the relative spatial count density on a monitor. This reconstructed image reflects the distribution and relative concentration of radioactive tracer elements present in the organs and tissues imaged.

==Signal processing==
Hal Anger developed the first gamma camera in 1957. His original design, frequently called the Anger camera, is still widely used today. The Anger camera uses sets of vacuum tube photomultipliers (PMT). Generally each tube has an exposed face of about in diameter and the tubes are arranged in hexagon configurations, behind the absorbing crystal. The electronic circuit connecting the photodetectors is wired so as to reflect the relative coincidence of light fluorescence as sensed by the members of the hexagon detector array. All the PMTs simultaneously detect the (presumed) same flash of light to varying degrees, depending on their position from the actual individual event. Thus the spatial location of each single flash of fluorescence is reflected as a pattern of voltages within the interconnecting circuit array.

The location of the interaction between the gamma ray and the crystal can be determined by processing the voltage signals from the photomultipliers; in simple terms, the location can be found by weighting the position of each photomultiplier tube by the strength of its signal, and then calculating a mean position from the weighted positions. The total sum of the voltages from each photomultiplier, measured by a pulse height analyzer is proportional to the energy of the gamma ray interaction, thus allowing discrimination between different isotopes or between scattered and direct photons.

==Spatial resolution==
In order to obtain spatial information about the gamma-ray emissions from an imaging subject (e.g. a person&#x27;s heart muscle cells which have absorbed an intravenous injected radioactive, usually thallium-201 or technetium-99m, medicinal imaging agent) a method of correlating the detected photons with their point of origin is required.

The conventional method is to place a collimator over the detection crystal/PMT array. The collimator consists of a thick sheet of lead, typically thick, with thousands of adjacent holes through it. There are three types of collimators: low energy, medium energy, and high energy collimators. As the collimators transitioned from low energy to high energy, the hole sizes, thickness, and septations between the holes also increased. Given a fixed septal thickness, the collimator resolution decreases with increased efficiency and also increasing distance of the source from the collimator. Pulse-height analyser determines the Full width at half maximum that selects certain photons to contribute to the final image, thus determining the collimator resolution.

The individual holes limit photons which can be detected by the crystal to a cone shape; the point of the cone is at the midline center of any given hole and extends from the collimator surface outward. However, the collimator is also one of the sources of blurring within the image; lead does not totally attenuate incident gamma photons, there can be some crosstalk between holes. 

Unlike a lens, as used in visible light cameras, the collimator attenuates most (&gt;99%) of incident photons and thus greatly limits the sensitivity of the camera system. Large amounts of radiation must be present so as to provide enough exposure for the camera system to detect sufficient scintillation dots to form a picture.

Other methods of image localization (pinhole, rotating slat collimator with CZT) have been proposed and tested; however, none have entered widespread routine clinical use.

The best current camera system designs can differentiate two separate point sources of gamma photons located at 6 to 12 mm depending on distance from the collimator, the type of collimator and radio-nucleide. Spatial resolution decreases rapidly at increasing distances from the camera face. This limits the spatial accuracy of the computer image: it is a fuzzy image made up of many dots of detected but not precisely located scintillation. This is a major limitation for heart muscle imaging systems; the thickest normal heart muscle in the left ventricle is about 1.2 cm and most of the left ventricle muscle is about 0.8 cm, always moving and much of it beyond 5 cm from the collimator face. To help compensate, better imaging systems limit scintillation counting to a portion of the heart contraction cycle, called gating, however this further limits system sensitivity.

<text>Assertiveness is the quality of being self-assured and confident without being aggressive to defend a right point of view or a relevant statement. In the field of psychology and psychotherapy, it is a skill that can be learned and a mode of communication. &quot;Dorland&#x27;s Medical Dictionary&quot; defines assertiveness as: 
:&quot;a form of behavior characterized by a confident declaration or affirmation of a statement without need of proof; this affirms the person&#x27;s rights or point of view without either aggressively threatening the rights of another (assuming a position of dominance) or submissively permitting another to ignore or deny one&#x27;s rights or point of view.&quot;

Assertiveness is a communication skill that can be taught and the skills of assertive communication effectively learned.

Assertiveness is a method of critical thinking, where an individual speaks up in defense of their views or in light of erroneous information. Additionally, assertive people are capable of being outspoken and analyze information and point out areas of information lacking substance, details or evidence. Thus, it can be noted that assertiveness supports creative thinking and effective communication.

However, during the second half of the 20th century, assertiveness was increasingly singled out as a behavioral skill taught by many personal development experts, behavior therapists, and cognitive behavioral therapists. But now assertiveness is often linked to self-esteem. The term and concept was popularized to the general public by books such as &quot;Your Perfect Right: A Guide to Assertive Behavior&quot; (1970) by Robert Eating.

==Training==
Joseph Wolpe initially explored the use of assertiveness as a means of &quot;reciprocal inhibition&quot; of anxiety, in his 1958 book on treating neurosis; and it has since been commonly employed as an intervention in behavior therapy. Assertiveness training was introduced by Andrew Salter (1961) and popularized by Joseph Wolpe. Wolpe&#x27;s belief was that a person could not be both assertive and anxious at the same time, and thus being assertive would inhibit anxiety.
The goals of assertiveness training include:
* increased awareness of personal rights
* differentiation between non-assertiveness and assertiveness
* differentiation between passive–aggressiveness and aggressiveness
* learning both verbal and non-verbal assertiveness skills.

As a communication style and strategy, assertiveness is thus distinguished from both aggression and passivity. How people deal with personal boundaries, including their own and those of other people, helps to distinguish between these three concepts. Passive communicators are not likely to try to influence anyone else because they fear social conflict. Because of this fear, passive communicators do not defend their own personal boundaries or ideas, and thus allow aggressive people to abuse or manipulate them. Additionally, they often hold in negative feelings such as anger because they allow this domination to happen. Aggressive people do not respect the personal boundaries of others and thus are liable to harm others by influencing them through personal attacks often taking the form of embarrassment. A person communicates assertively by clearly stating their thoughts and/or feelings in a nonaggressive manner, often in an effort to influence others; doing so in a way that respects the personal boundaries of the other person, or people, involved and avoids negative confrontation. Assertive people are also willing to defend themselves against aggressive people.

==Communication==
Assertive communication involves respect for the boundaries of oneself and others. It also presumes an interest in the fulfillment of needs and wants through cooperation.

According to the textbook &quot;Cognitive Behavior Therapy&quot; (2008), &quot;Assertive communication of personal opinions, needs, and boundaries has been ... conceptualized as the behavioral middle ground, lying between ineffective passive and aggressive responses&quot;. Such communication &quot;emphasizes expressing feelings forthrightly, but in a way that will not spiral into aggression&quot;.

An individual may employ an assertive communication if others&#x27; actions threaten one&#x27;s boundaries, one communicates this to prevent escalation.

In contrast, &quot;aggressive communication&quot; judges, threatens, lies, breaks confidences, stonewalls, and violates others&#x27; boundaries.

At the opposite end of the dialectic is &quot;passive communication&quot;. Victims may passively permit others to violate their boundaries. At a later time, they may come back and attack with a sense of impunity or righteous indignation.

Assertive communication attempts to transcend these extremes by appealing to the shared interest of all parties; it &quot;focuses on the issue, not the person&quot;. Aggressive and/or passive communication, on the other hand, may mark a relationship&#x27;s end, and reduce self-respect.

==Characteristics==
Assertive people tend to have the following characteristics:
* They feel free to express their feelings, thoughts, and desires.
* They are &quot;also able to initiate and maintain comfortable relationships with [other] people&quot;
* They know their rights.
* They have control over their anger. This does not mean that they repress this feeling. It means that they control anger and talk about it in a reasoning manner.
* &quot;Assertive people ... are willing to compromise with others, rather than always wanting their own way ... and tend to have good self-esteem&quot;.

==Techniques==
Techniques of assertiveness can vary widely. Manuel Smith, in his 1975 book &quot;When I Say No, I Feel Guilty&quot;, offered some of the following behaviors:

===Broken record===
The &quot;broken record&quot; technique consists of simply repeating your requests or your refusals every time you are met with resistance. The term comes from vinyl records, the surface of which when scratched would lead the needle of a record player to loop over the same few seconds of the recording indefinitely. &quot;As with a broken record, the key to this approach is repetition ... where your partner will not take no for an answer.&quot;

A disadvantage with this technique is that when resistance continues, your requests may lose power every time you have to repeat them. If the requests are repeated too often, it can backfire on the authority of your words. In these cases, it is necessary to have some sanctions on hand.

===Fogging===

===Negative assertion===
Negative assertion is agreement with criticism without letting up demand.

===I-statements===
I-statements can be used to voice one&#x27;s feelings and wishes from a personal position without expressing a judgment about the other person or blaming one&#x27;s feelings on them.

==Applications==
Several research studies have identified assertiveness training as a useful tool in the prevention of alcohol-use disorders. Psychological skills in general including assertiveness and social skills have been posed as intervention for a variety of disorders with some empirical support.

In connection with gender theory, &quot;Tannen argues that men and women would both benefit from learning to use the others&#x27; style. ... So, women would benefit from assertiveness training just as men might benefit from sensitivity training&quot;.

Regarding language revitalization and to avoid passive bilingualism phenomena, assertiveness has become a key discursive asset for speakers of minoritized languages. An example of this use is Mantinc el català, that aims to raise self-awareness in Catalan speakers about the importance of not shifting unconsciously and at first glance to Spanish in conversations with unknown people.

==Challenges==
Assertiveness may be practiced in an unbalanced way, especially by those new to the process: &quot;[One] problem with the concept of assertiveness is that it is both complex and situation-specific. ... Behaviors that are assertive in one circumstance may not be so in another&quot;. More particularly, while &quot;unassertiveness courts one set of problems, over-assertiveness creates another.&quot; Assertiveness manuals recognize that &quot;many people, when trying out assertive behavior for the first time, find that they go too far and become aggressive.&quot;

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, in the heyday of assertiveness training, some so-called assertiveness training techniques were distorted and &quot;people were told to do some pretty obnoxious things in the name of assertiveness. Like blankly repeating some request over and over until you got your way&quot;. Divorced from respect for the rights of others, so-called assertiveness techniques could be psychological tools that might be readily abused: The line between repeatedly demanding with sanctions (&quot;broken record&quot;) versus coercive nagging, emotional blackmail, or bullying, could be a fine one, and the caricature of assertiveness training as &quot;training in how to get your own way ... or how to become as aggressive as the next person&quot; was perpetuated.

<doc id="862499" wikidata="Q3424738" url="?curid=862499" title="Renaissance Technologies">
<text>Renaissance Technologies LLC (also known as RenTech or RenTec) is an American hedge fund based in East Setauket, New York, on Long Island, which specializes in systematic trading using quantitative models derived from mathematical and statistical analysis. Their signature Medallion fund is famed for the best record in investing history. Renaissance was founded in 1982 by James Simons, a mathematician who formerly worked as a code breaker during the Cold War.

In 1988, the firm established its most profitable portfolio, the Medallion Fund, which used an improved and expanded form of Leonard Baum&#x27;s mathematical models, improved by algebraist James Ax, to explore correlations from which it could profit. Elwyn Berlekamp was instrumental in evolving trading to shorter-dated, pure systems driven decision-making. The hedge fund was named Medallion in honor of the math awards that Simons and Ax had won.

Renaissance&#x27;s flagship Medallion fund, which is run mostly for fund employees, is famous for the best track record on Wall Street, returning more than 66 percent annualized before fees and 39 percent after fees over a 30-year span from 1988 to 2018. Renaissance offers two portfolios to outside investors—Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund (RIEF) and Renaissance Institutional Diversified Alpha (RIDA).

Because of the success of Renaissance in general and Medallion in particular, Simons has been described as the &quot;best money manager on earth&quot;.

Simons ran Renaissance until his retirement in late 2009. He continued to play a role at the firm as non-executive chairman, which he stepped down from in 2021, and remained invested in its funds, particularly the Medallion fund until his death in 2024. The company is now run by Peter Brown (after Robert Mercer resigned). Both of them were computer scientists specializing in computational linguistics who joined Renaissance in 1993 from IBM Research. The fund has $165 billion in discretionary assets under management (including leverage) as of April 2021.

==Academia and research==

James Simons founded Renaissance Technologies following a decade as the Chair of the Department of Mathematics at Stony Brook University. Simons in 1976 was a recipient of the Oswald Veblen Prize of the American Mathematical Society. He is known in the scientific community for co-developing the Chern–Simons theory, which is used in modern theoretical physics.

==Quantitative trading==

The firm uses quantitative trading, where staff tap data in its petabyte-scale data warehouse to assess statistical probabilities for the direction of securities prices in any given market. Staff attribute the breadth of data on events peripheral to financial and economic phenomena that Renaissance takes into account, and the firm&#x27;s ability to manipulate large amounts of data by deploying scalable technological architectures for computation and execution. 

Renaissance Technologies&#x27; hedge fund has employed mathematical models to analyze and execute trades, many of them automated. The firm uses computer-based models to predict price changes in easily traded financial instruments. These models are based on analyzing as much data as can be gathered, then looking for non-random movements to make predictions. Some also attribute the firm&#x27;s performance to employing financial signal processing techniques such as pattern recognition. The book &quot;The Quants&quot; describes the hiring of speech recognition experts, many from IBM, including the current leaders of the firm.

==&quot;Quants&quot; with non-financial background==
Renaissance employs specialists with non-financial backgrounds, including computer scientists, mathematicians, physicists, signal processing experts and statisticians. The firm&#x27;s latest fund is the Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund (RIEF). RIEF has historically trailed the firm&#x27;s better-known Medallion fund, a separate fund that contains only the personal money of the firm&#x27;s executives.

Renaissance is a firm run by and for scientists, employing those with non-financial backgrounds for quantitative finance research like mathematicians, statisticians, theoretical and experimental physicists, astronomers, and computer scientists. According to a piece in &quot;The New York Times, &quot;&quot;Wall Street experience is frowned on and a flair for science is prized.&quot; One former employee speculated that the herdlike mentality among business school graduates is to blame for poor investor returns. Renaissance engages roughly 150 researchers and computer programmers, half of whom have PhDs in scientific disciplines, at its 50-acre East Setauket campus in Long Island, New York, which is near the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Mathematician Isadore Singer referred to Renaissance&#x27;s East Setauket office as the best physics and mathematics department in the world.

The firm&#x27;s administrative and back-office functions are handled from its Manhattan office in New York City. The firm is secretive about the workings of its business and very little is known about them. The firm is known for low personnel turnover and for requiring its researchers to agree to intellectual property obligations by signing non-compete and non-disclosure agreements.

== Monemetrics ==

In 1978, Simons left academia and started a hedge fund management firm called Monemetrics in a Long Island strip mall. The firm primarily traded currencies at the start. It did not occur to Simons at first to apply mathematics to his business, but he gradually realized that it should be possible to make mathematical models of the data he was collecting.

Monemetrics&#x27; name was changed to Renaissance Technologies in 1982. Simons started recruiting some of the mathematicians and data-modeling types from his days at the Institute for Defense Analysis (IDA) and Stony Brook University. His first recruit was Leonard Baum, a cryptanalyst from IDA who was also the co-author of the Baum–Welch algorithm. When Baum abandoned the idea of trading with mathematical models and took to fundamental trading, Simons brought in algebraist James Ax from Cornell University. Ax expanded Baum&#x27;s models for trading currencies to cover any commodity future and subsequently Simons set up Ax with his own trading account, Axcom Ltd., which eventually gave birth to the profitable fund — Medallion. During the 1980s, Ax and his researchers improved on Baum&#x27;s models and used them to explore correlations from which they could profit.

===Medallion Fund===


In 1988, Renaissance established its most profitable fund, the Medallion fund (previously the Limroy Colombian fund), which used an expanded form of Leonard Baum&#x27;s mathematical models improved by algebraist James Ax to explore correlations from which they could profit. Simons and Ax, who were classmates at UC Berkeley, started Medallion, which they named after their awards in mathematics. The initial success of the company&#x27;s models led Simons to base the fund&#x27;s trades entirely on the models.

By April 1989, however, peak-to-trough losses had mounted to about 30%. Ax claimed to have accounted for such a decline in his models and insisted on continuing to trade. Simons wanted to pause and reevaluate; Simons, as majority owner, prevailed, and Ax departed. Simons then asked Berkeley professor Elwyn Berlekamp to run Medallion. A consultant for Axcom whom Simons had first met at the IDA, Berlekamp had acquired most of Ax&#x27;s stake in Axcom and became its CEO. He worked with Sandor Straus, Jim Simons and another consultant, Henry Laufer, to overhaul Medallion&#x27;s trading system over the course of six months. In 1990, Berlekamp led Medallion to a 55.9% gain, net of fees, and then returned to his duties as a Berkeley professor after selling out to Simons at six times the price for which he had bought his Axcom interests sixteen months earlier. Straus then took Berlekamp&#x27;s place, running Medallion&#x27;s revamped trading system, which returned 39.4% in 1991, 34% in 1992 and 39.1% in 1993, according to Medallion annual reports.

The Medallion fund is considered to be one of the most successful hedge funds ever. From 1994 through mid-2014, it averaged a 71.8% annual return, before fees. The fund has been closed to outside investors since 1993 and is available only to current and past employees and their families. The firm bought out the last investor in the Medallion fund in 2005 and the investor community has not seen its returns since then. About 100 of Renaissance&#x27;s some 275 employees are &quot;qualified purchasers&quot;, meaning they generally have at least $5 million in assets to invest. The remaining are &quot;accredited investors&quot;, generally worth at least $1 million.

By 2000, the computer-driven Medallion fund had an average annual return of 34% after fees from its 1988 inception. Simons ran Renaissance until his retirement in late 2009. Between January 1993 and April 2005, Medallion only had 17 losing months and out of 49 quarters over the same period, Medallion had only three losing quarters. Between 1989-2005 Medallion had only one year showing a loss: 1989.

During 2020 the Medallion fund surged 76%.

===Medallion as a retirement fund===

Renaissance Technologies terminated its 401(k) retirement plan in 2010 and employees&#x27; account balances were put into Individual Retirement Accounts. Contributions could be made to a standard Individual Retirement Accounts and then converted to a Roth IRA regardless of income. By 2012, Renaissance was granted a special exemption by the United States Labor Department allowing employees to invest their retirement money in Medallion arguing that Medallion had consistently outperformed their old 401(k) plan. In 2013, Renaissance&#x27;s IRA plans had 259 participants whose $86.6 million contribution grew to $153 million that year without fees or annual taxes. Renaissance set up a new 401(k) plan, and in November 2014 the Labor Department allowed that plan to be invested in Medallion as well.

===Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund (RIEF)===

In 2005, Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund (RIEF) was created. RIEF has historically trailed the firm&#x27;s better-known Medallion fund, a separate fund that only contains the personal money of the firm&#x27;s executives. In April 2020, Institutional Investor reported that the disparity between Renaissance&#x27;s Medallion fund and other funds, including RIEF, was approximately 17-19%. Renaissance also offers two Renaissance Institutional Diversified Alpha (RIDA) to outsiders. Simons ran Renaissance until his retirement in late 2009. Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund had difficulty with the higher volatility environment that persisted throughout the end of the summer of 2007. According to an article in &quot;Bloomberg&quot; in August 2007,

RIEF once again struggled in the high volatility environment of 2020. According to an article in &quot;Bloomberg&quot; in November 2020,

From December 1, 2020 to February 1, 2021, according to &quot;Bloomberg&quot;, clients (LPs) had withdrawn $5 billion from the fund.

On 25 September 2008, Renaissance wrote a comment letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, discouraging them from implementing a rule change that would have permitted the public to access information regarding institutional investors&#x27; short positions, as they can currently do with long positions. The company cited a number of reasons for this, including the fact that &quot;institutional investors may alter their trading activity to avoid public disclosure&quot;.

==Governmental affairs==
===2014 tax avoidance investigation===
In July 2014, Renaissance Technologies was included in a larger investigation undertaken by Carl Levin and the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on tax evasion by wealthy individuals. The focus of the tax avoidance investigation was Renaissance&#x27;s trading strategy — which involved transactions with banks such as Barclays Plc and Deutsche Bank AG — through which profits converted from rapid trading were converted into lower-taxed, long-term capital gains. The strategy was also questioned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The higher rates for the five years under investigation would have been 44.4 percent, as compared to 35 percent, whereas the lower rate was 15 percent, as compared to 23.8 percent.
In September 2021, Simons, Mercer, and other Renaissance executives agreed to pay up to $7 billion in taxes and penalties to settle the dispute with the IRS. The settlement was among the largest in history.

===Campaign contributions===
According to OpenSecrets, Renaissance was the top financial firm contributing to federal campaigns in the 2016 election cycle, donating $33,108,000 by July. By comparison, over that same period sixth ranked Soros Fund Management has contributed $13,238,551. Renaissance&#x27;s managers were also active in the 2016 cycle, contributing nearly $30 million by June, with Mercer ranking as the #1 individual federal donor, largely to Republicans, and Simons ranked #5, largely to Democrats. They were top donors to the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.

During the 2016 campaign cycle, Simons contributed $26,277,450, ranking as the 5th largest individual contributor. Simons directed all but $25,000 of his funds towards liberal candidates. Robert Mercer contributed $25,059,300, ranking as the 7th largest individual contributor. Robert Mercer directed all funds contributed towards conservative candidates.

Between 1990 and 2016, Renaissance employees have contributed $59,081,152 to federal campaigns and since 2001 have spent $3,730,000 on lobbying.

<text>An infantile hemangioma (IH), sometimes called a strawberry mark due to appearance, is a type of benign vascular tumor or anomaly that affects babies. Other names include capillary hemangioma, &quot;strawberry hemangioma&quot;, strawberry birthmark and strawberry nevus. and formerly known as a cavernous hemangioma. They appear as a red or blue raised lesion on the skin. Typically, they begin during the first four weeks of life, growing until about five months of life, and then shrinking in size and disappearing over the next few years. Often skin changes remain after they shrink. Complications may include pain, bleeding, ulcer formation, disfigurement, or heart failure. It is the most common tumor of orbit and periorbital areas in childhood. It may occur in the skin, subcutaneous tissues and mucous membranes of oral cavities and lips as well as in extracutaneous locations including the liver and gastrointestinal tract.
The underlying reason for their occurrence is not clear. In about 10% of cases they appear to run in families. A few cases are associated with other abnormalities such as PHACE syndrome. Diagnosis is generally based on the symptoms and appearance. Occasionally medical imaging can assist in the diagnosis.
In most cases no treatment is needed, other than close observation. Hemangiomas may grow rapidly, before stopping and slowly fading, with maximum improvement typically occurring by the age of years. While this birthmark may be alarming in appearance, physicians generally counsel that it be left to disappear on its own, unless it is in the way of vision or blocking the nostrils. Certain cases, however, may result in problems and the use of medication such as propranolol or steroids are recommended. Occasionally surgery or laser treatment may be used.
It is one of the most common benign tumors in babies, occurring in about 5-10% of all births. They occur more frequently in females, whites, prematurely born, and low birth weight babies. They can occur anywhere on the body, though 83% occur on the head or neck area. The word &quot;hemangioma&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;haima&quot; (αἷμα) meaning &quot;blood&quot;; &quot;angeion&quot; (ἀγγεῖον) meaning &quot;vessel&quot;; and &quot;-oma&quot; (-ωμα) meaning &quot;tumor&quot;.

==Signs and symptoms==

Infantile hemangiomas typically develop in the first few weeks or months of life. They are more common in Caucasians, in premature children whose birth weight is less than , in females, and in twin births. Early lesions may resemble a red scratch or patch, a white patch, or a bruise. The majority occur on the head and neck, but they can occur almost anywhere. The appearance and color of the IH depend on its location and depth within the level of the skin.

Superficial IHs are situated higher in the skin and have a bright red, erythematous to reddish-purple appearance. Superficial lesions can be flat and telangiectatic, composed of a macule or patch of small, varied branching, capillary blood vessels. They can also be raised and elevated from the skin, forming papules and confluent bright-red plaques like raised islands. Infantile hemangiomas have historically been referred to as “strawberry marks&quot; or &quot;strawberry hemangiomas” in the past, as raised superficial hemangiomas can look like the side of a strawberry without seeds, and this remains a common lay term.

Superficial IHs in certain locations, such as the posterior scalp, neck folds, and groin/perianal areas, are at potential risk of ulceration. Ulcerated hemangiomas can present as black crusted papules or plaques, or painful erosions or ulcers. Ulcerations are prone to secondary bacterial infections, which can present with yellow crusting, drainage, pain, or odor. Ulcerations are also at risk for bleeding, particularly deep lesions or in areas of friction. Multiple superficial hemangiomas, more than five, can be associated with extracutaneous hemangiomas, the most common being a liver (hepatic) hemangioma, and these infants warrant ultrasound examination.

Deep IHs present as poorly defined, bluish macules that can proliferate into papules, nodules, or larger tumors. Proliferating lesions are often compressible, but fairly firm. Many deep hemangiomas may have a few superficial capillaries visible evident over the primary deep component or surrounding venous prominence. Deep hemangiomas have a tendency to develop a little later than superficial hemangiomas, and may have longer and later proliferative phases, as well. Deep hemangiomas rarely ulcerate, but can cause issues depending on their location, size, and growth. Deep hemangiomas near sensitive structures can cause compression of softer surrounding structures during the proliferative phase, such as the external ear canal and the eyelid. Mixed hemangiomas are simply a combination of superficial and deep hemangiomas, and may not be evident for several months. Patients may have any combination of superficial, deep, or mixed IHs.

IHs are often classified as focal/localized, segmental, or indeterminate. Focal IHs appear localized to a specific location and appear to arise from a solitary spot. Segmental hemangiomas are larger, and appear to encompass a region of the body. Larger or segmental hemangiomas that span a large area can sometimes have underlying anomalies that may require investigation, especially when located on the face, sacrum, or pelvis.

Unless ulceration occurs, an IH does not tend to bleed and is not painful. Discomfort may arise if it is bulky and blocks a vital orifice.

===Complications===
Almost no IHs are associated with complications. They may break down on the surface, called ulceration, which can be painful and problematic. If the ulceration is deep, significant discomfort, bleeding and infection may occur. If a hemangioma develops in the larynx, breathing can be compromised. If located near the eye, a growing hemangioma may cause an occlusion or deviation of the eye that can lead to amblyopia. Very rarely, extremely large hemangiomas can cause high-output heart failure due to the amount of blood that must be pumped to excess blood vessels. Lesions adjacent to bone may cause erosion of the bone.

The most frequent complaints about IHs stem from psychosocial complications. The condition can affect a person&#x27;s appearance and provoke attention and malicious reactions from others. Particular problems occur if the lip or nose is involved, as distortions can be difficult to treat surgically. The potential for psychological injury develops from school age onward. Considering treatment before school begins is, therefore, important if adequate spontaneous improvement has not occurred. Large IHs can leave visible skin changes secondary to severe stretching that results in altered surface texture.

Large segmental hemangiomas of the head and neck can be associated with a disorder called PHACES syndrome. Large segmental hemangiomas over the lumbar spine can be associated with dysraphism, renal, and urogenital problems in association with a disorder called LUMBAR syndrome. Multiple cutaneous hemangiomas in infants may be an indicator for liver hemangiomas. Screening for liver involvement is often recommended in infants with five or more skin hemangiomas.

==Causes==
The cause of hemangioma is currently unknown, but several studies have suggested the importance of estrogen signaling in proliferation. Localized soft-tissue hypoxia coupled with increased circulating estrogen after birth may be the stimulus. Also, a hypothesis was presented by researchers that maternal placenta embolizes to the fetal dermis during gestation, resulting in hemangiomagenesis. However, another group of researchers conducted genetic analyses of single-nucleotide polymorphism in hemangioma tissue compared to the mother&#x27;s DNA which contradicted this hypothesis. Other studies have revealed the role of increased angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in the etiology of hemangiomas. 

==Diagnosis==

The majority of IHs can be diagnosed by history and physical examination. In rare cases, imaging (ultrasound with Doppler, magnetic resonance imaging), and/or cytology or histopathology are needed to confirm the diagnosis. IHs are usually absent at birth or a small area of pallor, telangiectasias, or duskiness may be seen. A fully formed mass at birth usually indicates a different diagnosis. Superficial hemangiomas in the upper dermis have a bright-red strawberry color, whereas those in the deep dermis and subcutis, deep hemangiomas, may appear blue and be firm or rubbery on palpation. Mixed hemangiomas can have both features. A minimally proliferative IH is an uncommon type that presents with fine macular telangiectasias with an occasional bright-red, papular, proliferative component. Minimally proliferative IHs are more common in the lower body.

A precise history of the growth characteristics of the IH can be very helpful in making the diagnosis. In the first 4 to 8 weeks of life, IHs grow rapidly with primarily volumetric rather than radial growth. This is usually followed by a period of slower growth that can last 6–9 months, with 80% of the growth completed by 3 months. Finally, IHs involute over a period of years. The exceptions to these growth characteristics include minimally proliferative His, which do not substantially proliferate and large, deep IHs in which noticeable growth starts later and lasts longer. 
If the diagnosis is not clear based on physical examination and growth history (most often in deep hemangiomas with little cutaneous involvement), then either imaging or histopathology can help confirm the diagnosis. On Doppler ultrasound, an IH in the proliferative phase appears as a high-flow, soft-tissue mass usually without direct arteriovenous shunting. On MRI, IHs show a well-circumscribed lesion with intermediate and increased signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted sequences, respectively, and strong enhancement after gadolinium injections, with fast-flow vessels. Tissue for diagnosis can be obtained via fine-needle aspiration, skin biopsy, or excisional biopsy. Under the microscope, IHs are unencapsulated aggregates of closely packed, thin-walled capillaries, usually with endothelial lining. Blood-filled vessels are separated by scant connective tissue. Their lumina may be thrombosed and organized. Hemosiderin pigment deposition due to vessel rupture may be observed. The GLUT-1 histochemical marker can be helpful in distinguishing IHs from other items on the differential diagnosis, such as vascular malformations.

===Liver===
Infantile hemangiomas in the liver are found in 16% of all liver hemangiomas. Its sizes are usually less than 1 to 2 cm in diameter. It may show a &quot;flash-filling&quot; phenomenon in which there is a fast enhancement of the contrast material in the lesion instead of slow, centripetal, nodular filling of the lesions in usual hemangiomas. On CT and MRI, it shows rapid filling during arterial phase, with contrast retention in venous and delayed phases.

==Treatment==
Most IHs disappear without treatment, leaving minimal to no visible marks. This may take many years, however, and a proportion of lesions may require some form of therapy. Multidisciplinary clinical practice guidelines for the management of infantile hemangiomas were recently published. Indications for treatment include functional impairment (i.e. visual or feeding compromise), bleeding, potentially life-threatening complications (airway, cardiac, or hepatic disease), and risk of long-term or permanent disfigurement. Large IHs can leave visible skin changes secondary to significant stretching of the skin or alteration of surface texture. When they interfere with vision, breathing, or threaten significant disfigurement (most notably facial lesions, and in particular, nose and lips), they are usually treated. Medical therapies are most effective when used during the period of most significant hemangioma growth, which corresponds to the first 5 months of life. Ulcerated hemangiomas, a subset of lesions requiring therapy, are usually treated by addressing wound care, pain, and hemangioma growth.

===Medication===
Treatment options for IHs include medical therapies (systemic, intralesional, and topical), surgery, and laser therapy. Prior to 2008, the mainstay of therapy for problematic hemangiomas was oral corticosteroids, which are effective and remain an option for patients in whom beta-blocker therapy is contraindicated or poorly tolerated. Following the serendipitous observation that propranolol, a nonselective beta blocker, is well tolerated and effective for treatment of hemangiomas, the agent was studied in a large, randomized, controlled trial and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for this indication in 2014. Oral propranolol is more effective than placebo, observation without intervention, or oral corticosteroids. Propranolol has subsequently become the first-line systemic medical therapy for treatment of these lesions.

Since that time, topical timolol maleate in addition to oral propranalol has become a common therapy for infantile hemangiomas. According to a 2018 Cochrane review, both of these therapies have demonstrated beneficial effects in terms of clearance of hemangiomas without an increase in harms. In addition, no difference was detected between these two agents and their ability to reduce hemangioma size; however, whether a difference in safety exists is not clear. All of these results were based on moderate- to low-quality evidence, thus further randomized, controlled trials with large populations of children are needed to further evaluate these therapies. This review concluded that for now, no evidence challenges oral propranalol as the standard systemic therapy for treatment of these lesions.

Other systemic therapies which may be effective for IH treatment include vincristine, interferon, and other agents with antiangiogenic properties. Vincristine, which requires central venous access for administration, is traditionally used as a chemotherapy agent, but has been demonstrated to have efficacy against hemangiomas and other childhood vascular tumors, such as kaposiform hemangioendothelioma and tufted angioma. Interferon-alpha 2a and 2b, given by subcutaneous injection, has shown efficacy against hemangiomas, but may result in spastic diplegia in up to 20% of treated children. These agents are rarely used now in the era of beta-blocker therapy.

Intralesional corticosteroid (usually triamcinolone) injection has been used for small, localized hemangiomas, where it has been demonstrated to be relatively safe and effective. Injection of upper eyelid hemangiomas is controversial, given the reported risk of retinal embolization, possibly related to high injection pressures. Topical timolol maleate, a nonselective beta blocker available in a gel-forming solution approved for the treatment of glaucoma, has been increasingly recognized as a safe and effective off-label alternative for treatment of small hemangiomas. It is generally applied two to three times daily.

===Surgery===
Surgical excision of hemangiomas is rarely indicated, and limited to lesions which fail medical therapy (or when it is contraindicated), which are anatomically distributed in a location which is amenable to resection, and in which resection would likely be necessary and the scar will be similar regardless of timing of the surgery. Surgery may also be useful for removal of residual fibrofatty tissue (following hemangioma involution) and reconstruction of damaged structures.

===Laser===
Laser therapy, most often the pulsed dye laser (PDL), plays a limited role in hemangioma management. PDL is most often used for treatment of ulcerated hemangiomas, often in conjunction with topical therapies and wound care, and may speed healing and diminish pain. Laser therapy may also be useful for early superficial IHs (although rapidly proliferating lesions may be more prone to ulceration following PDL treatment), and for the treatment of cutaneous telangiectasias which persist following involution.

==Prognosis==

In the involution phase, an IH finally begins to diminish in size. While IHs were previously thought to improve by about 10% each year, newer evidence suggests that maximal improvement and involution is typically reached by 3.5 years of age. Most IHs resolve by age 10, but in some patients, the hemangioma does not completely resolve. Residual redness may be noted and can be improved with laser therapy, most commonly PDL. Ablative fractional resurfacing may be considered for textural skin changes. Hemangiomas, especially those that have gotten very large during the growth phase, may leave behind stretched skin or fibrofatty tissue that may be disfiguring or require future surgical correction. Areas of prior ulceration may leave behind permanent scarring.

Additional long-term sequelae stem from the identification of extracutaneous manifestations in association with the IH. For example, a patient with a large facial hemangioma who is found to meet criteria for PHACE syndrome will require potentially ongoing neurologic, cardiac, and/or ophthalmologic monitoring. In cases of IHs that compromise of vital structures, symptoms may improve with involution of the hemangioma. For example, respiratory distress would improve with involution of a space-occupying IH involving the airway and high-output heart failure may lessen with involution of a hepatic hemangioma and ultimately treatment may be tapered or discontinued. In other cases, such as an untreated eyelid hemangioma, resultant amblyopia does not improve with involution of the cutaneous lesion. For these reasons, infants with infantile hemangiomas should be evaluated by an appropriate clinician during the early proliferative phase so that risk monitoring and treatment be individualized and outcomes can be optimized.

==Terminology==

The terminology used to define, describe, and categorize vascular tumors and malformations has changed over time. The term hemangioma was originally used to describe any vascular tumor-like structure, whether it was present at or around birth or appeared later in life. In 1982, Mulliken and Glowacki proposed a new classification system for vascular anomalies which has been widely accepted and adopted by the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies. This classification system was recently updated in 2015. The classification of vascular anomalies is now based upon cellular features, natural history, and clinical behavior of the lesion. Vascular anomalies are divided into vascular tumors/neoplasms which include infantile hemangiomas, and vascular malformations that include entities with enlarged or abnormal vessels such as capillary malformations (port wine stains), venous malformations, and lymphatic malformations. In 2000, GLUT-1, a specific immunohistochemical marker, was found to be positive in IHs and negative in other vascular tumors or malformations. This marker has revolutionized the ability to distinguish between infantile hemangioma and other vascular anomalies.

<doc id="862515" wikidata="Q57788611" url="?curid=862515" title="The American Scholar">
<text>&quot;The American Scholar&quot; was a speech given by Ralph Waldo Emerson on August 31, 1837, to Phi Beta Kappa society of Harvard College at the First Parish in Cambridge in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was invited to speak in recognition of his groundbreaking work &quot;Nature&quot;, published a year earlier, in which he established a new way for America&#x27;s fledgling society to regard the world. Sixty years after declaring independence, American culture was still heavily influenced by Europe, and Emerson, for possibly the first time in the country&#x27;s history, provided a visionary philosophical framework for escaping &quot;from under its iron lids&quot; and building a new, distinctly American cultural identity.

==Summary==
Emerson introduces Transcendentalist and Romantic views to explain an American scholar&#x27;s relationship to nature. A few key points he makes include:
* We are all fragments, &quot;as the hand is divided into fingers&quot;, of a greater creature, which is mankind itself.
* An individual may live in either of two states. In one, the busy, &quot;divided&quot; or &quot;degenerate&quot; state, he does not &quot;possess himself&quot; but identifies with his occupation or a monotonous action; in the other, &quot;right&quot; state, he is elevated to &quot;Man&quot;, at one with all mankind.
* To achieve this higher state of mind, the modern American scholar must reject old ideas and think for him or herself, to become &quot;Man Thinking&quot; rather than &quot;a mere thinker, or still worse, the parrot of other men&#x27;s thinking&quot;, &quot;the victim of society&quot;, &quot;the sluggard intellect of this continent&quot;.
* &quot;The American Scholar&quot; has an obligation, as &quot;Man Thinking&quot;, within this &quot;One Man&quot; concept, to see the world clearly, not severely influenced by traditional and historical views, and to broaden his understanding of the world from fresh eyes, to &quot;defer never to the popular cry.&quot;
* The scholar&#x27;s education consists of three influences:
** I. Nature, as the most important influence on the mind
** II. The Past, manifest in books
**III. Action and its relation to experience
* The last, unnumbered part of the text is devoted to Emerson&#x27;s view on the &quot;Duties&quot; of the American Scholar who has become the &quot;Man Thinking&quot;.
* &quot;The scholar must needs stand wistful and admiring before this great spectacle. He must settle its value in his mind.&quot;

==Importance==
Emerson was, in part, reflecting on his personal vocational crisis after leaving his role as a minister. Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. declared this speech to be &quot;the declaration of independence of American intellectual life.&quot; Building on the growing attention he received from the essay &quot;Nature&quot;, &quot;The American Scholar&quot; solidified Emerson&#x27;s popularity and weight in America, a level of reverence he would hold throughout the rest of his life. Phi Beta Kappa&#x27;s literary quarterly magazine, &quot;The American Scholar&quot;, was named after the speech.

This success stands in contrast with the harsh reaction to another of his speeches, &quot;Divinity School Address&quot;, given eleven months later.

<doc id="862521" wikidata="Q1810722" url="?curid=862521" title="National Trails System">
<text>The National Trails System is a series of trails in the United States designated &quot;to promote the preservation of, public access to, travel within, and enjoyment and appreciation of the open-air, outdoor areas and historic resources of the Nation&quot;. There are four types of trails: the national scenic trails, national historic trails, national recreation trails, and connecting or side trails. The national trails provide opportunities for hiking and historic education, as well as horseback riding, biking, camping, scenic driving, water sports, and other activities. The National Trails System consists of 11 national scenic trails, 21 national historic trails, over 1,300 national recreation trails, and seven connecting and side trails, as well as one national geologic trail, with a total length of more than . The scenic and historic trails are in every state, and Virginia and Wyoming have the most running through them, with six. 

In response to a call by President Lyndon B. Johnson to have a cooperative program to build public trails for &quot;the forgotten outdoorsmen of today&quot; in both urban and backcountry areas, the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation released a report in 1966 entitled &quot;Trails for America&quot;. The study made recommendations for a network of national scenic trails, park and forest trails, and metropolitan area trails to provide recreational opportunities, with evaluations of several possible trails, both scenic and historic. The program for long-distance natural trails was created on October 2, 1968, by the National Trails System Act, which also designated two national scenic trails, the Appalachian Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail, and requested that an additional fourteen trail routes be studied for possible inclusion. Sponsored by Senators Henry M. Jackson and Gaylord Nelson and Representative Roy A. Taylor, part of the bill&#x27;s impetus was threats of development along the Appalachian Trail, which was at risk of losing its wilderness character, and the Land and Water Conservation Fund was used to acquire lands. In 1978, as a result of the study of trails that were most significant for their historic associations, national historic trails were created as a new category with four trails designated that year. Since 1968, over forty trail routes have been studied for inclusion in the system.

The scenic and historic trails are congressionally established long-distance trails, administered by the National Park Service (NPS), United States Forest Service (USFS), and/or Bureau of Land Management (BLM). These agencies may acquire lands to protect key rights of way, sites, resources and viewsheds, though the trails do not have fixed boundaries. They work in cooperation with each other, states, local governments, land trusts, and private landowners to coordinate and protect lands and structures along these trails, enabling them to be accessible to the public. These partnerships between the agency administrators and local site managers are vital for resource protection and the visitor experience. The Federal Interagency Council on the National Trails System promotes collaboration and standardization in trail development and protection. National recreation trails and connecting and side trails do not require congressional action, but are recognized by actions of the secretary of the interior or the secretary of agriculture. The national trails are supported by volunteers at private non-profit organizations that work with the federal agencies under the Partnership for the National Trails System and other trail type-specific advocacy groups.

For fiscal year 2021, the 24 trails administered by the NPS received a budget of $15.4 million.

==National Scenic Trails==

The eleven national scenic trails were established to provide outdoor recreation opportunities and to conserve portions of the natural landscape with significant scenic, natural, cultural, or historic importance. These trails are continuous non-motorized long-distance trails that can be backpacked from end-to-end or hiked for short segments, except for Natchez Trace NST, which consists of five shorter, disconnected trail segments. The &quot;Trails for America&quot; report said, &quot;Each National Scenic Trail should stand out in its own right as a recreation resource of superlative quality and of physical challenge.&quot; Most notably, the national scenic trail system provides access to the crest of the Appalachian Mountains in the east via the Appalachian Trail, of the Rocky Mountains in the west on the Continental Divide Trail, and of the Cascade and Sierra Nevada ranges on the Pacific Crest Trail, which make up the Triple Crown of Hiking. Other places of note include the southern wetlands and Gulf Coast on the Florida Trail, the North Woods on the North Country Trail, the variety of southwestern mountains and ecosystems on the Arizona Trail, and the remote high-mountain landscape near the Canadian border on the Pacific Northwest Trail. 

They have a total length of approximately . Due to the extent of construction of route realignments, segment alternatives, and measurement methods, some sources vary in their distances reported and values may be rounded. 

Six trails are official units of the NPS, managed like its other areas, as long, linear parks. Five trails are overseen by the U.S. Forest Service. 

In 2022 Arlette Laan, whose trail name was &quot;Apple Pie&quot;, became the first woman known to have completely hiked all eleven national scenic trails.

==National Historic Trails==

The 21 national historic trails are designated to protect the courses of significant overland or water routes that reflect the history of the nation. They represent the earliest European travels in the country in Chesapeake Bay and on Spanish royal roads; the nation&#x27;s struggle for independence on the Overmountain Victory National Historic Trail and Washington–Rochambeau Revolutionary Route; westward migrations on the Oregon, California, and Mormon Trails, which traverse some of the same route; and the development of continental commerce on the Santa Fe Trail, Old Spanish Trail, and Pony Express. They also memorialize the forced displacement and hardships of the Native Americans on the Trail of Tears and Nez Perce National Historic Trail.

Their routes follow the nationally significant, documented historical journeys of notable individuals or groups but are not necessarily meant to be continuously traversed today; they are largely networks of partner sites along marked auto routes rather than the exact non-motorized trails as originally used. Interpretative sites are often at other areas of the National Park System along the trails, as well as locally operated museums and sites. The National Historic Trails Interpretive Center in Wyoming is on the Oregon, California, Mormon Pioneer, and Pony Express National Historic Trails and has exhibits on Western emigration. Nine are administered by the NPS National Trails Office in Santa Fe and Salt Lake City. 

National historic trails were authorized under the National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978 (), amending the National Trails System Act of 1968. They have a total length of approximately ; many trails include several branches making them much longer than a single end-to-end distance.

== Connecting or side trails==
The act also established a category of trails known as connecting or side trails. Though there are no guidelines for how these are managed, these have been designated by the secretary of the interior to extend trails beyond the original congressionally established route. Seven side trails have been designated:

* Timms Hill Trail – , connects the Ice Age Trail to Wisconsin&#x27;s highest point, Timms Hill (1990)
* Anvik Connector – , joins the Iditarod Trail to the village of Anvik, Alaska (1990)
*Susquehanna River Component Connecting Trail – , extends the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail up the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania and New York (2012)
*Chester River Component Connecting Trail – , extends the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail up the Chester River in Maryland (2012)
*Upper Nanticoke River Component Connecting Trail – , extends the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail up the Nanticoke River in Delaware (2012)
*Upper James River Component Connecting Trail – , extends the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail up the James River in Virginia (2012)
*Marion to Selma Connecting Trail – , connects the Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail to Marion, Alabama, where Jimmie Lee Jackson was murdered in 1965 (2015)

==National Recreation Trails==
National recreation trail (NRT) is a designation given to existing trails that contribute to the recreational and conservation goals of a national network of trails. Over 1,300 trails over all fifty states have been designated as NRTs on federal, state, municipal, tribal and private lands that are available for public use and are less than a mile to more than in length. They have a combined length of more than .

Most NRTs are hiking trails, but a significant number are multi-use trails or bike paths, including rail trails and greenways. Some are intended for use with watercraft, horses, cross-country skis, or off-road recreational vehicles. There are a number of water trails that make up the National Water Trails System subprogram. Eligible trails must be complete, well designed and maintained, and open to the public.

The NPS and the USFS jointly administer the National Recreation Trails Program with help from other federal and nonprofit partners, notably American Trails, the lead nonprofit for developing and promoting NRTs. The secretary of interior or the secretary of agriculture (if on USFS land) designates national recreation trails that are of local and regional significance. Managers of eligible trails can apply for designation with the support of all landowners and their state&#x27;s trail coordinator (if on non-federal land). Designated trails become part of the National Trails System and receive promotional benefits, use of the NRT logo, technical and networking assistance, and preference for funding through the Department of Transportation&#x27;s Recreational Trails Program.

American Trails sponsors an annual NRT photo contest and a biennial symposium and maintains the NRT database.

== National Geologic Trail ==
The first national geologic trail was established by the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, though it did not amend the National Trails System Act to create an official category.

<text>Interstate 376 (I-376) is a major auxiliary route of the Interstate Highway System in the US state of Pennsylvania, located within the Allegheny Plateau. It runs from I-80 near Sharon south and east to a junction with the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76, its parent) in Monroeville, after having crossed the Pennsylvania Turnpike at an interchange in Big Beaver. The route serves Pittsburgh and its surrounding areas and is the main access road to Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT). Portions of the route are known as the Beaver Valley Expressway, Southern Expressway, and Airport Parkway. Within Allegheny County, the route runs along the majority of the Penn-Lincoln Parkway, known locally as Parkway West and Parkway East. It is currently the ninth-longest auxiliary Interstate route in the system and second only to I-476 within Pennsylvania.

I-376 is signed east–west despite running north–south for nearly three-quarters of its length; however, it does run east–west through the majority of Allegheny County. This is because, until 2009, the route&#x27;s western terminus was at I-279 in Downtown Pittsburgh; it was extended west and north to I-80 to give the corridor a single route designation. Despite the route&#x27;s direction, it serves as a major artery through Pittsburgh&#x27;s West End, with I-79 being the primary route through Pittsburgh&#x27;s North Hills. Since its 2009 extension, the route has also served as a major way to access Northeast Ohio.

A stretch of the Beaver Valley Expressway, officially named the James E. Ross Highway, from exit 15 where I-376 ends its brief concurrency with U.S. Route 422 (US 422) to exit 31 where I-376 has its first interchange with Pennsylvania Route 51 (PA 51), is tolled and is maintained by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission (PTC), while the remainder of the highway is maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT). Near the airport, I-376 also has a business loop.

==Route description==
===Beaver Valley Expressway and Airport Parkway===
I-376 begins at a cloverleaf interchange with I-80 and PA 760 located east of Ohio within the Glaciated Allegheny Plateau. From there, it travels in a southerly direction on the Beaver Valley Expressway, a four-lane freeway with a wide grass median. Paralleling PA 18, I-376 has its first interchange with that state highway in West Middlesex.

I-376 soon meets US 422 and forms an overlap with that highway along the west side of New Castle. After an interchange with US 224 in Union Township, I-376 eastbound splits from US 422 at a trumpet interchange southwest of the city in Taylor Township. At this point, I-376 becomes a toll road officially named the James E. Ross Highway.

I-376 continues southward, still paralleled by PA 18 and the Beaver River to the east. Shortly after entering Beaver County near Koppel, the route connects to its parent route I-76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike) for the first time at an interchange which also provides access to PA 351. Around this area, I-376 crosses into the Unglaciated Allegheny Plateau, where it remains for the remainder of its length.

I-376 then passes to the east of West Mayfield and becomes a non-tolled highway again at its first interchange with PA 51 in Chippewa Township, just west of Beaver Falls. The freeway then weaves through mountainous terrain, interchanging with PA 68 in Vanport just before crossing the Vanport Bridge over the Ohio River. It then has its second interchange with PA 18 near Kobuta and continues south from there. I-376 passes to the west of Aliquippa before leaving Beaver County and entering Allegheny County.

Approaching PIT, I-376 bends south-southwest and becomes the Southern Expressway, while the Beaver Valley Expressway diverges to the southeast along I-376 Business (I-376 Bus). I-376 circles around the southern edge of the airport, intersecting the western terminus of the Southern Beltway (PA Turnpike 576) at the main entrance to PIT before recombining with I-376 Bus and becoming the Airport Parkway, still four lanes and with a narrow median.

===Parkway West===

Now traveling southeast, the route comes to a partial cloverleaf interchange with the Penn-Lincoln Parkway (US 22 and US 30) and Steubenville Pike (PA 60) in Robinson Township. The two US Routes join I-376 here in a partially-unsigned concurrency (indicated only on reassurance markers), continuing east-southeastward bearing the Penn-Lincoln Parkway name, and soon reach an interchange with I-79. From that point eastward, along what was known for many years as I-279, I-376 runs east-southeast through Rosslyn Farms and Carnegie before turning northeast and passing through Green Tree.

Entering the city of Pittsburgh, I-376 winds its way northeast to its second interchange with PA 51 at Saw Mill Run Boulevard, which is also part of a spread-out series of ramps linking Banksville Road (US 19) and US 19 Truck. This junction, located just before the freeway passes under Mount Washington in the Fort Pitt Tunnel, features the infamous wrong-way concurrency of the northbound and southbound directions of US 19 Truck.
After passing through the Fort Pitt Tunnel, I-376 emerges onto the four-lane double-deck Fort Pitt Bridge, crossing over the Monongahela River. There are single-lane westbound exit and eastbound entrance ramps connecting Carson Street to the freeway between the tunnel&#x27;s portal and the bridge. Once across the river, the route touches down in Downtown Pittsburgh at Point State Park. An interchange at the Point connects I-376 to I-279 (Parkway North), which leads to the Fort Duquesne Bridge, as well as Liberty Avenue.

===Parkway East===
I-376 continues east from the Point, still carrying the partially-unsigned US 22 and US 30, following the north shore of the Monongahela River through the south side of the downtown area (the westbound area by Downtown from Grant Street to the Fort Pitt Bridge is locally known as the &quot;Bathtub&quot; because of a tendency of the underpass to flood in heavy rains). The road then continues to the adjacent neighborhoods of Uptown and Oakland. The Parkway East eventually turns away from the river near the southwestern corner of Schenley Park and runs along that park&#x27;s southern border before passing through the Squirrel Hill Tunnel under Squirrel Hill.
Parkway East exits the city of Pittsburgh near the southeastern corner of Frick Park, and US 30 leaves the freeway shortly thereafter at PA 8 in the suburb of Wilkinsburg. I-376 and US 22 (now fully signed) continue in a generally easterly direction through Churchill, Wilkins Township, Penn Hills, and finally Monroeville, where I-376 ends at an interchange with the Pennsylvania Turnpike and US 22 Bus. US 22 continues east from this interchange on the William Penn Highway toward Murrysville.
==Tolls==
The James E. Ross Highway portion of I-376 between US 422 and PA 51 uses all-electronic tolling, with tolls payable by toll by plate (which uses automatic license plate recognition to take a photo of the vehicle&#x27;s license plate and mail a bill to the vehicle owner) or E-ZPass. The tolled section of I-376 has two mainline toll plazas: the West Mainline Toll Plaza near milepost 18 and the East Mainline Toll Plaza near milepost 30. , the West Mainline Toll Plaza costs $5.50 using toll by plate and $2.90 using E-ZPass for passenger vehicles while the East Mainline Toll Plaza costs $3.50 using toll by plate and $1.50 using E-ZPass for passenger vehicles. There are also ramp tolls at the eastbound exit and westbound entrance at exit 17, the westbound exit and eastbound entrance at exit 20, and the eastbound exit and westbound entrance at exit 29, which charge $3.50 using toll by plate and $1.50 using E-ZPass for passenger vehicles. As part of Act 44, tolls are to be increased every year in January.

The tolled portion of I-376 is the most expensive portion of the Pennsylvania Turnpike system per mile, charging toll-by-plate users an average of and E-ZPass users . This is in stark contrast to the mainline Turnpike, which charges less than for E-ZPass users and more than for cash users. This is due to the bonds on newer sections of the Turnpike system (such as the James E. Ross Highway, Amos K. Hutchinson Bypass, Mon–Fayette Expressway, and the Southern Beltway) having not been paid for yet (in the case of the latter two, are only partially completed), whereas the mainline Turnpike and the Northeastern Extension had their bonds paid for decades ago. Even with the newer sections factored in—most of which except for a portion of the Mon–Fayette Expressway from I-70 near Bentleyville to US 40 near Brownsville opened &quot;after&quot; the James E. Ross Highway opened—it is the most expensive portion of the Turnpike system per mile.

==History==

The first section of what would eventually become I-376 opened June 5, 1953, from PA 885 (Bates Street) near the Hot Metal Bridge east through the Squirrel Hill Tunnel to US 22 Bus (then US 22) at Churchill. Construction commenced on this stretch on July 25, 1946, near Wilkinsburg. The next section to open, running from PA 60 (Steubenville Pike, then US 22/US 30) near PIT east to Saw Mill Run Boulevard (PA 51 and US 19), opened October 15, 1953. At Steubenville Pike, it connected to PA 60—the Airport Parkway—which had been built c. 1950 as a high-speed surface road to provide access to the airport.

In 1955, the Baltimore and Ohio Station was demolished to make way for construction of the new freeway. In late 1956, it opened from the Boulevard of the Allies (then US 22/US 30) near the Birmingham Bridge east to Bates Street, with the eastbound lanes opening September 10 and westbound opening September 29. The other downtown sections opened in segments from January 17, 1958, to 1959, the total cost of the parkway at this time came to $112.11 million (equivalent to $ in ). The $6.31-million (equivalent to $ in ) Fort Pitt Bridge opened June 19, 1959, followed by the $16-million (equivalent to $ in ) Fort Pitt Tunnel on September 1, 1960, using the West End Bypass (PA 51) and Carson Street (PA 837) as detours until the Fort Pitt Tunnel opened. The Parkway East ended in Churchill, with eastbound traffic continuing ahead on the William Penn Highway, until the $11.12-million (equivalent to $ in ) extension east to the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Monroeville opened October 27, 1962. The final piece of Parkway West (the part which has never had an Interstate route number), from PA 60 west to the US 22/US 30 split at Imperial, opened in 1964. Early plans for that section would have instead taken it from PA 60 where it splits with PA 60 Bus. northwest to US 30 near Campmeeting Road at Clinton.

The next section that opened was in 1968 from the present-day exit 2 with PA 18 to where PA 18 intersects with the present-day PA 760 just north of I-80 and the western terminus of I-376.

Work began on the Beaver County sections of I-376 (in between Chippewa Township and the Airport Parkway) in 1971 and would finish by 1976. The following year, the northern section finished construction, which would leave a gap between New Castle and Chippewa Township for the next 15 years. Until the middle section was completed, in order to continue on the highway, travelers had to use US 422, PA 168, PA 18, PA 251, and PA 51 before returning to the highway. Until that section opened, the present-day exit 12A marked the southern terminus of the northern section of PA 60 as an &quot;END 60&quot; sign was located near the exit.

In the early to mid-1980s, the entire section from downtown to Monroeville was refurbished.

The Southern Expressway, a southern bypass of PIT, opened on September 9, 1992, and is the newest portion of I-376.
The next leg of the route opened to PA 108 in 1991 and to PA 51 in Chippewa on November 30, 1992, as the $260-million (equivalent to $ in ) &quot;missing link&quot; between two sections of PA 60, when that route&#x27;s designation was on the highway. The aforementioned &quot;END 60&quot; sign was removed when the first leg of the middle section opened in 1991, and a &quot;No re-entry this exit&quot; sign has sat on the site since due to exit 12A being an indirect connection to US 422 westbound without a direct reentry ramp.

In 2003, the toll plaza at the PA turnpike interchange was removed.

The PTC retrofitted E-ZPass lanes on the tolled section of I-376 in 2006 at both the two mainline toll plazas as well as the exits that collect tolls.
As part of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users in 2005, Congress had designated an expansion of I-376 past I-79 and along present day US 22/US 30 and PA 60 through Pittsburgh International Airport and north to I-80 near Sharon. This was done because the airport was one of the few major airports in the US without direct access to an Interstate Highway. This routing required some major infrastructure work on US 22 west of Downtown Pittsburgh (particularly at the US 22/US 30 cloverleaf interchange in Robinson Township) and safety improvements to PA 60; though both were controlled-access freeways before the extension, they were not up to Interstate Highway standards in all areas. The improvements to both the US 22/US 30 cloverleaf in Robinson Township and the Lawrence County leg of the route, as well as replacing all of the signs with the I-376 shield, were funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The designation of I-279 from Downtown west through the Fort Pitt Tunnel to I-79 was officially dropped and replaced by that of I-376 on June 10, 2009. I-279 still exists between I-376 in the Golden Triangle and I-79 in Franklin Park. On November 6, 2009, officials announced the initial transition was complete. On January 21, 2010, the remainder of the route except for the Beaver Valley Expressway started receiving the I-376 signs. The stretch of PA 60 from I-80 in Shenango Township of Mercer County north past PA 18 (where the freeway terminates and the highway reverts to being a two-lane arterial) to the former northern terminus of PA 60 in Sharon became PA 760. On August 1, 2010, signage along PA Turnpike 60 was officially changed to I-376, and, unlike other tolled highways with an Interstate designation, it is not grandfathered from Interstate standards. Having been built in the early 1990s, this section was already up to Interstate standards. This section of I-376 is signed as &quot;Toll I-376&quot;, with a black-on-yellow &quot;Toll&quot; sign above the I-376 trailblazer. This makes I-376 one of the first tolled Interstates with such a marker, which was a new addition to the 2009 edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Despite PennDOT giving motorists over four years of advance notice on the I-376 extension, some local drivers were confused after the transition was complete, thinking that the I-376 extension was going to be an all-new highway instead of a renaming of PA 60.

I n 2014, exit 1C was rebuilt into a full interchange rather than legacy eastbound exit, mainly to serve as access to I-80 to West Middlesex residents. It marked the third partial interchange on the legacy PA 60/Parkway West to be upgraded to a full-service interchange in a decade, after I-79 at exit 64A and access to US 30 at exit 52 were upgraded from partial to full-service interchanges.

Along with the Delaware River–Turnpike Toll Bridge (which is affected by the ongoing Pennsylvania Turnpike/Interstate 95 Interchange Project), the Beaver Valley Expressway became one of the first sections of the Pennsylvania Turnpike system to implement all-electronic tolling, which began along the Beaver Valley Expressway on April 30, 2017. The Beaver Valley Expressway was selected as a test area so that the PTC could work out any bugs with mailing non-E-ZPass users bills with their unpaid tolls.

A bridge crossing I-376 from Oakland to Greenfield, the Greenfield Bridge, gained some national notoriety on an episode of &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot; concerning infrastructure. The state could not immediately afford to replace the crumbling bridge, so instead a cover was built under the bridge to protect the vehicles on I-376. The Greenfield Bridge was finally demolished in December 2015, and a replacement was built over the following two years, officially opening on October 14, 2017.

===Route designations prior to 2009===

From PA 60 to I-376&#x27;s eastern terminus, I-376 has had the US 22 and US 30 designations for its entire history (US 30 exiting at Wilkinsburg). Until 1961, it also carried the PA 80 designation until that route was decommissioned due to Pennsylvania needing the designation for I-80 to the north. In 1956, PA 60 was commissioned to have the Airport Parkway and the former alignment of US 22 and US 30 to Pittsburgh&#x27;s West End.

From 1959 to 1964, I-70 occupied the highway east of PA 50 in Carnegie. When I-70 moved to its current alignment (replacing I-70S) in 1964, the route received the I-76 designation into Pittsburgh. West of Pittsburgh, from 1963 to 1970, I-79 occupied the route. In West Middlesex, the route would receive the PA 18 designation while the former alignment would receive a business route designation as PA 18 Business, since it served as a bypass of West Middlesex.

In 1970, I-79 swapped positions with I-279, necessitating that I-76 be extended to I-79. With commencement on the Beaver Valley Expressway in 1971, PA 60 was extended to its future northern terminus in Chippewa. Finally, on October 2, 1972, after I-76 west of Monroeville moved to the Pennsylvania Turnpike and replaced I-80S, the western part of the highway took the I-279 designation while the section from Pittsburgh east to Monroeville would become the first section with the I-376 designation. When I-376 was extended onto the Parkway West in 2009, I-279 was truncated to its current southern terminus at the former western terminus of I-376.

PA 18 Business was decommissioned in 1978 when PA 18 returned to its former alignment (where it has remained to this day) and PA 60 was extended all the way to Hermitage.

On November 30, 1992, the gap in Beaver County was completed with a toll highway.

When the Beaver Valley Expressway started opening in 1991, it would receive the &quot;PA Toll 60&quot; designation, because it was operated by the PTC. With the opening of the Southern Expressway in 1992, PA 60 moved to that highway, while the Airport Parkway received the PA 60 Bus designation. PA 60 was eventually extended to Sharon in 1997, ending at US 62 Bus.

==Exit list==
























==Business loop==

Interstate 376 Business (I-376 Bus) or Business Loop 376 (BL 376), known locally as the Airport Parkway, is a Interstate Highway business loop in Moon Township and Findlay Township in Pennsylvania. Its western terminus is at I-376 and Flaugherty Run Road (exits 50 and 51) north of PIT. Its eastern terminus is at I-376&#x27;s exit 57, southeast of PIT.

Before November 6, 2009, and after the Southern Expressway was completed in 1992, this road was known as PA 60 Bus. Prior to that, it had the regular PA 60 designation; this was also originally the last leg of the Parkway West which ended at the intersection with then-Beers School Road (now University Boulevard) and began as the Beaver Valley Expressway past the intersection. Much of the road is up to freeway standards, but several signaled at-grade intersections remain, making this multilane divided road a true expressway (unlike many of Pennsylvania&#x27;s freeways, which are often misleadingly named using the suffix expressway, since they are often called such in the northeast). I-376 Bus is one of only two business Interstate routes found in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the other being the business loop of I-83 in York.

<text>Sidney Francis Greene, Baron Greene of Harrow Weald, (12 February 1910 – 26 July 2004) was a trade union leader in the United Kingdom, serving as general secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen from 1957 to 1975. He promoted close ties between the union and the Labour Party, which have not persisted with its successor National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers.

Early in his career, after leaving school at age 14, Greene was a porter at Paddington station.

Appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1966 New Year&#x27;s Honours, he was Knighted in 1970. On 21 January 1975 he was created a life peer as Baron Greene of Harrow Weald, of Harrow in Greater London.

<text>Interstate 579 (I-579) is a north–south Interstate Highway entirely within Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The highway is long. I-579 is also known as the Crosstown Boulevard since it crosses the backside of Downtown Pittsburgh.

The northern terminus of I-579 is at I-279 beyond the north end of the Veterans Bridge; the southern terminus splits to the Liberty Bridge southbound and Boulevard of the Allies eastbound, which leads to I-376 east. The intersection of I-579 and I-279 is in one direction only; northbound traffic on I-579 can proceed only northbound on I-279 while only southbound traffic on I-279 can exit onto I-579.

I-579 allows Liberty Bridge traffic easy access to I-279, and I-279 southbound traffic easier access to PPG Paints Arena, downtown, and eastern regions of the city, while I-279 southbound continues to Acrisure Stadium, PNC Park, and to westbound I-376 which leads to Pittsburgh International Airport.

==Route description==
I-579 begins at an interchange with Pennsylvania Route 885 (PA 885; Boulevard of the Allies) and the approach to the Liberty Bridge over the Monongahela River in Downtown Pittsburgh, heading to the north-northeast as a four-lane freeway. At the southern terminus, the highway has a northbound exit and southbound entrance providing access to 6th Avenue and Forbes Avenue near Duquesne University. The road passes several skyscrapers as it comes to an interchange at Centre Avenue with a northbound exit and southbound entrance that provides access to the PPG Paints Arena. Immediately following is a left exit in the northbound direction and a southbound entrance that connects to 7th Avenue that serves the David L. Lawrence Convention Center. At this point, I-579 runs to the west of the former site of the Civic Arena and comes to the PA 380 interchange, a northbound exit and southbound entrance, in addition to a southbound exit and northbound entrance accessing 6th Avenue and 7th Avenue. The freeway turns north as it passes over railroad tracks to the east of Union Station, the Amtrak station serving Pittsburgh. Here, it is seven lanes total with three travel lanes in each direction and two reversible high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes) in the center. The HOV lanes connect to Bedford Avenue near the Civic Arena at the south end. The highway turns northwest as it crosses the Allegheny River on the Veterans Bridge. A short distance after the bridge, I-579 ends at an interchange with I-279/US Route 19 Truck (US 19 Truck) and PA 28, at which point the route merges into northbound I-279 with ramps to and from westbound PA 28.

==History==

I-579&#x27;s roots go back to 1966 when the short Crosstown Boulevard from the Boulevard of the Allies (PA 885) to Bigelow Boulevard (PA 380) was designated as Interstate 479 (I-479).
Despite the choice of number, its parent I-79 was only completed in certain areas; there would be no connection of the two routes until 1989. By 1971, with only little progression of I-79 near I-479&#x27;s northern terminus and easy (but indirect) access to then-I-76 (now I-376 Parkway East) from the southern terminus, I-479 was renumbered as Interstate 876 (I-876). 

This was renumbered again on October 2, 1972, as its current designation of I-579; in addition, I-79&#x27;s designation from Pittsburgh to Robinson Township was &quot;swapped&quot; with I-279&#x27;s segment south of the Ohio River from PA 51 to the Parkway West interchange. In 1989, both of I-79&#x27;s auxiliary routes were finally connected with the openings of I-279 (Parkway North) from the Fort Duquesne Bridge/North Shore to its northern terminus at I-79 in Franklin Park and the Veterans Bridge which extended I-579 across the Allegheny River to its new northern terminus at I-279 in Pittsburgh&#x27;s East Allegheny neighborhood.

In 2019, the I-579 Cap Urban Connector Project began in order to build a pedestrian park over I-579 with the goal of better connecting downtown to the Hill District. The project was completed in 2021 and the park opened to the public on November 22, 2021.

<doc id="862544" wikidata="Q1184502" url="?curid=862544" title="Rafael Hernández Marín">
<text>Rafael Hernández Marín (October 24, 1892 – December 11, 1965) was a Puerto Rican songwriter and the author of hundreds of popular songs in the Latin American repertoire. He specialized in Cuban styles, such as the canción, bolero and guaracha. Among his most famous compositions are &quot;Lamento Borincano,” &quot;Capullito de alhelí,” &quot;Campanitas de cristal,” &quot;Cachita,” &quot;Silencio,” &quot;El cumbanchero,” &quot;Ausencia,” and &quot;Perfume de gardenias.”

== Career ==

===Early years===
Rafael Hernández Marín was born in the town of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, into a poor family, on October 24, 1892. His parents were María Hernández Marín and Miguel Angel Rosa, though he was given only his mother&#x27;s surname. As a child, he learned the craft of cigar making, from which he made a modest living. He also grew to love music and asked his parents to permit him to become a full-time music student. When he was 12 years old, Hernández studied music in San Juan, under the guidance of music professors Jose Ruellan Lequenica and Jesús Figueroa. He learned to play many musical instruments, including the clarinet, tuba, violin, piano, and guitar. At 14, he played for the Cocolia Orquestra. Hernández moved to San Juan where he played for the municipal orchestra under the director Manuel Tizol. In 1913, Hernández begot his first child, Antonio Hernández (out of wedlock), to Ana Bone.

===World War I and the Orchestra Europe===

In 1917, Hernández was working as a musician in North Carolina, when the United States entered World War I. The jazz bandleader, James Reese Europe, recruited brothers Rafael and Jesús Hernández, along with 16 more Puerto Ricans, to join the United States Army&#x27;s Harlem Hell fighters musical band, the Orchestra Europe. He enlisted and was assigned to the U.S. 369th Infantry Regiment (formerly known as the 15th Infantry Regiment, New York National Guard, created in New York City June 2, 1913). The regiment, nicknamed &quot;The Harlem Hell Fighters,” by the Germans, served in France. Hernández toured Europe with the Orchestra Europe. The 369th was awarded the French Croix de Guerre for battlefield gallantry by the President of France.

===Hernandez and Pedro Flores, Life in Cuba and Mexico===
After World War I ended, he returned to the United States in 1919. Hernández began a long and intense period of artistic composition and performance. He was part of the Lucky Roberts Band, with which he made his first musical tour of the United States. Later, he moved to Cuba, where he directed the Fausto Theater orchestra in Havana. Later on, Hernández moved to New York City. In 1925, he started writing songs and organized a trio called &quot;Trio Borincano.” In 1926, fellow Puerto Rican Pedro Flores, who was a composer, joined the Trio. Even though Hernández and Flores became and always remained good friends, they soon went their separate ways and artistically competed against each other. After the trio broke up, he formed a quartet called &quot;Cuarteto Victoria,&quot; which included singer Myrta Silva, also known as &quot;La Guarachera&quot; and &quot;La Gorda de Oro&quot;. With both groups, Hernández traveled and played his music all over the United States and Latin America. On September 2, 1927, Hernández&#x27;s sister, Victoria, opened Casa Hernandez, a music store which also acted as a booking agency and base of operations for her brother. In 1929, Trío Borinquen recorded &quot;Linda Quisqueya&quot; (originally titled &quot;Linda Borinquen&quot;) and that same year, he founded the &quot;Cuarteto Victoria&quot; (also known as &quot;El Cuarteto Rico&quot;) named after his sister.

In 1932, Hernández moved to Mexico. There, he directed an orchestra and enrolled in Mexico&#x27;s National Music Conservatory, to further enrich his musical knowledge. Hernández also became an actor and organized musical scores in Mexico&#x27;s &quot;golden age&quot; of movies. His wife (and eventual widow) is Mexican.

===&quot;Lamento borincano&quot; and &quot;Preciosa&quot;===
In 1937, Hernández wrote &quot;Lamento Borincano.” That same year, he also wrote &quot;Preciosa.” In 1947, Hernández returned to Puerto Rico and became the director of the orchestra at the government-owned WIPR Radio.

Hernandez also composed Christmas music, Danzas, Zarzuelas, Guarachas, Lullabies, Boleros, Waltzes, and more.

Hernández&#x27;s works include &quot;Ahora seremos felices&quot; (Now, We Will Be Happy), &quot;Campanitas de cristal&quot; (Crystal Bells), &quot;Capullito de Alhelí,” &quot;Culpable&quot; (Guilty), &quot;El Cumbanchero&quot; (also known as &quot;Rockfort Rock&quot; or &quot;&quot;Comanchero&quot; (sic)&quot; to reggae aficionados), &quot;Ese soy yo&quot; (That&#x27;s Me), &quot;Perfume de Gardenias&quot; (Gardenia&#x27;s Perfume), &quot;Silencio&quot; (Silence), and &quot;Tú no comprendes&quot; (You Don&#x27;t Understand), among 3,000 others. Many of his compositions were strongly based on Cuban musical idioms, such as the guaracha&#x27;s &quot;Cachita&quot; and &quot;Buchipluma na&#x27; ma,” which were often mistaken as songs by Cuban authors. His music became an important part of Puerto Rican culture.

===Later years and death===
Hernández was Honorary President of the Authors and Composers Association. He was also the founder of little league baseball in Puerto Rico. President John F. Kennedy christened him &quot;Mr. Cumbanchero&quot;.

Hernández died in San Juan on December 11, 1965, shortly after Banco Popular de Puerto Rico produced a TV special in his honor in which he addressed the people for the last time. The special was simulcast on all TV and most island radio stations. The TV special was rebroadcast on May 13, 2007. Rafael Hernández&#x27;s remains are buried in the Santa María Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery of Old San Juan.

==Legacy==
Puerto Rico has honored his memory by naming public buildings, avenues, and schools after him. The airport in Aguadilla is named Rafael Hernández Airport. There are schools in New York City, Boston, and in Newark, New Jersey named after Rafael Hernández. Renowned Puerto Rican sculptor Tomás Batista created a statue of Hernández, which is in the municipality of Bayamón, Puerto Rico. The Interamerican University of Puerto Rico, the repository of his works, operates a small museum in his honor at its Metropolitan Campus in San Juan, which is directed by his son, Alejandro (Chalí) Hernández. The Hernandez Houses housing complex in New York City is named after Rafael Hernández.

At the behest former senator Lucy Arce, the Senate of Puerto Rico, under the first term of Thomas Rivera Schatz built the Rafael Hernández Plaza with a bigger-than-lifesize statue of the composer, and a statue of a Puerto Rican jíbaro riding a horse honoring his Lamento Borincano. The park is located at the easternmost tip of San Juan&#x27;s Paseo de la Covadonga.

Puerto Rican singer Marc Anthony recorded Hernández&#x27;s &quot;Preciosa&quot; and sang the song in a 2005 concert in New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. According to an article in the &quot;New York Times&quot;: 

In 1969, Puerto Rican actor Orlando Rodriguez played Hernandez in the bio-pic &quot;El Jibarito Rafael&quot;, which was directed by the Mexican actor Julián Soler.

In 1999, Hernández was posthumously inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame.

On March 23, 2001, Casa Hernandez, the music store which served as Hernandez&#x27;s booking agency and base of operations, was listed in the National Register of Historic Places, reference #01000244, as &quot;Casa Amadeo, antigua Casa Hernandez&quot;.

In 2017, Rafael Hernández was posthumously inducted to the Puerto Rico Veterans Hall of Fame.

<doc id="862545" wikidata="Q536977" url="?curid=862545" title="Grand Cross of the Iron Cross">
<text>The Grand Cross of the Iron Cross () was a decoration intended for victorious generals of the Prussian Army and its allies. It was the second highest class of the Iron Cross, following the Star of the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross, which was awarded only twice. Along with the Iron Cross 1st and 2nd Class, the Grand Cross was founded on 10 March 1813, during the Napoleonic Wars. It was renewed in 1870 for the Franco-Prussian War and again in 1914 for World War I. In 1939, when Adolf Hitler renewed the Iron Cross as a German (rather than strictly Prussian) decoration, he also renewed the Grand Cross.

The Grand Cross of the Iron Cross was twice the size of the Iron Cross and was worn from a ribbon around the neck. The later Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross, instituted in 1939, was also worn from the neck; it was smaller than the Grand Cross but larger than the Iron Cross.

==1813 Grand Cross==

Five men received the 1813 Grand Cross of the Iron Cross for actions during the Napoleonic Wars:

* Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, commander of Prussian forces at the Battle of Waterloo, later also awarded the Star of the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross
* Friedrich Wilhelm von Bülow
* Crown Prince Charles John of Sweden (Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte) - earlier a Marshal under Napoleon, after becoming regent and crown prince of Sweden, he joined the Sixth Coalition against Napoleon.
* Bogislav Friedrich Emanuel von Tauentzien
* Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg

==1870 Grand Cross==

The Iron Cross was renewed on 19 July 1870, for the Franco-Prussian War. Nine men received the 1870 Grand Cross of the Iron Cross for service during that war. Seven Grand Crosses were awarded on 22 March 1871, to:

* Albert, Crown Prince of Saxony
* August Karl von Goeben
* Edwin Freiherr von Manteuffel
* Helmuth Graf von Moltke the Elder
* Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia
* Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia (later Kaiser Friedrich III)
* August Graf von Werder

Kaiser Wilhelm I received the Grand Cross on 16 June 1871, and Friedrich Franz II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, received it on 4 December 1871. The Kaiser was supreme commander of the Prussian Army, and Moltke was Chief of the General Staff. The others were senior combat commanders of the Prussian Army (Crown Prince Albert initially commanded the Saxon Army as a corps under a Prussian field army, but later took command of a combined Prussian/Saxon field army).

==1914 Grand Cross==
The Iron Cross was renewed again on 5 August 1914. There were five recipients of the 1914 Grand Cross in the First World War:
* Kaiser Wilhelm II
* Paul von Hindenburg, later also awarded the Star of the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross
* Erich Ludendorff
* Prince Leopold of Bavaria
* August von Mackensen

==1939 Grand Cross==
Adolf Hitler reinstituted the Iron Cross as a German decoration in September 1939, with the Grand Cross again the highest grade (above the various classes of the Knight&#x27;s Cross).

&quot;Reichsmarschall&quot; Hermann Göring became the only recipient of the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross during World War II when it was awarded to him at the Field Marshal Ceremony on 19 July 1940 in his role as the Supreme Commander of the Luftwaffe for leading them to victory in the French campaign.

A World War II version of the higher Star of the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross was devised, but never formally instituted or awarded. Following the Allied victory in May 1945, the United States Army seized the only known prototype, which is now a part of the collection of the Museum of the United States Military Academy (USMA) in West Point, New York.

<text>Lokesh Chandra (born 11 April 1927 in Ambala, India) is a prominent scholar of the Vedic period, Buddhism and the Indian arts. Between 1942 and 2004, he published 576 books and 286 articles.

He has also held many official positions in the Indian government and was twice a member of Indian Parliament (during the period 1974-1980 and in 1980-1986).

== Biography ==
Lokesh Chandra was born on 11 April 1927 in Ambala, India. He is the son of the famous Sanskrit scholar, linguist and politician Raghu Vira. After obtaining a master&#x27;s degree at the University of the Punjab in Lahore in 1947, he edited the Gavamayana portion of the Vedic work Jaiminiya Brahmana with the help of newly discovered manuscripts. Chandra went to the Netherlands to study Old Javanese with the Indologist Jan Gonda at Utrecht University, where he obtained a Ph.D. with the dissertation &quot;Jaiminiya Brahmana of the Samaveda II.1-80&quot; in March 1950. Among them are classics like his &quot;Tibetan-Sanskrit Dictionary&quot;, &quot;Materials for a History of Tibetan Literature&quot;, &quot;Buddhist Iconography of Tibet&quot;, and his &quot;Dictionary of Buddhist Art&quot; in 15 volumes.

He is not only an eminent scholar, but has also held many official positions in the Indian government as a member of several committees: Education, Official Language, but also Tourism, Heavy Industry and many others, as his expertise was not limited to Buddhism and Indian Art, his favourite fields. He was also a member of the Indian Parliament twice (1974-1980) and (1980-1986).

In 2006 he was conferred with Padma Bhushan by the Indian Government.

<doc id="862565" wikidata="Q3361787" url="?curid=862565" title="Pamela Wallin">
<text>Pamela Wallin (born April 10, 1953) is a Canadian senator, former television journalist, and diplomat. She was appointed to the senate on January 2, 2009, where she initially sat as a Conservative.

==Early life and career==
Wallin was born in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, and is of Swedish descent. Wallin spent much of her formative years in Wadena but completed her high school in Moose Jaw. In 1973, she graduated with a degree in psychology and political science from the University of Saskatchewan, Regina Campus (now the University of Regina) and began her career as an officer at the Saskatchewan Federal Penitentiary. Politically, she was a member of &quot;The Waffle&quot;, a left-wing faction in the New Democratic Party that existed in the early to mid-1970s.

==Journalism==
In 1974, she began her career in journalism, joining CBC Radio&#x27;s news division. In 1978, she joined the Ottawa bureau of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; where she remained for two years. In 1980 she joined CTV and became cohost, with Norm Perry, of &quot;Canada AM&quot;. In 1985, CTV named her its Ottawa bureau chief. She later rejoined &quot;Canada AM&quot;, hosting alongside J. D. Roberts.

In 1992, CBC Television hired Wallin in a highly publicized move. For many years, &quot;The National&quot; had been followed by a 40-minute nightly newsmagazine hosted by Barbara Frum, called &quot;The Journal&quot;. However, as a result of Frum&#x27;s death in March 1992, the CBC wanted to revamp and reposition its entire approach to news programming.

In the fall of that year, Wallin and Peter Mansbridge debuted as the co-hosts of &quot;Prime Time News&quot;. Instead of Mansbridge reading the news on &quot;The National&quot;, followed by Frum introducing documentary and current affairs features and interviewing newsmakers on &quot;The Journal&quot;, the new show integrated the two former programs and featured Wallin and Mansbridge as equal co-hosts of the entire package. As well, the new show aired at 9 p.m., one hour earlier than the old &quot;National&quot;/&quot;Journal&quot; tandem.

The show fared poorly in the ratings and by 1994 had returned to its old format and time slot, with Mansbridge reading the news, followed by Wallin hosting a magazine segment which eventually took on the name &quot;The National Magazine&quot;. In April 1995, Wallin was dropped as host of &quot;The Magazine&quot;, and was succeeded in June by Hana Gartner.

Following her dismissal from CBC News, Wallin briefly returned to CTV as part of its coverage of the 1995 provincial election in Ontario, but did not rejoin the company permanently. Instead, she created her own production company, Pamela Wallin Productions, and launched a daily interview series called &quot;Pamela Wallin Live&quot; in 1995. Airing on CBC Newsworld and, in some years, on the CBC&#x27;s main network as well, &quot;Pamela Wallin Live&quot; was a highly successful series which featured Wallin interviewing newsmakers, celebrities and other interesting personalities in a manner similar to CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot;. The show ran for four years before Wallin moved to the cable network TalkTV.

In 2000, Wallin hosted the Canadian edition of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;.

Wallin has also published two books, &quot;Since You Asked&quot; () and &quot;Speaking of Success&quot; (), and has made cameo appearances on the Canadian comedy series &quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot; and &quot;Corner Gas&quot;.

==Diplomatic and academic appointments==
In 2001, Wallin, along with Foreign Affairs Minister John Manley, was one of the organizers of the &quot;Canada Loves New York&quot; rally for Canadians to show their support after the September 11 attacks (Manley ran in the New York City Marathon in 2001, a contributing factor in the organization of the rally).

On June 25, 2002, Wallin&#x27;s television career came to an end when Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien advised Governor General Adrienne Clarkson to appoint Wallin to a four-year term as Canada&#x27;s consul general in New York City, her first diplomatic posting. In 2003, Wallin and Senator Jerry Grafstein were honoured by the Canadian Society of New York for their ongoing commitment to strengthening the ties between Canada and the United States. In 2006, she became a senior advisor to the president of the Americas Society and the Council of the Americas in New York.

One of the perquisites of the post of Consul General was an official residence on Park Avenue.
In 2005, shortly before her term ended, Wallin bought a apartment for US$379,000.

In March 2007, she was appointed the seventh chancellor of the University of Guelph and was installed in June. She sat on the Panel on Canada&#x27;s Future Role in Afghanistan, chaired by Manley, a former cabinet minister.

She was also appointed by the governor general as an honorary colonel of the Royal Canadian Air Force.

==Corporate boards==
In 2006, Wallin was appointed to the board of Bell Globemedia, owners of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; and CTV Inc. From 2007 to 2011 she served on the board of Oilsands Quest, Inc. and has also served on the board of Gluskin Sheff &amp; Associates, Inc., an investment and wealth management firm and as a member of the advisory board of BMO Harris Bank. In 2013, as a result of the Senate expense claims scandal she was embroiled in, Wallin resigned from all three paid positions she held outside of the Senate: as a director of Gluskin Sheff &amp; Associates, a wealth management firm, in May 2013, the board of Porter Airlines in June 2013 after having been on the board since 2008, and the board of the Ideas Council.

==Canadian Senate==
On January 2, 2009, Wallin was appointed to the Senate of Canada on the advice of Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Following her expulsion from the Conservative Senate Caucus in 2013, Wallin identified as an Independent from 2013 to 2016. From 2016 until 2019, Wallin has caucused with the Independent Senators Group. On November 4, 2019, Senator Wallin joined the Canadian Senators Group.

===Residency and travel expense controversy===
Wallin decided to leave the Conservative caucus on May 17, 2013, until an audit into her expense claims could be completed. On November 5, 2013, the Senate voted to suspend Wallin without pay for the duration of the 41st Canadian Parliament for alleged theft from the public purse. The suspension ended with dissolution of parliament for the 2015 federal election. In 2016 the Royal Canadian Mounted Police announced that criminal charges would not be laid against Wallin over her expenses. She subsequently returned to the Senate in 2015.

==Personal life==
Wallin is divorced. She was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2001.

==Honours==

In 1994, her home town of Wadena, Saskatchewan named its major street &quot;Pamela Wallin Drive&quot; in her honour. In 1999, she was inducted into the Saskatchewan Order of Merit, and in 2007 was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 2008, Toastmasters International announced that Wallin would be that year&#x27;s winner of their &quot;Golden Gavel&quot; award.

Wallin has received 13 honorary degrees, including from Athabasca University, the University of Lethbridge and the University of Windsor.

<text>Anderson Valley is a sparsely populated region in western Mendocino County in Northern California. Located approximately north of San Francisco, the name &quot;Anderson Valley&quot; applies broadly to several rural, unincorporated communities in or near the alluvial terraces along Anderson Creek and other tributaries to the Navarro River.

It is named after William Anderson, an early European settler to the area.

== Geography ==
The name &quot;Anderson Valley&quot; applies to a region stretching from Boonville (located on Anderson Creek) and Philo (located on Indian Creek) to Navarro (located on Soda Creek). Rancheria, Anderson, Indian and Soda creeks are tributaries to the Navarro River, which flows north and west through the coastal range to the Pacific Ocean; Dry Creek flows south into the Russian River watershed in Sonoma County. The main stem of the Navarro River begins less than a mile south of Philo at the confluence of Anderson Creek and Rancheria Creek. The mouth of the Navarro is south of Mendocino, California. Encompassing , the Navarro River watershed is the largest coastal basin in Mendocino County. The area is not seismically active, though a minor fault runs along the Valley floor.

The climate is tempered by cool marine air. Steep hills and mountains surround rolling to nearly level alluvial terraces. The dominant natural vegetation is a mixed forest of Coast Redwood, various native oak varieties, and Douglas fir. Elevation ranges from sea level to . The average annual precipitation ranges . The average annual temperature is about , and the average frost-free season ranges from 220 to 365 days. Towards the coast the summers are cool and moist with frequent fog, while the interior Anderson Valley proper features a warm to hot summer climate similar to nearby interior regions, with daytime highs occasionally in excess of .

== History ==
Early Native inhabitants of Anderson Valley were speakers of two of the seven Pomoan languages. The Late Pomo of what is now the Yorkville area spoke the Central Pomo language. The Tabahtea (Tah-bah-tay) Pomo of the Boonville area west to Navarro spoke the Northern Pomo language. These residents occupied nineteen known village sites, with an estimated population of 600 in 1855.

The early European American settlers of Anderson Valley arrived after 1850. They practiced subsistence farming and expanded into resource extraction economies based on timber harvesting and livestock ranching. Some of the first European American settlers included Henry Beeson (who took part in the Bear Flag Revolt), his brother Isaac Beeson and William Anderson, their stepbrother, for whom the valley was named. The first wave of European American settlers included the Ornbaun, Hutsell, Barnett, Clow, Gschwend, McAbee, Rector, Horse, Burgess, Rawles, McGimsey, Witherell, Irish, Holgooden, Hiatt, Ball, Prather, Smelley, McSpadden, Wallace, Conrad, O&#x27;Barr, Bowen, Nunn, Vines, Buster, Farrer, Counts, Shields, Lawson, Williams, Donelly, Plaskett, Leonard, Hawkins, Stephens, Robinson, Tift, Perkins, Elliott, Ponad, Gasklii, Brayton, and Connard families.

John Gschwend established the first water powered lumber mill along the Navarro River in 1857, and Thomas Hiatt built the first steam powered lumber mill in 1877 near present-day Boonville. In 1880 a human population of around 1,000 maintained 75,000 head of sheep and 20,000 head of cattle. Commercial production of apples and hops began before the turn of the century, along with the development of Boontling, the local folk language. The 1940s and 1950s were boom years, when industrial automation and modern highway transportation enabled rapid liquidation logging of the remaining redwood forests. Many commercial lumber mills were established to work the brief timber boom.

By the 1960s the sheep, timber and apple sectors of the economy were in decline. Large tracts of land were removed from production and subdivided. The first commercial vineyards for wine grapes were planted. Marijuana production flourished with the influx of many new residents from the urban counterculture in the 1970s. By the 1980s the timber industry was reduced to two small specialty mills (lath and decorative fencing), the sheep industry to four working ranches of modest size, and the apple industry to a small fraction of its former planted area. In 1989 Sean Donovan of Boonville established KZYX, a community-based non-commercial, National Public Radio affiliated station.

=== Wine industry ===
A wine boom began in the 1980s, leading to the eventual establishment of the Anderson Valley AVA, specializing in Alsatian varietals, pinot noir and sparkling wine. The wine industry is currently the dominant contributor to the Anderson Valley economy, and major producers include Lazy Creek Vineyards and Roederer Estate. The major annual wine events are the Pinot Noir Festival held on the third weekend in May and the International Alsace Varietals Festival in late February. In addition to wine, there is a successful microbrewery, the Anderson Valley Brewing Company, on the outskirts of Boonville. Like much of Mendocino County, the hospitality industry is a natural adjunct to boutique alcohol production. Fine restaurants and quality lodging are in good supply. The pleasant natural environment and rural lifestyle attracts artists, writers, musicians and a variety of skilled crafts people. As in similar pastoral regions dependent upon a low-paid work force in the farm, hospitality and service sectors, degraded tenant housing is available for local employees, while upscale real estate inventory is generally priced beyond the typical household budget of resident unskilled laborers.

<doc id="862592" wikidata="Q1935894" url="?curid=862592" title="Quidam">
<text>Quidam ( ) was the ninth stage show produced by Cirque du Soleil. It premiered in April 1996 and has been watched by millions of spectators around the world. &quot;Quidam&quot; originated as a big-top show in Montreal and was converted into an arena format beginning with its 2010 tour in North America. It then changed back to the Big Top for a 3-month run in Seoul, South Korea before returning to an arena show for its tour to Oceania. The show performed for the final time in Christchurch, New Zealand on February 26, 2016.

The entire show is imagined by a bored girl named Zoé who is alienated and ignored by her parents. She dreams up the whimsical world of &quot;Quidam&quot; as a means of escaping the monotony of her life.

The show&#x27;s title refers to the feature character, a man without a head, carrying an umbrella and a bowler hat. Quidam is said to be the embodiment of both everyone and no one at the same time. According to Cirque du Soleil literature &quot;Quidam: a nameless passer-by, a solitary figure lingering on a street corner, a person rushing past... One who cries out, sings and dreams within us all.&quot;

==Set and technical information==
The minimalistic stage was designed by Michel Crête to represent a monolithic structure such as an airport or train station where people are always coming and going. The major set element includes the five, all-aluminum, 120-foot (36.57-meter) arches above the stage, known as the téléphérique. These allow performers to be transported onto and off the stage from above. Each rail of the téléphérique has two trolleys: one to raise and lower the performer or equipment, and the second to transport it onto or off the stage.

The stage floor is made of aluminum decks with a perforated, rubber-type mat. The perforations, of which there are over 200,000, allow light to pass through from below the stage, creating visual effects.

The original Quidam stage was redesigned and incorporated into the Bazzar (Cirque du Soleil) grand chapiteau tour. The show premiered in November 2018.

==Cast==
The cast of &quot;Quidam&quot; has a cast of 45 acrobats, musicians, singers, and characters, some of which are detailed below.
* Zoé: She is the principal character and singer in &quot;Quidam&quot;. Although average in nature, she longs for excitement.
* Father: Completely, though unwittingly, self-absorbed, this character is lost behind his newspaper until he eventually open his eyes to find himself among his family and loved ones. His white shoes are the only indication of a hidden personality.
* Mother: Conveys an air of absence and alienation whilst inside her lie fear, frustration, and desire. Through the show, she rediscovers the intense feeling of being alive through pain and courage, play and love.
* Quidam: The show&#x27;s titular character, who is anonymous, everyone, and no one (the name means &quot;passer by&quot;). He may have stepped out of a surrealist painting or been conjured up out of Zoé&#x27;s imagination. He is known for his bowler hat and umbrella despite being headless.
* John/Mark: He is an eerie yet charming guide on our mysterious journey through the world of &quot;Quidam&quot;. Also is represented as a father figure to Zoé hence him stepping into her father&#x27;s shoes. The character changed of &#x27;John&#x27; was played initially by John Gilkey and then by Mark Ward who performed the role from 1999 onwards. Sometime after this transition, the character&#x27;s name changed to &#x27;Mark&#x27;.
* Target: A living human bullseye fired at by everyone but is always smiling.
* Chiennes Blanches: The silent chorus, the nameless and the faceless, the dehumanized, mechanical crowd, simultaneously leading and following. They also accompany the principal characters as they make their entrances and exits.
* Les Égarés: Lost individuals who gather together in the streets and abandoned buildings of &quot;Quidam&quot;. Many of them perform in the banquine act.
** Boum-Boum: A pale skinned, bald character who wears boxing gloves. Enjoys screaming at the audience and walking away proudly, but will run away if an audience member screams back. He is aggressive and physically fit, yet extremely lifeless. It is as though his body lives on only because his soul refuses to leave it.
** Aviator: This character runs around on stage with skeletal wings, but doesn’t look quite ready to take off. Perhaps he doesn’t know he has wings. Perhaps he knows, but can’t fly. Perhaps, like Icarus, he has tried and failed or perhaps he simply wants to escape this world and its problems.
** Homme Rayé: Translating into English as the &#x27;Striped man&#x27; due to his blue and red costume with white stripes. He is one of Les Égarés who has a scarred face.
** Pierrot: Another of Les Égarés who is most noticeable when running across the stage in a long white gown and she has bright red hair.
** Kangaroo: A character representing the youth in society, he wears a blue, sleeveless hood and is one of Les Égarés.
** Blue Lady: A pale skin lady, always spinning on herself.
** La Garçonne: One of Les Égarés, she is dressed in red and love skipping all the time.
** Skipping Girl: One of Les Égarés, she is dressed in blue and love skipping all the time.
** Ballerina: A strange character, he is dress with a tutu.
** The Explorer
** Rescapé
** Romantic
** Jujube
** Oublié
** La Mouche: An upbeat character that makes up Les Égarés, she is dressed entirely in light blue and green.
** Funny Bunny/Peau D&#x27;ane: A character who chases and gets chased by other characters. A genius in ecology, lovey-dovey, and astrology. She is one of Les Égarés and is noticeable as a red rabbit on stage.
* Les Macloma: Three Tramp-like characters who serve as parodies of the traditional Whiteface, Auguste and Character clown archetypes. (1996-1997, 1999-2004)
* Les Frères Velasquez: Les Macloma&#x27;s understudies during First European &amp; Second North American Tour. (1999-2003)
* Les Don Quijoles: Les Macloma&#x27;s understudies during the First Japanese Tour. (2003-2004)
* Kotini Jr. &amp; Alosha: A duo of clowns that included Kotini Jr., (Portrayed by Konstantin Andreitchenko-Wübbe), and Alosha, (Portrayed by Alexey Mironov). (1997-1998)
* Toto &amp; Voki: A duo of clowns who performed acts created by David Shiner. (2004-2016)

==Acts==
&quot;Quidam&quot; combines a mix of acrobatic skills and traditional circus acts:

* German Wheel: An acrobat performs tricks within a German wheel, also known as Rhönrad
* Diabolo: Originally performed by four girls and later as a solo act, the performer manipulates up to 3 diabolos (i.e. Chinese yo-yo) at once. A diabolo is a wooden spool balance juggled by two sticks linked with a string.
* Clown Car: Toto attempts to flirt with a female audience member in an invisible car.
* Aerial contortion in silk: Intensity, power and grace combine when a young woman becomes one with the column of red fabric which supports and cradles her. 
* Skipping ropes: Drawing inspiration from dance, acrobatics, and the art of manipulation, a group of 20 acrobats performs this familiar child&#x27;s game in a steady stream of solo, duo, and group jumps and figures.
* Aerial hoops: Three performers use hoops attached to the ceiling to perform tricks.
* Handbalancing: Using strength and balance, a performer contorts into poses while on balancing canes.
* Spanish web: Artists fly over the stage, attached to trolleys on the overhead tracks. In turn or as a group, they occasionally perform a sudden drop, stopped only by the ropes looped around their waists or ankles.
* Statue: Never losing contact, two strong, flexible performers move almost imperceptibly, assuming positions impossible without an impeccable sense of balance. 
* Clown Movie: Voki directs a comedic skit using audience members as actors. A similar version was originally performed in Nouvelle Experience.
* Banquine: An Italian acrobatic tradition going back to the Middle Ages that combines gymnastics and ballet. Showcasing the agility of the human body, up to 15 artists perform sequences of feats and human pyramids with their perfectly synchronized movements.

===Acts in rotation===
* Juggling: Up to five balls fly through the air, with additional manipulation of a briefcase, umbrella, and bowler hat.
* Dance Trapeze: A solo trapeze artist twirls over the stage on a trapeze strung from the telepherique.

===Retired acts===
* Cyr wheel: An acrobat performed tricks within a large metal ring. This act replaced German Wheel between 2012 and 2013.
* Manipulation: Three performers used warped metal sheets to juggle and manipulate a red ball that they each had; later in the act, they got rid of the metal sheet and juggled the red balls as well as many other red balls and a bowler hat each. This act was removed in 1998.
* Solo Aerial straps: A male single artist grasped cords that dangled from the overhead rails; sometimes he performed on the ground, sometimes in the air. This act was in rotation, and was performed in 1997 in replacement of the German Wheel act in very rare circumstances.
* Duo Aerial straps: Two artists grasped cords that dangled from the overhead rails; sometimes they performed on the ground, sometimes in the air. This act was performed during the Asia Pacific tour of 2004 - 2005. 
* Hoops: A performer spun and manipulated up to 20 spinning hoops all over her body. This act was performed in place of Handbalancing in 2002 and 2008.
* Cloud swing: A unique combination of swinging trapeze and Spanish web techniques. This act was dropped from the show in 2012 due to issues with finance, and a single trapeze act temporarily replaced it. The cloud swing act returned to the show from 2012 to 2013 and during the Seoul, South Korea tour in 2015 because the promoter wanted to make the show as close to the original as possible during its final run under the Grand Chapiteau.
* Duplex trapeze: A performer did tricks on a two tiered trapeze. This act was a temporary replacement for the cloud swing act in 2012.
* Macloma: The Macloma interact with the audience.
* Montgolfiere: The Macloma play in hot air balloons.
* Balloon Song: The Macloma play a song with balloons and a broken violin.
* Hose: Alosha performs tricks with a long rubber hose.
* Ribbon: Alosha performs a comical parody of rhythmic gymnastics.
* Dance: Kotini Jr. performs an energetic breakdance with a chair.

===Awards===
&quot;Quidam&quot;&#x27;s diabolo act won a Gold Medal at the 1995 Festival du Cirque de Demain. The show&#x27;s banquine act won the Golden Clown at the 1999 International Monte Carlo Circus Festival.

==Costumes==
&quot;Quidam&quot;&#x27;s costume designer, Dominique Lemieux, drew inspiration from Surrealist art, particularly the works of René Magritte and Paul Delvaux. The costumes convey the alienation of the characters and represent an urban landscape through the use of painted textures and fabrics. The dominant color is grey but is supplemented by deep, rich, warm colors and embellished with metals. &quot;Quidam&quot; was the first Cirque du Soleil show to use everyday clothing for the outfits, although those in the acrobatic acts are modified. The fabric chosen for &quot;Quidam&quot; is primarily stretch linen, but also includes leather, jute, linen crepe, wool, velvet and 42 types of cotton.

&quot;Quidam&quot; has approximately 249 costumes, 500 costume accessories, and 200-300 shoes: Each artist has anywhere from 2 to 7 costumes, of which there are at least 2 spares. The costumes, although washed every day, can last anywhere from 6 months to 2 years.

==Music==
&quot;Quidam&quot;’s music was composed by Benoît Jutras and has been released in three album editions featuring additional songs, alternative new cover designs, and higher quality sounds. The first CD was produced by Carl Marsh. It was co-arranged by Marsh and Jutras and released on January 14, 1997. () The album features the voices of Audrey Brisson-Jutras and Mathieu Lavoie, with the exception of two bonus tracks sung by Brisson-Jutras and Richard Price on the extended CD released in 2001 (recorded live in Amsterdam, 1999).

Below is a list of tracks as featured on the original 1997 release, alongside each of which is listed the act that the track accompanies. The two tracks on the 2001 extended album are also included at the end: &quot;Misère&quot; and &quot;Enfants d&#x27;Acier&quot;.

==Tour==
&quot;Quidam&quot; started as a Grand Chapiteau touring show before being fully converted to an arena touring show in 2010. For a short time in 2009, &quot;Quidam&quot; toured the UK and IE in arena format before switching back to the Grand Chapiteau for its South America tour. After this, in 2010, &quot;Quidam&quot; was converted into the arena format where it began a North American, European and Asia-Pacific tour. However, during its run in Seoul in 2015, Quidam was temporarily reconverted to play under the Grand Chapiteau for three months before continuing its farewell tour in the arena format for its run in Australia and New Zealand. The show&#x27;s 20-year tour visited 241 cities in 42 countries before it ended on February 26, 2016 in Christchurch, New Zealand.

Cirque du Soleil started using a customized tour bus as a method of helping to advertise &quot;Quidam&quot; during its tour in northeastern North America during the fall of 2011. During the show&#x27;s stops in cities, the tour bus makes appearances at local merchants, allowing people to meet part of the crew.

<doc id="862594" wikidata="Q580463" url="?curid=862594" title="The Tale of Peter Rabbit">
<text>The Tale of Peter Rabbit is a children&#x27;s book written and illustrated by Beatrix Potter that follows mischievous and disobedient young Peter Rabbit as he gets into, and is chased around, the garden of Mr. McGregor. He escapes and returns home to his mother, who puts him to bed after offering him chamomile tea. The tale was written for five-year-old Noel Moore, the son of Potter&#x27;s former governess, Annie Carter Moore, in 1893. It was revised and privately printed by Potter in 1901 after several publishers&#x27; rejections, but was printed in a trade edition by Frederick Warne &amp; Co. in 1902. The book was a success, and multiple reprints were issued in the years immediately following its debut. It has been translated into 36 languages, and with 45 million copies sold it is one of the best-selling books in history.

Since its release, the book has generated considerable merchandise for both children and adults, including toys, dishes, foods, clothing, and videos. Potter was one of the first to be responsible for such merchandise when she patented a Peter Rabbit doll in 1903 and followed it almost immediately with a Peter Rabbit board game. Peter Rabbit has remained popular amongst children for more than a century and continues to be adapted into new book editions, television programmes, and films.

Scholars of literature have commented on themes in the book, such as its radical quality, Peter Rabbit&#x27;s rebellious nature, and the story&#x27;s ruthlessness, stating that these offer readers a chance to imagine going to similar extremes.

== Context ==

In 1893, Beatrix Potter heard that the 5-year-old son of a friend, Annie Moore, was convalescing after scarlet fever. Potter decided to entertain the boy, Noel, with an illustrated letter. With her pet rabbit named Peter Piper in mind, she wrote a very short story &quot;about four little rabbits&quot;, and illustrated it in the letter. Further letters about other animals followed, until in 1900, Annie Moore proposed to Potter that the illustrated letters could be made into books.

== Plot ==

The story focuses on Peter, a young rabbit, and his family. Peter&#x27;s mother, Mrs. Rabbit, intends to go shopping for the day and allows Peter and her other three children, Peter&#x27;s sisters: Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail to go playing. She tells them they can go anywhere they like, but not to enter the vegetable garden of an old man named Mr. McGregor, whose wife, Mrs. McGregor, put their father in a pie after he entered and got caught by Mr. McGregor. Peter&#x27;s three younger sisters obediently stay away from Mr. McGregor&#x27;s garden, choosing to go down the lane and gather blackberries, but Peter enters Mr. McGregor&#x27;s garden in the hopes of eating some vegetables.

Peter eats more than is good for him and goes looking for parsley to cure his stomach ache. Peter is seen by Mr. McGregor, who chases Peter. Peter gets caught in a net and three friendly sparrows comfort him. Peter manages to escape Mr. McGregor just in time, but loses his blue jacket and shoes while running off. He hides in a greenhouse, ultimately jumping into a watering can for protection. Unfortunately there is water inside the watering can so Peter gets wet and sneezes, alerting Mr. McGregor. When Mr. McGregor gets tired running after Peter and resumes his work, Peter tries to escape, but is completely lost in the huge garden. Peter tries getting a young mouse to help him, however she is collecting food for her family and cannot help. Peter also notices a cat sitting by a pond. Peter considers asking for directions, but ultimately decides not to, having been warned about cats by his cousin. However, Peter sees that Mr. McGregor is &quot;gone&quot; and it buys him some time to escape to the gate. Peter sees from a distance the gate where he entered the garden and heads for it, despite being noticed and chased by Mr. McGregor again. With difficulty, he wriggles under the gate, and escapes from the garden. His abandoned clothing is used by Mr. McGregor to dress a scarecrow.

After returning home late, a sick Peter is reprimanded by his mother for losing his shoes and his jacket (the second jacket and shoes he has lost in a fortnight). Peter&#x27;s mother puts him to bed early without supper. To cure his stomach-ache, Mrs. Rabbit gives Peter a teaspoon of chamomile tea. Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail, meanwhile, enjoy a delicious dinner of milk, bread and blackberries.

== Characters ==
* Peter: Peter is a naughty rabbit who disobeys his mother. (He is the eldest of the four little rabbits.)
* Flopsy: Flopsy is Peter&#x27;s sister who is a good rabbit. (She is the second youngest of the four siblings.)
* Mopsy: Mopsy is a rabbit and Peter&#x27;s sister who always obeys her mother. (She is the second oldest of the four.)
* Cotton-tail: Cotton-tail is a sweet rabbit and Peter&#x27;s sibling. As her name says, she is soft as cotton. (She is the youngest of the four.)
* Mr. McGregor: Mr. McGregor owns a beautiful garden that is filled with delicious fruits and vegetables. Peter&#x27;s father was put into a pie by Mrs. McGregor.

== Publication history ==
&quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot; was first published in the United Kingdom by Frederick Warne &amp; Co. as a small hardback book in October 1901; Potter created both the text and the illustrations. The first edition had a print run of 250, with monochrome illustrations. The demand was greater and she needed to print 200 more. Warne published the first full-colour edition in 1902. The blocks for the illustrations and text were sent to the printer Edmund Evans for engraving, and Potter adjusted the page proofs. The book was soon on sale in shops in London, including Harrods department store, accompanied by the world&#x27;s first licensed character, a soft toy of Peter Rabbit. By December 1903 the book had sold 50,000 copies. The book&#x27;s success prompted Warne to obtain more stories from Potter, starting in 1903 with both &quot;The Tailor of Gloucester&quot; and &quot;The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin&quot;.

The book has since been reprinted many times, and after 100 years had never gone out of print. Warne did not copyright the book when it was published in the United States; unlicensed editions of the book were produced, the first published by Henry Altemus Company in 1904. The book has been translated into 36 languages. Over 45 million copies have been sold, making it one of the best-selling books in history.

== Reception ==
Scholars have identified a variety of themes in &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot;. Eliza Dresang suggests that the book is &quot;radical&quot; in multiple ways. The first of these is its child-centred size, easy to hold. It is radical, too, in its nonlinear quality, with the images not immediately beside the text they illustrate (and sometimes before that text), and with sentences that often start with the result, and end with the actor, as in &quot;But round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor!&quot; The meaning, too, has more than one layer, not least in the dressed animals, which are at once experienced by the reader as animals and as humans. And the book&#x27;s start, with the death of Peter Rabbit&#x27;s father, is a radical innovation for a book for small children.

Katie Mullins describes Peter&#x27;s rebellious nature, which is seen in the book&#x27;s first dialogue, when Mrs. Rabbit forbids Peter to go into Mr. McGregor&#x27;s garden. Mullins comments that the garden is stated to be dangerous, as it is where Peter&#x27;s father met his death. She cites Maria Nikolajeva and Carole Scott&#x27;s description of Peter as a &quot;naughty boy who values his independence and whose desire to transgress boundaries far outweighs his mother&#x27;s warnings or his personal safety&quot;.

Judith Robertson and colleagues examine the element of ruthlessness in the story. In their view, Peter Rabbit&#x27;s qualities such as ruthlessness and defiance allow Potter to speak of her own self-knowledge; this serves both as an outlet for a woman in the strict Victorian era, and as a place for her young readers to imagine going to similar extremes.

&quot;School Library Journal&quot; included the book at #19 on their Top 100 Picture Books list in 2012.

== Adaptations ==
=== Merchandising ===
Potter asserted her tales would one day be nursery classics, and part of the &quot;longevity of her books comes from strategy&quot;, writes Potter biographer Ruth MacDonald. She was the first to exploit the commercial possibilities of her characters and tales; between 1903 and 1905 these included a Peter Rabbit stuffed toy, an unpublished board game, and nursery wallpaper.

=== Book ===
The scholar Margaret Mackey writes that Warne was still attempting to prevent other publishers from printing &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot; in 1993, despite the failure to protect the copyright 90 years earlier. In her view &quot;the battle has clearly been lost&quot;, as multiple editions and formats exist in North America, and some &quot;even in Britain&quot; where the book was still protected at that time. Some use both Potter&#x27;s words and her illustrations, though sometimes too small to read. Warne itself has issued a large-format book, &quot;The Complete Adventures of Peter Rabbit&quot;, printing several of the original pages &quot;as panels on a larger page&quot;. Mackey comments that this at once loses the subtlety of the original&#x27;s layout and book design. In 1989, Warne further printed &quot;Scenes from The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot; with &quot;five three-dimensional cut-out pictures from the book, tagged with quotations from the story.&quot; Among the seemingly-pirated editions, one by Ottenheimer Publishers in 1993 printed only a selection of the illustrations with the text, with larger but fewer pages. In Mackey&#x27;s view, &quot;this version is simply an example of diminishment and loss&quot;, as the rhythm of the original is dislocated. Other editions dispense with Potter&#x27;s text altogether, using a selection of her illustrations. One such is Warne&#x27;s &quot;Meet Peter Rabbit&quot;, a board book for babies with five pictures inside and one on the front cover, along with Beatrix Potter&#x27;s name. The text &quot;barely mention[s] Mr. McGregor.&quot;

=== Film ===
In 1938, shortly after the success of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, Walt Disney became interested in making an animated film based on &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot;. However, in a letter to a friend, Potter wrote that she refused Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;scheme to film Peter Rabbit&quot;, saying, &quot;I am not very hopeful about the result. They propose to use cartoons; it seems that a succession of figures can be joggled together to give an impression of motion. I don&#x27;t think the pictures would be satisfactory... I am not troubling myself about it!&quot;

In 1935, the story was loosely adapted in the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; short film, &quot;Country Boy&quot;. It shows some modifications in relation to Beatrix Potter&#x27;s original story, most notably the Rabbit family surname is changed to &quot;Cottontail&quot; and Peter having two brothers and a sister rather than three sisters. In 1971, Peter Rabbit appeared as a character in the ballet film &quot;The Tales of Beatrix Potter&quot;. In late 1991, HBO aired an animated musical adaptation of &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot;, narrated by Carol Burnett, as part of the network&#x27;s &quot;Storybook Musicals&quot; series, which was later released to VHS by Family Home Entertainment under HBO licence. In 1992, the tale was adapted to animation again for the BBC anthology series, &quot;The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends&quot;, along with &quot;The Tale of Benjamin Bunny&quot;. In 2006, Peter Rabbit was heavily referenced in a biopic about Beatrix Potter entitled &quot;Miss Potter&quot;. In December 2012, a new animated children&#x27;s TV series titled &quot;Peter Rabbit&quot; premiered on Nickelodeon, with a full series run beginning in February 2013.

In February 2018, a live-action/animated feature film titled &quot;Peter Rabbit&quot;, directed by Will Gluck, was released. Voice roles were played by James Corden, Daisy Ridley, Margot Robbie, and Elizabeth Debicki, and live action roles played by Domhnall Gleeson, Rose Byrne, and Sam Neill. A sequel was released in 2021.

<doc id="862605" wikidata="Q85209" url="?curid=862605" title="Maximilian Berlitz">
<text>Maximilian Delphinius Berlitz (or Maximilien Berlitz, born David Berlizheimer; April 14, 1852 – April 6, 1921) was a linguist and the founder of the Berlitz Language Schools, the first of which he established in 1878 in Providence, Rhode Island.

==Life and career==
Born David Berlizheimer to Jewish parents in Mühringen, Kingdom of Württemberg, he and his sister were soon orphaned, and he grew up in a family of educators in the Black Forest. Berlitz was required by law to serve as an apprentice; he chose to work for a watchmaker for three years. He later relocated to France and then to Providence, Rhode Island, United States in 1872. His first employment was as a teacher of French and German at Warner Polytechnic College, of which he assumed control in 1878 when the owner of the school, Mr. Warner, disappeared with all the prepaid tuition money. 

When Berlitz became ill, and was unable to teach a French class, he quickly hired Nicholas Joly to replace him and teach the class. Since he had always corresponded with Joly in French, he did not realize that Joly did not speak any English until after he had hired him. Joly taught the class entirely in French (with no translation) by using gestures, pointing to objects and using tone of voice and facial expressions to convey meaning. Berlitz returned to the class six weeks later to find that his students, who had spoken little to no French before Joly began teaching, were conversing semi-fluently in French. Their pronunciation and grammar were also very good. 

Berlitz used this experience to develop the Berlitz Method, for which only the language to be taught is spoken from the first day of class. Students rely on the same techniques Joly used, rather than translation, to gather meaning and learn grammar and vocabulary.

After success, Berlitz opened a second language school in Boston in 1880, supplemented by others in New York and Washington, D.C. He went on to establish schools all over the U.S. and in many countries abroad. Between 1880 and 1900 he also began writing about his ideas, developing them into a systematic method, which he then presented in 1900 at the World&#x27;s Fair in Paris. As the twentieth century opened, he began travelling extensively, making headlines by teaching German Emperor Kaiser Wilhelm II to speak English. Berlitz&#x27;s fame continued to spread as he received medals of honor from the King of Spain, the government of France, and from many international expositions. He remained active until his death, aged 68, in New York City. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Bronx, New York.

Mr. Berlitz&#x27;s method of language learning is still used. Many books that were originally published during the early- to mid-1900s are still in print. There are also many schools that are still dedicated to continuing Berlitz&#x27;s concepts regarding language learning.

The linguist and author Charles Berlitz, his grandson, was for a time the CEO of Berlitz International.

<doc id="862615" wikidata="Q2816453" url="?curid=862615" title="39 Melakhot">
<text>The 39 &quot;Melakhot&quot; (, &quot;lamed-tet avot melakhah&quot;, &quot;39 categories of work&quot;) are thirty-nine categories of activity which Jewish law identifies as prohibited by biblical law on Shabbat. These activities are also prohibited on the Jewish holidays listed in the Torah (&quot;Yom Tov&quot;), but there are significant exceptions that permit carrying and preparing food under specific circumstances on holidays (except Yom Kippur).

In addition to the 39 melakhot, certain other activities are forbidden on Shabbat due to rabbinic law.

It is of note that the (strict) observance of Shabbat is often seen as a benchmark for orthodoxy and indeed has legal bearing on the way a Jew is seen by an Orthodox religious court regarding their affiliation to Judaism.

==The commandment==
The commandment to keep Shabbat as a day of rest is repeated many times in the Hebrew Bible. Its importance is also stressed in Exodus 31:12–17:
==Meaning of &quot;work&quot;==
Though &quot;melakha&quot; is usually translated as &quot;work&quot; in English, the term does not correspond to the ordinary definition of the term, as explained below.
The traditional analysis and explanation of the term, as well as the logic for identifying the activities prohibited to be done on the Sabbath, is recorded in tractate &quot;Shabbat&quot; (70a; 49b). 

The rabbis there noted the symmetry between Genesis 2:1–3 and Exodus 31:1–11 and derive the rule on this basis based on the Thirteen Rules of Rabbi Ishmael. The same term &quot;melakha&quot; [&quot;work&quot;] is used in both places:

* uses the term &quot;melakha&quot; in reference to the Creation:
* provides detailed instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle, again using the term &quot;melakha&quot;. The word is usually translated as &quot;workmanship&quot;, which has a strong element of &quot;creation&quot; or &quot;creativity&quot;. This section immediately precedes the section concerning Sabbath rest quoted above. 

From the common wording (in the Hebrew original), and the juxtaposition of subject matter, the rabbis of the Mishnah derive a basis, as well as a listing, as to which activities are prohibited on the Sabbath. 
In the first passage, there is a &quot;ceasing from&quot; &quot;creation&quot; or &quot;creating&quot;, thus &quot;melakha&quot; in the latter paragraph is also taken to refer to creative, and mindful, activity. As regards the listing: similarly, the activities required for the construction of the Tabernacle and preparing the showbread form the thirty-nine categories of activity listed below.

==Definition==
All the categories of work prohibited on the Sabbath are derived from activities which were required in the setting up, and maintenance of, the Tabernacle known as the &quot;Mishkan&quot;. The first group of eleven activities are involved in the making of the showbreads that were always present in the Mishkan. Or, according to another opinion, the exact same eleven activities were required for the procurement and manufacture of dyes required for the making of the tapestries that were used as part of the roofing of the Tabernacle. The next grouping was for the manufacture of the tapestries, starting with the manufacture of wool right from the shearing process. The next group were for the manufacture of the leather hides also used in the Tabernacle&#x27;s covering starting right from the trapping of animals. The last group of activities are grouped together for things that were required in the construction, disassembly and running of the Tabernacle itself.

The thirty-nine &quot;melakhot&quot; are not so much activities as &quot;categories&quot; of activity. For example, &quot;threshing&quot; usually refers exclusively to the loosening of the edible part of grain attached to its chaff. From this heading the Talmudic legal discussion applies this to any separation of intermixed materials where a desirable inner portion is extracted from an undesirable exterior element. So, &quot;threshing&quot; was the heading of the topic that was used to describe this process as it was familiar to all in Talmudic times.

Many rabbinical scholars have, as above, pointed out that these regulations of labor have something in common – they prohibit any activity that is externally creative, or that exercises control or dominion over one&#x27;s environment.

The extension of the definition is consistent with the common etymology -&quot;melakha&quot; for &quot;work&quot; and &quot;malach&quot; for messenger / agent or &quot;angel&quot;: just as the &quot;malach&quot; is the agent used to bring about the realization and execution of a certain idea, so does &quot;melakha&quot; take a thought or idea and carry through to turn it into a reality.

The definitions presented in this article are only &#x27;headings&#x27; for in-depth topics and without study of the relevant laws it would be very difficult, perhaps impossible, to properly keep the Sabbath according to Halacha/Jewish Law.

==The thirty-nine creative activities==
The 39 melakhot are discussed in the Talmud in tractate Shabbat. As listed in the Mishna (Shabbat 7:2), they are as follows:

Transferring between domains (see below) and preparing food are permitted on Jewish holidays. These are the only exceptions to the rule that activities prohibited on the Sabbath are likewise prohibited on holidays.

&quot;Note:&quot; The thirty-nine prohibited activities are bolded.

===The Order of Bread===

====Ploughing====
Hebrew: (Ḥoresh)

Definition: Promotion of substrate in readiness for plant growth.

Included in this prohibition is any preparation or improvement of any material for agricultural use, be it soil, water for hydroponics, etc.. This activity is standalone; irrespective of whether seeding takes place in the substrate subsequently. 

This includes dragging chair legs in soft soil thereby unintentionally making furrows, or pouring water on arable land that is not saturated. Making a hole in the soil would also provide protection for a seed placed there from rain and runoff; even if no seed is ever placed there, the soil is now enhanced for the process of planting.

The Mishna (Shabbat 7:2) lists ploughing after planting, although one must plow a field before planting. The Gemara asks why this order occurs and answers that the author of this Mishna was a Tanna living in the Land of Israel, where the ground is hard. Since the ground is so hard in Israel, it needed to be ploughed both before planting and after planting. The Mishna lists ploughing second, teaching that the second ploughing (after planting) is [also] prohibited. (The ploughing before the planting is also prohibited, if not biblically, certainly rabbinically). The Rambam lists ploughing first and planting second.

See further: Mishneh Torah &quot;Shabbat&quot; 7:3, 8:1, 21:2–4; Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbat&quot; 10

====Planting====
Hebrew: (Zore&#x27;a)

Definition: Promotion of plant growth.

Not only planting is included in this category; other activities that promote plant growth are also prohibited. This includes watering, fertilizing, planting seeds, or planting grown plants.

See further: Mishneh Torah &quot;Shabbat&quot; 8:2, 21:5; Shulḥan Arukh Oraḥ Ḥayim 336; Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbat&quot; 11

====Reaping====
Hebrew: (Kotzer)

Definition: Severing a plant from its source of growth.

Removing all or part of a plant from its source of growth is reaping. Climbing a tree is rabbinically forbidden, for fear this may lead to one tearing off a branch. Riding an animal is also rabbinically forbidden, as one may unthinkingly detach a stick with which to hit the animal.

See further: Mishneh Torah &quot;Shabbat&quot; 8:3–5, 21:6–10; Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbat&quot; 12

====Gathering====
Hebrew: (Me&#x27;amer)

Definition: Initial gathering of earth-borne/organic material in its original place.

E.g. After picking strawberries, forming a pile or collecting them into one&#x27;s pockets, or a basket. Collecting rock salt or any mineral (from a mine or from the Earth) and making a pile of the produce. This can only occur in the place where the gathering should take place. So, a bowl of apples that falls in a house can be gathered as 1) they do not grow in that environment and 2) they were already initially gathered in the orchard.

However, &quot;subsequent&quot; gathering, which improves the object(s) affected &quot;is&quot; included in this law. For example, stringing diamonds together to form a necklace is a significant improvement of their gathered status. This may well extend to pearls as well.

See further: Mishneh Torah &quot;Shabbat&quot; 8:5, 21:11; Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbat&quot; 13

====Threshing/extraction====
Hebrew: (Dosh)

Definition: Extraction of a desirable inner from an undesirable outer.

This is derived from the cracking of the husks that encase the kernels of wheat. These undesirable husks have to be cracked open in order to extract the desirable inner kernels in order to process them further.

This is a large topic of study. It refers to any productive extraction and includes juicing fruits and vegetables and wringing (desirable fluids) out of cloths, as the juice or water inside the fruit is considered &#x27;desirable&#x27; for these purposes, while the pulp of the fruit would be the &#x27;undesirable.&#x27; 

As such, squeezing (&quot;S&#x27;ḥita&quot;) to extract a desirable inner is generally forbidden unless certain rules are applicable dependant upon the case. The wringing of undesirable water out of cloths may &quot;also&quot; come under scouring/laundering. This activity should be viewed more accurately as &quot;extraction&quot;, while sorting (see below) is more akin to &quot;purification&quot;.

See further: Mishneh Torah &quot;Shabbat&quot; 8:7–10, 21:12–16; Shulḥan Arukh Oraḥ Ḥayim 319–321; Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbat&quot; 14

====Winnowing====
Hebrew: (Zoreh)

Definition: Sorting undesirable from desirable via the force of air (Babylonian Talmud), or dispersal via the force of air like an aerosol can for example (Jerusalem Talmud).

In the Babylonian Talmud this refers exclusively to an act of separation, for example, chaff from grain – i.e. to any separation of intermixed materials. Example: If one has a handful of peanuts, in their paper-thin brown skins, and one blows on the mixture of peanuts and skins, dispersing the unwanted skins from the peanuts, this would be an act of winnowing according to both the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmud.

The Jerusalem Talmud has a more inclusive and general definition of &quot;Zoreh&quot;. By this definition, use of the Venturi tube spray system and spray painting, would come under this prohibition, while butane or propane propelled sprays (common in deodorants and air fresheners, etc.) are permissible to operate as the dispersal force generated is not from air, rather from the propellant within the can. According to the Babylonian Talmud&#x27;s definition, neither of the above spraying methods is involved in sorting undesirable from desirable and therefore not part of this heading.

Rabbi Moses Isserles (the Rema) holds that, unusually, the Jerusalem Talmud&#x27;s definition should &quot;also&quot; be taken into account. As there&#x27;s no argument between the Rema and the Beit Yosef on this point, Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews do not disagree with the Rema&#x27;s extended inclusion of the Jerusalem Talmud&#x27;s definition in this case.

See further: Shulḥan Arukh Oraḥ Ḥayim 219:7; Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbat&quot; 15.

====Sorting/purification====
Hebrew: (Borer)

Definition: Removal of undesirable from desirable from a mixture of types.

In the Talmudic sense usually refers exclusively to the separation of debris from grain – i.e. to any separation of intermixed materials which renders edible that which was inedible. Thus, picking small bones from fish in order to eat the meat would be borer. This prohibition has led to the popularity of gefilte fish as a culinary dish on the Sabbath, since it is deboned prior to being cooked or sold.

Sorting/purification differs from threshing/extraction as here there is a mixture of types, and sorting a mixture via the removal of undesirable elements leaves a purified, refined component. In contrast, threshing/extraction does not entail sorting or purification, just extraction of the inner from the unwanted housing or outer component, such as squeezing a grape for its juice. The juice and the pulp have not undergone sorting, the juice has been extracted from the pulp.

For example, suppose that one has a bowl of mixed raisins and peanuts, and desires to eat only the raisins. Removing (effectively sorting) the peanuts from the bowl, leaving a &#x27;purified&#x27; pile of raisins free from unwanted peanuts, would be sorting/purification as the peanuts are removed. However, removing the &quot;desirable&quot; raisins from the peanuts does not purify the mixture, as one is left with undesirable peanuts (hence unrefined) not a refined component as before, and is thus permissible. Note that in this case there has not been any extraction of material from either the peanuts or raisins (threshing/extraction), just the sorting of undesirable from desirable (sorting/purification).

General Introduction:
:After threshing, a mixed collection of waste matter remained on the threshing floor together with the grain kernels. Included in this combination would be small pebbles and similar debris.
:These pebbles could not be separated by winnowing because they were too heavy to be carried by the wind. The pebbles and debris were therefore sorted and removed by hand. This process is sorting/purification.

:Any form of selecting from (or sorting of) an assorted mixture or combination can be borer. This includes removing undesired objects, or matter from a mixture or combination.

Borer with mixed foods:
:Even though the classic form of borer as performed in the Mishkan involved the removal of pebbles and similar waste matter from the grain produce, sorting/purification is by no means limited to the removal of &quot;useless&quot; matter from food. In fact, any selective removal from a mixture can, indeed, be sorting/purification, even if the mixture contains an assortment of foods. The criteria are types and desire, not intrinsic value. Therefore, removing any food or item from a mix of different types of foods simply because he does not desire the item at that time is considered sorting/purification.

The three conditions of sorting/purification:

:Sorting/purification is permitted when three conditions are fulfilled simultaneously. It is absolutely imperative that all three conditions be present while sorting/purifying

# &quot;B&#x27;yad&quot; (By hand): The selection must be done by hand and not a utensil that aids in the selection.
# &quot;Oḥel Mitoḥ Psolet&quot; (desired from undesired): The desired objects must be selected from the undesired, and not the reverse; that is, unless it is impossible to remove desired from undesirable.
# &quot;Miyad&quot; (Immediate use): The selection must be done immediately before the time of use and not for later use. There is no precise amount of time indicated by the concept of &quot;immediate use&quot; (&quot;miyad&quot;). The criteria used to define &quot;immediate use&quot; relate to the circumstances. For instance if a particular individual prepares food for a meal rather slowly, that individual may allow a more liberal amount of time in which to do so without having transgressed &quot;borer.&quot;

Examples of Permissible and Prohibited Types of sorting/purification:

# Peeling fruits: Peeling fruits is permissible with the understanding that the fruit will be eaten right away.
# Sorting silverware: Sorting silverware is permitted when the sorter intends to eat the Sabbath meal immediately. Alternatively, if the sorter intends to set up the meal for a later point, it is prohibited.
# Removing items from a mixture: If the desired item is being removed from the mix then this is permissible. If the non-desired item is being removed, the person removing is committing a serious transgression according to the laws of the Sabbath.

====Grinding====
Hebrew: (Ṭoḥen)

Definition: Reducing an earth-borne thing&#x27;s size for a productive purpose.

Dissection can arise in simply cutting into pieces fruits or vegetables for a salad. Very small pieces would involve dissection, therefore cutting into slightly larger than usual pieces would be permitted, thus avoiding cutting the pieces into their final, most usable, state.

All laws relating to the use of medicine on the Sabbath are a &quot;toldah&quot;, or sub-category, of this order, as most medicines require pulverization at some point and thus are dissected. The laws of medicine use on the Sabbath are complex; they are based around the kind of illness the patient is suffering from and the type of medication or procedure that is required. Generally, the more severe the illness (from a halakhic perspective) the further into the list the patient&#x27;s situation is classed. As a patient is classed as more ill there are fewer restrictions and greater leniencies available for treating the illness on the Sabbath. The list of definitions, from least to most severe, is as follows:

# / &quot;Mayḥush beAl&#x27;ma&quot; / Minor Indisposition
# / &quot;Mikṣat Ḥoli&quot; / Semi-illness
# / &quot;Ṣa&#x27;ar Gadol&quot; / Severe Pain (Can in some cases be practically regarded as level 4)
# / &quot;Ḥoleh Kol Gufo&quot; / Debilitating Illness
# / &quot;Sakanat Ever&quot; / Threat to a Limb or Organ (Can in some cases be practically regarded as level 6)
# / &quot;Sofek Pikuaḥ Nefesh&quot; / Possibly Life-Threatening (Practically treated as level 7)
# / &quot;Pikuaḥ Nefesh&quot; / Certainly Life-Threatening

For most practical applications the use of medicines on the Sabbath, there are primarily two categories of non-life-threatening (&quot;Pikuaḥ Nefesh&quot;) illnesses and maladies. They are either &quot;Meiḥush b&#x27;Al&#x27;ma&quot; or &quot;Ḥoleh Kol Gufo&quot;. In many or most practical applications for non-trained personnel, there are practically only three category levels (1, 4, &amp; 7) as the line of distinction between them can often be difficult to ascertain for the untrained and it may prove dangerous to underestimate the condition.

====Sifting====
Hebrew: (Merakaied)

Definition: Sorting desirable from undesirable by means of a specifically designed utensil.

This is essentially the same as sorting/purification (see above) but performed with a utensil specifically designed for the purpose of sorting, such as a sieve, strainer, or the like. As such, sorting/purifying with such a device, such as the netting of a tea bag, would be classed as an act of sifting. 

For instance, using a cafetière coffee maker would involve Merakaied. As one pushes the plunger down, to sift out the unwanted coffee grinds, a purification of the coffee solution is taking place. The undesirable grinds are segregated, leaving clear coffee solution that can be decanted to another vessel, e.g., a cup or mug. This act is identical to that the act of Borer but done with a tool or utensil specifically designed for purpose. This classes this act as one of Merakaied, not Borer.

Importantly, Merakaid, unlike Borer, occurs whether one sifts/strains desirable or undesirable components from a mixture. If the separation occurs through use of a specialised tool it falls under the prohibition of Merakaied. 

There&#x27;s no &quot;B&#x27;yad&quot; (by hand) exemptions with Merakaid as there is with Borer. Borer done by hand for immediate use (where one&#x27;s removed the desirable component) is permitted on the Sabbath. In the case of &quot;Borer&quot; the reason this is permitted is because &quot;B&#x27;yad&quot; is logically considered an extension of the &quot;Derech Achila&quot; (mode of eating) principle, which allows all creative activities when done as part of the eating process. As Merakaid has a specific utensil employed, this is considered a stage away from the eating process. Therefore, the extension of the &quot;B&#x27;yad&quot; principle cannot apply.

====Kneading/====
Hebrew: (Losh)

Definition: Combining particles into a semi-solid or solid mass via liquid.

The accepted description of this category, translated to &quot;kneading&quot;, is inaccurate. More precisely, the prohibited activity is amalgamation or combining solid and liquid together to form a paste or dough-like substance.

There are four categories of produced substances:
# &quot;Belilah Avah&quot; (a thick, dense, non-pourable mixture)
# &quot;Belilah Rakha&quot; (a thinner, pourable mixture)
# &quot;Mashkeh/Davar Nozel&quot; (a pourable liquid with a similar viscosity to water)
# &quot;Ḥatikhot Gedolot&quot; (large pieces mixed with a liquid)

Only producing a &quot;Belilah Avah&quot; is biblically forbidden. A &quot;Blilah Raḥa&quot; mixture is rabbinically forbidden but may be produced by using a &quot;shinui&quot; (unusual mode), such as the reversing the adding of the ingredients &quot;and&quot; either mixing in crisscross rather than circular motions or mixing with the handle-end of a utensil. As &quot;Mashkeh/Davar Nozel&quot; and &quot;Ḥatikhot Gedolot&quot; are not really mixtures, even after adding the liquid to the solid, making them is permitted even without a &quot;shinui&quot;.

See further: Mishneh Torah &quot;Shabbat&quot; 8:16, 21:33–36; Shulḥan Arukh Oraḥ Ḥayim 321,324; Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbat&quot; 19

====Cooking/baking====
Hebrew: (Bishul/Ofeh)

Definition for solids: Desirably changing the properties of something via heat.

Definition for liquids: Bringing a liquid&#x27;s temperature to the heat threshold. This threshold is known as &quot;yad soledet bo&quot; (lit. &quot;A hand reflexively recoils [due to such heat]&quot;). According to &quot;Igrot Moshe&quot; (Rabbi Moshe Feinstein) this temperature is .

(Note, however, that &quot;cooking/baking&quot; is permitted on Jewish holidays. It is an exception to the rule that activities prohibited on the Sabbath are likewise prohibited on holidays.)

Any method of cooking food to prepare it for eating is included in this prohibition. For example, vegetables may not be &quot;cooked&quot; to soften them for eating. Baking was performed in the Mishkan as showbreads were continually required. Some opine immersion cooking is listed regarding the preparation of the dyes used for the tapestries.

This law is not restricted to foods. Firing a brick in a kiln or tempering a piece of metal in a furnace would also be included in desirably changing the properties of an item via heat. However, destroying an item, for no constructive purpose, via heat would not be scripturally prohibited. So, overcooking an item until it&#x27;s burnt beyond edibility doesn&#x27;t fall under this prohibition.

===The Order of Garments===

====Shearing====
Hebrew: (Gozeiz)

Definition: Severing/uprooting any body-part of a creature.

Shearing a sheep, having a haircut, plucking one&#x27;s eyebrows or paring one&#x27;s nails would fall into this category. 

This law is analogous to Kotzer. Kotzer is the same activity but performed on a vegetative item still attached to its source of growth. 

See further: Mishneh Torah &quot;Shabbat&quot; 9:179, 22:13–14; Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbat&quot; 21

====Scouring/laundering====
Hebrew: (Melabain)

Definition: Cleansing absorbent materials of absorbed/ingrained impurities.

See further: Mishneh Torah &quot;Shabbat&quot; 9:10–11 22:15–20; Shulḥan Arukh Oraḥ Ḥayim 301–302; Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbat&quot; 22 There are three main areas of this activity: 

* &quot;Sherioh&quot; - Soaking
* &quot;Shifshuf&quot; - Scrubbing
* &quot;S&#x27;ḥita&quot; - Squeezing/Wringing

====Carding/combing wool====
Hebrew: (Menapeitṣ)

Definition: Separating/disentangling fibers.

See further: Mishneh Torah &quot;Shabbat&quot; 9:12; Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbat&quot; 23

====Dyeing====
Hebrew: (Tzove&#x27;ah)

Definition: Coloring/enriching the color of any material or substance.

Merely enriching a color already present, such as applying clear gloss to wood or a fingernail, thus enriching its colour/appearance, would transgress the scriptural law. (This may also present issues of fine-tuning/perfecting, as well).

There may be an exemption for foods as they are not considered permanent. However, aesthetically coloring foods for decoration, such as in a sugar sculpture, is included.

See further: Mishneh Torah &quot;Shabbat&quot; 9:13–14, 22:23; Shulḥan Arukh Oraḥ Ḥayim 320; Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbat&quot; 24

====Spinning====
Hebrew: (Toveh)

Definition: Twisting fibers into a thread or twining strands into a yarn.

See further: Mishneh Torah &quot;Shabbat&quot; 9; Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbat&quot; 25

====Warping====
Hebrew: (Meisach)

Definition: Creating the first form for the purpose of weaving.

See further: Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbat&quot; 25

====Making two loops/threading heddles====
Hebrew: (Oseh Sh&#x27;tei Botei Nirin)

Definition: Forming loops for the purpose of weaving. This also applies to the threading of two heddles on a loom to allow a shed for the shuttle to pass through. 

According to the Rambam, however, this activity is described as the making of net-like materials.

See further: Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbat&quot; 25

====Weaving====
Hebrew: (Oreg)

Definition: Forming fabric (or a fabric item) by interlacing long threads passing in one direction with others at a right angle to them.

See further: Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbats&quot; 25

====Separating two threads====
Hebrew: (Potze&#x27;ah) lit. unravelling. Or, according to the Rambam (Botze&#x27;ah) unweaving

Definition: Removing, cutting or tearing fibres from their frame, loom or place. This would include tearing cotton wool apart.

According to the Rambam it&#x27;s removing/unpicking threads from woven material, which only applies to material that&#x27;s undergone the weaving process. 

See further: Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbat&quot; 25

====Tying====
Hebrew: (Koshair)

Definition: Binding two pliant objects skillfully or permanently via twisting.

See further: Mishneh Torah &quot;Shabbat&quot; 10:1–6; Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbat&quot; 26

====Untying====
Hebrew: (Matir)

Definition: The undoing of any tied (see Tying) or joined (see Tofer) binding.

====Tearing====
Hebrew: (Kore&#x27;ah)

Definition: Ripping an object in two or undoing any sewn (see Sewing) connection.

See further: Mishneh Torah &quot;Shabbat&quot; 10:10; Shulḥan Arukh Oraḥ Ḥayim 340; Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbat&quot; 29, &quot;Shabbat&quot; 7

===The Order of Hides===

====Trapping====
Hebrew: (Tzod)

Definition: Forcible confinement of a living creature.

The Mishna does not just write &quot;trapping&quot;; rather, the Mishna says &quot;trapping deer&quot;. According to at least one interpretation, this teaches that to violate the Torah&#x27;s prohibition of Trapping, two conditions must be met:
# The trapped animal must be non-domesticated.
# The animal must not be legally confined. For example, closing one&#x27;s front door, thereby confining insects in one&#x27;s house is not considered trapping as no difference to the insect&#x27;s &#x27;trappable&#x27; status has occurred. I.e. it was as easy or difficult to trap it now as when the door was open.

This creates practical questions such as: &quot;May a fly be trapped under a cup on Shabbat?&quot; The &quot;Meno Netziv&quot; says that an animal that is not normally trapped (e.g. a fly, or a lizard) is not covered under the Torah prohibition of trapping, but it&#x27;s a rabbinic prohibition to do so, therefore one is not allowed to trap the animal. However, if one is afraid of the animal because of its venomous nature or that it might have rabies, one may trap it. If life or limb is threatened, it may be trapped and even killed if &quot;absolutely&quot; necessary.

Animals which are considered too slow-moving to be &#x27;free&#x27; are not included in this category, as trapping them does not change their legal status of being able to grab them in &#x27;one hand swoop&#x27; (a term used by the Rambam to define this law). A snail, tortoise, etc. may therefore be confined as they can be grabbed just as easily whether they are in an enclosure or unhindered in the wild. For these purposes trapping them serves no change to their legal status regarding their &#x27;ease of capture,&#x27; and they are termed legally pre-trapped due to their nature. Trapping is therefore seen not as a &#x27;removal of liberty,&#x27; which caging even such a slow-moving creature would be, but rather the confining of a creature to make it easier to capture in one&#x27;s hand.

Laying traps violates a rabbinic prohibition regardless of what the trap is, as this is a normal method of trapping a creature.

====Killing====
Hebrew: (Shoḥeit)

Definition: Ending a creature&#x27;s life, whether through slaughter or any other method.

See further: Mishneh Torah &quot;Shabbat&quot; 11:1–4; Shulḥan Arukh Oraḥ Ḥayim 316; Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbat&quot; 31

====Flaying/skinning====
Hebrew: (Mafshit)

Definition: Removing the hide from the body of a dead animal.

(Removing skin from a live creature would fall under shearing.)

See further: Mishneh Torah &quot;Shabbat&quot; 11:5–6, 22:1–10; Shulḥan Arukh Oraḥ Ḥayim 321, 327; Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbat&quot; 32

====/preservation====
Hebrew: (Me&#x27;abaid); sometimes referred to as &quot;Salting&quot; (Mole&#x27;aḥ)

Definition: Preserving any item to prevent spoiling for a long period of time.

The list of activities in the Mishna includes salting hides and curing as separate categories of activity; the Gemara (Tractate Shabbat 75b) amends this to consider them the same activity and to include &quot;tracing lines&quot;, also involved in the production of leather, as the thirty-ninth category of activity.

This activity extends rabbinically to salting/pickling foods for non-immediate use on the Sabbath.

See further: Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbat&quot; 32–33, Shulḥan Arukh Oraḥ Ḥayim 321, 327.

====Smoothing====
Hebrew: (Memaḥeik)

Definition: Scraping/sanding a surface to achieve smoothness. The Jerusalem Talmud (&quot;Shabbat&quot; 7:2) describes the forbidden labor as being learnt from the act of rubbing animal skins against the surface of a stone pillar or column in order to render the hide soft and pliable. 

This law contains a sub-law (known as a &quot;Tolda&quot;) called Memarei&#x27;aḥ which prohibits the smearing or smoothing of an already pliable substance.

See further: Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbat&quot; 34–35

====Scoring====
Hebrew: (Mesartait)

Definition: Scoring/drawing a cutting guideline.

See further: Jerusalem Talmud, Tractate Shabbat, Chapter &quot;Kelal Gadol&quot;, p. 52.

====Measured cutting====
Hebrew: (Meḥataiḥ)

Definition: Cutting any object to a specific size.

=== The Order of Construction ===

====Writing====
Hebrew: (Kotev)

Definition: Writing/forming a meaningful character or design.

Rabbinically, even writing with one&#x27;s weaker hand is forbidden. The rabbis also forbade any commercial activities, which often lead to writing.

This melakha is notable due to the early non-biblical records of its observance. In one of the Arad ostraca (c. 600 BCE) a military commander is told to deliver goods on the first of the month, but only to record this delivery in writing on the second of the month (seemingly because writing was considered a forbidden melakha, and at the time melakha was avoided on Rosh Chodesh as well as Shabbat). Similarly, in the Al-Yahudu Tablets (c. 500 BCE), dates were not signed on Shabbat.

====Erasing====
Hebrew: (Moḥaik)

Definition: Cleaning/preparing a surface to render it suitable for writing.

Erasing in order to write two or more letters is an example of erasing.

====Construction====
Hebrew: (Boneh)

Definition: Contributing to the forming of any permanent structure.

See further: Mishneh Torah &quot;Shabbat&quot; 10:12–14 22:25–33; Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbat&quot; 39–44

Construction can take two forms. First, there was the action of joining the different pieces together, just like in the making of the make the Mishkan. E.g., inserting the handle of an axe into the socket is a derived form of this activity. Another type is to add to an already existing structure called Mosif Al HaBinyan. As such, putting a nail into a wall in order to serve a useful purpose such as hanging a picture, would be adding the nail to the already existing wall structure.

Making a protective covering (or a tent) is forbidden, as is setting up a fixed partition. 

Opening and closing a door is perfectly permitted due to the presence of a hinge. This shows that this is the intended use and falls under a heading of &quot;Derech Tashmisho&quot;/Mode of Use. Opening and closing a collapsible stroller is permitted due to this concept. However, placing a plank or board into a doorway, or gap in a wall to serve as a door is forbidden. This would be an act of construction of plugging the gap in the wall.

====Demolition====
Hebrew: (Soter)

Definition: Demolishing for any constructive purpose.

For example, knocking down a wall in order to extend or repair the wall would be demolition for a constructive purpose. Combing a wig to set it correctly and pulling out hairs during the procedure with a metal toothed brush or comb would be constructive &#x27;demolition&#x27;, as each hair that is removed in the process of the wig (a utensil) is progressing its state towards a desired completion. Each hair&#x27;s removal partially demolishes the wig (for these legal purposes) and is considered constructive when viewed in context of the desired goal.

See further: Mishneh Torah &quot;Shabbat&quot; 10:15; Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbat&quot; 39, 43

====Final Completion/Fine-tuning/Perfecting====
Hebrew: (Makeh bePatish), literally, &quot;strike with [of] the hammer&quot;.

Definition: Any initial act of completion.

This complex, and possibly most abstract section of Sabbath law, refers to activities completing an object and/or bringing it into its final useful form.

For example, if the pages of a newspaper were poorly separated, slicing them open would constitute the final act of completion of the pages.

Using a stapler involves transgressing final completion/fine-tuning/perfection in regard to the staple itself, (in addition to sewing affecting the papers being joined), which is brought into its final useful form by the base of the stapler forming the open staple into a curled clasp around the papers.

Adding hot water to a pre-made &#x27;noodle-soup-pot&#x27; type cup (a dehydrated mixture of freeze-dried seasoning and noodles) would be the final act of completion for such a food as the manufacturer desired to make the product incomplete, awaiting the consumer to finish the cooking process at their convenience. This particular example would also violate Cooking/Baking as well if hot water from a kettle/urn was directly applied.

Musical instruments are Muktza, set aside for non-Sabbath use, as they are delicate and regularly require fixing and/or tuning as part of their regular use. Due to this, a Rabbinic restriction on handling musical instruments was enacted specifically because of Makeh bePatish. For example, if a guitar string is slightly out of tune, even though the whole instrument is not considered broken, the string requires tuning to bring the entire instrument to its desired state. As such, the corrective tuning renders an act of Makeh BePatish on the whole instrument. The guitar is said to be &#x27;in tune&#x27;, ready for usual use. This is considered a significant enough improvement to be an act of Makeh BePatish.

====Ignition====
Hebrew: (Mav&#x27;ir)

Definition: Igniting, fueling or spreading a fire/flame.

This includes making, transferring or adding fuel to a fire. (Note, however, that transferring fire is permitted on Jewish holidays. It is an exception to the rule that activities prohibited on the Sabbath are likewise prohibited on holidays.) This is one of the few Sabbath prohibitions mentioned explicitly in the Torah ().

Judaism requires Sabbath candles to be lit &quot;before&quot; the Sabbath; it is forbidden to light them &quot;on&quot; the Sabbath.

Ignition is one of the Sabbath laws that has been cited to prohibit electricity on Shabbat.

See further: Mishneh Torah &quot;Shabbat&quot; 12:1; Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbat&quot; 46

====Extinguishing a fire====
Hebrew: (Mechabeh)

Definition: Extinguishing a fire/flame, or diminishing its intensity.

While extinguishing a fire is forbidden even when great property damage will result, in the event of any life-threatening fire, the flames must be extinguished, by the principle of &quot;pikuaḥ nefesh&quot;.

See further: Shulḥan Arukh Oraḥ Ḥayim 334; Ḥayei Adam &quot;Shabbat&quot; 45

====Transferring between domains====


Hebrew: (Hotza&#x27;ah)

Definition: Transferring something from one domain type to another domain type or transferring within a public thoroughfare.

(Note, however, that Transferring between domain types is permitted on Jewish holidays. It is an exception to the rule that activities prohibited on the Sabbath are likewise prohibited on holidays.)

All areas are divided into four categories: a private domain (&quot;Reshut haYocḥid&quot;), a public thoroughfare (&quot;Reshut haRabim&quot;), an open, inhabited area (&quot;Karmelit&quot;) and areas not designated for human habitation, such as meadows, forests, etc. (&quot;Karpef&quot;). There are also special &#x27;exempt areas&#x27; (&quot;Makom Potur&quot;) that only exist in public thoroughfares (and tend to be very small) with specific rules. 

Transferring an object from a private domain to a public thoroughfare, and vice versa, is biblically forbidden. Transferring an object between an open area to a private domain or public thoroughfare is rabbinically prohibited. Transferring an object between an exempt area and any other domain is permissible. In addition, transferring an object for a distance of four cubits (or more) in a public thoroughfare or open area is forbidden.

For these purposes &quot;transferring&quot; means &quot;both&quot; &quot;removing [from one domain type] and depositing [in another domain type]&quot;. As such, carrying an article out of one domain type and returning to the &quot;same&quot; domain type, without setting it down in the interim in a different domain type, does not violate this activity. However, it is rabbinically prohibited.

The definition of an area as public thoroughfare or private domain is related to its degree of enclosure, not solely based on ownership.

This law is often referred to as &quot;carrying&quot;. This is a misnomer: carrying within a private domain is permitted; and carrying within an open area is biblically permitted (though rabbinically forbidden).

==Exception: Saving of human life==

When human life is endangered, a Jew is not only allowed, but required, to violate any Sabbath law that stands in the way of saving that person. The concept of life being in danger is interpreted broadly; for example, it is mandated that one violate the Sabbath to take a woman in active labor to a hospital.

<text>Slave Labor Graphics (SLG) is an American independent comic book publisher, well known for publishing darkly humorous, offbeat adult comics. Creators associated with SLG over the years include Evan Dorkin, Roman Dirge, Sarah Dyer, Woodrow Phoenix, Jhonen Vasquez, and Andi Watson.

==Company history==
Slave Labor Graphics was started in 1986 by Dan Vado, who remains the company&#x27;s president and publisher.

The first book Slave Labor Graphics published was &quot;ShadowStar&quot; #3, a female superhero character previously published independently by some of Vado&#x27;s friends. The company&#x27;s first wave of titles (&quot;Samurai Penguin&quot;, &quot;Barrabas&quot;, &quot;Lee Flea&quot;, and &quot;The Light&quot;) were all written by Vado, with art by a variety of creators. Other early titles, such as &quot;Hero Sandwich&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Science With Dr. Radium&quot;, were all created by friends of Vado&#x27;s from high school.

Slave Labor Graphics&#x27;s first major success was &quot;Samurai Penguin&quot; #1 by Vado and Mark Buck, which sold 58,000 copies in the summer of 1986. Other successes were &quot;Milk &amp; Cheese&quot;, a comic about mean-spirited anthropomorphic dairy products by Evan Dorkin, and &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot;, a comic about the adventures of a serial killer by Jhonen Vasquez. In this time period, comic book speculation was rampant, so Slave Labor Graphics was able to sell its entire print run of many titles. However, at the end of the mid-1990s speculation bubble, some distributors went out of business without paying Slave Labor Graphics.

In 1995, Slave Labor Graphics added a more genre-oriented imprint called &quot;Amaze Ink&quot; intended to be for all audiences; the &quot;stranger, more adult, and more difficult to categorize material&quot; would still be published under the main &quot;Slave Labor&quot; imprint.

In 2005, Slave Labor Graphics entered into a partnership with The Walt Disney Company to produce comic book series based on some of its properties: &quot;Haunted Mansion&quot;, &quot;Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Tron&quot;, and &quot;Gargoyles&quot;. Its own creations, such as Little Gloomy (1999–2005), Kid Gravity (2003–2007), and The Super Scary Monster Show: Featuring Little Gloomy (2005–2007), appeared regularly in &quot;Disney Adventures&quot; magazine.

In September 2008, SLG remodeled its lobby to be a smaller gallery/shop which opened as Boutiki in San Jose in December 2008. The gallery/shop is still operating (with name of Art Boutiki) as of 2014 December.

In late 2010, Slave Labor Graphics established an independent record label entitled Slab Yard Sound Company.

In January 2012, editor-in-chief Jennifer de Guzman, who had been with the company since 2001, left to become the PR and Marketing Director at Image Comics.

<text>A baby shower is a party centered on gift-giving to celebrate the delivery or expected birth of a child. It is a rite of passage that celebrates through giving gifts and spending time together. 

==Etymology==
The term &quot;shower&quot; is often assumed to mean that the expectant parent is &quot;showered&quot; with gifts. A related custom, called a bridal shower, may have derived its name from the custom in the 19th century for the presents to be put inside a parasol, which when opened would &quot;shower&quot; the bride-to-be with gifts. 

==Description==

Traditionally, baby showers are given only for the family&#x27;s first child, and only women are invited to party ... though this has changed in recent years, now allowing showers being split up for different audiences: workplace, mixed-sex, etc. Smaller showers, or showers in which guests are encouraged to give only diapers or similar necessities, are common for subsequent babies. 

Activities at baby showers include gift-giving and playing themed games. Giving gifts is a primary activity. Baby shower games vary, sometimes including standard games such as bingo, and sometimes being pregnancy-themed, such as &quot;guess the mother&#x27;s measurements&quot; or &quot;guess the baby&quot;.

According to etiquette authority Miss Manners, because the party centers on gift-giving, the baby shower is typically arranged and hosted by a close friend rather than a member of the family, since it is considered improper for families to beg for gifts on behalf of their members. The pregnant mother, as well as her mother and mother-in-law, and any sisters and sisters-in-law are commonly considered too closely related to properly host a baby shower, but a more distant family member, such as a cousin, might be accepted. However, this custom varies by culture or region and in some it is expected and customary for a close female family member to host the baby shower.

=== Timing ===
Pre-birth baby showers may be held late in the pregnancy, but not usually during the last few weeks, in case of a pre-term birth.

Many cultures do not have pre-birth celebrations. When a baby shower is held after a baby&#x27;s birth, an invitation to attend the shower may be combined with a baby announcement. In China, it is considered unlucky to have a baby shower before the baby is born, and gifts are usually sent after the birth, unrelated to a party. In the US, if a baby shower does not happen before the arrival of the baby, a sip-and-see party or other similar events can be organized after the birth.

== Gifts ==

Guests bring small gifts for the expectant parent. Typical gifts related to babies include diapers, blankets, baby bottles, clothes, and toys. It is common to open gifts during the party; sometimes the host will make a game of opening gifts.

Whether and how a gift registry is used depends partly on the family&#x27;s class, because wealthier families do not depend on the gifts received to care for the baby. Preparing a gift registry is a time-consuming and potentially fun activity for the parents-to-be. It may result in less personal gifts (e.g., the purchase of a store-bought item instead of a handmade one). As with gift registries for other gift-giving occasions, some guests appreciate them, and others do not.

Some families discourage gifts, saying that they want &quot;your presence, not presents&quot;, or organizing a different activity, such as a blessing ceremony.

== Social significance ==
In the United States, the baby shower is the only public event that recognizes a woman&#x27;s transition into motherhood.

The baby shower is a family&#x27;s first opportunity to gather people together to help play a part in their child&#x27;s life. The new parents may wish to call on people to assist in the upbringing of their child, and help educate the child over time. People around the family, who care for them, want to be involved in the child&#x27;s life, and a baby shower presents an opportunity for them to give gifts and be of help, showing their love for the family. If it happens before the birth, it allows the new family to thank everyone.

== History ==

Baby showers are relatively new, having become popular only in the middle of the 20th century, but other celebrations and rituals associated with pregnancy and childbirth are both ancient and enduring.

;Ancient Egypt: In ancient Egypt, rituals relating to the birth of a child took place after the event itself. Quite unlike modern baby showers, this involved the mother and the child being separated to &quot;contain and eliminate the pollution of birth&quot; – this may have included visiting local temples or shrines. After this, household rituals may have taken place, but the specifics are hard to study as these are such female-focuses events.
;Ancient and Modern India: In India, a pregnancy ritual has been followed since the Vedic ages: an event called &quot;Simantha&quot;, held in the 7th or 8th month. The mother-to-be is showered with dry fruits, sweets and other gifts that help the baby&#x27;s growth. A musical event to please the baby&#x27;s ears is the highlight of the ritual, as it was common knowledge that the baby&#x27;s ears would start functioning within the womb. The ritual prays for a healthy baby and mother, as well as a happy delivery and motherhood.
;Ancient Greece: The ancient Greeks also celebrated pregnancy after the birth, with a shout (&quot;oloyge&quot;) after the labor has ended, to indicate that &quot;peace had arrived&quot;. Five to seven days later, there is a ceremony called &quot;Amphidromia&quot;, to indicate that the baby had integrated into the household. In wealthy families, the public &quot;dekate&quot; ceremony, after ten days, indicated the mother&#x27;s return to society. (The ten-day period is still observed in modern-day Iran.)
;Medieval Europe: Due to the likelihood a mother would die in childbirth, this time was recognized as having a great risk of spiritual danger in addition to the risk of physical danger. Priests would often visit women during labor so they could confess their sins. After the birth, usually on the same day, a baptism ceremony would take place for the baby. In this ceremony, the godparents would give gifts to the child, including a pair of silver spoons.
;Renaissance Europe: Pregnancies at this time were celebrated with many other kinds of birth gifts: functional items, like wooden trays and bowls, as well as paintings, sculptures, and food. Childbirth was seen as almost mystical, and mothers-to-be were often surrounded with references to the Annunciation by way of encouragement and celebration.
;Victorian Britain and North America: Superstitions sometimes led to speculation that a woman might be pregnant, such as two teaspoons being accidentally placed together on a saucer. Gifts were usually hand-made, but the grandmother would give silver, such as a spoon, mug, or porringer. In Britain, the manners of the upper-class (and, later, middle-class) required pregnancy to be treated with discretion: the declining of social invitations was often the only hint given. After the birth, a monthly nurse would be engaged, whose duties included regulating visitors. When the nanny took over, the mother began to resume normal domestic life, and the resumption of the weekly &#x27;at home&#x27; afternoon tea an opportunity for female friends to visit. The Christening - usually held when the child was between 8-12 weeks old - was an important social event for the family, godparents and friends. 
;Modern North America: The modern baby shower in America started in the late 1940s and the 1950s, as post-war women were expecting the Baby Boomers generation. As in earlier eras, when young women married and were provided with trousseaux, the shower served the function of providing the mother and her home with useful material goods.

While continuing the traditions from the 1950s, modern technology has altered the form a baby shower takes: games can include identifying baby parts on a sonogram. Moreover, although traditional baby showers were female-exclusive, mixed-sex showers have increased in frequency.

==In different countries==

Baby showers and other social events to celebrate an impending or recent birth are popular around the world, but not in Western Europe. They are often women-only social gatherings.

* In Armenia, a baby shower is called &quot;qarasunq&quot; (քառասունք) and is celebrated 40 days after the birth. It is a mixed party for all relatives and friends. Guests usually bring gifts for the baby or parents.
* In Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States, baby showers are a common tradition.
* In Brazil, a party called &quot;chá de bebê&quot; (baby tea) is offered before birth.
* In Bulgaria, as a superstition, no baby gifts are given to the family before the baby&#x27;s birth. However, family and friends give or send unsolicited gifts to the newborn baby, even if some babies are kept from the public for the first 40 days to prevent early infections. 
* In Chinese tradition a baby shower, &quot;manyue&quot; (满月), is held one month after the baby is born. 
* In Hmong culture, a baby shower is called &quot;Puv Hli&quot;, and is held one month after the baby is born. A ceremony would be hosted by the paternal grandparents or the father to welcome the baby to the family by tying the baby&#x27;s wrist with white yarn and/or strings. 
* In Costa Rica, a baby shower party is called &quot;té de canastilla&quot; (&quot;basket tea&quot;), and multiple events are held for a single pregnancy for the family, co-workers, and friends.
* In Egypt a baby shower is known as &quot; Sebouh &quot; (سبوع) (sebouh means week) which is usually celebrated one week after birth hence its name. This is usually celebrated with a DJ, much decoration, a food and candy buffet, activities and games.
* In Guatemala, only women attend this event. Middle-class women usually celebrate more than one baby shower (one with close friends, co-workers, family, etc.).
* In Indian tradition, they are called by different names depending on the family&#x27;s community.
** In northern India it is known as &quot;godbharaai (filled lap)&quot;, in the Punjab region, it is also known as &quot;reet&quot;. In western India, especially Maharashtra, the celebration is known as &quot;dohaaljewan&quot;, and in Odisha it is called &quot;saadhroshi&quot;. In West Bengal, in many places a party named &quot;sadh&quot; (সাধ) or &quot;sadhbhokkhon&quot; (সাধভক্ষণ) is observed on the seventh month of pregnancy. After this, the woman resides in her father&#x27;s house instead of her husband&#x27;s until the birth. 
** In southern India, in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh it is called &quot;seemantham&quot;, &quot;valaikaapu&quot; or &quot;poochoottal&quot;. The expecting mother wears bangles and is adorned with flowers.
** In Karnataka it is called &quot;seemanta&quot;(ಸೀಮಂತ) or &quot;kubasa&quot; (ಕುಬಸ). It is held when the woman is in her 5th, 7th, or 9th month of pregnancy.
** In coastal Karnataka, especially in Tulunadu (Tulu speaking region), the ceremony is also known as &quot;baayake&quot; (&#x27;ಬಾಯಕೆ&#x27;). Baayake in Tulu means desire. It is popularly considered that pregnant women crave fruits and eatables during the pregnancy period; and the ceremony was designed in the olden days to fulfill the desire or food cravings of the mother-to-be.
** Although these might be celebrated together, they are very different: &quot;seemantham&quot; is a religious ceremony, while &quot;valaikappu&quot; and &quot;poochoottal&quot; are purely social events much like Western baby showers. In a &quot;valaikappu&quot; or &quot;poochoottal&quot;, music is played and the expectant mother is decked in traditional attire with many flowers and garlands made of jasmine or mogra. A swing is decorated with flowers of her choice, which she uses to sit and swing. At times, symbolic cut-outs of moons and stars are put up. The elderly ladies from the household and community shower blessings on the expectant mother and gifts are given to her.
** In Gujarat, it is known as &quot;seemant&quot; or &quot;kholo bharyo&quot;, a religious ritual for most Gujarati Hindus during the 5th or 7th month of pregnancy, usually only for the first child. The expectant mother can only go to her father&#x27;s house for delivery after her &quot;seemant&quot;. They offer special prayer and food to the goddess &quot;Randal, the wife of the Sun&quot;. 
** In Jain tradition, the baby shower ceremony is often called as &quot;Shreemant&quot;. The expectant mother can go to her father&#x27;s house in the 5th month of pregnancy and has to come back before the baby shower ceremony. After the ceremony the expectant mother cannot go back to her father&#x27;s house. The ceremony is only performed on Sunday, Tuesday or Thursday of the seventh or ninth month of pregnancy. During the ceremony one of the practice is that the younger brother-in-law of the expectant mother dips his hands in Kumkuma water and slaps the expectant mother seven times on her cheeks and then the expectant mother slaps her younger brother-in-law seven times on his cheeks.
** In Kerala it is known as &quot;pulikudi&quot; or &quot;vayattu pongala&quot;&#x27;, and is practiced predominantly in the Nair community, though its popularity has spread to other Hindu sects over the years. On an auspicious day, after being massaged with homemade ayurvedic oil the woman has a customary bath with the help of the elderly women in the family. After this, the family deity is worshipped, invoking all the &quot;paradevatas&quot; (family deities) and a concoction of herbal medicines prepared traditionally, is given to the woman. She is dressed in new clothes and jewellery used for such occasions. A big difference in the western concept of baby shower and Hindu tradition is that the Hindu ceremony is a religious ceremony to pray for the baby&#x27;s well-being. In most conservative families, gifts are bought for the mother-to-be but not the baby. The baby is showered with gifts only after birth.

* In Iran, a baby shower (Persian:حمام زایمان) is also called a &quot;sismooni party&quot; (Persian:جشن سیسمونی). It is celebrated 1–3 months before the baby&#x27;s birth. Family and close friends give gifts intended for the baby such as a cot, toys, and baby clothes.
* In the Islamic tradition of Aqiqah, an animal (such as a sheep) is slaughtered anytime after the birth, and the meat is distributed among relatives and the poor. The practice is considered sunnah and is not done universally.
* In Italy a party is held when the expectant mother is three or four months pregnant. Marked by the revelation of the baby&#x27;s gender to parents, friends, and relatives, this festive gathering features an array of food and music. Symbolically, colored balloons, either pink or blue, are released into the air, signifying the anticipated arrival of a baby girl or boy. Attendees express their well-wishes through the presentation of gifts to the soon-to-be parents; this tradition has been recently imported to Italy, where it was not celebrated before the early 2010s; 
* In Mongolia, a baby shower is called &quot;хүүхдийн угаалга&quot; (huuhdyn ugaalga).
* In Nepal a baby shower is known as &quot;dahi chiura khuwaune&quot;. The mother-to-be is given gifts from her elders and a meal is cooked for her according to her preferences. The pregnant mother is often invited by her relatives to eat meals with them. Pasni is a traditional celebration that often marks a baby boy&#x27;s 6th month or a baby girl&#x27;s fifth month, marking the transition to a diet higher in carbohydrates and allowing guests to bestow blessings, and money and other gifts. 
* In Puerto Rico, a baby shower is celebrated anytime after other family members are made aware of the pregnancy, but typically during the last trimester. The grandmother, sisters, or friends of the pregnant mother organize the celebration and invite other relatives and friends. It is not common for men to attend baby showers. The &quot;bendición&quot; (blessing) is bestowed money and other gifts.
* In Russia, and Commonwealth of Independent States, there are no baby showers, though some of the younger generation are starting to adopt the custom.
* In South Africa, a baby shower is called a &quot;stork party&quot; (named after the folk myth that a white stork delivers babies), and typically takes place during the mother&#x27;s 6th month. Stork parties, usually not attended by men and often organized as a surprise for the mother, involve silliness such as dressing up, and mothers receive gifts of baby supplies.
* In Vietnam, as a superstition no baby shower should be planned before the baby arrives. The baby shower is only organized when it is one month old. The baby shower is known as “Đầy tháng” which means “one full month”. The party is usually organized by the baby’s parents and/or the grandparents (baby’s father’s side). Relatives and close friends are invited. Gifts are welcomed, but try to avoid white color material gifts such as white clothing, white towels, white cloths … (mourning color)

==Baby showers for fathers==
Some baby showers are directed at fathers. These may be more oriented towards drinking beer, watching sports, fishing, or playing video games. The primary nature of these gifts is diapers and/or diaper-related items. The organization of the diaper party is typically done by the friends of the father-to-be as a way of helping to prepare for the coming child. These parties may be held at local pubs/bars, a friend&#x27;s house, or the soon-to-be grandfather&#x27;s house. In the United Kingdom, this is called &quot;wetting the baby&#x27;s head&quot;, and is generally more common than baby showers. However, with the growth of American cultural influence – accelerated through celebrities via social media sites like Instagram – baby shower decorations are becoming more common in the United Kingdom. Wetting the baby&#x27;s head is traditionally when the father celebrates the birth by having a few drinks and getting drunk with a group of friends.

There has been some controversy over these, with Judith Martin calling them a &quot;monstrous imposition&quot;, although she was referring to the attitude of demanding gifts and not necessarily the male version of a baby shower.

In Hungary, such an event is called a &quot;milking party,&quot; and is held by tradition in favor of the mother to be blessed with breast milk for the newborn. Practically, it is the last day-off of the father for some time as he is expected to stay home to help. No similar domestic custom exists for mothers, such as a baby shower. Gifts for the baby are given on the first visit to his/her home. This, due to health concerns, happens at the appropriate and suitable time for each counterpart.

==Names for events==

<doc id="862619" wikidata="Q1203937" url="?curid=862619" title="Miura District, Kanagawa">
<text>is a district located in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2009, the district has an estimated population of 32,333 and a density of 1,900 persons per km2. The total area is 17.06 km2.

It currently consists of only one town, Hayama. The cities of Yokosuka, Zushi and Miura were formerly part of Miura District.

== Towns and villages ==
*Hayama

== History ==

Miura District was one of the ancient subdivisions of Sagami Province, covering all of Miura Peninsula. It was under the control of the Miura clan from the late Heian period through the Sengoku period, and was held as &quot;tenryō&quot; territory administered by the &quot;shōgun&quot; under the Tokugawa shogunate of the Edo period. After the Meiji Restoration, it was established as a district under the cadastral reform of 1878, with a district office built near what is now Shioiri Station.

=== Timeline ===
* On April 1, 1889, Miura District was divided into the following municipalities under the Meiji : 
** three towns (Yokosuka, Uraga and Misaki)
** 12 villages (Toyoshima, Kinugasa, Urago, Kurihama, Nagai, Takeyama, Kitashitaura, Nakanishiura, Tagoe, Hayama, Minamishitaura and Hasse).
* On October 1, 1903, Toyoshima Village was promoted town status, but was absorbed into the town of Yokosuka on December 15, 1906 (which Yokosuka was promoted city status on February 15, 1907).
* On July 1, 1911, Nakanishiura Village was renamed as the village of Nishiura.
* On June 1, 1914, Urago Village was promoted town status and was renamed as the town of Taura.
* On April 1, 1924, Tagoe Village was promoted town status and was renamed as the town of Zushi.
* On January 1, 1925, Hayama Village was promoted town status.
* On February 2, 1925, Nagai Village was promoted town status.
* On February 15, 1933, Kinugasa Village was absorbed into the city of Yokosuka.
* On April 1, 1933, Taura Town was absorbed into the city of Yokosuka.
* On July 1, 1935, Nishiura Village was promoted town status and was renamed as the town of Okusu.
* On April 1, 1937, Kuriham Village was absorbed into the city of Yokosuka.
* On April 1, 1940, Minamishtaura Village was promoted town status.
* However, in 1943, Yokosuka expanded greatly by absorbing the towns of Uraga, Zushi, Nagai and Okusu and the two neighboring villages of Takeyama and Kitashitaura.
* On July 1, 1950, Zushi was separated from Yokosuka (becoming an independent municipality once again; which was promoted city status on July 1, 1954).
* On January 1, 1955, Minamishitaura Town, Misaki Town and Hasse Village merged to form the city of Miura.

As of 2009, this leaves only the town of Hayama as the sole remaining portion of Miura District.

<doc id="862621" wikidata="Q60915" url="?curid=862621" title="Fumigation">
<text>Fumigation is a method of pest control or the removal of harmful microorganisms by completely filling an area with gaseous pesticides, or fumigants, to suffocate or poison the pests within. It is used to control pests in buildings (structural fumigation), soil, grain, and produce. Fumigation is also used during the processing of goods for import or export to prevent the transfer of exotic organisms.

Structural fumigation targets pests inside buildings (usually residences), including pests that inhabit the physical structure itself, such as woodborers and drywood termites. Commodity fumigation, on the other hand, is also to be conducted inside a physical structure, such as a storage unit, but it aims to eliminate pests from infesting physical goods, usually food products, by killing pests within the container which will house them.

Each fumigation lasts for a certain duration. This is because after spraying the pesticides, or fumigants, only the pests around are eradicated.

==Process==

Fumigation generally involves the following phases: first, humans are evacuated from the area intended for fumigation and the area covered to create a sealed environment. Next, the fumigant is released into the space to be fumigated. The space is held for a set period while the fumigant gas percolates through the space and acts on/kills any infestation in the area. Finally, the space is ventilated so that the poisonous gases are allowed to escape from the space, rendering it safe for humans to enter. If successful, the fumigated area is now safe and pest free. 

==Tent fumigation==
Structural fumigation techniques differ from building to building. In a residential setting, a &quot;rubber&quot; tent or tents, typically made of plastic/pvc coated canvas material, may be placed over the entire structure while the pesticides are being released into the vacant structure. This process is called tent fumigation, or &quot;tenting&quot;. The sealed tent contains the poisonous gases and prevents them from escaping into the environment. This process is commonly used for the treatment of drywood termites and/or bedbugs, using sulfuryl fluoride as the pesticide (sulfuryl fluoride is a naturally occurring gas, used in much higher concentration than found in the natural atmosphere, and which leaves no physical residue). The fumigated structure can be re-occupied after the tent has been removed and the pesticide has dissipated to a safe level, with no need for physical cleaning.

==Operating theatres == 
Fumigation of hospital rooms with high concentrations of toxic chemicals has been proposed to reduce microbial agents on hospital surfaces and to control surgical site infections. Formaldehyde fumigation has long been an accepted method for areas where microbiological cleanliness is required. Fumigation with formaldehyde vapor is the recognized and most commonly used method because it is a cost-effective procedure. However, alternative methods are sought due to safety and efficacy concerns. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide is a dry gaseous method that has been used as a reliable alternative for aseptic processing isolators, and more recently, for room/facility decontamination. Hydrogen peroxide and silver in solution and diluted in water is a non-toxic and low cost agent. For example, to fumigate a 1000ft3 (~28.32 m3) area, a 20% solution (200mL of solution in 1000mL demineralized water) would be sprayed via fogger for 30 minutes. Fogging may be done at a rate of up to 130mL/minute and the contact time should be at least one hour.

==Chemicals==
At the heart of this technology is the use of chemicals. Ideally, these chemicals kill or passivate the targeted creatures without harming others. Usually such a feat is impossible, so fumigation is conducted in the absence of humans.


===Discontinued or rarely used===
Many chemicals have been discontinued owing to safety issues.
* Ethylene dibromide, carcinogenic
* Methallyl chloride, carcinogenic
* dazomet (methyl isothiocyanate precursor)
* DBCP
* formaldehyde, carcinogenic and explosive 
* hydrogen cyanide, extremely toxic
* iodoform, expensive vs methyl bromide
* methyl isocyanate

==Safety==
Fumigation is a hazardous operation. Generally it is a legal requirement that the operator who carries out the fumigation operation holds official certification to perform the fumigation, as the chemicals used are toxic to most forms of life, including humans.

Post operation ventilation of the area is a critical safety aspect of fumigation. It is important to distinguish between the pack or source of the fumigant gas and the environment which has been fumigated. While the fumigant pack may be safe and spent, the space will still hold the fumigant gas until it has been ventilated.

<text>Cincinnati Bell, Inc., doing business as Altafiber, is a regional telecommunications service provider based in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. It provides landline telephone, fiber-optic Internet, and IPTV services through its subsidiaries Altafiber Home Phone and Hawaiian Telcom, which are the incumbent local exchange carriers for the Greater Cincinnati metropolitan area (aka &quot;The Tri-State&quot;) and Hawaii. Other subsidiaries provide enterprise information technology services and long distance calling.

Cincinnati Bell was founded in 1873 as a telegraph company and for much of its history was a Bell System franchisee. In the 1990s, Cincinnati Bell expanded into Internet access and mobile phone services. The company divested its mobile phone service in 2014 to focus on enterprise and fiber-optic services. It was acquired in September 2021 by Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets, and began doing business as Altafiber in March 2022.

==History==
Cincinnati Bell was founded as the City and Suburban Telegraph Association on July 5, 1873. Founder Charles Kilgour had run the Cincinnati Street Railway with his brother John but became homebound after an accident and began running his business from home via telegraph. The City and Suburban Telegraph Association ran telegraph lines between homes and businesses beginning in 1873, three years before the invention of the telephone. In 1878, it gained exclusive rights to the Bell franchise within a radius of Cincinnati, becoming the first telephone exchange in Ohio and the tenth in the United States. It has substantially the same three-state incumbent local exchange carrier territory today. On August 21, 1877, it signed its first telephone customer, the Cincinnati Gas-Light and Coke Company (later known as Cincinnati Gas and Electric).

The company was renamed Cincinnati and Suburban Bell Telephone Company in 1903.

From 1930 to 1952, the company converted its exchanges from staffed switchboards to dial service. Seven-digit dialing was introduced in 1962. In 1968, electromechanical switching equipment was replaced by one of the first electronic switching systems. The company formally simplified its name to Cincinnati Bell in 1971.

In May 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio awarded Cincinnati Bell Long Distance the right to offer local wireline telephone service in 55 counties outside its incumbent territory and the company began to resell business local phone service in these counties, in competition with incumbent carrier Ameritech.

During the 1990s, Cincinnati Bell acquired a nationwide transmission network formerly known as IXC Communications and changed its corporate name to &quot;Broadwing Communications,&quot; although the local telephone operations continued to operate under the traditional Cincinnati Bell name. The acquisition fell short of expectations due to intense competition and lackluster demand and left Broadwing with over $ in debt. In 2004, the holding company divested the long-distance operation as Broadwing Corporation and changed its name back to Cincinnati Bell.

In 2002, Cincinnati Bell sold Cincinnati Bell Directory, consisting of its directory operations, to Spectrum Equity. The resulting company is named CBD Media. The sale marked the first time a former Bell System-affiliated company had sold off its directory operations. In 2003, when BellSouth exited the payphone market, some former BellSouth payphones in Kentucky were sold to Cincinnati Bell.

In 2017, Cincinnati Bell acquired Toronto-based OnX Enterprise Solutions for $. On July 2, 2018, Cincinnati Bell acquired Hawaiian Telcom Holdco, Inc., parent of local telephone company Hawaiian Telcom, for $. The Hawaiian Telcom acquisition grew Cincinnati Bell&#x27;s fiber network to over .

In September 2021, Cincinnati Bell was acquired by Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets.

===Relationship to the Bell System===
Cincinnati Bell and Southern New England Telephone (SNET) were the only two companies in the old Bell System in which AT&amp;T Corporation only owned minority stakes. Therefore, neither was considered a Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC) for regulatory purposes, restrictions placed on the Baby Bells did not apply to these two companies, and AT&amp;T was not obligated to dispose of their ownership stakes in the companies. AT&amp;T owned 32.6% of Cincinnati Bell until 1984, at which point the shares AT&amp;T owned were placed into a trust and then sold.

Cincinnati Bell was, from 2006 to 2022, the only former Bell System company that continued to publicly do business under the &quot;Bell&quot; name. In July 2006, Cincinnati Bell removed the final iteration of the Bell logo—designed in 1969 by Saul Bass—from most of its corporate branding, leaving only a stylized wordmark. However, the company continued to use the Bell logo in promotional materials for residential landline and long-distance service until it adopted a new logo in 2016.

==Service area==
Cincinnati Bell&#x27;s conventional telecommunications services are concentrated in markets where its subsidiaries have historically enjoyed incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) status. Since the 1870s, Cincinnati Bell Telephone has been the ILEC within a radius of approximately from downtown Cincinnati. , the three-state territory consists of:

* Hamilton County, most of Clermont and Butler counties, and a small part of Warren County in Ohio
* Boone, Campbell, Gallatin, Grant, Kenton, and Pendleton counties in Kentucky 
* West Harrison, Indiana

Beyond its ILEC territory, Cincinnati Bell Telephone additionally serves Mason, Lebanon, and the Dayton metropolitan area through its subsidiary Cincinnati Bell Extended Territories. Hawaiian Telcom, which Cincinnati Bell acquired in 2018, is the ILEC for the entire state of Hawaii.

OnX provides enterprise IT solutions in the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom.

==Services==
Cincinnati Bell has historically focused on traditional landline service, but in recent decades it has expanded into adjacent communications and entertainment services. , legacy voice service makes up only a quarter of the company&#x27;s revenue.

===Landline service===
Cincinnati Bell provides landline PSTN local and long-distance calling. In recent years, the company has seen subscriptions to these traditional services decline due to competition from cable and wireless providers.

===Internet access===

Cincinnati Bell offers Internet access to customers in its service area. Its primary competitor for broadband Internet access is Charter Spectrum Internet.

===Fiber optics===
In late 2009, Cincinnati Bell started offering a fiber-optic communications (Internet, telephone, and IPTV) service called Fioptics, similar to the U-verse service offered by AT&amp;T and the FiOS service offered by Verizon Communications. Cincinnati Bell&#x27;s Fioptics provides Internet at speeds from 5 Mbit/s up to 2 Gbit/s to over 500,000 homes in the Cincinnati metropolitan area. The availability is limited to areas wired for Fioptics, and other Fioptics services are not required. In areas now covered by Fioptics, Cincinnati Bell no longer offers ADSL-only speeds greater than 5 Mbit/s.

, Cincinnati Bell&#x27;s fiber optic network extends nearly .

===Electricity===
In 2011, Cincinnati Bell became the first telecommunications company to also provide retail energy service. Through a partnership with Viridian Energy, Cincinnati Bell Energy competes with several other alternative electricity retailers for the power generation portion of customers&#x27; electricity bills. The subsidiary advertises that its service is entirely sourced from National Wind.

==Former services==
===Wireless telephony===

From 1998 until 2015, Cincinnati Bell Wireless (CBW) offered GSM wireless service in southeastern Indiana, southwestern Ohio, and northwestern Kentucky. It was sold at Best Buy, Circuit City (until 2009), Office Depot, and participating Kroger locations. It offered HSPA+ service in most of Hamilton County, Ohio, and parts of surrounding counties; EDGE service in Dayton and Oxford; and GSM service elsewhere. The local coverage area extended north to Celina and Urbana, east to Hillsboro, south to Corinth and Warsaw, and west to Batesville. Cincinnati Bell&#x27;s prepaid mobile phone products were sold under the same i-wireless brand as an unrelated service by locally based Kroger.

Cincinnati Bell made its first foray into wireless telephony around 1986, when it acquired a 45% stake in Ameritech Cellular. On February 2, 1998, Cincinnati Bell acquired 80% of AT&amp;T Wireless Services&#x27;s new Cincinnati-Dayton PCS network for over $100 million. Cincinnati Bell&#x27;s subsidiary Cincinnati Bell Wireless was responsible for marketing and sales, while AT&amp;T Wireless handled technical operations for the joint venture. Wireless service began by June in Cincinnati and by September in Dayton, eventually covering a 21-county area. When AT&amp;T Wireless was purchased by Cingular, now known as AT&amp;T Mobility, control of its 20% stake also passed to Cingular. On February 17, 2006, Cincinnati Bell took full control of CBW by purchasing Cingular&#x27;s stake for $83 million. As a part of the deal, Cincinnati Bell and Cingular secured lower roaming charges on each other&#x27;s respective GSM networks.

On April 7, 2014, Cincinnati Bell announced plans to sell its wireless spectrum and other assets to Verizon Wireless, as part of a planned emphasis on enterprise and entertainment services such as Fioptics. Cincinnati Bell Wireless ended service on February 28, 2015, and the company&#x27;s retail locations began selling Verizon products.

===Directories===
Like other Bell System–affiliated companies, Cincinnati Bell published a series of local telephone directories, beginning in 1879. In 2002, it spun off these operations as CBD Media.

==Retail presence==
Cincinnati Bell originally operated a chain of Cincinnati Bell Phone Center locations until 1992, when it sold the retail chain to AT&amp;T. It reentered the retail space in 1998 with three Store@Cincinnati Bell retail locations. , the company operates nine Cincinnati Bell Stores.

==Downtown Cincinnati presence==

Cincinnati Bell&#x27;s headquarters are located in the Atrium Two building on 4th Street in Downtown Cincinnati.

The company&#x27;s former headquarters and telephone exchange on 7th Street is known as the Cincinnati and Suburban Telephone Company Building. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Next door is a data center operated by CyrusOne, a former Cincinnati Bell subsidiary. It originally opened in 1975 as Cincinnati Bell&#x27;s central Switching Center.

Cincinnati Bell owns the naming rights to the Cincinnati Bell Connector streetcar line that traverses the downtown area. In August 2016, Cincinnati Bell paid $ to rename the line for 10 years. From 2007 to 2014 Cincinnati Bell also sponsored the annual Cincinnati Bell/WEBN Riverfest, one of the largest fireworks displays in the Midwest.
