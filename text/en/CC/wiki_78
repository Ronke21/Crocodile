<text>Patrick Ray Leonard (born March 14, 1956) is an American songwriter, keyboardist, film composer, and music producer, best known for his longtime collaboration with Madonna. His work with Madonna includes her albums &quot;True Blue&quot; (1986), &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; (1987), &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; (1989), &quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot; (1990) and &quot;Ray of Light&quot; (1998). He scored Madonna&#x27;s 2008 documentary &quot;I Am Because We Are,&quot; played keyboards with her at Live Aid (1985), and was musical director and keyboardist on The Virgin Tour (1985) and the Who&#x27;s That Girl World Tour (1987).

Leonard has also worked with a wide variety of other artists including late-period Pink Floyd and solo Roger Waters, Elton John, Leonard Cohen, Bryan Ferry, Julian Lennon, Rod Stewart, Michael Jackson, Fleetwood Mac, Jeff Beck, Bryan Adams, Peter Cetera, Jewel, Blue October, Duncan Sheik, Michael W. Smith, Marianne Faithfull, and Robbie Robertson. He was half of the art-pop groups Toy Matinee with Kevin Gilbert, and Third Matinee with Richard Page. He has also acted as composer for a variety of films and stage productions.

Leonard has collaborated with Leonard Cohen, acting as a writer and producer for 2012&#x27;s &quot;Old Ideas&quot; and 2014&#x27;s &quot;Popular Problems&quot;, and co-writer, co-producer of 2016&#x27;s &quot;You Want It Darker&quot;. &quot;Nevermind&quot;, a song from &quot;Popular Problems&quot; that Leonard co-wrote and produced, was featured as the title theme for Season 2 of HBO&#x27;s &quot;True Detective.&quot; Cohen remarked that Leonard &quot;is such a magnificent composer. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anybody working today with those kinds of skills.&quot;

In 1997, Leonard released the instrumental album &quot;Rivers&quot; on his own record label, Unitone. In 2024, he released the double album &quot;It All Comes Down to Mood&quot; on his current label, Ruudy 6 Recordings.

== Early career ==
Leonard was born on March 14, 1956, in Crystal Falls, Michigan. He entered the music business with late 1970s Chicago-based pop rock band Whisper, then later the same band membership, Trillion (name changed for legal reasons), featuring future Toto singer Dennis &quot;Fergie&quot; Frederiksen on lead vocals. He also had a short stint as a keyboardist with The Allman Brothers Band in 1980.

He went on to act as musical director and lead keyboardist for the Jacksons Victory Tour in 1984.

==Influences==
&quot;&quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot;, &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, &quot;The Wall&quot; – that&#x27;s what I grew up with and that&#x27;s what I dreamed of doing one day,&quot; he recalled in 1992. &quot;I was a big Gentle Giant fan. I was a &quot;huge&quot; Jethro Tull fan. But I had to feed my children and heat my house, so I wrote some songs with a little girl who became extremely popular. It&#x27;s really that simple.&quot;

==Personal life==
Leonard and Icelandic singer and songwriter Anna Mjöll were married on November 19, 2018, in Patrick&#x27;s home town, Crystal Falls, Michigan.

Leonard has three children: a daughter Jessica, a writer (for whom Madonna&#x27;s song &quot;Dear Jessie&quot; was written), and two sons, Sean, who is a musician, and Jordan, a projection mapper and VJ under the name Pickels Visuals.

<text>Fabio Vásquez Castaño (1940 – 10 December 2019) was a Colombian rebel and revolutionary who was trained by Fidel Castro regime during the 1960s. He was born in Calarcá, Quindío, and was one of the original founders of the Colombian guerrilla group ELN. The ELN movement began in 1964 when a group of students, inspired by Che Guevara and led by Fabio Vásquez, returned from their training in Cuba.

Vázquez Castaño died on 10 December 2019 in Havana at the age of 79.

Following the death of Vásquez, the ELN was led by a series of priests until the emergence of its present leader, Antonio García.

<text>Camilo Torres Restrepo (3 February 1929 – 15 February 1966) was a Colombian Catholic communist revolutionary, an ordained priest, and a member of the National Liberation Army (ELN). During his life, he advocated for liberation theology by trying to reconcile revolutionary socialism and Roman Catholicism. His social activism and willingness to work with Marxists troubled some.

As part of the academic staff of the National University of Colombia, he was a co-founder of the Sociology Faculty together with Orlando Fals Borda, as well as some intellectuals such as Eduardo Umaña Luna, María Cristina Salazar, Virginia Gutiérrez de Pineda, Carlos Escalante, Darío Botero and Tomás Ducay, in 1960.

His involvement in several student and political movements during the time won him a large following as well as many detractors, especially from the Colombian government and the church itself. Due to the growing pressure to back down from his radical politics, Camilo Torres was persecuted and went into hiding (leaving his job as an academic) by joining the guerrillas in Colombia.

He served as a low-ranking member of the ELN to whom he also provided spiritual assistance and inspiration from a Catholic Christian communist point of view. He was killed in his first combat engagement when the ELN ambushed a Colombian military patrol. After his death, Camilo Torres was made an official martyr of the ELN.

He is perhaps best known for the quote: &quot;If Jesus were alive today, He would be a guerrillero&quot;. Camilo Torres, along with Gustavo Gutiérrez, Helder Camara and Des Wilson, is one of the most important figures in the history of liberation theology. He was a life-long friend of fellow socialist Luis Villar Borda and Colombian writer Gabriel García Márquez. In the Dominican Republic in 1970, a revolutionary group that included Catholic clergy members and university students was founded under the name CORECATO, which stood for Comando Revolucionario Camilo Torres (Revolutionary Command Camilo Torres). In New York City, San Romero of the Americas Church-UCC has founded the Camilo Torres Project in 2009. This project works for social justice and peace for the people of the Washington Heights community. 

== Biography ==
=== Childhood and education ===

Jorge Camilo Torres Restrepo was born on 3 February 1929 in Bogotá into a well-to-do family of the liberal bourgeoisie. His mother Isabel told him the story of Father Cuco (Juan de la Cruz Gaviria), a liberal businessman who financed the military campaigns against the conservatives in the civil wars of the 19th century.

His parents took him to Europe when he was only two years old. He returned to the country in 1934. Three years later, in 1937, the couple separated, leaving Camilo and his brother Fernando at their mother&#x27;s side. Expelled for his criticism of the teachers at the traditional Colegio Mayor de Nuestra Señora del Rosario, he finished his baccalaureate at the Liceo de Cervantes in 1946 where he met and became friends with Luis Villar Borda and Ricardo Samper.

His sister Gerda Westendorp Restrepo, daughter of Isabel Restrepo&#x27;s first marriage, was a medical student (the first woman in Colombia to pursue a university degree). Her brother Fernando devoted himself to medicine like his father and older half-sister, and settled in the United States. He was close to Camilo although their professions caused them to see each other sporadically.

Camilo Torres entered the Faculty of Law at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, where he would meet again with Villar Borda, and only studied there for the first semester. During this brief period Camilo and Luis edited the university page of the Bogota newspaper &quot;La Razón&quot;, and on some occasions wrote criticisms against some university magazines that they considered radical.

Influenced by the social ideas of two French Dominican priests, Nielly and Blanchet, whom he met through the father of his girlfriend Teresa Montalvo, daughter of a prestigious Bogota family, the idea of becoming a priest began to take hold of Camilo, and to make this decision, he withdrew to meditate in the eastern plains. After breaking up with his girlfriend and despite the reluctance of his mother and father, Camilo entered the Conciliar Seminary of Bogotá of the Archdiocese of Bogotá (in agreement with his parents to avoid entering the Dominican Seminary of Chiquinquirá which was in poor condition) where he remained for seven years, during which time he began to take an interest in social realities.

=== Priesthood and academic life ===
Poverty and social injustice attracted his attention and, together with his fellow disciple Gustavo Pérez, he created a social studies circle that functioned even after Torres was ordained a priest in 1954 under the direction of Jonatan Gómez. Camilo started social activities in the neighbourhoods surrounding the Conciliar Seminary, which were populated by displaced families from the countryside.

In 1955, in order to specialize, Torres travelled to Belgium, to study for a few more years at the Catholic University of Louvain. The first months were very difficult for the Bogota priest because of the cold climate, Belgian food and the conditions of the boarding house where he lived with Gustavo; for this reason, at the end of the first semester, he moved with his mother to a flat. With a group of Colombian students at the university, he founded the ECISE (Equipo Colombiano de Investigación Socioeconómica) and came into contact with Christian Democracy, the Christian trade union movement and Algerian resistance groups in Paris. He founded the Bogota, Paris and London sections of ECISE. In 1957 he met Marguerite-Marie &#x27;Guitemie&#x27; Olivieri, a Frenchwoman of Corso origin and bourgeois daughter of a doctor like Torres, who was to become his closest friend and secretary, and who by then was living in a poor neighbourhood of Paris, accompanying the pieds noirs in sabotage work against the French regime that was being imposed by force in Algeria. In turn, Torres met Villar Borda again in Berlin and spent holidays in Belgrade where he unsuccessfully wanted to exercise his priesthood, or failing that in Prague. In 1958, the Belgian university awarded him the degree of sociologist. His doctoral thesis, &quot;Una aproximación estadística a la realidad socioeconómica de Bogotá&quot;, a pioneering work in urban sociology in Latin America, was published in 1987 under the title &quot;La proletarización de Bogotá&quot;.
While studying, Torres also studied Marxism after being given a permission to do so by the Cardinal Crisanto Luque Sánchez. He was also exposed to the worker-priest movement; according to Walter J. Broderick, &quot;Camilo came in on the tail-end of it and was enormously affected by the spirit of commitment to the working masses which this movement had aroused in the more generous elements of the French and Belgian clergy&quot;. The impact was profound, and Camilo would accompany a local priest, who adhered to the worker-priest movement, to the poor districts. Broderick recalls that Camilo &quot;became engaged in activities with flesh and blood people. He rarely missed a chance to help out at weekends in a parish of coal miners not far from Louvain, and would go back to his books pondering on what he had seen and heard: the hardships of the miners’ lives, their pastor’s anguish for them and his efforts to improve their lot. For the pastor of this mining town was a firm convert to the Priest Worker Movement.&quot;

After witnessing the poverty of Belgian miners, and under the influence of the worker-priest movement and Marxism, Camilo became embarrassed at his own own luxury, and decided to sell his car and live as humbly as possible. After Camilo informed his mother of his decision, she chastized him; Camilo responded that his &#x27;bourgeois&#x27; status was preventing him from establishing a &quot;real contact&quot; with the workers, whom he came to see as the embodiment of &quot;the person of Jesus&quot;. Torres also stayed in touch with his friends from Colombia through letters, who informed him of dissemination of communist guerrilas and movements in Colombia; Camilo&#x27;s friend Miguel wrote to him: &quot;In my free time I&#x27;m working with the workers, finally...! They have many needs of all kinds and we are going to see how we can organise them to solve them. [...] On the subject of the country [...] I can add that the guerrillas seem to be fuelled by communism, which has gained ground even against the president.&quot; Camilo Torres&#x27; fascination with Marxism led him to visit the Soviet Union at the time and praise Joseph Stalin. Camilo&#x27;s friend who became a communist, Jaime Díaz, praised Camilo for going to Moscow and &quot;praying at the miraculous tomb of our father Stalin&quot;.

In 1959, when he returned to Colombia, Camilo felt compelled to actively support the cause of the poor and the working class. That year he was appointed auxiliary chaplain of the National University of Colombia, in Bogotá. The following year, in 1960, he participated along with Orlando Fals Borda, Carlos Escalante, Eduardo Umaña Luna, María Cristina Salazar, Darío Botero Uribe, Virginia Gutiérrez de Pineda and Tomás Ducay, among others, in the founding of the first faculty of Sociology in Latin America (today a department) of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, where he was a professor and was close to and popular with the students. He was a founding member and president of the Movimiento Universitario de Promoción Comunal (MUNIPROC). With the creation of the Juntas de Acción Comunal (JAC), promoted by the government of Alberto Lleras Camargo, from Law 9 of 1958, Torres recognises in it the possibility of decentralising political power and giving possibilities of empowerment to grassroots communities. Together with teachers and students, he carried out community action programmes in working-class neighbourhoods in Bogotá. Torres was also the organiser of the IX Congress of the Latin American Sociological Association.

MUNIPROC&#x27;s work led to the founding of the first Junta de Acción Comunal (JAC) in Tunjuelito, at that time a working class enclave in the south of Bogotá, where he had been working continuously for several years. In 1963, he chaired the first National Congress of Sociology, also held in Tunjuelito (Bogotá), and presented the study &quot;La violencia y los cambios socio-culturales en las áreas rurales colombianas&quot; (Violence and socio-cultural changes in rural areas of Colombia). Torres was also a member of the technical committee of the agrarian reform founded by the Colombian Institute of Agrarian Reform (INCORA), where he represented the most reformist position of the Board of Directors, which was divided between the Conservative and Liberal parties, typical of the National Front but considered by Torres an inefficient entity in the face of the needs of the Colombian countryside. In his career as a member of the Board, the episode of the project to set up an Agrarian School in Yopal (Casanare) and the difficulties presented by the then director of INCORA Enrique Peñalosa Camargo (liberal, father of the former mayor of Bogotá Enrique Peñalosa Londoño) and Álvaro Gómez Hurtado (conservative, son of former president Laureano Gómez) stand out.

During this period of his life he was interested in founding a farm-school in Yopal (Casanare), as part of the rural action programme that he encouraged in the region and which would go on to achieve other organisational successes; on the board of the Incora, he sparked off a controversy over the application of the law of extinction of ownership restricted to uncultivated lands, which brought him into conflict with Álvaro Gómez Hurtado, also a member of that body and head of the &quot;Laureanist&quot; group of the Conservative Party. Because of the resonance of this conflict, some conservative bishops wrote to the Cardinal to request his dismissal from the board. Invited to Peru, he gave courses and lectures on the subject of agrarian reform and social change. His view of the Latin American situation is not flattering, as he expresses it in a letter from Lima. He writes:

In 1962, the year in which the Second Vatican Council was initiated by Pope John XXIII, Torres was one of the first priests to offer a mass facing forward and in Spanish, when by then the mass was offered facing backwards and in Latin. Between 8 and 9 June of that year, under pressure from Cardinal Luis Concha Córdoba, after entering, together with other professors, into contradictions with the rector, by honouring at mass the students killed after a demonstration repressed by the National Police and by opposing the expulsion of other students, he was forced to resign from all his activities at the National University of Colombia, being transferred to the Church of La Veracruz in Bogotá as coadjutor; assistant to the parish priest with only confession and baptismal certificate functions. This unleashed a strong depression in Torres, who wanted to be close to the people. Shortly before, the Colombian Communist Youth (JUCO) had proposed Torres as rector of the University to a possible shortlist of three but Torres politely declined the offer for fear of tarnishing his name.

In 1964, Concha would later relieve Torres as coadjutor, only admiring Torres as a sociologist, allowing him to become an associate professor in the Faculty of Sociology. He was in turn appointed dean of the Institute of Social Administration of the Escuela Superior de Administración Pública (ESAP) and promoted to member of the Board of Directors of INCORA.

The Unidad de Acción Rural de Yopal (UARY) was inaugurated on 1 March 1964, after overcoming the bureaucratic obstacles of the Ministry of Agriculture, which allowed him to work at the grassroots with the peasants of the capital of the plains. He combined this with the struggles in the junta, especially with the conservative politician who was a staunch defender of the interests of the landowners. He first considered creating a guerrilla group together with Álvaro Marroquín, a student at the National University and member of the JUCO. Torres in turn considered INCORA a deficient entity to attend to the needs of the Colombian peasantry, especially in informal education for their organization in search of an agrarian reform different to that proposed by INCORA.

=== Entering politics ===

The Cuban Revolution, which impacted every country in the Americas, caught Torres&#x27; attention after he returned to Colombia from Europe. In 1965, the Movimiento Revolucionario Libera (MRL) went into decline after its split following the presidential elections of 1962. The 1964 parliamentary elections were marked by an enormous abstention, in which Torres concluded that the traditional parties; Liberal and Conservative, were abandoned by public opinion, so he considered creating a new instrument that would bring together the &quot;Non-aligned&quot; in politics; unions, guilds, associations, students and workers, to confront the decadent traditional parties, although for the time being calling for abstentionism. Torres also tried unsuccessfully to act as a mediator between the peasants and the National Army to prevent the attack on the so-called Independent Republic of Marquetalia, which was his first contact with the Colombian Communist Party.

The American-sponsored attempt to overthrow the Cuban regime rallied socialist guerrillas and revolutionary student movements across the Latin America, and it exposed Torres to the ideas of anti-imperialism. At the time, he identified as progressive Catholic and wasn&#x27;t afraid to raise topics such as poverty and unstable political situation of Colombia. His light-hearted manners made his masses appeal to a wider public, even including atheists. This also marked the time of his rapid radicalization. Torres argued that the Catholic Church is devoted to charity and fighting social inequality, crediting the Church with introducing revolutionary changes to society such as the abolition of slavery and democratic valorization of the human being. However, he believed that in order to truly realise the concept of Christian charity, a total change of power structures was needed, as the hitherto structures were responsible for social and economical inequality and poverty:

He pointed out that the ones who were in the forefront of the fight to change structures were Marxists, and this brought him to the conclusion that collaborating with the Marxists was a necessity. At the same time, he discussed the Marxist thought in his writings - he criticised vanguardism, attacking Lenin&#x27;s concept of &quot;the revolution by the elite&quot;, insisting that a revolution can only be carried out by ordinary people instead. He regarded Marxist humanism as a product of Christian humanist movement, and argued that Marxist principles stem from Christianity itself. He began to admire socialists for fighting for a better society, and believed that Catholics should support their efforts:

In 1964, the Cardinal Luis Concha Córdoba informed the national public opinion that no priest could collaborate in the socioeconomic study commission that had been set up to intervene in the case of Marquetalia, Tolima; this commission, of which Camilo Torres was a member, was trying to evaluate the situation in that region and at the same time to prevent a military solution to the conflict. An attempt is being made to stop a peasant movement that has declared the area an &quot;independent republic&quot;. In the absence of support and guarantees, the rest of the commission was forced to back down - bombings and military occupation of the region followed, leading to the withdrawal of the peasant militias that would later form the guerrilla movement known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. At least in its first period, the FARC had the backing of the Colombian Communist Party.

Later the same year, Torres came into closer contact with groups that agreed with the armed revolution or were already committed to it. He was sympathetic to these groups and his solidarity with them grew stronger and stronger. The Cuban-oriented guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army was founded on 4 July 1964, and made its public appearance with the seizure of the town of Simacota in Santander on 7 January 1965. Camilo considered it extremely important to connect with this insurgent group and he managed to do so through his urban networks.

In 1965, his activities as head of the Institute of Social Administration of the ESAP began to be strongly criticised for their political bias. Faced with the failure of some intellectuals who had undertaken to write articles and papers for a publication aimed at making the situation of Colombian society visible from the perspective of the social sciences, Camilo drafted a political platform open to debate by different groups of intellectuals, students and workers, in which he proposed the union of the popular class to socially renovate the country. This document was widely disseminated during his travels around the country and, thanks to the discussion it was subjected to during this tour, became the platform of the United Front of the Colombian People, the political movement that Camilo promoted as an alternative for the transformation of society in Colombia.

=== The United Front ===
The National Front regime led Camilo Torres in January 1964 to found the Frente Unido del Pueblo; a movement in opposition to the coalition of the traditional parties. Torres went to the home of Marroquín and his partner María Arango to seek contacts with the Communist Party. A meeting with the goal to create a political platform was held, with the participation of the MOEC, the MRL Youth, the JUCO and some student groups from the Universidad de los Andes. However, the hierarchs of the Colombian Church sought to make Torres travel to Leuven, with the ESAP offering to cover the travel costs. However, a meeting in homage to Torres held by the students of the National University dissuaded Torres from travelling. Although Torres was not yet politically active and had no clear political discourse, he was already quite popular.

Torres sought to bring together all the opposition of the time (Anapo, MRL and Colombian Communist Party); however, he didn&#x27;t declare himself a Marxist due to the atheism of the ideology, but related several points to Catholicism itself instead. In June 1965, Torres was reduced to the lay state by his ecclesiastical superior, Cardinal Concha, given his practices and teachings that disregarded what was already established by the Catholic Church in the condemnation of atheistic communism made by Pope Pius XI in his encyclical Divini Redemptoris in the year 1937, and which was confirmed by Pope John Paul II in two documents published by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith during his pontificate in 1984 and 1986 which set out the errors being promulgated by the liberation theology, and at the same time he was removed from his post at ESAP and once again had disagreements with Cardinal Concha, who offered him and his coadjutor bishop Rubén Isaza the post of director of sociology department in the Archbishopric of Bogotá with the mediation of the then priest Ernesto Umaña de Brigard. Torres turned down the offer, seeing that the position was to prevent him from intervening in politics as well as presenting the socio-political platform in Medellín, which was the reason why he had previously been removed from his position at the ESAP. Cardinal Concha argued that the platform went against Catholic ideals and that priests should be apolitical in order to dissociate themselves from Catholicism&#x27;s ambiguous and traditional relationship with the Conservative Party. Torres met with Concha who vehemently opposed Torres&#x27; entry into politics. Umaña then met with Torres and offered him an ecclesiastical post, but Torres requested a dispensation so that he could devote himself to politics and avoid problems with the ecclesiastical authority. Concha accepted the dispensation but offered Torres to accept it if he returned to the priesthood. Torres gave his last mass on 27 June 1965 in the Church of San Diego in Bogotá. Torres then travelled to Lima returning to Bogotá on 3 July to be received by his mother and a crowd of young people.

The platform of his movement sought to address the needs of rural and urban areas, to eliminate the restricted democracy of the National Front at all costs, and the participation of the Church in Liberation Theology. However, the National Front lacked a clear political platform, despite being close to and sympathetic to the revolutionary left; they also had their own newspaper, headed by Pedro Acosta, of the same name, which was only distributed three times a week from 26 August 1965, printed in the workshops of the Antares publishing house and owned by Torres&#x27; friend Gonzalo Canal Ramírez. Despite the growing popularity of the United Front, Torres decided to contact Fabio Vásquez Castaño through student leader Jaime Arenas on 6 July 1965, who had previously led the strike at the Universidad Industrial de Santander. The United Front lasted from August to September 1965 (one month) after breaking with Christian Democracy for imposing a guerrilla line. His decision to resort to armed struggle was taken in the case of Jorge Eliécer Gaitán and expressed to Gloria Gaitán, daughter of the assassinated leader, who offered asylum to Torres, who gradually went underground. Despite this, Torres led a peaceful march with his students in Medellín and was arrested with his demonstrators, all university students, and held at the Asociación Sindical Antioqueña. He would later be intercepted in Ventaquemada on his way to Tunja, and in Bogotá he would also be detained after police repression of a demonstration by the Frente Unido. On 7 January 1966, Torres announced his incorporation into the ELN.
=== Catholic guerrilla ===

In the guerrilla, Torres was mentored and advised by Jaime Arenas, chosen by Fabio Vásquez, also to keep him away from progressive currents. Shortly before joining the ELN, General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, leader of the ANAPO, had recommended Torres not to join any guerrilla group, since being a priest he had no experience in handling weapons to confront the army, so he suggested that he continue in political life since he admired his work with the needy classes, something that Torres disregarded considering the advice as a threat. On joining the ELN, under the nom de guerre of &quot;Argemiro&quot;, the identity of Torres, who was mistaken for a foreigner, was unknown for the moment within the guerrillas, but his identity was later revealed to the guerrillas.

As he explained in his &quot;Message to the Christians&quot; published in the first issue of &quot;Frente Unido&quot;, he realised that the &quot;effective means for the well-being of the majorities ... are not going to be sought by the minorities&quot; and &quot;will not be sought by the privileged minorities in power, because generally these effective means oblige the minorities to sacrifice their privileges&quot;, Torres concluded that &quot;it is therefore necessary to take power away from the privileged minorities to give it to the poor majorities&quot; and that &quot;the Revolution is not only permitted but obligatory for Christians who see in it the only effective and ample way of realising love for all&quot;. This is how Camilo Torres justified his decision in 1965 to quit his job as a teacher and priest, and join the guerrilla, more precisely the National Liberation Army (ELN), although he had previously been interested in joining the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) due to his peasant background.
In the ELN, Torres participated as a low-ranking member and provided spiritual and ideological assistance from a Catholic socialist point of view. However, his performance as a guerrilla was poor as he was not used to the arduous training (being assisted by a comrade) and to carrying a rifle, so he was barely given a pistol and was emphasised for his role of spiritual and ideological assistance as well as being a good cook. He died in his first combat experience, when the ELN ambushed a patrol of the National Army. After his death, Camilo Torres became an official martyr of the ELN.

=== Death ===

Torres died on 15 February 1966 in Patio Cemento, after combat with troops of the Fifth Brigade from Bucaramanga, led by Colonel Álvaro Valencia Tovar, who, ironically years earlier, was his childhood friend. The National Army hid the body in a strategic location separate from the other mass graves and the location was not revealed to the public. A symbolic funeral was held in the church of San Diego and a symbolic burial was held. A mass was also held in the grounds of the National University.

Shortly after Torres&#x27;s death, &#x27;Guitemie&#x27; Olivieri, despite being linked to the ELN, was persecuted by the Colombian authorities and was helped by Junior Fajardo and Rita Restrepo de Agudelo to obtain political asylum, first in Panama, then in Mexico where she married ex-priest Óscar Maldonado, finally in Cuba and then in France.

Years later, Valencia Tovar, now retired as a general, wrote the book &quot;El final de Camilo&quot;, in which he clarified details of the death of Camilo Torres. According to Valencia Tovar, Torres was buried in a detailed place, and they prepared the procedures to hand over the remains to the family. His older brother, doctor Fernando Torres Restrepo, who lived in the United States, was informed about the fate of his brother.

In addition, General Álvaro Valencia Tovar himself revealed in an interview to the magazine &quot;Semana&quot; that the body of Camilo Torres was exhumed three years after his burial, his remains were placed in an urn and transported to Bucaramanga where, through the efforts of the general himself, the Military Pantheon of the Fifth Brigade of the National Army was created and the first remains to occupy a place in that pantheon were those of Camilo Torres, although he did not reveal their exact location, leaving the retired general&#x27;s statements in doubt among the ELN high command.

In January 2016, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, instructed the Colombian National Army to begin the process of searching for and exhuming his remains, in a gesture to accelerate the start of the peace talks with the ELN guerrilla group.

== Recognitions and legacy ==

=== Tributes at universities ===
* The main theater of the University of Antioquia bears the name of &quot;Comandante Camilo Torres Restrepo&quot; Popular Theater.
* One of the main buildings of the Industrial University of Santander has the name &quot;Camilo Torres Building&quot;, on one of its exterior walls you can see a large mural with his face accompanied by a phrase he wrote.

=== Songs ===
Uruguayan singer-songwriter Daniel Viglietti wrote &quot;Cruz de Luz&quot; in 1967, a song about Camilo Torres, which was popularized by Chilean singer-songwriter Víctor Jara. Also the Cuban singer-songwriter Carlos Puebla wrote a song about Camilo titled &quot;Camilo Torres&quot;.The song &quot;Cura y Guerrillero&quot; by the Mexican singer-songwriter José de Molina is dedicated to Camilo Torres and other priests who continue to fight for the same ideals. 
=== Tributes in Latin America ===
The Camilo Torres Muralist Units, close to the Christian Left party of Chile, worked during the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, making murals against the regime, distinguished by their cheerful designs, less abstract than those used by the Ramona Parra Brigade of the Chilean Communist Party.

<doc id="866667" wikidata="Q407916" url="?curid=866667" title="Air de cour">
<text>The air de cour was a popular type of secular vocal music in France in the late Renaissance and early Baroque period, from about 1570 until around 1650. From approximately 1610 to 1635, during the reign of Louis XIII, this was the predominant form of secular vocal composition in France, especially in the royal court.

==Features==
The first use of the term &quot;air de cour&quot; was in Adrian Le Roy&#x27;s &quot;Airs de cour miz sur le luth&quot; (Book on Court Tunes for the Luth), a collection of music published in 1571. The earliest examples of the form are for solo voice accompanied by lute; towards the end of the 16th century, four or five voices are common, sometimes accompanied (or instrumental accompaniment may have been optional); and by the mid-17th century, most &quot;airs de cour&quot; were again for solo voice with accompaniment. Beginning in 1608, &quot;airs de cour&quot; were often taken from &quot;ballets de cour&quot;, a form of ballet which was quickly becoming popular at the French court.

Musically they were strophic, i.e. successive verses of the text were set with similar music. While the earlier music, especially that for multiple voices, was polyphonic, after about 1610 the music usually was homophonic, sung syllabically and without meter, with a clear influence from the &quot;musique mesurée&quot; which developed in Paris around 1570. Collections exist which deviate considerably from these trends, however; several printers specialized in polyphonic &quot;airs de cour&quot; throughout the early 17th century, and there are eight volumes published by Le Roy &amp; Ballard which are monophonic – for a single voice with &quot;no&quot; accompaniment.

&quot;Airs de cour&quot; show surprisingly little influence from the Italian early Baroque trends of monody and the madrigal, either in its polyphonic or its concertato form. This is all the more surprising as Italian musicians often worked in France, and the polyphonic and concertato forms of madrigal were being deeply influential in Germany at the same time. Emotional expression in the &quot;airs de cour&quot;, compared to that of the contemporary Italian madrigalists, is cool, classical and reserved, in keeping with contemporary French taste. Vocal range of the music is usually limited to one octave; dissonance and chromaticism are rare; and the overall simplicity of expression is striking.

The influence of the &quot;air de cour&quot; extended beyond France. Collections were published in Germany, and more importantly in England, where translations were rather popular, as attested by the several publications and copies. There exists a delightfully titled publication:
&quot;French Court-airs, with their Ditties Englished&quot;,
(Edward Filmer, 1629), The &quot;air de cour&quot; had considerable influence on the development of the English ayre.

The atmosphere of these songs is very different from the English lute song, and the lute technique employs some novel features. There are notated &quot;strummings&quot; with the 1st finger, both up and down. There have been several articles on the finer points of this, as well as the exact meaning of the notation, in the English and French Lute Society Journals.

<text>He Zizhen (; 20 September 1910 – 19 April 1984) was a Chinese soldier, revolutionary, and politician who was the third wife of Chairman Mao Zedong from 1928 to 1937 and participated in the Long March.

==Early life and career==

He Zizhen was born in Yunshan (云山, now Yongxin County), Jiangxi, in 1910, as He Guiyuan (贺桂圆), the second of four children. He&#x27;s family were impoverished scholar-gentry that ran a tea house and sent He to a free Protestant missionary school in her youth. She joined the Communist Youth League of China in 1925 along with her siblings. He Zizhen later graduated from the Yongxin Girls&#x27; School and became a full member of the Chinese Communist Party in 1926.

==Revolutionary life==

=== Early communist activities ===
As a party member He Zizhen was made head of the county&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Bureau and worked as a traveling propagandist. She fought in the Yongxin uprising of 1927 and began serve as a communist partisan. An expert in guerrilla warfare and a capable fighter, He Zizhen was also an excellent shooter who earned the nickname of &quot;Two-Gunned Girl General&quot;.

=== Relationship with Mao and the Long March ===
He Zizhen was introduced to Mao Zedong at Jinggangshan by Yuan Wencai, a classmate of her elder brother, in the spring of 1928. She and Mao married in 1928. When they married, Mao had not divorced his second wife Yang Kaihui, whom he had wed in 1920. Yang was arrested and executed in 1930 by the Kuomintang. While with Mao, He Zizhen restricted herself to clerical work and served as Mao&#x27;s secretary. Despite this, she was still severely injured by shrapnel in 1935 and needed to be carried by stretcher on parts of the Long March, suffering 17 gunshot wounds during it.

He Zizhen had three daughters and three sons with Mao Zedong – she was pregnant ten times in her life– but except for their daughter, Li Min, all of them either died young or were separated from the family. This was partially due to the constant movement of the communists as they worked to evade the Kuomintang. Their eldest daughter, who was left to a local family in Fujian, was found and recognized by He Zizhen&#x27;s brother in 1973, but never had the chance to meet Mao or He. 
Being closely pursued and having given birth to a daughter, He glanced at her and was carried back to the Long March, leaving 13 yuan and a note behind. Two English researchers who retraced the entire Long March in 2002–2003 located a woman whom they believe might be a missing child left in the care of others by Mao and He in 1935.

=== Divorce from Mao and sojourn in Russia ===
In 1937, Mao had allegedly begun an affair with Wu Lili, the interpreter of journalist Agnes Smedley. After a confrontation with Mao, He Zizhen traveled, pregnant, to the Soviet Union for treatment of a wound suffered earlier in battle, later attending the Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies, under the pseudonym Ven Iun. In Moscow, in 1938, He Zizhen gave birth to a boy, Xiao Liuwa, who died shortly of pneumonia. Her daughter, Li Min, also suffered pneumonia after arriving in Moscow with Mao Anqing and Mao Anying to accompany He. According to Mao Anying, He Zizhen suffered severe depression after losing yet another child. To support three children, He took in washing, knitted socks, and went logging on weekends.

While He Zizhen was in Russia, Mao courted Jiang Qing, who would become his fourth wife. He Zizhen was reportedly &quot;dispatched to a mental asylum in Moscow to make room for Jiang&quot;. He Zizhen was labeled schizophrenic and confined in a sanitarium between 1942 and 1946.

=== Later life and death ===
Upon her return to China in 1947, she found she could not hope to fulfill any sort of political role in Beijing, and moved to southern China, staying variously in Nanchang, Fuzhou and finally Shanghai. She later became the chair of Zhejiang Province Women&#x27;s Union. After 1972, He raised her granddaughter, Kong Dongmei, in Shanghai. Together they traveled to the Chairman Mao Memorial Hall, when He was elected to the fifth Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference. She spent her last years in hospital in Shanghai, where she died on 19 April 1984.

==Legacy==
In 2007, a memorial hall was opened in Yongxin for He Zizhen with her daughter, Li Min, present as a guest.

<text>Marilyn Martin (born May 4, 1954) is an American singer and songwriter. She is best known for her 1985 hit duet with Phil Collins, &quot;Separate Lives&quot;, which reached number one on several charts.

== Early life ==
Marilyn Martin was born on May 4, 1954, in Tennessee but raised in Louisville, Kentucky. She was exposed to different genres of music as a child. Her father was a country and bluegrass fan, her mother liked R&amp;B and her grandmother sang gospel. At age 18 she started singing with different bands, eventually joining one from Akron, Ohio. After five years of club gigs, the band had an opportunity to tour with Joe Walsh, who was headlining with Stevie Nicks. Also on the tour were Michael McDonald, Boz Scaggs, and Kenny Loggins. After the tour, Martin moved to Los Angeles, California, and began a prolific career as a backing vocalist for artists including Stevie Nicks, Joe Walsh, Don Henley, Tom Petty and Kenny Loggins.

== Career ==
Martin became a protégée of Doug Morris, the then-head of Atlantic, who had heard her backing vocals on Nicks&#x27; album, &quot;Rock a Little,&quot; and was impressed enough to ask for a demo. She recorded the Nicks&#x27; song &quot;Sorcerer&quot; (on which Nicks sang backing vocals) for the Jim Steinman soundtrack of the 1984 film &quot;Streets of Fire&quot;. Morris signed Martin to a two-album recording contract and connected her with Phil Collins for &quot;Separate Lives,&quot; part of the soundtrack for the 1985 film &quot;White Nights&quot;. The song was a number one hit in the U.S. and a Top 5 hit in the United Kingdom.

Martin&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released in January 1986, reaching number 72 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with the single &quot;Night Moves&quot; reaching number 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Two other singles were also released from the album, &quot;Body and the Beat&quot; and &quot;Move Closer,&quot; but neither charted. Her second album, &quot;This Is Serious&quot;, was released in 1988, with its lead single &quot;Possessive Love&quot; written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard. The single &quot;Love Takes No Prisoners&quot; was released as well, with the ballad &quot;Quiet Desperation&quot; as the B-side. The same year, Martin recorded the duet &quot;And When She Danced&quot;, used in the movie &quot;Stealing Home&quot;.

Neither the singles nor the album were commercially successful, and Atlantic dropped her. She continued her career as a backing vocalist into the 1990s. In 1993, Martin moved to Nashville where she recorded a country album, &quot;Through His Eyes&quot;, for Atlantic in 1994. The album was never released, but is available through Martin&#x27;s official website. it wasn&#x27;t released for 30 years until it was released in 2024

In 1997, Martin recorded a duet &quot;I Live for Love&quot; with David Hasselhoff, which appears on his album &quot;Hooked on a Feeling&quot;.

On September 14, 2012, Martin released the album &quot;Trust, Love, Pray&quot;, a Christian music album featuring songs written by Martin, including &quot;Every Way and Always&quot;, which received airplay on Christian, Praise, and Worship stations.

Marilyn reunited with Stevie Nicks in October 2016, singing backup vocals for the 24 Karat Gold Tour and filling in for Lori Nicks. She continued working with Stevie Nicks, touring as a backing vocalist with Fleetwood Mac in 2019.

== Personal life ==
Martin has been married to guitarist, music producer and engineer Greg Droman since 1976. The pair lived in Nashville in the 1990s and 2000s, where Martin was small business owner and a real estate agent. The couple later moved to Los Angeles and live in Healdsburg, California.

<text>A Flora is a book or other work which describes the plant species occurring in an area or time period, often with the aim of allowing identification. The term is usually capitalized to distinguish it from the use of &quot;flora&quot; to mean the plants rather than their descriptions. Some classic and modern Floras are listed below.

Traditionally Floras are books, but some are now published on CD-ROM or websites. The area that a Flora covers can be either geographically or politically defined. Floras usually require some specialist botanical knowledge to use with any effectiveness.

A Flora often contains diagnostic keys. Often these are &quot;dichotomous&quot; keys, which require the user to repeatedly examine a plant, and decide which one of two alternatives given in the Flora best applies to the plant.

Floras produced at a local or regional level rarely contain identification keys. Instead they aim to impart more detailed understanding of the local status and distribution of that area&#x27;s plants. Maps showing species distribution may be included, and nowadays are computer-generated from biological databases. Specific reference may be made to new arrivals and historic records in order to impart understanding of the changes in an area&#x27;s vegetation over time.

<text>Pendekar (hero; master of swordsmanship or martial arts), Pandikar or Pandeka is a Malay word to reference or address a warrior who mastered martial arts, particularly silat. Not all masters carry the title; it must be either officially bestowed by royalty (similar to a knighthood) or unofficially by commonfolk. The latter is more common today, especially outside Southeast Asia. Today, the title is often adopted by the founder of a new style. Parallels can be drawn to the chess term grandmaster since the title of Pandeka is the highest possible rank of a practitioner of the Malaysian martial art silat.

==Etymology==
Some theorize that it is a compound of the Malay words &quot;pandai&quot;, meaning clever or skilled, and &quot;akar&quot; meaning root. It may be related to the Kawi terms &quot;upakara&quot; which means teacher, and &quot;kekarepan&quot; which means ethos or ambition. A variant of pendekar is the word &quot;pakar&quot; which can mean any kind of expert.

==Attributes of a pendekar==
A pendekar must master every aspect of silat. These include the forms and techniques, their combat application, internal methods and traditional medicine. A pendekar must be more than an instructor or expert, they must be a fighter, a traditional doctor, and a participant in the culture and wisdom of silat. The emphasis given to each of these varies from one style to another. Some systems are more sport-oriented while others focus on spiritual development. Traditional masters only consider a style to be &quot;true silat&quot; if it can be used in battle.

Meditation and internal training serves as a counterbalance for a warrior&#x27;s martial skills. In northern Malaysia and southern Thailand, this balance is symbolised by the concept of &quot;jantan betina&quot; (male-female), equivalent to the Chinese yin and yang. In Indo-Malay folklore, esoteric knowledge is only gained by fasting and then meditating under a tree. Silat practitioners of the past would meditate and fast at length, often in caves, jungles and even graveyards so they would not fear death. With this mentality, a pendekar is always prepared for combat, whether they are unarmed or outnumbered. This is encapsulated in the Malay saying &quot;From the tips of the hair to the tips of the toes&quot; (&quot;Dari hujung rambut ke hujung kaki&quot;) meaning that all are potential weapons to be used at the right moment.

Purportedly, a pendekar of the highest skill needs no weapon aside from their mind to subdue the opponent. By focusing their energy, masters were said to be able to attack an opponent without physically touching them, strike a vital point from afar, or stop someone&#x27;s heart without them noticing they&#x27;ve been hurt. Silat folklore is replete with tales of fighters possessing such skills as the ability to run very rapidly, vanish in a puff of smoke and reappear, change form, dash across the surface of water, turn invisible, or leap to the roof of a house.

Finally, a pendekar must be familiar with traditional healing methods. Massage is commonly taught alongside silat because of its relation to &quot;sentuhan&quot; or the art of striking pressure points. Sentuhan could also be applied to other aspects of healing such as stopping a wound from bleeding or stimulating energy flow. Some masters may have knowledge of herbalism or bone-setting. It was once considered necessary for anyone teaching silat to be able to nurse injured students back to health.

<text>Teal is a greenish-blue color. Its name comes from that of a bird—the Eurasian teal (&quot;Anas crecca&quot;)—which presents a similarly colored stripe on its head. The word is often used colloquially to refer to shades of cyan in general.

It can be created by mixing cyan into a green base, or deepened as needed with black or gray. It is also one of the first group of 16 HTML/CSS web colors. In the RGB model used to create colors on computer screens and televisions, teal is created by reducing the brightness of cyan to about one half.

In North America, teal was a fad color during the 1990s, with, among others, many sports teams adopting the color for their uniforms.

==Etymology==
The first recorded use of &quot;teal&quot; as a color name in English was in 1917. The term &quot;teal&quot; (referring to a species of duck) is derived from the Middle English &quot;tele&quot;, a word akin to the Dutch &quot;taling&quot; and the Middle Low German &quot;telink&quot;.

==Variations==
===Teal blue===
Teal blue is a medium tone of teal with more blue. The first recorded use of &quot;teal blue&quot; as a color name in English was in 1927.

The source of this color is the &quot;Plochere Color System&quot;, a color system formulated in 1948 that is widely used by interior designers. Teal was subsequently a heavily used color in the 1950s and 1960s.

Teal blue is also the name of a Crayola crayon color (color #113) from 1990 to 2003.

===Teal green===
Teal green is a darker shade of teal with more green. It is a variable color averaging a dark bluish-green that is green, darker, and stronger than invisible green or pine tree.

Teal green is most closely related to the Crayola crayon color Deep Space Sparkle.

===Deep sea green===
Deep sea green is one of the paint colors manufactured and marketed by American paint company Benjamin Moore.

==In culture==
;Aviation: TEAL is the acronym for Tasman Empire Airways Limited, the forerunner of Air New Zealand, who used teal as their airline&#x27;s signature color; it appeared not just on plane livery but promotional material and airline bags. When New Zealanders refer to ‘teal green,’ they are more likely referring to the airline color than the bird&#x27;s color.

;Rapid transit: Teal is the official color of Kochi Metro, the rapid transit system serving the city of Kochi in India.

Flags
*The flag of Mozambique contains a greenish-teal horizontal stripe.
*The teal stripe in the flag of Sri Lanka represents Sri Lankan Muslims.

;Business: A Teal organisation is an emerging organisational paradigm.

;Military: Armies that used feldgrau, cadet gray and similar shades of grayish green for field uniforms in the late 19th and early 20th century commonly used more saturated color for officers, often tending on teal. The armed forces of the Netherlands used teal field uniforms up to the 2nd World War. Some of the modern parade uniforms of the Russian Armed Forces are also teal, though named &quot;wave-green&quot; in the service.

Sports
*Teal is the jersey color of the Belfast Giants. The color was chosen to be a neutral color in the often heated sporting environments of Belfast. It is also worn by the Charlotte Hornets of the NBA and The Port Adelaide Football Club in the AFL also feature teal in their team colors.
*The Jacksonville Jaguars of the NFL use teal as one of their primary colors. The Miami Dolphins use a variation called Aqua as their primary color. The Philadelphia Eagles also use a variation called &quot;Midnight Green&quot;.
*Two teams in Major League Baseball use the color teal. The Seattle Mariners use a variant known as &quot;Northwest Green&quot; as one of their primary colors while the Arizona Diamondbacks use teal as an alternate color.
*In the National Hockey League, the San Jose Sharks use a variation called &quot;Deep Pacific Teal&quot; as their primary color. The Mighty Ducks of Anaheim used a variation of teal known as &quot;Jade&quot; as a primary color until 2006 when the team was rebranded to the Anaheim Ducks. The color is still used today on the team&#x27;s alternate uniform.
*The Penrith Panthers of the NRL used in the early 2000s teal as a secondary color.
*The Griquas of the Currie Cup use teal as primary color (although is officially defined peacock blue).

;Foods: Gummy bears are commonly teal.

;Social &amp; political: Represents intersectionality of those who reflect on equality and social justice for all marginalized groups and misunderstood groups such as women, LGBTQ+, people of color, the homeless, persons with mental illness (eg, PTSD, depression), the poor and other groups that go under represented and/or devalued in the US.

Computing
*Windows 95 featured a teal-colored default wallpaper.
*&quot;Heroes of Might and Magic III&quot; featured a teal-colored party.

Film

;Religion: The Hermit Intercessors of the Lamb, a Christian contemplation group in the state of Nebraska, wears habits with a teal scapular to symbolize intercession between heaven (blue) and earth. Originally organised as a Roman Catholic association, it was suppressed in 2010 by the Archbishop of Omaha, who directed members to cease wearing the scapular in Church activities.

;Politics: In Australia, the color teal, and the term &quot;teal independents&quot;, have become associated with a group of independent candidates in the 2022 Australian federal election who campaigned on a platform highlighting the importance of climate change action, tackling corruption in politics, and gender equality. These candidates are largely supported by Climate 200 and are often referred to by the media as &#x27;teals&#x27; because that color is a dominant feature in some of their campaigns. Nominally, their policy platform reflected those of both the Liberals and the Greens.
;Art history: Green pigments for paints and fabric dyes were difficult to obtain from nature in the past, thus they were rarely employed in clothes or heraldic emblems. While green may have been blended with blue and yellow paints, mixing dissimilar substances was frowned upon due to suspicion of alchemy. Only during the early Renaissance did the superstitious custom fade away, and in the late eighteenth century, the German Swedish scientist Carl Wilhelm Scheele found new copper greens.

;Issue awareness: Teal is the color of ovarian cancer awareness. Ovarian cancer survivors and supporters may wear teal ribbons, bracelets, T-shirts, and hats to bring public attention to the disease.

Academia

Teal, along with Bronze, is the school color for Coastal Carolina University.

<text>Braulio Dueño Colón (March 26, 1854 – April 4, 1934) was a Puerto Rican musician and composer.

==Early years==
Dueño was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. At a young age Dueño&#x27;s father, who also loved music, taught him the basics of music and served as his inspiration. Dueño took music classes with &quot;Maestro&quot; Aruti, with whom he learned about composition and harmony. When an opera or zarzuela company visited Puerto Rico, they would hire a local orchestra to play their musical scores. When Dueño was a young man he would be hired to play the flute in many of these orchestras.

==Musical career==
In 1879, he composed the music for the zarzuela &quot;Los Baños de Coamo&quot; (&quot;The Baths of Coamo&quot;) which was originally written by Genaro de Arazamendi, in honor of the hot springs in the town by the same name.

Dueño participated in many literary-musical contests in the Ateneo Puertorriqueño. He won many prizes and honors for his compositions. Among the pieces honored were:
* &quot;La Amistad&quot; (&quot;Friendship&quot;, an overture), 1877;
* &quot;Sinfonía Dramática&quot; (&quot;Dramatic Symphony&quot;);
* &quot;Noche de Otoño&quot; (&quot;An Autumn Night&quot;), 1887;
* &quot;Estudio sobre la Danza Puertorriqueña&quot; (&quot;A Study of the Puerto Rican Danza&quot;), 1914.

However, it was the series of &quot;Canciones Escolares&quot; (School Songs, 1912), which were co-written with Virgilio Dávila and Manuel Fernández Juncos, that would give him lasting recognition as one of Puerto Rico&#x27;s greatest composers. The &quot;Canciones Escolares&quot; not only won the highest honors in the Ateneo but was also acclaimed and honored at the Pan-American Exposition of 1901. The &quot;Canciones Escolares&quot; became an important part of Puerto Rican culture.

==Later years==
Braulio Dueño Colón lived most of his life in the city of Bayamón, where he died on April 4, 1934. The city of Bayamón honored the memory of Braulio Dueño Colón by naming a school, a suburb and the municipal cemetery after him. He was buried at the Braulio Dueño Colón Municipal Cemetery.

<doc id="866706" wikidata="Q658182" url="?curid=866706" title="Sade (band)">
<text>Sade ( or ) are an English band, formed in London in 1982 and named after their lead singer, Sade Adu. The band consists of Adu alongside bassist Paul Denman, saxophonist and guitarist Stuart Matthewman, and keyboardist Andrew Hale. Founding drummer Paul Anthony Cooke left the band in 1984, while Dave Early, Cooke&#x27;s replacement, left in 1985. Since Early&#x27;s departure in 1985, the band has employed numerous session and touring drummers in absence of an official drummer. The band&#x27;s music features elements of soul, quiet storm, smooth jazz and sophisti-pop. All of the band&#x27;s albums, including compilations and a live album, have charted in the US Top Ten.

The band&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Diamond Life&quot; (1984), reached number two on the UK Album Chart, selling over 1.2 million copies and won the Brit Award for Best British Album in 1985. The album was also a hit internationally, reaching number one in several countries and the top ten in the United States, where it has sold four million copies to date.

In late 1985, the band released its second studio effort &quot;Promise&quot;, which peaked at number one in both the United Kingdom and the US. It was certified double platinum in the UK and quadruple platinum in the US. In 1986, Sade won a Grammy Award for Best New Artist. Their fifth studio album, &quot;Lovers Rock&quot; (2000), won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. Their sixth studio album, &quot;Soldier of Love&quot; (2010), peaked at number four in the UK and number one in the US. In 2011, the band won its fourth Grammy for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.

Sade&#x27;s US certified sales in 2012 stood at 23.5 million units according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and by 2014 sold more than 75 million records worldwide to date. The band were ranked at No. 50 on VH1&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;.

==History==
===1980s===
The musical group Sade was formed in London in 1982, by members of the Latin soul band Pride. Sade Adu, Stuart Matthewman (sax), Paul Denman (bass), and Paul Anthony Cooke (drums), formed the break-away group and began to write its material. They named the band after lead singer Sade Adu, and made its debut performance in December 1982 at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Club in London in support of Pride. In May 1983, the band performed its first US show at Danceteria in New York City. Andrew Hale joined on keyboards in mid-1983; Cooke was replaced on drums by Dave Early in early 1984.

Sade received more attention from the media and record companies than Pride had, and eventually separated from that group altogether. On 18 October 1983, the singer signed with CBS Records (which was absorbed by its parent label, Epic Records, in 1986). When singer Sade and her band of the same name were establishing themselves, its record company, Epic, printed &quot;Pronounced Shar-day&quot; on the record labels of its releases (which led to &quot;mis&quot;pronunciation in rhotic North America).

In February 1984, Sade released its first single, &quot;Your Love Is King&quot;, which became a Top Ten hit. A second single, &quot;When Am I Going to Make a Living&quot; barely made the Top 40, but the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Diamond Life&quot;, was released in July 1984 and peaked at No. 2. It spent over six months in the UK Top Ten and was later certified 4× platinum by the BPI. &quot;Diamond Life&quot; won the 1985 Brit Award for Best British Album, and was later included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

The band embarked on its first major UK tour, augmented by Dave Early (drums), Martin Ditcham (percussion), Terry Bailey (trumpet) and Gordon Matthewman (trombone). A third single, &quot;Smooth Operator&quot;, was released from the album with a video directed by Julien Temple. The single became its first US hit in spring 1985, propelling the album in the US Top Ten. Also in 1985, the band were nominated for two MTV Video Music Awards—&quot;Best Female Video&quot; and &quot;Best New Artist&quot;.

On 13 July 1985, Sade performed at the Live Aid at Wembley Stadium in London. Sade Adu became the only African-born artist to appear in front of the live audience of 75,000 and an estimated worldwide television audience of 1.4 billion in 170 countries.

In late 1985, Sade released its second album, &quot;Promise&quot;, which peaked at No. 1 in both the UK and the US. It was certified double platinum by the BPI in the UK, and quadruple platinum in the US. In 1986, Adu was nominated for an American Music Awards for Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Female Video Artist, and the band won a Grammy Award for Best New Artist. On 28 June 1986, after touring for the album, the band performed at the Artists Against Apartheid Concert in the Freedom Festival on Clapham Common in London. In 1987 the band was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group for &quot;Promise&quot;.

Sade&#x27;s third album, &quot;Stronger Than Pride&quot;, was released in May 1988. The album peaked at No. 3 in the UK and has been certified platinum by the BPI. It was preceded by the single &quot;Paradise&quot;, which made the UK Top 30 and US Top 20. The band toured across the world again, augmented by Blair Cunningham (drums), Martin Ditcham (percussion), Leroy Osbourne (vocals), Gordon Hunte (guitar), James McMillan (trumpet) and Jake Jacas (trombone &amp; vocals). In 1989, Sade Adu was nominated for an American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Female Artist.

===1990s===
Sade&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Love Deluxe&quot;, was released in November 1992. The album peaked at No. 3 on the US Album charts and was certified quadruple-Platinum, and peaked at No. 10 in the UK and was certified Gold by the BPI.

In 1993, the band recorded a cover of the Percy Mayfield song, &quot;Please Send Me Someone to Love&quot;, for the Academy Award-winning film &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, before launching the &quot;Love Deluxe&quot; world tour. Joining the band were Leroy Osbourne (vocals), Gordon Hunte (guitar), Trevor Murrell (drums), Karl Vanden Bossche (percussion), and Rick Braun (trumpet).

The 1994 Grammy for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group was awarded to Sade for &quot;No Ordinary Love&quot;, featured in the 1993 film &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot;. In November the group released its first compilation album, &quot;The Best of Sade&quot;. The album was another Top Ten hit in both the UK and US and was certified Platinum and Quadruple-Platinum respectively. In 1996 Hale, Denman, and Matthewman formed its own band as a side project, Sweetback, and released a self-titled album.

===2000s===
In October 2000, Sade Adu came out of retirement to perform at the prestigious MOBO Awards, her first live performance in several years. The following month, Sade released its fifth studio album, &quot;Lovers Rock&quot;, its first album in eight years. The album peaked at number 18 in the UK (its only studio album not to make the top 10) though was certified Gold by the BPI. It fared better in the US, peaking at number 3. It also won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album in 2002. The band toured the US throughout 2001. The tour resulted in a live album, &quot;Lovers Live&quot;, which was released in the UK and US in February 2002. In 2005 the band contributed the track &quot;Mum&quot; to the &quot;Voices for Darfur&quot; DVD.

===2010s===
In mid-2009, when social media was in its early stages, Sade fans from around the world were excited to hear the news of an up-coming Sade album with a predicted release date of 24 November 2009. This date was posted on an official-looking website (sade2009.com) before Sony Music released any news or marketing for an upcoming album.

Sony denied having any affiliation with the site. Billboard Charts contacted the site&#x27;s owner to confirm the release date and was told the date was official, but soon after, the date was removed.
Die-hard Sade fans got together on the official Sade website forums to investigate this new website and release date, what they uncovered was the registered owner of the site&#x27;s name was Thomas Roman, a web developer, freelance digital marketing and SEO specialist. Roman, a seasoned web developer, utilized the buzz he generated with the release date and got traffic to his site where he cashed in on pay per click advertisements. To date it is not known how he predicted a release date so close to the release of their first single and studio album, &quot;Soldier of Love&quot;, in a decade.

Sade&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;Soldier of Love&quot; was released worldwide on 8 February 2010, the band&#x27;s first album of new material in ten years. Following the release of the &quot;Soldier of Love&quot; single on 8 December 2009, the track debuted at number 11 on the Urban Hot AC chart, making it the highest debut of the decade and the third-highest all-time on the Urban Hot AC chart. &quot;Soldier of Love&quot; debuted at number 5 on the Smooth Jazz airplay chart and became the first-ever vocal to hit number 1 on the Smooth Jazz Top 20 Countdown.

The album peaked at No. 4 in the UK. In the US the album sold 502,000 copies in its first week and topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The album stayed at No. 1 in the US for three weeks. The group released the second single from the album, &quot;Babyfather&quot;, in April 2010, followed by a video in May. On 13 April 2010, the band performed &quot;Babyfather&quot; and &quot;The Sweetest Taboo&quot; on the US TV show &quot;Dancing With The Stars&quot;. In September 2010 the group announced the first dates of its global tour, Sade Live, to begin in April 2011.

In 2011, Sade received its fourth Grammy Award (Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals) for &quot;Soldier of Love&quot;, and released a second greatest hits album, &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot;, which made the UK Top Ten. A new video for the track &quot;Love Is Found&quot; premiered in July 2011.

The band returned in 2018 for the soundtrack to the Disney film &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; with the song &quot;Flower of the Universe&quot; and for the song &quot;The Big Unknown&quot; for the motion picture &quot;Widows&quot;.

On 13 July 2018, Sade bandmate Stuart Matthewman told &quot;Rated R&amp;B&quot; in an interview that the band is in the studio working on its seventh studio album. He said, &quot;We&#x27;re working on a new album. When we&#x27;re happy, then we&#x27;ll let everyone else hear it.&quot;

===2020s===

In September 2020, Sade announced a remastered vinyl set of its six albums. The boxset, titled &quot;This Far&quot;, was released on 9 October 2020. Their engineer and co-producer, Mike Pela, died in 2022. The band reportedly began recording new material for a seventh album in the summer 2022 at the rebuilt Miraval Studios (where they previously recorded &quot;Promise&quot; and &quot;Stronger Than Pride&quot;).

==Legacy==
The band is credited with influencing the musical genre of neo soul and achieving success in the 1980s with songs that featured a sophisti-pop style, incorporating elements of soul, pop, smooth jazz and quiet storm. The band was part of a new wave of British R&amp;B-oriented artists during the late-1980s and early-1990s that also included artists Soul II Soul, Caron Wheeler, The Brand New Heavies, Simply Red, Jamiroquai and Lisa Stansfield. AllMusic&#x27;s Alex Henderson writes that, &quot;Many of the British artists who emerged during that period had a neo-soul outlook and were able to blend influences from different eras&quot;. Following the coining of the term &quot;quiet storm&quot; by Smokey Robinson, Sade was credited for helping give the genre a worldwide audience.

The band&#x27;s work has influenced and been recognized by several musical artists. Rapper Rakim of Eric B. &amp; Rakim stated he grew up listening to Sade&#x27;s music and was influenced by the singer&#x27;s voice and style. Rakim has also referenced its song &quot;Smooth Operator&quot; in his rap song &quot;Paid in Full&quot; (1987). Hip hop group Souls of Mischief stated they grew up listening to Sade&#x27;s music. Hip hop group Tanya Morgan also described Sade as one of its favorite artists.

Frontman Chino Moreno of the alternative metal band Deftones has cited &quot;Love Deluxe&quot; as one of his top 13 favorite albums. In an interview with &quot;The Quietus&quot;, Moreno said, &quot;I&#x27;ve always loved it, it was a big inspiration on me. It&#x27;s sort of classy, another cocktail and cityscape record.&quot; The band also covered the lead single &quot;No Ordinary Love&quot; in collaboration with singer Jonah Matranga for the band&#x27;s 2005 compilation album, &quot;B-Sides &amp; Rarities&quot;.

Singer Keri Hilson said, &quot;My Dad would whistle Sade melodies randomly all the time. As a kid, I used to try to whistle along to &#x27;Cherish the Day&#x27; or &#x27;The Sweetest Taboo.&#x27; He was a real Sade fan and made me one, too!&quot; In reaction to the newly released album &quot;Soldier of Love&quot;, rapper Kanye West wrote, &quot;This is why i still have a blog. To be a part of moments like this ... new Sade ... How much better this ... than everything else?&quot;. Rapper Rick Ross stated in an interview that &quot;People may know my infatuation with Sade. There&#x27;s never been a bad Sade track. I love all different sides.&quot; Other individuals such as Formula One driver Carlos Sainz have quoted Sade&#x27;s songs.

The group were nominated for induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2024.

<doc id="866712" wikidata="Q5121051" url="?curid=866712" title="Omega (photographic brand)">
<text>Omega is the brand name of several medium-format cameras that were initially developed and sold by Simmon Brothers starting from 1954, then licensed to and manufactured by Konica and then Mamiya from 1964 until 1981, when the line was discontinued.

Simmon Brothers originally had used the Omega brand for a line of enlargers, introduced in 1939 and discontinued in 2014. Omega became an independent brand for the enlargers after Simmon Brothers were folded into the Berkey Photo conglomerate in 1961. Omega enlargers can be recognized by their distinctive, slanted enlarger head support.

Under Berkey, Omega also marketed a line of view cameras, the Omega View 45, which were built by Sakai Special Mfg. Co. in Japan as the Toyo-View and rebranded by Berkey.

==Cameras==
===Rangefinders===
Alfred Simmon received a design patent in 1953 for the &quot;Simmon Camera&quot;. The Simmon Brothers, better known at the time for their line of enlargers, built the original Simmon Omega cameras in the United States starting from 1954. These rangefinder cameras used 120 roll film, capturing images with the 6×7 &quot;ideal format&quot; frame size. The Omega 120 camera was equipped with a fixed &quot;Omicron&quot; 90 mm lens designed by Wollensak with four elements; it was designed to facilitate rapid operation as a press camera, using a large focusing knob and combined push/pull film transport lever that also served to cock the leaf shutter for the right hand and a shutter release for the left hand. A flashbulb accessory was available which had a rotary turret accepting six bulbs. Keeping with the rapid operation theme, the turret was mechanically linked to the film transport lever, automatically advancing a fresh bulb to the reflector as the film was advanced.
Simmon Brothers was merged into Berkey Photo in 1961. Shortly thereafter, the design was licensed to Konica, another company marketed in the United States by Berkey, and manufactured in modified form as the Koni-Omega line between 1964 and 1975, which included the Koni-Omega &quot;Rapid&quot; (introduced in 1964 and sold in Japan as the &quot;Konica Press&quot;) and &quot;Rapid M&quot; (1968). Both cameras accepted the same set of &quot;Hexanon&quot;-branded interchangeable lenses, including the standard (&quot;Tessar&quot;-type) 90 mm , wide-angle (&quot;Super-Angulon&quot;-type) 60 mm , and telephoto (&quot;Sonnar&quot;-type) 180 mm . The 60 mm lens was replaced by a reformulated 58 mm lens and a 135 mm portrait lens was added around 1970.

The bulkier &quot;Rapid M&quot; was designed to accept interchangeable film magazines with a dark slide, permitting mid-roll changes and off-camera loading, while the &quot;Rapid&quot; was fitted with a detachable back. Because the &quot;Rapid&quot; did not have a dark slide, it was fitted with a safety blind to allow lens changes without fogging the film; both cameras had provisions to lock out the lens release lever if the dark slide or safety blind was not engaged. The magazine back for the &quot;Rapid M&quot; had two parts: a conventional film transport and rollfilm holder, and a front cover that included a slot for the dark slide.

The last models, branded as Rapid Omega and bearing an all-black finish, were produced by Mamiya in the same factory, including the Rapid Omega &quot;100&quot; and &quot;200&quot; (both introduced in 1975), which were similar to the &quot;Rapid&quot; and &quot;Rapid M&quot;, respectively. Production ceased in 1981. This line shared the same interchangeable lenses with the preceding Koni-Omega line, although they were rebranded as &quot;Super Omegon&quot; rather than &quot;Hexanon&quot;. The magazine back introduced with the &quot;Rapid M&quot; was used for both the &quot;100&quot; and &quot;200&quot;, but on the &quot;100&quot;, the front portion of the magazine was permanently fixed to the body, so it was unable to accommodate mid-roll changes.

A close-up adapter was popular with wedding photographers for portraits. The line also was sold to the United States Army, which designated it &quot;Still Picture Camera, Type KE-58&quot;.

Lenses are fitted with a leaf shutter that supports M- (flashbulb) and X- (electronic flash) synchronization via a PC terminal, up to the minimum shutter speed of  second.

===Twin-lens reflex===
Konica extended its market with another line, the Koni-Omegaflex M in 1968, which was a twin-lens reflex camera that also took 6×7 rectangular pictures on 120 roll film.

The two-piece &quot;Omegaflex&quot; film magazine is identical to the magazine used by the &quot;Rapid M&quot; and &quot;200&quot;; the rear (film transport) piece can be interchanged with the &quot;100&quot; (also sold as the &quot;Konica Press 2&quot; in Japan). The front piece integrates a dark slide and permits mid-roll changes on the &quot;Omegaflex&quot;, &quot;Rapid M&quot;, and &quot;200&quot;. The earlier Koni-Omega &quot;Rapid&quot; (&quot;Konica Press&quot; in Japan) film back is not compatible with the Koni/Rapid Omega film magazine system, and does not permit mid-roll changes.

Although the lenses for the &quot;Omegaflex&quot; shared the same design as their counterparts for the &quot;Koni-Omega&quot;, the &quot;Hexanon&quot; lenses for &quot;Omegaflex&quot; were packaged as a twin-lens unit and were not interchangeable with those from the Omega line. Likewise, most other accessories were not interchangeable with those from the Omega line.

===View camera===
Under Berkey, view cameras were sold in the United States as the Omega View 45. The cameras were built by Sakai Special Camera Mfg. Co. in Japan and marketed elsewhere as the &quot;Toyo-View&quot;; Sakai also built a field camera, which was sold as the &quot;Toyo-Field&quot;. By 1985, &quot;Omega&quot;-branded view cameras were being marketed by Berkey alongside &quot;Toyo&quot;-branded view and field cameras.

Distribution of the Toyo line in the United States was acquired by Mamiya America Corporation after Berkey went bankrupt; Sakai stopped manufacturing cameras in 2002, but , the Toyo-Field 45AX camera is still available.

==Enlargers==

The first Omega-branded enlarger sold by Simmon Brothers was the &quot;Omega B&quot;, introduced in 1937. Eventually, a complete line of enlargers and darkroom instruments were produced. The letter designation in the enlarger model number provided the maximum film size that was accepted:
* A = 35 mm film
* B = 6×6 (2×2 in.)
* C = 3×3 in.
* D = 4×5 in.
* E = 5×7 in.
* F = 8×10 in.

After the eponymous Simmon brothers retired in the early 1960s, the company was folded into Berkey Photo by 1964 as the Simmon-Omega division. Berkey went bankrupt in the late 1980s and Omega was purchased by RT Corporation and rebranded to RT/Omega (1988), then Omega/Arkay (after acquiring Arkay, 1990), Omega/Satter (after acquiring Satter, 1995), and finally Omega/Brandess (2010). No new Omega enlargers were developed after 1979, and the company quietly discontinued enlarger production in 2014.

<doc id="866714" wikidata="Q420008" url="?curid=866714" title="Candido Amantini">
<text>Candido Amantini, CP, (January 31, 1914 – September 22, 1992), was an Italian Passionist priest. For 36 years Amantini was the exorcist of the Diocese of Rome, stationed at the Pontifical Sanctuary of the Holy Stairs. He also taught Sacred Scripture and Moral Theology and wrote a book entitled &quot;Il Mistero di Maria&quot;, about the Virgin Mary.

== Personal life ==
Candido Amantini was born &quot;Eraldo Ulisse Mauro Amantini&quot; in Bagnolo di Santa Fiora, Province of Grosseto, Tuscany, the second of four children born to Giovanni Battista Amantini and Diolinda Fratini Amantini. He was baptized on February 7, 1914. 

At age 12, he entered the Passionist Seminary in Rome (Nettuno) on October 26, 1926. At the age of 15, on October 9, 1929, he entered the novitiate of the Passionists at the Retreat of St Joseph on Mount Argentario. On October 23, he received the religious habit and was given the name &quot;Candido of the Immaculate&quot;. On October 24, 1930, he made his temporary vows. Amantini was transferred to Tavernuzze, near Florence, where he completed Lyceum in 1936. Then he went to Vinchiana, to complete his studies in philosophy and theology.

On January 31, 1936, Amantini made his perpetual vows. Also in 1936, he was transferred to the Sanctuary of the Holy Staircase in Rome, to study for his licentiate in theology at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot;.

After a long illness, Amantini died at the night on the feast of Saint Candido, his patron. Amantini was buried in Rome at the Verano Cemetery. The Roman Catholic Church has named him a Servant of God. His remains were transferred to the Church of the Holy Staircase on March 21, 2012.

<text>The Fort Randall Military Post was established in 1856 to help keep peace on the frontier. It was located on the south side of the Missouri River in South Dakota, just below the present site of the Fort Randall Dam.

==History==
The site for the fort was selected in 1856 by General William S. Harney. The fort served as a strategic site on the river to defend two lines of transportation; it operated for 36 years. It was named for Colonel Daniel Randall, a career Army officer who also served as Deputy Paymaster General of the Army

Its strategic location along the Missouri River made it a key fort in two lines of western frontier defense. It was the last link in a chain of forts protecting the overland route along the Platte River. It was also the first fort in a chain of forts on the upper Missouri River. The most important mission assigned to the soldiers of Fort Randall was to mount expeditions to try to control the many Indian tribes on the Great Plains, primarily the Teton Sioux (Lakota people).

After serving as an important base in the Indian Wars, Fort Randall closed in 1892.

Fort Randall is located in Gregory County, South Dakota at 43° 01&#x27; north latitude, 98° 37&#x27; west longitude (43.0244, -98.6242).

==Site today==
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers-Fort Randall Dam Project maintains the site which is open to the public. The fort&#x27;s ruins are open for display with interpretive signage. In 2003, the Corps erected a stabilizing structure to help preserve the remains of the historic chapel.

<text>Nashia is a genus of flowering plant in the vervain family, Verbenaceae.

Until recently, there were 7 known species to exist within the genus &quot;Nashia&quot;. However, the seven species placed in the genus &quot;Nashia&quot; were revised, based on the near totality of the (scant) material found in the world&#x27;s herbaria. A morphological analysis of, in particular, the calyx and fruit reveals the heterogeneity of the genus. As a result, &quot;Nashia&quot; was reduced to its single original species, &quot;N. inaquensis&quot;, described from Great Inagua, Bahamas (where it&#x27;s considered to have been introduced), and recently found in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands (St. Croix). &quot;N. Spinifera&quot;, of Hispaniola, was placed in the genus &quot;Isidroa&quot;, a monotypic new genus. The five Cuban endemics, plus two newly described here, make up the new genus &quot;Diphyllocalyx&quot;, formerly &quot;Lippia sect. Diphllocalyx&quot; of Grisebach. 

Species include:

*&quot;Nashia armata&quot;

<doc id="866720" wikidata="Q1950460" url="?curid=866720" title="Mount Blue Sky">
<text>Mount Blue Sky (formerly Mount Evans) is the highest peak in the Mount Evans Wilderness in the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains of North America. The prominent fourteener is located southwest by south (bearing 214°) of Idaho Springs in Clear Creek County, Colorado, United States, on the drainage divide between Clear Creek in Arapaho National Forest and the North Fork South Platte River in Pike National Forest.

The peak is one of the characteristic Front Range peaks, dominating the western skyline of the Great Plains along with Pikes Peak, Longs Peak, and nearby Mount Bierstadt. Mount Blue Sky can be seen from over to the east, and many miles in other directions. Mount Blue Sky dominates the Denver metropolitan area skyline, rising over above the area. Mount Blue Sky can be seen from points south of Castle Rock ( south), as far north as Fort Collins ( north), and from areas near Limon ( east).

The mountain was previously named for the second governor of the Territory of Colorado, John Evans. However, due to Evans&#x27;s involvement in the 1864 Sand Creek Massacre, there were years of discussion over renaming Mount Evans. On September 15, 2023, the United States Board on Geographic Names officially changed the mountain&#x27;s name to Mount Blue Sky.

== Geography ==
Mount Blue Sky is the highest peak in a massif. The peak is west of Denver as the crow flies and approximately by road via Idaho Springs. Other peaks in the massif are:
* Mount Spalding (), northwest
* Gray Wolf Mountain (), north-northwest
* The Sawtooth (), west
* Mount Bierstadt (), west-southwest
* Mount Warren (), north-northeast
* Rogers Peak (), northeast.
* Mount Goliath (), northeast,
* Epaulet Mountain (), southeast,
* Rosalie Peak (), southeast,

At least 7 deep glacial cirques cut into the massif. The cirques around Mount Blue Sky are the deepest cirques in the Colorado Rockies. The bottoms of many of these contain tarns, the most notable being:
* Summit Lake at the head of Bear Creek, north
* the Chicago Lakes at the head of Chicago Creek, north
* Abyss Lake at the head of Lake Fork, west-southwest

The Mount Blue Sky Scenic Byway consists of State Highway 103 from Idaho Springs, Colorado on I-70 about to Echo Lake, and Colorado 5 from Echo Lake , ending at a parking area and turnaround just below the summit. The latter has long been the highest paved road in North America (5th highest in the world) and is only open in the summer. Colorado 103 continues east from Echo Lake to Mestaa&#x27;ėhehe Pass, from which it connects, via Clear Creek County Road 103 and Jefferson County Road 66, to Bergen Park from which Colorado 74 leads to Evergreen Colorado.

The Guanella Pass Scenic Byway passes within west of Mount Blue Sky, linking Georgetown and I-70 with Grant and US 285, to the south.

A marked hiking trail roughly parallels the highway from Echo Lake to the summit and is rated class 2. A class 3 side route of Mount Bierstadt climbs to the northeastern peak of The Sawtooth, from which an easier ridge leads to the summit of Mount Blue Sky.

Most of the Evans massif is now part of the Mount Evans Wilderness area in Arapaho National Forest and Pike National Forest. The exception is a narrow corridor along the highway from Echo Lake that is excluded from the wilderness. Summit Lake Park and Echo Lake Park are part of the historic Denver Mountain Parks system.

== History ==

At least 48 different tribes have ancestral ties to the area around the mountain.

Albert Bierstadt and his guide, William Newton Byers, approached the mountain along Chicago Creek from Idaho Springs in 1863. Bierstadt called it Mount Rosalie, initially naming the mountain after his wife-to-be Rosalie Osborne, spending several days painting sketches of the mountain from the Chicago Lakes before climbing to Summit Lake and onward to the summit. Bierstadt&#x27;s sketch, &quot;Mountain Lake&quot;, accurately portrays the view of Mount Spalding over the Chicago Lakes. His painting &quot;A Storm in the Rocky Mountains, Mt. Rosalie&quot;, is based on that and other sketches.

William Henry Jackson, attached to the Hayden Survey, visited the Chicago Lakes in 1873, where he took numerous photographs; the summit of the mountain is barely visible in several of these, peeking over the col between upper Chicago Lake and Summit Lake. The Hayden survey reported that Mount Rosalie was above sea level, measured by triangulation.
The history of the Mount Blue Sky Scenic Byway is part of a larger story of the Denver Mountain Parks system. The City and County of Denver initiated the construction of a series of automobile &quot;scenic loops&quot; to allow Denverites to explore the mountains. One road circuit, Circle G, was to traverse the ridge to Mestaa&#x27;ėhehe Pass on to Echo Lake, culminate in a climb up Mount Blue Sky, and loop down to Idaho Springs. In order to achieve this goal, Denver Mountain Parks acquired a series of land parcels, including the acquisition of Bergen Park in 1915. The Bear Creek segment from the Genesee saddle to Bergen Park was finished in 1915, while the Denver Mountain Parks committee worked to make Mount Evans a National Park, going as far as getting support in Congress for the construction of a &quot;cement road&quot; to the mountain. The first mile was paid for by Denver with the understanding that the State Highway Commission would do the rest. The Denver Mountain Parks committee was not without disagreement and setbacks, however. $30,000 was acquired early in 1916 to construct the Bergen Park to Mestaa&#x27;ėhehe Pass segment and all seemed to be flowing towards the goal of Mount Evans when the mayor of Denver, Robert W. Speer, appointed W.F.R. Mills as the Commissioner of Improvements, who summarily stopped the construction of the road, stating that &quot;It is a road that starts nowhere, ends nowhere, and never gets there&quot;. After studying the issue, Mills later recanted and became a supporter of the park system, and the segment between Bergen Park and Mestaa&#x27;ėhehe Pass was constructed beginning in the spring of 1918. The next act was to get Mount Evans classified as a National Park, but 1916 was a tumultuous time between the National Park system and the U.S. Forest Service, who currently held claim to the mountain. Already in bitter struggle to prevent the formation of a National Park Service, Chief Forester Graves adamantly blocked the relinquishment of this area of National Forest, in exchange for Forest Service development of the area including the immediate construction of a road between Mestaa&#x27;ėhehe Pass and Echo Lake (Colorado). This joint exercise between the City and County of Denver, the U.S. Congress, the State Highway System, and now the Forest Service would be completed with help of a newly formed Federal Agency, the Bureau of Public Roads. In 1918, the Bureau of Public Roads provided the plan to construct of road from Soda Pass (later called Squaw Pass and now called Mestaa&#x27;ėhehe Pass) to Echo Lake beginning in 1919. By 1920, the road only went as far as Chief Mountain. By October 1, 1921, the Bureau of Public Roads had completed construction to Echo Lake. The first survey for the road from Echo Lake to the peak of Mount Blue Sky was made in 1923, finishing the layout by January 1924 despite a flu outbreak in the camp, damaging windstorms, and nearly insurmountable environmental hardships. Battling the unusual problems that come with high-altitude construction (steam shovels performing only half as effectively at high altitude, difficulty of hauling coal and water, horse suicide, etc.) the last were finally built by hand, being completed in 1930.

The ruins of the Crest House (1941–1942) sit nearby. Once containing both a restaurant and a gift shop, it burned down on September 1, 1979, and was not rebuilt, remaining as a place of contemplation today. The rock foundation and walls remain as a windbreak for mountain travelers, and the viewing platform is one of Colorado&#x27;s premier scenic overlooks.

The mountain, along with Echo Lake, was designated as a historic site by the American Physical Society in 2017, commemorating the many cosmic-ray physics experiments conducted on the mountain between 1935 and 1960.

Mount Blue Sky also hosts the annual Mt. Evans Hill Climb, a bicycle race with a total of of climbing.

== Environment ==

=== Climate ===

The atmospheric pressure on the summit is around 460 Torr (610 mbar), while a standard atmosphere (sea level) is 760 Torr (1013 mbar). At this pressure, many people suffer from altitude sickness.

The climate on the summit of Mount Blue Sky can be extreme. The mean annual temperature on the summit is . Temperatures often fall below , and occasionally fall as low as . The highest temperature recorded on the summit was , and below freezing temperatures may occur at any time of year. The maximum wind speed measured was , the average is from . When the wind speed is over , the wind is almost always from the west-southwest.
===2012 tornado===
At 2:51 pm on July 28, 2012, a weak, short-lived tornado touched down northeast of Mount Blue Sky&#x27;s summit at an elevation estimated by the National Weather Service of above sea level. The tornado was the second highest recorded in the United States but did not cause any damage because it was above tree line.

===Flora===
The slopes of Mount Blue Sky include several distinct environments. Below Echo Lake, the montane forest is dominated by lodgepole pine (&quot;Pinus contorta&quot;) and in some areas, blue spruce (&quot;Picea pungens&quot;), with patches of quaking aspen. Echo Lake is high enough to be in the subalpine forest, where Engelmann spruce (&quot;Picea engelmannii&quot;), subalpine fir (&quot;Abies lasiocarpa&quot;) and bristlecone pine (&quot;Pinus aristata&quot;) dominate.

At tree line, the trees are reduced to krummholz, battered and twisted by wind and frost. The bristlecone pine grove on the east slope of Mount Goliath () contains at least one tree that sprouted in the year 403 AD. For many years, these were the oldest known trees in Colorado, but in 1992, trees dating to 442 BC were found in the southern Front Range and South Park. The Mount Goliath Natural Area, jointly managed by the United States Forest Service and the Denver Botanic Gardens protects this grove of old trees.

Above tree line, the landscape is mostly alpine tundra. In the lower tundra, dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) is common, along with a wide variety of flowering plants such as Rocky Mountain Columbine (Aquilegia saximontana) and various species of dwarf alpine sunflowers. Toward the summit, the vegetation shrinks until the largest plants are little more than compact green cushions in the cracks between the rocks. Here, Alpine Forget-me-not (Myosotis alpestris) plants with hundreds of blossoms occupy areas of only a few square centimeters and rise only centimeters above the soil surface.

The tundra around Summit Lake, particularly in Summit Lake Flats, the gently sloping area east of the lake, is frequently described as the southernmost area of arctic tundra in the world because it is water saturated and underlain by an extensive area of permafrost.

===Fauna===
The top predators found in the area are mountain lions (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;), anywhere on the mountain, and black bears (&quot;Ursus americanus&quot;), generally below tree line. These prey on bighorn sheep (&quot;Ovis canadensis&quot;) and mountain goats (&quot;Oreamnos americanus&quot;), as well as one of the highest densities of yellow-bellied marmot (&quot;Marmota flaviventris&quot;) in the region. Above tree-line, pikas (&quot;Ochotona princeps&quot;) are common. Below tree line, elk (&quot;Cervus canadensis&quot;) and mule deer (&quot;Odocoileus hemionus&quot;) are common.

Among birds, the white-tailed ptarmigan (&quot;Lagopus leucurus&quot;) are present on the mountain, but so well camouflaged that they are difficult to see even when almost underfoot. Brown-capped rosy finches (&quot;Leucosticte australis&quot;), pipits and rock wrens (&quot;Salpinctes obsoletus&quot;) are also seen near the summit.

== Geology ==
Mount Blue Sky was carved from the rock of the Mount Evans Batholith, formed by an intrusion of magma into the Earth&#x27;s crust about 1.4 billion years ago (in the Mesoproterozoic Era of the Precambrian Eon). Much of the rock is granodiorite, a close relative of granite, modified by later intrusions of quartz and pegmatite.

The body of this batholith has been deeply cut by glacial cirques and canyons. Each of the nearby lakes, Summit Lake, the Chicago Lakes, Lincoln Lake and Abyss Lake are tarns located in cirques or glacial canyons surrounding Mount Blue Sky. Echo Lake was dammed by a lateral moraine of the glacier that formed Chicago Canyon. Prior to glaciation, Mount Blue Sky, Long&#x27;s Peak and several other summits were monadnocks in an upland Peneplain. Glaciation has not entirely destroyed the ancient Flattop Peneplain, named for Flattop Mountain in Grand County. The peaks of these mountains are all remnant features of this peneplain.

== Scientific research ==

The easy access to the summit provided by the Mount Blue Sky Highway has made it a popular location for scientific research. Arthur H. Compton conducted pioneering research on cosmic rays on the mountain in 1931, shortly after the road to the summit was completed. The University of Denver built a pair of A-frame buildings on the summit to house cosmic-ray researchers. By the 1950s, Mount Blue Sky, the Aiguille du Midi, the Pic du Midi and the Jungfrau were considered the premier locations for high-altitude physics experiments.

The first accurate measurement of the lifetime of the muon (originally called the &quot;mesotron&quot;) by Bruno Rossi in 1939, used sites at Mount Blue Sky, Echo Lake, Denver and Chicago. This experiment verified the reality of time dilation, one of the key predictions of Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity.

In the summer of 1948, MIT, Cornell, Princeton, NYU, Michigan, Chicago, Denver conducted an intensive experimental program on the mountain and at Echo Lake. Bruno Rossi and Giuseppe Cocconi were among those involved.

In 1965, the Midwestern Universities Research Association began doing high-energy physics experiments on the summit using cosmic rays to explore energies above those accessible with the most powerful particle accelerators of the day. The first experiments were conducted in a semi-trailer, and then in 1966, a temporary laboratory building was erected near the summit. This building was moved to Echo Lake that fall, where research continued until 1972.

The University of Denver erected the Ritchey–Chrétien telescope in its summit laboratory in 1972. This was used to observe comets Kohoutek and Halley in 1972 and 1986. In 1996, the university finished construction on the Meyer–Womble Observatory, near the site of the A-frame laboratory buildings. At this was, from 1972 to 1999, the world&#x27;s highest optical observatory. It is now the third-highest.

Mount Blue Sky has also been the site of significant research in the life sciences. In 1940, for example, it was the site of a significant study of high-altitude physiology. Pioneering studies on the effects of altitude training on track athletes were conducted on Mount Blue Sky in 1966.

Mount Evans Road is also noteworthy as a high-altitude vehicle testing venue for auto manufacturers. With full visibility on a public road, most manufacturers&#x27; road test teams tend to conceal their designs with various creative styles of camouflage, e.g. wild zebra paint motif, possibly paired with other temporary body coverings.

== Name ==
Mount Evans was named after the second territorial Governor of Colorado, John Evans. Commissions at Northwestern University and the University of Denver – both universities that were established by Evans himself – determined that Evans was among those responsible for the 1864 Sand Creek Massacre, which resulted in the death of between 150 and 500 Cheyenne and Arapaho people, most of whom were elderly, women, and children. Attempts were made to change the name of the mountain due to the history and actions of Governor Evans. In 2020, 43rd Colorado Governor Jared Polis established The Colorado Geographic Naming Advisory Board, which included Mount Evans for a possible renaming. The new name was proposed by the Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes. According to the proposal, the name &quot;signifies the Arapaho as they were known as the Blue Sky People and the Cheyenne who have an annual ceremony of renewal of life called Blue Sky&quot;. In March 2022, Clear Creek County approved a proposal to rename the peak to Mount Blue Sky, pending state and federal review. Five other names were also submitted: Mount Rosalie, Mount Soule (after Silas Soule), Mount Sisty, Mount Evans (after Anne Evans), and Mount Cheyenne Arapaho. On November 17, 2022, the Colorado Geographic Naming Advisory recommended unanimously that the name be changed to Mount Blue Sky.

On March 3, 2023, Governor Jared Polis formally asked the United States Board on Geographic Names to rename the mountain to Mount Blue Sky. The board delayed any decision after the Northern Cheyenne Tribe requested a consultation, with tribal administrator William F. Walks Along saying the proposed name &quot;conflicted with his nation’s use of the term in their confidential sacred ceremonies.&quot; On September 15, 2023, the BGN voted to change the name, becoming effective immediately. Despite the peak&#x27;s name change, the efforts to make a corresponding name change for the Mount Evans Wilderness Area still require congressional approval.

On October 16, 2023, Joe Neguse (Colorado-2 Democrat) introduced H.R. 5962 to the 118th Congress, titled &quot;To redesignate the Mount Evans Wilderness as the &#x27;Mount Blue Sky Wilderness&#x27;, and for other purposes&quot;.

<doc id="866724" wikidata="Q7161799" url="?curid=866724" title="Pelvic floor dysfunction">
<text>Pelvic floor dysfunction is a term used for a variety of disorders that occur when pelvic floor muscles and ligaments are impaired. The condition affects up to 50 percent of women who have given birth. Although this condition predominantly affects women, up to 16 percent of men are affected as well. Symptoms can include pelvic pain, pressure, pain during sex, urinary incontinence (UI), overactive bladder, bowel incontinence, incomplete emptying of feces, constipation, myofascial pelvic pain and pelvic organ prolapse. When pelvic organ prolapse occurs, there may be visible organ protrusion or a lump felt in the vagina or anus. Research carried out in the UK has shown that symptoms can restrict everyday life for women. However, many people found it difficult to talk about it and to seek care, as they experienced embarrassment and stigma. 

Common treatments for pelvic floor dysfunction are surgery, medication, physical therapy and lifestyle modifications.

The term &quot;pelvic floor dysfunction&quot; has been criticized since it does not represent a particular pelvic floor disorder. It has therefore been recommended that the term not be used in medical literature without additional clarification.

==Epidemiology==
Pelvic floor dysfunction is defined as a herniation of the pelvic organs through the pelvic organ walls and pelvic floor. The condition is widespread, affecting up to 50 percent of women at some point in their lifetime. About 11 percent of women will undergo surgery for urinary incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse by age 80. Women who experience pelvic floor dysfunction are more likely to report issues with arousal combined with dyspareunia. For women, there is a 20.5% risk for having a surgical intervention related to stress urinary incontinence. The literature suggests that white women are at increased risk for stress urinary incontinence.

Though pelvic floor dysfunction is thought to more commonly affect women, 16% of men have been identified with pelvic floor dysfunction. Pelvic floor dysfunction and its multiple consequences, including urinary incontinence, is a concerning health issue becoming more evident as the population of advancing age individuals rises.

==Causes==
Mechanistically, the causes of pelvic floor dysfunction are two-fold: widening of the pelvic floor hiatus and descent of pelvic floor below the pubococcygeal line, with specific organ prolapse, graded relative to the hiatus. People with an inherited deficiency in their collagen type may be more likely to develop pelvic floor dysfunction. Additionally, people with congenitally weak connective tissue and fascia are at an increased risk for stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. Recent literature demonstrates that defects in endopelvic fascia and compromised levator ani muscle function have been categorized as important etiologic factors in the development of pelvic floor dysfunction. Some circumstances are clearly associated with collagen defects. These include vaginally delivering a child, being post-menopausal, and being of advanced age.

Some lifestyle behaviors can lead to pelvic floor dysfunction. This includes avoiding urinating or bowel movements, obesity, use of muscle relaxants or narcotics, and use of antihistamines or anticholinergics. Using muscle relaxants or narcotics can lead to increased smooth and skeletal muscle relaxation, potentially related to urinary incontinence. Antihistamines and anticholinergics may have additive effects that lead to urinary hesitancy and retention, ultimately leading to pelvic floor dysfunction. Urinary incontinence can also affect athletes, especially those in sports that require high impact such as jumping. Gymnasts, for example, report a high prevalence of urinary incontinence. Studies show that athletes in sports requiring high spinal stability may also have this condition, as the activation of abdominal wall muscles can cause urinary alterations during activities. In some cases, sexual abuse can also be associated with chronic pelvic pain and pelvic floor dysfunction.

Pelvic floor dysfunction can result after pelvic radiation, as well as other treatments for gynecological cancers.

==Diagnosis==

Pelvic floor dysfunction can be assessed with a strong clinical history and physical exam, though imaging is often needed for diagnosis. As part of the clinical history, a healthcare provider may ask about obstetric history, including how many pregnancies and deliveries, what mode of delivery and if there were any complications during delivery. Providers will also ask about presence and severity of symptoms such as pelvic pain or pressure, problems with urination or defecation, painful sex, or sexual dysfunction. The physical exam may include both examination with a speculum to visualize the cervix and check for inflammation, as well as manual examination with the provider&#x27;s fingers to assess for pain and strength of pelvic floor muscle contraction.

Imaging provides a more complete picture of the type and severity of pelvic floor dysfunction than history and physical exam alone. Historically, fluoroscopy with defecography and cystography were used. More recently, MRI has been used to complement and sometimes replace fluoroscopic assessment of the disorder. This technique is less invasive, and allows for less radiation exposure and increased patient comfort, though an enema is required the evening before the procedure. Both fluoroscopy and MRI assess the pelvic floor at rest and during maximum strain using coronal and sagittal views.

When grading individual organ prolapse for severity, the rectum, bladder and uterus are individually assessed. Prolapse of the rectum is referred to as a rectocele, bladder prolapse through the anterior vaginal wall is called a cystocele, and prolapse of the small bowel is an enterocele. To assess the degree of dysfunction, three measurements are taken into account. First, an anatomic landmark known as the pubococcygeal line must be determined, which is a straight line connecting the inferior margin of the pubic symphysis at the midline with the junction of the first and second coccygeal elements on a sagittal image. After this, the location of the puborectalis muscle sling is assessed, and a perpendicular line between the pubococcygeal line and muscle sling is drawn. This line provides a reference point for the measurement of &quot;pelvic floor descent.&quot; Descent greater than 2 cm below this line is considered mild and descent greater than 6 cm is considered severe. Lastly, a line from the pubic symphysis to the puborectalis muscle sling is drawn, which is a measurement of the pelvic floor hiatus. Measurements greater than 6 cm are considered mild, and greater than 10 cm severe. The degree of organ prolapse is assessed relative to the hiatus.

The grading for &quot;organ prolapse&quot; relative to the hiatus is more strict. Any descent below the hiatus is considered abnormal, and descent greater than 4 cm is considered severe.

Ultrasound can also be used to diagnose pelvic floor dysfunction. Transabdominal, transvaginal, transperineal and endoanal ultrasound (EUS) are important tools for diagnosing pelvic floor dysfunction. For EUS, an ultrasound probe is inserted into the anal canal and can be used to visualize and assess the anatomy and function the pelvic floor. Ultrasound is easily accessible and noninvasive; however, it may compress certain structures, does not produce high-quality images and cannot be used to visualize the entire pelvic floor.

==Treatment==
There are several approaches to treatment of pelvic floor dysfunction, and often several approaches are used in combination.

=== Physical therapy ===
Pelvic floor muscle (PFM) training is vital for treating different types of pelvic floor dysfunction. Two common problems are uterine prolapse and urinary incontinence both of which stem from muscle weakness. Pelvic floor muscle therapy is the first line of treatment for urinary incontinence and thus should be considered before more invasive procedures such as surgery. Being able to control the pelvic floor muscles is vital for a well functioning pelvic floor. Without the ability to control the pelvic floor muscles, pelvic floor training cannot be done successfully. Pelvic floor muscle therapy strengthens the muscles of the pelvic floor through repeated contractions of varying strength. Through vaginal palpation exams and the use of biofeedback, the tightening, lifting, and squeezing actions of these muscles can be determined. Biofeedback can be used to treat urinary incontinence as it records contractions of the pelvic floor muscles and can help patients become aware of the use of their muscles. PFM training can also increase female sexual satisfaction by improving sexual function and the ability to orgasm. In men, PFM exercises can also help maintain a strong erection.

In addition, abdominal muscle training has been shown to improve pelvic floor muscle function. By increasing abdominal muscle strength and control, a person may have an easier time activating the pelvic floor muscles in sync with the abdominal muscles. Many physiotherapists are specially trained to address the muscle weaknesses associated with pelvic floor dysfunction and can effectively treat pelvic floor dysfunction through strengthening exercises. Overall, physical therapy can significantly improve the quality of life of those with pelvic floor dysfunction by relieving symptoms.

=== Medication ===
Overactive bladder can be treated with medications, including those in the class of antimuscarinics and beta 3 agonists. Antimuscarinics are the most commonly used, however, beta 3 agonists can be used for those that are unable to take antimuscarinics due to side effects or other reasons.

=== Devices ===
A pessary is a plastic or silicone device that may be used for women with pelvic organ prolapse. Vaginal pessaries can immediately relieve prolapse and prolapse-related symptoms. This treatment is useful for individuals who do not want to have surgery or are unable to have surgery due to the risk of the procedure. Some pessaries have a knob that can also treat urinary incontinence. To be effective, pessaries must be fitted by a medical provider and the largest device that fits comfortably should be used.

Other devices train the pelvic floor via internal exercises with biofeedback mechanisms.

=== Lifestyle modifications ===
Treatment for pelvic floor dysfunction, especially the symptom of urinary incontinence, is essential, but so is prevention. Patients are usually encouraged to change their lifestyles; interventions such as reducing body weight, limiting the use of stimulants, quitting smoking, limiting strenuous efforts, preventing constipation and increasing physical activity can help prevent pelvic floor dysfunction. For those that already have diagnosed pelvic floor dysfunction, symptoms can be eased by physical activity, especially abdominal exercises and pelvic floor exercises (Kegels) that strengthen the pelvic floor. Symptoms of urinary incontinence can also be reduced by making dietary changes such as limiting intake of acidic and spicy foods, alcohol and caffeine.

=== Surgery ===
Surgery is performed when desired by the patient or when less invasive treatments, such as lifestyle modification and physical therapy, are not effective. There are various procedures used to address prolapse. Cystoceles are treated with a surgical procedure known as a Burch colposuspension, with the goal of suspending the prolapsed urethra so that the urethrovesical junction and proximal urethra are replaced in the pelvic cavity. Uterine prolapse is treated with hysterectomy and uterosacral suspension. With enteroceles, the prolapsed small bowel is elevated into the pelvis cavity and the rectovaginal fascia is reapproximated. Rectoceles, in which the anterior wall of the rectum protrudes into the posterior wall of the vagina, require posterior colporrhaphy, also known as repair of the vaginal wall. Though pelvic floor dysfunction is more common in women, there are also proven methods to assist men. In severe cases of pelvic floor dysfunction causing urinary incontinence, a radical prostatectomy followed by postoperative pelvic floor muscle therapy is an option.

<text>Louis James Lipton (September 19, 1926 – March 2, 2020) was an American writer, actor, talk show host, and dean emeritus of the Actors Studio Drama School at Pace University in New York City. He was the executive producer, writer, and host of the Bravo cable television series &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;, which debuted in 1994. He retired from the show in 2018.

==Early life==
Louis James Lipton was born on September 19, 1926, in Detroit, Michigan, the only child of Betty (née Weinberg), a teacher and librarian, and Lawrence Lipton, a journalist and beat poet. Known for writing the Beat Generation chronicle &quot;The Holy Barbarians&quot;, Lawrence was a graphic designer, a columnist for the &quot;Jewish Daily Forward&quot;, and a publicity director for a movie theater. Lawrence was a Polish Jewish emigrant (from Łódź), whose surname was originally Lipschitz. Betty&#x27;s parents were Russian Jews. His parents divorced when Lipton was six, and his father abandoned the family.

Lipton&#x27;s family struggled financially, and he started to work when he was 13 years old. He worked in high school as a newspaper copy boy for the &quot;Detroit Times&quot; and as an actor in the Catholic Theater of Detroit and in radio. Lipton had initially intended to become an attorney. After graduating from Central High School in Detroit, he attended Wayne State University for one year in the mid-1940s and enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces. In an interview with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Lipton talked about his time in Paris in the 1950s, when he worked for about a year as a pimp. On the &quot;Today&quot; show, Lipton clarified that he had worked as a beneficent &quot;maque&quot; in the regulated prostitution business.

==Career==
Shortly after graduating high school, Lipton portrayed Dan Reid, the Lone Ranger&#x27;s nephew, on WXYZ Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;. He initially studied to be a lawyer in New York City, and turned to acting to finance his education. From 1952 to 1962, Lipton started in &quot;The Guiding Light&quot;, playing the role of Dr. Dick Grant and eventually becoming head writer. He wrote for several soap operas: &quot;Another World&quot;, &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, &quot;The Best of Everything&quot;, &quot;Return to Peyton Place&quot; and &quot;Capitol&quot;. Lipton studied for two and half years with Stella Adler, four years with Harold Clurman, and two years with Robert Lewis. He also started studying voice and dance (including modern dance and classical ballet), and choreographed a ballet for the American Ballet Theatre.

In 1951, he appeared in the Broadway play &quot;The Autumn Garden&quot; by Lillian Hellman. He portrayed a shipping clerk turned gang member in Joseph Strick&#x27;s 1953 film, &quot;The Big Break&quot;, a crime drama. 

He wrote the book and lyrics for the 1962 Broadway musical &quot;Nowhere To Go But Up&quot;. The show had its tryout in Philadelphia at the Shubert Theatre opening October 6, 1962, to mixed notices. The show opened in New York on November 10, 1962, at the Winter Garden, to generally unfavorable reviews. John Chapman wrote in the NY Daily News that the show “is delicious bathtub gin. . . . This is a happy show.” But Howard Taubman said in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Don&#x27;t let anyone tell you that &#x27;Nowhere to Go but Up&#x27; is a little horror. Because it&#x27;s a big one.&quot; As a result, Kermit Bloomgarden, the producer, decided to close the show on November 17, 1962, after 9 performances. A group of 234 small investors tried to keep the show from closing by parading in front of the theater and sought an injunction, but the NY Supreme Court ruled in favor of the producer.

He was the librettist and lyricist for the short-lived 1967 Broadway musical &quot;Sherry!&quot;, based on the Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman play &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot;, with music by his childhood friend Laurence Rosenthal. The score and orchestrations were lost for more than 30 years, and the original cast was never recorded. In 2003, a studio cast recording (with Nathan Lane, Bernadette Peters, Carol Burnett, Tommy Tune, Mike Myers and others) renewed interest in the show.

His book, &quot;An Exaltation of Larks&quot;, was first published in 1968, and has been in-print and revised several times since then, including a 1993 Penguin Books edition. The book is a collection of &quot;terms of venery&quot;, both real and created by Lipton himself. The dust jacket biography for the first edition of &quot;Exaltation&quot; said his activities included fencing, swimming, and equestrian pursuits and that he had written two Broadway productions.

In 1981, Lipton published his novel, &quot;Mirrors&quot;, about dancers&#x27; lives. He later wrote and produced it as a made-for-television movie. For the genre of television, Lipton produced some two dozen specials including: twelve Bob Hope Birthday Specials; &quot;The Road to China&quot;, an NBC entertainment special produced in China; and the first televised presidential inaugural gala (for Jimmy Carter).

In 2004, 2005, 2013, and 2019, Lipton appeared on several episodes of &quot;Arrested Development&quot; as Warden Stefan Gentles. In 2008, he provided the voice for the Director in the Disney animation film &quot;Bolt&quot;. He played &quot;himself&quot; as Brain Wash, interviewer of the monster Eva&#x27;s acting teacher in the Paris-Vietnam animated film &quot;Igor&quot;. Lipton also appears twice in the same episode of &quot;Family Guy&quot; in cutaways where he simply says &quot;Improv!&quot; both times.

===&quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;===

In the early 1990s, Lipton was inspired by Bernard Pivot and sought to create a three-year educational program for actors that would be a distillation of what he had learned in the 12 years of his own intensive studies. In 1994, he arranged for the Actors Studio—the home base of &quot;method acting&quot; in the United States—to join with New York City&#x27;s New School University and form the Actors Studio Drama School, a formal degree-granting program at the graduate level. After ending its contract with the New School, the Actors Studio established the Actors Studio Drama School at Pace University in 2006.

Lipton created a project within the Actors Studio Drama School: a non-credit class called &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot; (1994), where successful and accomplished actors, directors and writers would be interviewed and would answer questions from acting students. These sessions were also taped, edited, and broadcast on television for the general public to see. The episodes were viewed in 89 million homes throughout 125 countries. Lipton hosted the show and conducted the main interview. In a 2008 interview, when asked if he had anticipated the show&#x27;s success, Lipton responded, &quot;Not in my wildest imaginations. It was a joint, arduous effort involving many people. At a point and time not too distant in the past, I had three lives. I was the dean of the Actors Studio, the writer of the series, its host and executive producer. I maintained a preposterous sixteen-hour schedule.&quot; He was awarded France&#x27;s Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2014 for his work on the show.

Lipton&#x27;s last &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;, an interview with Ted Danson, aired on January 11, 2018. In September 2018, Lipton stated that he was stepping down from the program after more than 24 years.

<doc id="866739" wikidata="Q7442143" url="?curid=866739" title="Seattle Monorail Project">
<text>The Seattle Monorail Project was a proposed five-line monorail system to be constructed in Seattle, Washington, US, as an extension of the existing Seattle Center Monorail. The , 17 station Green Line running from Ballard to West Seattle via Seattle Center would have been the first of the five lines to be built.

From 1997 to 2005 the monorail project was a highly contentious political issue in the Seattle area. In November 2005, following the fifth voter initiative on the monorail in eight years, the monorail authority agreed to dissolve itself after having spent $124.7 million in taxpayer funds without beginning any monorail construction.

==History==
===Initiative 41 and ETC===
The effort to extend the monorail began in 1997 with Initiative 41, passed by a 53%–47% vote by Seattle citizens. The initiative proposed a X-shaped monorail system extending the line constructed for the 1962 Seattle World&#x27;s Fair. The system&#x27;s construction and operation was to be carried out by a new agency, the Elevated Transportation Corporation (ETC), using private funding.

The ETC quickly determined that private entrepreneurs could not build a monorail system without public financial support, leading to a second monorail referendum placed before voters as Initiative 53 in 2000, which would allow the ETC to spend $6 million for additional studies to determine an improved monorail plan with full cost estimates and a funding package to pay for construction. I-53 passed 56% to 44% in 2000.

===Five-line plan===

By 2002, the ETC had developed the five-line system plan that came to be called the Seattle Monorail Project. This proposal was put before the voters as Citizens Petition #1 in November 2002 which would propose to dissolve the ETC, create a new monorail agency, construct the Green Line as the first part of the system, and enact an annual 1.4% motor-vehicle excise tax (MVET) on Seattle vehicles to fund the project.

The 2002 petition drew opposition from groups who advanced the following arguments:
* Green Line ridership would not be significantly different from that already achieved by Metro buses
* Building an elevated line with deep concrete beams on Second Avenue in downtown would create a &quot;wall&quot; through the urban core
* The monorail line should be built along the I-5 freeway corridor, among other complaints.

Reflecting the increased opposition, Citizens Petition #1 narrowly passed in November 2002 by just 877 votes, 50.2% to 49.7%. With the passage of CP-1, construction was scheduled to begin in autumn 2005, and be completed in 2009.

Just two years later in November 2004, a recall initiative, I-83, was put on the ballot seeking to halt the project by forcing the city to deny the monorail agency the right to use the air space above public city streets. This fourth initiative in seven years proved unpopular with Seattle voters however, and lost 64% to 36%.

===Financial issues===
The tax to fund the project began effective June 2003, and was levied annually on each car registered in the city based on the MSRP of the vehicle and a fixed depreciation table. In 2005, the average monorail tax per vehicle was $130 annually.

The project soon fell under intense public scrutiny, as actual revenue from the motor vehicle excise tax came in 30% under projections while projected costs rose by 10%. To bridge the shortfall, the SMP initially proposed extending the tax and bond repayments over a 50-year time horizon, resulting in nearly $9 billion in interest paid on the $2 billion construction cost. The plan to extend the tax proved highly controversial and five days later the SMP withdrew its financial plan and the director and board chairman resigned under pressure.

===Loss of city support and closure===
Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels gave the board an ultimatum to create a new financial plan or lose city support for the project. A new plan was not developed, and on September 16, 2005, Nickels withdrew city support for the project.
While the city of Seattle could not officially stop the project, it could withhold permission to build on or above city land, as had been proposed under I-83 a year earlier. Nickels also called on the Seattle Monorail Project to put a measure on the November 2005 ballot to determine whether or not to continue with the project, marking the fifth time Seattleites would vote on the issue. This measure shortened the initial phase of the Green Line to with the remaining to be added later, and the SMP said it would dissolve itself if the measure failed.

Proposition 1 was defeated, 65% to 35%, and in response the SMP reduced staff, terminated the annual motor vehicle excise tax on Seattle vehicles effective June 30, 2006 (three years after it was first implemented) and began liquidating properties already purchased for the Green Line.

The Seattle Monorail Authority was formally dissolved on January 17, 2008, after liquidating all of its assets, repaying its debts, and transferring its remaining $425,963.07 to the King County Metro system. The monorail project ultimately cost Seattle taxpayers $124.7 million.

==Design==
The plan, as proposed by CP-1 (2002) proposed five distinct corridors based on the &quot;Intermediate Capacity Transit Study&quot; and prioritized the Green Line, a north–south route on the west side of the city, as the first of the five to be built. The other four lines included two additional north–south routes, in the center (Blue) and east (Gold) sides of the city, and two east-west connectors, one just north of the Lake Washington Ship Canal (Purple) and the other near the southern city limits (Red). Two future extensions were proposed to the Green Line, one each on the north and south ends.

By 2004, more formal Second Phase plans were developed; the Blue line was cut back and did not cross the Duwamish, but the Red line was extended west to meet a new branch of the Blue line running south from Delridge. In addition, an alternative central north–south Rainbow corridor was added, running from downtown to the University District and continuing on to Northgate and Lake City, approximately following the route of I-5.

The agency considered using a proof-of-payment system for fares similar to the SkyTrain in Vancouver.

===Green Line===
The proposed Green Line ran mostly north-south from Ballard through Magnolia, Queen Anne, Seattle Center, Downtown, Pioneer Square, Chinatown-International District, then turned west and terminated into West Seattle.

===Planned expansion===

Future extensions on the Green Line could have taken it east (from the north terminus at Crown Hill) to Northgate and south (from the south terminus at Morgan Junction) to the Vashon Island Ferry Terminal. These were later designated the Pink North and South Corridors, approximately , respectively.

Additional planned lines included:
* Gold: north–south, connecting Lake City, UW, Capitol Hill, Chinatown-International District, and Downtown. Multiple alignments and phases were studied.
** Alternative 1: 2nd &amp; Madison to Montlake, 
** Alternative 2: Chinatown–ID to Broadway &amp; Roy, 
** Alternative 3: Chinatown–ID to 23rd &amp; Madison, 
** Alternative 3A: Chinatown–ID to U-Village, 
** Alternative 4: Chinatown–ID to Rainier, 
** Alternative 5: Rainier Valley Center to Lake City, 
** Alternative 5A: Rainier Valley Center to U-Village, 
* Purple: east–west, connecting Shilshole and Magnuson Park
** Purple Segment 1: Ballard to Children&#x27;s Hospital, 
** Purple Segment 2: Children&#x27;s Hospital to Sandpoint, 
* Blue: north–south, connecting Greenwood, Fremont, Downtown, SODO, South Park, and Georgetown
** Blue North: Bitter Lake to downtown via Aurora
** Blue South (4th): South Park to downtown
** Blue South (Delridge): Westwood/Highland Park to Delridge (Green Line station)
* Red: east–west, connecting South Park and the Rainier Valley (outside Seattle city limits; preliminary work only)
* Rainbow: north–south, connecting downtown to the University District, with two potential extensions continuing on toward the north:
** Extension 1: U-District to Northgate
** Extension 2: U-District to Lake City

<doc id="866740" wikidata="Q561598" url="?curid=866740" title="Chico Xavier">
<text>Chico Xavier () or Francisco Cândido Xavier, born Francisco de Paula Cândido (, 2 April 1910 – 30 June 2002), was a popular Brazilian philanthropist and spiritist medium. During a period of 60 years he wrote over 490 books and several thousand letters claiming to use a process known as &quot;psychography&quot;. Books based on old letters and manuscripts were published posthumously, bringing the total number of books to 496.

The books written by Chico covered a vast range of topics from religion, philosophy, historical romances and novels, Portuguese literature, poetry, and science, as well as thousands of letters intended to inform, console and uplift the families of deceased persons during his psychographic sessions. His books sold an estimated 50 million copies and the revenue generated by it was totally channeled into charity work.

Xavier was born in the city of Pedro Leopoldo, State of Minas Gerais and is popularly known as &quot;Chico Xavier&quot; (&quot;Chico&quot; is the Portuguese nickname for &quot;Francisco&quot;). Xavier called his spiritual guide Emmanuel, who according to Xavier, lived in ancient Rome as Senator Publius Lentulus, was reincarnated in Spain as Father Damien, and later as a professor at the Sorbonne.

He often mentioned he could not contact a deceased person unless the spirit was willing to be contacted. His appearances on TV talk shows in the late 1960s and early 1970s helped to establish Spiritism as one of the major religions professed in Brazil with more than 5 million followers. Despite his health problems he kept working up to his death, on June 30, 2002, in Uberaba. In 2010, a movie biography entitled &quot;Chico Xavier&quot; was released in Brazil. Directed by Daniel Filho, the film dramatized Xavier&#x27;s life.

On 3 October 2012, the SBT television TV show &quot;O Maior Brasileiro de Todos os Tempos&quot; named Chico Xavier &quot;The Greatest Brazilian of all time&quot;, based on a viewer-supported survey.

Xavier has been accused of fraud regarding his claimed abilities, with critics questioning the authenticity of his prolific psychographic output.

==Childhood==
Francisco was born at 1:00 BRT on 2 April 1910 to João Cândido Xavier, a lottery ticket vendor, and Maria João de Deus, a Catholic housewife. By 1924, Francisco completed his primary education but did not pursue further schooling. He embarked on a career as a sales clerk.

==Contact with Spiritism==
In May 1927 his sister, Maria Xavier, was having mental disturbances, which many believed was caused by spiritual sources known as obsession (Spiritism). This episode allowed Francisco to support his sister with his mediumship capacities and introduced him to the Spiritism Doctrine as well. Simultaneously he allegedly received a new message from his mother in which she recommended him to accomplish all his duties and thoroughly study the books of Allan Kardec. In June, Francisco founded the Spiritist Center Luiz Gonzaga, in a wooden warehouse owned by his brother. In July, under the guidance of a so-called &quot;benevolent spirit&quot;, he started to psychograph, writing seventeen pages.

Later, Xavier would claim that several deceased Poets had begun to manifest themselves through him, but they only started to identify themselves in 1931. In 1928, he published his first psychographic messages in the newspapers &quot;O Jornal&quot;, from Rio de Janeiro, and Almanaque de Notícias, from Portugal.

==First works==
He became widely known in Brazil in 1931, when he published the book &quot;Parnassus Beyond the Tomb&quot; (), which had 259 poems allegedly composed by 56 deceased Brazilian and Portuguese illustrious poets. That year was marked by the medium&#x27;s &quot;adulthood&quot; and when he firstly met his spiritual Mentor Emmanuel, &quot;Under a tree, near a water reservoir...&quot; (SOUTO MAIOR, 1995:31). According to Chico his Mentor informed about his mission to psychograph a sequence of thirty books and to achieve such a task he would require 3 mandatory conditions: &quot;discipline, discipline and discipline&quot;. Emmanuel instructed him to be loyal to Jesus and Kardec, even if it was against his religious basis. Later on, the Medium found out that Emmanuel had been the Roman senator Publius Lentulus, further reborn as a slave who sympathized with Christianity, still in another reincarnation, had been a Jesuit priest Manuel da Nóbrega, involved with the Gospel teachings during the colonial period of Brazil in the 18th century.

In 1932, the book Parnaso de Além-Túmulo, was then published by the Federação Espírita Brasileira - FEB (Brazilian Spiritualist Federation). The compilation of poetry dictated by spirits of Brazilian and Portuguese poets achieved enormous impact in the Brazilian press and in the public opinion, and yet caused strong polemic among the ones involved with Brazilian literature, whose opinions were divided between recognition and accusations of pastiche. The impact increased even more when it was revealed that the books had been written by a &quot;humble clerk&quot; from a warehouse in the countryside of Minas Gerais (Brazilian state where the medium was born), who had barely finished primary school. It is said that the spirit of his mother advised him not to respond to the criticism.

The copyrights of all his books were kindly granted to the FEB. At that period, he started a relationship with Manuel Quintão and Wantuil de Freitas. Still at the same period, an ocular cataract was found, problem which he had to live with for the rest of his life. The spirits and his mentors, Emmanuel and Bezerra de Menezes, instructed him to be treated with the resources of human medicine and told him not to count on any kind of privileges from the spirits.

He kept working as a clerk–typist at the model farm from the Regional Inspectorate of the Department of Livestock Development, He started to perform at Centro Espírita Luís Gonzaga in 1935, helping the ones in need with prescriptions, advice and producing psychographic books. The farm manager and agronomist Rômulo Joviano, also spiritist who attended all the seances at Centro Luiz Gonzaga, where he later became the president., besides giving Francisco a job, he also cooperated with the medium, by allowing him some free time to find the necessary peace to execute his psychographic works, It was in a period that Francisco was using the basement of Joviano&#x27;s house to perform his psychographic works, when one of his most remarkable books, titled Paulo e Estevão (Paul and Stevan) came out. At the same time; a long refusal of gifts and honors started and lasted all his life, as an example: Fred Figner granted Francisco a huge amount of money in his will; which was promptly granted to FEB; by the medium.

As well as notoriety, the criticism from people who tried to discredit him strongly persisted. Chico Xavier said that also spiritual foes tried to involve him into negative fluids and temptations, apart from all living people. Souto Maior (Brazilian journalist) reports an attempted of &quot;lynching by spirits&quot;, as well as an episode which naked girls tried to seduce the medium in his bathtub. Note that; in both episodes there are common narrative aspects to the other proofs, commonly mentioned in stories of holiness.

==Lawsuit from the widow of Humberto de Campos==
During 1930, the publishing of the romances attributed to Emmanuel and the book Brasil, Coração do Mundo, Pátria do Evangelho, attributed to the spirit of Humberto de Campos were highlighted; in which the story of Brazil is interpreted in a mythical and theological way. As consequence; the last book mentioned here brought him a lawsuit from the widow of Humberto de Campos, who pleaded for the psychographed books copyrights, in case the legitimacy of the famous author from Maranhão (A state of Brazil) was proven.

The medium&#x27;s defense was supported by the FEB, further resulting in the classic A Psicografia Perante os Tribunais, (the psychography in the view of court) written by the lawyer Miguel Timponi. along the trial; the judge decided that books copyrights refer to books recognized while the author is alive; since it would be impossible for the court to prove the existence of mediunity. Even so; in order to avoid problems in the future, the spiritual writer&#x27;s name was substituted by the nickname &quot;Irmão X&quot; (Brother X).

At that time, Francisco was hired by the federal public service, as a helper at the Ministério da Agricultura (Ministry of Agriculture). It is important to highlight that; along his career as a public worker; there is no record of any absence from work.

==&quot;Nosso Lar&quot;==
In 1943, one of the most popular books in Brazilian spiritist literature was published, the novel titled &quot;Nosso Lar&quot;, the best seller and most disclosed from the medium&#x27;s extensive psychographic writings; which became a movie of the same name in 2010.

This is the first book from a series whose authorship is attributed to the spirit of André Luis. During that time, the fame of Chico Xavier (Francisco&#x27;s nickname) was increasing, more and more people looked for him in search of healing and messages, transforming the small town of Pedro Leopoldo into an informal center of pilgrimage. Francisco&#x27;s former boss José Felizardo died very poor, the medium then, strived to get him a decent funeral; he went on around the town asking for donations; knocking on every one&#x27;s door to collect money for the burial. According to Francisco&#x27;s biographer Ubiratan Machado, &quot;...even a blind homeless man donated the donations he had collected that day&quot;. (MACHADO, 1996:53).

==The Amauri Pena Case==
In 1958, the medium was involved in a controversial case due to the accusations coming from his nephew, Amauri Pena, son of Francisco&#x27;s sister. The nephew was psychographic Medium and announced to the press to be a fraud, a very capable impostor, extending his declaration to his uncle Xavier. Chico denied any wrongdoing and any proximity or involvement with the nephew. Later remorseful by the damage he caused to his uncle&#x27;s reputation he asked for forgiveness and dropping all the accusations he previously made. Amauri was then hospitalized in a mental hospital in São Paulo, where he eventually died at age 27.

==Coverage on the &quot;O Cruzeiro&quot; magazine==
In 1944, journalist David Nasser and photographer Jean Manzon went to Pedro Leopoldo to write a report on Xavier for the Rio de Janeiro-based magazine &quot;O Cruzeiro&quot;, that Xavier&#x27;s followers deem to have shown him in an unflattering light. At first, they tried to reach Xavier at the Fazenda Modelo, the State-run farm where he was employed as a typist for most of his life, but the farm&#x27;s director denied them access saying that Xavier was tired and needed rest. According to the report, they met with Xavier, never telling him for whom they were working, as he returned from the farm accompanied by a gentleman from Rio who would come to spend weeks at a time with Xavier. The man described Xavier as &quot;[...] a cultured lad. He discusses many subjects, reads a little English and French.&quot; and as &quot;a voracious reader&quot; who would have gone through a copy of Man, the Unknown given to him in under five hours. Photos in the story show Xavier&#x27;s home library with piles of books, with him reading and taking notes.

Xavier&#x27;s followers claim that Nasser and Manzon, at the time, had given fake names in order to test Xavier&#x27;s powers. Decades later, in an interview in 1980, Nasser said that one night &quot;Manzon called me and said, &#x27;Have you seen the book that Chico Xavier gave to us?&#x27;. I said no. &#x27;Well, take a look,&#x27; he said. I was in my library, I picked up the book and written there was this: &#x27;To my brother David Nasser, from Emmanuel&#x27;. He had made a similar dedication to Manzon. It is things like that make me very afraid to get involved in Spiritism issues.&quot;

==Partnership with Waldo Vieira==
At that time, Chico Xavier met the young student of Medicine and medium Waldo Vieira; together they psychographed several books; until their abruption some years later. In 1959, Francisco moved to Uberaba, where he lived until the end of his days. He continued psychographing several books, approaching topics that were priority in the 60&#x27;s; such as, sex, drugs, youth issues, technology, space travels among others. Uberaba then, became an informal center of pilgrimage, with thousands of people arriving every day; people hoping to make contact with deceased relatives. At that time; books of &quot;messages&quot; became popular; letters dictated by spirits of regular people to their family members; proceeding as well with constant campaigns of food and clothing distribution to the poor people around the town.

On 22 May 1965, Chico Xavier and Waldo Vieira travelled to the US in order to disclose spiritism abroad; with the help of Salim Salomão Haddad, president of Christian Spirit Center, and his wife Phillis, they studied English and launched the book titled The World of The Spirits (Ideal Espírita; Portuguese version).

==Interviews on the television show &quot;Pinga-Fogo&quot;==
In the beginning of 1970; Chico took part on the popular nationwide interview TV program called &quot;Pinga Fogo&quot; (Dripping Fire) which reached extremely high levels of audience throughout the country. 

In his first appearance on the program Pinga-Fogo, journalist and philosopher João de Scantimburgo focused on the authenticity of Xavier&#x27;s psychographic writing. João de Scantimburgo expressed skepticism about Xavier&#x27;s prolific output and his ability to convincingly mimic the styles of diverse authors like Humberto de Campos and Guerra Junqueiro. He suggested that Xavier&#x27;s subconscious, rather than spirits, might be responsible for these literary feats. Xavier, demonstrating his characteristic humility and politeness, countered this by maintaining that he serves merely as a channel for spirit authors, emphasizing that they dictate the content while he transcribes it. He acknowledged potential unconscious influences but credited his spirit guide, Emmanuel, for stylistic guidance and refinement. The conversation also touched upon the possibility of historical Catholic saints, such as St. Bridget of Sweden and St. Clare of Montefalco, possessing mediumnistic abilities.

==The 1980s and the 1990s==
At that time, his fame extended to other parts of the world, with several books translated into other languages, as well as adaptations for soap operas versions. By the end of 1990, the medium had already psychographed more than four hundreds books. At that time; it was estimated that approximately fifty millions of spiritist books were circulating in Brazil, from which; fifteen million of them were attributed to Chico Xavier and twelve millions to Kardec (SANTOS, 1997:89).

In 1994, the American tabloid &quot;National Examiner&quot; published an article saying, &quot;Ghost writers make novelist a millionaire&quot; The article was vaunted in Brazil by the extinct news magazine; revista Manchete, titled as Secretary of Ghosts, where it said that, according to &quot;National Examiner&quot; information; the Brazilian medium had made twenty million dollars as a &quot;Secretary of Ghosts&quot;.
The &quot;Manchete&quot; magazine proceeded saying: &quot;According to the newspapers, he is the first one to have admitted that the 380 books he had produced were by &#x27;ghost-writers&#x27;, &quot;literally ghosts&#x27;&quot;, concluding that; Chico simply transcribes psychographed books through more than 500 deceased and buried writers and poets.

The medium; did not respond to the attacks, but the FEB, publisher of most of Chico&#x27;s books; through its then president Juvanir Borges de Souza sent a letter to the magazine; informing them that; all copyrights and remuneration from Francisco Cândido Xavier&#x27;s books had been granted to charity; and that the same procedure was being performed with other publishers as well, yet; emphasizing that &quot;the copyrights are granted absolutely for free, in order to make the books affordable enough, and as well contribute to the disclosure of the Spiritist Doctrine&quot;.

The same president of the FEB, on its 4 October; during the first Worldwide Spiritist Congress, presented a &quot;vote of recognition and appreciation to the medium Francisco Cândido Xavier&quot;, approved by the FEB National Federative Council, under a proposal presented by the president of Federação Espírita do Estado de Sergipe. (Spiritist Federation from the state of Sergipe) In the document; the entities representing the spiritism in Brazil devoted their gratitude and respect for the medium &quot;for his intense and extended works, for the example of life dedicated to studies and fraternity, disclosure and practices of spiritism, for the spiritual and material guidelines, assistance and help to the neighbor&quot;.

==Death==
Chico Xavier died from cardiorespiratory arrest at 19:30 BRT on 30 June 2002, at the venerable age of 92. His friends and family shared that Chico had expressed a unique wish to God regarding the timing of his death. He hoped to die on a day when the people of Brazil were immersed in happiness and national celebration, believing that this would lessen the sadness of his departure. Remarkably, his death coincided with a significant national event: it occurred on the very day Brazil celebrated its victory in the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Chico Xavier&#x27;s death took place approximately nine hours after the final match between Brazil and Germany, aligning poignantly with his wish.

==Biographic movie==
In April 2010, date which Chico Xavier would turn 100 years old, the film &quot;Chico Xavier&quot; was released. It is based on the biography titled &quot;As Vidas de Chico Xavier&quot; (The lives of Chico Xavier), by journalist Marcel Souto Maior, and it was directed and produced by filmmaker Daniel Filho. Chico Xavier is portrayed by actors Matheus Costa, Ângelo Antônio and Nelson Xavier, respectively during three phases of his life: from 1918 to 1922, 1931 to 1959 and 1969 to 1975.

==Skeptical reception==
In 2010, Kentaro Mori published an article in the &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; which accused Xavier of fraud. According to Mori, Xavier&#x27;s close associate Waldo Vieira stated that the staff at Xavier&#x27;s Spiritist Center in Brazil would help him by gathering information about his clients and faking psychic letters. He was also accused of using perfume in the séance room which was a common Spiritualist trick to pretend the scent was of supernatural origin. Xavier was associated with the spritist medium Otília Diogo, who fraudulently pretended to be a spirit by covering herself in white sheets, with a photo of Xavier and a sheeted Diogo being taken in 1964. The skeptic Karen Stollznow has also accused Xavier of hot reading.

==Psychographic works==
Chico Xavier wrote most of 450 allegedly psychographic books. He never admitted to be the author of any of his books. He affirmed he would only reproduce whatever the spirits dictated to him. Being the reason for why he would never accept the money attained from selling his books. He sold more than 50 million copies in Portuguese; with translations in English, Spanish, Japanese, Esperanto, French, German, Italian, Russian, Romanian, Mandarin, Swedish, Braille, and other languages. He also transcribed around ten thousand letters allegedly from the dead to their families. The letters were declared legitimate by many people, and some of the letters were used as evidence in four criminal trials. Chico Xavier granted all the copyrights to charity institution since the first book.

His works are published by the Centro Espírita União, by the Casa Editora O Clarim, by Edicel, by the Federação Espírita Brasileira, by the Federação Espírita do Estado de São Paulo, by the Federação Espírita do Rio Grande do Sul, by the Fundação Marieta Gaio, by the Grupo Espírita Emmanuel s/c Editora, by the Comunhão Espírita Cristã, by the Instituto de Difusão Espírita, by the Instituto de Divulgação Espírita André Luiz, by the Livraria Allan Kardec Editora, by the Editora Pensamento, by the Editora Vinha de Luz and by the União Espírita Mineira. Even though he hadn&#x27;t finished primary high school, he would write around six books a year, among romances, tales, philosophy, rehearsals, apologues, chronics, poems, etc. He is the most read author from Latin America (note: year of 2010).

His first books, Parnaso de Além-Túmulo, containing 256 poems attributed to deceased poets, among them, two being the Portuguese João de Deus, Antero de Quental and Guerra Junqueiro and the Brazilians Olavo Bilac, Cruz e Sousa and Augusto dos Anjos, was published for the first time in 1932; the book caused strong admiration and controversy among the literary circle from that time. Among other books, Nosso Lar was the one with the largest circulation, it was first published in 1944, which sold more than two million copies, attributed to the spirit of André Luiz, it was the first volume out of a collection composed by seventeen books, all of them psychographed by Chico Xavier, some of them in partnership with medium Doctor Waldo Vieira.

Through the decades, Chico produced thousands of psychographed letters for desperate parents and mothers who came to him in order to receive messages from their deceased sons and daughters. According to a survey from 1990, performed by the Spiritist Medical Association of São Paulo, the letters always contained much informations that was somehow familiar to the readers for whom the letters were intended, and 35 per cent of them carried an identical signature to the signature of the deceased.

One electroencephalogram study conducted during a mediumnistic trance by Dr. Elias Barbosa, Chico Xavier&#x27;s family doctor, was reported by &quot;Revista Planeta&quot;, a popular news magazine, in June 1973. It was suggested that Chico presented common characteristics of epilepsy, even though he was never epileptic, with claims that his brain activity was somehow &quot;paranormal&quot;. Many years later, in February 2010, Dr. Guilherme Gustavo Riccioppo Rodrigues reviewed Barbosa&#x27;s EEG study and found &quot;no evidence to suggest clinical abnormality, let alone to support the idea that his brain is paranormal&quot;.

A 2014 study published by parapsychologists in the journal investigated the accuracy of information contained in 13 letters allegedly written by Chico Xavier through psychography (automatic writing) between 1974 and 1979, and claimed that Xavier made 99 accurate claims that he could not have made without supernatural means. The paper was criticized by skeptics and citizen science journalists. , in &quot;Galileu&quot; magazine and Maurício Tuffani, in the newspaper &quot;Folha de S.Paulo&quot;, who questioned the credibility of results and suggested that the support for Xavier&#x27;s authenticity as the result of methodological flaws. They also criticized the article because of the low impact factor of the &quot;Explore&quot; journal. Tuffani published a subsequent response from the parapsychologist , one of the authors of the article, but did not retract their criticisms.

<text>James O&#x27;Barr (born January 1, 1960) is an American comics artist, writer and graphic artist. He created the comic book series &quot;The Crow&quot;.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Barr, an orphan, was raised in the foster care system.

==Career==
At 18, O&#x27;Barr enlisted in the Marines. While stationed in West Germany, he illustrated combat manuals for the U.S. military.

Before he joined the Marines, O&#x27;Barr&#x27;s fiancée, Beverly, had been killed by a drunk driver. Part of the reason O’Barr joined the military was the hope that service would help him cope with his grief. While living in West Berlin in 1981, O&#x27;Barr began to work on his comic, &quot;The Crow&quot;, as a means of dealing with his personal tragedy. O&#x27;Barr was further inspired by a Detroit newspaper account of the murder of a young couple over a $20 engagement ring. In &quot;The Crow&quot;, the protagonist, Eric, and his fiancée, Shelly, are murdered by a gang of criminals. Eric then returns from the dead, guided by a supernatural crow, to hunt their killers.

After his discharge from the Marines, O&#x27;Barr returned to Detroit, where he continued to paint and illustrate while working a day job at an auto body shop. &quot;The Crow&quot; was eventually published in association with Gary Reed of Caliber Press. The first miniseries was published in 1989. &quot;The Crow&quot; has since sold more than 750,000 copies worldwide.

O&#x27;Barr&#x27;s own hope that his project would result in a personal catharsis went unfulfilled. During an interview in 1994, he said, &quot;[A]s I drew each page, it made me more self-destructive, if anything... There is pure anger on each page&quot;.

In the 1990s, O&#x27;Barr was affiliated with the experimental metal band Trust Obey, which was signed briefly to Trent Reznor&#x27;s Nothing label. Trust Obey released the album &quot;Fear and Bullets: Music to Accompany The Crow&quot; in 1993. The album was packaged with a special edition of &quot;The Crow&quot; graphic novel.

&quot;The Crow&quot; was adapted into a successful film of the same name in 1994, which was marred by the tragic death of its star, Brandon Lee, during filming. The film went on to spawn three sequels and a television series.

After the success of &quot;The Crow&quot; film, O&#x27;Barr began planning an apocalyptic graphic novel series entitled &quot;Gothik&quot;. The series was based on &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and featured &quot;Jonny Z&quot; from his short story &quot;Frame 137&quot; as the main character.

In January 2013, Motionworks Entertainment released O&#x27;Barr&#x27;s western comic, &quot;Sundown&quot;, which served as their debut motion comic for iPhone and iPad. He also announced his work on a comic about the Korean War, centered on the efforts of three U.S. Marine guncrews to hold Fox Hill during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, with a different artist drawing each gun crew.

In 2013, O&#x27;Barr was named as a consultant on a possible reboot of &quot;The Crow&quot; film franchise. Although previously opposed to the project, in an October 2014 interview, speaking of his involvement, O&#x27;Barr discussed the approach to the adaptation and efforts being made to respect the original film. Later, in November 2014, O&#x27;Barr appeared at the Wizard World Tulsa Comic Con and stated that he was co-writing the script with screenwriter Cliff Dorfman. After a long period in development hell, a reboot film would be released in 2024 starring Bill Skarsgård, though O&#x27;Barr is only credited in reference to the original comic.

==Personal life==

As of the mid 2000s, O&#x27;Barr resided in Dallas.

<text>Robert &quot;Shep&quot; Pettibone (born 10 July 1959) is an American record producer, remixer, songwriter and club DJ, one of the most prolific of the 1980s.

==Career==
Shep Pettibone surfaced after his work with Arthur Baker on Afrika Bambaataa &amp; the Jazzy 5&#x27;s &quot;Jazzy Sensation&quot; and as an in-house mix engineer for Prelude Records.
During his recording career, he launched innovative &quot;mastermixes&quot; for New York&#x27;s KISS FM. The popularity of these mixes persuaded Prelude Records to release some of them commercially.
Pettibone built his brand through his personal approach to remixing tracks, specially crafted for the dancefloor. Acclaimed by DJs worldwide, he was the go-to man to achieve club and chart success. His prowess at production and mixing led him to work with such artists as Madonna and George Michael in the late 1980s during the height of these artists&#x27; popularity. His influence is still perceivable in today&#x27;s music.

Pettibone is the subject of the first volume of the &quot;Arthur Baker Presents Dance Masters&quot; series, &quot;Shep Pettibone: The Classic 12&quot; Master-Mixes&quot;, a 47-song box set with highlights from his career.

==The &quot;Vogue&quot; case==
Pettibone, co-writer and co-producer of Madonna&#x27;s 1990 hit &quot;Vogue&quot;, sued Warner Music in a dispute over withholding royalty payments.
An appeals court ruled that the music producer was not responsible for paying the publishing giant&#x27;s legal fees in a previous case.

<doc id="866748" wikidata="Q6966840" url="?curid=866748" title="Nashia inaguensis">
<text>Nashia inaguensis is an evergreen shrub, commonly referred to as Moujean tea, Bahamas berry, or pineapple verbena. It is native to the east Caribbean islands, in particular the island of Inagua in the Bahamas, after which the species is named. In its native environment, the plant crawls along sunny, rocky outcroppings, semi-protected from steady high winds.

It is a loose, spreading shrub with many branches up to 2 m high, with mature trunks of 5–10 cm diameter. The leaves are aromatic, simple, opposite (or fascicled), elliptic to obovate or spatulate, 5–10 mm long, with revolute margins. The flowerheads are axillary, sessile, few-flowered, with a strigose calyx; the corolla is whitish, about 2 mm long, four-lobed, and with four stamens. The fragrant foliage and tiny white flowers are highly attractive to pollinators, in particular the Atala butterfly.

==Cultivation and uses==
It is often used as a bonsai plant due to its miniaturized features. The flowers form in clusters and are followed by reddish orange berries. It prefers full sun, warmth (a minimum temperature of 5 °C) and must be kept under high humidity. Even a brief spell of dryness can kill the plant. It can be propagated from cuttings, preferably in the spring and early summer during warm nights. A decoction of the fragrant leaves, variously described as having the scent and flavor of citrus, vanilla, or pineapple, is used as an herbal tea.

<doc id="866752" wikidata="Q5421892" url="?curid=866752" title="Extended order">
<text>Extended order is an economics and sociology concept introduced by Friedrich Hayek in his book &quot;The Fatal Conceit&quot;. Hayek describes an extended order as the outcome of a system that embraces and trade, and he claims that it &quot;constitutes an information gathering process, able to call up, and put to use, widely dispersed information that no central planning agency, let alone any individual, could know as a whole, possess or control.&quot; The result is an interconnected web where people can benefit from the actions and knowledge of those they don&#x27;t know. This is possible and efficient, in Hayek&#x27;s view, because a proper legal framework replaces trust, which is only practical in small circles of people who know each other socially. The extended order is at the heart of Hayek&#x27;s thesis, in &quot;The Fatal Conceit&quot;, where he argues that &quot;our civilization depends, not only for its origin but also for its preservation, on what can be precisely described only as the extended order of human cooperation, an order more commonly, if somewhat misleading, known as capitalism.&quot;

==Development of the extended order in society==
Hayek argues that the extended order &quot;is a framework of institutions – economic, legal, and moral – into which we fit ourselves by obeying certain rules of conduct that &quot;we never made&quot;, and which &quot;we have never understood&quot; in the sense of which we understand how the things that we manufacture function.&quot; This &quot;order resulted &quot;not&quot; from human design or intention but spontaneously: it arose from unintentionally conforming to certain traditional &amp; largely moral practices, many of which men tend to dislike, whose significance they usually fail to understand, whose validity they cannot prove, and which have nonetheless fairly rapidly spread by means of an evolutionary selection – the comparative increase in population &amp; wealth – of those groups that happened to follow them.&quot;

According to Hayek, the adoption of these practices by these groups, &quot;increased their access to valuable information of all sorts, &amp; enabled them to be &#x27;fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it&#x27; (Genesis 1:28). This process is perhaps the least appreciated facet of human evolution.&quot;

Hayek argues that the extended order&#x27;s formation &quot;required individuals to change their &#x27;natural&#x27; or instinctual&#x27; responses to others, something strongly resisted&quot;, whereas any and all &quot;constraints on the practices of the small group, it must be emphasized &amp; repeated, are &quot;hated&quot;.&quot; This is because man &quot;knows so many objects that seem desirable but for which he is not permitted to grasp, and he cannot see how other beneficial features of his environment depend on the discipline to which he is forced to submit – a discipline forbidding him to reach out for these same appealing objects. Disliking these constraints so much, we can hardly be said to have selected them; rather, these constraints selected us: they enabled us to survive.&quot;

Hayek says that the evolutionary process of the extended order can be stimulated by increases in individual freedom and has even realized some of its greatest advances during times of anarchy, however it can (and quite often has throughout history) been hindered by government constraint. He continues: &quot;Protection of several property, not the direction of its use by government, laid the foundations for the growth of the dense network of exchange of services that shaped the extended order.&quot; The extended order is &quot;not a creation of man&#x27;s reason but a distinct second endowment conferred on him by cultural evolution.&quot;

Hayek posits that, since it is not genetically transferred, the continuing cultural evolution of the extended order requires teaching and passing on to each new generation the prevailing traditions, customs, morality and rules. This cultural evolutionary requirement was also analyzed by Will and Ariel Durant who said: &quot;Civilization is not inherited; it has to be learned and earned by each generation anew; if the transmission should be interrupted for one century, civilization would die, and we should be savages again.&quot;

<text>Spontaneous order, also named self-organization in the hard sciences, is the spontaneous emergence of order out of seeming chaos. The term &quot;self-organization&quot; is more often used for physical changes and biological processes, while &quot;spontaneous order&quot; is typically used to describe the emergence of various kinds of social orders in human social networks from the behavior of a combination of self-interested individuals who are not intentionally trying to create order through planning. Proposed examples of systems which evolved through spontaneous order or self-organization include the evolution of life on Earth, language, crystal structure, the Internet, Wikipedia, and free market economy.

In economics and the social sciences, spontaneous order has been defined by Hayek as &quot;the result of human actions, not of human design&quot;.

In economics, spontaneous order has been defined as an equilibrium behavior among self-interested individuals, which is most likely to evolve and survive, obeying the natural selection process &quot;survival of the likeliest&quot;.

==History==
According to Murray Rothbard, the philosopher Zhuangzi ( 369–286 BC) was the first to propose the idea of spontaneous order. Zhuangzi rejected the authoritarianism of Confucianism, writing that there &quot;has been such a thing as letting mankind alone; there has never been such a thing as governing mankind [with success].&quot; He articulated an early form of spontaneous order, asserting that &quot;good order results spontaneously when things are let alone&quot;, a concept later &quot;developed particularly by Proudhon in the nineteenth [century]&quot;.

In 1767, the sociologist and historian Adam Ferguson within the context of Scottish Enlightenment described society as the &quot;result of human action, but not the execution of any human design&quot;.

Jacobs has suggested that the term &quot;spontaneous order&quot; was effectively coined by Michael Polanyi in his essay, &quot;The Growth of Thought in Society,&quot; Economica 8 (November 1941): 428–56.

The Austrian School of Economics, led by Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek made it a centerpiece in its social and economic thought. Hayek&#x27;s theory of spontaneous order is the product of two related but distinct influences that do not always tend in the same direction. As an economic theorist, his explanations can be given a rational explanation. But as a legal and social theorist, he leans, by contrast, very heavily on a conservative and traditionalist approach which instructs us to submit blindly to a flow of events over which we can have little control.

==Proposed examples==

===Markets===
Many classical-liberal theorists, such as Hayek, have argued that market economies are a spontaneous order, and that they represent &quot;a more efficient allocation of societal resources than any design could achieve.&quot; They claim this spontaneous order (referred to as the extended order in Hayek&#x27;s &quot;The Fatal Conceit&quot;) is superior to any order a human mind can design due to the specifics of the information required. Centralized statistical data, they suppose, cannot convey this information because the statistics are created by abstracting away from the particulars of the situation.

According to Norman P. Barry, this is illustrated in the concept of the invisible hand proposed by Adam Smith in &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;.

Lawrence Reed, president of the Foundation for Economic Education, a libertarian think tank in the United States, argues that spontaneous order &quot;is what happens when you leave people alone—when entrepreneurs... see the desires of people... and then provide for them.&quot; He further claims that &quot;[entrepreneurs] respond to market signals, to prices. Prices tell them what&#x27;s needed and how urgently and where. And it&#x27;s infinitely better and more productive than relying on a handful of elites in some distant bureaucracy.&quot;

===Anarchism===

Anarchists argue that the state is in fact an artificial creation of the ruling elite, and that true spontaneous order would arise if it were eliminated. This is construed by some but not all as the ushering in of organization by anarchist law. In the anarchist view, such spontaneous order would involve the voluntary cooperation of individuals. According to the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Sociology&quot;, &quot;the work of many symbolic interactionists is largely compatible with the anarchist vision, since it harbours a view of society as spontaneous order.&quot;

===Sobornost===
The concept of spontaneous order can also be seen in the works of the Russian Slavophile movements and specifically in the works of Fyodor Dostoyevsky. The concept of an organic social manifestation as a concept in Russia expressed under the idea of sobornost. Sobornost was also used by Leo Tolstoy as an underpinning to the ideology of Christian anarchism. The concept was used to describe the uniting force behind the peasant or serf Obshchina in pre-Soviet Russia.

===Other examples===
Perhaps the most prominent exponent of spontaneous order is Friedrich Hayek. In addition to arguing the economy is a spontaneous order, which he termed a catallaxy, he argued that common law and the brain are also types of spontaneous orders. In &quot;The Republic of Science,&quot; Michael Polanyi also argued that science is a spontaneous order, a theory further developed by Bill Butos and Thomas McQuade in a variety of papers. Gus DiZerega has argued that democracy is the spontaneous order form of government, David Emmanuel Andersson has argued that religion in places like the United States is a spontaneous order, and Troy Camplin argues that artistic and literary production are spontaneous orders. Paul Krugman has also contributed to spontaneous order theory in his book &quot;The Self-Organizing Economy&quot;, in which he claims that cities are self-organizing systems. Credibility thesis suggests that the credibility of social institutions is the driving factor behind the endogenous self-organization of institutions and their persistence.

Different rules of game would cause different types of spontaneous order. If an economic society obeys the equal-opportunity rules, the resulting spontaneous order is reflected as an exponential income distribution; that is, for an equal-opportunity economic society, the exponential income distribution is most likely to evolve and survive. By analyzing datasets of household income from 66 countries and Hong Kong SAR, ranging from Europe to Latin America, North America and Asia, Tao et al found that, for all of these countries, the income structure for the great majority of populations (low and middle income classes) follows an exponential income distribution.

==Criticism==
Roland Kley writes about Hayek&#x27;s theory of spontaneous order that &quot;the foundations of Hayek&#x27;s liberalism are so incoherent&quot; because the &quot;idea of spontaneous order lacks distinctness and internal structure.&quot; The three components of Hayek&#x27;s theory are lack of intentionality, the &quot;primacy of tacit or practical knowledge&quot;, and the &quot;natural selection of competitive traditions.&quot; While the first feature, that social institutions may arise in some unintended fashion, is indeed an essential element of spontaneous order, the second two are only implications, not essential elements.

Hayek&#x27;s theory has also been criticized for not offering a moral argument, and his overall outlook contains &quot;incompatible strands that he never seeks to reconcile in a systematic manner.&quot;

Abby Innes has criticised many of the economic ideas as a fatal confrontation between economic libertarianism and reality, arguing that it represents a form of materialist utopia that has much in common with Soviet Russia

<doc id="866768" wikidata="Q8023584" url="?curid=866768" title="Win4Lin">
<text>Win4Lin is a discontinued proprietary software application for Linux which allowed users to run a copy of Windows 9x, Windows 2000 or Windows XP applications on their Linux desktop. Win4Lin was based on Merge software, a product which changed owners several times until it was bought by TreLOS Inc. Citing changes in the desktop virtualization industry, the software&#x27;s publisher, Virtual Bridges, has discontinued Win4Lin Pro.

==Products and technology==

In 2006, Win4Lin came in three different versions, depending on the virtualization requirements of the user.

* Win4Lin 9x allowed the user to run a full copy of Windows 98 or Windows Me inside a virtual machine.
* Win4Lin Home allowed users to only emulate applications. 
* Win4Lin Pro offered users the ability to install a fully virtualized Windows 2000 or Windows XP.

The Win4Lin 9x/Pro (henceforth the only technology discussed in this section) operates by running Windows applications in a virtual machine. Unlike Wine or CrossOver which are compatibility layers, virtualization-based software such as VMware or Win4Lin require users to have a Windows license in order to run applications since they must install a full copy of Windows within the virtual machine.

Unlike VMware, however, Win4Lin provides the virtual guest operating system with access to the native Linux filesystem, and allows the Linux host to access the guest&#x27;s files even when the virtual machine is not running. In addition to the convenience this offers, Computerworld found in their 2002 review that Win4Lin gained significant performance over VMware by using the native Linux filesystem, but also noted that this approach (unlike VMware&#x27;s) limited the installation of only one version of Windows on a Win4Lin machine.

When the Win4Lin application starts it displays a window on the Linux desktop which contains the Windows desktop environment. Users can then install or run applications as they normally would from within Windows. Win4Lin supports Linux printers, internet connections, and Windows networking, but , does not support DirectX and by extension most Windows games.

They also offered Win4BSD for FreeBSD.

==History==
Win4Lin was initially based on Merge software originally developed at Locus Computing Corporation, and which changed hands several times until it ended in the assets of NeTraverse, which were purchased in 2005 by Win4Lin, Inc. Later that year, they introduced Win4Lin Pro, which was based on a “tuned” version of QEMU and KQEMU, and it hosted Windows NT-versions of Windows.

In June 2006, Win4Lin released Win4Lin Virtual Desktop Server, later named Win4VDI based on the same code base. Win4VDI for Linux served Microsoft Windows desktops to thin clients from a Linux server. It was integrated into VERDE on March 9, 2009.

Win4Lin, Inc. discontinued Win4Lin 9x on May 30, 2006. The Win4Lin Pro Desktop product ceased to be supported in March 2010.
==Reception==

Many users reported that the 9x version ran windows software at near-native speed, even on quite low-powered machines, such as Pentium-IIs.

Nicholas Petereley praised Win4Lin in two of his columns in the year 2000, for its significantly faster performance than its competitor VMware.

<text>Trusted Solaris is a discontinued security-evaluated operating system based on Solaris by Sun Microsystems, featuring a mandatory access control model.

==Features==
* Accounting
* Role-Based Access Control
* Auditing
* Device allocation
* Mandatory access control (MAC) labeling

==Certification==
Trusted Solaris 8 is Common Criteria certified at Evaluation Assurance Level EAL4+ against the CAPP, RBACPP, and LSPP protection profiles. It is the basis for the DoDIIS Trusted Workstation program.

==Solaris Trusted Extensions==
Features that were previously only available in Trusted Solaris, such as fine-grained privileges, are now part of the standard Solaris release. In the Solaris 10 11/06 update a new component called Solaris Trusted Extensions was introduced, making it no longer necessary to have a different release with a modified kernel for labeled security environments. Solaris Trusted Extensions is an OpenSolaris project.

Solaris Trusted Extensions, when enabled, enforces a mandatory access control policy on all aspects of the operating system, including device access, file, networking, print and window management services. This is achieved by adding sensitivity labels to objects, thereby establishing explicit relationships between these objects. Only appropriate (and explicit) authorization allows applications and users read and/or write access to the objects.

The component also provides labeled security features in a desktop environment. Apart from extending support for the Common Desktop Environment from the Trusted Solaris 8 release, it delivered the first labeled environment based on GNOME. Solaris Trusted Extensions facilitates the access of data at multiple classification levels through a single desktop environment.

Solaris Trusted Extensions also implements labeled device access and labeled network communication, through the Commercial Internet Protocol Security Option (CIPSO) standard. CIPSO is used to pass security information within and between labeled zones. Solaris Trusted Extensions complies with the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS).

<text>Revolting People is a BBC Radio 4 situation comedy set in colonial Baltimore, Maryland, just before and during the American Revolutionary War. The series is written by the Briton Andy Hamilton and the American Jay Tarses, with Tarses playing a sour shopkeeper named Samuel Oliphant and Hamilton playing a cheerfully corrupt, one-legged, one-eyed, one-armed, one-eared one-nostrilled British soldier, Sergeant Roy McGurk, billeted on him.

Samuel&#x27;s children are Mary, who is in love with McGurk&#x27;s prim commanding officer Captain Brimshaw while at the same time operating as a notorious anti-British pamphleteer under the pseudonym Spartacus; Cora, in an unconsummated marriage with the pompous pro-British Loyalist official Ezekiel but nevertheless a mother; and the dimwitted Joshua, whose favourite recreation is wrestling bears.

Series 1 and 2 were released on CD in 2007–8. Repeats on the series now play on BBC Radio 4 Extra (formerly BBC Radio 7).

<doc id="866785" wikidata="Q1384322" url="?curid=866785" title="Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle">
<text>The Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) (formerly known as the Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAAV)) was an amphibious assault vehicle developed by General Dynamics during the 1990s and 2000s for use by the US Marine Corps. It would have been launched at sea, from an amphibious assault ship beyond the horizon, able to transport a full marine rifle squad to shore. It would maneuver cross country with an agility and mobility equal to or greater than the M1 Abrams.

The EFV was designed to replace the aging AAV-7A1 Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV), which entered service in 1972, and was the Marine Corps&#x27; number one priority ground weapon system acquisition. It was to have had three times the speed in water and about twice the armor of the AAV, as well as superior firepower. The vehicle was to be deployed in 2015; however, on 6 January 2011, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates recommended the EFV program be canceled. The program, which was projected to cost $15 billion, had already cost $3 billion.

The Marines asked for the EFV to be canceled in favor of the Assault Amphibian Vehicle Service Life Extension Program and the Marine Personnel Carrier, which itself became phase one of the Amphibious Combat Vehicle.

==History==
In the 1980s, the US Marine Corps developed an &quot;over the horizon&quot; strategy for ocean-based assaults. The intention was to protect naval ships from enemy mines and shore defenses. It included the MV-22 Osprey, the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC), and the EFV.

Development for the AAAV began in August 1974 with Landing Vehicle Assault (LVA) prototypes that continued in the early 1980s at the command at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton. The AAAV&#x27;s predecessor, the LVTP-7, had its life expectancy extended in 1983–84 by use of a service life extension program, which modified and upgraded many of the key systems, creating the LVTP7A1 and re-designated it the AAVP7A1. At the time these vehicles were released, the USMC had anticipated and communicated delivery of the AAAV by 1993. As a result of delays, the AAVP7A1 received another service life extension-type upgrade in the mid 1990s while the USMC still awaited final development and delivery of the AAAV, 14 years behind original projected time frames.

In 1988, defense officials authorized the concept exploration and definition phase. In 1995, the program entered into the definition and risk reduction phase, where it won two Department of Defense awards for successful cost and technology management. In June 1996, a contract was awarded to General Dynamics Land Systems to begin full-scale engineering development of their design. Based on the early success of the program, the Marine Corps awarded a cost-plus contract to General Dynamics in July 2001 for the systems development and demonstration phase of the program, expected to be completed by October 2003. The AAAV was renamed &quot;EFV&quot; in September 2003. The Government Accountability Office later stated that the development phase of three years was insufficient, causing delays and prototype failures, particularly in reliability. After the 2006 operational assessment was plagued by reliability issues and maintenance burdens, the Corps began a redesign of the EFV, requiring a new contract for an additional in February 2007. That June, a reset of the development phase delayed completion by an additional four years. Instead of initiating production as planned, the corps asked for seven new prototypes, to address the current deficiencies, which had caused an average of one failure for every four and a half hours of operation.

On 7 April 2009, Defense Secretary Gates said that the EFV program would &quot;continue as-is&quot;, pending an amphibious review in the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review. The vehicle was called &quot;exquisite&quot;, which Gates usually reserved for programs he intended to cancel. He later questioned the EFV as the proper ship-to-shore platform on 3 May 2010, the day before the initial prototype was rolled out at a ceremony at Marine Corps Base Quantico.

The USMC had reduced the number to be purchased from 1,013 to 573 AAAVs by 2015 due to escalation in unit cost estimated at $22.3 million in 2007. The EFV might be a baseline vehicle for the US Army&#x27;s BCT Ground Combat Vehicle Program, however it is more likely that the army will start a new program.

Low rate initial production (LRIP) was projected to begin in January 2012. Projected total program development cost of the type until first quarter of 2010 was estimated at 15.9 billion dollars.

=== Controversy ===
Robert O. Work, while Undersecretary of the Navy sketched out a future for amphibious warfare in which either the Marines will land unopposed or it will take a major effort using all the long range weapons of the United States armed forces to clear out ship-killing missiles, so that amphibious ships can safely approach the hostile beach and neither scenario sees much use for the EFV. New families of guided anti-ship weapons have extended target ranges of well past making the EFV&#x27;s capabilities less of a game-changer than originally hoped.

In a joint report, the US Public Interest Research Group and the National Taxpayers Union called the EFV program wasteful spending and asked for its cancellation along with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the V-22 Osprey aircraft. The co-chairs of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform have also supported the cancellation of the EFV. During a Pentagon briefing, on 6 January 2011, revealing budget efficiencies and reinvestment possibilities, Secretary of Defense Gates announced his intention to cancel the EFV program. In a statement released after Gates&#x27; press conference, Commandant of the Marine Corps General Amos said that he supported the cancellation of the EFV: 

Loren B. Thompson, of the Lexington Institute, said that Amos had been ordered to give this statement, which did not reflect his actual feelings on the issue.

In an interview on 5 January 2011 with Bloomberg Businessweek, Duncan D. Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, anticipated the cancellation announcement by Gates. However, Hunter predicted that his committee would reject the cancellation.

According to Lieutenant General George J. Flynn of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command, the USMC was to use funding from the cancelled EFV for other tactical ground vehicles over the next five years. The EFV program was cut from a 2012 proposed budget by the White House.

General Dynamics offered a cut down version of the EFV without the hydroplaning or weapons. Ray Mabus has said that new defensive systems will allow navy ships to close to within off hostile shores so a amphibious tracked vehicle is no longer needed.

Deputy Commandant George Flynn has said that the analysis of alternatives to replace the EFV will be accelerated to complete in six to nine months. In the 2012 appropriations bill, Congress ordered that the EFV be one of the alternatives considered in the study.

==Design==
The EFV, designed by General Dynamics Land Systems, was an amphibious armored tracked vehicle with an aluminum hull. The engine is a custom MTU Friedrichshafen diesel (MT883) with two modes of operation; a high power mode for planing over the sea, and a low power mode for land travel. It has a crew of three and can transport 17 marines and their equipment. The EFV would have been the first heavy tactical vehicle with a space frame structure.

The hull had a hydraulically actuated bow flap to aid planing with a maximum waterborne speed of . Shrouded Honeywell waterjet propulsors are integrated into each side of the hull, which create over of power. It was also outfitted with hydraulically actuated chines to cover the tracks while in seafaring mode.

The vehicle uses an Ethernet network connected by the Tactical Switch Router, based on the COTS DuraMAR Mobile IP router for its internal and external communications.

===Armament===
The electrically powered two-man MK46 turret on the personnel variant accommodated the commander on the right and gunner on the left, a fire control system, and the main and coaxial weapons.

The standard version was to have had a Mk44 Bushmaster II cannon, which fired up to 250 rounds per minute with single, burst, and fully automatic capabilities up to in all weather conditions. A general purpose M240 machine gun with 600 rounds of ready-to-use ammunition was to be mounted coaxially with the main gun.

===Countermeasures===
The EFV was fitted with composite armor, mine-blast protection, and a nuclear, biological and chemical defense system. Although aluminum hulls have been used for decades in military ground vehicles and watercraft, they have caused some concern due to protection issues.

In June 2007 members of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Expeditionary Forces sent a letter to the Commandant of the Marine Corps urging that the EFV be redesigned to give troops better protection against roadside bombs. The Marines suggested that underbelly armor appliqué could be applied after the EFVs come ashore and before they encounter IEDs. The limited protection the EFV offers is an improvement on that offered by the AAV so the replacement is an advantage, given the current doctrine of using landing craft for land patrols.

However, tests in January and February 2010 at Aberdeen Test Center demonstrated that the EFV offers blast protection equal to a category-2 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle, including two simulated improvised explosive devices under its belly and tracks. Tests also show that it has superior protection from direct and indirect fire. The flat hull, which has endured persistent criticism for not being the more blast-resistant V-shape, was necessary for the EFV to plane across the surface of the water and reach its high speed, while dealing with sea states of Category 4.

On 13 October 2010 the navy awarded M Cubed Technologies a contract to develop new armor for the EFV to offer better protection and lighter weight.

===Mobility===

Given the increasing ranges of shore launched anti-ship missiles, the EFV&#x27;s range for amphibious landing may no longer provide the anticipated protection predicted for an over the horizon launch. The US Navy began reconsidering the over the horizon approach, and is considering appropriate for amphibious launches. This shift in doctrine has made the EFV&#x27;s high water speeds unnecessary. The EFV&#x27;s need for high water speed has resulted in an engine that is more powerful than the M1 Abrams, even though the EFV weighs far less.

==Variants==

===Personnel variant===
The EFVP1 with a three-man crew would have conducted the signature mission of the United States Marine Corps, expeditionary maneuver warfare from seabases by initiating amphibious operations from over-the-horizon and transporting 17 combat-equipped Marines to inland objectives. The fully armored, tracked combat vehicle would have provided firepower to disembarked or mechanized infantry with its own fully stabilized MK46 weapon station with the 30 mm cannon and 7.62 mm machine-gun.

===Command variant===
The EFVC1 was to have provided the same survival and mobility capabilities found in the EFVP1. The EFVC1 would have been employed as a tactical command post for maneuver unit commanders at the battalion and regimental level. The EFVC1 would have provided the supported commander and selected staff with the ability to communicate, via on-board communications, with senior, adjacent, and subordinate maneuver units. The EFVC1 was to be armed with only a 7.62 mm machine gun.

<doc id="866786" wikidata="Q2130840" url="?curid=866786" title="Randy's Donuts">
<text>Randy&#x27;s Donuts is a bakery and a landmark building in Inglewood, California which is near Los Angeles International Airport. It is built in a style that dates to a period in the early 20th century that saw a proliferation of programmatic architecture throughout Southern California. This style had its heyday from the mid-1920s to the mid-1930s. By the 1950s however, the trend of designing structures in the shape of the product sold there had changed to focus on signs rather than architecture itself. Randy&#x27;s is represented by a giant doughnut on the roof of an otherwise ordinary drive-in that is a dedicated doughnut bakery. The building was designed by Henry J. Goodwin.

Colossal donut signs atop Randy&#x27;s stores vary in size. Most locations use a diameter version that sits atop the building and faces an intersection. In &quot;Roadside Giant&quot; by Brian and Sarah Butko, the Weintraubs climbed on top of the doughnut with a tape measure and confirmed the measurements for the authors. The Bellflower location, however, features a smaller version of the doughnut on top of a pole in front of the building. This may be in diameter, as is widely reported.

The 24-hour drive-in is at 805 West Manchester Boulevard and it intersects with La Cienega Boulevard. It is near the Manchester Boulevard off-ramp of the San Diego Freeway (I-405).

== History ==
In the late 1940s, doughnut machine salesman Russell Wendell founded a chain of drive-in doughnut shops named Big Donut. The first location opened in 1951 in Westmont. The second location, which is now a Randy&#x27;s Donuts, was opened in 1952. Designed by architect Henry Goodwin and structural engineer Richard Bradshaw, the rooftop doughnut is constructed out of rolled steel bars covered with gunite.

In 1976, after shifting focus to his Pup &#x27;N&#x27; Taco chain (bought by Taco Bell in 1984), Wendell sold the Big Donut Inglewood location to Robert Eskow who renamed the location &quot;Randy&#x27;s Donuts&quot; after his son. In 1978, Eskow sold the shop to Ron and Larry Weintraub, who decided to retain the name for the business.

In 2015, Randy&#x27;s Donuts was purchased by lawyer and entrepreneur Mark Kelegian. Since that time, the brand has added franchise locations in Southern California, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Las Vegas, and the Philippines.

Randy&#x27;s Donuts opened a location at Los Angeles International Airport in 2023 and in the No Ho Arts District in 2024.

<text>Ricochet firing is the firing of artillery at a low angle and non-maximal power so as to cause the shells to skip across the ground.
==Background==
In traditional artillery tactics, either a cannon, a howitzer or occasionally a mortar would fire a shot that would just clear the outer parapet of a fortification, and then would bounce or ricochet inside the fortification&#x27;s bounds. One of the primary purposes of ricochet fire was to dismount artillery and guns positioned on an enemy&#x27;s fortifications. Additionally, ricochet fire could also be used to cause chaos behind an enemy army&#x27;s fortifications, as the ricocheting cannonball would devastate logistical structures not fortified to withstand cannon fire.

The first European use of ricochet fire (&quot;tir à ricochet&quot;) has been accredited to the Marquis de Vauban during the siege of Philippsburg in 1688. He perfected it at the siege of Ath in 1697.

<doc id="866794" wikidata="Q2733342" url="?curid=866794" title="London Clay">
<text>The London Clay Formation is a marine geological formation of Ypresian (early Eocene Epoch, c. 54-50 million years ago) age which crops out in the southeast of England. The London Clay is well known for its fossil content. The fossils from the lower Eocene rocks indicate a moderately warm climate, the tropical or subtropical flora. Though sea levels changed during the deposition of the clay, the habitat was generally a lush forest – perhaps like in Indonesia or East Africa today – bordering a warm, shallow ocean.

The London Clay is a stiff bluish clay which becomes brown when weathered and oxidized. Nodular lumps of pyrite are frequently found in the clay layers. Pyrite was produced by microbial activity (sulfate reducing bacteria) during clay sedimentation. Once clay is exposed to atmospheric oxygen, framboidal pyrite with a great specific surface is rapidly oxidized. Pyrite oxidation produces insoluble brown iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) and sulfuric acid leading to the formation of relatively soluble gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O, calcium sulfate dihydrate). This latter is more soluble and mobile than iron oxides and can further recrystallize to form larger crystals sometimes called selenite (coming from the moon, but not related to selenium, although the etymology is the same), or &quot;waterstones&quot;. 

Large septarian concretions, produced by microbial activity (oxidation of organic matter) in the ancient seafloor during clay early diagenesis, are also common. These have been used in the past for making cement. They were once dug for this purpose at Sheppey, near Sittingbourne, and at Harwich, and also dredged, off the Hampshire coast. The clay is still used commercially for making bricks, tiles, and coarse pottery in places such as Michelmersh in Hampshire.

==Distribution and geology==
The London Clay is well developed in the London Basin, where it thins westwards from around in Essex and north Kent to around in Wiltshire. It is not frequently exposed as it is to a great extent covered by more recent Neogene sediments and Pleistocene gravel deposits. One location of particular interest is Oxshott Heath, where the overlying sand and the London Clay layers are exposed as a sand escarpment, rising approximately . This supported a thriving brick industry in the area until the 1960s. The London Clay is also well developed in the Hampshire Basin, where an exposure thick occurs at Whitecliff Bay on the Isle of Wight and around is spread along of foreshore at Bognor Regis, West Sussex.

The clay was deposited in a sea up to deep at the eastern end. Up to five cycles of deposition (representing transgression followed by shallowing of the sea) have been found, most markedly at the shallower, western end. Each cycle begins with coarser material (sometimes including rounded flint pebbles), followed by clay which becomes increasingly sandy. The final cycle ends with the Claygate Beds.

===Claygate Beds=== 
The youngest part of the London Clay, known as the &quot;Claygate Beds&quot; or &quot;Claygate Member&quot; forms a transition between the clay and the sandier Bagshot Beds above. This is shown separately on many geological maps, and often caps hills. It is up to thick at Claygate, Surrey. It is now believed to be diachronous, with the formation at Claygate for example being the same age as the end of the fourth cycle of deposition further east.

==Engineering==
The presence of a thick layer of London Clay underneath London itself, providing a soft yet stable environment for tunnelling, was instrumental in the early development of the London Underground, although this is also the reason why London had no true skyscraper buildings, at least to the same degree as many other cities throughout the world. Erecting tall buildings in London required very deep, large and costly piled foundations. This has changed in recent decades due to the development of &#x27;plunge piles&#x27;. London&#x27;s skyscrapers float on rafts embedded in the clay.

London Clay is highly susceptible to volumetric changes depending upon its moisture content. During exceptionally dry periods or where the moisture is extracted by tree root activity, the clay can become desiccated and shrink in volume, and conversely swell again when the moisture content is restored. This can lead to many problems near the ground surface, including structural movement and fracturing of buildings, fractured sewers and service pipes/ducts and uneven and damaged road surfaces and pavings. Such damage is recognised to be covered by the interpretation of subsidence in buildings insurance policies, and the periods of dry weather in 1976/77 and 1988/92, in particular, led to a host of insurance claims. As a result, many insurance companies have now increased the cost of premiums for buildings located in the most susceptible areas where damage occurred, where the clay is close to the surface.

London Clay is also used to line exhausted quarries. This is because old quarry holes are generally refilled with waste material and by lining it with London Clay (which is virtually impermeable) it prevents waste and hazardous substances from entering the groundwater. 

===Tunnels in London Clay===
London Clay is an ideal medium for boring tunnels, which is one reason why the London Underground railway network expanded very quickly north of the River Thames. However, south of the Thames, the stratum at tube level is composed of water-bearing sand and gravel (not good for tunnelling) with London Clay below, which partly explains why there are very few tube tunnels south of the Thames. London Clay has a stand-up time long enough to enable support to be installed without urgency. It is also almost waterproof, resulting in virtually no seepage of groundwater into the tunnel. It is over-consolidated, which means that it was once subject to an overburden pressure higher than it is subjected to today, and expands upon excavation, thus gradually loading the support, i.e. it is not necessary to stress the support against the ground.

==Uses==
Due to its impermeability especially when exposed by ploughing, London Clay does not make good agricultural soil. In Middlesex, ploughing London Clay land so deep that it brings up clay has historically been called &quot;ploughing up poison&quot;.

It was also disliked for building houses on, though inevitably most of Greater London is built on it. Jane Ellen Panton in her &quot;Suburban Residences and How To Circumvent Them&quot; (1896), remarks: &quot;I do not believe clay is or even can be fit for anyone to reside upon ... though roses flourished magnificently children didn&#x27;t, and coughs and colds [lasted through autumn and winter, this at Shortlands&quot;.

Many London buildings have ultimately been constructed with London Clay. When compressed and burnt, London Clay can be fashioned into brick known as London stock, identifiable by its yellowish brown hue.

==Fossil flora and fauna==
Plant fossils, especially seeds and fruits, are found in abundance and have been collected from the London Clay for almost 300 years. Some 350 named species of plant have been found, making the London Clay flora one of the world&#x27;s most diverse for fossil seeds and fruits. The flora includes plant types found today in tropical forests of Asia and demonstrates the much warmer climate of the Eocene epoch, with plants such as &quot;Nypa&quot; (Nipah palms) and other palms being frequently encountered.

Notable coastal exposures from which fossils can be collected are on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent and Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex, in the London Basin, and Bognor Regis in the Hampshire Basin.

<doc id="866799" wikidata="Q287253" url="?curid=866799" title="Osedax">
<text>Osedax is a genus of deep-sea siboglinid polychaetes, commonly called boneworms, zombie worms, or bone-eating worms. &quot;Osedax&quot; is Latin for &quot;bone-eater&quot;. The name alludes to how the worms bore into the bones of whale carcasses to reach enclosed lipids, on which they rely for sustenance. They utilize specialized root tissues for bone-boring. It is possible that multiple species of &quot;Osedax&quot; reside in the same bone. &quot;Osedax&quot; worms are also known to feed on the collagen itself by making holes in the whale&#x27;s skeletal structure. These holes can also serve as a form of protection from nearby predators.

Scientists from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute using the submarine ROV &quot;Tiburon&quot; first discovered the genus in Monterey Bay, California, in February 2002. The worms were found living on the bones of a decaying gray whale in the Monterey Canyon, at a depth of .

==Anatomy and physiology==
&quot;Osedax&quot; are colorful tubeworms that have no mouth, anus, or gut. The body is divided into different regions: trunk, ovisac, and root. They range in length between , although this varies between species (cite). Sexual dimorphism is observed in &quot;Osedax&quot; with females &gt;20,000 times larger than males.

=== Digestive system ===
&quot;Osedax&quot; rely on symbiotic species of bacteria that aid in the digestion of whale proteins and lipids and release nutrients that the worms can absorb. &quot;Osedax&quot; have colorful feathery plumes that also act as gills and unusual root-like structures that absorb nutrients. The &quot;Osedax&quot; secrete acid (rather than rely on teeth) to bore into bone to access the nutrients. High concentrations of carbonic anhydrase are found in the roots of &quot;Osedax.&quot; This serves as evidence of a common bioerosion mechanism in which secreted acid is produced by anaerobic respiration. This process works with a demineralization mechanism in which oxygen is carried from seawater to the roots and HCO is secreted into the seawater.

The epidermis also plays key roles in bone deterioration and nutrient uptake. This process of bone deterioration occurs through a symbiotic relationship with an endosymbiotic bacteria. The cells in the epidermis of the &quot;Osedax&quot; root region are responsible for the secretion of digestive enzymes. The epidermis also has an expanded microvillus border which increases the surface area.

Through the use of X-ray CT technology, scans showed that borings made by &quot;Osedax mucofloris&quot; were hemi-ellipsoidal in shape. Boring depths varied depending on which bone was colonized by the &quot;O. mucofloris&quot;. Deeper borings were found in radius bone compared to the ulna and vertebrae.

&quot;Osedax&quot; roots are covered by a mucus sheath that helps protect the worm&#x27;s trunk. Some studies support the theory that this sheath plays a role in dissolving the bone. This sheath could also play an important role in reducing the damage to &quot;Osedax&quot; skin by absorbing harmful acid. Another potential function of the mucus sheath is that it could inhibit the breakdown of the worm&#x27;s bone matrix. This is significant because the bone matrix is integral in maintaining the worm&#x27;s position while in direct contact with a bone.

=== Sexual dimorphism ===
Osedax males are notably smaller than their female counterparts. Between 50 and 100 microscopic dwarf males live inside the tube surrounding a single female and never develop past the larval stage; they produce sperm from yolk reserves. Male dwarfism prevents competition with female &quot;Osedax&quot; worms for food and space. Conditions that favour dwarfism in male Osedax are:

# Eliminates competition between male and female &quot;Osedax&quot; as resources are limited,
# Sessile lifestyle: attach to and rely on females for food,
# Decreases difficulty in finding a mate.

Interestingly, &quot;Osedax priapus&quot; lack the frequently observed male dwarfism. Males live freely and compete for space and food with females. Being larger, they produce and carry more sperm. However, sexual size dimorphism is still observed in &quot;O. priapus&quot;: most males are one-third the volume of females.

==Reproduction==

=== Discoveries ===
Female &quot;Osedax&quot; worms have been observed spawning both in the wild and in laboratory aquaria. &quot;Osedax rubiplumus&quot; can spawn hundreds of oocytes at a time. They are already fertilized when they are released from the female worm. The worms&#x27; endosymbionts, species of bacteria in the order Oceanospirillales, were not observed in the spawned oocytes, which suggests that they are acquired after the worms settle on the bones. In the adult, the bacteria are localised in the root-like structures that grow into the whale bone. This worm appears to be highly fecund and reproduces continuously. This may help explain why &quot;Osedax&quot; is such a diverse genus, despite the rarity of whale falls in the ocean.

Male &quot;Osedax&quot; are microscopic dwarfs that live as &quot;harems&quot; inside the lumen of the gelatinous tube that surrounds each female. An individual female can house hundreds of these males in her tube.

Following its discovery in 2002 by researchers at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, the genus was announced in &quot;Science&quot; in 2004.

In late 2005, an experiment by Swedish marine biologists resulted in the discovery of a species of the worm in the North Sea off the west coast of Sweden. In the experiment, a minke whale carcass that had been washed ashore had been sunk to a depth of and monitored for several months. Biologists were surprised to find that, unlike the previous discoveries, the new species, colloquially known as &quot;bone-eating snot flower&quot; after its scientific name (&quot;Osedax mucofloris&quot;), lived in relatively shallow waters.

In November 2009, researchers reported finding as many as 15 species of boneworms living in Monterey Bay on the California coast.

=== Sex determination ===
Annelid sex is typically determined by genetic factors, however models of environmental sex determination have been proposed for &quot;Osedax&quot;, in which larvae that settle on bones mature into females, while larvae that settle on female &quot;Osedax&quot; do not fully develop and mature into males. &quot;O. japonicus&quot; in particular has showcased an environmental form of sex determination.

=== Life cycle ===

* Mature female &quot;Osedax&quot; worms spawn eggs into the mucus attached to their tubes, where the embryos develop for 3 days.
* Larvae then begin to swim in the water column. This is called the trochophore stage. The larvae settle on whale bones and begin crawling. 
* During the trocophore stage, male &quot;Osedax&quot; settle on the tubes of the females, where they are metamorphosed into dwarf males, which can be inside or outside the female tube. 
* 1 day after settling on bones, larvae use two pairs of chaetae to attach to the substrate. Juvenile worms begin to secrete mucus and develop two ventral palps on the dorsal side of the prostomium.
* 2 days after settling, the palps elongate and the heart starts to beat. The roots attach to the bones begin to digest. 
* 4 days after settling, the trunk and ventral palps elongate, where symbiotic bacteria are detected in the root. 
* 7 days after settlement, pinnules extend from the ventral palps. 
* 10 days post settlement, the juvenile worms have 4 palps with pinnules, an oviduct, and a distinct root system.

== Symbiosis ==
Symbionts are the primary providers of nutrition for &quot;Osedax.&quot; However, these symbionts also possess genes, secretion systems, and toxins that disrupt the &quot;Osedax&quot; membrane and facilitate recurrent infections of adult &quot;Osedax&quot; through the root tips. There is ongoing debate in the literature over whether the symbiosis in &quot;Osedax&quot; roots is commensal or mutualistic. The symbiotic relationship between &quot;Osedax&quot; and its accompanying bacteria may be transferred either via vertical or horizontal transmission.

&quot;Osedax&quot; species use collagen, which is the primary organic component in bone. Collagen is degraded using a family of endopeptidases called matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which facilitates nutrient absorption by the &quot;Osedax&quot;. The roots of the &quot;Osedax&quot; express high amounts of V-ATPase and carbonic anhydrase enzymes, which allows the &quot;Osedax&quot; to dissolve and absorb collagen and lipids. Once dissolved, the nutrients are either used by the &quot;Osedax&quot;, or transported to the symbionts for further catabolism.

As the endosymbionts lack secreted M9 peptidase, they rely on the &quot;Osedax&quot; worm to source extracellular collagen. The symbionts in the &quot;Oceanospirillales&quot; order have then been observed to further process the collagen using collagenolytic enzymes.

Sequencing of the &quot;Osedax&quot; worm genome has suggested an evolved dependency on its endosymbionts. This is revealed by genomic streamlining, where increased functional groups were observed despite the loss of some gene families. Six incomplete pathways were discovered in the &quot;Osedax&quot; worm genome which were supplemented by the endosymbionts. In particular, the &quot;Osedax&quot; worm lacks specific gene families involved in bone lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. This function is complemented by the &quot;Oceanospirillales&quot; symbionts, which utilize the glyoxylate cycle to catabolize nutrients from whale bones and convert fatty acids into carbohydrates. The &quot;Osedax&quot; are then able to take up and store the end products as glycogen. Bacteriocytes are present in the &quot;Osedax&quot; lower trunk subepidermal connective tissue, and there are additional genes in the bacteriocytes that encode amino acids and glucose and aid in digestion and absorption of proteins into the roots.

=== Endosymbionts ===
The &quot;Oceanospirillales&quot; symbionts are found in the specialized roots of all &quot;Osedax&quot; species,  and play a major role in accelerating the degradation process of bones, as well as facilitating nutrient uptake for the &quot;Osedax&quot;. &quot;Oceanospirillales&quot; are known for their ability to degrade complex organic compounds.

&quot;Campylobacterales&quot; are abundant along the trunk of the &quot;Osedax&quot; according to a 2023 study. Different genera in this order are found in &quot;Osedax&quot; at different points during the whale&#x27;s degradation:

# Members of the &quot;Arcobacter&quot; genus are the primary early colonizers (&lt;24 months).
# &quot;Sulfurospirillum&quot; genus members colonize at ~50 months, during the transitional stages of organic carbon breakdown.
# The &quot;Sulfurimonas&quot; genus dominates at &gt;140 months, and are key players in its symbiosis with the &quot;Osedax&quot; host.

The &quot;Sulfurimonas&quot; genus in particular protects the &quot;Osedax&quot; worms from potentially harmful by-products produced at &gt;140 months of the whale fall degradation. The &quot;Sulfurimonas&quot; bacteria house the type II and IV genes that encode enzymes to oxidize and assimilate sulfide. These reactions prevent the host from absorbing toxic by-products across the epithelial barrier.

==Niche==

The role of &quot;Osedax&quot; in the degradation of marine vertebrate remains controversial. Some scientists think that &quot;Osedax&quot; is a specialist on whalebones while others think that it is more of a generalist. This controversy is due to a biogeographic paradox: despite the rarity and ephemeral nature of whale falls, &quot;Osedax&quot; has a broad biogeographic range and is surprisingly diverse.

One hypothesis advanced to explain this seeming paradox is that &quot;Osedax&quot; are able to colonize a variety of vertebrate remains besides whalebones. One study documented 14 new &quot;Osedax&quot; species successfully colonizing the bones of teleost fish, sea turtles, seals, cows, and turkeys, in addition to whales, while a later study documented a new species feeding on the bones of alligators. &quot;Osedax&quot; have also been observed colonizing terrestrial mammal bones mixed in with galley waste from a surface vessel. Other scientists have countered this hypothesis by pointing out how the cow bone experiment does not match any natural habitat and also the low probability of terrestrial mammal bones arriving at the ocean floor in significant quantities. They also point out other cases of food falls in which the remains disappeared too swiftly for &quot;Osedax&quot; colonization and the lack of any observed colonization in similar cases.

The true role of &quot;Osedax&quot; in the degradation of marine vertebrate remains is important to marine vertebrate taphonomy. Burrows closely similar to those made by &quot;Osedax&quot; species have been found in the bones of ancient marine birds and plesiosaurs, suggesting that the genus may once have had a wider range of foods.
 In a study of the boring morphological diversity of Osedax, it was shown that the species difference of bone-boring is highly variable; within the same species, the boring morphology is only consistent in a particular bone, but not consistent in different bones. It was also suggested that multiple species of Osedax can co-exist in the same bone and in an incomplete spatial niche differentiation.

The presence of &quot;Osedax&quot; and their borings welcome other species such as &quot;Stephonyx&quot; amphipods, &quot;Paralomis&quot; crabs, and &quot;Rubyspira&quot; gastropods. As &quot;Osedax&quot; worms break down bone and lipid layers, fauna take advantage and colonize these bone matrices. Overall, the borings made by &quot;Osedax&quot; have shown to enhance biodiversity and the worms should, therefore, be considered ecosystem engineers. The downside of the deterioration caused by &quot;Osedax&quot; is that it speeds up the process of erosion, therefore only allowing this new fauna their new habitats for a temporary period.

== Evolution ==
The oldest trace fossils on bones characteristic of &quot;Osedax&quot; are from a plesiosaur humerus from the Cambridge Greensand, England, likely reworked from late Albian (c. 100 million years old) sediments and a rib and costal plate from a sea turtle found in Cenomanian (100–93 million years ago) aged sediments of the Chalk Group, England. Further material is known from the Campanian and Maastrichtian. Following the extinction of almost all large marine reptiles at the end of the Cretaceous, &quot;Osedax&quot; likely persisted on the bones of sea turtles and fish. Given that &quot;Osedax&quot; have the generalist ability to feed on different vertebrates (fishes, marine birds, whale bones).

In terms of evolutionary history research, the &quot;Osedax&quot; could have had negative impact in preserving fossil record because its appearance at the shelf-depth combined with its ability to efficiently break down marine vertebrates skeletons.

<text>In biochemistry, medicine, and related sciences, inositol generally refers to myo&quot;-inositol(formerly meso&quot;-inositol), the most important stereoisomer of the chemical compound cyclohexane-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexol. Its formula is ; the molecule has a ring of six carbon atoms, each with an hydrogen atom and a hydroxyl group (–OH). In &quot;myo&quot;-inositol, two of the hydroxyls, neither adjacent not opposite, lie above the respective hydrogens relative to the mean plane of the ring.

The compound is a carbohydrate, specifically a sugar alcohol (as distinct from aldoses like glucose) with half the sweetness of sucrose (table sugar). It is one of the most ancient components of living beings with multiple functions in eukaryotes, including structural lipids and secondary messengers. A human kidney makes about two grams per day from glucose, but other tissues synthesize it too. The highest concentration is in the brain, where it plays an important role in making other neurotransmitters and some steroid hormones bind to their receptors. In other tissues, it mediates cell signal transduction in response to a variety of hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors and participates in osmoregulation. In most mammalian cells the concentrations of &quot;myo&quot;-inositol are 5 to 500 times greater inside cells than outside them.

A 2023 meta-analysis found that inositol is a safe and effective treatment in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, there is only evidence of very low quality for its efficacy in increasing fertility for IVF in women with PCOS.

The other naturally occurring stereoisomers of cyclohexane-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexol are &quot;scyllo&quot;-, &quot;muco&quot;-, -&quot;chiro&quot;-, -&quot;chiro&quot;-, and &quot;neo&quot;-inositol, although they occur in minimal quantities compared to &quot;myo&quot;-inositol. The other possible isomers are &quot;allo&quot;-, &quot;epi&quot;-, and &quot;cis&quot;-inositol.

==History==
&quot;myo&quot;-Inositol was first isolated from muscle extracts by Johanes Joseph Scherer (1814–1869) in 1850. It was formerly called &quot;meso&quot;-inositol to distinguish it from the &quot;chiro&quot;- isomers. However, since all other isomers are meso (non-chiral) compounds, the name &quot;myo&quot;-inositol is now preferred (&quot;myo&quot;- being a medical prefix for &quot;muscle&quot;).

Inositol was once considered a member of the vitamin B complex, namely vitamin B8 before the discovery that it is made naturally in the human body, and therefore cannot be a vitamin or essential nutrient.

==Chemical properties==
&quot;myo&quot;-Inositol is a meso compound, meaning it is optically inactive because it has a plane of symmetry. It is a white crystalline powder, relatively stable in the air. It is highly soluble in water, slightly soluble in glacial acetic acid, ethanol, glycol, and glycerin, but insoluble in chloroform and ether.

In its most stable conformation, the &quot;myo&quot;-inositol isomer assumes the chair conformation, which moves the maximum number of hydroxyls to the equatorial position, where they are farthest apart from each other. In this conformation, the natural &quot;myo&quot; isomer has a structure in which five of the six hydroxyls (the first, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth) are equatorial, whereas the second hydroxyl group is axial.

==Physiological roles==
&quot;myo&quot;-Inositol plays an important role as the structural basis for a number of secondary messengers in eukaryotic cells, the various inositol phosphates. In addition, inositol serves as an important component of the structural lipids phosphatidylinositol (PI) and its various phosphates, the phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) lipids.

==Biosynthesis==
In humans, &quot;myo&quot;-Inositol is synthesized &quot;de novo&quot; but -&quot;chiro&quot;-inositol is not. &quot;myo&quot;-Inositol is synthesized from glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) in two steps. First, G6P is isomerised by an inositol-3-phosphate synthase enzyme (for example, ISYNA1) to &quot;myo&quot;-inositol 1-phosphate, which is then dephosphorylated by an inositol monophosphatase enzyme (for example, IMPA1) to give free &quot;myo&quot;-inositol. In humans, most inositol is synthesized in the kidneys, followed by testicles, typically in amounts of a few grams per day.

At the peripheral level, &quot;myo&quot;-inositol is converted to -&quot;chiro&quot;-inositol by a specific epimerase. Only a minor fraction of &quot;myo&quot;-inositol is converted into -&quot;chiro&quot;-inositol. The activity of this epimerase is insulin dependent, causing a reduction of -&quot;chiro&quot;-inositol in muscle, fat, and liver when there is insulin resistance. -&quot;chiro&quot;-inositol reduces the conversion of testosterone to estrogen, thereby increases the levels of testosterone and worsening PCOS.

===Phytic acid in plants===

Inositol hexaphosphate, also called phytic acid or IP6, is a phytochemical and the principal storage form of phosphorus in many plant tissues, especially bran and seed. Phosphorus and inositol in phytate form are not generally bioavailable to non-ruminant animals because these animals lack the digestive enzyme phytase required to remove the phosphate groups. Ruminants readily digest phytate because of the phytase produced by microorganisms in the rumen. Moreover, phytic acid also chelates important minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc, making them unabsorbable, and contributing to mineral deficiencies in people whose diets rely highly on bran and seeds for their mineral intake, such as occurs in developing countries.

Inositol penta- (IP5), tetra- (IP4), and triphosphate (IP3) are also called &quot;phytates&quot;.

Inositol or its phosphates and associated lipids are found in many foods, in particular fruit, especially cantaloupe and oranges. In plants, the hexaphosphate of inositol, phytic acid or its salts, the phytates, serve as phosphate stores in seed, for example in nuts and beans. Phytic acid also occurs in cereals with high bran content. Phytate is, however, not directly bioavailable to humans in the diet, since it is not digestible. Some food preparation techniques partly break down phytates to change this. However, inositol in the form of phospholipids, as found in certain plant-derived substances such as lecithins, is well absorbed and relatively bioavailable.

==Biological function==
Inositol, phosphatidylinositol, and some of their mono- and polyphosphates function as secondary messengers in a number of intracellular signal transduction pathways. They are involved in a number of biological processes, including:
* Insulin signal transduction
* Cytoskeleton assembly
* Nerve guidance (epsin)
* Intracellular calcium (Ca2+) concentration control
* Cell membrane potential maintenance
* Breakdown of fats
* Gene expression
In one important family of pathways, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is stored in cellular membranes until it is released by any of a number of signalling proteins and transformed into various secondary messengers, for example diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate.

&quot;&#x27;myo&quot;-Inositol has very low toxicity, with a reported LD50 10,000 mg/kg body weight (oral) in rats.

==Industrial uses==

===Explosives industry===
At the 1936 meeting of the American Chemical Society, professor Edward Bartow of the University of Iowa presented a commercially viable means of extracting large amounts of inositol from the phytic acid naturally present in waste corn. As a possible use for the chemical, he suggested &#x27;inositol nitrate&#x27; as a more stable alternative to nitroglycerin. Today, inositol nitrate is used to gelatinize nitrocellulose in many modern explosives and solid rocket propellants.

===Road salt===
When plants are exposed to increasing concentrations of road salt, the plant cells become dysfunctional and undergo apoptosis, leading to inhibited growth. Inositol pretreatment could reduce these effects.

==Research and clinical applications==

===Trichotillomania===
High doses of inositol may be used to treat trichotillomania (compulsive hair-pulling) and related disorders.

===Other illnesses===
D-&quot;chiro&quot;-inositol is an important messenger molecule in insulin signaling. Inositol supplementation has been shown to significantly decrease triglycerides and LDL cholesterol in patients with metabolic diseases.

&quot;myo&quot;-Inositol is important for thyroid hormone synthesis. Depletion of &quot;myo&quot;-inositol may predispose to development of hypothyroidism. Patients with hypothyroidism have a higher demand for &quot;myo&quot;-inositol than healthy subjects.

Inositol should not be routinely implemented for the management of preterm babies who have or are at a risk of infant respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). &quot;Myo&quot;-inositol helps prevent neural tube defects with particular efficacy in combination with folic acid.

Inositol is considered a safe and effective treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It works by increasing insulin sensitivity, which helps to improve ovarian function and reduce hyperandrogenism. It is also shown to reduce the risk of metabolic disease in women with PCOS. In addition, thanks to its role as FSH second messenger, &quot;myo&quot;-inositol is effective in restoring FSH/LH ratio and menstrual cycle regularization. &quot;myo&quot;-Inositol&#x27;s role as FSH second messenger leads to a correct ovarian follicle maturation and consequently to a higher oocyte quality. Improving the oocyte quality in both women with or without PCOS, &quot;myo&quot;-inositol can be considered as a possible approach for increasing the chance of success in assisted reproductive technologies. In contrast, -&quot;chiro&quot;-inositol can impair oocyte quality in a dose-dependent manner. The high level of DCI seems to be related to elevated insulin levels retrieved in about 70% of PCOS women. In this regard, insulin stimulates the irreversible conversion of &quot;myo&quot;-inositol to -&quot;chiro&quot;-inositol causing a drastic reduction of &quot;myo&quot;-inositol. &quot;myo&quot;-Inositol depletion is particularly damaging to ovarian follicles because it is involved in FSH signaling, which is impaired due to &quot;myo&quot;-inositol depletion. Recent evidence reports a faster improvement of the metabolic and hormonal parameters when these two isomers are administered in their physiological ratio. The plasmatic ratio of &quot;myo&quot;-inositol and -&quot;chiro&quot;-inositol in healthy subjects is 40:1 of &quot;myo&quot;- and -&quot;chiro&quot;-inositol respectively. The use of the 40:1 ratio shows the same efficacy of &quot;myo&quot;-inositol alone but in a shorter time. In addition, the physiological ratio does not impair oocyte quality.

The use of inositols in PCOS is gaining more importance, and an efficacy higher than 70% with a strong safety profile is reported. On the other hand, about 30% of patients could show as inositol-resistant. New evidence regarding PCOS aetiopathogenesis describes an alteration in the species and the quantity of each strain characterizing the normal gastrointestinal flora. This alteration could lead to chronic, low-level inflammation and malabsorption. A possible solution could be represented by the combination of &quot;myo&quot;-inositol and α-lactalbumin. This combination shows a synergic effect in increasing myo-inositol absorption. A recent study reported that the &quot;myo&quot;-inositol and α-lactalbumin combination increases &quot;myo&quot;-inositol plasmatic content in inositol-resistant patients with a relative improvement of hormonal and metabolic parameters.

==Use as a cutting agent==
Inositol has been used as an adulterant or cutting agent for many illegal drugs, such as cocaine, methamphetamine, and sometimes heroin, probably because of its solubility, powdery texture, or reduced sweetness (50%) compared to more common sugars.

Inositol is also used as a stand-in film prop for cocaine in filmmaking.

==Nutritional sources==
&quot;myo&quot;-Inositol is naturally present in a variety of foods, although tables of food composition do not always distinguish between lecithin, the relatively bioavailable lipid form and the biounavailable phytate/phosphate form. Foods containing the highest concentrations of &quot;myo&quot;-inositol and its compounds include fruits, beans, grains, and nuts. Fruits in particular, especially oranges and cantaloupe, contain the highest amounts of &quot;myo&quot;-inositol. It is also present in beans, nuts, and grains, however, these contain large amounts of &quot;myo&quot;-inositol in the phytate form, which is not bioavailable without transformation by phytase enzymes. &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot;, the microorganism which produces the fermented food natto, produces phytase enzymes that may convert phytic acid to a more bioavailable form of inositol polyphosphate in the gut. Additionally, &quot;Bacteroides&quot; species in the gut secrete vesicles containing an active enzyme which converts the phytate molecule into bioavailable phosphorus and inositol polyphosphate, which is an important signaling molecule in the human body.

&quot;myo&quot;-Inositol can also be found as an ingredient in energy drinks, either in conjunction with or as a substitute for glucose.

In humans, myo-inositol is naturally made from glucose-6-phosphate through enzymatic dephosphorylation.

==Production==
As of 2021, the main industrial process for the production of &quot;myo&quot;-inositol (mostly in China and Japan) started with phytate (IP6) extracted from the soaking water resulting from corn and rice bran processing. After purification, the phytate is hydrolized, and &quot;myo&quot;-inositol is separated by crystallization.

Another route is microbial fermentation of carbohydrates by various organisms, such as the fungus &quot;Neurospora crassa&quot; (Beadle and Tatum, 1945), &quot;Candida boidini&quot; (Shirai et al., 1997), &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; (Culbertson et al., 1976), &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; (Hansen, 1999). Alternatively, enzyme extracts from microbial cultures can be used in vitro to obtain &quot;myo&quot;-inositol from various substrates, including glucose, sucrose, starch, xylose, and amylose.

<text>Donna De Lory is an American singer, dancer and songwriter. Part of a musical family, De Lory has been performing since a young age. Her voice can be heard on albums by Carly Simon, Ray Parker Jr., Kim Carnes, Santana, Martika, Laura Branigan, Belinda Carlisle, Selena, Bette Midler, Barry Manilow, Mylène Farmer, Alisha and Madonna. De Lory accompanied Madonna as backing vocalist and dancer on every concert from the Who&#x27;s That Girl Tour in 1987, up to the Confessions Tour in 2006. Her performance with Madonna at the Live Earth 2007 concert in London was their final professional collaboration to date.

==Early life==
Donna De Lory was born September 10 ,1964 in Calabasas, California to record producer/musician Al De Lory and Mary Helyn Soncini.

De Lory has been surrounded by music ever since she was born. The De Lory family is very musical and is well known in the music industry. Her father played piano, electronic organ, and harpsichord on The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; album. He was a producer at Capitol Records and was responsible, among other things, for producing Glen Campbell&#x27;s &#x27;&quot;golden era&quot;. In addition, he co-wrote the 1960 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 #1 novelty hit for Larry Verne, &quot;Mr. Custer.&quot; Her grandfather played upright bass and cello for the Warner Bros. Studios Orchestra, recording the scores of classic movies such as &quot;Casablanca&quot; and &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. Her mother was a singer and dancer. Donna&#x27;s older brother Alan, known as A.D. DeLory, is also a singer and songwriter. De Lory&#x27;s late older sister Jolene sang background vocals on the 1973 Carpenters single &quot;Sing&quot;.

De Lory made her professional singing debut at age eight singing a Recipe dog food commercial. She sang on children&#x27;s albums for Walt Disney and was heard on the tune &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World&quot;, featured on a ride at Disneyland and Disney World. She also sang on commercials for McDonald&#x27;s, Mattel, and Eastman Kodak. In addition, she contributed vocals to projects by Kim Carnes, Barry Manilow, Santana and the &quot;Rocky II&quot; soundtrack.

She moved to Nashville with her father and brother at the age of 16 following the death of her mother from breast cancer in 1980. Her father found a professional home in Nashville&#x27;s Music Row area as a producer for Capitol Records. She started working at a vegetarian restaurant and from there, became a vegetarian. De Lory made friends with a few songwriters and became inspired by seeing how much effort they put into their work. She started spending a lot of her time on writing songs and recording demos before going back to California after finishing Hillsboro High School to study dancing, singing and acting.

==Career==

===Madonna===
De Lory first came to the public&#x27;s attention as Madonna&#x27;s backup singer. In 1985, Gardner Cole, then De Lory&#x27;s boyfriend, wrote the song &quot;Open Your Heart&quot; which Madonna would later record. At the time Madonna&#x27;s management was looking for material for her &quot;True Blue&quot; album, and Cole submitted three songs, including &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;. Madonna&#x27;s manager heard the song and thought it would be a hit for Madonna, so he asked Cole to re-record the song with a female voice. De Lory recorded the song, and Cole then submitted the recording to Madonna&#x27;s producer Patrick Leonard. Madonna listened to the recording and decided to record the song. Leonard liked De Lory&#x27;s voice and hired her to sing backup on future projects he produced. When Madonna was looking for backup singers for her 1987 Who&#x27;s That Girl Tour, De Lory asked Leonard to take her to the auditions. De Lory got the job and toured with Madonna on all her world tours until 2007. De Lory also sang backup on many of Madonna&#x27;s songs.

===Solo career===
In 1990, she recorded the song &quot;Always Thinking of You&quot; for the film &quot;Three Men and a Little Lady&quot;. Her self-titled debut album was released on MCA Records in late 1992. The first single off the album, &quot;Praying For Love&quot;, was released 20 October 1992 and went to #1 on the charts in Japan. The second single, &quot;Just A Dream&quot;, was released 9 March 1993 and was a top 10 hit on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. It peaked at #71 in the UK Singles Chart in July 1993. &quot;Just A Dream&quot; was written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard and was originally recorded by Madonna for her 1989 &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; album. De Lory&#x27;s version incorporated backing vocals by Madonna. The third and final single off the album, &quot;Think It Over&quot;, was released 27 July 1993.

She recorded a second album titled &quot;Songs &#x27;95&quot; and had plans to release it in 1995, but it remained unreleased until 2002. She left the MCA label in late 1994 because her growing interest in world music was starting to show in her own music, much to the dismay of her label who wanted her to keep making pop music. At around this time she was introduced to the Harmonium, an instrument she has been using ever since. She was given the instrument at a party and she learned to play it by herself. She toured France as a backup singer and dancer for Mylène Farmer in 1996 and appears on the live CD/DVD Live à Bercy.

She formed the band Bliss together with cellist Cameron Stone in 1997, whom she was introduced to at the recommendation of her drummer, and released the album &quot;Love Never Dies&quot;. However, they decided to rename the album to &quot;Bliss&quot; and bill it to De Lory&#x27;s name because there already were too many other bands with Bliss in their name and De Lory already had name recognition from her first album and her work with Madonna. The second version of the album billed to Donna&#x27;s name included new album artwork and the song &quot;Where I&#x27;ve Never Been&quot; which was not on the first version. The name Bliss came from the saying &quot;follow your bliss&quot; which is from one of Donna&#x27;s favorite authors, Joseph Campbell. De Lory and Stone built a fully equipped 24-track digital studio in her garage, then packed it up and took it in a U-Haul to a cabin in Taos, New Mexico, where most of the material for the album was created. They spent most of 1997 working on the album and finished it by the end of the year. The album was released in early 1998. Cameron Stone also worked on all of her subsequent albums, such as the 2003 album &quot;In The Glow&quot;. De Lory&#x27;s 2004 album, &quot;The Lover &amp; The Beloved&quot;, was a Sanskrit and English CD released on the Ajna Music label.

De Lory performed Princess Elise&#x27;s theme, &quot;My Destiny&quot;, in the 2006 game &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. Her reinterpretation of Joseph Arthur&#x27;s, &quot;In the Sun&quot; was featured at the end of episode 5 of NBC&#x27;s drama &quot;Life&quot;. Her version of Madonna&#x27;s song &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; appeared in the 2010 film, &quot;The Switch.&quot;

In 2010, De Lory contributed the song &quot;Bathe in These Waters&quot; to the Yoga Revolution compilation album, a benefit release supporting yoga and fitness programs for underserved schools.

In 2013, De Lory announced via her Twitter account that she would be releasing a new album titled &quot;The Unchanging&quot;. It was released worldwide on iTunes on 27 August 2013 and made #2 on the World Music Album chart. De Lory combines her melodic vocals and world music influences, but predominantly sings in English. Her former singing partner Niki Haris also features on the track &quot;Kinder&quot; along with Tina Malia. The album also includes a reinterpretation of her single &quot;Praying for Love&quot; and her take on &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;. In 2016, De Lory teamed up with Haris to record a cover version of Madonna&#x27;s 1993 single &quot;Rain&quot;, to which they originally had sung backing vocals.

<text>Anegada is the northernmost of the British Virgin Islands (BVI), a group of islands that form part of the archipelago of the Virgin Islands. It lies approximately north of Virgin Gorda. Anegada is the only inhabited British Virgin Island formed from coral and limestone, rather than being of volcanic origin. While the other islands are mountainous, Anegada is flat and low. Its highest point is only about above sea level, earning it its name, which is the Spanish term for the flooded land, &quot;tierra anegada&quot;.

Additionally, Anegada is the only sliver of land directly south of Bermuda, another British overseas territory. Nonetheless, Anegada lies directly west of Mauritania in Africa and east of all other islands in the British Virgin Islands. 

At about 15 square miles (38 square kilometers), Anegada is the second largest of the British Virgin Islands. with a population of 450 as of the 2024 Census. Most of the population on Anegada live in the only village, The Settlement.

==Economy==

The primary business of Anegada is tourism. On a typical day during the tourist season, the island will have an additional 200 to 300 visitors. Commercial fishing is also a substantial business on Anegada, with local fishermen providing most of the fresh fish and lobster catch for the rest of the British Virgin Islands. Its miles of south shore flats have a large population of bonefish, making Anegada a popular destination for fly fishing.

From 2008 to 2013 Anegada was home to one of the tallest Christmas trees in the Caribbean and had an official tree lighting ceremony and party each year. The tree donated by Adrian Johnson was intended to help bring visitors to the island and provided a flotilla destination for many sailors.

==Access==
Access to the island is via the small Auguste George Airport (NGD), thrice-weekly ferries, and private boat. Charter flights run directly to Anegada from Tortola and Virgin Gorda, in the BVI, as well as San Juan, St. Thomas, Antigua and St. Maarten.

==Horseshoe Reef==
Anegada is known for miles of white sand beaches and the -long Horseshoe Reef, one of the largest barrier coral reefs in the Caribbean. The reef makes navigation to Anegada difficult. While charter boats freely sail among most of the other Virgin Islands, charter companies often forbid clients to sail to Anegada to avoid running aground on the reef.

The reef has caused hundreds of shipwrecks, including HMS &quot;Astraea&quot; in 1808, the &quot;Donna Paula&quot; (1819), and the MS &quot;Rocus&quot; (1929) As such, it was once an important scuba diving destination. In an effort to protect the reef, the BVI government has made anchoring on Horseshoe Reef illegal.

==Fauna==

Anegada is also known for the large salt ponds that cover much of the west end of the island, These ponds, which support unique fauna, were designated a Ramsar Site on 11 May 1999. In the 1830s, thousands of Caribbean flamingos lived in these ponds, but they were hunted for food and feathers throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries and disappeared by 1950. They have since been re-established. As of 2016, the flamingo flock numbers approximately 200 birds. The birds are another tourist draw, but officials are trying to keep the number of visitors to the flamingo areas at a level that allows the birds to flourish. The western salt ponds and south-eastern coastal mangroves have been recognized as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International.

Other rare or endangered animals include the Anegada rock iguana (&quot;Cyclura pinguis&quot;) and several species of turtle. Conch, Caribbean lobster (&quot;Metanephrops binghami&quot;), and many species of fishes can be found near Anegada, particularly in the deep waters off the North Drop to the north of the island.

The Ft. Worth Zoo now maintains an Anegada Rock &quot;Headstart&quot; facility in the Settlement. Newly hatched iguanas are caught in the wild, brought to the facility, and raised until they are large enough to defend themselves against the feral cats that are their only predator on Anegada. As of 2016, over 200 iguanas have been released from the Headstart program back into the wild. In addition, an annual Iguana Festival is held outside the Iguana Headstart Facility to celebrate the island&#x27;s native species.

The reef adjacent to the Settlement was once one of the more fertile conch grounds in the Caribbean, but overfishing has wiped out the conch population there. Visitors to the settlement are greeted by the sight of mountains of empty conch shells on the shore when they arrive.

There are also populations of feral cattle, donkeys, goats, cows and sheep that live in all areas of the island.

==Hurricanes==

Anegadians traditionally endured hurricanes by tying their dories to the trunks of mangroves with rope and covering with a tarp. Today, given sufficient warning, a few leave the island and go to Tortola until after the storm passes.

On 30 August 2010, the eye of Hurricane Earl passed north of Anegada at category 4, with winds in excess of . The close passage led to significant damage on the island, with major flooding on the south side from the storm surge and breaking waves. The north side of the island experienced no storm surge, and Horseshoe Reef protected the north side of the island from breaking waves. 24 hours before the storm arrived, the forecast was for the storm to pass well to the north. By the time that it was apparent that the hurricane was going to have a major impact, all transportation services from Anegada (air and ferry) had been suspended. There were no reported serious injuries to anyone on the island.

On 6 September 2017, the eye of Hurricane Irma passed south of Anegada at category 5, with winds in excess of . The northern eyewall of Irma passed directly over Anegada, causing major damage to the island. Some people evacuated to Tortola before the storm struck, but most people remained on the island. There was some flooding on the south side from the storm surge and breaking waves. The north side of the island experienced no storm surge, and Horseshoe Reef protected the north side of the island from breaking waves. There were no reported serious injuries to anyone on the island.

==Education==
Approximately 70 students attend school at the Claudia Creque Educational Centre, formerly Anegada Primary and Secondary School. This self-contained school is the only school on Anegada and handles pre-school, primary, and secondary levels. It is funded and operated by the British Virgin Islands government.

<doc id="866813" wikidata="Q572877" url="?curid=866813" title="Anthony Benezet">
<text>Anthony Benezet (January 31, 1713May 3, 1784) was a French-born American abolitionist and teacher who was active in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A prominent member of the abolitionist movement in North America, Benezet founded one of the world&#x27;s first anti-slavery societies, the Society for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage. He also founded the first public school for girls in North America and the Negro School at Philadelphia, which operated into the nineteenth century. Benezet advocated for kind treatment of animals, racial equality and universal love.

==Biography==
Antoine was born in Saint-Quentin, France, to Jean-Étienne de Bénézet (later known as John Stephen Benezet) and his wife Judith de la Méjanelle, who were Huguenots (French Protestants). The Huguenots had been persecuted and suffered violent attacks in France since the 1685 revocation of the Edict of Nantes, which had provided religious tolerance. For a while his family had received protection owing to their powerful connections. However in 1715 his father&#x27;s goods were seized, so, like many others, the family left France rather than give up their religion. They moved first to Rotterdam, then briefly to Greenwich before settling in London, where there was a sizeable Huguenot refugee community. In 1727, Benezet joined the Religious Society of Friends (also known as Quakers).

In 1731, the Benezet family migrated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, founded by Quakers and one of the English colonies of North America. Then 18 years old, Anthony Benezet joined John Woolman as one of the earliest American abolitionists. Like Woolman, Benezet also advocated war tax resistance. Several years later in 1736, he married Joyce Marriott.

In Philadelphia, Benezet worked to persuade his Quaker brethren that slave-owning was not consistent with Christian doctrine. He believed that the ban on slavery in the British Isles should be extended to the North American and Caribbean colonies. (After the Americans gained independence in the Revolutionary War, Benezet continued to urge the United States to ban slavery, and the state of Pennsylvania legislated slavery&#x27;s gradual abolition in 1780.)

After several years as a failed merchant, in 1739 Benezet began teaching at a Germantown school, then a separate jurisdiction northwest of Philadelphia. In 1742, he moved to the Friends&#x27; English School of Philadelphia (now the William Penn Charter School). In 1750 he added night classes for black slaves to his schedule.

In 1755, Benezet left the Friends&#x27; English School to set up his own school, the first public girls&#x27; school on the American continent. His students included daughters from prominent families, such as Deborah Norris and Sally Wister.

In 1770, he founded the Negro School at Philadelphia for black children. There was a growing free black community in Philadelphia, which increased after the state abolished slavery. Abolitionist sympathizers, such as Abigail Hopper Gibbons, continued to teach at Benezet&#x27;s Negro School in the years before the American Civil War.

In 1775, he helped found the first anti-slavery society, the Society for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage. Eight years later in 1783, Benezet wrote a letter to Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz discussing &quot;the cruelty of slavery and his opposition to the slave trade.&quot; After Benezet&#x27;s death, Benjamin Franklin and Dr. Benjamin Rush reconstituted this association as the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery.

Benezet was known for his kindness to animals such as feeding rats in his garden. He was once offered chicken for dinner which he replied &quot;What, would you have me eat my neighbors?&quot;. Benezet and his wife were alleged to be vegetarians but according to Jacob Lindley, a Quaker minister who dined with Benezet and his wife, they ate corn beef, cabbage and potatoes. Benezet was a teetotaller and supported the temperance movement. He authored a pamphlet in 1774, &quot;The Mighty Destroyer Displayed&quot; which influenced Benjamin Rush, an early temperance advocate.

== Legacy ==

The first anti-slavery newspaper article in the United States was published on March 8, 1775, in the &quot;Pennsylvania Journal and Weekly Advertiser&quot;, a newspaper based in Philadelphia. The article, titled &quot;The Slavery of Negroes in America,&quot; was written by the Quaker writer and abolitionist Anthony Benezet, and it called for the abolition of slavery in all the colonies and the end of the slave trade worldwide.
 The estimated population of 1775 Philadelphia was 40,000 people, making it the biggest city in all the colonies.
In 1817, the abolitionist Roberts Vaux published a biography about Anthony Benezet.

<doc id="866819" wikidata="Q425680" url="?curid=866819" title="Deoxycholic acid">
<text>Deoxycholic acid is a bile acid. Deoxycholic acid is one of the secondary bile acids, which are metabolic byproducts of intestinal bacteria. The two primary bile acids secreted by the liver are cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. Bacteria metabolize chenodeoxycholic acid into the secondary bile acid lithocholic acid, and they metabolize cholic acid into deoxycholic acid. There are additional secondary bile acids, such as ursodeoxycholic acid. Deoxycholic acid is soluble in alcohol and acetic acid. When pure, it exists in a white to off-white crystalline powder form.

Deoxycholic acid is available as a generic medication in the United States as of April 2021, sold under the brand name Kybella among others.

==Applications==

Deoxycholic acid has been used since its discovery in various fields of human medicine. In the human body deoxycholic acid is used in the emulsification of fats for absorption in the intestine. It has, in some countries (including Switzerland) been licensed as an emulsifier in food industry, but it is no longer common. Outside the body it is used in experimental basis of cholagogues and is also in use to prevent and dissolve gallstones.

In research deoxycholic acid is used as a mild detergent for the isolation of membrane associated proteins. The critical micelle concentration for deoxycholic acid is approximately 2.4–4 mM.

Sodium deoxycholate, the sodium salt of deoxycholic acid, is often used as a biological detergent to lyse cells and solubilise cellular and membrane components. Sodium deoxycholate mixed with phosphatidylcholine, is used in mesotherapy injections to produce lipolysis, and has been used as an alternative to surgical excision in the treatment of lipomas.

Deoxycholates and bile acid derivatives in general are actively being studied as structures for incorporation in nanotechnology. They also have found application in microlithography as photoresistant components.

In the United States, deoxycholic acid, under the brand name Kybella, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for reducing moderate-to-severe fat below the chin. When injected into submental fat, deoxycholic acid helps destroy (adipocytes) fat cells, which are metabolized by the body over the course of several months. Kybella is produced by Kythera Biopharmaceuticals.

== Research in immunology ==

Its function as a detergent and isolating agent for membrane proteins also suits it for production of outer membrane protein (OMP) vaccines such as MenB, a Norwegian vaccine developed in the early 1990s. The MeNZB vaccine was produced using the same method.

Deoxycholic acid binds and activates the membrane enzyme NAPE-PLD, which catalyzes the release of the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide and other N-acylethanolamines. These bioactive signaling molecules play important roles in several physiological pathways including stress and pain response, appetite, and lifespan.

Some publications point towards the effect of deoxycholic acid as an immunostimulant of the innate immune system, activating its main actors, the macrophages. According to these publications, a sufficient amount of deoxycholic acid in the human body would correspond with a good immune reaction of the non-specific immune system. Clinical studies conducted in the 1970s and 1980s confirm the expectation that deoxycholic acid is involved in the natural healing processes of local inflammations, different types of herpes, and possibly cancer.

==Research in cancer==
Deoxycholate and other secondary bile acids cause DNA damage. Secondary bile acids increase intracellular production of reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species resulting in increased oxidative stress and DNA damage. As shown in the figure below, deoxycholate added to the diet of mice increased the level of 8-oxo-dG, an oxidative DNA damage, in the colonic epithelium of mice. When the level of deoxycholate-induced DNA damage is high, DNA repair enzymes that ordinarily reverse DNA damage may not be able to keep up.

DNA damage has frequently been proposed as a major cause of cancer. DNA damage can give rise to cancer by causing mutations.

When deoxycholate was added to the food of mice so that their feces contained deoxycholate at about the same level present in feces of human on a high fat diet, 45% to 56% of the mice developed colon cancer over the next 10 months, while none of the mice on a diet without deoxycholate developed cancer. Thus, exposure of the colon to deoxycholate may cause cancer in mice. However, this same study reported that, when chlorogenic acid was added to the diet alongside deoxycholate, only 18% of the mice developed colon cancer. Chlorogenic acid is a component of common foods and beverages; coffee contains an average of 53.8 mg chlorogenic acid per 100 ml. Therefore, to consume the level of chlorogenic acid used in the study, a human on a &quot;standard&quot; 2000-calorie daily diet (416 g/d; 250g carbs, 100g protein, 66g fat) would need to consume roughly 55 mL of coffee each day, or just under 2 fluid ounces.

In humans, higher levels of colonic deoxycholate are associated with higher frequencies of colon cancer. As an example, the fecal deoxycholate concentrations in African Americans (who eat a relatively high fat diet) is more than five times higher than fecal deoxycholate of Native Africans in South Africa (who eat a low fat diet). Male African Americans have a high incidence of colon cancer of 72 per 100,000, while Native Africans in South Africa have a low incidence rate of colon cancer of less than 1 per 100,000, a more than 72-fold difference in rates of colon cancer.

A prospective human study investigating the relationship between microbial metabolites and cancer found a strong correlation between circulating deoxycholic acid and colorectal cancer risk in women.

==Factors affecting deoxycholate levels==
A number of factors, including diet, obesity, and exercise, affect the level of deoxycholate in the human colon. When humans were switched from their usual diet to a meat, egg and cheese based diet for five days, deoxycholate in their feces increased by factors of 2 to 10 fold. Rats fed diets with 30% beef tallow (high fat) had almost 2-fold more deoxycholate in their feces than rats fed 5% beef tallow (low fat). In the same study, adding the further dietary elements of curcumin or caffeic acid to the rats&#x27; high fat (30% beef tallow) diet reduced the deoxycholate in their feces to levels comparable to levels seen in the rats on a low fat diet. Curcumin is a component of the spice turmeric, and caffeic acid is a component high in some fruits and spices. Caffeic acid is also a digestive break-down product of chlorogenic acid, high in coffee and some fruits and vegetables.In addition to fats, the type or amount of protein in the diet may also affect bile acid levels. Switching from a diet with protein provided by casein to a diet with protein provided by salmon protein hydrolysate led to as much as a 6-fold increase in levels of bile acids in the blood plasma of rats. In humans, adding high protein to a high fat diet raised the level of deoxycholate in the plasma by almost 50%.

Obesity has been linked to cancer, and this link is in part through deoxycholate. In obese people, the relative proportion of Firmicutes (Gram-positive bacteria) in gut microbiota is increased resulting in greater conversion of the non-genotoxic primary bile acid, cholic acid, to carcinogenic deoxycholate.

Exercise decreases deoxycholate in the colon. Humans whose level of physical activity placed them in the top third had a 17% decrease in fecal bile acid concentration compared to those whose level of physical activity placed them in the lowest third. Rats provided with an exercise wheel had a lower ratio of secondary bile acids to primary bile acids than sedentary rats in their feces. There is a positive association of exercise and physical activity with cancer prevention, tolerance to cancer-directed therapies (radiation and chemotherapy), reduction in recurrence, and improvement in survival.

<text>Sprengel explosives are a generic class of materials invented by Hermann Sprengel in the 1870s. They consist of stoichiometric mixtures of strong oxidisers and reactive fuels, mixed just prior to use in order to enhance safety. Either the oxidiser or the fuel, or both, should be a liquid to facilitate mixing, and intimate contact between the materials for a fast reaction rate.

Sprengel suggested nitric acid, nitrates and chlorates as oxidisers, and nitroaromatics (e.g. nitrobenzene) as fuels. Other Sprengel explosives used at various times include charcoal with liquid oxygen (an oxyliquit), &quot;Rackarock&quot;, and ANFO ammonium nitrate (oxidiser) mixed with a fuel oil (fuel), normally diesel, kerosene, or nitromethane. Eventually ANFO supplanted all others because its oxidiser was the safest, and - due to its widespread use as a fertiliser in agriculture - also the cheapest.

&quot;Rackarock&quot; consisted of potassium chlorate and nitrobenzene. It was provided in the form of permeable cartridges of the chlorate, which were placed in wire baskets and dipped in the nitrobenzene for a few seconds before use. For underwater use, it could be provided in cans instead. It was famously used in the massive submarine demolition of Flood Rock, a navigational hazard in Long Island Sound in 1885. The charge of over a hundred tonnes of explosive (laid in tunnels 20 metres below sea level) destroyed approximately 600,000 tonnes of rock.

<text>Holy Names Academy is a Catholic private all-girls college-preparatory high school, founded by the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary in 1880 and located on the east slope of Seattle&#x27;s Capitol Hill. It is the oldest continually operating school in Washington state. Located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle, the school is governed by an independent Board of Trustees, and is under the trusteeship of the Sisters of the Holy Names; a number of religious sisters are on the board or the faculty/staff. The school has been named a Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education four separate times, and has been multiple times ranked among &quot;America&#x27;s Most Challenging High Schools&quot; in an annual survey by The Washington Post.

==History==
The school was officially founded on June 15, 1880, by the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary. Holy Names Academy was founded before Washington officially became a state in 1889. . Its first pupils were 21 day students, one boarding student, and one music student. Initially it was located in two rented houses at the corner of 2nd Avenue and Seneca Street in downtown Seattle. In 1885 the academy moved to its first purpose-built home, a multi-story structure in the Second Empire style crowned with a tall steeple. It was located on 7th Avenue near Jackson Street in what is now in the Chinatown/International District. An advertisement in Polk&#x27;s &quot;Seattle City Directory&quot; from 1895 stated: &quot;Thorough instruction is given in all the English branches, art, music, elocution and modern languages. Plain sewing and every variety of fancy needlework taught without extra charge, stenography and typewriting are among the elective studies.&quot;

By 1904 planned regrading works on Jackson Street meant another move for the school to what would be their present home in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. Construction began in 1906 and was completed in 1908. The building on 7th Avenue was demolished that same year. The architect of the new domed building, designed in the Baroque Revival style, was Albert Breitung. Its design has been preserved over the years with few exterior changes.

The adjacent Jeanne Marie McAteer Lee Gymnasium was built in 1990 on what was previously tennis courts. In 2017, the school opened the Mary Herche Pavilion, a 3-story structure that connects the original building and the gym, and features a student commons area, a fitness center for all students and faculty, an expanded cafeteria with outdoor seating, and other improvements.

By 2018, the Academy recognized challenges to the school’s long-term sustainability, notably the acute lack of parking in a rapidly changing Capitol Hill neighborhood and insufficient facilities for a thriving athletics program. In response, the school undertook one of the largest capital initiatives in its history—the Foundation for the Future campaign—to support the construction of an underground parking garage and a new athletic complex atop it. Starting in 2019, the previous gym was removed, the site was excavated for a five-level, 243-vehicle garage, and a new Jeanne Marie McAteer Lee Athletic Complex rose at the Roy Street end of the HNA campus. The project was completed in fall 2020.

Holy Names Academy had originally incorporated a boarding school and grade school. A normal school was added in 1908. The normal school closed in 1930, the grade school in 1963, and the boarding school in 1967.

<text>Nafisa Joseph (28 March 1978 – 29 July 2004) was an Indian model, video jockey and beauty pageant titleholder. She was the winner of Femina Miss India Universe 1997 and was a finalist in the Miss Universe 1997 pageant in Miami Beach.

== Early life and education ==
Nafisa Joseph was born on 28 March 1978 in Delhi, and was brought up in Bangalore, Karnataka. She was the younger of two daughters born to father Nirmal Joseph, a Malayali and mother Usha Joseph, a Bengali, who was a descendant of Rabindranath Tagore. Nafisa studied at Bishop Cotton Girls&#x27; School and St. Joseph&#x27;s College, both at Bangalore. 

== Career ==
Joseph started modelling at age 12 when her neighbour got her an opportunity to model for a Wearhouse ad. She was groomed as a model by Prasad Bidapa. Joseph was the youngest participant at the Miss India pageant in 1997, which she won.
Joseph participated in the Miss Universe Pageant at Miami Beach, Florida on 16 May 1997, and was amongst the 10 semifinalists in the pageant.

In 1999, she was a judge for the Channel named MTV India VJ Hunt and was also a VJ for MTV. A week later she was called for a screen test to host a show on MTV . She ran the &quot;MTV House Full&quot; show for close to five years. She also acted in a television series &quot;C.A.T.S.&quot;, an Indian version of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; for Sony Entertainment Television. In 2004, she hosted a show &quot;Style&quot; on Star World. She also launched a television programming unit &quot;2&#x27;s Company&quot; with the help of her fiancé, Gautam Khanduja. She edited a magazine called &quot;Gurlz&quot;. She also had a brief cameo in the Subhash Ghai film &quot;Taal&quot;.

In addition to modeling and hosting duties, Joseph was a lover of animals and campaigned for Welfare of Stray Dogs (WSD), People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and People for Animals (PFA), organizations for animal protection, and wrote a weekly column called &quot;Nafisa for Animals&quot; in the Bangalore edition of the &quot;Times of India&quot;.

== Death ==
Joseph hanged herself in her flat in Versova on 29 July 2004. She was to marry businessman Gautam Khanduja in a few weeks&#x27; time. According to her parents, Joseph took the step because her marriage was called off. This was due to Joseph having discovered that Khanduja was still married, although having told her he had been divorced for two years. When confronted, Khanduja refused to answer questions about his marital life or produce divorce papers that he had previously claimed he had filed. Instead, press reports at the time mention that he then threatened her with blackmail, probably after she threatened to confront his wife.

Joseph&#x27;s parents filed a police report accusing her fiancé for her death, claiming that Khanduja had been desperate to get out of the wedding for some time, and sought his custodial interrogation. In November 2005, the trial against Khanduja was stayed by the Bombay High Court until January 2006. Khanduja claimed that there was no evidence to prove that breaking off the engagement had led to Joseph&#x27;s suicide.

<text>Parrots, also known as psittacines (), are the 402 species of birds that make up the order Psittaciformes, found in most tropical and subtropical regions, of which 387 are extant. The order is subdivided into three superfamilies: the Psittacoidea (&quot;true&quot; parrots), the Cacatuoidea (cockatoos), and the Strigopoidea (New Zealand parrots). Parrots have a generally pantropical distribution with several species inhabiting temperate regions in the Southern Hemisphere as well. The greatest diversity of parrots is in South America and Australasia.

The Cacatuoidea are quite distinct, having a movable head crest, a different arrangement of the carotid arteries, a gall bladder, differences in the skull bones, and lack the Dyck texture feathers that—in the Psittacoidea—scatter light to produce the vibrant colours of so many parrots. Lorikeets were previously regarded as a family, Loriidae, but are now considered a tribe (Loriini) within the subfamily Loriinae, family Psittaculidae. Some species, such as the Puerto Rican amazon (&quot;Amazona vittata&quot;) have had a population bottleneck (in this case reduced to 13 individuals in 1975) and subsequently have low genetic variability and low reproductive success, leading to complications with conservation.

No consensus existed regarding the taxonomy of Psittaciformes until recently. The placement of the Strigopoidea species has been variable in the past. They were once considered part of the Psittacoidea, but recent 21st-century studies place this group of New Zealand species as their own superfamily next to the Cacatuoidea and remaining members of the Psittacoidea. Many studies have confirmed the unique placement of this group at the base of the parrot tree. Most authors now recognize this group as a separate taxon containing two families: Nestoridae and Strigopidae. Conversely, the relationships among various cockatoo genera are largely resolved.

==Conventions==
Conservation status codes listed follow the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Range maps are provided wherever possible; if a range map is not available, a description of the bird&#x27;s range is provided. Ranges are based on the IUCN red list for that species unless otherwise noted. All extinct species listed went extinct after 1500 CE (recently extinct), and are indicated by a dagger symbol &quot;†&quot;.

** Subfamily Calyptorhynchinae: the black cockatoos
** Subfamily Cacatuinae
*** Tribe Microglossini: one genus with one species, the black palm cockatoo
*** Tribe Cacatuini: four genera of white, pink, and grey species

<doc id="866858" wikidata="Q16334539" url="?curid=866858" title="Names of the Levant">
<text>Over recorded history, there have been many names of the Levant, a large area in the Near East, or its constituent parts. These names have applied to a part or the whole of the Levant. On occasion, two or more of these names have been used at the same time by different cultures or sects. As a natural result, some of the names of the Levant are highly politically charged. Perhaps the least politicized name is &quot;Levant&quot; itself, which simply means &quot;where the sun rises&quot; or &quot;where the land rises out of the sea&quot;, a meaning attributed to the region&#x27;s easterly location on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.

== Antiquity ==

=== Retjenu ===
Ancient Egyptian texts (c. 14th century BC) called the entire coastal area along the Mediterranean Sea between modern Egypt and Turkey &quot;rṯnw&quot; (conventionally &quot;Reṯenu&quot;). In the Amarna letters, written in Akkadian cuneiform, Reṯenu is subdivided into five regions:

* &quot;kꜣnꜥnꜥ&quot; (&quot;Kanana&quot;), i.e. Canaan proper (Idumea, Judea, Samaria);
**&quot;pꜣ-kꜣnꜥnꜥ&quot; (&quot;pa-Kanana&quot;), city of Gaza; name used in reference to being the administrative centre of Canaan.
* &quot;Ḏahy&quot; (&quot;ḏꜣhy&quot;;&quot;Ṯahi&quot;, &quot;Ḏahi&quot;), roughly Galilee and coastal plain to Ashkelon dominated by Hazor;
* &quot;Rmnn&quot;, coast of Lebanon;
* &quot;Amurru&quot;, (the Amurru kingdom of the Amorites); 
* &quot;Kharu&quot; (&quot;ḥꜣrw&quot;), the chief city of which was Ugarit.

=== Canaan ===
* Akkadian: 𒆳𒆠𒈾𒄴𒈾 (&quot;Kinaḫnu)&quot;
* Phoenician: 𐤊𐤍𐤏𐤍 (&quot;Knʿn&quot;)
* or Χνᾶ (&quot;Khanaán&quot; or &quot;Khna&quot;)
* Hebrew
:* Israeli 
:* Tiberian 
* (&quot;Kænaan&quot;)
* (&quot;Knʿn&quot;)

Prior to (and for some time after) the formation of the Israelite/Hebrew identity and polities in the region, the land was referred to natively as Canaan (first attested in Assyrian Akkadian as &quot;Kinaḫnu&quot;). Though it was once thought that the Hebrews were foreign settlers in Canaan, the modern consensus of most scholars is that Hebrew identity developed &quot;in situ&quot; as a direct indigenous evolution of earlier Canaanite tribes; the continuity from Bronze Age Canaanite civilization to Iron Age Israelite/Judean civilization is indeed so seamless that many scholars stress that any dichotomy between the two is essentially arbitrary—with culture, language, etc., being indistinguishable during the transition from Bronze Age to Iron Age. The Phoenicians—also descended from the Bronze Age Canaanites, and close relatives and neighbors of the Israelites—likewise continued to speak a Canaanite language and practice Canaanite religion at their Mediterranean ports, and referred to themselves natively as &quot;Canaanites&quot;, and their land as &quot;Canaan&quot;.

=== Phoenicia ===
* (&quot;Phoiníkē&quot;)
* Hebrew
:* Israeli (&quot;Feniqiyah&quot; or &quot;Finiqiyah&quot;)
* 

In ancient times, the Greeks called the whole of Canaan &quot;Phoiníkē&quot;, literally &quot;[land] of the purple[-producing shell]&quot;. Today, general consensus associates the Phoenician homeland proper with modern-day Lebanon, centered at Phoenician cities such as Ugarit, Tyre, Sidon, and Byblos. Also, there is a modern town in Turkey called &quot;Finike&quot; which is thought to have derived by the Lycians who traded with Phoenicians in ancient times.

=== Israel and Judea ===

Israel:

*Egyptian: &quot;ysrỉꜣr&quot; ()i-i-z:Z1s*Z1s:r-i-A-r:Z1*T14-A1*B1:Z2
* Canaanite: 𐤉𐤔𐤓𐤀𐤋 (&quot;yšrʾl&quot;)
* Ugaritic: 𐎊𐎌𐎗𐎛𐎍 (&quot;yšrỉl&quot;)
* (&quot;Israḗl&quot;)
* Hebrew
:* Israeli (&quot;Yisrael&quot;)
:* Tiberian 
:* Biblical Hebrew: 𐤉𐤔𐤓𐤀𐤋 
* 
* Middle Persian: &quot;Adēr&quot; / &quot;Adēl&quot;
* (&quot;Esrajil&quot;)

Judea:
* Akkadian: 𒅀𒌑𒁕𒀀𒀀 (ia-u2-da-a-a)
* (&quot;Ioudaía&quot;)
* Hebrew
:* Israeli (&quot;Yehuda&quot;)
:* Tiberian Hebrew: &quot;Yəhūḏā&quot;
* (&quot;Jæhudije&quot; / &quot;Jæhudija&quot;)
* 

The kingdoms of Israel and Judah were Iron Age Semitic nations spanning from Edom to Assyria. Today, the modern State of Israel controls much of the former territory of the ancient Israelite/Judean kingdoms. According to the Deuteronomic history in the Bible, the polities of Israel and Judah originally split off from an earlier, united Kingdom of Israel, ruled by illustrious kings such as David and Solomon; though modern archaeology, biblical scholarship, and historians are generally somewhat skeptical of the historicity of the alleged united monarchy of Israel, suggesting instead that the two kingdoms developed separately, with the southern kingdom of Judah probably dependent on the northern kingdom of Israel as a satellite state at first.

The term &quot;Judaea&quot; is used by historians to refer to the Roman province that extended over parts of the former regions of the Hasmonean and Herodian kingdoms. It was named after Herod Archelaus&#x27;s ethnarchy of Judea of which it was an expansion, the name being derived from the earlier provincial designations Yehud Medinata (Achaemenid) and Yehud (Neo-Babylonian): all ultimately referring to the former Hebrew kingdom of Judah.

=== Assyria and Syria ===
During Persian rule of the Near East, the Greeks and Romans came to call the region &quot;Syria&quot;, believed to have been named after Assyria and the Aramaic language they spread over the entire region. However, Herodotus used the combined name &quot;Syria Palaistinē&quot;. &quot;Greater Syria&quot; refers to a larger area that is supported by some nationalists.

During the Syrian Wars between the Seleucid dynasty and the Ptolemaic dynasty (274-168 BC), the region was known as Coele-Syria traditionally given the meaning &#x27;hollow&#x27; Syria. The later Hellenistic term &quot;Koile Syria&quot; that appears first in Arrian&#x27;s Anabasis Alexandri (2.13.7) in AD 145 and has been much discussed, is usually interpreted as a transcription of Aramaic &quot;kul&quot;, &quot;all, the entire&quot;, identifying &quot;all&quot; of Syria.

* (&quot;Palaistinē&quot;) - from ; or perhaps Greek παλαιστής (&quot;palaistēs&quot;, &quot;wrestler&quot;), in reference to 
* Hebrew
:* Israeli (&quot;Palestina&quot;) – from Latin, English etc., or Israeli (&quot;Falastin&quot;) – from Arabic.
* (&quot;Felestin&quot;)
* - same word as &quot;Philistia&quot;

An early version of the name &quot;Palestine&quot; was first recorded by the ancient Egyptians as &quot;Peleset&quot;. Herodotus later called the whole area &quot;Syria Palaistinē&quot; in his Histories (c. 450 BC), and included the entire territory of ancient Israel and Judea (which he noted for the practice of circumcision), not specifically the coastal Philistine territory (whose people notably did not practice circumcision). The Romans applied the term &quot;Syria Palaestina&quot; to the southern part of the region—beginning in AD 135, following the Bar Kokhba revolt—to complete the disassociation with the former identity of Judaea. The name continued to be used for the province throughout later Byzantine and Islamic rule.

Standard Hebrew has two names for Palestine, both of which are different from the Hebrew name for ancient Philistia. The first name &quot;Palestina&quot; was used by Hebrew speakers in the British Mandate of Palestine; it is spelled like the name for Philistia but with three more letters added to the end and a Latin pronunciation given. The second name &quot;Falastin&quot; is a direct loan from the Arabic form, and is used today specifically to refer to the modern Palestinians and to political aspirations for a Palestinian state.

=== Philistia ===

Philistia:
* Canaanite: 𐤐𐤋𐤔𐤕 (p.l.ʃ.t)
* Hebrew
:* Israeli (&quot;Pleshet&quot;)
:* Tiberian 
* - from Greek

=== Eber-Nari and Transeuphratia ===
&quot;Eber-Nari&quot; was the name of a satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire which roughly corresponded with the southern Levant. It means &quot;Beyond the River&quot; or &quot;Across the River&quot; in both Akkadian and Aramaic (that is, the western side of the Euphrates from a Mesopotamian and Persian viewpoint). It is also sometimes referred to as &quot;Transeuphratia&quot; (French &quot;Transeuphratène&quot;) by modern scholars.

== Medieval and modern history ==

=== Shaam ===
The Arabic name for the region of Levant is &quot;Shaam&quot; () comes from the Arabic root meaning &quot;left&quot; or &quot;north&quot;. After the Islamic conquest of the region, the term was applied to the Levant (Byzantine Syria).

In ancient times, &quot;Baalshamin&quot; or &quot;Ba&#x27;al Šamem&quot; (), was a Semitic sky-god in Canaan/Phoenicia and ancient Palmyra. However, the syllable &quot;sham&quot; in &quot;Baalshamin&quot; has nothing to do with the name &quot;shaam&quot; but is just by chance the middle syllable of the word for &quot;sky&quot;, comparable to Hebrew שָׁמַיִם (&quot;shamayim&quot;).

=== Levant ===
Medieval Italians called the region &quot;Levante&quot; after its easterly location where the sun &quot;rises&quot;; this term was adopted from Italian and French into many other languages.

=== Outremer ===
Frankish Crusaders called the Levant &quot;Outremer&quot; in French, which means &quot;overseas&quot;. In France, this general term was colloquially applied more specifically to the Levant because of heavy Frankish involvement in the Crusades and the foundation of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem and other Latin settlements scattered throughout the area.

=== Eastern Mediterranean ===
&quot;Eastern Mediterranean&quot; is a term that denotes the lands or states geographically in the eastern, to the east of, or around the east of the Mediterranean Sea, or with cultural affinities to this region. The Eastern Mediterranean includes Cyprus, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, and Jordan. The term &quot;Mediterranean&quot; derives from the Latin word &quot;mediterraneus&quot;, meaning &quot;in the middle of earth&quot; or &quot;between lands&quot; (&quot;medius&quot;, &quot;middle, between&quot; + &quot;terra&quot;, &quot;land, earth&quot;). This is on account of the sea&#x27;s intermediary position between the continents of Africa and Europe.

=== Holy Land ===

In different languages:
* (&quot;Al-Arḍ al-Muqaddasah&quot; in the Islamic holy book, the Quran)
* (&quot;Hagioi Topoi&quot;, modern ), literally: &quot;Holy Places&quot;)
* (&quot;Erets ha-Kodesh&quot;)
* 

The &quot;Holy Land&quot; is a term used in Judeo-Christian tradition to refer to sacred sites of the Levant — such as Shiloh, Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Nazareth — but is also often used to refer to the Levant (and historical Canaan) as a whole.

====Athletic scholarship scandal====
In 2015, Bishop Blanchet High School self-reported that its athletics program had violated the recruiting policies of the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (WIAA). A parent had been giving tuition assistance to a player on the girls&#x27; basketball team, and during investigation of what had happened, it was determined that the head coach of the football team had been administering a scholarship fund to provide tuition assistance for football players who would otherwise have been ineligible for financial aid.

The WIAA responded by expunging the records of the football and girls&#x27; basketball teams for several previous seasons and placing the school&#x27;s athletic program on a two-year probation. The coach was dismissed from his head coaching position but was allowed to continue at the school as a physical education teacher, and the school began a training program to educate its staff about WIAA policies.

=== Arts ===
Bishop Blanchet High School provides a range of artistic courses for its students, including band, choir, drama, and visual arts. The Drama department boasts a &quot;black box&quot; theater within the school premises, which serves as the venue for a fall play, one acts, improv performances, classes, and rehearsals. Additionally, every spring, Blanchet presents a musical at the Moore Theatre. In 2008, the school&#x27;s Drama Program was recognized by &quot;Stage Directions&quot; magazine as &quot;The Top High School Theatre Program in the Northwest&quot;.

=== Esports ===
A team of students representing Bishop Blanchet High School won the NintendoVS Splatoon 3 High School Exhibition at Nintendo Live 2023, defeating another high school in the Archdiocese of Seattle, O&#x27;Dea High School. During the 2022-2023 school year, the school&#x27;s League of Legends team won both PlayVS season finals in the Mountain Region during both fall and spring seasons going undefeated in both, resulting in a perfect 24-0.

<text>Milton Supman (January 8, 1926 – October 22, 2009), known professionally as Soupy Sales, was an American comedian, actor, radio-television personality, and jazz aficionado. He was best known for his local and network children&#x27;s television series, &quot;Lunch with Soupy Sales&quot; (later titled &quot;The Soupy Sales Show&quot;) (1953–1966), a series of comedy sketches frequently ending with Sales receiving a pie in the face, which became his trademark. From 1968 to 1975, he was a regular panelist on the syndicated revival of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and appeared on several other TV game shows. During the 1980s, he hosted his own show on WNBC in New York City.

==Early life==
Milton Supman was born in Franklinton, North Carolina, to Irving Supman and Sadie Berman Supman. His father, a Jewish dry goods merchant, emigrated from Hungary in 1894. His was the only Jewish family in town; Sales joked that local Ku Klux Klan members bought the sheets used for their robes from his father&#x27;s store.

Sales got his nickname from his family. His older brothers had been nicknamed &quot;Ham Bone&quot; and &quot;Chicken Bone&quot;. Milton was dubbed &quot;Soup Bone&quot;, which was later shortened to &quot;Soupy&quot;. When he became a disc jockey, he began using the stage name Soupy Hines. After he became established, it was decided that &quot;Hines&quot; was too close to the Heinz soup company, so he chose Sales, in part after vaudeville comedian Chic Sale. He graduated from Huntington High School in Huntington, West Virginia, in 1944. He enlisted in the United States Navy and served on in the South Pacific during the latter part of World War II. He sometimes entertained his shipmates by telling jokes and playing crazy characters over the ship&#x27;s public address system. One of the characters he created was &quot;White Fang&quot;, a large dog that played outrageous practical jokes on the seamen. The sounds for &quot;White Fang&quot; came from a recording of &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;.

Sales enrolled at Marshall University, known as Marshall College at that time, where he earned a master&#x27;s degree in journalism. While there, he performed in nightclubs as a comedian, singer and dancer.

==Career==
After graduating from Marshall, Sales began working as a scriptwriter and disc jockey at radio station WHTN (now WVHU) in Huntington. He moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1949, where he was a morning radio DJ and performed in nightclubs. He began his television career on WKRC-TV in Cincinnati with &quot;Soupy&#x27;s Soda Shop&quot;, TV&#x27;s first teen dance program, and &quot;Club Nothing!&quot;, a late-night comedy/variety program.

===&quot;Lunch with Soupy Sales&quot;===
Sales is best known for his daily children&#x27;s television show, &quot;Lunch with Soupy Sales&quot;. It was originally called &quot;12 O&#x27;Clock Comics&quot;, and later known as &quot;The Soupy Sales Show&quot;. Improvised and slapstick in nature, it was a rapid-fire stream of comedy sketches, gags and puns, almost all of which resulted in Sales receiving a pie in the face, which became his trademark. He developed pie-throwing into an art form: straight to the face, on top of the head, a pie to both ears from behind, moving into a stationary pie, and countless other variations. He claimed that he and his visitors had been hit by more than 20,000 pies during his career. He recounted a time when a young fan mistakenly threw a frozen pie at his neck and he &quot;dropped like a pile of bricks&quot;.

====History====
=====Detroit=====

&quot;Lunch with Soupy Sales&quot; began in 1953 from the studios of WXYZ-TV, Channel 7, in the historic Maccabees Building in Detroit. Sales occasionally took the studio cameras to the lawn of the Detroit Public Library, across the street from the studios, and talked with local students walking to and from school. Beginning no later than July 4, 1955, a Saturday version of Sales&#x27; lunch show was broadcast nationally on the ABC television network. His lunchtime program on weekdays was moved to early morning opposite &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;.

During the same period that &quot;Lunch with Soupy Sales&quot; aired in Detroit, Sales also hosted a nighttime show, &quot;Soupy&#x27;s On&quot;, to compete with 11 O&#x27;Clock News programs. The guest star was always a musician, often a jazz performer, at a time when jazz was popular in Detroit and the city was home to 24 jazz clubs. Sales believed his show helped sustain jazz in Detroit, as artists regularly sold out their nightclub shows after appearing on it.

Coleman Hawkins, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, Charlie Parker and Stan Getz were among the musicians who appeared on the show; Miles Davis made six appearances. Clifford Brown&#x27;s appearance on &quot;Soupy&#x27;s On&quot;, according to Sales, may be the only extant footage of Brown, and has been included in &quot;Ken Burns&#x27; Jazz&quot; and an A&amp;E Network biography about Sales.

Sales briefly had a third dinnertime show filmed largely in Detroit&#x27;s Palmer Park area. His three shows were rumored to earn him in excess of $100,000 per year. One of his character puppets was Willy the Worm, a &quot;balloon&quot; propelled worm that emerged from its house and used a high pitched voice to announce birthdays or special events on the noontime show; but the character never appeared when Soupy moved to Los Angeles. In his lunchtime show, Sales always wore an orlon fabric sweater. In many of his shows, he appeared in costume, performed his dance, the Soupy Shuffle, introduced many characters such as Nicky Nooney, the Mississippi Gambler, etc., and took &quot;zillions&quot; of pies in the face.

=====Los Angeles=====
In 1960, Sales moved to the ABC-TV studios in Los Angeles. ABC canceled his show in March 1961, but it continued as a local program on KABC-TV until January 1962. It briefly went back on the ABC network as a late night fill-in for &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; in 1962, but was canceled after three months. All of the puppets on the show during its Los Angeles run were also operated by Clyde Adler, whom a 1962 TV Guide listing describes as &quot;West Coast disk jockey and comedian&quot;. Sales&#x27; fame was significant enough that he was hired as a &quot;Tonight Show&quot; guest host in the period between Jack Paar and Johnny Carson.

=====New York=====

On September 7, 1964, Sales found a new weekday home at WNEW-TV in New York City. This version was seen locally until September 2, 1966. Screen Gems syndicated 260 episodes to local stations outside the New York market during the 1965–66 season. This show marked the height of Sales&#x27; popularity. It featured guest appearances by stars such as Frank Sinatra, Tony Curtis, Jerry Lewis, Judy Garland and Sammy Davis Jr., as well as musical groups like the Shangri-Las, The Supremes and The Temptations.

====The New Soupy Sales Show: Los Angeles====
&quot;The New Soupy Sales Show&quot; appeared in 1978 with the same format, and ran for one season. 65 episodes were briefly syndicated, through Air Time International, to local stations in early 1979. It was taped in Los Angeles at KTLA, with Clyde Adler returning to work as a puppeteer with Sales.

====Characters====

Clyde Adler, the show&#x27;s floor manager and a film editor at Detroit&#x27;s WXYZ, performed in sketches and voiced and operated all puppets on Sales&#x27; show in Detroit in the 1950s and in Los Angeles from 1959 to 1962, as well as in 1978. Actor Frank Nastasi, who played the part of Gramps on WXYZ-TV&#x27;s other kids&#x27; show &quot;Wixie Wonderland&quot;, assumed the role of straight man and puppeteer when Sales took the show to New York from 1964 to 1966. Nastasi was originally from Detroit and had worked with Sales at WXYZ. Appearing on the show were both puppets and live performers.

The puppets were:
* White Fang, &quot;The Biggest and Meanest Dog in the USA&quot;, who appeared only as a giant white shaggy paw with black triangular felt &quot;claws&quot;, jutting out from the corner of the screen. Fang spoke with unintelligible short grunts and growls, which Soupy repeated back in English, for comic effect. White Fang was often the pie thrower when Soupy&#x27;s jokes bombed.
* Black Tooth, &quot;The Biggest and Sweetest Dog in the USA&quot;, also seen only as a giant black paw with white triangular felt claws, and with more feminine, but similarly unintelligible, dialogue. Black Tooth&#x27;s trademark was pulling Soupy off-camera to give loud and noisy kisses.
* For a short time there was a third dog character that became White Fang&#x27;s girlfriend, Marilyn Monwolf. She caused some rivalry of affections between Black Tooth and White Fang, but later jilted them both for Joe Dogmaggio.
* Pookie the Lion, a lion puppet appearing in a large window behind Soupy (1950s), was a hipster with a rapier wit. For example: Soupy: &quot;Do you know why my life is so miserable?&quot; Pookie: &quot;You got me!&quot; Soupy: &quot;That&#x27;s why!&quot; One of Pookie&#x27;s favorite lines when greeting Soupy was, &quot;Hey bubby... want a kiss?&quot;. In the Detroit shows, Pookie never spoke but communicated in whistles. That puppet also was used to mouth the words while pantomiming novelty records on the show.
* Hippy the Hippo, a minor character who occasionally appeared with Pookie the Lion. Frank Nastasi gave Hippy a voice for the New York shows. Clyde Adler also voiced Hippy in the shows done in the late 1970s.

====New Year&#x27;s Day incident====
On January 1, 1965, miffed at having to work on the holiday, Sales ended his live broadcast by encouraging his young viewers to tiptoe into their still-sleeping parents&#x27; bedrooms and remove those &quot;funny green pieces of paper with pictures of U.S. presidents&quot; from their pants and pocketbooks. &quot;Put them in an envelope and mail them to me and I&#x27;ll send you a postcard from Puerto Rico&quot;, Sales instructed the children. Several days later, substantial amounts of money had begun arriving in the mail; Sales stated that the total amount received was in the thousands of dollars but qualified that by stating that much of that was Monopoly or play money. Sales said he had been joking, and that whatever real money had been sent would be donated to charity, but as parents&#x27; complaints increased, WNEW&#x27;s management suspended Sales for two weeks.

===Records===

One of the fans of the Soupy Sales show was Frank Sinatra. It appears Sinatra became a fan after his daughter Nancy begged him to visit the show. When Sinatra started his own record label, Reprise Records, he signed Sales to a recording contract, which produced two albums: &quot;The Soupy Sales Show&quot; in 1961 and &quot;Up in the Air&quot; in 1962.

Sales&#x27; novelty dance record, &#x27;&quot;The Mouse&quot;, dates from the mid-1960s period of his career, when his show was based in New York. The single, released on the ABC-Paramount label, peaked at #76 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in May 1965. Sales performed &quot;The Mouse&quot; on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in September 1965, just prior to The Beatles&#x27; segment on the show. Sales signed with Motown Records in 1969, releasing the single &quot;Muck-Arty Park&quot; (a play on the 1968 hit &quot;MacArthur Park&quot;), as well as the album &quot;A Bag of Soup&quot;. Soupy and Frank Nastasi also cut and recorded a comedy and song story disk, &quot;Spy with a Pie&quot;, for ABC-Paramount. It was re-released by &quot;Simon Says&quot; children&#x27;s records.

===Game shows===
From 1968 to 1975, Sales was a regular panelist on the syndicated revival of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?.&quot; (He had been a guest panelist on one episode of the original version in 1965.) He was usually the first panelist introduced and occupied the chair on the far left side (facing the camera), next to Arlene Francis. In 1969, he appeared on &quot;Storybook Squares&quot;, a children&#x27;s version of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, as Henry VIII. In 1976, he hosted &quot;Junior Almost Anything Goes&quot;, ABC&#x27;s Saturday morning version of their team-based physical stunt program. He was also a panelist on the 1980 revival of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;; he had appeared as a guest on the show during the mid- to late 1970s. Other game show appearances included over a dozen episodes of the original &quot;Match Game&quot; from 1966 to 1969 as well as one week of the revived version in 1976; a week of shows on the 1970s edition of &quot;The Gong Show; a&quot; couple of guest spots on &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; (December 12, 1977, and April 4, 1978) and a few appearances on the combined version &quot;(Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour)&quot; in 1983–84; and a recurring role in all versions of &quot;Pyramid&quot; from 1973 to 1988 and 1991 (in one famous episode of which he repeatedly uttered the word &quot;bacon&quot;, trying to get a confused contestant to say &quot;greasy things&quot;). He was considered as a host in Nickelodeon&#x27;s game show, &quot;Double Dare&quot;, but was deemed too old (the job went to Marc Summers). He also made an appearance on &quot;Pictionary&quot; in 1997.

===Radio show===

Sales hosted a midday radio show on WNBC in New York from March 1985 to March 1987. His program was between the drive time shifts of Don Imus (morning) and Howard Stern (afternoon), with whom Sales had an acrimonious relationship. An example of this was an incident where Stern told listeners he was cutting the strings in Sales&#x27; in-studio piano at 4:05 p.m. on May 1, 1985. On December 21, 2007, Stern revealed this was a stunt staged for &quot;theater of the mind&quot; and to torture Sales; in truth, the piano was never harmed. Sales&#x27; on-air crew included his producer, Ray D&#x27;Ariano, newscaster Judy DeAngelis, and pianist Paul Dver.

Sales had a sporadic film career that spanned over 40 years, including:
* 1961 – &quot;The Two Little Bears&quot;

Sales was married twice: first to Barbara Fox, from 1950 until their divorce in 1979. They had two sons, both of whom are rock musicians: bassist Tony Sales and drummer Hunt Sales. The brothers were the rhythm section for Todd Rundgren in the early &#x27;70s, then for Iggy Pop starting in the mid-&#x27;70s, and later were half the band Tin Machine with David Bowie and Reeves Gabrels, from 1988 to 1992. In 1980, Sales married dancer Trudy Carson, who survives him.

Sales died on October 22, 2009, at Calvary Hospice in Bronx, New York, aged 83, from cancer. He is buried at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York.

<text>The Northwest School (originally The Northwest School of the Arts, Humanities and Environment) is a private day and boarding school located on Seattle, Washington&#x27;s First Hill. The school was founded in 1980 and is primarily located in the 1905 Summit School building, an official City of Seattle landmark that was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

The school&#x27;s student body includes approximately 500 day and boarding students, in grades 6-12, some 16% of whom are from outside the United States. The school has attracted international students for decades, and international opportunities for domestic students range from Central America to Ethiopia.

As of 2020, school review website Niche ranks The Northwest School as the third-best boarding high school, eleventh best private high school, and the twelfth best college prep private high school in Washington state.

==History==

The Northwest School was founded in 1980 by Ellen Taussig, Paul Raymond, and Mark Terry.

Alongside the historic Summit School building and the school&#x27;s dormitory for boarding students, modern additions to the Northwest campus were completed in 2006 (expanded photography studio, library, and computer lab) and 2014 (gymnasium, fitness mezzanine, dining room, kitchen, black-box theatre and a rooftop sports field).

==Academics==

The school&#x27;s Humanities program encompasses history, literature and art history in a lecture and discussion format. All high school students take a three-year Humanities core program, one year each of Physical Science, Biology, and Chemistry, and a minimum of three years each of mathematics and a foreign language. Students take two fine art classes each year and must complete at least one class each of theater, visual art, music, and dance before graduation. Fine Arts classes are taught by recognized practitioners.

The school&#x27;s seniors undertake one advanced seminar in writing, philosophy or literature, and another in the social studies—such as an introductory law seminar, post-colonial studies, Latin American studies, Asian studies, and women&#x27;s studies. The social studies seminar requires completion of two senior projects: volunteer activity with a political campaign during the fall and a written thesis during the second half of the year. Seniors simultaneously continue with a full academic course load that includes 2-3 courses from the mathematics, science, or language departments and at least one arts course.

==Athletics==

Sports played at Northwest include Soccer, Cross country running, Track and Field, Basketball, Volleyball, Ultimate Frisbee, and Fitness Team. The school&#x27;s administration also works to facilitate student participation in city, regional and other intramural sports, such as golf, swimming, water polo and crew.

The Northwest School is very competitive in Ultimate Frisbee.[citation needed] The upper school&#x27;s varsity men have won Western National Championships in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2011, and Northwest students made up half of the team that captured the Club National Championship in the summers of 2005 and 2007. In fall 2011, the boys&#x27; varsity team had a perfect record of 23-0, winning the inaugural Seattle Invite and the Washington State Championship along the way. That year, both the male and female varsity teams won the Western National Championships and the Washington State Championships. Middle school and high school participation combined is over 30% of the student population.

Notably, Maddie Meyers placed first in the WIAA 1A state cross country championships in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011, first in the 1600 m and 3200 m at the state track championships in 2009, 2010, and 2011, and first in the 800 m at the state track championships in 2010 and 2011. She also competed in the 2011 IAAF World Youth Championships.

<text>Thomas William Roberts (8 March 185614 September 1931) was an English-born Australian artist and a key member of the Heidelberg School art movement, also known as Australian impressionism.

After studying in Melbourne, he travelled to Europe in 1881 to further his training, and returned home in 1885, &quot;primed with whatever was the latest in art&quot;. That year, he joined Frederick McCubbin in founding the Box Hill artists&#x27; camp, the first of several &quot;plein air&quot; camps frequented by members of the Heidelberg School. Together with Arthur Streeton and Charles Conder, they staged the 1889 9 by 5 Impression Exhibition, Australia&#x27;s first self-consciously avant-garde art exhibition.

Nicknamed &quot;Bulldog&quot; due to his tenacity and drive, Roberts was considered the primary force behind the Heidelberg School movement. He encouraged other artists to capture the national life of Australia, and while he is best known today for his &quot;national narratives&quot;—among them &quot;Shearing the Rams&quot; (1890), &quot;A break away!&quot; (1891) and &quot;Bailed Up&quot; (1895)—he earned a living as a society portraitist, and was the first person to push for Australia to have its own National Portrait Gallery. In 1903, he completed the commissioned work &quot;The Big Picture&quot;, the most famous visual representation of the first Australian Parliament.

==Biography==
===Family and early life===
Roberts was born in Dorchester, Dorset, England, although some mystery surrounds his actual birthdate: his birth certificate says 8 March 1856, whereas his tombstone is inscribed 9 March.

Roberts migrated with his family to Australia in 1869 to live with relatives. Settling in Collingwood, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, he worked as a photographer&#x27;s assistant through the 1870s, while studying art at night under Swiss-born landscape painter Louis Buvelot and befriending others who were to become prominent artists, notably Frederick McCubbin.

===Travels and studies in Europe===
During this period, his mother had remarried to a man whom Roberts did not get along with. He decided to further his art studies, and returned to England for three years of full-time art study at the Royal Academy Schools from 1881 to 1884. He traveled in Spain in 1883 with Australian artist John Russell and future politician William Maloney, where he met Spanish artists Laureano Barrau and Ramon Casas, who introduced him to the principles of impressionism and &quot;plein air&quot; painting. While in London and Paris, he took in the progressing influence of painters Jules Bastien-Lepage and James Abbott McNeill Whistler.

===Leader of the Heidelberg School movement===
From 1884 and through to February 1892, Roberts worked again in Victoria, and became a prominent member of the bohemian artists&#x27; society the Buonarotti Club, adopting its habit of dress with a red satin lined opera cape and a &#x27;crush topper,&#x27; though also advocating that professional artists be put in charge of the Club&#x27;s exhibition activities; so instituted a selection panel of Frederick McCubbin, Louis Abrahams, John Mather, Jane Sutherland and himself, who would select and hang the works and provide exhibitors with constructive feedback.
In the summer of 1885–86, Roberts began establishing &quot;artists&#x27; camps&quot; on the outskirts of Melbourne for the purpose of capturing &quot;en plein air&quot; the rural life and native bushland of Australia, as well as its light, heat, space and distance. At the first of these camps, the Box Hill artists&#x27; camp (now in suburban Box Hill) he initially worked alongside McCubbin and Abrahams before they were joined by other artists. The Box Hill railway station had been completed only a few years earlier, allowing for convenient access to the Australian bush. The following summer, the trio established a second camp at bayside Mentone, a popular holiday spot. On Mentone Beach, they met and befriended the young Arthur Streeton, who was then painting &quot;en plein air&quot;. Streeton became a frequent visitor to the artists&#x27; camps and a protege of Roberts, who taught him impressionistic techniques. From 1888, Roberts rented a studio in Grosvenor Chambers, at 9 Collins Street, Melbourne&#x27;s first purpose-built complex of art studios. The architects consulted Roberts on the design of the building, to ensure ideal lighting. At Grosvenor Chambers, Roberts became one of Melbourne&#x27;s most fashionable portraitists. 
Another meeting of importance was with Charles Conder, who Roberts befriended during a visit to Sydney in 1888. They painted &quot;en plein air&quot; together, creating companion views of Coogee Beach, and discussed impressionist techniques, which Conder had also picked up from expatriate artist G. P. Nerli. In October 1888, Conder followed Roberts to Melbourne, at first staying at his studio at Grosvenor Chambers.

During the summer of 1888–89, Roberts and Conder joined Streeton at his Heidelberg artists&#x27; camp, and began organising an exhibition of &quot;impressions&quot; they painted upon wooden cigar box lids, supplied by Abrahams, manager of the cigar business Sniders &amp; Abrahams. In doing so, the artists sought to capture the fleeting effects of nature in a spontaneous manner, and were intent on officially establishing themselves as &quot;impressionists&quot; and thus the vanguard of Australian art. The exhibition, named the 9 by 5 Impression Exhibition (in reference to the 9 x 5 inch dimensions of the lids), was held in August and September of 1889, at Buxton&#x27;s Rooms. Roberts was the main exhibitor with 63 &quot;impressions&quot;, followed by Conder and Streeton. McCubbin and Charles Douglas Richardson also accepted invitations to join the exhibition. It proved to be a &quot;succès de scandale&quot;, attracting scorn from a number of art critics, who dismissed impressionism as a fad. Today it is considered a landmark event in Australian art history, and the first independent exhibition of the Heidelberg School movement, named after the location of the aforementioned artists&#x27; camp. Due to his age, tenacity and influence, Roberts was considered the movement&#x27;s de facto leader. Upon moving to Europe in 1890, Conder wrote to Roberts, saying, &quot;If there is any distinct school in Melbourne, ... it&#x27;s entirely due to you.&quot;

When a severe economic depression hit Melbourne in 1890, Roberts and Streeton relocated to Sydney, where they continued to paint &quot;en plein air&quot; at artists&#x27; camps, including Curlew Camp and other camps around Sydney Harbour. From Sydney, both artists travelled into the rural districts of New South Wales, where they painted most of their iconic &quot;national&quot; pictures. For Roberts, these themes were reinforced by his association with members of Sydney&#x27;s nationalist Bulletin School of literature, centered around the periodical &quot;The Bulletin&quot;.

===Final years===

In 1896, he married 36-year-old Elizabeth (Lillie) Williamson and they had a son, Caleb. Lillie Roberts was an expert maker of picture frames, and during the period 1903–1914, when Roberts painted relatively little, much of the family&#x27;s income apparently came from Lillie&#x27;s work. Roberts spent World War I in England assisting at a hospital. Back in Australia, he built a house at Kallista, near Melbourne. Elizabeth died in January 1928, and Roberts remarried, to Jean Boyes, in August 1928. He died in 1931 of cancer in Kallista. His ashes are buried in the churchyard at Illawarra near Longford, Tasmania, one of his favourite painting spots.

==Work==

Roberts painted a considerable number of fine oil landscapes and portraits, some painted at artist camps with his friend McCubbin. Perhaps the most famous in his time were two large paintings, &quot;Shearing the Rams&quot;, now displayed in the National Gallery of Victoria and &quot;The Big Picture&quot;, displayed in Parliament House, Canberra. &quot;The Big Picture&quot;, commissioned for a fee of one thousand guineas plus expenses was a depiction of the first sitting of the Parliament of Australia in the Melbourne Exhibition Building and was an enormous work, notable for the event depicted as well as the quality of Roberts&#x27; work.
&quot;Shearing the Rams&quot; was based on a visit to a sheep station at Brocklesby in southern New South Wales, depicted the wool industry that had been Australia&#x27;s first export industry and a staple of rural life. When it was first exhibited, there were immediately calls for the painting to enter a public gallery, with a Melbourne correspondent for the Sydney press stating, &quot;if our national gallery trustees were in the least patriotic, they would purchase it.&quot; Some critics did not feel that it fitted the definition of &#x27;high art&#x27;. However, since the wool industry was Australia&#x27;s greatest export industry at the time, it was a theme with which many Australian people could identify. In this painting, as one modern reviewer has said, Roberts put his formal art training to work, translating &quot;the classical statuary into the brawny workers of the shearing shed&quot;.
Roberts made many other paintings showing country people working, with a similar image of the shearing sheds in &quot;The Golden Fleece&quot; (1894), a drover racing after sheep breaking away from the flock in &quot;A break away!&quot;, and with men chopping trees in &quot;Wood splitters&quot; (1886). Many of Roberts&#x27; paintings were landscapes or ideas done on small canvases that he did very quickly, such as his show at the famous &quot;9 by 5 Impression Exhibition&quot; in Melbourne, &quot;9 by 5&quot; referring to the size in inches of the cigar box lids on which most of the paintings were done. Roberts had more works on display in this exhibition than anyone else.
In 1888 Roberts met Conder in Sydney and they painted together at Coogee beach. The younger Conder found these painting expeditions influential and decided to follow Roberts to Melbourne later that year to join him and Streeton at their artists&#x27; camp at Heidelberg. While Conder painted Coogee Bay emphasising on the decorative qualities of form and colour, Roberts&#x27; &quot;Holiday sketch at Coogee&quot;(1888) embodies his primary focus on the landscape&#x27;s natural effects. It is an early testament to Roberts&#x27; plein-air &#x27;impressionist&#x27; technique, which brought out the sun&#x27;s glare on the bright blue sea, bleached white sand, dry grass and spindly seaside vegetation.

==Legacy==
Roberts&#x27; life was dramatised in the 1985 Australian mini series &quot;One Summer Again&quot;.

A &quot;lost&quot; painting titled &quot;Rejected&quot; was featured in a 2017 episode of the BBC series &quot;Fake or Fortune?&quot;. It was determined by experts to be a genuine Roberts, dating from his student years in London. Roberts&#x27; granddaughter considered it a self-portrait. If so, it would make it his oldest surviving self-portrait.

== Retrospectives ==
A retrospective toured Australia in 1996–97 and another was shown at the National Gallery of Australia from December 2015 – March 2016. Roberts was one of four Australian artists whose paintings featured in the &quot;Australia’s Impressionists&quot; exhibition at the National Gallery, London, which ran from December 2016 to March 2017; it was described as &#x27;the first UK exhibition of its kind&#x27;.

<doc id="866902" wikidata="Q391083" url="?curid=866902" title="Pasteur Institute">
<text>The Pasteur Institute (, ) is a French non-profit private foundation dedicated to the study of biology, micro-organisms, diseases, and vaccines. It is named after Louis Pasteur, who invented pasteurization and vaccines for anthrax and rabies. The institute was founded on 4 June 1887 and inaugurated on 14 November 1888.

For over a century, the Institut Pasteur has researched infectious diseases. This worldwide biomedical research organization based in Paris was the first to isolate HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, in 1983. It has also been responsible for discoveries that have enabled medical science to control diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus, tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, influenza, yellow fever, and plague.

Since 1908, ten Institut Pasteur scientists have been awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology—the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was shared between two Pasteur scientists.

==History==
The Institut Pasteur was founded in 1887 by the French chemist and microbiologist Louis Pasteur. He was committed both to basic research and its practical applications. From the start, Pasteur brought together scientists with various specialties. The first five departments were directed by two &quot;normaliens&quot; (graduates of the École Normale Supérieure), Émile Duclaux (general microbiology research) and Charles Chamberland (microbes research applied to hygiene), a biologist, Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov (morphological microbe research), and two physicians, Jacques-Joseph Grancher (rabies) and Emile Roux (technical microbe research). One year after the inauguration of the Institut Pasteur, Roux set up the first course of microbiology ever taught in the world, &quot;Cours de Microbie Technique&quot; (Course of microbe research techniques).

Pasteur&#x27;s successors have sustained this tradition, which is reflected in the Institut Pasteur&#x27;s unique history of accomplishment:
* Emile Roux and Alexandre Yersin discovered the mechanism of action of &quot;Corynebacterium diphtheriae &quot; and how to treat diphtheria with antitoxins
* Alexandre Yersin discovered in 1894 the pathogen of bubonic plague, &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;
* Paul-Louis Simond discovered in 1898 the role of the flea in the transmission of plague
* Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin discovered how to culture the tuberculosis bacillus, &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; (so-called BCG or Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) at Institut Pasteur de Lille, and developed in 1921 the first effective anti-tuberculosis vaccine
* Alphonse Laveran received the 1907 Nobel Prize for his research on the role of protozoans as disease agents (notably, his discovery of the malaria hematozoon)
* Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov received the Nobel Prize in 1908 for contributions to the scientific understanding of the immune system
* Constantin Levaditi and Karl Landsteiner demonstrated in 1910 that poliomyelitis is due to a filterable virus
* Félix d&#x27;Herelle discovered in 1917 the bacteriophage, a virus that spread only inside bacteria
* Jules Bordet received the Nobel prize in 1919 for his discoveries on immunity, especially the implication of antibodies and the complement system′s mechanisms of action
* Charles Nicolle received the Nobel prize in 1928 for explaining how typhus is transmitted, especially the role of the louse
* Jean Laigret developed the first vaccine for yellow fever in 1932.
* André Lwoff established the existence of proviruses in 1951, and the work honored by the 1965 Nobel Prize.
* Jacques Monod and Francois Jacob discovered the mechanism of genes&#x27; transcription regulation, a work honored by the 1965 Nobel Prize
* Pierre Lépine developed in 1955 one of the first anti-polio vaccines
* Jean-Pierre Changeux isolated the first receptor to a neurotransmitter, the acetylcholine receptor in 1970.
* Luc Montagnier, Françoise Barré-Sinoussi and colleagues discovered the two HIV viruses that cause AIDS in 1983 and 1985; Montagnier and Barré-Sinoussi were honored by the 2008 Nobel Prize

A new age of preventive medicine in France was made possible by the Institut Pasteur&#x27;s (early 20th century) development of vaccines for tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, yellow fever and poliomyelitis. The discovery and use of sulfonamides in treating infections were another of its earlier breakthroughs. Some researchers discovered antitoxins, while Daniel Bovet received the 1957 Nobel Prize for his discoveries on synthetic anti-histamines and curarizing compounds.

Since World War II, Pasteur researchers have focused on molecular biology. Their achievements were recognized in 1965, when the Nobel Prize was shared by François Jacob, Jacques Monod and André Lwoff for their work on the regulation of viruses. In 1985, the first human vaccine obtained by genetic engineering from animal cells, the vaccine against hepatitis B, was developed by Pierre Tiollais and collaborators.

===Opening===
The center against rabies, directed by Jacques-Joseph Grancher and Émile Roux, had become so overcrowded that it became necessary to build a structure that Pasteur had been calling with the name &quot;Institute Pasteur&quot; long before it was even built. Pasteur delegated the task of the project and of creating the new building, situated on rue Dutot, to two of his colleagues, Grancher and Emile Duclaux.

From the beginning, the Institute experienced economical difficulties for which it needed the help of the government, some foreign rulers, and Madame Boucicaut, but this aid did not affect its independence. 

The statutes drawn by Pasteur and later approved by Duclaux and Grancher define, besides its absolute freedom and independence, the institute&#x27;s internal structure: a rabies division controlled by Grancher, anthrax one in Chamberland&#x27;s hands, who also supervised the department of microbiology, while Emile Roux dealt with microbial methods applied to medicine.

===World War I and World War II===

During the First World War, the Pasteur institute prioritized vaccinating troops against the easily contractable typhoid fever. By September 1914, the institute was able to provide 670,000 doses of the vaccine and continued to produce it throughout the conflict.

Gabriel Bertrand, with Roux&#x27;s authorization, crafted a grenade based on chloropicrin and Fourneau discovered the chemical reaction that led to the formation of methylarsine chloride.

In 1921, Albert Simard edited the &quot;La réaction de fixation de l&#x27;alexine: son application au diagnostic sérologique de la peste,&quot; &quot;work of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, plague laboratory.&quot;

In 1938 the institute, despite its relative poverty, built a biochemical division and another one dedicated to cellular pathology, whose direction was entrusted to the hands of Boivin (who went on to discover endotoxins that are contained in the germ&#x27;s body and are freed after its death). During the same period, Andre Lwoff assumed the direction of a new microbial physiology branch built on rue Dutot. The general mobilization after France&#x27;s declaration of war against Germany, in September 1939, emptied the Institute and significantly reduced its activities, as members of appropriate age and condition were recruited into the army, but the almost total absence of battles during the first months of the conflict helped maintain the sanitary situation on the front. After the occupation of France, the Germans never tried to gather information from the institute&#x27;s research; their confidence in Germany&#x27;s advantage in this field decreased their curiosity, and their only interest was in the serums and vaccines that it could provide to their troops or the European auxiliaries they recruited. This relative freedom allowed the institute to become, during the two years after the occupation, a pharmacy for the Resistance thanks to the initiative of Vallery-Radot, Pasteur&#x27;s nephew. The Germans became suspicious of the institute&#x27;s staff only after an outbreak of typhoid in a Wehrmacht division that was stationed near Paris before being sent to the Russian front. The cause of the epidemic was later found to be due to a member of the Institute stealing a culture of the germ responsible for the disease and, with the collaboration of an accomplice, infecting a large quantity of butter used to feed German troops. The fact that the epidemic spread after the Germans sold some of the butter to civilians was proof that the illness&#x27;s breakout was not caused by local water quality. Afterward, the German authorities ordered that the institute&#x27;s stores containing microbial cultures could be opened only by authorized members; similar security problems also induced them to demand complete lists of the staff&#x27;s names and functions; missing names caused the Germans to send two biologists, Dr. Wolmann and his wife, as well as other three lab assistants, to a concentration camp. The institute was not a location for German entrenchment even during the battles for Paris&#x27;s liberation because of the honor and respect it commanded, as well as out of fear that involving it in any type of conflict might &quot;free the ghosts of long defeated diseases&quot;.

===Economical difficulties during the 1970s===
At the end of 1973, the institute&#x27;s economic status was so worrisome that its troubles aroused the public&#x27;s interest: no one could believe that an institution that was to provide vaccines and serums for more than fifty million people could be undergoing such big financial problems, an institution that furthermore was believed to be under government protection and therefore shielded from bankruptcy. The causes of the decadence that brought the institute to financial ruin were numerous, but most of them were associated with its commercial and industrial activities and its management. This affected both the research and production branch: the research branch didn&#x27;t receive enough funds and the production branch, which was losing market ground to the new private labs, was immobilized by the antiquated mechanical equipment.

In 1968 rabies reappeared in France after being previously eradicated in 1924. Despite the fact that it owed its original celebrity to the discovery of the rabies vaccine, the Pasteur institute was ultimately replaced by other pharmaceutical industries in the production of the vaccines. Despite the Pasteur institute&#x27;s financial troubles, its members were able to produce over 400,000 doses of vaccine against the Hong Kong influenza later that year.

In 1971 Jacques Monod announced a new era of modernization and development: this was symbolized by the construction of a new factory where all the production departments were to be reunited. Its construction cost forty-five million francs and the Government granted the institute a sum of twenty million francs to bridge the deficit, followed by the people&#x27;s initiative to also accept a role in the division of the financial responsibilities.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===

Pasteur was the first institute in Europe to culture and sequence the genome of what was later named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused the COVID-19 pandemic, on 29 January 2020. The institute deposited the complete sequences of the virus samples taken from two of the first French cases on the GISAID database platform. The institute has also been involved in research and development of testing and epidemiological modelling, including in Africa via its network institutions.

In 2020, Pasteur were involved in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine in partnership with Merck &amp; Co., but this was abandoned in January 2021 after unsuccessful clinical trials.

Institute Pasteur in Cambodia was a key institution involved in the public health response during the COVID-19 pandemic in Cambodia, as well as conducting research into SARS-CoV-2. Pasteur Institute of Dakar were also involved in Senegal&#x27;s health response.

==Accomplishments of the Institute&#x27;s members==

===Roux&#x27;s cure of diphtheria and studies on syphilis===

Not long after the institute&#x27;s inauguration, Roux, now less occupied in the fight against rabies, resumed in a new lab and with the help of a new colleague, Yersin, his experiments on diphtheria.
This disease used to kill thousands of children every year: an associated condition was commonly called croup, which created fake membranes in the patients&#x27; throats, therefore killing them by suffocation. It was called &quot;Horrible monster, sparrowhawk of the shadows&quot; by Victor Hugo in his &quot;Art of being a grandfather&quot;. The painter Albert Gustaf Aristides Edelfelt made a painting portraying Pasteur in his laboratory while he was trying to cure this illness.

Roux and Yersin grew the bacillus that causes it and studied, thanks to various experiments they did on rabbits, its pathogenic power and symptoms, like the paralysis of the respiratory muscles. It is this last consequence of diphtheria that provided the two researchers with a clue to the nature of the disease since it is caused by an intoxication due to a toxin introduced into the organism by the bacillus, that while secreting this particular venom is able to multiply itself: they were therefore inclined to think that the bacillus owed its virulence to the toxin. After filtrating the microbial culture of the &quot;Corynebacterium diphtheriae&quot; and injecting it into the lab animals, they were able to observe all the typical signs of the sickness. Roux and Yersin established that they were dealing with a new type of bacillus, not only able to proliferate and abundantly reproduce itself, but also capable of spreading at the same time a powerful venom, and they deduced that it can play the role of antigen, that is if they could overcome the delicate moment of its injection, made especially dangerous by the toxin.

Some German researchers had also discovered the diphtheria toxin and were trying to immunize some guinea pigs through the use of a vaccine: one of them, Von Behring, Robert Koch&#x27;s student, stated that he was able to weaken small doses of the toxin. Nonetheless, Roux was not convinced by this result, since no one knew the collateral effects of the procedure, and preferred to use serotherapy since more than one lab study – like the one accomplished by Charles Richet – demonstrated that the serum of an animal vaccinated against the disease included the antibodies needed to defeat it. The anti-diphtheria serum which was able to agglutinate the bacteria and neutralize the toxin was supplied by a horse inoculated with the viral germs, and it was separated from the blood drawn from the horses&#x27; jugular vein.

Roux needed to test the effectiveness of the product he elaborated on To test the serum, two groups of children were chosen from two different hospitals: in the first one, which received the serum, 338 out of 449 children survived, in the latter one, treated with the customary therapies, only 204 out of 520 survived. Once the results were made public by Le Figaro newspaper, a subscription fund was opened to raise the money needed to provide the Institute with the number of horses necessary to produce enough serum to satisfy the national demand.

After Duclaux&#x27;s death, Roux took his place as head of the institute, and the last research he carried out was the one on syphilis, a dangerous disease because of its immediate effects and the hereditary repercussions that result from it. Despite Fournier&#x27;s considerable work, van Swieten&#x27;s liquid mercury was still the only known cure, although its results were doubtful and uncertain. The search for a stronger remedy against this disease was made more difficult because most animals are immune to it: it was thus not possible to experiment with possible cures and study their likely side effects. The sexually transmittable &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot; (the syphilis germ), detected by two German biologists, Schaudinn and Hoffmann, affects only the human racewhere it resides in sperm, ulceration, and cancers that it is able to causeand, as it would later be discovered, some anthropoid apes, especially chimpanzees. Both Roux and Metchnikoff, following the discovery that this type of ape can be contaminated with the illness, contributed with their research in creating a vaccine, while Bordet and Wassermann elaborated a solution that was able to expose the germ&#x27;s presence in human blood. Even though it was not yet a completely reliable solution, it represented progress compared to the previous medicines used against syphilis.

===Metchnikoff&#x27;s phagocytosis theory===
Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov had already published the &quot;principle of immunization&quot; during his voluntary exile in Italy, where he went to undertake some studies, the results of which he had promptly communicated to Pasteur.
The phagocytosis theory is based on the notion that phagocytes are cells that have the power to englobe foreign bodies – and above all bacteria – introduced inside an organism. German biologists opposed to his doctrine the humoral theory: they claimed to have found in Roux&#x27;s serum some substances able to reveal the presence of microbes, and to ensure their destruction if properly stimulated. The German scientist Eduard Buchner referred to these substances as &quot;alexine&quot; and two other biologists, Von Behring and Kitasato demonstrated their lytic power towards bacteria. In 1894 one of these scientists published the result of an experiment that appeared to refute Metchnikoff&#x27;s ideas: using the cholera vibrio, discovered ten years before by Robert Koch, as an antigen, Richard F. J. Pfeiffer introduced it in the abdomen of a guinea pig already vaccinated against this disease, and was able to observe the destruction of the vibrio in the local blood plasma, without the participation of the phagocytes. Not even this study was able to shake Metchnikoff&#x27;s belief and faith in his theory, and his ideas, as well as Pfeiffer&#x27;s and Buchner&#x27;s, would all contribute to the elaboration of the current theory of the immune system.

===Yersin&#x27;s studies on the plague===
Yersin, after his research with Roux, abruptly left the Institute for personal reasons. The news of a violent plague outburst in Yunman enabled Yersin to show his potential as he was summoned, as Pasteur&#x27;s scholar, to conduct microbiological research of the disease. The plague he had to deal with was the bubonic plague, which is recognizable most of the time through the abscesses, known as buboes, it provokes in its victims. Yersin looked for the germ responsible for the infection specifically in these plague spots, tumors caused by the inflammation of the lymphatic glands which become black because of the necrosis of the tissue. After many microscopic exams he was able to state that in most of the cases the bubonic plague bacterium was located in these buboes; but in the meanwhile, the Japanese scientist Kitasato also declared that he had isolated the bacterium, even though the description he provided differed from the one given by Yersin. Therefore, although at first named &quot;Kitasato-Yersin bacillus&quot; by the scientific community, the microbe would later be called by the latter&#x27;s name because the one identified by Kitasato, a type of streptococcus, cannot be found in the lymphatic glands.

However it was Paul-Louis Simond who was the first to understand and describe the etiology of the plague and its modality of contamination: he observed small flea-bites on the bodies of the people affected by it, which he also found on the bodies of the dead rats that were linked to the plague, and then deduced that the fleas which carried the bacteria were its true vector or source, and that they transmitted the illness by jumping from the dead rats&#x27; bodies to the human ones and biting them.
===Calmette&#x27;s and Guerin&#x27;s anti-tuberculosis vaccine===
By the beginning of the 20th century, improvement of living conditions and development of a more extensive conception of hygiene produced a slight regression in tuberculosis cases in France: nonetheless the institute&#x27;s labs, like many other ones, kept trying to find among the Koch&#x27;s bacillus many singularities the one that would allow them to find an antidote. Right after he had discovered the bacillus, Koch had tried in vain to create a vaccine against it, however, the injection of the filtrate he had prepared, later called tuberculin, had the effect of revealing who was phthisic from who was not by causing in the latter—and not in the former—fever and light trembling.

The institute&#x27;s newspaper was filled at the time with articles regarding tuberculosis, some of which were written by Albert Calmette, who extended his research to a socio-professional category which was extremely affected by it, that is the miners in whom this disease is often anticipated or accompanied by silicosis and anchylostomiasis (caused by a small intestinal worm that creates a state of anemia propitious to tuberculosis). After finding a better solution to anchylostomiasis, he focused on creating a vaccine using the bacillus responsible for bovine tuberculosis, very similar to the human one, as it caused almost the same symptoms. Having observed that most actinomycetales are saprophytes, that are able to survive outside of living organisms, with the help of a veterinarian, Camille Guerin, he attempted to create an environment for the bacillus that, in time, altered its features by eliminating the virulence and leaving only the antigenic power.

The environment deemed appropriate for the denaturation of the Mycobacterium bovis was a compost of potatoes cooked in the bile of an ox treated with glycerine, and Calmette re-inseminated it every three weeks for thirteen years while checking for an enfeeblement of the pathogenic power of the bacillus. Having finally lost completely its virulence, the bovine tuberculosis germ grown with their method was the principal prophylactic weapon against human tuberculosis, and it helped to reduce considerably the frequency of this disease.

While experimenting on chimpanzees in Kindia, Calmette also discovered that it can notably weaken some leprosy manifestationsits bacillus presents some similarities with Koch&#x27;s.

===Calmette&#x27;s work in Saigon===
In Saigon Albert Calmette also created the first overseas branch of the institute, where he produced an amount of smallpox and rabies vaccines sufficient to satisfy the needs of the population and started a study on venomous snakes, particularly cobras. During these studies, Calmette discovered that the power of the venom, as well as that of tetanus, could be countered by the use of alkaline hypochlorites, and was able therefore to create a serum, effective if injected right after the cobra&#x27;s bite. Back in France, he acquired enough snakes to continue his work and create a serum for the local population.

===Nicolle&#x27;s work on epidemic typhus===
The scientist and writer Charles Nicolle while in Tunis studied how epidemic typhus – known for the red spots it left on sick people that disappeared before their death – was transmitted. His insight into the mode of transmission occurred while he was visiting the hospital: patients were washed and given clean clothes on admission, and no new cases occurred within the hospital. This made him realise that the vector of the disease were lice that were discarded with the patient&#x27;s own clothes. Nicolle managed to attract Hélène Sparrow to be Laboratory Chief in Tunis. She had worked with Rudolf Weigl who had developed a vaccine, and she was able to introduce this to Tunisia as the start of a public health programme to control the disease.
Nevertheless, three other scientists also identified the bacterium responsible for the disease: Ricketts, Russell Morse Wilder (1885–1959), and Prowazek, who called it &quot;Rickettsia prowazekii&quot;.

===Chantemesse&#x27;s typhoid vaccine===
During the summer of 1900, the extremely hot weather and scarcity of the water supply in Paris, usually ensured by the Ourcq channel and by the de la Dhuis aqueduct, forced the authorities to pump water directly from the Seine, which, despite filtering, led to a sudden and alarming outbreak of typhoid cases in Paris.
The cause of the disease, a bacillus that was discovered almost twenty years before by the German bacteriologist Karl Joseph Eberth and that looks like a bodiless spider, was constantly present in this river and not even pouring extensive quantities of ozone and of lime permanganate into its water was enough to exterminate the bacteria.
The difficulty in creating a vaccine is caused by the nature of the germ&#x27;s endotoxins. Unlike diphtheria, which releases toxins via exocytotic secretion, typhoid pathogens encapsulate endotoxins that survive even after the death of the bacillus.

After working in the rabies division of Rue Vaquelin and studying the microbe that causes dysentery, André Chantemesse collaborated with a younger bacteriologist, Georges-Fernand Widal. Together they were able to immunize guinea pigs by inoculating them with heat-treated dead bacteria, calling into question the notion that only weakened, not dead, bacteria can be used to immunize. They concluded that a series of three or four early injections of such heat-inactivated bacteria can effectively inoculate against the development of the disease, as the endotoxins alone are sufficient to trigger the production of antibodies.

===Fourneau and the Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry===
Regarding curative medicine, it was in 1911 that it took off at the Institut Pasteur, when Ernest Fourneau created the Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry, which he directed until 1944, and from which emerged numerous drugs, among which one can mention the first pentavalent arsenical treatment (Stovarsol), the first synthetic alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonist (Prosympal), the first antihistamine (Piperoxan), the first active drug on heart rate (Dacorene) or the first synthetic no-depolarising muscle relaxant (Flaxedil). The discovery of the therapeutic properties of sulfanilamide by Tréfouël, Nitti and Bovet, in the laboratory of Fourneau, paved the way for the sulfamidotherapy.

==The Hospital Pasteur==
The Hospital Pasteur was built during the first years of the 20th century in front of the institute and was employed for a long time by the members as a field for clinical observation and experimentations of therapeutical processes elaborated by themselves. Since in the beginning it was provided with only 120 beds, every patient was so well isolated in his private room that each room could be almost considered a small pest house, ideal for quarantine. The construction of the hospital was enabled by the gift of a benefactor, Madame Lebaudy, while money offered by the baroness Hirsch was used to build a large pavilion that accommodated the Department of Chemical Biology of the institute.

===Duclaux work in the chemical biology department===
The work done in the new pavilion by Duclaux clarified how the human body accomplished some of its vital functions and discovered the role of a diastase. It was critical in resolving a controversy aroused between Pasteur and Berthelot after the publication of Claude Bernard&#x27;s posthumous essay regarding the nature of the agents implicated in some transformations that happen inside plants, like fermentation. While Pasteur believed that the only substance implied in the process of fermentation was yeast, Bernard – and Berthelot in his own way – believed that some other soluble ferment was involved: the German chemist Eduard Buchner later demonstrated the existence of this &quot;ferment&quot;, an intracellular diastase which he called &quot;zymase&quot;, what we know now as enzymes. Duclaux&#x27;s study on the metabolism of nutrients did not have immediate practical applications, but later revealed how extensive is the field of enzymes and opened new roads that would lead biology to extend the knowledge on life&#x27;s mechanisms on a molecular level.

== Pasteur&#x27;s museum and tomb ==
The Musée Pasteur (Pasteur Museum) is located in the south wing of the first building occupied by the Institut Pasteur, which was inaugurated on 14 November 1888. Established in 1936, this museum preserves the memory of Louis Pasteur&#x27;s life and work in the vast apartment where he lived during the last seven years of his life, from 1888 to 1895. This museum also includes the collection of scientific objects illustrating the scientist&#x27;s work, as well as the Neo-Byzantine funeral chapel where Pasteur is buried.

==List of international locations==
Today, the Institut Pasteur houses 100 research units and close to 2,700 people, including 500 permanent scientists and another 600 scientists visiting from 70 countries annually. The Institut Pasteur is also a global network of 33 foreign institutes devoted to medical problems in developing countries; a graduate study center and an epidemiological screening unit.


The international network is present in the following cities and countries:

==Research centers==
As of 2008, the Institut Pasteur has eleven major research departments:
* Cell Biology and Infection, 
* Developmental Biology, 
* Genomes and Genetics,
* Immunology,
* Infection and Epidemiology,
* Microbiology,
* Neuroscience,
* Parasitology and Mycology,
* Structural Biology and Chemistry,
* Virology,
* Computational Biology

There are also non-research departments devoted to records and archives maintenance, maintenance of historical micro-organism cultures, publications, and the library.

In addition to the isolation of HIV-1 and HIV-2, in the recent past researchers at the Institut Pasteur have developed a test for the early detection of colon cancer, produced a genetically engineered vaccine against hepatitis B and a rapid diagnostic test for the detection of the &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; bacterium which is implicated in the formation of stomach ulcers. Other research in progress includes the study of cancer and specifically the investigation of the role of oncogenes, the identification of tumor markers for diagnostic tests, and the development of new treatments. One area of particular interest is the study of human papilloma viruses (HPV) and their role in cervical cancers. Researchers are currently focusing on the development of various vaccines against many diseases including AIDS, malaria, dengue fever and the Shigella bacterium.

Currently, an extensive line of research aims at determining the complete genome sequences of several organisms of medical importance, in the hope of finding new therapeutic approaches. The institute has contributed to genome-sequencing projects of the common yeast (&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;, an organism which was so important for Louis Pasteur&#x27;s history), completed in 1996, &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; completed in 1997, &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; completed in 1998.

==Teaching center==
Since its founding, the Institute Pasteur has brought together scientists from many different disciplines for postgraduate study. Today, approximately 300 graduate students and 500 postdoctoral trainees from close to 40 different countries participate in postgraduate study programs at the institute. They include pharmacists and veterinarians, as well as doctors, chemists, and other scientists.

==Epidemiological reference center==
Strains of bacteria and viruses from many different countries are sent to the institute&#x27;s reference center for identification. In addition to maintaining this vital epidemiological resource, the Institute serves as an advisor to the French government and the World Health Organization (WHO) of the United Nations. Pasteur scientists also help to monitor epidemics and control outbreaks of infectious diseases throughout the world. These activities have created a close collaboration between the Institute and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

==Vaccines and diagnostic products==
Production and marketing of diagnostic tests developed in the Institute laboratories are the responsibility of &quot;Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur&quot;, a subsidiary of the French pharmaceutical firm Sanofi, while production and marketing of vaccines are the responsibility of Pasteur Mérieux, Sérums et Vaccins.

==Structure and support==
As a private, non-profit organization, the Institut Pasteur is governed by an independent board of directors, currently chaired by François Ailleret. The director-general is Stewart Cole.

By drawing financial support from many different sources, the institute protects its autonomy and guarantees the independence of its scientists. The institute&#x27;s funding includes French government subsidies, consulting fees, licensing royalties, contract revenue, and private contributions.

==In popular culture==
The book &quot;The Paris Option&quot; by Robert Ludlum and Gayle Lynds begins with four men blowing up the Institut Pasteur, as a cover for stealing a molecular computer project being done there.

<text>Beborn Beton is a German synthpop band founded in 1989, with their first album release in 1993. Their debut named &quot;Tybalt&quot; is a compilation of the best tracks written in the first three years of their band history and was very well received in the electronic music scene. In 1995 the follow-up album &quot;Concrete Ground&quot; was released. After a change of record label in 1996 their break-through album &quot;Nightfall&quot; was published featuring the club-filler &quot;Im Innern Einer Frau&quot;.

The album &quot;Rückkehr zum Eisplaneten&quot; was released in 2000. It features remixes of Beborn Beton songs by artists such as Covenant, Camouflage, Neuroticfish and Daniel Myer of Haujobb, as well as remixes by Beborn Beton.

The word &quot;Beborn&quot; has no particular meaning, while &quot;Beton&quot; is the German word for &quot;concrete&quot;, which according to the band refers to the urban environment they grew up in.

<text>System Administrator Appreciation Day, also known as Sysadmin Day, SysAdminDay, or BOFH Day is an annual event created by system administrator Ted Kekatos. The event exists to show appreciation for the work of sysadmins and other IT workers. It is celebrated on the last Friday in July.

== History ==

The first System Administrator Appreciation Day was celebrated on July 28, 2000. Kekatos was inspired to create the special day by a Hewlett-Packard magazine advertisement in which a system administrator is presented with flowers and fruit-baskets by grateful co-workers as thanks for installing new printers. Kekatos had just installed several of the same model printer at his workplace.

The official SysAdmin Day website includes many suggestions for the proper observation of the holiday. Most common is cake and ice cream. There are many international websites which celebrate the holiday.

Many geek and Internet culture businesses, such as O&#x27;Reilly Media, also honor the holiday with special product offerings and contests. Various filk songs have been written to commemorate the day. The songs have reached a level of popularity where they are also covered by other performers.

Attempts to have Hallmark Cards recognize the holiday as a Hallmark Holiday have yet to be realized. Many e-card websites already have special SysAdminDay cards available.

The holiday has been recognized and promoted by many IT professional organizations, the League of Professional System Administrators, SAGE/USENIX and SNIPhub.
== &quot;Sysadmin Day&quot; around the world ==
===Russia===
Since 2006, the All-Russia System Administrator Gathering is held annually near Kaluga city. In present times thousands of people come there from more than 150 cities of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. There is also a separate event near Kaluga called LinuxFest which is held on the last Friday in July. There is also a similar regular event in Novosibirsk on the bank of Novosibirsk Reservoir.

Ekaterinburg technicians also celebrate the last July Friday. Before 2010 there were spontaneous gatherings, and since 2010 the event received official permission from Ekaterinburg authorities to be annually held near famous Keyboard monument in the city centre with support from IT companies. There are &quot;sysadmin competitions&quot; between participants: they throw defunct PC mice to reach maximum distance and also throw such mice (with their &quot;tails&quot; cut out) within an empty distant computer case used as basket. Additionally, they powerlift a bundle of unused HDDs. In 2016 during such an event a memorial plaque was set up at the monument to honor , the Ekaterinburg FidoNet organizer and Internet pioneer who died recently.

<doc id="866934" wikidata="Q994664" url="?curid=866934" title="Lockheed Martin FB-22">
<text>The Lockheed Martin FB-22 was a proposed supersonic stealth bomber aircraft for the United States Air Force, derived from the F-22 Raptor air superiority fighter. Lockheed Martin proposed its design in the early 2000s with support from certain Air Force leaders as an interim &quot;regional bomber&quot; to complement the aging U.S. strategic bomber fleet, whose replacement was planned to enter service after 2037. The FB-22 was to leverage much of the design work and components from the F-22 to reduce development costs.

Lockheed Martin suspended work on the concept following the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, which called for a new and much larger strategic Next-Generation Bomber by 2018; the program had morphed into the Long Range Strike Bomber.

==Background==

In March 1999, the Air Force released a Long Range Bombers white paper in response to a Congressional mandate for the service to update its bomber roadmap. The paper stated that the service&#x27;s current fleet of strategic bombers consisting of the B-52, B-1, and B-2 would be sufficient until around 2037, when they will need to be replaced by a new &quot;capability&quot; with an acquisition program starting in 2019. However, this target date frustrated members of Congress who hoped to see greater budgetary emphasis on the bomber mission. Furthermore, the subsequent 2001 Department of Defense (DoD) Quadrennial Defense Review identified increasing threats to U.S. power projection, and the Air Force&#x27;s aging bomber fleet. One of the key threats identified by the review was the increasing prevalence of sophisticated air defense systems which could deny airspace access to any aircraft without stealth capability. In November 2001, the Air Force released an updated white paper on Long Range Strike Aircraft, which acknowledged these challenges and also anticipated a strategic shift from nuclear deterrence to conventional precision bombing and network-centric warfare for global power projection in potentially unexpected conflict zones. Although the updated paper identified the possibility of a replacement &quot;capability&quot; entering service in the 2025 to 2030 timeframe, it cautioned that this was not an in-depth or detailed bomber roadmap. Against this backdrop, some Air Force officials began considering an &quot;interim&quot; strike capability such as &quot;regional bombers&quot; to complement the existing fleet of strategic bombers while the service and the DoD explored ideas and timelines for a longer term replacement program.

==Design and development==
In 2001, Lockheed Martin began internal studies on the feasibility of the FB-22 as the company sought to leverage the design and capabilities of the F-22 Raptor, the result of the Advanced Tactical Fighter program. The studies primarily focused on the ability to survive and perform bombing missions (i.e. air interdiction) in contested environments, in both day and night, against increasingly capable air defense systems and adversary fighter aircraft. Furthermore, experience gleaned from Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan also demonstrated the value of a bomber that could reach targets quickly and remain in theatre in the absence of surface-to-air missiles. The F-22, while designed as an air superiority fighter, embodied some degree of air-to-ground attack ability through precision strikes with Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), with further strike capability improvements planned with upgrades. Though initially unsolicited, the studies attracted the attention of several Air Force leaders, including Secretary of the Air Force James Roche in 2002.

One primary objective of the internal studies was to exploit and further expand upon the F-22&#x27;s high speed air-to-ground capability while keeping costs to a minimum. To this end, the company devised several concepts that saw significant structural redesigns with respect to the fuselage and wings, while retaining much of the F-22&#x27;s mission system avionics. With an early design later designated FB-22-1, Lockheed Martin lengthened and widened the fuselage to increase the internal weapons load; another design, the FB-22-2, had a stretched mid-fuselage for increased main bay capacity and featured an enlarged delta wing with greater leading edge sweep angle while the horizontal tails (stabilators) were removed. However, it was later found that doing so would have incurred a cost penalty of 25–30% in weight, materials and development. Instead, the company subsequently focused on leaving the fuselage intact as much as possible while enlarging the diamond-like delta wing with the same sweep angles as the F-22.
Several proposals in this vein were investigated. The FB-22-3 used the stock fuselage with enlarged delta wings and no stabilators, while the FB-22-4 was similar to -3 but with maximal wing whose leading edge met with the upper edge of the caret inlet. The FB-22-4&#x27;s maximal wing, which was around three times that of the F-22, enabled the storage of a much larger quantity of weapons and fuel. In addition, as a stealth bomber, the FB-22 was designed to carry weapons externally while maintaining stealth with the assistance of detachable and faceted pods dubbed &quot;wing weapons bay&quot;; previously, an aircraft could only remain stealthy if it carried its weapons internally. Various figures give the payload of the FB-22 to be 30 to 35 Small Diameter Bombs; this is compared to the F-22&#x27;s payload of eight of such weapons. The main weapon bay doors would also be bulged to allow internal carriage of bombs in the fuselage. By employing the wing weapons bay, the FB-22 was designed to be able to carry bombs up to in size such as the GBU-37 GPS-Aided Munition (GAM) or two 2,000-pound bombs in tandem. With stealth, the aircraft&#x27;s maximum combat load was to have been ; without stealth, .
Combat radius was almost tripled from to more than , which could have been extended further by the use of external fuel tanks. This range capability placed the aircraft in the category of a regional bomber, comparable to that of the F-111, as it was intended to replace the F-15E Strike Eagle and take over some of the missions of the B-1 and B-2. With the FB-22&#x27;s greatly increased range and endurance, Lockheed Martin also extended the forward fuselage by to accommodate a second pilot in order to reduce workload and also act as a weapon systems officer (WSO). According to &quot;Air Force Magazine&quot;, the combination of range and payload of the FB-22 would have given the concept a comparable effectiveness to that of the B-2 armed with 2,000-lb bombs. The design was to still use the Pratt &amp; Whitney F119 engines but modified for more power and optimized for subsonic efficiency rather than supercruise. While some FB-22 concepts featured no tailplanes (using research originally under the X-44 MANTA program), most design proposals incorporated twin tailplanes and likely would have fixed axisymmetric engine nozzles as opposed to the thrust vectoring nozzles on the F-22. Though not designed for supercruise, the FB-22 would be capable of supersonic dash using afterburners. Projected maximum speed varied depending on the variant; faster versions such as the FB-22-2 would have had a top speed of Mach 1.92, while the FB-22-4 with maximal wing area would have topped out at around Mach 1.5. Because the aircraft was to emphasize air-to-ground capability while maintaining stealth characteristics, the FB-22 would have lacked the F-22&#x27;s dogfighting capability although it could carry AIM-9 Sidewinders and AIM-120 AMRAAMs for self-defense against fighters.

One aspect that arose during the early stages of the design process was the consideration that Boeing would be responsible for the final assembly of the aircraft. At the time, Lockheed Martin was making the mid-fuselage at its plant in Fort Worth, Texas, while assembling the F-22 in Marietta, Georgia. However, since Boeing was responsible for the manufacturing of parts of the fuselage and more crucially, the wings—as well as integrating the avionics—it was considered prudent to give final assembly to Boeing in Seattle, Washington. Other than the wings, the aircraft would have retained much of the design of the F-22. This included 80% of the avionics, software, and flight controls. This commonality would have also significantly reduced the costs of software integration.
In February 2003, during a session with the House Committee on Armed Services, Air Force Secretary James Roche said that he envisioned a force of 150 FB-22s would equip the service. In 2004, Lockheed Martin officially presented the FB-22 to the Air Force to meet its requirement for a potential strategic bomber as an interim solution to become operational by 2018. Because of the work already done on the F-22, the cost of developing the FB-22 was estimated to be as low as 25% of developing a new bomber, with development expected to be US$5–7 billion (2002 dollars, ~$– in ), including the airframe development cost of US$1 billion (2003 dollars, ~$ in ). It was later revealed that six different versions of the bomber were submitted, as targets, payload and range had yet to be defined. However, the FB-22 in its planned form was canceled in the wake of the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review and subsequent developments as the Department of Defense favored a new strategic bomber with much greater range that would enter service in 2018. The Air Force would subsequently embark on the Next-Generation Bomber program to fulfill this goal, although the program was later re-scoped and became the Long Range Strike Bomber program resulting in the B-21 Raider.

<doc id="866947" wikidata="Q2986229" url="?curid=866947" title="Night and Day (Joe Jackson album)">
<text>Night and Day is the fifth studio album by English musician Joe Jackson, released on 25 June 1982 by A&amp;M Records. It reached the top five in both the United Kingdom and United States, Jackson&#x27;s only studio album to do so in either country. The album has been certified gold in the UK and US, and achieved platinum status in Canada. It has sold over one million copies.

The album pays tribute to the wit and style of Cole Porter (and indirectly to New York City). The track &quot;Real Men&quot; pointed obliquely to the city&#x27;s early-1980s gay culture.

&quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot; earned Grammy Award nominations for Record of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male. It reached number 6 on both the UK and the US charts. &quot;Breaking Us in Two&quot; reached number 18 in the US and number 59 in the UK.

Jackson released a sequel to the album entitled &quot;Night and Day II&quot; in October 2000.

==Reissues==
In 1997, A&amp;M released a digitally remastered CD manufactured in Europe. Not only were the tracks remastered, but &quot;Another World&quot; has an extra two bars in the intro. The crossfades for the songs were also re-created.

In 2003, A&amp;M released a deluxe version of the album with a bonus disc consisting of live tracks, demos, and songs Jackson recorded for the 1984 film &quot;Mike&#x27;s Murder&quot;.

==Track listing==
===Original LP===

===2003 deluxe edition===

This edition includes six demos, five tracks from Jackson&#x27;s soundtrack to the film &quot;Mike&#x27;s Murder&quot; and five tracks from the 1988 double live album &quot;Live 1980/86&quot;.

<text>Future plc is a British publishing company. It was started in 1985 by Chris Anderson. 

Among its titles are &quot;PC Gamer&quot;, &quot;SFX&quot;, &quot;TechRadar&quot;, &quot;Country Life&quot;, &quot;Homes and Gardens&quot;, &quot;Kiplinger Personal Finance&quot;, &quot;Decanter&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, and &quot;The Week&quot;. Zillah Byng-Thorne was chief executive officer from 2014 to 2023, when she was replaced by Jon Steinberg.

==History==

=== 1985–2012 ===
The company was founded by Chris Anderson as Future Publishing in Somerton, Somerset, England, with the sole magazine &quot;Amstrad Action&quot; in 1985. An early innovation was the inclusion of free software on magazine covers. It acquired GP Publications and established what would become Future US in 1994.

Anderson sold the company to Pearson plc for £52.7m in 1994, but bought it back in 1998, for £142 million. The company was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1999. Anderson left the company in 2001.

In 2004, the company was accused of corruption when it published positive reviews for the video game &quot;Driver 3&quot; in two of its owned magazines, &quot;Xbox World&quot; and &quot;PSM2&quot;.

=== 2012–2015 ===
Future published the official magazines for the consoles of all three major games console manufacturers (Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony); however &quot;&quot; ceased publishing in November 2012, and &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; ceased publishing in October 2014.

The chief executive and finance director both resigned at short notice after a profit warning in October 2011. It was noted that a re-structuring would be necessary as the company moved to a digital model.

Future announced it would cut 55 jobs from its UK operation as part of a restructuring to adapt &quot;more effectively to the company&#x27;s rapid transition to a primarily digital business model.&quot; The company announced in March 2014 that it would close all of its U.S.-based print publications and shift U.S. print support functions such as consumer marketing, production and editorial leadership for Future&#x27;s international print brands to the UK. Later in 2014, Future sold its sport and craft titles to Immediate Media, and its auto titles to Kelsey Media.

In April 2014, Zillah Byng-Thorne (then finance director_, was appointed chief executive to replace Mark Wood, who had been in the position since 2011.

=== 2016–2021 ===
In 2018, Future made further major acquisitions. It bought the &quot;What Hi-Fi?&quot;, &quot;FourFourTwo,&quot; &quot;Practical Caravan&quot;, and &quot;Practical Motorhome&quot; brands from Haymarket; and it acquired NewBay Media, publisher of numerous broadcast, professional-video, and systems-integration trade titles, as well as several consumer music magazines. This acquisition returned most of the U.S. consumer music magazines to Future, with the exception of &quot;Revolver&quot; which had been sold to Project M Group in 2017.

It bought the Purch Group for $132m by September 2018, and in February 2019 bought Mobile Nations including the titles &quot;Android Central&quot;, &quot;iMore&quot;, &quot;Windows Central&quot; and &quot;Thrifter&quot; for $115 million. Future also acquired &quot;Procycling&quot; and Cyclingnews.com from Immediate Media. In July 2019 the company bought SmartBrief, a digital media publisher, for an initial sum of $45 million.

In November 2019, the company bought Barcroft Studios for £23.5 million in a combination of cash and shares. It renamed it Future Studios and announced the launch of &quot;Future Originals&quot;, an anthology gaming series, a &quot;factual&quot; series focusing on the paranormal, and a new true-crime show, in partnership with &quot;Marie Claire&quot;.

In April 2020, it acquired TI Media with 41 brands for £140 million. In November, it agreed to a £594m takeover of GoCo plc, known for its Gocompare.com price-comparison website. In August 2021, it acquired Dennis Publishing and its 12 magazines, for £300 million.

=== 2022–present===

The company was criticised in February 2022 for the size of the remuneration package being offered to Zillah Byng-Thorne, the chief executive. It was noted that she could receive £40 million if the company performed well.

Byng-Thorne resigned with effect from 3 April 2023 and was replaced as chief executive by Jon Steinberg.

In April 2023, the company sold its shooting magazines including &quot;Shooting Times&quot; and &quot;Sporting Gun&quot; to Fieldsports Press.

In August 2024, the company announced that its American trade papers &quot;Broadcasting &amp; Cable&quot; and &quot;Multichannel News&quot; would be closing after more than 90 years, with the main title &quot;Broadcasting&quot; having been first published in 1931 and the merged title &quot;Multichannel News&quot; dating from 1980. In October 2024, the company closed a number of consumer titles in the United Kingdom, including &quot;Play&quot;, &quot;All About Space&quot;, &quot;Total 911&quot;, and &quot;3D World&quot;, with the monthly movie magazine &quot;Total Film&quot; ceasing publication after 27 years.

==Organisation==
In addition to media and magazines, the company has two other businesses:

* Future Studios is its video division, built upon the acquisition of Barcroft Media in 2019.
* Marketforce is its sales, marketing, and distribution company, acquired as part of a 2019 deal with TI Media.

==Brands==
Future&#x27;s portfolio of brands includes &quot;TechRadar&quot;, &quot;PC Gamer&quot;, &quot;Tom&#x27;s Guide&quot;, &quot;Tom&#x27;s Hardware&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, &quot;GamesRadar+&quot;, &quot;How it Works&quot;, &quot;Creative Bloq&quot;, &quot;CinemaBlend&quot;, &quot;Android Central&quot;, &quot;IT Pro&quot;, &quot;BikePerfect&quot;, &quot;Truly&quot;, &quot;Windows Central&quot;, &quot;Chat&quot;, and the website &quot;GoodToKnow.co.uk&quot;.

<text>Gulmit (Wakhi/), also known as Gul-e-Gulmit , in upper Hunza Gilgit Baltistan, Pakistan. Gulmit is a centuries-old historic town, with mountains, peaks and glaciers. It is a tourist spot and has many historic places, hotels, and shops as well as a museum.

== History ==
Before 1974, Hunza was a princely state, and Gulmit was the summer capital of the state. After the abolition of the state it became the tehsil&#x27;s seat of government. The oldest intact house in Gulmit is more than six centuries old. Most people in Gojal Valley have Central Asian ancestry. The people speak Wakhi language and belong to the Shia Imami Ismaili sect of Islam.

There are many forts and fortresses in Gojal valley, such as Qalanderchi fort in Misghar valley and Rashit fort in Chipursan valley, but Ondra fort is the most prominent. This fort perches on Ondra hill, which overlooks Gulmit and Ghulkin villages. The fort is believed to have been built by Qutlug Baig in the 16th century. He was the first Wakhi ruler to establish rule in Gulmit, threatening the Mir of Hunza. Before him, Gulmit was under the control of Hazur Jamshid (1550-1556), the ruler of Gilgit. His sons Su Malik and Mir Malik were deputed to collect taxes from Gojal. Once, returning from a visit to collect tax from Yishkook in Chipursan valley, the two stopped in Gulmit and liked it. They decided to live in Gulmit. After the death of Hazur Jamshid, Su Malik, the elder son, rushed to Gilgit to sit on his father&#x27;s throne. He became the new ruler of Gilgit (1556-1578). According to Muhammad Zia, celebrated genealogy-keeper (zon) of Gulmit, Mir Malik also eventually left for Hunza. Taking advantage of the absence of Su Malik and Mir Malik, Qutlug Baig with the help of locals captured Gulmit and the surrounding villages. Qutlug Baig belonged to the Charshambi Kator lineage of the Wakhis of Gulmit.

The territory of Qutlug Baig started from Khyber village and ended at Shishkat. To secure his territory from invaders, he built two gates, one at Khyber and the other at Shishkat. The gates were closed at night and opened during the day. In wartime, these gates remained closed, keeping enemies away from his dominion. The remains of both gates and fortification walls can still be seen at Khyber as well as in Shishkat.

To rein in the advance of enemies from north and south, Quitlug Baig built Ondra fort. To the north lay the State of Hunza, and to the South the power of Kirghiz invaders who used to attack Gulmit to control the pastures for their livestock.

The fort&#x27;s ramparts ranges from 6 to 13 feet above the ground. There were many living quarters inside the fort. One can still find them at two places, on the southern side and the other on the northern side. These living quarters were separated by a central wall of the fort that runs east-west. The central rampart is higher than the southern and northern fortification walls. The northern quarters were constructed for the army of Qutlug to keep an eye on the enemy advancing from the north, while the southern quarters were built to keep check on the enemy coming from the south, particularly the army of the Mir of Hunza. The fortification walls have embrasure and merlons. Only the northern and southern fortification walls have been provided embrasure. All the ramparts of the fort are still in a good condition. However, the eastern and western fortification walls are in a crumbling condition.

To secure his territory from invaders, he built two gates which were closed at night and opened during the day
The Ondra fort reflects the power of the Wakhi ruler Qutlug who was never defeated by the Mirs of Hunza. He was known for his gallantry and swordsmanship in the battlefield. Mirs of Hunza were scared by the rising power of Qutlug. They never dared to cross his territory. Qutlug was poisoned to death by one of his elderly female servants. She was sent by then Mir of Hunza Mir Malik. She administered poison in the food of Qutlug and his courtesans. After the death of Qutllug, Gulmit was recaptured and Ondra fell into hands of the Mir of Hunza.
Qutlug Baig was buried in Gulmit along with his courtesans. According to Afzal Khan, one of the notables of Gulmit, the grave of Qutlug was located where there is now the Government Girls High School in Gulmit. Qutllug ruled over Gulmit and its adjoining areas for twelve years. During his rule, land and life was safe and secure. He pushed the advancing Kirghiz back to their land and never let them succeed in their mission and goals. The heroic stories of Qulug still dominate the daily discourse of the Wakhi people living in Gulmit, Shimshal, Chipursan, the valleys of Gojal. Many storytellers still amuse both audience and themselves by narrating the stories of their ruler Qutlug Baig.
This fort is still a destination for domestic and international tourists. From Ondra fort one has a panoramic view of Gulmit. From the south one can see Gulmit and as far as Shishkat villages and from the north one can view the Ghulkin village. From the north one can enjoy seeing Gulmit tower. Ghulkin glacier, Tupopdan and Qaroon peak. From the west, there are views of Gulmit Glacier, Gulmit Tower, Shisper Peak and Utlar Sar.

<text>Strangford (Irish: Loch Cuan, Ulster Scots: Strangfurd) is a parliamentary constituency in the United Kingdom House of Commons. 

The constituency&#x27;s current MP is Jim Shannon of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), who has served since the 2010 election.

==Constituency profile==
Strangford covers the settlements either side of Strangford Lough. 

In 2024, for the first time, the town of Strangford is included in the constituency due to boundary changes, after previously being in South Down. 

The seat is strongly unionist, and one of 7 areas of Northern Ireland which voted to leave the European Union.

==Boundaries==
The seat was created after boundary changes in 1983, as part of an expansion of Northern Ireland&#x27;s constituencies from 12 to 17, and was predominantly made up from parts of North Down. At its creation the constituency was formed from the local government district of Ards, and the Castlereagh districts of Beechill, Fourwinds, Hillfoot, Lower Braniel, Minnowburn, Moneyreagh, Newtownbreda, and Upper Braniel.

In 1995, the Commission controversially recommended abolishing the constituency and dividing it between North Down and new constituencies of Mid Down, and Castlereagh and Newtownards. This was successfully opposed in local enquiries and from the 1997 general election it was made up of parts of the districts of Ards, Castlereagh and Down.

For the 2010 general election the electoral wards which made up the constituency were:

*Ballygowan, Ballyrainey, Ballywalter, Ballyhalbert, Bradshaw&#x27;s Brae, Carrowdore, Central, Comber East, Comber North, Comber West, Glen, Gregstown, Killinchy, Kircubbin, Lisbane, Loughries, Movilla, Portaferry, Portavogie, Scrabo and Whitespots, from the Ards district.
*From the Down district; Ballymaglave, Ballynahinch East, Derryboy, Killyleagh, Kilmore and Saintfield
*The Moneyreagh ward from Castlereagh district
For the 2024 general election, boundaries changed. The current electoral wards are:
==History==
For the history of the equivalent constituencies prior to 1950 please see Down (UK Parliament constituency) and from 1950 until 1983, please see North Down.

The constituency has been represented by Unionist candidates since it was formed. There have not been significant votes for parties outside the traditional unionist block, although the Alliance has saved its deposit in every election.

The main interest in elections has been the contest between the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). Until 2001, the UUP were clearly ahead of the DUP in the Westminster elections, but elections to regional assemblies and local government were much closer. In 2001 the sitting MP John Taylor stood down and the contest to succeed him was fierce. The seat was won by Iris Robinson for the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and the subsequent 2003 assembly election saw the DUP increase their vote further.

== Members of Parliament ==
The first Member of Parliament for the seat was John Taylor of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP). After the 2001 general election, he was succeeded by Iris Robinson (the wife of Peter Robinson) of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). Robinson resigned in January 2010 after a scandal involving financial dealings. However, no by-election was held, as the next general election was held in May. Jim Shannon (DUP) has held the seat since 2010.

 Note: Iris Robinson left the DUP shortly before taking Chiltern Hundreds to leave the Commons. The seat was vacant from 13 January 2010 until the general election on 6 May 2010.

<text>A bread sauce is a British warm or cold sauce made with milk, which is thickened with bread crumbs, typically eaten with roast chicken or turkey.

==Recipe==
The basic recipe calls for milk and onion with breadcrumbs and butter added as thickeners, seasoned with nutmeg, clove, bay leaf, black pepper and salt, with the meat fat from roasting often added too. The use of slightly stale bread is optimal.

==History==
A survivor of the medieval bread-thickened sauces, it typically accompanies domestic fowl such as turkey or chicken.
Bread sauce can be traced back to at least as early as the medieval period, when cooks used bread as a thickening agent for sauces. The utilisation of bread in this way probably comes from cooks wanting to use up their stale bread who discovered that it could be incorporated within sauces to make them thicker.

<text>A peltast (, ) was a type of light infantry originating in Thrace and Paeonia and named after the kind of shield he carried. Thucydides mentions the Thracian peltasts, while Xenophon in the Anabasis distinguishes the Thracian and Greek peltast troops.

The peltast often served as a skirmisher in Hellenistic armies. In the Middle Ages, the same term was used for a type of Byzantine infantryman.

==Description==
===&quot;Pelte&quot; shield===

&quot;Peltasts&quot; carried a crescent-shaped wicker shield called a &quot;pelte&quot; (Ancient Greek ; Latin: ) as their main protection, hence their name. According to Aristotle, the &quot;pelte&quot; was rimless and covered in goat- or sheepskin. Some literary sources imply that the shield could be round, but in art it is usually shown as crescent-shaped. It also appears in Scythian art and may have been a common type in Central Europe. The shield could be carried with a central strap and a handgrip near the rim or with just a central hand-grip. It may also have had a carrying strap (or &quot;guige&quot;), as Thracian &quot;peltasts&quot; slung their shields on their backs when evading the enemy.

===Weapons===
&quot;Peltasts&quot; weapons consisted of several javelins, which may have had straps to allow more force to be applied to a throw.

The size of these javelins could differ greatly from a modern olympic-style javelin. Xenophon mentions in his Anabasis an encounter with hostile Carduchians, fighting with longbows, wherein the Greeks reused carduchian arrows as javelins.They were, moreover, excellent archers, using bows nearly three cubits long and arrows more than two cubits (86 cm -112 cm). When discharging the arrow, they draw the string by getting a purchase with the left foot planted forward on the lower end of the bow. The arrows pierced through shield and cuirass, and the Hellenes, when they got hold of them, used them as javelins, fitting them to their thongs.

==Development==

In Archaic Greece, the Greek martial tradition had been focused almost exclusively on the heavy infantry, or hoplites.

The style of fighting used by &quot;peltasts&quot; originated in Thrace, and the first Greek &quot;peltasts&quot; were recruited from the Greek cities of the Thracian coast. They are generally depicted on vases and in other images as wearing the typical Thracian costume, which includes the distinctive Phrygian cap made of fox-skin and with ear flaps. They also usually wore patterned tunics, fawnskin boots and long cloaks, called &quot;zeiras&quot;, decorated with a bright, geometric, pattern. However, many mercenary peltasts were probably recruited in Greece. Some vases have also been found showing hoplites (men wearing Corinthian helmets, greaves and cuirasses, holding hoplite spears) carrying &quot;peltes&quot;. Often, the mythical Amazons (women warriors) are shown with peltast equipment.

Peltasts gradually became more important in Greek warfare, in particular during the Peloponnesian War.

Xenophon, in the &quot;Anabasis&quot;, describes &quot;peltasts&quot; in action against Achaemenid cavalry at the Battle of Cunaxa in 401 BC, where they were serving as part of the mercenary force of Cyrus the Younger.

Xenophon&#x27;s description makes it clear that these &quot;peltasts&quot; were armed with swords, as well as javelins, but not with spears. When faced with a charge from the Persian cavalry, they opened their ranks and allowed the cavalry through while striking them with swords and hurling javelins at them.
&quot;Peltasts&quot; became the main type of Greek mercenary infantry in the 4th century BC. Their equipment was less expensive than that of traditional hoplites and would have been more readily available to poorer members of society. The Athenian general Iphicrates destroyed a Spartan phalanx in the Battle of Lechaeum in 390 BC, using mostly &quot;peltasts&quot;. In the account of Diodorus Siculus, Iphicrates is credited with re-arming his men with long spears, perhaps in around 374 BC. This reform may have produced a type of &quot;&quot;peltast&quot; armed with a small shield, a sword, and a spear instead of javelins. 

Some authorities, such as J.G.P. Best, state that these later &quot;peltasts&quot;&quot; were not truly &quot;peltasts&quot; in the traditional sense, but lightly armored hoplites carrying the &quot;pelte&quot; shield in conjunction with longer spears—a combination that has been interpreted as a direct ancestor to the Macedonian phalanx. However, thrusting spears are included in some illustrations of &quot;peltasts&quot; before the time of Iphicrates and some &quot;peltasts&quot; may have carried them as well as javelins rather than as a replacement for them. As no battle accounts describe &quot;peltasts&quot; using thrusting spears, it may be that they were sometimes carried by individuals by choice (rather than as part of a policy or reform). The Lykian sarcophagas of Payava from about 400 BC depicts a soldier carrying a round &quot;pelte&quot;, but using a thrusting spear overarm. He wears a &quot;pilos&quot; helmet with cheekpieces, but no armour. His equipment therefore resembles Iphicrates&#x27;s supposed new troops. Fourth-century BC &quot;peltasts&quot; also seem to have sometimes worn both helmets and linen armour.

Alexander the Great employed &quot;peltasts&quot; drawn from the Thracian tribes to the north of Macedonia, particularly the Agrianoi. In the 3rd century BC, &quot;peltasts&quot; were gradually replaced with &quot;thureophoroi&quot; infantrymen. Later references to &quot;peltasts&quot; may not in fact refer to their style of equipment as the word &quot;peltast&quot; became a synonym for &quot;mercenary&quot;.

==Anatolian==

A tradition of fighting with javelins, light shield and sometimes a spear existed in Anatolia and several contingents armed like this appeared in Xerxes I&#x27;s army that invaded Greece in 480 BC. For example, the Paphlagonians and Phrygians wore wicker helmets and native boots reaching halfway to the knee. They carried small shields, short spears, javelins and daggers.

==In the Persian army==

From the mid-5th century BC onwards, &quot;peltast&quot; soldiers began to appear in Greek depictions of Persian troops. They were equipped like Greek and Thracian &quot;peltasts&quot;, but were dressed in typically Persian army uniforms. They often carried light axes, known as &quot;sagaris&quot;, as sidearms. It has been suggested that these troops were known in Persian as &quot;takabara&quot; and their shields as &quot;taka&quot;. The Persians may have been influenced by Greek and Thracian &quot;peltasts&quot;. Another alternative source of influence would have been the Anatolian hill tribes, such as the Corduene, Mysians or Pisidians. In Greek sources, these troops were either called &quot;peltasts&quot; or &quot;peltophoroi&quot; (bearers of &quot;pelte&quot;).

==In the Antigonid army==

In the Hellenistic period, the Antigonid kings of Macedon had an elite corps of native Macedonian &quot;peltasts&quot;. However, this force should not be confused with the skirmishing &quot;peltasts&quot; discussed earlier. The &quot;peltasts&quot; were probably, according to F.W. Walbank, about 3,000 in number, although by the Third Macedonian War, this went up to 5,000 (most likely to accommodate the elite &quot;agema&quot;, which was a sub-unit in the &quot;peltast&quot; corps). The fact that they are always mentioned as being in their thousands suggests that, in terms of organization, the &quot;peltasts&quot; were organized into &quot;chiliarchies&quot;. This elite corps was most likely of the same status, of similar equipment and role as Alexander the Great&#x27;s &quot;hypaspists&quot;. Within this corps of &quot;peltasts&quot; was its elite formation, the Agema. These troops were used on forced marches by Philip V of Macedon, which suggests that they were lightly equipped and mobile. However, at the battle of Pydna in 168 BC, Livy remarks on how the Macedonian &quot;peltasts&quot; defeated the Paeligni and of how this shows the dangers of going directly at the front of a phalanx. Though it may seem strange for a unit that would fight in phalanx formation to be called &quot;peltasts&quot;, &quot;pelte&quot; would not be an inappropriate name for a Macedonian shield. They may have been similarly equipped with the Iphicratean hoplites or &quot;peltasts&quot;, as described by Diodorus.

==Deployment &amp; Role==

&quot;Peltasts&quot; were usually deployed on the flanks of the phalanx, providing a link with any cavalry, or in rough or broken ground. For example, in the &quot;Hellenica&quot;, Xenophon writes &#x27;When Dercylidas learned this (that a Persian army was nearby), he ordered his officers to form their men in line, eight ranks deep (the hoplite phalanx), as quickly as possible, and to station the &quot;peltasts&quot; on either wing along with the cavalry. 

They could also operate in support of other light troops, such as archers and slingers. In the absence of a large enough cavalry force, or when otherwise deemed appropriate, &quot;peltasts&quot; would also pursue retreating enemies at the end of a battle, in order to capture or kill men who had thrown away their weapons or been isolated from their formation during the rout.

&quot;Peltasts&quot; (and other light troops, as ancient sources tend to group all types of light troops together) had a number of essential tasks on the march, away from the battle field that were difficult to perform for the heavy infantry. They were often used to occupy mountain passes and defensible hills which the army would have to pass, to deny enemy forces a superior attacking position. They would also lay ambushes in wooded or otherwise difficult terrain, defend the rear of the marching army against enemy pursuers, and detachments of light troops would also frequently be used to scout ahead when knowledge of the area and presence of enemies was not well established.

==Tactics==
When faced with hoplites, &quot;peltasts&quot; operated by throwing javelins at short range. If the hoplites charged, the &quot;peltasts&quot; would retreat. As they carried considerably lighter equipment than the hoplites, they were usually able to evade successfully, especially in difficult terrain. They would then return to the attack once the pursuit ended, if possible, taking advantage of any disorder created in the hoplites&#x27; ranks. At the Battle of Sphacteria, the Athenian forces included 800 archers and at least 800 &quot;peltasts&quot;. Thucydides, in the &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot;, writes They (the Spartan hoplites) themselves were held up by the weapons shot at them from both flanks by the light troops. Though they (the hoplites) drove back the light troops at any point in which they ran in and approached too closely, they (the light troops) still fought back even in retreat, since they had no heavy equipment and could easily outdistance their pursuers over ground where, since the place had been uninhabited until then, the going was rough and difficult.

When fighting other types of light troops, &quot;peltasts&quot; were able to close more aggressively in hand-to-hand combat, as they had the advantage of possessing shields, swords, and helmets.

==Medieval Byzantine==
A type of infantryman called a &quot;peltast&quot; (&quot;peltastēs&quot;) is described in the &quot;Strategikon&quot;, a 6th-century AD military treatise associated with the early Byzantine emperor Maurice. &quot;Peltasts&quot; were especially prominent in the Byzantine army of the Komnenian period in the late 11th and 12th centuries. Although the &quot;peltasts&quot; of Antiquity were light skirmish infantry armed with javelins, it is not safe to assume that the troops given this name in the Byzantine period were identical in function. Byzantine &quot;peltasts&quot; were sometimes described as &quot;assault troops&quot;. Byzantine &quot;peltasts&quot; appear to have been relatively lightly equipped soldiers capable of great battlefield mobility, who could skirmish but who were equally capable of close combat. Their arms may have included a shorter version of the &quot;kontarion&quot; spear employed by contemporary Byzantine heavy infantry.

<text>Richard Foreman (born Edward L. Friedman; June 10, 1937 – January 4, 2025) was an American avant-garde playwright and the founder of the Ontological-Hysteric Theater.

== Achievements and awards ==
Foreman wrote, directed and designed over 50 of his own plays, both in New York City and abroad. He received three Obie Awards for Best Play of the Year, and received four other Obies for directing and for sustained achievement. Foreman has received the annual Literature Award from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, a &quot;Lifetime Achievement in the Theater&quot; award from the National Endowment for the Arts, the PEN American Center Master American Dramatist Award, a MacArthur Fellowship, and in 2004 was elected an officer of the Order of Arts and Letters of France.

== Early life and education ==
Edward L. Friedman was born in New York City on June 10, 1937. He was adopted by Albert and Claire (née Levine) Foreman of Scarsdale, New York, who changed his name to Richard Foreman. Foreman&#x27;s birth mother was an orthodox Jew, and his birth father was Catholic &quot;with artistic talent,&quot; according to information he received from the Jewish adoption agency, Louise Wise Services. Both his adopted parents were Jewish. Foreman said, &quot;...my parents were very supportive, but nevertheless, I didn&#x27;t feel that close to them in certain ways.&quot; At Scarsdale High School (SHS), from which he graduated in 1955, Foreman was heavily involved in the theater department.

A 2018 documentary produced by the Lower East Side Biography Project outlined Foreman&#x27;s early motivations for pursuing work in the theater. The documentary maintains that Foreman suffered from extreme shyness as a child; it also reveals his adoption.

Foreman went on to study at Brown University (B.A., 1959) and received an M.F.A. in playwriting from the Yale School of Drama in 1962. As a freshman, he starred as Willy Loman in Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, receiving much acclaim, despite his later stated antipathy for Miller&#x27;s work. Later at Brown, Foreman founded the Production Workshop, Brown University&#x27;s student theatre group, while taking part in other student theater productions. In 1993, Brown presented him with an honorary doctorate. At Yale, Foreman studied under John Gassner, the drama critic and former literary manager at The Theatre Guild.

== Career ==

=== Early career and artistic influences ===
Richard Foreman moved to New York City directly after graduating from Yale School of Drama and worked as a manager of apartment complexes. Before finding his footing as a theater practitioner, Foreman became an avid patron of New York&#x27;s downtown experimental theater and film scene. Foreman described feeling &quot;overwhelmed&quot; upon seeing The Living Theatre&#x27;s productions of &quot;The Connection&quot; and &quot;The Brig.&quot; Foreman also attended screenings of avant-garde filmmaker Jonas Mekas at The Living Theatre. Mekas&#x27; early cinematic work had a profound impact on Foreman. In The Lower East Side Biography Project documentary, Foreman stated, &quot;those [films] really got to me. I thought this is the most poetic, beautiful, creative art that I&#x27;ve seen Americans producing.&quot; Foreman claimed that, for a long time, he was too shy to introduce himself to Judith Malina and Julian Beck (the founders of The Living Theatre) or to Jonas Mekas, but fascinated by Mekas&#x27; work, Foreman and his wife, Kate Manheim, began following Mekas as he filmed various projects in New York.

Foreman finally inserted himself into the avant-garde scene when police interrupted a screening and seized a copy of the 1963 film, &quot;Flaming Creatures&quot;, and charged Jonas Mekas, Ken Jacobs, and Florence Karpf for violating New York&#x27;s obscenity laws. Foreman called Mekas, offering his help, and over the following years, Foreman and Mekas became close friends and collaborators.

Through his connection to Jonas Mekas, Foreman became acquainted with architect and artist, George Maciunas. Foreman began working for Mekas and Maciunas, overseeing their movie theater, Film-Maker&#x27;s Cinematheque at 80 Wooster Street. Foreman also became heavily involved in the development of Maciunas&#x27; Fluxhouse Cooperatives, which consisted of converted SoHo lofts designed to be living and working spaces for artists.

During the 1960s, Foreman also got to know theater director Robert Wilson, filmmaker and actor Jack Smith, and theater director and scholar Richard Schechner, all of whom encouraged Foreman to start producing his own work. With Schechner, Foreman formed a theater collective in 1968 called &quot;A Bunch of Experimental Theaters of New York Inc,&quot; which included seven theater companies: Mabou Mines, The Manhattan Project, Meredith Monk/The House, The Performance Group, The Ridiculous Theatrical Company, Section Ten, and Foreman&#x27;s company, Ontological-Hysteric Theatre. From this point on, Foreman began producing works under the moniker &quot;Ontological-Hysteric.&quot;

==== Influence of Gertrude Stein ====
A number of scholars have called attention to the parallels between the theories of Gertrude Stein and Richard Foreman&#x27;s theatrical aesthetics. Foreman himself has spoken about the significance of her writings to his work. In 1969, Foreman declared, &quot;Gertrude Stein obviously was doing all kinds of things we haven&#x27;t event caught up to yet.&quot;

Kate Davy analyzes Stein&#x27;s influence on Foreman in her article, &quot;Richard Foreman&#x27;s Ontological-Hysteric Theatre: The Influence of Gertrude Stein&quot;. The primary connection between the works of Stein and Foreman, she proposes, is the writers&#x27; conception of consciousness in writing. Stein preferred &quot;entity writing&quot; over &quot;identity writing.&quot; According to Stein&#x27;s model, &quot;entity writing&quot; is &quot;the &#x27;thing-in-itself&#x27; detached from time and association, while identity is the &#x27;thing-in-relation,&#x27; time-bound, clinging in association.&quot; &quot;Entity writing&quot; is free from any notion of remembering, relationships, or narratives, and it expresses what Stein called the &quot;continuous present.&quot; Stein&#x27;s method of writing is meditative practice that requires the writer&#x27;s &quot;deliberate detachment of oneself from the external world while documenting one&#x27;s own consciousness in the act of writing.&quot; Therefore, this type of writing is said to reflect the workings of the writer&#x27;s mind in its presentation. Stein adopted this theory of the &quot;continuous present&quot; to her work as a playwright. She abandoned the theatrical conventions of narrative structure in favor of a theatrical experience that focuses on the real-time consciousness—one in which &quot;the spectator can move &#x27;out&#x27; of the composition, or stop, at any moment without creating syncopated emotional time.&quot;

Foreman&#x27;s theatrical experiences invoke Stein&#x27;s theories in that they both abandon narrative, focusing on the here-and-now, and they seem to include Foreman&#x27;s &quot;process of making the play&quot; in the presentation of the play. In his essay, &quot;How I Write My (Self: Plays),&quot; Foreman explains his process of taking text to performance: &quot;The writing tending towards a more receptive, open, passive receiving of &#x27;what wants to be written&#x27; and the staging tending towards more active organization of the &#x27;arrived&#x27; elements of the writing -- finding ways to make the writing inhabit a constructed environment.&quot;

Davy notes that like Stein, Foreman tends to avoid &quot;&#x27;emotional traps&#x27; or the intentional manipulation of an audiences emotional responses by eliminating the &#x27;lifelike&#x27; qualities of drama (clearly developing situation involving imaginary people in imaginary places), thereby creating a world into which the spectator has great difficulty projecting himself.&quot; Davy gives the example of Foreman&#x27;s characters often referring to themselves in the third person, which creates an alienating effect for the audience member who cannot project themself into the experience of the character. Through Foreman&#x27;s alienating characterization, the audience is made to look at Foreman&#x27;s actors as &quot;self-enclosed units,&quot; or theatrical props, rather than characters. Therefore, Foreman&#x27;s aesthetics demand that the spectator not escape into the play, but become conscious of their own process of interpretation. In Foreman&#x27;s essay, &quot;14 Things I Tell Myself,&quot; he elaborates, &quot;Our art then = a learning how to look at &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; and see not them but a relation that cannot be &#x27;seen.&#x27; You can&#x27;t look at &#x27;it&#x27; (that relation) because it &quot;IS&quot; the looking itself. That&#x27;s where he looking (you) &quot;is,&quot; doing the looking.&quot; Davy points out that &quot;by eliminating internal punctuation in long complicated sentences,&quot; Stein&#x27;s writing produces a similar effect for her readers who have to actively take part in discerning Stein&#x27;s words.

=== Ontological-Hysteric Theater ===
The Ontological-Hysteric Theater (OHT) was founded by Foreman in 1968. The core of the company&#x27;s annual programming has been Richard Foreman&#x27;s theater pieces. Foreman mounted his first production with Ontological-Hysteric Theatre in 1968 at the Film-Maker&#x27;s Cinematheque on Wooster Street, where he worked under the Fluxus leader George Maciunas. Ontological-Hysteric Theatre balances a primitive and minimal art style with extremely complex and theatrical themes. OHT&#x27;s first productions, &quot;Angelface&quot; (1968) and &quot;Ida-Eyed&quot; (1969), received almost no critical attention. By the mid-1970s, however, OHT gained traction with relatively popular works such as &quot;Sophia = (Wisdom) Part 3: The Cliffs&quot; (1972).

=== Critical analysis ===
In his 1973 essay, &quot;Richard Foreman&#x27;s Ontological-Hysteric Theatre,&quot; theater critic Michael Kirby aptly breaks down the aesthetics of OHT through the case study of Foreman&#x27;s play &quot;Sophia = (Wisdom) Part 3: The Cliffs.&quot; Kirby uses the elements of setting, &quot;picturization, speech, written material, control, movement and dances, sound, objects, relation to film, structure, content&quot;, and &quot;effect&quot; to analyze Foreman&#x27;s theatrical vocabulary. Among his observations, Kirby notes that although &quot;Sophia&quot; is a play without a plot, it produces its own kind of structure of &quot;thematic webs of visual and verbal ideas and references.&quot; Foreman achieves this visual structure through &quot;picturization.&#x27; By picturization, Kirby means that Foreman&#x27;s staging is presented as &quot;sequences of static pictures&quot; in which the actors adjust themselves into tableaux as opposed to moving continuously throughout the play. Kirby also notes that Foreman makes use of written text that is projected on screens on the set. These projected words, Kirby describes, are both direct addresses to the spectator and &quot;expository information&quot;. Kirby also writes about how Foreman literally controlled the pace and tempo of every performance of &quot;Sophia.&quot; During the performance, Foreman would sit at a table in front of the stage, controlling the projections and sound cues. By acting as stage manager, Foreman was able to insert himself into the performance as it unfolded. Kirby also discusses the role of sound in Foreman&#x27;s plays. He writes, &quot;Noise, too, serves as both background and as an explicit part of the action.&quot; At times, recordings of lines take over for the actors&#x27; actual voice, creating a sense of alienation.

==== Ontological-Hysteric Incubator ====
The Ontological-Hysteric Theater prides itself on nurturing the talents of young and emerging theater practitioners. According to their website, &quot;the OHT was a starting point for many artists making their mark in New York City and internationally including David Herskovitz, Artistic Director of Target Margin Theater, Damon Keily Artistic Director of American Theater in Chicago&quot;,&quot; Radiohole, Elevator Repair Service, Pavol Liska, NTUSA, as well as Richard Maxwell, Sophie Haviland, Bob Cucuzza, DJ Mendel, Ken Nintzle and Young Jean Lee.&quot;

In 1993, OHT began their emerging artists program by initiating the Blueprint Series for emerging directors. In 2005, OHT reorganized their emerging artists program under the name INCUBATOR, &quot;creating a series of linked programs to provide young theater artists with resources and support to develop process-oriented, original theatrical productions.&quot; The INCUBATOR programs include a residency program, two annual music festivals, a regular concert series, a serial work-in-progress program called Short Form, and roundtables and salons. The program received an OBIE grant in 2010.

=== Collaborations and work outside of the Ontological-Hysteric Theatre ===
Foreman&#x27;s work has been primarily produced by and performed at the Ontological-Hysteric Theater in New York, though he has gained acclaim as director for such productions as Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; at Lincoln Center and the premiere of Suzan-Lori Parks&#x27;s &quot;Venus&quot; at the Public Theater.

==== Stage productions ====
Foreman&#x27;s plays have been co-produced by The New York Shakespeare Festival, La Mama Theatre, The Wooster Group, Patrick Kennedy, the Festival d&#x27;Automne in Paris and the Vienna Festival. Foreman has collaborated (as librettist and stage director) with composer Stanley Silverman on eight music theater pieces produced by The Music Theater Group and The New York City Opera. He has also directed and designed many classical productions with major theaters around the world including, &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, &quot;The Golem&quot; and plays by Václav Havel, Botho Strauss, and Suzan-Lori Parks for The New York Shakespeare Festival, &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; at the Paris Opera, &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; at the Opera de Lille, Philip Glass&#x27;s &quot;Fall of the House of Usher&quot; at the American Repertory Theater and The Maggio Musicale in Florence, &quot;Woyzeck&quot; at Hartford Stage Company, Molière&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan&quot; at the Guthrie Theater and The New York Shakespeare Festival, Kathy Acker&#x27;s &quot;Birth of the Poet&quot; at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the RO theater in Rotterdam, Gertrude Stein&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights&quot; at the Autumn Festivals in Berlin and Paris. In 2024, The Wooster Group staged a new interpretation, with Foreman&#x27;s permission, of &quot;Symphony of Rats.&quot; Since 2014, British director Patrick Kennedy has staged a number of Foreman works including a 2019 season of 3 plays at New Wimbledon Theatre. Kennedy’s most recent adaptation of Foreman was at New Theatre in Sydney in 2024 with Sophia=(Wisdom) Part 3: The Cliffs. 

Seven collections of his plays have been published, and books studying his work have been published in English, French, and German.

==== Bridge Project ====
In 2004, Foreman established The Bridge Project with Sophie Haviland to promote international art exchange between countries around the world through workshops, symposiums, theater productions, visual art, performance and multimedia events.

==Personal life and death==
In 1961, Foreman married Amy Taubin; they divorced in 1972. In 1988, he married Kate Manheim.

Foreman died from complications of pneumonia at Mount Sinai West Hospital in New York City.

<text>Gojal (Wakhi: , Kyrgyz: ), also called Upper Hunza, is situated in northwestern Pakistan. It borders China at the Khunjerab Pass and the Shimshal valley, and Afghanistan at the Chapursan valley. In 2019, Gojal Valley became the second Karachukar sub-division within the Hunza District. It is geographically the largest subdivision of Gilgit-Baltistan.

Gojal or Upper Hunza is composed of a number of large and small valleys sharing borders with Central Hunza to the south, China in the northeast, and Afghanistan in the northwest. Ainabad is the first village of Gojal. Except for the Shimshal, Misgar, and Chapursan valleys, all the villages of Gojal can be seen from the Karakoram Highway (KKH), which passes through the tehsil and enters China at the Khunjerab Pass. The Gojal region has 20,000 Ismaili residents.

== History ==
The valleys and villages of Gojal were settled over time by people from surrounding regions. Kyrgyz nomads initially used the areas in Upper Gojal as winter pastures. Wakhis migrated from Wakhan to this region, the Yishkuk, Chapursan Valley, the Avgarch area of Gircha and Sost villages were settled in the upper Gojal while in the lower Gojal is considered an ancient settlement. When Hunza was under the Central Government of Gilgit the Ishkook settlement was wealthy and paid cattle and other dairy products to the Raja of Gilgit. As Hunza emerged as an independent state during the early 15th century so it can be inferred that different valleys in upper Gojal were inhabited by the Wakhi speaking migrants prior to the emergence of the Hunza state. Later, the oral history holds, a catastrophic flood destroyed the Ishkook settlement during the 18th century.

The dominance of Central Hunza or Kanjud became significant during Mir Shah Salim Khan&#x27;s period (1790-1824). Mir Shah Salim Khan was raised by his foster mother lady Gulbahar wife of Ashoor of the Budlay family of Gulmit Gojal. Lady Gulbahar was the daughter of the Qazi of Wakhan Qazi Makhtum. When Shah Salim Khan became the Mir of Hunza he paid attention to the expansion of the settlements of Gulkin and Gulmit and initiated the resettlement of Chipusan to increase revenue. One of the wives of Mir Salim Khan Princes Khushal Begum was the daughter of Qalam Ashqagha of Siriqol. Khushal Begum was gifted agriculture and grazing land and rights over-collection of taxes from settlements in Siriqol by her father. Through this, the state of Hunza extended its control to the areas of Siriqol. From Khushal Begum Mir Salim Khan had a son named Shah Abdullah Khan who was the youngest amongst five other sons of the Mir. Mir Shah Salim Khan died in 1824 in Gulmit. After the death of Mir Shah Salim Khan his elder son, Shah Ghazanfar Khan (1824-1864) became the Mir of Hunza. Mir Shah Ghazanfar deputed his younger brother Shah Abdullah Khan as the Governor of Gojal and also assigned him the additional responsibility of the Commander of the forces of Hunza. It was this time when the resettlement of Chipursan valley was materialized by moving families from Gulmit, Gulkin, Hussaini, and Passu villages and bringing major parcels of land under irrigation. During this period Hunza emerged as a regional power and extended its borders to Siriqol, Yarqand, and Wakhan. The Wakhi people of Gojal emerged as warriors and took part in many wars. The forces of Hunza fought and won wars against Khojas, Kyrgyz people, and Badakhshan. During Abdullah Khan&#x27;s period, Gojal emerged as a stronghold and the center became increasingly dependent both for its revenue and military power on Gojal. This increasing dependency on Gojal and increasing power of Abdullah Khan was seen as a threat by many in the center which resulted in the murder of Abdullah Khan by prince Ghazan Khan, the elder son of Mir Shah Ghazanfar with support from a group of killers from Altit and Karimabad. Ghazan Khan later murdered his father Mir Shah Ghazanfar also and became the Mir of Hunza.
Abdullah Khan had five children including one daughter and four sons. The daughter named Mirona was the eldest amongst all and was married in his father&#x27;s lifetime in Siriqol. Amongst his sons the eldest was Ali Parast who was married to Princes Bi Bi Aftab, the daughter of Mir Shah Ghazanfar, and was given Jagir in Hyderabad Hunza by Mir Shah Ghazafar however later during Ghazan Khan II&#x27;s period migrated to Passu, others were Muhammad Bari, Ali Fatah, and Abdullah Beg. Muhammad Bari migrated to China with Mir Safdar Khan during the British invasion of Hunza in 1891. Ali Fatah was settled in Ghulkin and Abdullah Baig in Chapursan.

After the death of Mir Shah Salim Khan who was the first-ever Ismaili in Hunza, Shah Ghazanfar and Abdullah Khan was amongst the few people in Hunza who got exposure to the Ismaili faith and became Ismaili during the first half of the 1800s. Mir Shah Salim Khan accepted the Ismaili faith as a result of the discussions with an Ismaili missionary Said Shah Ardabil during his visit to Gulmit. Mir Shah Salim was the first person in Hunza whose funeral was performed as per the Ismaili Tariqah and Chiragh-i-Roshan was performed for the first time in the history of Hunza for him in Gulmit.

In the later part of the 1800s, a major landslide near Sarat village blocked river Hunza and in three years&#x27; time, a major lake was formed which inundated major parts of the villages of Gulmit, Hussaini, and Passu. A major portion of the fertile land and orchards came under the lake. Most recently on 4 January 2010, another major landslide occurred in the same area in Atta Abad village which again inundated parts of Shiskat, Ayeenabad, and Gulmit.

=== Shimshal ===
Shimshal valley is the most Prominent village among all t the valleys of Gojal. It lies at an altitude of 3,100 m (10,170.6 ft) above sea level and is the highest settlement in the district. It is the largest valley in Gilgit-Baltistan and it covers almost area of Hunza District. Shimshal is a border village that connects the Gilgit-Baltistan area of Pakistan with China. The total area of Shimshal is approximately 3,800 km2 and there are around 2000 inhabitants with a total of 250 households.

Shimshal valley along Hispar has its largest adventure area in Hunza and is a major attraction for tourists. Distaghil Sar is the highest mountain in the Shimshal Valley, part of the Karakoram mountain range in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. It is the 19th-highest mountain on Earth and the 7th-highest in Pakistan. &quot;Disteghil sar&quot; is a Wakhi language word suggested by the Wakhi people of Shimshal, meaning &quot;above the inner ranch.&quot; Shimshalis are to Pakistan as Sherpas are to Nepal. More than thirty well known mountaineers from this valley have made Pakistan proud in the field of tourism. Some people call it &quot; The Valley of Mountaineers&quot; Its mountains like Distaghil Sar (7,885 m), Kunjut Sar (7,790 m), Trivor (7,577 m), Pumari Chhish (W) (7,492 m), Yukshin Gardan Sar (7,530 m), Momhil Sar (7,343 m), Malungutti Sar (7,207 m) Shimshal Whitehorn (6,303 m) Minglik Sar (6,150 m), Lupghar Sar (7,200 m), Dut Sar (6,858 m), Sonia Peak (6,310 m), Purian Sar (6,293 m), Yazghail Sar (6,000 m), Yawash Sar II (6176 m) and others are well known among mountains. Gigantic glaciers include Malangudhi, Yazghail, Khurdopin (5,800 m), Braldu, Odver, Ver Zharav, and main passes are Chafchingoal, Khurdopin, Mai Dur, Braldu, Boi Sam and others. Among which the Khurdopin glacier pass remains the most favorite destination for the trekkers. .

=== Shishkat ===
Shishkat is also known as Nazimabad Shishkat is the first village of Gojal valley which borders Gojal(upper Hunza) with central Hunza. The total population of the village is 2,160 individuals living within 220 households. This is dominantly a Burushaski-speaking village. However, a sizable population of Wakhi and Domaaki speakers also live in the village. The village was settled down in 1903 during the reign of Mir Nazim Khan. Before this, the barren lands were used as grazing land of the Gulmit village. Some Wakhi households from Gulmit also permanently settled down in Shishkat while the Burushaski and Domaaki people migrated from Central Hunza. The village also has historical significance because this was the battleground between the Wakhi population above Gulmit and the state of Nagar and Hunza.

=== Gulmit - The Sub-Division Headquarters ===
Gulmit is the administrative headquarters of the Gojal Sub-Division. Gulmit is a centuries-old historic town, with mountains, peaks and glaciers. It is a tourist spot and has many hotels, shops and a museum. It is located above the sea level. Gulmit consists of small hamlets called Kamaris, Odver, Dalgiram, Laksh, Kalha, Shawaran, Khor Lakhsh, Chamangul, and Goze. Gulmit is home to around 4,000 people, all of them Wakhi-speakers and followers of the Ismaili school of thought of Shia Islam.

Before 1974, when Hunza was a state, Gulmit used to be the Summer Capital of the state. After the abolition of the state it became the Tehsil&#x27;s seat of government. The oldest intact house in Gulmit is more than six centuries old.

There are six Jama&#x27;at Khanas or religious community centers in Gulmit. One notices their presence in every ward of the village. The old Summer Palace of Mir of Hunza stands at the northern edge of Gulmit&#x27;s historic Polo Ground. Old mosques, now used as libraries, also adorn the beautiful physique of Gulmit valley.

Among new buildings constructed by the government in Gulmit are Tehsil Headquarters, Federal Government&#x27;s Boys High School, Civil Hospital, Diamond Jubilee Girls Middle School, and Government Girls Higher Secondary School.

Al- Amyn Model School, a community-based organization, has a beautiful building standing next to the Health Center of Aga Khan Health Services.

=== Settlement of Passu ===
Passu is located at 125  km from Gilgit on the KKH near the border of China and is surrounded by the mountains of the Karakoram range. Its neighborhood also includes two large glaciers: Batura and Passu Glacier. It is one of the most dangerous places to live in due to the continuous threat of floods and has been flooded four times in the past. Passu is also one of the most ancient villages in the area. According to archeologists, the first human settlement in the area dates back to 3000 BC or 5000 BC. There are many ancient rock carvings of ibex and zebra on several rocks, showing that ibexes have been around in the valley for many millennia, but the area no longer houses zebras. Other wildlife animals here are snow leopards and yaks.
In the second settlement era, Chinese Buddhists lived here. The Buddhists of Gandhara, Swat, Gilgit, and Passu traveled from via this valley to go to China. Records of this settlement and subsequent migration are found in Karga Gilgit and Khurramabad Passu.
The third settlement in the history of this valley is the Islamic era. Islam came to this area in the ninth century when Muslim soldiers and traders ventured to the region. Quranic verses were etched in the mountains around the valley during this era.

The fourth era was also Islamic, which was settled here in the 18th century. This time, the area boasted a vibrant populace of 315 families. However, this village was destroyed by a natural disaster with a landslide and the nearby river was blocked. Only a few families remained safe by the landslide.
This village was destroyed once again in 1964 when the population was forced into migration by the flooding of the Shimshal River and erosion around the river bank. This time around too, the village had some 300 houses.
The majority of Passu&#x27;s native population recognizes its ancestor as a man named Qul Muhammad (famously known as Quli), who had come from Wakhan in the 15th century. In his memory, majority of the people of Passu are also known as Quli-Kutor or Kulikutz. The Quli tribe has also inhabited Karimabad, Murtazabad and many other villages of central Hunza. The Quli-Kuts in central Hunza later adopted the Burusho way of life and now speak the Burushaski language. Most of the families migrated to Chapursan and Khyber.

Among the current inhabitants of Passu are seven families: the Chuway, Magh, Din-Ali, Mohammad Sakhi, Quba, and Parasti or Miron. Parasti are decedent&#x27;s of Shah Abdullah Khan son of Mir Shah Salim Khan of Hunza. The family is named after Ali Parast, the elder son of Shah Abdullah Khan, who moved to Passu from Shahabad Hyderabad in the 1870s. During Mir Shah Ghazanfar&#x27;s time, Abdullah Khan was deputed as the governor of Gojal and commander in chief of the forces of Hunza to protect the northern frontiers.

In 1941, the people of Passu, Hussaini and other villages of upper Gojal under the leadership of Muhammad Adab Khan famous as Mahmmad Adob, son of Ali Parast mobilized a revolt against the heavy taxes imposed by Mir Ghazan Khan II on the people of Gojal and threatened the Mir to join the Bolshavik (Russia) and started marching towards the Afghan/Chinese border. His close comrades were Muhammad Hayat, Majnoon bhai, Ibadat Shah, Gul Murad, Bimal Khan, Muhammad Arif and others. The British government of India British Raj intervened and through the local administration of the Gilgit Agency, the issue was resolved by reducing the taxes to the minimum level. 

The latest figures put the population of Passu around 1,000.

=== Ghulkin ===
Ghulkin Village is located in Gojal Hunza. It is reached by following the Karakoram Highway (KKH) 
140  km north of Gilgit. This trip takes 3–4 hours by road. From a turn-off just beyond Gulmit, a winding road leads upwards for 3  km, until the ground, flattens out and the first houses of the village come into view.

Ghulkin occupies the site of an old glacier-fed lake, which has been silted up by continuous sedimentation. Many of the 140 traditional dwellings that constitute Ghulkin village are arranged in a circular form, facing the one-time shores of the lake, creating a wonderfully communal atmosphere. The central area now supports several dwellings and fields, including a strip of land often used as a cricket pitch.

There is no accurate historical record of the origin of the village, though it is estimated to be around 700 years old. According to local folklore, there were settlements here while the lake was still in existence, this area being used as pastureland in summer. The name is derived from two words of the local Wakhi dialect, &quot;&#x27;Ghulk&quot;&#x27;, meaning &#x27;well&#x27; and &#x27;kin&#x27;, meaning &#x27;whose&#x27;. Being an area of low rainfall, the most vital requirement is water for irrigation, livestock, drinking, and domestic use. Khawaja Ahmed, and Ismaili Muslims who came here with the Mir of Hunza, asked him for land.

<doc id="866971" wikidata="Q1530657" url="?curid=866971" title="Progressive lens">
<text>Progressive lenses are corrective lenses used in eyeglasses to correct presbyopia and other disorders of accommodation. They are characterised by a gradient of increasing lens power, added to the wearer&#x27;s correction for the other refractive errors. The gradient starts at the wearer&#x27;s distance prescription at the top of the lens and reaches a maximum addition power, or the full reading addition, at the bottom of the lens. The length of the progressive power gradient on the lens surface depends on the design of the lens, with a final addition power between 0.75 and 3.50 dioptres. The addition value prescribed depends on the level of presbyopia of the patient. In general the older the patient, the higher the addition. They are also known as multifocal lenses, progressive addition lenses (PAL), varifocal lenses, progressive power lenses, graduated prescription lenses, or progressive spectacle lenses.

==History==
The first patent for a PAL was British Patent 15,735, granted to Owen Aves with a 1907 priority date. This patent included the manufacturing process and design which was however never commercialized. Unlike modern PALs, it consisted of a conical back surface and a cylindrical front with opposing axis in order to create a power progression.

While there were several intermediate steps (H. Newbold appears to have designed a similar lens to Aves around 1913), there is evidence to suggest that Duke Elder in 1922 developed the world&#x27;s first commercially available PAL (Ultrifo) sold by &quot;Gowlland of Montreal&quot;. This was based on an arrangement of aspherical surfaces.

The Carl Zeiss AG &amp; Varilux lenses were the first PAL of modern design. Bernard Maitenaz, patented Varilux in 1953, and the product was introduced in 1959 by Société des Lunetiers (now Essilor). The first Varilux lenses&#x27; surface structure was however still close to a bifocal lens, with an upper, aberration-free half of the surface for far vision and a rather large &quot;segment&quot; for clear near vision. The breakthrough in user adaptation and comfort, as well as peripheral and dynamic vision however occurred in 1972 with the introduction of Varilux 2, for which Maitenaz created a totally aspheric design and manufacturing process. Carl Zeiss AG developed freeform technology in 1983 with its own patented progressive series Gradal HS.

Early progressive lenses were relatively crude designs. Right and left were identical variable power lenses with distance and reading power centers in the upper and lower part of the lens, respectively. The glazing was made to accommodate eye position changes from distance viewing to reading. The point of reading is about 14 mm below and 2 mm to the nasal side in comparison to distance viewing. By tilting the reading power towards the nasal side in perfect symmetry, appropriate reading power was given to the wearer.

The symmetric design, however, was difficult to accept for patients, because the eyes in general work asymmetrically. When you look to your right, your right eye views distal (&quot;i.e.&quot; looking through the lens near to the arm of the spectacles) while your left eye views nasal (&quot;i.e.&quot; looking through the lens near to the bridge). Modern sophisticated progressive lenses are designed asymmetrically for greater patient acceptance and include special designs to cater to many separate types of wearer application: for example progressive addition lenses may be designed with distance to intermediate or intermediate to near prescriptions specifically for use as an occupational lens, or to offer enlarged near and intermediate view areas.

The typical progressive lens is produced from a so-called semi-finished lens. The semi-finished lens is molded with an asymmetrical power pattern on the front. On the back side a custom surfacing is made to adjust the power for each patient. This method is however problematic, especially for astigmatic prescriptions. The reason being that the semi-finished front pattern is designed for a spherical prescription. Freeform designs are tailored to each prescription and do not have this problem.

Since the 1980s, manufacturers have been able to minimize unwanted aberrations by:
* improvements in mathematical modeling of surfaces, allowing greater design control;
* extensive wearer trials; and
* improved lens manufacturing and measurement technology.

Today the complex surfaces of a progressive lens can be cut and polished on computer-controlled machines, allowing &#x27;freeform surfacing&#x27;, as opposed to the earlier casting process, thus explaining the difference in price. In short, the price is based on the technology used and the year the lens came to market.

==Advantages and use==
* Compared to single vision lenses, progressive lenses provide the correction required for a presbyopic patient to see clearly at all viewing distances, typically adjusted by tilting the head slightly — or else by moving the object that is being viewed.
* Progressive addition lenses avoid the discontinuities (image-jumps) sometimes found with bifocal and trifocal lenses
* Some people find them more cosmetically attractive. Because bifocals and related designs are associated with old age, proponents have suggested the lack of visible lines makes a progressive lens appear similar to the single vision lenses worn before the onset of presbyopia.

==Disadvantages==

&quot;Peripheral Distortion:&quot; Progressive lenses suffer regions of aberrations and geometric distortions in the periphery, leading to poor vision when turning the eyes down and to the sides. Different designs of progressive lenses have more or less of this distortion.

&quot;Fitting:&quot; Progressive lenses require careful placement relative to the wearer&#x27;s pupil centre for a distance-viewing reference position. Incorrect specification of the fitting location can cause problems for the wearer including (depending on the design of the lens) narrow fields of view, clear vision in one eye only, on-axis blur, and the need to alter the natural head position in order to see clearly.

&quot;Cost:&quot; Progressive lenses are more expensive than bifocal and single-vision lenses due to higher manufacturing and fitting costs. Some research has been conducted to reduce the fabrication cost by precision injection molding.

When recommending a progressive lens design, an eyecare practitioner will usually ask the customer some questions about their lifestyle, which coupled with prescription restrictions or recommendations and cost can establish the suitability of various models of progressive lens. Different lenses have different glazing restrictions, lens material availabilities, maximum and minimum fitting heights, prescription ranges and as such the variation in quality between higher and lower end varifocal lenses is considerable.

== Adaptation ==
For those new to progressive lenses, an accommodation period is often required because the brain needs to learn to adapt to them. This period varies from a few hours for some individuals up to around two weeks. During this period, side effects can include headache and dizziness. It is advised that, when these symptoms set in, the progressive lenses be removed for a short period and replaced after symptoms have subsided. Returning to an older prescription or different type of lens design (bifocal, trifocal) only serves to increase the adaptation period to the progressive lenses. Some wearers find the visual discomfort caused by these distortions outweigh the benefits of wearing PALs; this is known as progressive non-tolerance. However, manufacturers claim acceptance rates of 90%–98%.

Depth perception and distance estimation can be influenced during the adaptation period.

<text>Mojo (, from Portuguese &quot;molho&quot; , meaning &quot;sauce&quot;) is the name, or abbreviated name, of several types of sauces, varying in spiciness, consisting primarily of olive oil, local pepper varieties (called &quot;pimienta&quot; in Spain), garlic, paprika (called &quot;pimentón&quot; in Spain), cumin or coriander, and other spices. Mojo originated in the Canary Islands, where the main varieties are green mojo (&quot;mojo verde&quot;), red mojo (&quot;mojo rojo&quot;), and spicy red mojo (&quot;mojo picón&quot;). Other countries have recipes similar to mojo, where acidic ingredients such as vinegar, lemon, orange, or lime juice may be used.

== Canarian mojo ==
Green mojo, or mojo containing green spices, is commonly used for fish, especially the proper &quot;green mojo&quot; (made with green pepper) but also coriander mojo (&quot;mojo de cilantro&quot;) and parsley mojo (&quot;mojo de perejil&quot;). As coriander mojo and parsley mojo contain some water, they need to be kept in the refrigerator and have to be consumed within two days after preparation.

Red mojo, made of small red peppers from La Palma (called &quot;pimienta picona&quot; or &quot;pimienta palmera&quot;) and paprika, is usually eaten with meat. Red and green mojo can be used interchangeably to season some dishes, prominently &quot;papas arrugadas con salsa mojo&quot;, or potatoes with &quot;mojo&quot;. Mojo is also commonly served with fresh bread rolls at the beginning of a meal.

== International variations ==

Similar sauces, also known as &quot;mojo&quot;, are also popular in Cuba and throughout the islands of the Caribbean, Hispanic or non-Hispanic, due to heavy Canarian emigration to the Caribbean, as well as Mexico, and have even influenced some barbecue sauces in the Deep South region of the United States, particularly the states of Florida, Texas, and Louisiana. 
The flavor can be made of almost everything, from tomato or pepper to avocado.
In Cuban cooking, &quot;mojo&quot; applies to any sauce made with garlic, olive oil, or pork lard, and a citrus juice, traditionally bitter orange juice. It is commonly used to marinate roast pork or as a dip for plantain chips and fried cassava (yuca frita). The sauce is occasionally called by its diminutive, &#x27;mojito,&#x27; but should not be confused with the cocktail of the same name. To create the marinade for pork, the ingredients are bitter orange juice, garlic, oregano, cumin, and salt.
In Puerto Rico, &quot;mojo&quot; is a herb sauce of finely chopped cilantro or parsley with salt, plenty of crushed garlic, and olive oil. Black pepper, butter, grated onion, vinegar, and any citrus fruit can also be added. It is commonly used on the island as a marinade for chicken roast and a dip for &quot;tostones&quot;, fried cassava, and sometimes mashed with &quot;mofongo&quot;. Puerto Rican Chef Jose Enrique (chef) mojo mixed with papaya and avocado topped on fish has become a part of Puerto Rican gastronomy. There is also a version popular in the town of Salinas, called &quot;mojito isleño&quot;, which is served with seafood, particularly fish.
In the Dominican Republic, it is called wasakaka and is used as a sauce for roasted chicken and boiled cassava. Wasakaka is made of boiling plenty of water with parsley, garlic, olive oil, and sour orange or lime juice.

<text>Sandra Ann Lauer (born 18 May 1962), later Sandra Cretu, commonly known mononymously as Sandra (), is a German pop singer who enjoyed mainstream popularity in the 1980s and early 1990s with a string of European hit singles, produced by her then-husband and musical partner, Michael Cretu, most notably &quot;(I&#x27;ll Never Be) Maria Magdalena&quot; (1985), &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (1985), &quot;Everlasting Love&quot; (1987), &quot;Secret Land&quot; (1988), &quot;Hiroshima&quot; (1990), and &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Aggressive&quot; (1992). Her albums &quot;Into a Secret Land&quot; (1988) and &quot;Close to Seven&quot; (1992) have won Sandra high critical acclaim.

Prior to embarking on a solo career, Sandra was the lead singer of the all-female disco trio Arabesque, which had a following in Japan and in Soviet Union. Also, between 1990 and 2001, she provided vocals on album releases of the very successful musical project Enigma, which had top 10 hits in North America and the United Kingdom. A cult star with a devoted fan base, Sandra remains one of the most popular singers of the 1980s in Continental Europe. During the height of her popularity, she even managed to outsell Madonna in a number of countries around the world. With sales in excess of 33 million records worldwide, Sandra has established her position as the most successful German female vocalist.

==Biography==
===1962–1984: Early life and Arabesque===
Sandra Ann Lauer was born on 18 May 1962 in the German town of Saarbrücken, close to the French border. Her French-born father, Robert Lauer (1937–2021), owned a wine store in Saarbrücken, and German-born mother, Karin (&quot;née&quot; Eltern) (1939–2020), worked in a shoe store. Sandra had an older brother, Gaston, a paraplegic who died in 1995. She showed an early interest in music and dancing, taking classical ballet at the age of five and guitar lessons when she was 10. In 1975, at the age of 13, Sandra went with her mother to see Young Star Festival, a Saarbrücken talent competition. She was only a member of the audience, but when the participants had finished performing and the jury was discussing the results, Sandra walked onto the stage and persuaded the DJ to put on the German version of an Olivia Newton-John song. The impromptu performance gained considerable recognition and led to the release of her first single, a song about a pet dog, &quot;Andy mein Freund&quot;. The single, however, performed poorly.

In 1979, now 17, Sandra joined Arabesque, a disco group consisting of Michaela Rose and Jasmine Vetter, and would become the band&#x27;s lead singer. At that time, Sandra met keyboardist Michael Cretu. They found that they shared the same birthday, albeit five years apart, and became good friends. Arabesque became successful with their cheerful music and flamboyant costumes, winning a massive following in Japan and scoring a top 10 hit in Germany in 1981 with &quot;Marigot Bay&quot;. After nine albums, emerging differences in musical interests of group members and decreasing popularity of disco/dance music signalled the group&#x27;s break-up. Sandra and Michael Cretu, by then romantically involved, moved to Munich where Michael created his own studio, Data-Alpha, named after a song from his album &quot;Legionäre&quot;. Their first single together was 1984&#x27;s &quot;Japan ist weit&quot;, a German cover of the Alphaville song &quot;Big in Japan&quot;. However, the song failed to chart with only 125 copies sold.

===1985–1992: Peak of international career===
Sandra gained international success in 1985 with the song &quot;(I&#x27;ll Never Be) Maria Magdalena&quot;, which topped the charts in 21 countries and reached the top 10 in another five. Her first album, &quot;The Long Play&quot; (1985), reached number 12 in Germany and number 2 in Sweden. The follow-up single, &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, reached number two in Germany and the top 10 in many European countries. The song also earned Sandra second place at the Tokyo Music Festival in 1986. &quot;Little Girl&quot;, accompanied by a music video filmed in Venice, became the third single from the album in 1986, but was met with moderate success. Shortly after the release of &quot;The Long Play&quot;, Sandra moved to London for six months to work with singing teacher Helena Shelen and take drum lessons. She also enrolled at the London Berlitz School of Languages to improve her English, returning to Germany at weekends to record new songs.

Sandra&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Mirrors&quot;, was released in October 1986 with &quot;Innocent Love&quot; chosen as the first single, followed by &quot;Hi! Hi! Hi!&quot;. Both of these up-tempo synth-pop offerings achieved success in continental Europe. Two further singles from the album, the ballad &quot;Loreen&quot; and &quot;Midnight Man&quot;, were only moderate successes. In 1987, Sandra released a cover version of &quot;Everlasting Love&quot;, which she said had been her favourite song since childhood, to great international success. The single was a top 10 hit in German-speaking countries and charted within the top 20 internationally. The song was included on Sandra&#x27;s first greatest hits compilation, &quot;Ten on One (The Singles)&quot;. 

Sandra and Michael Cretu married in January 1988 and moved to the Spanish island of Ibiza to work on what would be Sandra&#x27;s third studio album. &quot;Into a Secret Land&quot; moved from electro-pop to more sophisticated areas of pop, showcased by the first single, &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;. The second single, &quot;Secret Land&quot;, met with even greater success, is considered one of her biggest solo hits while &quot;We&#x27;ll Be Together&quot;, released as the third single, was the first song she co-wrote. In order to promote her music in the English-speaking world, another compilation was released at the end of 1988, &quot;Everlasting Love&quot;. The album failed to enter the charts in the USA or the UK but a PWL remix of the title track included on the album charted at number 45 in the UK. 1989 saw the release of the fin al single from &quot;Into a Secret Land&quot;, &quot;Around My Heart&quot;, which became another chart hit. With animal rights and nature conservation high on her personal agenda, Sandra took part in recording &quot;Yes We Can&quot; with 15 other performers for Artists United for Nature.

Sandra&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Paintings in Yellow&quot;, was released in March 1990 and became her highest-charting album in her home country. &quot;Hiroshima&quot; was released as the lead single and was a hit. Danceable &quot;(Life May Be) A Big Insanity&quot; and ballad &quot;One More Night&quot; were released as the second and third singles off the album, respectively, but were only modest successes. Sandra accepted an award for the best-selling German artist at the 1990 World Music Awards in Monte Carlo. Also in 1990, the singer contributed vocals to four songs for her husband&#x27;s musical project Enigma, including the worldwide number 1 hit &quot;Sadeness (Part I)&quot;.

In early 1992, Sandra&#x27;s fifth album was released, &quot;Close to Seven&quot;, which continued a more mature, less dance-orientated musical style. The album was a remarkable international success as was its lead single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Aggressive&quot;. However, the second single, &quot;I Need Love&quot;, was her first since 1984 to fail to chart. Later in 1992, a new compilation was released, &quot;18 Greatest Hits&quot;. It included most of her previous single songs and a re-recording of &quot;Johnny Wanna Live&quot;, originally from &quot;Paintings in Yellow&quot;, which was released as a single and became a minor hit in Germany and the Netherlands.

===1993–2006: Comeback attempts===

In 1993, Sandra released a new version of &quot;Maria Magdalena&quot; with a techno arrangement and futuristic music video. The re-recording turned out to be a flop. Nonetheless, she sang on three songs on Enigma&#x27;s next album, &quot;The Cross of Changes&quot;, including the hit single &quot;Return to Innocence&quot;.

While pregnant with twins, Sandra recorded and released &quot;Fading Shades&quot; in 1995. The album saw new writer-producer Jens Gad working alongside Michael Cretu and comprised mostly pop-orientated material. A cover version of &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot; by The Moody Blues was released as the first single, becoming one of Sandra&#x27;s lowest-charting singles in Germany, although it was a hit in Israel. The album met a lukewarm commercial and critical reception, and the second single, &quot;Won&#x27;t Run Away&quot;, failed to chart. After giving birth to sons Nikita and Sebastian in a Munich hospital through Caesarean section in July 1995, Sandra decided to put her career on hold. However, the following year she participated in recording two songs for Enigma&#x27;s third album 1999 saw the release of &quot;My Favourites&quot;, a double disc album featuring remixes of Sandra&#x27;s older songs and some of her favourite ballads. It was a success, charting within the top 20 in some European countries. A new version of &quot;Secret Land&quot; was released as a single, accompanied by a music video in which Sandra sported a shorter hairstyle. Her vocals again appeared in two songs on Enigma&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;The Screen Behind the Mirror&quot; as well as the project&#x27;s 2001 single &quot;Turn Around&quot;. She released ballad &quot;Forever&quot; in 2001, which was a minor chart success in Germany. It foreshadowed her next studio album, &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot;, eventually released in spring 2002, after several delays. The album was a chart success and met a positive critical response, producing two more singles, &quot;Such a Shame&quot;, originally performed by Talk Talk, and another ballad &quot;I Close My Eyes&quot;. In 2003, the DVD &quot;The Complete History&quot; was released, featuring all of her music videos. The same year, Sandra contributed vocals for Enigma&#x27;s &quot;Voyageur&quot; album, which would mark the last time she worked with the project.

After several years&#x27; break, in 2006 Sandra teamed up with Swiss singer DJ BoBo for a duet &quot;Secrets of Love&quot; on his &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album. The single was a big hit, reaching top 5 in Switzerland and top 20 in Germany. Sandra subsequently took up performing live again and began working on her next album. In late 2006, &quot;Reflections&quot; was released, an album consisting of remixes of Sandra&#x27;s biggest hits. A new ballad version of &quot;Everlasting Love&quot; was released as a promotional single in Germany while the remix of &quot;Around My Heart&quot; proved to be a big radio hit in Poland.

===2007–present: A new musical direction===

&quot;The Art of Love&quot;, a studio album, was released in February 2007. It reached the top 20 in Germany and enjoyed minor success internationally. For the first time, Michael Cretu did not participate in recording one of her albums as he was reportedly busy with Enigma; Jens Gad produced the entire work. Sandra participated in composing and writing the album, making it a reflection of the struggles in her personal life. (In November 2007, Sandra and Michael divorced and she spent the following year touring Europe.) &quot;The Way I Am&quot; was the album&#x27;s lead single, peaking at number 50 in Germany, while the second single, &quot;What Is It About Me&quot;, failed to chart. However, her version of The Hooters&#x27; &quot;All You Zombies&quot; became a big radio hit in Poland.

Her next album, &quot;Back to Life&quot;, was released in March 2009, showcasing up-tempo material influenced by Latin pop, dance, and R&amp;B. &quot;In a Heartbeat&quot; and &quot;The Night Is Still Young&quot;, the latter featuring Thomas Anders of Modern Talking, were released as singles and had modest success in Germany. Later in 2009, a three-disc compilation titled &quot;The Platinum Collection&quot; was released, featuring all of Sandra&#x27;s hit singles as well as some album tracks and extended versions.

2012 saw the release of &quot;Stay in Touch&quot;, Sandra&#x27;s tenth studio album. Produced by German DJ duo Blank &amp; Jones, the album incorporated 1980s sounds reminiscent of her early albums. &quot;Maybe Tonight&quot; was released as the first single and peaked at 77 in Germany while the second single, &quot;Infinite Kiss&quot; failed to chart. However, the album was a modest success internationally and received warm response.

In August 2014, her management was transitioned to Alexei Perschukewitsch.

==Personal life==
Sandra and Michael Cretu, who share the same birthday, were married and became parents of twin sons. They later separated.

While Cretu has been living in Germany since May 2009, Sandra remained in Ibiza and married music producer Olaf Menges in 2010, but they separated in 2014.

<text>Refractive error is a problem with focusing light accurately on the retina due to the shape of the eye and/or cornea. The most common types of refractive error are near-sightedness, far-sightedness, astigmatism, and presbyopia. Near-sightedness results in far away objects being blurry, far-sightedness and presbyopia result in close objects being blurry, and astigmatism causes objects to appear stretched out or blurry. Other symptoms may include double vision, headaches, and eye strain.
Near-sightedness is due to the length of the eyeball being too long; far-sightedness the eyeball too short; astigmatism the cornea being the wrong shape, while presbyopia results from aging of the lens of the eye such that it cannot change shape sufficiently. Some refractive errors occur more often among those whose parents are affected. Diagnosis is by eye examination.
Refractive errors are corrected with eyeglasses, contact lenses, or surgery. Eyeglasses are the easiest and safest method of correction. Contact lenses can provide a wider field of vision; however they are associated with a risk of infection. Refractive surgery may consist of either permanently changing the shape of the cornea or, alternatively, implanting intraocular lenses.
The number of people globally with refractive errors has been estimated at one to two billion. Rates vary between regions of the world with about 25% of Europeans and 80% of Asians affected. Near-sightedness is the most common disorder. Rates among adults are between 15 and 49% while rates among children are between 1.2 and 42%. Far-sightedness more commonly affects young children and the elderly. Presbyopia affects most people over the age of 35.

The number of people with refractive errors that have not been corrected was estimated at 660 million (10 per 100 people) in 2013. Of these 9.5 million were blind due to the refractive error. It is one of the most common causes of vision loss along with cataracts, macular degeneration, and vitamin A deficiency.

==Classification==

Refractive error – sometimes called &quot;ametropia&quot; – is when the refractive power of an eye does not match the length of the eye, so the image is focused away from the central retina, instead of directly on it.

Types of refractive error include myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia, and astigmatism.
* Myopia or Nearsightedness: When the refractive power is too strong for the length of the eyeball, this is called myopia or nearsightedness. People with myopia typically have blurry vision when viewing distant objects because the eye is refracting more than necessary. Myopia can be corrected with a concave lens, which causes the divergence of light rays before they reach the cornea.
* Hyperopia or Farsightedness: When the refractive power is too weak for the length of the eyeball, one has hyperopia or farsightedness. People with hyperopia have blurry vision when viewing near objects because the eye is unable to focus the light sufficiently. This can be corrected with convex lenses, which cause light rays to converge prior to hitting the cornea.
* Presbyopia: When the flexibility of the lens declines, typically due to age. The individual would experience difficulty in near vision, often relieved by reading glasses, bifocal, or progressive lenses.
* Astigmatism is when the refractive power of the eye is not uniform across the surface of the cornea because of asymmetry. In other words, the eye focuses light more strongly in one direction than another, leading to distortion of the image.

Children are typically born hyperopic and shift toward emmetropia or myopia as their eyes lengthen through childhood.

Other terminology include anisometropia, when the two eyes have unequal refractive power, and aniseikonia which is when the magnification power between the eyes differ.

Refractive errors are typically measured using three numbers: sphere, cylinder, and axis.
* Sphere: This number denotes the strength of the lens needed to correct your vision. A &quot;–&quot; indicates nearsightedness while a &quot;+&quot; indicates farsightedness. Higher numbers indicate more power in either direction.
* Cylinder: This number denotes the amount of astigmatism, if any.
* Axis: This number notes the direction of the astigmatism and is written in degrees between 1 and 180.

An eye that has no refractive error when viewing distant objects is said to have &quot;emmetropia&quot; or be &quot;emmetropic&quot; meaning the eye is in a state in which it can focus parallel rays of light (light from distant objects) on the retina, without using any accommodation. A distant object, in this case, is defined as an object located beyond 6 meters, or 20 feet, from the eye, since the light from those objects arrives as essentially parallel rays when considering the limitations of human perception.

==Risk factors==

===Genetics===

There is evidence to suggest genetic predilection for refractive error. Individuals that have parents with certain refractive errors are more likely to have similar refractive errors.

The Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database has listed 261 genetic disorders in which myopia is one of the symptoms. Myopia may be present in heritable connective tissue disorders such as: Knobloch syndrome (OMIM 267750); Marfan syndrome (OMIM 154700); and Stickler syndrome (type 1, OMIM 108300; type 2, OMIM 604841). Myopia has also been reported in X-linked disorders caused by mutations in loci involved in retinal photoreceptor function (NYX, RP2, MYP1) such as: autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB; OMIM 310500); retinitis pigmentosa 2 (RP2; OMIM 312600); Bornholm eye disease (OMIM 310460).
Many genes that have been associated with refractive error are clustered into common biological networks involved in connective tissue growth and extracellular matrix organization. Although a large number of chromosomal localisations have been associated with myopia (MYP1-MYP17), few specific genes have been identified.

===Environmental===
In studies of the genetic predisposition of refractive error, there is a correlation between environmental factors and the risk of developing myopia. Myopia has been observed in individuals with visually intensive occupations. Reading has also been found to be a predictor of myopia in children. It has been reported that children with myopia spent significantly more time reading than non-myopic children who spent more time playing outdoors. Additionally, focusing on near objects for long periods of time - such as when reading, looking at close screens, or writing - has been associated with myopia. Socioeconomic status and higher levels of education have also been reported to be a risk factor for myopia. Blepharoptosis can also induce refractive errors.
== Normal Refraction ==
In order to see a clear image, the eye must focus rays of light on to the light-sensing part of the eye – the retina, which is located in the back of the eye. This focusing – called refraction – is performed mainly by the cornea and the lens, which are located at the front of the eye, the anterior segment.

When an eye focuses light correctly on to the retina when viewing distant objects, this is called &quot;emmetropia&quot; or being &quot;emmetropic.&quot; This means that the refractive power of the eye matches what is needed to focus parallel rays of light onto the retina. A distant object is defined as an object located beyond 6 meters (20 feet) from the eye.

When an object is located close to the eye, the rays of light from this object no longer approach the eye parallel to each other. Consequently, the eye must &quot;increase&quot; its refractive power to bring those rays of light together on the retina. This is called accommodation, and is accomplished by the eye thickening the lens.

==Diagnosis==

Blurry vision may result from any number of conditions not necessarily related to refractive errors. The diagnosis of a refractive error is usually confirmed by an eye care professional during an eye examination using a large number of lenses of different optical powers, and often a retinoscope (a procedure entitled &quot;retinoscopy&quot;) to measure objectively in which the person views a distant spot while the clinician changes the lenses held before the person&#x27;s eye and watches the pattern of reflection of a small light shone on the eye. Following that &quot;objective refraction&quot; the clinician typically shows the person lenses of progressively higher or weaker powers in a process known as &quot;subjective refraction&quot;.
Cycloplegic agents are frequently used to more accurately determine the amount of refractive error, particularly in children

An automated refractor is an instrument that is sometimes used in place of retinoscopy to objectively estimate a person&#x27;s refractive error. Shack–Hartmann wavefront sensor and its inverse can also be used to characterize eye aberrations in a higher level of resolution and accuracy.

Vision defects caused by refractive error can be distinguished from other problems using a pinhole occluder, which will improve vision only in the case of refractive error.
== Screening ==
When refractive errors in children are not treated, the child may be at risk of developing ambylopia, where vision may remain permanently blurry. Because young children typically do not complain of blurry vision, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children have yearly vision screening starting at three years old so that unknown refractive errors or other ophthalmic conditions can be found and treated if deemed necessary by healthcare professionals.

==Management==
The management of refractive error is done post-diagnosis of the condition by either optometrists, ophthalmologists, refractionists, or ophthalmic medical practitioners.

How refractive errors are treated or managed depends upon the amount and severity of the condition. Those who possess mild amounts of refractive error may elect to leave the condition uncorrected, particularly if the person is asymptomatic. For those who are symptomatic, glasses, contact lenses, refractive surgery, or a combination are typically used.

=== Glasses ===
These are the most effective ways of correcting the refractive error. However, the availability and affordability of eyeglasses can present a difficulty for people in many low income settings of the world. Glasses also pose a challenge to children to whom they are prescribed to, due to children&#x27;s tendency to not wear them as consistently as recommended.

As mentioned earlier refractive errors are because of the improper focusing of the light in the retina. Eyeglasses work as an added lens of the eye serving to bend the light to bring it to focus on the retina. Depending on the eyeglasses, they serve many functions.

; Reading glasses: These are general over-the-counter glasses which can be worn for easier reading, especially for defective vision due to aging called presbyopia.
; Single vision prescription lenses: They can correct only one form of defective vision, either far-sightedness or near-sightedness.
; Multifocal lenses: The multifocal lenses can correct defective vision in multiple focus, for example: near-vision as well as far-vision. This are particularly beneficial for presbyobia.

=== Contact lenses ===
Alternatively, many people choose to wear contact lenses. One style is hard contact lenses, which can distort the shape of the cornea to a desired shape. Another style, soft contact lenses, are made of silicone or hydrogel. Depending on the duration they are designed for, they may be worn daily or may be worn for an extended period of time, such as for weeks.

There are a number of complication associated with contact lenses. Typically the ones that are used daily.
If redness, itching, and difficulty in vision develops, the use of the lenses should be stopped immediately and the consultation of ophthalmologists may be sought.

=== Surgery ===
Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and photo-refractive keratectomy (PRK) are popular procedures; while use of laser epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK) is increasing. Other surgical treatments for severe myopia include insertion of implants after clear lens extraction (refractive lens exchange). Full thickness corneal graft may be a final option for patients with advanced kerataconus although currently there is interest in new techniques that involve collagen crosslinking. As with any surgical procedure complications may arise post-operatively Post-operative monitoring is normally undertaken by the specialist ophthalmic surgical clinic and optometry services. Patients are usually informed pre-operatively about what to expect and where to go if they suspect complications. Any patient reporting pain and redness after surgery should be referred urgently to their ophthalmic surgeon.

=== Medical treatment ===
Atropine has believed to slow the progression of near-sightedness and is administered in combination with multifocal lenses. These, however, need further research.

=== Prevention ===
Strategies being studied to slow worsening include adjusting working conditions, increasing the time children spend outdoors, and special types of contact lenses. In children special contact lenses appear to slow worsening of nearsightedness.

A number of questionnaires exist to determine quality of life impact of refractive errors and their correction.

==Epidemiology==

It is estimated that at least 2 billion people in the world have refractive errors. The number of people globally with refractive errors that have not been corrected was estimated at 660 million (10 per 100 people) in 2013.

Refractive errors are the first common cause of visual impairment and second most common cause of visual loss . The assessment of refractive error is now done in DALY (Disability Adjusted Life Years) which showed an 8% increase from 1990 to 2019.

The number of people globally with significant refractive errors has been estimated at one to two billion. Rates vary between regions of the world with about 25% of Europeans and 80% of Asians affected. Near-sightedness is one of the most prevalent disorders of the eye. Rates among adults are between 15 and 49% while rates among children are between 1.2 and 42%. Far-sightedness more commonly affects young children, whose eyes have yet to grow to their full length, and the elderly, who have lost the ability to compensate with their accommodation system. Presbyopia affects most people over the age of 35, and nearly 100% of people by the ages of 55–65. Uncorrected refractive error is responsible for visual impairment and disability for many people worldwide. It is one of the most common causes of vision loss along with cataracts, macular degeneration, and vitamin A deficiency.

==Cost==
The yearly cost of correcting refractive errors is estimated at 3.9 to 7.2 billion dollars in the United States.

<doc id="866991" wikidata="Q1548253" url="?curid=866991" title="Great conjunction">
<text>A great conjunction is a conjunction of the planets Jupiter and Saturn, when the two planets appear closest together in the sky. Great conjunctions occur approximately every 20 years when Jupiter &quot;overtakes&quot; Saturn in its orbit. They are named &quot;great&quot; for being by far the rarest of the conjunctions between naked-eye planets (i.e. excluding Uranus and Neptune).

The spacing between the planets varies from conjunction to conjunction with most events being 0.5 to 1.3 degrees (30 to 78 arcminutes, or 1 to 2.5 times the width of a full moon). Very close conjunctions happen much less frequently (though the maximum of 1.3° is still close by inner planet standards): separations of less than 10 arcminutes have only happened four times since 1200, most recently in 2020.

== In history ==

Great conjunctions attracted considerable attention in the past as omens. During the late Middle Ages and Renaissance they were a topic broached by the pre-scientific and transitional astronomer-astrologers of the period up to the time of Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler, by scholastic thinkers such as Roger Bacon and Pierre d&#x27;Ailly, and they are mentioned in popular and literary works by authors such as Dante, Lope de Vega, and Shakespeare. This interest is traced back in Europe to translations of Arabic texts, especially Albumasar&#x27;s book on conjunctions.

Clusterings of several planets were considered even more significant. The Chinese apparently remembered the clustering of all five planets in 1953 BC, and noted the clustering of all but Venus in 1576 BC and of all five in 1059 BC. These were connected in Chinese thought to the founding of the first three historical dynasties, the Xia dynasty, the Shang dynasty, and the Zhou dynasty. The intervals involved, of 377.8 years (19 great conjunction intervals) and 516.4 years (26 great conjunction intervals) bring Mars back to approximately the same position. Further repeats of the 516-year period lead to the clustering in AD 1524, considered ominous in Europe at the time of the Radical Reformation, and the upcoming clustering of September 2040, which will involve all five planets again, in a longitude span of less than 7°.

== Celestial mechanics ==
On average, great conjunction seasons occur once every 19.859 Julian years (each of which is 365.25 days). This number can be calculated by the synodic period formula

:formula_1

in which and are the orbital periods of Jupiter (4332.59 days) and Saturn (10759.22 days), respectively. This is about 52 days less than 20 years, but in practice, Earth&#x27;s orbit size can cause great conjunctions to reoccur anytime between 18 years 10 months and 20 years 8 months after the previous one. (See table below.) Since the equivalent periods of other naked-eye planet pairs are all under 900 days, this makes great conjunctions the rarest.

Occasionally there is more than one great conjunction in a season, which happens whenever they&#x27;re close enough to opposition: this is called a triple conjunction (which is not exclusive to great conjunctions). In this scenario, Jupiter and Saturn will occupy the same right ascension on three occasions or same ecliptic longitude on three occasions, depending on which definition of &quot;conjunction&quot; one uses (this is due to apparent retrograde motion and happens within months). The most recent triple conjunction occurred in 1980–81 and the next will be in 2238–39.

The most recent great conjunction occurred on 21 December 2020, and the next will occur on 4 November 2040. During the 2020 great conjunction, the two planets were separated in the sky by 6 arcminutes at their closest point, which was the closest distance between the two planets since 1623. The closeness is the result of the conjunction occurring in the vicinity of one of the two longitudes where the two orbits appear to intersect when viewed from the Sun (which has a point of view similar to Earth).

Because 19.859 years is equal to 1.674 Jupiter orbits and 0.674 Saturn orbits, three of these periods come close to a whole number of revolutions. As successive great conjunctions occur nearly 120° apart, their appearances form a triangular pattern. In a series, every third conjunction returns after some 60 years to the vicinity of the first. These returns are observed to be shifted by some 8° relative to the fixed stars, so no more than four of them occur in the same zodiacal constellation. Usually the conjunctions occur in one of the following &quot;triplicities&quot; or &quot;trigons&quot; of zodiacal constellations:
#Aries, Sagittarius, and Leo
#Taurus, Capricorn, and Virgo
#Gemini, Aquarius, and Libra
#Cancer, Pisces, and Scorpius
After about 220 years the pattern shifts to the next trigon, and in about 800 or 900 years returns to the first trigon.

The three points of the triangle revolve in the same direction as the planets at the rate of approximately one-sixth of a revolution per four centuries, thus creating especially close conjunctions on an approximately four-century cycle. Currently the longitudes of close great conjunctions are about 307.4 and 127.4 degrees, in Capricornus and Cancer respectively. 

In astrology, one of the four elements was ascribed to each triangular pattern. Particular importance was accorded to the occurrence of a great conjunction in a new trigon, which is bound to happen after some 240 years at most. Even greater importance was attributed to the beginning of a new cycle after all fours trigons had been visited.
Medieval astrologers usually gave 960 years as the duration of the full cycle, perhaps because in some cases it took 240 years to pass from one trigon to the next. If a cycle is defined by when the conjunctions return to the same right ascension rather than to the same constellation, then because of axial precession the cycle is less than 800 years. Use of the Alphonsine tables apparently led to the use of precessing signs, and Kepler gave a value of 794 years (40 conjunctions).

Despite mathematical errors and some disagreement among astrologers about when trigons began, belief in the significance of such events generated a stream of publications that grew steadily until the end of the 16th century. As the great conjunction of 1583 was last in the water trigon it was widely supposed to herald apocalyptic changes; a papal bull against divination was issued in 1586 but as nothing significant happened by the feared event of 1603, public interest rapidly died. By the start of the next trigon, modern scientific consensus had condemned astrology as pseudoscience, and astronomers no longer perceived planetary alignments as omens. However, in the year 1962, when all five planets formed a cluster 17° wide, there was considerable concern.
Saturn&#x27;s orbit plane is inclined 2.485 degrees relative to Earth&#x27;s, and Jupiter&#x27;s is inclined 1.303 degrees. The ascending nodes of both planets are similar (100.6 degrees for Jupiter and 113.7 degrees for Saturn), meaning if Saturn is above or below Earth&#x27;s orbital plane Jupiter usually is too. Because these nodes align so well it would be expected that no closest approach will ever be much worse than the difference between the two inclinations. Indeed, between year 1 and 3000, the maximum conjunction distances were 1.3 degrees in 1306 and 1940. Conjunctions in both years occurred when the planets were tilted most out of the plane: longitude 206 degrees (therefore above the plane) in 1306, and longitude 39 degrees (therefore below the plane) in 1940.

== List of great conjunctions (1200 to 2400) ==

The following table details great conjunctions in between 1200 and 2400. The dates are given for the conjunctions in right ascension (the dates for conjunctions in ecliptic longitude can differ by several days). Dates before 1582 are in the Julian calendar while dates after 1582 are in the Gregorian calendar.

Longitude is measured counterclockwise from the location of the First Point of Aries (the location of the March equinox) at epoch J2000. This non-rotating coordinate system doesn&#x27;t move with the precession of Earth&#x27;s axes, thus being suited for calculations of the locations of stars. (In astrometry latitude and longitude are based on the ecliptic which is Earth&#x27;s orbit extended sunward and anti-sunward indefinitely.) The other common conjunction coordinate system is measured counterclockwise in right ascension from the First Point of Aries and is based on Earth&#x27;s equator and the meridian of the equinox point both extended upwards indefinitely; ecliptic separations are usually smaller.

Distance is the angular separation between the planets in sixtieths of a degree (minutes of arc) and elongation is the angular distance from the Sun in degrees. An elongation between around −20 and +20 degrees indicates that the Sun is close enough to the conjunction to make it difficult or impossible to see, sometimes more difficult at some geographic latitudes and less difficult elsewhere. Note that the exact moment of conjunction cannot be seen everywhere as it is below the horizon or it is daytime in some places, but a place on Earth affects minimum separation less than it would if an inner planet was involved. Negative elongations indicate the planet is west of the Sun (visible in the morning sky), whereas positive elongations indicate the planet is east of the Sun (visible in the evening sky).

The great conjunction series is roughly analogous to the Saros series for solar eclipses (which are Sun–Moon conjunctions). Conjunctions in a particular series occur about 119.16 years apart. The reason it is every six conjunctions instead of every three is that 119.16 years is closer to a whole number of years than = 59.58 is, so Earth will be closer to the same position in its orbit and conjunctions will appear more similar. All series will have progressions where conjunctions gradually shift from only visible before sunrise to visible throughout the night to only visible after sunset and finally back to the morning sky again. The location in the sky of each conjunction in a series should increase in longitude by 16.3 degrees on average, making one full cycle relative to the stars on average once every 2,634 years. If instead we use the convention of measuring longitude eastward from the First Point of Aries, we have to keep in mind that the equinox circulates once every c. 25,772 years, so longitudes measured that way increase slightly faster and those numbers become 17.95 degrees and 2,390 years.

A conjunction can be a member of a triple conjunction. In a triple conjunction, the series does not advance by one each event as the constellation and year is the same or close to it, this is the only time great conjunctions can be less than about 20 years apart.




== Notable great conjunctions ==

=== 7 BC ===

When studying the great conjunction of 1603, Johannes Kepler thought that the Star of Bethlehem might have been the occurrence of a great conjunction. He calculated that a triple conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn occurred in 7 BC (−6 using astronomical year numbering);

=== 1563 ===
The astronomers from the Cracow Academy (Jan Muscenius, Stanisław Jakobejusz, Nicolaus Schadeck, Petrus Probosczowicze, and others) observed the great conjunction of 1563 to compare Alfonsine tables (based on a geocentric model) with the Prutenic Tables (based on Copernican heliocentrism). In the Prutenic Tables the astronomers found Jupiter and Saturn so close to each other that Jupiter covered Saturn (actual angular separation was 6.8 minutes on 25 August 1563). The Alfonsine tables suggested that the conjunction should be observed on another day but on the day indicated by the Alfonsine tables the angular separation was a full 141 minutes. The Cracow professors suggested following the more accurate Copernican predictions and between 1578 and 1580 Copernican heliocentrism was lectured on three times by Valentin Fontani.

This conjunction was also observed by Tycho Brahe, who noticed that the Copernican and Ptolemaic tables used to predict the conjunction were inaccurate. This led him to realise that progress in astronomy required systematic, rigorous observation, night after night, using the most accurate instruments obtainable.

=== 2020 ===

The great conjunction of 2020 was the closest since 1623 and eighth closest of the first three millennia AD, with a minimum separation between the two planets of 6.1 arcminutes. This great conjunction was also the most easily visible close conjunction since 1226 (as the previous close conjunctions in 1563 and 1623 were closer to the Sun and therefore more difficult to see). It occurred seven weeks after the heliocentric conjunction, when Jupiter and Saturn shared the same heliocentric longitude.

The closest separation occurred on 21 December at 18:20 UTC, when Jupiter was 0.1° south of Saturn and 30° east of the Sun. This meant both planets appeared together in the field of view of most small- and medium-sized telescopes (though they were distinguishable from each other without optical aid). During the closest approach, both planets appeared to be a binary object to the naked eye. From mid-northern latitudes, the planets were visible one hour after sunset at less than 15° in altitude above the southwestern horizon in the constellation of Capricornus.

The conjunction attracted considerable media attention, with news sources calling it the &quot;Christmas Star&quot; due to the proximity of the date of the conjunction to Christmas, and for a great conjunction being one of the hypothesized explanations for the biblical Star of Bethlehem.

=== 7541 ===
As well as being a triple conjunction, the great conjunction of 7541 is expected to feature two occultations: one partial on 16 February, and one total on 17 June. Superimposition requires a separation of less than approximately 0.4 arcminutes. This will be the first occultation between the two planets since 6857 BC, and the only instance of two occultations within the same year in maybe a million years.

<doc id="866993" wikidata="Q2479662" url="?curid=866993" title="Legal psychology">
<text>Legal psychology is a field focused on the application of psychological principles within the legal system and its interactions with individuals. Professionals in this area are involved in understanding, assessing, evaluating potential jurors, investigating crimes and crime scenes, conducting forensic investigations The term &quot;legal psychology&quot; distinguishes this practical branch of psychology from the more theory-oriented field of clinical psychology. 

Together, legal psychology and forensic psychology form the field more generally recognized as &quot;psychology and law&quot;. Following earlier efforts by psychologists to address legal issues, psychology and law became a field of study in the 1960s, though that originating concern has lessened over time. The multidisciplinary American Psychological Association&#x27;s Division 41, the American Psychology–Law Society, is active with the goal of promoting the contributions of psychology to the understanding of law and legal systems through research; as well as providing education to psychologists in legal issues and providing education to legal personnel on psychological issues. Further, its mandate is to inform the psychological and legal communities, along with the general public, about current research, education, and services in the field of psychology and law. There are similar societies in Canada, Britain, and Europe. 

The Canadian Psychological Association is similarly a multi-disciplinary hub for psychologists and researchers to connect. Annual conferences are held across Canada to support new research and collaboration.  

== Training and education ==
Legal psychologists typically hold a PhD in some area of psychology (e.g., clinical psychology, social psychology, or cognitive psychology), and apply their knowledge of that field to the law. Although formal legal training (such as a JD or Master of Legal Studies degree) can be beneficial, most legal psychologists hold only the PhD. Based on the annual updates to the American Psychology and Law Society’s (APLS) official resources, there has been an increase in the number of universities which offer specialized training in legal psychology.  

== Legal vs. forensic psychology ==
For a time, all areas of law which applied psychological information were generally considered under the umbrella of legal psychology. Over time the field expanded so much that different areas of legal psychology had to be defined. Now, legal psychology is considered to refer to the application of research to law enforcement and the justice system to inform its officers of new research, to develop more evidence-based procedures, and to conduct quality assessments of offender programs.

Forensic psychology has developed into its own field which focuses on the offenders and victims of the crime in question. Traditionally, forensic psychology is based in clinical psychology and focuses on the assessment of mental illness, competency, and Not Criminally Responsible on Account of Mental Disorder (NCRMD)/insanity defense. It has been thought that in America psychologists have been used as expert witnesses in court testimonies since the early 1920s. However, it was expected that only a medical doctor would have the expertise to assess and diagnose an individual with incompetency to stand trial or accept a sentence. While the field has widened, this is still generally the case. 

Forensic psychological studies in the social psychological explanations for crime and offender motivations have led to the development of (evidence-based) offender profiling. The profiling of criminals, and its application, are not new concepts. Since the 1700s the studies of phrenology have attempted to track physical or behavioural actions to brain functioning and personality traits. This practice was very popular (despite its flaws and racist tendencies) and remains popular as shown by its presence in media, (i.e., tv shows like &quot;Criminal minds&quot;). The benefit of evidence-based practices helps ensure that bias and interpersonal connections do not influence whom law enforcement views as a threat to community safety.

Recent academic programs for legal psychology have combined the application of research to existing structures and moved away from only allowing clinical psychologists to speak as experts in forensic psychological matters as researchers have also become experts in their fields.

== Areas of research ==
Any research that combines psychological principles with legal applications or contexts could be considered legal psychology. 

Common areas of research in legal psychology include (but are not limited to), 

# Understanding Jury decision making
# Understanding Judges’ decision making
# Testing the validity of eyewitness statements and identifications
# Understanding the motivations and obstacles faced by offenders
# Understanding how an offender reacts psychologically to law enforcement and incarceration
# Testing the efficacy of treatment programs
# The use of testimonies made by children
## How influenced are children’s testimonies by external forces? (ie., coaching)

These areas of legal interest are supported by general psychological research into, 

# The decision-making skills of adults, individually or in groups 
# Human perceptions and memory under stress
# Recollection of memories over time
# Peer pressure, group dynamics, and community expectations
# Adult psychology
# Assessment of program quality and post-release behaviour
# Developmental psychology

The connection between the original psychology research and its use in the justice system is important to remember lest experts develop tunnel vision. For instance, to understand eyewitness memory, a psychologist should be concerned with memory processes as a whole, instead of only the aspects relevant to the law (e.g., lineups, accuracy of testimony). To understand false confessions, a psychologist should be familiar with research on decision making, compliance, obedience, persuasion, and other forms of social influence. 

For a time, legal psychology researchers were primarily focused on issues related to eyewitness testimony and jury decision-making—so much so that the editor of &quot;Law and Human Behavior&quot;, a leading legal psychology journal, implored researchers to expand the scope of their research and move on to other areas. 

=== Legal psychology journals and associations ===
There are several legal psychology journals, including &quot;Law and Human Behavior&quot;, &quot;Psychology, Public Policy and Law&quot;, &quot;Psychology, Crime, and Law&quot;, and &quot;Journal of Psychiatry, Psychology and Law&quot; that focus on general topics of criminology, and the criminal justice system. In addition, research by legal psychologists is regularly published in more general journals that cover both basic and applied research areas. The Online Jury Research Update (OJRU) regularly summarizes legal psychology research about legal persuasion, jury research and trial advocacy.

== Roles of a legal psychologist ==

=== Academics and research ===
Many legal psychologists work as professors in university psychology departments, criminal justice departments or law schools. Like other professors, legal psychologists generally conduct and publish empirical research, teach various classes, and mentor graduate and undergraduate students. Many legal psychologists also conduct research in a more general area of psychology (e.g., social, clinical, cognitive) with only a tangential legal focus. Those legal psychologists who work in law schools almost always hold a JD in addition to a PhD.

Academics and researchers make up a significant amount of the psychologists involved today with applying psychology to legal contexts. While many think of clinical psychology as the main form of psychology in the law, however the utility of psychology, including applications of social, developmental, and neurological psychology has given significant amount of evidence-based methods to support a fair, proper, and humane justice system.

The application of psychological knowledge and principles of evidence-based care are significant to maintaining fairness and integrity across the criminal justice system. 

=== Amicus briefs ===
One method that psychologists and researchers use to provide best practices to the justice system is through amicus briefs (defined by the Cambridge Dictionary as “a legal document supplied to a court of law containing advice or information relating to a case from a person or organization that is not directly involved in the case”. Psychologists can provide an amicus brief to the court. The amicus brief usually contains an opinion backed by scientific citations and statistics. The American Psychological Association has provided briefs concerning mental illness, intellectual or physical disability, and other factors. The rise in qualitative research methods has allowed these briefs to be more detailed with thorough explanations, compared to many of the older briefs which are based completely on statistics. 

=== Advisory roles ===
Legal psychologists may hold advisory roles in court systems. They may advise legal decision makers, particularly judges, on psychological findings pertaining to issues in a case. The psychologist who acts as a court adviser provides similar input to one acting as an expert witness, but acts out of the domain of an adversarial system.

=== Juror selection ===
Juror selection is an area in which legal psychology is often used. Lawyers might use evidence-based methods of questioning, or might hire psychologists to review the jurors themselves. Psychologists working as consultants work on all stages of a case from helping to organize testimony, preparing witnesses to testify, picking juries, and even arranging &quot;shadow jurors&quot; to watch the trial unfold and provide input on the trial.

=== Policy making and legislative guidance ===
Psychologists employed at public policy centers may attempt to influence legislative policy or may be called upon by state (or national) lawmakers to address some policy issue through empirical research. A psychologist working in public policy might suggest laws or help to evaluate a new legal practice (e.g., eyewitness lineups). 

=== Expert witnesses ===
Psychologists are often called to be expert witnesses in the courtroom. They lend their professional perspective on the case, the validity of specific evidence, or the psychological state of an accused. Psychologists first entered the courtroom as clinicians to assist the court in determining the mental fitness of an accused. The process to ascertain whether they are capable of understanding the situation they are in, the questions being asked, and the consequences of the trial. This information can only be assessed by a trained and experienced clinical psychologist and is necessary to determine if someone is ‘mentally fit’ to stand trial. This area, however, is typically covered under the area of clinical forensic psychology. 

However, outside of the clinical realm, psychologists specifically trained in legal issues, as well as those with no formal training, are often called by legal parties to testify as expert witnesses. In criminal trials, an expert witness may be called to testify about eyewitness memory, mistaken identity, competence to stand trial, the propensity of a death-qualified jury to also be &quot;pro-guilt&quot;, etc. Psychologists who focus on clinical issues often testify specifically about a defendant&#x27;s competence, intelligence, etc. More general testimony about perceptual issues (e.g., adequacy of police sirens) may also come up in trial.

Experts, particularly psychology experts, are often accused of being &quot;hired guns” who will testify to support their ‘side’. While it is possible that this happens, it is against the ethics code and standard of providing honest testimony. It can be problematic if both sides have psychological witnesses, jurors may have the daunting task of assessing difficult scientific information.

Clinicians and researchers in psychology also provide testimony to support or refute evidence based on their experience. There are a range of topics which psychology has relevant research to contribute. The validity of eyewitness testimony is a prime example as legal psychologists have played significant roles in the understanding of the validity and reliability of eyewitness testimony as an investigative tool. Legal psychologists have also aided significantly in the creation of new knowledge and tools to combat the weaknesses of eyewitness recollection.

== Example of legal psychology in action ==
One of the earliest experiments on eyewitness reliability was conducted in March 1893 J. McKeen Cattell posted questions to fifty-six of his students at Columbia University. The questions he asked his students were comparable to those asked in a court of justice. What he found was that it was reasonable to conclude eyewitness accounts of events were unreliable. His students were all sure they were mostly correct, even when they were not, and some were hesitant when they were in fact correct. He could not figure out specifically why each student had inaccurate testimonies. 

Research into eyewitness testimony became more popular nearly a century later in the 1980s and 1990s. As some research emerged about the potential unreliability of eyewitness memory concerns rose given the prevalent use of eyewitnesses for key evidence. Many details of crimes are obtained by interviewing witnesses, some of whom might testify in court, providing their account of the event into official evidence. Eyewitness testimony and identification of an accused is often a salient piece of evidence which unduly influences the opinions of the jury. As a result, incorrect or false eyewitness testimony has been found to be one of the most significant influences in the decision-making process among jurors. The combination of unreliable eyewitness recall and high regard of eyewitness testimony has led to the unjust convictions of many innocent people.

As a result of these findings, legal psychology researchers committed to creating and sharing evidence-based methods to promote best practices and lower the risk of a false eyewitness statement. In ., published an article of guidelines on the best methods collecting and using eyewitness testimony while protecting the integrity of the criminal justice system. In ., provided a much-needed update to these guidelines. This was done under the recommendation of the American Psychology-Law Society (Division 41). In the 20 years since its first publishing there has been significant research on this topic of eyewitness identification procedures. 

The results yielded nine recommendations for planning, designing, and conducting eyewitness identification procedures. While four of the recommendations from the 1998 article were confirmed to be still be valid, there were an additional five recommendations added. Ultimately Wells et al., (2020), determined that &quot;“the reliability and integrity of eyewitness identification evidence is highly dependent on the procedures used by law enforcement for collecting and preserving the eyewitness evidence&quot;” (pg 1). 

These findings reinforce the need for research to be ongoing, critical, and applied to all sectors of the criminal justice system. As more research in an area is published the strength and utility of procedures and outcomes is able to be re-evaluated to allow for continual improvements to the criminal justice system.
