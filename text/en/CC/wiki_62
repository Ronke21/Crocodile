<doc id="862088" wikidata="Q777280" url="?curid=862088" title="Aurora (1957 automobile)">
<text>The Aurora was an American automobile prototype manufactured by Father Alfred A. Juliano, a Catholic priest, from 1957 to 1958. The Aurora is arguably the first Experimental Safety Vehicle ever made, even before the coinage of the ESV initialism. This safety car was to be available with a Chrysler, Cadillac, or Lincoln engine, built on a Buick chassis. However, the Aurora Motor Company of Branford, Connecticut, partially funded by Juliano&#x27;s congregation, went out of business after producing just one $30,000 prototype.

Juliano had studied art before entering the priesthood, and expressed a lifelong interest in automotive design. His family said that he had won a coveted scholarship from General Motors to study with Harley Earl, which arrived only after he had already been ordained. He maintained his interest in automotive design, however, which he combined with a belief that there was much which could be done to make current automobiles safer.

Conceived, invented and built by Juliano, the Aurora was an long fibreglass-bodied car that was two years on the drawing board and required three years to build. The high quality of the workmanship was &quot;astounding&quot;, particularly in the fibreglass body and the plastic windows. At a retail price of $12,000.00, it would have been priced just under the most costly car in the U.S., the $13,000.00 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham. The body, said to be dent, rust, and corrosion proof, was specifically designed for long distance highway travel. The vehicle had a tinted, transparent, plastic &quot;astrodome&quot; roof with adjustable interior metal shades. Dashboard controlled hydraulic jacks mounted in the frame assisted in tire changing. The spare tire, located under the front end, was mounted on a platform which would lower the tire to the ground without manual contact.

The vehicle had many car safety-related features, novel at the time, some now routine. These features included seatbelts, a roll cage, a padded instrument panel, side-impact bars, and a collapsible steering column. The placement of the spare tire under the front end served to absorb impacts. The most innovative safety feature, which has not been incorporated into other cars, was the ability to swivel the seats to face rearwards should a collision seem imminent.

The Aurora is mainly remembered for its appearance, however, and is often cited in lists of the ugliest cars ever, frequently as the single ugliest car. This assessment is largely due to two factors, in addition to the general overwrought &quot;swoopiness&quot; of the car typical of the &quot;futuristic&quot; styling of the time: the gaping front end and the bulbous windshield, both dictated by safety considerations. The bulging windshield was designed to eliminate impact with occupants&#x27; heads, in the era prior to air bags, while the scoop-like front end served as a large, foam filled bumper, designed to scoop up not only air, but also pedestrians without injury.

The prototype had a fiberglass body over a largely wooden structure built on the salvaged chassis of a 1953 Buick, which was not adequately tested before the scheduled public unveiling in 1957 and broke down 15 times on the way to the press conference, requiring towing to 7 different garages; mainly due to clogging of the fuel system, which had sat unused for the previous four years. After the inauspicious beginning of arriving hours late for its own unveiling, the car did not inspire the public due to its appearance, lack of performance, and high price, and there were no advance orders.

The company&#x27;s finances were called into question; Juliano stated that that had been instigated by General Motors, and compared himself to Preston Tucker. He was investigated by the IRS, accused by the Catholic Church of misappropriating parishioners&#x27; donations, and forced to leave the Order of the Holy Ghost. But in fact, he himself had gone deeply into personal debt financing the company, and eventually declared bankruptcy, forfeiting the prototype to a repair shop as collateral for unpaid repair bills. It passed through several hands before finally being abandoned behind a Cheshire auto body shop in 1967. Juliano died of a brain hemorrhage in 1989.

In 1993, the car was discovered by British car enthusiast Andy Saunders of Poole, Dorset, in a sketch in a book about dream cars; &quot;It was so ugly it was unreal. I said straightaway, &#x27;I&#x27;ve got to own that.&#x27;&quot; After several years of searching, he eventually tracked the car down by the name of the garage in the background of a photograph of the car, purchased it sight unseen for $1,500, and had it shipped to Britain for another $2,000. The fiberglass and wood structure of the car proved to have deteriorated terribly from exposure, as well as the interior and plastic windshield. Restoration was further complicated by a lack of adequate documentation or even photographs of the car, the absence of the late Father Juliano to assist as a consultant, and the lack of replacement parts for a prototype vehicle. However, restoration was completed in early 2005, and the car was exhibited at the Goodwood Festival of Speed. It was recently acquired by the Lane Motor Museum in Nashville, TN and is now on display.

<doc id="862089" wikidata="Q60588" url="?curid=862089" title="Liberal Party (Japan, 1998)">
<text>The was a political party in Japan formed in 1998 by Ichirō Ozawa and Hirohisa Fujii. It is now defunct, having joined the Democratic Party of Japan in 2003.

The Liberal Party were part of the Japanese liberal parties genealogy, neoliberal and neoconservative.

==History==
The Liberal Party was formed from remnants of the New Frontier Party after it dissolved in 1998. The party did do quite well for a new party, joining the opposition led by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and also including the New Kōmeitō, the Social Democratic Party and Japanese Communist Party, and thus helped contest elections against the ruling conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).

In January 1999, it formed a coalition with the ruling LDP under Keizō Obuchi. Takeshi Noda as Minister for Home Affairs became its only member in the realigned Obuchi cabinet, later replaced by Toshihiro Nikai as Minister of Transportation. Later that year, the New Kōmeitō joined the coalition as well, and party president Ichirō Ozawa decided to lead the Liberal Party back into the opposition as he saw his party&#x27;s position endangered. However, some members of the coalition wanted to stay in the government and eventually formed the breakaway New Conservative Party.

In October 2003, because of the upcoming election, the Liberal Party finally merged with the DPJ and all its members joined the new party, making an influential grouping within the party. The DPJ did tremendously well, and Hirohisa Fujii became the Secretary General of the Democratic Party of Japan, while Ichiro Ozawa led the Liberal Party faction within the DPJ. In 2016, the name was revived by Ozawa, on his renaming of the People&#x27;s Life Party to the Liberal Party.

<text>Radical Democratic Party (RDP), was a political party in India which existed at the time of the Second World War. Also known as the Radical Communist Party. RDP evolved out of the League of Radical Congressmen, which had been founded in 1939 by former Communist International leader M.N. Roy. Roy founded Radical Democratic Party in 1940 with the purpose of engaging India in the war to support the Allies. RDP also worked for Indian independence. RDP was against the industrial strike that took place at the time.

During the period 1944–1948 the general secretary of RDP was V. M. Tarkunde.

The trade union wing of the Royists was the Indian Federation of Labour.

RDP was dissolved in 1948, to give place to the Radical Humanist movement.

<text>David Alan Stevenson (21 July 1854 in Edinburgh – 11 April 1938) was a lighthouse engineer who built 26 lighthouses in and around Scotland.

==Life==
He was born on 21 July 1854 the son of David Stevenson and his wife, Elizabeth Mackay. His early years were spent at their home at 8 Forth Street in the eastern section of the New Town in Edinburgh. The family later moved to 45 Melville Street.

He was part of the famous Stevenson family of lighthouse engineers, including brother Charles Stevenson, uncle Thomas Stevenson, and grandfather Robert Stevenson. His cousin was the author Robert Louis Stevenson.

Stevenson was educated at Edinburgh Academy (1865–70) and then studied Engineering at the University of Edinburgh, graduating BSc in 1875.

In 1884 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were William Swan, Peter Guthrie Tait, Robert MacKay Smith and George Chrystal.).

Stevenson died at his home, &quot;Troqueer&quot;, in the Kingsknowe area of Edinburgh on 11 April 1938. He is buried in Dean Cemetery. The grave lies on the north wall of the original cemetery, backing onto the first northern extension. It is heavily worn.

==Family==

In 1882 he married Annie Roberts (1862–1945). The family resided in Edinburgh&#x27;s West End at 45 Melville Street.

Their daughter Dorothy Emily was born in 1892; she became a best-selling author of more than 40 books published under the name D. E. Stevenson. A commemorative plaque marks the house.

His nephew was also named David Alan Stevenson (1891-1971).

==Works==

Between 1885 and 1886 he built three lighthouses with his uncle Thomas, and over the following 50 years, built a further 23 with his brother Charles.

From 1904 he was assisted by John Davidson Gardner who became his Chief assistant in 1911.

He retired aged 83 in March 1938.

<text>The Bristol Type 171 Sycamore is an early helicopter developed and built by the helicopter division of the Bristol Aeroplane Company. The name refers to the seeds of the sycamore tree, &quot;Acer pseudoplatanus&quot;, which fall with a rotating motion. It has the distinction of being the first British helicopter to receive a certificate of airworthiness, as well as being the first British-designed helicopter to be introduced by and to serve with the Royal Air Force (RAF).

Typically capable of seating up to three passengers, the type was often used as a transport for both passengers and cargo alike. In RAF service, the Sycamore was normally used in the search and rescue and casualty evacuation roles. The type proved the value of rotorcraft to easily traverse inhospitable or otherwise inaccessible terrain; the Sycamore made valuable contributions to British military activities during the Malayan Emergency, the Cyprus Emergency, and the Aden Emergency, in addition to other operations.

In addition to its British military service, various models of the Sycamore were produced and operated by a number of users, including overseas military operations and civil customers. Civilian operations typically involved transportation, mountain rescue, and aerial survey work. In 1959, production of the Sycamore ended after 180 rotorcraft had been completed.

==Development==
During the Second World War, new methods of aircraft propulsion were devised and experimented with; in particular, breakthroughs in rotary aircraft, such as gyrocopters and helicopters, were making such aircraft more practical. In 1944, Bristol established a specialised helicopter division shortly after the Allied invasion of Europe, when engineers from the Airborne Forces Experimental Establishment (AFEE) at Beaulieu became available. The AFEE had been conducting its own work on the development of rotorcraft designs under the noted helicopter pioneer Raoul Hafner; however, the successful use of Airspeed Horsa and General Aircraft Hamilcar gliders during Operation Overlord had led to helicopter development being recognised as a priority. Hafner, whose company had been acquired by Bristol was promptly appointed by the company as the head of Bristol&#x27;s new helicopter division.

In June 1944, work commenced on the development on a four-seat helicopter intended for both civil and military use; it was out of this programme that the Sycamore would emerge. During development, particular emphasis was assigned to the producing the necessary level of endurance of the rotorcraft&#x27;s mechanical components. On 25 July 1947, the first prototype, VL958, which was powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp Junior (there being no suitable engine in the Bristol range), performed the type&#x27;s maiden flight. In mid-1948, the third prototype, which had been built to the improved Sycamore Mk.2 standard, was completed; this model had been fitted with a Alvis Leonides engine, the Leonides engine would become the standard powerplant for all subsequent Sycamore production. On 25 April 1949, a certificate of airworthiness was granted for the Sycamore, the first such to be granted to a British helicopter.

During the flight test programme, Bristol&#x27;s key development pilots for the Type 171 included Charles &quot;Sox&quot; Hosegood and Col. Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Smith. In 1951, a Bristol-owned Sycamore Mk.2 was used during a series of deck landing trials performed on board the Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Triumph&quot;. An improved model of the helicopter, designated as the Sycamore Mk.3, was rapidly developed; it featured an increased capacity for five occupants, a wider fuselage and a shortened nose. A total of 23 Sycamore Mk.3s were produced, 15 of these were principally used for joint evaluation purposes by the Royal Air Force (RAF), Army Air Corps (AAC), and British European Airways (BEA).

Versions of the Sycamore up to and including the Mk.3A retained the standard two-seat cockpit layout, placing the pilot in the left-hand seat and the co-pilot in the right. However, on the main production model, designated Sycamore Mk.4, this seating arrangement was switched to the American practice of positioning the pilot&#x27;s seat on the right. There were also a number of other developments that had featured upon the earlier versions, such as a four-door design, which had been standardised upon the Sycamore Mk.4. This version entered RAF service, receiving the military designation of HR.14.

Civil versions were not marketed under the Sycamore name, they were instead known simply as the Bristol Type 171. By May 1958, over 150 Sycamores had been manufactured and four units per month were being built.

==Design==

The Bristol Sycamore was one of the first production helicopters to be developed. Each Sycamore was manufactured with all of the necessary fixed fittings to enable it to be quickly adapted for any of six major roles: search and rescue, air ambulance, passenger transport, freight transport, aerial crane and dual instruction; it was also used for other specialised roles. The Sycamore seated four-to-five occupants, depending on the model; it was usually fitted with three folding canvas seats as well as a single rotating seat besides the pilot. In addition to the passenger cabin, it had a separate luggage compartment.

A specialised air ambulance model of the Sycamore was developed during the early 1950s. In this configuration, up to two patients were carried inside the cabin on stretchers stacked one above the other; this was different to the usual arrangement of the era of using externally-mounted &quot;pods&quot; for carrying patients. To provide the extra width necessary in the cabin, detachable Perspex blisters were fitted on each side of the cabin. The stretcher racks could be folded into the sides of the cabin, providing room for up to three sitting casualties instead; an electrical supply outlet was available for connecting electric blankets. Next to the pilot was a swivelling seat for a medical attendant.

The blades of the three-bladed main rotor were attached to the rotor head with lightweight interleaving steel plates while tie-rods carried the centrifugal tension loads. The blade levers were connected using ball joints to the arms of a control spider, the cone of which was actuated up and down by the collective pitch lever which changed the pitch of all the blades; an irreversible mechanism was used to prevent blade loads being transferred back to the control stick. The blades were supported when stationary or turning slowly by droop stops, which maintained a minimum clearance between the blade tips and the tailboom even in high winds; these stops were withdrawn above 100 rpm so that full freedom of movement for effective flight was possible.

The Sycamore was powered by a single Alvis Leonides piston engine of . The engine was mounted below and to the rear of the main rotor on a flexible mounting to reduce vibrations transmitted to the helicopter structure. It was isolated in a fireproof enclosure which was fitted with fire detection and extinguishing equipment to meet certification requirements. Air was drawn through a forward-facing grill to cool the gearbox before passing through the engine cowling and leaving the fuselage. The engine power was controlled by the collective pitch lever. In order to maintain the rotor speed at its required setting fuel to the engine had to be automatically varied as the rotor pitch setting commanded by the pilot changed the load on the engine; fine adjustment of engine power was achieved by twisting the pitch lever. The Sycamore had a relatively high rotor speed for the era, which was claimed to give a smoother ride and be safer in the event of engine failure.

==Operational history==

From 1952 to 1955 the Sycamore was used for various trials by the Air-Sea Warfare Development Unit RAF which was stationed at RAF St. Mawgan.
In April 1953, the &quot;Sycamore HR14&quot; entered service with No. 275 Squadron of the RAF and went on to serve with nine squadrons in total. Various marks of Sycamore served with the RAF; they would primarily be used as air ambulances ( Sycamore HC.10 ), for Army communications ( Sycamore HC.11 ) and for search and rescue operations (Sycamore HR.12 to Sycamore HR.14). In 1953, No. 275 Squadron, equipped with Sycamores, became the RAF&#x27;s first helicopter search and rescue squadron in Great Britain. The type was used by the RAF Central Flying School for pilot training purposes. In June 1953, a Sycamore towing a large RAF Ensign led a flypast by 640 British and Commonwealth aircraft at the Coronation Review of the RAF.

The Sycamore was heavily used during the Malayan Emergency (1948–1960), typically deploying Army foot patrols into the jungle. Numerous Sycamores were transferred to the Far East Air Force to participate in the conflict; however, the type was involved in a number of crashes in the region which had occurred as a result of tail or main rotor blade problems. In response, a series of blade trials were conducted prior to a modified blade design being adopted and Sycamore operations in the theatre being resumed. Following the end of most combat operations in August 1960, Sycamores remained in the region, including a detachment in Brunei, to support British forces stationed there to deter further aggression by Malayan communist guerrillas.

The type also saw combat service with the RAF during the Cyprus Emergency and the Aden Emergency, in addition to other operations. In December 1971, the last of the RAF&#x27;s Sycamores were officially retired; this had been due to critical parts having reached the end of their fatigue life. However 32 Squadron continued to operate two Sycamores until August 1972.

Fifty Sycamores were delivered to the German Federal Government. Three helicopters were produced for the Belgian Government for use in the Belgian Congo; it had been picked due to the type&#x27;s good capabilities in tropical environments, as proven during its combat use in Malaysia. The Sycamore was the second helicopter type to be used by the Australian Defence Force; ten were delivered to the Royal Australian Navy.

The Sycamore was also used in a variety of civilian roles. A single example was used during the construction of the M1 motorway between London and Leeds; the type provided support in various roles, including to perform aerial surveying, communication across various sites, the carriage of both personnel and equipment, and the mitigation of flooding on the project. Sycamores operated by Australian National Airways were routinely available for charter, performing tasks such as the aerial surveying of mining claims, supply missions, and the transporting of equipment across the remote Outback areas of the nation.

<text>Charles Alexander Stevenson MICE MIEE FRSE (23 December 1855, – 9 May 1950) was a Scottish lighthouse engineer who built twenty-three lighthouses in and around Scotland.

==Life==
He was born at 8 Forth Street in the east part of Edinburgh&#x27;s New Town The family moved to 20 Royal Terrace on Calton Hill shortly after his birth.

Born into the famous Stevenson family of lighthouse engineers, son of David Stevenson and his wife Elizabeth Mackay, brother of David Alan Stevenson, and nephew of Thomas Stevenson, he was educated at Edinburgh Academy 1866 to 1872 then studied mathematics and engineering at the University of Edinburgh where he graduated BSc. He joined the family business of lighthouse design in 1875 remaining unpaid as a family member until 1887 when his uncle, Thomas Stevenson died, after which he became a partner. Between 1887 and 1937 he built 23 lighthouses with his brother, David, and is noted for his experiments with optics. He also improved foghorns and created his own wireless communication system prior to Marconi&#x27;s wireless.

In 1886, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir John Murray, Peter Guthrie Tait, George Chrystal and Alexander Buchan. In 1889 he published an account of recent earthquakes in Scotland, with tabulations and a map, based largely on the accounts of lighthouse keepers.

In March 1895, he was appointed examiner of Engineering students at St Andrews University. 

He lived at 9 Manor Place in Edinburgh with Ernest Maddox as his neighbour at 7 Manor Place.

He died on 9 May 1950. He is buried in the first northern extension to Dean Cemetery in western Edinburgh. The grave lies on the north path towards the north-east corner. His son David Alan Stevenson lies alongside.

==Family==

He married Margaret Sherriff (1863–1945). With her he had two daughters and a son, David Alan (1891–1971), who was the last of the family to enter the profession of lighthouse design.

His cousin was Robert Louis Stevenson, and grandfather was the lighthouse engineer, Robert Stevenson.

<doc id="862111" wikidata="Q1999103" url="?curid=862111" title="Monohull">
<text>A monohull is a type of boat having only one hull, unlike multihulled boats which can have two or more individual hulls connected to one another.

==Fundamental concept==
Among the earliest hulls were simple logs, but these were generally unstable and tended to roll over easily. Hollowing out the logs into a dugout canoe doesn&#x27;t help much unless the hollow section penetrates below the log&#x27;s center of buoyancy, then a load carried low in the cavity actually stabilizes the craft. Adding weight or ballast to the bottom of the hull or as low as possible within the hull adds stability.

Naval architects place the center of gravity substantially below the center of buoyancy; in most cases this can only be achieved by adding weight or ballast. The use of stones and other weights as ballast can be traced back to the Romans, Phoenicians and Vikings. Modern ships carry tons of ballast in order to maintain their stability; even heavily laden cargo ships use ballast to optimize the distribution of weight.

==Uses==
This is the most prevalent form of waterborne vessel.

==Variations==
*Keels - Most sailing ships and larger sailboats have deep keels containing ballast which adds horizontal stabilility.
*Displacement hulls - Monohull boats frequently ride deeply in the water, this is known as a displacement hull.
*Planing hulls - Hulls that ride on top of the water are called planing hulls, because when they reach speed, the hulls are substantially lifted above the water; this is known as planing (to plane).

<text>The Australian Six was an Australian automobile manufactured from 1919 to 1925. It was a grandiose attempt to compete against imported cars from the United States, and was produced from a mixture of local and imported parts. Vehicles featured a conventional chassis layout and a choice of five bodies, locally made under the motto &#x27;Made in Australia, by Australians, for Australia&#x27;. Most models were fitted with Rutenber Straight-6 engines and Grant Lees or Muncie gearboxes; some, however, had imported OHV Ansted engines instead. Before 1919 the factory was at the Sydney Harbour side suburb of Rushcutters Bay, New South Wales, it then moved to Ashfield until 1924. The company was forced to shut down production after some 500 cars were built; this was due mainly to high local construction costs. The final few cars were made by the Harkness and Hillier hire car company in Sydney. Only four Australian Sixes are thought to survive, one in the Powerhouse Museum automobile collection in Sydney, one in the York Motor Museum, York, Western Australia, this is one of the first six built without a chassis number in the first factory, one in the National Museum in Canberra and one in Birdwood Museum, South Australia.

The term Australian Six (or &quot;Big Aussie six&quot; etc.) is sometimes used to refer to Australian-built large family cars such as the Ford Falcon, Holden Commodore/Toyota Lexcen, Toyota Avalon/Aurion, the Mitsubishi Magna/380, the Chrysler Valiant &amp; the Leyland P76, which often have six-cylinder engines as standard.

In 1984 the car was honoured on a postage stamp, part of a series of five depicting early Australian automobiles, issued by Australia Post .

<text>Fawcett Gowler Taylor, (April 29, 1878 – January 1, 1940,) was a Manitoba politician, and was the leader of that province&#x27;s Conservative Party from 1922 to 1933.

Taylor was born in Meadow Lea, Manitoba, the son of William Taylor and Marietta Jane Plummer, and was educated in Winnipeg. He was called to the Manitoba bar in 1900 and worked as a barrister. He served as mayor of Portage la Prairie from 1912 to 1915. Taylor married Mabel Agnes Dykeman in 1901. He was named King&#x27;s Counsel in 1913. In the provincial election of 1915, he ran as a Conservative candidate in the Portage la Prairie constituency and was defeated.

Taylor resigned as mayor later in 1915 to enlist for service in the First World War. Already a captain in the 99th Manitoba Rangers, he was quickly promoted to Major and served in France with the 1st Canadian Mounted Rifles from 1916 to 1918. On returning, he became President of the Army and Navy Veterans in Canada (Dominion Association).

Taylor sought the leadership of provincial Conservatives in 1919, but was defeated by Richard G. Willis. He was elected for Portage la Prairie in the provincial election of 1920, and was chosen as party leader in a second attempt on April 5, 1922, defeating John Thomas Haig.

The Manitoba Conservatives had governed the province from 1900 to 1915, but were in a weak position when Taylor became the party&#x27;s leader. The scandals of the Roblin government had led to a catastrophic defeat in 1915, with the Conservatives winning only won five of 47 seats. They increased their total to seven in 1920, but were in danger of becoming marginalized by the rise of the United Farmers of Manitoba and Labour.

Taylor&#x27;s first campaign as party leader was not particularly successful. The UFM swept the countryside in the 1922 campaign, with Labour and the Liberals dominating Winnipeg. Taylor faced a strong challenge from Liberal cabinet minister Charles Duncan McPherson in Portage la Prairie, winning by only 131 votes out of 2743 cast.

Subsequently, Taylor brought the party back to a more viable position. By now a lieutenant colonel, Taylor brought the Conservatives back to 15 seats and official opposition status in the election of 1927. Leading up to the 1932 election, his party was regarded as having a real chance to form government.

This did not occur, however. The federal Liberals were concerned about a Conservative victory in the province, and convinced their provincial affiliate to form an alliance with the governing Progressives (as the UFM government had renamed itself). The combined resources of these parties weakened the Conservative position. Taylor was also damaged by the unpopularity of Conservative Prime Minister Richard Bennett. Taylor&#x27;s own plan to redistribute land to the poor was criticized by many as ineffective.

The Conservatives won only 10 seats in the 1932 election. Taylor resigned the party leadership in April 1933, after being appointed a judge in the Manitoba Court of King&#x27;s Bench. He was succeeded in the Portage la Prairie riding by Toby Sexsmith.

He died at home in Winnipeg and was buried in Portage la Prairie.

<text>The Third [[Council of Toledo]] (589) marks the entry of Visigothic Spain into the Catholic Church, and is known for codifying the filioque clause into Western Christianity. The council also enacted restrictions on Jews, and the conversion of the country to Catholic Christianity led to repeated conflict with the Jews.

==Arian Goths==
In the 4th century, the bishop Wulfila (&quot;c&quot; 310 – 383) invented a script for the Gothic language, translated the Bible into Gothic, and converted the Goths to Arian Christianity. When the Visigoths traveled west, they encountered Latin Christians, for whom Arianism was anathema. The Visigoths held to their Arian beliefs and refused to join the Catholic Church.

==Attempts to unify==
Prior to the Council in Toledo, King Reccared had convened informal assemblies of bishops to resolve the religious schism in his kingdom. At the second assembly both Arian and Catholic bishops presented their arguments, while Reccared pointed out that no Arian bishop had ever performed a healing miracle. The last assembly consisted of only Catholic bishops, where upon Reccared accepted the Catholic faith.

==Bishop Leander and King Reccared==
The Council was organized by Bishop Leander of Seville, who had worked tirelessly to convert the Arian Visigothic kings and had succeeded with Reccared. Abbot Eutropius had the chief day-to-day management of the council, according to the chronicler John of Biclaro. In the king&#x27;s name, Leander brought together bishops and nobles in May of 589. However, King Reccared and Bishop Leander were only able to persuade eight Arian bishops to attend the council.

==Council proceedings==
===Opening===
The Council opened on May 4, with three days of prayer and fasting. Then, the public confession of King Reccared was read aloud by a notary. Its theological precision defining Trinitarian and Arian tenets, establishing Reccared&#x27;s newly achieved orthodoxy, and its extensive quotation from scripture revealed that it was in fact ghostwritten for the king, doubtless by Leander.

===Declarations===
In it, Reccared declared that God had inspired him to lead the Goths back to the true faith, from which they had been led astray by false teachers. (In fact they had been Christianized by the Arian Ulfilas, but Leander&#x27;s theme was reconciliation.) He declared that not only the Goths but the Suebi, who by the fault of others had been led into heresy, had been brought back to the faith. These nations he dedicated to God by the hands of the bishops, whom he called on to complete the work. He then anathematized Arius and his doctrine, and declared his acceptance of the councils of Nicaea, Constantinople, Ephesus, Chalcedon and pronounced an anathema on all who returned to Arianism after being received into the Church by the chrism, or the laying on of hands; then followed the creeds of Nicaea and Constantinople and the definition of Chalcedon, and the tome concluded with the signatures of Reccared and Baddo his queen. This confession was received with a general acclamation.

One of the Catholic bishops then called on the assembled bishops, clergy, and Gothic nobles to declare publicly their renunciation of Arianism and their acceptance of Chalcedonian Christianity. They replied that although they had done so already when they had gone over with the king to the Church, they would comply.

===Anathemas===
Then followed 23 anathemas directed against Arius and his doctrines, succeeded by the creeds of Nicaea and Constantinople and the definition of Chalcedon, the whole being subscribed by 8 Arian bishops with their clergy, and by all the Gothic nobles. The bishops were Ugnas of Barcelona, Ubiligisclus of Valencia, Murila of Palencia, Sunnila of Viseu, Gardingus of Tuy, Bechila of Lugo, Argiovitus of Oporto, and Froisclus of Tortosa. The names of the eight are Germanic in origin. Four come from sees within the former kingdom of the Suebi, probably showing that Leovigild, after his conquest, had displaced the Catholic bishops by Arians.

===Canons===
Reccared then instructed the council with his licence to draw up any requisite canons, particularly one directing the creed to be recited at Communion, so that henceforward no one could plead ignorance as an excuse for misbelief. Then followed 23 canons with a confirmatory edict of the king. 
*The 1st confirmed the decrees of previous councils of the Catholic Church and synodical letters of the popes;
*the 2nd directed the recitation of the creed of Constantinople at Holy Communion, with the addition of the Filioque clause: &quot;Credo in Spiritum Sanctum qui ex patre filioque procedit&quot; (&quot;I believe in the Holy Spirit who proceeds from the Father and Son&quot;) which was never accepted in the Christian East and led to drawn-out controversy;
*the 5th forbade the converted Arian bishops, priests, and deacons to live with their wives;
*the 7th directed that the Scriptures should be read at a bishop&#x27;s table during meals;
*the 9th transferred Arian churches to the bishops of their dioceses;
*the 13th forbade clerics to proceed against other clerics before lay tribunals;
*the 14th forbade Jews to have Christian wives, concubines, or slaves, ordered the children of such unions to be baptized, and disqualified Jews from any office in which they might have to punish Christians. Christian slaves whom they had circumcised, or made to share in their rites, were &quot;ipso facto&quot; freed;
*the 21st forbade civil authorities to lay burdens on clerics or the slaves of the church or clergy;
*the 22nd forbade wailing at funerals;
*the 23rd forbade celebrating the eves of Saint&#x27;s days with dances and songs, characterized as &quot;indecent&quot;.

The canons were subscribed first by the king, then by 5 of the 6 metropolitans, of whom Masona signed first; 62 bishops signed in person, 6 by proxy. All those of Tarraconensis and Septimania appeared personally or by proxy; in other provinces several were missing.

===Closing===
The proceedings closed with a triumphant homily by Leander on the conversion of the Goths, preserved by his brother Isidore as &quot;Homilia de triumpho ecclesiae ob conversionem Gothorum&quot; a homily upon the &quot;triumph of the Church and the conversion of the Goths.&quot;

==Effects of the council==
The proscriptions against Jews were soon followed by required conversions, which led to a wholesale flight of Jews from Visigothic Spain to Ceuta and technically Visigothic nearby territories in North Africa. There, a community of exiles and malcontents formed, that were later to provide useful alliance and information at the time of the Moorish invasion in 711.

The filioque clause spread through the Latin-literate West but not through the Greek-speaking East. The Franks adopted it, but its use caused controversy in the 9th century. Its use spread to Rome soon after 1000, and it contributed to the Great Schism (1054) between the Eastern Orthodox and Catholics.

<text>The Australis was an Australian automobile manufactured in Leichhardt, New South Wales, from 1896 to 1906 by G.W. &amp; G. Wood. The company began production with a motor driven bicycle in 1895. Only three Australis vehicles were produced: a second motor driven bicycle in 1896, a single-cylinder 3hp two-seat light buggy in 1900 and a 7hp (5 kW) twin-cylinder light buggy in 1906. The original engine from the 1900 Australis buggy is now part of the Powerhouse Museum collection and is thought to be the oldest surviving Australian built engine.

<doc id="862125" wikidata="Q3945070" url="?curid=862125" title="Instrument landing system localizer">
<text>An instrument landing system localizer, or simply localizer (LOC, or LLZ prior to 2007), is a system of horizontal guidance in the instrument landing system, which is used to guide aircraft along the axis of the runway.

== Principle of operation==
In aviation, a localizer is the lateral component of the &quot;instrument landing system&quot; (ILS) for the runway centerline when combined with the vertical glide path, not to be confused with a locator, although both are parts of aviation navigation systems.

A localizer (like a glide path) requires both a transmitting airport runway system and receiving cockpit instruments. An older aircraft without an ILS receiver cannot take advantage of any ILS facilities at any runway, and much more importantly, the most modern aircraft have no use of their ILS instruments at runways which lack ILS facilities. In parts of Africa and Asia large airports may lack any kind of transmitting ILS system. Some runways have ILS only in one direction; this can still be used for horizontal centering when landing the opposite direction (with lower precision) and is known as the &quot;back beam&quot; or &quot;back course&quot;.

Two signals are transmitted on one of 40 ILS channels. One is amplitude modulated at 90 Hz, the other at 150 Hz. These are transmitted from co-located phased array antenna elements. Each antenna transmits a narrow beam. In addition, a &quot;clearing&quot; signal is transmitted at one tenth of the power with a wider beam to prevent receivers from picking up the side lobes of the main beam.

The signals&#x27; phases at the antenna elements are arranged such that the 150 Hz signal is more prominent (has a greater depth of modulation) at a receiver located to the right of centerline, and the 90 Hz signal is more prominent to the left. The cockpit instrument uses the difference between the modulation strengths of the two received signals to indicate left or right deviation from centerline.

== Carrier frequency pairings ==
Localizer (LOC) and glide path (G/P) (a.k.a. glide slope [G/S]) carrier frequencies are paired so that the navigation radio automatically tunes the G/S frequency which corresponds to the selected LOC frequency. The LOC signal is in the 110 MHz range while the G/S signal is in the 330 MHz range.

LOC carrier frequencies range between 108.10 MHz and 111.95 MHz (with the 100 kHz first decimal digit always odd, so 108.10, 108.15, 108.30, etc., are LOC frequencies and are not used for any other purpose).

==Localizer in cockpit==

The localizer indicator is (on most aircraft manufactured from the late 1950s) shown &quot;below&quot; the Attitude Indicator, but is still a part of this instrument together with the glide path indicator and the cross in the center of the instrument which is called flight director.

The glide path scale is located to the right of the attitude sphere. On aircraft which have a mechanical gyro compass are both the localizer and glide path indicated as a vertical and a horizontal arrow in the compass as well. But they are essentially read in the same way. On some aircraft is only the glide path indicated on two main instruments, and the oldest version of ILS-instruments was an instrument of its own used instead. This used two dangling bars, fixed in the middle of the top (localizer indicator) and in the middle of the left side (glide path indicator), and if the aircraft was located on the intended glide path, the dangling bars formed a cross. This is, in theory, however, more difficult to learn—but even for pilots experienced with using such indicators, it added another instrument they needed to focus on. With the indicators added to the artificial horizon (and to the compass), the pilot can theoretically watch the attitude simultaneously with the localizer and glide path.

In modern cockpits, the localizer is seen as a colored dot (usually in the shape of a diamond) at the bottom of the artificial horizon. It does not appear during cruise, but comes up during the descent and approach to the selected runway, provided that the navigation radio is set to the ILS frequency of that specific runway. If the transmitted localizer beam, which usually, but not always, is directed in the heading of the runway extension (exceptions exist, for instance, in Innsbruck, Austria and in Macao). If the aircraft is located on this line, the localizer dot will appear in the middle of the scale. But if the aircraft is located a little &quot;left&quot; of the beam, the marker will appear to the &quot;right&quot; on the localizer gauge scale in cockpit. The pilot then knows he or she must adjust the heading &quot;towards&quot; the dot.
In older cockpits, the localizer scale below the artificial horizon is rather short. But in older style cockpit instrumentation, the localizer also appears as an arrow in the gyro compass below the artificial horizon. The top and bottom of this arrow &quot;is one unit&quot;, which shows current heading. But the middle part of this arrow is moving independently of the aircraft&#x27;s heading. The middle of that arrow could be described as being &quot;stand alone&quot;, and moves to the left if the aircraft is located to the right of localizer beam and to the right if the aircraft is located to the left of the localizer beam. When the arrow is &quot;united&quot; to a straight line, then the aircraft is following the localizer beam. (This second &quot;arrow-indicator&quot; is omitted in modern cockpits, but the main compass is still located below the artificial horizon.)

The very first generation of localizer gauges had a different cockpit interface, and were not included in the artificial horizon nor any compass, but at a gauge of its own. The localizer was then represented as a dangling stick hanging from a fixed point at the top of a separate gauge, and the glide path was represented by a similar, but horizontal, dangling stick, fixed at one of the sides of the gauge. When the aircraft was located exactly at the ILS-beam (or glide path) the two sticks formed a cross. This interface resembles the flight director, which also forms a cross, but on the artificial horizon. This older ILS instrumentation system was omitted around the same time as jet airliners like Boeing 707 and DC 8 were introduced.

The expression &quot;catch the localizer&quot; refers to runway approaches with the autopilot engaged. The angle between the aircraft heading and localizer beam should be less than 30 degrees, and the indicated airspeed at least below 250 knots (for jet airliners), then by pushing a button marked &quot;APP&quot; or &quot;ILS&quot;, then the autopilot presumably will turn and then follow the localizer. The autopilot will then also automatically descend according to the glide path. Normal procedure is to capture the localizer first and then follow the glide path as well. If the angle is too large or the airspeed too high, capturing the localizer may be unsuccessful.

The cockpit ILS indicators are not to be confused with the flight director, which also places vertical and horizontal lines on the artificial horizon. A flight director only shows how the autopilot would fly. If the localizer dot (or arrow) indicate runway is to be found to the left, but the flight director suggests a right turn, and the runway is not visible, then the pilot in command is having difficulties.

==Localizer at runways==
When the glide path is unserviceable, the localizer element can often be conducted as a separate non-precision approach; or a standalone instrument approach installation without an associated glide path, both are abbreviated as &#x27;LOC&#x27; (or &#x27;LLZ&#x27; prior to 2007.)

<doc id="862137" wikidata="Q3987554" url="?curid=862137" title="The Hilarious House of Frightenstein">
<text>The Hilarious House of Frightenstein is a Canadian children&#x27;s television series, which was produced by Hamilton, Ontario&#x27;s independent station CHCH-TV in 1971. It was syndicated both in Canada and internationally, and occasionally still appears in some television markets. In Canada, the series has not aired on broadcast TV for several years, and used to be available on the streaming service Crave. 100 episodes are now available on the free streaming service Tubi (2021), and Pluto TV (2024).

A quirky sketch comedy series that included some educational content amid its zany humour, the show&#x27;s cast included Billy Van, Fishka Rais, Guy Big, Mitch Markowitz, Vincent Price, and Julius Sumner Miller. Van played most of the characters on the show. All 130 episodes were made in a nine-month span starting in 1971; the scenes with Miller were all filmed within one summer, and Price taped all of his scenes in four days.

In 2018, Headspinner Productions, the production firm of Ken Cuperus and Michelle Melanson, announced that it had acquired licensing and merchandising rights to the series, and was exploring the possibility of creating a new reboot. In 2021, the company announced an animated version for preschoolers, titled &quot;Happy House of Frightenstein&quot;.

In 2019, spoken word label Bleak December Inc completed a brand new full-cast audio production, &quot;Return to Frightenstein&quot;. The audio drama is a licensed production featuring Malcolm McDowell standing in for Vincent Price as host, Canadian actor Anthony D.P. Mann voicing several of the characters (including &quot;The Count&quot;, &quot;The Librarian&quot;, &quot;The Oracle&quot; and &quot;Dr. Pet Vet&quot;), Steven Spencer as &quot;Igor&quot;, and original series actor and co-producer Mitch Markowitz returning as &quot;Super Hippy&quot;. Other voice actors include Nikolas Yuen as &quot;The Wolf, Man!&quot;, Terry Wade as &quot;Bwana Clyde Batty&quot;, comedian Dave Hudson as &quot;Harvey Wallbanger&quot;, and Anne-Marie Bergman as &quot;Grizelda&quot;. The album has been announced for release in quarter three of 2019.

In 2024, Lev Gleason&#x27;s New Friday announced a continuation of the series as a one shot digest comic.

==Origins==
The production started with Riff Markowitz envisioning the concept and then inviting a room full of creative friends to a spaghetti and champagne &#x27;brainstorming&#x27; dinner party in his double suite at the Windsor Arms Hotel in Toronto.

CHCH had broadcast two other Markowitz shows: &quot;The Randy Dandy Show&quot; for children, starring Rafael Markowitz as Randy Dandy; and &quot;The Ed Allen Show&quot;, an exercise program. CHCH approved the production of &quot;Frightenstein&quot; to take advantage of the station&#x27;s new ability to reach into the Toronto market for advertising money.

Horror icon Vincent Price starred in introductions for the show&#x27;s various segments. Price, who was attracted to the project because he wanted to do something for kids, filmed all of his nearly 400 segments in four days for a fee of $13,000. Julius Sumner Miller, an American scientist and TV personality, appeared in every episode; although he put on a &quot;mad scientist&quot; persona, his segments featured straightforward science lessons and experiments.

On Canadian television stations, the show generally aired as a children&#x27;s show in an after-school or weekend morning time slot. In the United States, however, many stations aired it in a late night slot aimed primarily at college students. In an interview with film critic Richard Crouse on CFRB in the 2010s, Markowitz&#x27;s brother Mitch Markowitz — also an associate producer and bit-part performer on the show — acknowledged that while he and his brother always recognized the show had kid appeal because of the zany monster characters and lowbrow humour, it was always intended to also appeal to a young adult audience of alternative comedy fans. In some American markets, the show drew higher ratings than &quot;The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson&quot; among that demographic.

Writers of the series included Markowitz, Paul K. Willis and Michael Boncoeur.

==Characters==

Although each episode was nominally structured around the basic narrative premise of Count Frightenstein&#x27;s efforts to revive Brucie J. Monster, a Frankenstein-like monster, only some sketches (including the first sketch of each episode) directly addressed the premise itself, while most sketches depicted unrelated goings-on around the castle. Only the two main characters appeared in the &quot;plot&quot; sketches, although they could also appear in other sketches as well, while the supplementary characters generally only appeared in their own standalone sketches and were not part of the core &quot;plot&quot; sketches. This was primarily due to Van playing most featured character; Van never appeared opposite Miller or Price on screen.

===Main===
*Count Frightenstein (Van), the main character, was the 13th son of Count Dracula. Exiled to Castle Frightenstein in Frankenstone for his failure to revive Brucie, the core premise of the show was that he would be allowed to return to Transylvania only when (and if) he succeeded in his quest. Count Frightenstein was also a &quot;black sheep&quot; vampire in other ways, including his strong preference for eating pizza rather than drinking human blood. He also fancies himself an inventor, although his inventions generally have one of three faults: they are either dangerous, useless, or already a common household object upon which his version is not an improvement.
*Igor (Fishka Rais) was Frightenstein&#x27;s incompetent assistant.

===Supporting===
Supporting characters were played by Billy Van, except where specified.

*The Wolfman – A werewolf disk jockey at radio station EECH who spun rock and roll records while doing a Wolfman Jack impression. The Wolfman&#x27;s theme song was Sly and the Family Stone&#x27;s &quot;I Want to Take You Higher&quot;. The segment featured then-current hit singles by The Rolling Stones, Sly and the Family Stone, Three Dog Night or other Top 40 radio stars of the time (which were referred to as ‘golden oldies’ in order to avoid dating the program), with the Wolfman and Igor dancing in silhouette against a psychedelic background. Due to licensing reasons, the musical numbers are no longer shown on some reruns, although broadcasts on YTV in the early 2000s included the segments.
*The Grammar Slammer – The Grammar Slammer was a disembodied voice (Van) who challenged Igor to correct grammatical errors, accompanied by an eight-foot purple monster named Bammer (worn and voiced by Joe Torbay) who threatened to beat up Igor if he failed.
*The Professor (Julius Sumner Miller) – A professor who provided genuine science lessons on such things as thermal expansion and the cartesian diver, in the vein of &quot;Why Is It So?&quot;
*Bwana Clyde Batty – A British explorer who teaches about wild animals on &quot;Zany Zoo&quot;. His name is a spoof of animal trainer Clyde Beatty. His catchphrase is &quot;ooga booga!&quot;
*Dr. Pet Vet – A veterinarian who teaches about domestic animals (whereas &quot;Zany Zoo&quot; was about wild fauna). He always offers the day&#x27;s animal to Igor as a pet, but the Sloth in the basement invariably refuses to allow Igor to keep the animal. There were episodes in which Pet Vet did not actually appear on camera, but would communicate with Igor over the phone after sending the day&#x27;s animal over. 
*Grizelda, the Ghastly Gourmet – A witch voiced as a parody of Julia Child, who provides a version of a television cooking show as she cooks suitably ghastly recipes in her cauldron. In every one of her segments, she bangs her head on the pot above her cauldron and finally tastes her recipe with a loud slurping sound (sometimes declaring the recipe a failure after it causes a small explosion).
*The Librarian – An elderly curmudgeon who unsuccessfully tries to scare the viewers by reading children&#x27;s stories, such as &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot; and &quot;Henny Penny&quot;, which he thinks are horror stories. He also sometimes reads fables with unpleasant endings. He eventually admits to not being any more frightened than the viewers, but considers reading important nonetheless.
*The Maharishi – A Hindu guru who shares bits of mystically inscrutable wisdom (e.g. &quot;It is written, that he who kicks the blind beggar, in the marketplace, during an eclipse, can only curse the camel, for its lack of discipline.&quot;) A large bag of flowers (dyed carnations) would then fall on top of his head, after which he would make the peace sign.
*The Oracle – A mystic who reads out horoscopes in a Peter Lorre voice, invariably knocking over and breaking his crystal ball in the process. He also would often get his hand temporarily stuck inside his replacement crystal ball. He then answers questions supposedly sent in from viewers.
*The Mini-Count (Guy Big) is a three-foot tall clone of the Count, who appears in brief sketches where he tells a joke. Big was originally slated to play the main role as the Count, as the original character concept was based in part on the sight gag of a diminutive Count contrasted against Igor&#x27;s imposing height and weight. However, Big was not experienced enough as an actor to properly maintain Count Frightenstein&#x27;s desired accent, so the role was recast to star Van while a new smaller role was written for Big.

===Puppets===
Puppet characters were performed by puppeteer Joe Torbay.

*Harvey Wallbanger – The postmaster of Castle Frightenstein&#x27;s &quot;dead letter office&quot;, he would appear in sketches with the Count or Grizelda in which they answer letters.
*Gronk – A purple sea serpent who interacts with the Count or the Wolfman. Gronk would announce his presence with a loud call of &quot;Gronk!&quot; Gronk&#x27;s segments usually had the Count reading a book; the Count would then start explaining what the book was about, with Gronk interrupting him, usually mid-sentence, with a completely incorrect conclusion to what the Count had been reading. This would happen several times, leading to greater and greater frustration on the part of the Count. Segments with the Wolfman were generally one-line or two-line jokes.
*Bammer – A large purple monster who assisted the Grammar Slammer in correcting Igor&#x27;s poor grammar.

===Minor or interstitial characters===
*Super Hippy (Mitch Markowitz) — A hippie in a superhero costume who appears leading in and out of commercials, sitting or flying in varying locations as he delivers some variation on &quot;Don&#x27;t change the channel; we&#x27;ll be right back after these commercials&quot;.
*The Singing Soldier (Van) — A light-operetta styled palace guard who gets a cream pie thrown in his face whenever he starts to sing &quot;Indian Love Call&quot; from &quot;Rose-Marie&quot;.
*The Mosquito (Mitch Markowitz) – A mosquito who tells a bad joke about insects before biting a human foot.
*The Gorilla (Van or Paul Schultz) – A gorilla who would walk out of the jungle and invariably try to scare whomever he was looking at. In every segment, however, he would be thwarted by a ping-pong ball that would hit him square in the head, causing him to keel over. He often tried to avoid the ping-pong balls, in one instance by holding up a parasol.

==Home media==
On October 18, 2005, Empire Pictures released a single DVD featuring a handful of half-hour U.S.-syndicated episodes. The most significant change for these episodes as broadcast (apart from the length) was the addition of a laugh track.

On October 17, 2006, Alliance Atlantis Home Video in Canada released a three-disc box set of 13 full-length episodes, with restored Wolfman segments. The shows are not in chronological order, as only episodes that had thus far obtained music clearances for the Wolfman dance segments were included. The Wolfman theme, Sly &amp; the Family Stone&#x27;s &quot;I Want to Take You Higher&quot;, had not yet been cleared, so the opening was altered with new music by the Tijuana Bibles from Toronto, and Van&#x27;s voice was redubbed by another Toronto voice actor, as Van himself had died in 2003. For recent airings in Canada on the cable networks Drive-In Classics and Space, the main &quot;Frightenstein&quot; theme is also a re-recording, because of licensing restrictions by Morning Music, Ltd.

Critical Mass Releasing Inc. of Toronto released the series in 2006 for broadcast on CHUM Television stations.

A second set of nine episodes was released by Critical Mass in late 2008.

On July 19, 2019, the entire series, without the Wolfman segments, became available to stream on Crave in Canada.

==Graphic Novel==
The popularity of the series led co-creator/original cast member Mitch Markowitz to create a digest comic that serves as a continuation of the original series. Published by Lev Gleason&#x27;s New Friday and written by Carson Demmans with art by Jason Sylvestre.

==Memorable quotes==
* Opening Poem – Vincent Price – &quot;Another lovely day begins, for ghosts and ghouls with greenish skin. So close your eyes and you will find that you&#x27;ve arrived in Frightenstein. Perhaps the Count will find a way to make his monster work today. For if he solves this monster-mania, he can return to Transylvania! So welcome where the sun won&#x27;t shine, to the castle of Count Frightenstein!&quot; (this dissolved into maniacal laughter).
* National Anthem – Igor/Fishka Rais – &quot;Gory, gory Transylvania! Where wolves and bats will always maim ya. The murky moors will likely claim ya, As we go stumbling through, through, through, through.&quot; Sung to the tune of &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;. Sung once by Igor before the Count recites the Pledge, hummed by him during the Count&#x27;s Pledge, and repeated afterwards by him as a big finish (&quot;Gory, gory, Transylvania! As we go stumbling...&quot;) usually topped off by the Count singing the last word (&quot;through!&quot;).
* Pledge – Count/Billy Van – &quot;I pledge by the sign of the three-toed sloth, that I will do my best to do my duty. To always obey the laws of the werewolf pack. And to never rest, until Brucie lives once more, and takes his rightful place in the annals of distinguished monsters, and I can once again return to that most goriest of homelands...&quot; (many times the Count is showing off his heart-shaped three-toed sloth pendant (on an elastic black string around his neck) to the camera. After the first line, he lets go of it, it flies back against his throat, and the Count does a choked/injured double take before going on with the rest of the Pledge).
* Closing Poem – Vincent Price – &quot;The castle lights are growing dim. There&#x27;s no one left but me-and &quot;him.&quot; [he nods towards Brucie behind him] When next we meet in Frankenstone...&quot;don&#x27;t&quot; come alone.&quot;

== Legacy ==
&quot;The Hilarious House of Frightenstein&quot; was referenced in the first episode of the Ed the Sock program &quot;This Movie Sucks!&quot;, which is another program produced and broadcast by CHCH. In the episode the hosts refer to them being in a studio that has produced many classic television shows, and Ed comments that they have the coffee maker from &quot;The Hilarious House of Frightenstein&quot;, along with the original coffee.

Comedian Mike Myers acknowledged the show as an important formative influence on his comedy in his 2016 book &quot;Mike Myers&#x27; Canada&quot;.

James &quot;Jimbo&quot; Insell, a Canadian drag queen most noted for competing on the first season of &quot;Canada&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;, cited &quot;The Hilarious House of Frightenstein&quot; as one of the models for &quot;House of Jimbo&quot;, a comedy/variety series he plans to produce.

&quot;Return to Frightenstein,&quot; a full-cast audio play produced by Bleak December was released on streaming platforms in September, 2019.

&quot;Happy House of Frightenstein&quot;, an animated reboot which follows the adventures of Count Jr., Igor, Griselda, the Wolfman and Gronk as children, premiered on Family Jr. in 2021.

<doc id="862138" wikidata="Q366258" url="?curid=862138" title="Thomas Doll">
<text>Thomas Jens Uwe Doll (born 9 April 1966) is a German professional football manager and a former football player. As a player, he played as an attacking midfielder for F.C. Hansa Rostock, BFC Dynamo, Hamburger SV, Lazio, Eintracht Frankfurt and Bari.

==Club career==
Doll began playing football for the youth teams of local side BSG Lokomotiv Malchin. He was allowed to join the youth academy of football club F.C. Hansa Rostock in 1979. Doll joined the first team of F.C. Hansa Rostock in 1983. He made his debut for F.C. Hansa Rostock in the DDR-Oberliga away against BSG Stahl Riesa in the third matchday of the 1983-84 DDR-Oberliga on 27 August 1983.

F.C. Hansa Rostock was relegated to the second tier DDR-Liga after the 1985-86 DDR-Oberliga. Doll then joined BFC Dynamo in order to ensure a chance to play for the national team. BFC Dynamo was the dominant team in East German football at the time. Doll had the opportunity to choose between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden, but wanted to go to Berlin to be able to stay close to his family and because he already knew players in BFC Dynamo from the national youth teams, such as Andreas Thom.

Doll immediately became a regular player in the first team of BFC Dynamo. He scored his first goal for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga in the derby against 1. FC Union Berlin at the Stadion der Weltjugend on 13 September 1986. BFC Dynamo won the match with a massive 8–1. Doll and Thom formed one of the most effective attacking constellations in East German football in the late 1980s. Doll won the DDR-Oberliga in 1987 and 1988 and the FDGB-Pokal in 1988 and 1989 with BFC Dynamo. BFC Dynamo then met SG Dynamo Dresden in the first ever DFV-Supercup on 5 August 1989. BFC Dynamo won the match 4-1 and became the first and only winner of the DFV-Supercup in the history of East German football. Doll scored two goals in the match.

After reunification, Doll was one of the most sought-after players of coming out of the former East Germany. Together with fellow sweeper Frank Rohde in BFC Dynamo he joined Hamburger SV in 1990. After just one season there he had impressed sufficiently to move to Italian side Lazio for a then record fee of DM15 million. He played at Lazio for three years, before returning to the Bundesliga in 1994, joining Eintracht Frankfurt, but he was hampered by injuries in the three seasons he spent with the club and made only 28 appearances. After a year in Italy with Bari, he returned to Hamburger SV in 1998. He played another three seasons, but injuries continued to take their toll.

==International career==
At international level, Doll represented both East Germany (29 caps, seven goals) and the unified Germany (18 caps, 1 goal). His last international appearance came in 1993. He was part of Germany&#x27;s squad for Euro 1992 where the side finished as runners-up to Denmark.

==Coaching career==
===Hamburger SV===
Following his retirement, he became part of Hamburg&#x27;s coaching staff, managing the reserves from 2002 until being appointed first-team manager in 2004.

Early in his tenure as coach with Hamburg, he enjoyed some success, saving the team from relegation in his first season, winning the Intertoto Cup, and then guiding the club to a much-improved third-place result in the 2005–06 season to earn a Champions League berth. The 2006–07 season, however, was less successful for the coach. The team delivered a disappointing performance in the Champions League that saw only one win in six first-round games, and then plunged to the bottom of the Bundesliga table by mid-season. Doll was sacked on 1 February 2007.

===Borussia Dortmund===
On 19 May 2008, Doll resigned as the coach of Borussia Dortmund after the team finished a disappointing 13th in the Bundesliga.

===Gençlerbirliği===
He agreed to manage Gençlerbirliği S.K. and signed a two-year contract.

===Al-Hilal===
On 20 July 2011, he was appointed as head coach of Saudi Arabian champion team, Al-Hilal but was sacked on 22 January 2012.

===Ferencváros===

He became head coach of Hungarian club Ferencváros on 18 December 2013. On 20 May 2015, Ferencváros beat Videoton 4–0 at the Groupama Arena in the 2014–15 Magyar Kupa Final.

Doll&#x27;s Ferencváros secured the club&#x27;s 29th Nemzeti Bajnokság I title on 2 April 2016 after a defeat at the Nagyerdei Stadion against Debreceni VSC. By winning the 2015–16 Nemzeti Bajnokság I season, Doll managed to win all the possible titles in football in Hungary.
In recognition of his record performance with Ferencváros, Doll received the &quot;Coach of the year in NB I&quot; award from the Hungarian Football Federation in 2016.

Ferencváros were eliminated in the second round of the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League by the second-placed team of the 2015-16 Albanian Superliga, FK Partizani Tirana, on penalties. They placed fourth in the 2016–17 Nemzeti Bajnokság I season - the title was won by their rivals Budapest Honvéd FC. However, Ferencváros fans were consoled by the team&#x27;s win in the 2017 Magyar Kupa Final against Vasas SC.

The 2017–18 Nemzeti Bajnokság I season started with moderate success, but aspirations in international cups were once again thwarted when Ferencváros lost to FC Midtjylland in the second round of the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League.

===Hannover 96===
On 27 January 2019, Bundesliga club Hannover 96 announced Doll as the new manager of the club, replacing the sacked André Breitenreiter. He left the club as Mirko Slomka was confirmed as the club&#x27;s new manager on 28 May 2019.

===APOEL FC===
On 15 August 2019, Doll became manager of APOEL.

Having managed to guide APOEL to the round of 32 of the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League, on 9 December 2019, Doll got relieved of his duties as the club&#x27;s manager by mutual consent.

===Persija Jakarta===
On 23 April 2022, Liga 1 club Persija Jakarta announced Doll as the new manager of the club in a three-year deal. In his first season, he finished in second place.

==Personal life==
Doll has two daughters, one with his Italian-born wife Roberta, the other with a former wife now married to another ex-footballer, Olaf Bodden. He lives in Budapest.

==Controversy==
In late January 2023, tension arose between Doll and Shin Tae-yong, the Indonesia national football team head coach. Doll declined nine players&#x27; invitations to attend the national team training camp. Additionally, Doll criticized Shin during a press conference, likening him to a clown for his involvement in television advertisements.

<text>Lance Gerard Woolaver (born 1948) is a Canadian author, poet, playwright, lyricist, and director. His best-known works include books, film and biographical plays about Canadian folk artist Maud Lewis, including &quot;Maud Lewis The Heart on the Door,&quot; and &quot;Maud Lewis - World Without Shadows&quot;. His plays include one about international singer Portia White, who was born in Nova Scotia: &quot;Portia White - First You Dream&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Woolaver was born in Digby County, Nova Scotia, in 1948. He attended Acadia and Dalhousie universities in Nova Scotia, and the Sorbonne in Paris. 

As a child, Woolaver had seen Maud and Everett Lewis, and their tiny painted house. He noticed tourists stopping to buy paintings, but kept his distance from these local characters. However, he was later inspired to pitch an article on Maud Lewis to &quot;Chatelaine&quot; magazine. The article was accepted on the condition that Woolaver co-write it with a female author. He wrote with his mother, and the resulting article, &quot;The Joyful Art of Maud Lewis,&quot; published in December 1975, was purchased for $700, a sum he considered &quot;a fortune&quot; at the time. This enabled and encouraged him to devote time to writing. He later wrote a book and two plays about Maud Lewis.

Woolaver published earlier stories in the 1970s in Canadian literary magazines, including the &quot;Wascana Review&quot; (which ceased publication in 2012) and &quot;The Fiddlehead&quot;.

===Marriage and family===
Woolaver lives in Halifax with his wife, Martha (Spencer) of Saskatoon. They married in 1967, and have two children, and two grandchildren. Woolaver enjoys flyfishing in the Canadian Rockies, and on the Margaree River in Cape Breton Island.

==Literary career==

Woolaver wrote the book &quot;The Illuminated Life of Maud Lewis&quot; (1996), with photographs by Bob Brooks. It was awarded the Dartmouth Book Award and the Atlantic Booksellers Award. It was adapted as a film of the same name (with screenplay by Woolaver) that aired on Canadian VisionTV in 1998. The film was directed by Peter d&#x27;Entremont and produced by Triad Film Productions and the National Film Board of Canada.

Woolaver&#x27;s play &quot;Maud Lewis - World Without Shadows&quot; has been produced by professional and community theatres, including Neptune Theatre (Halifax), King’s Theatre of Annapolis Royal and Ship’s Company Theatre of Parrsboro in Nova Scotia, and the Blyth Festival of Ontario. It was also adapted and produced as a CBC Radio national broadcast. 

His play &quot;The Poor Farm,&quot; was produced at the Chester Playhouse under the direction of Christopher Heide of Mahone Bay. It was the first play in Nova Scotia to engage actors of Mi’kmaq, White, Black and Acadian heritage in the same production. It dealt with the politics of poverty and the system of provincial poor farms. 

Woolaver&#x27;s collection of Christmas songs, &quot;The Noel Cantata,&quot; was recently produced in Norway. 

His young adult novel &quot;The Outlaw League&quot; (1991) was adapted for film, and he wrote the screenplay. Based in his hometown, it was shot in Restigouche, New Brunswick. It was produced in Montreal as &quot;La Gang des Hors la Loi&quot;; it won the Vancouver Reel to Real Film Festival in 2015. 

His play &quot;Portia White - First You Dream,&quot; about Portia White, a Nova Scotia native and Canada&#x27;s first black singer to win international acclaim, has been produced by several theaters, including the Victoria Playhouse in Petrolia, Ontario.

His newest novel, &quot;The Halflife of Evil&quot;, will be published by Spencer Books in June 2018. It is about Maud Lewis, the provincial Poor Farm, and the policies of imprisonment of the poor.

===Maud Lewis===
Woolaver is best known for his works on the life and art of Maud Lewis. He wrote a picture book of Maud’s life, &quot;The Illuminated Life of Maud Lewis&quot; (1996), with photographs of Maud and her works by Bob Brooks. It has been in continuous print since being published. The cover image of Maud Lewis in the sunny corner of her tiny house has been recognized as a classic portrait, said to rank with the work of Yousuf Karsh. 

&quot;Maud Lewis - World Without Shadows,&quot; his play about Maud Lewis and her husband Everett Lewis, has been produced across Canada and broadcast by CBC radio. It tells of Maud’s struggle against juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and triumph as an artist, despite poverty. Canadian actor Nicola Lipman played Maud to great acclaim in the 1990s Ship’s Company Theatre and Neptune Theatre productions.

His play &quot;The Return of Her Child&quot; deals with issues related to the adoption of Maud Lewis&#x27;s daughter Catherine by Mamie Crosby.

Woolaver&#x27;s recent full biography, &quot;Maud Lewis The Heart on the Door&quot; (2016), features another Brooks&#x27; portrait of the artist, taken in 1965, in which Lewis appears frightened and fearful. This is appropriate to the darker tone of this work, as Woolaver explores many issues in her life. His account contrasts also with the portrayal of Lewis in the independent feature drama film, &quot;Maudie&quot;.

===&quot;The Outlaw League&quot; / &quot;La Gang des Hors la Loi&quot; ===

&quot;The Outlaw League&quot; (1991) is a young adult novel, which Woolaver set in his home town of Digby, Nova Scotia. It explores the role of baseball in bringing the people of the village together. Woolaver refers to childhood friends in his book, and to former Digby baseball teams, including the Digby Ravens, the Bear River Blue Sox, and the Freeport Schooners. 

The novel was adapted as a 2014 film, &quot;La Gang des Hors la Loi&quot;, produced by Rock Demers of Productions La Fete, from a script by André Melançon, Jean Beaudry, and Woolaver.

<text>Thomas Stevenson (22 July 1818 – 8 May 1887) was a pioneering Scottish civil engineer, lighthouse designer and meteorologist, who designed over thirty lighthouses in and around Scotland, as well as the Stevenson screen used in meteorology. His designs, celebrated as ground breaking, ushered in a new era of lighthouse creation.

He served as president of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts (1859–60), as president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1884–86), and was a co-founder of the Scottish Meteorological Society.

He was the father of writer Robert Louis Stevenson.

==Life and career==
He was born at 2 Baxters Place in Edinburgh, on 22 July 1818, the youngest son of engineer Robert Stevenson, and his wife (and step-sister) Jean Smith. He was educated at the Royal High School in Edinburgh.

Thomas Stevenson was a devout and regular attendee at St. Stephen&#x27;s Church in Stockbridge, at the north end of St Vincent Street, Edinburgh.

He lived with his family at Baxters Place until he got married in 1848. He then got a house at 8 Howard Place. By 1855 he moved to 1 Inverleith Terrace. From at least 1860 he lived at 17 Heriot Row, a large Georgian terraced townhouse in Edinburgh&#x27;s New Town.

In 1864, he published &quot;The design and construction of harbours: a treatise on maritime engineering&quot;. The book was based on an article he had originally written for the Encyclopædia Britannica, and covered the principles and practices involved in harbour design and construction. The work discussed the geological and physical features affecting harbour design, the generation and impact of waves, along with construction materials and masonry types for quay walls. The book also explored the efficacy of tides and fresh water in maintaining outfalls. A second edition of the book was published in 1874.

In 1869, as a successful experiment into using the newly invented electric light for lighthouses, Stevenson had an underwater cable installed from the eastern part of Granton Harbour, and a light on the end of the Trinity Chain Pier was controlled from half a mile away by an operator on the harbour. He designed the Stevenson screen as a shelter to shield meteorological instruments, and this has been widely adopted.

He died at 17 Heriot Row in Edinburgh on 8 May 1887 and is buried in the Stevenson family vault in New Calton Cemetery. The vault lies midway along the eastern wall.

=== Stevenson&#x27;s formula for the prediction of wave heights ===
In the course of his work as a lighthouse and harbour engineer, Stevenson had made observations of wave heights at various locations in Scotland over a number of years. In 1852, he published a paper in which he suggested that waves increased in height by a ratio approximate to the square root of their distance from the windward shore. Stevenson developed this into the simple formula formula_1, in which formula_2 is the wave height in feet and formula_3 is the fetch in miles.

Essential components for wave height prediction, most notably wind speed, are missing from Stevenson&#x27;s formula. In 1852, mathematical analysis of the theory of water waves, and methods for numerical assessment of factors such as shoaling and surge, were in their infancy. Stevenson&#x27;s analysis is possibly the first quantitative discussion of wave height as a (square root) function of fetch, and his paper is one of the first quantitative studies of wind speeds in the planetary boundary layer. 

Modern analysis of Stevenson&#x27;s formula indicates that it appears to conservatively estimate wave heights for wind speeds up to around 30 miles per hour, being based on his observations which most likely were taken for fetch lengths under 100 kilometres, without fully developed seas. The breakwater at Wick was exposed to a fetch length of approximately 500 kilometres, and wind speeds far in excess of 30 miles per hour, prior to its eventual destruction. 

In 1965, the South African engineer Basil Wrigley Wilson proposed a method which can be used to approximate the significant wave height &quot;H1/3&quot; and period &quot;T1/3&quot; of wind waves generated by a constant wind of speed &quot;U&quot; blowing over a fetch length &quot;F&quot;. The units for these quantities are as follows:

* &quot;H1/3&quot; in metres (m)
* &quot;T1/3&quot; in seconds (s)
* &quot;U&quot; in metres per second (m/s)
* &quot;F&quot; in metres (m)

Wilson&#x27;s formulae apply when the duration of the wind blowing is sufficiently long, as when the wind blows for only a limited time, waves cannot attain the full height and period corresponding to the wind speed and fetch length. Under conditions were the wind blows for a sufficiently long time, for example during a prolonged storm, the wave height and period can be calculated as follows:

:formula_4
:formula_5

In these formulae, &quot;g&quot; denotes the acceleration due to gravity, which is approximately 9.807 m/s2. The wind speed &quot;U&quot; is measured at an elevation of 10 metres above the sea surface. For conditions approximate to those for the Wick breakwater during a storm (fetch length of 500km, wind speed of around 75mph), the graph below shows that Wilson&#x27;s method predicts a significant wave height (&quot;H1/3&quot;) of around 1.5 times that of Stevenson&#x27;s.

Nonetheless, whilst Stevenson&#x27;s formula is highly limited and unsuitable for engineering design application, it was notable for being an early attempt to apply mathematical theory to hydraulic engineering problems, and shows some limited agreement (albeit within a narrow range) with a more advanced formula developed by Ramón Iribarren in 1942. A major flaw in Stevenson&#x27;s formula is the absence of consideration of wind speed, and comparison with Wilson&#x27;s formula at 3 different wind speeds (30, 50 and 75mph) shows only a reasonable level of agreement for 50mph winds at fetch lengths up to around 100 metres.

Stevenson himself noted that the formula was an approximation, and actively encouraged further research into similar problems, imploring young engineers to redouble efforts in the advancement of coastal engineering during an 1885 address to the Institution of Civil Engineers in London. In addition to his work on wave growth, he also undertook research into the phenomenon of wave decay inside harbour basins.

=== The breakwater at Wick, Caithness ===
Stevenson designed and supervised the construction of a breakwater at Wick in 1863, which at the time was the largest herring fishery in Europe. The inner harbour, designed by Thomas Telford, was completed in 1811, followed by the construction of the expanded outer harbour by James Bremner between 1825 and 1834. However, by 1857, the need for increased capacity became evident, leading the British Fishery Society to propose a new breakwater. In 1862 Stevenson, along with his brother David, prepared detailed plans, sections, and specifications for the harbour&#x27;s extension. This design received support from Sir John Coode and John Hawkshaw. A loan of £62,000 was sanctioned by A. M. Rendel, the engineer for the Public Works Loan Commission.

Construction commenced in April 1863, aiming for a final length of 460 metres. Stevenson&#x27;s design featured a rubble mound extending to 5.5 metres above the low water mark, following the Crane Rocks. This was capped with block walls and in-filled with rubble, providing a superstructure up to 16 metres wide. The rubble for the mound was sourced from local quarries and transported by steam locomotives. This was then deposited onto the breakwater mound using travelling gantries that ran along the staging, marking a possible first in Scotland for this technique. The seaward wall was constructed with a 6:1 batter. Below the waterline, the blocks were dry-jointed, whereas above the high-water mark, initially Roman and later Portland cement mortar was used.

The breakwater failed progressively as a result of several storms, and by 1870 it had lost one third of its length. It was eventually abandoned in 1877, after further severe storm damage, despite repeated failed attempts at its reconstruction. Stevenson noted, in correspondence with the Institution of Civil Engineers, that a single storm had at one stage removed 1,350 tonnes of material from the breakwater, but he was unable to provide the height of the waves during the event.

Applying present-day techniques to calculate local wave conditions demonstrates that the breakwater as built would not have survived without mobilising additional restraint, or a mechanism to abate wave forces. Stevenson&#x27;s own wave formula would have predicted offshore wave heights for Wick of around 8 to 10 metres, whereas modern observations show that the North Sea exhibits wave heights of up to two to three times this figure. 

==Family==
He was brother of the lighthouse engineers Alan and David Stevenson, between 1854 and 1886 he designed many lighthouses, with his brother David, and then with David&#x27;s son David Alan Stevenson.

He married Margaret Isabella &quot;Maggie&quot; Balfour in 1848, daughter of Rev Lewis Balfour. Their son was the writer Robert Louis Stevenson, who initially caused him much disappointment by failing to follow the engineering interests of his family.

His wife&#x27;s younger brother, James Melville Balfour (i.e. his brother-in-law), trained under D. &amp; T. Stevenson and then emigrated to New Zealand, where he was first the marine engineer for Otago Province before he was appointed Colonial Marine Engineer.

<text>Revolutionary Socialist Party of Kerala (Bolshevik) is formed as a splinter group from RSP in Kerala in 2001. The party leader at the time of its formation was Baby John, formerly an important RSP leader in Kerala.

RSP(B) joined the UDF, the alliance in Kerala which is led by the INC. The party won 2 seats in the state assembly, Shibu Baby John and Babu Divakaran, in the 2001 election. Babu Divakaran became the Minister of Labour in the state government.

In 2005 RSP(B) left UDF, a decision largely attributed to the party general secretary A. V. Thamarakshan. Babu Divakaran split away and formed the RSP(M). RSP(M) joined in UDF.. RSP(B) merged with JSS in 2009.

==Alliance and break-up==
RSP(B) had an alliance with BJP in Kerala since 2014 till 2016 when A.V. Thamarakshan decided to break the alliance and go alone in the 2016 Kerala assembly elections.

<doc id="862144" wikidata="Q7875663" url="?curid=862144" title="USS Wyoming (1859)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Wyoming&quot; of the United States Navy was a wooden-hulled screw sloop that fought on the Union side during the American Civil War. Sent to the Pacific Ocean to search for the CSS &quot;Alabama&quot;, &quot;Wyoming&quot; eventually came upon the shores of Japan and engaged Japanese land and sea forces. On 16 July 1863, &quot;Wyoming&quot; won the first-ever United States naval victory over Japan in the Battle of Shimonoseki Straits.

==Service history==
The ship was laid down at the Philadelphia Navy Yard in July 1858, launched on 19 January 1859, sponsored by Mary Florida Grice, and commissioned in October 1859, Commander John K. Mitchell in command. She was named for the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania, not the state of Wyoming which did not yet exist.

===West Coast, 1859–1862===
&quot;Wyoming&quot; soon sailed via Cape Horn for the Pacific and arrived off the coast of Nicaragua in April 1860. There, she relieved and operated along the Pacific coast of the United States and Central America into the spring of 1861. During that time, she participated in the search for &quot;Levant&quot; when that warship disappeared in the late autumn of 1860.

The outbreak of the Civil War found &quot;Wyoming&quot; at San Francisco, California, preparing for another cruise. She was instructed to remain in the vicinity of the Golden Gate to protect mail steamers operating off the California coast, but CDR Mitchell — a naval officer of Southern origin and persuasion — defied his orders and took his ship to Panama instead.

Mitchell&#x27;s flagrant disobedience cost him his command and also resulted in his dismissal from the service. As a result, &quot;Wyoming&quot; came under the temporary command of her executive officer, Lt. Francis K. Murray, on 4 July 1861. While returning to Monterey, California, &quot;Wyoming&quot; was plagued by mishaps. First, her bottom struck a coral head off La Paz, Baja California Sur, and was pulled free only after three days aground during which she lost her false keel. She then ran short of coal and arrived at Monterey with empty bunkers.

&quot;Wyoming&quot; subsequently shifted to San Francisco where, on 9 August, she received a new commanding officer, Commander David McDougal. The warship then proceeded to the coast of Lower California to protect American whaling interests against possible incursions by Confederate cruisers. After that service, she operated in South American waters into 1862.

===Far East, 1862–1863===
Following repairs at Mare Island, &quot;Wyoming&quot; received orders — dated 16 June 1862 — to proceed immediately to the Far East in search of &quot;armed piratical cruisers fitted out by the rebels&quot; and soon headed west, bound for the Orient.

Word of the Union ship&#x27;s subsequent appearance in Far Eastern waters spread fast and far. In the Sunda Strait, off Java, Captain Raphael Semmes, the commanding officer of Confederate cruiser &quot;Alabama&quot;, learned from an English brig of &quot;Wyoming&#x27;s&quot; arrival in the East Indies; and a Dutch trader later confirmed this report. On 26 October, Semmes wrote confidently in his journal that &quot;&quot;Wyoming&quot; is a good match for this ship,&quot; and &quot;I have resolved to give her battle. She is reported to be cruising under sail — probably with banked fires — and anchors, no doubt, under Krakatoa every night, and I hope to surprise her, the moon being near its full.&quot;

Although in their search for each other, &quot;Wyoming&quot; and &quot;Alabama&quot; unknowingly came close to each other, they never met; and it would be up to another Union warship, the sloop , to destroy the elusive Confederate raider. Yet, despite being unsuccessful in tracking down Confederate cruisers, &quot;Wyoming&quot; did render important service to uphold the honor of the American flag in the Far East the following year, 1863.

Ordered to Philadelphia that spring — after what had been a largely fruitless cruise — &quot;Wyoming&quot; was in the midst of preparations to leave the East Indies when an event occurred that changed her plans.

===The Battle of the Straits of Shimonoseki, 1863===

On 10 May 1863, &quot;Wyoming&quot; at Yokohama, Japan. Attempts by to refloat her were unsuccessful as the tide was falling. She was refloated the next day and taken in to &quot;Yokohama&quot;. &quot;Wyoming&quot; was stationed there as a show of force, standing by to protect American lives and property during an outbreak of anti-foreign agitation in Japan. Nevertheless, that agitation continued into the early summer months, as the &quot;sonnō jōi&quot; movement grew in strength with increasing resentment by the Japanese to the terms of the recent unequal treaties signed with the western powers. Emperor Kōmei issued a decree setting 25 June 1863 as the date for the expulsion of all aliens from Japan.

Although the Tokugawa shogunate was largely powerless to force compliance with this directive, the powerful pro-&quot;sonnō jōi&quot; daimyō of Chōshū Domain, the Mōri Takachika took the decree literally and decided to attack foreign ships passing through the Straits of Shimonoseki, which the domain regarded as part of its territory.

At one o&#x27;clock on the morning of 26 June, two armed vessels of Chōshū Domain attacked the American merchantman &quot;Pembroke&quot;, bound for Nagasaki and Shanghai, as she lay anchored in the Strait of Shimonoseki. &quot;Pembroke&quot; suffered no casualties; got underway; and moved out of danger, escaping via Bungo Strait and continuing her voyage for Shanghai, post-haste, without making her scheduled stop at Nagasaki.

Word of the incident did not reach Yokohama from Japanese sources until 10 July. That evening, mail from Shanghai brought &quot;authentic information&quot; confirming the Japanese report. The United States Minister in Japan, Robert H. Pruyn, sent for the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the Japanese government and informed him — in the presence of Comdr. McDougal — of the gravity of the situation, stressing that an insult to the American flag was a serious matter. After being told by Pruyn that the United States government would demand satisfaction and expect a statement from the Japanese concerning the offense, the Japanese diplomat begged that the Americans do nothing until his government at Edo took action.

After the Japanese left, McDougal told Pruyn that he had decided to proceed instantly to the Shimonoseki Strait to seize and, if necessary, to destroy, the offending vessels. The two men agreed that lack of punitive action would encourage further anti-foreign incidents.
Accordingly, &quot;Wyoming&quot; prepared for sea. At 4:45 a.m. on 13 July, CDR McDougal called all hands; and the sloop got underway 15 minutes later, bound for the strait. After a two-day voyage, &quot;Wyoming&quot; arrived off the island of Himeshima on the evening of 15 July and anchored off the south side of that island.

At five o&#x27;clock the following morning, &quot;Wyoming&quot; weighed anchor and steamed toward the Strait of Shimonoseki. She went to general quarters at nine, loaded her pivot guns with shell, and cleared for action. The warship entered the strait at 10:45 and beat to quarters. Soon, three signal guns boomed from the landward, alerting the Chōshū coastal artillery batteries and warships of &quot;Wyoming&#x27;s&quot; arrival.

At about 11:15, after being fired upon from the shore batteries, &quot;Wyoming&quot; hoisted her colors and replied with her 11-inch pivot guns. Momentarily ignoring the batteries, McDougal ordered &quot;Wyoming&quot; to continue steaming toward a bark, a steamer, and a brig at anchor off the town of Shimonoseki. Meanwhile, four shore batteries took the warship under fire. &quot;Wyoming&quot; answered the Japanese cannon &quot;as fast as the guns could be brought to bear&quot; while shells from the shore guns passed through her rigging.

&quot;Wyoming&quot; then passed between the brig and the bark on the starboard hand and the steamer on the port, steaming within a pistol shot&#x27;s range. One shot from either the bark or brig struck near &quot;Wyoming&#x27;s&quot; forward broadside gun, killing two men and wounding four. Elsewhere on the ship, a Marine was struck dead by a piece of shrapnel.

&quot;Wyoming&quot;, in hostile territory, then grounded in uncharted waters shortly after she had made one run past the forts. The Japanese steamer, in the meantime, had slipped her cable and headed directly for &quot;Wyoming&quot; — possibly to attempt a boarding. The American man-of-war, however, managed to work free of the mud and then unleashed her 11-inch Dahlgren guns on the enemy ship, hulling and damaging her severely. Two well-directed shots exploded her boilers and, as she began to sink, her crew abandoned the ship.

&quot;Wyoming&quot; then passed the bark and the brig, firing into them steadily and methodically. Some shells were &quot;overs&quot; and landed in the town ashore, setting it on fire. As Comdr. McDougal wrote in his report to Gideon Welles on 23 July, &quot;the punishment inflicted (upon the daimyo) and in store for him will, I trust, teach him a lesson that will not soon be forgotten.&quot;

After having been in combat for a little over an hour, &quot;Wyoming&quot; returned to Yokohama. She had been hulled 11 times, with considerable damage to her smokestack and rigging. Her casualties had been comparatively light: four men killed and seven wounded — one of whom later died. Significantly, &quot;Wyoming&quot; had been the first foreign warship to take offensive action to uphold treaty rights in Japan.

===Hunting the raiders, 1863–1864===
However, the ship&#x27;s projected return to Philadelphia did not materialize due to the supposed continued presence of &quot;Alabama&quot; in Far Eastern waters. She repaired her damages, resumed the search and sailed to the Dutch East Indies. She subsequently voyaged to Christmas Island, examining it to determine whether or not it was used as a supply base for &quot;the use of rebel cruisers.&quot; Finding the island uninhabited and the report of its use as a supply base unfounded, &quot;Wyoming&quot; returned to Anjer, Java, where McDougal found out, to his surprise, that &quot;Alabama&quot; had passed the Sunda Strait on 10 November — only a day after &quot;Wyoming&quot; had sailed for Christmas Island. At noon that day, &quot;Alabama&quot; and &quot;Wyoming&quot; had been only 25 miles apart.

Writing from Batavia on 22 November, McDougal later reported that &quot;Wyoming&quot; had scoured the waters of the East Indies, visiting &quot;every place in this neighborhood where she (&quot;Alabama&quot;) would likely lay in case she intended to remain in this region.&quot; Although acknowledging that the condition of &quot;Wyoming&#x27;s&quot; boilers prevented a heavy pressure of steam from being carried, McDougal promised to make every effort in his power to find and capture &quot;Alabama&quot;.

&quot;Wyoming&quot; then cruised to Singapore in search of the Confederate raider, but found nothing, and continued on to the Dutch settlement of Rhio, near Sunda Strait. She subsequently sailed north, putting into Cavite, Luzon, in the Philippine Islands, on Christmas Eve. There, through the courtesy of the Spanish Navy, &quot;Wyoming&quot; underwent much-needed boiler repairs and coaled. She then sailed for Hong Kong and Huangpu, China.

&quot;Wyoming&quot; continued her search for the elusive &quot;Alabama&quot; into February 1864. She sailed to Fuzhou, China, to protect American interests and proceeded thence, via Hong Kong, to the East Indies. When the sloop-of-war reached Batavia, however, CDR McDougal found that there was now no alternative but to return to the United States for repairs, because the ship&#x27;s boilers were in such poor condition. Accordingly, &quot;Wyoming&quot; began her long-delayed return voyage to the United States, via Anjer, the Cape of Good Hope, St. Helena, and St. Thomas. After a voyage of almost three months, she arrived at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 13 July 1864; having completed a circumnavigation of the globe begun when she left that port following her commissioning.

The presence of CSS &quot;Florida&quot; off the East Coast, however, meant another change in plans for the weary &quot;Wyoming&quot;. Commodore Cornelius Stribling, Commandant of the Philadelphia Navy Yard, ordered the newly arrived screw sloop to sea to search for &quot;Florida&quot;. &quot;It is with regret that I send you on this service,&quot; Stribling wrote McDougal, &quot;After so long a cruise, and one in which you have rendered such important service, yourself, officers and crew, were entitled to a respite from active service; but the great importance of capturing the rebel privateer will, I hope, be an incentive to all under your command cheerfully to perform this service.&quot;

Although &quot;Wyoming&quot; required extensive repairs, she nevertheless sailed. As events proved, however, &quot;Wyoming&#x27;s&quot; machinery — so long from repairs in an American Navy Yard — proved unequal to the strain. For five days, the ship attempted to carry out the orders given her — contending with fresh northeast winds and a head sea — but returned to Philadelphia on 19 July, due to a leaky boiler. She was decommissioned on 23 July for a complete overhaul.

===East Indies Station, 1865–1868===
Recommissioned on 11 April 1865, Comdr. John P. Bankhead in command, &quot;Wyoming&quot; proceeded to the East Indies Station, via Cape Horn, and reached Singapore on 25 September 1865, in time to participate in the search for CSS &quot;Shenandoah&quot;, a Confederate raider which remained at sea for one month after the end of the Civil War. Following service on the East Indies Station into 1866, the screw sloop-of-war was made part of the Asiatic Squadron with that unit&#x27;s establishment in 1867.

Sailing from Yokohama on 28 April 1867, &quot;Wyoming&quot; headed for the island of Formosa (Taiwan). On 13 June, she participated in a punitive expedition against Formosan natives who had murdered the crew of the American merchant bark &quot;Rover&quot; that had been wrecked off the coast of Formosa a short time before. During that action, she sent a landing party ashore in company with one from the sloop .

Subsequently, returning to the United States having performed her last service in the Far East, &quot;Wyoming&quot; was decommissioned on 10 February 1868 and placed &quot;in ordinary&quot; at Boston, Massachusetts. After extensive repairs at Portsmouth Navy Yard, during 1870 and into 1871, &quot;Wyoming&quot; was recommissioned on 14 November 1871, Comdr. John L. Davis in command.

===North Atlantic Station, 1872–1878===
From 1872 to 1874, &quot;Wyoming&quot; operated on the North Atlantic Station. Her ports of call included Havana, Cuba; Key West, Florida.; Aspinwall, Panama; Santiago, Cuba; Kingston, Jamaica; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Key West; Hampton Roads, Va.; and New Bedford, Mass. After that tour of duty, cruising and &quot;showing the flag&quot; in the West Indies and Gulf of Mexico, &quot;Wyoming&quot; was decommissioned at the Washington Navy Yard on 30 April 1874 and remained laid up there for the next two years.

In 1876, the Wyoming was deployed to the Potomac river in order to defend Washington DC at rumors of an invasion by Southern separatists after the controversial election between Rutherford B. Hayes and Samuel J. Tilden.

The veteran screw sloop-of-war became the receiving ship at Washington in 1877 and apparently served in that capacity into early the following year. Recommissioned on 20 November 1877, &quot;Wyoming&quot; left Washington, loaded articles for the Paris Exposition, and departed the East Coast of the United States on 6 April 1878, bound for France. After discharging the cargo at Le Havre, France, the ship visited Rouen, France, and Southampton, England, before she departed the latter port on 25 June and headed for the United States. She reached Norfolk on 22 August, shifted to Washington in mid-September, and to New York in early November, before she sailed on 26 November for the European Station.

===European Station, 1878–1881===
&quot;Wyoming&quot; reached Villefranche, France, near the port of Nice, on Christmas Eve 1878 and remained there into 1879 before getting underway for Smyrna on 24 January 1879. &quot;Wyoming&quot; remained in the Mediterranean into November 1880, touching at many of the more famous ports in that historic body of water — and in the Black Sea — before heading home late in 1880.

&quot;Wyoming&quot; returned to the United States in early 1881, arriving at Hampton Roads on 21 May. She sailed for Beaufort, S.C., on 15 June and thence proceeded to Annapolis, Md.

===Naval Academy, 1882–1892===
Decommissioned on 30 October 1882 and turned over to the Superintendent of the Naval Academy, &quot;Wyoming&quot; spent the next decade employed as a practice ship for midshipmen. Later taken to Norfolk, Va., she was sold at the port on 9 May 1892 to E. J. Butler, of Arlington, Massachusetts.

<text>Eintracht Frankfurt e.V. () is a German professional sports club based in Frankfurt, Hesse. It is best known for its football club, which was founded on 8 March 1899. The club currently plays in the Bundesliga, the top tier of the German football league system. Eintracht have won the German championship once, the DFB-Pokal five times, the UEFA Europa League twice and finished as runner-up in the European Cup once. The team was one of the founding members of the Bundesliga at its inception and has spent a total of 55 seasons in the top division, thus making them the seventh longest participating club in the highest tier of the league.

The club has 150,000 members, and thus is the third largest club on this level in Germany.

Since 1925 their stadium has been the Waldstadion, which is currently named Deutsche Bank Park for sponsorship reasons.

Eintracht Frankfurt have either won or drawn more than three-quarters of their games as well as having finished the majority of their seasons placed in the top half of the table, but also having the highest number of losses in the league (657). With an average attendance of 47,942 since 2013 the team also has one of the highest attendance ratings in the world and the eighth highest out of the 36 Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga teams. The player with the highest number of appearances (602) in the Bundesliga, Charly Körbel, spent his entire senior career as a defender for Eintracht Frankfurt. The club&#x27;s primary rival is local club Kickers Offenbach, although, due to spending most of their history in different divisions, the two have only played two league matches within the last 40 years.

With almost 14,000 active athletes in over 50 sports in 2024, Eintracht Frankfurt is the largest multi-sports club in the world with a professional football team.

==History==
===Club origins===

The origins of the club go back to a pair of football clubs founded in 1899: &quot;Frankfurter Fußball-Club Victoria von 1899&quot; – regarded as the original team in the club&#x27;s history – and &quot;Frankfurter Fußball-Club Kickers von 1899&quot;. Both clubs were founding members of the new Nordkreis-Liga in 1909. These two teams merged in May 1911 to become &quot;Frankfurter Fußball Verein (Kickers-Victoria)&quot;, an instant success, taking three league titles from 1912 to 1914 in the Nordkreis-Liga and qualifying for the Southern German championship in each of those seasons. In turn, &quot;Frankfurter FV&quot; joined the gymnastics club &quot;Frankfurter Turngemeinde von 1861&quot; to form &quot;TuS Eintracht Frankfurt von 1861&quot; in 1920. The German word &quot;Eintracht&quot; means &#x27;harmony&#x27; or &#x27;concord&#x27;, and so &quot;Eintracht&quot; is the equivalent of &quot;United&quot; in English in the names of sports teams.
At the time, sports in Germany was dominated by nationalistic gymnastics organizations, and under pressure from that sport&#x27;s governing authority, the gymnasts and footballers went their separate ways again in 1927, as &quot;Turngemeinde Eintracht Frankfurt von 1861&quot; and &quot;Sportgemeinde Eintracht Frankfurt (FFV) von 1899&quot;.
Through the late 1920s and into the 1930s, Eintracht won a handful of local and regional championships, first in the Kreisliga Nordmain, then in the Bezirksliga Main and Bezirksliga Main-Hessen. After being eliminated from the national level playoffs after quarterfinal losses in 1930 and 1931, they won their way to the final in 1932 where they were beaten 2–0 by Bayern Munich, who claimed their first ever German championship. In 1933, German football was re-organized into sixteen Gauligen under the Third Reich, and the club played first division football in the Gauliga Südwest, consistently finishing in the upper half of the table and winning their division in 1938.

Eintracht picked up where they left off after World War II, joining the new first division Oberliga Süd. In 1946, Eintracht won the first Hessenpokal, and finished third in the Oberliga Süd a year later. In 1953, they would win the Oberliga Süd title, qualifying Eintracht for the German championship, though they did not make it to the final.

=== National champions and European Cup finalists ===
Former coach Paul Oßwald returned to the club for third stint with Eintracht in 1958. In the 195859 season the club won their Oberliga again, qualifying for the 1959 German championship. Winning all six of the games in the group phase, Eintracht made it to the final with a perfect record; there, they would meet rivals Kickers Offenbach, the club that Oßwald joined from, and the runners up behind Eintracht in the Oberliga Süd. Frankfurt went on to win the final 53 after extra time, becoming German champions for the first and so far only time in front of 75,000 fans in Berlin&#x27;s Olympiastadion.

As champions, Frankfurt would represent Germany in the 1959–60 European Cup, where they would come to international prominence. Having beaten BSC Young Boys and Wiener Sport-Club to make it to the semi-finals, they were drawn against Scottish champions Rangers, who were considered favourites, at least in Scotland – Rangers manager Scot Symon allegedly asked, &quot;Eintracht, who are they?&quot; before the game. Eintracht won the first leg 61 at home, in a performance described as the greatest in the club&#x27;s history. They would score six more in the second leg at Ibrox, winning 124 on aggregate. After the game, the Rangers players gave their opponents a guard of honour as they left the pitch.

Eintracht would return to Glasgow for the final at Hampden Park, although they lost 7–3 to Real Madrid despite taking an early lead. The final was widely regarded as one of the best football matches ever played, remembered for a hat-trick by Alfredo Di Stéfano and four goals by Ferenc Puskás.

After their championship-winning year, Eintracht did not win the Oberliga again, though they were runners-up in 1961 and 1962. Both times they would finish second in the group phase of the German championship, missing out on the final.

===Founding member of the Bundesliga===
The side earned themselves a place as one of the original 16 teams selected to play in the Bundesliga, Germany&#x27;s new professional football league, formed in 1963. Eintracht played Bundesliga football for 33 consecutive seasons, finishing in the top half of the table for the majority of them. In the inaugural season, Eintracht finished 3rd behind 1. FC Köln and Meidericher SV – the club has still never managed a better Bundesliga finish – and also reached the 1964 DFB-Pokal Final.

Eintracht finished in the top half of the Bundesliga every season until 1970–71. Although they didn&#x27;t make it back to the European Cup, Eintracht did play in other non-UEFA European competitions, beating FK Inter Bratislava to win the 1967 Intertoto Cup in the last season of its original format. That year, they also reached the semi-final of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, losing to Dinamo Zagreb.

===Cup successes===

From 1973 to 1981, Eintracht had arguably their most successful period of the Bundesliga era, winning three DFB-Pokals and the UEFA Cup. Many of the most iconic players from the club&#x27;s history played during this era, such as Bernd Nickel, Charly Körbel, Bernd Hölzenbein, Jürgen Grabowski and Cha Bum-kun.

The first title success came under Dietrich Weise in the 1973–74 DFB-Pokal, winning 31 in the final over Hamburger SV – due to the 1974 FIFA World Cup, which Hölzenbein and Grabowski had won with West Germany, the final was not played until August 1974.

Eintracht would win the cup again in 1975, beating MSV Duisburg 10. That season, they played in the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup for the first time, and in the 1975–76 campaign, they would go far, reaching the semi-finals. Despite beating West Ham 2–1 at home, Eintracht were beaten 31 in the second leg and were knocked out, while also finishing a relatively low ninth place in the Bundesliga. The club then had a difficult start to the 1976–77 season, but under new coach Gyula Lóránt, appointed in November, Eintracht went unbeaten in the second half of the season. Lóránt, notable for introducing zonal marking to the Bundesliga, took Frankfurt into fourth place by the end of the season, finishing only two points behind champions Borussia Mönchengladbach. Soon, however, Lóránt would leave for Bayern Munich, with Dettmar Cramer coming the other way to coach Frankfurt. Cramer left at the end of the disappointing 1977–78 season, replaced by Otto Knefler, who soon had to leave on health grounds.

In January 1979, Friedel Rausch joined the club as head coach. This was one of two important arrivals in 1979, as Cha Bum-kun would sign for Eintracht in July, becoming the first Korean to play in Europe. He would quickly become an icon in Frankfurt, scoring 12 league goals in his debut season. Eliminating Aberdeen, Dinamo București, Feyenoord and FC Zbrojovka Brno in the earlier rounds of the UEFA Cup, Eintracht reached the semi-finals, at which point only West German teams remained. Drawn against Bayern Munich, they won 5–1 in extra time to earn a place in the final.

Eintracht lost 3–2 in the first leg of the final to Borussia Mönchengladbach, the reigning champions. The two away goals, scored by Harald Karger and Hölzenbein, would prove crucial. Two weeks later, they hosted the return leg. With the score still at 0–0, Friedel Rausch sent on teenager Fred Schaub with 13 minutes to play. Almost immediately, Schaub scored what proved to be only goal of the game, winning Eintracht the title on away goals.

As Lothar Buchmann succeeded Rausch, Eintracht won their third DFB-Pokal in 1981. This effectively marked the end of Eintracht&#x27;s golden period, as they began their battle with relegation.

===Mid-80s struggles and 1988 DFB-Pokal===
In 1984, they defeated MSV Duisburg 6–1 on aggregate in the relegation playoff after finishing 16th; in 1986 and 1987, they would finish 15th.

After years as a bottom-half club in the Bundesliga, Eintracht had a successful 1987–88 season, finishing in the top half of the league for the first time since 1982. More importantly, they won the 1987–88 DFB-Pokal, with a 1–0 win over VfL Bochum in the 1988 final. The goalscorer was Hungarian Lajos Détári, who became a hero among the club&#x27;s fans. Only two days after the final, Détári was sold to Olympiacos for a large fee, helping to pay the club&#x27;s debts.

In 1988–89 Eintracht found themselves in the relegation fight again. Jörg Berger was appointed coach and led the side to safety with a 4–1 aggregate win over 1. FC Saarbrücken in the relegation playoff.

=== Title challenges in the early 90s and first relegation ===
A year later, Berger had taken the club to 3rd place, and was recognised as the best coach in the league. Berger left in 1991 after a 4th-place finish, but the squad now included players considered among the Bundesliga&#x27;s best, such as Uwe Bein, Uli Stein, Jørn Andersen, Manfred Binz, Tony Yeboah and Andreas Möller.

Dragoslav Stepanović took over as coach when Berger left, and Eintracht would finish 3rd in both seasons he coached, although he left before the end of 1992–93. Under Stepanović, Eintracht played what was considered some of the best football in Bundesliga history, making &#x27;Stepi&#x27; a fan favourite to this day. In 1991–92, the club came closer than ever before to winning the Bundesliga. Going into the last game of the season, Eintracht were top of the table and only needed a win against already-relegated Hansa Rostock. With the scores level at 1–1 Eintracht were denied what seemed a clear penalty, they would go on to lose 2–1. Referee Alfons Berg later apologised for his decision, but VfB Stuttgart became champions. Eintracht also came close in 1993–94, under Klaus Toppmöller, leading the table at the halway point; however, they fell to 5th place and Toppmöller was sacked.

In the summer of 1994, Jupp Heynckes was appointed coach. Things quickly began to turn sour, as Heynckes fell out with key players Tony Yeboah, Maurizio Gaudino and Jay-Jay Okocha. The club suspended all three players; Yeboah and Gaudino soon left. With the club in 13th, Heynckes decided to leave. For his role in breaking up the successful side of the early 90s, Heynckes is still disliked by many fans in Frankfurt.

Relegation would come in 1995–96, with neither club legend Charly Körbel or the previously successful Dragoslav Stepanovic able to rescue Eintracht. After 33 consecutive years in the Bundesliga, Frankfurt went down alongside 1. FC Kaiserslautern, who had also been ever-present until 1996.

===Turbulent years===
After a tumultuous debut campaign in the 2. Bundesliga, Eintracht won the title in 1997–98 and returned to the Bundesliga. Promotion coach Horst Ehrmantraut left in December, and Jörg Berger returned to try to save Eintracht once more. On the final day of the 1998–99 season, Eintracht were expected to be relegated, but dramatically climbed out of the relegation zone on goal difference thanks to a late goal from Jan Åge Fjørtoft giving them a 5–1 win over Kaiserslautern.

The following year, in another struggle to avoid relegation, the club was docked two points for violating the conditions of their license. Eintracht secured survival on the last day of the season with a win over SSV Ulm, who were relegated instead. Eintracht would go down the season afterwards with Friedel Rausch in charge, and did not come close to promotion in 2001–02.

Eintracht secured a Bundesliga return on the final day of the 2002–03 season with a 6–3 win over Reutlingen, dramatically scoring 3 in the last 10 minutes of the game. They were then relegated straight back to the 2. Bundesliga, but were promoted again the season after, managed by Friedhelm Funkel. Funkel led the team to safety in 2005–06 and also took Eintracht to the DFB-Pokal final for the first time since 1988, where they lost to Bayern Munich. As Bayern had already qualified for Europe, this also meant that Eintracht qualified for the UEFA Cup. After years of stability under Funkel, Michael Skibbe replaced him in 2009.

The 2010–11 season ended with the club&#x27;s fourth Bundesliga relegation. After setting a new record for most points in the first half of the season, the club struggled after the winter break, going seven games without scoring a goal. Coach Skibbe was replaced with Christoph Daum, but Eintracht went down again after winning just once in the second half of the season.

One year later, Eintracht defeated Alemannia Aachen 3–0 on the 32nd matchday of the 2011–12 season, securing promotion to the Bundesliga. This was followed up by a 6th-place finish in the Bundesliga in 2012–13, qualifying Frankfurt for the Europa League.

===DFB Pokal and Europa League winners, Participation in European Competitions===

Having finished in the top half in 2014–15, a season in which Eintracht&#x27;s Alexander Meier was the league&#x27;s top scorer, the team struggled again in 2015–16 and Niko Kovač was appointed coach in March 2016. Frankfurt survived only through the relegation playoff; ending the season in 16th place, they beat 1. FC Nürnberg 2–1 on aggregate in the playoff. In Kovač&#x27;s first full year, his team survived comfortably and also reached the final of the 2017 DFB-Pokal, where they were beaten by Borussia Dortmund.

Eintracht reached their second DFB-Pokal final in a row in 2017–18, this time winning 3–1 against heavy favourites Bayern Munich – who Kovač had already agreed to join from next season. He was replaced by Adi Hütter.

In 2018–19, Eintracht&#x27;s attacking trio of Luka Jović, Ante Rebić and Sébastien Haller won lots of praise for their outstanding performances, scoring 41 league goals and 16 Europa League goals between them and earning the nickname &quot;the Buffalo Herd&quot;. Making only their second appearance in the modern Europa League, Eintracht won all six group games against Lazio, Apollon Limassol and Marseille, and beat highly rated opponents Shakhtar Donetsk, Inter Milan and Benfica. In the semi-finals against Chelsea, Eintracht drew both legs 1–1 but ended up losing on penalties at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea would go on to win the tournament. Eintracht also missed out on Champions League qualification in the Bundesliga, dropping from 4th to 7th after losing their last two games.

With Jović, Rebić and Haller all leaving in the summer of 2019, Eintracht regressed in 2019–20 and failed to qualify for Europe, but returned to the Europa League with a 5th-place finish in 2020–21, after which Adi Hütter left for Borussia Mönchengladbach. In the 2021–22 Europa League, Eintracht topped their group and stunned Barcelona in the quarter finals, taking a 3–0 lead at the Camp Nou and eventually winning 3–2 with approximately 30,000 travelling Frankfurt fans in attendance. Eintracht went on to beat West Ham home and away in the semi-finals to set up their first European final since 1980.

In the final in Seville&#x27;s Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium, Frankfurt beat Rangers 5–4 on penalties after a 1–1 draw in extra-time, with Rafael Santos Borré scoring Eintracht&#x27;s goal and the winning penalty. Goalkeeper Kevin Trapp was named man of the match in the final after making a crucial late save from Ryan Kent and saving Aaron Ramsey&#x27;s penalty in the shootout. Eintracht won the competition unbeaten; their success also qualified them for the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League, Eintracht&#x27;s first appearance in the competition since 1960. Eintracht finished second in their Champions League group, qualifying for the knockout stages, but lost in the round of 16 against S.S.C. Napoli. The team was more successful in the 2022–23 DFB-Pokal, reaching the final on 3 June 2023, where they lost 2–0 against RB Leipzig.
A 7th-place finish at the end of 2022–23 season secured qualification for the UEFA Europa Conference League.

Since November 2024, the executive board consists of Axel Hellmann (CEO), Markus Krösche (head of sports) and Julien Zamberk (head of finances) and Philipp Reschke (head of fan relations, merchandising and HR).

==Colours, crest and nicknames==
The club crest derives from the coat of arms of the city of Frankfurt, which itself is a reference to the one-headed Imperial Eagle of the 13th century.

The crest has evolved showing little significant change until 1980, when a stylized eagle in black and white was chosen to represent the team. In Eintracht&#x27;s centenary year of 1999, the club decided to re-adopt a more traditional eagle crest. Since 2005, Eintracht has had a living mascot, a golden eagle named &quot;Attila&quot; from the nearby Hanau Zoo, who has currently been present at over 200 different games.
The official club colours of red, black, and white have their origins in the colours of the founding clubs &quot;Frankfurter FC Viktoria&quot; and &quot;Frankfurter FC Kickers&quot;, which sported red and white and black and white respectively. Red and white are the colours of the city coat of arms, and black and white the colours of Prussia. When the clubs merged, officials decided to adopt the colours of both sides. Since local rival &quot;Kickers Offenbach&quot; sport the colours red and white, &quot;Eintracht&quot; avoids playing in such a kit, preferring to play in black and red, or in black and white. In the 2023–2024 season, the home kit is black and red.

In the 2021–22 UEFA Europa League, the Eagles played an unbeaten campaign, mostly sporting an all-white kit that gained them the nickname &quot;la bestia blanca&quot; (literally &quot;the white beast&quot; in Spanish), a wordplay on the Spanish term &quot;la bestia negra&quot; (literally &quot;the black beast&quot;, also meaning &quot;bogey team&quot; in Spanish). This nickname was received after Eintracht knocked FC Barcelona out of the competition at Camp Nou.
The club is nicknamed &quot;Die Adler&quot; (&quot;The Eagles&quot;), which derives from their logo. A nickname still popular among supporters is &quot;SGE&quot;, taken from the club&#x27;s old official name &quot;Sportgemeinde Eintracht&quot; (Frankfurt), which roughly translates into English as &quot;Sports Community Harmony.&quot;

The nickname &quot;Launische Diva&quot; (&quot;Moody Diva&quot;) was heard most often in the early 1990s, when the club would comfortably defeat top teams only to surprisingly lose to lesser clubs.

The nickname &quot;Schlappekicker&quot; (&quot;Slipper Kickers&quot;) has been around since the 1920s, when &quot;J. &amp; C. A. Schneider&quot;, a local manufacturer of shoes and especially slippers (called &quot;Schlappe&quot; in the regional Hessian dialect) was a major financial backer of the club and helped propel it to national relevance.

==Stadium==

The club&#x27;s initial games from 1899 to 1906 were played on the former &quot;Hundswiese&quot; field, whose present day location would be near Hessischer Rundfunk. Following new regulations that pitches needed to be surrounded by a fence for the purpose of official games, the team established a new pitch by the Eschersheimer Landstraße called &quot;Victoriaplatz&quot; in 1906, for which they purchased stands at a price of 350 marks in 1908. From 1912 the team moved to a new ground at Roseggerstraße in Dornbusch with more facilities, before relocating to the former Riederwaldstadion in 1920 following the fusion of &quot;Frankfurter FV&quot; and &quot;Frankfurter Turngemeinde von 1861.&quot;

The ground was inaugurated as Waldstadion (&quot;Forest Stadium&quot;) in 1925 with the German championship final match between FSV Frankfurt vs. 1. FC Nürnberg.

The facility was renovated for the FIFA World Cup 2006 in Germany. , for Bundesliga fixtures the maximum capacity is 58,000.

Though the media usually refer to the ground by the official name, Deutsche Bank Park, Eintracht fans faithful typically use the original name, Waldstadion.

==Reserve team==

Eintracht Frankfurt U21 is the reserve team of Eintracht Frankfurt. The team played as U23 (Under 23) to emphasize the character of the team as a link between the youth academy and professional team. The club board decided to dissolve the team after the 2013–14 season while playing in the regular league system in the fourth tier, the Regionalliga Süd. 
On 14 February 2022, Eintracht Frankfurt applied to have a reserves team to be re-admitted to the 5th tier Hessenliga for the 2022–23 season.
In the first season after being re-admitted, Frankfurt II won the Hessenliga and got promoted to the Regionalliga Südwest, where they play now.

==Rivalries and friendships==
The club&#x27;s main rival is from across the Main river, the side Kickers Offenbach. The clubs played the 1959 German championship final, which Eintracht won.

Eintracht also maintain rivalries with Darmstadt 98 regionally, known as the &quot;Hesse derby&quot;, as well with 1. FSV Mainz 05 and 1. FC Kaiserslautern in Rhineland-Palatinate.

The club&#x27;s original rival was Frankfurt city-rival FSV Frankfurt. In both clubs&#x27; early years, there used to be a fierce rivalry, but after World War II Eintracht proved to be the stronger club and the ways parted and the rivalry deteriorated due to lack of contact. Nowadays, the fan relations tend to be friendly. 
The 2011–12 season saw Eintracht play FSV in a league match for the first time in almost 50 years. The last league game between the two had been played on 27 January 1962, then in the Oberliga Süd. For the first of the two matches, FSV&#x27;s home game on 21 August 2011, the decision was made to move to Eintracht&#x27;s stadium as FSV&#x27;s Bornheimer Hang only holds less than 11,000 spectators. Eintracht won 4–0. The second match on 18 February 2012 ended in another victory for Eintracht, a 6–1 rout.

A friendship between two Eintracht fan clubs and supporters of English club Oldham Athletic has lasted for over 30 years after fans from each club met at an international football tournament. Small sections of each club&#x27;s support will pay a visit to the other&#x27;s ground at least once a season. Eintracht supporters also have an international friendship with supporters of Italian club Atalanta.

<text>Alan Stevenson (28 April 1807 – 23 December 1865) was a Scottish civil engineer, known for designing and building lighthouses in and around Scotland.

==Life==

Alan Stevenson was born in Edinburgh on 28 April 1807, the eldest son of Jean Smith and her husband (and step-brother) Robert Stevenson. With his father, and brothers David and Thomas, he was part of the notable family of Engineers and lighthouse builders. The writer Robert Louis Stevenson was his nephew.

He was educated at the High School in Edinburgh. In 1821, he attended the University of Edinburgh to study Latin, Greek and mathematics with a view to becoming a member of the clergy. However, 2 years later in 1823, he decided to pursue a career in engineering and began a four-year apprenticeship at his father&#x27;s business.

Between 1843 and 1853 he built 13 lighthouses in and around Scotland. Among his notable works is the Skerryvore Lighthouse.

He was Engineer in Chief to the Northern Lighthouse Board from 1843 to 1853.

In 1838 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being James David Forbes. In 1840 the University of Glasgow conferred on him an honorary LLB degree.

He died at 13 Pitt Street (later renamed Pittville St) in Portobello on 23 December 1865.

He is buried in the Stevenson family vault in New Calton Cemetery with his wife, Margaret Scott Jones. The vault lies midway along the eastern wall.

<text>Cathkin Park is a municipal park in Glasgow, Scotland. The park is maintained by the city&#x27;s parks department, and it is a public place where football is still played. The park contains the site of the second Hampden Park, previously home to the football clubs Queen&#x27;s Park (from 1884 to 1903) and Third Lanark (from 1903 to 1967). The site of the original Hampden Park is just to the west.

==Football ground==
The park formerly contained a football stadium, which had played host to organised football since 1884. It was originally known as Hampden Park (the second by that name, succeeding the original Hampden Park) and was rented by Queen&#x27;s Park between 1884 and 1903; the first match was on 18 October 1884, a goalless draw against Dumbarton watched by 7,000. As Hampden Park, the ground hosted seven Scottish Cup finals (plus two replays) between 1885 and 1899, as well as several finals of the Glasgow Cup and Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup, the &#x27;unofficial World Championship&#x27; club challenge match in 1888, and nine Scotland international fixtures between 1885 and 1890. A single rugby union international (which usually took place in Edinburgh) was played there: Scotland defeated England in the 1896 Home Nations Championship in front of 20,000 spectators. 

When Queen&#x27;s Park decided to build their own stadium and moved to the third (and current) Hampden Park on open ground about further south, Third Lanark took over the lease. They renamed it New Cathkin Park as they had previously played at another stadium named Cathkin Park just to the east of Dixon Halls on the east side of Cathcart Road, about north of their new home. Third Lanark failed to agree a fee with Queen&#x27;s Park for the pavilion and other fittings (which they owned, while the ground itself was leased), resulting in the departing club removing the existing structures for use at their new stadium and the new occupiers having to rebuild virtually from scratch. During the first season following the move (1903–04, in which they finished as champions), Third Lanark played several of their home matches at the new Hampden while work was carried out on Cathkin Park. No major finals were played at this version of the ground, but it became the regular home of the Home Scots v Anglo-Scots international trial match which ran from the 1890s to the 1920s.

Third Lanark&#x27;s last match at Cathkin took place on 25 April 1967, when they played out a 3–3 draw against Queen of the South. Jimmy Davidson scored one goal for Queens and Brian McMurdo two, including the last senior football goal at the park (the Thirds goals came from Kinnaird with two goals and McLaughlan with the other). A Glasgow Challenge Cup Final was played at Cathkin on 13 May 1967 between two Junior sides, Cambuslang Rangers and Rutherglen Glencairn (Cambuslang winning 2–0); this was the final football match played at Cathkin before Third Lanark folded later that year. The final goal to be scored at Cathkin came from Cambuslang Rangers forward Peter Coleman after 17 minutes.

The stadium subsequently fell into disrepair and most of the fabric was gradually removed. The remains of the terraces from three sides of the ground can be seen in the park. However, a reformed Third Lanark team, which plays in the Greater Glasgow Amateur League, currently plays in the park, as do Hampden AFC and boys team the Jimmy Johnstone Academy.

In 2017, Third Lanark A.F.C. announced a £5 million plan to return to Cathkin and redevelop the ground, with an all-weather pitch, a 2000-seat stand, floodlights and community facilities for football and cricket. In the meantime, the latest of several projects to carry out basic renovations on the remaining terracing and barriers by volunteers, including actor Simon Weir, took place in early 2019.

The Jimmy Johnstone Academy leased the ground, and received planning permission in December 2023 to fence off the pitch, despite objections from local residents. However, in August 2024, a local resident won a judicial review of Glasgow City Council&#x27;s decision to grant the planning permission, with the decision deemed unlawful for failing to take account of the Land Reform (Scotland) 2003 Act, known as Scotland&#x27;s right to roam legislation.

==Athletics==
Hampden Park hosted the Scottish Amateur Athletics Association championships on a number of occasions, starting on Saturday 25 June 1887. E. Latimer Stones (Partick Thistle FC) broke the Scottish record for the pole vault with his winning height of 11 feet (3.35m), and the half mile was won by John Braid (Stanley House Cricket Club) who competed in the Olympic Games in 1900, playing cricket, for France. The championships returned to Hampden Park on Saturday 22 June 1889 when athletes from Clydesdale Harriers won both the 1 mile (Charles Pennycook 4:29 4/5) and 4 miles (John W. McWilliam 20:56 1/5) championships, with both men setting Championship Best performances. James Greig, from Perth, a student at Clare College, Cambridge, won the 120 yard hurdles (16 2/5) and the high jump (5ft 6in, 1.67m). Greig later became the vice-President of the Scottish AAA. E. Latimer Stones of Ulverston AC returned to defend his pole vault title and set new Scottish All-comers record figures of 11ft 4in (3.45m). This remained a Scottish All-comers record until 26 July 1924, and a Scottish Native record and Championship Best performance until 27 June 1931 when it was beaten by Patrick Ogilvie of Cambridge University at the other Hampden Park. On Thursday 2 April 1891 the Scottish 10 mile Championship was held at Hampden Park. Andrew Hannah of Clydesdale Harriers won the event for the third successive year, and set Scottish All-comers records at 5 miles (26:35 3/5), 6 miles (32:11 2/5), 7 miles (37:41 4/5), 8 miles (43:13 3/5), 9 miles (48:48 1/5), and 10 miles (54:18 3/5). The only other finisher was William Carment (Edinburgh H.) in 58:12 4/5. Hannah would eventually win this title a record seven times between 1889 and 1896. On Saturday 20 June 1891 the Scottish Amateur Athletics Championships returned to Hampden Park when David Duncan, a former pupil of Royal High School in Edinburgh and a former President of the Scottish AAA won the 1 mile for the fifth time representing Edinburgh Harriers. Duncan won the 1 mile at the first four Championships from 1883 to 1886.

There had for a number of years been a disagreement in Scottish athletics over whether professional cycle racing events should be allowed at amateur athletics meetings. There were strong views both in favour and against the position, and arriving at a deadlock in their negotiations several western district clubs in favour of allowing professional cycle events, led by Clydesdale Harriers, seceded from the Scottish AAA and formed the Scottish Amateur Athletics Union (SAAU). The consequence of this was that there were two national championships in both 1895 and 1896 held under the auspices of the two separate bodies. In 1895 they were both held on the same day in the same city, at the grounds of opposing football clubs, and if attendance is anything to go by the Scottish public made their feeling on the topic abundantly clear. Over 6,000 fans attended the breakaway SAAU championships at Hampden Park where Robert Langlands of Clydesdale Harriers became the first Scottish athlete to break two minutes for 880 yards, whilst barely 1000 spectators saw Mrs McNab, the wife of the Hon. Secretary SAAA, present the prizes at Ibrox Park where Alfred Downer (Scottish Pelicans) won the 100 yards, 220 yards, and 440 yards titles for the third consecutive year.

On Saturday, 27 June 1896 the Scottish AAU Championships returned to Hampden Park when two men from Clydesdale Harriers set Scottish Native records in winning their events. William Robertson won the mile in 4:27 1/5 and Stewart Duffus won the 4 miles in 20:10 4/5.

<text>Austro-Daimler was an Austrian car manufacturer from 1899 until 1934. It was a subsidiary of the German &quot;Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft&quot; (DMG) until 1909.

==History==
In 1890, Eduard Bierenz was appointed as Austrian retailer. The company sold so well that it also began manufacturing the automobiles after uniting with Eduard Fischer&#x27;s engineering factory. The works were located at Wiener-Neustadt. By this subsidiary &quot;DMG&quot; became the first automotive multinational in history.

Thus, on 11 August 1899, the Austrian Daimler Engine Society was founded. Whilst the assembling parts stemmed from Stuttgart, in 1900 they built their first automobile which featured 2 cylinders, , and 4 seats. Soon they started producing engines for luxurious cars, trucks, buses, maritime ships, and trains.

===Paul Daimler era===
In 1902, Paul Daimler, Gottlieb Daimler&#x27;s son, took charge of the Technical Department. He developed a compact car (8 hp, 45 km/h). In 1905 he built the company&#x27;s first armoured car, which had . Also, the company produced engines for both trucks and buses. However, Daimler returned to Stuttgart in 1905 to take over the research and development department, which had been vacated by Maybach.

===Ferdinand Porsche era===
Senior Ferdinand Porsche took Daimler&#x27;s place as technical designer. Although Austro-Daimler cars were competing at races already, Porsche pioneered aerodynamic usage with two famous racecars (&quot;Mixte&quot; and &quot;Maya&quot;). Also, he designed the Mercédès-Electrique-Mixte which was manufactured from 1902 until 1907.

Porsche also impelled a company reformation, at a time when the company had 800 workers. The company was renamed &#x27;Austro-Daimler&#x27; on 27 July 1906. That year Emil Jellinek — who was Austrian too — bought several Austro-Daimler licenses to found ancillary companies abroad.

In 1908, the Austro-Daimler began producing &quot;Zeppelin&quot; engines. Indeed, for Porsche this was a personal interest since he liked to take Archduke Franz Ferdinand flying over Vienna.

Pushing the company&#x27;s development further, Porsche granted Austro-Daimler&#x27;s definitive independence from DMG&#x27;s ownership in 1909. In 1910, the company was renamed &quot;Oesterreichische Daimler Motoren AG&quot; (Austrian Daimler Engines AG) whose logo was the &quot;Austrian Royal double-headed eagle&quot;. In 1912 DMG sold its remaining shares.

In 1911 Austro-Daimler began producing the &quot;Prinz Heinrich&quot; (in English: &quot;Prince Henry&quot;) model; this car, which featured an overhead cam 5,714-cc four-cylinder engine, quickly became famous. It could develop 95 bhp at 2,100 rpm; there was also a less potent version with side valves and a 6,900-cc engine capable of developing at only 1,200 rpm. Both designs were by Porsche.

===WW I===

During the First World War, the 4,500 workers of Austro-Daimler contributed in large quantities to wartime production. They played a key role in the 1918 Austro-Hungarian January Strike in which workers inspired by the Bolshevik seizure of power took strike action to oppose the war. A key factor in the strike was the halving of the flour ration. Porsche met the workers and agreed to drive to Vienna to speak to the Minister of Food. However, his plea to the workers to return to work was ignored and they marched on the Town Hall. Here they were joined by other workers from the locomotive factory, the radiator works, the aircraft factory and local ammunition plants of G. Rath and the Lichtenwörther. The assembly soon numbered over 10,000 and the Stadtholder phoned the Volksernährungsamt - the state organisation managing food supply. However, the minister, General Anton Höfer only promised to meet a delegation of the workers. The strike spread across the empire and involved over 700,000 workers.

===1920–1930s===

After the war, the company returned to the production of automobiles. Austro-Daimler still claimed Royal patronage via its connection with Prince Heinrich.

Soon, the company began collapsing. In the first place, Austro-Daimler fused with several companies — Skoda, Fiat, and Puch (1928). Then, it was submerged under Camillo Castiglioni&#x27;s squandering management.

At this time, Porsche created the 1.3-liter &quot;Sascha&quot; racing cars (named after their backer, Count Sascha Kolowrat-Krakowski) in the early 1920s. The smallest model the company offered was a 2,212-cc four-cylinder. However, as the economic situation worsened, Porsche abandoned the company in 1923, ridding himself of Austro-Daimler&#x27;s financial difficulties. Instead, he moved to Stuttgart&#x27;s DMG.
The outstanding production car offered by Austro-Daimler during the 1930s was the ADM, which featured overhead cam six-cylinder engines of 2,540 cc, 2,650 cc, and 2,994 cc. The last-named (the ADM III) developed at 4,000 rpm and was one of the greatest automobiles of the decade. Also offered was a less luxurious sporting version, the &quot;ADR&quot;.

1931 saw Austro-Daimler introduce a 4,624-cc eight-cylinder car, a superb, highly expensive luxury vehicle. The last great car built at the Austrian works was the six-cylinder &quot;Bergmeister&quot;, which featured an overhead cam 3,614-cc engine that could develop at 3,600 rpm; this car had a top speed of . In 1934 the company merged with Steyr Automobile, creating the Steyr-Daimler-Puch conglomerate. However, in this same year, Austro-Daimler was dissolved.

===Postwar era===
In the 1970s and into the 1980s bicycles were made by Steyr-Daimler-Puch with some models bearing the Puch trademark, and more upscale models bearing the Austro-Daimler trademark. When the bicycle manufacturing aspects of the consortium were sold in 1987 to Piaggio &amp; C. S.p.A. of Italy, the Puch trademark was conveyed. The rights to the name Austro-Daimler, however, were not sold. Since then, no bicycles have been made bearing this trademark.

=== 21st Century ===

In 2019, a new Austro Daimler was shown at the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este. Named the Bergmeister ADR 630 Shooting Grand, the car featured a 3 litre turbocharged six-cylinder engine from the Mercedes-AMG GT 4-Door Coupe, paired with three electric motors, producing a total of 1,182 horsepower. The car was inspired by the 1931 Austro-Daimler Bergmeister. Project manager Roland Stagl planned to produce a series of vehicles following the Bergmeister&#x27;s UK debut at Salon Privé, however, production is yet to commence.

<text>Earl Silas Tupper (July 28, 1907 – October 3, 1983) was an American businessman and inventor, best known as the inventor of Tupperware, an airtight plastic container for storing food, and for founding the related home products company that bears his name, Tupperware Plastics Company.

==Early life and career==
Tupper was born on a farm in Berlin, New Hampshire. The Tupper family moved from Berlin, New Hampshire when he was three years old, spending the rest of his youth growing up on different farms in central Massachusetts.

After studying at Bryant College (now Bryant University) in Providence, Rhode Island, he began a landscaping and nursery business until the Great Depression forced the business into bankruptcy. He then got a job with the DuPont chemical company.

==Creation of Tupperware==

Using black, inflexible pieces of polyethylene slag, a waste product of the oil refining process given to him by his supervisor at DuPont, Tupper purified the slag and molded it to create lightweight, non-breakable containers, cups, bowls, plates, and even gas masks that were used in World War II. He later designed liquid-proof, airtight lids, inspired by the secure seal of paint can lids.

==Business==
Tupper founded the Tupperware Plastics Company in 1938 and in 1948, the company introduced Tupper Plastics to hardware and department stores. Around 1946, he joined forces with Brownie Wise, who caught his attention after she made a lengthy phone call to his office in South Grafton, Massachusetts, during which she explained her extraordinary success selling Tupperware via home parties.

Based on a marketing strategy developed by Wise and early pioneers Tom and Ann Damigella from Everett, Massachusetts, Tupperware was withdrawn from sale in retail stores in the early 1950s and Tupperware &quot;parties&quot; soon became popular in homes. This was the first instance of what became known as &quot;party plan&quot; marketing.

The corporate headquarters was moved from Massachusetts to Orlando, Florida. After his falling-out with Wise that resulted in her dismissal in 1958, Tupper sold The Tupperware Company for $16 million to Rexall. Shortly afterward, he divorced his wife, gave up his U.S. citizenship to avoid taxes, and bought an island just off the coast of Costa Rica or according to other sources Isla San José

==Philanthropy==
In 1969, Tupper donated 428 acres of land in Smithfield, Rhode Island, to his alma mater, Bryant College (now named Bryant University). The land was developed into the college&#x27;s new campus, which opened in 1971. The campus in Providence where Tupper had once studied was sold to Brown University.

==Death==
Tupper died in Costa Rica on October 3, 1983, at the age of 76.

<text>A depositary receipt (DR) is a negotiable financial instrument issued by a bank to represent a foreign company&#x27;s publicly traded securities. The depositary receipt trades on a local stock exchange. Depositary receipts facilitates buying shares in foreign companies, because the shares do not have to leave the home country.

Depositary receipts that are listed and traded in the United States are American depositary receipts (ADRs). European banks issue European depositary receipts (EDRs), and other banks issue global depository receipts (GDRs).

== How it works ==

A depositary receipt typically requires a company to meet a stock exchange’s specific rules before listing its stock for sale. For example, a company must transfer shares to a brokerage house in its home country. Upon receipt, the brokerage uses a custodian connected to the international stock exchange for selling the depositary receipts. This connection ensures that the shares of stock actually exist and no manipulation occurs between the foreign company and the international brokerage house.

A typical ADR goes through the following steps before it is issued:
* The issuing bank in the U.S. studies the financials of the foreign company in detail to assess the strength of its stock.
* The bank buys shares of the foreign company.
* The shares are grouped into packets.
* Each packet is issued as an ADR through an American stock exchange.
* The ADR is priced in dollars, and the dividends are paid out in dollars as well, making it as simple for an American investor to buy as the stock of a U.S.-based company.

== Other forms of multi-exchange trading ==
DRs should not be confused with other methods that allow a company&#x27;s stock to be traded in multiple exchanges, such as:

* Cross-listing, where a firm lists its equity shares on one or more foreign stock exchange in addition to its domestic exchange. In this case, the two stocks are technically identical and convey the same rights. To be cross-listed, a company must thus comply with the requirements of all the stock exchanges in which it is listed, such as filing.
* Dual listed companies, where two distinct companies (with separate stocks listed on different exchanges) function as one company.
* &quot;Admitted for trading,&quot; where a foreign share is accessible in a different market through an exchange convention and not actually registered within that different market.

== Types of DR ==

* American depositary receipt
* European depositary receipt
* Global Depositary Receipt
* Indian Depository Receipt

Additionally, CREST Depositary Interests (CDIs) in the United Kingdom function similarly, but not identically to depositary receipts.

<doc id="862177" wikidata="Q7318766" url="?curid=862177" title="Revolutionary Communist Party of India">
<text>The Revolutionary Communist Party of India ( RCPI) is a political party in India. The party was founded as the Communist League by Saumyendranath Tagore in 1934, breaking away from the Communist Party of India (CPI). RCPI led armed uprisings after the independence of India, but later shifted to parliamentary politics. The party is active in Assam, Kerala, West Bengal, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The party was represented in the West Bengal while being a part of Second United Front Cabinet (1969) as well as in various state government during the Left Front rule in the state (1977–2011). In Assam, the party won four Legislative Assembly seats in 1978, but its political influence has since declined in the state.

==Ideology==
The RCPI works toward a socialist revolution, rather than a people&#x27;s democratic revolution, a national democratic revolution or a new democratic revolution.

The party strives to build socialism under the leadership of the proletariat with active cooperation of other exploited strata of the humanity, including peasants, working intellectuals and non-manual working sections of people.

==Communist League==
S.N. Tagore founded the Communist League on 1 August 1934. Tagore was a communist leader from Bengal who had attended the 1928 Sixth Congress of the Communist International, and had stayed in Europe for seven years afterwards. He toured the continent on behalf of the League Against Imperialism. At the 1928 Communist International congress Tagore had sought to challenge the role of M.N. Roy in the organization. Tagore had turned hostile towards Stalin, possibly as in reaction to his failed bid to gain recognition from the Communist International in 1928. On his return to India in 1934 he appealed to CPI to abandon its ultra-left line. Albeit CPI would later moderate its positions after the Seventh Congress of the Communist International, Tagore broke with CPI and founded his own communist group (the Communist League). In May 1934 Tagore set up an &#x27;initiative committee&#x27; for the founding of the new party. Other founders of the Communist League included Sudhir Dasgupta, Prabhat Sen, Ranjit Majumdar and Arun Banerjee.

Tagore denounced the Popular Front line of CPI, rejecting the Congress Socialist Party. In Tagore&#x27;s view the CSP represented an alliance between socialists and reactionary elements of the bourgeoise.

==Communist League and the peasantry==
After the formation of the Communist League Tagore began touring the Bengal country-side, organizing peasants to struggle for abolishing the &quot;zamindari&quot; system. In early 1938 Tagore built a peasants wing, the Bangiyo Pradeshik Kisan Sabha, separate from the CPI-led Krishak Samiti. Tagore&#x27;s BPKS demanded abolition of the zamindari system without giving any compensation to landlords, free distribution of land among the cultivators and agricultural labourers, minimization of revenue demands and cancellation of debts to moneylenders.

==Communist League in Murshidabad==
Tarapada Gupta set up the Communist League branch in Murshidabad in 1936, raising the red flag for the first time in recorded history in the district. Tarapada Gupta had been released from jail in 1935, and he established contact with Tagore&#x27;s group. The Communist League preceded both the CPI and the RSP in Murshidabad. The party successfully organized peasants to refuse to pay rents to landlords in the area. Gupta would later side with Tagore in the 1948 party split.

==Tagore in Assam==
RCPI was the first left organization to established itself in Assam. RCPI built a student movement in Assam. In 1937 a Radical Club was formed at Cotton College, under the cover of the and with Haren Kalita as its leader. In November 1938 Tagore visited Assam and met with a group of students and youth. His visit was organized by the Congressman Debranath Sarma. A Communist League branch was formed in the province in 1939, with several of the Cotton College students as its members. Students who became members of the Communist League included Haren Kalita, Haridas Deka, Tarunsen Deka, Upen Sarma, Ananda Chandra Das, Taracharan Majumdar, Gokul Medhi, Arabinda Ghosh, Loknath Barua, Umakanta Sarma, Bhupen Mahanta, N. Buragohain, Khagendranath Barbarua, Uma Sarma and Kamini Goswami. The students would later contest, and eventually win, the Cotton College Students Union through the Assam Provincial Students Federation. 
Tagore made a second visit to Assam in December 1941. This time he visited Khagen Barbarua at his village in Upper Assam and discussed building the party organization in the province. Tagore was expelled from Assam on 18 December 1941. The Assam Provincial Student Federation, which was under the influence of RCPI supported the Quit India movement.

On 2 May 1940 the Krishak Banuva Panchayat was formed in Gauhati as the open front group of the party in Assam. Kedarnath Goswami was the first president of KBP, a former Congressman and labour organizer. The basic unit of KBP was the Gaon Krishak Panchayat (&#x27;Village Peasants Council&#x27;). The Assamese folk singer Bishnu Prasad Rabha joined KBP in 1945. In 1949 he became a RCPI member.

As the Indian National Congress dominated the tea gardens of Assam and there was little industrial labour in the province, the Communist League instead sought to organize rice mill workers, horse cart drivers and steamboat labourers. The efforts had meagre results. Notably RCPI made no intents to build the party in the hill areas of Assam.

==RCPI and the World War==
The party was organized along Leninist lines with party cells at the bottom of the party hierarchy and the Central Committee as its leadership. In preparation of the impending World War, the party developed a three-tier leadership structure in order for the party to survive under waves of repression. The third tier was entirely clandestine, prepared to take over the party affairs after arrests of the first two tiers.

The party raised the slogan &quot;Not one paisa, not one man for war&quot;. On 4 September 1939 Tagore issued a declaration, labelling the war as an imperialist conflict and called on the Indian workers to turn the imperialist war into civil war. Tagore was arrested and jailed under the Defence of India Act immediately afterwards. With Tagore in jail, Pannalal Dasgupta became general secretary of the party. He toured Assam, Bombay, Madras and Bengal. During the Second World War, peasants influenced by the party were instructed not to sell rice for exportation.

In 1941 the Third Party Conference of the Communist League of India changed its name to Communist Party of India (not to be confused with its far more well-known namesake). In March 1943 the name RCPI was adopted, in order to differentiate itself from the CPI. The party positioned itself claiming to be the sole true leftist party in the country, denouncing all other left forces as ideologically bankrupt. Overall RCPI avoided collaboration with other left-wing groups. RCPI labour organizing was done largely outside the All India Trade Union Congress. It managed to build a core of political cadres and was active building a labour movement amongst workers at the jute mills in the Beliaghata-Narkeldanga area of Calcutta. The party was often referred to as the &#x27;Tagorites&#x27; or as the &#x27;&quot;Ganavani&quot; group&#x27; (after the name of its publication).

RCPI differed with CPI on tactical questions during the Second World War. RCPI denounced the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact as well as declaring the Soviet war with Finland as &#x27;imperialist&#x27;.

The RCPI fully supported the Quit India movement. The party sought to develop the Quit India movement into a revolutionary upheaval. Most of the known party leaders were arrested, and would remain in detention until the end of the Second World War. Through the Radical Institute, RCPI promoted dissemination of locally produced weaponry to use against British government forces in Assam.

In the &quot;Red Front&quot;, in October 1942, Saumyendranath Tagore wrote:
The conclusions that we draw from the Quit India movement are the following:

First, the utter bankruptcy of the Congress, the party of the Indian bourgeoisie and its total inability to lead the national movement.

Secondly, the complete overthrow of non-violence as a technique of struggle.

Thirdly, the complete exposure of the National Frontists, the legal Communists, the germ-carriers of anti-revolutionary Stalinism.

Fourthly, the rapid revolutionisation of the masses.

Fifthly, the ripening of the ideological premises for the growth of real leftism as a result of the political development, both national and international.

The national revolution in India has definitely jumped over the hurdles of Gandhism and has scornfully rejected the petty bourgeois Congress Socialism which is at the service of the Indian bourgeoisie.

It has thoroughly exposed the legal communist traitors of the Stalinist and the Royist brand. Only the political line of the Revolutionary Communist Party stands fully vindicated by the development and march of the national revolutionary movement.

In 1945 RCPI raised two key slogans in Assam, &#x27;land to the tiller&#x27; (&quot;nangal jar mati tar&quot;) and &#x27;one third share&#x27; (&quot;tin bhag&quot;), slogans which became very popular amongst landless peasants and agricultural labourers. KBP was able to make some inroads amongst these sectors.

Some Tribal League leaders in Assam, such as Aniram Basumatari and Daben Khaklari, became RCPI members in the mid-1940s. Their presence in the party helped it to make inroads amongst the tribals in Assam.

==Independence and Partition==
As the departure of British colonial rule came closer, RCPI denounced the negotiated independence as a joint conspiracy between British imperialism and the Indian bourgeoisie. RCPI stated that Independence obtained in 1947 was a false one. Rejecting the official process for independence, RCPI began organizing &quot;panchayats&quot; (i.e. soviets) of workers and peasants in order to convene a Workers and Peasants Constituent Assembly. RCPI denounced the Partition of India as betrayal and surrender to British imperialism. There was a strong Hindu chauvinist trend within RCPI, as alleged by Charles W. Ervin. RCPI opposed the 1946 Cabinet Mission to India, which wanted to place Assam into the Muslim-majority grouping of provinces. According to Salkia, through its opposition to the Cabinet Mission grouping RCPI was able to carve out &quot;a niche for itself in the mainstream politics of Assam&quot;.

In 1946 RCPI discussed a possible merger with the Bolshevik-Leninist Party of India, Ceylon and Burma. The RCPI delegation in the talks consisted of Sudhir Dasgupta, Tarapada Gupta, and Gour Pal. Nevertheless, the merger discussion didn&#x27;t go through. RCPI refused to join the Fourth International. The BLPI discarded the RCPI line of organizing &quot;soviets&quot; as a premature move.

In September 1947 RCPI and BLPI collaborated to build a United Workers Front to challenge the Congress-led trade unions. In December 1947 Tagore was elected president of the All India Bank Employees Association, at its conference held in Lucknow.

==Tagore–Dasgupta split==
Tagore was jailed in November 1947. Tagore was released from prison in 1948. After his release from jail Tagore argued that armed revolution was premature in India. But a sector of the party, led by Pannalal Dasgupta, insisted on turning the campaign of building panchayats into a general armed insurrection.

Dasgupta assembled an All India Party Conference in Birbhum in 1948. Tagore requested to resign from the RCPI Central Committee, a request the Birbhum conference rejected. After the Birbhum conference the followers of Dasgupta began to gather arms and prepare for armed struggle. The developments inside RCPI had an echo in the CPI. Dasgupta&#x27;s view that India was ripe for armed revolution coincided with the position of the new CPI leader B.T. Ranadive.

After the Birbhum conference Tagore, at a public meeting in Calcutta, denounced insurrectional line of Dasgupta. Tagore&#x27;s speech pushed the Dasgupta group to issue disciplinary action against him, accepting his resignation from the Central Committee. Half a year later Tagore gathered his followers for a separate Party Conference, as its 5th Party Congress, in Burdwan. Thus there were two parallel RCPIs, one led by Dasgupta and one led by Tagore. Dasgupta represented the majority group in the split. It was sometimes known as &#x27;RCPI (Rebel Group)&#x27; or as &#x27;RCPI (Dasgupta)&#x27;. The Tagore-led party was known as &#x27;RCPI (Tagore)&#x27;.

==26 February 1949 attacks==
On 26 February 1949 the Dasgupta-led RCPI initiated its armed revolt. They attacked the Dum Dum Airfield, Jessop &amp; Company and the Dum Dum Gun and Shell Factory. At the Jessop plant equipment was stolen. Several persons were killed or injured in the attacks. At the Dum Dum Gun and Shell Factory the sentry was shot. The British manager at Jessop was thrown into a furnace, as were two other Europeans. Another European was stabbed, and later died. At Dum Dum Airfield a plane was set on fire and seven rifles stolen. The militants then moved towards Basirhat. On Jessore Road they attacked the Gouripour Police Post. At Basirhat they attacked a police station, killing two guards and stealing 26 rifles. The militants attempted to flee into East Pakistan. Eventually the group was caught as police reinforcements arrived from Calcutta. A police inspector was killed during the gun fight. Only two of the attackers managed to escape arrest. 39 RCPI cadres were arrested, including Dasgupta himself. They were held without trial for 4–5 years, and then sentenced to jail. Dasgupta himself was sentenced to imprisonment for life.

After the 1949 revolt, the party cast away its line of insurrectional politics. Whilst RCPI acted from underground, no formal ban was placed on the party.

==Assam insurgency==
The Assam branch of RCPI sided with Dasgupta in the 1948 split. In the wake of Independence, RCPI and CPI initiated mass peasant unrest in Assam. In the wake of the Dum Dum-Basirhat attacks, the party decided to launch an armed movement for the independence of Assam from India. The party held a conference in Khowang, Dibrugarh, at which is decided to build a &#x27;People&#x27;s Army&#x27; as an armed mass front of the party. RCPI-led uprisings in Assam took place between 1948 and 1952. Khagen Barbarua led the movement in the non-tribal areas in Upper Assam. The party raised the battle cry &#x27;land belongs to the one who wields a plough, the jungle belongs to one who wields an axe&#x27;, calling for ownership rights for sharecroppers. The Assam government placed a ban on the party, citing the pretext that RCPI organized peasants to cease payments to landlords and supported illegal felling of trees.

In early 1950 RCPI killed Ganga Sarma, a local Indian National Congress leader in Assam, during a meeting. According to the government of Assam, RCPI committed 12 assassinations in the state in 1950. RCPI financed its rebellion in Assam through robberies and extortion. The government responded by cracking down on RCPI in Assam. The government responded by cracking down on RCPI in Assam. As a symbolic protest against the state violence, RCPI cadres tore down the national flag at different places in the state. In the wake of state repression against RCPI, the party lost influence amongst the sharecroppers in Assam.

In the wake of state repression against RCPI, the party lost influence amongst the sharecroppers in Assam. In Assam RCPI and CPI were at loggerheads, especially around the issue of the Soviet Union (RCPI accusing CPI of being controlled by the Soviets, CPI accusing RCPI of being anti-Soviet). RCPI-CPI relations reached its lowest point in 1952.

==Work amongst refugees==
RCPI had a mass organization, the Bastuhara Kalyan Parishad, which organized relief activities in camps of refugees from East Pakistan. The party also had a separate refugee women&#x27;s organization, Bangiya Dal Seba Sangathan. RCPI concentrated its work amongst refugees in Nadia district. In 1948–1949 the RCPI and the All India Forward Bloc dominated the Chandmari and Goshala refugee camps in Nadia district. Prabhat Mukherjee and Amalendu Neogi were key RCPI leaders at Chandmari camp. At Goshala the RCPI cadre Arun Banerjee organized refugee youth into revolutionary politics. The party joined the United Central Refugee Council in August 1950. RCPI(Rebel) in UCRC and ULF. In October 1950 RCPI forcefully took control of 175 bighas near Gayeshpur Colony and redistributed the land amongst 350 refugee families.

==First General Election==
The party boycotted the 1951–1952 elections. In October 1952, the Assam government withdrew the ban on the RCPI.

==Union activism==
RCPI was active within the United Trade Union Congress, but opposed RSP domination of UTUC.

==RCPI in Bihar==
RCPI never gained any prominence in Bihar. The influence of the party solely included a few trade unions in Chhotanagpur. One union influenced by RCPI was the Hindustan Khan Mazdoor Sangh, a coal miners&#x27; union.

==RCPI in Bombay==
Krishna Desai, a textile worker from Bombay, joined RCPI in 1947. He was elected to the Bombay Municipal Corporation at numerous times as a RCPI candidate. Desai joined CPI ahead of the 1967 state assembly election.

Desai had sought refugee in Calcutta, as he was on the run after his role in communal violence. The stayed with the RCPI there and when he returned to Bombay he founded a RCPI branch there. Another labour organizer of RCPI in Bombay was K.L. Bajaj, who became a RCPI member after a visit to Calcutta in the early 1950s. He joined CPI(M) in 1964 and later became vice president of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions.

RCPI took part in the Samyukta Maharashtra struggle of the 1950s.

==1957 elections==
The party fielded 5 candidates in the 1957 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election.

Khagen Barbarua of RCPI was elected to the Assam Legislative Assembly in the 1957 Assam Legislative Assembly election from the Amguri constituency.

==1960 Party Congress==
The party held an All India Party Conference in Howrah in 1960. At the Howrah conference the Trotskyist Revolutionary Workers Party merged into the RCPI. Moreover, Howrah conference elected Sudhindranath Kumar as new general secretary of the party. Kumar had joined the party in 1936. As per an agreement between RWP and RCPI, the Trotskyists were given five seats in the RCPI Central Committee.

==1962 elections==
Ahead of the 1962 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election RCPI joined the CPI-led United Left Front. Two RCPI candidates were elected; Anadi Das from Howrah West and Kanai Pal (ex-RWP) from Santipur.

In Assam RCPI stayed out of the United Opposition Front set up by the Praja Socialist Party and independents. Khagen Barbarua retained the Amguri seat in the 1962 Assam Legislative Assembly election. RCPI had fielded 16 candidates in the election.

==1962 Indo-China war==
When Dasgupta returned after his release from jail, the relations with the former RWP cadres deteriorated. Dasgupta had evolved into a Nehru supporter. In the Indo-China war of 1962 RCPI supported the Nehru government, a move the Trotskyists opposed. As a result of the dispute over the Indo-China war, the Trotskyists broke with RCPI in 1963. Dasgupta himself parted ways with RCPI, moving towards a Gandhian position.

==1967 elections==
Kumar served as convenor of the United Front formed ahead of the 1967 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election. Anadi Das lost his assembly seat in the election. During the protests against the dismissal of the first United Front cabinet in 1967, Kumar was arrested under the Preventive Detention Act.

RCPI won 3 seats in the first Howrah Municipal Corporation polls, held in 1967.

Md. Shamsul Huda of RCPI won the Dhing seat in the 1967 Assam Legislative Assembly election.

==In the Second United Front government==
After the 1969 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election Kumar was named Food and Supplies Minister in the second United Front state government. The Food Minister had been given to the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in the coalition government, but CPI(M) opted to name Kumar as its choice for the post.

The RCPI won two seats in the 1969 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election. Kumar was named convenor of the United Front as well as being named Food Minister in the Second United Front Cabinet. After Kumar&#x27;s entry into the West Bengal state cabinet, the two RCPI legislators, Anadi Das and M. Mokshed Ali, revolted against Kumar&#x27;s leadership. In July 1969 the two legislators were expelled from RCPI, accused of &quot;anti-Party and anti-UF activities&quot;. The expulsion provoked a split in RCPI, with Anadi Das leading his own RCPI faction.

==1970s==
After the fall of the United Front cabinet, the RCPI joined the CPI(M)-led United Left Front. The front, which was formally constituted in May 1970, had Kumar as its convenor. In the 1971 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election RCPI won three seats; Bimalananda Mukherjee in Santipur, Sudhindranath Kumar in Howrah Central and Trilochan Mal in Hansan.

In the 1971 Indian general election RCPI and CPI(M) had an electoral understanding in Assam. RCPI fielded three candidates in the 1971 Lok Sabha election; two in Assam and one in Bihar. In the Nowgong constituency Baneswar Saikia obtained 32,619 votes (14.34%). In the Jorhat constituency Khogen Bar Barua finished in second place with 31,810 votes (17.10%), challenging Tarun Gogoi. In Bihar, Lakshmi Narayan Singh contested the Katihar seat and obtained 1,193 votes (0.43%).

In the 1972 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election RCPI fielded its three incumbent legislators; Mukherjee, Kumar and Mal. All three were defeated, gathering 47038 votes (0.35% of the statewide vote). Whilst RCPI lost its Dhing seat in the 1972 Assam Legislative Assembly election, it managed to score an impressive victory against Dharanidar Chowdhury in Bhabanipur constituency. The Bhabanipur legislator was Ghanakanta Boro.

As of the mid-1970s RCPI published the Bengali weekly &quot;Mat-o-Path&quot; and the Bengali fortnightly &quot;Janasadharan&quot;, both issued from Calcutta.

RCPI fielded a single candidate in the 1974 Orissa Legislative Assembly election. Sarangdhar Muduli, a trade unionist, contested the Sukinda seat and obtained 478 votes (1.21%)

==1977 elections==
Ahead of the 1977 Indian general election RCPI was one of the six founding parties of the CPI(M)-led West Bengal Left Front. The Left Front contested the general election in West Bengal with an electoral understanding with the Janata Party.

But whilst CPI(M) was supportive of the Janata Party in Assam in the 1977 Lok Sabha election, RCPI considered the Janata Party and the Congress(I) equally dangerous. RCPI fielded a single candidate; Shamsul Huda in the Kaliabor constituency. He finished in third place with 45,047 votes (15.63%).

In the subsequent 1977 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election RCPI fielded 4 candidates. Three of the candidates won their seats; Bimalananda Mukherjee was elected from Santipur, Trilochan Mal from Hansan and Sudhindranath Kumar from Howrah Central. Malati Bhusan Hazra finished in third place in Pingla. In total the party obtained 75,156 votes (0.52% of the statewide vote).

==Left Front era==
After the 1977 election, Kumar was named Minister for Food and Civil Supplies in the first Left Front cabinet.

RCPI fielded three candidates in the 1982 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election; Mukherjee in Santipur, Kumar in Howrah Central and Mal in Hansan. In total the three candidates obtained 106,973 votes (0.48% of the statewide vote). Mukherjee and Mal retained their seats. Kumar lost the Howrah Central seat to Congress(I) candidate Ambica Banerjee. Kumar finished in second place with 29,785 votes (43.34%). After having lost his assembly seat, Kumar lost his post as minister. Bimalananda Mukherjee replaced him as the RCPI representative in the Left Front government. However, whilst Kumar had been a cabinet minister Mukherjee was named Minister of State (for Excise). In 1984 CPI(M) wanted to nominate Kumar for a Rajya Sabha (Upper House of the Parliament of India) seat, but that proposal met resistance from other Left Front partners. Kumar died in 1984.

In 1985 a by-election was held in the Hansan (SC) constituency, after the death of incumbent legislator Trilochan Mal. RCPI candidate Umakanta Roy won the by-election.

RCPI contested 8 out of 1111 seats in the West Bengal municipal elections of 1986.

RCPI fielded three candidates in the 1987 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election; Sankar Mondol in Howrah Central, Bimalananda Mukherjee in Santipur and Trilochan Das in Hansan.

The four RCPI legislators were Md. Shamsul Huda from Dhing, Baneswar Saikia from Batadroba, Khagen Barbarua from Amguri and Budha Baruah from Mahmara. Whilst Md.

In the assembly RCPI formed a Left Bloc aligned with CPI(M), CPI, SUCI and CPI(ML).

RCPI and CPI(M) supported the formation of a Janata Party cabinet with Golap Borbora as Chief Minister.

When the Assam agitation began, RCPI and other progressive forces urged the agigatators to accept 25 March 1971 as the cut-off date for deportation of migrants. As Assam was engulfed in communal violence, members of RCPI and other left parties were killed or maimed. The popular support for RCPI and other left parties declined sharply as they had opposed the Assam agitation.

==RCPI in Assam after the Assam agitation==
As of 1981 RCPI was part of the Left Democratic Alliance (along with CPI(M), CPI and SUCI). In April 1984 RCPI joined a convention of opposition parties (along with CPI, Congress (S) and the Janata Party), a move which side-lined the CPI(M).

As per the second list of Left Front candidates for the 2016 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, released in March 2016, RCPI fielded Sanjoy Basu, a Calcutta High Court lawyer, in the Santipur seat and Kamal Hassan in the Hansan seat. After a period of vacillation RCPI endorsed the Left Front-Congress electoral understanding ahead of the 2016 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, although the agreement would mean no seats for RCPI to contest.

<text>Metyrapone, sold under the brand name Metopirone, is a medication which is used in the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency and occasionally in the treatment of Cushing&#x27;s syndrome (hypercortisolism). It is part of the steroidogenesis inhibitor class of drugs.

==Medical uses==
Metyrapone can be used in the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Metyrapone 30 mg/kg, maximum dose 3,000 mg, is administered at midnight usually with a snack. The plasma cortisol and 11-deoxycortisol are measured the next morning between 8:00 and 9:00 am. A plasma cortisol less than 220 nmol/L indicates adequate inhibition of 11β-hydroxylase. In patients with intact Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, CRH and ACTH levels rise as a response to the falling cortisol levels. This results in an increase of the steroid precursors in the pathway. Therefore, if 11-deoxycortisol levels do not rise and remain less than 7 μg/dL (202 nmol/L) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) rises, then it is highly suggestive of adrenal insufficiency. If neither 11-deoxycortisol nor ACTH rise, it is highly suggestive of an impaired hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis at either the pituitary or hypothalamus.

The metyrapone test may aid in verifying the cause of Cushing&#x27;s syndrome. Most patients with pituitary dysfunction and/or pituitary microadenoma will increase ACTH secretion in response to metyrapone, while most ectopic ACTH-producing tumors will not. Pituitary macroadenomas do not always respond to metyrapone.

Metyrapone is used for the medical control of hypercortisolism in Cushing&#x27;s syndrome (ACTH dependent or independent). The aim for medical treatment is to achieve pre-operative control of hypercortisolism, or for control of residual disease persisting post-operatively (TSS, adrenalectomy). It is not for long term definitive treatment/cure, only as an adjunct (surgery is the aim for cure in most causes of Cushing&#x27;s syndrome). Metyrapone hence acts by inhibiting adrenal steroidogenesis. One side effect is hirsutism (in women) because of the excess androgen precursors created. The other commonly used agent for medical treatment of Cushing&#x27;s is ketoconazole (an anti-fungal agent), though it is not FDA approved for Cushing&#x27;s. This does not exhibit the side effect of hirsutism, but does carry a high risk of hepatoxicity and other serious side effects. Levoketoconazole, an enantiomeric form of ketoconazole, is FDA approved to treat Cushing&#x27;s and carries a lower risk of hepatoxicity and other serious side effects compared to ketoconazole.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Metyrapone blocks cortisol steroidogenesis by acting as a reversible inhibitor of 11β-hydroxylase. This stimulates adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion, which in turn increases plasma 11-deoxycortisol levels.

==Chemistry==
Analogues of metyrapone include aminoglutethimide, amphenone B, and mitotane.

==Research==
Metyrapone has been found in early human trials to reduce recollection of emotional memories in normal volunteers. The volunteers showed significant impairment in ability to retrieve memories with negative emotional content while not impairing memories with neutral content. This has significant implication in the study of the process of emotional healing in post traumatic stress disorder.

Due to the permissive action of cortisol on glucagon, partial blockade of cortisol may reduce
the effects of circulating glucagon in chronically increasing blood glucose in metabolic syndrome (syndrome X) and type 2 diabetes.

<text>A watchdog timer (WDT, or simply a &quot;watchdog&quot;), sometimes called a &quot;computer operating properly timer&quot; (&quot;COP timer&quot;), is an electronic or software timer that is used to detect and recover from computer malfunctions. Watchdog timers are widely used in computers to facilitate automatic correction of temporary hardware faults, and to prevent errant or malevolent software from disrupting system operation.

During normal operation, the computer regularly restarts the watchdog timer to prevent it from elapsing, or &quot;timing out&quot;. If, due to a hardware fault or program error, the computer fails to restart the watchdog, the timer will elapse and generate a timeout signal. The timeout signal is used to initiate corrective actions. The corrective actions typically include placing the computer and associated hardware in a safe state and invoking a computer reboot.

Microcontrollers often include an integrated, on-chip watchdog. In other computers the watchdog may reside in a nearby chip that connects directly to the CPU, or it may be located on an external expansion card in the computer&#x27;s chassis.

==Applications==

Watchdog timers are commonly found in embedded systems and other computer-controlled equipment where humans cannot easily access the equipment or would be unable to react to faults in a timely manner. In such systems, the computer cannot depend on a human to invoke a reboot if it hangs; it must be self-reliant. For example, remote embedded systems such as space probes are not physically accessible to human operators; these could become permanently disabled if they were unable to autonomously recover from faults. In robots and other automated machines, a fault in the control computer could cause equipment damage or injuries before a human could react, even if the computer is easily accessed. A watchdog timer is usually employed in cases like these.

Watchdog timers are also used to monitor and limit software execution time on a normally functioning computer. For example, a watchdog timer may be used when running untrusted code in a sandbox, to limit the CPU time available to the code and thus prevent some types of denial-of-service attacks. In real-time operating systems, a watchdog timer may be used to monitor a time-critical task to ensure it completes within its maximum allotted time and, if it fails to do so, to terminate the task and report the failure.

==Architecture and operation==

===Restarting===

The act of restarting a watchdog timer is commonly referred to as &quot;kicking&quot; the watchdog. In electronic watchdogs, kicking is typically done by writing to a watchdog control port or by setting a particular bit in a register. Alternatively, some tightly coupled watchdog timers are kicked by executing a special machine language instruction. An example of this is the CLRWDT (clear watchdog timer) instruction found in the instruction set of some PIC microcontrollers.

In computers that are running operating systems, electronic watchdog restarts are usually invoked through a device driver. For example, in the Linux operating system, a user space program will kick the watchdog by interacting with the watchdog device driver, typically by writing a zero character to or by calling a KEEPALIVE ioctl. The device driver, which serves to abstract the watchdog hardware from user space programs, may also be used to configure the time-out period and start and stop the timer.

Some watchdog timers will only allow kicks during a specific time window. The window timing is usually relative to the previous kick or, if the watchdog has not yet been kicked, to the moment the watchdog was enabled. The window begins after a delay following the previous kick, and ends after a further delay. If the computer attempts to kick the watchdog before or after the window, the watchdog will not be restarted, and in some implementations this will be treated as a fault and trigger corrective action.

===Enabling===
A watchdog timer is said to be &quot;enabled&quot; when operating and &quot;disabled&quot; when idle. Upon power-up, a watchdog may be unconditionally enabled or it may be initially disabled and require an external signal to enable it. In the latter case, the enabling signal may be automatically generated by hardware or it may be generated under software control.

When automatically generated, the enabling signal is typically derived from the computer reset signal. In some systems the reset signal is directly used to enable the watchdog. In others, the reset signal is delayed so that the watchdog will become enabled at some later time following the reset. This delay allows time for the computer to boot before the watchdog is enabled. Without this delay, the watchdog would timeout and invoke a subsequent reset before the computer can run its application software — the software which kicks the watchdog — and the system would become stuck in an endless cycle of incomplete reboots.

===Single-stage watchdog===
Watchdog timers come in many configurations, and many allow their configurations to be altered. For example, the watchdog and CPU may share a common clock signal as shown in the block diagram below, or they may have independent clock signals or in some cases the watchdog may have no clock signal at all. A basic watchdog timer has a single timer which, upon timeout, typically will reset the CPU:

===Multistage watchdog===
Two or more timers are sometimes cascaded to form a &quot;multistage watchdog timer&quot;, where each timer is referred to as a &quot;timer stage&quot;, or simply a &quot;stage&quot;. For example, the block diagram below shows a three-stage watchdog. Depending on the design, this may be implemented with multiple timers, or by emulating multiple timers with a single timer and additional logic.

In a multistage watchdog, only the first stage is kicked by the processor. Upon first stage timeout, a corrective action is initiated and the next stage in the cascade is started. As each subsequent stage times out, it triggers a corrective action and starts the next stage. Upon final stage timeout, a corrective action is initiated, but no other stage is started because the end of the cascade has been reached. Typically, single-stage watchdog timers are used to simply restart the computer, whereas multistage watchdog timers will sequentially trigger a series of corrective actions, with the final stage triggering a computer restart.

===Time intervals===
Watchdog timers may have either fixed or programmable time intervals. Some watchdog timers allow the time interval to be programmed by selecting from among a few selectable, discrete values. In others, the interval can be programmed to arbitrary values. Typically, watchdog time intervals range from ten milliseconds to a minute or more. In a multistage watchdog, each timer may have its own, unique time interval.

==Corrective actions==
A watchdog timer may initiate any of several types of corrective action, including maskable interrupt, non-maskable interrupt, hardware reset, fail-safe state activation, power cycling, or combinations of these. Depending on its architecture, the type of corrective action or actions that a watchdog can trigger may be fixed or programmable. Some computers (e.g., PC compatibles) require a pulsed signal to invoke a hardware reset. In such cases, the watchdog typically triggers a hardware reset by activating an internal or external pulse generator, which in turn creates the required reset pulses.

In embedded systems and control systems, watchdog timers are often used to activate fail-safe circuitry. When activated, the fail-safe circuitry forces all control outputs to safe states (e.g., turns off motors, heaters, and high-voltages) to prevent injuries and equipment damage while the fault persists. In a two-stage watchdog, the first timer is often used to activate fail-safe outputs and start the second timer stage; the second stage will reset the computer if the fault cannot be corrected before the timer elapses.

Watchdog timers are sometimes used to trigger the recording of system state information—which may be useful during fault recovery—or debug information (which may be useful for determining the cause of the fault) onto a persistent medium. In such cases, a second timer—which is started when the first timer elapses—is typically used to reset the computer later, after allowing sufficient time for data recording to complete. This allows time for the information to be saved, but ensures that the computer will be reset even if the recording process fails.

For example, the above diagram shows a likely configuration for a two-stage watchdog timer. During normal operation the computer regularly kicks Stage1 to prevent a timeout. If the computer fails to kick Stage1 (e.g., due to a hardware fault or programming error), Stage1 will eventually timeout. This event will start the Stage2 timer and, simultaneously, notify the computer (by means of a non-maskable interrupt) that a reset is imminent. Until Stage2 times out, the computer may attempt to record state information, debug information, or both. As a last resort, the computer will be reset upon Stage2 timeout.

==Fault detection==
A watchdog timer provides automatic detection of catastrophic malfunctions that prevent the computer from kicking it. However, computers can have other, less-severe types of faults which do not interfere with kicking, but which still require watchdog oversight. To support these, a computer system is typically designed so that its watchdog timer will be kicked only if the computer deems the system functional. The computer determines whether the system is functional by conducting one or more fault detection tests and will kick the watchdog only if all tests have passed.
In computers that are running an operating system and multiple processes, a single, simple test might be insufficient to guarantee normal operation, as it could fail to detect a subtle fault condition and consequently kick the watchdog even though a fault condition exists. For example, in the case of the Linux operating system, a user-space watchdog daemon may simply kick the watchdog periodically without performing any tests. As long as the daemon runs normally, the system will be protected against serious system crashes such as a kernel panic. To detect less severe faults, the daemon can perform tests that cover various aspects of the system condition, including resource availability (e.g., memory, file handles, CPU time), evidence of expected process activity (e.g., system daemons running, specific files being present or updated), overheating, and network activity.

Upon discovery of a failed test, the computer may attempt to perform a sequence of corrective actions under software control, culminating with a software-initiated reboot. If the software fails to invoke a reboot, the hardware watchdog timer — if available — will timeout and invoke a hardware reset. In effect, this is a multistage watchdog timer in which the software comprises the first and the hardware WDT the final stage. In a Linux system, for example, the watchdog daemon can be configured to attempt to perform a software-initiated reboot, which may be preferable to a hardware reset as it allows file systems to be safely unmounted and fault information to be logged prior to the reboot. It is essential, however, to have the insurance provided by a hardware WDT, to allow for the case in which a fault causes the daemon itself to malfunction, and thus become unable to invoke a reboot.

==Implementation==

Watchdog timers are implemented in various ways. Some electronic WDTs (e.g., Analog Devices MAX6324) use linear timing circuits that operate without a digital clock signal. Other electronic WDTs, and software WDTs, typically employ digital counters as timers and rely on a clock signal for proper operation.

===Electronic watchdogs===

Electronic WDTs are usually implemented either as a stand-alone integrated circuit (IC) or as part of a more complex IC. Some stand-alone implementations contain only a WDT, whereas others bundle a WDT with other functions (e.g. supply voltage supervisors) in a common IC.

Many microcontrollers have a watchdog &quot;module&quot; consisting of a digital WDT and mechanisms for controlling and monitoring the WDT. Such modules typically include related control and status registers, circuitry for qualifying restart triggers (&quot;kicks&quot;), and routing control logic for the timeout signal. Some microcontrollers provide an analog WDT in lieu of a digital WDT. For example, Texas Instruments&#x27; TMS470 microcontroller has an analog WDT that employs an external capacitor and resistor to program the watchdog interval.

====Digital watchdogs====

In microcontrollers and other complex digital ICs, a digital WDT is typically instantiated by synthesizing it from a description written in VHDL, Verilog or some other hardware description language. For example, the following VHDL code describes a simple WDT:
entity watchdog_timer is
port (
 CLK : in std_logic; -- clock
 INIT : in std_logic; -- initialize watchdog
 KICK : in std_logic; -- restart timer
 INTERVAL : in unsigned(31 downto 0); -- timer interval in clocks
 TIMEOUT : out std_logic; -- timeout indicator
end watchdog_timer;

architecture behavioral of watchdog_timer is
process(CLK)
 variable elapsed : std_logic; -- timeout register
 variable counter : unsigned(31 downto 0); -- remaining clocks until timeout
begin
 if rising_edge(CLK) then -- upon rising clock edge
 if INIT = &#x27;1&#x27; then -- if watchdog is being initialized
 counter &lt;= INTERVAL; -- start timer
 elapsed &lt;= &#x27;0&#x27;; -- reset timeout indicator
 elsif counter = 0 then -- else if watchdog interval has elapsed
 elapsed &lt;= &#x27;1&#x27;; -- indicate timeout; timer is halted
 elsif KICK = &#x27;1&#x27; then -- else if watchdog is being kicked
 counter &lt;= INTERVAL; -- restart timer
 else -- else
 counter &lt;= counter - 1; -- advance timer
 end if;
 end if;
 TIMEOUT &lt;= elapsed; -- send register output to TIMEOUT
end process;
end behavioral;
====Analog watchdogs====

Analog WDTs have a &quot;kick&quot; input and &quot;timeout&quot; output, but lack the clock input signal found in digital electronic watchdogs.

Circuitry and components vary widely among analog watchdogs, but in general, analog WDTs typically base their timing functions on capacitor charging rates. For example, in the analog watchdog circuit shown to the right, electric current &quot;i&quot; gradually charges capacitor &quot;C&quot;, causing voltage &quot;VC&quot; to ramp up (rise at a constant rate). In normal operation, periodic &quot;kick&quot; pulses are applied to the kick input. Each kick causes capacitor &quot;C&quot; to discharge, thus restarting the voltage ramp-up. However, if the kicks cease or become spaced too far apart in time, &quot;VC&quot; will rise above threshold voltage &quot;VTH&quot; and, as a result, the voltage comparator will assert the &quot;timeout&quot; signal.

===Software watchdogs===

Some software watchdog timers are implemented as standard software modules. Examples of these include &quot;Softdog&quot;, a virtual device driver which emulates an electronic WDT and conforms to the Linux watchdog API, and MathWorks&#x27; Software Watchdog Timer, a retriggerable one-shot timer which can be instantiated by dragging its GUI representation onto a block diagram. Other software WDTs are typically custom-designed to meet specific requirements.

Every software WDT depends on a timing reference to allow it to accurately track the passage of time. Various mechanisms are commonly available for this purpose. Depending on the computer, and if used, the operating system (OS), such mechanisms may include programmable interval timers, kernel timers, the system clock, and synchronization objects (e.g., semaphores) that support timed waits.

The design of a software WDT can be influenced by a number of factors, including the length of the watchdog interval, the time references available for WDT use, CPU loading, how soon the WDT must be kicked after relevant conditions have been met, whether the computer is running an OS and, if so, whether the WDT is intended to run in user or kernel mode. For example, in bare metal applications (program running without an OS), timing references are often limited to programmable interval timers (PIT). In such cases, the WDT might be implemented with a PIT in a fashion similar to the flowchart shown below:

In the above example, if the application program fails to kick the watchdog (by restarting the PIT), the PIT will reach the end of the watchdog interval and generate an interrupt request (IRQ). The associated interrupt service routine (ISR) will then execute and take corrective action via programmed I/O, system calls, or other software-controlled operations.

<text>Biplobi Bangla Congress (English: Revolutionary Bangla Congress; 
 BBC) is a political party in West Bengal, India. The party emerged as a splinter group of the Bangla Congress party ahead of the 1971 West Bengal elections. It was founded by Sukumar Roy, a prominent member of Congress. BBC is now the part of the Left Front.

== History ==
The formation of BBC is an important part of the history of Politics of West Bengal. The Congress party held state power for the first two decades after partition, before trying out another grouping in 1967. At that time, the first United Front government came to power with Ajoy Mukherjee of the Bangla Congress (a Congress splinter group) as chief minister, Jyoti Basu as deputy chief minister and ministry of land and land revenue (reforms) as Hare Krishna Konar. 

Thereafter followed four years of political instability due to the Naxalite rebellion and police counter-action, the Congress muscled its way back to power in the 1972 elections, when even Jyoti Basu lost his assembly seat to a nonentity by 40,000 votes. 

In 1977, the voters brought the Biplobi Bangla Congress and Left Front merged to power, with latter retaining the title and from since then they remained firm as the ruling party of West Bengal for 34 years. 

==Symbols==

The flag adopted by the party is red &amp; white (3:1 ratio) with Hammer &amp; Plough symbol at the center.

== Contested elections ==
BBC candidate Tushar Kanti Laya contested the Sabong seat in Midnapore for 2001 assembly elections of the state and won it. In the 2006 assembly elections of West Bengal, BBC again contested the Sabong seat with Tushar Kanti Laya as its candidate (on a Communist Party of India (Marxist) symbol). Laya got 62,079 votes (44.98%), but lost the seat to Congress candidate Dr. Manas Bhunia.

==Prominent members==
Some prominent leaders of Biplobi Bangla Congress are Nirmalendu Bhattacharya, Gouranga Samanta, Ashis Chowdhury, Sunil Chowdhury, Deepak Senroy (SUBRATA ROY). Gouranga Samanta was elected as MLA two times from Dabang, Medinipur. Other MLAs were Dr Makhan Lal Bangal, Tushar Laya. Dr. Umesh Chaudhary &amp; Reeta Chowdhury were Councillor in KMC (Kolkata Municipal Corporation) at different times.

<doc id="862182" wikidata="Q254602" url="?curid=862182" title="Cadillac Ranch">
<text>Cadillac Ranch is a public art installation and sculpture in Amarillo, Texas, US. It was created in 1974 by Chip Lord, Hudson Marquez and Doug Michels, who were a part of the art group Ant Farm.

The installation consists of a row of 10 Cadillacs (1949–1963) buried nose-first in the ground. Installed in 1974, the cars were either older running, used or junk cars – together spanning the successive generations of the car line – and the defining evolution of their tailfins. According to Visit Amarillo the cars are inclined at the same angle as the pyramids of Giza.

==History==
Chip Lord and Doug Michels were architects; Marquez was an art student at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. According to Lord, &quot;Ant Farm was founded as an alternative architectural practice, kind of an experiment in an attempt to subvert normal corporate ways of doing architecture.&quot;

According to Marquez, &quot;Chip and I were living in the mountains north of San Francisco, and there was a book meant for kids left in a bar near where we lived. It was called &#x27;The Look of Cars,&#x27; and there was something on the rise and fall of the tail fin. I didn&#x27;t have a lot to do, so I just sorta drew it up. I&#x27;ve always loved the Cadillacs.&quot;

The group claims to have been given a list of eccentric millionaires in 1972 in San Francisco, identifying Stanley Marsh 3 of Amarillo amongst those who might be able to fund one of their projects and submitted it to him. Marsh&#x27;s response began &quot;It&#x27;s going to take me awhile [sic] to get used to the idea of the Cadillac Ranch. I&#x27;ll answer you by April Fool&#x27;s Day. It&#x27;s such an irrelevant and silly proposition that I want to give it all my time and attention so I can make a casual judgment of it.&quot;

==Relocation==
&quot;Cadillac Ranch&quot; was originally located in a wheat field, but in 1997 the installation was quietly moved by a local contractor to a location two miles (three kilometers) to the west, to a cow pasture along Interstate 40, in order to place it farther from the limits of the growing city. Both sites belonged to Stanley Marsh 3. Marsh was well known in the city for his longtime patronage of artistic endeavors including the &quot;Cadillac Ranch&quot;; &quot;Floating Mesa&quot;; &quot;Amarillo Ramp&quot;, a work by land artist Robert Smithson; and a series of fake traffic signs throughout the city known collectively as the &quot;Dynamite Museum&quot;. As of 2013, Stanley Marsh 3 did not own the Cadillac Ranch; ownership appears to have been transferred to a family trust some time before his June 2014 death.

&quot;Cadillac Ranch&quot; is visible from the highway, and though located on private land, visiting it (by driving along a frontage road and entering the pasture by walking through an unlocked gate) is tacitly encouraged. In addition, writing graffiti on or otherwise spray-painting the vehicles is now encouraged, and the vehicles, which have long since lost their original colors, are wildly decorated. Ant Farm artists have encouraged this kind of public interaction with the cars.

The cars are periodically repainted various colors (once white for the filming of a television commercial, another time pink in honor of Stanley&#x27;s wife Wendy&#x27;s birthday, and again all 10 cars were painted flat black to mark the passing of Ant Farm artist Doug Michels, or simply to provide a fresh canvas for future visitors). In 2012 they were painted rainbow colors to commemorate LBGT pride week. The cars were briefly &quot;restored&quot; to their original colors by the motel chain Hampton Inn in a public relations-sponsored series of Route 66 landmark restoration projects. The new paint jobs and even the plaque commemorating the project lasted less than 24 hours without fresh graffiti. The cars were painted solid black with the words &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot; in June 2020 to protest police brutality and the murder of George Floyd.

==2019 fire==
On September 8, 2019, the oldest of the Cadillacs was reportedly damaged by an arson fire.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Cadillac Ranch&quot; is the name of a Bruce Springsteen song on his 1980 album &quot;The River&quot;, later covered by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and Status Quo.

The music video for the 1985 song &quot;Living in America&quot; by James Brown and the music video for the 2008 song &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Rest for the Wicked&quot; by Cage the Elephant both feature imagery of the Cadillac Ranch. The Cadillac Ranch is also featured on the cover of singer/songwriter Russell Christian&#x27;s first EP &quot;Chassis&quot;.

In the 1990 book &quot;12 Days on the Road: The Sex Pistols and America&quot;, the Sex Pistols pass by Cadillac Ranch on their way to New Mexico during their only American tour. Johnny Rotten sneered and sarcastically described it as &quot;a stirring work.&quot;

The 1996 film &quot;Cadillac Ranch&quot; directed by Lisa Gottlieb and starring Christopher Lloyd and Suzy Amis is set in the Texas Panhandle around its namesake ranch.

Pixar&#x27;s 2006 animated film &quot;Cars&quot; depicts a &quot;Cadillac Range&quot; as a mountain formation; the film&#x27;s credits directly acknowledge the Ant Farm collective and the &quot;Cadillac Ranch&quot;. In a case of art-imitating-art-imitating-art, that image from the film &quot;Cars&quot; has been constructed as a centerpiece of Cars Land at Disney California Adventure.

In the final scene of the &quot;King of the Hill&quot; episode &quot;Hank Gets Dusted&quot;, Hank Hill has his father&#x27;s Cadillac, which he cherished growing up, pushed front first into a hole along with other Cadillacs to reference the &quot;Cadillac Ranch&quot;.

Cadillac Ranch serves as the setting for the video for the 2009 song &quot;Honky Tonk Stomp&quot; by country duo Brooks &amp; Dunn, which was the duo&#x27;s last video.

The band Atomic Tom filmed a video at Cadillac Ranch in November 2011.

In 1992 country music artist Chris LeDoux released a song titled &quot;Cadillac Ranch&quot;, written by Chuck Jones and Chris Waters, on his album &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do with a Cowboy&quot;. It was a duet with Garth Brooks. The song reached #18 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart and #16 on the Canadian RPM Country Tracks chart.

Book cover artist David Pelham discusses &quot;Jungian Zeitgeist&quot; and other buried 1974 Cadillacs (his cover painting for JG Ballard&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Drought&quot; (Penguin edition, 1974) and Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;On the Beach&quot; album cover) in a 2012 interview.
A scene filmed at the ranch appeared in the 2017 film &quot;Bomb City&quot;.

In May 2019, photographer/artist George Edward Freeney Jr. photographed the &quot;Cadillac Ranch&quot; inspired by reflecting on his childhood experiences of extending the artistic approach by spray painting on them several times while evading local authorities and his mother in the 1980s, he made &quot;West Texas Street Painter&quot; and &quot;West Texas Street Painted&quot;, limited edition imagery.

In August 2020, singer Rihanna took an &quot;art&quot; selfie at the Cadillac Ranch, alongside a message on a car showing disapproval for Donald Trump.

<text>John William Griggs (July 10, 1849 – November 28, 1927) was an American lawyer and Republican Party politician who served as the 29th Governor of New Jersey from 1896 to 1898 and the 43rd United States Attorney General from 1898 to 1901.

As Governor, Griggs gained a reputation for siding with &quot;the little guy&quot; in conflicts between impoverished workers and their employers; he was also an advocate of civil rights for African-Americans.

==Early life==
John William Griggs was born on July 10, 1849, on his family&#x27;s farm on Ridge Road near Newton, New Jersey to Daniel and Emeline Johnson Griggs. The Griggs family had settled in the state around 1733 and had been a farming family since.

John Griggs attended the Collegiate Institute in Newton before enrolling at Lafayette College in 1864. Though he participated in an unruly protest against the abolition of fraternities on campus (as a member of Theta Delta Chi), Griggs graduated as scheduled in 1868. He returned to Newton and studied law as a clerk in the office of Robert Hamilton for three years, before spending the final months of his apprenticeship in the offices of Socrates Tuttle of Paterson. Tuttle, a prominent local Republican, would soon be elected mayor of the city and had also mentored another young Republican attorney, Garret Hobart, who became Tuttle&#x27;s son-in-law. Hobart and Griggs began a political friendship which would eventually take both men to Washington.

In November 1871, Griggs received his law license. After two years of independent practice, he entered a partnership with Tuttle and by 1879 had developed a large clientele of his own. Future New Jersey Attorney General Robert H. McCarter praised Griggs as an excellent mediator, known for his &quot;wonderful power of clearing up difficulties that arose in the course of protracted trials.&quot;

== State politics (1875–96) ==
Griggs entered politics in 1875 as a Republican candidate for the New Jersey General Assembly from Paterson. He narrowly unseated the Democratic incumbent with 51.9 percent of the vote and became the youngest member of the Assembly at just twenty-six years old. Despite his age, he was appointed to several committees and played a key role in drafting the election laws under a recently approved set of constitutional amendments. He was re-elected in 1876 but defeated for a third term in 1877, which was generally a Democratic year.

Having been turned out of the legislature, Griggs cultivated his legal practice and served as a government attorney. From 1878 to 1879, he was counsel to the Passaic County Board of Chosen Freeholders and from 1879 to 1882, he was city counsel for Paterson.

In 1882, Griggs returned to Trenton by succeeding Garret Hobart as State Senator. He won a narrow election over James Inglis Jr., a local judge, by 182 votes. In the Senate, Griggs chaired eight regular committees in six years, including Railroads, Canals and Turnpikes and Revision and Amendment of the Laws. As Senator, his chief achievement came in 1884 when he chaired a joint committee on corporate taxation. He heavily revised the proposal by Governor Leon Abbett to be less punitive, and his bill became law and survived judicial scrutiny. Riding this wave of success, Griggs stood for President of the Senate in 1885 but lost to Abraham V. Schenck. He was elected to succeed Schenck in 1886, furthering his statewide profile and ambitions.

In 1888, Griggs was a delegate-at-large to the Republican National Convention from New Jersey, as part of a slate supporting favorite son William Walter Phelps. After Benjamin Harrison won the nomination, Griggs delivered the speech nominating Phelps for Vice President; he finished second behind Levi P. Morton of New York.

Though Griggs hoped to be nominated for Governor in 1889 on the basis of his taxation bill, he found little support for his candidacy. President Harrison seriously considered nominating him to the Supreme Court in 1892 to succeed fellow New Jerseyan Joseph P. Bradley. Griggs lobbied for the seat through his friend Hobart (by then serving as Senate President himself) and others but did not receive the nomination, which instead went to George Shiras Jr.

== Governor of New Jersey (1896–98) ==

=== 1895 election ===

In 1895, Griggs ran an active campaign for Governor. He received the Republican nomination at the party convention on the third ballot over Representative John Kean, who had taken the nomination in 1892.

In the general election, Griggs campaigned on a platform for &quot;honesty, retrenchment, and reform.&quot; He charged the Democratic Party and nominee Alexander T. McGill of Jersey City with eleven years of corruption and voter fraud. He also criticized recent Democratic legislation, including a Coal Combine bill and legalized racetrack gambling. He spoke infrequently on national issues, but opposed free silver, free trade, and Chinese immigration. Disaffection with the Democratic Party in the state and the party&#x27;s growing opposition to the gold standard nationally paved the way for Griggs&#x27;s solid victory; he was the first Republican elected as Governor since Marcus Lawrence Ward thirty years earlier in 1865, when the party still ran under the National Union label in New Jersey. His victory was the first of five consecutive wins for the party.

=== Term in office ===
Griggs held his inauguration in a formal affair at Taylor&#x27;s Opera House on June 21, 1896. In his speech, he called for &quot;a restriction in the volume of legislation,&quot; especially the growing trend of municipal incorporation, and reforms protecting citizens against injuries from trolley cars and urban sewer pollution.

As he had during the election campaign, Griggs called for depoliticization of charitable and penal institutions. He opened his term in office by removing many Democratic state officials from office, including longtime Secretary of State Henry C. Kelsey and Attorney General John P. Stockton, who had each served for decades under Democratic governors, and many &quot;lay judges&quot; of the courts of common pleas. On March 19, 1896, Senator Foster McGowan Voorhees introduced a bill to eliminate the courts of common pleas and reduce the pay for county court judges, which Griggs later signed into law.

Griggs also signed bills eliminating grade crossings in Newark and Jersey City and preventing water pollution.

== U.S. Attorney General (1898–1901) ==
In 1898, Griggs was offered the position of United States Attorney General by William McKinley. His appointment came at the recommendation of Hobart, his political mentor and now the Vice President of the United States. Griggs had been a longtime McKinley supporter, speaking on behalf of the candidate at the first McKinley for President club in the country in April 1896.

As Attorney General, Griggs&#x27;s chief achievement was arguing the Insular Cases before the Supreme Court, which determined the constitutional status of the lands won in the Spanish–American War. Griggs was an ardent supporter of the President&#x27;s imperial policy and had accompanied McKinley and Hobart to Cuba, where they visited Theodore Roosevelt following his victory at the Battle of San Juan Hil. In the Insular Cases, he leaned heavily on Justice Bradley&#x27;s decision in &quot;Late Corp. of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. United States&quot; to advance a national view of the Constitution.

After McKinley&#x27;s assassination in 1901, Griggs resigned from the cabinet. In December of that year, Senator William J. Sewell died in office. Griggs was put forward as a leading candidate to succeed him, but the legislature ultimately elected John F. Dryden.

== Return to private life ==
Griggs was one of the first members appointed to the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague, and served from 1901 to 1912. He also returned to private legal practice, founding the corporate firm of Griggs, Dill and Harding in New York City.

When the Consolidated National Bank of New York was organized on July 1, 1902, the fourteen directors included Griggs, Henry C. Brewster, George Crocker, Mortimer H. Wagar, and Perry Belmont. In 1905 he was named the president of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America, and held that office until the company was reorganized as the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) in 1919. At RCA he was a director and the company&#x27;s general counsel until his death.

==Personal life and death==
Griggs married Carolyn Webster Brandt in 1874 and Laura Elizabeth Price in 1893. He had seven children.

Griggs&#x27;s niece Elizabeth Alden Curtis Holman was the plaintiff in a 1914 case in United States federal court which successfully challenged forced institutionalization.

Griggs was a trustee to his alma mater, Lafayette College, from 1894 to 1900.

Griggs died on November 28, 1927, in Paterson, New Jersey. He was buried at Cedar Lawn Cemetery in that city.

==Honors==
Griggs Avenue in Teaneck, New Jersey, bears his name.

<text>John Griggs Thompson (born October 13, 1932) is an American mathematician at the University of Florida noted for his work in the field of finite groups. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1970, the Wolf Prize in 1992, and the Abel Prize in 2008.

==Biography==
Thompson received his Bachelor of Arts from Yale University in 1955 and his doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1959 under the supervision of Saunders Mac Lane. After spending some time on the mathematics faculty at the University of Chicago, he moved in 1970 to receive the Rouse Ball Professorship in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge and later moved to the Mathematics Department of the University of Florida as a Graduate Research Professor. He is currently a professor emeritus of pure mathematics at the University of Cambridge, and a professor of mathematics at the University of Florida. He received the Abel Prize in 2008 together with Jacques Tits.

==Academic career==
Thompson&#x27;s doctoral thesis introduced new techniques and included the solution of a problem in finite group theory which had stood for around sixty years: the nilpotency of Frobenius kernels. At the time, this achievement was noted in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Thompson became a figure in the progress toward the classification of finite simple groups. In 1963, he and Walter Feit proved that all nonabelian finite simple groups are of even order (the &quot;Odd Order Paper&quot;, filling a whole issue of the &quot;Pacific Journal of Mathematics&quot;). This work was recognised by the award of the 1965 Cole Prize in Algebra of the American Mathematical Society. His N-group papers classified all finite simple groups for which the normalizer of every non-identity solvable subgroup is solvable. This included, as a by-product, the classification of all minimal finite simple groups (simple groups for which every proper subgroup is solvable). This work had some influence on later developments in the classification of finite simple groups, and was quoted in the citation by Richard Brauer for the award of Thompson&#x27;s Fields Medal in 1970 (Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, Nice, France, 1970).

The Thompson group &quot;Th&quot; is one of the 26 sporadic finite simple groups. Thompson also made major contributions to the inverse Galois problem. He found a criterion for a finite group to be a Galois group, that in particular implies that the monster simple group is a Galois group.

==Awards==
In 1971, Thompson was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences. In 1982, he was awarded the Senior Berwick Prize of the London Mathematical Society, and, in 1988, he received the honorary degree of Doctor of Science from the University of Oxford. In 1992 he was awarded the Wolf Prize in Mathematics. Thompson was awarded the United States National Medal of Science in 2000. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society and a recipient of its Sylvester Medal in 1985. He is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.

<text>Sindoor (, ) or sindura is a traditional vermilion red or orange-red cosmetic powder from South Asia, usually worn by married women along the part of their hairline. In Nepal and some North Indian Hindu communities, the sindoor is a visual marker of marital status of a woman and ceasing to wear it usually implies widowhood.

Traditional sindoor was made with turmeric and alum or lime, or from other herbal ingredients. Unlike red lead and vermilion, these are not poisonous. Some commercial sindoor products contain synthetic ingredients, some of which are not manufactured to proper standards and may contain lead.

==Application==


Sindoor is traditionally applied at the beginning or completely along the parting-line of a woman&#x27;s hair (also called &quot;mang&quot; in Hindi or &quot;simandarekha&quot; in Sanskrit) or as a dot on the forehead. Sindoor is the mark of a married woman in Hinduism. Single women wear the bindi in different colours for special occasions but don&#x27;t apply sindoor in their parting of the hairline. Widows do not wear sindoor or bindis, signifying that their husband is no longer alive.

The sindoor is first applied to the woman by her husband on the day of her wedding; this is called the Sindoor Danam ceremony. After this, she applies it herself every day.

A similar colouring ritual is known as pasupu kumkuma, named after another name for sindoor, kumkuma.

The wiping off of the sindoor is very significant for a widow. There are many rituals associated with this practice. The most common is when a mother-in-law or older sister-in-law wipes off the sindoor when a woman becomes a widow. The widow will break her bangles and remove her bindi as well, and many will also remove their nose ring and toe rings. The parting of hair is symbolic of a river of red blood full of life. When the sindoor is removed then the river becomes barren, dry and empty. This custom is prevalent in rural areas and is followed by all castes and social ranks.

The red sindoor is significant for the married woman as she is full of colour. When she becomes a widow she adopts plain white dress and removes all colour from her face including the bright red sindoor.

Methods and styles of applying the sindoor vary from personal choice to regional customs. Many new brides will fill the whole hair line with sindoor, while other married women may just apply a red spot at the end of the hair line and forehead. Recently, a triangle shape on the forehead pointing towards the nose, with a diamond bindi for fashion, is being worn by younger women.

==Hinduism==
Neolithic female figurines excavated at Mehrgarh, Baluchistan seem to imply application of sindoor-like colour to the parting of women&#x27;s hair. According to the legends, Radha, a consort of Krishna, turned the kumkuma into a flame-like design on her forehead. In the famous epic Mahabharata, Draupadi the wife of the Pandavas, wipes off her sindoor in disgust and despair at the happenings in Hastinapura. Use of sindoor is frequently mentioned in the texts &quot;Lalita Sahasranama&quot; and &quot;Soundarya Lahari&quot;.

Adi Shankaracharya writes in &quot;Soundarya Lahari&quot;:
Jain women apply the sindoor, mostly in the cities. Jain nuns are forbidden to apply this to their hair line or foreheads. The display of the sindoor is considered very important to indicate the married status of the groom, whereas in several local cultures, sindoor is applied on their hair partings by unmarried women.

Application of sindoor is essentially a Hindu tradition. In the 19th century, Sufi leader Sharafuddin Maneri encouraged Muslim women to apply sindoor in Bangladesh. This was severely condemned by reformist movements.

== Ayurvedic medicine==

There are various forms of sindoor mentioned in Ayurveda. Traditional sindoor is made from natural ingredients used for facial makeup (cosmetics). Most widely used traditional sindoor is made from turmeric and lime or &quot;chuna&quot; (which is basic in nature). Other ingredients include ghee, and slaked lime. This is also called kumkuma. Sindoor is also made from red sandal powder, saffron etc. The coloured powders sold as substitutes are traditionally not considered sindoor.

==Toxicity concerns==
Traditional sindoor was made with turmeric and alum or lime, or from other herbal ingredients. The turmeric powder becomes red when mixed with lime juice or lime powder. Unlike red lead and vermilion, these are not poisonous. Modern material being sold as sindoor mainly uses vermilion, an orange-red pigment, the purified and powdered form of cinnabar, which is the chief form in which mercury sulfide naturally occurs. As with other compounds of mercury, sindoor is toxic and must be handled carefully. Sometimes, red lead (lead tetroxide, also known as minium) is added to sindoor. Red lead is toxic. In early 2008, allegations of high lead content led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to recall batches of sindoor from several manufacturers.

==In popular culture==
There are many Indian movies and dramas involving sindoor, with their themes revolving around the ritual&#x27;s significance. These include &quot;Sindoor&quot; (1947), &quot;Sindooram&quot; (1976), Rakta Sindhuram (1985), &quot;Sindoor&quot; (1987), and &quot;Sindoor Tere Naam Ka&quot; (series, 2005–2007).

<doc id="862210" wikidata="Q1155110" url="?curid=862210" title="Kariwa District, Niigata">
<text>is a district located in Niigata Prefecture, Japan.

As of July 1, 2019, the district has an estimated population of 4,578 with a density of 174 persons per km2. The total area is 26.27 km2.

==Municipalities==
The district consists of only one village:

* Kariwa

==History==
The district (excluding the west side of Kashiwazaki) was once part of the now-defunct Koshi District until the Heian period when the district was created under the name of Mishima District. Prior to the split, Mishima District covered the cities of Kashiwazaki (excluding the western part of the city, being the areas of Agewa (Kamiwa), Takaze (Takahane) and Warabino from the former municipality of Kakizaki) and Nagaoka (parts of the former towns of Oguni and Koshiji), and the village of Kariwa. When Santō District split off from Koshi District during the Edo period, Mishima was renamed to Kariwa.

In 1940, the town of Kashiwazaki became a city. After Kashiwazaki merged the surrounding areas, the district continued on to shrink. On April 1, 2005, the town of Oguni merged into the city of Nagaoka; and a month later, the towns of Nishiyama and Takayanagi merged into the city of Kashiwazaki. With this merger, Kariwa District has only the village of Kariwa left.

===District Timeline===

===Recent mergers===
* On April 1, 2005 - The town of Oguni was merged into the expanded city of Nagaoka.
* On May 1, 2005 - The towns of Nishiyama and Takayanagi were merged into the expanded city of Kashiwazaki.

<text>Gerd Faltings (; born 28 July 1954) is a German mathematician known for his work in arithmetic geometry.

==Education==
From 1972 to 1978, Faltings studied mathematics and physics at the University of Münster. Interrupted by 15 months of obligatory military service, he received his PhD in mathematics in 1978.

==Career and research==
In 1981 he obtained the &quot;venia legendi&quot; (Habilitation) in mathematics, from the University of Münster. During this time he was an assistant professor at the University of Münster. From 1982 to 1984, he was professor at the University of Wuppertal.

From 1985 to 1994, he was professor at Princeton University. In the fall of 1988 and in the academic year 1992–1993 he was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study.

In 1986 he was awarded the Fields Medal at the ICM at Berkeley for proving the Tate conjecture for abelian varieties over number fields, the Shafarevich conjecture for abelian varieties over number fields and the Mordell conjecture, which states that any non-singular projective curve of genus &quot;g&quot; &gt; 1 defined over a number field &quot;K&quot; contains only finitely many &quot;K&quot;-rational points. As a Fields Medalist he gave an ICM plenary talk &quot;Recent progress in arithmetic algebraic geometry&quot;.

In 1994 as an ICM invited speaker in Zurich he gave a talk &quot;Mumford-Stabilität in der algebraischen Geometrie.&quot; Extending methods of Paul Vojta, he proved the Mordell–Lang conjecture, which is a generalization of the Mordell conjecture. Together with Gisbert Wüstholz, he reproved Roth&#x27;s theorem, for which Roth had been awarded the Fields medal in 1958.

In 1994, he returned to Germany and from 1994 to 2018, he was a director of the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn. 
In 1996, he received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, which is the highest honour awarded in German research.

Faltings has been the formal supervisor of over a dozen students, including Shinichi Mochizuki, Wieslawa Niziol, and Nikolai Dourov.

<text>William Henry Harrison Miller (September 6, 1840 – May 25, 1917) was an American lawyer and Attorney General of the United States.

==Early life, education, and military service==
Born in Augusta, New York, one of the ten children born to Curtis and Lucy (Duncan) Miller, Miller was named for former president William Henry Harrison. At the age of fifteen, Miller began teaching school. He attended an academy at Whitestown, New York, and graduated from Hamilton College in 1861. While at Hamilton, he joined The Delta Upsilon fraternity. He moved to Maumee, Ohio, and there, in May, 1862, enlisted as a private in the 84th Ohio Infantry Regiment, for service in the American Civil War, and was elected lieutenant. His service ended in September of that year.

After the war, Miller moved to Toledo, Ohio, read law in the office of Morrison Waite, later Chief Justice of the United States, and was admitted to the bar at Peru, Indiana in 1865. He practiced in that city for a short time, and also held the office of county school examiner.

==Legal career==
In 1866, Miller moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana, where he formed a partnership with William H. Coombs. Upon the retirement of Albert G. Porter from the Indianapolis law firm of Porter, Harrison &amp; Hines, in 1874, Miller was invited to become a member of that firm, which became then the firm of Harrison, Hines &amp; Miller; the senior partner of the firm being Benjamin Harrison. Miller also served as President of the Indianapolis Bar Association from 1884 to 1885, and was &quot;for many years... a trusted advisor&quot; to leaders of the Republican Party in Indiana.

For many years, and particularly during the campaign of 1888, he was a confidential advisor to Harrison. On March 5, 1889, President Harrison appointed Miller United States Attorney General, sending the appointment to the United States Senate along with most of his other cabinet nominations, with the entire cabinet being &quot;confirmed in a ten minute executive session of the senate&quot;. At the time of his appointment, it was reported that Miller was &quot;considered a wealthy man, having grown rich in the practice of his profession&quot;. Miller served in that capacity for the duration of Harrison&#x27;s term, until 1893.

As Attorney General, Miller personally handled a number of matters of importance to the administration, including litigation over the status of the Bering Sea, defense of the constitutionality of the McKinley Tariff, and of the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 and the International Copyright Act of 1891. He also managed the admission of North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Washington, Idaho and Wyoming to the Union. Miller also played a key role in the notorious matter of the death of David S. Terry, a former California Supreme Court Justice who was shot and killed by a U.S. marshal while attempting to attack U.S. Supreme Court justice Stephen Johnson Field, who had previously sentenced Terry to six months in jail for contempt of court in connection with a case. Terry had threatened Field, and Miller personally directed the U.S. marshal service to defend Field. When California authorities sought to prosecute the marshal who shot Terry, Miller asserted his authority to protect the safety of the federal judiciary, and personally argued the cause on the Supreme Court, which ruled in his favor.

After his retirement from the cabinet, Miller returned to Indianapolis and resumed active practice as a member of the firm of Miller, Winter &amp; Elam, later succeeded by the firm of Miller, Shirley, Miller &amp; Thompson, and later still Miller, Dailey &amp; Thompson. From 1893 to 1898, he also served as a trustee of his alma mater, Hamilton College.

==Personal life and death==
On December 23, 1863, Miller married Gertrude A. Bunce, daughter of Sidney A. Bunce, of Vernon, New York. They had seven children, of whom three survived their father. Miller died in 1917 in Indianapolis, Indiana, and is buried in Crown Hill Cemetery in that city.

<text>was a district located in Niigata, Japan.

As of 2003, the district had an estimated population of 19,638 with a density of 45.60 persons per km2. The total area was 430.64 km2.

== Municipalities ==
Prior to its dissolution, the district consisted of three towns and three villages:

* Maki
* Matsudai
* Matsunoyama
* Ōshima
* Uragawara
* Yasuzuka

==History==
The district was founded when the former Kubiki District split into Higashikubiki District, Nakakubiki District, and Nishikubiki District. At the time of founding, the district covered the eastern portion of the city of Jōetsu (the sections of Maki, Ōshima, Uragawara and Yasuzuka) and the western portion of the city of Tōkamachi (the sections of Matsudai and Matsunoyama).

===District Timeline===
===Recent mergers===
* On January 1, 2005 - The town of Yasuzuka, and the villages of Maki, Ōshima and Uragawara, along with the towns of Itakura, Kakizaki, Ōgata and Yoshikawa, the villages of Kiyosato, Kubiki, Nakagō and Sanwa (all from Nakakubiki District), and the town of Nadachi (from Nishikubiki District), were merged into the expanded city of Jōetsu.
* On April 1, 2005 - The towns of Matsudai and Matsunoyama, along with the town of Kawanishi, and the village of Nakasato (both from Nakauonuma District), were merged into the expanded city of Tōkamachi. Therefore, Higashikubiki District was dissolved as a result of this merger.

<text>was a town located in Higashikubiki District, Niigata Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 2,974 and a density of 34.46 persons per km2. The total area was 86.31 km2.

On April 1, 2005, Matsunoyama, along with the town of Matsudai (also from Higashikubiki District), the town of Kawanishi, and the village of Nakasato (both from Nakauonuma District), was merged into the expanded city of Tōkamachi. It is located in the southeastern portion of the city.

Matsunoyama is home to one of the big three medicinal hot springs of Japan, along with Kusatsu (Gunma Prefecture) and Arima Onsen (Hyōgo Prefecture). One of the main roads in the town is lined with about a dozen traditional Japanese-style hot spring resorts, attracting many visitors.

==Climate==

Matsunoyama is also famous for the massive amount of snowfall it receives, with 2 to 3 meters on average during the severe winter months.

==History==
According to legend, a woodcutter discovered the hot springs 700 years ago when he saw a hawk resting its injured wing in it. It has also been told that the daughter of Uesugi Fusayoshi (the 15th century governor of Echigo Province, current Niigata Prefecture, :ja:上杉房能) cured her skin disease by soaking in the hot springs.

<text>Hans-Emil Lau (16 April 1879 – 16 October 1918) was a Danish astronomer.

He started his observational career during his studies at Copenhagen University. After completing his degree in 1906 he worked at the Urania, the Treptow Observatory at Berlin, and finally at Horsholm Observatory in Copenhagen.

He is most famous for his work on Mars and Jupiter. He also worked on star parallax, the measuring of variable stars, the color of stars, and the observation of comets, sunspots, and the rings of Saturn.

He published speculative orbits of two trans-Neptunian planets in 1900, which were never found.

He died prematurely at the age of 39 during the worldwide 1918 flu pandemic. A crater on Mars was named in his honor.

<doc id="862249" wikidata="Q1088788" url="?curid=862249" title="Chrysler TC by Maserati">
<text>The Chrysler TC by Maserati is a jointly developed car by Chrysler and Maserati. It was positioned as a grand tourer and introduced at the 1986 Los Angeles Auto Show. It is a &quot;Q&quot; body built on a modified second-generation Chrysler K platform. After two years of development delays, the TC became available in late-1988 and a total of 7,300 units (the minimum required under the contract) were manufactured in Milan, Italy, through 1990. All cars sold as 1991 models were manufactured in 1990.

==Development==
Lee Iacocca started a friendship with Alejandro de Tomaso while at Ford, which led to the De Tomaso Pantera, which had flopped because of safety concerns and limited interest from buyers. During the 1980s, Iacocca headed Chrysler while De Tomaso was the owner of the historic Maserati brand. In 1983, Iacocca had considered manufacturing a knock-off of a Mercedes roadster based on a Plymouth Reliant-until he was talked out of it. 

In 1984, both companies signed a memorandum of understanding to create a sports coupe that ultimately became the TC, or &quot;turbocharged coupe&quot;, an &quot;image builder&quot; which carried the hopes that it might help overcome Chrysler&#x27;s blue-collar image and attract better-heeled customers to showrooms, and a revival of the luxury reputation they enjoyed during the late 1950s to mid-1960s with the Chrysler 300 letter series coupes and convertibles. 

Chrysler also became an investor in Maserati during that period. In 1985, Lee Iacocca stated that the planned &quot;Q-coupe&quot; would be the prettiest Italian to arrive stateside since his mother immigrated. The luxury roadster, which resembled a Chrysler LeBaron—it shared many of the LeBaron&#x27;s components—had taken five years to complete because of mismanagement and squabbling among Chrysler and Maserati engineers which resulted in delay after delay. The original plan was for the TC to be introduced before the LeBaron.

The 1989 TC used a slightly detuned Daytona-spec turbocharged 2.2 L straight-4. This intercooled version, known as the Turbo II, was coupled to an A413 three-speed automatic transaxle. The Turbo II was replaced by a Mitsubishi-sourced 3.0 L V6 engine for the 1990 and 1991 model years, with the automatic transaxle being upgraded to a four-speed A604 unit.

500 cars were built with an optional drivetrain consisting of a Getrag manual transmission and a 16-valve head version of the 2.2 L. This engine is often called the &quot;Maserati&quot; engine because it was assembled by Maserati and has a Maserati-branded cast valve cover.

The 16-valve 2.2 L &quot;Maserati&quot; engine&#x27;s cylinder head was cast in England by Cosworth and finished in Italy by Maserati. The pistons came from Mahle GmbH in Germany. The camshafts were designed by Florida-based Crane Cams and were manufactured by Maserati in Modena. The &quot;Maserati&quot; engine used a specially-made 2.2 block, upgraded crankshaft, and rods. A Japanese turbocharger was sourced from IHI. The rest of the engine used Turbo II parts made in the United States.

The TC&#x27;s platform was based on a shortened Dodge Daytona chassis with suspension and axles from the original model (except for the 5-speed Getrag with &quot;Maserati&quot; engine). The bodywork was produced by De Tomaso subsidiary Innocenti. The struts and shock absorbers were specially designed for the car by Fichtel and Sachs, and a Teves anti-lock braking system was standard. The special wheels were made in Italy by the Formula One supplier Fondmetal.

After every other Chrysler executive insisted that the TC was hopeless and should be written off, Iacocca refused to accept responsibility for its failure saying it might have worked if his marketers had &quot;positioned&quot; it properly. According to Bob Lutz, a Chrysler executive, the partnership with Alejandro de Tomaso resulted in only the TC, a &quot;misadventure&quot; that wound up costing Chrysler &quot;close to $600 million.&quot; That is, the cost to produce each of the 7,300 TCs was about $80,000 in 1990 dollars ($ in dollars ).

==Features==
The TC featured a detachable hard top with circular, beveled-glass opera windows with a six-point latching system and a manually operated cloth lined convertible top that was available in either tan or black. For the 1989 model year, interior leather colors were ginger or bordeaux. Available exterior colors were yellow, red, or cabernet. The bordeaux interior was only available with the cabernet exterior, both of which were dropped in 1990 when black and white exterior colors were added along with a black leather interior.

The TC&#x27;s dash, door panels, seats, armrest, and rear fascia panels were covered in hand-stitched Italian leather. Inside doorjambs were finished with stainless steel panels and sill plates. The convertible boot, over which the hardtop rests, is a body-colored metal panel. A special interior storage compartment came with an umbrella, tool kit, and small spare tire that allowed the use of the full-sized trunk even with the top down. Standard equipment included a 10-speaker Infinity AM/FM cassette stereo, power windows, 6-way power seats, power door and trunk locks, map lights, puddle lamps, cruise control, and a tilt steering wheel.

The only extra cost option available for the TC was a CD player that was a plug-in attachment to the standard Infinity AM/FM cassette stereo. All drivetrain alternatives were no-cost options.

A unique TC was built as a &quot;special order&quot; at the end of the production run for a Chrysler executive. It was white with a bordeaux interior and the Maserati 16V engine, the only 1991 car to have that color interior or engine.

==Production and prices==

Total production and base price for each model year. The TC was sold by 300 select Chrysler dealers.

==Competition==
During the TC&#x27;s three-year run, General Motors was offering two luxury roadsters. The Cadillac Allanté (1987–93), which was priced significantly higher than the TC, and the Buick Reatta convertible (1990–91) which was priced similarly to the TC. The Allanté was also Italian-designed and partially hand-built.

The Allanté was powered by a 4.5 L V8 engine during the years the TC was sold (1989–91) with final assembly in the U.S. after the bodies built in Italy were shipped via special air cargo, while the Reatta was a 3.8 L V6-powered roadster.

==Criticism and aftermath==
The original idea of combining a Chrysler engine with a Maserati body was viewed by some automotive journalists as &quot;taking the worst from each partner.&quot; The press was critical of the Chrysler TC, observing its similarity to the Chrysler LeBaron GTC convertible that cost much less. Lee Iacocca was a proponent of the new model &quot;to change the way the world looked at Chrysler&quot; and to create a new image for the automaker. Though the TC was expected to achieve annual sales between 5,000 and 10,000 units, it sold very poorly due its high price tag among other factors such as the lack of exterior color choices and undistinguished performance. In contrast, the LeBaron GTC had more color choices and exactly the same features at a considerably lower price. A genuine European luxury car could be purchased for not much more than the Chrysler TC, reviewers pointed out. One expert on the Chrysler TCs claims that the automaker under Iacocca invested millions into Maserati, &quot;but the Italian firm just did not deliver as promised&quot; and the automobile marketplace had changed by the time the cars were delivered.

Subsequent to TC production, Chrysler and Maserati eventually had common corporate ownership, as Fiat would takeover Maserati in 1993, followed by a takeover of Chrysler in 2013.

<text>Thomas Cooke (8 March 1807 – 19 October 1868) was a British scientific instrument maker based in York. He founded T. Cooke &amp; Sons, the scientific instrument company.

==Life==
Thomas Cooke was born in Allerthorpe, near Pocklington, East Riding of Yorkshire, the son of James Cook (a shoemaker).
His formal education consisted of two years at an elementary school (possibly the school of John Whitaker, also of Allerthorpe), but he continued learning after this and he taught himself navigation and astronomy with the intention of becoming a sailor. His mother dissuaded him from that career and he became a teacher. He made such a success of being an impromptu teacher to the farmers’ sons of the Pocklington district, that only a year later he was able to open a village school at Bielby. He continued to teach others by day and learn himself by night, and soon moved his school from Bielby to Skirpenbeck.

At Skirpenbeck he met his future wife, who was one of his pupils, and five years his junior. Fifty years on she spoke of how her husband developed his brief rudimentary education into becoming a schoolmaster: “He first learned mathematics by buying an old volume from a bookstall with a spare shilling. He also got odd sheets, and read books about geometry and mathematics, before he could buy them; for he had very little to spare”.

But Cooke&#x27;s interest in mathematics and science was practical as well academic. He had also retained his interest in navigation and instruments, and while at Skirpenbeck he made his own first rudimentary telescope – grinding a lens by hand out of the bottom of a glass whisky tumbler, then mounting in into a frame that he soldered together from a piece of tin. In 1829 he moved to York and worked as a mathematics schoolmaster at the Rev. Schackley&#x27;s School in Ogleforth, near York Minster. He also taught in various ladies&#x27; schools to increase his income.

His marriage to Hannah was to produce seven children, five of whom were boys. Two of these Charles Frederick (1836–98) and Thomas (1839–1919) subsequently joined him in the business he founded in 1836 at number 50 (now renumbered to 18) Stonegate, close to York Minster with the assistance of a loan of £100 from his wife&#x27;s uncle.

Cooke studied optics and became interested in making telescopes, the first of which was a refracting telescope with the base of a tumbler shaped to form its lens. This led to his friends including John Phillips encouraging him to make telescopes and other optical devices commercially.

==Work==
In 1837 he established his first optical business in a small shop at 50 Stonegate, York, and later moved to larger premises in Coney Street. He built his first telescope for William Gray. At that time, the excise tax on glass discouraged the making of refracting telescopes, which were usually imported from abroad. Cooke was thus one of the pioneers of making such telescopes in Britain.

He made more instruments and built his reputation. He was not only an optician but had mechanical abilities as well, and among other things, manufactured turret clocks for church towers. He founded the firm T. Cooke &amp; Sons. In 1855 he moved to bigger premises, the Buckingham Works at Bishophill in York, where factory methods of production were first applied to optical instruments. He exhibited at the York Exhibition in 1866 demonstrating his three-wheeled, steam-powered car which he claimed could carry 15 people at 15 mph for a distance of 40 miles.

One of his finest achievements was the construction of the 25-inch &#x27;Newall&#x27; refractor for Robert Stirling Newall; sadly, Thomas died before seeing it completed. For some years the Newall was the largest refracting telescope in the world. On Newall&#x27;s death it was donated to the Cambridge Observatory and finally moved in 1959 to Mount Penteli observatory in Penteli, Greece. He made a telescope for the Royal Observatory, also Greenwich and another for Prince Albert. The firm amalgamated with Troughton &amp; Simms (London) to become Cooke, Troughton &amp; Simms in 1922 and this later became part of Vickers, but still run by his sons Thomas &amp; Frederick.

Thomas Cooke was succeeded by his sons, Thomas and Frederick. He is buried in York Cemetery.

==Telescopes in use today==

*A telescope made by Thomas Cooke is still in daily use at Carter Observatory – The National Observatory of New Zealand, delivering excellent results. The original 9-inch triplet lens has been replaced by a 9 1/2 doublet made by renowned optician Garry Nankivell.
*At the observatory in the Museum Gardens, York there is a working 4-inch telescope, built for the Yorkshire Philosophical Society in 1850. A second unit of the same construction was purchased and installed in the observatory at Bootham School, York in 1854. A third matching instrument, dating from the same period, was donated to Friendsʼ School, Hobart in 1974 by the grandson of Jonathan Backhouse Hodgkin. All three instruments remain in active service.
*A 5&quot; refractor dating from 1883 is still in use at Coats Observatory, Paisley, Scotland.
*A 5&quot; refractor dating from 1880 is still in regular use at Clanfield Observatory, Hampshire.
*There is a 6&quot; Cooke telescope in the Airdrie Public Observatory, Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, Scotland run by the Airdrie Astronomical Association.
* A 6” Cooke refractor is the main telescope in use at the Hampstead Observatory in London. Known as the ’Wildey telescope’ (in tribute to renowned master optician, Henry Wildey), the telescope can be used by the public on the observatory&#x27;s open nights (most Friday and Saturdays).
* There is a 6&quot; Cooke telescope in use at the Baxendell Observatory in Hesketh Park, Southport
* A 6&quot; Cooke refractor exists in the 1929 observatory of the University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada,
* A 6.25&quot; refractor known as the &#x27;Lockyer Telescope&#x27; is in use at the Norman Lockyer Observatory in Sidmouth, Devon, UK. The lens, made by Cooke, was first used in 1865 in a telescope built by Norman Lockyer. Cooke later rebuilt the telescope in its present form in 1871. The telescope was positioned in several locations before being moved to Sidmouth in 1912, where it remains. Lockyer used this telescope to discover helium in the solar corona. It was restored in 1995 and is now used mainly for public-outreach.
*A 6.5&quot; refractor manufactured in 1870 is in use at the Assheton Observatory at Rossall School.
*A 6.5&quot; refractor manufactured in 1876 is in use at the Astronomic Observatory of the Odessa National University in Odessa, Ukraine.
*An 8&quot; refractor dating from 1864, known as the Thorrowgood Telescope belongs to the Royal Astronomical Society and is operated at the Cambridge Observatory.
*An 8&quot; refractor is housed in the Jeremiah Horrocks Observatory, Moor Park, Preston, Lancashire.
*The Fry telescope, an 8&quot; refractor manufactured in 1862, is in regular use at the University of London Observatory in Mill Hill, London.
*A 10&quot; refractor from 1860 is in use at the Blackett Observatory, Wiltshire.
*A 10&quot; refractor from 1871, which was purchased by St. Andrews in 1938 and used as a training telescope, has been in use since 1951 at Mills Observatory, Dundee, Scotland.
*A 15,5&quot; refractor (F/15 focal length ) made by Thomas Cooke is part of the historical collection of the INAF-Astronomical Observatory of Abruzzo. Manufactured in England in 1885, the Cooke telescope was purchased by Director Vincenzo Cerulli and transported to the then Collurania Observatory around 1890. This telescope is still equipped with the original optomechanical components. It is currently used during evening visits open to the public for observations of Solar System objects and bright targets in the Messier catalogue (globular clusters, nebulae, and so on). The instrument was perfectly successful from an optical point of view due to the clarity of its objective and the remarkable resolving power. The Cooke telescope is housed inside the dome of the main pavilion of the Observatory: the hemispherical dome was built by the Cooke House of York in 1885, with a diameter of 31 ft, manual movements, iron frame and paper-machè cover (pressed cardboard). The telescope and the dome were purchased second-hand by Cerulli, having already been used in Scarborough (North Yorkshire) by the first owner, the astronomer James Wigglesworth.
*A 18&quot; refractor was acquired by National Observatory (Brazil) in 1911 but only setup on 1922 due to World War I. It is the largest refractor in Brazil and it is used for outreach nowadays. 
*A 25&quot; refractor from 1869 &quot;Newall Telescope&quot; is in use at the National Observatory of Athens, Penteli, Greece

<text>Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau (1 July 1725 – 10 May 1807) was a French Royal Army officer who played a critical role in the Franco-American victory at the siege of Yorktown in 1781 during the American Revolutionary War. He was commander-in-chief of the &quot;Expédition Particulière&quot;, the French expeditionary force sent to North American during the conflict.

==Military life==
Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur was born in Vendôme, in the province of Orléanais, and he was educated at the Jesuit college in Blois. After the death of his elder brother, he entered a cavalry regiment and served in Bohemia, Bavaria, and on the Rhine during the War of the Austrian Succession. By 1747, he had attained the rank of colonel. He took part in the Siege of Maastricht and became governor of Vendôme in 1749. He distinguished himself in the Battle of Minorca on the outbreak of the Seven Years&#x27; War and was promoted to brigadier general of infantry. In 1758, he fought in Germany, notably in the Battle of Krefeld and the Battle of Clostercamp, receiving several wounds at Clostercamp.

==American Revolution==
In 1780, Rochambeau was appointed commander of land forces as part of the project code-named &quot;Expédition Particulière&quot;. He was given the rank of lieutenant general in command of 7,000 French troops and sent to join the Continental Army under George Washington during the American Revolutionary War. Axel von Fersen the Younger served as his aide-de-camp and interpreter. The small size of the force at his disposal made him initially reluctant to lead the expedition.

He landed at Newport, Rhode Island, on 10 July but was held there inactive for a year because he did not want to abandon the French fleet blockaded by the British in Narragansett Bay. The college in the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (now Brown University) served as an encampment site for some of Rochambeau&#x27;s troops. The college edifice was converted into a military hospital, now known as University Hall. In July 1781, the force left Rhode Island and marched across Connecticut to join Washington on the Hudson River in Mount Kisco, New York. The Odell farm served as Rochambeau&#x27;s headquarters from 6 July to 18 August 1781.

Washington and Rochambeau then marched their combined forces to the Siege of Yorktown and the Battle of the Chesapeake. On 22 September they combined with the Marquis de Lafayette&#x27;s troops and forced Lord Cornwallis to surrender on 19 October. The Congress of the Confederation presented Rochambeau with two cannons taken from the British in recognition of his service. He returned them to Vendôme, and they were requisitioned in 1792.

==Return to France==
Upon his return to France, Rochambeau was honored by King Louis XVI and was made governor of the province of Picardy. He supported the French Revolution of 1789, and on 28 December 1791 he and Nicolas Luckner became the last two generals created Marshal of France by Louis XVI.

When the French Revolutionary Wars broke out, he commanded the &quot;Armée du Nord&quot; for a time in 1792 but resigned after several reversals to the Austrians. He was arrested during the Reign of Terror in 1793–94 and imprisoned in the Conciergerie. He narrowly avoided the guillotine, with his execution being scheduled mere days away when the Thermidorian Reaction occurred, ending the Reign of Terror.

==Later life and death==
After his imprisonment and subsequent release, Rochambeau was pensioned after meeting Napoleon in 1801 and later received the Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1804 after Napoleon&#x27;s ascension to emperor. Rochambeau died in 1807 at Thoré-la-Rochette during the First French Empire. His son Donatien was also a French general.

==Legacy==

===Honors===
President Theodore Roosevelt unveiled a statue of Rochambeau by Ferdinand Hamar as a gift from France to the United States on 24 May 1902, standing in Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C. The ceremony was a great demonstration of friendship between the two nations. France was represented by ambassador Jules Cambon, Admiral Fournier, General Henri Brugère, and a detachment of sailors and marines from the battleship &quot;Gaulois&quot;. Representatives of the Lafayette and Rochambeau families also attended. A &quot;Rochambeau fête&quot; was held simultaneously in Paris. In 1934, A. Kingsley Macomber donated a statue of Rochambeau to Newport, Rhode Island. The sculpture is a replica of a statue in Paris. There is a Rochambeau monument at French Hill in Marion, Connecticut, close to the Asa Barnes Tavern, the eighth campsite of his troops through Connecticut in 1781.

The French Navy gave his name to the ironclad frigate &quot;Rochambeau&quot;. was a transport ship that saw service in the United States Navy during World War II. President Barak Obama signed the Omnibus Public Land Management Act in 2009 with a provision to designate the Washington–Rochambeau Revolutionary Route as a national historic trail. A bridge was named for Rochambeau in the complex of bridges known as the 14th Street Bridge (Potomac River) connecting Washington, D.C., with Virginia. A mansion on the campus of Brown University is named Rochambeau House and houses the French Department.

===Memoirs===
Rochambeau&#x27;s &quot;Mémoires militaires, historiques et politiques, de Rochambeau&quot; was published by Jean-Charles-Julien Luce de Lancival in 1809. Part of the first volume was translated into English and published in 1838 under the title &quot;Memoirs of the Marshal Count de R. relative to the War of Independence in the United States&quot;. His correspondence during the American campaign was published in 1892 in H. Doniol&#x27;s &quot;History of French Participation in the Establishment of the United States.&quot;

<text>T. Cooke &amp; Sons was an English instrument-making firm, headquartered in York. It was founded by Thomas Cooke by 1837.

==History==

In 1837 Cooke leased a shop at 50 Stonegate, York, with his wife running the shop and Cooke&#x27;s workshop occupying the rear where he made and repaired whatever instruments were needed. He made a screw-cutting lathe for his own use. A notable instrument made at this time was a 4.5 inch equatorial refracting telescope. Cooke himself made the whole instrument including the optical elements at a time when most instrument makers specialised in making either the optical or mechanical components.

The 1851 census shows that Cooke employed four men and an apprentice. In 1855 Cooke exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris and won a First Class Medal for a 7.5 inch equatorial refractor. 
By 1855 Thomas Cooke had built a factory at Bishophill in York.

In 1864 Cooke undertook his first order for surveying equipment when he built 16 theodolites to be sent to India. On arrival they were found to be very well made except that the circle division was faulty. They were returned to York and redivided. By 1870 The Survey of India used Cooke levels for the primary survey in preference to Troughton &amp; Simms products as they considered them to be superior.

Following the death of Cooke in 1868, the business was continued by his sons.

The firm built the clock face on the Darlington clock tower. Cooke &amp; Sons also provided a 12 inch theodolite for the construction of the Forth Railway Bridge. Observatory domes were also made using papier-maché including in 1883 one for Greenwich Observatory.

In 1892 Dennis Taylor, working to reduce chromatic aberration, invented a three element lens design incorporating a new Schott glass element. This design was called a &#x27;photo-visual&#x27; design and used for both visual and photographic astronomy. Taylor became Optical Manager at the firm in 1893.

Six lightweight theodolites were made for Scott&#x27;s ill-fated Terra Nova Expedition of 1910-1913.

Dennis Taylor modified his three element lens design for photographic purposes, patenting his work in 1905 and 1906. This &#x27;Cooke Triplet&#x27; lens design was an improvement on most camera lenses of the time though it was in competition with the 1902 Zeiss Tessar design. In 1904 Taylor discovered that a tarnished surface layer could reduce reflections from glass surfaces. Although this effect had been discovered by Lord Rayleigh in 1886 the use of lens coatings was not widely known.

With war looming the firm began to work with Arthur Pollen on his &#x27;Aim Correction&#x27; system for improving the accuracy of naval gunnery. Cooke &amp; Sons supplied the optical components for the system which consisted of a gyroscopically stabilised rangefinder where successive readings of a moving target were mechanically integrated to give a prediction of range and bearing. In the event the British Admiralty for the most part chose the simpler and cheaper Dreyer predictor.

In 1914, a new factory was built in Bishophill. In 1915 Vickers acquired a controlling stake in the company. During World War I about half of the factory&#x27;s capacity was turned over to contracts for large naval rangefinders from the main contractor, Barr &amp; Stroud

In 1922 Vickers merged it with Troughton &amp; Simms to form Cooke, Troughton &amp; Simms.

<text>Scarborough is a major town of the island of Tobago as well as the eleventh-most-populous in Trinidad and Tobago. Scarborough was the capital of Tobago in 1769 before it was unified with Trinidad changing the capital to Port of Spain. Situated in western Tobago, Scarborough is the economic and cultural centre of the island of Tobago. The estimated population in 2011 was 17,537. Scarborough is ranked as one of Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s most densely populated towns alongside Port of Spain, San Fernando, Chaguanas and Arima. The town&#x27;s skyline is dominated by Fort King George, an 18th-century fortification named after King George III, which now hosts a historic and archaeologic museum. Scarborough&#x27;s deepwater harbour was built in 1991; before that ships were forced to anchor offshore.

==Facilities==
Shaw Park Cultural Complex is the largest performing arts theatre in the Caribbean. The facility has a capacity in its main hall of over 5000 as well as a conference and lecture halls.
The town has a library completed in 2012, and Scarborough General Hospital was completed in 2014.

<doc id="862267" wikidata="Q7846543" url="?curid=862267" title="Troughton &amp; Simms">
<text>Troughton &amp; Simms was a British scientific instrument firm. It was formed when Edward Troughton in his old age took on William Simms as a partner in 1826. It became a limited company in 1915 and in 1922 it merged with T. Cooke &amp; Sons to form Cooke, Troughton &amp; Simms.

The firm had its origins in the instrument-making business begun in 1764 by John Troughton (1716-1788). This business was successively passed down first to nephews, John Troughton (1739-1807) and then to Edward Troughton (1756-1835). In 1826 Edward Troughton took on William Simms as partner. 

==Origins==
In 1756, John Troughton Senior from Corney, Cumberland, set up business in London, having completed his apprenticeship with London instrument maker Thomas Heath.

In 1769, his nephew John Troughton Junior, after completing his apprenticeship with his uncle, set up in business for himself. He took over the business of Benjamin Cole in 1782, a maker of orreries at a shop in Fleet Street called &quot;At the Sign of The Orrery&quot;. His work at that time was mostly providing a service to other craftsmen in the difficult skill of dividing circles by hand for navigation, surveying and astronomical instruments. In 1789, he took his brother Edward Troughton into partnership.

The Board of Longitude was wound up in 1828, but the Board of Ordnance (now Ordnance Survey) started work on the Triangulation of Britain in 1791. This was reflected in the change in Troughton&#x27;s work away from astronomical and navigational towards terrestrial surveying.

William Simms completed his goldsmithing apprenticeship in 1815 and set up business as a maker of marine compasses. In about 1825, he was asked to repair and re-divide an astronomical circle made by Troughton. Having completed this work, he wrote a paper for Edward Troughton describing his new method of dividing which was more accurate than an engine and quicker than using a roller. Edward Troughton took on William Simms as a partner in 1826.

Notable Troughton instruments from this period include the Equatorial telescope at Armagh Observatory (1795), the Mural circle at Greenwich Royal Observatory (1812), and the Transit telescope at Greenwich Royal Observatory (1816).

==Troughton &amp; Simms during the Industrial Revolution==
In 1828, George Everest returned from India and asked Simms to repair instruments used for the Survey of India. To try to make his theodolites less susceptible to field conditions Everest proposed a new pattern with a lower centre of gravity.

In 1834, the Houses of Parliament burned down so a new set of national standards of length were commissioned. In 1835 George Airy became Astronomer Royal and commissioned new instruments. Large castings were contracted to Maudslay and Ransomes. Optical parts were often supplied by Dollond.

From about 1830 to 1850 Britain was gripped by Railway Mania resulting in high demand for levels and theodolites. Troughton &amp; Simms exhibited at the Great Exhibition in 1851.

William Simms died in 1860 and the firm took William Simms Junior and his cousin James into partnership. Optical glass technology allowed larger lenses to be made and these were sourced from French and German makers such as Guinand and Merz.

In 1866, a transit and spectroscope were ordered by Harvard College Observatory and delivered in 1870. Slow delivery appears to have happened a lot and seems to have been partly due to insistence on precision but also the volume of business being undertaken.

In 1860, Troughton &amp; Simms opened a new works at Charlton. There were many requests from around the world for standard measure bars, and in 1876, they supplied the Imperial Standards Of Length gauges mounted at Trafalgar Square and the Greenwich Royal Observatory.

The firm produced hundreds of astronomical instruments such as mural circles, transit circles, sextants, and other astronomical instruments for observatories around the world.
Towards the end of this period other countries such as France, Germany and the United States were able to make instruments themselves so Troughton &amp; Simms made more of their product for the British market.

Notable instruments from this period include the Troughton &amp; Simms Altazimuth Refractor (1847) at Greenwich Royal Observatory and the Troughton &amp; Simms Astronomical Telescope (1880) for Tokyo Astronomical Observatory.

==Troughton &amp; Simms in the late 19th and early 20th centuries==
By 1887, Troughton &amp; Simms employed 200 people at their Charlton works. Military production began to be important with production of coincidence rangefinders for the British government. Among their clients were the Italian Navy, the Russian government and the Austro-Hungarian Hydrographic Department Observatory. Undated advertisements from this period include the claim that &quot;in fifteen years our output of levels and theodolites alone was 23,000&quot;. An indication of their worldwide sales is how often instruments appear all around the world.

Troughton &amp; Simms did not normally place serial numbers on their products, so dating them is inexact. The &quot;Troughton &amp; Simms&quot; name was originally engraved in a copperplate font, which later changed to a much simpler font. In 1915 James Simms died and the business passed to his sons. They made the company into a limited liability company. After 1915, the company name found on their products is &quot;Troughton &amp; Simms Ltd&quot;. After the First World War, business and long-term prospects were poor, and in 1922 Troughton &amp; Simms was bought by T. Cooke &amp; Sons of York to become Cooke, Troughton &amp; Simms.

Notable instruments from this period include a typical late 6-inch theodolite for use by engineers and surveyors and a typical late surveyors level, which can be dated to before 1915 by the lack of &quot;Ltd&quot; after &quot;Troughton &amp; Simms&quot;.

<text>Atar, Atash, Azar () or Dāštāɣni, is the Zoroastrian concept of holy fire, sometimes described in abstract terms as &quot;burning and unburning fire&quot; or &quot;visible and invisible fire&quot; (Mirza, 1987:389). It is considered to be the visible presence of Ahura Mazda and his Asha through the eponymous Yazata. The rituals for purifying a fire are performed 1,128 times a year.

In the Avestan language, &quot;ātar&quot; is an attribute of sources of heat and light, of which the nominative singular form is &quot;ātarš&quot;, source of Persian &quot;ātaš&quot; (fire). It was once thought to be etymologically related to the Avestan &quot;āθrauuan&quot; / &quot;aθaurun&quot; (Vedic &quot;atharvan&quot;), a type of priest, but that is now considered unlikely (Boyce, 2002:16). The ultimate etymology of &quot;ātar&quot;, previously unknown (Boyce, 2002:1), is now believed to be from the Indo-European *hxehxtr- &#x27;fire&#x27;. This would make it a cognate to Latin &quot;&quot; (black) and to Albanian &quot;vatër&quot; (definite form: &quot;vatra&quot;) &quot;hearth&quot;, &quot;fireplace&quot;, which was loaned to Romanian &quot;vatră&quot; &quot;hearth&quot;, &quot;fireplace&quot;, and thereafter spread to Serbo-Croat &quot;vatra&quot; &quot;fire&quot; and Ukrainian &quot;vatra&quot; &quot;bonfire&quot;.

In later Zoroastrianism, &quot;ātar&quot; (Middle Persian: 𐭠𐭲𐭥𐭥𐭩 &quot;ādar&quot; or &quot;ādur&quot;) is iconographically conflated with fire itself, which in Middle Persian is 𐭠𐭲𐭧𐭱 &quot;ātaxsh&quot;, one of the primary objects of Zoroastrian symbolism.

==In scripture==

===In the Gathic texts===
&quot;Atar&quot; is already evident in the Gathas, the oldest texts of the compendium of the Avesta and believed to have been composed by Zoroaster himself. At this juncture, as in the &quot;Yasna Haptanghaiti&quot; (the seven-chapter Yasna that structurally interrupts the Gathas and is linguistically as old as the Gathas themselves), &quot;atar&quot; is still—with only one exception—an abstract concept simply an instrument, a medium, of the Creator and is not yet the divinity (&quot;yazata&quot;) of heat and light that &quot;atar&quot; was to become in the later texts.

In the most ancient texts, &quot;atar&quot; is a medium, a faculty, through which judgement is passed and reflects the pre-Zoroastrian institution of ordeal by heat (Avestan: &quot;garmo-varah&quot;, heat ordeal; &quot;cf.&quot; Boyce 1996:ch. 6). Justice is administered through &quot;atar&quot; (&quot;Yasna&quot; 31.3, 34.4, 36.2, 47.2), the blazing &quot;atar&quot; (31.19, 51.9), through the heat of &quot;atar&quot; (43.4), through the blazing, shining, molten metal (&quot;ayangha Khshushta&quot;, 30.7, 32.7, 51.9). An individual who has passed the fiery test, has attained physical and spiritual strength, wisdom, truth and love with serenity (30.7). However, among all the references to &quot;atar&quot; in the oldest texts, it is only once addressed independently of Ahura Mazda. In this exception, &quot;atar&quot; is spoken of in the third person masculine singular: &quot;He detects sinners by hand-grasping&quot; (&quot;Yasna&quot; 34.4). Altogether, &quot;there are said to have been some 30 kinds of fiery tests in all.&quot; (Boyce, 2002:1)

Also in the early texts, tangential to its role in establishing guilt, &quot;atar&quot; is the light of revelation through which Zoroaster is selected by Ahura Mazda, the &quot;Zarathushtra Mainyu Athra&quot; (&quot;Yasna&quot; 31.3), radiated by Ahura Mazda (43.9), bearing the conviction of &quot;Good Purpose&quot; (&quot;Vohu Manah&quot;, 43.4; see also Amesha Spenta), and enlightening one&#x27;s inner-self (46.7). Within this framework of the concept of divine illumination, &quot;atar&quot; radiates the &quot;other lights&quot; (31.7), the essence (of Ahura Mazda) from which insight and wisdom permeate the universe. So also Zoroaster&#x27;s injunction to always pray in the presence of &quot;atar&quot;—either towards the sun, or towards their own hearths—so as to better concentrate their devotions on &quot;asha&quot;, righteousness, and the virtue that should be striven for (&quot;Yasna&quot; 43.9, see also Boyce, 1975:455).

===In later texts===

The Gathic role of &quot;atar&quot; as the medium for detecting guilt is not directly evident in the later texts of the Avesta, but reappears in modified form as an allegory of burning and annihilating the Angra Mainyu through righteousness, &quot;where Asha Vahishta is identified at times with the household fire on the hearth.&quot; There, &quot;identification in the realms of matter and of spirit serves only to bring more into prominence the main tenets of Zoroaster&#x27;s teachings in regard to Asha&quot; (Dhalla, 1938:170). A vestige of the ancient institution of ordeal by heat is nonetheless present in &quot;Vendidad&quot; 4.54–55, where speaking against the truth and violating the sanctity of promise is punishable by flogging and is detected by the consumption of &quot;water, blazing, of golden color, having the power to detect guilt.&quot; The &quot;Zend&quot; translation/commentary on this passage translates &quot;blazing&quot; as &quot;having brimstone and sulphur&quot;, and notes that innocence or guilt was established by the consumption of this &quot;guilt-detecting liquid&quot;. Similarly, in the &quot;Denkard&quot;, Adharbad Maraspand—the Sassanid era high-priest to whom the collation of the Avesta texts is attributed—is purported to have nine measures of &quot;unburning molten zinc&quot; applied to his chest as proof of accuracy of the sacred texts.

Seen chronologically, the transition from &quot;atar&quot; as a vehicle of judgement to &quot;Atar Yazata&quot; the divinity presiding over blazing fire is abrupt. While the older Gathic Avestan texts have heat (and thus fire) associated with harsh judgement, the Younger Avestan texts have the divinity &quot;Atar&quot; completely representing and being represented by fire itself; and associated with warmth and light and essential for growth. &quot;Asha Vahishta&quot;&#x27;s association with &quot;atar&quot; is however carried forward, and they are often mentioned together (&quot;Yasna&quot; 62.3, &quot;Nyashes&quot; 5.9, etc.). So also in their roles as protectors, for &quot;when the Evil Spirit assailed the creation of Good Truth, Good Thought and Fire intervened&quot; (&quot;Yasht&quot; 13.77)

It is in the later texts that &quot;Atar&quot; is personified as &quot;the son&quot; of Ahura Mazda (standard appellation, &quot;Yasna&quot; 25.7 et al.) and is addressed as &quot;full of glory and full of healing remedies&quot; (&quot;Nyash&quot; 5.6). In &quot;Yasna&quot; 17.11, &quot;Atar&quot; is &quot;master of the house&quot;, recalling the role of the hearth fire in the Gathas. The same passage enumerates the &quot;five kinds of fire&quot;:
# &quot;atar berezi-savah&quot;, &quot;the highly beneficent &quot;atar&quot;&quot;, qualified in &quot;Zend&quot; texts as &quot;the fire that eats food but drinks no water&quot;, and the kind of fire that burns in an &quot;Atash-Behram&quot;, the highest grade of fire temple.
# &quot;atar vohu-fryana&quot;, &quot;the &quot;atar&quot; of good affection&quot;, cognate with bhaga and friend), later qualified as &quot;the fire diffusing goodness&quot;, and &quot;the fire that consumes both water and food&quot;.
# &quot;atar urvazishta&quot;, &quot;the &quot;atar&quot; of greatest bliss&quot;, later qualified as &quot;the fire of happy life&quot;, and &quot;the fire that drinks water but eats no food&quot;.
# &quot;atar vazishta&quot;, &quot;the &quot;atar&quot; most swift&quot;, later qualified as the fire in clouds, i.e. lightning, and as &quot;the fire that neither drinks water nor eats food&quot;.
# &quot;atar spenishta&quot;, &quot;the &quot;atar&quot; most holy&quot;, cognate Balto-Slavic &quot;&quot; &quot;holy&quot;) ( described in &quot;Zend&quot; texts as &quot;the fire of prosperity&quot; and as the spiritual fire burning before Ohrmuzd.
The description of the fires in the Sassanid era commentaries (the &quot;Zend&quot; texts) differs slightly from those described in the &quot;Bundahishn&quot; (&quot;Original Creation&quot;, completed in the 11th or 12th century). In the latter, the description of the first and last kind of fire is reversed.

==In culture and tradition==
===As a divinity===
During the late Achaemenid era, &quot;adar&quot;—as the quintessence of the Yazata &quot;Adar&quot;—was incorporated in the Zoroastrian hierarchy of divinities. In that position, &quot;Adar&quot; aids &quot;Asha Vahishta&quot; (Avestan, Middle Persian: &quot;Ardvahisht&quot;), the Amesha Spenta responsible for the luminaries. From among the flowers associated with the Yazatas, &quot;Adar&quot;&#x27;s is the marigold (&quot;calendula&quot;) (&quot;Bundahishn&quot; 27.24).

The importance of the divinity &quot;Adar&quot; is evident from a dedication to the entity in the Zoroastrian calendar: &quot;Adar&quot; is one of the only five Yazatas that have a month-name dedication. Additionally, &quot;Adar&quot; is the name of the ninth day of the month in the Zoroastrian religious calendar, and the ninth month of the year of the civil Iranian calendar of 1925 (modern Persian: &quot;Azar&quot;) which has month-names derived from those used by the Zoroastrian calendar.

In Zoroastrian cosmogony, &quot;Adar&quot; was the seventh of the seven creations of the material universe. It is only with &quot;Adar&quot;&#x27;s assistance, who serves as the life-force, that the other six creations begin their work (&quot;Bundahishn&quot; 3.7–8; more logically explained in &quot;Zatspram&quot; 3.77–83).

===The cult of fire===
Although Zoroastrians revere fire in any form, the temple fire is not literally for the reverence of fire, but together with clean water (see Aban), is an agent of ritual purity. Clean, white &quot;ash for the purification ceremonies [is] regarded as the basis of ritual life&quot;, which &quot;are essentially the rites proper to the tending of a domestic fire, for the temple cult is that of the hearth fire raised to a new solemnity&quot; (Boyce, 1975:455). For, &quot;the man who sacrifices unto fire with fuel in his hand, with the &quot;Baresman&quot; in his hand, with milk in his hand, with the mortar for crushing the branches of the sacred Haoma in his hand, is given happiness&quot; (&quot;Yasna&quot; 62.1; &quot;Nyashes&quot; 5.7) 

The Zoroastrian cult of fire is apparently much younger than Zoroastrianism itself and appears at approximately the same time as the shrine cult, first evident in the 4th century BCE (roughly contemporaneous with the introduction of &quot;Adar&quot; as a divinity). There is no allusion to a temple cult of fire in the Avesta proper, nor is there any old Persian language word for one. Moreover, Boyce suggests that the temple cult of fire was instituted in opposition to the image/shrine cult and &quot;no actual ruins of a fire temple have been identified from before the Parthian period&quot; (Boyce, 1975:454).

That the cult of fire was a doctrinal modification and absent from early Zoroastrianism is still evident in the later &quot;Atash Nyash&quot;: in the oldest passages of that liturgy, it is the hearth fire that speaks to &quot;all those for whom it cooks the evening and morning meal&quot;, which Boyce observes is not consistent with sanctified fire. The temple cult is an even later development: From Herodotus it is known that in the mid-5th century BCE the Zoroastrians worshipped to the open sky, ascending mounds to light their fires (&quot;The Histories&quot;, i.131). Strabo confirms this, noting that in the 6th century, the sanctuary at Zela in Cappadocia was an artificial mound, walled in, but open to the sky (&quot;Geographica&quot; XI.8.4.512).

By the Parthian era (250 BCE–226 CE), Zoroastrianism had in fact two kinds of places of worship: One, apparently called &quot;bagin&quot; or &quot;ayazan&quot;, sanctuaries dedicated to a specific divinity, constructed in honor of the patron Yazata of an individual or family and included an icon or effigy of the honored. The second were the &quot;atroshan&quot;, the &quot;places of burning fire&quot;, which as Boyce (1997:ch. 3) notes, became more and more prevalent as the iconoclastic movement gained support. Following the rise of the Sassanid dynasty, the shrines to the Yazatas continued to exist, with the statues—by law—either being abandoned as empty sanctuaries, or being replaced by fire altars (so also the popular shrines to Meher/Mithra which retained the name &quot;Darb-e Mehr&quot;—Mithra&#x27;s Gate—that is today one of the Zoroastrian technical terms for a fire temple).

Also, as Schippman observed (&quot;loc. Cit.&quot; Boyce, 1975:462), even during the Sassanid era (226–650 CE) there is no evidence that the fires were categorized according to their sanctity. &quot;It seems probable that there were virtually only two, namely the &quot;Atash-i Vahram&quot; [literally: &quot;victorious fire&quot;, later misunderstood to be the Fire of Bahram, see Gnoli, 2002:512] and the lesser &quot;Atash-i Adaran&quot;, or &#x27;Fire of Fires&#x27;, a parish fire, as it were, serving a village or town quarter&quot; (Boyce, 1975:462; Boyce 1966:63). Apparently, it was only in the &quot;Atash-i Vahram&quot; that fire was kept continuously burning, with the &quot;Adaran&quot; fires being annually relit. While the fires themselves had special names, the structures did not, and it has been suggested that &quot;the prosaic nature of the middle Persian names (&quot;kadag&quot;, &quot;man&quot;, and &quot;xanag&quot; are all words for an ordinary house) perhaps reflect a desire on the part of those who fostered the temple-cult [...] to keep it as close as possible in character to the age-old cult of the hearth-fire, and to discourage elaboration&quot; (Boyce, 2002:9).

The Indian Parsi-Zoroastrian practice of rendering the term &quot;athornan&quot; (derived from the Avestan language &quot;athravan&quot;) as &quot;fire-priest&quot; in the English language is based on the mistaken assumption that the &quot;athra*&quot; prefix derives from &quot;atar&quot; (Boyce, 2002:16–17). The term &quot;athravan&quot; does not appear in the Gathas, where a priest is a &quot;zaotar&quot;, and in its oldest attested use (&quot;Yasna&quot; 42.6) the term appears to be synonymous with &quot;missionary&quot;. In the later &quot;Yasht&quot; 13.94, Zoroaster himself is said to have been an &quot;athravan&quot;, which in this context could not be a reference to &quot;atar&quot; if a cult of fire and its associated priesthood did not yet exist in Zoroaster&#x27;s time. Thus, in all probability, &quot;the word athravan has a different derivation.&quot; (Boyce, 2002:17)

===In mythology and folklore===
In &quot;Vendidad&quot; 1, &quot;Adar&quot; battles Aži Dahāka, the great dragon of the sky.

In Ferdowsi&#x27;s Shahnameh, Hoshang, the grandson of the first man &quot;Gayomard&quot;, discovers fire in a rock. He recognizes it as the divine glory of Ahura Mazda, offers homage to it, and instructs his people to so as well. Also in the Shahnameh is the legend of Sevavash, who passes through &quot;the unburning fire&quot; as proof of his innocence.

===As a royal symbol===

During the Sassanid era (226–650 CE), the symbol of Fire plays much the same role that the winged sun Faravahar did during the Achaemenid period (648–330 BCE). Beginning with Ardashir I, the founder of the Sassanid Empire, many of the kings of the dynasty issued one or more coins with a symbol of Fire on the verso, and seals and bullae with the fire symbol were common. 

The first silver coins of the empire have helmeted busts of Ardashir I (&quot;r.&quot; 226–241) or his father Papak on the obverse (a figure of the ruling monarch on the obverse is consistent throughout the dynasty), with a representation of a fire altar, accompanied by the legend &quot;atash i artakhshir&quot;, &quot;Fire of Ardeshir&quot;, on the reverse. Ardashir&#x27;s son, Shapur I (&quot;r.&quot; 241–272), has much the same image but adds two attendants at the fire altar. On the coins of Hormizd I (also known as Ardashir II, &quot;r.&quot; 272–273), the emperor himself tends the fire with the help of an attendant. Bahram II (276–293) also appears himself, accompanied by what may be his queen and son. Narseh (&quot;r.&quot; 293–303) also attends the fire himself, this time alone. On the coins of Shapur III (&quot;r.&quot; 383–388), a divinity appears to be emerging from the fire. The shape of the fire altar in the coins of Yazdegerd II (&quot;r.&quot; 438–457) are similar to those in present-day fire temples. The legend introduced under Ardeshir yields to a mint mark and year of issue under Peroz (&quot;r.&quot; 457–484), a feature evident in all the coins of the remaining dynasty.

<doc id="862272" wikidata="Q16955195" url="?curid=862272" title="The Newsroom (Canadian TV series)">
<text>The Newsroom is a Canadian television comedy-drama series which ran on CBC Television in the 1996–97, 2003–04 and 2004–05 seasons. A two-hour television movie, Escape from the Newsroom, was broadcast in 2002.

The show is set in the newsroom of a television station which is never officially named, but is generally understood to be based on CBC&#x27;s own Toronto affiliate CBLT. Inspired by American series &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; and similar to such earlier series as the British &quot;Drop the Dead Donkey&quot; and the Australian &quot;Frontline&quot;, the series mines a dark vein of comedy from the political machinations and the sheer incompetence of the people involved in producing the fictional &quot;City Hour&quot;, the station&#x27;s nightly newscast.

==History==

=== Season 1 ===
&quot;The Newsroom&quot; was not originally intended to be an ongoing series. Its first season of thirteen episodes, broadcast in 1996–97, led to critical acclaim but no immediate follow-up commissioning. Following the end of &quot;The Newsroom&quot;, creator Ken Finkleman produced three different short-run series for the CBC, &quot;More Tears&quot;, &quot;Foolish Heart&quot; and &quot;Foreign Objects&quot;, all of which included George Findlay, the central character of &quot;The Newsroom&quot;, as a linking character. A Findlay-like character with a different surname had also appeared in Finkleman&#x27;s pre-&quot;Newsroom&quot; series &quot;Married Life&quot;. Findlay was also revived in the later HBO Canada series &quot;Good Dog&quot; and &quot;Good God&quot;.

=== Season 2 ===
As none of the subsequent series after the initial season of &quot;The Newsroom&quot; were as well received by the public or by critics as the original show, the CBC began to seek a new set of &quot;Newsroom&quot; episodes. &quot;Escape from the Newsroom&quot;, which included a fourth wall-breaking plot digression in which the characters directly addressed the idea of reviving the series, was meant partly as a sarcastic response to that request. However, Finkleman ultimately agreed to produce 13 new episodes, which were broadcast after a six-year hiatus since the initial series, in the winter of 2004. The last four episodes of the second season were shot as a mockumentary.

=== Season 3 ===
A third season of &quot;The Newsroom&quot;, consisting of six episodes, was broadcast on CBC beginning on February 14, 2005.

In the United States, &quot;The Newsroom&quot; aired on PBS stations. All three seasons and &quot;Escape from the Newsroom&quot; are available on DVD.

===Followup===
The series drew some renewed media attention in 2011, when Aaron Sorkin announced that his new 2012 series, set in the newsroom of a cable news channel and originally to be titled &quot;More As This Story Develops&quot;, would be renamed &quot;The Newsroom&quot;. Writing in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, Jaime Weinman said the choice of name was &quot;a bit of a grimly amusing reminder that the U.S. TV industry doesn&#x27;t take Canada very seriously ... &#x27;The Newsroom&#x27; is often considered the greatest show Canada has ever produced, but a U.S. network feels no need to fear unflattering comparisons: assuming they’ve heard of the show, they probably think most people in the States have not heard of it.&quot; In an interview with &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; following the Sorkin show&#x27;s premiere, Finkleman revealed that HBO did contact him for permission to reuse the title, which he granted as he had no further plans to revive his series.

==Characters==

===Main characters===
Although the series has a large and variable ensemble cast, only three major characters are present throughout the show&#x27;s entire run.

George Findlay (series creator Ken Finkleman), the executive producer of &quot;City Hour&quot;, is a venal, petty man who cares only about his sex life, his lunch orders and his personal image within the network&#x27;s bureaucracy. Although exceptionally intelligent, he is highly self-absorbed and utterly unconcerned about anything besides himself.

In the third-season episode &quot;One Dumb Idea&quot;, Karen offers her idea on a character based on Findlay for a sitcom idea he is trying to come up with, saying, &quot;I think if you&#x27;re gonna go for reality, or, sorry, for &quot;verisimilitude&quot;, I think your character should be deceitful and self-serving. Basically, pathologically ambitious and actually lacking in any real humanity.&quot; In other words, a sociopath.

Findlay apparently suffers from constipation, hinted at by his obsession with bran muffins, fibre products and doctor appointments for procedures including a colonoscopy.

He constantly avoids talking to his mother (Clare Coulter) who keeps calling him at work. Telling people to tell her he is in a meeting or on vacation, he even goes so far as to have an intern get the telephone number to the show changed. When asked why he refuses to talk to her he replies, &quot;Talk to her? You&#x27;re missing the point. The point is, this place is too cheap to get me an assistant. If I had an assistant, &quot;she&quot; could talk to my mother. But because this place is so goddamn cheap, my mother has no one to talk to.&quot; Findlay does, however, have a close relationship with his BMW dealer, often calling him about small problems with his &quot;$40,000 German car.&quot;

Findlay has also appeared in nearly all of Finkleman&#x27;s other television series as a linking character, always working as a film or television producer.

Jim Walcott (Peter Keleghan) is &quot;City Hour&quot; similarly shallow but far less intelligent anchorman. Walcott is often told by the others that he is smart, but Findlay always refers to him as an idiot when he is not around. He lives alone with his cat and has been charged with sexual harassment several times, including an incident when he offered sexual favours to an underage girl in return for a ride in a helicopter.

In the final episode of the first season, &quot;The Campaign&quot;, Walcott, along with other staff of the newsroom, go into politics. Walcott is running as a Liberal for the provincial government of Ontario. He is asked by a reporter from &quot;The Star&quot; whether he is in favour of eliminating child poverty in Canada, to which he responds confusedly, &quot;this is a provincial election.&quot;

During a fundraising party he mishears a woman he is talking to about abortion, thinking she said, &quot;the decision should be between the woman, her doctor and her &quot;dog&quot;.&quot; After &quot;listening to [their] polls&quot;, the campaign team decides it best for Walcott to be anti-abortion, and at an anti-abortion rally he falls victim to a slip of the tongue, saying, &quot;I believe life begins at masturbation&quot;. Walcott&#x27;s attempts to garner additional support include making appearances with his ex-wife and a disabled person, both of whom are represented by agents demanding more money per appearance.

During a campaign speech, Walcott is shot and ends up in a coma with a bullet lodged in his brain. While watching the results of the election on the news, the campaign team celebrates its win just as Walcott dies in the hospital bed beside them.

In &quot;Escape from the Newsroom&quot;, Walcott returns to his job as news anchor. His &quot;death&quot; is clarified as a two-year coma. Walcott offers Atom Egoyan a story idea about &quot;a news anchor, who&#x27;s shot in the head, is in a coma for two years, but survives with a bullet lodged in his brain, and then struggles to return to his news desk.&quot; After Egoyan says to Walcott that he read about the same thing happening to Walcott, Walcott seems surprised and says, &quot;yeah, there is a parallel there somewhere.&quot;

Karen Mitchell (Karen Hines) is a segment producer, and the news department&#x27;s only real example of intelligence and professionalism. Karen seems to be the only one who takes journalistic integrity seriously, while the others try to find ways to boost ratings by glamourizing news stories with sensationalism.

Karen is apt to point out the ignorant prejudices of most of the staff, as they, in turn, tease her for not being able to find a date. Findlay suspects her of being a lesbian after she is featured in a feminist magazine as one of ten women in the news who make a difference. He &quot;connects the dots&quot; of her different personality traits to arrive at this conclusion, including observations of her not being able to sustain a male-female relationship, the fact that she knows the editor of a women&#x27;s magazine, and that she is aggressive, argumentative, sure of herself and moralistic. Karen, however, is not a lesbian, as this only illustrates Findlay&#x27;s way of thinking.

When offering her suggestion on characters profiles for Findlay&#x27;s sitcom idea, after ridiculing Findlay she went on to describe a character based on herself that should be &quot;highly intelligent and attractive in an unconventional way, with very strong legs from the years and years of yoga and running that she has had to do to keep her sanity in a toxic psychic environment that is &#x27;the newsroom&#x27;, and basically far too busy doing her job to get involved in your stupidity or, I&#x27;m sorry, your character&#x27;s stupidity.&quot;

===Supporting characters===

Each season has a different supporting cast of news writers, reporters, producers, and network bureaucrats. The 1996 season one cast includes Jeremy Hotz and Mark Farrell as Findlay&#x27;s two &quot;yes men&quot; segment producers, Tanya Allen as Audrey the intern, Damon Runyan as Steve David Huband as Bruce the weather guy, Julie Khaner as Findlay&#x27;s boss Sidney, Nancy Beatty as Nancy, Findlay&#x27;s other boss and David Gale as the entertainment reporter.

Leah Pinsent appears in &quot;Escape from the Newsroom&quot; as anchor Diane Gordon, a character she had previously played in Finkleman&#x27;s &quot;More Tears&quot;.

The 2004 season two cast includes Matt Watts as Matt and Jody Racicot as Alex who replace Jeremy and Mark as Findlay&#x27;s &quot;yes men&quot; segment producers. Douglas Bell plays Allen, a writer, hypochondriac, and Harvard graduate who often stutters. Holly Lewis plays Claire and Alberta Watson plays Susan. Tom McCamus also appears in one of the 2004 episodes as a newswriter who informs Findlay of his terminal illness, due to Findlay&#x27;s lack of concern; his character dies at the end of the episode.

In 2005, the season three additions to the cast include Shaughnessy Bishop-Stall as Jason, who replaces Alex as a segment producer, Kristin Booth as Nora, and Sarah Strange as Susan Murdoch, Findlay&#x27;s boss. Jeremy Hotz returns to the cast for the first episode when Findlay rehires his character and then fires him later that episode.

===Guest stars===

The show also includes guest appearances by several public figures, including David Cronenberg, Rick Salutin, Bob Rae, Hugh Segal, Naomi Klein, Daniel Richler, Angelo Mosca, Linda McQuaig, Cynthia Dale, Alex Gonzalez, and Noam Chomsky, playing themselves in interviews on the newscast. &quot;Escape from the Newsroom&quot; featured Atom Egoyan.

===Production notes===

The series was produced by Finkleman&#x27;s long-time collaborator, Peter Meyboom. For several years they ran an independent production company together called 100 Per Cent Films. Other key creative contributors to The Newsroom were cinematographer Joan Hutton whose documentary style added an authentic feel and music composer Sid Robinovitch, an old friend of Finkleman&#x27;s who wrote the mournful, jazzy closing theme. Another key collaborator was editor Allan Novak, who edited all of Finkleman&#x27;s early Canadian work including &quot;Married Life, More Tears, Foolish Heart&quot;, and &quot;Foreign Objects&quot;. Novak also produced and directed a half hour behind the scenes documentary called Inside the Newsroom. CBC executives green-lighting and overseeing the project included Deborah Bernstein, Susan Morgan, Slawko Klymkiw and Phyllis Platt.

<text>Royce Gracie (; born 12 December 1966) is a Brazilian retired professional mixed martial artist. Gracie gained fame for his success in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). He is a member of the Gracie jiu-jitsu family, a UFC Hall of Famer, and is considered to be one of the most influential figures in the history of mixed martial arts (MMA). He also competed in PRIDE Fighting Championships, K-1&#x27;s MMA events, and Bellator.

In 1993 and 1994, Gracie was the tournament winner of UFC 1, UFC 2 and UFC 4, which were openweight single-elimination tournaments with minimal rules. He used his skills in submission grappling to defeat larger and heavier opponents. He was also known for his rivalry with Ken Shamrock, whom he beat in UFC 1 and then fought to a draw in the rematch for the Superfight Championship at UFC 5. Royce later competed in PRIDE Fighting Championships, where he is most remembered for his 90-minute bout against catch wrestler Kazushi Sakuraba in 2000, and a controversial &quot;judo vs jiu-jitsu&quot; mixed rules match against Hidehiko Yoshida, an Olympic gold medalist in judo, at PRIDE Shockwave in 2002.

Royce Gracie&#x27;s success in the UFC popularized Gracie jiu-jitsu (commonly referred to as &quot;Brazilian&quot; jiu-jitsu) and revolutionized mixed martial arts, contributing to the movement towards grappling and ground fighting. For his pioneering in mixed martial arts, Gracie was the first inductee to the UFC Hall of Fame in 2003 alongside his once-rival Ken Shamrock. In 2016, he was inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame.

== Early life ==
Royce Gracie was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on 12 December 1966. One of the nine sons of jiu-jitsu grandmaster Hélio Gracie, he learned the martial art from his father in his childhood. He had his first competition at age 8 and started teaching classes when he was 14 years old. When he was 17, Royce was awarded a black belt by his father, Hélio. A few months later, he and his brothers Royler and Rickson Gracie moved to Torrance, California, to live with their older brother Rorion Gracie, who had moved there in 1978 and had established Gracie Academy.

The Gracie brothers in the United States continued the family&#x27;s tradition of the &quot;Gracie Challenge&quot;, in which they challenged other martial artists to no-rules full-contact matches in their gym to prove the superiority of Gracie jiu-jitsu. Rorion would later edit footage from the Gracie Challenge fights into a single documentary series known as &quot;Gracie in Action&quot;, with some footage featuring Royce&#x27;s fights. The &quot;Gracie in Action&quot; tapes inspired Art Davie to create the UFC.

==Mixed martial arts career==

===Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC)===

====UFC 1====
The Ultimate Fighting Championship was founded in 1993 by Rorion Gracie, business executive Art Davie, and the Semaphore Entertainment Group (SEG). The premise of the event was doing an eight-man openweight single-elimination tournament, with minimal rules, from fighters representing different martial arts, to find the most effective and strongest fighting style. While Davie and the SEG were interested in doing an event with violent and exciting vale tudo fights similar to what they had seen on the &quot;Gracie in Action&quot; tapes, Rorion was interested in promoting his family&#x27;s own jiu-jitsu style by defeating larger and stronger opponents from more well-known martial arts. Rorion said he picked Royce to represent the family&#x27;s art because of his skinnier and smaller frame, to show how a small person can defeat a bigger opponent using jiu-jitsu.

Gracie entered the tournament wearing his now iconic Brazilian jiu-jitsu gi. In his first match, Gracie defeated journeyman boxer Art Jimmerson. He tackled him to the ground using a &quot;baiana&quot; (morote-gari or double-leg) and obtained the dominant &quot;mounted&quot; position. Mounted and with only one free arm, Jimmerson conceded defeat.

In the semi-finals, Gracie fought against shootfighter and King of Pancrase fighter Ken Shamrock. This was Royce&#x27;s most difficult match, as Shamrock had grappling experience (having caught Patrick Smith in a Heel Hook in a previous match). Gracie started the round by attempting a double-leg, which was defended by Shamrock with a sprawl, and Shamrock attempted to stand up back to his feet. Gracie then responded by pulling Shamrock to his guard and started to do small kicks into Shamrock&#x27;s kidneys, but he got out from his guard and attempted to pull Gracie into a heel hook, as he had done with Patrick Smith similarly before. The Brazilian defended by wrapping his gi around Shamrock&#x27;s arm, and when the latter sat back, it pulled Gracie on top of him. He then proceeded to take Shamrock&#x27;s back and used his own gi to secure a rear naked choke. Shamrock later stated it was a gi choke, using the cloth around his neck. Shamrock tapped out to Gracie&#x27;s choke, but the referee did not see the tap and ordered both fighters to continue the match. Shamrock then admitted defeat to the referee, saying it would not be fair, and Royce was declared the bout&#x27;s victor, with both fighters exchanging a handshake after some taunting.

Gracie fought in the finals against karate Kyokushin practitioner and savate world champion Gerard Gordeau. Gracie managed to take his opponent to the ground and secure a rear choke, winning the bout. During the fight, Gordeau bit Gracie&#x27;s ear, breaking one of the few rules of the event. Gracie retaliated by holding the choke after Gordeau had tapped out, with the Dutchman tapping in panic before they were separated by the referee. Royce was then declared the &quot;Ultimate Fighting Champion&quot; and was awarded $50,000 in prize money.

==== Rivalry with Ken Shamrock ====
After Gracie defeated Ken Shamrock in the first UFC event, a rivalry developed between the fighters. Shamrock especially wanted a rematch as, according to him, Gracie had used the gi to favor his grappling while he had not been allowed to use wrestling shoes by the promoters, which he considered an unfair advantage to Gracie. Shamrock nonetheless conceded that he had underestimated his opponent.

A rematch between Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock failed to materialize at the UFC 2, as Shamrock had broken his hand in training and at UFC 3 Gracie withdrew from the competition due to exhaustion (resulting in Shamrock withdrawing from the event too). To solve the problem of the tournament format&#x27;s unpredictability, a &quot;superfight&quot; in which Gracie and Ken Shamrock would fight in a bout outside the main tournament was scheduled for the UFC 5.

====UFC 2====
Gracie returned to defend his title four months later at UFC 2, this tournament would have sixteen fighters and he would have to defeat four opponents to become the champion. Gracie began his defense of the title by submitting Japanese Karatedo Daido Juku and Kyokushin karateka Minoki Ichihara after a five-minute bout, his longest yet, with a lapel choke (which was possible as Ichihara was wearing a Karategi). Advancing into the quarterfinals, Royce Gracie fought Five Animals Kung Fu practitioner and future Pancrase veteran Jason DeLucia, whom he had already fought and defeated before in one of the &quot;Gracie Challenges&quot; in 1991. Gracie submitted DeLucia via armbar just over a minute into the bout. Gracie then submitted 250-lb Judo and Taekwondo black belt Remco Pardoel with a lapel choke (as Pardoel was wearing a Judogi), and arrived at the finals against kickboxer Patrick Smith, who had previously participated at UFC 1. Showing his superior grappling skills, Gracie easily took Smith to the ground and won the fight via submission to punches.

====UFC 3====
Royce Gracie entered UFC 3 now as twice-champion and as the favorite to win. The number of fighters was scaled down back to eight like the first edition. Royce was matched up in the first round against Kimo Leopoldo, a representative of Taekwondo and former high school wrestler. Leopoldo used his wrestling background to dominate the grappling exchanges, denying several of Gracie&#x27;s takedowns and even took his back. As both men began to tire, Gracie held down Leopoldo by grabbing onto his pony tail, eventually submitting him with an armbar at 4:40 of round one. However, he withdrew from his next fight with Harold Howard before it began due to exhaustion and dehydration. Royce entered the ring and threw in the towel. This was the first event which Gracie did not win.

====UFC 4====
Gracie began UFC 4 by submitting 51-year-old Karateka and Kung Fu film actor Ron van Clief in the opening round with a rear-naked choke near the four-minute mark. In the semi-finals, he fought American Kenpo Karate specialist Keith Hackney, who was able to defend Gracie&#x27;s takedowns for four minutes until he was submitted by an armbar.

Gracie&#x27;s final tournament bout was against Dan Severn, a former Pan American freestyle wrestling gold medalist. Severn dominated the fight, securing takedowns and maintaining top control throwing ground and pound for nearly fifteen minutes. However Gracie eventually managed to secure a triangle choke for the submission victory at 15:49 of round one. The match extended beyond the pay-per-view time slot and viewers, who missed the end of the fight, demanded their money back.

====UFC 5====
Gracie and Shamrock returned for UFC 5, they were both set to headline the UFC&#x27;s first &quot;superfight&quot;, a special outside the main tournament to rematch Gracie and Shamrock, as they would have no prior damage from a previous fight. The winner would win a special belt and become the inaugural UFC Superfight Champion. Time limits were re-introduced into the sport in 1995 due pay-per-view limits after the UFC 4 debacle and the fighters were only told a few hours before the event, upsetting both competitors.

At the start of round one, Shamrock immediately scored a takedown with Gracie pulling guard. The majority of the contest consisted of Shamrock in top position defending Gracie&#x27;s submission game, occasionally landing ground and pound. After nearly thirty minutes of control time for Shamrock, the contest was given overtime and restarted on the feet. At the beginning of the overtime, Shamrock connected with a punch that led to swelling on Gracie&#x27;s eye, with Gracie immediately pulling guard. After another uneventful few minutes, the contest was declared a draw.

The draw sparked much debate and controversy as to who would have won the fight had judges determined the outcome, or had there been no time limits, as by the end of the fight Gracie&#x27;s right eye was swollen shut. Had there been ringside judges, UFC matchmaker Art Davie believes that Shamrock would have been declared the winner. The fight was poorly received by critics and the live audience, due to the lack of action from both competitors.

After the fight, Gracie left the UFC along with his brother Rorion, who sold his shares of the event. According to Rorion, they left the organization due a conflict of interest because of the time limits introduced after UFC 4 and future plans to introduce judges, and weight classes.

====Royce&#x27;s challenge letters====
Throughout his UFC days, Royce frequently challenged well-known fighters—though usually to no avail—to &quot;fight to the finish, any place and any time.&quot; Many big-name sportspeople, including Mike Tyson (who was serving a prison term at the time) received a note several times in an open letter fashion, usually published by &quot;Black Belt Magazine&quot; in &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot; column.

====UFC Hall of Fame====
At UFC 45 in November 2003, at the ten-year anniversary of the UFC, Shamrock and Gracie became the first inductees into the UFC Hall of Fame. UFC President Dana White said;

===PRIDE Fighting Championships===
====Attempts to sign Royce====
Gracie was originally going to debut in PRIDE Fighting Championships in their 1998 PRIDE 2 event, where he would be pitted against fellow UFC champion Mark Kerr. The Gracie side demanded special rules without time limit or referee stoppage, which were accepted. However, Royce pulled out due to a back injury after the fight had been advertised.

The situation changed after PRIDE 8, when Royce&#x27;s older brother Royler Gracie was defeated by Kazushi Sakuraba. Sakuraba dominated the match and won by technical submission, as Royler was caught in a Kimura lock and refused to tap out, the referee stopped the match before his arm could be broken. This was the first time in 50 years a Gracie had been defeated in a mixed martial arts fight and Sakuraba followed by a challenge to Rickson Gracie. In response, the Gracies argued that Royler&#x27;s loss did not count as he had not conceded or tapped out, and the referee&#x27;s stopping of the bout went against the special ruleset they had requested for the fight. Many pundits were also affirming that the Gracie pure-BJJ approach was not able to match a well-rounded cross-trained fighter anymore. In response to that assertion, and to defeat Sakuraba in a rematch, the Gracies signed Royce up to PRIDE.

==== PRIDE Grand Prix and bout against Nobuhiko Takada ====

Royce Gracie&#x27;s first event in PRIDE was in the &quot;PRIDE Grand Prix 2000&quot;, an openweight tournament that would be divided into two events: the Opening Round, which consisted of the Round of 16 and the Finals which would happen three months later and consisted of the quarter-finals, Semi-finals and Finals. The bouts in the Opening Round had their rules modified to have only one round of fifteen minutes. In the first round, he fought Japanese professional wrestler Nobuhiko Takada. Takada was a very popular wrestler who had headlined PRIDE 1 and PRIDE 4 against Royce&#x27;s brother Rickson. Takada was also the former mentor of Sakuraba, the family&#x27;s rival.

In the first minute of the bout Gracie pulled Takada into his guard, and he spent the rest of the match unsuccessfully trying to submit or sweep Takada. After a largely uneventful fight, Royce Gracie was declared the winner by unanimous decision and advanced to the Grand Prix Quarter-Finals.

====Bout with Sakuraba====
Royce was then set to fight Kazushi Sakuraba in the quarter-finals at the PRIDE Grand Prix 2000 Finals. Sakuraba was a professional wrestler who derived his foundation in submissions from catch wrestling and shoot wrestling. He had defeated several opponents and become one of the first Japanese stars of PRIDE. As Royce entered the Grand Prix specially to fight Sakuraba, the Gracies demanded special rules for the fight: an unlimited number of 15-minute rounds, no judges, no referee stoppages, and wins could only come by knockout, submission or throwing in the towel. Sakuraba criticized the different ruleset, the Gracie&#x27;s demands to fight under it and their demands for special treatment, but ended up agreeing to the challenge nonetheless.

The two battled for an hour and a half, after which Gracie began to fatigue, and could no longer stand due to a broken femur as a result of numerous leg kicks. The towel was thrown in and Sakuraba was declared the winner. Sakuraba went on to defeat other members of the Gracie family, including Renzo Gracie and Ryan Gracie, earning him the nickname &quot;Gracie Hunter.&quot;

====Bouts with Yoshida====
Gracie returned to PRIDE in 2002 to fight Japanese gold-medalist judoka Hidehiko Yoshida in a special &quot;judo vs. Brazilian jiu-jitsu&quot; special rules match, billed as a &quot;rematch&quot; of Masahiko Kimura vs. Hélio Gracie, which had happened 50 years earlier. The rules were that the fight would be contested in two 10-minute rounds and would be declared a draw if no result was achieved. Strikes to the head were disallowed, as it was any kind of strike if both opponents were on the ground. Lying on the mat or dropping down without touching the opponent would be banned as well. Both fighters would wear a keikogi as per their respective disciplines&#x27;s preference. It happened at PRIDE Shockwave a co-production between PRIDE and K-1 kickboxing, intended to be a mega-event celebrating martial arts, with the event still having the largest live attendance in MMA history, drawing almost 91,000 fans (with some sources suggesting instead 71,000). Royce&#x27;s father Hélio Gracie lit a ceremonial olympic torch along with MMA pioneer Antonio Inoki in the opening ceremony.

Royce started the fight pulling guard and attempting a heel hook and an armbar, with Hidehiko blocking them and coming back with a gi choke and an ankle lock attempt. Gracie pulled guard again, but Yoshida turned it into a daki age and sought the Kimura lock; then, when the Brazilian blocked the technique, Yoshida passed his guard and performed a mounted sode guruma jime. After a moment of inactivity, the referee Daisuke Noguchi stopped the match in the belief Royce was unconscious and gave victory to Yoshida.

Gracie immediately protested and footage of the fight was reviewed, which showed that Gracie&#x27;s visible arm during the execution of the choke was limp and motionless. Gracie began to argue with Noguchi, the squabble soon resulted in him attacking the referee and it escalated into a full a brawl between the corners of the two fighters. Later backstage, the Gracies demanded it be turned into a no contest, and an immediate rematch be booked with different rules. If not, the Gracie family would never fight for PRIDE FC again. PRIDE, wanting to keep the Gracie family with them, accepted their demands.

Afterward, Gracie started fighting without a gi so that his opponents could not stall by holding onto it. The grudge match between Yoshida and Gracie took place at PRIDE&#x27;s Shockwave 2003 event on December 31, 2003. Gracie dominated Yoshida but, as the match had no judge per Gracie&#x27;s request, the bout was declared a draw after two 10-minute rounds.

===Fighting and Entertainment Group===
In September 2004 PRIDE had a disagreement with Gracie about his participation in the 2005 PRIDE Middleweight Grand Prix. Gracie had issues with the proposed opponents and rules (Grand Prix fights must have a winner and cannot end in a draw). He jumped to Fighting and Entertainment Group&#x27;s K-1 organization. Pride sued Gracie for breaching his contract with them. The case was settled in December 2005, with Gracie issuing a public apology, blaming his actions on a misinterpretation of the contract by his manager.

In K-1, Royce Gracie competed on K-1&#x27;s Dynamite!! series, which featured both kickboxing and MMA matches on their cards. On December 31, 2004, Gracie entered the K-1 scene at the K-1 PREMIUM 2004 Dynamite!! event inside the Osaka Dome, facing off against former sumo wrestler and MMA newcomer Akebono Tarō aka. Chad Rowan under special MMA rules (Two 10-minute rounds; the match would end as a draw if there was no winner after the two rounds). Gracie made quick work of his heavy opponent, forcing Akebono to submit to a shoulder lock at 2:13 of the first round.

Exactly one year later, on the K-1 PREMIUM 2005 Dynamite!! card of December 31, 2005, Gracie fought Japan&#x27;s Hideo Tokoro, a 143-pound fighter, in a fight ending in a draw after 20 minutes. Gracie&#x27;s original opponent was scheduled to be the tall Korean fighter Choi Hong-man, another MMA newcomer.

===Return to UFC===
On January 16, 2006, UFC President Dana White announced that Royce Gracie would return to the UFC to fight UFC welterweight champion Matt Hughes on May 27, 2006, at UFC 60. This was a non-title bout at a catchweight of 175 lb. under UFC/California State Athletic Commission rules. To prepare, Gracie trained in Muay Thai and was frequently shown in publicity materials from Fairtex.

In round one, Hughes secured a straight armbar that hyper-extended Royce&#x27;s arm, however Royce refused to tap. Hughes eventually won the fight by TKO at 4:39 of the first round. 
Royce said later after the fight with Hughes that he wanted a rematch and that he was not surprised by Hughes&#x27;s performance: &quot;No, we knew what he was planning to do. We worked out his gameplan before the fight, and he did exactly what we expected. I over-trained for the fight. That was all. I started training too much, too hard, for too long. He did exactly what we expected.&quot;

===Rematch with Sakuraba===
On May 8, 2007, EliteXC announced that Gracie&#x27;s opponent for the June 2 Dynamite!! USA event in Los Angeles would be Japanese fighter Kazushi Sakuraba.

Gracie defeated Sakuraba by a unanimous decision. However, a post-fight drug screen revealed that Royce had traces of Nandrolone in his system. &quot;Use of steroids is simply cheating,&quot; said Armando Garcia, California State Athletic Commission executive director. &quot;It won&#x27;t be tolerated in this state.&quot;

===Steroids scandal===
On June 14, 2007, the California State Athletic Commission declared that Gracie had tested positive for Nandrolone, an anabolic steroid, after his fight with Sakuraba. According to the California State Athletic Commission, the average person could produce about 2 ng/ml of Nandrolone, while an athlete following &quot;rigorous physical exercise&quot; could have a level of around 6 ng/ml. Both &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; test samples provided by Gracie &quot;had a level of over 50 ng/ml and we were informed that the level itself was so elevated that it would not register on the laboratory&#x27;s calibrator,&quot; said the CSAC. Gracie was fined $2,500 (the maximum penalty the commission can impose) and suspended for the remainder of his license, which ended on May 30, 2008. Gracie paid the fine.

Royce Gracie decided to dispute the allegations during an online video interview in May 2009, saying that his weight in the first UFC event was 178 lb and claiming his weight during his Sakuraba fight was 180 lb, thus only gaining 2 pounds. This was widely disputed by experts. According to ESPN, &quot;In the former contest, he weighed in at 175 pounds; for Sakuraba, he was 188. One may not need to be nutritionist to observe that a muscle gain of 13 pounds in one year at the age of 40 is a strikingly accomplished feat. Athletes nearing the half-century mark are often happy to maintain functional mass, let alone pack it on&quot;.

===Retirement===

On March 11, 2011, Royce Gracie&#x27;s profile was added back to ufc.com active fighters list as a middleweight. His manager stated that they were actively negotiating with the UFC for a return to the Octagon and said it was just a matter of &quot;getting it nailed down&quot; and that there was plenty of time for it.
On November 15, 2013, at UFC 167 on the 20th Anniversary of the UFC, Royce Gracie confirmed to MMA journalist Ariel Helwani that he had retired from competing in mixed martial arts.

===Return with Bellator MMA===
At Bellator 145, it was announced that Gracie would return from retirement to face rival Ken Shamrock in a trilogy fight, taking place on February 19, 2016, at Bellator 149. Gracie won the fight via TKO in round one. The win was not without controversy, however, as replays showed that Gracie landed a knee strike that grazed the groin of Shamrock prior to the finish. Shamrock protested the stoppage, however the bout was officially ruled a victory for Gracie. It was later announced that Shamrock had failed his pre-fight drug test for banned substances.

== Submission grappling career ==
On December 17, 1998, at Oscar de Jiu Jitsu, Royce Gracie competed in a grudge-match superfight against Wallid Ismail in front of several thousand spectators. Carlson Gracie was Ismail&#x27;s coach, though Ismail originally was Carlson&#x27;s fourth choice to face Royce after Mario Sperry, Murilo Bustamante and Amaury Bitetti. The match was contested without points and with no time-limit in place, with Ismail choking Gracie unconscious via clock choke in four minutes and fifty-three seconds.

== Post-fight career ==

Gracie has been since retired from MMA competition and has been focusing in teaching jiu-jitsu. He mostly travels around the world going to schools, teaching in seminars and doing interviews in magazines, websites and talk shows. He has opened his own association of gyms known as &quot;Royce Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Network&quot;, with affiliate schools in 34 locations in the United States, and many throughout the world in Brazil, Canada, Ecuador, Guatemala, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom.

Royce Gracie&#x27;s branch of jiu-jitsu focuses mainly on the self-defense parts of the martial art. Gracie has accused modern &quot;sporting&quot; jiu-jitsu of teaching techniques that are unpractical and unrealistic to use in a self-defense situation, and claims to be rescuing the true intent of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu as devised by his father Hélio Gracie.

==Personal life==
Gracie filed for divorce in 2016. He and his former wife Marianne have three sons and a daughter. His son Kheydon Gracie enlisted in the US Army.

Despite being a 7th degree coral belt, Gracie wears a dark blue belt when training in Brazilian jiu-jitsu paying homage to his father, Hélio Gracie, who primarily wore a dark blue belt despite having the highest possible rank, red belt. Hélio Gracie died in 2009, and Royce said he does not want to be promoted by anybody else.

He has formerly identified as a Zionist and a supporter of Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro.

Gracie is an avid firearms shooter. In 2022, Gracie competed in and was on the winning team of the Sig Hunter Games as a member of team Warrior.

On July 6, 2023, it was announced that ESPN Films is producing a documentary series on the Gracie family directed by Chris Fuller and produced by Greg O&#x27;Connor and Guy Ritchie.

==Controversies and legal troubles==
Gracie has engaged in multiple disputes with other martial artists including his nephews Rener Gracie, Ryron Gracie, and Eddie Bravo.

On April 1, 2015, the IRS sent Royce Gracie and his wife a Notice of Deficiency claiming they owe $657,114 in back taxes and $492,835.25 in penalties for Civil Fraud, based on IRC 6663(a). The case was settled on March 31, 2023, and Royce Gracie agreed to pay $461,611.80 to the US government.

<text>George Woodward Wickersham (September 19, 1858 – January 25, 1936) was an American lawyer and Attorney General of the United States in the administration of President William H. Taft. He returned to government to serve in appointed positions under both Republican and Democratic administrations, for Woodrow Wilson and Herbert Hoover. He was President of the Council on Foreign Relations for the latter.

==Background==

Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1858, Wickersham attended local schools and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1880 but had previously been admitted to practice before the courts as he studied law by &quot;reading,&quot; and preparing through an apprenticeship with an established firm.

He married Mildred Wendell. Their son, Cornelius Wendell Wickersham, was an attorney, author, and military officer who attained the rank of major general in the New York Army National Guard and was promoted to lieutenant general on the retired list to commend his many years of service to the organization.

==Career==

After several years of practice, in 1883 Wickersham entered the longtime law firm of Strong and Cadwalader in New York City. He became a partner four years later, and the firm was eventually named Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft.

He was appointed to the office of Attorney General of the United States from 1909 to 1913, in the administration of President William Howard Taft. In 1912 Wickersham supported the membership of U.S. Assistant Attorney General William H. Lewis in the American Bar Association, after Southerners protested the African American&#x27;s presence and the executive committee voted to oust him. Wickersham sent a letter to all 4,700 members urging their support for Lewis, who refused to resign.

After the election of President Woodrow Wilson in 1912, the Democrat appointed his own people to federal positions. During Wilson&#x27;s first term, from 1914 to 1916, Wickersham was out of government and served as president of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York. In 1916, Wickersham opposed Wilson&#x27;s nomination of Louis Brandeis for the Supreme Court, describing the Jewish nominee&#x27;s supporters as &quot;a bunch of Hebrew uplifters.&quot;

Soon after the United States entered World War I in 1917, Wickersham was named by President Wilson to serve on the War Trade Board to Cuba.

In 1929, President Herbert Hoover appointed Wickersham to the National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement, better known as the &quot;Wickersham Commission.&quot; (It was described as the &quot;Wickersham Committee&quot; by William L. Marbury Jr. in a 1935 letter seeking the support of U.S. Senator George L. P. Radcliffe for appointment of Alger Hiss to the U.S. Solicitor General&#x27;s office; Hiss had served on the committee 1929-1930.)

Wickersham did not return to government under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was elected president of a private organization the Council on Foreign Relations, serving from 1933 to 1936.

==Personal life and death==

Wickersham married; his son was Cornelius Wendell Wickersham, a lawyer and a U.S. Army Brigadier General.

He lived much of his life in Cedarhurst, New York in the Town of Hempstead, now known as the Village of Lawrence.

Wickersham died in New York City in 1936 and was buried in Brookside Cemetery in Englewood, New Jersey.

==Legacy==

Since 1996, the Friends of the Law Library of the Library of Congress have presented an annual award named for Wickersham.

<text>The Société Honoraire de Français (French National Honor Society) is an organization whose intent is to recognize high school students in the United States who have maintained excellent grades in at least three semesters of French language courses; this is done by induction into the organization.

==Induction==
At induction, the SHF history is usually read, culminating with the lighting of candles. Each student holds a candle, and the student next to him or her recites the motto, &quot;Avoir une autre langue, c&#x27;est posséder une deuxième âme,&quot; which means &quot;To have another language is to have a second soul.&quot; All the members are considered inducted when the last candle is lit.

==Duties==
Community service is mandatory for the organization, as well as a high-grade point average overall (at least a B average in all other courses), in addition to an A in French classes during the semester of selection.

<text>Hyperhidrosis is a medical condition in which a person exhibits excessive sweating, more than is required for the regulation of body temperature. Although it is primarily a physical burden, hyperhidrosis can deteriorate the quality of life of the people who are affected from a psychological, emotional, and social perspective. In fact, hyperhidrosis almost always leads to psychological as well as physical and social consequences. People suffering from it present difficulties in professional fields, more than 80% experiencing a moderate to severe emotional impact from the disease and half are subject to depression.

This excess of sweat happens even if the person is not engaging in tasks that require muscular effort, and it does not depend on the exposure to heat. Common places to sweat can include underarms, face, neck, back, groin, feet, and hands. It has been called by some researchers &#x27;the silent handicap&#x27;.

Both &quot;diaphoresis&quot; and &quot;hidrosis&quot; can mean either &quot;perspiration&quot; (in which sense they are synonymous with &quot;sweating&quot;) or &quot;excessive perspiration&quot;, in which case they refer to a specific, narrowly defined, clinical disorder.

==Classification==
Hyperhidrosis can either be &quot;generalized&quot;, or &quot;localized&quot; to specific parts of the body. Hands, feet, armpits, groin, and the facial area are among the most active regions of perspiration due to the high number of sweat glands (eccrine glands in particular) in these areas. When excessive sweating is localized (e.g. palms, soles, face, underarms, scalp) it is referred to as &quot;primary&quot; hyperhidrosis or focal hyperhidrosis. Excessive sweating involving the whole body is termed &quot;generalized&quot; hyperhidrosis or secondary hyperhidrosis. It is usually the result of some other, underlying condition.

Primary or &quot;focal&quot; hyperhidrosis may be further divided by the area affected, for instance, palmoplantar hyperhidrosis (symptomatic sweating of only the hands or feet) or gustatory hyperhidrosis (sweating of the face or chest a few moments after eating certain foods).

Hyperhidrosis can also be classified by onset, either congenital (present at birth) or acquired (beginning later in life). Primary or focal hyperhidrosis usually starts during adolescence or even earlier and seems to be inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait. It must be distinguished from &quot;secondary&quot; hyperhidrosis, which can start at any point in life, but usually presents itself after 25 years of age. Secondary hyperhidrosis commonly accompanies conditions such as diabetes mellitus, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, hyperthyroidism, hyperpituitarism, anxiety disorder, pheochromocytoma, and menopause.

One classification scheme uses the amount of skin affected. In this scheme, excessive sweating in an area of or more is differentiated from sweating that affects only a small area.

Another classification scheme is based on possible causes of hyperhidrosis.

==Causes==
The cause of primary hyperhidrosis is unknown. Anxiety or excitement can exacerbate the condition. A common complaint of people is a nervous condition associated with sweating, then sweat more because the person is nervous. Other factors can play a role, including certain foods and drinks, nicotine, caffeine, and smells.

Similarly, secondary (generalized) hyperhidrosis has many causes including certain types of cancer, disturbances of the endocrine system, infections, and medications.

===Primary===

Primary (focal) hyperhidrosis has many causes. 
* Idiopathic unilateral circumscribed hyperhidrosis
* Reported association with:
** Blue rubber bleb nevus
** Glomus tumor
** POEMS syndrome
** Burning feet syndrome (Gopalan&#x27;s)
** Trench foot
** Causalgia
** Pachydermoperiostosis
** Pretibial myxedema
* Gustatory sweating associated with:
** Encephalitis
** Syringomyelia
** Diabetic neuropathies
** Herpes zoster (shingles)
** Parotitis
** Parotid abscesses
** Thoracic sympathectomy
** Auriculotemporal or Frey&#x27;s syndrome
* Miscellaneous
** Lacrimal sweating (due to postganglionic sympathetic deficit, often seen in Raeder&#x27;s syndrome)
** Harlequin syndrome
** Emotional hyperhidrosis

===Cancer===
A variety of cancers have been associated with the development of secondary hyperhidrosis including lymphoma, pheochromocytoma, carcinoid tumors (resulting in carcinoid syndrome), and tumors within the thoracic cavity.

===Endocrine===
Certain endocrine conditions are also known to cause secondary hyperhidrosis including diabetes mellitus (especially when blood sugars are low), acromegaly, hyperpituitarism, pheochromocytoma (tumor of the adrenal glands, present in 71% of patients) and various forms of thyroid disease.

===Medications===
Use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., sertraline) is a common cause of medication-induced secondary hyperhidrosis. Other medications associated with secondary hyperhidrosis include tricyclic antidepressants, stimulants, opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glyburide, insulin, anxiolytic agents, adrenergic agonists, and cholinergic agonists.

===Miscellaneous===

* In people with a history of spinal cord injuries
** Autonomic dysreflexia
** Orthostatic hypotension
** Posttraumatic syringomyelia
* Associated with peripheral neuropathies
** Familial dysautonomia (Riley-Day syndrome)
** Congenital autonomic dysfunction with universal pain loss
** Exposure to cold, notably associated with cold-induced sweating syndrome
* Associated with probable brain lesions
** Episodic with hypothermia (Hines and Bannick syndrome)
** Episodic without hypothermia
** Olfactory
* Associated with systemic medical problems
** Parkinson&#x27;s disease
** Fibromyalgia
** Congestive heart failure
** Anxiety
** Obesity
** Menopausal state
** Night sweats
** Compensatory
** Infantile acrodynia induced by chronic low-dose mercury exposure, leading to elevated catecholamine accumulation and resulting in a clinical picture resembling pheochromocytoma.
*Febrile diseases
*Vigorous exercise
*A hot, humid environment

==Diagnosis==
Symmetry of excessive sweating in hyperhidrosis is most consistent with primary hyperhidrosis. To diagnose this condition, a dermatologist gives the person a physical exam. This includes looking closely at the areas of the body that sweat excessively. A dermatologist also asks very specific questions. This helps the physician understand why the person has excessive sweating. Sometimes medical testing is necessary. Some patients require a test called the sweat test. This involves coating some of their skin with a powder that turns purple when the skin gets wet.

Excessive sweating affecting only one side of the body is more suggestive of secondary hyperhidrosis and further investigation for a neurologic cause is recommended.

==Treatment==
Antihydral cream is one of the solutions prescribed for hyperhidrosis for palms. Topical agents for hyperhidrosis therapy include formaldehyde lotion and topical anticholinergics. These agents reduce perspiration by denaturing keratin, in turn occluding the pores of the sweat glands. They have a short-lasting effect. Formaldehyde is classified as a probable human carcinogen. Contact sensitization is increased, especially with formalin. Aluminium chlorohydrate is used in regular antiperspirants. However, hyperhidrosis requires solutions or gels with a much higher concentration. These antiperspirant solutions or hyperhidrosis gels are especially effective for treatment of axillary or underarm regions. It takes three to five days to see improvement. The most common side-effect is skin irritation. For severe cases of plantar and palmar hyperhidrosis, there has been some success with conservative measures such as higher strength aluminium chloride antiperspirants. Treatment algorithms for hyperhidrosis recommend topical antiperspirants as the first line of therapy for hyperhidrosis. The International Hyperhidrosis Society has published evidence-based treatment guidelines for focal and generalized hyperhidrosis.

Prescription medications called anticholinergics, often taken by mouth, are sometimes used in the treatment of both generalized and focal hyperhidrosis. Anticholinergics used for hyperhidrosis include propantheline, glycopyrronium bromide or glycopyrrolate, oxybutynin, methantheline, and benzatropine. Use of these drugs can be limited, however, by side-effects, including dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, and visual disturbances such as mydriasis and cycloplegia. For people who find their hyperhidrosis is made worse by anxiety-provoking situations (public speaking, stage performances, special events such as weddings, etc.), taking an anticholinergic medicine before the event may help. In 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the topical anticholinergic glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis.

For peripheral hyperhidrosis, some people have found relief by simply ingesting crushed ice water. Ice water helps to cool excessive body heat during its transport through the blood vessels to the extremities, effectively lowering overall body temperature to normal levels within ten to thirty minutes.

===Procedures===
Injections of botulinum toxin type A can be used to block neural control of sweat glands. The effect can last from 3–9 months depending on the site of injections. This use has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The duration of the beneficial effect in primary palmar hyperhidrosis has been found to increase with repetition of the injections. The Botox injections tend to be painful. Various measures have been tried to minimize the pain, one of which is the application of ice.

This was first demonstrated by Khalaf Bushara and colleagues as the first nonmuscular use of BTX-A in 1993. BTX-A has since been approved for the treatment of severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis (excessive underarm sweating of unknown cause), which cannot be managed by topical agents.

miraDry, a microwave-based device, has been tried for excessive underarm perspiration and appears to show promise. With this device, rare but serious side effects exist and are reported in the literature, such as paralysis of the upper limbs and brachial plexus.

Tap water iontophoresis as a treatment for palmoplantar hyperhidrosis was originally described in the 1950s. Studies showed positive results and good safety with tap water iontophoresis. One trial found it decreased sweating by about 80%.

===Surgery===
Sweat gland removal or destruction is one surgical option available for axillary hyperhidrosis (excessive underarm perspiration). There are multiple methods for sweat gland removal or destruction, such as sweat gland suction, retrodermal curettage, and axillary liposuction, Vaser, or Laser Sweat Ablation. Sweat gland suction is a technique adapted for liposuction.

The other main surgical option is endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS), which cuts, burns, or clamps the thoracic ganglion on the main sympathetic chain that runs alongside the spine. Clamping is intended to permit the reversal of the procedure. ETS is generally considered a &quot;safe, reproducible, and effective procedure and most patients are satisfied with the results of the surgery&quot;. Satisfaction rates above 80% have been reported, and are higher for children. The procedure brings relief from excessive hand sweating in about 85–95% of people. ETS may be helpful in treating axillary hyperhidrosis, facial blushing and facial sweating, but failure rates in people with facial blushing and/or excessive facial sweating are higher and such people may be more likely to experience unwanted side effects.

ETS side-effects have been described as ranging from trivial to devastating. The most common side-effect of ETS is compensatory sweating (sweating in different areas than prior to the surgery). Major problems with compensatory sweating are seen in 20–80% of people undergoing the surgery. Most people find the compensatory sweating to be tolerable while 1–51% claim that their quality of life decreased as a result of compensatory sweating.&quot; Total body perspiration in response to heat has been reported to increase after sympathectomy. The original sweating problem may recur due to nerve regeneration, sometimes as early as 6 months after the procedure.

Other possible side-effects include Horner&#x27;s Syndrome (about 1%), gustatory sweating (less than 25%) and excessive dryness of the palms (sandpaper hands). Some people have experienced cardiac sympathetic denervation, which can result in a 10% decrease in heart rate both at rest and during exercise, resulting in decreased exercise tolerance.

Percutaneous sympathectomy is a minimally invasive procedure similar to the botulinum method, in which nerves are blocked by an injection of phenol. The procedure provides temporary relief in most cases. Some physicians advocate trying this more conservative procedure before resorting to surgical sympathectomy, the effects of which are usually not reversible.

==Prognosis==
Hyperhidrosis can have physiological consequences such as cold and clammy hands, dehydration, and skin infections secondary to maceration of the skin. Hyperhidrosis can also have devastating emotional effects on one&#x27;s individual life.

Those with hyperhidrosis may have greater stress levels and more frequent depression.

Excessive sweating or focal hyperhidrosis of the hands interferes with many routine activities, such as securely grasping objects. Some people with focal hyperhidrosis sufferers avoid situations where they will come into physical contact with others, such as greeting a person with a handshake. Hiding embarrassing sweat spots under the armpits limits the affected person&#x27;s arm movements and pose. In severe cases, shirts must be changed several times during the day and require additional showers both to remove sweat and control body odor issues or microbial problems such as acne, dandruff, or athlete&#x27;s foot. Additionally, anxiety caused by self-consciousness to the sweating may aggravate the sweating. Excessive sweating of the feet makes it harder for people to wear slide-on or open-toe shoes, as the feet slide around in the shoe because of sweat.

Some careers present challenges for people with hyperhidrosis. For example, careers that require the use of a knife may not be safely performed by people with excessive sweating of the hands. The risk of dehydration can limit the ability of some to function in extremely hot (especially if also humid) conditions. Even the playing of musical instruments can be uncomfortable or difficult because of sweaty hands.

==Epidemiology==
It is estimated that the incidence of focal hyperhidrosis may be as high as 2.8% of the population of the United States. It affects men and women equally, and most commonly occurs among people aged 25–64 years, though some may have been affected since early childhood. About 30–50% of people have another family member affected, implying a genetic predisposition.

In 2006, researchers at Saga University in Japan reported that primary palmar hyperhidrosis maps to gene locus 14q11.2–q13.

<text>Cooke, Troughton &amp; Simms was a British instrument-making firm formed in York in 1922 by the merger of T. Cooke &amp; Sons and Troughton &amp; Simms.

==Origins==
Thomas Cooke set up a business in York in 1837 making astronomical telescopes. One early notable instrument was a 4.5 inch equatorial refractor which would have been exceptional at the time. In 1851 Cooke built a 7.25 inch equatorial telescope. Cooke made the optical elements himself for both these instruments. Thomas Cooke built a reputation for high quality optics and, as well as smaller instruments, supplied large instruments to observatories around the world.

From the outset in 1826 and earlier Troughton and Simms of London excelled in the high precision work of dividing circles and so provided many observatories with large transit instruments and supplied national surveys such as the Ordnance Survey, with large transit theodolites.

==Merger==
In 1922 with business in a depressed state Cooke and Troughton &amp; Simms merged with head offices at York. However foreign competition was strong. In particular the Swiss firm of Wild was making theodolites which were lighter, smaller and more accurate than CTS products.

==Vickers ownership==
In 1924 the company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Vickers. In 1926 a meeting was held in Tavistock, Devon with representatives from the Admiralty, the War Office and the Ordnance Survey and Cooke, Troughton &amp; Simms, E. R. Watts and C. F. Casella &amp; Co. On Dartmoor a comparison was made between the products of UK companies and their European competition, especially the Wild T2 theodolite which pioneered enclosed glass circles rather than exposed brass ones. Results were depressing for the British firms.

One result of this event was the Vickers CTS &quot;Tavistock&quot; theodolite which appeared in 1930. The unusual circle reading eyepieces which projected out from each side arose from a wish to avoid infringing the Wild patents. Work began in the autumn of 1931 on the Geodetic Tavistock. where the increased accuracy made it suitable for primary surveys of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the East African Arc and the retriangulation of Great Britain. In response to user requests a second, lighter version the Geodetic Tavistock appeared in 1937 

By 1932 the depressed state of trade had reached a point where the York factory was working at only 40% capacity but was kept going making optical components for Vickers Armstrong and also building the Vickers Projection Microscope. By 1933 only 30% of the factory was in use. In 1938, the telescope manufacturing part of the business was sold to Grubb Parsons.

==Wartime Production==
In 1936 a list of military requirements was issued by the minister for co-ordination of defence, Sir Thomas Inskip. One result was the building of a new factory in 1938 in Haxby Road, York. The firm&#x27;s telescope-making business was acquired by Sir Howard Grubb, Parsons and Co. Ltd.
At the outbreak of war in 1939 the UK government placed large orders for military sighting telescopes and theodolites. By 1940 output was only limited by the supply of raw materials and orders exceeded £1,000,000.

During the Second World War many Tavistock theodolites were used in artillery observation and many other applications by survey regiments. During this period 3,300 people were employed by the company. Anticipating post war trading conditions several new products such as medical microscopes suited to a civilian role were developed using tooling created for wartime production.

At the end of the Second World War, a film entitled Cooke Troughton &amp; Simms in Wartime 1939-1945 was released which documented the manufacturing processes used to produce many of the optical instruments which were used in tanks, aeroplanes and on ships. The Haxby Road factory was re-designated &quot;Kingsway North&quot; with a workforce of 900 in 1939, rising to 2000 in 1941 and peaking in 1943.

==Post War Products==

In 1963 CTS became a part of the new Vickers Instruments Ltd. During this period it made the Vickers V.11 and V.22 theodolites.

The company produced a range of precision microscopes and survey equipment including theodolites and it manufactured one of the first usable interference microscopes. A 1950 catalogue listed the following range of microscopes:
*M1005/M1025 - student microscopes
*M1000 - &#x27;general purpose&#x27; microscope
*M2000 - microscope for &#x27;routine and research investigations&#x27;
*M3000 - The M2000 with vertical adjustment to the stage
*M4000 - &#x27;universal stand&#x27; for visual and photographic examination
*M6000 - stereo microscope
*M7000 - polarizing microscope

Cooke, Troughton &amp; Simms ceased trading in 1988. Upon closure all buildings on the 
site were demolished, leaving only the concrete foundations and as of October 2018, the site is still waiting to be redeveloped.

<text>A stopper, bung, or cork is a cylindrical or conical closure used to seal a container, such as a bottle, tube, or barrel. 

==Description==
Unlike a lid or bottle cap, which encloses a container from the outside without displacing the inner volume, a bung is partially or wholly inserted inside the container to act as a seal. A bung can be defined as &quot;a plug or closure used to close an opening in a drum or barrel. It is called a plug when referring to a steel drum closure.&quot;

A glass stopper is often called a &quot;ground glass joint&quot; (or &quot;joint taper&quot;), and a cork stopper is called simply a &quot;cork&quot;. Stoppers used for wine bottles are referred to as &quot;corks&quot;, even when made from another material. 

A common every-day example of a stopper is the cork of a wine bottle. When used to seal the bungholes of barrels, the stopper is called a bung. Other bungs, particularly those used in chemical barrels, may be made of metal and be screwed into place via threading. 

==Ground glass joint==
Ground glass joint (or ground glass stoppers) are commonly used with laboratory glassware, mainly because of their nonreactivity. Some stoppers used in labs have holes in them to allow the insertion of glass or rubber tubing. This is often used when a reaction is taking place in the flask or test tube and the byproduct or result of the reaction is desired to be collected. For instance, if one were to boil water in a test tube and wanted to collect the water vapor, one could seal the test tube with a stopper with holes in it. With tubing inserted into the hole(s), when the tube is heated, water vapor will rise through the hole, make its way through the tubing, and into the collection chamber of choice. The water vapor would not be able to escape into the air, because the stopper and the tubing, if set up correctly, would be airtight. 

==Rubber bungs==

In chemistry, bungs made of hardened rubber are frequently used in small-scale experimental set-ups involving non-corrosive gases. Some chemistry bungs may also include one or more holes so a glass tube or laboratory funnel may be inserted through the bung and into the container or another piece of apparatus. The rubber bung may be used to seal a flask because the user may require the contents to be mixed via shaking the flask or may require that the contents be kept inside the flask and prevented from leaking out. In all cases, the bung keeps the experimentation environment sealed so that liquids or gases cannot escape (or enter). 

For applications that place higher demands on the bung in terms of temperature and mechanical stability or solvent resistance, standardized glass stoppers and connectors are preferred. 

Bottle stoppers made from gutta-percha, a natural rubber that is both chemically resistant and thermoplastic, were the first product of the Gutta Percha Company, better known for making submarine telegraph cables.

<text>was a town in Nakakubiki District, Niigata Prefecture, Japan

In 1916, Myōkō Kōgen became nationally famous when it came first in a vote taken to find the most popular summer resort in Japan.

The area is dominated by &#x27;Hokushingogaku&#x27; - a series of five mountains (Madarao, Myōkō, Kurohime, Togakushi and Iizuna) that make up the border of Nagano and Niigata prefectures. Mt. Myoko 妙高山 is listed as one of the hundred most famous mountains in Japan with its summit recorded as 2,454 meters above sea level. 

, the town had an estimated population of 6,234 and a population density of 48.49 persons per km2. The total area was 128.57 km2.

On April 1, 2005, Myōkōkōgen, along with the former village of Myōkō (also from Nakakubiki District), was merged into the expanded city of Arai. Arai changed its name to Myōkō City at the same time.

==Activities==
Myōkō Kōgen is famed for its ski resorts which were founded in the 1930s, making it one of the oldest established ski areas in the world. It is also a traditional mountain retreat of Japan&#x27;s imperial family. The area includes nine mountain resorts: the main resorts of Akakura Onsen, Akakura Kanko Resort (also known as Akakan), Ikenotaira Onsen, Myōkō Suginohara (which boasts the longest ski run in Japan), the smaller Seki Onsen, Kyukamura RunRun and Myōkō Ski Park, and two resorts just over the border in Nagano: Madarao Kogen and Tangram Ski Circus.

Myōkō Kōgen is also well known for its many local &quot;onsen&quot; (hot springs) emanating from the Jigoku-dani valley between Mt. Myoko and Mt. Maeyama

<doc id="862289" wikidata="Q2623437" url="?curid=862289" title="Stopper knot">
<text>A stopper knot (or simply stopper) is a knot that creates a fixed thicker point on an otherwise-uniform thickness rope for the purpose of preventing the rope, at that point, from slipping through a narrow passage, such as a hole in a block. To pass a rope through a block, or hole, is to reeve it. To pull it out is to unreeve it. Stopper knots prevent the rope from unreeving on its own.

&quot;Stopper&quot; has three distinct meanings in the context of knotting and cordage. A decorative stopper knot may be referred to as a lanyard knot.

A monkey&#x27;s tail &quot;is a permanent or semipermanent stopper that is put in the bight as well as the end. It is also called single throat seizing, seized round turn, clinch, and pigtail...A small round turn is first taken, and a throat seizing, in length about a quarter of the round of the clinch, is put in. The monkey&#x27;s tail is preferred for the purpose just described because it does less damage to rope than any knot. When the monkey&#x27;s tail fetches against the rack the seizing takes the burden.&quot;

==At the end of a line==
A stopper knot is tied at the end of a rope to prevent the end from unraveling. It then functions like a whipping knot.

A stopper knot is tied at the end of a rope to prevent the end from slipping through another knot, or passing back through a hole, block, or belay/rappel device. It then functions like a leash handle. Knots commonly used for this purpose are:

*Overhand knot
*Double overhand knot
*Figure-eight knot
*Stevedore knot
*Ashley&#x27;s stopper knot

The Chinese button knot and the Celtic button knot are decorative stopper knots.

==Around the standing part==
When a stopper knot is tied outside another knot and around the standing part it can also be called a backup knot. Tying the end around the standing part helps prevent the knot from unraveling by not allowing the end to slide back into the knot: a kind of insurance against failure of the knot. Examples of this usage are often seen in climbing, rope rescue, and other safety-of-life situations. Common knots used for this purpose are:

*Overhand knot
*Double overhand knot/strangle knot
*Double fisherman&#x27;s knot

==Nautical usage==

In nautical settings, a stopper may refer to a length of rope that is belayed at one end with the other end attached to a tensioned main line using a friction hitch in order to tension the stopper and thereby slacken the portion of the tensioned main line behind the friction hitch. For example, if a sheet becomes jammed on a winch while under sail, a &quot;stopper&quot; can be used to temporarily take the strain off the winch while the riding turn is cleared.

*Rolling hitch &amp; similar friction hitches

<text>Gastornis is an extinct genus of large, flightless birds that lived during the mid-Paleocene to mid-Eocene epochs of the Paleogene period. Most fossils have been found in Europe, and some species typically referred to the genus are known from North America and Asia. Several genera, including the well-studied genus Diatryma, have historically been considered junior synonyms of &quot;Gastornis&quot;. However, this interpretation has been challenged recently, and some researchers currently consider &quot;Diatryma&quot; to be a valid genus.

&quot;Gastornis&quot; species were very large birds that were traditionally thought to have been predators of various smaller mammals, such as ancient, diminutive equids. However, several lines of evidence, including the lack of hooked claws (in known &quot;Gastornis&quot; footprints), studies of their beak structure and isotopic signatures of their bones, have caused scientists to now consider that these birds were probably herbivorous, feeding on tough plant material and seeds. &quot;Gastornis&quot; is, generally, agreed to be related to the Galloanserae, the group containing waterfowl and gamebirds.

==History==

&quot;Gastornis&quot; was first described in 1855 from a fragmentary skeleton. It was named after Gaston Planté, described as a &quot;studious young man full of zeal&quot;, who had discovered the first fossils in clay () formation deposits at Meudon, near Paris. The discovery was notable, due to the large size of the specimens, and because, at the time, &quot;Gastornis&quot; represented one of the oldest known birds. Additional bones of the first known species, &quot;G. parisiensis&quot;, were found in the mid-1860s. Somewhat more-complete specimens, then referred to the new species &quot;G. edwardsii&quot; (now considered a synonym of &quot;G. parisiensis&quot;), were found a decade later. These specimens, found in the 1870s, formed the basis for a widely- circulated and reproduced skeletal restoration by Lemoine. The skulls of these original &quot;Gastornis&quot; fossils were unknown, other than nondescript fragments and several bones used in Lemoine&#x27;s illustration, which turned out to be those of other animals. Thus, this European specimen was long reconstructed as a sort of gigantic &quot;crane-like&quot; bird.

In 1874, the American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope discovered another fragmentary set of fossils at the Wasatch Formation, New Mexico. Cope considered the fossils to be of a distinct genus and species of giant ground bird; in 1876, he named the remains &quot;Diatryma gigantea&quot; ( ), from the Ancient Greek διάτρημα (&quot;diatrema&quot;), meaning &quot;through a hole&quot;, in reference to the large foramina (perforations) that penetrated some of the foot bones. In 1894, a single gastornithid toe bone from New Jersey was described by Cope&#x27;s &quot;rival&quot; Othniel Charles Marsh, and classified as a new genus and species: &quot;Barornis regens&quot;. In 1911, it was recognized that this, too, could be considered a junior synonym of &quot;Diatryma&quot; (and therefore, later, &quot;Gastornis&quot;). Additional, fragmentary specimens were found in Wyoming in 1911, and assigned (in 1913) to the new species &quot;Diatryma ajax&quot; (also now considered a synonym of &quot;G. giganteus&quot;). In 1916, an American Museum of Natural History expedition to the Bighorn Basin (Willwood Formation, Wyoming) found the first nearly-complete skull and skeleton, which was described in 1917 and gave scientists their first clear picture of the bird. Matthew, Granger, and Stein (1917) classified this specimen as yet another new species, &quot;Diatryma steini&quot;.

After the description of &quot;Diatryma&quot;, most new European specimens were referred to this genus, instead of &quot;Gastornis&quot;; however, after the initial discovery of &quot;Diatryma&quot;, researchers recognized the similarity between the two genera as early as 1884 when Elliott Coues placed &quot;Diatryma gigantea&quot; under the genus &quot;Gastornis&quot; as &quot;G. giganteus&quot;, a synonymy agreed upon by the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union in 1886. Further meaningful comparisons between &quot;Gastornis&quot; and &quot;Diatryma&quot; were made more difficult by Lemoine&#x27;s incorrect skeletal illustration, the composite nature of which was not discovered until the early 1980s. Following this, several authors began to recognize a greater degree of similarity between the European and North American birds, often placing both in the same order (†Gastornithiformes) or even family (†Gastornithidae). This newly-realized degree of similarity caused many scientists to, tentatively, accept the animals&#x27; synonymy pending a comprehensive review of the anatomy of both genera, in which &quot;Gastornis&quot; has the taxonomic priority. Some subsequent studies either continued to use the genus &quot;Diatryma&quot; or argued against the synonymy, since a detailed comparison of type specimens has not been done yet and notable differences can be found in the species originally assigned to &quot;Diatryma&quot; from the type species of &quot;Gastornis&quot;.

==Description==

&quot;Gastornis&quot; is known from a large amount of fossil remains, but the clearest picture of the bird comes from a few nearly complete specimens of the species &quot;G. giganteus&quot;. These were generally very large birds, with huge beaks and massive skulls superficially similar to the carnivorous South American &quot;terror birds&quot; (phorusrhacids). The largest known species, &quot;G. giganteus&quot; would have reached about in maximum height, and up to in mass.

The skull of &quot;G. giganteus&quot; was huge compared to the body and powerfully built. The beak was extremely tall and compressed (flattened from side to side). Unlike other species of &quot;Gastornis&quot;, &quot;G. giganteus&quot; lacked characteristic grooves and pits on the underlying bone. The &#x27;lip&#x27; of the beak was straight, without a raptorial hook as found in the predatory phorusrhacids. The nostrils were small and positioned close to the front of the eyes about midway up the skull. The vertebrae were short and massive, even in the neck. The neck was relatively short, consisting of at least 13 massive vertebrae. The torso was relatively short. The wings were vestigial, with the upper wing-bones small and highly reduced, similar in proportion to the wings of the cassowary. A largely complete skull specimen (GMH XVIII-1178-1958) of &quot;G. geiselensis&quot; was also described in 2024 after its discovery in 1958. The upper beaks of &quot;G. geiselensis&quot; show possible sexual dimorphism and are wider than those of &quot;G. giganteus&quot; and proportionally longer than those of &quot;G. laurenti&quot;.

==Classification==
&quot;Gastornis&quot; and its close relatives are classified together in the family Gastornithidae, and were long considered to be members of the order Gruiformes. However, the traditional concept of Gruiformes has since been shown to be an unnatural grouping. Beginning in the late 1980s with the first phylogenetic analysis of gastornithid relationships, consensus began to grow that they were close relatives of the lineage that includes waterfowl and screamers, the Anseriformes. A 2007 study showed that gastornithids were a very early-branching group of anseriformes, and formed the sister group to all other members of that lineage.

Recognizing the apparent close relationship between gastornithids and waterfowl, some researchers classify gastornithids within the anseriform group itself. Others restrict the name Anseriformes only to the crown group formed by all modern species, and label the larger group including extinct relatives of anseriformes, like the gastornithids, with the name Anserimorphae. Gastornithids are therefore sometimes placed in their own order, Gastornithiformes. A 2024 study, however, found little support for Gastornithiformes and instead places &quot;Gastornis&quot; as a member of the Galliformes crown group, as more closely related to Phasianoidea than to megapodes, being sister to the extinct Sylviornithidae, a recently extinct group of medium-sized flightless birds known from subfossil deposits in the Western Pacific.

A simplified version of the family tree found by Agnolin &quot;et al.&quot; in 2007 is reproduced below.

As of 2024, at least three species are confidently placed within the genus &quot;Gastornis&quot;: &quot;G. parisiensis&quot; (type species), &quot;G. russelli&quot; and &quot;G. laurenti&quot;. The type species, &quot;Gastornis parisiensis&quot;, was named and described by Hébert in two 1855 papers. It is known from fossils found in western and central Europe, dating from the late Paleocene to the early Eocene. Other species previously considered distinct, but which are now considered synonymous with &quot;G. parisiensis&quot;, include &quot;G. edwardsii&quot; (Lemoine, 1878) and &quot;G. klaasseni&quot; (Newton, 1885). Additional European species of &quot;Gastornis&quot; are &quot;G. russelli&quot; (Martin, 1992) from the late Paleocene of Berru, France, and &quot;G. sarasini&quot; (Schaub, 1929) from the early-middle Eocene. The supposed small species &quot;G. minor&quot; is considered to be a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;.

Named in 2020, &quot;G. laurenti&quot; is the most recently described species of &quot;Gastornis&quot; from southwestern France. The holotype (MHNT.PAL.2018.20.1) is a nearly complete mandible which differs from other species within the genus, and the paratypes consist of the maxilla, right quadrate, femur shaft, tibiotarsus (two left and one right) and six cervical vertebrae. A 2024 study attributed more postcranial remains from the same locality to &quot;G. laurenti&quot;.

===Possible species and synonyms===

&quot;Gastornis giganteus&quot; (Cope, 1876), formerly &quot;Diatryma gigantea&quot;, dates from the middle Eocene of western North America. Its junior synonyms include &quot;Barornis regens&quot; (Marsh, 1894) and possibly &quot;Omorhamphus storchii&quot; (Sinclair, 1928). &quot;O. storchii&quot; was described based on fossils from lower Eocene rocks of Wyoming. The species was named in honor of T. C. von Storch, who found the fossils remains in Princeton 1927 Expedition. The fossil bones originally described as &quot;Omorhamphus storchii&quot; are considered to be the remains of a juvenile &quot;Gastornis giganteus&quot; by Brodkorb (1967), but Louchart et al. (2021) argued that no definitive juvenile specimens of &quot;G. giganteus&quot; are known and that the two taxa have no known association, so there is no unambiguous evidence to support this synonymy. Specimen YPM PU 13258 from lower Eocene Willwood Formation rocks of Park County, Wyoming also seems to be a juvenile – perhaps also of &quot;G. giganteus&quot;, in which case it would be an even younger individual.

&quot;G. geiselensis&quot;, from the middle Eocene of Messel, Germany, has been considered a synonym of &quot;G. sarasini&quot;; however, other researchers have stated that there is currently insufficient evidence to synonymize the two, and that they should be kept separate at least pending a more detailed comparison of all gastornithids.

In 2024, Gerald Mayr and colleagues argued against the synonymy of &quot;Diatryma&quot; with &quot;Gastornis&quot; based on the distinct features of the coracoid and tarsometatarsus of &quot;G. giganteus&quot; and &quot;G. geiselensis&quot;, referred to as &quot;D. gigantea&quot; and &quot;D. geiselensis&quot; in the paper, when compared to those of &quot;G. parisiensis&quot;. They further suggested that these two features support the placement of &quot;G. sarasini&quot; within &quot;Diatryma&quot; as &quot;D. sarasini&quot;, and that assigning all species of gastornithiforms to the genus &quot;Gastornis&quot; would not properly reflect the interrelationships of this taxonomic group. A simplified version of their phylogenetic analysis is reproduced below:

A tibiotarsus (upper foot bone) originally described in 1980 as &quot;Zhongyuanus xichuanensis&quot; from the early Eocene of Henan, China, was suggested to be an Asian species of &quot;Gastornis&quot; in 2013. However, the 2024 study which argued against the synonymy of &quot;Diatryma&quot; with &quot;Gastornis&quot; suggested that this fragmentary Chinese taxon cannot be confidently assigned to either &quot;Diatryma&quot; or &quot;Gastornis&quot;, and thus more evaluation is required to clarify its taxonomic affinities.

==Paleobiology==

===Diet===

A long-standing debate surrounding &quot;Gastornis&quot; is the interpretation of its diet. It has often been depicted as a predator of contemporary small mammals, which famously included the early horse &quot;Eohippus&quot;. However, with the size of &quot;Gastornis&quot; legs, the bird would have had to have been more agile to catch fast-moving prey than the fossils suggest it to have been. Consequently, &quot;Gastornis&quot; has been suspected to have been an ambush hunter and/or used pack hunting techniques to pursue or ambush prey; if &quot;Gastornis&quot; was a predator, it would have certainly needed some other means of hunting prey through the dense forest. Alternatively, it could have used its strong beak for eating large or strong vegetation.

The skull of &quot;Gastornis&quot; is massive in comparison to those of living ratites of similar body size. Biomechanical analysis of the skull suggests that the jaw-closing musculature was enormous. The lower jaw is very deep, resulting in a lengthened moment arm of the jaw muscles. Both features strongly suggest that &quot;Gastornis&quot; could generate a powerful bite. Some scientists have proposed that the skull of &quot;Gastornis&quot; was &#x27;overbuilt&#x27; for a herbivorous diet and support the traditional interpretation of &quot;Gastornis&quot; as a carnivore that used its powerfully constructed beak to subdue struggling prey and crack open bones to extract marrow. Others have noted the apparent lack of predatory features in the skull, such as a prominently hooked beak, as evidence that &quot;Gastornis&quot; was a specialized herbivore (or even an omnivore) of some sort, perhaps having used its large beak to crack hard foods like nuts and seeds. Footprints attributed to gastornithids (possibly a species of &quot;Gastornis&quot; itself), described in 2012, showed that these birds lacked strongly hooked talons on the hind legs, another line of evidence suggesting that they did not have a predatory lifestyle.

Recent evidence suggests that &quot;Gastornis&quot; was likely a true herbivore. Studies of the calcium isotopes in the bones of specimens of &quot;Gastornis&quot; by Thomas Tutken and colleagues showed no evidence that it had meat in its diet. The geochemical analysis further revealed that its dietary habits were similar to those of both herbivorous dinosaurs and mammals when it was compared to known fossil carnivores, such as &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;, leaving phorusrhacids and bathornithids as the only major carnivorous flightless birds. The first in situ preserved gastroliths in a specimen of &quot;G. geiselensis&quot; (or &quot;D. geiselensis&quot;) also conforms to its herbivorous diet.

===Eggs===
In Late Paleocene deposits of Spain and early Eocene deposits of France, shell fragments of huge eggs have turned up, namely in Provence. These were described as the ootaxon &quot;Ornitholithus&quot; and are presumably from &quot;Gastornis&quot;. While no direct association exists between &quot;Ornitholithus&quot; and &quot;Gastornis&quot; fossils, no other birds of sufficient size are known from that time and place; while the large &quot;Diogenornis&quot; and &quot;Eremopezus&quot; are known from the Eocene, the former lived in South America (still separated from North America by the Tethys Ocean then) and the latter is only known from the Late Eocene of North Africa, which also was separated by an (albeit less wide) stretch of the Tethys Ocean from Europe.

Some of these fragments were complete enough to reconstruct a size of 24 by 10 cm (about 9.5 by 4 inches) with shells 2.3–2.5 mm (0.09–0.1 in) thick, roughly half again as large as an ostrich egg and very different in shape from the more rounded ratite eggs. If &quot;Remiornis&quot; is indeed correctly identified as a ratite (which is quite doubtful, however), &quot;Gastornis&quot; remains as the only known animal that could have laid these eggs. At least one species of &quot;Remiornis&quot; is known to have been smaller than &quot;Gastornis&quot;, and was initially described as &quot;Gastornis minor&quot; by Mlíkovský in 2002. This would nicely match the remains of eggs a bit smaller than those of the living ostrich, which have also been found in Paleogene deposits of Provence, were it not for the fact that these eggshell fossils also date from the Eocene, but no &quot;Remiornis&quot; bones are yet known from that time.

===Footprints===

Several sets of fossil footprints are suspected to belong to &quot;Gastornis&quot;. One set of footprints was reported from late Eocene gypsum at Montmorency and other locations of the Paris Basin in the 19th century, from 1859 onwards. Described initially by Jules Desnoyers, and later on by Alphonse Milne-Edwards, these trace fossils were celebrated among French geologists of the late 19th century. They were discussed by Charles Lyell in his &quot;Elements of Geology&quot; as an example of the incompleteness of the fossil record – no bones had been found associated with the footprints. Unfortunately, these fine specimens, which sometimes even preserved details of the skin structure, are now lost. They were brought to the Muséum national d&#x27;histoire naturelle when Desnoyers started to work there, and the last documented record of them deals with their presence in the geology exhibition of the MNHN in 1912. The largest of these footprints, although only consisting of a single toe&#x27;s impression, was 40 cm (16 in) long. The large footprints from the Paris Basin could also be divided into huge and merely large examples, much like the eggshells from southern France, which are 20 million years older.

Another footprint record consists of a single imprint that still exists, though it has proven to be even more controversial. It was found in late Eocene Puget Group rocks in the Green River valley near Black Diamond, Washington. After its discovery, it raised considerable interest in the Seattle area in May–July 1992, being subject of at least two longer articles in the &quot;Seattle Times&quot;. Variously declared a hoax or genuine, this apparent impression of a single bird foot measures about wide by long and lacks a hallux (hind toe); it was described as the ichnotaxon &quot;Ornithoformipes controversus&quot;. Fourteen years after the initial discovery, the debate about the find&#x27;s authenticity was still unresolved. The specimen is now at Western Washington University.The problem with these early trace fossils is that no fossil of &quot;Gastornis&quot; has been found to be younger than about 45 million years. In North America, the fossil record of unequivocal gastornithids seems to end even earlier than in Europe. However, in 2009, a landslide near Bellingham, Washington exposed at least 18 tracks on 15 blocks in the Eocene Chuckanut Formation. The anatomy and age (about 53.7 Ma old) of the tracks suggest that the track maker was &quot;Gastornis&quot;. Although these birds have long been considered to be predators or scavengers, the absence of raptor-like claws supports earlier suggestions that they were herbivores. The Chuckanut tracks are named as the ichnotaxon &quot;Rivavipes giganteus&quot;, inferred to belong to the extinct family Gastornithidae. At least 10 of the tracks are on display at Western Washington University.

===Feathers===

The plumage of &quot;Gastornis&quot; has generally been depicted in art as a hair-like covering similar to some ratites. This has been based in part on some fibrous strands recovered from a Green River Formation deposit at Roan Creek, Colorado, which were initially believed to represent &quot;Gastornis&quot; feathers and named &quot;Diatryma? filifera&quot;. Subsequent examination has shown the fossil material to not actually be feathers, but root fibers and the species renamed as &quot;Cyperacites filiferus&quot;.

A second possible &quot;Gastornis&quot; feather has since been identified, also from the Green River Formation. Unlike the filamentous plant material, this single isolated feather resembles the body feathers of flighted birds, being broad and vaned. It was tentatively identified as a possible &quot;Gastornis&quot; feather based on its size; the feather measured long and must have belonged to a gigantic bird.

==Distribution==
It has been argued that &quot;Gastornis&quot; has a Holarctic distribution with fossils found in western Europe, North America (including an indeterminate specimen identified as &quot;Gastornis&quot; sp. from Arctic Canada), and possibly central China. The earliest (Paleocene) fossils all come from Europe, and it is likely that the genus originated there. Europe in this epoch was an island continent, and &quot;Gastornis&quot; was the largest terrestrial tetrapod of the landmass. This offers parallels with the Malagasy elephant birds, herbivorous birds that were similarly the largest land animals in the isolated landmass of Madagascar, in spite of otherwise mammalian megafauna.

All other fossil remains are from the Eocene, though it is currently unknown how the genus &quot;Gastornis&quot; dispersed out of Europe and into other continents, and whether such assertion is even true given the potential validity of &quot;Diatryma&quot;. Given the possible presence of &quot;Gastornis&quot; fossils in the early Eocene of western China, these birds may have spread east from Europe and crossed into North America via the Bering land bridge. &quot;Gastornis&quot; also may have spread both east and west, arriving separately in eastern Asia and in North America across the Turgai Strait. Direct landbridges with North America are also known. European &quot;Gastornis&quot; survived somewhat longer than their North American counterparts, which seems to coincide with a period of increased isolation of the continent.

==Extinction==
The reason for the extinction of &quot;Gastornis&quot; is currently unclear. Competition with mammals has often been cited as a possible factor, but &quot;Gastornis&quot; did occur in faunas dominated by mammals, and did co-exist with several megafaunal forms like pantodonts. Likewise, extreme climatic events like the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) appear to have had little impact. Nonetheless, the extended survival in Europe is thought to coincide with increased isolation of the landmass.

<text>The age of majority is the threshold of legal adulthood as recognized or declared in law. It is the moment when a person ceases to be considered a minor, and assumes legal control over their person, actions, and decisions, thus terminating the control and legal responsibilities of their parents or guardian over them.

Most countries set the age of majority at 18, but some jurisdictions have a higher age and others lower. The word &quot;majority&quot; here refers to having greater years and being of full age as opposed to &quot;minority&quot;, the state of being a minor. The law in a given jurisdiction may not actually use the term &quot;age of majority&quot;. The term refers to a collection of laws bestowing the status of adulthood.

==Explanation==
The term &quot;age of majority&quot; can be confused with the similar concept of the &quot;age of license&quot;. As a legal term, &quot;license&quot; means &quot;permission&quot;, referring to a legally enforceable right or privilege. Thus, an age of license is an age at which one has legal permission from a given government to participate in certain activities or rituals. The age of majority, on the other hand, is a legal recognition that one has become an adult.

Many ages of license coincide with the age of majority to recognize the transition to legal adulthood, but they are nonetheless legally distinct concepts. One need not have attained the age of majority to have permission to exercise certain rights and responsibilities. Some ages of license may be higher, lower, or match the age of majority.

For example, to purchase alcoholic beverages, the age of license is 21 in all U.S. states. Another example is the voting age, which prior to 1971 was 21 in the US, as was the age of majority in all or most states. After the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18, the age of majority was lowered to 18 in most states. In most US states, one may obtain a driver&#x27;s license, consent to sexual activity, and gain full-time employment at age 16 even though the age of majority is 18 in most states. In the Republic of Ireland the age of majority is 18, but one must be 21 or over to stand for election to the Houses of the Oireachtas. Also, in Portugal the age of majority is 18, and citizens who have reached that age are also eligible to run for Parliament, but they need to be 35 or over in order to run for President.

A child who is legally emancipated by a court of competent jurisdiction automatically attains to their maturity upon the signing of the court order. Only emancipation confers the status of maturity before a person has actually reached the age of majority. In almost all places, minors who marry are automatically emancipated. Some places also do the same for minors who are in the armed forces or who have a certain degree or diploma.

Minors who are emancipated may be able to choose where they live, sign contracts, and have control over their financial and medical decisions and generally make decisions free from parental control but are not exempt from age requirements set forth in law for other rights. For example, a minor can emancipate at 16 in the US (or younger depending on the state) but must still wait until 18 to vote or buy a firearm, and 21 to buy alcohol or tobacco.

The Jewish Talmud says that every judgment Josiah, the sixteenth king of Judah issued from his coronation until the age of eighteen was reversed and he returned the money to the parties whom he judged liable, due to concern that in his youth he may not have judged the cases correctly. Other Jewish commentators have discussed whether age 13 or 18 is the age to make decisions in a Jewish Court.

Roman law did not have an age of majority in the modern sense, as individuals remained under the authority of the Pater familias until his death. The age of adulthood was set at 12 for girls and 14 for boys, with boys gaining rights such as marriage, military service, and any legal capacity that depended on age only, including, until the introduction of the &quot;Lex Villia&quot;, the ability to be eligible for public office.

The &quot;Lex Plaetoria&quot; allowed those under 25 to contest disadvantageous agreements in case of fraud, later extending to other circumstances, and the other party might escape repercussions only if a &quot;curator&quot; was involved. To enter a contract, individuals in this age group could request the &quot;praetor&quot; for such a &quot;curator&quot;, thus ensuring protection for both sides: this shielded the other contracting party from legal risk and allowed transactions to proceed, as no prudent person would engage without this safeguard. Unlike with a &quot;tutor&quot;, the requester retained full legal capacity to act, and the role of the &quot;curator&quot; was merely to prevent fraud. Later, under Marcus Aurelius, their appointment became mandatory. Someone under 25 who wanted to enter a contract &quot;had to&quot; request a &quot;curator&quot;, and could propose a candidate, which the &quot;praetor&quot; could reject. The &quot;curator&quot;&#x27;s control over property became closer to that of a &quot;tutor&quot;, but it was only applied to the properties that the &quot;praetor&quot; assigned to him, not those acquired by the requester after his appointment.

Over time, there was a gradual evolution, initially focusing on property laws (while other legal matters, such as marriage and wills, continued to have separate age thresholds), eventually arriving at the modern concept of age of majority, commonly set at 18.

Since 2015, some countries have lowered the voting age to 16. Some countries, like England and Wales, are even considering lowering the age of majority to 16, similar to how it already is in Cuba and Scotland. The main argument for lowering is that, on average, young people are much more educated (both because of better individual educational outcomes and being raised by more educated parents) than in the past (the same argument was made in the 1970s when most countries lowered the age of majority from 21 to 18, which remains the age used for most countries, including the United States). Related to newer generations being more educated and being ready for life earlier: compared to the past, information is much more easily accessible as a result of the spread of the Internet, which can be accessed through both the personal computer and the smartphone.

A person reaches the age of majority at midnight at the beginning of the day of that person&#x27;s relevant birthday; under English common law this was not always the case.

==Civil law==
In many countries minors can be emancipated: depending on jurisdiction, this may happen through acts such as marriage, attaining economic self-sufficiency, obtaining an educational degree or diploma, or participating in a form of military service. In the United States, all states have some form of emancipation of minors.

==Religious law==
Religions have their own rules as to the age of maturity, when a child is regarded to be an adult, at least for ritual purposes:
*Islam: Different Islamic fiqh schools have different criteria for adulthood. In general, males are considered adults when they have manifested specific physical attributes such as nocturnal emission and growth of pubic hair. Females are considered adults when they manifest physical attributes such as menstruation, growth of pubic hair, and nocturnal emission. However, in the absence of these physical attributes in either male or female, different schools of fiqh have different rulings on the age limit after which the male or female are considered adults even if they do not manifest any of the physical attributes earlier mentioned. Some schools rule based on the limit being 18 years for both males and females, some 18 for males and 17 for females, and some 15 for both. There is also a distinction in Islamic law between the state of adulthood and the ability to have sexual intercourse.
*Judaism: The age of majority is 13 years for boys (bar mitzvah) and 12 years for girls (bat mitzvah) for religious purposes. However, Jewish law follows (according to some interpretations) the law of the land if there is a difference, such as in marriage age.
*Christianity (only the Roman Catholic Church): 18 years.
*Baháʼí Faith: The spiritual age of maturity for every person born into a Baháʼí family is 15. At 15, the person is old enough to decide for themselves what religion they want to be, so they could decide to stay a Baháʼí or choose a different path. At this age, Baháʼís are considered youth (as opposed to children before 15). Baháʼí youth are 15–21 years old. Once a Baháʼí turns 15, if they declare themselves a Baháʼí, they are expected to recite a daily obligatory prayer and participate in the fast. Baha&#x27;is can vote in Baha&#x27;i elections once they turn 18 (recently changed from 21).

==Effects==
* End of the parental authority and guardianship (in some legal systems it causes the pre-end of said institutions).
* Right to be considered legally capable.
* Right to freely manage and dispose of their goods, buy and sell properties and sign rental contracts.
* Right to inherit, manage the inheritance and, in countries where testaments exist, the possibility of testament.
* Right to receive bank credits and have bank accounts.
* Right to demand public authority.
* Possibility of being sued for not paying debts or other contracts.
* Possibility of being a member of the jury (in countries where trials use a jury).
* Possibility of being sued for child support and medical bills due to the birth of a child.

In some countries, reaching the age of majority carries other rights and obligations, although in other countries, these rights and obligations may be had before or after reaching the aforementioned age.
* Right to vote and to run for government office: although in some countries the minimum voting age may be lower and in other countries there are age restrictions to be elected to certain public offices.
* Right to drive a car: it may vary in some countries with respect to the age of majority.
* Right to drink alcoholic drinks and to smoke tobacco or marijuana: In some countries, the legal drinking age and the smoking age differ from the age of adulthood.
* Right to buy and possess firearms or guns. 
* Right to work, pursue trade, profession or industry: may vary in some countries with respect to the age of majority.
* Right to freely leave the country (in some European countries like Italy, minors can leave the country unimpeded).
* In trials, the possibility of being treated as an adult, found guilty and sentenced to prison: It may vary in some countries with respect to the age of majority.

<doc id="862314" wikidata="Q6960209" url="?curid=862314" title="Nakakubiki District, Niigata">
<text>was a district located in Niigata, Japan.

As of 2003, the district had an estimated population of 70,229 with a density of 104.35 persons per km2. The total area was 673.01 km2.

== Municipalities ==
Prior to its dissolution, the district consisted of five towns and five villages:

* Itakura
* Kakizaki
* Kiyosato
* Kubiki
* Myōkō
* Myōkōkōgen
* Nakagō
* Ōgata
* Sanwa
* Yoshikawa

==History==
The district was founded in 1878, when the former Kubiki District split into Higashikubiki District, Nakakubiki District, and Nishikubiki District. At the time of founding, the district covered most of the city of Jōetsu (excluding the sections of Yasuzuka, Utakawa, Ōshima and Maki from Higashikubiki District, and the section of Nadachi from Nishikubiki District), the city of Myōkō, and parts of the city of Kashiwazaki (the areas of Agewa (Kamiwa), Takaze (Takahane) and Warabino from the former municipality of Kakizaki). The district seat was located at the village of Takagi (now the city of Jōetsu).

===District Timeline===
* In 1911 - The town of Takada was elevated to city status.
* On June 1, 1954 - Both the cities of Naoetsu and Arai were founded by merging with other municipalities.

===Recent mergers===
* On January 1, 2005 - The towns of Itakura, Kakizaki, Ōgata and Yoshikawa, and the villages of Kiyosato, Kubiki, Nakagō and Sanwa, along with the town of Yasuzuka, the villages of Maki, Ōshima and Uragawara (all from Higashikubiki District), and the town of Nadachi (from Nishikubiki District), were merged into the expanded city of Jōetsu.
* On April 1, 2005 - The town of Myōkōkōgen, and the village of Myōkō were absorbed into the expanded city of Arai and was later renamed the city to Myōkō at the same time. Therefore, Nakakubiki District was dissolved as a result of this merger.

<text>John Farmer (c. 1570c. 1601) was an important composer of the English Madrigal School. He was born in England during the Elizabethan period, and was also known by his skillful settings for four voices of the old church psalm tunes. His exact date of birth is not known – a 1926 article by Grattan Flood posits a date around 1564 to 1565 based on matriculation records. Farmer was under the patronage of the Earl of Oxford and dedicated his collection of canons and his late madrigal volume to his patron.

In 1595, Farmer was appointed organist and master of children at Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, and also, at the same time, organist of St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin. In 1599, he moved to London and published his only collection of four-part madrigals, which he dedicated to Edward de Vere.

His Lord&#x27;s Prayer is performed widely throughout many churches and cathedrals, mostly in Britain. It is included in Volume 2 of &quot;Oxford Choral Classics&quot;, published by Oxford University Press.

Giles Farnaby dedicated a pavan to him, included in the &quot;Fitzwilliam Virginal Book&quot; as &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Paven&quot; (no. CCLXXXVII).

Farmer&#x27;s &quot;Divers &amp; Sundry Waies&quot; was the source of the fugues in Michael Maier&#x27;s book, &quot;Atalanta Fugiens&quot;. Of the 50 three-part fugues in &quot;Atalanta Fugiens&quot;, 40 have been shown by Ludwig to be based on Farmer&#x27;s compositions in &quot;Divers &amp; Sundry Waies&quot;.

<doc id="862321" wikidata="Q3279146" url="?curid=862321" title="Te Wiki o te Reo Māori">
<text> () is a government-sponsored initiative intended to encourage New Zealanders to promote the use of the Māori language which is an official language of the country. Māori Language Week is part of a broader movement to revive the Māori language. It has been celebrated since 1975 and is currently spearheaded by (the Ministry of Māori Development) and the Māori Language Commission, with many organisations including schools, libraries, and government departments participating.

== History ==

In the early 1970s as a part of the Māori protest movement, activist group Ngā Tamatoa, the Te Reo Māori Society of Victoria University, and Te Huinga Rangatahi (the New Zealand Māori Students’ Association) presented a petition to Parliament, petitioned the government to teach te reo in schools. On 14 September 1972, this petition, signed by over 30,000 people was delivered to Parliament, and became a major event in the revitalisation of te reo in New Zealand. 14 September quickly began to be celebrated as Māori Language Day, and by 1975, this had grown to become the first Māori Language Week.

===2008===

The week in 2008 saw the release of Google Māori, a Māori-language translation of the search engine created as a collaboration between Potaua and Nikolasa Biasiny-Tule of Tangatawhenua.com, the Māori Language Commission and Google. The process took over a year and involved more than 40 people on the project, due to the difficulty of translating the technical terminology.

===2014===

For te Wiki o te Reo Māori in 2014, musicians Stan Walker, Ria Hall, Troy Kingi and Maisey Rika collaborated on the song &quot;Aotearoa&quot;, as a challenge to get a second song in te reo to reach number one in New Zealand (after &quot;Poi E&quot; in 1984).

===2015===

On 2 August 2015 the Black Caps (the New Zealand national cricket team) played under the name of Aotearoa for their first match against Zimbabwe to celebrate Māori Language Week.

===2016===

Maimoa (then known as Pūkana and Whānau), a musical group created from the presenters of the Māori Television show &quot;Pūkana&quot; celebrated te Wiki o te Reo Māori by releasing the single &quot;Maimoatia&quot;, written with Te Haumihiata Mason. The song topped the iTunes downloads chart in New Zealand, reaching number 4 on the Official New Zealand Music Chart&#x27;s subchart for New Zealand musicians.

===2017===

The 2016 Disney film &quot;Moana&quot; was dubbed into Māori, premiering in Auckland on 11 September as a part of te Wiki o te Reo Māori 2017. Rachel House, Jemaine Clement, Temuera Morrison, and Oscar Kightley, all cast members of the original English language version of the film, reprised their respective roles in the te reo version. During the week, 30 theatres across the country held free screenings of the reo version.

===2019===
During Māori Language Week 2019, it was reported in New Zealand media that even kaumātua (elders) were learning te reo (Māori language). It was also reported that more than one fifth of book sales during that week were Māori.

To mark the 20th anniversary of the 1999 Rugby World Cup semi-final, where Hinewehi Mohi performed the national anthem in te reo, Mohi created &quot;Waiata / Anthems&quot;, an album where 11 New Zealand musicians re-recorded songs into te reo Māori. The album debuted at number 1 on the Official New Zealand Music Chart, and was one of the most successful albums of 2019 in New Zealand.

===2021===

At midday on 14 September 2021, te Wiki o te Reo Māori was celebrated with Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori – the Māori Language Moment, where over 1.1 million people pledged to use te reo at the same time. On the same day, the Māori Party launched a petition to change the country&#x27;s name to Aotearoa.

Due to the success of &quot;Waiata / Anthems&quot; in 2019, the project was expanded to become Waiata Anthems Week, an annual release of a playlist in te reo Māori, with the goal of making the New Zealand music scene more bilingual. In 2021, more than 30 musicians participated in the project, including Six60, whose single &quot;Pepeha&quot; debuted at number two on the Official New Zealand Music Chart. Te Tairāwhiti (Gisborne Region)-based choir Ka Hao also saw charting success, with their single collaborating with songwriter Rob Ruha, &quot;35&quot; (a reference to State Highway 35), reaching number 25. September saw the release of many albums by popular musicians sung in te reo, including Lorde&#x27;s &quot;Te Ao Mārama&quot;, Stan Walker&#x27;s &quot;Te Arohanui&quot;, Alien Weaponry&#x27;s &quot;Tangaroa&quot;, and Ka Hao&#x27;s &quot;Ka Hao: One Tira, One Voice&quot;.

=== 2022 ===

The 2022 celebrations of Te Wiki o te Reo Māori marked 50 years since the Māori Language Petition was presented to parliament. To celebrate Te Wiki o te Reo Māori, Whittaker&#x27;s released a special edition version of their milk chocolate, rebranded as Miraka Kirīmi (creamy milk) in te reo. The rebranding caused widescale controversy due to racist backlash criticising the rebranding, and sparked a response to support the naming of the chocolate bar in te reo.

The third Waiata / Anthems week was held prior to Te Wiki o te Reo Māori, including over 20 musicians releasing new music in te reo, and a new series of TVNZ documentaries following popular musicians producing Māori language songs. Among the most successful songs from the 2022 waiata include &quot;Whāia te Māramatanga (Walk Right Up)&quot; by Ladi6, a reimagining of Split Enz&#x27; &quot;Six Months in a Leaky Boat&quot; (1982) performed by Tim Finn and Hana Mereraiha, a remix of Moana and the Moahunters&#x27; 1991 single &quot;AEIOU&quot; by Tiki Taane, and &quot;Ka Taria&quot;, performed by Rob Ruha and Drax Project.

<text>In numerical analysis, continuous [[wavelet]]s are functions used by the continuous wavelet transform. These functions are defined as analytical expressions, as functions either of time or of frequency.
Most of the continuous wavelets are used for both wavelet decomposition and composition transforms. That is they are the continuous counterpart of orthogonal wavelets.

The following continuous wavelets have been invented for various applications:

* Poisson wavelet
* Morlet wavelet
* Modified Morlet wavelet
* Mexican hat wavelet
* Complex Mexican hat wavelet
* Shannon wavelet
* Meyer wavelet
* Difference of Gaussians
* Hermitian wavelet
* Beta wavelet
* Causal wavelet
* μ wavelets
* Cauchy wavelet
* Addison wavelet
