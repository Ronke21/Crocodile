<text>American Type Founders (ATF) Co. was a business trust created in 1892 by the merger of 23 type foundries, representing about 85 percent of all type manufactured in the United States at the time. The new company, consisting of a consolidation of firms from throughout the United States, was incorporated in New Jersey.

The American Type Founders Co. should not be confused with the American Type Founders&#x27; Association, also called the Type Founders&#x27; Association of the United States. Both institutions are identified by the same acronym, ATF. The ATF Association was formed in 1864 and was responsible for establishing the American point system in 1886 based on 83 picas exactly equal to 35 cm. The ATF Co. was not formed until 1892. All but six of the 23 foundries in the company were members of the ATF Association.

The American Type Founders Co. was the dominant American manufacturer of metal type from its creation in 1892 until at least the 1940s; it continued to be influential into the 1960s. Many fonts developed by the ATF Co. in its period of dominance, including News Gothic, Century Schoolbook, Franklin Gothic, Hobo and Bank Gothic, remain in everyday use.

==Type founding before the ATF Co.==
By the beginning of the final decade of the nineteenth century, type founding was in a state of crisis. With the introduction of the Linotype, which could cast whole lines of body type in house, demand for hand-set type was in decline. Throughout the late 1880s, prices had been maintained by an informal cartel of foundries, but as the number of foundries increased, prices dropped dramatically, a trend accelerated by the invention of hot metal typesetting. Additionally, type at this time was not standardized, either to body size or to base line, and printers resented the incompatibility of types from different foundries. Leaders in the industry, notably Joseph W. Phinney of the Dickinson Type Foundry in Boston, set up a committee to address these problems, eventually recommending consolidation.

==Consolidation and early years==

By the late 1880s, there were some 34 foundries in the United States. In 1892, 23 foundries were brought together to form the American Type Founders Company. The Chicago Tribune (February 12, 1892) listed the 23 foundries as:
* MacKellar, Smiths, &amp; Jordan, Co. (Philadelphia),
* Collins &amp; M’Leester (Philadelphia),
* Pelouse &amp; Co. (Philadelphia),
* James Conner&#x27;s Sons (New York City),
* P. A. Heinrich (New York City),
* A. W. Lindsay (New York City),
* Charles J. Carey &amp; Co. (Baltimore),
* John Ryan Co. (Baltimore),
* J. G. Mengel &amp; Co. (Baltimore),
* Hooper, Wilson &amp; Co. (Baltimore),
* Boston Type Foundry (Boston),
* Phelps, Dalton &amp; Co. (Boston),
* Lyman &amp; Son (Buffalo),
* Allison &amp; Smith (Cincinnati),
* Cincinnati Type Foundry (Cincinnati),
* Cleveland Type Foundry (Cleveland),
* Marder, Luse, &amp; Co. (Chicago),
* Union Type Foundry (Chicago),
* Benton, Waldo &amp; Co. (Milwaukee),
* Central Type Foundry (St. Louis),
* St. Louis Type Foundry (St. Louis),
* Kansas City Type Foundry (Kansas City), and
* Palmer &amp; Rey (San Francisco).
Other foundries joined later. The key to the success of this merger was the inclusion of MacKellar, Smiths, &amp; Jordan Co. of Philadelphia, with assets of over $6 million, the Cincinnati Type Foundry of Henry Barth, which brought with it the patents to his Barth Typecaster, and Benton, Waldo Foundry of Milwaukee, which included Linn Boyd Benton and his all-important Benton Pantograph which engraved type matrices directly instead of using punches and allowed the optical scaling of type. With the inclusion of the Barth Caster and the Benton Pantograph, ATF immediately became the largest and the most technologically advanced foundry in the world.

Conditions for the first few years were chaotic: while 12 foundries ceased separate operations immediately member foundries continued to operate as if they were independent firms. Real consolidation did not begin until 1894, when Robert Wickham Nelson, principal owner of the Throne Typesetting Machine Company and a new stockholder in ATF, became general manager. He immediately began to liquidate unprofitable ventures, eliminate duplications, and force the various branches to do business under the ATF name instead of retaining their former ones. Linn Boyd Benton&#x27;s son, Morris Fuller Benton, was given the job of purging obsolete and duplicated type faces from the catalogs, and standardizing the point size and baseline of the types made. Nelson, realizing that display and advertising type (rather than the body type that was set so efficiently by the new line-casters) would be the mainstay of the foundry type business, immediately began an extensive advertising campaign and commissioned the production of new type designs. Joseph W. Phinney was put in charge of the design department and he supervised the introduction of Cushing, Howland, Bradley, and the William Morris-inspired Satanick and Jenson Oldstyle, the last of these being hugely successful. Young Benton was then commissioned to finish Lewis Buddy&#x27;s Elbert Hubbard-inspired Roycroft, another successful introduction.

While Phinney often used freelance designers, like Will Bradley, T.M. Cleland, Walter Dorwin Teague, Frederic Goudy, and Oz Cooper, the bulk of ATF&#x27;s catalog through the 1930s was developed in-house, under the direction of Morris Fuller Benton. Under Benton&#x27;s direction, the company embarked on a program of developing historical revivals, including ATF&#x27;s versions of Bodoni and Garamond, as well as the development of new typefaces such as Century and (most successfully) Cheltenham, which for the first time were organized systematically into &quot;type families&quot; with a schedule of styles such as weight or width.

Another key player at the ATF Co. at this time was the advertising manager (and informal company historian) Henry Lewis Bullen, who in 1908 began assembling a library of historical typography and type specimen books for designers to draw upon. This collection was turned over to Columbia University&#x27;s Rare Book and Manuscript Library in 1936, and acquired by the university in 1941. The books form the core of the book arts collection at Columbia. There is also an archive of ATF materials in Columbia&#x27;s special collections.

In 1901, Nelson consolidated casting operations in a purpose-built factory in Jersey City and the branches remained only as distribution centers. By the 1920s, ATF had offices in 27 American cities and Vancouver, British Columbia, where it sold not only type, but pressroom supplies and printing presses (their own Kelly line and those of other manufacturers) as well. It printed large specimen books, with many examples of good layout as examples for the advertising market. In 1923, at a cost of $300,000, ATF produced its largest and most superlative type catalog. Sixty thousand of these opulent books, printed extensively in color, were distributed, and to this day they are considered to be masterpieces of the art of letterpress printing. The first paragraph of its preface boasted:

The printing of 1923 is greatly superior to that of 1900. It has better style, more attractiveness and greater power and dignity...This great improvement has not come to pass without direction. There has been, in fact, very deliberate direction. There has been constant and forward thinking on behalf of the printing industry by the American Type Founders Company, which has a well defined policy with regard to the types it is making and has been making during the last quarter century. In what position, may we ask, would the printing industry be to-day without the great type families, known to fame as Cheltenham, Century &quot;[long list follows]&quot; and others? Are there anywhere any other type families? Would not your typography be barren in appearance and much less profitable to the advertisers if these great type designs had not been developed? There can be but one answer.

By the time Nelson died in 1926, the ATF Co. seemed to be on the path to permanent profitability.

Nelson&#x27;s successor as president, Frank Belknap Berry (originally one of the founders of the Cleveland Type Foundry), was unpopular with the board and he was soon replaced by Joseph F. Gillick, whose first move was to shut down ATF&#x27;s subsidiary Barnhard Brothers &amp; Spindler in Chicago and bring their casting operations to Jersey City. Though the years immediately after Nelson&#x27;s passing were disappointing, 1929 was the most profitable in ATF history.

== Letterpress manufacturing ==
From 1914 to 1959 ATF manufactured letterpresses. During the 1920s and 1930s they also sold presses made by &quot;Chandler &amp; Price&quot;, &quot;Laureate&quot;, and &quot;Thomson National Company&quot;.

=== Kelly Presses ===
When William M. Kelly (1869–1949), an employee in the sales department, proposed a design of automatic cylinder press, Nelson immediately authorized the project. The Kelly Style B Press, a three-roller, two-revolution, flat-bed cylinder press with automatic feeder and jogger was introduced in 1914 to great success. By 1923 more than 2,500 Kelly Presses had been sold and the next year production was shifted from Jersey City to a large new factory in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Several models were developed and, by 1949, more than 11,000 Kelly presses had been sold.

* &quot;Kelly Series B&quot;, 17 × 22&quot; press sheet, produced 1914–1937
* &quot;Kelly Model #2&quot;, 22 × 34&quot; press sheet, introduced in 1921
* &quot;Kelly Automatic Jobber&quot;, 13 × 19.5&quot; press sheet, introduced in 1923
* &quot;Kelly Series A&quot; (&quot;Baby Kelly&quot;), 13.5 × 22&quot; press sheet, introduced in 1925
* &quot;Kelly Model #1&quot;, 22 × 28&quot; press sheet, introduced in 1929
* &quot;Kelly Series C&quot;, 17 × 22&quot; press sheet, produced 1937–1954 (1959 UK)
* &quot;Kelly Clipper&quot; (&quot;the Pressman&#x27;s Press&quot;), 14 × 20&quot; press sheet, produced 1938-1941
* &quot;Kelly Model #3&quot;, 25 × 38&quot; press sheet, produced 1949–1954 (1959 UK)

Production of Kelly presses ceased at ATF in 1954, though Vickers continued to produce two models in England until 1959.

=== Golding Press Division ===
In 1918 Golding &amp; Company, a type foundry that also manufactured the Pearl line of letterpress, was acquired by ATF. These presses continued to be made and sold by the Golding Press Division of ATF until 1927, when the division was sold off to Thomson National Company.

=== Klymax Feeder ===
In addition to selling presses made by Chandler &amp; Price, ATF produced the Klymax Feeder, which turned C&amp;P&#x27;s hand-fed Gordon jobber press into an automatically fed press. As such presses were ubiquitous, sales of this feeder were robust throughout the 1920s.

=== Little Giant ===
In the post-war years, ATF produced the Little Giant Automatic Cylinder Press, a smaller (12&quot; x 18&quot; sheet size), more compact press of much more modern design than the Kelly presses. Production of this press ceased in 1959.

==Depression and bankruptcy==
Unfortunately for ATF, unlike printing consumables (like paper and ink), which must be purchased anew for each job, type wears slowly and its purchase can be postponed in hard times, while capital investment in new presses simply dries up, and so ATF was especially hard hit by the Depression. Also, the company had been over-extended in the boom years, too much credit had been extended to the trade, inventories were bloated, and the corps of executives (many left over from pre-consolidation days) were older and without vision. With the financial downturn after 1929 ATF began to see serious distress. In 1931 hours were cut at the factories. The following year, sales were down another 25% and salaries were cut. When major accounting errors showed the company to be even less profitable than was thought, Gillick was forced to resign.

Thomas Roy Jones, a businessman with no experience in type founding, replaced Gillick. By 1933 the situation was desperate. Sales of type were less than 30% of 1926 levels while purchases of Kelly presses had plummeted to a mere 6.8% of what they had been. In October 1933 Jones filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy. ATF was placed under the control of its creditors (chiefly consisting of several banks) and drastic measures were taken. Operations were consolidated, the Jersey City plant was closed and the typecasting operations moved to the Kelly plant in Elizabeth. Salesmen were put on a commission basis. Inventories were cut, faces discontinued, and production of several models of Kelly press as well as the Klymax Feeder was shut down. ATF was released from court supervision in 1936, and in 1938 a sales study was made making the following observations: the Kelly press was obsolete, body type was now the exclusive province of line-casters and display type would have to be the mainstay of type production, almost half of what ATF was selling was other manufacturers&#x27; products that could easily be made in their own facilities, the acquisition of or merger with another firm in the letterpress industry would be desirable, as offset was a rising technology ATF needed to invest in that business.

==Offset presses==
In 1938, ATF purchased the Webendorfer-Wills Company and began producing their models of offset press. ATF sold these presses under the Chief name, marketing a Little Chief, Chief, and Big Chief. Large press (as opposed to duplicator) production continued until the late 1970s when the 25&quot; Profiteer was discontinued as the basic Webendorfer design became obsolete. Once again, ATF had made the mistake they had with the Kelly press of complacently taking profits from a successful product, not investing in improvements, and eventually seeing this product become irretrievably overtaken by the competition. Beginning in the 1970s, arrangements to sell large offset presses under the Chief name were made with other manufacturers, first with MAN Roland and then with Solna.

==War work and postwar direction==
During the Second World War, the ATF plant in Elizabeth was converted almost entirely over to military production. Barth Casters were used to make firing pins and ATF operated two plants in Newark making ordnance.

After the war, ill-conceived efforts were made to diversify. A furniture manufacturer, Dystrom Corporation, was acquired. A competitor, Lanston Monotype, was purchased in 1969, but nothing came of this, the assets being sold off later to M&amp;H Typefounders.

The decline of foundry type in this period might well be illustrated by the size of ATF specimen books. While the magnificent 1923 catalog was typical of its day at 1148 pages, subsequent editions were ever smaller. The 1934 catalog was only 207 pages, while the 1941 catalog was only slightly smaller at 191 pages. By 1956 the &quot;descriptive index of types&quot; was down to only 24 pages, but this recovered a little by 1966&#x27;s catalog of 30 pages. The last ATF catalog, published in 1976 and distributed right to the end, was down to only 14 pages and, by the 1980s, came with an insert listing the faces that were no longer available.

Some innovations did take place during this period however. The brilliant lettering artist Charles H. Hughes was engaged to produce a new version of the popular Century Type that would reproduce the same in offset and letterpress and the result was the lovely Century Nova (1965). ATF also produced the first optically scanning typeface, OCR-A, in 1969 and this remains the standard on printed bank checks to this day.

==Photocomposition==
A venture was made into photocomposition with the ATF Typesetter. Introduced in 1958, the first model was the &quot;A&quot;. Not many were produced because the character fit left much to be desired. The most common model was the &quot;B&quot;. Character fit was improved by expanding the Friden Flexowriter &quot;Justowriter&quot; escape mechanism to seven units. The first seven-unit typeface designed for the ATF Typesetter was a version of Baskerville by Tommy Thompson. The last and most advanced model based on the Friden mechanism was the &quot;B-8&quot;, where an 18-increment system, was achieved by means of a series of electro-mechanical relays that could add one or two increments which were one-third of a unit to selected characters, without changing the basic mechanical escape mechanism of the model &quot;B&quot;, except that it was scaled back to six units. This achieved an 18-unit system like that of the Monotype, but a single unit was called an &quot;increment&quot;, while a group of three units was called a &quot;unit&quot; because those were the units dealt with in the Justowriter mechanism which previous models of the ATF Typesetter used exclusively.

ATF also was the authorized sales agent in the United States and several other countries for another film setting machine, the Hadego, which was a headliner, manufactured in the Netherlands from 1951, under license from its inventor, Hans de Goeij.

The last phototypesetter designed and produced by ATF was the Photocomp 20, so named because of its rated speed of twenty 11-pica newspaper lines per minute. It featured four stepper motors (1) to move the film across, (2) to move the type disk, (3) to advance the film to the next line, and (4) to set the size of one unit of escapement. Type disks contained four fonts, each including 17 pi characters. Its controller was the first ATF controller utilizing integrated circuits in place of relays. Circuitry was based on Motorola DTL integrated circuits. Machine styling of the Photocomp 20 was by Richard Arbib. Only 17 machines were sold: one in Vienna Austria, and the remainder in North America.

ATF produced type disks with all their popular type faces. These disks were concentric rings of fonts on a transparent plastic material in negative form. Usually these disks contained roman, italic and bold versions of the same face. There was even a disk with the only Canadian type design at the time, called &quot;Cartier&quot;. The ATF Phototypesetter was sold worldwide—in Canada, Germany, Italy, Denmark, France, Belgium, England, etc. In Denmark, several newspapers were produced on ATF Phototypesetters by a company named &quot;Reprodan&quot;. As technology improved, ATF failed to keep pace and eventually the line was discontinued.

==Duplicators==
In the mid-1950s the small offset (duplicator) market was dominated by Addressograph-Multilith&#x27;s Multi-1250 almost without competition. A study undertaken by Whitin Machine Works, a manufacturer of textile making machinery looking to expand out of an industry depressed by the introduction of synthetic fabrics, suggested that &quot;quick printing&quot; done with duplicators was a growing market. Whitin thus acquired ATF in 1957, began to manufacture a small (10 x 15&quot; sheet size) duplicator at their Whitinsville, Massachusetts facility, and to market this under the name ATF Chief 15. The basic design was by Louis Mestre, and it incorporated many large press features as he had free use of Webendorfer patents. As it gave large press performance, it was an immediate success with commercial printers (who were disdainful of duplicators), and the Chief line remained the best of the small presses until the introduction of Heidelberg&#x27;s T-Offset in the late 1980s. A larger Chief 17 was introduced in the 1960s and the 1970s saw &quot;common blanket&quot; two color models of both the 15 and 17. Both Chief models were made and sold in Europe by Gestetner Cyclograph Company, and were also marketed in the United States by the Itek and Ditto corporations.

Though the Chief could produce superlative work, unlike the highly popular A.B. Dick 350, it required a skilled operator. Unfortunately for ATF, the quick printing industry had less use for such quality work and more need of a &quot;fast and dirty&quot; duplicator like the 350 and so its market penetration was limited.

In 1966 White Consolidated Industries acquired the Whitin Machine Works and with it control of ATF.

ATF later purchased the competing Davidson line of duplicators and changed their name to ATF-Davidson. Breaking their pattern of low investment in upgrading technology, ATF actually developed improved models of the Davidson and this line remained competitive right to the end. The Davidson however, was an unusual design (with two, rather than the usual three cylinders) and its popularity remained limited.

==Divestiture of the foundry==
By the 1980s the foundry in Elizabeth, New Jersey was down to only six employees and duplicator manufacture was the principle business of ATF-Davidson. In 1986 foundry was sold off to Kingsley Machines, a maker of foil-stamping type, and the merged company was renamed Kingsley/ATF. Immediately a bid was made to enter the field of digital typography with a software subsidiary being set up in Tucson. With its enormous library of type, and its patents on the optical scaling of type, a digital library of ATF types seemed to be a good investment. As the original drawings of the faces were mostly lost, these fonts had to be scanned from brass matrices, a daunting prospect. The work was well done, but slow, and only four faces (Wedding Text, Thompson Quill Script, Bernhard Fashion, and T.M. Cleland&#x27;s border designs) were ever issued before Kingsley/ATF sought bankruptcy protection in 1993. An auction was held on August 23, 1993, and all the assets of the foundry were sold off, most of the priceless matrices going to scrap dealers. ATF designs remain the property of Kingsley Holding Corporation and are now licensed through Adobe and Bitstream. ATF&#x27;s factory is now an apartment block.

Though ATF is now defunct, some of their original type casting machines and matrix engraving equipment are still in use at The Dale Guild Type Foundry in Howell, New Jersey. This equipment was saved through efforts coordinated by Theo Rehak, the last person trained to run these machines at ATF&#x27;s Elizabeth, New Jersey facility.

==ATF-Davidson and successor corporations==
By the early 1980s, the Chief line needed updating and a crash program was undertaken to produce a press that could compete with the A.B.Dick 9800 series. The SuperChief was thus introduced in 1986 with many flaws. Most of these were worked out, and the basic design was re-launched in 1988 as the X-Press line. Unfortunately, this was too late to save the reputation of the Chief line and the company shut down in July 1990. After a period of confusion, Jim Hughes of Printer&#x27;s Parts Store purchased the assets of the company and operated under the name of ATF-Graphic Products, selling presses that were on hand and supplying spare parts. Wishing to revive the Davidson line of presses, the Chief line was sold off to Jim Wheet who now supplies parts for existing presses under the name ATF Services Inc., while it is unclear if Printer&#x27;s Parts remains interested in reviving the Davidson line of presses.

<text>The Ampère was a French combustion automobile built at Billancourt from 1906 to 1909. The car featured a 10/16 hp four-cylinder engine driving through an electric clutch; according to the advertising material, this made for &quot;variation of speed by electric transmission, with neither dynamo nor accumulators&quot;.

<text>The Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) was founded in New York City on December 21, 1969, almost six months after the Stonewall riots, by dissident members of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF). In contrast to the Liberation Front, the Activists Alliance solely and specifically served to gay and lesbian rights, declared themself politically neutral and wanted to work within the political system.

== History ==
The group was incorporated by Hal Weiner, Esq., of Coles &amp; Weiner, a two-person firm, after Weiner defended Sylvia Rivera in a criminal court proceeding where she had been arrested in Times Square while obtaining signatures on a petition for the first proposed LGBTQ legislation in the New York City Council, Intro 475, and charged with soliciting for the purpose of sex, rather than exercising a civil right to petition. The corporate certificate was rejected by the New York State Division of Corporations and State Records, on the grounds that the name was not a fit name for a New York corporation because of the connotation in which the word &quot;gay&quot; was being used, and that the corporation was being formed to violate the sodomy laws of New York. It took five years to win the right to incorporate under that name.

The founding members, seven men and one woman, of the Gay Activists Alliance were dissatisfied members of the Gay Liberation Front. Some of the founding members included Fred Orlansky, Arthur Bell, Arthur Evans, Marty Robinson, Tom Doerr, Peter Marleau, Kay Tobin Lahusen, and Fred Cabellero. The group members wanted to form a &quot;single issue, politically neutral [organization], whose goal would be to &quot;secure basic human rights, dignity and freedom for all gay people.&quot; The political neutrality and single-themedness stood in contrast to the Gay Liberation Front, which allied itself with the radical Black Panther Party, criticized the Vietnam War and had a hard left-wing, anti-capitalistic stance. GAA was most active from 1970 to 1974.

In one action in March 1970, the GAA organized protests against the police raid on the Snake Pit bar in Greenwich Village and the injuries suffered by Diego Viñales in the resulting chaos. These protests helped spark interest in the upcoming Christopher Street Liberation Day events already planned for 28 June. This event, scheduled to commemorate the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots, was the first Pride march celebration in the United States.

In 1973 three GAA members, Tom Wilson Weinberg, Dan Sherbo and Bern Boyle, opened the gay bookstore Giovanni&#x27;s Room at 232 South Street. It was named after James Baldwin&#x27;s gay novel &quot;Giovanni&#x27;s Room&quot;. The store was closed shortly afterward due to a homophobic landlord. The store changed hands to lesbian activist Pat Hill in 1974 and then to Ed Hermance and Arleen Oshan in 1976. Hermance and Olshan moved the store first to 1426 Spruce Street and then to its final location on 12th and Pine in 1979. It has been called the &quot;center of gay Philly&quot;. Philly AIDS Thrift took over the store after the owner retired in 2014 and so the store is now called Philly AIDS Thrift at Giovanni&#x27;s Room, also known as PAT @ Giovanni&#x27;s Room.

The GAA published the &quot;Gay Activist&quot; newspaper until 1980. GAA first met at the Church of the Holy Apostles (9th Ave. &amp; 28th St.) Their next New York City headquarters, the &quot;Firehouse&quot; at 99 Wooster Street in Soho, was occupied in May 1971 and burned down by arsonists on October 15, 1974. &quot;By 1980 GAA had begun to sound like the Gay Liberation Front in 1969. After Activists met to officially disband the Alliance a year later...&quot;

GAA members performed zaps (first conceived by Marty Robinson), raucous public demonstrations designed to embarrass a public figure or celebrity while calling the attention of both gays and straights to issues of LGBT rights. Some of their more visible actions included protests against an anti-gay episode on the popular TV series &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;, many zaps of Mayor John Lindsay at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and later at Radio City Music Hall, a zap against Governor Nelson Rockefeller (the &quot;Rockefeller 5&quot;), a zap at the Marriage License Bureau demanding marriage rights for gays, a zap against Fidelifacts, which provided anti-gay information to employers, a zap at the NYC Taxi Commission (which required gay cab drivers to get an OK from a psychiatrist before being employed), and a zap at the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, which printed a scurrilous editorial attacking &quot;queers, lezzies, pansies, call them what you will.&quot; Four were arrested. Although, GAA was nominally non-violent, zaps could sometimes involve physical altercations and vandalism. GAA co-founder Morty Manford got into scuffles with security and administration during his successful effort to found the student club Gay People at Columbia University in 1971, as well as at a famous protest against homophobia at the elite Inner Circle event in 1972. GAA was associated with a series of combative zaps against homophobic politicians and anti-gay activists in the summer of 1977. Although &quot;Time&quot; magazine derided them as &quot;Gay goons&quot;, the actions succeeded in keeping the conservative backlash of the late-1970s out of New York state.

The GAA Firehouse on Wooster Street also served as a community center and had extremely popular dances that helped fund the organization. The stairwell was decorated with a photomontage agitprop mural created by the British artist Mario Dubsky (1939–85) and the American painter John Button (1929–82) both of whom were early victims of AIDS. The Mural was destroyed in the fire that destroyed the centre in 1974. The symbol of the Gay Activists Alliance was the lower case Greek letter lambda (λ).

== Gay Activist Alliance Committees ==
The Gay Activist Alliance formed multiple sub-committees that allowed the organization to intensely focus on multiple gay and lesbians issue at one time. The committees were named after the issue they were devoted to. The following list of several different sub-committees illustrate the wide-ranging topics the subcommittees covered: Political projects, police power, municipal fair employment law, fair tax, municipal government committee, state government, legal committee, news, leaflets and graphics, fundraising, social affairs, orientations, speakers bureau and agitprop committee.
=== Firehouse Committee ===
This committee was dedicated to the upkeep of the Firehouse, which became its headquarters in 1971. The Firehouse Committee was in charge of organizing its iconic dances that aided in, &quot;fostering Gay solidarity and understanding through social contact among all members of good will in the gay community.&quot; On the &quot;LGBTQ&amp;A&quot; podcast, Charles Silverstein said, &quot;It was paid for through our Saturday night dances where people paid us $2.00 to come to the dance, and all the soda or beer that you want for the night. Through that they paid the rent. It&#x27;s not like there was a lot of fancy furniture in there...I mean, the furniture were the rejects from the street.&quot; Silverstein says GAA meetings drew 200-300 people and the dances drew &quot;easily 1,000.&quot;

=== Lesbian Liberation Committee ===
While the majority demographic of the Gay Activist Alliance were men, this sub-committee was important because it was devoted to planning events in order, &quot;to support a sense of community among all lesbians.&quot;

=== Municipal Fair Employment Law ===
This sub-committee was dedicated to outlawing homosexual job discrimination in both the public and private sector. The purpose of this committee was, &quot;to recommend strategy to GAA for demonstrations and lobbying in order to effect passage in the City Council.&quot;

=== Police Power ===
Similar to the Municipal Fair Employment Law sub-committee, this sub-committee recommended strategies to the rest of the GAA for resisting oppression and discrimination against the gays and lesbian committee.

=== Political Projects ===
This committee oversaw all other political sub-committees in the GAA, because this sub-committee&#x27;s purpose was to recommend the formation of new sub-committees, and also changes in mandates to pre-existing political sub-committees.

=== Social Affairs ===
This sub-committee was in charge of organizing and hosting various social events in order to unite the gay and lesbian community. More importantly, it helped raise money for the GAA from admission fees to the social events.

=== Youth Information Service ===
This sub-committee is just one example of the Gay Activist Alliance&#x27;s commitment to gay and lesbian youth. The Youth Information Service was dedicated to offering representative of the GAA to speak, &quot;on the topic of Gay Liberation for youthful or youth-orientated groups or organizations especially including high schools and colleges.&quot;

<text>John Ferguson Godfrey (December 19, 1942 – December 18, 2023) was a Canadian educator, journalist and politician who served as a member of Parliament from 1993 to 2008.

==Background==
Godfrey was born in Toronto, Ontario on December 19, 1942. His father, Senator John Morrow Godfrey (June 28, 1912 – March 8, 2001), was a Canadian pilot, lawyer and politician. John Godfrey graduated from Upper Canada College in 1960. In 1961, he attended the Neuchâtel Junior College in Neuchâtel, Switzerland.

In 1965, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Trinity College, University of Toronto and in 1967, he received a Master of Philosophy from Balliol College, Oxford and Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) from St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford in 1975. He worked as an economist, historian and journalist. In the mid-1970s Godfrey was a history professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He served as president of the University of King&#x27;s College from 1977 to 1987, and founded the university&#x27;s prestigious Bachelor of Journalism program. From 1987 to 1991 he was editor of the &quot;Financial Post&quot;.

Godfrey died at his home in Toronto on December 18, 2023, one day before his 81st birthday.

== Politics ==
Godfrey was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as the Liberal member of Parliament for the Toronto area riding of Don Valley West in the 1993 election, and was re-elected in each subsequent vote until his retirement from federal politics in 2008.

During the 1995 Quebec referendum, Godfrey had an acquaintance perform a psychiatric evaluation of separatist leader Lucien Bouchard.

In 1996, he and fellow Liberal MP Peter Milliken introduced the Godfrey–Milliken Bill a parody of the American Helms–Burton Act. The gesture received extensive media coverage including in the United States, where Godfrey was featured on the CBS program &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. From 1996 to 2004, Godfrey served as a parliamentary secretary under Prime Minister Jean Chrétien.

== Minister of State for Infrastructure and Communities ==
In 2003, Paul Martin succeeded Chrétien as Liberal leader and prime minister. Following the subsequent 2004 election, Godfrey, among other key Martin allies, was appointed to the Cabinet in the role of Minister of State for Infrastructure and Communities. In this role, he was primarily responsible for overseeing the &quot;New Deal for Cities&quot;, Federation of Canadian Municipalities relationship, and other initiatives in Canadian federal-municipal relations. This role was considered a keystone of Martin&#x27;s industrial strategy.

== Liberal leadership ==
On February 3, 2006, CBC Newsworld&#x27;s Don Newman announced on air that Godfrey was planning a run for the Liberal Party leadership. Godfrey declared his candidacy on &quot;Goldhawk Live&quot; on March 19, shortly after the rules and convention date were set. Media reaction was positive, but competed with coverage of Ashley MacIsaac, who declared his intention to run to the &quot;Halifax Daily News&quot; the next day.

In the early stages of the campaign he was recurrently cited as exemplar of intellectualism in the race, being one of three former university professors in the running. Name-recognition remained a challenge, but Godfrey received plaudits in the Canadian blogosphere for his performance in the first all-candidates meeting at the Liberal Party of Alberta convention on April 8.

On April 12, 2006, Godfrey announced his withdrawal from the race, due to concerns about his health. On October 20, 2006, Godfrey announced his support for Bob Rae for the federal Liberal leadership. He made the announcement at the National Press Club, on the occasion of a speech by Rae on the environment.

==Leaving politics==
Godfrey announced in November 2007 his intention to resign his parliamentary seat on July 1, 2008 and would leave earlier if an election were called before that date. He later delayed his resignation date until August 1. The Conservative Party alleged that the Liberals chose to delay the by-election for financial reasons though Godfrey&#x27;s office stated that the delay was due to a private members bill Godfrey had worked on not being given Royal Assent until June 26.

On June 17, in a point of order following Question Period, Godfrey gave his resignation speech to the House of Commons.

==Headmaster of the Toronto French School==
John Godfrey left politics to become Headmaster of the Toronto French School, an independent school in the Lawrence Park area with two campuses in Toronto. He held the position from 2008 until resigning in June 2014.

The Government of Ontario appointed John Godfrey Special Advisor for Climate Change and Chair of the Government&#x27;s Climate Action Group in March 2015, positions he held until June 2018.

<doc id="854016" wikidata="Q108524486" url="?curid=854016" title="Imperfect">
<text>The imperfect (abbreviated ) is a verb form that combines past tense (reference to a past time) and imperfective aspect (reference to a continuing or repeated event or state). It can have meanings similar to the English &quot;was walking&quot; or &quot;used to walk&quot;. It contrasts with preterite forms, which refer to a single completed event in the past.

Traditionally, the imperfect of languages such as Latin and French is referred to as one of the tenses, although it actually encodes aspectual information in addition to tense (time reference). It may be more precisely called past imperfective.

English has no general imperfective and expresses it in different ways. The term &quot;imperfect&quot; in English refers to forms much more commonly called &quot;past progressive&quot; or &quot;past continuous&quot; (e.g. &quot;was doing&quot; or &quot;were doing&quot;). These are combinations of past tense with specifically continuous or progressive aspect. In German, formerly referred to the simply conjugated past tense (to contrast with the or compound past form), but the term (preterite) is now preferred, since the form does not carry any implication of imperfective aspect.

&quot;Imperfect&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;unfinished&quot;, because the imperfect expresses an ongoing, uncompleted action. The equivalent Ancient Greek term was &quot;prolonged&quot;.

==Indo-European languages ==

===Germanic languages===

====English====
Imperfect meanings in English are expressed in different ways depending on whether the event is continuous or habitual.

For a continuous action (one that was in progress at a particular time in the past), the past progressive (past continuous) form is used, as in &quot;I &quot;was eating&quot;&quot;; &quot;They &quot;were running&quot; fast.&quot; However certain verbs that express state rather than action do not mark the progressive aspect (see ); in these cases the simple past tense is used instead: &quot;He &quot;was&quot; hungry&quot;; &quot;We &quot;knew&quot; what to do next.&quot;

Habitual (repeated) action in the past can be marked by &quot;used to&quot;, as in &quot;I &quot;used to eat&quot; a lot&quot;, or by the auxiliary verb &quot;would&quot;, as in &quot;Back then, I &quot;would eat&quot; early and &quot;would walk&quot; to school.&quot; (The auxiliary &quot;would&quot; also has other uses, such as expressing conditional mood.) However, in many cases the habitual nature of the action does not need to be explicitly marked on the verb, and the simple past is used: &quot;We always &quot;ate&quot; dinner at six o&#x27;clock.&quot;

===Italic languages===

====Latin====
Conjugation of the imperfect indicative:

Notes:
* The imperfect is signified by the signs &quot;ba&quot; and &quot;ebā&quot;.
* The imperfect forms of &quot;esse&quot; are used as auxiliary verbs in the pluperfect of the passive voice along with perfect passive participles.

=== Romance languages ===
In Romance languages, the imperfect is generally a past tense. Its uses include representing:
* Repetition and continuity: an action that was happening, used to happen, or happened regularly in the past, as it was ongoing
* A description of people, things, or conditions of the past
* A time in the past
* A relation between past happenings: a situation that was in progress in the past or a condition originated in a previous time, when another isolated and important event occurred (the first verb, indicating the status in progress or condition from the past using the imperfect, while the latter uses the preterite).
* A physical or mental state or condition in progress in the past. Often used with verbs of being, emotion, capability, or conscience. 
A common mistake of beginners learning a Romance language is putting too much emphasis on whether the time the action occurred is known. This generally does &quot;not&quot; affect how the imperfect is used. For example, the sentence &quot;&quot;Someone ate all of my cookies.&quot; (when translated) is not a good candidate for the imperfect. Fundamentally, it is no different from the sentence &quot;We ate all the cookies.&quot; Note this fails the &quot;repeatability&quot; requirement of the imperfect, as it is only known to have happened once. On the other hand, the sentence &quot;I used to have fun in the 1960s.&quot;&quot; is a good candidate for the imperfect, even though its period is known. In short, knowing &quot;when&quot; an action occurred is not nearly as important as &quot;how long&quot; it occurred (or was and still is occurring).

==== French ====
To form the imperfect for French regular verbs, take the first person plural present tense, the &quot;nous&quot; (we) form, subtract the &quot;-ons&quot; suffix, and add the appropriate ending (the forms for &quot;être&quot; (to be), whose &quot;nous&quot; form does not end in &quot;-ons&quot;, are irregular; they start with &quot;ét-&quot; but have the same endings). Verbs that terminate in a stem of -cer and -ger undergo minor orthographic changes to preserve the phonetic sound or allophone. Verbs whose root terminates in the letter &quot;i&quot; maintain the letter despite the consecutiveness in the &quot;nous&quot; and &quot;vous&quot; forms.

It is used to express the ideas of habitual actions or states of being; physical and emotional descriptions: time, weather, age, feelings; actions or states of an unspecified duration; background information in conjunction with the passé composé; wishes or suggestions; conditions in &quot;si&quot; clauses; the expressions &quot;être en train de&quot; and &quot;venir de&quot; in the past.
====Italian====
Conjugation of the imperfect indicative:

Notes:
* Dropping the -re suffix and adding -vo, -vi, -va, -vamo, -vate, and -vano form verbs.
*Although &quot;dire&quot; and &quot;opporre&quot; (as all the composite forms of verb &quot;porre&quot; and &quot;dire&quot;) may seem irregular, they are a part of a verb family that has stronger roots to Latin equivalents (lat. &quot;pōnere/pōnēbam&quot; and &quot;dīcere/dīcēbam&quot;). Other verbs include &quot;fare&quot;(infinitive)/&quot;faccio&quot;(present tense)/&quot;facevo&quot;(imperfect) (lat.&quot;facere/facio/faciēbam&quot;), &quot;bere/bevo/bevevo&quot; (&quot;bibere/bibo/bibēbam&quot;), &quot;trarre/traggo/traevo&quot; (&quot;trahere/traho/trahēbam&quot;), &quot;durre/duco/ducevo&quot;[obs.] (&quot;dūcere/dūco/dūcēbam&quot;) and all their composite forms..
* There is another imperfect in Italian formed by combining the imperfect of the verb &quot;stare&quot; (stavo, stavi, stava, stavamo, stavate, stavano) with the gerund. For example, &quot;parlavo&quot; could be said as &quot;stavo parlando&quot;. The difference is similar to the difference between &quot;I eat&quot; and &quot;I am eating&quot; in English. However, English does not make this distinction in the imperfect.

====Romanian====
Conjugation of the imperfect indicative:

Notes:
* The imperfect is formed from the short infinitive form of the verbs (without the -re suffix) combined with the -am, -ai, -a, -am, -ați, and -au endings.
* Short infinitives ending in „-a” (1st conjugation) don&#x27;t double this letter: e.g. &quot;pleca” in the first person singular is &quot;plecam&quot; and not &quot;plecaam&quot;).
* Short infinitives ending in &quot;-i&quot; take the pattern of those ending in &quot;-e&quot; (e.g. &quot;dormi becomes &quot;dormeam&quot; in 1st person imperfect), while short infinitives ending in &quot;-î&quot; take the pattern of those ending in &quot;-a&quot; (e.g. &quot;hotărî becomes &quot;hotăram&quot; in 1st person imperfect).
* There is only one irregular verb in the imperfect: &quot;a fi&quot;, that is created from the radical &quot;era-&quot;, instead of &quot;fi-&quot;.

====Spanish====
In Spanish, the imperfect can be called the &quot;imperfecto&quot; or the &quot;copretérito&quot;. Conjugation of the imperfect indicative:

* There are only three irregular verbs in the imperfect: &quot;ir&quot;, &quot;ser&quot;, and &quot;ver&quot;. Historically, &quot;ir&quot; — unlike other Spanish &quot;&quot;-ir&quot; verbs&quot; — failed to drop the &quot;-b-&quot; of the Latin imperfect. The imperfect of &quot;ser&quot; is likewise a continuation of the Latin imperfect (of &quot;esse&quot;), with the same stem appearing in &quot;tú eres&quot; (thanks to pre-classical Latin rhotacism). The imperfect of &quot;ver&quot; (&quot;veía&quot; etc.) was historically considered regular in Old Spanish, where the infinitive &quot;veer&quot; provided the stem &quot;ve-&quot;, but that is no longer the case in standard Spanish. In formal language, pronouns &quot;tú&quot; and &quot;vosotros&quot; are replaced by &quot;usted&quot; and &quot;ustedes&quot; (sometimes abbreviated as Ud./Vd. and Uds./Vds.), with the verb conjugated in third person. American Spanish always replaces &quot;vosotros&quot; with &quot;ustedes&quot;, switching the verb accordingly. The countries that show the kind of voseo in which &quot;tú&quot; is replaced by &quot;vos&quot; use the same forms as for &quot;tú&quot; in this tense.
* The first person singular and third person singular forms are the same for all verbs; thus, in cases of ambiguity where context is insufficient, a pronoun or subject noun is included for the sake of clarification.

====Portuguese====
In Portuguese, the imperfect indicative, called &quot;pretérito imperfeito&quot;, is quite similar to Spanish: 
There are four irregular verbs: &quot;pôr&quot; (to put), &quot;ser&quot; (to be), &quot;ter&quot; (to have) and &quot;vir&quot; (to come). Unlike in Spanish, the verbs &quot;ver&quot; (to see) and &quot;ir&quot; (to go) are &quot;regular&quot; in the Portuguese imperfect.

Like in Italian, it is also commonly formed by combining the imperfect of the verb estar (estava, estavas, estava, estávamos, estáveis, estavam) with the gerund (for example, &quot;falando&quot;, the gerund form of &quot;falar&quot;, to speak, to talk). In Brazilian Portuguese, both in informal oral speech and informal written language (for example, online or phone texting), it is more common to use the composite &quot;estava falando&quot; (commonly reduced to &quot;tava falando&quot;), than to use the synthetic &quot;falava&quot;, which is more common in formal written forms.

Both in European and Brazilian Portuguese, the synthetic pluperfect (&quot;eu falara&quot; &quot;I had spoken&quot;) is considered old-fashioned and never used in spoken communication – it is substituted by the composite &quot;eu tinha falado&quot;, which is formed with the imperfect form of the verb &quot;ter&quot; (to have) (tinha tinhas tinha tínhamos tínheis tinham) plus the past participle (&quot;falado&quot;). Alternatively, the verb &quot;ter&quot; can be swapped with the imperfect form of the verb &quot;haver&quot; (to have) (havia havias havia haviamos havíeis haviam)

====Galician====

Similar to the closely related Portuguese, as well as to Spanish, but often called &quot;copretérito&quot; (from &quot;co-&quot;, same particle found in English &quot;collaboration&quot; and &quot;coexistence&quot;, plus &quot;pretérito&quot;, which is &quot;past tense&quot;, in reference of it being a second past tense that exists along the regular one). Same as with them, in formal usage &quot;ti&quot; and &quot;vós/vosoutros&quot; change to &quot;vostede&quot; and &quot;vostedes&quot; and are followed by the third person. In verbs ended in &quot;-aer&quot;, &quot;-oer&quot;, &quot;-aír&quot; and &quot;-oír&quot;, the first and second person of the plural show the presence of a diaeresis.

=== Indo-Aryan languages ===

==== Hindi ====
Hindi, an Indo-Aryan language, has indicative imperfect tense conjugation only for the verb होना (&quot;honā&quot;) [to be] and the rest of the verbs lack this conjugation. The indicative imperfect forms of होना &quot;(honā)&quot; comes from Sanskrit स्थित &quot;(stʰita)&quot; &quot;standing, situated&quot; which are derived from the PIE root *steh₂- (“to stand”). The imperfect conjugation is derived from a participle form and hence its conjugations agree only with the number and gender of the grammatical person and not the pronoun itself. So, the grammatically singular pronouns (e.g., मैं &quot;ma͠i&quot; &quot;I&quot; and तू &quot;tū &quot;you&quot;&quot; etc.) are assigned the singular imperfect forms (i.e. था &quot;thā&quot; or थी &quot;thī&quot;) depending on the gender of the person or the noun they refer to, and the grammatically plural pronouns (e.g. हम &quot;ham&quot; &quot;we&quot; etc.) are assigned the plural imperfect forms (थे &quot;thē&quot; and थीं &quot;thīm̊&quot;). An exception to this is the pronoun तुम (&quot;tum&quot;) which takes in the plural imperfect form (थे &quot;thē)&quot; in masculine gender but singular form (थी &quot;thī&quot;) in feminine gender.

These imperfect conjugations also act as copula to form the imperfect past forms for the three grammatical aspects that Hindi hasː Habitual, Perfective, and Progressive aspects.
==== Assamese ====
In Assamese, two imperfect forms are recognisedː present progressive and/or present perfect &amp; past progressive and/or remote past. There is only one periphrastic tense which functions as both the present progressive and present perfect with reference to the setting in which is placed.

=== Indo-Iranian languages ===

====Persian====
Like all other past tenses, imperfect is conjugated regularly for all verbs. Formation: &quot;[preverb] + mi- + past stem + past ending.&quot; Conjugation of the imperfect indicative for the first person singular is shown in the table belowː

===Slavic languages===
Most Slavic languages have lost the imperfect but it is preserved in Bulgarian and Macedonian. It is also officially retained in Serbian and Croatian but is considered old-fashioned and restricted to literature for poetic and stylistic reasons.

==Turkish==
Turkish has separate tenses for past continuous and imperfect.
To form the past continuous tense for Turkish verbs, after removing the infinitive suffix (-mek or -mak), take the present continuous tense suffix &quot;-yor&quot; without personal suffixes, and add the ending for the simple past plus the appropriate personal suffix
* As &quot;-du&quot; (which has a rounded back vowel) succeeds &quot;-lar&quot; (which has an unrounded back vowel), instead of &quot;-yor&quot; (which has a rounded back vowel) when the subject is the third person plural &quot;onlar&quot;, it becomes &quot;-dı&quot; (which has an unrounded back vowel).
* If a verb ends in &quot;t&quot;, it may change into &quot;d&quot; (especially &quot;gitmek&quot; and &quot;etmek&quot;).
* If a verb ends in open vowels (&quot;a&quot; or &quot;e&quot;), the open vowels become closed while adding &quot;-yor&quot; (because of the closed auxiliary vowel &quot;-i-&quot;).
*: &quot;a&quot; becomes &quot;ı&quot; if the preceding vowel is unrounded, &quot;u&quot; if it is rounded (ağla -&gt; ağlıyor, topla -&gt; topluyor)
*: &quot;e&quot; becomes &quot;i&quot; if the preceding vowel is unrounded, &quot;ü&quot; if it is rounded (bekle -&gt; bekliyor, söyle -&gt; söylüyor)
* If the verb ends in a consonant, the auxiliary vowel &quot;-i-&quot; must be added before &quot;-yor&quot;. It becomes &quot;-ı-&quot;, &quot;-u-&quot; or &quot;-ü-&quot; depending on the frontness and roundedness of the preceding vowel, because of the vowel harmony:
*: &quot;-i&quot; if the preceding vowel is &quot;e&quot; or &quot;i&quot; (front unrounded): gel -&gt; geliyor
*: &quot;-ı&quot; if the preceding vowel is &quot;a&quot; or &quot;ı&quot; (back unrounded): bak -&gt; bakıyor
*: &quot;-u&quot; if the preceding vowel is &quot;o&quot; or &quot;u&quot; (back rounded): kork -&gt; korkuyor
*: &quot;-ü&quot; if the preceding vowel is &quot;ö&quot; or &quot;ü&quot; (front rounded): gör -&gt; görüyor
* &quot;r&quot; of &quot;-yor&quot; may be dropped in colloquial speech.

To form the negative of the past continuous tense, the negation suffix &quot;-ma/-me&quot;, which becomes &quot;-mi&quot;, &quot;-mı&quot;, &quot;-mu&quot;, or &quot;-mü&quot; because of the closed auxiliary vowel and the vowel harmony, must be added before &quot;-yor&quot;.

Examples:
* The epenthetic consonant &quot;y&quot; is inserted between &quot;-mu&quot; and &quot;-du&quot;.
* As &quot;-mu&quot; and &quot;-du&quot; (which have a rounded back vowel) succeeds &quot;-lar&quot; (which has an unrounded back vowel) instead of &quot;-yor&quot; (which has a rounded back vowel) when the subject is the third person plural, &quot;onlar&quot;, they become &quot;-mı&quot; and &quot;-dı&quot; (which have an unrounded back vowel).

==Semitic languages ==
Semitic languages, especially the ancient forms, do not make use of the imperfect (or perfect) tense with verbs. Instead, they use the imperfective and perfective aspects, respectively. Aspects are similar to tenses, but differ by requiring contextual comprehension to know whether the verb indicates a completed or non-completed action.

==Dravidian languages ==

===Malayalam===
In Malayalam (verbs are never conjugated for grammatical person, which is indicated by a pronoun), there are two indicative imperfects, corresponding exactly with English:
:1 -ഉകയായിരുന്നു (ukayāyirunnu) endings (&quot;... was...&quot;), for example:
::ഓടുകയായിരുന്നു (ōṭukayāyirunnu) &quot;... was running&quot;
:2 -ഉമായിരുന്നു (umāyirunnu) endings (&quot;... used to ...&quot;), for example:
::ഓടുമായിരുന്നു (ōṭumāyirunnu) &quot;... used to run&quot;
*To form the &quot;was doing&quot; imperfect, take the infinitive ending in ഉക (uka), for example ഓടുക (ōṭuka) – to run – and add the ending – യായിരുന്നു (yāyirunnu).
*To form the &quot;used to do&quot; imperfect, take off the ക (ka) from the end of the &quot;uka&quot; form and add മായിരുന്നു (māyirunnu) in its stead.

To make a verb in the imperfect negative, add അല്ല് (all) after the ഉകയ (ukaya) part of the ending for the &quot;was doing&quot; imperfect. For example, ഓടുകയല്ലായിരുന്നു (ōṭukayallāyirunnu) (&quot;...was not running&quot;). To do the same for the &quot;used to do&quot; imperfect, take off the ഉമ (uma) from the ending and add അത്തില്ല (attilla) instead. For example, ഓടത്തില്ലായിരുന്നു (ōṭattillāyirunnu) (&quot;...didn&#x27;t use to run&quot;)

<text>The Knap of Howar () on the island of Papa Westray in Orkney, Scotland is a Neolithic farmstead which may be the oldest preserved stone house in northern Europe. Radiocarbon dating shows that it was occupied from 3700 BC to 2800 BC, earlier than the similar houses in the settlement at Skara Brae on the Orkney Mainland.

==The site==
The farmstead consists of two adjacent rounded rectangular thick-walled stone buildings with very low doorways facing the sea. The larger and older structure is linked by a low passageway to the other building, which has been interpreted as a workshop or a second house. They were constructed on an earlier midden, and were surrounded by midden material which has protected them. There are no windows; the structures were presumably lit by fire, with a hole in the roof to let out smoke. Though they now stand close to the shore, they would have originally lain inland.

The stone walls of the buildings are preserved and while the roof is missing, it was likely made of wood and thatched or turfed. A hearth and a stone-built cupboard survive inside, and there may have been an external porch. Local stone splits into thin slabs, offering a ready source of construction material.

The walls still stand to an eaves height of , and the stone furniture is intact giving a vivid impression of life in the house. Fireplaces, partition screens, beds and storage shelves are almost intact, and post holes were found indicating the roof structure.

Evidence from the middens shows that the inhabitants were keeping cattle, sheep and pigs, cultivating barley and wheat and gathering shellfish as well as fishing for species which must have been line caught using boats.

Finds of finely-made and decorated Unstan ware pottery link the inhabitants to chambered cairn tombs nearby and to sites far afield including Balbridie and Eilean Domhnuill.
The name Howar is believed to be derived from Old Norse word &quot;haugr&quot; meaning mounds or barrows. The site is in the care of Historic Scotland.

The island is also home to the arrival of the world&#x27;s shortest flight.

<doc id="854022" wikidata="Q1708162" url="?curid=854022" title="Joseph W. Barr">
<text>Joseph Walker Barr (January 17, 1918 – February 23, 1996) was an American businessman and politician from Indiana. He served one term in the United States House of Representatives. He was also the United States Secretary of the Treasury from December 21, 1968 until January 20, 1969, in President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s cabinet. He was a member of the Democratic Party.

== Early life and career ==
Barr was born in Vincennes, Indiana, on January 17, 1918, the son of Oscar Lynn Barr and Stella Florence Walker. He graduated from DePauw University, and married the former Beth Ann Williston in Indianapolis on September 3, 1939; they had five children: Bonnie Barr Gilliom, Cherry Ann Barr, Joseph Williston Barr, Elizabeth Eugenia Barr LoSasso and Lynn Hamilton Barr Fineberg. He was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and earned a master&#x27;s degree in economics from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1941.

He served in the United States Navy from 1942 to 1945, during World War II, with subchaser duty in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. He received a Bronze Star for sinking a submarine off Anzio Beach.

After Barr returned from the war, he engaged in the operation of grain elevators, theaters, real estate and publishing businesses.

== Political career ==
In 1958, he defeated Charles B. Brownson for a seat in Congress from Indiana&#x27;s 11th congressional district, a Republican stronghold. He was aided by Democratic gains that increased the party&#x27;s majority from 35 to 129 seats. During his time in the House, he became friends with then-Senator John F. Kennedy. He served only one term before being defeated for re-election in 1960.

After his electoral defeat, President Kennedy appointed him as the Assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury for Congressional Relations. In 1963, he was appointed Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Barr served as the Undersecretary of the Treasury from 1965 to 1968, during the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson. When Henry H. Fowler resigned in December 1968, Johnson named Barr as the Secretary of the Treasury with a recess appointment, effective for the remainder of Johnson&#x27;s term in office. His 28 days in the position was the shortest term of any Treasury Secretary. Given his short period in office, his signature appears only on the one-dollar bill.

== Later years ==
After leaving office, he was named as the vice chairman of American Security and Trust Company. He then served as the president and the chairman from 1969 to 1974 and the chairman of Federal Home Loan Bank in Atlanta, Georgia from 1977 to 1981.

Barr died of a heart attack in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, and was interred in Leeds Episcopal Church Cemetery in Hume, Virginia.

<doc id="854027" wikidata="Q1424306" url="?curid=854027" title="Perfective aspect">
<text>The perfective aspect (abbreviated ), sometimes called the [[aorist]]ic aspect, is a grammatical aspect that describes an action viewed as a simple whole, i.e., a unit without interior composition. The perfective aspect is distinguished from the imperfective aspect, which presents an event as having internal structure (such as ongoing, continuous, or habitual actions). The term &quot;perfective&quot; should be distinguished from &quot;perfect&quot; (see below).

The distinction between perfective and imperfective is more important in some languages than others. In Slavic languages, it is central to the verb system. In other languages such as German, the same form such as (&quot;I went&quot;, &quot;I was going&quot;) can be used perfectively or imperfectively without grammatical distinction. In other languages such as Latin, the distinction between perfective and imperfective is made only in the past tense (e.g., Latin &quot;I came&quot; vs. &quot;I was coming&quot;, &quot;I used to come&quot;). However, perfective should not be confused with tense—perfective aspect can apply to events in the past, present, or future.

The perfective is often thought of as for events of short duration (e.g., &quot;John killed the wasp&quot;). However, this is not necessarily true—a perfective verb is equally right for a long-lasting event, provided that it is a complete whole; e.g., (Livy) &quot;Tarquin the Proud reigned for 25 years.&quot; It simply &quot;presents an occurrence in summary, viewed as a whole from the outside, without regard for the internal make-up of the occurrence.&quot;

The perfective is also sometimes described as referring to a &quot;completed&quot; action, but it would be more accurate to say that it refers to an action or situation that is seen as a complete whole; e.g., the Russian perfective future &quot;I shall kill you&quot; refers to an event that has not yet been completed.

The essence of the perfective is an event seen as a whole. However, most languages that have a perfective use it for various similar semantic roles—such as momentary events and the onsets or completions of events, all of which are single points in time and thus have no internal structure. Other languages instead have separate momentane, inchoative, or cessative aspects for those roles, with or without a general perfective.

==Equivalents in English==
English has neither a simple perfective nor imperfective aspect; see imperfective for some basic English equivalents of this distinction. 

When translating into English from a language that has these aspects, the translator sometimes uses separate English verbs. For example, in Spanish, the imperfective can be translated &quot;I knew&quot; vs. the perfective &quot;I found out&quot;, &quot;I was able to&quot; vs. &quot;I succeeded&quot;, &quot;I wanted to&quot; vs. &quot;I tried to&quot;, &quot;I did not want to&quot; vs. &quot;I refused&quot;. The Polish perfective aspect is translated into English as a simple tense and the imperfective as a continuous; for example the imperfective is translated into &quot;I was watching&quot;, while the perfective is translated into &quot;I watched&quot;. Such distinctions are often language-specific.

== Marking ==

Languages may mark perfective aspect with morphology, syntactic construction, lexemes/particles, or other means.
* Older Germanic languages: the aspect prefixes (in Old English), (in Old Saxon and Old High German), and (in Gothic) indicate perfective aspects of verbs.
* Thai: the aspect marker , grammaticalized from the word for &quot;ascend,&quot; indicates a certain type of underconstrained perfective aspect when it follows a main verb
*Hindi: the perfective aspect is marked using the perfective aspect participle. The perfective participle is constructed as shown in the table below, the consonant () is added to the perfective suffix when the verb root ends in a vowel.

==Perfective vs. perfect==
The terms &quot;perfective&quot; and &quot;perfect&quot; should not be confused.

A &quot;perfect&quot; tense (abbreviated &#x27; or &#x27;) is a grammatical form used to describe a past event with present relevance, or a present state resulting from a past situation. For example, &quot;I have put it on the table&quot; implies both that I put the object on the table and that it is still there; &quot;I have been to France&quot; conveys that this is a part of my experience as of now; and &quot;I have lost my wallet&quot; implies that this loss is troublesome at the present moment. A perfect tense does not necessarily have to be perfective in aspect. For example, &quot;I have been waiting here for an hour&quot; and &quot;I have been going to that doctor all my life&quot; are perfect but also imperfective in aspect. 

There are some languages, however, such as Modern Greek, in which the perfect tense is always perfective.

== Examples ==

=== Hindustani ===

Hindustani (aka Hindi-Urdu) has 3 grammatical aspects: &quot;Habitual&quot;, &quot;Perfective&quot; and &quot;Progressive&quot;. Each aspect is constructed from its participle and a number of auxiliary verbs can be used with the aspectual participles such as: (to be, to happen), (to stay, to remain), (to go), (to come), and (to do). These verbs themselves can be made into aspectual participles and can be used with the default auxiliary verb (to be), hence forming sub-aspects that combine the nuance of two aspects. The auxiliary (to stay) gives a nuance of continuity of the perfective state, (to go) is used to construct the passive voice (in its habitual subaspect) and also shows that the action is completed (in its perfective subaspect), (to do) gives the nuance that the perfective action is repeated habitually.
: 

Conjugating the auxiliary verbs which are in the infinitive form above into their aspectual forms using the auxiliary (to be) gives the following subaspectual forms of the perfective aspect in their infinitive form:

<doc id="854028" wikidata="Q371427" url="?curid=854028" title="Imperfective aspect">
<text>The imperfective (abbreviated or more ambiguously ) is a grammatical aspect used to describe ongoing, habitual, repeated, or similar semantic roles, whether that situation occurs in the past, present, or future. Although many languages have a general imperfective, others have distinct aspects for one or more of its various roles, such as progressive, habitual, and iterative aspects. The imperfective contrasts with the perfective aspect, which is used to describe actions viewed as a complete whole.

==English==

English is an example of a language with no general imperfective. The English progressive is used to describe ongoing events, but can still be used in past tense, such as &quot;The rain was beating down&quot;. Habitual situations do not have their own verb form (in most dialects), but the construction &quot;used to&quot; conveys past habitual action, as in &quot;I used to ski&quot;. Unlike in languages with a general imperfective, in English the simple past tense can be used for situations presented as ongoing, such as &quot;The rain beat down continuously through the night&quot;.

A contrast between the progressive and imperfective is seen with stative verbs. In English, stative verbs, such as &quot;know&quot;, do not use the progressive (&quot;*I was knowing French&quot; is ungrammatical), while in languages with an imperfective (for instance, French), stative verbs frequently appear in the imperfective.

African American Vernacular English does have an imperfective aspect for present tense formed by adding &quot;be&quot; before the present continuous of a verb, such as &quot;he be working&quot;, or &quot;they be eating&quot;.

== Indo-Aryan languages ==
Verbs in Hindi-Urdu (Hindustani) have their grammatical aspects overtly marked. Periphrastic Hindi-Urdu verb forms (participle verb forms) consist of two elements, the first of these two elements is the aspect marker and the second element (the copula) is the common tense-mood marker. There are two independent imperfective aspects in Hindi-Urdu: &quot;Habitual Aspect&quot;, and &quot;Progressive Aspect.&quot; These two aspects are formed from their participle forms being used with the copula verb of Hindi which is होना honā (to be). However, the aspectual participles can also have the verbs रहना rêhnā (to stay/remain), आना ānā (to come) &amp; जाना jānā (to go) as their copula. The table below shows three verbs होना honā (to be), करना karnā (to do), and मरना marnā (to die) in their aspectual infintive forms using different copulas.

Now, these copula verbs (besides होना honā) can themselves be converted into their participle forms and put into one of the three different aspects of Hindi-Urdu, which are &quot;habitual&quot;, &quot;progressive&quot;, and &quot;perfective&quot; aspects, hence generating sub-aspectual infinitive forms. This way a verb form combining two grammatical aspects is constructed. The table below shows the combined aspectual forms:

==Slavic languages==
Verbs in Slavic languages have a perfective and/or an imperfective form. Generally, any of various prefixes can turn imperfectives into perfectives;
suffixes can turn perfectives into imperfectives.
The non-past imperfective form is used for the present, while its perfective counterpart is used for the future. There is also a periphrastic imperfective future construction.

== Other languages ==
The imperfective aspect may be fused with the past tense, for a form traditionally called the imperfect. In some cases, such as Spanish and Portuguese, this is because the imperfective aspect occurs only in the past tense; others, such as Georgian and Bulgarian, have both general imperfectives and imperfects. Other languages with distinct past imperfectives include Latin and Persian.

==Perfective==

The opposite aspect is the &quot;perfective&quot; (in Ancient Greek, generally called the &quot;aorist&quot;), which views a situation as a simple whole, &quot;without&quot; interior composition. (This is not the same as the &quot;perfect&quot;.) Unlike most other tense–aspect category oppositions, it is typical for a language not to choose either perfective or imperfective as being generally marked and the other as being generally unmarked.

In narrative, one of the uses of the imperfective is to set the background scene (&quot;It was midnight. The room was dark. The rain was beating down. Water was streaming in through a broken window. A gun lay on the table.&quot;), with the perfective describing foregrounded actions within that scene (&quot;Suddenly, a man burst into the room, ran over to the table, and grabbed the gun.&quot;).

English does not have these aspects. However, the background-action contrast provides a decent approximation in English:
:&quot;John was reading when I entered.&quot;
Here &#x27;entered&#x27; presents &quot;the totality of the situation referred to [...]: the whole of the situation is presented as a single unanalysable whole, with beginning, middle, and end all rolled into one; no attempt is made to divide this situation up into the various individual phases that make up the action of entry.&quot; This is the essence of the perfective aspect: an event presented as an unanalyzed whole.

&#x27;Was reading&#x27;, however, is different. Besides being the background to &#x27;entered&#x27;, the form &#x27;reading&#x27; presents &quot;an internal portion of John&#x27;s reading, [with] no explicit reference to the beginning or to the end of his reading.&quot; This is the essence of the imperfective aspect. Or, to continue the quotation, &quot;the perfective looks at the situation from the outside, without necessarily distinguishing any of the internal structure of the situation, whereas the imperfective looks at the situation from inside, and as such is crucially concerned with the internal structure of the situation, since it can both look backwards towards the start of the situation, and look forwards to the end of the situation, and indeed it is equally appropriate if the situation is one that lasts through all time, without any beginning and without any end.&quot;

This is why, within the past tense, perfective verbs are typically translated into English as simple past, like &#x27;entered&#x27;, whereas imperfective verbs are typically translated as &#x27;was reading&#x27;, &#x27;used to read&#x27;, and the like. (In English, it is easiest to illustrate aspect in the past tense. However, any tense is possible: Present &quot;John is reading as I enter&quot;, future &quot;John will be reading when I enter&quot;, etc.: In each tense, the aspectual distinction is the same.)

This aspectual distinction is not inherent to the events themselves, but is decided by how the speaker views them or wishes to present them. The very same event may be described as perfective in one clause, and then imperfective in the next. For example,
:&quot;John read that book yesterday; while he was reading it, the postman came,&quot;
where the two forms of &#x27;to read&#x27; refer to the same thing. In &#x27;John read that book yesterday&#x27;, however, &quot;John&#x27;s reading is presented as a complete event, without further subdivision into successive temporal phases;&quot; while in &#x27;while he was reading it&#x27;, &quot;this event is opened up, so that the speaker is now in the middle of the situation of John&#x27;s reading,&quot; as it is in the middle of this reading that the postman arrives.

The perfective and imperfective need not occur together in the same utterance; indeed they more often do not. However, it is difficult to describe them in English without an explicit contrast like &quot;John was reading when I entered.&quot;

===Combination===

The two aspects may be combined on the same verb in a few languages, for perfective imperfectives and imperfective perfectives. Georgian and Bulgarian, for example, have parallel perfective-imperfective and aorist-imperfect forms, the latter restricted to the past tense. In Bulgarian, there are parallel perfective and imperfective stems; aorist and imperfect suffixes are typically added to the perfective and imperfective stems, respectively, but the opposite can occur. For example, an imperfect perfective is used in Bulgarian for a simple action that is repeated or habitual:
Here each sitting is an unanalyzed whole, a simple event, so the perfective root of the verb &#x27;sat&#x27; is used. However, the clause as a whole describes an ongoing event conceived of as having internal structure, so the imperfective suffix &quot;-eshe&quot; is added. Without the suffix, the clause would read simply as &quot;In the evening he sat on the veranda.&quot;

<text>E (Е е; italics: &quot;Е&quot; &quot;е&quot;), known in Russian and Belarusian as Ye, Je, or Ie, is a letter of the Cyrillic script. In some languages this letter is called E. It commonly represents the vowel or , like the pronunciation of in &quot;yes&quot;. It was derived from the Greek letter epsilon (Ε ε), and the shape is very similar to the Latin letter E or another version of E (Cyrillic).

Ye is romanized using the Latin letter E for Bulgarian, Serbian, Macedonian, Ukrainian and Rusyn, and occasionally Russian (Озеро Байкал, Ozero Baykal), Je for Belarusian (Заслаўе, Zaslaŭje), Ye for Russian (Европа, Yevropa), and Ie occasionally for Russian (Днепр, Dniepr) and Belarusian (Маладзе́чна, Maladziečna).

==Usage==

===Russian and Belarusian===
*At the beginning of a word or after a vowel, Ye represents the phonemic combination (phonetically or ), like the pronunciation of in &quot;yes&quot;. Ukrainian uses the letter (see Ukrainian Ye) in this way.
*Following a consonant, Ye indicates that the consonant is palatalized, and represents the vowel (phonetically or ), like the pronunciation of in &quot;yes&quot;.

In Russian, the letter can follow unpalatalized consonants, especially , , and . In some loanwords, other consonants before (especially , , , , , and ) are also not palatalized, see E (Cyrillic). The letter also represents (as in &quot;yogurt&quot;) and after palatalized consonants, , and . In these cases, may be used, see Yo (Cyrillic). In unstressed syllables, represents reduced vowels like , see Russian phonology and Vowel reduction in Russian.

===Bulgarian, Serbian, Macedonian, Ukrainian and Rusyn===
This letter is called E, and represents the vowel phoneme (phonetically or ), like the pronunciation of in the word &quot;set&quot;.

=== Mongolian ===
The letter represents the sound at the beginning of words (yo represents ), and also represents at the beginning of some words and in the middle or end of words and in Russian loanwords and transcriptions of foreign names.

===Turkic languages and Tajik===
In Turkic languages utilizing the Cyrillic script (such as Kazakh, Kyrgyz and Uzbek) and in Tajik, Ye is used to represent the phoneme ~, both word-finally and medially. Isolated, word-initially, or vowel-succeeding, this letter is substituted with the letter Э. If the letter Ye occurs word-initially, isolated, or vowel-succeeding, it represents the phoneme /je/~/jɛ/. This is done in imitation of the Russian usage, as many of these languages received Cyrillic orthographies as part of Russification in the Soviet Union.

<text>Ze (З з; italics: &quot;З&quot; &quot;з&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script.

It commonly represents the voiced alveolar fricative , like the pronunciation of in &quot;zebra&quot;.

Ze is romanized using the Latin letter .

The shape of Ze is very similar to the Arabic numeral three , and should not be confused with the Cyrillic letter E .

==History and shape==

Ze is derived from the Greek letter Zeta (Ζ ζ).

In the Early Cyrillic alphabet its name was (&quot;zemlja&quot;), meaning &quot;earth&quot;. The shape of the letter originally looked similar to a Greek letter Ζ or Latin letter Z with a tail on the bottom (). Though a majuscule form of this variant () is encoded in Unicode, historically it was only used as caseless or lowercase.

In the Cyrillic numeral system, Zemlja had a value of 7.

Medieval Cyrillic manuscripts and Church Slavonic printed books have two variant forms of the letter Zemlja: з and . Only the form was used in the oldest ustav (uncial) writing style; з appeared in the later poluustav (half-uncial) manuscripts and typescripts, where the two variants are found at proportions of about 1:1. Some early grammars tried to give a phonetic distinction to these forms (like palatalized vs. nonpalatalized sound), but the system had no further development. Ukrainian scribes and typographers began to regularly use З/з in an initial position, and otherwise (a system in use till the end of the 19th century). Russian scribes and typographers largely abandoned the widespread use of the variant in favor of з in the wake of Patriarch Nikon&#x27;s reforms. They still used the older form mostly in the case of two З&#x27;s in row: (the system in use till the mid-18th century).

The civil (Petrine) script knows only one shape of the letter: З/з. This shape is therefore confusing with the number 3, given that the two shapes are very similar to it. However, shapes similar to Z/z can be used in certain stylish typefaces.

In calligraphy and in general handwritten text, lowercase з can be written either fully over the baseline (similar to the printed form) or with the lower half under the baseline and with the loop (for the Russian language, a standard shape since the middle of the 20th century).

==Phonetic value==
The letter Ze may represent:
* , the voiced alveolar sibilant (Macedonian, Bulgarian, Bosnian, Serbian, Montenegrin, Russian, Ukrainian, Rusyn and Belarusian);
* , if followed by or any of the palatalizing vowels, as in Russian зеркало (&quot;mirror&quot;);
* , the voiceless alveolar sibilant (in final position or before voiceless consonants);
* , if followed by in final position or before voiceless consonants;
* or (Iron dialect of Ossetian, but in Digoron and Kudairag);
* clusters and are pronounced in Russian as if they were and , respectively (even if is the last letter of a preposition, like in Russian без жены &quot;without wife&quot; or из школы &quot;from school&quot;);
* cluster (sometimes also ) is pronounced in Russian as if it was (рассказчик &quot;narrator&quot;, звёздчатый &quot;stellar, star-shaped&quot;, без чая &quot;without tea&quot;);
* cluster can be pronounced (mostly in Ukrainian, Rusyn and Belarusian) as the voiced alveolar affricate (Ukrainian дзеркало &quot;mirror&quot;) or its palatalized form (Belarusian гадзіннік &quot;clock&quot;), but if and belong to different morphemes, then they are pronounced separately. In the standard Iron dialect of Ossetian, this cluster simply stands for ; other dialects treat it as the affricate .
* , the voiceless alveolar affricate in Mongolian, similar to German &quot;z&quot;.

==З-shaped Latin letters==

===Zhuang===
A letter that looks like Cyrillic Ze (actually, a stylization of digit 3) was used in the Latin Zhuang alphabet from 1957 to 1986 to represent the third (high) tone. In 1986, it was replaced by .

<text>Short I or Yot/Jot (Й й; italics: &quot;Й й&quot; or Й й; italics: &quot;Й й&quot;) (sometimes called I Kratkoye, , Ukrainian: йот) or I with breve, Russian: и с бреве) is a letter of the Cyrillic script. It is made of the Cyrillic letter И with a breve.

The short I represents the palatal approximant , like the pronunciation of in &quot;yesterday&quot;.

Depending on the romanization system in use and the Slavic language that is under examination, it can be romanized as , , or . For more details, see romanization of Russian, romanization of Ukrainian, romanization of Belarusian and romanization of Bulgarian.

==History==
Active use of (or, rather, the breve over ) began around the 15th and 16th centuries. Since the middle of the 17th century, the differentiation between and is obligatory in the Russian variant of Church Slavonic orthography (used for the Russian language as well). During the alphabet reforms of Peter I, all diacritic marks were removed from the Russian writing system, but shortly after his death, in 1735, the distinction between and was restored. was not officially considered a separate letter of the alphabet until the 1930s.

Because was considered to be a vowel and not a consonant, it was not required to take a hard sign when it came at the end of a word in pre-reform orthography.

==Usage==
In Russian, it appears predominantly in diphthongs like in широкий (&quot;shirokiy&quot; &#x27;wide&#x27;), in край (&quot;kray&quot; &#x27;end&#x27;, &#x27;krai&#x27;), in долей (&quot;doley&quot; &#x27;portion&#x27;), in горой (&quot;goroy&quot; &#x27;mountain&#x27;), and in буйство (&quot;buystvo&quot; &#x27;rage&#x27;). It is used in other positions only in foreign words, such as Йopк (York, not with), including fellow Slavic words like Йовович (Yovovich).

In Kazakh, the letter is used to represent a short ɪ sound (e.g. берейік (tr. (Let us) give)). The letter, much like the other 11 Cyrillic letters, does not have another Latin version and merges with Ии (İi).

In Serbo-Croatian and Macedonian, the Cyrillic letter Јe is used to represent the same sound. Latin-based Slavonic writing systems, such as Polish, Czech and the Latin version of Serbo-Croatian use the Latin letter J (not the letter Y, as in English), for that purpose.

<text>The Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro, or Palazzo Santa Sofia, is a palace on the Grand Canal in Venice, northern Italy. Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro or Cadoro translates to &quot;House of Gold&quot; or &quot;Golden House&quot; in English because of the gilt and polychrome external decorations that once adorned its walls. It was designed by Marino Contarini and later restored by Baron Giorgio Franchetti. In 1927, the building was converted into a museum and since then has been known as the Galleria Giorgio Franchetti alla Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro.

The Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro has long been regarded as the best-surviving palazzo in Venetian Gothic architecture, retaining all the most characteristic features, despite some losses. On the facade, the loggia-like window group of closely spaced small columns, with heavy tracery and quatrefoil openings above, use the formula from the Doge&#x27;s Palace that had become iconic. There is also Byzantine-inspired decoration along the roofline and patterning in fancy colored stone to the flat wall surfaces. The smaller windows show a variety of forms with an ogee arch capped with a relief ornament.

The third act of Amilcare Ponchielli&#x27;s opera, &quot;La Gioconda,&quot; is set in the palace.

During the 2019 Venice flood, water levels reached the top of the wellhead in the inner courtyard.

Francis H. Kimball, the famed American architect behind landmarks like the Empire State Building, used the Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro as inspiration for the Montauk Club, a social club in Brooklyn, New York.

==Patron and commission==

The patron of the building was Marino Contarini of the Contarini, well-respected noble Venetian family who had served Venice over the year with the election of eight different Doges between 1043 and 1676. Marino Contarini used the building of the Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro, as a way to assert his family&#x27;s place in Venetian society and express their wealth and status. This message was also conveyed as the palace was built not far from the Rialto Bridge on the left bank of Grand Canal of Venice, which was and remains the main thoroughfare in Venice. The architects of the Ca d&#x27;Oro were Giovanni Bon and his son Bartolomeo Bon.

The Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro was built between 1421 and 1437 for Marino Contarini upon the foundations of a building that he had received through his marriage to Soradamore Zeno, which had been part of an old palace belonging to the Zeno family. As the patron of the new palace, Contarini was in essence the building&#x27;s main designer, as he was the one who oversaw the entire project. He also kept notes and accounts of the whole process, which have survived throughout the centuries, offering scholars amazing insight into the building&#x27;s construction.

=== Architects ===
He contracted two main architects to execute his plan for the palace: the Venetian architect and sculptor (along with his son Bartolomeo Bon), and another architect-sculptor, Matteo Raverti, who came from Milan. Matteo Raverti&#x27;s notable contributions to the Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro include the tracery of the main loggia and the ogee-arched tympanum over the land entrance. Giovanni Bon and Bartolomeo Bon are also known for their contribution to the main ceremonial door of the Doge&#x27;s Palace, the so-called Porta della Carta, but was called Porta Aurea because of how much gold they had added. Matteo Raverti was also known for his work as a sculptor for the Milan Cathedral.

==Description and layout==
One of the Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro&#x27;s distinguishing features is its asymmetrical facade, designed to maximize light in rooms where side windows were impractical due to the proximity of neighboring buildings.

The building&#x27;s atrium (&quot;androne&quot;)—a large open hall located near the waterfront—is accessed directly from the canal through the multi-arched loggia. The atrium was historically used for receiving and exporting shipments, reflecting the common practice among noble Venetian families who derived their wealth from trade.

Above the atrium is the &quot;gran salone&quot; or main reception hall, that occupies the &quot;piano nobile&quot; (noble floor) and is fronted by the most ornate of the three loggias, featuring intricate Gothic quatrefoil tracery attributed to Matteo Raverti.

The upper stories housed private living quarters for the family. The layout prioritizes privacy and hierarchy, with the family’s private spaces were elevated above the more public reception and trading areas.

The palace has (like other similar buildings in Venice) a small inner courtyard. The neighboring palace is the Palazzo Giustinian Pesaro. The central courtyard is accessible from the gondola landing and provides light and ventilation to the interior spaces. The courtyard contains a central wellhead. Additionally, a small garden area within the courtyard adds to the palace&#x27;s aesthetic and functional appeal.
== Architectural features of the main façade ==
Marino Contarini had the building constructed in the style of Byzantine architecture, mixed with the popular Gothic style of this time, as well as elements of Islamic design. Having for centuries been part of the Byzantine Empire, Venice turned to its Byzantine history, which spanned from the classical period to the more recent medieval era, while Florence, Siena, and Milan called more upon their Greco-Roman traditions.

The facade is divided into three distinct stories: a lower loggia (covered corridor), a middle balcony, and an upper balcony. Other nearby buildings in this style are Palazzo Barbaro and the Palazzo Giustinian. This linear style favoured by the Venetian architects was not superseded by Venetian Renaissance architecture until the end of the 15th century, or later.

The arches, windows, and loggia of the palace provide a variety of decorations that make it one of the most striking palazzo in Venice. Vertical emphasis is created by each level of the façade becoming more ornate as it reaches the top while horizontal emphasis is created by the balustrades on the balconies and the large cornice at the roofline.

Long rows of arches and windows face the canal that provide an abundance of natural lighting in the interior. The lower loggia contains a muti-arched entrance made up of pointed arches that opens up into the canal with a gondola landing. The lower loggia&#x27;s muti-arched entrance is made up of a central wide arch and a narrower arch flanking each side. The landing leads into a courtyard with a wellhead, stairwell, and a small garden.

On the ground floor, a recessed colonnaded loggia gives access to the entrance hall (&quot;portego de mezo&quot;) directly from the canal. Above this colonnade is the enclosed balcony of the principal salon on the &quot;piano nobile&quot;. The columns and arches of this balcony have capitals which in turn support a row of quatrefoil windows; above this balcony is another enclosed balcony or loggia of a similar yet lighter design.

The scalloped cusping of the pointed arches allows for a contrapuntal effect, while the window&#x27;s tracery patterns on the right side of the palace reflect Gothic elements. The uppermost level contains a row of pinnacles, which are an extension of the quatrefoil patterns below. Made for purely an aesthetic purpose, the balls on each lobe of the pinnacle were covered with golden leaves.

The palazzo got its name from the façade&#x27;s original use of white and pale red stone with golden gilded accents. Gold was added to the building with Contarini&#x27;s painter Zoane di Franza in 1431. To enhance the aesthetic appeal, the façade was crafted with stone from Istria that was treated with white lead and oil to create a marble-like sheen, while red Verona marble details were oiled to bring out their rich tonalities. Architectural elements such as the parapet balls, window finials, capitals, and moldings were all gilded, adding to the luxurious appearance. This combination of practical design and opulent decoration underscores the dual purpose of the Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro as both a functional space and a display of wealth and status. Over time, sun exposure dulled the white and pale red stone has worn away and the facade&#x27;s gilded elements are no longer evident. In fact, by 1600, no more gold decoration remained on the exterior, but with the palace&#x27;s golden façade was already sp well-known that it retained the title of Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro.

== Restoration ==
The restoration of the Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro was led by Baron Giorgio Franchetti until his death on December 17, 1923. Franchetti was greatly attuned to detail and wanted to duplicate the technique of the previous accomplished architects. This led him to entrust with assisting with this restoration, and Forlati was the one to assume leadership of the project after Franchetti&#x27;s death. Forlati&#x27;s assistant, Antonio Nardo, was also entrusted with this task by Franchetti, who requested that Nardo be recognized with the title of Conservator of the Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro.

During his time working on the restoration of the building, Giorgio Franchetti was able to restore parts removed under the ownership of Marie Taglioni. These pieces notably included the red Verona marble well-head that was sculpted by Bartolomeo Bon. Franchetti also took it upon himself to compose the mosaic pavement in the entrance hall that was made out of Grecian marble and red marble from Verona. Along with these features, he also had the walls individually and uniquely carved. Although the ground floor was originally used for utilitarian function, Franchetti had marble facing added that concealed this role. Along with his project of restorating of the Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro, Baron Giorgio Franchetti donated the building to the public in 1916 and it was converted into a museum (see Provenance section below).

== Provenance ==
Following the fall of the Venetian Republic in 1797, the palace changed ownership several times. In 1846, Alessandro Trubetzkoi purchased the palace, which was in a ruinous state. Trubetzkoi gifted the palace to ballet dancer Marie Taglioni, who sold notable architectural features from the building.

Franchetti would also restore the palace after the reckless renovation of the architect, Trubetzkoi, which resulted in his imprisonment under charges of vandalism. In the end, many of the Gothic features, including the stairway of the inner courtyard and the balconies which overlooked the courtyard, were removed.

In 1894, the palace was acquired by its last owner, baron Giorgio Franchetti. Some of the architectural elements that had been sold by Marie Taglioni were recovered by Franchetti, such as the red Verona marble wellhead by Bartolomeo Bon. 

Throughout his lifetime, he amassed an important art collection and personally oversaw its extensive restoration, including the reconstruction of the stairway and the Cosmatesque courtyard with ancient marble. In 1916, Franchetti bequeathed the Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro to the Italian State. It is now open to the public as a gallery: Galleria Giorgio Franchetti alla Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro.

== Museum ==
The gallery houses the collection of works of art collected by Giorgio Franchetti in his life. Following the donation to the Italian State in 1916 and in preparation for the museum, the Franchetti collection was accompanied by some state collections from which most of the bronzes and sculptures on display come from, as well as numerous Venetian and Flemish paintings.

Among the most valuable works are the San Sebastiano by Andrea Mantegna and the Portrait of Marcello Durazzo by Antoon van Dyck.

In addition to the exhibition rooms, the museum houses various laboratories for the conservation and restoration of works of art.

<text>Ka (К к; italics: &quot;К к&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script.

It commonly represents the voiceless velar plosive /k/, like the pronunciation of ⟨k⟩ in &quot;king&quot; or &quot;kick&quot;.

==History==
The Cyrillic letter Ka was derived from the Greek letter Kappa (Κ κ).

In the Early Cyrillic alphabet its name was (&quot;kako&quot;), meaning &quot;as&quot;.

In the Cyrillic numeral system, Ka had a value of 20.

==Form==
The Cyrillic letter Ka looks very similar, and corresponds to the Latin letter K. In many fonts, Cyrillic Ka is differentiated from its Latin and Greek counterparts by drawing one or both of its diagonal spurs with curved instead of straight. Also in some fonts the lowercase form of Ka has the vertical bar elongated above x-height, resembling the Latin lowercase k.

==Usage==
In Russian, the letter Ka represents the plain voiceless velar plosive or the palatalized one ; for example, the word &quot;&quot; (&quot;short&quot;) contains both the kinds: . The palatalized variant is pronounced when the following letter in the word is &quot;ь&quot;, &quot;е&quot;, &quot;ё&quot;, &quot;и&quot;, &quot;ю&quot;, or &quot;я&quot;.
In Macedonian and Serbian, it always represents the sound .

<text>Yu or Ju (Ю ю; italics: &quot;Ю ю&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script used in East Slavic and Bulgarian alphabets.

In English, Yu is commonly romanized as or . In turn, is used, where available, in transcriptions of English letter (in open syllables), and also of the digraph. The sound , like in French and in German, may also be approximated by the letter .

==Pronunciation==
Sometimes, it is referred to as &quot;Iotated U&quot; because it is a so-called iotated vowel, pronounced in isolation as , like the pronunciation of in &quot;human&quot;. After a consonant, no distinct sound is pronounced, but the consonant is softened. The exact pronunciation of the vowel sound of in Russian depends also on the succeeding sound because of allophony. Before a soft consonant, it is , the close central rounded vowel, as in &#x27;rude&#x27;. Before a hard consonant or at the end of a word, the result is a back vowel , as in &quot;pool&quot;.

==History==
Apart from the form &quot;I-O&quot;, in early Slavonic manuscripts the letter appears also in a mirrored form &quot;O-I&quot; (). It is the latter form that is probably the original, precisely displaying the Greek combination omicron-iota (οι). At the time that the Greek alphabet was adapted to the Slavonic language giving rise to the Cyrillic alphabet, it denoted the close front rounded vowel in educated Greek speech. The close &quot;front&quot; rounded vowel does not appear in East Slavic. See above.

There was another way for it to lead to the modern form. By the analogy to several &#x27;iotated&#x27; letters Ѥ, Ꙗ, Ѩ and Ѭ, the ancient ligature (or letter) Uk / possibly had its iotated form /.

The iotated big Yus  merged itself to in East Slavic languages.

<doc id="854039" wikidata="Q211827" url="?curid=854039" title="Peter I of Serbia">
<text>Peter I (;  – 16 August 1921) was King of Serbia from 15 June 1903 to 1 December 1918. On 1 December 1918, he became King of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and he held that title until his death three years later. Since he was the king of Serbia during a period of great Serbian military success, he was remembered by Serbians as King Peter the Liberator and also as the Old King.

Peter was the fifth child and third son of Alexander Karađorđević, Prince of Serbia, and his wife, Persida Nenadović. Prince Alexander was forced to abdicate in 1858, and Peter lived with his family in exile. He fought with the French Foreign Legion in the Franco-Prussian War. He joined as a volunteer under the alias Peter Mrkonjić () in the Herzegovina uprising (1875–1877) against the Ottoman Empire. In 1883, Prince Peter married Princess Ljubica, daughter of King Nicholas I of Montenegro. Ljubica became known as Princess Zorka upon her marriage. Peter and Zorka had five children: Helen, Milena, George, Alexander, and Andrew. After his father died in 1885, Peter became head of the Karađorđević dynasty.

After King Alexander I Obrenović was murdered during the May Coup of 1903, Peter Karađorđević became the new king of Serbia. As king, he advocated a constitutional setup for the country and was famous for his liberal politics. Peter&#x27;s rule was marked with the great exercise of political liberties, freedom of the press, national, economical and cultural rise, and it is sometimes dubbed a &quot;golden&quot; or &quot;Periclean age&quot;. Peter was the supreme commander of the Royal Serbian Army in the Balkan Wars. On 24 June 1914, the aging king proclaimed his son and heir Alexander as regent. In World War I, the King and his army retreated across the Principality of Albania. Peter died in 1921 aged 77.

==Early life==
Peter was born in Belgrade on . He was the fifth of ten children born to Prince Alexander Karađorđević and his consort, Persida Nenadović. He was the grandson of Karađorđe, the leader of the First Serbian Uprising (1804–1813) and the founder of the Karađorđević dynasty. Peter was not born in the Royal Court, which was undergoing renovations at the time, but at the home of merchant Miša Anastasijević, whose daughter Sara (1836–1931) was later married to Peter&#x27;s first cousin Prince George Karađorđević (1827–1884). His birth was not met with much celebration because he was his parents&#x27; third son and his older brother Svetozar was the heir to the throne.

His parents&#x27; oldest son, Aleksa, had died three years prior to Peter&#x27;s birth, aged five, at which point Svetozar became heir. Peter did not become heir until Svetozar&#x27;s death in 1847 at the age of six. Besides Belgrade, Peter spent much of his childhood in the town of Topola, from where the Karađorđević dynasty originated. He received his elementary education in Belgrade.

==Exile==

===Post-secondary education and Franco-Prussian War===

In 1858, just as the fourteen-year-old Peter was preparing to depart for Geneva to attend high school, his father was forced to abdicate the throne. The Karađorđević dynasty&#x27;s rivals, the Obrenović dynasty, were reinstated, and an Obrenović prince, Mihailo, claimed the throne. The two dynasties had been vying for power since 1817, when Karađorđe was assassinated on the orders of Miloš Obrenović, the founder of the Obrenović dynasty.

Peter left Geneva for Paris in 1861 and enrolled in the Collège Sainte-Barbe, located in the heart of the city&#x27;s Latin Quarter. The following year, Peter enrolled in the &quot;Saint-Cyr&quot;, France&#x27;s most prestigious military academy. He graduated from the academy in 1864, and continued living in Paris for some time thereafter. During this period, he pursued interests such as photography and painting, and read works of political philosophy, learning about liberalism, parliamentarism and democracy. In 1866, he entered the Higher Military School in Metz, which he attended until the following year. Two years later, his Serbian-language translation of John Stuart Mill&#x27;s &quot;On Liberty&quot; was published.

At the outbreak of the 1870–71 Franco-Prussian War, Peter joined the French Foreign Legion under the pseudonym Petar Kara, together with relative Nikola Nikolajević. During his service, Peter held the rank of either lieutenant or second lieutenant, depending on the source, and fought with the 1st Foreign Regiment. He participated in the Second Battle of Orléans on 3–4 December 1870, as well as the Battle of Villersexel on 9 January 1871. He was awarded the Legion of Honour for his conduct during the two battles, but was captured by the Prussians shortly thereafter. He managed to escape captivity and returned to the front. Peter was involved in the Paris Commune in the spring of 1871, together with close friend and relative Vladimir Ljotić, though the exact nature of his involvement remains unknown.

===Guerrilla activities===

With the outbreak of the Great Eastern Crisis of 1875–78, which erupted after Bosnian Serb rebels in Nevesinje staged a revolt against the Ottoman Empire, Peter returned to the Balkans and fought the Ottomans in northwestern Bosnia. He adopted the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; of Petar Mrkonjić, and upon reaching the regions of Banija and Kordun in Austria-Hungary, took control of a guerrilla unit of about 200 men.

He arrived at Bosanska Dubica in August 1875, but received a cold welcome. He discovered that Prince Milan of Serbia was plotting to assassinate him fearing that Peter would attempt to wrest back the throne from the Obrenović dynasty. This revelation, combined with a string of battlefield defeats, compelled Peter and his followers to leave Bosnia and withdraw to Austria-Hungary.

They were subsequently detained by the Austro-Hungarian Army in the village of Bojna, near Glina. Peter escaped, returned to Bosnia and organized another band of rebels. Once again, his involvement in the fighting aroused suspicion in Belgrade, and by May 1876 his presence proved divisive. The rebels split into three separate camps: one that supported Peter, another that supported Milan and a third that advocated Austro-Hungarian arbitration. Not wishing to cause further divisions among the rebels, Peter agreed to leave Bosnia. Prior to his departure, he wrote a letter to Milan explaining why he was leaving the battlefield and offering to make peace with the Obrenović dynasty.

Despite his attempts to make peace with Milan, accusations of treason continued to be levelled against Peter. He decided to travel to Kragujevac, the seat of the Royal Serbian Government, and address the National Assembly in an attempt to clear his name. In 1877, an anti-government uprising erupted in the Toplica region of southern Serbia, for which Milan blamed Peter and Karađorđević sympathizers. Peter was accused of treachery and collaboration with the Ottomans.

In the summer of 1878, he illegally crossed the border between Serbia and Austria-Hungary at Golubac via the Danube. Peter and his guide became lost in the Homolje mountains and were forced to hide from the authorities in the wilderness. Peter returned to Austria-Hungary shortly thereafter, but was arrested by the Austro-Hungarian police and interned at the Karađorđević family home in Bokszeg. In 1878, he was allowed to leave Bokszeg. He first went to Budapest and then to Paris. During this period, he was closely monitored by Austro-Hungarian spies, who took note of all his movements.

In January 1879, court proceedings were initiated against Peter and his closest companions in Smederevo. The plaintiff, Prince Milan, alleged that Peter and his followers had attempted to overthrow the Obrenović dynasty and place a Karađorđević on the throne. Peter and his companions were charged with high treason, for which the mandatory penalty was death. As he was living in Paris at the time of the proceedings, Peter was convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; and sentenced to death by hanging.

===Move to Cetinje===

During his exile, Peter proposed himself as a suitor to Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen, niece of Wilhelm II, who was thirty-six years his junior, though this was likely a bid to gain support of the Kaiser for succeeding to the Serbian throne. Her mother, Princess Charlotte of Prussia declared that &quot;for such a throne Feodora is far too good&quot;. After this failed attempt, Peter moved to Cetinje in 1883, the capital of the second independent Serb state, Montenegro, with the intention of marrying the eldest daughter of Montenegro&#x27;s ruler, Prince Nicholas I. Peter and Princess Ljubica of Montenegro were married in Cetinje in the summer of 1883. The marriage upset the region&#x27;s volatile geopolitical balance, causing great unease in the Austro-Hungarian, Russian and Serbian capitals. Belgrade perceived it as a sign of increasing closeness between the Petrović-Njegoš and Karađorđević dynasties. Relations between the two Serb states worsened, as did relations between Austria-Hungary and Russia, which had been vying for power in the Balkans for decades.

When his father died in the spring of 1885, Peter became the head of the House of Karađorđević. Serbia, previously a principality, was declared a kingdom in 1882, and henceforth, the Serbian monarch used the title King of Serbia. Ljubica died during childbirth in March 1890. The couple had five children, three of whom reached adulthood: Helen (Jelena), Milena, George (Đorđe), Alexander (Aleksandar), and Andrew (Andrej). Milena died in infancy and Andrew died along with his mother during childbirth.

Following his father&#x27;s death, Peter&#x27;s financial situation deteriorated and he became dependent on his father-in-law, as well as Russia and his brother George, for support. Following the Royal Serbian Army&#x27;s rout in the Serbo-Bulgarian War of 1885, Peter and Nicholas devised a plan to invade Serbia and overthrow the Obrenović dynasty. At the last minute, Nicholas abandoned the idea. Peter felt betrayed by the Prince&#x27;s decision to back out, leading to long lasting animosity. Nevertheless, he remained in Cetinje until 1894, devoting himself to his surviving children, who finished their primary education there.

In 1894, Peter moved to Geneva with his three children, where he was to remain until 1903. In 1899, Tsar Nicholas II invited Prince George and Prince Alexander, as well as Peter&#x27;s nephew Paul, to attend the &quot;Corps des Pages&quot; military academy in Saint Petersburg free of charge. Due to his precarious financial situation, which prevented him from sending the boys to private schools in Switzerland, Peter accepted the Tsar&#x27;s offer.

===May Coup===
In July 1900, King Alexander, Milan&#x27;s 23-year-old son, married Draga Mašin, a widowed lady-in-waiting twelve years his senior with a reputation for promiscuity. Mašin was also believed to be infertile, raising questions as to the viability of the Obrenović line. The marriage sparked outrage among the officer corps and led to a plot to remove Alexander from the throne. The officers, led by Dragutin Dimitrijević (&quot;Apis&quot;), initially sought to expel Alexander and Draga but realized that doing so would precipitate a conflict between the pro-Karađorđević and pro-Obrenović camps within the country.

By the autumn of 1901, the conspirators resolved to kill the King and Queen, thereby averting a possible civil war. Some officers proposed placing an English or German prince on the throne. Another suggested Prince Mirko, the second son of Nicholas of Montenegro, and others advocated forming a republic. Political conditions in Europe were such that the proclamation of a republic would only have increased the ire of the Great Powers towards Serbia in case Alexander was overthrown, giving Austria-Hungary a pretext to invade.

Preparations for the coup took place between 1901 and 1903. The conspirators decided to place Peter on the throne in November 1901, but Peter had little trust in them and their initial offers were rebuffed. He accepted their offers on the condition that officers he trusted would take part in the plot and insisted that he would not take any part himself. He also told the officers that he would agree to take the throne only if his ascent was approved by the National Assembly.

At the time of the coup, Peter was vacationing with his children and planning visits to Russia and Romania, suggesting that he was not aware of what was to occur. The officers raided the royal palace late in the evening of and shot the King and Queen, mutilating their corpses with sabres and tossing them from a third-floor balcony. The murders resulted in the extinction of the Obrenović line and resolved the century-long feud between the Karađorđević and Obrenović dynasties.

Peter expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the plot, as well as regret for the bloodshed that had occurred, describing it as &quot;neither gentlemanly, nor worthy of the 20th century&quot;. On , by decision of the National Assembly, Peter was summoned to assume the Serbian throne. He arrived in Belgrade on .

Peter&#x27;s ascent to the throne was met with great enthusiasm by South Slav nationalists, who believed he would succeed in uniting the South Slavs living in Serbia, Montenegro, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. In Vienna, en route to Belgrade, he was welcomed by a crowd of euphoric Serb and Croat students, who hailed him as &quot;the first Yugoslav king&quot;.

==Reign==
=== Accession ===
The royal couple&#x27;s murder upset and shocked most of Europe, but many Serbs reacted enthusiastically. Russia immediately recognized the National Assembly&#x27;s decision declaring Peter the next King of Serbia and expressed satisfaction that the inter-dynastic intrigues which had plagued the country since the early-19th century had been brought to an end. Austria-Hungary declared its neutrality on the matter, but privately, policymakers in Vienna expressed hope that Peter&#x27;s accession would have a placating effect.

The United Kingdom demanded that the chief conspirators be severely punished, and when the Royal Serbian Government neglected to carry out this request, the British severed all diplomatic ties. Several other European nations followed in the United Kingdom&#x27;s footsteps and severed ties as well. Peter lacked the power or authority to punish the conspirators. He also felt a deep sense of obligation towards them, acknowledging that he would not have been able to assume the throne were it not for their actions.

===Coronation===
 Peter was crowned in St. Michael&#x27;s Cathedral in Belgrade, on . The coronation ceremony, the first in Serbia&#x27;s modern history, aimed to demonstrate that a new era had begun. The year-long interval between Peter&#x27;s return to Serbia and his coronation deliberately made the ceremony coincide with the 100th anniversary of the First Serbian Uprising with the hope of giving European statesmen time to come to terms with the palace coup. Nevertheless, only representatives of Montenegro and Bulgaria attended.

New royal regalia, consisting of a crown, sceptre, orb and royal mantle, were commissioned specially for the occasion from the Parisian jewelers &quot;Falize Frères&quot;. Arnold Muir Wilson, the honorary Serbian consul in Sheffield, and his cameraman, Frank Mottershaw, filmed King Peter&#x27;s procession and a parade following the coronation. This is the oldest surviving film recorded in Belgrade. According to film historian Paul Smith, it is also likely the first newsreel in history.

===Foreign affairs===
During the reign of Peter I the Kingdom of Serbia expanded to the south, incorporating much of Sandžak and Kosovo and Metohija in 1912 in the First Balkan War. Serbia temporarily controlled northern parts of Albania, but had to give away those parts to Albania in 1912-1913. In November 1918, shortly before the founding of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in December 1918, Serbia acquired some new territories like Srem, Banat, Bačka and Montenegro and which later became part of the new kingdom.

The most prominent prime minister during the reign of Peter I was Nikola Pašić. At the beginning of Peter&#x27;s reign Pašić opposed the new king, calling his accession to the throne unlawful. However, he quickly changed his mind after seeing that the Serbian people accepted King Peter. As it turned out, the only conflict he had with Peter during the 18-year reign concerned the king&#x27;s salary.

Peter I of Serbia saw Imperial Russia as Serbia&#x27;s main ally. Russia opposed the previous politics of the Obrenović dynasty which heavily relied on Austria-Hungary, which the Serbian public detested.

====First Balkan War====

The First Balkan War began in October 1912 and ended in May 1913. It involved military actions of the Balkan League (Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece and Montenegro) against the Ottoman Empire. The combined armies of the Balkan states overcame the numerically inferior and strategically disadvantaged Ottoman armies and achieved rapid success. As a result of the war, the allies captured and partitioned almost all remaining European territories of the Ottoman Empire.
In May 1912 the Albanian Hamidian revolutionaries, who wanted to re-install Sultan Abdul Hamit II to power, drove the Young Turkish forces out of Skopje and pressed south towards Manastir (present day Bitola), forcing the Young Turks to grant effective autonomy over large regions in June 1912. Serbia, which had helped arm the Albanian Catholic and Hamidian rebels and had sent secret agents to some of the prominent leaders, took the revolt as a pretext for war. Serbia, Montenegro, Greece, and Bulgaria had all been in talks about possible offensives against the Ottoman Empire before the Albanian revolt of 1912 broke out; a formal agreement between Serbia and Montenegro had been signed on 7 March.

On 18 October 1912, Peter I of Serbia issued a declaration, &quot;To the Serbian People&quot;, which appeared to support Albanians as well as Serbs:

:&quot;The Turkish governments showed no interest in their duties towards their citizens and turned a deaf ear to all complaints and suggestions. Things got so far out of hand that no one was satisfied with the situation in Turkey in Europe. It became unbearable for the Serbs, the Greeks and for the Albanians, too. By the grace of God, I have therefore ordered my brave army to join in the Holy War to free our brethren and to ensure a better future. In Old Serbia, my army will meet not only upon Christian Serbs, but also upon Muslim Serbs, who are equally dear to us, and in addition to them, upon Christian and Muslim Albanians with whom our people have shared joy and sorrow for thirteen centuries now. To all of them we bring freedom, brotherhood and equality.&quot;

In a search for allies, Serbia negotiated a contract with Bulgaria. The agreement provided that, in the event of victory against the Ottomans, Bulgaria would receive all of Macedonia south of the Kriva Palanka-Ohrid line. Bulgaria accepted Serbian expansion to the north of the Shar Mountains (i.e., Kosovo). The intervening area was agreed to be &quot;disputed&quot;; it would be arbitrated by the Emperor of Russia in the event of a successful war against the Ottoman Empire. During the course of the war, it became apparent that the Albanians did not consider Serbia as a liberator, as suggested by King Peter I, nor did the Serbian forces observe his declaration of amity toward Albanians.

Peter I led the Serbian army alongside marshals like Radomir Putnik, Stepa Stepanović, Božidar Janković and Petar Bojović. Serbia sent 230,000 soldiers (out of the population of just 2,912,000 people) with about 228 guns, grouped in 10 infantry divisions.

====Second Balkan War and aftermath====
Dissatisfied with its share of the spoils of the First Balkan War, Bulgaria attacked its former allies, Serbia and Greece, and started the Second Balkan War on 16 (O.S.)/29 June 1913. Serbian and Greek armies repulsed the Bulgarian offensive and counter-attacked, entering Bulgaria. With Bulgaria also having engaged in territorial disputes with Romania, this war provoked Romanian intervention against Bulgaria. The Ottoman Empire took advantage of the situation to regain some territories lost as a result of the previous war.

When Romanian troops approached the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, Bulgaria asked for an armistice, resulting in the 1913 Treaty of Bucharest, in which Bulgaria had to cede portions of its First Balkan War gains to Serbia, Greece and Romania. The Second Balkan War left Serbia as the most militarily powerful state south of the Danube. Years of military investment financed by French loans had borne fruit. Central Vardar and the eastern half of the Sanjak of Novi Pazar were acquired. Its territory grew in extent from 18,650 to 33,891 square miles and its population grew by more than one and a half million.
Because of his constant and intense efforts in the Balkan Wars, Peter&#x27;s health worsened. At the same time, the Black Hand represented a core of military opposition to the National Assembly. Acting from within the government and the military, members of the Black Hand forced Peter to disband the government of Nikola Pašić, even though the Radical Party held most of the seats in the National Assembly. Only after Russian intervention and with the help of the French capital, was the crisis solved in Pašić&#x27;s favor. King Peter had to withdraw, allegedly because of his failing health, and, on 24 June 1914, he passed his royal powers and duties to his heir-apparent, Alexander.

===Politics===
The Western-educated King Peter attempted to liberalize Serbia with the goal of creating a Western-style constitutional monarchy. Peter I became gradually very popular for his commitment to parliamentary democracy that, in spite of certain influence of military cliques in political life, functioned properly. The 1903 Constitution was a revised version of the 1888 Constitution, based on the Belgian Constitution of 1831, considered one of the most liberal in Europe. The governments were chosen from the parliamentary majority, mostly from the People&#x27;s Radical Party led by Nikola Pašić and from the Independent Radical Party led by Ljubomir Stojanović.

King Peter himself favored the idea of a broader coalition government that would boost Serbian democracy and help pursue an independent course in foreign policy. In contrast to the Austrophile Obrenović dynasty, King Peter I relied on Russia and France, which provoked rising hostility from expansionist-minded Austria-Hungary. King Peter I paid two solemn visits to Saint-Petersburg and Paris in 1910 and 1911 respectively, to be greeted as a hero both of democracy and of national independence in the troublesome Balkans.

The reign of Peter I, from 1903 to 1914, is remembered as the &quot;Golden Age of Serbia&quot;, due to the unrestricted political freedoms, free press, and cultural ascendancy among South Slavs who finally saw in democratic Serbia a Piedmont of South Slavs. King Peter I was supportive to the movement of Yugoslav unification, hosting in Belgrade various cultural gatherings. The Grand School of Belgrade was upgraded into Belgrade University in 1905, with scholars of international renown such as Jovan Cvijić, Mihailo Petrović, Slobodan Jovanović, Jovan M. Žujović, Bogdan Popović, Jovan Skerlić, Sima Lozanić, Branislav Petronijević and several others.

King Peter I gained enormous popularity following the Balkan Wars in 1912 and 1913, which, from a Serb and South Slav perspective, proved greatly successful, heralded by the spectacular military victories over the Ottomans, followed by the liberation of &quot;Old Serbia&quot; (Kosovo Vilayet) and Macedonia (Manastir Vilayet).

The territory of Serbia doubled and her prestige among South Slavs (Croats and Slovenes in particular, and among the Serbs in Austria-Hungary, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Vojvodina, the Military Frontier, Dalmatia, Slavonia, etc.) grew significantly, with Peter I as the main symbol of both political and cultural success. After the conflict between military and civilian representatives in the spring of 1914, King Peter chose to &quot;retire&quot; due to ill health, reassigning on 11/24 June 1914 his royal prerogatives to his second son heir apparent Crown Prince Alexander.
=== World War I and its aftermath ===
The retired King, spending most of his time in various Serbian spas, remained relatively inactive during the First World War, although occasionally, when the military situation became critical, he visited trenches on the front-line to check up on morale of his troops. His visit to the firing line prior to the Battle of Kolubara in late 1914 boosted the morale of the retreating Serbian forces and announced a counter-offensive, sparking victory against numerically superior Austro-Hungarian forces (December 1914). Another memorable visit in 1915 involved King Peter, by then 71, picking up a rifle and shooting at enemy soldiers. Following the invasion of Serbia by the joint forces of Germany, Austro-Hungary and Bulgaria in October 1915, King Peter I led the army and tens of thousands of civilian refugees through the high mountains of Albania to the Adriatic sea on a &quot;Calvary known to few peoples&quot;.

After the dramatic retreat in a harsh winter through the hostile environment of the Albanian highlands from Prizren to the Albanian littoral, a march that took more than 100,000 lives, the King and his army, exhausted by cold and famine, were eventually transported by the Allies to the Greek isle of Corfu in early 1916. For the rest of World War I King Peter I, already in very poor health, remained on Corfu, which became the seat of the Serbian government-in-exile until December 1918.

On 1 December 1918 King Peter I was proclaimed King of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. King Peter stayed abroad until July 1919, then returned to Belgrade, where he died in 1921 at the age of 77. He was solemnly buried in his endowment in Oplenac, the Church of Saint George in the vicinity of Topola in Central Serbia, where his grandfather Karađorđe, the founder of the dynasty, had launched a large-scale insurrection against the Ottomans in 1804.

==Legacy==


Three cities in interwar Yugoslavia were named after King Peter I: Mrkonjić Grad in Bosnia-Herzegovina (former Varcar Vakuf), Petrovgrad in Vojvodina (Veliki Bečkerek, now Zrenjanin) and Petrovac na Moru (former Kaštel Lastva) in Montenegro. Dozens of monuments erected in his honor throughout Yugoslavia were destroyed after the communist takeover in 1945. Only one monument, in Zrenjanin (former Petrovgrad) was recently restored, as well as several smaller monuments in Belgrade and the rest of Serbia. The other monuments in honor to King Peter I were restored or erected in Republika Srpska, in Bosnia and Herzegovina where his cult status as a national hero is as strong as it is in Serbia.

In Paris, an avenue off the Champs-Élysées is named after him, Avenue Pierre 1er de Serbie. There is a modest monument dedicated to King Peter I of Serbia in Orléans, France, when he fought as a volunteer in the French army. A large monument to King Peter and his son Alexander I of Yugoslavia was also unveiled in 1936, at the Porte de la Muette in Paris. The film &quot;King Petar of Serbia&quot; was released in early December 2018 starring Lazar Ristovski as King Peter.

<text>Jan Kott (October 27, 1914 – December 22, 2001) was a Polish political activist, critic and theoretician of the theatre. A leading proponent of Stalinism in Poland for nearly a decade after the Soviet takeover, Kott renounced his Communist Party membership in 1957 following the anti-Stalinist Polish October of 1956. He defected to the United States in 1965. He is regarded as having considerable influence upon Western productions of Shakespeare in the second half of the 20th century.

==Life==
Born in Warsaw in 1914 to a Jewish family, Kott was baptized into the Catholic Church at the age of five. He became a communist in the 1930s, and took part in the defense of Warsaw. 
In June 1939 he married Lidia Steinhaus, the daughter of the mathematician and educator Hugo Steinhaus.

In September 1939, Kott fought in the Polish army in its futile campaign against the German invasion and then, after a period in Lvov, returned to Nazi-occupied Warsaw. After World War II he became known initially as the editor-in-chief of the literary magazine &quot;Kuźnica&quot; and as Poland&#x27;s leading theorist of Socialist realism. In 1949, as the communist authorities tightened their control over all aspects of life, Kott obtained a position as a professor in Wrocław and moved away from political life. He praised Joseph Stalin, but mostly concentrated on theater. In 1951, during the darkest period of Soviet terror, Kott published an ideological manifesto about the role of theater, entitled &quot;O teatr godny naszej epoki&quot; (For theater worthy of our times), in which he demanded a &quot;new&quot; theater subservient to the Party and its ideology. Historian Teresa Wilniewczyc noted, that his zeal for totalitarian control over the world of Polish culture was &quot;far more than was required&quot;. Only after the Stalin era came to an end, did he become its ardent critic (March 1956). He renounced his membership of the communist party in 1957. In 1964 he was one of the signatories of the so-called Letter of 34 to Prime Minister Józef Cyrankiewicz regarding freedom of culture.

===Later career===
Kott traveled to the United States in 1965 on a scholarship from the Ford Foundation. He lectured at Yale and Berkeley, but spent the years 1969 to 1983 teaching at Stony Brook University until he retired. The Polish authorities refused to extend his passport after three years, at which point he decided to defect. As a result, he was stripped of his professorship at Warsaw University. A poet, translator, and literary critic, he became one of the more prolific essayists of the Polish school in America. He died in Santa Monica, California after a heart attack in 2001.

As a theatrical reviewer, Kott received praise for his readings of the classics, and above all of Shakespeare. In his influential volume &quot;Shakespeare, Our Contemporary&quot; (1964), he interpreted the plays in the light of philosophical and existential experiences of the 20th century, augmented with his own life&#x27;s story. This autobiographical accent became a hallmark of his criticism, as exemplified in his collection of essays on theater, &quot;The Gender of Rosalind&quot;. Kott sought to juxtapose Shakespeare with Eugène Ionesco and Samuel Beckett, but his greatest insight came from the juxtaposition of Shakespeare with his own life. He took a similar approach to his reading of Greek tragedy in &quot;The Eating of the Gods&quot;. Reportedly, Peter Brook&#x27;s film &quot;King Lear&quot; and Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; (both made in 1971) were influenced by Kott&#x27;s view of Shakespearean high tragedy in relation to the 20th-century &quot;nightmare of history&quot;. Another Kott collection of essays, &quot;The Memory of the Body: Essays on Theatre and Death&quot;, extended his influence beyond theater in the English-speaking world.

Kott wrote many books and articles published in American journals such as &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;Partisan Review&quot; and &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. Aside from Shakespeare and Greek tragedy, he also wrote about theatre of Japan, Tadeusz Kantor and Jerzy Grotowski. He translated works by Jean-Paul Sartre, Denis Diderot, Eugène Ionesco and Molière into Polish and English.

<text>De-Lovely is a 2004 American musical biopic directed by Irwin Winkler and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures. The screenplay by Jay Cocks is based on the life and career of Cole Porter, from his first meeting with his wife, Linda Lee Thomas, until his death. It is the second biopic about the composer, following 1946&#x27;s &quot;Night and Day&quot;.

==Plot==
As he is about to die, Porter&#x27;s life flashes before him in the form of a musical production staged by the archangel Gabriel in the Indiana theater where the composer first performed on stage.

He recalls the night he met his wife, Linda Lee Thomas, a recent divorcee and stunning beauty. From the start, they click and become a devoted couple. Linda is well aware that Cole is gay. Her first husband was abusive to her, but, as she confesses to him on their wedding day, Cole is completely different. Because he loves her and is publicly affectionate, Linda tolerates his extramarital dalliances. During their marriage, Cole&#x27;s career flourishes. Linda begins the tradition of presenting Cole with a custom designed and engraved Cartier cigarette case at the opening of each new show.

To cheer Linda after she experiences a miscarriage, the couple move to Hollywood. After an initial period of excitement, Cole&#x27;s flings become too overt and indiscreet and they create tension. Cole is photographed in an amorous embrace with another man in the restroom of a gay nightclub. Both he and Linda are blackmailed into paying a large sum to suppress publication of the pictures. When he shrugs off the blackmail, she goes to Paris, leaving him bereft.

It is not until Cole is seriously injured in a horse riding accident that Linda returns to his side, willing to forgive, but still finding difficulty in coping with his extramarital affairs. She is eventually diagnosed with emphysema, and in an attempt to provide Cole with a new partner once she is gone, she introduces him to her decorator and estate advisor. The match is successful.

When Linda dies in 1954, Cole is devastated. He continues working until 1958 when degeneration of his right leg finally requires amputation, affecting his creative output. He never writes again, but does participate in productions of his earlier works. Cole dies in 1964 at age 73.

==Production==
Although Porter was a passable singer at best, director Irwin Winkler cast Kevin Kline, winner of two Tony Awards and two Drama Desk Awards for his musical performances on Broadway, as the composer. He stayed in character by limiting his vocal range. Most of his singing was recorded live on the set, and the actor played the piano himself in the scenes where Porter plays.

According to Winkler&#x27;s commentary on the DVD release of the film, he had considered numerous actresses for the role of Linda when Ashley Judd&#x27;s agent advised him she was interested in the part. Winkler was certain her salary demand would exceed that allowed by the budget, but the actress was so anxious to portray Linda she was willing to lower her usual asking price. Judd is twenty years younger than Kline, although the composer&#x27;s wife was eight years older than he.

Filming locations included Chiswick House and Luton Hoo.

The film premiered at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. It was shown at the CineVegas International Film Festival, the Sydney Film Festival, and the San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival before going into limited release in the US.

==Reception==
The film grossed $13,337,299 in the US and $5,059,083 in other markets for a total worldwide box office of $18,396,382.

Critically, the film had a mixed reception. 

Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 out of a possible four stars. He wrote, for his review in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, that &quot;De-Lovely&quot; &quot;...brings [...] a worldly sophistication that is rare in the movies&quot;.

Larry King said: &quot;Far and away the best musical biography ever made.&quot;

In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden called the film &quot;lethally inert&quot; and &quot;lifeless and drained of genuine joie de vivre&quot; and added, &quot;It didn&#x27;t have to be like this. In their highly stylized ways, &quot;All That Jazz&quot; (Bob Fosse&#x27;s morbidly manic screen autobiography), Ken Russell&#x27;s surreal portraits of composers or any of Federico Fellini&#x27;s libidinous self-explorations have delved deeply into the muck of artistic creativity. Sadly, the daring and imagination required to go below the surface are nowhere to be found in &quot;De-Lovely&quot;.&quot;

Ruthe Stein of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; said, &quot;The movie never gels – despite Kline&#x27;s nuanced performance, the stars&#x27; exquisite period clothes designed by Armani, and, of course, Porter&#x27;s great songs. Director Irwin Winkler&#x27;s highly stylized technique is difficult to connect with emotionally. His film also suffers from shockingly sloppy editing for a studio production. If nothing else, the composer . . . deserves a movie that has rhythm. But &quot;De- Lovely&quot; lurches along like a car with a missing spark plug.&quot;

In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Peter Travers rated the film three out of a possible four stars and commented, &quot;In voice, manner, patrician charm and private torment, Kevin Kline is perfection as legendary composer Cole Porter . . . At its best, &quot;De-Lovely&quot; evokes a time, a place and a sound with stylish wit and sophistication.&quot;

Steve Persall of the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; graded the film C− and observed, &quot;The movie is actually an ugly compilation of clashing cinematic styles occasionally salvaged by musical numbers that essentially are part of the problem. You can&#x27;t make a good movie about a 1930s composer using a 1970s film conceit while hiring 21st century recording artists to perform Porter&#x27;s classic songs. A tribute CD, maybe, but not a movie . . . [it] plays like a cabaret review rather than a motion picture, a sublime collection of songs linked by scripted banter barely scratching the surface of its subject. Not delightful, not delicious, just disappointing.&quot;

&quot;Billboard&quot; reported that the film &quot;has inspired a Cole Porter renaissance on Top Jazz albums&quot;. By the end of July 2004, the film&#x27;s soundtrack reached 4–3 on Top Soundtracks and 77–58 on The Billboard 200. The film also boosted chart numbers for the then-recently released compilations albums: &quot;The Very Best of Cole Porter&quot;, &quot;Ultra Lounge: Cocktails With Cole Porter&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s De Lovely - The Authentic Cole Porter Collection&quot;.

<text>Backpacking is the outdoor recreation of carrying gear on one&#x27;s back while hiking for more than a day. It is often an extended journey and may involve camping outdoors. In North America, tenting is common, where simple shelters and mountain huts, widely found in Europe, are rare. In New Zealand, hiking is called tramping, and tents are used alongside a nationwide network of huts. Hill walking is equivalent in Britain (but this can also refer to a day walk), though backpackers make use of a variety of accommodation, in addition to camping. Backpackers use simple huts in South Africa. Trekking and bushwalking are other words used to describe such multi-day trips. The terms walking tour or long distance hike are also used.

Backpacking as a method of travel is a different activity, which mainly uses public transport during a journey that can last months. It is, however, similar to bikepacking, bicycle touring, canoe and kayak camping, and trail riding, with saddlebags.

==Definition==
Backpacking is an outdoor recreation where gear is carried in a backpack. This can include food, water, bedding, shelter, clothing, stove, and cooking kit. Given that backpackers must carry their gear, the total weight of their bag and its contents is a primary concern of backpackers. Backpacking trips range from one night to weeks or months, sometimes aided by planned resupply points, drops, or caches.

==Research==
Carrying loads appears to have differentiated humans from other animals.

===Fitness benefits===
A weighted carry from backpacking taxes muscles. A weighted load stresses the shoulders, delts, back, abs, obliques, hips, quads, hamstrings and the knees. Humans can carry weight under in a safe manner, and a weighted carry is as beneficial for the cardiovascular system as a light run, and for exercise, a weighted carry helps avoid injuries.

A differential exists between a man running in comparison to a man walking while carrying a backpack. A man running, without a backpack, loads his knees with of stress per stride. The same person, carrying a pack, loads his knees with of stress per step.

==Accommodations==
Backpacking camps are usually more spartan than campsites where gear is transported by car or boat. In areas with heavy backpacker traffic, a hike-in campsite might have a fire ring (where permissible), an outhouse, a wooden bulletin board with a map and information about the trail and area. Many hike-in camps are no more than level patches of ground free of underbrush. In remote wilderness areas hikers must choose their own site. Established camps are rare and the ethos is to &quot;leave no trace&quot; when gone.

In some regions, varying forms of accommodation exist, from simple log lean-to&#x27;s to staffed facilities offering escalating degrees of service. Beds, meals, and even drinks may be had at Alpine huts scattered among well-traveled European mountains. Backpackers there can walk from hut-to-hut without leaving the mountains, while in places like the Lake District or Yorkshire Dales in England hill-walkers descend to stay in youth hostels, farmhouses or guest houses. Reservations can usually be made in advance and are recommended in the high season.

In the more remote parts of Great Britain, especially Scotland, bothies exist to provide simple (free) accommodation for backpackers. On the French system of long distance trails, &quot;Grande Randonnées&quot;, backpackers can stay in &quot;gîtes d&#x27;étapes&quot;, which are simple hostels provided for walkers and cyclists. There are some simple shelters and occasional mountain hut also provided in North America, including on the Appalachian Trail. Another example is the High Sierra Camps in the Yosemite National Park. Long-distance backpacking trails with huts also exist in South Africa, including the 100 km plus Amatola Trail, in the Eastern Cape Province. Backpacking is also popular in the Himalayas (often called trekking there), where porters and pack animals are often used.
== Equipment ==

Backpacking gear depends on the terrain and climate, and on a hiker&#x27;s plans for shelter (refuges, huts, gites, camping, etc.). It may include:

#A backpack of appropriate size. Backpacks can include frameless, external frame, internal frame, and bodypack styles.
#Clothing and footwear appropriate for the conditions.
#Food and a means to prepare it (stove, utensils, pot, etc.).
#Sleep system such as a sleeping bag and a pad.
#Survival gear.
#A shelter such as a tent, tarp or bivouac sack.
#Water containers and purifiers.

=== Water ===

Proper hydration is critical to successful backpacking. Depending on conditions - which include weather, terrain, load, and the hiker&#x27;s age and fitness - a backpacker may drink 2 to 8 litres (1/2 to 2 gallons), or more, per day. At per water is exceptionally heavy. It is impossible to carry more than a few days&#x27; supply. Therefore, hikers often drink natural water supplies, sometimes after filtering or purifying.

Some hikers will treat water before drinking to protect against waterborne diseases carried by bacteria and protozoa. The chief treatment methods include:

* Boiling
* Treatment with chemicals such as chlorine or iodine
* Filtering (often used with chemical treatments)
* Treatment with ultraviolet light

Water may be stored in bottles or collapsible plastic bladders. Hydration bladders are increasingly popular.

===Food===

Backpacking is energy intensive. It is essential to bring enough food to maintain both energy and health. The weight of food is an important issue to consider. Consequently, items with high food energy, long shelf life, and low mass and volume deliver the most utility. Taste and satisfaction are issues that are of varying importance to individual hikers, as they consider whether it is worth the effort (and trade-off against other gear) to carry fresh, heavy, or luxury food items. The shorter the trip and easier the conditions the more feasible such treats become.

In many cases, heat, fuel and utensils are used. Small liquid or gas-fueled campstoves and lightweight cooking pots are common. Campfires are sometimes prohibited.

Some backpackers consume dried foods, including many common household foods such as cereal, oatmeal, powdered milk, cheese, crackers, sausage, salami, dried fruit, peanut butter, pasta and rice. Popular snacks include trail mix, easily prepared at home; nuts, energy bars, chocolate, and other energy-dense foods. Coffee, tea, and cocoa are common beverages.
Package food in plastic bags while avoiding heavier jars and cans. Dehydrators are popular for drying fruit, jerky, and pre-cooked meals.

Many hikers use freeze-dried precooked entrees for hot meals, quickly reconstituted by adding boiling water. An alternative is Ultra High Temperature (UHT) processed food, which has its moisture retained and merely needs heating with a special, water-activated chemical reaction.

Specialized cookbooks are available on trailside food and the challenges inherent in making it. Some focus on planning meals and preparing ingredients for short trips; others on the challenges of organizing and preparing meals revolving around the bulk rationing prevalent in extended trail hikes, particularly those with pre-planned food drops.

==Ultralight-hiking==

Some people seek out lighter equipment for long-distance hikes, as it is easier to carry, reduces physical strain, and allows for ease of long distance travel. Ultralight gear has become increasingly more commonly used in past years as it reduces the strain on the hiker. Specialist ultralight gear is widely available, but can be expensive. Materials can include carbon fiber, lightweight alloys, specialty plastics, and impregnated fabrics.

== Skills and safety ==


* Survival skills can provide peace of mind and may make the difference between life and death when the weather, terrain, or environment turns unexpectedly for the worse.
* Navigation and orienteering are useful to find the trailhead, then find and follow a route to a desired sequence of destinations, and then an exit. In case of disorientation, orienteering skills are important to determine the current location and formulate a route to somewhere more desirable. At their most basic, navigation skills allow one to choose the correct sequence of trails to follow. In situations where a trail or clear line-of-sight to the desired destination is not present, navigation and orienteering allow the backpacker to understand the terrain and wilderness around them and, using their tools and practices, select the appropriate direction to hike. Weather (rain, fog, snow), terrain (hilly, rock faces, dense forest), and hiker experience can all impact and increase the challenges to navigation in the wilderness.
* First aid: effectively dealing with minor injuries (s, punctures, sprains) is considered by many a fundamental backcountry skill. More subtle, but maybe even more important, is recognizing and promptly treating hypothermia, heat stroke, dehydration and hypoxia, as these are rarely encountered in daily life.
* Leave No Trace is the backpacker&#x27;s version of the golden rule: To have beautiful and pristine places to enjoy, help make them. At a minimum, do not make them worse.
* Distress signaling is a skill of last resort.

== Discrimination in backpacking (hiking) ==
=== History ===
Backpacking has been a historically white male-dominated outdoor recreational activity. With official backpacks for the sport being patented since 1878, it is indicative of the demographics that the first backpack designed for and marketed towards women wasn&#x27;t invented until 1979, over 100 years later.

Backpacking was popularized in the 1960&#x27;s after the passing of The Wilderness Act. Since then, the majority of backpackers have been young, white, men. Studies surrounding the outdoor activity have reflected this. The effects on backpacking (hiking) on women wasn&#x27;t studied until around 2004, and research is still lacking.

===Winter backpacking===
Winter backpacking requires a higher level of skill and generally more specialized gear than in other seasons. Skis or snowshoes may be required to traverse deep snow, or crampons and an ice axe where needed. Winter sleeping bags and tents are essential, as are waterproof, water-repellent, and moisture dissipating materials. Cotton clothing retains moisture and chills the body, both particularly dangerous in cold weather. Winter backpackers stick to wool or synthetic fabric like nylon or polypropylene, which hold less moisture and often have specialized wicking properties to dissipate sweat generated during aerobic activities. Layering is essential, as wet clothes quickly sap body heat and can lead to frostbite or hypothermia.

A winter bivouac can also be made in a snow cave. It has thermal properties similar to an igloo and is effective both at providing protection from wind and low temperatures. A properly made snow cave can be 0 °C (32 °F) or warmer inside, even when outside temperatures are −40 °C (−40 °F).
It is constructed by excavating snow so that its entrance tunnel is below the main space in order to retain warm air. Construction is simplified by building on a steep slope and digging slightly upwards and horizontally into the snow. The roof is domed to prevent dripping on the occupants. Adequate snow depth, free of rocks and ice, is needed — generally is sufficient. A quinzhee is similar, but constructed by tunneling into mounded snow rather than by digging into a natural snow formation.

===Fastpacking===

Fastpacking is a recreational activity that combines ultralight backpacking with running, and, on steep slopes, hiking. It is a multi-day adventure that usually takes places along long distance trails. A sleeping bag is carried and other essential backpacking items, and often a tent or similar shelter, if places to stay are not available.

===Other===

* Backpacking (travel), where public transport is used to visit cultural attractions, rather than natural ones, though it may also include wilderness side trips.
* Adventure travel, tourism in a highly unpredictable or hazardous region or environment.
* Thru-hiking, traversing a long-distance trail in a single, continuous journey.
* Ultralight backpacking, which minimizes both weight and amount of gear carried, typically employed in highly aerobic back-country pursuits.
* Wilderness survival

<doc id="854047" wikidata="Q6483345" url="?curid=854047" title="Lance Cairns">
<text>Bernard Lance Cairns (born 10 October 1949) is a former all-rounder who played for the New Zealand national cricket team, and is the father of New Zealand cricketer Chris Cairns.

He was also known for the unusual bat he played with throughout much of his career. Known as &quot;Excalibur&quot;, the shoulders of the bat were planed down to form a conical rather than rectangular shape.

Cairns was a swing bowler with an unorthodox &#x27;front on&#x27; action. He took 130 Test Match wickets and 89 ODI wickets. He took ten wickets in New Zealand&#x27;s first ever win on English soil, at Headingley in 1983.

==Domestic career==
In a domestic match, for Otago v Wellington, he hit 110, his only first-class century, in 51 balls hitting 9 sixes in an hour. He scored 928 Test Match and 987 ODI runs at more than a run a ball.

==International career==
He was a member of both the one-day and Test New Zealand teams between 1974 and 1985. He also appeared for Central Districts, Northern Districts and Otago in New Zealand domestic cricket. He was also the professional for Bishop Auckland in the North 
Yorkshire and South Durham League in the North East of England.

===Record hitting===
New Zealand were favourites coming into the finals of the World Series Cup, a tournament heavily hyped as a chance for New Zealand to gain &#x27;revenge&#x27; after the &#x27;underarm&#x27; incident in 1980/81. The 1982/83 series saw New Zealand achieve an impressive run of victories in the ten match qualifying round with Australia and England. This included three consecutive wins over Australia and a famous match in Adelaide, where two world records were broken on the same day. New Zealand scored a world record 297–6, in beating England&#x27;s 296–5.

Cairns set the scene for a dramatic run chase with 49 off 24 balls, which included three sixes off the English spinners. However, it took a match-winning seventh-wicket partnership of 121 by Jeremy Coney (47 not out) and &#x27;Man of the Match&#x27; Richard Hadlee (79), to bring New Zealand home for an &#x27;impossible&#x27; victory, watched by nearly 1.5 million Kiwis on television, almost half the population and a record for a sporting telecast at the time.

After a rain-affected First Final in Sydney, New Zealand went to the MCG one-nil down in the best of three finals series. Without the injured Hadlee (who missed both Finals), New Zealand had collapsed, beaten and demoralised, at 44–6, chasing Australia&#x27;s score of 302–8. Dennis Lillee, who had just waved off New Zealand&#x27;s last recognised batsman, awaited the arrival of Cairns.

Lillee&#x27;s first ball was a bouncer that hit Cairns on the head. The batsman&#x27;s response was to hit two sixes in three balls off Ken MacLeay, before hitting two consecutive sixes off Rodney Hogg, and in the next over, doing the same to Lillee. The highlight was undoubtedly a one-handed shot off Lillee, which soared over the fine leg fence. Cairns&#x27; dismissal was an anti-climax; out for 52, offering a simple catch to Steve Smith at cover off the bowling of Geoff Lawson.

&quot;He backs off again and thrashes that one! And that&#x27;s cleared Graeme Wood&#x27;s head at mid-off! That&#x27;s the sixth one! That must be an incredible bat he&#x27;s got! It must be made of extremely good English willow.&quot;
&quot;Very heavy English willow ! And there goes Excalibur into action again! Straight over the top of long-off, one of the most difficult shots in the book and umpire Tony Crafter&#x27;s arms are growing heavy, he&#x27;s been putting them above his head so often he&#x27;s getting tired!&quot; - TCN Nine commentators Ian Chappell and Frank Tyson, 13 February 1983.

New Zealand eventually lost the match by 149 runs, and the Finals series 2–0, to an Australian team that had been markedly inferior in the preceding qualifying stages of the competition.

Despite Cairns&#x27; heroics (he also hit a spectacular six over cover off Lawson in the First Final at the SCG) Richard Hadlee&#x27;s absence from both finals was probably the reason for New Zealand&#x27;s &#x27;shattered dream&#x27;.
Nevertheless, the New Zealand team, and Cairns in particular, received unprecedented adulation when they returned home for a three-match series against England, who had lost the Ashes 2-1 and had failed to make the WSC Finals in their recently completed Australian tour. England were desperate to salvage something from their tour down under and &#x27;The Rothmans Cup&#x27; was the last prize on offer.

New Zealand whitewashed the hapless &#x27;Poms&#x27;, winning with three memorable performances to sold-out crowds in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. Cairns was again the star. He hit sixes in all three games, with one of them leaving Wellington&#x27;s Basin Reserve and ending up in a busy street outside the ground.

In the 1983/84 home series against England Cairns took his best test figures of 7-143 off 45 overs in the first test at the Basin Reserve, Wellington. After New Zealand&#x27;s modest first innings total of 219, Cairns took the first five English wickets with only 115 on the board, which put the home side in a strong position on day two. However, a spectacular sixth wicket, 232 run, partnership between Ian Botham (138) and Derek Randall (164) put the visitors in command on day three with New Zealand facing a tough battle over the remaining two days to save the test.

At 402–8, only 158 runs ahead of England early on day five, defeat for New Zealand seemed likely when Cairns joined Jeremy Coney (174*) at the wicket. In perhaps Cairns&#x27; finest test innings, (64), he shared a record ninth wicket partnership of 118 with Coney who went on to score his long-awaited, maiden test century. Cairns, although hitting 10 fours and a six, played a rearguard innings best remembered for its uncharacteristic grit and controlled determination, which helped New Zealand achieve a famous draw against the odds.

The New Zealand total of 537 was a record against England and it set the foundation for an emphatic second test win by an innings and 132 runs at Lancaster Park, Christchurch, where the visitors failed to reach 100 in either innings. After a drawn third test at Eden Park, Auckland, New Zealand achieved its first test series win over England.

===Injury and playing===
Cairns experienced a serious injury when he came out to bat without a helmet against Pakistan in the Third Test in Dunedin in 1984/85. He received a blow to the back of the head from 19-year-old paceman Wasim Akram. After retiring hurt, Cairns was hospitalised with a suspected hairline fracture of the skull and complained of &#x27;dizzy spells&#x27; for months afterwards. In testament to his courage, Cairns was &#x27;padded up&#x27;, this time with a helmet, ready to return to the crease, as New Zealand fought another famous rearguard action to win the test and series. History showed he was not required as Jeremy Coney (111*), this time supported by number eleven Ewen Chatfield (21*), took New Zealand to victory by two wickets.

Cairns recovered to play in the World Championship of Cricket in Sydney and Melbourne in February 1985. A highlight for Cairns was his fine innings against eventual champions India in the semi-final at the SCG (39 out of a total of 206, but with no sixes). In March he left for his last major tour as a frontline player for New Zealand, a harrowing trip to the West Indies where New Zealand lost heavily against the often brutal fast bowling of the homeside. Cairns played in only the first two tests of the four test series taking only five wickets at an average of 63.00. At aged 36 his decline as an international player seemed inevitable.

===Later career===
His final series for New Zealand was a personal anti-climax for this immensely popular cricketer. The historic 1985/86 test series win in Australia saw Cairns play only in the deciding third test in Perth. Although playing in his usual spirited fashion, Cairns failed to take a wicket, nor score a run, in this his final international game. Despite Cairns&#x27; disappointment, New Zealand won by six wickets to take the series 2–1, and it was fitting, considering his unselfish service to New Zealand cricket since 1974, that Cairns was part of this &#x27;ultimate&#x27; triumph.

Still a sentimental crowd favourite, he was nevertheless left out of the New Zealand World Series Cup squad which returned to Australia in January 1986. This unpopular decision, albeit inevitable due to injury and loss of form, spelled the end of his international career. Like long-standing captain Geoff Howarth at the beginning of the summer, Cairns was forced into retirement, and somewhat controversially denied the dignity of choosing his own &#x27;time to go&#x27;.

==Personal life==
Cairns has been profoundly deaf since age 17, which he blamed on working in noisy conditions. In December 2009 he was fitted with a cochlear implant. He is the Ambassador for The National Foundation for the Deaf Inc and participates in raising awareness for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing communities.

Cairns was the subject of an episode of the TVNZ production &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1998 which was presented by Paul Holmes.

Following his retirement from cricket, Cairns concentrated on his golf skills and became a low-handicap golfer known for his extremely long drives. After relocating to Gisborne, he met and later married Carol Edwards, who died in 2008 from cancer. He represented Poverty Bay-East Coast at New Zealand Masters tournaments.

<doc id="854048" wikidata="Q899266" url="?curid=854048" title="Boletaceae">
<text>The Boletaceae are a family of mushroom-forming fungi, primarily characterised by small pores on the spore-bearing hymenial surface (at the underside of the mushroom), instead of gills as are found in most agarics. Nearly as widely distributed as the agarics, the family is renowned for hosting some prime edible species highly sought after by mushroom hunters worldwide, such as the cep or king bolete (&quot;Boletus edulis&quot;). A number of rare or threatened species are also present in the family, that have become the focus of increasing conservation concerns. As a whole, the typical members of the family are commonly known as boletes.

Boletes are a group of mushrooms reasonably safe for human consumption, as none of them are known to be deadly to adults. Edible bolete species are especially suitable for novice collectors, since they pose little danger of being confused with deadly poisonous mushrooms, such as deadly &quot;Amanita&quot; species which bear gills instead of pores in their hymenial surface. Some boletes are toxic and may cause gastrointestinal poisoning if consumed, but these are unlikely to be confused with popular edible species in the family.

The family has been the subject of extensive systematic revisions in recent years, as some of the early established genera (particularly &quot;Boletus&quot;, &quot;Leccinum&quot; and &quot;Xerocomus&quot;), have revealed to be highly polyphyletic, and the original number of genera within the family had been underestimated. As a result, several new species and genera have been described from Asia, Europe and North America, while many existing species have been transferred to different genera, in concordance with phylogenetic results.

==Description==
Most species of Boletaceae produce large, fleshy mushrooms, with a more or less central stipe. The fruit bodies typically have tubular hymenophores, although a small number of species (e.g. &quot;Phylloporus&quot;) are lamellate.
The spore deposit colours are commonly (yellowish-green), yellowish, brownish, or vinaceous (red-wine coloured), and when viewed under the microscope spores are usually fusiform or subfusiform. In many species, parts of the fruit body will turn blue, red, or black when bruised or exposed to the air, as a result of the oxidation of pulvinic acid derivatives, like variegatic, xerocomic, and atrotomentinic acids.

==Taxonomy==
Boletaceae were first described by the French botanist François Fulgis Chevallier in 1826, as a family distinct from Agaricaceae. Five genera were initially included in Chevallier&#x27;s circumscription: &quot;Boletus&quot; (which is the type genus of the family), &quot;Cladoporus&quot; (now synonymous with &quot;Laetiporus&quot;), &quot;Physisporus&quot; (now &quot;Perenniporia&quot;), &quot;Polyporus&quot;, and &quot;Fistulina&quot;. However, all of the original genera except &quot;Boletus&quot; have since been transferred to different families, and several new Boletaceae genera have been described.

===Genera===
Rolf Singer, in the 4th edition (1986) of his &quot;Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy&quot;, included 26 genera and 415 species in Boletaceae. In the &quot;Dictionary of the Fungi&quot; (10th edition, 2008), 35 Boletaceae genera were recognised, which collectively contained 787 species. Molecular phylogenetic studies in the 2000s have revised the concept of the family; in a highly cited 2006 publication, Manfred Binder and David Hibbett recognised 38 genera within the family, many of which had remained at the time undescribed. The number of Boletaceae genera increased significantly in the following years, as some of the early-established genera (&quot;Boletus&quot;, &quot;Leccinum&quot;, &quot;Xerocomus&quot;), further revealed to be highly polyphyletic. In the comprehensive work of Wu and colleagues (2014), seven major clades at subfamily level and 59 generic lineages were uncovered, including four new subfamilies (&quot;Austroboletoideae&quot;, &quot;Chalciporoideae&quot;, &quot;Leccinoideae&quot;, and &quot;Zangioideae&quot;) and 22 potential new genera. To formally name the generic lineages unravelled by molecular phylogenies, several new genera have since been described from Asia, Europe and North America including, among others, &quot;Baorangia&quot;, &quot;Butyriboletus&quot;, &quot;Cacaoporus&quot;, &quot;Caloboletus&quot;, &quot;Exsudoporus&quot;, &quot;Imperator&quot; and &quot;Rubroboletus&quot;.

Some characters traditionally emphasised in morphology-based taxonomy, such as basidiospore ornamentation and &quot;stuffed&quot; pore morphology, revealed to be incongruent with molecular taxonomy, suggesting that certain traits evolved more than once within the family.

(*) Note that the phylogenetic and taxonomic position of many taxa currently remaining in genus &quot;Boletus&quot; has not yet been clarified. The number of species in this genus will therefore significantly reduce in the following years, as more taxa will be transferred to different genera, or found to be synonyms.

Many other genera formerly part of this family have been moved into other, smaller families, as work with molecular phylogeny shows that they are more distantly related, even if morphologically similar. Representative of this adjustment, is the move of the slimy-capped genus &quot;Suillus&quot; to the family Suillaceae.

==Distribution==

Boletes are found worldwide, on every continent except Antarctica. Well-known and well-described in the temperate latitudes in the northern hemisphere, newer research has shown significant diversity in tropical and southern hemisphere regions as well. E. J. H. Corner found evidence of at least 60 species on the island of Singapore alone. In 1972 he described 140 species from the Malay Peninsula and Borneo and estimated there were at least as many yet to be documented. Over 100 species belonging to 52 genera have been reported from China, which has emerged as one of the worldwide hotspots of Boletaceae diversity. The family is also reasonably well-represented in the Mediterranean region, where many rare or range-restricted species can be found.

==Ecology==

As heterotrophic organisms, the majority Boletaceae species are symbiotic, and form mutually beneficial ectomycorrhizal associations with various trees and shrubs. However, a number of ancestral species in genera &quot;Buchwaldoboletus&quot; and &quot;Pseudoboletus&quot;, are saprotrophic or parasitic. Evidence suggests that some, if not all, species of &quot;Chalciporus&quot; might also have a mycoparasitic interaction with other fungi. The exact trophic status of some South American and African boletes, such as species of &quot;Phylloboletellus&quot;, is nonetheless not yet fully clarified, as fruit bodies are often found without the presence of ectomycorrhizal vegetation.

Most frequently associated tree-hosts are members of the Fagaceae, particularly oak (&quot;Quercus&quot;), beech (&quot;Fagus&quot;) and chestnut (&quot;Castanea&quot;). Fewer species are associated with conifers, mostly spruce (&quot;Picea&quot;) and fir (&quot;Abies&quot;). In the Mediterranean region, most boletes are strongly associated with evergreen oaks, particularly members of the &quot;Ilex&quot; group, such as the holm oak (&quot;Quercus ilex&quot;), the kermes oak (&quot;Q. coccifera&quot;), or the golden oak (&quot;Q. alnifolia&quot;). Some boletes are also known to grow in association with Cistaceae shrubs, mainly &quot;Cistus&quot; and &quot;Helianthemum&quot;, and at least one species (&quot;Leccinellum corsicum&quot;) is exclusively associated with rockrose.

Most boletes are sensitive to cold and fruit during warm spells in the summer and early months of the autumn, while some have very specific preferences with regards to substrate. For instance, the highly sought after &quot;Boletus aereus&quot; is mostly found on acidic soils, whereas the poisonous &quot;Rubroboletus satanas&quot; is predominantly calciphilous and mostly occurs on chalk. Other species, such as &quot;Hemileccinum impolitum&quot; or &quot;Leccinellum lepidum&quot;, are indifferent to the substrate and frequently occur on both calcareous and acidic soil.

==Conservation==

A number of Boletaceae species are considered rare, vulnerable or endangered, and some have been included in regional or national Red Lists. &quot;Rubroboletus dupainii&quot; is listed among the 33 threatened fungi of Europe, as part of Appendix I of the Bern Convention. &quot;Rubroboletus rhodoxanthus&quot; is considered extinct in England and critically endangered in the Czech Republic. Also critically endangered in the Czech Republic are &quot;Aureoboletus moravicus&quot;, &quot;Buchwaldoboletus sphaerocephalus&quot;, &quot;Butyriboletus fuscoroseus&quot;, &quot;Imperator rhodopurpureus&quot;, &quot;Leccinum roseotinctum&quot; and &quot;Rubroboletus rubrosanguineus&quot;. Eleven species of Boletaceae, &quot;Boletus aereus&quot;, &quot;Boletus pinophilus&quot;, &quot;Butyriboletus regius&quot;, &quot;Hemileccinum impolitum&quot;, &quot;Imperator luteocupreus&quot;, &quot;I. rhodopurpureus&quot;, &quot;I. torosus&quot;, &quot;Rubroboletus dupainii&quot;, &quot;R. lupinus&quot;, &quot;R. pulchrotinctus&quot; and &quot;R. satanas&quot;, are considered vulnerable or endangered in North Macedonia and have been included in the national Red List of fungi. Similarly, twenty species of Boletaceae are included in the Red List of fungi in Bulgaria.

Research from the Mediterranean region suggests that many boletes might be under threat from accelerated climate changes and long-term drought. In a ten-year study from the island of Cyprus, most bolete species were found to be rare, highly restricted by low soil moisture and exhibited very erratic fruiting patterns strongly correlating to annual, late summer and early autumn precipitation.

==Edibility==
A large number of boletes are edible, few are delicious and some are considered to be true culinary delicacies. The much sought after king bolete (&quot;Boletus edulis&quot;), in particular, is a species of high commercial value and has been described as &quot;the wild mushroom &quot;par excellence&quot;&quot;. In the Province of Parma in northern Italy, the four most sought after boletes, &quot;Boletus edulis&quot;, &quot;B. aereus&quot;, &quot;B. reticulatus&quot; and &quot;B. pinophilus&quot;, have been collected and commercially exploited for centuries. Boletes are widely collected and sold in markets throughout Spain, particularly the province of Aragon. Scandinavian cuisine praises boletes. They are a regular feature of Finnish cuisine and, especially the king bolete, is considered an unsurpassed culinary mushroom, widely used in various soups, sauces, casseroles and hotpots. Bolete mushrooms are sometimes also used as pizza topping, not unlike champignons, shiitake, or portobellos.

Two species of &quot;Butyriboletus&quot;, the royal bolete (&quot;B. regius&quot;) and the butter bolete (&quot;B. appendiculatus&quot;) are also culinary valued, though much less common than the ceps. In northern Europe, two of the commonest and most frequently collected edible boletes are the bay bolete (&quot;Imleria badia&quot;), whose pores bruise blue-green, and the orange birch bolete, which is a &quot;Leccinum&quot; with an orange cap and which bruises a bluish grey.

Several guidebooks recommend avoiding all red-pored boletes, but both &quot;Neoboletus luridiformis&quot; (= &quot;Neoboletus erythropus&quot;) and &quot;Suillellus luridus&quot; are edible when well-cooked and widely consumed in certain parts of Europe.

===Lookalikes===
Poisonous or otherwise inedible species are also present in the family, however, such as the unpalatable bitter species &quot;Caloboletus calopus&quot; and the aptly named bitter bolete (&quot;Tylopilus felleus&quot;), with a taste compared to bile, as well as some orange-capped species of &quot;Leccinum&quot;. As the bitter bolete resembles somewhat the king bolete, it can produce literally a bitter disappointment to the mushroom hunter. The rule of thumb is that the bitter bolete has pink pores, and a brownish stipe with a dark brown (sometimes approaching black) reticulum, while the cep has whitish pores, which in maturity become yellowish or sometimes with a faint olivaceous tint, a light-colored (white and/or similar in color to the rest of the stipe) reticulum and white hyphae tufts at the base of the stipe. The bitter bolete also lacks the stuffed or plugged pore appearance (caused by a hyphal mat of cheilocystidia) that is common in the cep and its allies. If uncertain, tasting a small piece of cap context should clinch the identification, since &quot;Tylopilus felleus&quot; has a strong, foul bitter taste.

==Toxicity==

&quot;Rubroboletus satanas&quot; has long been considered to be poisonous, though it is not known to have been responsible for any fatalities and the symptoms are predominantly gastrointestinal in nature. A glycoprotein, bolesatine, is thought to be responsible for the poisonings. When given to mice, Bolesatine causes massive thrombosis, while at lower concentrations it is a mitogen, inducing cell division to human T lymphocytes. A similar compound, bolevenine, has been isolated from the poisonous &quot;Neoboletus venenatus&quot; in Japan.

More recent studies have associated the poisoning caused by &quot;R. satanas&quot; with hyperprocalcitonemia, and classified it as a distinct syndrome among fungal poisonings. Several other boletes are known to cause varying degrees of gastrointestinal symptoms, especially if eaten raw or insufficiently cooked.

One incident of death associated with &quot;Rubroboletus pulcherrimus&quot; was reported in 1994; a couple developed gastrointestinal symptoms after eating this fungus, with the husband finally succumbing. An autopsy revealed infarction of the midgut.

<doc id="854049" wikidata="Q492202" url="?curid=854049" title="Backpacking (travel)">
<text>Backpacking is a form of low-cost, independent travel, which often includes staying in inexpensive lodgings and carrying all necessary possessions in a backpack. Once seen as a marginal form of travel undertaken only through necessity, it has become a mainstream form of tourism. 

While backpacker tourism is generally a form of youth travel, primarily undertaken by young people during gap years, it is also undertaken by older people during holidays, a career break, or at retirement, or by digital nomads, as part of a minimalist lifestyle. As such, backpackers can be of any age, but are typically aged 18 to 30. 

==Characteristics==
Backpacker tourism generally, but does not always, include:
* Traveling internationally for long periods of time on a tight budget.
* Willingness to forgo luxury, suffer hardships, and be resourceful in order to make such a journey possible.
* Traveling via public transport or hitchhiking, using inexpensive lodging such as hostels or homestays, and other methods of lowering costs.
* A longer duration trip when compared with conventional vacations.
* Working in other countries for short stints, depending on work permit laws. It can also be undertaken by digital nomads, people who work using technology while living a nomadic lifestyle.
* A search for authenticity. Backpacking is perceived not only as a form of tourism but as a means of education. Backpackers want to experience what they consider the &quot;real&quot; destination rather than a packaged version often associated with mass tourism.
* The desire to take part in or craft a narrative around traveling.
* An interest in personal growth and discovery, as well as a desire to experience new culture, meet new people and foster a new perspective on the world. This is more significant considering that many backpackers are at a transitional point in their lives; such as between education and employment.
==History==
People have travelled for thousands of years with their possessions on their backs, but usually out of need rather than for recreation. Between 3400 and 3100 BCE, Ötzi the Iceman was traveling in Italy with a backpack made of animal skins and a wooden frame, although there are some thoughts that this may actually have been his snowshoes. In the 7th century, Xuanzang, a Chinese Buddhist monk, travelled to India with a hand-made backpack.

In the 17th century, Italian adventurer Giovanni Francesco Gemelli Careri was likely one of the first people to engage in backpacker tourism.

The modern popularity of backpacking can be traced, at least partially, to the hippie trail of the 1960s and 1970s, which in turn followed sections of the old Silk Road. Some backpackers follow the same trail today. Since the late-20th century, backpackers have visited Southeast Asia in large numbers.
===Benefits===
A 2018 study of over 500 backpackers conducted by researchers at Sun Yat-sen University and Shaanxi Normal University in China and Edith Cowan University in Australia showed that for Westerners, backpacking leads to acquired capabilities like effective communication, decision-making, adaptability, and problem solving, all of which contribute to an increase in self-efficacy, and for Chinese backpackers, acquiring skills like time and money management, language development, stress management, and self-motivation provided the biggest increase in self-efficacy.

Mark Hampton of the University of Kent, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, argued in 2010 that for many low-income communities in the developing world, the economic benefits of hosting backpackers outweigh their negative impacts. Since backpackers tend to consume local products, stay in small guest houses, and use locally owned ground transport, more of their expenditure is retained in-country than in conventional mass tourism.

===Criticism===
Backpacker tourism of the hippie trail has been criticized for possibly encouraging urban liberal minorities while insulting Islamic traditionalist theology, possibly contributing to the Islamic reawakening in the late 1970s.

Even though one of the primary aims of backpacking is to seek the &quot;authentic&quot;, the majority of backpackers spend most of their time interacting with other backpackers, and interactions with locals are of &quot;secondary importance&quot;.

Backpacker tourism has been criticized for the transformation of some sleepy towns, such as the creation of the Full Moon Party on Ko Pha-ngan in Thailand, which includes &quot;scores of topless teenagers urinating into the ocean&quot;.

== Variants ==
Flashpacking and Poshpacking refer to backpacking with more money and resources. The words combine &quot;backpacking&quot; with &quot;flash&quot;, a slang term for being fancy, or &quot;posh&quot;, an informal adjective for upper class.

Begpacking combines &quot;begging&quot; and &quot;backpacking&quot; in reference to individuals who beg (ask directly or indirectly for money), solicit money during street performances, or vend (sell postcards or other small items) as a way to extend their overseas travel. The trend has drawn criticism for taking money away from people in actual need, with one known begpacker barred from entering Singapore. Begpacking is common in Southeast Asia and is a trend in South America and South Korea.

<doc id="854056" wikidata="Q2715495" url="?curid=854056" title="Lord Asriel">
<text>Lord Asriel is a character in Philip Pullman&#x27;s &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; trilogy. Asriel is a member of the aristocracy in a parallel universe dominated by the Church. Possessed of enormous determination and willpower, he is fierce in nature and commands great respect in both the political and academic spheres, being a military leader and a fellow of Jordan College in his world&#x27;s version of Exeter College, Oxford.

==Naming==
&quot;Asriel&quot; is one variant spelling of the Hebraic name Azrael, who occurs in the Jewish and Muslim tradition, and is traditionally believed to be the Angel of Death in some sects of Islam, as well as some Hebrew lore. His dæmon is called Stelmaria, a snow leopard.

==History within the novel==
Prior to the beginning of the trilogy, Lord Asriel had been a highly respected member of the &#x27;Brytish&#x27; aristocracy. He had been an explorer and did work in &quot;experimental theology&quot;, through which he acquired much power, land, and money. After having an affair with another politician&#x27;s wife, Marisa Coulter, that resulted in the birth of Lyra, his life changed. Mrs Coulter&#x27;s husband, Edward Coulter, attacked Lyra and her foster mother intending to harm and possibly murder Lyra. Lord Asriel intervened and killed Coulter. When the church found out, Asriel was tried and lost all property. Six-month-old Lyra was sent to a convent. Lord Asriel, who hated the church, arrived one day and took Lyra to his alma mater, Jordan College, where she was brought up believing Asriel to be her uncle, rather than her father.

At the beginning of the trilogy, Lord Asriel visits Jordan College where he is almost poisoned by the Master. Asriel is saved by Lyra, who has secretly been watching the Master pour the poison into Lord Asriel&#x27;s wine glass. Asriel is giving a Lecture to the Fellows of Jordan College hoping to raise money for an expedition. In the lecture he uses photograms of Dust and a city in the sky, as well as a severed head that he says is Stanislaus Grumman&#x27;s. He travels to Svalbard but is imprisoned and guarded by the bear warriors known as the panserbjørne, led by Iofur Raknison. This action has been ordered by the General Oblation Board, which is headed by his ex-lover, Marisa Coulter. He receives hospitable treatment, and waits for a child on whom to perform intercision (a process to detach a child&#x27;s dæmon that often results in the child&#x27;s death). He is hoping to open a window in the aurora using the energy generated by the intercision in order to travel into a different universe. Eventually a child arrives, Roger Parslow, unwittingly brought by Lyra.

Asriel enters Cittàgazze and, after a battle, allies himself with the rebel angels under Xaphania. He travels to an empty world and builds an enormous basalt fortress, gathering armies from many different worlds to start his rebellion against the Kingdom of Heaven. Ruta Skadi finds him, and he tells her his plan, and gets her clan&#x27;s support in the war.

Later, he has his allies, King Ogunwe and Lord Roke, find and rescue Lyra from Mrs Coulter. They capture Mrs Coulter, but Lyra and Will escape with two of Lord Roke&#x27;s agents. Lord Asriel then attends to Mrs Coulter and tries to influence Lyra and Will, as they hold the key to renewing the Dust flow. Lord Asriel lets Mrs Coulter escape in an &#x27;Intention Craft&#x27; and has Lord Roke follow her to gain information from the Consistorial Court of Discipline. They learn that the Church has made a bomb to kill Lyra, and Lord Asriel rescues Mrs Coulter just in time. He destroys Saint-Jean Les Eaux (the location of the bomb) with his Intention Craft.

Lyra survives, and Lord Asriel has his army search for her and Will&#x27;s dæmons so the Authority&#x27;s armies will be unable to control them. When Lord Asriel finds that the bomb has blown a hole under all the worlds into the abyss, he devises a plan to defeat the Authority&#x27;s powerful Regent, Metatron. As his forces fight the armies of the Authority and the Church, Mrs Coulter tricks Metatron into trying to kill Lord Asriel and to take Lyra&#x27;s dæmon. As they are standing on the edge of the abyss, Lord Asriel and Mrs Coulter sacrifice themselves, falling into the abyss and taking Metatron with them. All three are condemned to fall through the abyss for eternity.

==Lyra and Marisa Coulter==
Marisa Coulter was Edward Coulter&#x27;s wife. Lyra, the product of Marisa&#x27;s affair with Lord Asriel, was born when Marisa was just 21. Lyra resembled Asriel rather than Edward Coulter, so Mrs Coulter gave her to Asriel, who placed their daughter with a gyptian woman, later revealed to be Ma Costa. When Edward Coulter found out about the affair, he went to kill the baby Lyra, but Asriel fought and killed Edward. Asriel had his wealth and status taken away, and Lyra was placed in a convent. Asriel, outraged, took Lyra from the convent, and placed her at Jordan College, and ordered the Master to never allow Mrs Coulter to contact Lyra. However, Marisa eventually turns up, intending to take Lyra north. Lyra agrees, but escapes when she discovers Mrs Coulter&#x27;s intentions for the stolen children, as the head of the Oblation Board. When Lyra is kidnapped and taken to Bolvangar, Marisa races in to rescue her just as Lyra and Pantalaimon are about to be severed. In the film adaptation, she comforts Lyra and tells her she is her mother. Horrified, Lyra escapes once again, and this time she seeks out Lord Asriel to deliver the alethiometer. Unknowingly, Lyra leads her friend, Roger, to his death at the hands of Asriel, as Asriel requires the energy release of severing a child from their daemon in order to open the rift between the worlds. At this time Mrs Coulter and Lord Asriel briefly meet, but Asriel leaves her to continue his campaign while Mrs Coulter hesitates.

Lord Asriel and Mrs Coulter meet once again in &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot;, when Mrs Coulter is captured by Asriel&#x27;s men. He rescues her once as well and takes her back to his adamant tower. She and Asriel join forces to defeat Metatron, the powerful regent of the Authority, simply to give Lyra, their child, a chance to live. They die together in a chasm between worlds to destroy Metatron.

==Stage, film and television characterisations==

From December 2003 to March 2004, London&#x27;s Royal National Theatre staged an adaptation of &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; in which Lord Asriel was played by Timothy Dalton.

Daniel Craig played the role of Lord Asriel in the 2007 film adaptation &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; with Nicole Kidman playing Marisa Coulter.

James McAvoy plays the role in the BBC television adaptation.

<doc id="854058" wikidata="Q2607099" url="?curid=854058" title="Mrs. Coulter">
<text>Marisa Coulter (née Delamare), known simply as Mrs. Coulter, is a character in Philip Pullman&#x27;s &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; trilogy and one of the main antagonists of &quot;Northern Lights&quot;: the former lover of Lord Asriel and biological mother of Lyra Belacqua.

==Description==
Mrs. Coulter is 35 years old in the third novel, &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot;. She is described as being &quot;beautiful and young&quot; with &quot;sleek black hair&quot; that &quot;framed her cheeks&quot; and slim, though later accounts of her describe her as having blonde or &quot;golden&quot; hair. Such details of a character&#x27;s physical appearances are uncommon in &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;. There is a reference in &quot;Lyra&#x27;s Oxford&quot; to Mrs. Coulter having written an academic work called &#x27;The Bronze Clocks of Benin&#x27;.

In the books, she is portrayed as an elegant and cool-minded sophisticate with social &quot;savoir faire&quot;, but she is also calculating, power-hungry and ruthless. She has political connections, and is highly placed and trusted in the Church&#x27;s hierarchy, who give her a large degree of autonomy. She arranges for Iorek Byrnison, the heir to the throne of the armoured bears, to be exiled, and plots to dominate the new king, turning the bears into her subordinates. When Lyra is in danger in Bolvangar, her maternal instincts override her other loyalties and she rescues Lyra, although in the second book of the trilogy she still expresses no qualms about killing her to prevent the Fall. However, by the third book she finds herself torn, ultimately feigning loyalty to betray the Church and finally giving up her life to save Lyra. Metatron, the Regent of the Authority describes her character in &quot;the most searching examination Marisa Coulter had ever undergone&quot;, stripping away &quot;all shelter and deceit&quot; and describing that he sees:
: &quot;Corruption and envy and lust for power. Cruelty and coldness. A vicious probing curiosity. Pure, poisonous, toxic malice. You have never from your earliest years shown a shred of compassion or sympathy or kindness without calculating how it would return to your advantage. You have tortured and killed without regret or hesitation; you have betrayed and intrigued and gloried in your treachery. You are a cess-pit of moral filth&quot;.

Despite this, Metatron describes her as lovelier than any wife he had, and he wishes to take her as his consort. This is her final deception as by this point she intends to betray Metatron to safeguard her daughter. She describes her self-perception to Asriel just prior to their joint sacrifice:

: &quot;I told him I was going to betray you, and betray Lyra, and he believed me because I was corrupt and full of wickedness. I wanted him to find no good in me and he didn&#x27;t. There is none. But I love Lyra. Where did this love come from? I don&#x27;t know; it came to me like a thief in the night, and now I love her so much my heart is bursting with it. All I could hope was that my crimes were so monstrous that the love was no bigger than a mustard seed in the shadow of them, and I wished I&#x27;d committed even greater ones to hide it more deeply still&quot;.

Mrs. Coulter&#x27;s dæmon takes the form of a golden monkey with long fur, who is not named in the books, but was given the name &quot;Ozymandias&quot; in the radio adaptation. The golden monkey is shown to be capable of going much further from Mrs. Coulter than other dæmons are able to separate from their humans. How the golden monkey can go so far from Mrs. Coulter is not explained, Mrs. Coulter has not undergone any of the processes which enable other humans to achieve such separation. Her final act in the trilogy occurs when she is reconciled with Asriel, and they together drag Metatron into an endless abyss, the three thus ceasing to exist.

==Relationship with Lyra Belacqua ==
At the beginning of the book &quot;The Northern Lights&quot; Marisa Coulter seems to have a keen interest in Lyra. It is later revealed that Coulter is in fact Lyra&#x27;s mother by her love affair with Lord Asriel (her title of &quot;Mrs&quot; comes from her marriage to Edward Coulter, who died before the events in the books.) In &quot;Northern Lights&quot; John Faa says that she fell in love with Asriel as soon as they met.

Although throughout most of the series Lyra hates and fears her mother, Mrs. Coulter repeatedly saves Lyra. Early in &quot;The Northern Lights&quot;, Mrs. Coulter saves Lyra from a group of child-snatchers known as the &quot;Gobblers&quot; by taking her out of Oxford, and nearing the end of &quot;The Northern Lights&quot;, she again saves Lyra from having her daemon cut away (a process known as intercision). A distraught Mrs. Coulter cries out for Lyra, who passes out. When Lyra suddenly opens her eyes again, she is lying in a soft, comfortable bed. Mrs. Coulter immediately assures Lyra that she is safe and, on her daughter&#x27;s instruction, explains to her why children have to be intercised at such a young age, commenting on their &quot;unhappy thoughts and feelings&quot;. Mrs. Coulter is ultimately forced to make a choice between Lyra and the church when it is revealed that Lyra is the new &quot;Eve&quot; whose death will be sought by the Church to prevent original sin re-entering the world. Coulter takes Lyra to a cave and keeps her drugged there at the beginning of &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; and ultimately saves Lyra at the end of &quot;The Subtle Knife&quot;.

==Adaptations==

* Emma Fielding played Mrs. Coulter in the BBC Radio 4 version of &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;.
* Alison Dowling played her in the Chivers Children&#x27;s Audio Books version, which author Philip Pullman narrated.
* Patricia Hodge played Marisa Coulter in the first run of the National Theatre stage adaptation in London, and Lesley Manville played her in the second run.
* Nicole Kidman played Mrs. Coulter in the film adaptation, &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;. Pullman had previously indicated that he would like to see Kidman play the role. Kidman is blonde, though Pullman approved of the hair colour change made from the book&#x27;s description, saying he regretted not making her blonde in the first place.
* Ruth Wilson plays Mrs. Coulter in the 2019 BBC television adaptation. Her dæmon was changed from a golden monkey to a golden snub-nosed monkey in order to better reflect the two sides of Coulter&#x27;s character.

<text>Timothy Donell Brown (born July 22, 1966) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, where he won the Heisman Trophy, becoming the first wide receiver to do so. He spent sixteen years with the Los Angeles / Oakland Raiders, during which he established himself as one of the NFL&#x27;s greatest wide receivers of all time. Brown has also played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In 2015, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

As of 2023, Brown serves as the league chairman and commissioner of The Arena League, an indoor football league that began play in 2024.

==Early life==
Timothy Donell Brown was born on July 22, 1966, in Dallas, Texas. He attended Woodrow Wilson High School in Dallas, the same school as 1938 Heisman Trophy winner Davey O&#x27;Brien. Brown&#x27;s receipt of the 1987 Heisman Trophy gave Woodrow the distinction of being the first high school in the country to have produced two Heisman Trophy winners. Amazingly, Tim didn&#x27;t play football as a freshman at Woodrow, because he was forbidden to do so by his mother. Instead, he played in the Woodrow band during that first year. But he joined the Woodrow football team as a sophomore, although he initially tried to hide that fact from his mom. She later found out about it when the band leader called his house asking why he was no longer at band practices. Despite his outstanding contributions to Woodrow&#x27;s football program, the team fared poorly, posting only a 4–25–1 record over his three years as a starter. Nevertheless, Brown was heavily recruited by major colleges. His five official visits were to Notre Dame, Nebraska, Oklahoma, nearby SMU and Iowa. While at Woodrow, Brown also was a standout track athlete. He was one of the state&#x27;s top performers in the 400-meter dash, with a PR of 47.14 seconds, and he cleared 7.42 meters in the long jump event.

==College career==
Brown chose the University of Notre Dame and played there from 1984 to 1987, earning the nickname &quot;Touchdown Timmy.&quot; In his first year, he set a freshman record with twenty-eight receptions. As a junior, he set a record with 1,937 all-purpose yards. Offensively he ran for 254 yards with 2 TD and caught 45 passes for 910 yards with 5 TD. During 1987, Brown caught 34 passes for 846 yards, returned 34 punts for 401 yards, rushed for 144 yards, gained 456 yards on 23 kickoff returns, and scored eight touchdowns. Brown finished his career at Notre Dame with 137 receptions for 2,493 yards, a school-record 5,024 all-purpose yards, and 22 touchdowns. However, just as in high school, Brown&#x27;s team achieved limited success, with a 25–21 record over his four seasons, and an 0–2 record in bowl games. But in the year after Brown graduated (1988), Notre Dame won the national title.

Brown was named an All-American twice and won the 1987 Heisman Trophy, becoming the first wide receiver ever to win that award. As of 2020, Woodrow Wilson High School is still the only public high school with two Heisman Trophy winners.

When Brown graduated, he held 19 individual school records.

In 1989, Brown and Davey O&#x27;Brien were inducted together as members of the initial class of the Woodrow Wilson High School Hall of Fame, created in celebration of the school&#x27;s 60th Anniversary.

In 2009, Brown was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.

In January 2012, Brown received the Silver Anniversary Award from the NCAA in recognition of his myriad athletic and professional accomplishments.

==Professional career==
===Los Angeles / Oakland Raiders===
Brown was selected by the Los Angeles Raiders in the first round with the sixth overall pick of the 1988 NFL draft. In his first NFL season, he led the league in kickoff returns, return yards, and yards per return average. Though it took time for him to fill into the role as the team&#x27;s #1 receiver, catching just 147 passes in his first five seasons, he went on to rack up 9 consecutive 1,000-yard seasons from 1993 to 2001. He also led the NFL in punt returns in 1994, and receptions in 1997. In March 1994, Brown was offered and signed a free-agent offer-sheet with the Denver Broncos. The Raiders matched the offer soon thereafter. He was voted to the Pro Bowl nine times, in 1988 and 1991 as a kick returner, and in 1993–97, 1999 and 2001 as a receiver. In 2001, Brown would later play alongside another well-known wide receiver, Jerry Rice. On December 9, 2001, Brown returned a punt 88 yards for a touchdown in a home game against the Kansas City Chiefs, making him the oldest player in NFL history to score a touchdown on a punt return. In 2002, he passed Gene Upshaw to become the Raiders&#x27; all-time leader in games played with 224. He also set Raiders franchise records for receptions, receiving yards, and punt return yards. Brown was released by the Raiders before the 2004 season, as he did not want to accept a smaller role in the offense.

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===
Brown was signed shortly thereafter by the Buccaneers (coached by former Raider head coach Jon Gruden). The move was controversial, considering that Brown had always been a fan favorite in the Oakland area and was much admired by many current and former Raiders players and staff over the sixteen years he spent with the Raider organization. He was the last of the Los Angeles Raiders to remain with Oakland.
On September 27, 2004, in his first game at Oakland since being signed by Tampa Bay, Brown reached 100 career receiving touchdowns, tying him (with Steve Largent) for 3rd on the NFL&#x27;s all-time career receiving touchdown list at that time (behind former teammate Jerry Rice [197] and Cris Carter [130]). He received a standing ovation from the Oakland Raider crowd.

In 2005, Brown signed a one-day contract with the Raiders to retire with the team. The July 18 news conference was attended by two Raiders officials and only one active Raider, wide receiver Jerry Porter. Brown retired with 14,934 receiving yards, the second-highest total in NFL history, 1,094 receptions (3rd), and 100 touchdown catches (3rd-Tied). Brown also gained 190 rushing yards, 3,320 punt-return yards (5th in NFL history), 3 fumble-return yards, and 1,235 yards returning kickoffs. This gave him a total of 19,682 combined net yards, ranking him #5 among the NFL&#x27;s all-time leaders at the time of his retirement. He also scored 105 total touchdowns (100 receiving, 1 rushing, 3 punt returns, 1 kickoff return). Brown is the only player ever to retire in the NFL&#x27;s top five leaders for both receiving and return yards.

Brown became eligible for enshrinement in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2010, but was not selected that year. He was considered a long shot to get in on his first try, as there was a logjam of accomplished receiver candidates, including Jerry Rice (Brown&#x27;s former teammate), Cris Carter and Andre Reed.

On January 7, 2012, and again on January 11, 2013, Brown was selected as a finalist for enshrinement in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but was not chosen.

On January 31, 2015, Brown was selected for enshrinement in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on August 8, 2015.

==NFL career statistics==

=== Postseason ===
==Post-playing career==
Brown was in the movie &quot;Little Giants&quot;, and is co-host on &quot;FSN Pro Football Preview&quot; with former players Jason Sehorn, Eddie George and NFL Insider Jay Glazer. Brown is also a representative for YorHealth.

In 1995, Brown became the National Chairman of Athletes &amp; Entertainers for Kids and the related 9-1-1 for Kids. These efforts have helped over five million children and teens through mentoring and educational programs.

As of 2013, Brown has been the General Manager and Co-Owner of the Texas Revolution of the Champions Indoor Football League in his home state of Texas and was an analyst for ESPN College Football. Brown also hosts a weekly sports-talk show on WRDI.

Brown serves as the League Chairman and Commissioner of The Arena League, an indoor football league that is estimated to begin play in 2024.

Brown currently lives in El Cerrito, California.

==NASCAR==
Brown started a NASCAR racing team as part of their Drive for Diversity program. He was recruiting African American sponsors to fund the venture, and has worked out a technical alliance with Roush Fenway Racing, who will provide support to the upstart team. Brown hopes to eventually find a black, Hispanic, or woman driver to be the star of his team in order to bring an element of diversity to what is a white-dominated sport. However, the plan never successfully began.

==Relationship with Raiders owner Al Davis==
Since joining the Raiders, Brown had a complicated relationship with the Oakland Raiders and late owner Al Davis. During a 2009 interview with Sportsradiointerview.com Brown commented on his former boss:
“Meeting Al (Davis) was pretty unique. I found out five or ten minutes after my first practice there that he hated African-American athletes from Notre Dame. And they literally told me that. They literally told me that because we’re known for using our education more than our athletic ability that he thought that I would be one of these guys that would basically take the money and run. I don’t know if that was a ploy to get me amped up, but it certainly worked.&quot;

In 2000, Brown was dining in an Oakland restaurant with former Raiders Chester McGlockton and Sean Jones. During their meal, Brown found himself unable to approach or speak to Davis. Brown told a reporter, &quot;I was saddened by that because I don&#x27;t know anybody who I&#x27;ve dealt with for twelve years who I can&#x27;t say hello to in that situation. I was saddened that the situation is where it is.&quot;

On August 5, 2004, the Raiders held a press conference with Brown and Davis which stated that Brown was leaving the Raiders. Davis and Brown professed mutual respect for one another and both men expressed a desire for Brown to return to the Raiders someday.

On July 19, 2005, Brown officially retired but the Raiders did not hold a press conference at the team headquarters. Instead, Brown held his own press conference in an Oakland hotel ballroom. Davis did not attend the conference because he had a &quot;scheduling conflict&quot;. Davis did allow Brown to sign a ceremonial $765,000 contract with the Raiders so he could retire as an Oakland Raider. Brown&#x27;s 2004 departure from the Raiders eventually became acrimonious, and the outspoken receiver often criticized Davis, senior assistant Michael Lombardi and coach Norv Turner publicly for conspiring to make him expendable. Former teammates Marcus Allen, Lincoln Kennedy and Chester McGlockton attended the press conference. For the Raiders, Amy Trask, the Raiders&#x27; chief executive officer who had Brown sign the ceremonial contract, Marc Badain, a finance executive and Mike Taylor, the team&#x27;s director of public relations, were on hand. At the time, Raiders receiver Jerry Porter was also in attendance. Lincoln Kennedy stuck up for the absence of Davis stating &quot;It&#x27;s not his style; he&#x27;ll probably invite Tim up to his office, or out to dinner later on. But this? This is not his style.&quot;

Recent history suggested that Davis was possibly out of touch with the football world prior to his death in 2011 because the Raiders had suffered through seven straight losing seasons (2003–2009) since losing to Tampa Bay in Super Bowl XXXVII. Brown disagreed, stating &quot;In a lot of peoples’ minds, Al is out of touch, but nothing is further from the truth. He is still quite lucid.&quot;

<text>Cantharellus cibarius (Latin: &quot;cantharellus&quot;, &quot;chanterelle&quot;; &quot;cibarius&quot;, &quot;culinary&quot;) is the golden chanterelle, the type species of the chanterelle genus &quot;Cantharellus&quot;. It is also known as girolle (or &quot;girole&quot;).

Despite its characteristic features, &quot;C. cibarius&quot; can be confused with species such as the poisonous &quot;Omphalotus illudens&quot;. The golden chanterelle is a commonly consumed and choice edible species.

== Taxonomy ==
At one time, all yellow or golden chanterelles in North America had been classified as &quot;Cantharellus cibarius&quot;. Using DNA analysis, they have since been shown to be a group of related species known as the &quot;Cantharellus cibarius&quot; group or species complex, with &quot;C. cibarius sensu stricto&quot; restricted to Europe. In 1997, &quot;C. formosus&quot; (the Pacific golden chanterelle) and &quot;C. cibarius&quot; var. &quot;roseocanus&quot; were identified, followed by &quot;C. cascadensis&quot; in 2003 and &quot;C. californicus&quot; in 2008. In 2018, an Asian species belonging to the &quot;C. cibarius&quot; complex has been described and sequenced, &quot;C. anzutake&quot;, recorded in Japan and Korea.

== Description ==
The mushroom is easy to detect and recognize in nature. The body is wide and tall. The color varies from yellow to dark yellow. Red spots will appear on the cap of the mushroom if it is damaged. Chanterelles have a faint aroma and flavor of apricots.

=== Similar species ===
The species can resemble the dangerously poisonous &quot;Omphalotus illudens&quot; (eastern jack-o&#x27;lantern) and &quot;Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca&quot; (the false chanterelle).

== Distribution and habitat ==
The species grows in Europe from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean Basin, mainly in deciduous and coniferous forests and typically from June to December.

==Uses==
A commonly eaten and favored mushroom, the chanterelle is typically harvested from late summer to late fall in its European distribution.

Chanterelles are used in many culinary dishes, and can be preserved by either drying or freezing. The use of an oven for drying is not recommended because it can make the mushroom bitter.

<doc id="854067" wikidata="Q6805022" url="?curid=854067" title="Medal examinations (dance)">
<text>In many forms of dance (ballet, ballroom dance, concert dance) medal examinations are held. They are organised by leading dance teaching organisations, such as the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing (ISTD), the International Dance Teachers Association (IDTA), and other organisations.

The examinations are a way for a young dancer to mark their progress in the art of dance. They have been extremely popular since their introduction in the early 1930s. They are not a form of professional qualification. Professional qualifications are also offered by the same organisations, and they are much more extensive and demanding.

During a medal test, a dancer will either dance alone (ballet) or be partnered by their teacher (ballroom). An examiner, appointed by the examining body, will observe the performance, and mark it.

It is usual for dance teacher organisations to print guidelines for the figures or routines to be tested. Figures, given a name, such as &#x27;whisk&#x27; or &#x27;spin turn&#x27;, are amalgamated into a routine.

The examining body prescribes a syllabus of figures from which the routines are formed. The syllabus and detailed instructions for performing the dances are published or specified by the examining body, and available for purchase as books or pamphlets. The instructor will have prepared an amalgamation of figures suitable for each level of medal.

The lower levels of examination generally consist mainly of basic figures, such as the natural turn in the Waltz, which demonstrate clear understanding of the technique of the dance in question. Higher levels will include more complex figures, but will usually also require at least some fundamentals, to demonstrate that the lower levels have been built upon. The standard of dance expected at tests goes up at each level.

Depending upon the level and style of the examination, a student might be asked to demonstrate anywhere from one to five different dances, all within one discipline, such as &#x27;Standard&#x27;, or &#x27;Latin American&#x27;. That is because medals are awarded within disciplines. For example, at Bronze level, a Latin American dance student might be asked to dance Cha-cha-cha, Samba and Rumba, whilst the same student would definitely be asked to dance all five International Latin dances at Gold level. A single dance will take up around 60 to 90 seconds; the entire exam, allowing for short breaks between routines, will be between five and ten minutes, depending on the number of dances. Typically, a studio will have a large number of candidates, all examined on the same day.

There is a separate set of tests for student dance teachers, which involves a) dancing b) explaining theory c) demonstrating the ability to teach, including the ability to demonstrate steps of both male and female partners. These are not medal tests, but are often adjudicated in a similar setting by the same examiners on the same day.

Poitevin–Saintongeais is officially recognised by the French Ministry of Culture as a language with two dialects: Poitevin and Saintongeais. The language belongs to the langues d&#x27;oïl subbranch of the Gallo-Romance languages.

Some descendants of Poitevin–Saintongeais speakers became the Acadian people of Atlantic Canada as well as the Cajun people of Louisiana.

The dialects of this language are peculiar to the historical regions and provinces of Poitou and Saintonge. It is classified as severely endangered by UNESCO.

<doc id="854081" wikidata="Q193119" url="?curid=854081" title="Regeneration (biology)">
<text>Regeneration in biology is the process of renewal, restoration, and tissue growth that makes genomes, cells, organisms, and ecosystems resilient to natural fluctuations or events that cause disturbance or damage. Every species is capable of regeneration, from bacteria to humans. Regeneration can either be complete where the new tissue is the same as the lost tissue, or incomplete after which the necrotic tissue becomes fibrotic.

At its most elementary level, regeneration is mediated by the molecular processes of gene regulation and involves the cellular processes of cell proliferation, morphogenesis and cell differentiation. Regeneration in biology, however, mainly refers to the morphogenic processes that characterize the phenotypic plasticity of traits allowing multi-cellular organisms to repair and maintain the integrity of their physiological and morphological states. Above the genetic level, regeneration is fundamentally regulated by asexual cellular processes. Regeneration is different from reproduction. For example, hydra perform regeneration but reproduce by the method of budding.

The regenerative process occurs in two multi-step phases: the preparation phase and the redevelopment phase. Regeneration begins with an amputation which triggers the first phase. Right after the amputation, migrating epidermal cells form a wound epithelium which thickens, through cell division, throughout the first phase to form a cap around the site of the wound. The cells underneath this cap then begin to rapidly divide and form a cone shaped end to the amputation known as a blastema. Included in the blastema are skin, muscle, and cartilage cells that de-differentiate and become similar to stem cells in that they can become multiple types of cells. Cells differentiate to the same purpose they originally filled meaning skin cells again become skin cells and muscle cells become muscles. These de-differentiated cells divide until enough cells are available at which point they differentiate again and the shape of the blastema begins to flatten out. It is at this point that the second phase begins, the redevelopment of the limb. In this stage, genes signal to the cells to differentiate themselves and the various parts of the limb are developed. The end result is a limb that looks and operates identically to the one that was lost, usually without any visual indication that the limb is newly generated.

The hydra and the planarian flatworm have long served as model organisms for their highly adaptive regenerative capabilities. Once wounded, their cells become activated and restore the organs back to their pre-existing state. The Caudata (&quot;urodeles&quot;; salamanders and newts), an order of tailed amphibians, is possibly the most adept vertebrate group at regeneration, given their capability of regenerating limbs, tails, jaws, eyes and a variety of internal structures. The regeneration of organs is a common and widespread adaptive capability among metazoan creatures. In a related context, some animals are able to reproduce asexually through fragmentation, budding, or fission. A planarian parent, for example, will constrict, split in the middle, and each half generates a new end to form two clones of the original.

Echinoderms (such as the sea star), crayfish, many reptiles, and amphibians exhibit remarkable examples of tissue regeneration. The case of autotomy, for example, serves as a defensive function as the animal detaches a limb or tail to avoid capture. After the limb or tail has been autotomized, cells move into action and the tissues will regenerate. In some cases a shed limb can itself regenerate a new individual. Limited regeneration of limbs occurs in most fishes and salamanders, and tail regeneration takes place in larval frogs and toads (but not adults). The whole limb of a salamander or a triton will grow repeatedly after amputation. In reptiles, chelonians, crocodilians and snakes are unable to regenerate lost parts, but many (not all) kinds of lizards, geckos and iguanas possess regeneration capacity in a high degree. Usually, it involves dropping a section of their tail and regenerating it as part of a defense mechanism. While escaping a predator, if the predator catches the tail, it will disconnect.

==Ecosystems==
Ecosystems can be regenerative. Following a disturbance, such as a fire or pest outbreak in a forest, pioneering species will occupy, compete for space, and establish themselves in the newly opened habitat. The new growth of seedlings and community assembly process is known as regeneration in ecology.

==Cellular molecular fundamentals==
Pattern formation in the morphogenesis of an animal is regulated by genetic induction factors that put cells to work after damage has occurred. Neural cells, for example, express growth-associated proteins, such as GAP-43, tubulin, actin, an array of novel neuropeptides, and cytokines that induce a cellular physiological response to regenerate from the damage. Many of the genes that are involved in the original development of tissues are reinitialized during the regenerative process. Cells in the primordia of zebrafish fins, for example, express four genes from the homeobox &quot;msx&quot; family during development and regeneration.

==Tissues==
&quot;Strategies include the rearrangement of pre-existing tissue, the use of adult somatic stem cells and the dedifferentiation and/or transdifferentiation of cells, and more than one mode can operate in different tissues of the same animal. All these strategies result in the re-establishment of appropriate tissue polarity, structure and form.&quot; During the developmental process, genes are activated that serve to modify the properties of cell as they differentiate into different tissues. Development and regeneration involves the coordination and organization of populations cells into a blastema, which is &quot;a mound of stem cells from which regeneration begins&quot;. Dedifferentiation of cells means that they lose their tissue-specific characteristics as tissues remodel during the regeneration process. This should not be confused with the transdifferentiation of cells which is when they lose their tissue-specific characteristics during the regeneration process, and then re-differentiate to a different kind of cell.

==In animals==

=== Arthropods ===
==== Limb regeneration ====
Many arthropods can regenerate limbs and other appendages following either injury or autotomy. Regeneration capacity is constrained by the developmental stage and ability to molt.

Crustaceans, which continually molt, can regenerate throughout their lifetimes. While molting cycles are generally hormonally regulated, limb amputation induces premature molting.

Hemimetabolous insects such as crickets can regenerate limbs as nymphs, before their final molt.

Holometabolous insects can regenerate appendages as larvae prior to the final molt and metamorphosis. Beetle larvae, for example, can regenerate amputated limbs. Fruit fly larvae do not have limbs but can regenerate their appendage primordia, imaginal discs. In both systems, the regrowth of the new tissue delays pupation.

Mechanisms underlying appendage limb regeneration in insects and crustaceans are highly conserved. During limb regeneration species in both taxa form a blastema that proliferates and grows to repattern the missing tissue.

==== Venom regeneration ====
Arachnids, including scorpions, are known to regenerate their venom, although the content of the regenerated venom is different from the original venom during its regeneration, as the venom volume is replaced before the active proteins are all replenished.

==== Fruit fly model ====
The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a useful model organism to understand the molecular mechanisms that control regeneration, especially gut and germline regeneration. In these tissues, resident stem cells continually renew lost cells. The Hippo signaling pathway was discovered in flies and was found to be required for midgut regeneration. Later, this conserved signaling pathway was also found to be essential for regeneration of many mammalian tissues, including heart, liver, skin, and lung, and intestine.

===Annelids===

Many annelids (segmented worms) are capable of regeneration. For example, &quot;Chaetopterus variopedatus&quot; and &quot;Branchiomma nigromaculata&quot; can regenerate both anterior and posterior body parts after latitudinal bisection. The relationship between somatic and germline stem cell regeneration has been studied at the molecular level in the annelid &quot;Capitella teleta&quot;. Leeches, however, appear incapable of segmental regeneration. Furthermore, their close relatives, the branchiobdellids, are also incapable of segmental regeneration. However, certain individuals, like the lumbriculids, can regenerate from only a few segments. Segmental regeneration in these animals is epimorphic and occurs through blastema formation. Segmental regeneration has been gained and lost during annelid evolution, as seen in oligochaetes, where head regeneration has been lost three separate times.

Along with epimorphosis, some polychaetes like &quot;Sabella pavonina&quot; experience morphallactic regeneration. Morphallaxis involves the de-differentiation, transformation, and re-differentation of cells to regenerate tissues. How prominent morphallactic regeneration is in oligochaetes is currently not well understood. Although relatively under-reported, it is possible that morphallaxis is a common mode of inter-segment regeneration in annelids. Following regeneration in &quot;L. variegatus&quot;, past posterior segments sometimes become anterior in the new body orientation, consistent with morphallaxis.

Following amputation, most annelids are capable of sealing their body via rapid muscular contraction. Constriction of body muscle can lead to infection prevention. In certain species, such as &quot;Limnodrilus&quot;, autolysis can be seen within hours after amputation in the ectoderm and mesoderm. Amputation is also thought to cause a large migration of cells to the injury site, and these form a wound plug.

===Echinoderms===

Tissue regeneration is widespread among echinoderms and has been well documented in starfish &quot;(Asteroidea)&quot;, sea cucumbers &quot;(Holothuroidea)&quot;, and sea urchins &quot;(Echinoidea).&quot; Appendage regeneration in echinoderms has been studied since at least the 19th century. In addition to appendages, some species can regenerate internal organs and parts of their central nervous system. In response to injury starfish can autotomize damaged appendages. Autotomy is the self-amputation of a body part, usually an appendage.  Depending on severity, starfish will then go through a four-week process where the appendage will be regenerated. Some species must retain mouth cells to regenerate an appendage, due to the need for energy. The first organs to regenerate, in all species documented to date, are associated with the digestive tract. Thus, most knowledge about visceral regeneration in holothurians concerns this system.

===Planaria (Platyhelminthes)===

Regeneration research using Planarians began in the late 1800s and was popularized by T.H. Morgan at the beginning of the 20th century. Alejandro Sanchez-Alvarado and Philip Newmark transformed planarians into a model genetic organism in the beginning of the 20th century to study the molecular mechanisms underlying regeneration in these animals. Planarians exhibit an extraordinary ability to regenerate lost body parts. For example, a planarian split lengthwise or crosswise will regenerate into two separate individuals. In one experiment, T.H. Morgan found that a piece corresponding to 1/279th of a planarian or a fragment with as few as 10,000 cells can successfully regenerate into a new worm within one to two weeks. After amputation, stump cells form a blastema formed from neoblasts, pluripotent cells found throughout the planarian body. New tissue grows from neoblasts with neoblasts comprising between 20 and 30% of all planarian cells. Recent work has confirmed that neoblasts are totipotent since one single neoblast can regenerate an entire irradiated animal that has been rendered incapable of regeneration. In order to prevent starvation a planarian will use their own cells for energy, this phenomenon is known as de-growth.

===Amphibians===
Limb regeneration in the axolotl and newt has been extensively studied and researched. The nineteenth century studies of this subject are reviewed in Holland (2021). Urodele amphibians, such as salamanders and newts, display the highest regenerative ability among tetrapods. As such, they can fully regenerate their limbs, tail, jaws, and retina via epimorphic regeneration leading to functional replacement with new tissue. Salamander limb regeneration occurs in two main steps. First, the local cells dedifferentiate at the wound site into progenitor to form a blastema. Second, the blastemal cells will undergo cell proliferation, patterning, cell differentiation and tissue growth using similar genetic mechanisms that deployed during embryonic development. Ultimately, blastemal cells will generate all the cells for the new structure.
After amputation, the epidermis migrates to cover the stump in 1–2 hours, forming a structure called the wound epithelium (WE). Epidermal cells continue to migrate over the WE, resulting in a thickened, specialized signaling center called the apical epithelial cap (AEC). Over the next several days there are changes in the underlying stump tissues that result in the formation of a blastema (a mass of dedifferentiated proliferating cells). As the blastema forms, pattern formation genes – such as HoxA and HoxD – are activated as they were when the limb was formed in the embryo. The positional identity of the distal tip of the limb (i.e. the autopod, which is the hand or foot) is formed first in the blastema. Intermediate positional identities between the stump and the distal tip are then filled in through a process called intercalation. Motor neurons, muscle, and blood vessels grow with the regenerated limb, and reestablish the connections that were present prior to amputation. The time that this entire process takes varies according to the age of the animal, ranging from about a month to around three months in the adult and then the limb becomes fully functional. Researchers at Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute at Monash University have published that when macrophages, which eat up material debris, were removed, salamanders lost their ability to regenerate and formed scarred tissue instead. The axolotl salamander &quot;Ambystoma mexicanum&quot;, an organism with exceptional limb regenerative capabilities, likely undergoes epigenetic alterations in its blastema cells that enhance expression of genes involved in limb regeneration. The Axolotl has very little blood and has an excess of epidermal cells. This allows the affected area to then flourish with epidermal cells and continued gene expression allows the area to regenerate to its natural being.

In spite of the historically few researchers studying limb regeneration, remarkable progress has been made recently in establishing the neotenous amphibian the axolotl (&quot;Ambystoma mexicanum&quot;) as a model genetic organism. This progress has been facilitated by advances in genomics, bioinformatics, and somatic cell transgenesis in other fields, that have created the opportunity to investigate the mechanisms of important biological properties, such as limb regeneration, in the axolotl. The Ambystoma Genetic Stock Center (AGSC) is a self-sustaining, breeding colony of the axolotl supported by the National Science Foundation as a Living Stock Collection. Located at the University of Kentucky, the AGSC is dedicated to supplying genetically well-characterized axolotl embryos, larvae, and adults to laboratories throughout the United States and abroad. An NIH-funded NCRR grant has led to the establishment of the Ambystoma EST database, the Salamander Genome Project (SGP) that has led to the creation of the first amphibian gene map and several annotated molecular data bases, and the creation of the research community web portal. In 2022, a first spatiotemporal map revealed key insights about axolotl brain regeneration, also providing the interactive &quot;Axolotl Regenerative Telencephalon Interpretation via Spatiotemporal Transcriptomic Atlas&quot;.

==== Frog model ====

Anurans (frogs) can only regenerate their limbs during embryonic development. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) appear to be required for a regeneration response in the anuran larvae. ROS production is essential to activate the Wnt signaling pathway, which has been associated with regeneration in other systems.

Once the limb skeleton has developed in frogs, regeneration does not occur (&quot;Xenopus&quot; can grow a cartilaginous spike after amputation). The adult &quot;Xenopus laevis&quot; is used as a model organism for regenerative medicine. In 2022, a cocktail of drugs and hormones (1,4-DPCA, BDNF, growth hormone, resolvin D5, and retinoic acid), in a single dose lasting 24 hours, was shown to trigger long-term leg regeneration in adult &quot;X. laevis&quot;. Instead of a single spike, a paddle-shaped growth is obtained at the end of the limb by 18 months.

=== Hydra ===
&quot;Hydra&quot; is a genus of freshwater polyp in the phylum Cnidaria with highly proliferative stem cells that gives them the ability to regenerate their entire body. Any fragment larger than a few hundred epithelial cells that is isolated from the body has the ability to regenerate into a smaller version of itself. The high proportion of stem cells in the hydra supports its efficient regenerative ability.

Regeneration among hydra occurs as foot regeneration arising from the basal part of the body, and head regeneration, arising from the apical region. Regeneration tissues that are cut from the gastric region contain polarity, which allows them to distinguish between regenerating a head in the apical end and a foot in the basal end so that both regions are present in the newly regenerated organism. Head regeneration requires complex reconstruction of the area, while foot regeneration is much simpler, similar to tissue repair. In both foot and head regeneration, however, there are two distinct molecular cascades that occur once the tissue is wounded: early injury response and a subsequent, signal-driven pathway of the regenerating tissue that leads to cellular differentiation. This early-injury response includes epithelial cell stretching for wound closure, the migration of interstitial progenitors towards the wound, cell death, phagocytosis of cell debris, and reconstruction of the extracellular matrix.

Regeneration in hydra has been defined as morphallaxis, the process where regeneration results from remodeling of existing material without cellular proliferation. If a hydra is cut into two pieces, the remaining severed sections form two fully functional and independent hydra, approximately the same size as the two smaller severed sections. This occurs through the exchange and rearrangement of soft tissues without the formation of new material.

During Hydra head regeneration there are coordinated gene expression and chromatin regulation changes. An enhancer is a short DNA sequence (50–1500 base pairs) that can be bound by transcription factors to increase the transcription of a particular gene. In the enhancer regions that are activated during head regeneration, a set of transcription factor motifs commonly occur that appear to facilitate coordinated gene expression.

===Aves (birds)===

Owing to a limited literature on the subject, birds are believed to have very limited regenerative abilities as adults. Some studies on roosters have suggested that birds can adequately regenerate some parts of the limbs and depending on the conditions in which regeneration takes place, such as age of the animal, the inter-relationship of the injured tissue with other muscles, and the type of operation, can involve complete regeneration of some musculoskeletal structure. Werber and Goldschmidt (1909) found that the goose and duck were capable of regenerating their beaks after partial amputation and Sidorova (1962) observed liver regeneration via hypertrophy in roosters. Birds are also capable of regenerating the hair cells in their cochlea following noise damage or ototoxic drug damage. Despite this evidence, contemporary studies suggest reparative regeneration in avian species is limited to periods during embryonic development. An array of molecular biology techniques have been successful in manipulating cellular pathways known to contribute to spontaneous regeneration in chick embryos. For instance, removing a portion of the elbow joint in a chick embryo via window excision or slice excision and comparing joint tissue specific markers and cartilage markers showed that window excision allowed 10 out of 20 limbs to regenerate and expressed joint genes similarly to a developing embryo. In contrast, slice excision did not allow the joint to regenerate due to the fusion of the skeletal elements seen by an expression of cartilage markers.

Similar to the physiological regeneration of hair in mammals, birds can regenerate their feathers in order to repair damaged feathers or to attract mates with their plumage. Typically, seasonal changes that are associated with breeding seasons will prompt a hormonal signal for birds to begin regenerating feathers. This has been experimentally induced using thyroid hormones in the Rhode Island Red Fowls.

===Mammals===

Mammals are capable of cellular and physiological regeneration, but have generally poor reparative regenerative ability across the group. Examples of physiological regeneration in mammals include epithelial renewal (e.g., skin and intestinal tract), red blood cell replacement, antler regeneration and hair cycling. Male deer lose their antlers annually during the months of January to April then through regeneration are able to regrow them as an example of physiological regeneration. A deer antler is the only appendage of a mammal that can be regrown every year. While reparative regeneration is a rare phenomenon in mammals, it does occur. A well-documented example is regeneration of the digit tip distal to the nail bed. Reparative regeneration has also been observed in rabbits, pikas and African spiny mice. In 2012, researchers discovered that two species of African spiny mice, &quot;Acomys kempi&quot; and &quot;Acomys percivali&quot;, were capable of completely regenerating the autotomically released or otherwise damaged tissue. These species can regrow hair follicles, skin, sweat glands, fur and cartilage. In addition to these two species, subsequent studies demonstrated that &quot;Acomys cahirinus&quot; could regenerate skin and excised tissue in the ear pinna.

Despite these examples, it is generally accepted that adult mammals have limited regenerative capacity compared to most vertebrate embryos/larvae, adult salamanders and fish. But the regeneration therapy approach of Robert O. Becker, using electrical stimulation, has shown promising results for rats and mammals in general.

Some researchers have also claimed that the MRL mouse strain exhibits enhanced regenerative abilities. Work comparing the differential gene expression of scarless healing MRL mice and a poorly-healing C57BL/6 mouse strain, identified 36 genes differentiating the healing process between MRL mice and other mice. Study of the regenerative process in these animals is aimed at discovering how to duplicate them in humans, such as deactivation of the p21 gene. However, recent work has shown that MRL mice actually close small ear holes with scar tissue, rather than regeneration as originally claimed.

MRL mice are not protected against myocardial infarction; heart regeneration in adult mammals (neocardiogenesis) is limited, because heart muscle cells are nearly all terminally differentiated. MRL mice show the same amount of cardiac injury and scar formation as normal mice after a heart attack. However, recent studies provide evidence that this may not always be the case, and that MRL mice can regenerate after heart damage.

====Humans====
The regrowth of lost tissues or organs in the human body is being researched. Some tissues such as skin regrow quite readily; others have been thought to have little or no capacity for regeneration, but ongoing research suggests that there is some hope for a variety of tissues and organs. Human organs that have been regenerated include the bladder, vagina and the penis.

As are all metazoans, humans are capable of physiological regeneration (i.e. the replacement of cells during homeostatic maintenance that does not necessitate injury). For example, the regeneration of red blood cells via erythropoiesis occurs through the maturation of erythrocytes from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, their subsequent circulation for around 90 days in the blood stream, and their eventual cell-death in the spleen. Another example of physiological regeneration is the sloughing and rebuilding of a functional endometrium during each menstrual cycle in females in response to varying levels of circulating estrogen and progesterone.

However, humans are limited in their capacity for reparative regeneration, which occurs in response to injury. One of the most studied regenerative responses in humans is the hypertrophy of the liver following liver injury. For example, the original mass of the liver is re-established in direct proportion to the amount of liver removed following partial hepatectomy, which indicates that signals from the body regulate liver mass precisely, both positively and negatively, until the desired mass is reached. This response is considered cellular regeneration (a form of compensatory hypertrophy) where the function and mass of the liver is regenerated through the proliferation of existing mature hepatic cells (mainly hepatocytes), but the exact morphology of the liver is not regained. This process is driven by growth factor and cytokine regulated pathways. The normal sequence of inflammation and regeneration does not function accurately in cancer. Specifically, cytokine stimulation of cells leads to expression of genes that change cellular functions and suppress the immune response.

Adult neurogenesis is also a form of cellular regeneration. For example, hippocampal neuron renewal occurs in normal adult humans at an annual turnover rate of 1.75% of neurons. Cardiac myocyte renewal has been found to occur in normal adult humans, and at a higher rate in adults following acute heart injury such as infarction. Even in adult myocardium following infarction, proliferation is only found in around 1% of myocytes around the area of injury, which is not enough to restore function of cardiac muscle. However, this may be an important target for regenerative medicine as it implies that regeneration of cardiomyocytes, and consequently of myocardium, can be induced.

Another example of reparative regeneration in humans is fingertip regeneration, which occurs after phalanx amputation distal to the nail bed (especially in children) and rib regeneration, which occurs following osteotomy for scoliosis treatment (though usually regeneration is only partial and may take up to one year).

Yet another example of regeneration in humans is vas deferens regeneration, which occurs after a vasectomy and which results in vasectomy failure.

=== Reptiles ===
The ability and degree of regeneration in reptiles differs among the various species (see ), but the most notable and well-studied occurrence is tail-regeneration in lizards. In addition to lizards, regeneration has been observed in the tails and maxillary bone of crocodiles and adult neurogenesis has also been noted. Tail regeneration has never been observed in snakes, but see. Lizards possess the highest regenerative capacity as a group. Following autotomous tail loss, epimorphic regeneration of a new tail proceeds through a blastema-mediated process that results in a functionally and morphologically similar structure.

=== Chondrichthyes ===
It has been estimated that the average shark loses about 30,000 to 40,000 teeth in a lifetime. Leopard sharks routinely replace their teeth every 9–12 days and this is an example of physiological regeneration. This can occur because shark teeth are not attached to a bone, but instead are developed within a bony cavity.

Rhodopsin regeneration has been studied in skates and rays. After complete photo-bleaching, rhodopsin can completely regenerate within 2 hours in the retina.

White bamboo sharks can regenerate at least two-thirds of their liver and this has been linked to three micro RNAs, xtr-miR-125b, fru-miR-204, and has-miR-142-3p_R-. In one study, two-thirds of the liver was removed and within 24 hours more than half of the liver had undergone hypertrophy.

Some sharks can regenerate scales and even skin following damage. Within two weeks of skin wounding, mucus is secreted into the wound and this initiates the healing process. One study showed that the majority of the wounded area was regenerated within 4 months, but the regenerated area also showed a high degree of variability.

<text>Lori Kay Soares Hacking (December 31, 1976 – July 19, 2004) was a teacher who was murdered by her husband Mark Douglas Hacking in 2004 in Salt Lake City, Utah. She was reported missing by her husband, and the search gained national attention before her husband confessed to the crime.

==Biography==
Lori was the adopted daughter of Thelma and Eraldo Soares, formerly of Fullerton, California. Eraldo Soares was a Spanish and Portuguese teacher at Sunny Hills High School and was a native of Piracicaba, Brazil. He met Thelma when they both served as missionaries for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Rio de Janeiro. Lori&#x27;s parents divorced in 1987, and Thelma and Lori moved to Orem, Utah the following year. Lori and Mark both attended Orem High School, about 40 miles (about 64 kilometers) south of Salt Lake City.

===Disappearance===
At 10:49 a.m. on July 19, 2004, Mark Hacking called 911 to report his wife Lori missing. She was 27 years old at the time. Mark told police she had left home early for a customary jog in the Memory Grove and City Creek Canyon area northeast of downtown Salt Lake City, but had not returned home or arrived at work. A woman said she had seen Lori near the grove that day, but later withdrew her claim.

According to family members, Hacking was about five weeks pregnant when she vanished. She was planning a move to North Carolina, where her husband had said he was about to start medical school at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. However, police say Mark had lied to friends and family about his academic accomplishments and had never actually completed an undergraduate degree at the University of Utah. The medical school had no record of his having applied.

Shortly after his wife&#x27;s disappearance, Mark was found running naked through the streets, and was admitted to hospital for mental evaluation. While in the hospital, Mark engaged D. Gilbert Athay, a prominent defense attorney in the community.

===Mark Hacking arrested===
On August 2, 2004, Mark was arrested on suspicion of the aggravated murder of his wife. Police said they believed that he acted alone, killing Lori in their apartment with a .22-caliber rifle while she was asleep and disposing of her body in a dumpster. 

Investigators found blood in several places in the couple&#x27;s apartment, including on a knife found in the bedroom, on the headboard of the bed, and in Lori&#x27;s car. 

In addition, Scott and Lance Hacking, Mark&#x27;s brothers, claimed that Mark confessed to murdering his wife after they confronted him on July 24, 2004. First-degree murder charges were filed against Mark Hacking on August 9, 2004.

On October 1, 2004 at approximately 8:20 a.m. searchers found human remains in the Salt Lake County landfill. By that afternoon, police had confirmed that the remains were those of Lori Hacking. Searchers found the carpet that Mark admitted to rolling her body into before placing it in the dumpster. 

On October 29, 2004, Mark pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder despite pleas from Paul Soares, the victim&#x27;s brother, to &quot;save your family the grief and cost [and] plead guilty to murder.&quot;

According to investigators, on the night of July 18, Lori wrote Mark a note telling him that she planned to leave him after discovering that virtually everything Mark had told her about his background was false. She had learned that he never graduated from the University of Utah and never applied to medical school. Rather than divorce, Hacking killed her.

===Guilty plea===

On April 15, 2005, Hacking pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in exchange for prosecutors dropping other charges. On June 6, 2005, Hacking was sentenced to six years to life in prison, the maximum possible sentence under Utah law at the time. In Utah, prison sentences are indeterminate, with a minimum and maximum time frame. The offender must serve the entire sentence unless the Utah Board of Pardons releases him sooner. Normally, those convicted of first-degree murder were required to serve a minimum of five years before they can be considered for parole. However, because Hacking killed Lori with a firearm, the minimum was increased by one year.

In July 2005, the Utah Board of Pardons declared that Mark Hacking would not be considered for parole until at least 2035, meaning that Hacking will have to serve a minimum of 30 years in prison. Board chairman Mike Sibbett stressed that a hearing was not a guarantee of a release date. He stated that there were a number of aggravating factors in Hacking&#x27;s case that merited a later date. He stressed that Hacking obstructed justice by disposing of Lori&#x27;s body and falsely claiming she was missing. Upon hearing this news, Lori&#x27;s mother Thelma Soares issued this statement: &quot;While it is a terrible waste of his life, [the decision] lifts a great burden from my mind and heart. The six-year minimum imposed by law is an insult not only to Lori and the baby, but to me and my family as well. I thank the members of the State Board of Pardons and Parole for their diligence and sense of justice in dealing with this tragic case. My faith in our justice system has been upheld.&quot;

===Afterward===
The Soares family removed the name Hacking from Lori&#x27;s headstone. &quot;We just felt that Mark obviously didn&#x27;t want her anymore&quot;, said her mother. Lori&#x27;s married name was replaced with the Portuguese word , which translates to &quot;little daughter.&quot;

The initial sentence caused a widespread public outcry, with many expressing alarm at the possibility Hacking could be released after six years. Sibbett noted that most inmates convicted of murder have to wait between 18 and 35 years for a parole hearing, and Hacking&#x27;s actions pushed it to &quot;the higher level&quot; of the spectrum. According to the &quot;Deseret News,&quot; the great majority of inmates convicted of murder serve far more than the five-year minimum, and it is unheard of for a convicted murderer to serve less than 15 years. Several are denied parole and forced to wait 22 years for another hearing, while others receive parole dates that require them to serve an average of 20 more years before being released. A few have been ordered to spend the rest of their lives in prison. Nonetheless, Paul Boyden, the executive director of the Utah Statewide Association of Prosecutors, urged the Utah Sentencing Commission to raise the minimum sentence for first-degree murder to 15 years. Boyden said most people didn&#x27;t understand Utah&#x27;s indeterminate sentencing scheme and added that it caused &quot;a public perception problem&quot; for the state. State sentencing commission member Sy Snarr agreed, saying that it was &quot;appalling&quot; that Hacking even theoretically had a minimum six-year sentence. On March 20, 2006, Utah House Bill 102, also known as &quot;Lori&#x27;s Law&quot;, was signed into law. It stipulates that people convicted of first-degree murder in Utah must serve at least 15 years before they can be considered for parole.

On June 6, 2005, Mark Hacking&#x27;s father read a statement from his family that he said would be their final statement to the press about the murder. The statement clarified several events leading to Mark&#x27;s confession and conviction. The statement ended by quoting Mark: 

&quot;I know prison is where I need to be. I will spend my time there doing all I can to right the many wrongs I have done, though I realize complete atonement is impossible in this life. I have a lot of healing and changing to do, but I hope that some day I can become the man Lori always thought I was. To the many people I have hurt, I am more sorry than you could ever know. Every day my soul burns in torment when I think of what you must be going through. I wish I could take away your pain. I wish I could take back all the lies I have told and replace them with the truth. I wish I could put Lori back into your arms. My pain is deserved; yours is not. From the bottom of my heart, I beg for your forgiveness. There is no such thing as a harmless lie no matter how small it is. You may think a lie only hurts the liar, but this is far from the truth. If you are traveling a path of lies, please stop now and face the consequences. Whatever those consequences, they will be better than the pain you are causing yourself and others.&quot;

In June 2006, prison officials in Utah discovered that Hacking was selling personal items, including autographs, a hand tracing, various prison forms, and magazines, on an online site called Murder Auction. Officials later announced that Hacking had agreed to discontinue selling anything online.

Hacking, Utah Department of Corrections offender number 167809, is incarcerated at Central Utah Correctional Facility in Gunnison, Utah.

<text>Lorrain, also known as Lorrain roman, is a &quot;langue d&#x27;oïl&quot; spoken by a minority of people in the region of Lorraine in northeastern France, as well as in some parts of Alsace and Gaume in Belgium. While often referred to as a &quot;patois,&quot; this term is considered pejorative and outdated by linguists.

It is a regional language of France. In Wallonia, it is known as Gaumais and enjoys official recognition as a regional language. It has been influenced by Lorraine Franconian and Luxembourgish, West Central German languages spoken in nearby or overlapping areas.

== Features ==
Linguist Stephanie Russo noted the difference of a &#x27;second&#x27; imperfect and pluperfect tense between Lorrain and Standard French. It is derived from Latin grammar that is no longer used in modern French.

== Variations ==
The Linguasphere Observatory distinguishes seven variants :

* Argonnais (Argonne, Woëvre, eastern French Ardennes, Meuse, Meurthe-et-Moselle)
* Longovician (Longwy, Longuyon, northern Meurthe-et-Moselle)
* Gaumais (arrondissement of Virton, cantons of Montmédy and Stenay in Meuse and the canton of Carignan in Ardennes)
* Messin (Metz, Metzgau and all of French-speaking Moselle)
* Nancéien (Nancy, southern Meurthe-et-Moselle)
* Spinalian (Épinal, central Vosges)
* Deodatian (Saint-Dié, Hautes-Vosges)

After 1870, members of the Stanislas Academy in Nancy noted 132 variants of Lorrain from Thionville in the north to Rupt-sur-Moselle in the south, which means that main variants have sub-variants.

<text>The words theoconservatism and theocon are portmanteaus of &quot;theocracy&quot; and &quot;conservatism&quot;/&quot;conservative&quot; coined as variants of &quot;neoconservatism&quot; and &quot;neocon&quot;. They have been used as labels, sometimes pejorative, referring to members of the Christian right, particularly those whose ideology represents a synthesis of elements of American conservatism, conservative Christianity, and social conservatism, expressed through political means. The term &quot;theocon&quot; first appeared in 1996 in an article in &quot;The New Republic&quot; entitled &quot;Neocon v. Theocon&quot; by Jacob Heilbrunn, where he wrote:
[T]he neoconservatives believe that America is special because it was founded on an idea—a commitment to the rights of man embodied in the Declaration of Independence—not in ethnic or religious affiliations. The &quot;theocons&quot;, too, argue that America is rooted in an idea, but they believe that idea is Christianity.

Mainstream media have used the terms to identify religious conservatives. Journalist Andrew Sullivan has commonly used the concept, as have political cartoonists Cox &amp; Forkum in reference to former Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris.

<doc id="854089" wikidata="Q514710" url="?curid=854089" title="Rich Gannon">
<text>Richard Joseph Gannon (born December 20, 1965) is an American former professional football quarterback who played 17 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). Subsequently, he was a sports commentator with CBS Sports for 16 years.

Gannon was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and played college football at the University of Delaware where he directed coach Tubby Raymond&#x27;s Wing-T offense. He recorded at least 2,000 offensive yards for three straight seasons at Delaware and was Yankee Conference Offensive Player of the Year as a senior. In the 1987 NFL draft, the New England Patriots selected Gannon in the fourth round intent upon converting Gannon to running back. He was soon traded to the Minnesota Vikings and would play with the Vikings until 1992. Gannon began his career as a backup for Wade Wilson. Gannon started his first games in 1990 in relief of an injured Wilson and would start many games in 1991. In 1992, he formally became the starting quarterback for the Vikings and led the Vikings to an 11–5 season and the playoffs after two consecutive losing seasons.

Gannon played for the Washington Redskins in 1993, the Kansas City Chiefs from 1995 to 1998, and the Oakland Raiders from 1999 to 2004. With the Raiders, he achieved his greatest successes, including four consecutive seasons making the Pro Bowl (1999–2002), three consecutive postseason appearances for the Raiders (2000–2002), two All-Pro selections (2000, 2002), one MVP, and an appearance in Super Bowl XXXVII. However, Gannon spent much of his final two seasons (2003 and 2004) with injuries, and the Raiders had losing records in those seasons. After retiring from football before the 2005 season, Gannon began a career in sports broadcasting. He served as a sports analyst for &quot;NFL on CBS&quot; through the 2020 NFL season.

==Early life==
Gannon attended Saint Joseph&#x27;s Preparatory School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and won three varsity letters each in football and crew and twice in basketball. In his senior season, he earned first team All-City as a punter and quarterback, passing for 1,567 yards.

==College career==
Gannon attended the University of Delaware where he was a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon. In football, he was coached by Tubby Raymond and played within Raymond&#x27;s wing T offense. With the Delaware Fightin&#x27; Blue Hens football team, Gannon first played as a punter before switching to quarterback in his sophomore year. Gannon set 21 school records, including total offense (7,432 yards), passing yards (5,927), pass attempts (845), and completions (462) and was the only Delaware player at the time to achieve at least 2,000 yards of offense three years in a row. As a sophomore, Gannon won the Eastern College Athletic Conference Division I-AA Rookie of the Year award in 1984. In 1986, during his senior season, Gannon won Yankee Conference Offensive Player of the Year honors and was an honorable mention All-American selection.

When he led the Raiders to Super Bowl XXXVII in 2003, he was the second player from the University of Delaware to go to the Super Bowl.

=== College statistics ===
==Professional career==
===Minnesota Vikings===

====1987====
Gannon was selected in the fourth round (98th overall) of the 1987 NFL draft by the New England Patriots, who envisioned converting him to a running back, defensive back, or wide receiver. Gannon balked at the idea, and he was quickly traded to the Minnesota Vikings. Gannon began his career with the Vikings as a backup to starting quarterback Wade Wilson. Gannon played four regular and one postseason games in his rookie season of 1987 and accumulated statistics in the Week 10 (November 22) game, a 24–13 victory over the Atlanta Falcons where he completed 2 of 6 passes for 18 yards. Despite the Vikings finishing just above .500 on the season at 8–7, they unexpectedly won their first two postseason games, though Gannon was lightly used in the playoffs, rushing for 3 yards in the Vikings&#x27; Wild Card game, a 44–10 win over the New Orleans Saints on the road. That game was the first playoff game in Saints team history. The Cinderella Vikings eventually lost the NFC championship game to the eventual Super Bowl XXII champion Washington Redskins.

====1988====
For the 1988 season, Gannon was third-string after Wade Wilson and Tommy Kramer. Gannon played three games in 1988. In a Week 5 (October 2) 24–7 loss to the Miami Dolphins, Gannon completed 7 of 15 passes for 90 yards but was sacked twice for 15. He also rushed twice for 15 yards. Gannon took a knee in the Vikings&#x27; Week 8 (October 23) victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In Week 10 (November 6), Gannon was sacked for 7 yards and rushed for 15 yards in a 44–17 win over the Detroit Lions. Improving from 1987, the 1988 Vikings finished 11–5 and advanced to the divisional round of the playoffs.

====1989====
Gannon did not play at all during the regular season, during which the Vikings went 10–6. In the Vikings&#x27; postseason divisional playoff game, a 41–13 loss to the San Francisco 49ers, the Vikings used all three quarterbacks (Wilson, Kramer, and Gannon), and Gannon was 13 of 18 passing for 144 yards and 1 interception. He rushed for 7 yards and was sacked twice for a total 20 yards.

====1990====
Gannon started his first game in Week 4 (September 30) of 1990 after Wade Wilson had torn thumb ligaments. The Vikings lost that game to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in overtime 23–20. Steve Christie kicked the winning field goal for Tampa in a drive started from a Wayne Haddix interception of a Gannon pass. Gannon would play 14 games in 1990 and start 12.

Gannon won his first career start in Week 9 (November 4) with a 27–22 win over the Denver Broncos. John Elway, starting quarterback for the Broncos, left the game due to injury after building a 16–0 first-half lead for Denver. Gannon made the winning touchdown drive on a 56-yard trick play pass: first to Herschel Walker, who pitched back to Gannon, who made a deep pass to Anthony Carter for the touchdown. Minnesota won despite Gannon completing less than half of his passes (6-for-13) and being sacked 7 times. The following week against the Detroit Lions, Gannon rushed for a one-yard touchdown and passed for 147 yards completing 12 of 17 passes as the Vikings won 17–7. These games began a five-game winning streak for Minnesota after a 1–6 start. However, the Vikings would finish 6–10 after losing the last four games of the year. For the season, he was 182 of 349 passing for 2,278 yards, 16 touchdowns, and 16 interceptions. He was sacked 34 times and rushed 52 times for 268 yards.

====1991====
In the 1991 preseason, Vikings coach Jerry Burns demoted Gannon to third-string and elevated Sean Salisbury to second-string behind Wade Wilson. Gannon played his first game of the year in Week 5 (September 29) against the Denver Broncos, replacing Wade Wilson with 7:20 left in the fourth quarter after Wilson threw three interceptions. On fourth down at Denver&#x27;s 13-yard line with 43 seconds left, a wide-open Hassan Jones dropped Gannon&#x27;s pass, and Minnesota lost 13–6. Gannon would replace Wilson as starter for the last 11 games of 1991, and the Vikings went 6–5 with Gannon as starter for an overall 8–8 season. Gannon was 211 of 354 in completed passes for 2,166 yards, 12 touchdowns, and 6 interceptions. He was sacked 19 times for 91 yards and rushed 43 times for 236 yards, including two rushing touchdowns.

====1992====
Competing with Sean Salisbury for the starting job, Gannon ultimately became the Vikings&#x27; starting quarterback for 1992. In the final exhibition game of 1992, and with first-year coach Dennis Green, he led the Vikings to a 30–0 defeat of defending Super Bowl champions Washington Redskins in the Redskins&#x27; home field, completing 14 of 21 passes for 124 yards and three touchdowns.

In the fourth quarter of the Week 5 (October 4) home game against the Chicago Bears, Gannon led a Vikings rally from a 20–0 deficit to a 21–20 victory. Following a touchdown off an interception by Todd Scott, Gannon led a touchdown drive with four consecutive passes, the last one to Cris Carter in the end zone. With 6:40 left in the fourth quarter, Gannon led a 78-yard touchdown drive that included the Vikings&#x27; seventh straight first-down play of the game. The drive began with Gannon handing off to running back Terry Allen for a 21-yard rush, followed by a 22-yard rush by Roger Craig, who would make the tying 1-yard touchdown run, followed by the winning extra point kick.

In Week 7 (October 15), Gannon started against the Detroit Lions and completed 8 of 10 passes for 146 yards and two touchdowns for a 24–0 lead. Salisbury took over in the second quarter after Gannon suffered a hyperextended left knee, and the Vikings beat the Lions 31–14. The Vikings now were a surprising 5–1 after going a combined 14–18 in the 1990 and 1991 seasons.

With Minnesota leading the NFC Central with an 8–3 record, Dennis Green benched Gannon in favor of Salisbury following the Week 12 (November 23) win over the Cleveland Browns.

===Washington Redskins===

====1993====
On August 19, 1993, the Vikings traded Gannon to the Washington Redskins for a conditional 1994 fifth-round draft pick. Gannon was the third-stringer behind starter Mark Rypien and backup Cary Conklin. With the Redskins, Gannon played in eight games and started the four games from Weeks 12 to 15.

Gannon played his first game of 1993 in Week 5 (October 4), a Monday night game, taking over for Cary Conklin against the Miami Dolphins and Dan Marino. Gannon could only lead one touchdown drive that brought Washington within a 14–10 deficit behind Miami. With 59 seconds left, Gannon threw an interception to the Dolphins&#x27; Troy Vincent to seal the Dolphins&#x27; 17–10 victory. Gannon injured his foot during the game. However, Gannon would play in limited roles in Weeks 6 and 7. After a 2–7 start, Redskins coach Richie Petitbon announced he would bench Mark Rypien and start Rich Gannon once Gannon recovered from the injury.

In Week 12 (November 21) against the Los Angeles Rams, Gannon completed 24 of 39 passes for 170 yards, was sacked three times for 11 yards, and rushed twice for 18 yards. With Los Angeles leading 10–6 and 3:10 left in the game, Gannon missed an opportunity for a game-winning drive. At the Rams&#x27; 27, Gannon&#x27;s 23-yard pass intended for Art Monk bounced off Rams safety Anthony Newman&#x27;s hands and into Michael Stewart&#x27;s hands for an interception, sealing the victory for the Rams.

The following week (November 28), Gannon threw two touchdown passes in the fourth quarter to give the Redskins a 14–10 lead over the Philadelphia Eagles. However, Philadelphia would win 17–14 on a touchdown reception by James Joseph. On 20-for-31 passing for 279 yards, Gannon threw two interceptions and two touchdowns that game. He was sacked five times for 27 yards and rushed four times for 25 yards.

Gannon led the Redskins to a Week 14 (December 5) victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 23–17, starting with a cumulative 17–0 lead by the third quarter. Gannon completed 9 of 16 passes for 71 yards and rushed 7 times for 12 yards. Gannon&#x27;s one interception that game came when Buccaneers defensive tackle Santana Dotson deflected the pass from the Redskins 8 and Ray Seals caught the ball in the Redskins&#x27; end zone for a touchdown. The score was 17–10 Redskins as the Buccaneers rallied with 10 unanswered points.

In the Redskins&#x27; 3–0 loss to the New York Jets in Week 15 (December 12), Gannon was benched in the fourth quarter in favor of Mark Rypien, but the Redskins could not handle the Jets&#x27; defense. Gannon completed 7 of 15 passes for 62 yards (including one 50-yarder).

On 74 of 125 passing (59.2 percent), Gannon passed for 704 yards with three touchdowns and seven interceptions and rushed 21 times for 88 yards and one touchdown. The Redskins finished 1993 with a 4–12 record, and Gannon was 1–3 as a starter, with the three losses all being within margins four points or less.

===Kansas City Chiefs===
Gannon sat out the 1994 season after shoulder surgery. In 1995, Gannon signed with the Kansas City Chiefs. For two years he served as a backup to Steve Bono. In 1997, a quarterback controversy was created when the Gannon-led Chiefs excelled in the absence of the injured Elvis Grbac. In the playoffs, coach Marty Schottenheimer elected to play Grbac instead of Gannon, and the Chiefs lost 14–10. The two ended up splitting snaps in 1998, after Grbac was injured in Week 1.

===Oakland Raiders===
In February 1999, Gannon was signed as a free agent by the Oakland Raiders. He excelled in head coach Jon Gruden&#x27;s West Coast offense and was voted to the Pro Bowl in his first year as a Raider – the first of four straight selections. In 2001 and 2002, he won the Pro Bowl MVP award consecutively, a feat achieved by no other NFL player.

Gannon won the NFL Most Valuable Player Award after a record-setting 2002 season, throwing for 4,689 yards and 26 touchdowns and recording a career-high 97.2 passer rating, which helped the Raiders advance to Super Bowl XXXVII, making him the first former Blue Hens quarterback to start a Super Bowl. He was passing at a record pace with more passing yards than any quarterback in history through 14 games at the time but fell off the pace in the last few weeks. He led the league with 418 completions on 618 attempts.

In the Super Bowl, Gannon threw a Super Bowl-record five interceptions – three of which were run back for touchdowns – in a 48–21 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Buccaneers&#x27; defense was aided by the fact that their new head coach was Jon Gruden, who had knowledge of the Raiders&#x27; playbook as well as Gannon&#x27;s mannerisms and even some audibles, which Raiders head coach Bill Callahan had left unchanged after Gruden&#x27;s departure.

Gannon&#x27;s 2003 season was ended by a shoulder injury in Week 7 after a 2–5 start. A serious neck injury in 2004 effectively ended his career. Gannon was hurt in Week 3 when he scrambled, and slid into a helmet-to-helmet collision with Tampa Bay linebacker Derrick Brooks.

When the Raiders signed Kerry Collins prior to the 2004 season, some thought that Gannon would be cut in favor of the strong-armed Collins, whom skeptics thought was a better fit in new head coach Norv Turner&#x27;s vertical offense. Gannon not only kept his starting quarterback spot, but thrived. He threw for 305 yards in the season opener against the Pittsburgh Steelers, including a 40-yard touchdown strike to Doug Gabriel. The Raiders nearly won the game over a Steelers team that finished the 2004 season with 15 victories. The Raiders were a competitive team with Gannon as their quarterback, going 2–1 when he started and 3–10 after his injury.

<text>() or () is a coastal town and municipality in the &quot;comarca&quot; of Marina Alta, in the province of Alicante, Valencia, Spain, by the Mediterranean Sea. Situated on the side of the Montgó Massif, behind a wide bay and sheltered between two rocky headlands, the town has become a very popular small seaside resort and market town. Half of its resident population and over two thirds of its annual visitors are foreigners.

==History==
The area was first inhabited in prehistoric times, 30,000 years ago by cave dwellers on Montgó. Subsequent residents have included Stone and Bronze-age peoples, Romans, Greeks, Phoenicians, Visigoths, Germanic, Carthaginians, and Moors. Roman fishing boats used the port, and there is evidence that dates the Roman occupation of Xàbia to the 2nd century BC, it makes Xàbia the oldest known Roman site on the coast with a commercial port for fish and minerals.

According to legend, Christian Visigoth monks came to Xàbia in the 6th century AD and founded the monastery of Sant Martí, which likely gave its name to the cape in the area named Cap San Martí. Hermenegild, son of the Visigoth king Leovigild of Toledo, sought refuge in the Monastery after angering his father by marrying a Christian girl. When his father&#x27;s troops arrived to arrest him all but one monk fled to Portichol; Hermenegild and the old monk were killed. Several people with Visigoth names still live in the area. There is no archaeological evidence for the existence of the monastery of San Martí. 
There is little left of the Moors and their culture, other than some inscribed gravestones and ceramics. They had controlled the area from about 714 AD until they (the Moriscos) were finally expelled from the Alicante region in 1609. The hermitage of Popol dates to the 14th century.

In the 16th and 17th centuries pirate raids were prevalent, so a wall was built around the town for protection. The wall was later torn down, and today a replica exists in its place in certain sections.

=== Archaeology ===
In September 2021, archaeologists announced the discovery of trove of 1,500-year-old gold coins from the Roman Empire. A hoard of 50 coins with inscriptions was almost well-preserved and easily readable. According to researchers, Roman Emperors&#x27; pictures included Valentinian I (three coins), Valentinian II (seven coins), Theodosius I (15 coins), Arcadius (17 coins), Honorius (10 coins) and an unidentified coin. The coins will be restored and then exhibited at the Soler Blasco Archaeological and Ethnographic Museum in Xàbia

==Geography==
Xàbia is situated in the north of the province, on the easternmost point of the Mediterranean coast. The island of Ibiza lies some to the east, and it can be seen on clear days. Flat, fertile agricultural land stretches for miles inland, criss-crossed by small streams and used primarily for growing citrus and olive trees. The coastline of Xàbia features four capes; Cabo de San Antonio, Cap de la Nau (the largest), &quot;Cap Negre&quot; and &quot;Cap Martí&quot;.
The Montgó Massif, which shelters Xàbia, is the highest summit of the region standing at a height of over 750m. The Parque natural del Macizo del Montgó was declared in 1987, stretching across the area of La Plana to the cape of Sant Antoni. Cape San Antonio is located nearby.

==Transport==
The port has a gravel beach and marina, known as Duanes de la Mar. Whilst the history of the harbour stretches back to the 15th century, the first jetty was built in 1871 and it became an important gateway for the export of raisins. The raisin trade collapsed at the end of the 19th century, and the settlement became only a fishing harbour. The modern harbour was built in the 1950s and 1960s. The nautical club has been in the central area of the harbour since 1963. The landmark is the church of Mare de Déu de Loreto, built in 1967 in the shape of an oval boat keel, to resemble a fishing vessel bursting through the waves.

<doc id="854095" wikidata="Q491216" url="?curid=854095" title="Overland Track">
<text>The Overland Track is an Australian bushwalking track, traversing Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park, within the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. It is walked by more than nine thousand people each year, with numbers limited in the warmer months. Officially the track runs for from Cradle Mountain to Lake St Clair however many choose to extend it by walking along Lake St Clair for an extra day, bringing it to . It winds through terrain ranging from glacial mountains, temperate rainforest, wild rivers and alpine plains.

There are several well known side tracks, including walks to the summits of Cradle Mountain and Mount Ossa, the tallest mountain in Tasmania and a group of tarns called The Labyrinth. Known for its pristine environment and beauty, the Overland Track is listed by Lonely Planet as one of the best treks in the world.

The walk can be done independently, with six main public huts maintained by Tasmania Parks and Wildlife and five private huts for commercial groups only. Bushwalkers usually complete the track in five or six days, usually from north to south. The record time is seven hours and 25 minutes, achieved by Andy Kromar during the Cradle Mountain Run.

== History ==

===Use by Aboriginal Nations===
The Overland Track spans the boundary between the Big River and Northern Tasmanian Aboriginal nations and may have been used as an access route. Several artifacts and campsites containing various stone types and tools have been discovered between Pelion Plains and Lake St Clair, and early surveyors reported huts in the area. Aboriginal Tasmanians were persecuted by the European settlers upon their arrival, and the last free Aboriginals in the area were seen between Barn Bluff and Lake Windemere in 1836.

===Early European Development===
Europeans first explored Cradle Mountain in 1827 and 1828 with Joseph Fossey and Henry Hellyer surveying for the Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Company. Lake St Clair was sighted by surveyor William Sharland in 1832, with George Frankland leading an expedition to it three years later.

During the late 19th century there was an effort to build a railway to the west coast of Tasmania, which at the time was only accessible by boat. Railway engineer Allan Stewart began surveying a route which led up the Mersey Valley up to what is now the middle of the Overland Track, but ran out of money before it could be completed. Parts of his trail were used by the Innes track (est. 1897), which led to the mining town of Rosebery. The Overland Track itself follows the original Innes track across Pelion Plains.

These tracks encouraged prospecting, and several mines were set up including coal near Barn Bluff, copper in Pelion Plains, Lake Windemere and Commonwealth Creek, tin in Mount Inglis, and tungsten in the Forth Valley. Lake Windemere and Old Pelion huts were established during this mining effort.

Trappers worked in the area from the 1860s until the collapse of the fur trade in the 1950s, although hunting in the park was declared illegal after 1927. They established huts, including Du Cane and Pine Valley, and burned the land to encourage fresh growth and game.

During the same timeframe Pelion Plains was used by sheep and cattle for grazing in the summer, and wild cattle lived in the area until 1948. The cattle were reportedly quite aggressive, and known to attack early bushwalkers.

===Environmental Protection and Tourism===
Both Lake St Clair and Cradle Mountain were regarded by European settlers as beautiful tourist destinations, with tourist lodges at each location.

In the 1910s Gustav and Kate Weindorfer began campaigning for the area from Cradle Mountain to Lake St Clair to be a national park. It was declared a scenic reserve in 1922, a wildlife reserve in 1927 and its current designation of national park from 1947. During this transition, former trappers began building huts and guiding bushwalkers, including Paddy Hartnett, Weindorfer and Bob Quaile.

It was not until 1931 that fur trapper Bert Nichols blazed the Overland Track and by 1935 it was consolidated and used by independent walking parties.

By 1937 it was officially named the &quot;Overland Track&quot; and the track had been upgraded to be used for guided tours and pack horses. Shortly after Kitchen Hut was built, now used as an emergency shelter.

In the 1970s management of the park passed to the newly formed Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service after the controversial flooding of Lake Pedder and commercially guided tours were reintroduced.

==Management==
The Overland Track has been managed by Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service since 1971, with the purpose of both improving access, and conserving World Heritage areas.

They manage track maintenance, hut maintenance and upgrades, toilet waste removal and staff rangers along the track during the summer.

During their tenure the popularity of the track increased dramatically, with the number of walkers increased from 1500 to 8800 between 1971 and 2004. The demographics also shifted away from being mostly locals to 35% international, 57% from the mainland, and 8% from Tasmania. In 2005 a booking system was implemented to manage its increased popularity, and restrictions were placed on walkers. In 2024 it costs $295 AUD for an adult to walk the track from October to May (inclusive), not including the National Parks Pass, and walkers must travel from north to south on a prebooked starting date.

===Erosion===
The track was in poor condition by the 1980s with significant mud and erosion, with 29% of the track impacted by knee-deep mud and track widening. In 1982, major Tasmanian national parks were recognised as a World Heritage Area, and federal funding was allocated to hut and track upgrades. This consisted of duckboarding vulnerable parts of the track.

In 2015, the track condition was judged to be in vastly improved condition with only 4% considered &quot;poor&quot;. 
the track is now free from erosion.

==Hazards==

Highland Tasmanian weather can be unpredictable and cause hazardous track conditions, however most injuries and deaths from 1990 can be attributed to slips.

In 2014 an international student from Victoria died from hypothermia between Kitchen Hut and Waterfall Valley due to inclement weather and inadequate clothing. It led to stricter guidelines for bushwalker preparedness, and Chinese language information at trailheads.

== Climate ==
The climate is generally unstable, with temperatures ranging from hot (in excess of ) in summer to below in winter. Snow can fall at any time and is common during the winter, especially on the Cradle Mountain Plateau and around Mount Ossa. Rain is very common, sometimes torrential though often settling to days of drizzle. Additionally, the climate varies significantly between Cradle Mountain and Lake St Clair, with Cradle Mountain subject to almost twice as much annual rainfall despite having the same number of rainy days. This informed the practice (now policy) of bushwalkers departing from the north.

== Flora and Fauna ==


The Overland Track traverses Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park, which is a significant habitat for Tasmania&#x27;s endemic species. An estimated 40–55% of the parks documented alpine flora is endemic. Furthermore, 68% of the higher rainforest species recorded in alpine areas in Tasmania are present in the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park. The park&#x27;s alpine vegetation is very diverse and has largely escaped forest fires that have caused neighbouring regions to suffer.

The most common fauna are Tasmanian Pademelons (native), possums and small rodents most of which are native. Also decidedly present, but not necessarily seen, are quolls, echidnas, tasmanian devils and wombats. There are also the famous Tasmanian leeches. The track traverses areas of many types of vegetation, including Myrtle Beech forest, Eucalypts forest, Button Grass plains, alpine herb fields, and shrubs and mosses.

===Birds===
The park has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it provides habitat for 11 of Tasmania&#x27;s endemic bird species, as well as for the flame and pink robins and the striated fieldwren. The IBA is important as a representative protected area in north-central Tasmania for those species.

===Buttongrass plains===
Large segments of the track pass across buttongrass plains, a landscape that is unique to Tasmania. It has been theorised that the extent of buttongrass plains could be due to Aboriginal fire-stick farming before European settlement.

===Human interactions with wildlife===
Some wildlife, especially possums, currawongs and quolls have become to associate humans with food and are quite adept at stealing from tents, huts and packs. Although the vast majority of people are against feeding wildlife, during a Tasmanian study 7.4% of people eating lunch in national parks were observed to feed animals in addition to currawongs scavenging food after they left. It is recommended that bushwalkers suspend food from the roof within huts, and store food in rigid containers inside tents as eating human food has caused lumpy jaw in wildlife.

== Geology ==
The oldest rocks in Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park are quartzites laid down in Precambrian times, and form a large base tilted towards the SSW and most exposed in the northern half of the track. Later, there was some mineralisation forming tin and copper deposits, and in the Permian Era marine deposits left shellfish fossils and sedimentary layered cliffs at about 900m.

In the Jurassic period, dolerite intruded through the crust, forming columns that cap every major mountain range in the national park.

North-south valleys were formed as Gondwana broke up, and they were further carved and deepened by glaciers during the last ice age. Cirque glaciers formed around most major peaks, giving Cradle Mountain its iconic shape.

== Sights ==

The Overland Track is listed as one of the best treks in the world by Lonely Planet and contains &quot;craggy mountains [and] beautiful lakes and tarns&quot;. The scenery is often described as spectacular, with walkers noting the mountain scenery, forests, alpine plains, lakes and waterfalls. Tasmania in general is known for its remote, interesting and challenging wilderness, and in bushwalking circles the Overland Track is considered a comparatively accessible way of experiencing this part of the world.

== Walking Route ==

The walk covers 65 km with most walkers covering approximately 12 km per day and staying over nights in and around the main huts. Public huts have room for 16-36 people, and there are numerous platformed tent sites around the areas. There are also private huts for guided tours.

The track is mostly well defined and adequately marked. The track condition, however, varies greatly. There are long sections of duckboard (boardwalk) which consist of split logs embedded in the ground, held together with wire and nails. Where there is no duckboard, the conditions can sometimes be very muddy. In winter, the mud is frozen solid early in the morning, however offsetting this is the problem of slippery ice on the duckboard. The mud is not nearly as frequent or deep as hikes in the southwest, due mainly to the duckboard.

Inexperienced walkers are advised to undertake the walk in summer when the days are longer and the weather milder. During this time the number of visitors is controlled by the &#x27;Overland Pass&#x27; a limited number of which are available, with revenue going towards maintaining the track and visitors must walk from the north to south. The walk is not challenging provided that walkers are adequately prepared with proper equipment. The track is covered by the Tasmap Cradle Mountain – Lake St Clair 1:100000 map.

=== Main Track ===

The main track crosses starts from Ronny Creek (or Dove Lake) and crosses the Cradle Mountain Plateau to reach Waterfall Valley. It then descends across heathlands to Lake Windermere and through rainforests to cross the Forth River at Frog Flats, before ascending to Pelion Plains. The track crosses the saddle between Mount Ossa and Mount Pelion East, and descends toward Kia Ora Hut. The next section crosses into the Du Cane Range, formed by cirque glaciers and surrounded by several waterfalls, then descends to cross the Narcissus River and meets the north side of Lake St Clair. From here, walkers either catch the ferry across the lake, or walk the 17 km to Cynthia Bay.

=== Side Tracks ===

There are a number of side trips that can be undertaken while on the Overland Track. From north to south these are:

* Cradle Mountain Summit – 2 km, 2–3 hours return.
* Barn Bluff – 7 km, 3–4 hours return.
* Lake Will – 3 km, 1 hour return.
* Mount Pelion West – 6 km, 5–6 hours return.
* Old Pelion Hut (with swimming hole) – 1 km, 25 minutes return
* Mount Oakleigh – 8 km, 4–5 hours return.
* Mount Ossa – 6 km, 3.5–4.5 hours return.
* Mount Pelion East
* Pine Valley, Tasmania
** The Acropolis
** The Labyrinth
* Ferguson Falls and D&#x27;alton Falls – 1 km, 1-1.5 hours return.
* Hartnett Falls – 1.5 km, 1 hour return.
* Mount Rufus

== Huts ==
The track has many huts, enabling hikers to stay indoors every night. There is no booking system for huts, so it is mandatory for hikers to carry a tent in case there is no space available or there is an incident on the track. Commercial groups are not encouraged to use the huts overnight and while one company operates from a set of five private huts, all other operators use the designated group camping areas near each of the main huts.

=== Main Trail Huts ===
=== Side Route Huts ===
=== Day Use and Emergency shelters ===
Overnight use of these is prohibited except in an emergency
==Cradle Mountain Run==
The Cradle Mountain Run is an 82 km long Australian ultramarathon that follows the Overland Track. It is Australia&#x27;s oldest endurance race and has run annually from 1980. Entrance is highly controlled due to environmental concerns.

The men&#x27;s race record of 7:25 is held by Andy Kromar and the women&#x27;s race record of 8:13 is held by Hanny Allston.

<text>John Joseph Hayes (April 10, 1886 – August 25, 1965) was an American athlete, a member of the Irish American Athletic Club, and winner of the marathon race at the 1908 Summer Olympics. Hayes&#x27; Olympic victory contributed to the early growth of long-distance running and marathoning in the United States. He was also the first man to win a marathon at the now official standard distance of 26 miles 385 yards when Olympic officials lengthened the distance to put the finish line in front of the Royal Box (the 1896 and 1904 Olympic marathons had been less than 25 miles long).

==Biography==
Born in New York City to a family of Irish emigrants (from Nenagh in County Tipperary), Johnny Hayes is probably best known for winning the controversial marathon race at the London Olympics. Hayes is one of only three male American athletes to win the Olympic Marathon, (the other two being Thomas Hicks in 1904 and Frank Shorter in 1972).

In 1905, he joined Bloomingdale Brothers as an assistant to the manager of the sporting goods department. At night, he trained on a cinder track on the roof of the Bloomingdales building in New York. He was promoted to manager of the department after returning from his Olympic victory.

Hayes started his athletics career with a fifth-place finish at the 1906 Boston Marathon, running for the St. Bartholemew Athletic Club in a time of 2:55:38. He improved on that the following year by finishing third in Boston with a time of 2:30:38 and winning the inaugural Yonkers Marathon. In 1908 he finished second, 21 seconds behind Thomas Morrissey in the Boston Marathon with a time of 2:26:04 and thus qualified for the Olympic Games held in London that same year.

The British Olympic Association wanted to start the race in front of Windsor Castle and finish in front of the royal reviewing stand at the White City Stadium. As a result, the distance was 26 miles and 385 yards (42.195 km). It took until 1921 for the IAAF to codify that distance as the official length of the marathon. Prior to this, races were usually about 25 miles (40 km). He died in 1965.

==1908 Olympic victory==

At the race itself, Dorando Pietri from Italy was the first to enter the stadium. But Pietri had depleted himself to open a more than 10 minute lead over the field and was suffering extreme fatigue and dehydration. When he entered the stadium, he took the wrong path, and when umpires redirected him, he fell down for the first time. He got up with their help in front of 75,000 spectators.

Pietri fell four more times, and each time, the umpires helped him up. He managed to finish the race first, with a time of 2h 54min 46s. During all these stumbles and the direct aid from the officials, Hayes had now entered the stadium, finishing the race second, with a time of 2h 55min 18s.

Pietri was disqualified after the US officials filed a protest. Despite the official result, Pietri achieved much more fame than Hayes when Queen Alexandra awarded him a special silver cup.

All of the Olympic officials were British, and the Pietri incident joined a list of other controversial calls in the 1908 Olympics, prompting the International Olympic Committee to start appointing judges from a wide variety of countries instead of only the host country.

After the dramatic Olympic battle between Pietri and Hayes, public interest was such that a match race was organized by professional promoters in November 1908 at Madison Square Garden. Pietri won the race by 75 yards. A second match race was held on March 15, 1909, and again Pietri won. Both Pietri and Hayes turned professional after the Olympics and achieved great fame.

Hayes was a trainer for the US 1912 Olympic team. He later taught physical education and was a food broker. Johnny Hayes died in Englewood, New Jersey.

The Shore Athletic Club of New Jersey (Shore AC) holds the Johnny Hayes collection as lifetime trustees. Included in the collection are numerous trophies, as well as the 1908 Olympic gold medal for the marathon. This represents the first Olympic gold medal to be won at the modern marathon distance of 26 miles, 385 yards.

Johnny Hayes was a guest on the television show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; as one of five former Olympic champions, which aired on October 13, 1954.
In 2002, three statues honoring Olympic champions with links to Nenagh, Matt McGrath, Johnny Hayes and Bob Tisdall, were unveiled in front of the Nenagh Courthouse.

<doc id="854098" wikidata="Q430018" url="?curid=854098" title="Champenois language">
<text>Champenois (&quot;lou champaignat&quot;) is a Romance language among the &quot;langues d&#x27;oïl&quot; spoken by a minority of people in Champagne and Île-de-France provinces in France, as well as in a handful of towns in southern Belgium (chiefly the municipality of Vresse-sur-Semois).

While it is classified as a regional language of France, it also has recognized status as a regional language in Wallonia, a region of Belgium. Champenois is considered an endangered language by the UNESCO Red Book of Endangered Languages.

== Literature ==
The language of Chrétien de Troyes is marked by Champenois traits and Rashi used Champenois in his commentaries, but the earliest literature to survive consciously written in Champenois is noted from the end of the 16th century. &quot;Le Bontemps de Carnaval de Chaumont&quot; was updated and republished in 1660. The language used contrasts the French spoken by the king&#x27;s messengers with the Champenois of the local inhabitants. A feature of 18th century Champenois literature was the &quot;noëls&quot; (Christmas chants), which wove contemporary and local references into pious texts.

<doc id="854103" wikidata="Q355748" url="?curid=854103" title="Mehmood (actor)">
<text>Mehmood Ali (29 September 1932 – 23 July 2004), popularly known simply as Mehmood &amp; the Original &quot;Bhaijaan&quot; of bollywood, was an Indian actor, singer, director and producer, best known for playing comic roles in Hindi films.

During his career of more than four decades, he worked in over 300 Hindi films. He is known as India&#x27;s national comedian. Mehmood received 25 nominations for film awards, 19 for &#x27;Best Performance in a Comic Role&#x27;, while the awards started in 1954, awards for the best comedian category started only in 1967. Prior to that Mehmood also received 6 nominations for &#x27;Best Supporting Actor&#x27;.

==Early life==

Mehmood Ali was born on 29 September 1932. He was the second of the eight children, and eldest son to Latifunnisa and film and stage actor/dancer Mumtaz Ali, who was a huge star of the 1940s and 1950s cinema in Mumbai. Mehmood had an elder sister and six younger siblings. His sister, Minoo Mumtaz, was also a successful dancer and character actress in Bollywood movies. His youngest brother, Anwar Ali, is also an actor as well as a producer of such movies as &quot;Khud-daar&quot; and &quot;Kaash&quot;.

==Career==

===Early career===
As a child, he worked in Bombay films like &quot;Kismet&quot;. He later had a number of odd jobs, selling poultry products and working as a driver for director P. L. Santoshi. Santoshi&#x27;s son, Rajkumar Santoshi, would later cast him in the film &quot;Andaz Apna Apna&quot; (1994). Many of Mehmood&#x27;s film songs were sung by Mohammad Rafi.

Mehmood reportedly taught table tennis to actress Meena Kumari. Through her, he came in contact with her younger sister Madhu, whom he married Madhu in the early 1950s. After having a son, Masood, he decided to act to earn a better living and started off by doing small, unnoticed roles in films like the peanut seller in &quot;Do Bigha Zameen&quot;, a killer in &quot;C.I.D.&quot; and a minor role in &quot;Pyaasa&quot;. He later went on to act in lead roles as well, but he was more appreciated for his comedy, some of which was in the Hyderabad region&#x27;s Urdu accent. Mehmood knew exactly how to tickle the film viewers&#x27; funny bone. He was really good at playing the film&#x27;s hero&#x27;s friend, who would help him out of sticky situations with his street-smart ways.

Besides actress Shubha Khote, he also teamed up with fellow comedian, I. S. Johar and actress Aruna Irani.

===Later career===
In the 1980s, Mehmood&#x27;s popularity began to decline as other comedy actors like Jagdeep, Asrani, Paintal, Deven Verma and Kader Khan shot to prominence. Between 1990 and 1999, he made a handful of movies, but most of them were either shelved or made no impression. He acted as Johnny in Rajkumar Santoshi&#x27;s &quot;Andaz Apna Apna&quot; (1994)– his last known film as an actor.

On 23 July 2004, Mehmood died in his sleep in Pennsylvania, where he had gone for treatment of cardiovascular heart disease after suffering from poor health over several years. His fans were able to pay homage to him at Mehboob Studio in Bandra, Mumbai.

==Legacy==
One of his sons, Lucky Ali (Maqsood Ali), is a singer and composer who has also appeared in films. Mehmood was one of the most respected and loved entertainers in the Indian film fraternity. A performer of such caliber that leading men back in the day used to reject films because their presence used to diminish in films if they starred with Mehmood.

He was the one who introduced Amitabh Bachchan into the commercial cinema space. Mehmood saw potential in Amitabh and put him in films like &quot;Bombay To Goa&quot; (1972) which was a success. He also gave a break to the music director R. D. Burman whose first independent film as music director was &quot;Chhote Nawab&quot; (1961) and to Rajesh Roshan with his own production &quot;Kunwara Baap&quot; (1974).

Famous American actor Gregory Peck said Mehmood was too handsome to be a comedian.

According to actor Satish Kaushik, Mehmood&#x27;s iconic role in &quot;Padosan&quot; inspired him to become an actor, and he was fortunate enough to pay homage to him by recreating a similar role in &quot;Saajan Chale Sasural&quot;, for which he won a Filmfare Award.

Mehmood and Tamil Comedian Nagesh were heavily influenced by the American Comedian Jerry Lewis. They copied his slapstick comedy and dancing style.

Just like Martin and Lewis, Mehmood formed a comical partnership with another Bollywood legend I. S. Johar.

<doc id="854105" wikidata="Q2496960" url="?curid=854105" title="Unstan ware">
<text>Unstan ware is the name used by archaeologists for a type of finely made and decorated Neolithic pottery from the 4th and 3rd millennia BC. Typical are elegant and distinctive shallow bowls with a band of grooved patterning below the rim, a type of decoration which was created using a technique known as &quot;stab-and-drag&quot;. A second version consists of undecorated, round-bottomed bowls. Some of the bowls had bits of volcanic rock included in the clay to make them stronger. Bone tools were used to burnish the surfaces to make them shiny and impermeable.

Unstan ware is named after the Unstan Chambered Cairn on the Mainland of the Orkney Islands, a fine example of a stalled chambered tomb in a circular mound, where the style of pottery was first found in 1884. Unstan ware is mostly found in tombs, specifically tombs of the Orkney-Cromarty type. These include the Tomb of the Eagles at Isbister on South Ronaldsay, and Taversoe Tuick and Midhowe on Rousay.

Unstan ware has been found occasionally at sites in Orkney other than tombs; for example, the farmstead of Knap of Howar on Papa Westray. Although more recent excavations in Orkney have found Unstan ware to be a more common feature in a domestic context than previously thought, challenging the interpretation of Unstan ware being mainly from tombs and in the Western Isles, as at Eilean Domhnuill.

Unstan ware may have evolved into the later grooved ware style. This interpretation was originally based primarily on a presumed evolution in pottery styles, from Unstan ware to grooved ware, seen at the settlement of Rinyo on Rousay. D.V. Clarke claimed in 1983 that his investigations at Rinyo had debunked this sequence. John Hedges is another primary proponent of what might be termed the &quot;cultural coexistence&quot; hypothesis, suggesting that although Unstan ware may predate grooved ware, the cultures associated with these styles of pottery lived side by side across Orkney for centuries. In this interpretation of the evidence, grooved ware is associated with the builders of the Maeshowe class of chambered tomb. The geographic distribution in Orkney of the two pottery types is as follows: grooved ware is found on Mainland, Sanday, and North Ronaldsay, with Unstan ware found on Mainland and the remaining islands, especially Rousay and Eday. Hedges sums up his view this way:
What is important is an understanding that the neolithic population of Orkney can be divided into two major parts on the basis of some elements of their material cultures. It is probable that they originated from different areas and...there is no difficulty in imagining their ability to coexist.

However, he also notes:
One point that should be made at the outset is that there is no discernable difference in the culture- in the social anthropological sense- of the Grooved Ware and Unstan Ware people...it is only apparent from limited aspects of material culture and the evidence...shows it to have been subordinate to a tribal level of unity which took in the whole of Orkney.

<doc id="854108" wikidata="Q7987596" url="?curid=854108" title="Western Auto">
<text>Western Auto Supply Company—known more widely as Western Auto—was a specialty retail chain of stores that supplied automobile parts and accessories operating approximately 1,200 stores across the United States. 

Started in 1909 in Kansas City, Missouri, by George Pepperdine and Don Abnor Davis, Pepperdine would later found Pepperdine University.

Western Auto was purchased by Beneficial Corporation in 1961; Western Auto&#x27;s management led a leveraged buyout in 1985, leading three years later to a sale to Sears. Sears sold most of the company to Advance Auto Parts in 1998, and by 2003, the resulting merger had led to the end of the Western Auto brand and its product distribution network.

After the demise of Western Auto, the company&#x27;s corporate headquarters at 2107 Grand Boulevard in Kansas City, Missouri, was transformed into loft condominiums; the Western Auto sign remaining atop the building. The sign was relit in July 13, 2018.

==History==
Western Auto originally started as a mail order business for replacement auto parts. The first retail store was established in 1921, and grew quickly as automobiles became increasingly more common. At one point, there were over 1,200 company-owned stores nationwide, usually located in metropolitan areas, and more than 4,000 associate stores (private, franchised, &quot;dealer&quot; locations), usually located in small towns. The associate store program was the first of its type, pioneering the way for modern day franchise operations. The company had five regional distribution centers in the United States, with the North Carolina center serving stores in Puerto Rico.

In addition to the auto parts stores, Western also owned two middle-sized tire store chains, a mobile radio maker called Midland International, and Eva Gabor International Ltd., a wig supplier. (source: LA Times)

===Private labelling===

Western Auto was known for its private labelled &quot;Western Flyer Bicycle&quot; and &quot;Performance Radial GT&quot; tire brand. Other Western Auto private-labeled brands included &quot;Davis&quot; tires, &quot;Tough One&quot; batteries, &quot;TrueTone&quot; electronics, &quot;Citation&quot; appliances, &quot;Wizard&quot; tools, and &quot;Wizard&quot; typewriters — the latter as re-branded typewriters manufactured by Brother Industries of Nagoya, Japan. Western Auto was also the parent company of &quot;Auto America&quot; and &quot;Parts America&quot; stores, and acquired National Tire Warehouse (NTW) stores. They also used the &quot;Wizard&quot; name on outdoor equipment including lawn mowers, tillers, outboard engines and boats for a short time, along with automotive parts such as batteries and tires.

===Firearm sales===

Sometime in the 1940s or 1950s, Western Auto started selling rifles and shotguns in its catalogues. As with other chains at the time, such as Sears, Roebuck and Co., Montgomery Ward, and J.C. Penney, Western Auto&#x27;s firearms were sold under a proprietary brand name. Often called &quot;store brand&quot; firearms, they were produced by reputable name brand manufacturers, such as O.F. Mossberg &amp; Sons, Remington Arms, Savage Arms, Winchester Repeating Arms Company, and High Standard Manufacturing Company. Western Auto firearms sold under the &quot;Revelation&quot; brand name, and were generally models from the brands Savage, Marlin Firearms, or Mossberg.

Other than markings, Revelation models were identical to standard production models. They were the most basic models produced by the various manufacturers, and featured plain birch or walnut stocks. However, metal bluing remained good and nearly all models were provided with iron sights and mounting provisions for scopes. Once valued lower than &quot;name brand&quot; equivalents, store-brand rifles, shotguns, and revolvers have essentially reached price parity with their more universal counterparts. Firearms were one of many lines added to the store in a product diversification effort. By the end of the 1950s Western Auto was similar to a Sears store, equipped with a catalog order center. Auto parts comprised a small percentage of the company&#x27;s sales by the mid-1960s, and had nearly disappeared by the 1970s.

===Beneficial===
In 1961, Western Auto was sold to the Beneficial Finance Corporation. Beneficial retained ownership until 1985, when the company was purchased in a leveraged buyout led by Western Auto management and Wesray Capital Corporation.

===Streamlining business operations===
In the early 1980s, in response to the success of Wal-Mart, Western Auto Retail converted all of the company-owned stores to what it called &quot;FLAG&quot; stores, which sold exclusively automotive parts and accessories. These stores were largely located in more urbanized areas much like their successors today. Western Auto Wholesale strongly urged its associate stores to become at least 50% automotive, but most refused because the customer base of their locations, in &quot;small town America&quot;, demanded a wider range of merchandise. This disagreement by the associate stores would later save the company.

In February 1986, Western Auto purchased 40 White Stores in Texas from Canadian Tire for US$24.5 million. In February 1987, Western Auto purchased Wheeling, West Virginia-based Tire America. In October of that year, it purchased Dale City, Virginia-based National Tire Warehouse.

===Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. purchase===
In 1988, Sears Roebuck purchased Western Auto from Wesray Capital.

In 1995, Western Auto acquired 84 auto parts stores in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia and Tennessee from the bankrupted Nationwise Automotive chain for an undisclosed amount and later acquired Wheels Discount Auto Supply and its 82 auto parts stores in New York and Pennsylvania from its then owner Fay&#x27;s Drug for $37 million.

Also during 1995, Sears began to convert the Western Auto stores to the new parts-only Parts America format by eliminating the automotive service bays. By 1998, Sears had almost finished converting the 600 remaining company owned Western Auto stores into Parts America branded stores.

By the beginning of 1997, fewer than 850 company-owned stores remained. At that point, the associate stores were the main stores of the company, with their more diversified name-brand lines including appliances, electronics, hardware, typewriters, bicycles, go-karts and outdoor equipment/parts, and their reach into small-town America. Sears removed National Tire Warehouse and Tire America from Western Auto to form a new company called National Tire and Battery, which Sears kept until 2003.

From 1991 until the end of the 1997 season, Western Auto sponsored NASCAR Hall of Fame driver Darrell Waltrip&#x27;s Winston Cup race team. The specialty retailer also sponsored Al Hofmann&#x27;s Funny Car in NHRA from 1994 to 1997.

===Advance Auto Parts merger===
After weeks of speculation in 1998, parent company Sears sold what remained of Western Auto to Advance Auto Parts of Roanoke, Virginia. The business deal was not what experts in the after-market automotive industry expected. Specifically in return, Sears Roebuck became &quot;one of the largest shareholders&quot; after obtaining a 40% stake in Advance Auto Parts, and by merging their two store networks, which included Western Auto&#x27;s wholesale and retail operations. More precisely, the existing store network of Advance Auto Parts, comprising 915 stores in 17 U.S. states, merged with 590 U.S.-based Parts America Stores in addition to 40 Western Auto stores in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

The merger between Western Auto and Advance Auto substantially expanded Advance&#x27;s network to over 1,500 retail stores in 36 states. Additionally, Sears Roebuck received a cash payment of $175 million USD, while Advance Auto&#x27;s investors provided a further $70 million USD directly to Advance. Freeman Spogli &amp; Co. organized an investment fund that was among the group of investors that provided Advance with the $70 million cash infusion. Despite the 40% acquisition by Sears Roebuck, both companies maintained their Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s &quot;single-&#x27;B&#x27;-plus corporate credit rating&quot;. Analysts continued to speculate on the &quot;financial flexibility&quot; of Advance Auto at the time expecting the company to &quot;take advantage of other opportunistic acquisitions&quot;.

A few of the associate stores converted to Sears Dealer stores. The remainder of the company-owned stores, located primarily in the eastern United States, were then converted into Advance stores. The remaining associate stores were promised a great and long future in the tradition of Western Auto, a promise that was not kept. Advance gave little support to the associate store operation and as a result most dealers found themselves purchasing 70%+ of their merchandise from other suppliers and simply using the Western Auto name.

==Demise of the Western Auto distribution network==
In October 2003, Advance Auto notified the Western Auto Supply Company that by January 2004 it &quot;would no longer supply merchandise and services to the stores in its distribution network&quot;. This decision brought an end to the Western Auto brand name after nearly a century in business. Some Western Auto store owners knew that such a decision by Advance Auto was inevitable after noticing &quot;a trend of discontinued brands, lack of computer point-of-sale system updates, and shipments of fewer and fewer types of merchandise&quot;. Advance Auto Parts&#x27; spokesman, Shelia Stuewe, speaking on the matter stated &quot;that the logistics of distributing appliances, home and garden supplies, auto parts and hardware to over 300 independent dealers scattered across 33 states became too much for the company to continue.&quot;

===Use of Western Auto name===
Dealer stores were permitted by Advance Auto Parts a license to use the Western Auto name until 2006. After 2006, stores were to cease using the Western Auto name, but many stores continue to use the name. At this time, no storefront is licensed to use the name Western Auto or fly the Western Auto sign. Advance Auto Parts remains the owner of the registered trademarks and name &quot;Western Auto&quot; and enforces infringements on the name, but it is unknown if they have future plans for the name. Advance also owns the name Western Auto Supply Company which is registered in Virginia.

The Western Auto name was used by Advance Auto Parts in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, where it was the largest such chain, until 2006 when the last company-owned store in St. Croix was closed. All of the other stores in the division were gradually converted to Advance stores.

<text>Palio is the name given in Italy to an annual athletic contest, very often of a historical character, pitting the neighbourhoods of a town or the hamlets of a &quot;comune&quot; against each other. Typically, they are fought in costume and commemorate some event or tradition of the Middle Ages and thus often involve horse racing, archery, jousting, crossbow shooting, and similar medieval sports. Once purely a matter of local rivalries, many have now become events that are staged with an eye to visitors and foreign tourists.
The Palio di Siena is the only one that has been run without interruption since it started in the 1630s and is definitely the most famous all over the world. Its historical origins are documented since 1239 even though the version seen today was the final evolution of races held from the second half of the 16th century. In 1935, Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini sent out an official declaration that only the one of Siena could bring the designation of Palio. All other horse races held in various parts of Italy are actually just modern reenactments. After the Second World War, nevertheless, many other palios arose throughout the various regions of Italy. Here is an incomplete list:

<text>Frederick Biletnikoff (born February 23, 1943), nicknamed &quot;Scarecrow&quot;, is an American former professional football player and coach. He played as a wide receiver for the Oakland Raiders in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons and later was an assistant coach with the team. He retired as an NFL player after the 1978 season then played one more season in the Canadian Football League (CFL) for the Montreal Alouettes in 1980. While he lacked the breakaway speed to be a deep-play threat, Biletnikoff was one of the most sure-handed and consistent receivers of his day with a propensity for making spectacular catches. He was also known for running smooth, precise pass routes. He is a member of both the Pro Football Hall of Fame (1988) and College Football Hall of Fame (1991).

Biletnikoff attended Florida State University, where he played college football for the Florida State Seminoles football team and earned consensus All-American honors after leading the country in receiving yards and receiving touchdowns as a senior. The Fred Biletnikoff Award, given annually to the most outstanding receiver in NCAA Division I FBS, is named in his honor.

Through his AFL and NFL career, Biletnikoff had 589 receptions for 8,974 yards and 76 touchdowns and had a then-league-record 10 straight seasons of 40 or more receptions during a time when teams emphasized running over passing. With the Raiders, Biletnikoff played in the second AFL-NFL World Championship game—retroactively known as Super Bowl II—and in Super Bowl XI, in which he was named the game&#x27;s MVP in a victory over the Minnesota Vikings. A four-time Pro Bowl selection, he also played two AFL All-Star games, three AFL title games and five AFC championship games.

==Early life==
Biletnikoff was born and raised in Erie, Pennsylvania, the son of Natalie (Karuba) and Ephriam Biletnikoff. All four of his grandparents were Russian immigrants. In Erie, Biletnikoff attended what was then Technical Memorial High School, now Erie High School, whose athletic field now bears his name. In high school, Biletnikoff excelled in football, basketball, baseball, and track. He was a champion high jumper and earned All-City honors in basketball and baseball. His younger brother Bob was a starting quarterback for the Miami Hurricanes in the mid-1960s.

==College career==
Biletnikoff turned down other notable offers to attend Florida State University in Tallahassee. He missed several games during his first varsity season in 1962 with a broken foot. He played on both sides of the ball his junior season, leading the team in receptions and interceptions. That year, he returned an interception 99 yards for a touchdown off a pass thrown by George Mira of the Miami Hurricanes, a record which stood until 1987, when Deion Sanders broke it by one yard. As a senior in 1964, Biletnikoff led the nation with 1,179 receiving yards and 15 touchdowns, and finished second in receptions (70) and scoring (90). One of his touchdowns came in the first quarter against the Florida Gators, which helped the Seminoles earn their first victory in the in-state rivalry, 16–7. The Seminoles finished the year with a 36–19 victory over Oklahoma in the Gator Bowl, in which Biletnikoff set school records with 13 receptions for 194 yards and four touchdowns. He was a consensus pick for the 1964 College Football All-America Team, receiving first-team honors from four official selectors: the Associated Press, Central Press Association, Football Writers Association of America, and Newspaper Enterprise Association. He was Florida State&#x27;s first consensus All-American in football. Biletnikoff compiled 100 receptions for 1,655 yards and 20 touchdowns in his career with the Seminoles, which at the time were all school records. While in college Fred also joined the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.

==Professional career==
After graduating from FSU, he was selected by the Oakland Raiders in the second round of the 1965 AFL Draft, 11th overall and by the Detroit Lions in the third round of the 1965 NFL draft, the 39th overall selection. Biletnikoff signed with the Raiders, where he played for fourteen seasons. With Oakland, he was nicknamed &quot;Coyote&quot;, and &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; because of his Russian heritage. In 1966, he caught his first touchdown pass, thrown by quarterback Tom Flores, who later became the Raiders&#x27; head coach the season after Biletnikoff was released by the team.

Although he lacked the breakaway speed to be a deep threat, Biletnikoff&#x27;s precise pass routes and sure hands made him one of the most consistent receivers of his day, and a favorite target of Raiders quarterbacks Daryle Lamonica and Ken Stabler. &quot;I like catching passes&quot;, he explained. &quot;And I like playing outside. I would be lost if I were ever told to do anything on a football field except catch passes.&quot; Through his career he recorded 589 receptions, and had a league record 10 straight seasons of 40 or more receptions from 1967 to 1976, since surpassed by many players. Following the retirement of Charley Taylor, Biletnikoff spent the 1978 season (his last) as the NFL&#x27;s active leader in career receiving yards, and retired ranked 5th all-time.

Biletnikoff popularized the use of Stickum, an adhesive that many players applied to their hands to assist with catching and gripping the ball. He would apply the substance all over his body and uniform prior to a game, a practice that was later picked up by Raiders cornerback Lester Hayes after Biletnikoff introduced him to it. The use of Stickum was banned by the NFL in 1981.

In his rookie season, Biletnikoff played primarily on special teams. He did not see playing time on offense until the seventh game of the year, against the Boston Patriots, in which he caught seven passes for 118 yards. His production increased significantly with Oakland&#x27;s acquisition of quarterback Daryle Lamonica in 1967. That year, he caught 40 passes for 876 yards and five touchdowns and led the league with an average of 21.9 yards per reception. He was invited to play in the 1967 AFL All-Star Game. In that year&#x27;s AFL championship game, Biletnikoff had two receptions for 19 yards in the Raiders&#x27; 40–7 blow-out win over the Houston Oilers. In Super Bowl II against the Green Bay Packers, he caught two passes for 10 yards as the Raiders were defeated 33–14.

Biletnikoff recorded his only 1,000-yard receiving season in 1968, when he caught 61 passes for 1,037 yards and six touchdowns. The following season, in 1969 he caught a career-high 12 receiving touchdowns. He was an AFL All-Star for the second time and earned first-team All-AFL honors from the Associated Press, the Newspaper Enterprise Association, Pro Football Writers of America, &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, &quot;Pro Football Weekly&quot;, and the New York &quot;Daily News&quot;. The AFL merged into the National Football League in 1970. In his first five seasons in the NFL, Biletnikoff was invited to four Pro Bowls.

A highly productive receiver in the postseason, Biletnikoff left the NFL as the all-time leader in postseason receptions (70), receiving yards (1,167), and receiving touchdowns (10) accumulated over 19 postseason games. He recorded over 100 receiving yards in a postseason five times. In the 1968 American Football League playoffs, he had 14 receptions for 370 yards and four touchdowns through two games. In the 1976–77 NFL playoffs, Biletnikoff recorded 13 receptions for 216 yards and a touchdown. This included four catches for 79 yards to set up three Oakland scores in the Raiders&#x27; 32–14 victory in Super Bowl XI, for which he was named Super Bowl MVP.

Biletnikoff was released by the Raiders prior to the 1979 season. After a year off, he played one season in the Canadian Football League for the Montreal Alouettes in 1980. In his lone CFL season, Biletnikoff caught 38 passes, second-most on the team, for 470 yards and four touchdowns.

==Coaching career and later life==
Biletnikoff began his career in coaching soon after his retirement from playing. He served on the coaching staff of Orange Glen High School (1982), Palomar College (1983), Diablo Valley College (1984), Oakland Invaders (1985), Arizona Wranglers (1986), and Calgary Stampeders (1987–88). In 1989, Biletnikoff became wide receivers coach for the Oakland Raiders, a position he held until 2007.

In February 1999, Biletnikoff&#x27;s daughter Tracey was found strangled to death at age 20 in Redwood City, California. Tracey&#x27;s boyfriend, Mohammed Haroon Ali, was convicted of first-degree murder in 2012 after admitting he strangled her with a T-shirt at a drug and alcohol treatment center during an argument over whether he had relapsed. He was sentenced to 55 years to life imprisonment. Biletnikoff called Ali an &quot;animal&quot; after the sentencing and said his hatred for him would never go away. In 2015, Biletnikoff founded Tracey&#x27;s Place of Hope in Loomis, California, a shelter for domestic violence victims and substance abuse treatment for females ages 14 to 18.

==Honors==
Biletnikoff was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1988. In 1999, Biletnikoff was ranked number 94 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the &quot;100 Greatest Football Players&quot;. He was voted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1991. The Fred Biletnikoff Award, awarded annually by the Tallahassee Quarterback Club Foundation to the nation&#x27;s outstanding receiver in NCAA Division I FBS since 1994, is named in his honor. In 2016, Biletnikoff was named the Walter Camp Man of the Year by the Walter Camp Football Foundation in recognition of his public service and his contributions to football.

<doc id="854120" wikidata="Q725884" url="?curid=854120" title="Ashley Hutchings">
<text>Ashley Stephen Hutchings (born 26 January 1945), MBE, sometimes known in early years as &quot;Tyger&quot; Hutchings, is an English bassist, songwriter, arranger, band leader, writer and record producer. He was a founding member of three noteworthy English folk-rock bands: Fairport Convention, Steeleye Span and The Albion Band. Hutchings has overseen numerous other projects, including records and live theatre, and has collaborated on film and television projects.

==History==
===Early career===
Hutchings was born in Southgate, London, England, but moved to Muswell Hill while still a child. As a teenager he became involved in the skiffle and blues movements and formed several groups, including &#x27;Dr K&#x27;s Blues Band&#x27; in 1964. He met guitarist Simon Nicol in 1966 when they both played in the &#x27;Ethnic Shuffle Orchestra&#x27;. They rehearsed on the floor above Nicol&#x27;s father&#x27;s medical practice in a house called &quot;Fairport&quot; that lent its name to the group they formed together as Fairport Convention in 1967 with Richard Thompson, and which soon included Martin Lamble, Judy Dyble and Iain Matthews.

===Fairport Convention===
Hutchings played on the band&#x27;s first four albums. The first three, &quot;Fairport Convention&quot; (1968), &quot;What We Did on Our Holidays&quot; (1969) and &quot;Unhalfbricking&quot; (1969), largely consisted of American singer/songwriter material and original songs in a similar style. Hutchings&#x27; restrained but powerful bass style is one of the characteristics of the band in this period. The focus of the band changed with the introduction of Dave Swarbrick into the line up, who brought a virtuosity on the fiddle and a wealth of traditional tunes. This prompted Hutchings to carry out research in the English Folk Dance &amp; Song Society Library at Cecil Sharp House which resulted in the pioneering classic &quot;Liege and Lief&quot; (1969), seen by many as the foundation of British folk rock. Hutchings was, however, increasingly unhappy with the direction of the band, as most members wanted to return to their older format. As a result, in 1969 he left to focus on more traditional projects.

===Steeleye Span===
Hutchings&#x27; new band Steeleye Span was formed by putting together two established folk duos Tim Hart and Maddy Prior with Terry and Gay Woods. The Woodses departed the band shortly after the release of their debut album, &quot;Hark! The Village Wait&quot; (1970) and were replaced by singer/guitarist Martin Carthy and fiddler Peter Knight. The resulting line-up toured small concert venues, and released two highly regarded albums &quot;Please to See the King&quot; (March 1971) and &quot;Ten Man Mop, or Mr. Reservoir Butler Rides Again&quot; (December 1971), both featuring traditional folk songs and dance tunes with innovative electric arrangements. The bringing in of manager Jo Lustig who pushed for a more commercial sound was probably what prompted the more traditionally minded Carthy and Hutchings to leave the band, which continued with changes of line-up and achieved considerable mainstream success.

===The Albion Country Band, Morris On and Etchingham Steam Band===
By this point the ever active Hutchings already had other projects underway. He had gathered together the first incarnation of what has been the major outlet for his work, the Albion Country Band, to provide backing for his then wife Shirley Collins on her solo collection, No Roses (1971). Some of these personnel co-operated with him for the album Morris On (1972), an affectionate electric tribute to Morris Dancing and others joined him in his next project the Etchingham Steam Band from 1974 to 1976. When this dissolved without releasing a record he returned to the Albion Band in 1976, which, with many bewildering line-up changes, continued to record and tour regularly until 2002.

===Other projects===
Outside the Albion Band, Hutchings has been a frequent guest on the albums of a wide variety of folk artists. He has also continued to pursue a diversity of projects, some alone and some with groupings of more or less stability and continuity. The Morris On project has spawned several sequels across his career:&quot; Son of Morris On&quot; (1976), &quot;Grandson of Morris On&quot; (2002) and &quot;Great Grandson of Morris On&quot; (2004). There have also been several other dance projects including, with John Kirkpatrick and other artists, &quot;The Compleat Dancing Master&quot; (1974), &quot;Rattlebone &amp; Ploughjack&quot; (1976) and &quot;Kickin&#x27; Up the Sawdust&quot; (1977).

In 1984, Hutchings wrote and toured with a one-man show about folk song collector Cecil Sharp, which resulted in the album &quot;An Hour with Cecil Sharp and Ashley Hutchings&quot;, (1986). From this point he often combined writing and narration with his music, as in &quot;By Gloucester Docks I Sat Down and Wept: A Love Story&quot; (1987), which was produced as a live show and album in 1990. He produced an album of spoken-word material as&quot; A Word in Your Ear&quot; (1991) another themed album combining music and narration with Judy Dunlop, as &quot;Sway with Me&quot; (1991). In the late 1980s he toured with the Ashley Hutchings All Stars, leading to a live album, &quot;As You Like It&quot; (1988). With Phil Beer and Chris While he provided the sound track for the TV series &quot;The Ridge Riders&quot; which resulted in an album &quot;Ridgeriders: Songs of the Southern English Landscape&quot; (HTD, 1995), a short tour and another live album &quot;Ridgeriders in Concert&quot; (Talking Elephant, 1996).

In the 1990s he returned to his own musical roots of skiffle and rock and roll, touring and recording with the Ashley Hutchings Big Beat Combo, which resulted in the album &quot;Twangin&#x27; and a Traddin&quot;&#x27; (1994). He also returned to his interest in dance, in addition to continuing the Morris on project, he formed the Ashley Hutchings Dance Band to produce &quot;A Batter Pudding for John Keats&quot; (1996). Other projects include with Malcolm Rowe, the truly eclectic &quot;Folk Your Way to Fitness&quot; (1997), &quot;Street Cries&quot; (2001), and &quot;Human Nature&quot; (2003).

===Rainbow Chasers, Albion Christmas and the Lark Rise Band===
After the suspension of the Albion Band as a full time group in 2002 Hutchings put together another small group of up and coming folk musicians under the title Rainbow Chasers resulting in three albums, &quot;Some Colours Fly&quot; (2005), &quot;A Brilliant Light&quot; (2005) and &quot;Fortune Never Sleeps&quot; (2006). In 2008 he formed The Lark Rise Band to perform and record music from his most successful show, resulting in the album, &quot;Lark Rise Revisited&quot; (2008). He continues to tour in the Christmas season with the Albion Christmas Band and is plans future projects with ex-Albion Band member Ken Nicol.

===Recognition===
His career has been celebrated with the release of archive series, The Guv&#x27;nor and &quot;Burning Bright&quot; (2005) a boxed set of four CDs, which contain many rare and previously unreleased recordings. In 2006 Hutchings received the prestigious Good Tradition trophy at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in recognition of his contributions to the genre and in 2007 he shared the special award for &#x27;Most influential Folk Album of all time&#x27; for &quot;Liege and Lief&quot;.

On 12 December 2013 Hutchings was presented with the Gold Badge Award of the English Folk Dance and Song Society at an Albion Christmas Band concert held at Kings Place, London. He was awarded the MBE in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours of 2015, for services to folk music.

===Personal life===
Hutchings married the British folksinger Shirley Collins in 1971 but divorced around 1978. She has stated that she lost her ability to sing for nearly four decades because of his infidelity.

He and Judy Dunlop have a son, Blair Dunlop, born on 11 February 1992.

<text>Madeleine Edith Prior MBE (born 14 August 1947) is an English folk rock singer, best known as the lead vocalist of Steeleye Span. She was born in Blackpool and moved to St Albans in her teens. Her father, Allan Prior, was co-creator of the police drama &quot;Z-Cars&quot;. She was married to Steeleye bass guitarist Rick Kemp, and their daughter, Rose Kemp, is also a singer. Their son, Alex Kemp, is also a guitarist and has deputised for his father playing bass guitar for Steeleye Span. 

She was part of the singing duo &#x27;Mac &amp; Maddy&#x27;, with Mac MacLeod. She then performed with Tim Hart and recorded two albums with him, before they helped to found the group Steeleye Span, in 1969. She left Steeleye Span in 1997, but returned in 2002, and has toured with them since. With June Tabor she was the singing duo Silly Sisters. She toured with the Carnival Band, in 2007, and with Giles Lewin and Hannah James, in 2012 and 2013. She has released singles and albums as a solo artist, with these bands and in several collaborations. She runs an Arts Centre called Stones Barn, in Bewcastle, in Cumbria, which offers residential courses.

==Early life==
Born in Blackpool, Prior moved in her teens to St Albans, where she befriended the young Donovan Leitch and Mac MacLeod in &quot;The Cock&quot; pub. She later formed a duo with MacLeod called &#x27;Mac &amp; Maddy&#x27;. She became a roadie for visiting American musicians, including Reverend Gary Davis. They gave her useful advice about singing English folk songs instead of American songs. Her father, Allan Prior, was co-creator of the police drama &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, and wrote &quot;Stookie&quot;, a 6-part series for television, about a boy with his arm in a sling. Maddy sang the title song, which was released as a single in 1985. It reappeared on the Steeleye Span album &quot;A Rare Collection 1972 – 1996&quot;.

==Singing career==
After a brief stint with Mac MacLeod in &#x27;Mac &amp; Maddy&#x27; (another act formed at &quot;The Cock&quot; pub), by 1966 she began performing with Tim Hart, another St Albans resident, and together they recorded two albums before becoming founding members of Steeleye Span in 1969. They were the backbone of the group until the early 1980s when ill-health forced Hart into semi-retirement. Prior plays the tambourine, spoons and ukulele, and always gives a sprightly performance of her individual dances. In 1974 Ralph McTell wrote &quot;Maddy Dances&quot; in her honour, included on his album &quot;Easy&quot;.

Prior married bassist Rick Kemp, though they have since divorced. The singer Rose Kemp is their daughter.

Prior has recorded session work, albums of her own songs and eclectic styles from medieval (with The Carnival Band), through British folk rock — Steeleye Span and Maddy Prior appeared on television with a regular BBC 4 programme &quot;Electric Folk&quot; — prog-rock and traditional songs, including session work on Mike Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Incantations&quot;. She left Steeleye Span in 1997 but returned in 2002. The 1999 album &quot;The Journey&quot; was recorded in 1995, when Maddy was still in the band, but not released until four years later. She was also one half of the duo Silly Sisters, which helped to boost June Tabor&#x27;s career.

Since 2003 Prior has run and hosted an Arts Centre called Stones Barn in Cumbria. Working with fellow singers and performers like Abbie Lathe and daughter Rose Kemp, Prior has offered residential courses focusing on singing, meditation, cookery and performance. Other events, hosted by other teachers, include classical Indian dances, painting and drumming. Prior campaigns on behalf of the charity Cancer Research UK.

In 1983, Maddy Prior became the namesake for Madelyne Pryor of the X-Men, created by Chris Claremont and Paul Smith. The band was directly referenced five years after Pryor&#x27;s first appearance in the comics in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #238 with Pryor&#x27;s child self singing a line from &quot;Gone to America&quot;, one of Steeleye Span&#x27;s biggest hits. Claremont had previously named a one-shot character &quot;Maddy Pryor&quot; in &quot;Avengers Annual&quot; #10 (1981).

==Recent tours and albums==
Maddy Prior took to the road with The Carnival Band in May 2007 for their &quot;Music for Tavern and Chapel&quot; tour. They celebrated the 300th anniversary of one of the key influences on their work, Charles Wesley. She made a guest appearance with The Levellers at the Solfest Festival in Cumbria in August 2007. On recent albums Troy Donockley has been a co-producer.

In December 2007 the album &quot;Ringing The Changes&quot; was issued. It is a collection of songs written by the band. In 2008 Maddy Prior appeared at the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Electric Proms&quot;. Steeleye Span toured the Eastern US, Australia and the UK beginning in 2009.

With Giles Lewin and Hannah James, Prior completed two successful UK tours, in the spring and autumn of 2012, with a third, in autumn 2013.

In November and December 2013 Prior toured with Steeleye Span, on the Wintersmith Tour, following the release in October of their album Wintersmith, a collaborative project based on the novel of the same name by Terry Pratchett.

A short tour with The Carnival Band in November and December, featuring carols and seasonal music, has become an annual fixture for Prior since 1984. The 2024 tour (the 40th annual tour) will be the final tour. 

==Awards==
In 2001 Maddy Prior was awarded the MBE for services to folk music.

In 2014 she received an Honorary Fellowship from the University of Cumbria.

<text> (; Foochow Romanized: Hók-chiăng; also romanized as Hokchia) is a county-level city of Fujian Province, China, it is under the administration of the prefecture-level city of Fuzhou.

==Geography==

Fuqing is located on the north-central section of the coast of Fujian, south of the urban area of Fuzhou and north of Putian. It is the southernmost administrative division of Fuzhou on the mainland and is the only county-level city under the administration of Fuzhou. To the northwest of Fuqing lies Yongtai County, on its northern border is Minhou County, and to its northeast is the district of Changle. The entire southwestern land border is shared with Hanjiang, Putian. The territory of Fuqing also includes over 100 islands, and is connected by road to the major islands of Pingtan County.

The highest point of Fuqing is Guya Peak (), which is situated on its border with Minhou County to the north, and has a height of above sea level. The northern part of the county-level city is situated in the valley of the Long River (), which includes the city&#x27;s central urban area. 

Fuqing has a long indented coastline on the Taiwan Strait, mostly consisting of rocky shores. A prominent part of its territory is the Longgao Peninsula (), named for two of its major towns, Longtian and Gaoshan. This peninsula also forms two major bays: Fuqing Bay () to its north, and Xinghua Bay () to its south. The jagged coastline has given rise to a multitude of harbors and ports, including Haikou, situated at the mouth of the Lóng.

==Overseas Fuqing==
Fuqing, as well as most of the rest of Fujian, is known for its large number of emigrants, or &quot;huaqiao&quot;. The first wave of emigration started in late 19th century; most common destinations during that time were Indonesia, Singapore, and East Malaysia. Some became among the richest men in Southeast Asia, e.g. Sudono Salim (Salim Group), Hendra Rahardja, Rachman Halim (Gudang Garam), Henry Kwee Hian Liong (Pontiac Land Group).

Overseas Fuqingese assembled into associations for mutual support, including the International Association of Fuqing, Perkumpulan Fuqing (Indonesia), and Singapore Futsing Association.

==Local dialect==
Fuqing has its own dialect (, Bàng-uâ-cê: &quot;Hók-chiăng-uâ&quot;, IPA in the local dialect: //), classified as part of the Houguan branch of Eastern Min. It is closely related to the Fuzhou dialect, and the two are mutually intelligible to quite a high extent, although not completely. Due to the hilly terrain and the isolation between villages, there is a large amount of dialectal variation.
Songs sung in Fuqing dialect are available online.

Most of its people can also speak Mandarin, which is used in schools, businesses, and to communicate with people from different parts of the province. 

There are also scattered villages that speak predominantly Southern Min varieties, with their populations coming from the Jinjiang, Zhangpu and Hui&#x27;an, among other areas of southern Fujian. However, their dialects have diverged significantly from the mainstream Hokkien varieties, such as in the use of // as a phoneme, and the use of vocabulary items closer to that of the Eastern Min varieties, such as (BUC: &quot;cóng&quot;, IPA: //) instead of (POJ: &quot;súi&quot;) for &quot;beautiful, good-looking&quot;. 

In addition, there are villages that speak a form of Putian dialect, mostly near the border with Putian, with the distinctive use of // instead of // or // more common in the Fuqing dialect.

==Regional foods==
Fuqing is located in the coastal hills, subtropical climate, warm and rainy, but the river is short and shallow. Rich in species while not rich in harvest. Therefore, the important staple food in Fuqing is sweet potato. Non-staple food is dominated by various marine food. Many traditional snacks are made from sweet potato and seafood.

Guangbing (): Guangbing is a bread product that is baked and shaped like a sesame-seeded burger bun top. In 1562, the Japanese invaded Fujian province. General Qi Jiguang was charged to drive the invaders out of Fujian. In order not to let the meal time slow down their marching speed, General Qi invented a kind of bread which was shaped into a ring at that time, so his soldiers could wear a string of those breads around their neck. After the victory, the recipe of this bread product was spread throughout the province and named Guangbing after General Qi. Nowadays, there is no longer a hole in the center of a Guangbing, and there are various kinds of Guangbing developed in different areas in Fujian province, which don’t look the same. Fuqing Guangbing is made of the flour, sugar and salt which are all locally produced, as well as the excellent Fuqing sesame seeds, which are very big and taste better than ordinary small sesame seeds. Guangbing was handed down by people to commemorate Qi Jiguang&#x27;s achievements, which has been used and developed to this day. The people of Fuqing not only passed down the making method of Guangbing, but also passed down the culture to make ritual offerings, Guangbing, to their ancestors.

Oyster Patties (): Oyster patties are a fried snack made of rice flour (pulp), soya bean powder (pulp), oyster, pork, cabbage and seaweed.

Fish Ball (): Fuqing fish balls are balls of fish mince made from eels, mackerel or freshwater fish, and sweet potato flour mixed evenly to make its wrappers. Inside, they contain the mince of pork or shrimp.

Sweet Potato Ball (): Sweet potato balls have a wrapper made of starch and sweet potato flour. The mince is made of oyster, seaweed and pork. Sweet potato balls represent family reunion.

Seaweed Cake (): Seaweed cakes are made of flour and seaweed, traditionally using a stone oven.

==Festival and special customs==
Fuqing has some special customs different from other areas in China, which reflects the local history and culture. Fuqing customs have four obvious influences:
(1) the legacy of ancient Yue;
(2) ancient Central Plains culture; 
(3) religion, especially Buddhism and Taoism; 
(4) in modern times, foreign culture

=== Spring Festival ===
Unlike other areas of China, the top part of the couplets traditionally put up during the Chinese New Year are white, not red. It is said that in 1562 on New Year&#x27;s Eve, when the Japanese invaded Fuqing, people had to escape shortly after putting up the Spring Festival couplets. Upon returning after General Qi Jiguang&#x27;s victory, people changed the couplets from red, which represents joy and celebration, into green or added white on the top to mourn for their family and friends who had died in the conflict.

On the first day of the new year, people in Fuqing like many across the Eastern Fujian region commonly eat xianmian (), an extra-thin wheat noodle, with the addition of two duck eggs to represent longevity. In the local language, the term for &quot;duck egg&quot; (, BUC: &quot;ák-lâung&quot;) has a pronunciation similar or the same as that of &quot;suppress chaos&quot; (, BUC: &quot;ák-lâung&quot;); thus the eggs represent peace and stability. The dish is often given the name &#x27;peace noodles&#x27; (). A similar combination is also commonly eaten on birthdays, where it is dubbed &#x27;longevity noodles&#x27; ().

The second day of the new year is the day to visit and comfort the family that have lost their family members in the previous year (, alternatively in ). On that day, people thus avoid visiting families where nobody died in the previous year, regarding such a visit as unlucky.

=== Lantern Festival ===
The main customs of the Lantern Festival include eating yuanxiao, dragon and lion dance, Shehuo, lantern riddles, stilt, boat, row, and walking on the Li Bridge.

=== Winter Solstice Festival ===
The most important part of the winter solstice festival is making glutinous rice balls and preparing the red-orange and ten pairs of chopsticks. The red-orange stands for blessing and the ten pairs of chopsticks stand for family reunion. People also light a pair of red candles to represent prosperity.

=== Tomb-sweeping Day ===
The essential part of the Qingming Festival is to offer sacrifices that are often made from paper, as well as fire incense and firecrackers in front of the tomb. After sweeping the tomb, people take some pine branches or flowers back home for good luck.

== Transportation ==
Fuqing has two railway stations. Fuqing railway station was opened on April 26, 2010, on the Fuzhou–Xiamen railway, and is situated south of the urban area. A second railway station, Fuqing West railway station on the Fuzhou–Xiamen high-speed railway, was opened to the public on September 28, 2023.

The principal means of public transportation within the city is the bus system, with most of the towns of the peninsula also being served.

<text>Morchella esculenta (commonly known as common morel, morel, yellow morel, true morel, morel mushroom, and sponge morel) is a species of fungus in the family Morchellaceae of the Ascomycota. It is one of the most readily recognized of all the edible mushrooms and highly sought after. Each fruit body begins as a tightly compressed, grayish sponge with lighter ridges, and expands to form a large yellowish sponge with large pits and ridges raised on a large white stem. The pitted yellow-brown caps measure broad by tall, and are fused to the stem at its lower margin, forming a continuous hollow. The pits are rounded and irregularly arranged. The hollow stem is typically long by thick, and white to yellow. The fungus fruits under hardwoods and conifers during a short period in the spring, depending on the weather, and is also associated with old orchards, woods and disturbed grounds.

==Description==
The cap is pale brownish cream, yellow to tan or pale brown to grayish brown. The edges of the ridges are usually lighter than the pits, and somewhat oval in outline, sometimes bluntly cone-shaped with a rounded top or more elongate. Caps are hollow, attached to the stem at the lower edge, and typically about broad by tall. The flesh is brittle. The stem is white to pallid or pale yellow, hollow, and straight or with a club-shaped or bulbous base. It is finely granular overall, somewhat ridged, generally about long by thick. In age it may have brownish stains near the base. It has a passing resemblance to the common stinkhorn (&quot;Phallus impudicus&quot;), for which it is sometimes mistaken. Yellow morels are often found near wooded areas. Centipedes sometimes make their home inside these morels; infested morels usually have a hole in the top.

===Microscopic characteristics===
The spores range from white to cream to slightly yellow in deposit, although a spore print may be difficult to obtain given the shape of the fruit body. The spores are formed in asci lining the pits—the ridges are sterile. They are ellipsoidal, smooth, thin-walled, translucent (hyaline), and measure 17.5–21.9 by 8.8–11.0 μm. The asci are eight-spored, 223–300 by 19–20 μm, cylindrical, and hyaline. The paraphyses are filamentous, cylindrical, 5.8–8.8 μm wide, and hyaline.

The hyphae of the stem are interwoven, hyaline, and measure 5.8–9.4 μm wide. The surface hyphae are inflated, spherical to pear-shaped, 22–44 μm wide, covered by a network of interwoven hyphae 11–16.8 μm wide with recurved cylindrical hyphal ends.

===Development===
Fruit bodies have successfully been grown in the laboratory. R. Ower was the first to describe the developmental stages of ascomata grown in a controlled chamber. This was followed by in-depth cytological studies by Thomas Volk and Leonard (1989, 1990). To study the morel life cycle they followed the development of ascoma fruiting in association with tuberous begonias (&quot;Begonia tuberhybrida&quot;), from very small primordia to fully developed fruit bodies.

Young fruit bodies begin development in the form of a dense knot of hyphae, when suitable conditions of moisture and nutrient availability conditions have been reached. Hyphal knots are underground and cup-shaped for some time, but later emerge from the soil and develop into a stalked fruiting body. Further growth makes the hymenium convex with the asci facing towards the outer side. Because of the unequal growth of the surface of the hymenium, it becomes folded to form many ridges and depressions, resulting in the sponge or honeycomb appearance.

=== Similar species ===

&quot;Morchella esculenta&quot; is probably the most familiar of the morels. In contrast to &quot;M. angusticeps&quot; and its relatives, the caps are light-colored throughout development, especially the ridges, which remain paler than the pits. &quot;M. crassipes&quot; is sometimes confused with &quot;M. esculenta&quot;. According to Smith (1975), the two are distinct, but young forms of &quot;M. crassipes&quot; are difficult to separate from &quot;M. esculenta&quot;. The two are similar in color, but &quot;M. crassipes&quot; is larger, often has thin ridges, and sometimes has a stem base that is enlarged and longitudinally grooved.

Stinkhorns (esp. &quot;Phallus impudicus&quot;) have also been confused with morels, but specimens of the former have a volva at the base of the stem, and are covered with gleba—a slimy, foul-smelling spore mass.

See also &quot;Gyromitra esculenta&quot;, which is similar in appearance but poisonous.

==Taxonomy==
The fungus was originally named &quot;Phallus esculentus&quot; by Carl Linnaeus in his &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; (1753), and given its current name by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries in 1801.

&quot;Morchella esculenta&quot; is commonly known by various names: morel, common morel, true morel, morel mushroom, yellow morel, sponge morel, Molly Moocher, haystack, and dryland fish. In Nepal it is known as &quot;Guchi chyau&quot;. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin &quot;esculenta&quot;, meaning &quot;edible&quot;.

The scientific name &quot;Morchella esculenta&quot; has been applied to many similar yellow morels throughout the world. In 2014 Richard et al. used DNA analysis to restrict the &quot;M. esculenta&quot; name to a single species of yellow morel commonly found in Europe and also reported from China. Other species of yellow morel, including those in North America, have received new scientific names.

==Distribution and habitat==

Fruit bodies are sometimes solitary, but more often in groups, on the ground in a variety of habitats. A preference for soil with a limestone base (alkaline) has been noted, but they have also been found in acid soils.
The mushroom is usually found in early spring, in forests, orchards, yards, gardens and sometimes in recently burned areas. In North America, it is sometimes referred to as the &quot;May mushroom&quot; due to its consistent fruiting in that month, but the time of fruiting varies locally, from February to July. It is typically the last morel species to fruit in locales where more than one species are found. For example, in northern Canada and in cooler mountainous regions, morels typically do not appear until June. It has been suggested that the springtime fruiting may be due to their ability to grow at low temperatures to the exclusion of competition, a conclusion later corroborated by experiments correlating spore germination to soil temperatures.

One author suggests the acronym PETSBASH may be used to remember the trees associated with morels: pine, elm, tulip, sassafras, beech, ash, sycamore, and hickory.

In North America, it is widely distributed, but especially common in eastern North America and the Midwest. David Arora notes that &quot;large crops can also be found around the bases of dying (but not quite dead) elms attacked by Dutch elm disease.&quot; The species has been named state mushroom of Minnesota, and was the first state mushroom of any state.

It can also be found in Brazil and Bulgaria.
In Jammu and Kashmir wild mushrooms, locally known as Himalayan wild mushroom, Gucchi, &quot;Morchella conica&quot; and &quot;Morchella esculenta&quot;, are gathered and supplied as medical remedy.

==Cultivation==
Due to the mushroom&#x27;s prized fruit bodies, several attempts have been made to grow the fungus in culture. In 1901, Repin reported successfully obtaining fruit bodies in a cave in which cultures had been established in flower pots nine years previously in 1892.

Mycologist Taylor Piercefield developed a method using beds of hardwood tree saplings which would be inoculated with mycelium, concentrating on the symbiotic relationship of Morchella esculenta. Later, once the mycelium network had been fully developed, the beds would be treated with potassium hydroxide to replicate the pH conditions found in soil after a forest fire. This method resulted in large, mature fruits, but was not commercially viable on a large scale. More recently, small scale commercial growers have had success growing morels by using partially shaded rows of mulched wood. The rows of mulch piles are inoculated with morel mushroom spores in a solution of water and molasses which are poured over the piles of mulch and then they are allowed to grow undisturbed for several weeks. A solution of wood ashes mixed in water and diluted is subsequently poured over the rows of wood mulch which triggers fruiting of the morels. Morels are known to appear after fires and the alkaline conditions produced by wood ash mixed with water initiate fruit body formation for most species of morels.

==Uses==

===Edibility===

&quot;Morchella esculenta&quot;, like all morels, are among the most highly prized of all edible mushrooms. Raw morels have a gastrointestinal irritant, hydrazine (this has never been found in morel samples however it is assumed), but parboiling or blanching before consumption will remove it. Old fruit bodies that show signs of decay may be poisonous. The mushrooms may be fried in butter or baked after being stuffed with meats and vegetables. The mushrooms may also be dried by threading the caps onto string and hanging them in the sun; this process is said to concentrate the flavour. One study determined the main nutritional components to be as follows (on a dry weight basis): protein 32.7%, fat 2.0%, fiber 17.6%, ash 9.7%, and carbohydrates 38.0%.

In one isolated case in Germany, six people were reported to have developed neurologic effects between 6–12 hours after consumption. The effects included ataxia and visual disturbances, and lasted up to a day before disappearing without enduring effects.

===Bioactive compounds===
Both the fruit bodies and the mycelia of &quot;M. esculenta&quot; contain an uncommon amino acid, &quot;cis&quot;-3-amino--proline; this amino acid does not appear to be protein bound. In addition to &quot;M. esculenta&quot;, the amino acid is known to exist only in &quot;M. conica&quot; and &quot;M. crassipes.&quot;

=== Industrial applications; solid state-fermentation ===
Solid-state fermentation is an industrial process to produce enzymes and to upgrade the values of existing foods, especially foods from East Asia. Solid-state fermentation is a process whereby an insoluble substrate is fermented with sufficient moisture but without free water. Solid-state fermentation, unlike that of slurry state, requires no complex fermentation controls and has many advantages over submerged liquid fermentation. &quot;M. esculenta&quot; has shown promise in degrading starch and upgrading the nutritional value of cornmeal during solid-state fermentation.

&quot;M. esculenta&quot; mycelia is able to bind to and inhibit the effects of furanocoumarins, chemicals found in grapefruit that inhibit human cytochrome p450 enzymes and are responsible for the &quot;grapefruit/drug&quot; interaction phenomenon.

<text>The Agaricaceae are a family of basidiomycete fungi and include the genus &quot;Agaricus&quot;, as well as basidiomycetes previously classified in the families Tulostomataceae, Lepiotaceae, and Lycoperdaceae.

==Taxonomy==
The family Agaricaceae was published by French botanist François Fulgis Chevallier in 1826. It is named after the type genus &quot;Agaricus&quot;, originally circumscribed by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 work &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;. In his authoritative 1986 classification of the Agaricales, Rolf Singer divided the Agaricaceae into four tribes distinguished largely by spore color: &quot;Leucocoprineae&quot;, &quot;Agariceae&quot;, &quot;Lepioteae&quot;, and &quot;Cystodermateae&quot;. Genera once classified in the families Tulostomataceae, Battarreaceae, Lycoperdaceae, and Mycenastraceae have since been moved to the Agaricaceae based on molecular phylogenetics studies. According to a standard reference text, the Agaricaceae contains 85 genera and 1340 species.

==Description==
Agaricaceae species use a wide variety of fruit body morphology. Although the pileate form (i.e., with a cap and stipe) is predominant, gasteroid and secotioid forms are known. In pileate species, the gills are typically thin, and free from attachment to the stipe. Caps are to smooth, and range from roughly flat to umbonate. They typically have a centrally attached stipe and a membrane-like partial veil. The species formerly classified in the family Lycoperdaceae are also known as the &quot;true puffballs&quot;. Their fruiting bodies are round and are composed of a tough skin surrounding a mass of spores. When they mature, the skin splits open and they release their spores.

The spore print color of Agaricaceae species is highly variable, ranging from white to greenish to ochraceous to pink or sepia; rusty-brown or cinnamon brown colours are absent. Microscopically, the spore surface ranges from smooth to ornamented, and the presence of a germ pore is variable. Amyloidity (i.e. sensitivity to staining in Melzer&#x27;s reagent) is also variable. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are usually small, four-spored, and may have interspersed cystidia.

==Genera==

The extinct genus &quot;Coprinites&quot; is one of four known Agaricaceae genera in the fossil record. Others include &quot;Aureofungus&quot;, &quot;Protomycena&quot;, and &quot;Archaeomarasmius&quot;. &quot;Archaeomarasmius leggeti&quot;, from Atlantic Coastal Plain amber, is 90–94 Ma); the other fossil genera are from Dominican amber and date to 15–20 Ma.

The family currently includes the following genera:

*&quot;Agaricus&quot;
*&quot;Barcheria&quot;
*&quot;Bovista&quot;
*&quot;Calbovista&quot; previously in family Lycoperdaceae.
*&quot;Calvatia&quot;
*&quot;Chamaemyces&quot;
*&quot;Chlorophyllum&quot;
*&quot;Clarkeinda&quot;
*&quot;Coniolepiota&quot;
*†&quot;Coprinites&quot;
*&quot;Coprinus&quot;
*&quot;Cystoagaricus&quot;
*&quot;Cystolepiota&quot;
*&quot;Disciseda&quot;
*&quot;Endoptychum&quot;
*&quot;Eriocybe&quot;
*&quot;Gyrophragmium&quot;
*&quot;Handkea&quot;
*&quot;Heinemannomyces&quot;
*&quot;Hymenagaricus&quot;
*&quot;Lepiota&quot;
*&quot;Leucoagaricus&quot;
*&quot;Leucocoprinus&quot;
*&quot;Lycoperdon&quot;
*&quot;Macrolepiota&quot;
*&quot;Melanophyllum&quot;
*&quot;Micropsalliota&quot;
*&quot;Montagnea&quot;
*&quot;Podaxis&quot;
*&quot;Ripartitella&quot;
*&quot;Rugosospora&quot;
*&quot;Sericeomyces&quot;
*&quot;Smithiomyces&quot;
*&quot;Tulostoma&quot;
*&quot;Verrucospora&quot;
==Ecology==
The &quot;Agaricaceae&quot; are widely distributed. Most species are saprobic and prefer grassland and woodland habitats. Genera &quot;Leucoagaricus&quot; and &quot;Leucocoprinus&quot; are known to be cultivated by fungus-growing ants in ant-fungus mutualism.

==Economic significance==
The genus &quot;Agaricus&quot; includes some species that are cultivated commercially throughout the world. The common &quot;button mushroom&quot;, &quot;Agaricus bisporus&quot;, is the most widely cultivated edible mushroom. &quot;Agaricus blazei&quot; is a well-known medicinal mushroom used for a number of therapeutic and medicinal purposes. Several species are poisonous, such as some &quot;Lepiota&quot;, &quot;Agaricus sect. Xanthodermatei&quot; and &quot;Chlorophyllum&quot; species .

<text>The Russulaceae are a diverse family of fungi in the order Russulales, with roughly 1,900 known species and a worldwide distribution. They comprise the brittlegills and the milk-caps, well-known mushroom-forming fungi that include some edible species. These gilled mushrooms are characterised by the brittle flesh of their fruitbodies.

In addition to these typical agaricoid forms, the family contains species with fruitbodies that are laterally striped (pleurotoid), closed (secotioid or gasteroid), or crust-like (corticioid). Molecular phylogenetics has demonstrated close affinities between species with very different fruitbody types and has discovered new, distinct lineages.

An important group of root-symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi in forests and shrublands around the world includes &quot;Lactifluus&quot;, &quot;Multifurca&quot;, &quot;Russula&quot;, and &quot;Lactarius&quot;. The crust-forming genera &quot;Boidinia&quot;, &quot;Gloeopeniophorella&quot;, and &quot;Pseudoxenasma&quot;, all wood-decay fungi, have basal positions in the family.

==Systematics and taxonomy==
The family Russulaceae was first validly named in 1907 by Dutch botanist Johannes Paulus Lotsy, who included three genera: &quot;Russula&quot;, &quot;Lactarius&quot;, and &quot;Russulina&quot; (now considered a synonym of &quot;Russula&quot;). He emphasised features such as the granular flesh, thick gills, spiny spores, and milky hyphae and rounded cells (sphaerocytes). A prior usage of &quot;Russulariées&quot; by French mycologist Ernst Roze in 1876 is not considered a valid publication, since the proper Latin termination for the family rank specified in article 18.4 of the nomenclature code was not used.

Synonyms of Russulaceae include: Ernst Albert Gäumann&#x27;s Lactariaceae (1926), Fernand Moreau&#x27;s Asterosporaceae (1953), and David Pegler and Thomas Young&#x27;s Elasmomycetaceae (1979). The latter family was proposed to contain species with statismosporic (non-forcibly discharged) and symmetric spores, including the gasteroid genera &quot;Elasmomyces&quot;, &quot;Gymnomyces&quot;, &quot;Martellia&quot;, and &quot;Zelleromyces&quot;. Calonge and Martín reduced the Elasmomycetaceae to synonymy with the Russulaceae when molecular analysis confirmed the close genetic relationship between the gasteroid and agaricoid genera.

===Placement of the family===
Historically, the gilled mushrooms of the family Russulaceae were classified with other gilled species in the order Agaricales, but microscopical studies of spore and fruitbody flesh features raised the possibility that they were more closely related with certain &quot;lower fungi&quot; presenting nongilled, crust-like fruitbodies. The use of molecular phylogenetics confirmed that these morphologically diverse fungi form a distinct lineage, first termed the &quot;russuloid clade&quot; and today classified as order Russulales in the class Agaricomycetes. The family&#x27;s sister group within the order appears to be the crust-like Gloeocystidiellaceae.

===Internal systematics===
A 2008 molecular phylogenetic study clarified the relationships among the mushroom-forming species of the family. The authors demonstrated the existence of four distinct lineages of gilled mushrooms, which led to the description of &quot;Multifurca&quot; as a new genus separated from &quot;Russula&quot; and the segregation of &quot;Lactifluus&quot; from &quot;Lactarius&quot;.

Genera with closed fruitbodies within the family are form taxa instead of natural groups: &quot;Arcangeliella&quot;, &quot;Gastrolactarius&quot;, and &quot;Zelleromyces&quot; are phylogenetically part of &quot;Lactarius&quot;, while &quot;Cystangium&quot;, &quot;Elasmomyces&quot;, &quot;Gymnomyces&quot;, &quot;Macowanites&quot;, and &quot;Martellia&quot; belong to &quot;Russula&quot;. Nevertheless, some of these genus names are still in use, as many of the concerned species have not yet formally been synonymised with &quot;Lactarius&quot; or &quot;Russula&quot;.

The crust-like genera &quot;Boidinia&quot;, &quot;Gloeopeniophorella&quot;, and &quot;Pseudoxenasma&quot;, formerly placed in the Corticiaceae or Gloeocystidiellaceae, are now classified in the Russulaceae and basal to the clade of mushroom-forming species described above. Studies have so far failed to clearly circumscribe and place these genera within the family. &quot;Boidinia&quot; in its current extent is polyphyletic, with some species not falling into the Russulaceae.

===Species diversity===
Altogether, the Russulaceae comprise around 1,900 accepted species. &quot;Russula&quot; is by far the largest genus with c. 1100 species, &quot;Lactarius&quot; has c. 550, &quot;Lactifluus&quot; c. 120, &quot;Boidinia&quot; 13, &quot;Multifurca&quot; 6, &quot;Gloeopeniophorella&quot; 6, and &quot;Pseudoxenasma&quot; 1 species. Closed-fruitbody species not yet synonymised with &quot;Lactarius&quot; or &quot;Russula&quot; (&quot;see above&quot;) account for some 150 species.

New species in the Russulaceae continue to be described from various regions, such as the US, Guyana, Brazil, Patagonia, Togo, Sri Lanka, or Thailand. It has been estimated that the real number of &quot;Russula&quot; species in North America alone (currently around 400 described) might be as high as 2000. Cryptic species may increase true diversity: some morphologically well-defined species, especially in &quot;Lactifluus&quot;, have been shown to actually encompass several phylogenetic species.

==Description==
===Macroscopic characteristics===

Three major types of fruitbodies occur in the Russulaceae: &quot;agaricoid&quot; and &quot;pleurotoid&quot; forms with a cap, gills, and a stipe; forms with closed (&quot;gasteroid&quot;) or partially closed (&quot;secotioid&quot;) fruitbodies, and &quot;corticioid&quot;, crust-like forms.

The &quot;agaricoid&quot; species in &quot;Lactarius&quot;, &quot;Lactifluus&quot;, &quot;Multifurca&quot;, and &quot;Russula&quot; are readily distinguished from other gilled mushrooms by the consistency of their flesh, which is granular, brittle and breaks easily, somewhat like a piece of chalk. Russulaceae never have a volva, but a partial veil can be found in some tropical species. Gills are adnate to decurrent, and the colour of the spore print ranges from white to ochre or orange (with the brown-spored &quot;Lactarius chromospermus&quot; as an exception).

Caps can be dull to very colourful, the latter especially in &quot;Russula&quot;; their size ranges from 17 mm diameter or less in &quot;Russula campinensis&quot; to in &quot;Lactifluus vellereus&quot;. Concentrically ringed (zonate) caps occur in all &quot;Multifurca&quot; and several &quot;Lactarius&quot; species. Laterally striped (&quot;pleurotoid&quot;) fruitbodies exist in some, mainly tropical &quot;Lactifluus&quot; and &quot;Russula&quot; species. Taste is a distinguishing characteristic in many species, from mild to very acrid. A conspicuous feature of the &quot;milk-caps&quot; in &quot;Lactarius, Lactifluus&quot;, and &quot;Multifurca furcata&quot; is the latex or &quot;milk&quot; their fruitbodies exude when bruised.

The &quot;secotioid&quot; and &quot;gasteroid&quot; species in &quot;Lactarius&quot; and &quot;Russula&quot; are derived from agaricoid forms. Secotioid species still have a stipe but the cap does not open fully, while in gasteroid species, fruitbodies are completely closed and the stipe is reduced; in both cases, the spore-bearing structure is made up of convoluted gills that are more or less crowded and anastomosed. These closed-fruitbody species represent a continuum of secotioid to gasteroid, above-ground to below-ground fruitbodies, with spores forcibly discharged or not. Secotioid or gasteroid &quot;Lactarius&quot; exude latex just like their agaricoid relatives.

The &quot;corticioid&quot; species of &quot;Boidinia&quot;, &quot;Gloeopeniophorella&quot;, and &quot;Pseudoxenasma&quot; develop crust-like fruitbodies with a smooth, porous, or flaky surface and grow on tree logs or dead branches.
===Microscopic characteristics===
All Russulaceae, including the corticioid species, are characterised by spherical to elliptic basidiospores with a faint to very distinct (e.g. warty, spiny, or crested) ornamentation that stains bluish-black with Melzer&#x27;s reagent (an amyloid stain reaction). Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are usually club-shaped and four-spored. Russulaceae species do not have clamp connections.

Characteristic cells with an oily content (&quot;gloeocystidia&quot;) are found in the hymenium. In Russulaceae, these show a positive colour reaction when treated with sulfoaldehydes (sulfovanillin is mostly used). They are also present in the hyphal sheath of ectomycorrhizal roots colonised by Russulaceae.

The feature responsible for the brittle fruitbody structure in the mushroom-forming species are globular cells, called &quot;sphaerocytes&quot; or &quot;sphaerocysts&quot;, that compose the flesh (&quot;trama&quot;) alongside the usual hyphae. Sometimes, these cells are clustered, and the position and arrangement of these clusters differs among genera.

Another particular trama cell type are &quot;lactiferous&quot; hyphae (also &quot;lactifers&quot;). These are hyphae carrying the &quot;milk&quot; or &quot;latex&quot; exuded by the milk-caps; they react positively with sulfoaldehydes, form an abundantly branched system in the trama and end as &quot;pseudocystidia&quot; in the hymenium. In general, only &quot;Lactarius&quot;, &quot;Lactifluus&quot; and &quot;Multifurca furcata&quot; possess lactifers. In &quot;Russula&quot;, similar hyphae can sometimes be observed in the trama, but these are not as abundantly branched as real lactifers and do not extend into the hymenium as pseudocystidia. This traditional distinction line between the &quot;milk-caps&quot; and &quot;Russula&quot; is however less evident in some tropical species presenting intermediate states.

===Genera distinction===
Some characteristics of the mushroom-forming genera (marked with * below) can be less obvious or absent in tropical species. Distinguishing between &quot;Lactarius&quot; and &quot;Lactifluus&quot; based on morphology alone is quite difficult, as clear synapomorphies for both genera have yet to be identified. Most field guides treat the two genera together, often because &quot;Lactifluus&quot; is not yet recognised as a separate genus.
* &quot;Boidinia&quot;: corticioid; loose texture; surface smooth, with pores, or flaky; spores spherical with spiny to warty ornamentation. Note that the genus is polyphyletic and needs to be redefined.
* &quot;Gloeopeniophorella&quot;: corticioid; surface almost smooth; hyphae without clamp connections; thick-walled cystidia (&quot;metuloids&quot;) and gloeocystidia present; spores with wrinkled (rugose) ornamentation.
* &quot;Lactarius&quot;: agaricoid or gasteroid; exuding latex*; caps sometimes zonate, viscose or glutinate, but never annulate; rarely thick-walled cells in cuticles of the cap (&quot;pileipellis&quot;) and the stipe (&quot;stipitipellis&quot;) and sphaerocytes in the gills.
* &quot;Lactifluus&quot;: agaricoid or pleurotoid; exuding latex*; caps never zonate, viscose or glutinate, but sometimes annulate; thick-walled cells in cap and stipe cuticles; often sphaerocytes in the gill trama.
* &quot;Multifurca&quot;: agaricoid; caps zonate (also visible in cut through trama); gills regularly forked; only &quot;M. furcata&quot; exuding latex; spore print orange; spores very small; microscopical trama and hymenium features very variable.
* &quot;Pseudoxenasma&quot;: corticioid; wax-like texture; gloeocystidia with spherical apical appendices; basidia developing laterally on hyphae (&quot;pleurobasidia&quot;); spores broadly ellipsoid to roughly spherical, with warty ornamentation.
* &quot;Russula&quot;: agaricoid, gasteroid or pleurotoid; never exuding latex; caps often brightly coloured with stipe and gills much paler; caps not zonate*; spore print white, cream, ochre, or orange; no true lactiferous hyphae*; sphaerocytes abundant in gill, cap, and stipe trama.

==Distribution==
The Russulaceae as a whole have a worldwide distribution, but patterns differ among genera. &quot;Russula&quot; is the most widespread, found in North, Central and South America, Europe, temperate and tropical Asia, Africa, and Australasia. It is the only Russulaceae genus that occurs in the &quot;Nothofagus&quot; zone of temperate South America.

&quot;Lactarius&quot; is mainly known from the north temperate zone, but some species also occur in tropical Asia and Africa. &quot;Lactifluus&quot; has a more tropical distribution than &quot;Lactarius&quot;, with most species known from tropical Africa, Asia, South America, and Australasia, but some also occurring in the north temperate zone. &quot;Multifurca&quot; is the rarest among the four mushroom genera, known only from some punctual records in North and Central America, Asia, and Australasia.

Species of &quot;Lactarius&quot;, &quot;Lactifluus&quot;, and &quot;Russula&quot; have repeatedly been introduced with trees outside their native range: An overview article lists introductions in Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, the US, Great Britain, the Faroe Islands, South Africa, China, Thailand, and New Zealand.

Among the corticioid genera, &quot;Pseudoxenasma&quot; is only known from Europe. In contrast, &quot;Boidinia&quot; species have been found in Europe, Taiwan, and Japan, and &quot;Gloeopeniophorella&quot; species in North America, South America, Europe, West Africa, Taiwan, Australia, and New Zealand.

==Ecology==
===Ectomycorrhizal symbiosis===
The genera &quot;Lactarius&quot;, &quot;Lactifluus&quot;, &quot;Multifurca&quot; and &quot;Russula&quot; form a mutualistic ectomycorrhizal root symbiosis with trees and shrubs, exchanging mineral nutrients for photosynthetic sugar. They are one of several fungal lineages that have evolved such a lifestyle and are sometimes referred to as the &quot;/russula-lactarius&quot; clade in the scientific literature. Worldwide, they are one of the most frequently encountered lineages on ectomycorrhizal roots. While some tropical species were initially believed to be parasitic, the observation that species fruiting on tree trunks do form ectomycorrhiza in tropical Guyana supports the view of an exclusively symbiotic lineage.

Associations are known with several plant families. In the Northern Hemisphere, these are essentially the well-known ectomycorrhizal trees and shrubs in the Betulaceae, Fagaceae, Pinaceae and Salicaceae, but in arctic and alpine habitats, Russulaceae also associate with &quot;Bistorta vivipara&quot; (Polygonaceae), &quot;Kobresia&quot; (Cyperaceae), and &quot;Dryas octopetala&quot; (Rosaceae), ectomycorrhizal plants untypic in their respective families. In the tropics, known plant partners include Dipterocarpaceae, Fabaceae, Nyctaginaceae, Phyllanthaceae, Polygonaceae (&quot;Coccoloba&quot;), Sarcolaenaceae, and the gymnosperm &quot;Gnetum gnemon&quot;, and in the Southern Hemisphere, Nothofagaceae, Myrtaceae (&quot;Eucalyptus&quot; and &quot;Leptospermum&quot;), and Rhamnaceae (&quot;Pomaderris&quot;). Some Russulaceae are quite specialised in their ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, such as &quot;Lactarius&quot; and &quot;Russula&quot; species that only grow with &quot;Cistus&quot; shrubs in the Mediterranean basin.

The different plant partners are reflected in the wide variety of habitats worldwide. Ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae have been observed in arctic and alpine tundra, boreal and alpine forest, north temperate forest, mires, mediterranean forests and scrub (maquis), miombo woodland, tropical lowland rainforest, tropical cloud forest, tropical dry forest, Australian eucalypt woodlands, and south temperate forests. Where they are introduced, they typically grow in plantations of their native host species, e.g. with pine in South Africa, &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; in Thailand, or birch in New Zealand.

===Other types of mycorrhiza===
Some of the ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae are also involved in other types of root symbioses with plants.

A mutualistic association similar to ectomycorrhiza but with some hyphae penetrating into the plant root cells, termed &quot;arbutoid mycorrhiza&quot;, is formed by Russulaceae with shrubs of the genera &quot;Arbutus&quot; and &quot;Arctostaphylos&quot;, both in subfamily Arbutoideae of the Ericaceae.

Some Russulaceae are associated with myco-heterotrophic plants of the Ericaceae subfamily Monotropoideae, forming &quot;monotropoid mycorrhiza&quot;. This is an epiparasitic relationship, where the heterotrophic plant ultimately derives its carbon from the primary, ectomycorrhizal plant partner of the fungus. The association is often very specific, with the heterotrophic plants only associating with selected fungus partners, including Russulaceae.

Russulaceae are also an important group of orchid mycorrhizal fungi. This symbiosis is mutualistic in the case of green orchids, but a partly or fully epiparasitic relationship in the case of myco-heterotrophic and mixotrophic orchids, respectively. In some cases, the association with Russulaceae is, as in monotropoid mycorrhiza, very specific: the Mediterranean orchid &quot;Limodorum abortivum&quot; predominantly associates with &quot;Russula delica&quot; and closely related species; in &quot;Corallorhiza maculata&quot;, different genotypes of the same species have distinct &quot;Russula&quot; partners.

===Wood decay species===
The corticioid species in &quot;Boidinia&quot;, &quot;Gloeopeniophorella&quot;, and &quot;Pseudoxenasma&quot; are saprotrophic, wood-degrading fungi that develop on dead wood. Their early-branching positions in the phylogeny suggests this has been the ancestral trophic mode of the Russulaceae, and that the mycorrhizal lifestyle &quot;(see above)&quot; evolved later. The saprotrophic nature of these species has been questioned, based on the observation that other inconspicuous, crust-forming fungi are ectomycorrhizal; a subsequent author reaffirms nevertheless that &quot;[n]one of the corticioid species in the family shows any sign of mycorrhizal activity.&quot;

===Hypogeous fruiting===
Hypogeous fruitbodies, or fruitbodies developing below ground, occur in &quot;Lactarius&quot; and &quot;Russula&quot; and have previously been considered as distinct genera (see &quot;Systematics and taxonomy: Internal systematics&quot;). As such species are especially diverse in some warm and dry regions, e.g. in Spain, California, or Australia, below-ground fruiting has been interpreted as an adaptation to drought. However, hypogeous Russulaceae are also known from cold temperate regions and tropical rainforest. The fact that hypogeous species in the Russulaceae do not form their own lineages but are scattered in &quot;Russula&quot; or &quot;Lactarius&quot; shows that this type of fruiting evolved several times. It is believed that these changes are evolutionarily quite recent.

===Parasites===
Russulaceae fruitbodies are subject to parasitisation by other fungi. The genus &quot;Asterophora&quot; develops on old fruitbodies of the mushroom species in the family, as does &quot;Dendrocollybia racemosa&quot; on at least &quot;Russula crassotunicata&quot;. Fruitbodies of &quot;Lactifluus&quot; or &quot;Russula&quot; species otherwise hot-tasting and unpalatable are regarded as choice edibles in North America when infected by the &quot;lobster mushroom&quot; &quot;Hypomyces lactifluorum&quot;. Heterotrophic plants, including orchids or monotropoids, also parasitise ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae and their plant partners – see above, &quot;Other types of mycorrhiza&quot;.

===Threats and conservation===
As with most fungi, little information is available on the threat of extinction for Russulaceae species, and they have not been assessed in the International Union for the Conservation of Nature&#x27;s Red List. However, national lists contain some species of &quot;Lactarius&quot;, &quot;Lactifluus&quot; and &quot;Russula&quot;, indicating that they have small populations and are endangered, e.g. in Great Britain, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and New Zealand.

Although data on Russulaceae themselves are scarce, more is known about the habitats they occur in, especially for the ectomycorrhizal species which depend on their host plants: Several of these habitats are affected by loss or degradation, such as peatlands, Mediterranean forests and scrub or tropical African dry woodland. Similarly, dead wood, the habitat of the corticioid Russulaceae, is rare in many exploited forests and needs special management.

Recent studies have found some traditional Russulaceae species to comprise several cryptic species (see &quot;Systematics and taxonomy: Species diversity&quot;). This may imply that distribution range and population size for each of such distinct species are smaller than previously thought.

==Edibility==
Several species of &quot;Lactarius&quot;, &quot;Lactifluus&quot; and &quot;Russula&quot; are valued as excellent edible mushrooms. This is the case for example for the north temperate species &quot;Lactarius deliciosus&quot;, &quot;Lactifluus volemus&quot;, or &quot;Russula vesca&quot;, and other species are popular in other parts of the world, e.g. &quot;Lactarius indigo&quot; in Mexico, or &quot;Lactifluus edulis&quot; in tropical Africa. Some species, like &quot;Russula vesca&quot;, can even be eaten raw. The brittle texture of &quot;Russula&quot; fruitbodies makes them different from other mushrooms and is not appreciated by some.

Several species have a hot to very acrid taste and can cause gastrointestinal symptoms. Despite this, such species are eaten in some regions, e.g. &quot;Lactarius torminosus&quot; in Finland or Russia. Often, they are parboiled or pickled to make them palatable, and sometimes, they are used as spice, for example &quot;Russula emetica&quot; in Eastern Europe. Some species are however truly poisonous: the East Asian and North American &quot;Russula subnigricans&quot; causes rhabdomyolysis and is potentially lethal, and &quot;Lactarius turpis&quot; from Eurasia contains a mutagenic substance.

Cultivation of edible Russulaceae, as in other ectomycorrhizal fungi, is challenging, since the presence of host trees is required. In spite of this difficulty, the European &quot;Lactarius deliciosus&quot; has been successfully grown in &quot;mushroom orchards&quot; in New Zealand.

==Chemistry==
Fruitbodies of Russulaceae have been the subject of natural product research, and different classes of organic compounds have been isolated from them.

Aroma compounds are responsible for the particular odour or taste in some species, e.g. sotolon in the fenugreek-smelling &quot;Lactarius helvus&quot;, or the similar quabalactone III in &quot;Lactarius rubidus&quot; which causes a maple syrup-like odor in dried specimens. Pigments have been isolated from brightly coloured species, e.g. (7-isopropenyl-4-methylazulen-1-yl)methyl stearate from the blue &quot;Lactarius indigo&quot; or russulaflavidin and a derivative from the yellow &quot;Russula flavida&quot;. Some &quot;Russula&quot; species contain pigmented pteridine derivatives called &quot;russupteridines&quot; that are not found in the milk-caps. Sesquiterpenes are characteristic secondary metabolites of many Russulaceae, especially milk-caps which have been quite intensively studied. They are thought to be responsible for the hot taste in many species and may have deterrent, antifeeding functions in nature.

Other metabolites isolated from different species include dibenzonaphtyridinone alkaloids, prenylated phenols, benzofurans, chromenes, natural rubber (polyisoprene), sterols, and the sugar alcohol volemitol. Among toxic substances, &quot;Lactarius turpis&quot; contains the mutagenic alkaloid necatorin, and the small compound cycloprop-2-ene carboxylic acid has been identified as the toxic agent in &quot;Russula subnigricans&quot;. Some secondary metabolites showed antibiotic properties in laboratory tests. An ethanolic extract of &quot;Russula delica&quot; was antibacterial, and a lectin from &quot;Russula rosea&quot; showed antitumor activity.

<text>The Provisional Central Committee, Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) was a communist political party in India. The general secretary of the party was Santosh Rana. The party is often referred to as CPI(ML) [Santosh Rana Group] or likewise.

The PCC, CPI(ML) evolved from the group loyal to Satyanarayan Singh from the original Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist). Singh rebelled against the party leader Charu Majumdar in 1971, provoking a split. In April 1973, Singh&#x27;s party was reorganised.

In March 2024, the party merged with CPI(ML) Revolutionary Initiative and CPI(ML) Praja Pandha to create a new party CPI(ML) Mass Line.

==History==
Santosh Rana had broken with Charu Majumdar in 1971, and later joined Singh&#x27;s group. In 1974 the Chandrapulla Reddy-led Andhra Pradesh Committee of Communist Revolutionaries merged with Singh&#x27;s CPI(ML).

When the Bihar movement was launched by Jayaprakash Narayan in 1974, Singh&#x27;s CPI(ML) decided to lend support to it. Narayan had been in contact with Singh since 1968, attempting to persuade him to support non-violent agrarian reform struggles.

On 4 July 1975 the Indian government banned 27 organisations, Singh&#x27;s CPI(ML) was one of them. Under the &quot;Emergency&quot; Singh&#x27;s CPI(ML) formulated a three-tier united front line, calling for the formation of a &#x27;revolutionary united front&#x27; (consisting of communist revolutionaries, working towards a unified revolutionary communist party), a &#x27;proletarian united front&#x27; based on working class struggles (and which could include the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist)) and a &#x27;democratic front&#x27; which would unite forces working for restoration of democratic rights. Within the framework of the &#x27;democratic front&#x27; work, party cadres began participating in joint protests with non-left opposition groups at the time.

After the defeat of Indira Gandhi in the 1977 Lok Sabha elections, the situation for the party was relaxed somewhat. Singh asserted that although the class character of the new Janata Party government was the same as the Gandhi government, he appreciated differences like improvement of civil liberties and weakening of Soviet influence. On 9 April 1977 S.N. Singh signed an appeal along with Khokan Majumder (Unity Committee, CPI(ML)), Suniti Kumar Ghosh (COC, CPI(ML)) and Apurba Roy (UCCRI(ML)), calling for the unconditional release of 12 000 revolutionary prisoners. During the anti-Emergency struggle, the Janata Party had promised to release political prisoners. Once in power however, they had back-tracked on that promise. Singh was involved in negotiations to secure the release of prisoners.

Singh&#x27;s CPI(ML) was the first major ML-factions that opened up for participating in elections, which became a controversial issue. On 10 April 1977 Singh declared the willingness to contest elections at a press conference. The Calcutta District committee denounced the move. Other ML-factions saw as the new line as treachery. In 1971 Santosh Rana was elected to the West Bengal state assembly from the Gopiballavpur constituency (one of the areas were CPI(ML) had started armed struggle following the model of the Naxalbari uprising). Rana got 13401 votes (25,67%), which was enough to defeat the CPI(M), Indian National Congress and Janata Party candidates. Singh&#x27;s CPI(ML) were also able to register the party name &quot;Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist)&quot; with the Election Commission of India, but the registration was later lost.

==Post-1984 period==
Around 1980 Singh&#x27;s group appeared as the strongest ML-faction, but with the exit of Chandrapulla Reddy and other splits the party shrunk. In 1984 a severe split occurred, with the loyalists of Singh opposed to the group of Santosh Rana and Vaskar Nandy. The Singh faction levelled the following accusation: &quot;In our organisation also, Nandy’s close associates established contacts with a foreign voluntary agency and a native voluntary agency financed by Western monopoly capital, keeping it secret from the POC and the general secretary of the party, S N Singh. They established contact with Rural Aid Consortium of Tagore Society which is financed by West European countries and the USA and with one Danish Organisation on the Plea of providing relief to the people of Gobiballabpur in West Bengal and some areas in Bihar. Lakhs of rupees were received for digging tanks, constructing school building opening a sewing training center and distributing chickens and cattle to the needy. It also came to our notice that money was being received by some of our leaders from the Lutheran Church. When it came to light to the PCC members, an intense ideological struggle burst forth in the party on this issue.&quot; (Our differences with Nandy-Rana group, PCC-CPI(ML), p. 29)

The group of Rana came to win a majority in the leadership (the provisional central committee) and Singh&#x27;s followers formed a new committee (and de facto a new party). Singh died shortly afterwards.

Rana&#x27;s group differentiates themselves from other ML-factions through their emphasis on antifascism. Rana considers the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as a fascist danger for India. PCC, CPI(ML) gives the advice to their followers to vote for parties like CPI(M) or even the Indian National Congress in constituencies were no revolutionary communist candidate is available.

Ahead of the 2004 Lok Sabha elections the party participated in the united front of revolutionary communists initiated by Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Red Flag and Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist).

In the Bodo-dominated areas in Assam, the party works through a mass organization called United Reservation Movement Council of Assam. PCC, CPI(ML) and URMCA are opponents of the Bodo nationalist movements. In the Lok Sabha elections in 2004 the URMCA candidate in Kokrajhar got 205 491 votes (21,25%). In the 1999 election the URMCA candidate had gotten 246 942 votes (27,75%) in the same constituency.

PCC, CPI(ML) publishes &quot;For a New Democracy&quot; as its central organ. The editor-in-chief is Vaskar Nandy.

<text>The Shorncliffe railway line is an suburban railway line situated north of Brisbane, the state capital of Queensland, Australia. It is part of the Queensland Rail Citytrain network.

==History==

The Sandgate Railway, opened in 1882, was the first truly suburban railway in Brisbane, built to provide convenient access to the seaside for the city&#x27;s residents. The terminus was originally named Sandgate and was renamed Shorncliffe in 1938. The current Sandgate station was originally named Sandgate Central. The line allowed Brisbane residents to travel to Moreton Bay&#x27;s shoreline at Shorncliffe.

Duplication was completed by December 1901.

Trains to Sandgate originally travelled via what is now the Exhibition line prior to the opening of the tunnel between Central and Brunswick Street in 1890. The Shorncliffe line is going to be used as a pilot test for the implementation of ETCS, (European Train Control System), prior to its introduction with Cross River Rail.

==Line guide and services==
Most services to and/from Shorncliffe continue onto the Cleveland line. The typical travel time between Shorncliffe and Brisbane City is approximately 33 minutes (to Central).

Passengers for/from the Caboolture, Redcliffe Peninsula and Sunshine Coast lines change at Northgate, Airport and Doomben lines at Eagle Junction, Ferny Grove line at Bowen Hills, and all other lines at Central.

<doc id="854175" wikidata="Q781139" url="?curid=854175" title="Ball mill">
<text>A ball mill is a type of grinder filled with grinding balls, used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics, and selective laser sintering. It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.

A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis. The axis of the shell may be either horizontal or at a small angle to the horizontal. It is partially filled with balls. The grinding media are the balls, which may be made of steel (chrome steel), stainless steel, ceramic, or rubber. The inner surface of the cylindrical shell is usually lined with an abrasion-resistant material such as manganese steel or rubber lining. Less wear takes place in rubber lined mills. The length of the mill is approximately equal to its diameter.

The general idea behind the ball mill is an ancient one, but it was not until the Industrial Revolution and the invention of steam power that an effective ball milling machine could be built. It is reported to have been used for grinding flint for pottery in 1870.

==Working==

In case of continuously operated ball mill, the material to be ground is fed from the left through a 60° cone and the product is discharged through a 30° cone to the right. As the shell rotates, the balls are lifted up on the rising side of the shell and then they cascade down (or drop down on to the feed), from near the top of the shell. In doing so, the solid particles in between the balls and ground are reduced in size by impact.

==Applications==
Ball mills are used for grinding materials such as mining ores, coal, pigments, and feldspar for pottery. Grinding can be carried out wet or dry, but the former is performed at low speed. Ball mills are used often in scientific work to reduce the particle size, eliminate agglomeration, change the shape of particles, provide for mechanical alloying, mixing, producing powders and changing materials properties. An open source ball mill has been designed that can be fabricated with a 3D printer for a few hundred dollars. It is able to be operated both on grid for lab work and off grid with solar photovoltaics and a battery for field work. Blending of explosives is an example of an application for rubber balls. For systems with multiple components, ball milling has been shown to be effective in increasing solid-state chemical reactivity.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/S0079-6425(01)00002-0&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ball milling has been shown effective for production of amorphous materials. It may also be useful to separate gases such as hydrogen and store them in powder form.

==Description==

A ball mill, a type of grinder, is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores, chemicals, ceramic raw materials and paints. Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis, partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium. Different materials are used as media, including ceramic balls, flint pebbles, and stainless steel balls. An internal cascading effect reduces the material to a fine powder. Industrial ball mills can operate continuously, fed at one end and discharged at the other end. Large to medium-sized ball mills are mechanically rotated on their axis, but small ones normally consist of a cylindrical capped container that sits on two drive shafts (pulleys and belts are used to transmit rotary motion). A rock tumbler functions on the same principle. Ball mills are also used in pyrotechnics and the manufacture of black powder, but cannot be used in the preparation of some pyrotechnic mixtures such as flash powder because of their sensitivity to impact. High-quality ball mills are potentially expensive and can grind mixture particles to as small as 5 nm, enormously increasing surface area and reaction rates.

The grinding works on the principle of critical speed. Critical speed can be understood as that speed after which the steel balls that are responsible for the grinding of particles start rotating along the direction of the cylindrical device, thus causing no further grinding.

Ball mills are used extensively in the mechanical alloying process, in which they are used for grinding and for cold welding, producing alloys from powders.

The ball mill is a key piece of equipment for grinding crushed materials, and it is widely used in production lines for powders such as cement, silicates, refractory material, fertilizer, glass ceramics, etc., as well as for ore dressing of ferrous and non-ferrous metals. The ball mill can grind ores and other materials, wet or dry. There are two kinds of ball mills according to their ways of discharging material: grate type, and overfall type. Many types of grinding media are suitable for use in a ball mill, each material having its own specific properties and advantages. Key properties of grinding media are size, density, hardness, and composition.
* Size: The smaller the media particles, the smaller the particle size of the final product. The grinding media particles should be substantially larger than the largest pieces of material to be ground.
* Density: The media should be denser than the material being ground. It becomes a problem if the grinding media floats on top of the material to be ground.
* Hardness: The grinding media needs to be durable enough to grind the material, but, where possible, not so tough that it also wears down the tumbler.
* Composition: Various grinding applications have special requirements. Some of these requirements are based on some of the grinding media being in the finished product, while others are based on how the media will react with the material being ground.
* Where the color of the finished product is important, the color and material of the grinding media must be considered.
* Where low contamination is important, the grinding media may be selected for ease of separation from the finished product (e.g., steel dust produced from stainless steel media can be magnetically separated from non-ferrous products). An alternative to separation is to use media of the same material as the product being ground.
* Flammable products have a tendency to become explosive in powder form. Steel media may spark, becoming an ignition source for these products. Either wet-grinding, or non-sparking media such as ceramic or lead must be selected.
* Some media, such as iron, may react with corrosive materials. For this reason, stainless steel, ceramic, and flint grinding media may each be used when corrosive substances are present during grinding.

The grinding chamber can also be filled with an inert shield gas that does not react with the material being ground, to prevent oxidation or explosive reactions that could occur with ambient air inside the mill.

==Advantages of the ball mill==
Ball milling boasts several advantages over other systems: the cost of installation and grinding medium is low; the capacity and fineness can be adjusted by adjusting the diameter of the ball; it is suitable for both batch and continuous operation; it is suitable for open and closed-circuit grinding; it is applicable for materials of all degrees of hardness.

== Varieties ==
Aside from common ball mills, there is a second type of ball mill called a &quot;planetary ball mill&quot;. Planetary ball mills are smaller than common ball mills and mainly used in laboratories for grinding sample material down to very small sizes. A planetary ball mill consists of at least one grinding jar which is arranged eccentrically on a so-called sun wheel. The direction of movement of the sun wheel is opposite to that of the grinding jars (ratio: 1:−2 or 1:−1).
The grinding balls in the grinding jars are subjected to superimposed rotational movements, the so-called Coriolis forces. The difference in speeds between the balls and grinding jars produces an interaction between frictional and impact forces, which releases high dynamic energies. The interplay between these forces produces the high and very effective degree of size reduction of the planetary ball mill.

<doc id="854176" wikidata="Q1650113" url="?curid=854176" title="Stars and Stripes Vol. 1">
<text>Stars and Stripes Vol. 1 is the twenty-eighth studio album by American rock band the Beach Boys, released on August 19, 1996, by River North Records. Produced by Joe Thomas and Brian Wilson, &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; is a collaborative album between the Beach Boys and various country acts.

The idea for the album was conceived by Thomas, who was then the owner of River North Records. According to Wilson&#x27;s wife Melinda, during the album&#x27;s recording, &quot;They [the Beach Boys] treated [Brian] like an invalid, all the time saying, &#x27;Do this, don&#x27;t do that, are you okay?&#x27;&quot;

In music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine&#x27;s description, the release was &quot;an unmitigated disaster and an outright embarrassment for all involved&quot;. The album&#x27;s failure prevented Brian from securing a record contract, leaving his highly anticipated recording collaborations with Andy Paley in limbo. A planned second volume never materialized, and &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; became the last studio album to feature Carl Wilson, who died in 1998.

<text>Sir John Michael Middlecott Banham (22 August 1940 – 9 August 2022) was a British businessman. He was the chairman of the major brewer Whitbread from 2000 to 2005, and also chairman of ECI Ventures and Johnson Matthey.

== Biography ==
Banham was born on 22 August 1940, and raised in Cornwall, where his father worked as a surgeon and his mother as a National Health Service (NHS) administrator, and was educated at Charterhouse School, and Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, where he gained a first class degree in Natural Sciences. He worked at the Foreign Office for two years before moving to Reed International and then McKinsey and Co.

Banham was an avid sailor, participating in the 1979 Fastnet race, on a Contessa 34 when the yacht was hit by Force 11 winds some 90 miles off Land’s End. Of the 303 starting yachts, 80 had to be saved, 24 were abandoned (of which two were retrieved) at least 75 boats capsized and five sank. Running before the storm, and navigated by a submariner, the boat managed to make its way unaided to Milford Haven.

He was the first controller of the Audit Commission from 1983 to 1987, and was then Director General of the Confederation of British Industry from 1987 to 1992. In 1992 he became chairman of the Local Government Commission for England that led to a large-scale local government reform in England. He was knighted in the 1992 New Year Honours.

He was chairman of Tarmac from 1994 to 1999, and the chairman of Kingfisher plc from 1995 to 2001. He became the chairman of Johnson Matthey in April 2006. He has also acted as chairman of West Country Television and as a non-executive director of both National Westminster Bank and National Power.

In 1987, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Bath, and an honorary fellowship from Queens&#x27;. Banham was an active freemason. He was a deputy lieutenant of Cornwall.

Banham died on 9 August 2022, thirteen days before his 82nd birthday.

<text>Taiwanese opera () commonly known as Ke-Tse opera or Hokkien opera, is a form of traditional drama originating in Taiwan. Taiwanese opera uses a stylised combination of both the literary and colloquial registers of Taiwanese Hokkien. Its earliest form adopted elements of folk songs from Zhangzhou, Fujian, China. The plots are traditionally drawn from folk tales of the southern Fujian region and Chinese historical legends stories, though in recent years stories are increasingly set in Taiwan itself. Taiwanese opera was later exported to other Hokkien-speaking areas, such as Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Fujian, China.

Taiwanese opera is considered as the embodiment of Taiwanese history and tradition because the political identity crisis of Taiwan shaped its development.

==History==

===Origin===
Taiwanese opera is the only form of Han traditional drama known to have originated in Taiwan, specifically in Yilan. In the early stages, most Han immigrants in Yilan were from Zhangzhou, Fujian, bringing with them the Hokkien Zhangzhou dialect.

&quot;Koa-á&quot; were story-telling ballads spoken in Hokkien. Each line could have five or seven characters, and every four lines constituted a paragraph.

===Formation===
&quot;Jinge&quot; (錦歌; ) is the forerunner of Taiwanese opera. As early as seventeenth century, immigrants from southern Fujian, China brought &quot;Jinge&quot;, the popular folk songs that set the poetry in local dialect to Taiwan. Around nineteenth century, amateur singers in Gilan modified &quot;Jinge&quot; and gradually developed a new style called &quot;Kua-a&quot; ().

Other than &quot;Jinge&quot;, Taiwanese opera absorbed the styles of formal operas including Peking opera, Luantan opera (亂彈戲), Siping opera (四平戲), Liyuan opera (梨園戲), and Gaojia opera (高甲戲). Between 1923 and 1949, Peking opera troupes from Shanghai and Fujian toured Taiwan. Some actors stayed in Taiwan and became performing directors of Taiwanese operas. The influences of Peking operas can be seen in repertory, gesture, movement, percussion music and costume. Fighting themes and acrobatic movements became standards in the operas.

===Early development===
Taiwan was under Japanese rule from 1895 to 1945. In the early stage, the Japanese government allowed the local customs to develop without much interference and Taiwanese opera continued to thrive. In Ho-yi Lin’s book “Taiwanese Opera”, she describes how Taiwanese opera took root in China. She stated, “It’s worth noting that in 1928, the San Le Hsuan troupe (三樂軒班; ), on a pilgrimage to Wu Wang Temple in southern Fujian, performed with great success in Bai-chiao (白礁; ) and Xiamen… In succession, Taiwanese troupes such as Ni Sheng, Ni Kuan, Dan Feng, Mu Dan and Tun Yi also performed in Fujian province.”

====First decline: 1936–1945====
After the Pacific War broke out, the Japanese government changed the previous policy and implemented a &quot;Kōminka&quot; policy that encouraged Japanisation. During this period, the Japanese government prohibited the public performance of Taiwanese opera. Even though many troupes were disbanded and Taiwanese opera witnessed its first decline, local people still tried to perform Taiwanese operas in secrecy. Taiwanese opera, also known as &quot;Bông-kok-tiāu/wangguodiao&quot; (亡國調; literally, &quot;music from a dying nation&quot;) provided an outlet for Taiwanese people to search for their identify and fight for the &quot;in-betweenness&quot; of cultural influences of Taiwan, Japan and China.

Some dissidents like the &quot;Ruiguang Theater Troupe from Ruifang in northern Taipei Prefecture premiered its own &quot;new drama&quot;.&quot; (Lee Daw-Ming, 158) Japanisation forbade traditional Taiwanese opera, this troupe would simply perform &quot;new drama&quot; which was a modern variation of Taiwanese opera, with modern costumes. The &quot;New Drama movement&quot; fever finally subsided in 1940.&quot; (Lee-Daw-Ming, 158)

===Golden period: 1945–1962===
After Taiwan was handed to the Republic of China, Taiwanese opera was revived and more than one hundred troupes were formed within a year. In 1949, there were over five hundred registered troupes. Taiwanese operas entered into its golden age. During this time, Chen Cheng-san (陳澄三) founded “Kung Le She” (拱樂社) troupe and became the first person to use written scripts for performance. He commissioned Chen Shou-jing to write scripts of &quot;Broken Dreams of the Red Chamber&quot; (紅樓殘夢; ).

Even during its golden period, Taiwanese opera continued to face challenges and adapt to the changes in political and cultural environment. The rise of the new broadcasting medias including radio, film and television show, the influence and popularity of western pop songs and movies drew the general public’s attention and presented serious competition. During the martial law from 1949 to 1987, the KMT government revived the Mandarin Promotion Council and discouraged or, in some cases, forbade the use of Hokkien and other dialects. This and the shift of political environment provided little support for the Taiwanese-language based art form. The indoor performances decreased and opera troupes experimented performing on radio, film and television and large outdoor settings.

===Transformation===
Starting in 1954, Taiwanese operas performed on radios. In 1955, Chen Cheng-san filmed the first white and black movie of Taiwanese Opera “Xue Pin-Gui and Wang Bao-chuan” (薛平貴與王寶釧; ) and the premier was a huge success. In 1962, Taiwan Television was established and started broadcasting Taiwanese operas. In 1982, Chinese Television System (CTS) Taiwanese Opera Troupe performed in Mandarin (instead of Hokkien). Televised operas are similar to soap operas and greatly increased the popularity of Taiwanese operas. However, certain traditional elements are lost because television shows feature less singing and body movements.

In the early 1980s Taiwanese opera was brought to the television audience, with Iûⁿ Lē-hoa as its popular face. The artistic elements remained largely traditional, however. Taiwanese opera, like other forms of Chinese opera and theatre around the world, often traditionally uses cross-dressed performers (反串; fǎnchùan; hóan-chhòan), specifically women portraying men&#x27;s roles in the case of Taiwanese opera.

Modern and experimental forms show some propensity for syncretism. Western instruments such as the saxophone and guitar have been used in some performances. Loose Western adaptations have included Nikolai Gogol&#x27;s &quot;The Government Inspector&quot;. Perhaps due to the influence of the Taiwanese localisation movement, stories set in Taiwan, as well as aboriginal characters and stories, have been developed in recent years. Taiwanese forms of the Hakka tea-picking opera show some influence. Fans of the opera attribute its continuing relevance to a willingness of performers to adapt to modern times in terms of style and artistic diversity.

====Second decline====

Taiwanese opera&#x27;s success in movie and television industry ironically becomes one of cause that eventually leads to the decline of indoor staged performances. Chen Shen-Fu, a general producer of the Ming Hwa Yuan Arts and Culture Group, said: &quot;Although we know everything they do is for survival, that is not right. They are doing something that will kill the life of the opera.&quot; Other factors include political policy and social structure changes and western influences. Tsai summarised the period of decline:

 The main social changes were the rise of many forms of entertainment in the 1960s and the transformation of society from agricultural to industrial and commercial in the 1970s. Government policies that were detrimental to Taiwanese opera were 1) the promotion of only national theatre – Peking Opera, 2) standardisation of plays, and 3) Limitations on religious performances and on the use of dialects.

===Future===
Taiwanese opera is considered as the embodiment of Taiwanese history and tradition and the political identity crisis of Taiwan shaped its development. Taiwanese opera&#x27;s history reflects the growth and changes in Taiwan society starting from the earlier immigration influences, oppression under the &quot;Kōminka&quot; movement, to little state support during the martial law era and the transformations of modern medias. Taiwanese opera struggles to remain its vitality.

The refined operas in modern concert halls establish a new direction of Taiwanese opera development. One of the notable troupes is Ming Hwa Yuan Arts and Culture Group (MHY):

In 1983, MHY was the first among other folk theatres to appear on the stage of a national theatre, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. A more telling example is in 1989 when MHY got permission to perform in the Zhihang airforce base. In the past, only Beijing opera had been considered proper enough to tour military bases. Three years later, MHY toured military schools. The audience&#x27;s response was far more enthusiastic than it was for Beijing opera.

This transformation also reflects on the opera storylines. The traditional plots are historical and heroic events, legends and myths. Taiwanese operas gradually added more romantic elements. The intense drama and the love-hate relationships are the focuses of the televised operas. &quot;Legend of the White Snake&quot; is a typical story that combines the myth, religion, and romance.

==Performance elements==

Originally there are three roles in Taiwanese opera, &quot;Sheng&quot;, &quot;Dan&quot;, and &quot;Chou&quot;. Later, as Taiwanese opera began to incorporate more styles from other major operas, it gradually expanded to include eight major characters.

===Male leads ===

&quot;Sheng&quot; (生; seng). These characters are gentle and brave.
* (老生; lāu-seng) 
* (小生; sió-seng)
* (副生; hù-seng): Supporting actor 
* (反生; hoán-seng)
* (武生; bú-seng): martial artist
 is an older male lead. Old shengs have a chaste and decent disposition. Young male characters are known as .

===Female leads ===

In Taiwanese opera there are four subtypes in &quot;Dan&quot; (旦; tòaⁿ) roles. 
* (老旦; lāu-tòaⁿ): elder female supporting character
* (苦旦; khó͘-tòaⁿ): sorrowful female character
* (武旦; bú-tòaⁿ): female warrior
* (花旦; hoe-tòaⁿ): cute or funny or a personal servant

 is a dignified older role and she is a straight arrow. Also she reveals sentiment of the affection to the children so she takes sides with her children.

===Jester===
*&quot;Chou&quot; (丑; thiú): male jester

===Costume===
==Stage properties and figures==
Stage properties and figures are a part of dancing. Taiwanese opera are not graphic. Sometimes a chair in Taiwanese opera stands for a fence or a bridge. Raising red flags stands for fire, raising blue flags stands for water, and raising black flags stands for wind.
There are many types of figures:
*Entrances and Exits
*Pulling a Mountain
*Walking a Circle
*The Kneeling Walk
*Small, Quick Steps
*Sweeping Hair
*The Bat Jump
*The Vertigines Gesture
*The Water Sleeves

===Voices===
The most important in Taiwanese opera is the music for voices.

===Instruments===
The use of a wide range of traditional musical instruments in Taiwanese opera.

*Kezaixian 
*Daguangxian
*Suona 
*Jinghu

==Performance types==

===Three-role tea-picking opera===
The three-role opera is known as the story of tea-farmer Zhang Sanlang performed by one clown and two female roles and the plot and the singing are fixed. The three-role tea-picking opera is simple and does not have official stage. The stage is built before the performance.

<doc id="854189" wikidata="Q923090" url="?curid=854189" title="Kevin Saunderson">
<text>Kevin Maurice Saunderson (born September 5, 1964) is an American electronic dance music DJ and record producer. He is famous for being a member of a trio, along with Juan Atkins and Derrick May, who came to be known as the Belleville Three, who are often credited to being among the pioneers and originators of techno: in particular this act helped define Detroit techno, the earliest style of this music genre. Born in New York, at the age of nine he moved to Belleville, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, where at Belleville High School he befriended the other members of the trio.

==Early life==
Kevin Maurice Saunderson was born on September 5, 1964, in Brooklyn, New York. He spent the early years of his life in Brooklyn before moving at around age 10 to Belleville, Michigan, a rural town 30 miles from Detroit. Saunderson first met future Techno pioneer Derrick May when the two were fourteen. May had decided not to pay Saunderson after losing a bet and, one day at school, Saunderson punched May in the face, knocking him out cold and giving him a concussion. After the altercation, the two became best friends.

During high school, Saunderson and Belleville High School classmate Juan Atkins were fans of DJ Charles &quot;The Electrifying Mojo&quot; Johnson. Atkins and May soon became serious about mixing others&#x27; music and creating their own, but Saunderson pursued other goals first, studying telecommunications and playing football at Eastern Michigan University. Atkins had begun recording with Cybotron in 1981, but it was not until 1987 that May followed suit and made a record. Initially concentrating on becoming a DJ, Saunderson was inspired to create his own music after watching the six-month-long process as Atkins and May completed &quot;Let&#x27;s Go.&quot;

===Kreem===
Atkins shared his technical expertise with Saunderson, and those early sessions led to a track called &quot;Triangle of Love&quot;. &quot;I used to wake up in the middle of the night, go into my studio – which was in the next room – and lay down the ideas as they came to me. At the time it was all about experimentation and being a college kid,&quot; Saunderson writes on his web page autobiography. &quot;Triangle of Love&quot; was released under the pseudonym Kreem on Atkins&#x27; label, Metroplex.

===Inner City===
Inner City is a Saunderson collaboration that came about &quot;by accident,&quot; according to Saunderson. In 1987 he recorded a backing track in his home studio, but needed lyrics and a female vocalist. His friend, Chicago house producer Terry ‘Housemaster’ Baldwin, suggested Paris Grey. &quot;Paris agreed, flew into Detroit, came up with lyrics and ‘Big Fun’ was born.&quot; Saunderson filed away the tape until, months later, UK dance entrepreneur Neil Rushton came to Detroit in search of music for a compilation album, &quot;Techno - The New Dance Sound Of Detroit&quot; for Virgin Records. Rushton included &quot;Big Fun&quot; on the album. It was soon released as a single and became a worldwide smash, only to be outsold by Inner City&#x27;s follow-up single, &quot;Good Life.&quot; A debut album, &quot;Paradise,&quot; soon followed. Over the years, and after three albums, Inner City had nine top 40 hits in the UK and two top 20 albums, with combined sales of more than six million.

===E-Dancer===
In the E-Dancer project Saunderson creates music that is &quot;more underground.&quot; The first E-Dancer album, &#x27;Heavenly,&#x27; was released in 1998 to critical acclaim; &quot;Spin&quot; named it “one of the ten best albums you’ve never heard.”

==Reese bass==
The bassline of Saunderson&#x27;s 1988 track &quot;Just Want Another Chance&quot; (released under his &quot;Reese&quot; pseudonym on Incognito Records), became very influential in the jungle and drum and bass music genres. Notable releases incorporating the &quot;Reese Bassline&quot; include Renegade&#x27;s &quot;Terrorist&quot; (Moving Shadow, 1994), &quot;Pulp Friction&quot; by Alex Reece (Metalheadz, 1995) and &quot;Sonar&quot; by DJ Trace (Prototype Recordings, 1998). The bassline itself was performed by a Casio CZ-1000 using phase distortion synthesis.

==Later activities==
Saunderson continued to develop his record label KMS. &quot;The aim is to help and develop new talent and more importantly to continue to create and release great music,&quot; wrote Saunderson.

Saunderson also sponsors traveling youth baseball teams, and helps coach and manage one of those teams, the Metro Detroit Dodgers. As of 2005, his son was playing on the baseball team A Green.

On May 15, 2007, Saunderson made his &quot;Second Life&quot; debut performing live at a mixed reality event, celebrating the Grand Opening of Detroit Life - The Motor City inside The Metaverse. The same year, Saunderson compiled a mixtape for Triple J, an Australian radio station.

In November 2012, his mixing board was to be on display at the newly renovated Detroit Historical Museum.

<text>The world record in the mile run is the fastest time set by a runner in the middle-distance track and field event. World Athletics is the official body which oversees the records. Hicham El Guerrouj is the current men&#x27;s record holder with his time of 3:43.13, while Faith Kipyegon has the women&#x27;s record of 4:07.64. Since 1976, the mile has been the only non-metric distance recognized by the IAAF for record purposes. However, in international competitions such as the Olympics the term &quot;mile&quot; almost always refers to a distance of 1,500 meters, which is 109.344 meters shorter than an Imperial mile, even though four &quot;full&quot; laps of a 400 meter track is equal to 1,600 meters.

Accurate times for the mile run (1.609344 km) have been recorded since 1850, when the first precisely measured running tracks were built. Foot racing had become popular in England by the 17th century, when footmen would race and their masters would wager on the result. By the 19th century &quot;pedestrianism&quot;, as it was called, had become extremely popular and the best times recorded in the period were by professionals. Even after professional foot racing died out, it was not until 1915 that the professional record of 4:12 (set by Walter George in 1886) was surpassed by an amateur.

Progression of the mile record accelerated in the 1930s as newsreel coverage greatly popularized the sport, making stars out of milers such as Jules Ladoumègue, Jack Lovelock, and Glenn Cunningham. In the 1940s, Swedes Arne Andersson and Gunder Hägg lowered the record to 4:01.4 while racing was curtailed during World War II in the combatant countries. After the war, Roger Bannister of the United Kingdom and John Landy of Australia vied to be the first to break the fabled four-minute mile barrier. Roger Bannister did it first on May 6, 1954, and John Landy followed 46 days later.

On the women&#x27;s side, the first sub-5:00 mile was achieved by the UK&#x27;s Diane Leather 23 days after Bannister&#x27;s first sub-4:00 mile. However, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) did not recognize women&#x27;s records for the distance until 1967, when Anne Smith of the UK ran 4:37.0.

==Men==
=== Pre-IAAF ===

===Professionals===

===Amateurs===

As there was no recognized official sanctioning body until 1912, there are several versions of the mile progression before that year. One version starts with Richard Webster (GBR) who ran 4:36.5 in 1865, surpassed by Chinnery in 1868.

Another variation of the amateur record progression pre-1862 is as follows:

===IAAF / World Athletics era ===
The first world record in the mile for men (athletics) was recognized by the International Amateur Athletics Federation (later known as the International Association of Athletics Federations and currently known as World Athletics) in 1913.

To June 21, 2009, the IAAF has ratified 32 world records in the event.

The &quot;Time&quot; column indicates the ratified mark; the &quot;Auto&quot; column indicates a fully automatic time that was also recorded in the event when hand-timed marks were used for official records, or which was the basis for the official mark, rounded to the 10th of a second, depending on the rules then in place.

Records for the mile were rounded up to the nearest tenth of a second commencing January 1, 1957. Previously, records were rounded up to the nearest fifth of a second. Those rounded-up marks were: Cunningham&#x27;s 4:06.8 (timed at 4:06.7); Hägg&#x27;s 4:06.2 (4:06.1); Hägg&#x27;s 4:01.4 (4:01.3); Landy&#x27;s 3:58.0 (3:57.9). Landy&#x27;s mark was not retroactively adjusted when the new rule came into effect. Auto times to the hundredth of a second were accepted by the IAAF for events up to and including 10,000 m beginning in 1981.

During the most recent world record setting race in 1999, Noah Ngeny came in second place to Hicham El Guerrouj with a time of 3:43.40, which continues to be the second fastest mile run in history, beating out the old world record set in 1993 by Noureddine Morceli. No-one else approached the record in the 21st century until September 16, 2023, when Jakob Ingebrigtsen and Yared Nuguse recorded the third and fourth fastest times in history, with 3:43.73 and 3:43.97 respectively.

==Men&#x27;s Indoor==

===Men Indoor Pre-IAAF===
===Men Indoor IAAF era===

The IAAF started to recognize indoor world records in 1987, with the then world&#x27;s best time, Coghlan&#x27;s 3:49.78, ratified as the inaugural record for the mile.

== Road Men ==

=== IAAF Era ===
Note: The Road Mile became an official world record event after September 1, 2023, on World Athletics Certified Courses only (i.e: elevation gradient must not exceed one meter per kilometer, start and finish line must not be more than half a mile apart). The winning times from the 2023 U.S. Road Mile Championships, on 25 April, were ratified by World Athletics as the inaugural road mile world records.

===Women&#x27;s IAAF era===

The first world record in the mile for women (athletics) was recognized by the International Amateur Athletics Federation (later known as the International Association of Athletics Federations and currently known as World Athletics), in 1967. To June 21, 2009, the IAAF has ratified 13 world records in the event.

The &quot;Time&quot; column indicates the ratified mark; the &quot;Auto&quot; column indicates a fully automatic time that was also recorded in the event when hand-timed marks were used for official records, or which was the basis for the official mark, rounded to the 10th of a second, depending on the rules then in place.

The IAAF recognized times to the hundredth of a second starting in 1981.

Note:
* Decker ran 4:17.55 indoors in Houston on 16 February 1980, but this time was rejected as a record due to an oversized track.
* Natalya Artyomova (Soviet Union) ran 4:15.8 in Leningrad on 6 August 1984, but this time was rejected as a record due to there being no international judges.

<text>Kennedy Kane &quot;Ken&quot; McArthur (10 February 1881 – 13 June 1960) is most noted as a track and field athlete and winner of the marathon at the 1912 Summer Olympics.

==Biography==
Born in Dervock, County Antrim, Ireland, McArthur was recognised as a promising athlete as a teenager, but he didn&#x27;t pursue an athletics career until after emigrating to South Africa in 1901 at the age of 20.

After joining the Johannesburg Police Force in 1906, McArthur begun to take athletics seriously. Soon he had won the Transvaal half and one mile championships, the five mile track championship and also two national cross country championships.

McArthur ran his first marathon late in the 1908 season, and surprisingly beat the Olympic silver medalist Charles Hefferon. He also won the national one and ten mile championships.

The Stockholm Olympic marathon took place in sweltering heat. Representing South Africa in the event, McArthur and his teammate Christian Gitsham ran together and soon took the lead. Confident of victory, Gitsham stopped for water, expecting his colleague to join him, as agreed. Instead McArthur ran on, stretching his lead and taking him to certain victory over Gitsham by 58 seconds.

In the next season, McArthur injured his foot in an accident and was forced to retire from athletics. He ran six marathon races (including the Olympic marathon) throughout his career and never lost one.

<doc id="854206" wikidata="Q5260217" url="?curid=854206" title="Department of Corrections (New Zealand)">
<text>The Department of Corrections (Māori: &quot;Ara Poutama Aotearoa&quot;) is the public service department of New Zealand charged with managing the New Zealand corrections system. This includes the operations of the 18 prisons in New Zealand and services run by Probation. Corrections&#x27; role and functions were defined and clarified with the passing of the Corrections Act 2004. In early 2006, Corrections officially adopted the Māori name &quot;Ara Poutama Aotearoa&quot;.

==History==
Prior to 1995 the country&#x27;s prisons, probation system and the courts were all managed by the Department of Justice. The Department of Corrections was formed in 1995 by the Department of Justice (Restructuring) Act 1995. This act gave management of prisoners, parolees and offenders on probation to the Department of Corrections while leaving administration of the court system and fines collection with the Ministry of Justice. The intention was to enable the new department to improve public safety and assist in the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders.

In 2012, Corrections Minister Anne Tolley and Associate Corrections Minister Pita Sharples announced the government would spend $65 million over the next four years, with the goal of reducing recidivism by 25 per cent by 2017.

===Growth in prison population===
Since it was established, the department has had to cope with a dramatic growth in the prison population. Between 1997 and 2011 the number of inmates increased by 70% and, at 201 prisoners per 100,000 of population (in 2018), New Zealand has one of the higher rates of imprisonment in the Western world. The Fifth Labour Government built four prisons – at Ngawha (Northern Region) housing 420 prisoners, Spring Hill (north of Huntly) housing 840, Auckland Women&#x27;s housing 330 and Milton (Otago) housing 425 – at a cost of $890 million. When National came to power in 2008, the department built a new 1,000 bed prison at Mt Eden for $218 million in a public private partnership and gave the contract to Serco.

The department&#x27;s growth has been such that in July 2010, Finance Minister Bill English expressed concerns that government spending was &quot;led by a rapidly expanding prison system which would soon make Corrections the government&#x27;s biggest department&quot;. As at December 2011, New Zealand had 20 prisons and the department employed over 8,000 staff. The department&#x27;s operating budget is over $1 billion a year.

Despite English&#x27;s concerns about the growing cost, in 2011 the government approved the building of a new 960-bed prison at Wiri estimated to cost nearly $400 million. Later that year justice sector forecasts showed a drop in the projected prison forecast for the first time. Charles Chauvel, Labour Party spokesperson for justice, and the Public Service Association both questioned the need for a new prison when there were 1,200 empty beds in the prison system. In March 2012, Corrections Minister Anne Tolley announced that the new prison would enable older prisons such as Mt Crawford in Wellington and the New Plymouth prison to be closed. Older units at Arohata, Rolleston, Tongariro/Rangipo and Waikeria prisons will also be shut down.

In 2018, the Labour Government announced a plan to reduce the prison population by 30% over 15 years. As at 30 September 2019, there were 10,040 people in prison in New Zealand. Since then, the prison population has dropped more than 25 per cent, from a peak of 10,820 to 7677 in March 2022.

=== Prison statistics ===

The prison population is very fluid and altogether about 20,000 people spend time in prison each year, the vast majority on remand. Nearly 75% of those given a prison sentence are sentenced to two years or less, and all these are automatically released halfway through their sentence. As 30 September 2019, 93% percent of inmates were male. 51.9% of prisoners were Māori, compared with about 16% of New Zealand&#x27;s resident population. The cost of keeping a person in prison for 12 months is estimated at around $150,000. In 2001 the department estimated that a lifetime of offending by one person costs victims and taxpayers $3 million.

===Rehabilitation policies===
In 2000, a rehabilitation approach based on enhanced computerised access to information about offenders was tried. The new chief executive of the department, Mark Byers, introduced a $40 million scheme designed to reduce reoffending called Integrated Offender Management System (IOMS). At the time it was described as &quot;the biggest single initiative the department has undertaken to reduce reoffending&quot;. Seven years later, Greg Newbold said the scheme was an expensive failure and described it as &quot;another wreck on the scrapheap of abandoned fads of criminal rehabilitation.&quot;

Research suggests that nearly 90% of offenders were alcohol or drug affected in the period leading up to their offence. In 2004 an Ombudsman&#x27;s investigation into the treatment of prisoners found that only 174 inmates a year were able to receive substance abuse treatment. Since then successive governments have responded by establishing additional Drug Treatment Units (DTU&#x27;s) within the prison system. By 2011, this increased the number of prisoners able to attend drug treatment to 1,000 a year. This represents only 5% of the more than 20,000 people who spend time in prison each year. In 2023, the six month drug treatment program reduced reoffending by only 1.9%.

Corrections also offers rehabilitation programmes targeting criminal thinking and decision making. One such programme called Straight Thinking was delivered to offenders in the community and in prison. Between 2000 and 2006 over 10,000 offenders were required to attend this programme until an evaluation found it appeared to increase the likelihood of re-offending rather than reducing it. The Department replaced Straight Thinking with the Medium Intensity Rehabilitation Programme (MIRP). In 2011, an evaluation of the MIRP found that two years after completing this programme, the reduction in recidivism was zero per cent.

In 2012 the government announced that an extra $65 million would be put into rehabilitation, in an effort to reduce re-offending by 25% within five years. Five years later, the Department&#x27;s Annual report for 2018 shows its 17 prison based rehabilitation programmes reduced reoffending by an average of only 5.5%. Only three of the 17 results were considered statistically significant.

=== Reintegration strategies ===
The effectiveness of the Department&#x27;s rehabilitation programmes is undermined by inadequate support when prisoners are released. To assist with reintegration, the Department has identified seven issues or &#x27;reintegration needs&#x27; faced by prisoners on their return to the community; the need for suitable accommodation on release is top of the list. Historically, reintegration has been difficult partly because the Department funds only two halfway houses with a total of 28 beds in the whole country – Salisbury Street Trust in Christchurch and Moana House in Dunedin (co-funded by the Ministry of Health). Less than 1% of the 9,000 prisoners released each year go into them, compared with Canada where 60% of federal prisoners are released into halfway houses. There are no halfway houses funded by Corrections in the North Island where the bulk of prisoners are held. There are no halfway houses for women funded by Corrections anywhere in the country.

===Prison privatisation===
The use of private prisons has also been tried, stopped and reintroduced. New Zealand&#x27;s first privately run prison, the Auckland Central Remand Prison, also known as Mt. Eden Prison, opened under contract to Australasian Correctional Management (ACM) in 2000. In 2004, the Labour government, opposed to privatisation, amended the law to prohibit the extension of private prison contracts. A year later, the 5-year contract with ACM was not renewed. In 2010, the National government again introduced private prisons and international conglomerate Serco was awarded the contract to run the Mt Eden Prison. 

On 16 July 2015, footage of &quot;fight clubs&quot; within the prison emerged online and was reported by TVNZ. Serco was heavily criticised for not investigating until after the footage was screened. On 24 July 2015, Serco&#x27;s contract to run the Mount Eden prison was revoked due to numerous scandals and operation was given back to the New Zealand Department of Corrections. Serco was ordered to pay $8 million to the New Zealand government as a result of problems at Mount Eden Prison while it was under Serco&#x27;s management.

Serco has also been given the contract to build and manage a new 960-bed prison at Wiri. The contract with Serco provides stiff financial penalties if its rehabilitation programmes fail to reduce reoffending by 10% more than the Corrections Department programmes. The Auckland South Corrections Facility was opened on 8 May 2015. The contract to operate the prison ends in 2040.

==Structure==
The department comprises three service arms and four other groups. The service arms are prisons, community probation, and rehabilitation and reintegration and each arm used to have separate internal processes, infrastructure and support staff. As of May 2012 the newly appointed chief executive, Ray Smith proposed merging the three service arms into one team. Smith said the segregated infrastructure &quot;creates replication of work, is inefficient and has resulted in an overly layered structure.&quot;
* Prison Services operates the Department&#x27;s 18 prisons.
* Community Probation Services manage approximately 100,000 community-based sentences and orders per year, and provide information and reports to judges and the New Zealand Parole Board to assist in reaching sentencing and release decisions. Staff also deliver interventions to offenders and prisoners to address their offending behaviour and prepare them for rejoining society.
* Rehabilitation and Reintegration Services delivers interventions to offenders and prisoners to address their offending behaviour. These involve employment, education, constructive activities, specialised treatment services and offence-focused programmes.
* Strategy, Policy and Planning provides strategic planning, policy development and advice, research and evaluation.
* Finance, Systems and Infrastructure provides a range of services that support the delivery of corrections&#x27; core business.
* Organisational Development provides strategic advice and day-to-day support and services to the Chief Executive and Corrections managers on structural and culture change, human resource management and development, employee health and safety, employee relations and employment law
* The Office of the Chief Executive manages key functions on behalf of the Chief Executive and incorporates Business Continuity and Emergency Planning, Corporate Affairs, Internal Audit, Inspectorate, Ministerial Secretariat, Portfolio Management Office, Professional Standards Unit and the Legal Services Team.

==Chief executives==
Mark Byers was chief executive of the Department of Corrections for its first ten years, until he retired from the public service in 2005. Byers oversaw a range of organisational initiatives in his time at the helm and, in 2000, introduced a new computer system called &quot;Integrated Offender Management&quot;. At the time, this was described as &quot;the biggest single initiative the Department has undertaken to reduce reoffending.&quot; IOMS cost $40 million but had no impact of the rate of re-conviction which remained at 55% two years after release.

Barry Matthews, who replaced Byers, had formerly been Deputy Commissioner of Police in New Zealand and the Commissioner of the Western Australian Police Force. He served as chief executive of Corrections for five years from 2005 to 2010 and, in a farewell interview, listed his top three achievements as the implementation of cell phone blocking technology in prisons, better enforcement by the Probation Service of sentence compliance, and the establishment of the Professional Standards Unit to investigate corruption by prison officers.

During Matthews&#x27; tenure there was public concern about the management of the department. Simon Power, opposition spokesman for justice from 2006 through to 2008, made a number of calls for an inquiry into Corrections, but none was held. In 2009 Matthews&#x27; leadership was questioned by the new Corrections Minister, Judith Collins, after a run of bad publicity that included the murder of 17-year-old Liam Ashley in a prison van; the murder of Karl Kuchenbecker by Graeme Burton six months after he was released on parole; and the Auditor General&#x27;s critical report on the Probation Service&#x27;s management of parolees. Matthews exacerbated speculation about his leadership during the Burton debacle when he claimed: &quot;There&#x27;s no blood on my hands&quot;. After the Auditor General&#x27;s report was released in 2009, Collins refused to express confidence in Matthews and media commentators expected him to resign. However, Matthews refused to do so and served out his term; on his retirement he admitted he had dealt with so many crises, the department was like a &quot;landmine&quot;.

Ray Smith, former deputy chief executive of Work and Income and former deputy chief executive of the Ministry of Social Development&#x27;s Child, Youth and Family, was chief executive from 2010 to 2018.

Deputy Chief Executive Jeremy Lightfoot and National Commissioner Rachel Leota shared the acting Chief Executive role from November 2018 until February 2019 when Christine Stevenson, formerly Deputy Chief Executive at Corrections and newly appointed Comptroller of Customs and Chief Executive New Zealand Customs Service, was seconded back to lead the department from February to December 2019.

Jeremy Lightfoot was again Acting Chief Executive from December 2019 to February 2020 when he was permanently appointed as Chief Executive in February 2020.

== Mental health and substance abuse in prison populations ==
A study in 2015 found that about 90% of prisoners had been diagnosed with a mental health or substance abuse disorder during their lifetime. The rate of substance use disordes among prisoners is 13 times higher than the general population. Female prisoners were even more likely to be diagnosed with a mental health or substance abuse disorder than their male counterparts.

=== Suicide in prisons ===
Prisoners are four times more likely to attempt suicide and twice as likely to experience suicidal ideation than the general population. 
One of the factors contributing to the suicide rate is the high rate of mental health problems experienced by prisoners. The &#x27;Health in Justice&#x27; Report conducted in 2010 by the Ministry of Health found 52% of prisoners had a history of psychotic, mood, or anxiety disorders. Twenty percent of those surveyed (about 1,700 prisoners) said they were ‘thinking a lot about suicide’. 

Only limited psychiatric care is available. In its Investigation into Medical and Health Services available to Prisoners, the Ombudsman reported in 2011 that the Corrections Department does not meet Article 22(1) of the United Nations Minimum Standard Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. This article requires every prison to provide psychiatric services to a similar level to that which is available in the community. The Ombudsman found prison healthcare to be &quot;reactive rather than proactive&quot; and mental health care available to prisoners to be &quot;inadequate or unsuitable&quot;.

== Violence in prisons ==
In April 2015, a 44-year-old inmate, Benton Parata, died in Christchurch Men&#x27;s Prison after being bashed by three other prisoners. An expert on gangs in New Zealand, Dr Jarrod Gilbert, said revenge attacks could &quot;snowball&quot; out of control while the prison officers&#x27; union said assaults in New Zealand prisons already occurred almost daily and it was only &quot;good luck&quot; there weren&#x27;t more deaths.

== Recidivism ==
In March 2009 analysis of the previous 60 months, showed that 70% of prisoners reoffend within two years of being released from prison and 52% return to prison within five years (some of them more than once). For teenage prisoners, the recidivism rate (return to prison) is 71%. The government estimated that if it reached its reduced reoffending target of 25%, there would be 600 fewer people in prison by 2017. In 2014, prison numbers went up (to 8,700) rather than down, due to more offenders being held on remand.

<doc id="854209" wikidata="Q99715" url="?curid=854209" title="U55 (Berlin U-Bahn)">
<text>U55 was an U-Bahn line in the German capital city of Berlin. It connected the new Berlin Hauptbahnhof, or main railway station, to an interchange with the S-Bahn at Brandenburger Tor. It had only three stations, did not connect to any other U-Bahn line, and was operated as a shuttle line using a single train.

The line was constructed as part of an extension of the U5 that was subsequently postponed due to financial difficulties. As much of the work on this disconnected section of the extension had been completed, it was decided to complete the section and open it as a separate line in 2009. In 2010, construction began on the intervening section connecting Brandenburger Tor to Alexanderplatz; on 4 June 2018, U55 was closed until December 2018 to accommodate the work needed to connect it to this new phase of the project. The complete project, merging U55 and U5 into a single line, opened on 4 December 2020. Operation of the U55 ceased on 17 March 2020 in preparation for the line&#x27;s incorporation into the U5 extension.

== History ==
=== Origins ===

The unusual nature of U55 reflected Berlin&#x27;s troubled finances. When the German government decided to move from Bonn to Berlin under the Chancellor of Germany Helmut Kohl, who also announced the reunification of Germany on 3 October 1990, it was decided to refurbish the area around the Bundestag into a modern government complex.

As part of this effort, there were plans to extend the U5 from its western terminus at Alexanderplatz through the city centre, past the Brandenburg Gate and the Bundestag, to the new central train station, Berlin Hauptbahnhof. This &quot;Kanzlerlinie&quot; (Chancellor Line), so nicknamed because it passed through the government quarter, was originally planned since the 200km plan as a diagonal line through central Berlin, continuing to Turmstraße in Moabit, where it would link with the U9, and on to Jungfernheide, where it would connect with the S-Bahn ring and U7. The line was also planned to go via Tegel Airport (to be replaced by Urban Tech Republic), Scharnweberstraße towards Rathaus Reinckendorf. As this was a long-planned route, short tunnels exist at both Jungfernheide and Turmstraße to accommodate the new line. Plans were discarded as a tram was also planned to be extended west. For now, the line is only approved to terminate at the Hauptbahnhof, with the route to Jungfernheide and beyond to be built later.

=== Construction ===

On 19 January 2000, construction began on the western end of this extension. However, around that time the city council suffered a major financial crisis.

The city had accepted money from the German federal government for the construction work already finished, and by the terms of the agreement, the city would have had to return the money if there were no operating trains on the line. In 2004, the city and federal governments reached a compromise: the city would complete the short section of line that was largely complete between Berlin Hauptbahnhof and Unter den Linden S-Bahn station (renamed &quot;Brandenburger Tor&quot; in 2009) and run it as a single-track shuttle with a single train, without any signaling. Although transit planners projected that such a shuttle would not attract a significant ridership, the city determined that the cost of building and operating the line would be less than the cost of returning the money to the federal government.

=== Opening ===
The opening of the line between Berlin Hauptbahnhof and Brandenburger Tor was delayed owing to extreme groundwater problems at the site of the latter new station. It was finally opened on 8 August 2009.

== Operation ==
===Stations===
With the opening of the U-Bahn station, the existing Unter den Linden S-Bahn station was renamed &quot;Brandenburger Tor&quot; (for the nearby Brandenburg Gate). The name &quot;Unter den Linden&quot; was then given to a new station further east at the junction with Friedrichstraße, where the U5 intersects the U6.

The train ran every 10 minutes and, due to the low demand, there was no night service.

===Rolling stock===

Because the U55 was not physically connected to the rest of the U-Bahn system, any trains being delivered to the new line had to be taken by low loaders on the street and set on track through a tunnel opening located north of Hauptbahnhof station. There was also a provisional workshop for the basic maintenance and cleaning of carriages.

Formerly, trains running on the U55 were F79 trains. However, due to a lack of trains on other large profile U-Bahn lines, the two U55 trains were removed and placed on the U6 in April 2017. Instead, an older D class train was renovated and placed into service until March 2020.

== Linking U55 and U5 ==
The designation of the line as U55 indicated that it was ultimately intended to become part of the U5 line. Construction of the link to enable this commenced in April 2010, and was originally expected to be completed by 2017. Construction works suffered from continued difficulties, mainly concerning high water contents in the soil; in November 2015 the opening date was postponed, with the link finally opening on 4 December 2020.

The link is in length, connecting the former U55 terminus at Brandenburger Tor with the rest of the U5 at Alexanderplatz. The link features three new U-Bahn stations at Rotes Rathaus, Museumsinsel and Unter den Linden. Unter Den Linden provides an interchange with line U6, replacing the former Französische Straße station, located a little further to the south on Friedrichstraße, which closed on 3 December 2020.

==End of operations==
Operations on the line ceased on 17 March 2020, until its incorporation into the new U5 line on 4 December of that year. This took place earlier than originally planned due to much lower ridership as a result of the COVID-19 crisis.

==Reopened as U5 Line==
The three stations reopened as a part of U5 Line Eastern extension on 4 December 2020.

<doc id="854210" wikidata="Q558714" url="?curid=854210" title="Muhammad Shah">
<text>Mirza Nasir-ud-Din Muḥammad Shah (born Roshan Akhtar; 7 August 1702 – 26 April 1748) was the thirteenth Mughal emperor from 1719 to 1748. He was son of Khujista Akhtar, the fourth son of Bahadur Shah I. After being chosen by the Sayyid Brothers of Barha, he ascended the throne at the young age of 16, under their strict supervision. 

He later got rid of them with the help of Nizam-ul-Mulk, Asaf Jah I – Syed Hussain Ali Khan was murdered at Fatehpur Sikri in 1720 and Sayyid Hassan Ali Khan Barha was captured in battle in 1720 and fatally poisoned in 1722. Muhammad Shah was a great patron of the arts, including musical, cultural and administrative developments, he is thus often referred to as Muhammad Shah Rangila (). His pen-name was &quot;Sadrang&quot; and he is also sometimes referred to as &quot;Bahadur Shah Rangila&quot; after his grand father Bahadur Shah I.

Muhammad Shah&#x27;s reign was marked by rapid and irreversible decline of the Mughal Empire that was exacerbated by Nader Shah&#x27;s invasion of India and the sacking of Delhi in 1739. The course of events not only shocked and mortified the Mughals themselves, but also other foreigners, including the British.

== Rebellious activities against Muhammad Shah ==
In 1719, Kolis of Mahi River were most rebellious against Mughal rule and plundering the villages, Mihir Ali Khan who was acting as Viceroy of Gujarat at the place of Ajit Singh of Marwar, marched against Koli rebels of Mahi who were committing piracy against Muslims and subdued them.

In 1721, Kasim Ali Khan who was an officer in Mughal Empire under Muuhammad Shah employed against the Kolis of Kheda district to collect the fine but they refused to pay and there was a battle in Pethapur between Kolis and Mughal army under Kasim Ali Khan. Kasim Ali Khan was killed by Kolis and Mughal army was defeated and retreat to base.* 

In 1722, Muhammad Bahadur, son of Salabat Khan Babi, was placed in charge of Sadra and Virpur, with the title of Sher Khan. Shortly after his arrival the viceroy marched against and subdued the rebellious Kolis of the Chunval but was wounded deeply. After that Kolis of Modhera opposed the Muhammad Shah but Modhera village was burnt down.

In 1729, Mughal Viceroy of Sultan Muhammad Shah faced the challenge of anti-muslim activities of Kolis of Sorath, viceroy marches against Kolis of sorath and destroying them taken to Ahmednagar. after this, Jawan Mard Khan Babi who was Governor of Petlad ordered against rebellious Kolis of Balor, probably Bhátod about fifteen miles east of Bharuch, but Jawan Marad Khan was killed by a man of Koli tribe, and in revenge for his death the town of Balor was plundered. On the death of Jawán Mard Khan, at the request of Salabat Muhammad Khan Babi, his eldest son Kamal-ud-din Khan Babi received the districts of Sami and Munjpur and the title of Jawan Mard Khan.

In 1738, Sher Khan Babi was of Junagadh was appointed as governor of sorath, Babi was obliged to march against a Koli chieftain Kanji Chunvalia of Chhaniar in Chunval because Kanji opposed and resisted the mughal authority but Sher Khan Babi was bravely resisted by Kolis so Momin Khan was called with large force and Chhaniar was burned down by mughal army.

In 1739, Koli chieftain Jamaji of Thara, raised the Kolis of Kankrej against sultan and continually plundered the mughal territory. Jawan Marad Khan was ordered to march against the Koli chieftain but he was unable to maintain order so he requested the Fida-ud-din Khan to subdue the Kolis. After defeating the Koli chieftain, the Koli country was plundered by mughal troops.

In 1740, Kolis of Atarsumba, challenged the Mughal authority and refused to pay any form of tax to mughal sultan. Jawan marad khan along with his brother Zorawar Khan Babi Marched against Kolis of Atarsumba but they were strongly resisted and there was a battle but mughals defeated the Kolis and make them to pay tax. But it was not for long time, after some time, Kolis again refused to pay tax and mughal troops were sent under Abdul Hussain Khan and Vajeram burnt the three Koli villages.

In 1747, Rangoji a Maratha military leader returned to Áhmedábád, and Jawán Mard Khán had an interview with him a few miles from the city. Shortly after this the Kolis of Mehmudabad and Mahudha rebelled, but the revolt was speedily crushed by Sháhbáz Rohilla.

==Early reign==
=== Removing the Sayyid Brothers ===
On 9 October 1720, Syed Hussain Ali Khan Barha, the commander and chief of the Mughal army, was assassinated in his encampment in Todabhim and Muhammad Shah took direct command of the army. Asaf Jah I was then dispatched to gain complete control of six Mughal provinces in the Deccan, and Muhammad Amin Khan Turani was assigned as the Mansabdar of 8000. He was sent to pursue the Mughal Grand vizier Syed Hassan Ali Khan Barha, who was defeated at the battle of Hasanpur by Muhammad Amin Turani, Khan-i Dauran, Sher Afkan Panipati, and Amin-ud-Din Sambhali. Hassan Khan Barha fought on the side opposing Khan-i-Dauran where the most danger was anticipated, was captured on 15 November 1720 and executed two years later. The fall of the Sayyid Brothers would mark the beginning of the end of the Mughal Empire&#x27;s direct control over its dominions in the Deccan.

=== Loss of Deccan &quot;subahs&quot; ===

On 21 February 1722, Muhammad Shah appointed the Asaf Jah I as Grand Vizier. He advised Muhammad Shah to be &quot;as cautious as Akbar and as brave as Aurangzeb&quot;. Asaf Jah used his influence with the emperor to fulfil his territorial ambitions in the Deccan. He lost the emperor&#x27;s confidence when he appointed Hamid Khan, a relative to Saadullah Khan and his maternal uncle, to administer Gujarat after having sending him on the pretext of restoring order to the province. Realising his loss of influence and trust from the emperor, Asaf Jah resigned as Grand Vizier and returned to the Deccan.

Asaf Jah I appointed commander Ewaz Khan as the master of the garrison at Aurangabad, and much of his logistical duties were carried out by Inayatullah Kashmiri. In 1723 he set out on an expedition to the Deccan, where he fought Mubariz Khan, the Mughal Subahdar of the Deccan, who had kept the ravaging Maratha Empire at bay. Mubariz Khan was a former ally of the Barha Sayyids, who was appointed by Muhammad Shah to kill Asaf Jah I. Taking advantage of Mubariz Khan&#x27;s conventional weaknesses, Asaf Jah I defeated and eliminated his opponent during the Battle of Shakar Kheda. Asaf Jah I then established the Hyderabad State and appointed himself the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1725. 

The Mughal-Maratha Wars (1728–1763) would cause irreparable devastation to six Deccan &quot;subahs&quot;–Khandesh, Bijapur, Berar, Aurangabad, Hyderabad and Bidar. Asaf Jah would the Marathas to invade Malwa and the northern territories of the Mughal empire to protect his newfound independence. The Nizam described the Maratha army to be an instrument to be wielded to his own advantage in the &quot;Maasir-i Nizami&quot;:
&quot;I consider all this army (Marathas) as my own and I will get my work done through them. It is necessary to take our hands off Malwa. God willing, I will enter into an understanding with them and entrust the &quot;Mulukgiri&quot; (raiding) on that side of the Narmada to them.&quot;
The ears of the Muhammed Shah were possessed by the Amir-ul-Umara, Khan-i Dauran. Muhammad Shah appointed Qamar-ud-Din Khan as Grand Wazir to succeed Asaf Jah. However, he was quickly dismissed in favour of Roshan-ud-Daulah Turrah Baz Khan, a native of Panipat, who was appointed the Grand Wazir, in order to reduce the influence of the Turani family. 

Despite the loss of the Deccan &quot;subahs&quot; in 1724, the Nawab of Awadh Saadat Ali Khan and the Mughal &quot;subahdar&quot; Dilawar Khan (r. 1726–1756) remained loyal to the emperor and established a well-protected bastion on the Malabar Coast.

===Cultural developments===


While Urdu (derived from &quot;Zuban-i Urdū-yi Muʿallá&quot; or in local translation &quot;Lashkari Zaban&quot;, shortened to &quot;Lashkari&quot;) was already in use before Muhammad Shah&#x27;s reign, it was during his reign that it became more popular among the people and he declared it as the court language, replacing Persian. During Muhammad Shah&#x27;s reign, Qawwali was reintroduced into the Mughal imperial court and it quickly spread throughout South Asia. Muhammad Shah is also known to have introduced religious institutions for education such as Maktabs. During his reign, the Quran was translated for the first time into simple Persian and Urdu. Also, during his reign, the formal Turkic dress, normally worn by the high Mughal nobility since Mughals originally hailed from Samarqand, was replaced by the Sherwani. However, Muhammad Shah&#x27;s adoption of the Deccan-influenced dress to court would lead to derisive comments, such as &quot;See how the Deccan monkey dances!&quot;

Mohammad Shah was a patron of the performing arts, almost at the cost of administrative priorities, paving the way for the disintegration of governance. While Mughal political power did decline in his reign, the Emperor encouraged the arts, employing master artists such as Nidha Mal (active 1735–75) and Chitarman, whose vivacious paintings depict scenes of court life, such as Holi celebrations, hunting and hawking. The Mughal court of the time had musicians such as Naimat Khan, also known as Sadarang, and his nephew Firoz Khan (Adarang), whose compositions popularised the musical form of khyal. Naimat Khan composed khyal for his disciples and he never performed khyal. This key component of Indian classical music evolved, ascended and received princely patronage at the court of Muhammad Shah.

He himself was a poet under the penname &quot;Sadrang&quot; and was also a composer of Indian classical raga songs in the bhairav, kafi, dhamar and malkauns genres. These included songs on the themes of love and the festival of Holi.

===Scientific developments===
During the reign of Muhammad Shah, a significant scientific work known as the Zij-i Muhammad Shahi was completed by Jai Singh II of Amber between the year 1727 and 1735; it consisted of 400 pages.

=== Bengal and Sikhs raids ===

Muhammad Ali Khan the Mughal Faujdar of Rangpur and his stern ally Deena Narayan were ambushed out of Koch Bihar by Upendra Narayan a Hindu Bihari and Mipham Wangpo (r. 1729–1736) the ruler of Bhutan. Ali Mohammed Khan had established the barons of Rohilakhand. In the Punjab region, the Sikhs were at war with local Mughal &quot;subahdars&quot;, devastating them with their hit-and-run tactics.

=== Loss of Gujarat and Malwa &quot;subahs&quot; ===
After decisively defeating Asaf Jah in February 1728 at the Battle of Palkhed, Bajirao I and his brother Chimaji Appa re-invaded Malwa. The Mughal &quot;subahdar&quot; Giridhar Bahadur was defeated and killed at the battle of Amjhera in November 1729. Chimnaji Appa then unsuccessfully attempted to besiege the remnants of the Mughal army at Ujjain. In 1731, Asaf Jah managed to secure the defections of influential Maratha leaders, such as Trimbak Rao Dabhade and Sanbhoji who threatened to abandon the Marathas and join the forces with the emperor Muhammad Shah. However, the defectors were overrun and killed by a large Maratha force led by Bajirao I and Chimnaji Appa during Battle of Dabhoi. Bajirao I then attacked Gujarat with his full force and drove out Sarbuland Khan by 1735.

Bajirao I defeated a well-trained Mughal army led by Amir Khan Bahadur, but was forced to withdraw when well-armed Mughal reinforcements fought major skirmishes with the Marathas on the outskirts of Delhi. Bajirao and his Marathas fled southeast to Badshahpur, where he corresponded with the emperor Muhammad Shah, who ratified peace by agreeing the handover of Malwa to the Marathas.

== Invasion of Nader Shah ==

=== Invasion of Mughal empire ===
In May 1738, Nader Shah attacked northern Afghanistan and captured Ghazni. He captured Kabul in June and Jalalabad in September. By November, he had crossed the Khyber Pass and besieged and razed the fortress of Peshawar. In January 1739, he captured Lahore, after completely subduing the forces of the Mughal viceroy, Zakariya Khan Bahadur and his 25,000 &quot;sowars&quot;, by the Chenab river. The Afsharid forces soon encountered bands of Sikh rebels whom Nader Shah predicted would clearly benefit after his invasion. The Afsharids would capture territory all the way up to Attock, forcing Muhammad Shah and his court to realise that the Persian emperor would not be satisfied with the loot of a province. The cities of Wazirabad, Eminabad and Gujrat were not only sacked but razed to the ground. Near Larkana, the Afsharids completely routed the Mughal army of the Nawab of Sindh, Main Noor Mohammad Kalhoro, and later captured him and his two sons. Sirhind was then captured by the Persians in February 1739, opening the route towards the Mughal capital of Delhi. 

=== Battle of Karnal ===

Rao Bal Kishan of Rewari, with his army of 5,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry and with the forces of Delhi, attempted a desperate defence of the city but was killed in battle and has been immortalized the name &quot;&quot;Vijay&quot; or &quot;Veergati&quot;. Nadir Shah remarked to emperor Muhammad Shah that &quot;if your combined forces helped Rao Balkrishna of Rewari, then I might not able to enter in Delhi. I had never seen any warrior like him brave, Fierce and strong. Muhammed Shah commissioned a royal &quot;chhatri&quot; to pay tribute to Rao Bal Kishan.

After entering Delhi, Nader Shah claimed to invasion and occupation of the Mughal Empire was borne out of religious devotion and that if &quot;the wretched Marathas of the Deccan&quot; moved towards Delhi, he might &quot;send an army of victorious Qizilbash to drive them to the abyss of Hell.&quot;
=== Sack of Delhi ===


The occupation of Delhi was initially cordial, however, rumours spread throughout the city that Nader Shah was assassinated. The masses attacked the Persian force and killed some soldiers. Nader Shah became furious, ordered to massacre the populace, and leaving at least 30,000 dead. Muhammad Shah and Asaf Jah I had to beg Nader Shah for mercy and thus he stopped the massacre and turned to looting the Mughal treasury. The famous Peacock Throne, the Daria-i-Noor and Koh-i-Noor diamonds and unimaginable wealth was looted. In addition, elephants, horses and everything that was liked was taken. Muhammad Shah also had to hand over his daughter Jahan Afruz Banu Begum as a bride for Nader Shah&#x27;s youngest son. Asaf Jah I retired to Deccan after installing his eldest son Intizam-ud-Daula as a major commander in the Mughal Army.

== Later Maratha wars ==
In the year 1740, Dost Ali Khan to Nawab of the Carnatic and Chanda Sahib faced the task of expelling the Marathas under Raghoji I Bhonsle, authorised by Chhatrapati Shahu I. Dost Ali Khan was killed on 20 May 1740 at the Battle of Damalcherry in defence of Arcot, which was eventually looted and plundered. Chanda Sahib along with his garrison was captured and imprisoned in Satara. Chanda Sahib and his forces ferociously defended their rightful reams during the Siege of Trichinopoly and almost all the territories of the Nawab of the Carnatic despite being outnumbered substantially by the Marathas, their daunting efforts soon attracted the attention of the French East India Company official Joseph François Dupleix. 

Dissatisfied by the Maratha occupation of the territories of the Nawab of the Carnatic, Asaf Jah I led an expedition to liberate the region. He was joined by Sadatullah Khan II and Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan together they recaptured Arcot and initiated the Siege of Trichinopoly (1743), which lasted five months and forced the Marathas led by Murari Rao Ghorpade to evacuate the Carnatic.

In the year 1747, the Marathas led by Raghoji I Bhonsle, began to raid, pillage and annex the territories of the Nawab of Bengal Alivardi Khan. During the Maratha invasion of Orissa, its &quot;subahdar&quot; Mir Jafar completely withdrew all forces until the arrival of Alivardi Khan and the Mughal Army at the Battle of Burdwan where Raghoji I Bhonsle and his Maratha forces were completely routed. The enraged Nawab of Bengal Alivardi Khan then dismissed the shamed Mir Jafar. However, due to four years of continuous wars, emperor Muhammad Shah was forced to cede Orissa to the Marathas.

==Foreign relations==
Following Nader Shah&#x27;s invasion, the Ottoman Empire exploited the void that was created at their eastern borders as almost all Persian forces were deployed to India. During that period, emperor Muhammad Shah tried to recover all territory until being attacked by the Durrani Empire at Battle of Manupur.

==Marriages==
Emperor Muhammad Shah had four wives. His first wife and chief consort was his first-cousin, Princess Badshah Begum, the daughter of Emperor Farrukhsiyar and his first wife, Gauhar-un-Nissa Begum. They married after his accession, on 8 December 1721, at Delhi, and he gave her the title &quot;Malika-uz-Zamani&quot; (Queen of the Age) by which she was popularly known. They had a son, Shahriyar Shah Bahadur, who died young in 1726. She died on 14 December 1789. 

Muhammad Shah took a second wife, Sahiba Mahal, and had a daughter Hazrat Begum, who was married to Ahmad Shah Durrani in 1757.

His third wife was a dancing girl, Qudsia Begum, Begum of Bhopal, who bore him his successor, Ahmad Shah Bahadur on 23 December 1725. Upon his birth, he was taken from her and was lovingly brought up by Badshah Begum, who considered him her own son. It was through Badshah Begum&#x27;s efforts that Ahmad Shah was able to ascend the throne upon Muhammad Shah&#x27;s death in 1748.

==Death==

The victory of the Mughal Army during the Battle of Manupur (1748) came with a heavy price as many fell in battle. Initially this was kept a secret. However, when the news reached the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah, he could not speak, suddenly became sick, and did not come out of his apartments for three days. During this period he fasted. His guards could hear him crying out loud and saying: &quot;How could I bring about anyone as faithful as he? (Qamaruddin Khan)&quot;. He died due to grief on 26 April 1748, his funeral was attended by visiting Imams from Mecca. Muhammad Shah&#x27;s tomb is located in an enclosure within the Nizamuddin Dargah complex.

==In popular culture==
* In the 2010 historical TV series &quot;Maharaja Ranjit Singh&quot; telecasted on DD National, the character of Muhammad Shah is portrayed by Rishikesh Sharma.

<text>Schneeball was a German record label founded in 1976.

Embryo, Missus Beastly, Sparifankal, Ton Steine Scherben and Julius Schittenhelm decided to take their fate into their own hands in 1976. Setting themselves apart from the phonograph industry, they founded their own record company (APRIL Records) and cooperatively organized the distribution. “Music distributed by the musicians” was the primary guiding principle.
There were no European models to imitate, although the Filmverlag der Autoren [Authors’ Film Publishing Company] was surely groundbreaking at the beginning. Established several years previously, it had succeeded in marginally pushing back the market power of the Anglo-American media flood so the filmmakers who belonged to it could make a living for themselves.
The start of APRIL Records was extraordinarily successful and attracted much attention. After CBS threatened to take legal action, its name was changed to “Schneeball” [“Snowball”] in 1977. The situation was quite difficult, but samplers entitled “April ist Schneeball” [“April is Snowball”] enabled it to remain recognizable in the music and media landscapes. The name was chosen to express the energy in the center of the music spectrum and the expansion and development along its margins. Many others subsequently used APRIL Records as a model. Within a short time, numerous bands wanted to be part of it. Other artists who published at Schneeball are Real Ax Band, Munju, Checkpoint Charlie, Moira, and Hammerfest. An important cooperating partner for distribution via bookstores was the Trikont label “Unsere Stimme” [“Our Voice”], which had sprouted from Trikont Buchverlag [Trikont Book Publishing Company]. At the same time, the “Umsonst und draußen” [“Free and Outdoors”] festival movement developed as an organizational form for noncommercial music festivals. New labels were founded, including, for example, NO FUN, Zickzack, Eigelstein, Subup, and Trikont.
The distribution was taken over by EfA(Energie für Alle) [Energy for Everyone] at the beginning of the 1980s. Schneeball Oper 1 und 2 [Snowball Operas 1 and 2] were developed as a new cooperative project by the musicians from the various bands. This showed that a mutual willingness existed to collaborate beyond the horizons of each individual band.
The distribution structure became increasingly independent, but this autonomy unfortunately proved detrimental to the interests of the producing artists. Consequently, Efa and INDIGO Musikvertrieb [INDIGO Music Distribution] separated in 1992.

Schneeball&#x27;s most productive era was already over by the mid-1980s. The reasons were manifold. Ton Stein Scherben broke up. Rio Reiser began a solo career at Sony. At EMBRYO too, many years of collaboration among the musicians and composers Christian Burchard, Roman Bunka and Uve Müllrich came to an end after a trip to India – but not before the releases of the double LP “EMBRYO’s Reise” [“EMBRYO’s Trip”], a road movie, and a music documentary film “Vagabundenkarawane” [“Caravan of Vagabonds”] by Werner Penzel and Nico Humpert.

EMBRYO&#x27;s dissidents hived off, joined forces with Hartmut Bremer, and co-founded the EXIL [EXILE] label, likewise at INDIGO. Christian Burchard formed EMBRYO anew with different personnel. Sparifankal switched to a new label and a new distributor. A great die-off of the pioneering German bands began, and no one wept to see the trailblazers disappear. Punk, Neue deutsche Welle, disco: the audience&#x27;s orientations had changed.

Othmar Schreckeneder, EMBRYO&#x27;s producer since 1972, continued to publish audio recordings until the mid-1990s on the Schneeball label with EMBRYO and its guest musicians from diverse cultures and countries. He also published radio plays for Bayerischer Rundfunk [Bavarian Radio] (Ernst Jandl, Grace Yoon) and works by artists such as Eugen de Ryck, Chris Karrer, and Amon Düül II.

EMBRYO switched to Trikont, thus remaining under Indigo&#x27;s distribution. Only Schreckeneder continued to use the label for occasional new releases, e.g. Charlie Mariano with Rama Mani in 2005 or Peter Michael Hamel with Thomas Gundermann in 2014.

Schneeball was the trailblazer of the “Independent Label” movement, which conquered its place in the global music industry.
