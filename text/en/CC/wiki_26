<text>Unión de Jóvenes Patriotas (Union of Patriotic Youth) was the youth organization of the Colombian leftist formation &quot;Patriotic Union&quot; (UP).

== History ==
Like the main UP party, the UJP was severely persecuted by the agents of drug lords, paramilitaries and rogue elements inside the Colombian military during the 1980s. Many left-wing groups in Colombia have denounced the extermination of the UP and the UJP as part of a politically motivated strategy emanating from powerful sectors of Colombian society, including drug lords and some members of the traditional socioeconomic elites, which would have counted with the passive or active collaboration of several officers within the Colombian military and allegedly the indifference or tacit approval from contemporary administrations, in particular that of Virgilio Barco Vargas.

No proven direct links between the murders of UP members and high-ranking Colombian officials have been uncovered, though there is some documented evidence of the existence of organized meetings concerning the subject of the UP between drug lords, paramilitaries and lower-to-medium ranking military individuals at the time. Several drug mafia or paramilitary hitmen and lower-ranking military officials which directly cooperated with illegal death squads at the time were prosecuted for some of the killings, though the vast majority of the cases have remained unresolved. Among the few intellectual co-authors of the extermination campaign which have been identified with a relatively clear degree of certainty are drug lords (such as José Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha) and paramilitary leaders (such as Carlos Castaño Gil, by his own admission).

The UJP was a member of World Federation of Democratic Youth, and was disbanded in the early 1990s.

<text>Loevestein Castle ( ) is a medieval castle in the municipality of Zaltbommel, Gelderland, the Netherlands.

The castle was built by the knight Dirk Loef of Horne (hence &quot;Loef&#x27;s stein&quot; (stone) house) between 1357 and 1397. Until World War II Loevestein Castle was part of the Dutch Waterline, the main Dutch defense line that was based on flooding an area of land south and east of the western provinces. Currently the castle is used as a medieval museum and function centre.

==History==

Loevestein is a water castle that was built between 1357 and 1368. It was built in a strategic location in the middle of the Netherlands, where the Maas and Waal rivers come together (just west of current day villages of Poederoijen and Brakel, in the municipality of Zaltbommel, in Gelderland). At first it was a simple square brick building, used to extract tolls from trading vessels plying the rivers. By 1372, the castle was under control of the Counts of Holland. In the 16th century (around 1575, on orders given by William the Silent) it was expanded to a larger fortress surrounded by earthen fortifications with two (later three) stone bastions on the northern side, two moats, an arsenal, and barracks for a commander and soldiers, and castle was integrated into the Hollandic Water Line.

It changed hands twice between the Northern Dutch and the Spanish during the Eighty Years&#x27; War: first on December 9, 1570, it was taken by the Geuzen, then ten days later by the Spanish; on June 25, 1572, it was retaken by the Dutch.

From 1619 the castle became a prison for political prisoners. One famous inmate was the eminent lawyer, poet and politician Hugo de Groot (Hugo Grotius) often presented as the &quot;father of modern international law&quot;, who was serving a controversially imposed life sentence from 1619, over his involvement in the controversies over religious policy of the Dutch Republic. In 1621, his wife Maria van Reigersberch, who was also staying at the castle, hid with him in a book chest that was regularly brought for them. He subsequently became the Swedish Ambassador to France for 10 years. Another high-profile inmate was the English Vice-Admiral George Ayscue.

==In literature==
In Alexandre Dumas, père&#x27;s novel La Tulipe Noire, the main character Cornelius Van Baerle is imprisoned at Loevestein.

<doc id="851755" wikidata="Q4393304" url="?curid=851755" title="Computer fan control">
<text>Fan control is the management of the rotational speed of an electric fan. In computers, various types of computer fans are used to provide adequate cooling, and different fan control mechanisms balance their cooling capacities and noise they generate. This is commonly accomplished by the motherboards having hardware monitoring circuitry, which can be configured by the end-user through BIOS or other software to perform fan control.

== Need for fan control ==
As modern PCs grow more powerful so do their requirements for electrical power. Computers emit this electrical power as heat generated by all major components. Heat production varies with system load, where periods of compute-intensive activity generate much more heat than the idle time does.

Processors in most early x86-based computers, up to some of the early 486s, did not need active ventilation. Power supplies needed forced cooling, and power supply fans also circulated cooling air through the rest of the PC with the ATX standard. The byproduct of increased heat generation is that the fan(s) need to move increasing amounts of air and thus need to be more powerful. Since they must move more air through the same area of space, fans will become more noisy.

Fans installed in a PC case can produce noise levels of up to 70 dB. Since fan noise increases with the fifth power of the fan rotation speed, reducing revolutions per minute (RPM) by a small amount potentially means a large reduction in fan noise. This must be done cautiously, as excessive reduction in speed may cause components to overheat and be damaged. If done properly, fan noise can be drastically reduced.

== Fan connectors ==
The common cooling fans used in computers use standardized connectors with two to four pins. The first two pins are always used to deliver power to the fan motor, while the rest can be optional, depending on fan design and type:
* Ground common ground
* Vcc (Power) nominally a +12 V supply, though it may be variable depending on fan type and desired fan rotation speed
* Sense (or tachometer) output from fan outputs a signal that pulses twice for each revolution of the fan as a pulse train, with the signal frequency proportional to the fan speed
* Control input a pulse-width modulation (PWM) input signal, used when the cooling fan assembly has an internal motor driver circuit. Fan assemblies with this control input provide the ability to adjust the rotational speed of the fan without changing the input voltage delivered to the cooling fan assembly. A variable rotation speed allows the cooling rate to be adjusted to meet demand, quietening the fan and saving energy when full speed is not required.

The color of the wires connected to these pins varies depending on the number of connectors, but the role of each pin is standardized and guaranteed to be the same on any system. Cooling fans equipped with either two- or three-pin connectors are usually designed to accept a wide range of input voltages, which directly affects the rotation speed of the blades.

== Types of control ==
=== Thermostatic ===
In this style of fan control, the fan is either on or off. Temperature inside the chassis is checked, and if an outside-of-range temperature is detected, fans are set to their maximum speed. When the temperature drops below a threshold again, the fans are turned back off. This control method reduces noise issues and power requirements during periods of low usage, but when the system is operating at capacity, the fan noise can become a problem again.

=== Linear voltage regulation ===
A standard cooling fan is a DC motor with blades attached. By varying the voltage input across the acceptable range for a fan, the speed of the fan will increase (to added voltage) and decrease (to reduced voltage); a faster fan means more air moved and thus a higher heat exchange rate. There are a few ways to perform this regulation, as described below.

==== Resistors ====
Resistors in series with a fan&#x27;s power pin are the simplest method of reducing fan noise, but they add to the heat generated inside the computer case. Since the voltage drop is proportional to the current, the fan may not start. They need to be of the appropriate power rating. For variable fan control, potentiometers could be used along with a transistor such as a MOSFET whose output voltage is controlled by the potentiometer. It is possible to use a rheostat instead.

==== Diodes ====
A diode in series with the fan will reduce the voltage being output to the fan. A silicon diode provides a relatively constant voltage drop of about 0.7 V per diode; data sheets for a specific diode specify its voltage drop, for example the 1N4001 silicon diode&#x27;s voltage drop varies from approximately 0.7 to 0.9 V as the current varies from 0.01 to 1 A. The power rating should be noted and some diodes may require cooling to operate at their rated current. The voltage drop across the diode will fall with temperature, causing the fan to speed up.

Like other series regulators, the diode will dissipate power equal to its voltage drop times the current passing through it.

==== Voltage modification (&quot;volt modding&quot;) ====
The voltage a computer cooling fan receives is defined by the difference between the voltage wire (+12 V) and the ground wire (+0 V). By connecting one or both wires to a different voltage, the voltage the fan receives will be different from the default 12 V the fan was designed for.

Increasing the voltage over the default 12 V can be achieved by e.g. connecting the −12 V or −5 V power line instead of the ground wire in the fan connector, and by connecting the 5 V power line in the +12 V input of the fan connector. Through this procedure, 10, 17 and 24 V voltages can be achieved, with voltages exceeding 12 V being potentially damaging to the computer fans rated at 12 V. However, the combination of modern power supplies no longer being required to provide a −5 V power line and the limited power delivery capability of the −12 V line (usually less than 1 A of current) reduces the total capacity for volt modded fans in modern systems.

Connecting the +5 V power line to the +12 V input of the fan reduces the voltage the fan receives to +5 V. Some fans will not work at such low voltage at all, while some other fans may run at +5 V once they have started rotating at a reasonable speed.

Another method of reducing the fan speed is by moving the 5 V wire in the classical Molex power connector in the place of the Ground wire going to the fan, thereby delivering +7 V (12 V − 5 V = 7 V) to the fan. However, this is a potentially risky method, because +5 V PSU line is intended to source current only, not sink it, so the PSU is likely to get damaged in case of load on 5 V PSU line being below the load generated by 7 V fans (e.g. when PC enters idle/sleep state). Also, the components inside the computer using +5 V power might be exposed to over 5 V in case of a short circuit in the fan.

==== Integrated or discrete linear regulators ====

Common voltage regulator ICs like the popular LM78xx series are sometimes used to provide variable or constant voltage to fans. When thermally bonded to the computer&#x27;s chassis, one of these ICs can provide up to 1 A of current at a voltage of 6, 8, 9 or 10 V for the LM7806, LM7808, LM7809 and LM7810, respectively. Adjustable versions like the popular LM317 also exist; when combined with a potentiometer, these adjustable regulators allow the user to vary the fan speed of several fans at currents far in excess of what a standard potentiometer could handle.

For higher currents, discrete linear regulators are relatively simple to construct using a power transistor or MOSFET and a small signal transistor or a Zener diode as a voltage reference. While discrete regulators require additional components (a minimum of two transistors, three resistors and a small capacitor), they allow for arbitrarily high currents, allowing for the regulation of additional fans and accessories.

As with other linear regulators, the waste heat that is produced will be roughly .

=== Pulse-width modulation ===
Pulse-width modulation (PWM) is a common method of controlling computer fans. A PWM-capable fan is usually connected to a 4-pin connector (pinout: Ground, +12 V, sense, control). The sense pin is used to relay the rotation speed of the fan and the control pin is an open-drain or open-collector output, which requires a pull-up to 5 V or 3.3 V in the fan. Unlike linear voltage regulation, where the fan voltage is proportional to the speed, the fan is driven with a constant supply voltage; the speed control is performed by the fan based on the control signal.

The control signal is a square wave operating at 25 kHz, with the duty cycle determining the fan speed. 25 kHz is used to raise the sound of the signal above the range of human hearing; use of a lower frequency could produce an audible hum or whine. Typically a fan can be driven between about 30% and 100% of the rated fan speed, using a signal with up to 100% duty cycle. The exact speed behavior at low control levels (linear, off until a threshold value, or a minimum speed until a threshold) is manufacturer dependent.

Many motherboards feature firmware and software that regulates these fans based on processor and computer case temperatures.

=== Fan speed controllers ===
Another method, popular with PC hardware enthusiasts, is the manual fan speed controller. They can be mounted in an expansion slot or a 5.25&quot; or 3.5&quot; drive bay or come built into a computer&#x27;s case. Using switches or knobs, attached fans can have their speeds adjusted by one of the above methods.

== Hardware ==
Most modern motherboards feature hardware monitoring chips, which are capable of performing fan control, usually through the PWM method as described above. These chips can be configured through BIOS, or by using specialised software once the operating system has booted.

Processors produce varying levels of heat depending on system load, thus it makes sense to reduce the speed of the fans during idle to decrease the noise produced by fans running full speed, until the load does goes up, at which point fan speed must be adjusted promptly to avoid overheating. Modern hardware monitor chips, once configured, are capable of independently running this monitoring loop without any need for a functioning BIOS or an operating system. This automatic control offered by some chips may be called Thermal Cruise mode for maintaining a thermal envelope, as well as Fan Speed Cruise mode for maintaining a specific fan speed automatically.

However, not all software is capable of accessing these advanced configuration parameters provided by some chips, and it is very common that the generic software implements only the most basic interfacing with the chips, namely, an explicit setting for the duty cycle for each fan control setting, subsequently performing the duty cycle adjustments itself in software, and thus requiring that both the operating system, as well as this third-party software itself to continue running on the main CPU to perform the monitoring loop. This may not be a problem until the system or the utility crashes, at which point the system may overheat due to the failure of the fans to maintain adequate cooling whilst running at reduced voltage and speed.

== Software ==
Many companies now provide software to control fan speeds on their motherboards under Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X/MacOS. Different software is used by different motherboards. There are also third-party programs that work on a variety of motherboards and allow wide customization of fan behavior depending on temperature readings from the motherboard, CPU, and GPU sensors, as well as allowing manual control. Two such programs are SpeedFan and Argus Monitor.

<doc id="851759" wikidata="Q4952713" url="?curid=851759" title="Boys from the Blackstuff">
<text>Boys from the Blackstuff is a five episode British drama television series, originally transmitted from 10 October to 7 November 1982 on BBC2.

The serial was written by Liverpudlian playwright Alan Bleasdale, as a sequel to a television play titled &quot;The Black Stuff&quot;. The British Film Institute described it as a &quot;seminal drama series... a warm, humorous but ultimately tragic look at the way economics affect ordinary people… TV&#x27;s most complete dramatic response to the Thatcher era and as a lament to the end of a male, working class British culture.&quot;

== &quot;The Black Stuff&quot; ==
The television play The Black Stuff was originally written by Bleasdale and directed by Jim Goddard for BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Play for Today&quot; anthology series in 1978. After filming however, the play was not transmitted until 2 January 1980. It concerned a group of Liverpudlian tarmac layers (hence the title, &#x27;the black stuff&#x27; being a slang term for tarmac) on a job near Middlesbrough.

The acclaim that &quot;The Black Stuff&quot; received on its eventual transmission led to the commissioning of the sequel serial, of which Bleasdale had already written a considerable amount.

== &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot; ==
The series Boys from the Blackstuff follows the stories of the five now-unemployed men who lost their jobs following the events of the original play &quot;The Black Stuff&quot;. Set in Bleasdale&#x27;s home city of Liverpool, and reflecting many of his own experiences of life in the city, each episode focuses on a different member of the group. The series was highly acclaimed for its powerful and emotional depiction of the desperation wrought by high unemployment and a subsequent lack of social support. Although Bleasdale wrote most of the scripts before Margaret Thatcher came to power, the series was noted by many reviewers as a critique of the early Thatcher era, which was seen as being responsible for the fate of many of the unemployed working-class, particularly in the North of England. The show was launched at a time when unemployment had reached 3 million as a result of economic recession and restructuring of industry, having topped 1 million for most of the 1970s.

The character of Yosser Hughes was widely discussed. He was a man driven to the edge of his sanity by the loss of his job, his wife, the authorities&#x27; continued attempts to take his children away from him and his constant attempts at salvaging his male pride (often being the main give-away of his insecurity). His catchphrases, &quot;Gizza&#x27; job!&quot; (&quot;give us a job&quot;) and &quot;I can do that!&quot; became part of the popular consciousness of the 1980s, summing up the mood of many who sought desperately for work during the era. Hughes was played by Bernard Hill, who uses his Mancunian accent, with slight Scouse vocal mannerisms. The serial also helped to establish the career of Julie Walters, who played the most prominent female role as Angie, the wife of Chrissie, played by Michael Angelis.

The serial was made by the English regions drama department based at BBC Birmingham and was shot on location in Liverpool. The producer was Michael Wearing, who was based at Birmingham with a specific remit to make &quot;regional drama&quot;, and who would later be instrumental in bringing the BBC&#x27;s drama serials &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; (1985) and &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; (1996) to the screens. The writer Alan Bleasdale went on to write the scripts for &quot;The Monocled Mutineer&quot; (BBC1, 1986) and &quot;G.B.H.&quot; (Channel 4, 1991).

== Reception ==
The series was so successful upon its original broadcast that only nine weeks after it had finished transmission, it was re-shown on the higher-profile BBC1. It was also transmitted again on BBC2 as part of that station&#x27;s 25th anniversary season in 1989. In 1983 it won the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Serial, and in 2000 was placed seventh in a British Film Institute poll of industry professionals on the best television programmes of the 20th century. It was also named as one of the 40 greatest television shows in a 2003 list compiled by the &quot;Radio Times&quot; magazine&#x27;s chief television writer Alison Graham. In March 2007, Channel 4 broadcast a &quot;Top 50 Dramas&quot; programme, based on input from industry professionals rather than the public, which had &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot; at number two.

A live theatrical adaptation of the show, directed by James Graham, debuted in 2023.

== Episodes ==
===&quot;The Black Stuff&quot;===

The Black Stuff was the original television play directed by Jim Goddard and is the precursor to the 1982 &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot; series. The main characters Yosser, Loggo, Chrissie, George, Dixie and his son, Kevin, were introduced in it. It follows the group as they set off from Liverpool to undertake a casual tarmac laying job on a new housing development in Middlesbrough. The episode was produced in 1978 but was not broadcast until 1980.

Along the way at a motorway service station, the group encounter a female student (Janine Duvitski) who hitch-hikes a lift to Leeds. Part of the group (particularly Yosser) mocks her, but Yosser&#x27;s insecurity and unwillingness to be dominated by women is especially manifested after she taunts him when she is dropped off. In Middlesbrough the group are approached by two Irish gypsies, Brendan and Dominic, who offer them the chance of a side job, claiming that they had been laid off. Although initially uneasy with the idea of working with them, the group (except group leader, Dixie, and his son, Kevin), spurred by Yosser&#x27;s dream of fleecing the gypsies and starting their own tarmac laying business, agree to invest vast amounts of their own savings to undertake the &#x27;foreign&#x27; job. The group manager, McKenna, later discovers this and fires them all. However, despite being convinced that they had made the right decision, the group are nonetheless outsmarted by the gypsies who pretend they have been given a cheque (when in fact they had been paid cash) and claiming they would get the cheque cashed at a bank. Chrissie agrees to accompany Brendan in Brendan&#x27;s van (who later manages to lose Chrissie by tricking him into pushing the van so as to jump-start it after pretending it had broken down), while Yosser decides to hold Dominic hostage until they return. Yosser soon discovers that cash had in fact been handed over, but Dominic manages to escape to Brendan who is waiting for him – Loggo tripping and tumbling over as he gives chase through a farmer&#x27;s field.

Yosser speeds off in the group&#x27;s own van and gives chase to Brendan and Dominic, who attempts to puncture Yosser&#x27;s tyres by smashing empty milk bottles on the road from the back of the van. Yosser swerves and avoids them, but runs out of petrol, shouting and venting his anger by bashing his head on the steering wheel. He finds a can of petrol in the back of the van, partly refuels and sets off in vain to find the pair, before giving up on a roundabout, bringing traffic on it to a halt and breaking down in tears, ignoring the tailback and horns being blown behind him. He returns to the group after stopping by where he had abandoned a number of items from the van, headbutting a man he believes to be an Irish gypsy and kicking his companion to the ground, who protests he is neither a gypsy nor Irish and was &quot;just hitching a lift&quot;. Yosser is clearly distressed upon his return to the group and begins to smash the tarmac they had laid with a pickaxe, but is restrained by Loggo and Chrissie before knocking Chrissie to the ground for his optimistic outlook despite what has happened. Yosser launches an emotional monologue about wanting to be rich, noticed and seen, and is clearly close to breaking point, to the extent that Loggo and George continue to restrain him from further attacking Chrissie who is on the floor with a bleeding nose. George reassures Yosser and gently advises him to grow up, but Yosser is unconvinced and kicks the grille of the van. The episode ends with the group, almost penniless, arriving at the Tees Transporter Bridge. A man whom they met earlier (when he delivered tarmac to the site) is on his way to Shetland to undertake a casual job there, and Loggo promptly chooses to join him. The episode finishes with a long-distance shot of the Tees Transporter Bridge and the opening theme song, sung by the cast, is played over the end credits.

===&quot;Jobs for the Boys&quot;===
Featuring most of the characters from the initial drama. They take a cash-in-hand job on a building site whilst still claiming unemployment benefit. Typical of the show&#x27;s humour, it is later revealed that the building being renovated is going to be used by the Department of Employment. They are followed by the authorities and Snowy Malone (Chris Darwin), a plasterer, falls to his death trying to flee during a subsequent raid by the &quot;sniffers&quot; (social security officers working undercover).

===&quot;Moonlighter&quot;===
Follows Dixie Dean (Tom Georgeson) in his new position as a security guard, where he is strongarmed into accepting bribes for allowing the removal of goods under his charge in a docked ship. Apart from Dixie&#x27;s son Kevin this episode also features Chrissie, Loggo and George, the other members of the original gang, during a scene prior to Malone&#x27;s funeral.

===&quot;Shop Thy Neighbour&quot;===
Concentrates on Chrissie (Michael Angelis) and the domestic pressure that unemployment and the attentions of the benefit fraud officers place on him and his wife (Julie Walters). It also features his closest friend, Loggo (Alan Igbon), who is least affected by the social climate. At the end of the episode, in an act of desperation, lacking money and food, Chrissie is driven to strangle his chickens and shoot his geese in an attempt to provide dinner. He also worries about his children&#x27;s rabbits.

=== &quot;Yosser&#x27;s Story&quot; ===
This is the most widely discussed episode of the series, following Yosser&#x27;s struggle to avoid losing his children (who are played by Alan Bleasdale&#x27;s own children) to the authorities as his mental health disintegrates. It is also the only one of the series shot on 16mm film, as opposed to videotape, although the original play was also shot on this format. Footballers Graeme Souness and Sammy Lee, then of Liverpool F.C., make cameo appearances. The episode contains the often repeated scene in which Yosser goes to confession looking for help, and tells the priest he is desperate. The priest, trying to comfort Yosser, tells him &quot;Call me Dan – Dan&quot;; to which Yosser replies &quot;I&#x27;m desperate, Dan&quot;.

=== &quot;George&#x27;s Last Ride&quot; ===
This episode reveals something of George&#x27;s (Peter Kerrigan) politically active past. His trip (Chrissie wheeling him in his chair through the docks) leads him and them to reminisce about his younger days, the contrast between his recalled hopeful youth with the abandoned industrial infrastructure around him is marked. The death of George causes the main characters to be reunited if, in some cases, only briefly. The episode concludes with a surreal scene at the Green Man pub in Liverpool.

== DVD release ==
The series, including the original play &quot;The Black Stuff&quot; was released on DVD as a three-disc set by BBC Worldwide in 2003.

A companion to the series is the book &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff, the making of TV drama&quot;, by Bob Millington and Robin Nelson.

<doc id="851762" wikidata="Q4032856" url="?curid=851762" title="Volkswagen Group A platform">
<text>The Volkswagen Group A platform is an automobile platform shared among compact and mid-size cars of the Volkswagen Group.

The first version debuted in 1974 and was originally based on the engineering concept of the Volkswagen Golf Mk1, and is applicable to either front- or four-wheel drive vehicles, using only front-mounted transverse engines.

Volkswagens based on this platform have been colloquially referred to by generation number, e.g. the first Golf version (A1) is referred to as a Mark 1 Golf.&quot; Often each generation is designated by substituting &quot;Mark&quot; for &quot;A,&quot; but this can be misleading. For example, the Mk1 and Mk2 Scirocco are both based on the A1 platform. Furthermore, confusion was possible with the Volkswagen Passat, which has been produced on both the B platform alongside the Audi A4, as well as the A platform depending on the generation. Volkswagen has never used the Mark or Mk designations.

Volkswagen Group introduced a new alphanumeric nomenclature for vehicle platforms for the fourth generation. Under Volkswagen&#x27;s revised platform naming system, the &quot;A4&quot; platform became the PQ34 platform, and what would have been called the A5 platform was called the PQ35 platform. 

The platform code is composed as follows:

* A letter, P, indicating a &quot;passenger car&quot; platform
* A letter indicating the configuration of the engine:
** Q indicates a &quot;transverse engine&quot; (&quot;Quer&quot; in German)
* A digit indicating the platform &quot;size&quot; or &quot;class&quot;:
** 3 corresponds to compact cars
** 4 corresponds to mid-size cars
* A digit indicating the &quot;generation&quot; or &quot;evolution&quot;

The A platform has been superseded by the MQB platform for new models, with the exception of a few models only sold in certain markets.

==A1==
The A1 platform debuted on the Mk1 Golf on its launch in 1974, and continued into the early 1990s, when the last remaining models using the platform - the Scirocco, Cabriolet, and Caddy - were discontinued.

A1 platform cars (&quot;Typ&quot; numbers in brackets):
*Volkswagen Golf Mk1 (17)

==A2==
The A2 platform debuted in 1983 on the Mk2 Golf, and lasted until 1998, when the original SEAT Toledo (the first Volkswagen-developed SEAT following the Spanish company&#x27;s takeover by Volkswagen) was replaced.

The Volkswagen Passat B3 was based on a stretched A2 platform. The Volkswagen Corrado, while being an A2 platform car, uses some components from the A3 platform, notably the rear suspension assembly and some front suspension parts.

A2 platform cars (&quot;Typ&quot; numbers in brackets):
*Volkswagen Corrado (53I)
*Volkswagen Golf Mk2 (19E)
*Volkswagen Jetta II (1G)
*SEAT Toledo Mk1 (1L)
*Chery A11 and Chery A15
*Vortex Corda
*Volkswagen Jetta King
*Volkswagen Jetta Pioneer

==A3==
The A3 platform was only used for two models - the Mk3 Golf, launched in 1991, and its saloon equivalent, the Vento, launched in early 1992. 

A3 platform cars (&quot;Typ&quot; numbers in brackets):
*Volkswagen Golf Mk3 (1E)
*Volkswagen Vento/Jetta III (1H)

The smaller A03 platform, used in the Polo (6N) is based on the A3 platform as well, and shares many components. 

SEAT Ibiza (6K) and derived models, uses components of both A3 and A03 platforms.

==PQ34 (A4)==
The A4 platform (PQ34 under the revised scheme) debuted on the Audi A3 in 1996 and went on to be used for many different models over the next two decades.

PQ34 platform cars (&quot;Typ&quot; numbers in brackets):
*Audi A3 Mk1 (8L)
*Audi TT Mk1 (8N)
*Volkswagen Golf Mk4 (1J)
*Volkswagen Bora/Jetta (1J/9M)
*Volkswagen Lavida (18)
*Volkswagen New Beetle (1C/1Y/9C)
*SEAT León Mk1 (1M)
*SEAT Toledo Mk2 (1M)
*Škoda Octavia Mk1 (1U)
*Škoda Kamiq (chinese version)

==PQ35 (A5)/PQ46 (A6)==
The PQ35 platform was designed to be more modular than previous A platforms. For the first time, a fully independent suspension was used in the rear of all A platform vehicles. The PQ46 platform is a variant derived from this platform primarily intended for larger vehicles, such as mid-size cars and crossovers. A common misconception is that the PQ46 based sixth and seventh generations of the Passat, are based on the PL46 (B6) and B7 platforms. However, this transverse engine Passat has little in common with the longitudinal engine &quot;B6&quot; and &quot;B7&quot; Audi A4.

<doc id="851766" wikidata="Q6603638" url="?curid=851766" title="List of Volkswagen Group platforms">
<text>The German automotive concern, Volkswagen Group has, since the 1970s, developed a series of shared automobile platforms for their motor vehicles.

Originally, these were identified using a simple alphanumeric system. The first letter prefix indicates the car classification or physical size (A, B, C or D - for &#x27;traditional&#x27; cars); followed by a number to enumerate different generations of the same class. However, more recent platforms have formally departed from this convention, although the older alphanumeric codes continue to be used informally.

These platforms may be used by one or more marques of the Group.

==Platform codes==

===Original system===
Note that some designations in common use are ambiguous; i.e. in some cases the same platform designation is used for different models that do &quot;not&quot; share a common platform. An example would be the &quot;B6&quot; designation - this is used to identify the 2001-2005 Audi A4 (and the related Audi S4), which uses a longitudinal engine and transmission placement with a pressed steel front subframe; however it is also used to identify the sixth-generation Volkswagen Passat, but this uses a transverse engine and transmission placement with a very different cast aluminium alloy front subframe.

===Joint-venture platforms===
Platforms developed by Volkswagen Group as joint ventures with other manufacturers have designations which do not conform to the above scheme. These include:

===PL/PQ platforms===
Volkswagen Group has previously introduced an alphanumeric nomenclature for car platforms. The platform code is composed as follows:

* A letter, P, indicating a &quot;passenger car&quot; platform
* A letter indicating the configuration of the engine:
** Q indicates a &quot;transverse engine&quot; (&quot;Quer&quot; in German)
** L indicates a &quot;longitudinal engine&quot; (&quot;Längs&quot; in German)
* A digit indicating the platform &quot;size&quot; or &quot;class&quot;
* A digit indicating the &quot;generation&quot; or &quot;evolution&quot;

An additional + suffix indicates a long-wheelbase variant.

==Modular component systems==
In 2007, Volkswagen Group introduced a more flexible &quot;modular component system&quot; architecture on which to base future platforms. Four such component systems were planned: However, models developed from these modular component systems may also be identified by PL/PQ platform designations.

*MQB: &quot;Modularer Querbaukasten&quot;, or &quot;modular transverse component system&quot;, highly scalable platform for vehicles with a transverse-mounted combustion engine and front-wheel or all-wheel drive, developed by Volkswagen.
*MLB: &quot;Modularer Längsbaukasten&quot;, or &quot;modular longitudinal component system&quot;, predecessor of the PPC for vehicles with a longitudinally installed combustion engine and front or all-wheel drive in the mid and luxury class, developed by Audi.
*PPC: &quot;Premium Platform Combustion&quot;, successor to the MLB for vehicles with a longitudinally installed hybridised combustion engine and front or all-wheel drive in the mid and luxury class, developed by Audi.
*MSB: &quot;Modularer Standardantriebsbaukasten&quot;, or &quot;modular standard drive train system&quot;, for vehicles with longitudinally mounted front engine and rear-wheel or all-wheel drive, developed by Porsche.
*MMB: &quot;Modularer Mittelbaukasten&quot;, for mid-engined or rear-engined sports cars. Currently used by the Porsche 992 911 and the Porsche 982 718.
*MSS: &quot;Modulare Aufhängungslösung&quot;, or &quot;Modular Sports System&quot;, used for the Audi R8 and the Lamborghini Huracán.
*MNB: &quot;Modulare Nutzfahrzeugbaukasten&quot;, for light commercial vehicles (VW Crafter/MAN TGE).

==Software platforms==
*GENIVI Linux
*Bosch Software Components
*MIB - Modular Infotainment Platform
**MIB 2
**MIB 3 - BlackBerry QNX
*E³ 1.1 (End-to-End 1.1)
**Volkswagen Automotive Cloud
*Platform 1.2
*E³ 2.0 architecture
**Unified Platform 2.0

== Electric car platforms ==
*J1: &quot;J1 Platform&quot; underpins the Porsche Taycan and Audi e-tron GT. It is derived from the MSB platform.
*MEB: &quot;Modularer Elektrobaukasten&quot; is an electric car platform developed by Volkswagen Group.
*PPE: &quot;Premium Platform Electric&quot; for larger electric car models co-developed by Audi and Porsche.
*SSP: &quot;Scalable Systems Platform&quot; is planned to be introduced in 2029.

==Other==
The first generation of the Volkswagen Amarok (2H) is based on a specially developed chassis, while the second generation (NF) is based on and utilises the T6.2 platform in cooperation with Ford and shares many of the same parts as the second-generation Ford Ranger (P703/RA).

<text>Macquarie Centre is a shopping centre in the suburb of Macquarie Park in the Northern Sydney region of Sydney and is located opposite the main campus of Macquarie University.

==History==
=== 20th Century ===
==== 1960s: purchase of land ====
In 1968, Grace Bros purchased 16 acres of land in North Ryde with plans to build a $12 million shopping centre. Rival department store David Jones had shown interest in the area and developed plans with Hooker Investment Corporation to build their own shopping centre known as Garden City on Epping Road, Macquarie Park on what was industrial land. David Jones had difficulty seeking approval, with the plans rejected by Ryde Municipal Council, and they were forced to lodge their plans with the State Planning Authority. Garden City was designed by Donald Crone, one of the leading architects who had designed the Sydney Tower. The plans included 80 speciality stores, an office tower and a distribution centre which would replace the one at Alexandria. The initial development application made by Grace Bros was not approved by council and instead lodged with SPA which was later rejected. Grace Bros, unturned, submitted a further appeal with the support of three town planners.

In 1969, Grace Bros purchased further land and by November 1969, the State Government approved the Grace Bros proposal while David Jones proposal on zoning grounds was rejected.

Throughout the 1970s, Grace Bros barely opened a store with the Macquarie store set to be its first full-line store in over a decade. Work began in March 1979 on the site adjoining the university when AMP agreed to become the majority shareholder and provide greater share of the finance for the $80 million shopping centre.

Throughout the construction period, the centre had faced industrial disputes with the Industrial Commission awarding $24 over their awards in November 1979 as major site allowance. After further problems arose, workers were offered $1,000 in shopping vouchers depending on their qualification level. Further disputes continued with the demand for an additional $40 a week increase which was rejected and by July 1981, only a third of the required workforce were on the job.

==== 1980s: opening ====
Macquarie Centre had originally planned to open in Easter 1981, however it was delayed to September and then delayed again to November. The delays had a devastating impact on small retailers who had stocked up for opening deadlines.

Macquarie Centre officially opened on 17 November 1981 by the Premier of New South Wales, Neville Wran. The centre featured an Olympic sized ice rink, Grace Bros (rebranded to Myer in 2004), Big W, Target, Woolworths and 130 speciality stores. Macquarie Centre was the third centre in Sydney to facilitate an &quot;incline mall&quot; design (after Westfield Burwood and Westfield Hurstville) and was built on a spiral staircase around the sundial water fountain. This meant that it is a gently-ascending grade and that the levels were connected via a system of ramps, stairs and escalators.

Franklins Fresh was added to the centre in 1992 and was renamed to Franklins in 2001 and operated until its closure in 2012. The middle of the centre included a spiral atrium with interconnecting stairways called the &quot;Rain Forest&quot;. In 1997, this area underwent a refurbishment, redoing the layout entirely and adding a sundial clock fountain, which was removed in 2015.

Macquarie Ice Rink is home to Sydney Bears and Sydney Ice Dogs ice hockey teams. The ice rink is used for ice skating, ice dance, speed skating and ice hockey. Macquarie Centre is the only shopping centre in Sydney to provide a full size Olympic rink (60m x 30m) with seating for approximately 2,000 people. Macquarie Ice Rink was used for the 1991 World short track speed skating Championships.

There were plans for a cinema complex to open in the centre in 1981, however these plans had fallen through. It was not until September 1994 when the eight screen Greater Union multiplex and leisure precinct opened on the rooftop level.

=== 21st Century ===
In 2000, the &#x27;Escape&#x27; and &#x27;Loft&#x27; areas were opened, which included a major facelift in 1999 to the centre&#x27;s entrances, extra parking and new retail stores. These included Borders (second store in Australia), BaySwiss, Dick Smith Powerhouse, Freedom and Wheel &amp; Barrow. The Loft was designed as a home wares precinct. This development also included new food outlets and an expansion of the Greater Union cinema complex, from 8 to 16 cinemas. Greater Union was renamed to Event Cinemas in 2009.

In 2010, Fitness First opened on the space vacated by Freedom and JB Hi-Fi moved from the location on level 2 to the space vacated by Borders on level 4.

AMP Wholesale Shopping Centre Fund No. 2 wholly owns the centre after an ownership agreement was reached with former co-owner Westfield in 2012. In October 2021, Cbus and UniSuper each purchased a 25% shareholding.

==== 2010s – 2020s: Recent development ====
In late 2012, AMP Capital Shopping Centres began work on the $440 million redevelopment. Stage 1 of the redevelopment was completed on 17 July 2014 with the opening of Coles, Aldi and the fresh food market. Stage 2 of the redevelopment was completed in October 2014, adding an entire new wing to the existing centre.

Stage 2 consisted of: 
* A full line David Jones
* A new 2 level mall linking the new David Jones with the existing centre and Myer
* Approximately 130 new retail stores (including Sydney&#x27;s first H&amp;M, Zara, Uniqlo and Sephora)
* Additional 1,050 car spaces
As a result, Macquarie Centre is now the largest Sydney suburban shopping centre. It is expected to reach $6 billion in spending by 2021, and can support trade for 337,770 people.

=== Future ===
Plans for the $1 billion redevelopment which included towers have been given approval. The plans would include 1,000 new apartments in four tower blocks, 5,000m² of dedicated community space, including a library and public creative hub. The towers will range in height from 26 to 33 storeys, and adding another 2,175 car parking spaces. A new station plaza between Macquarie University station and the centre is also part of the plan. The development will unfold in stages over several years and future applications will be developed. This mixed use development has been approved on 15 November 2016.

As part of Stage 2 planning being approved, it was announced on 16 January 2019 that Macquarie Ice Rink would close on 31 January 2020 for demolition to make way for the new retail and residential towers.

In February 2019, AMP Capital Shopping Centres announced it had decided to preserve the ice rink. This was largely due to the large public outcry regarding the removal of the iconic rink.

==Tenants==
Macquarie Centre has 134,900m² of floor space. The major retailers include David Jones, Myer, Big W, Kmart, Aldi, Coles, Woolworths, Cotton On, H&amp;M, Uniqlo, Zara, JB Hi-Fi, Rebel, Fitness First, Timezone, Strike Bowling Bar, Macquarie Ice Rink and Event Cinemas.

==Transport==
Macquarie University station is adjacent to Macquarie Centre with Metro North West &amp; Bankstown Line trains running from Tallawong to Sydenham.

Macquarie Centre has bus connections to the Sydney CBD, North Shore, Northern Sydney and Greater Western Sydney, as well as local surrounding suburbs. It is served by Busways, CDC NSW and Transit Systems. The majority of its bus services are located in Herring Road in front of the shopping centre&#x27;s main entrance.

Macquarie Centre has multi level car parks with 4,900 spaces.

==Incidents==
* On 5 June 2007, a 40-year-old woman was stabbed and a man had self-inflicted knife wounds after a domestic incident at the centre carpark. The man was later arrested after he allegedly drove at a police officer and crashed into a parked car as he attempted to leave the scene.
* Between February and June 2017, 16 vehicles, including luxury cars, had an acid-like substance poured on them. The attack was believed to be racially motivated and a man has been charged.
* On 3 July 2017, a police officer was kicked in the face by a group of youths causing him to fall and hit his head. Police were called to the scene after 10pm after a group of youths assaulted two security guards nearby. The 16 year old youth was later charged.
* On 16 April 2018, a 13-year-old boy was bitten in the cheek during an attempted robbery at the centre at around 11:40 am. He was walking with a friend when they were approached by two men, who threatened the boy and tried to steal his sneakers.
* On 17 May 2018, a brawl erupted in the ice rink which involved the chairman of CBR Brave, who started arguing with players from Sydney Bears. The chairman poured beer down on one of the players before a member of the crowd threw a bin at him, sparking an all-in shoving match between the fans.

<doc id="851775" wikidata="Q766777" url="?curid=851775" title="Relish">
<text>A relish (a pickle-based condiment) is a cooked and pickled culinary dish made of chopped vegetables, fruits or herbs, typically used as a condiment to enhance a staple. Examples are chutneys and the North American relish, a pickled cucumber jam eaten with hot dogs. In North America, the word &quot;relish&quot; is frequently used to describe a single variety of finely chopped pickled cucumber relish, such as pickle, dill and sweet relishes.

Relish generally consists of discernible vegetable or fruit pieces in a sauce, although the sauce is subordinate in character to the vegetable or fruit pieces. Herbs may also be used, and some relishes, such as chermoula, are prepared entirely using herbs and spices. Relish can consist of a single type or a combination of vegetables and fruit, which may be coarsely or finely chopped; its texture will vary depending on the slicing style used for these solid ingredients, but generally a relish is not as smooth as a sauce-type condiment such as ketchup. Relish typically has a strong flavor that complements or adds to the primary food item with which it is served.

In the United States, the most common commercially available relishes are made from pickled cucumbers and are known in the food trade as pickle relishes. Pickle relish is one of the most commonly used spreads in the U.S. Two variants of this are hamburger relish (pickle relish in a tomato base or sauce) and hot dog relish (pickle relish in a mustard base or sauce). Another readily available commercial relish in the U.S. is corn (maize) relish. Heinz, Vlasic, and Claussen are well known in the U.S. as producers of pickled cucumbers and pickle relishes. Chicago-style relish is a sweet pickle relish that is a standard ingredient on the Chicago-style hot dog. Pickle relish is an important ingredient in many varieties of the U.S. version of tartar sauce.

<text>Piccalilli, or mustard pickle, is a British interpretation of South Asian pickles, a relish of chopped and pickled vegetables and spices. Regional recipes vary considerably.

==Etymology==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; traces the word to the middle of the 18th century when, in 1758, Hannah Glasse described how &quot;to make Paco-Lilla, or India Pickle&quot;. An apparently earlier reference is in Anne Blencowe&#x27;s &quot;Receipt Book&quot;, written , which has &quot;To Pickle Lila, an Indian Pickle&quot; credited to Lord Kilmory.

The more familiar form of the word appears in 1769, in Elizabeth Raffald&#x27;s &quot;The Experienced English Housekeeper&quot;, as &quot;To make Indian pickle, or Piccalillo&quot;. Richard Briggs, in his 1788 &quot;The English Art of Cookery&quot;, similarly calls it &quot;Picca Lillo&quot;. The spelling &quot;piccalilli&quot; can be seen in an advertisement in a 1799 edition of &quot;The Times&quot;.

==British piccalilli==

British&lt;ref name=&quot;british-history/piccalilli-pickling&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; piccalilli regularly contains the common vegetables cauliflower, onion, shallot, runner bean, carrot, courgette and gherkin, with the seasonings flour, vinegar, ginger, garlic, coriander, mustard powder and turmeric.&lt;ref name=&quot;kilnerjar/piccalilli&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;deliciousmagazine/piccalilli&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;goodhousekeeping/piccalilli&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;paulcouchman/piccalilli-regency&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian/pickle-recipes&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Available from major British supermarkets, more finely chopped, is &quot;sandwich piccalilli&quot;. It is used as an accompaniment to foods such as sausages, bacon, eggs, toast, cheese, and tomatoes. It is eaten as a relish with cold meats such as ham and brawn, and with a ploughman&#x27;s lunch. 

It is usually made in the autumn, when pickling onions become available. As well as being a commercial product, piccalilli is a mainstay of Women&#x27;s Institute and farmhouse product stalls.

==Cypriot piccalilli==

An unsweetened variation of British piccalilli is found in Cyprus (including northern Cyprus). It is without baby onions, with a milder mustard sauce, and with the addition of carrot pieces. Piccalilli is known in Cyprus as &quot;πίκλα&quot; (&quot;pikla&quot;) in Cypriot Greek, and &quot;bikla&quot; in Cypriot Turkish. It is served as a condiment, and occasionally as a meze dish.

==American piccalilli==

In the Northeastern United States, commercial piccalillis are made with a base of sweet peppers or green tomatoes. This style is somewhat similar to sweet pepper relish, with the piccalilli being distinguished by having a darker red or green color and, like British piccalilli, the chunks are larger and it is slightly sweeter. It is commonly used as a topping on such foods as hamburgers and hot dogs. British-style, yellow, piccalilli is also available.

In the Midwestern United States, commercial piccalillis are based on finely chopped gherkins. Bright green and on the sweet side, they are often used as a condiment for Chicago-style hot dogs. This style is sometimes called &quot;neon relish&quot;.
In the Southern United States, piccalilli is not commonly served. In its place, chow-chow, a relish with a base of chopped green (unripe) tomatoes, is offered. This relish may also include onions, bell peppers, cabbage, green beans, and other vegetables. While not similar to other piccalillis, chow-chow is often called as such and the terms may be used interchangeably.

In the Western United States, piccalilli is uncommon.

==Surinamese piccalilli==

A far spicier variant of piccalilli comes from the former Dutch colony of Suriname, where traditional British piccalilli is mixed with a sambal made of garlic and yellow Madame Jeanette peppers. This piccalilli is often homemade but can also be bought in jars in Dutch corner shops. Whilst Surinamese piccalilli is similar in appearance to ordinary piccalilli, the taste is much spicier.

==Media references==

As a term for a mixed collection, piccalilli lends its name to several books of poems, for example, &quot;Piccalilli: A Mixture&quot;, by Gilbert Percy (1862), and &quot;Dilly Dilly Piccalilli: Poems for the Very Young&quot; (1989), by Myra Cohn Livingston. Mr Piccalilli is the name of a character in the children&#x27;s book &quot;Mr Pod and Mr Piccalilli&quot; (2005), by Penny Dolan.

The song &quot;Lily the Pink&quot;, recorded in 1968 by UK comedy group The Scaffold, includes a humorous reference to piccalilli when describing Lily&#x27;s eventual demise, in the lyric &quot;...and despite her medicinal compound, sadly Picca-Lily died&quot;. The song was based on an earlier folk song &quot;the Ballad of Lydia Pinkham&quot;, which celebrated a herbal remedy invented by the eponymous heroine, marketed from 1876 as &quot;Lydia E. Pinkham&#x27;s Vegetable Compound&quot;. The connection between piccalilli and the vegetable compound is in name only, as the recipes differ completely.

<text>King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) is a nonprofit research university in Dhahran, Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. 

Founded near the earliest local oil fields as the College of Petroleum &amp; Minerals (1963) in response to the booming energy industry of Saudi Arabia, the University centers mainly around science, engineering, and management in order to advance the Kingdom’s petroleum and mineral industries. The university ranks 2nd and 8th globally in petroleum and mineral &amp; mining engineering according to the QS subject rankings, respectively. As of 2024, the university has been ranked 4th globally by the National Academy of Inventors (NAI), first globally in the Student Unmanned Aerial Systems Ranking (SUAS), and first in the Middle East &amp; North Africa (MENA) region according to the QS Ranking.

==History==
KFUPM is a premier university in Saudi Arabia, the Middle East, and North Africa regions. KFUPM was established on September 23, 1963, by a Saudi royal decree as the College of Petroleum and Minerals, to provide high-level education in the academic fields of petroleum and minerals, two of the most valuable natural resources in Saudi Arabia.

The first students were admitted on September 23, 1964, when 67 young men enrolled in what was then named the College of Petroleum and Minerals (CPM). The original campus was designed by CRS Design Associates, architects and engineers of Houston, Texas. The college was elevated to university status in 1975 when it expanded its academic offerings in science, engineering, technology, business, and management. In 1984 the Program of Industrial and Systems Engineering was first introduced. The university was renamed after King Fahd in 1986. Since that time, enrollment has grown to over 10,000 students by the 2021 academic year and has graduated more than 39,000 students since its inception.

In 2019 the university put in place a transformation plan whose primary goal was to support the transformation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from a natural resource monetizing economy primarily focused on oil and gas resources, into a diversified knowledge economy.

Part of this transformation plan presents an important milestone in the history of the university with the inclusion of female students in the engineering and technical academic programs. In 2019 male and female students were equally accepted into new postgraduate programs for the first time in the history of the university, and in 2021 admissions started for female students at the undergraduate level on a merit basis. The university hopes this step will help create diversity throughout engineering fields, and other sectors in the Kingdom. 

==Academics==
===Academic programs===
KFUPM degree offerings include Bachelor of Science, Master of Science, Master of Engineering, Master of Business Administration, and Doctor of Philosophy.

The university&#x27;s academic programs are focused on engineering, sciences, computer sciences, business, and management, and are accredited by international bodies such as ABET, AACSB, as well as the national accrediting body NCAAA.

Since 2020, the university has introduced new aspects to the academic programs through undergraduate concentrations (CX) and professional masters (MX). Recently there were 38 undergraduate concentrations (CX) introduced, along with 32 one-year master&#x27;s degrees, and 20 interdisciplinary research centers.

===Innovative learning===

The 35 undergraduate degrees were revised to include the study of modern programming languages, data science, big data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, business, and entrepreneurship. Every discipline starts with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and then branches into more specific fields.

Additionally, KFUPM has launched an effort to migrate some of its courses into other instructional methods, such as inquiry-based learning (IBL), where research on the topics is encouraged to enhance the class time with discussions, debates, and questions and answers. 

KFUPM&#x27;s 38 undergraduate concentrations (CX) allow students to add a concentration in an area beyond their major. A few examples of these concentrations are Hydrogen Mobility, Renewable Energy and Energy Storage, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Business Analytics, Robotics and Autonomous Systems.

KFUPM offers 32 one-year professional master&#x27;s degrees (MX) in several fields such as Artificial Intelligence, Supply Chain Management, Quantum Computing, Smart and Sustainable Cities.

===Admissions===
KFUPM is a merit-based admissions academic institution. With an acceptance rate of 4% (2023), it is considered to be one of the most coveted universities in Saudi Arabia, recruiting roughly the top 2% of the national talent based on admission criteria that include performance on the nationwide aptitude tests to ensure the acceptance of the most promising students.

The university has accelerated the admission process of female students since 2019 as both male and female students were equally accepted into the new master&#x27;s degree programs for the first time in the university&#x27;s history. Starting from 2021, KFUPM is opening admissions for female students at the undergraduate level for the 2021/2022 academic year, marking an important milestone in the university&#x27;s history since until then it was an institution exclusively open to male students.

KFUPM is improving the quality of the student intake by attracting the most outstanding high school graduates by introducing an early admissions system and accepting winners in international scientific Olympiad competitions. The progression of students in the first year has been accelerated by developing programs to bypass the preparatory year (SkipPrep).

=== Rankings ===
KFUPM was named the top university in the Arab Region as per the QS University Rankings for 2015 and 2016. In 2022 it was ranked the third university in the region.

Since the KFUPM transformation phase started in 2019, the university&#x27;s rankings have seen a steady rise. According to the QS World University Rankings, KFUPM is placed among the top 200 universities in the world at the 163rd position.

===Accreditation===
All programs of the engineering colleges were evaluated for &quot;Substantial-Equivalency&quot; recognition by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). They were found substantially equivalent to similar accredited programs in the United States. All Business &amp; Management related programs offered by KFUPM Business School (including its flagship Master of Business Administration) are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). KFUPM is a member of AACSB since 1975 and it is among the first few schools outside the US to get this prestigious recognition. KFUPM is also accredited by the national accrediting body NCAAA.

==Organization==
===Colleges===
KFUPM undergraduate and graduate programs are divided into seven colleges. As part of the university&#x27;s recent transformational initiatives, all colleges recently underwent a complete restructuring to encourage collaboration among disciplines, and encourage cross-discipline research.
*College of Engineering and Physics
*College of Computing and Mathematics
*College of Petroleum Engineering and Geosciences
*College of Chemicals and Materials
*College of Design and Built Environment
*KFUPM Business School
*College of General Studies

In addition, Dammam Community College is under the auspices of King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals as a fully approved academic entity by the Minister of Higher Education.

==Leadership==
The current president of KFUPM is Muhammad M. Al-Saggaf.

<text>Erik Spiekermann (born 30 May 1947) is a German typographer, designer and writer. He is an honorary professor at the University of the Arts Bremen and ArtCenter College of Design.

==Biography==
Spiekermann studied art history at Berlin&#x27;s Free University, funding himself by running a letterpress printing press in the basement of his house.

Between 1972 and 1979, he worked as a freelance graphic designer in London before returning to Berlin and founding MetaDesign with two partners.

In 1989, he and his then-wife Joan Spiekermann started FontShop, the first mail-order distributor for digital fonts. FontShop International followed and now publishes the &quot;FontFont&quot; range of typefaces. MetaDesign combined clean, teutonic-looking information design and complex corporate design systems for clients like BVG (Berlin Transit), Düsseldorf Airport, Audi, Volkswagen and Heidelberg Printing, amongst others.

In 2001, Spiekermann left MetaDesign over policy disagreements and started United Designers Network, with offices in Berlin, London, and San Francisco.

In April 2006, the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena awarded Spiekermann an Honorary Doctorship for his contribution to design. His family of typefaces for Deutsche Bahn (German Railways), designed with Christian Schwartz, received a Gold Medal at the German Federal Design Prize in 2006, the highest such award in Germany. In May 2007, he was the first designer to be elected into the European Design Awards Hall of Fame.

In January 2007, UDN was renamed SpiekermannPartners. In January 2009, SpiekermannPartners merged with Dutch design agency Eden Design &amp; Communication and continued its operations under the name Edenspiekermann . Edenspiekermann currently run offices in Amsterdam, Berlin, San Francisco and Los Angeles.
He now runs an experimental letterpress workshop in Berlin, Hacking Gutenberg (www.hackinggutenberg.berlin)

Spiekermann is considered a very influential personality in the field of typeface design and information design. He often attends international meetings, and has been giving a substantial contribution in several fields, such as app development and public wayfinding.

<text>In Arthurian legend, the Siege Perilous (, also known as The Perilous Seat, ) is a vacant seat at the Round Table reserved by Merlin for the knight who would one day be successful in the quest for the Holy Grail.

== History ==

The English word &quot;siege&quot; originally meant &quot;seat&quot; or &quot;throne&quot; coming from the Old French (modern French ); the modern military sense of a prolonged assault comes from the conception of an army &quot;sitting down&quot; before a fortress.

In Thomas Malory&#x27;s 1485 book &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, in an account taken from the Vulgate Cycle &quot;Queste del Saint Graal&quot;, the newly knighted Sir Galahad takes the seat in Camelot on Whitsunday, 454 years after the death of Jesus. The Siege Perilous is strictly reserved and therefore is fatal to anyone unworthy who sits in it. Another version of this story is related in Alfred Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;.

Originally, this motif about the seat and the grail belonged to Perceval, but the Lancelot-Grail Cycle transferred it to the new Cistercian-based hero Galahad. It appears, for example, in the earlier &quot;Perceval de Didot&quot; attributed to Robert de Boron, in which Perceval occupies the seat at Arthur&#x27;s court at Carduel. According to many scholars, the motif of the dangerous seat can be further traced to Welsh, Cornish, and Breton mythology, from which the bulk of the Arthurian legend was derived. According to this theory, the Siege Perilous was a half-remembered version of a Celtic kingship ritual that has parallels in the Irish Lia Fáil.

<text>Air America is a 1990 American action comedy film directed by Roger Spottiswoode and starring Mel Gibson and Robert Downey Jr. as Air America pilots flying missions in Laos during the Vietnam War. When the protagonists discover their aircraft is being used by government agents to smuggle heroin, they must avoid being framed as the drug-smugglers.

The plot of the film is adapted from Christopher Robbins&#x27; 1979 non-fiction book, chronicling the CIA-financed airline to transport weapons and supplies in Cambodia, Laos and South Vietnam during the Vietnam War.

The publicity for the film, advertised as a lighthearted buddy movie, implied a tone that differs greatly from the actual film, which includes such serious themes as an anti-war message, focus on the opium trade, and a negative portrayal of Royal Laotian General Vang Pao (played by actor Burt Kwouk as &quot;General Lu Soong&quot;).

==Plot==
In late 1969, helicopter pilot Billy Covington has his pilot&#x27;s license suspended for breaking safety regulations. His skills, bravery and disregard for the law are noticed by a government agent, who offers him a job in Laos working for the &quot;strictly civilian&quot; company Air America, which turns out to be a front for CIA operations.

In Laos, he is introduced to Air America&#x27;s unorthodox pilots and aircraft, being taken under the wing of pilot Gene Ryack, who uses official flights to buy black market weapons for his private cache. His retirement plan is to make enough money to afford quitting his Air America job.

Senator Davenport arrives to investigate rumors that Air America is transporting drugs for Laotian forces. Major Lemond and Rob Diehl, CIA leaders of Air America, show the Senator around Laos to prevent him discovering that the rumors are true. Unfortunately, Davenport loses great respect from General Soong during their first meeting at the airport when mistaking him to be a local luggage-carrying valet. Soong holds this over Davenport&#x27;s head for the remainder of his visit.

While airdropping livestock in their C-123 cargo aircraft, Billy and Jack Neely are shot down, but Billy manages to crash-land the C-123 at a former World War II Japanese airstrip. The Pilatus PC-6 of General Soong arrives at the crash site and his soldiers load up with the opium from the crashed plane, but intentionally leave Billy and Jack behind while local Communist forces are moving in. Gene and another pilot rescue them; Billy boards Gene&#x27;s helicopter.

Billy and Gene are shot down after a short time in the air and captured by a tribe. Gene strikes a deal to supply them with better weapons. At Gene&#x27;s house, Billy is surprised to discover that Gene has a wife and children. Disillusioned with U.S. actions in Laos, Gene convinces Billy to quit his job, but Billy wants to get even with General Soong.

Davenport is losing patience and demands to know who is smuggling heroin. Learning that Jack has been killed, Lemond and Diehl claim he was the ring leader behind the drug trafficking. Billy blows up the heroin factory, but guards see him running away. Davenport demands more concrete evidence.

Gene finds a buyer for his arsenal, allowing him to quit Air America and take his family out of Laos. Billy accepts one more flight, taking flour to a refugee camp when he is instructed to divert for &quot;routine inspection.&quot; Suspecting a setup, Billy inspects the cargo and finds heroin. He crash-lands on the same airstrip where he crashed earlier and uses the wreckage of the previous crash to hide the aircraft.

Davenport recognizes the nature of the setup and threatens to reveal Lemond and Diehl&#x27;s operation to Washington. Major Lemond in return silences Senator Davenport by daring him to say what he thinks he saw in Laos but reveals that his own political connections involving a friendship with the President would only ruin Davenport&#x27;s political career.

Gene, on his way to make his final weapons delivery, rescues Billy. They respond to a distress call from a refugee camp caught in crossfire. The official in charge of the camp refuses to leave without the refugees. Gene reluctantly dumps the weapons to make room for the refugees, with much pressure from Billy, and blows up their cache to cover the escape.

In the air, Gene and Billy hatch a scheme to sell the aircraft to recoup Gene&#x27;s money. In the postscript of the closing credits, it is revealed that General Soong makes it to America eventually and gets his dream of owning and operating a Holiday Inn, that Gene wins a lottery in Thailand in 1975, and that Billy is deported from Thailand for fixing the same lottery in order for Gene to win.

==Production==

===Development===
Director Richard Rush tried to develop the film in 1985, as the first comedy about Vietnam. Carolco Pictures bought the project as Rush wrote a script and found locations. Sean Connery was attached to play the older pilot, Gene Ryack, and the younger flier Billy Covington was at different times to be played by Bill Murray, James Belushi and Kevin Costner. The project was sold to producer Daniel Melnick after Connery and Costner became too expensive. Melnick hired screenwriter John Eskow to write a new script; and first hired director Bob Rafelson to work with Rush, but eventually hiring director Roger Spottiswoode. Mel Gibson was cast for a reported $7 million, for the role of Ryack, and Robert Downey Jr. took on the role of Covington. Nancy Travis was cast as Corinne Landroaux, replacing Ally Sheedy, and Michael Dudikoff was cast as General Lee.

===Filming===
The budget of &quot;Air America&quot; increased to $35 million as the production involved a 500-member crew shooting in 49 different locations between Thailand, London, and Los Angeles; operating between eight and fifteen cameras at a time. Principal photography began on October 3, 1989, and continued until February 10, 1990. The production was plagued by two earthquakes and a typhoon. The producers rented 26 aircraft from the Thai military, although some of the stunt flyers refused to perform some of the stunts, with 60-year-old veterans being drafted for the more demanding turns. PepsiCo wanted the filmmakers to use a fictional soda rather than show opium being refined at their abandoned factory. Therefore, the producers added a line about wondering if Pepsi knew what was going on. After previewing the film, six months after production, Gibson and other principals were called back to film a new ending.

==Soundtrack==

==Reception==
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 13% based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 3.4/10. Metacritic reports a weighted average score of 33 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Upon its release, &quot;Air America&quot; was embroiled in controversy over its treatment of the &quot;secret CIA airline service.&quot; After the Persian Gulf War began on January 15, 1991, the film was withdrawn from distribution in over 100 cinemas throughout Germany. &quot;Air America&quot; received mostly negative reviews from critics. The film review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; by Caryn James, saw the film as a flawed &quot;star vehicle&quot;. &quot;This muddled film about a secret C.I.A. project in Laos in 1969 fails on every possible level: as action film, as buddy film, as scenic travelogue and even, sad to say, as a way to flaunt Mel Gibson&#x27;s appeal.&quot; Film historian Alun Evans in &quot;Brassey&#x27;s Guide to War Films&quot;, in his commentary, was brief but pointed in characterizing &quot;Air America&quot; as a &quot;... tawdry, unfunny war comedy.&quot;

Some criticism was levelled at the inaccuracies prevalent in the production. The review of &quot;Air America&quot; in the &quot;St. Paul Pioneer Press&quot; noted: &quot;... the comedy adventure doesn&#x27;t feature any real heroes of that war, men like the Hmong pilot Lee Lue.&quot; Christopher Robbins said the movie distorted his book&#x27;s presentation of the Air America story, and historian William Leary noted &quot;The exploits of CAT/Air America form a unique chapter in the history of air transport, one that deserves better than a misleading, mediocre movie.&quot;

British film critic Andy Webb opined that &quot;Air America&quot; worked as an aviation film. &quot;... on a small positive some of the flying stunts, and there are plenty of them, are pretty spectacular. In a movie which almost floats these moments of aeronautic acrobats (they) give an injection of adrenalin although by no means enough to save it.&quot;

Alexander Cockburn wrote in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that &quot;Air America&quot; received abuse for &quot;dar[ing] to say the unsayable, and commits the added offense of joking about it ... It injects into mass culture truth on a matter that official America has been lying about for three decades, namely the confluence between U.S. covert operations and criminality, whether in Laos, Afghanistan or Central America&quot;.

===Box office===
&quot;Air America&quot; debuted at number three behind &quot;Flatliners&quot; and &quot;Young Guns II&quot;. The film ended up grossing $31,053,601 in the US and $3,243,404 in other countries for a worldwide total of $36,297,005.

<text>Samuel Botsford Buckley (May 9, 1809 – February 18, 1884) was an American botanist, geologist, and naturalist.

Buckley was born in Torrey, New York, on May 9, 1809. He graduated from Wesleyan University in 1836. He received a Ph.D. from Waco University in 1872.

Buckley investigated the botany of the southern United States and discovered many new species of plants and mollusks. The plant genus &quot;Buckleya&quot; was named in his honor. 

Buckley determined the height of several summits in the Great Smoky Mountains, including Mount Buckley which was named in his honor. 

Buckley served as an assistant to Texas chief geologist Benjamin Franklin Shumard. He named an oak species after Shumard in 1860, but then stymied Shumard&#x27;s reappointment under newly-elected Governor Sam Houston. 

Buckley was the Texas state geologist from 1860 to 1861 and 1874 to 1877. He was the scientific editor of the &quot;State Gazette&quot; in Austin, Texas from 1871 to 1872. He wrote numerous scientific papers as well as a book on the trees and shrubs of the United States.

Buckley died in Austin on February 18, 1884.

<text>Satara () (ISO: Sātārā) is a city located in the Satara District of Maharashtra state of India, near the confluence of the river Krishna and its tributary, the Venna. The city was established in the 16th century and was the seat of the Chhatrapati of the Maratha Kingdom, Shahu I. 

It is the headquarters of Satara Tehsil, as well as the Satara District. The city gets its name from the seven forts (Sat-Tara) which are around the city. The city is known as a Soldier&#x27;s city as well as Pensioner&#x27;s city. The city had a population of 179,147 in 2011.

==History==
The first known Muslim rule of the Deccan took place in 1296. In 1636, the Nizam Shahi dynasty came to an end. In 1663, Shivaji conquered Parali and Satara fort. After the death of Chhatrapati Sambhaji(Son of Chatrpati ShivajiMaharaj) Shahu, heir apparent to the Maratha Kingdom, was captured by Mughals when he was only seven years old. He remained their prisoner until the death of Aurangzeb in 1707. 

The Dowager Maharani Tarabai proclaimed his younger half-brother, and her son, Shahu Sambhaji as Chhatrapati Maharaj under her regency. Mughals released Shahu under certain preconditions in 1707, so that Marathas would face an internal war for the throne. Shahu returned to the Maratha Kingdom and claimed his inheritance. 

Aurangzeb&#x27;s son Muhammad Azam Shah conquered Satara fort Ajinkyatara after a 6-month siege, later won by Parshuram Pratinidhi in 1706. In 1708, Chattrapati Shahu, the son of Chhatrapati Sambhaji, was crowned at the Satara fort. The direct descendants of Shivaji continue to live in Satara. Chhatrapati Udayanraje Bhonsle is the 13th descendant of Shivaji.

Satara was the first state to be annexed by British Governor-General Dalhousie’s policy of ‘Doctrine of Lapse’ in 1848.

A shadow government was established during Quit India movement in Satara.

<text>Harry Price (17 January 1881 – 29 March 1948) was a British psychic researcher and author, who gained public prominence for his investigations into psychical phenomena and exposing fraudulent spiritualist mediums. He is best known for his well-publicised investigation of the purportedly haunted Borley Rectory in Essex, England.

==Early life==
Although Price claimed his birth was in Shropshire he was actually born in London in Red Lion Square on the site of the South Place Ethical Society&#x27;s Conway Hall. He was only son and second child of Edward Ditcher Price (1834-1906), then traveller (salesman) for the paper manufacturing firm of Edward Saunders and Son, and his wife Emma Randall &quot;nee&quot; Meech (1860-1902). His father being born at Rodington in Shropshire, Price spent much time in the county in holidays with relatives. He was educated in New Cross, first at Waller Road Infants School and then Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Hatcham Boys&#x27; School. He completed his education at Goldsmiths College, studying chemistry, photography, electrical and mechanical engineering. In &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot;, he claimed to have been educated in Shropshire as well as London but did not name his schools.

At 15, Price founded the Carlton Dramatic Society and wrote plays, including a drama, about his early experience with a poltergeist which he said took place at a haunted unnamed manor house in Shropshire.

According to Richard Morris, in his biography &quot;Harry Price: The Psychic Detective&quot; (2006), Price came to the attention of the press when he claimed an early interest in space-telegraphy. He set up a receiver and transmitter between Telegraph Hill, Lewisham and St Peter&#x27;s Church Brockley and captured a spark on a photographic plate. This, though, was nothing more than Price writing a press release saying he had performed the experiment, as nothing was verified. 

The young Price also had an avid interest in coin collecting and wrote several articles for &quot;The Askean&quot;, the magazine for Haberdashers&#x27; School. In his autobiography, &quot;Search for Truth&quot;, written between 1941 and 1942, Price claimed he was involved with archaeological excavations in Greenwich Park, London, but, in earlier writings on Greenwich, he denied any such involvement. He also claimed to have uncovered Roman coins while earlier excavating at the site of Uriconium in Wroxeter, Shropshire, serialised an article on &quot;Shropshire Tokens and Mints&quot; in the &quot;Wellington Journal and Shrewsbury News&quot; from 1902 to 1904, at age 21 published his first book, on &quot;The Coins of Kent&quot;, and served as honorary curator of numismatics at Ripon Museum, North Yorkshire, in 1904.

From around May 1908 Price continued his interest in archaeology at Pulborough, Sussex, where he had moved prior to marrying Constance Mary Knight, only daughter of Robert Hastings Knight, on 1 August that year. As well as working as a salesman for paper merchants Edward Saunders &amp; Sons, he wrote for two local Sussex newspapers: the &quot;West Sussex Gazette&quot; and the &quot;Southern Weekly News&quot; in which he related his remarkable propensity for discovering &#x27;clean&#x27; antiquities. One of these, a &#x27;silver&#x27; ingot (discovered by Richard Morris to be housed in Price&#x27;s collection of artefacts at Senate House, University of London and made of base materials) was stamped around the time of the last Roman emperor Honorius. A few years later, another celebrated Sussex archaeologist, Charles Dawson, found a brick at Pevensey Fort in Sussex, which was purportedly made in Honorius&#x27; time. In 1910 Professor Francis J. Haverfield of Oxford University, the country&#x27;s foremost expert on Roman history and a Fellow of the Royal Academy, declared the ingot to be a fake.
A report for the &quot;Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries&quot; (number 23, pages 121–9) in the same year reported that:
Through his father, who died in 1906, he inherited a share in the paper firm which gave him more independent means to support his interests. At the start of the First World War he attempted to enlist for service but was medically rejected because of heart strain though he offered the Royal Flying Corps assistance with colour filters for aerial photography. At his Pulborough home he set up a workshop for making shell-fuses and in 1918 worked as night shift foreman at a munitions works in Tottenham.

==Interest in magic and conjuring==

In his autobiography, &quot;Search for Truth&quot;, Price said encountering the &quot;Great Sequah&quot; in Shrewsbury was &quot;entirely responsible for shaping much of my life&#x27;s work&quot;, and led to him acquiring the first volume of what would become the Harry Price Library. He met the purportedly Native American magician when the latter appeared with a troupe in 1889 when Price was aged eight and reportedly cured Price of a toothache. Price later became an expert amateur conjurer, joined the Magic Circle in 1922 and maintained a lifelong interest in stage magic and conjuring. His expertise in sleight-of-hand and magic tricks stood him in good stead for what would become his all consuming passion, the investigation of paranormal phenomena.

The psychical researcher Eric Dingwall and Price re-published an anonymous work written by a former medium entitled &quot;Revelations of a Spirit Medium&quot; (1922) which exposed the tricks of mediumship and the fraudulent methods of producing &quot;spirit hands&quot;. Originally all the copies of the book were bought up by spiritualists and deliberately destroyed.

==Psychical research==
Price joined the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) in 1920. He used his knowledge of conjuring to debunk fraudulent mediums, but unlike other magicians, Price endorsed some mediums that he believed were genuine. Price&#x27;s first major success in psychical research came in 1922 when he exposed the &#x27;spirit&#x27; photographer William Hope. In the same year he travelled to Germany together with Eric Dingwall and investigated Willi Schneider at the home of Baron Albert von Schrenck-Notzing in Munich. In 1923, Price exposed the medium Jan Guzyk; according to Price, the &quot;man was clever, especially with his feet, which were almost as useful to him as his hands in producing phenomena&quot;.

Price wrote that the photographs depicting the ectoplasm of the medium Eva Carrière taken with Schrenck-Notzing looked artificial and two-dimensional, as if made from cardboard and newspaper portraits, and that there were no scientific controls as both her hands were free. In 1920, Carrière was investigated by psychical researchers in London. An analysis of her ectoplasm revealed it to be made of chewed paper. She was also investigated in 1922 and the result of the tests were negative. In 1925, Price investigated Maria Silbert and caught her using her feet and toes to move objects in the séance room. He also investigated the &quot;direct voice&quot; mediumship of George Valiantine in London. In the séance Valiantine claimed to have contacted the &quot;spirit&quot; of the composer Luigi Arditi, speaking in Italian. Price wrote down every word that was attributed to Arditi and they were found to be word-for-word matches in an Italian phrase-book.

Price formed an organisation in 1925 called the National Laboratory of Psychical Research as a rival to the Society for Psychical Research. Price had a number of disputes with the SPR, most notably over the mediumship of Rudi Schneider. Price paid mediums to test them-the SPR criticised Price and disagreed about paying mediums for testing.

Price made a formal offer to the University of London to equip and endow a Department of Psychical Research, and to loan the equipment of the National Laboratory and its library. The University of London Board of Studies in Psychology responded positively to this proposal. In 1934, the National Laboratory of Psychical Research, which held Price&#x27;s collection, was reconstituted as the University of London Council for Psychical Investigation with C. E. M. Joad as chairman and with Price as Honorary Secretary and editor, although it was not an official body of the university. In the meantime, in 1927 Price joined the Ghost Club, of which he remained a member until it (temporarily) closed in 1936.

In 1927, Price claimed that he had come into possession of Joanna Southcott&#x27;s box, and arranged to have it opened in the presence of one reluctant prelate (the Bishop of Grantham, not a diocesan bishop but a suffragan of the Diocese of Lincoln): it was found to contain only a few oddments and unimportant papers, among them a lottery ticket and a horse-pistol. His claims to have had the true box have been disputed by historians and by followers of Southcott. Price exposed Frederick Tansley Munnings, who claimed to produce the independent &quot;spirit&quot; voices of Julius Caesar, Dan Leno, Hawley Harvey Crippen and King Henry VIII. Price invented and used a piece of apparatus known as a voice control recorder and proved that all the voices were those of Munnings. In 1928, Munnings admitted fraud and sold his confessions to a Sunday newspaper.

Price was friends with other debunkers of fraudulent mediums including Harry Houdini and the journalist Ernest Palmer.
In 1933, Frank Decker was investigated by Price at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research. Under strict scientific controls that Price contrived, Decker failed to produce any phenomena at all. Price&#x27;s psychical research continued with investigations into Karachi&#x27;s Indian rope trick and the fire-walking abilities of Kuda Bux in 1935. He was also involved in the formation of the National Film Library (British Film Institute) becoming its first chairman (until 1941) and was a founding member of the Shakespeare Film Society. In 1936, Price broadcast from a supposedly haunted manor house in Meopham, Kent for the BBC and published &quot;The Confessions of a Ghost-Hunter&quot; and &quot;The Haunting of Cashen&#x27;s Gap&quot;. This year also saw the transfer of Price&#x27;s library on permanent loan to the University of London (see external links below), followed shortly by the laboratory and investigative equipment. In 1937, he conducted further televised experiments into fire-walking with Ahmed Hussain at Carshalton and Alexandra Palace, and also rented Borley Rectory for one year. The following year, Price re-established the Ghost Club, with himself as chairman, modernising it and changing it from a spiritualist association to a group of more or less open-minded sceptics that gathered to discuss paranormal topics. He was also the first to admit women to the club.

In the same year, Price conducted experiments with Rahman Bey who was &quot;buried alive&quot; in Carshalton. He also drafted a Bill for the regulation of psychic practitioners. In 1939, he organised a national telepathic test in the periodical &quot;John O&#x27;London&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. During the 1940s, Price concentrated on writing and the works &quot;The Most Haunted House in England&quot;, &quot;Poltergeist Over England&quot; and &quot;The End of Borley Rectory&quot; were all published.

Price was offered by the government of Nazi Germany the Red Cross Medal if he would start a department of parapsychology at the University of Bonn but the project was frustrated by the outbreak of the Second World War and he did not receive the medal or a university doctorate that had also been offered over the same project.

==Famous cases==

===William Hope===

On 4 February 1922, Price with James Seymour, Eric Dingwall and William Marriott had proven the spirit photographer William Hope was a fraud during tests at the British College of Psychic Science. Price wrote in his SPR report &quot;William Hope has been found guilty of deliberately substituting his own plates for those of a sitter ... It implies that the medium brings to the sitting a duplicate slide and faked plates for fraudulent purposes.&quot;

Price secretly marked Hope&#x27;s photographic plates, and provided him with a packet of additional plates that had been covertly etched with the brand image of the Imperial Dry Plate Co. Ltd. in the knowledge that the logo would be transferred to any images created with them. Unaware that Price had tampered with his supplies, Hope then attempted to produce a number of Spirit photographs. Although Hope produced several images of alleged spirits, none of his materials contained the Imperial Dry Plate Co. Ltd logo, or the marks that Price had put on Hope&#x27;s original equipment, showing that he had exchanged prepared materials containing fake spirit images for the provided materials.

Price later re-published the Society&#x27;s experiment in a pamphlet of his own called &quot;Cold Light on Spiritualistic &quot;Phenomena&quot; – An Experiment with the Crewe Circle.&quot; Due to the exposure of Hope and other fraudulent spiritualists, Arthur Conan Doyle led a mass resignation of eighty-four members of the Society for Psychical Research, as they believed the Society was opposed to spiritualism. Doyle threatened to have Price evicted from his laboratory and claimed if he persisted to write &quot;sewage&quot; about spiritualists, he would meet the same fate as Houdini. Doyle and other spiritualists attacked Price and tried for years to have Price take his pamphlet out of circulation. Price wrote &quot;Arthur Conan Doyle and his friends abused me for years for exposing Hope.&quot;

===Eileen Garrett===

On 7 October 1930 it was claimed by spiritualists that Eileen J. Garrett made contact with the spirit of Herbert Carmichael Irwin at a séance held with Price at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research two days after the R101 disaster, while attempting to contact the then recently deceased Arthur Conan Doyle, and discussed possible causes of the accident. The event &quot;attracted worldwide attention&quot;, thanks to the presence of a reporter. Major Oliver Villiers, a friend of Brancker, Scott, Irwin, Colmore and others aboard the airship, participated in further séances with Garrett, at which he claimed to have contacted both Irwin and other victims. Price did not come to any definite conclusion about Garrett and the séances:

Garrett&#x27;s claims have since been questioned. The magician John Booth analysed the mediumship of Garrett and the paranormal claims of R101 and considered her to be a fraud. According to Booth Garrett&#x27;s notes and writings show she followed the building of the R101 and she may have been given aircraft blueprints by a technician from the airdrome. However, the researcher Melvin Harris who studied the case wrote no secret accomplice was needed as the information described in Garrett&#x27;s séances were &quot;either commonplace, easily absorbed bits and pieces, or plain gobbledegook. The so-called secret information just doesn&#x27;t exist.&quot;

===Rudi Schneider===

In the 1920s and early 1930s Price investigated the medium Rudi Schneider in a number of experiments conducted at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research. Schneider claimed he could levitate objects but according to Price a photograph taken on 28 April 1932 showed that Schneider had managed to free his arm to move a handkerchief from the table. After this, many scientists considered Schneider to be exposed as a fraud. Price wrote that the findings of the other experiments should be revised due to the evidence showing how Schneider could free himself from the controls.

After Price had exposed Schneider, various scientists, such as Karl Przibram and the magician Henry Evans, wrote to Price telling him that they agreed that Schneider would evade control during his séances and congratulated Price on the success of unmasking the fraud. In opposition, SPR members who were highly critical of Price, supported Schneider&#x27;s mediumship and promoted a conspiracy theory that Price had hoaxed the photograph. SPR member Anita Gregory claimed Price had deliberately faked the photograph to discredit SPR research and ruin Schneider&#x27;s reputation. However, a photographic expert testified that the photograph was genuine. SPR member John L. Randall reviewed the Price and Schneider case and came to the conclusion that the photograph was genuine and that Price had caught Schneider in fraud.

===Helen Duncan===

In 1931, the National Laboratory of Psychical Research took on its most illustrious case. £50 was paid to the medium Helen Duncan so that she could be examined under scientific conditions. Price was sceptical of Duncan and had her perform a number of test séances. She was suspected of swallowing cheesecloth which was then regurgitated as &quot;ectoplasm&quot;. Price had proven through analysis of a sample of ectoplasm produced by Duncan, that it was made of cheesecloth. Duncan reacted violently at attempts to X-ray her, running from the laboratory and making a scene in the street, where her husband had to restrain her, destroying the controlled nature of the test. Price wrote that Duncan had given her fake ectoplasm to her husband to hide. The ectoplasm of Duncan in another test was analysed by psychical researchers and reported to be made from egg white. According to Price:

Price wrote up the case in &quot;Leaves from a Psychist&#x27;s Case Book&quot; (1933) in a chapter called &quot;The Cheese-Cloth Worshippers&quot;. In his report Price published photographs of Duncan in his laboratory that revealed fake ectoplasm made from cheesecloth, rubber gloves and cut-out heads from magazine covers which she pretended to her audience were spirits. Following the report written by Price, Duncan&#x27;s former maid Mary McGinlay confessed in detail to having aided Duncan in her mediumship tricks, and Duncan&#x27;s husband admitted the ectoplasm materialisations to be the result of regurgitation. Later Duncan was caught cheating again pretending to be a spirit in the séance room. During Duncan&#x27;s famous trial in 1944, Price gave his results as evidence for the prosecution. This time Duncan and her travelling companions, Frances Brown, Ernest and Elizabeth Homer were prosecuted and convicted. Duncan was jailed for nine months, Brown for four months and the Homers were bound over.
===Brocken experiment===
In 1932, Price travelled to Mount Brocken in Germany with C. E. M. Joad and members of the National Laboratory to conduct a &#x27;black magic&#x27; experiment in connection with the centenary of Goethe. The &quot;Bloksberg Tryst&quot;, involving the transformation of a goat into a young man by the invocation of a maiden, Uta Bohn (better known as the film actress Gloria Gordon, 1881–1962), produced a great deal of publicity but not the magical transformation. Price claimed he carried out the experiment &quot;if only to prove the fallacy of transcendental magic.&quot;

===Gef===

In July 1935 Price and his friend Richard Lambert went to the Isle of Man to investigate the alleged case of Gef the talking mongoose and produced the book &quot;The Haunting of Cashen&#x27;s Gap&quot; (1936). In the book they avoided saying that they believed the story but were careful to report it as though with an open mind. The book reports how a hair from the alleged mongoose was sent to Julian Huxley who then sent it to naturalist F. Martin Duncan who identified it as a dog hair. Price suspected the hair belonged to the Irving&#x27;s sheepdog, Mona.

Price asked Reginald Pocock of the Natural History Museum to evaluate pawprints allegedly made by Gef in plasticine together with an impression of his supposed tooth marks. Pocock could not match them to any known animal, though he conceded that one of them might have been &quot;conceivably made by a dog&quot;. He did state that none of the markings had been made by a mongoose.

Price visited the Irvings and observed double walls of wooden panelling covering the interior rooms of the old stone farmhouse which featured considerable interior air space between stone and wood walls that &quot;makes the whole house one great speaking-tube, with walls like soundingboards. By speaking into one of the many apertures in the panels, it should be possible to convey the voice to various parts of the house.&quot; According to Richard Wiseman &quot;Price and Lambert were less than enthusiastic about the case, concluding that only the most credulous of individuals would be impressed with the evidence for Gef.&quot;

The diaries of James Irving, along with reports about the case, are in Harry Price&#x27;s archives in the Senate House Library, University of London.

===Borley Rectory===

Price was most famous for his investigation into the Borley Rectory, Essex. The building became known as &quot;the most haunted house in England&quot; after Price published a book about it in 1940. He documented a series of alleged hauntings from the time the rectory was built in 1863. He lived in the rectory from May 1937 to May 1938 and wrote of his experiences in the book.

The psychical researcher John L. Randall wrote there was direct evidence of &quot;dirty tricks&quot; played upon Price by members of the SPR. On 9 October 1931, a past president of the SPR, William Henry Salter, visited the Borley Rectory in an attempt to persuade the Rector Lionel Foyster to sever his links with Price and work with the SPR instead. After Price&#x27;s death in 1948, Eric Dingwall, Kathleen M. Goldney, and Trevor H. Hall, three members of the Society for Psychical Research, two of whom had been Price&#x27;s most loyal associates, investigated his claims about Borley. Their findings were published in a 1956 book, &quot;The Haunting of Borley Rectory&quot;, which concluded Price had fraudulently produced some of the phenomena.

The &quot;Borley Report&quot;, as the SPR study has become known, stated that many of the phenomena were either faked or due to natural causes such as rats and the strange acoustics attributed to the odd shape of the house. In their conclusion, Dingwall, Goldney, and Hall wrote &quot;when analysed, the evidence for haunting and poltergeist activity for each and every period appears to diminish in force and finally to vanish away.&quot; Terence Hines wrote &quot;Mrs. Marianne Foyster, wife of the Rev. Lionel Foyster who lived at the rectory from 1930 to 1935, was actively engaged in fraudulently creating [haunted] phenomena. Price himself ‘salted the mine’ and faked several phenomena while he was at the rectory.&quot;

Robert Hastings was one of the few SPR researchers to defend Price. Price&#x27;s literary executor Paul Tabori and Peter Underwood have also defended Price against accusations of fraud. A similar approach was made by Ivan Banks in 1996. Michael Coleman in an SPR report in 1997 wrote Price&#x27;s defenders are unable to rebut the criticisms convincingly.

Price&#x27;s investigation of Borley was the subject of a 2013 best selling novel by Neil Spring, titled &quot;The Ghost Hunters&quot;. This novel was subsequently adapted for television as &quot;Harry Price: Ghost Hunter&quot;, starring Rafe Spall, Cara Theobold and Richie Campbell.

===Rosalie===
Price claimed to have attended a private séance on 15 December 1937 in which a small six-year-old girl called Rosalie appeared. Price wrote he controlled the room by placing starch powder over the floor, locking the door and taping the windows before the séance. However, the identity of the sitters, or the locality where the séance was held was not revealed due to the alleged request of the mother of the child. During the séance Price claimed a small girl emerged, she spoke and he took her pulse. Price was suspicious that the supposed spirit of the child was no different to a human being but after the séance had finished the starch powder was undisturbed and none of the seals had been removed on the window. Price was convinced no one had entered the room via door or window during the séance. Price&#x27;s &quot;Fifty Years of Psychical Research&quot; (1939) describes his experiences at the sitting and includes a diagram of the séance room.

Eric Dingwall and Trevor Hall wrote the Rosalie séance was fictitious and Price had lied about the whole affair but had based some of the details on the description of the house from a sitting he attended at a much earlier time in Brockley, South London where he used to live. K. M. Goldney who had criticised Price over his investigation into Borley Rectory wrote after the morning of the Rosalie sitting she found Price &quot;shaken to the core by his experience.&quot; Goldney believed Price had told the truth about the séance and informed the &quot;Two Worlds&quot; spiritualist weekly newspaper that she believed the Rosalie sitting to be genuine.

In 1985, Peter Underwood published a photograph of part of an anonymous letter that was sent to the SPR member David Cohen in the 1960s which claimed to be from a séance sitter who attended the séance. The letter confessed to having impersonated the Rosalie child in the sitting by the request of the father who had owed the mother of the child money. In 2017, Paul Adams published details of the location of the Rosalie seance and identities of the family involved.

==Reception==

Psychologist and sceptic Richard Wiseman has praised Price for his work in debunking fraudulent mediums and investigating paranormal claims. According to Wiseman &quot;Price devoted the scientific study to weird stuff ... that both delighted the world&#x27;s media and infuriated believers and sceptics alike.&quot; The stage magician and scientific sceptic James Randi wrote Price accomplished some valuable and genuine research but lived &quot;a strange mixture of fact and fraud.&quot;

Psychical researcher Renée Haynes described Price as &quot;one of the most fascinating and storm-provoking figures in psychical research.&quot; Science writer Mary Roach in her book &quot;&quot; (2010) favourably mentioned Price&#x27;s methods and research in debunking the fraudulent medium Helen Duncan.

Several biographies have been written about Price. Paul Tabori&#x27;s biography (1950) is generally sympathetic. Historian Trevor H. Hall&#x27;s (1978) is much more critical. The latest biography by Richard Morris (2006) is also critical, concluding that Price should best be remembered as a &quot;supreme bluffer, a hedonistic con man, a terrific raconteur, a great conjuror, a gifted writer and a wonderful eccentric.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
Price experienced a massive heart attack at his home in Pulborough, West Sussex and died almost instantly on 29 March 1948. He was buried in the churchyard of St Mary&#x27;s, Pulborough.

His archives were deposited with the University of London between 1976 and 1978 by his widow. They include his correspondence, drafts of his publications, papers relating to libel cases, reports on his investigations, press cuttings and photographs. His collection of magic books and periodicals is held at Senate House Library, part of the University of London and is called the Harry Price Library of Magical Literature. The collection, which includes 13,000 items, was established by a bequest from his estate in 1948.

<text>Murraya () is a genus of flowering plants in the citrus family, Rutaceae. It is distributed in Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. The center of diversity is in southern China and Southeast Asia. When broadly circumscribed, the genus has about 17 species. A narrower circumscription contains only eight species, others being placed in &quot;Bergera&quot; and &quot;Merrillia&quot;.

==Description==
Plants in the genus &quot;Murraya&quot; are shrubs or trees with pinnate leaves arranged alternately, usually glandular, aromatic, and leathery to membranous in texture. The leaflets vary in shape and have smooth or toothed edges. The inflorescence is a panicle, cyme, or small raceme of flowers growing at the ends of branches or in the leaf axils; some flowers are solitary. The fragrant flowers have 4 or 5 sepals and white petals and up to 10 straight stamens. The fruit is a fleshy berry with pulp but without the juice vesicles present in some related fruits. It is up to long and orange, red, or black.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Murraya&quot; was first formally described in 1771 by Carl Linnaeus in &quot;Mantissa Plantarum Altera&quot; from an unpublished description by Johann Gerhard König. The genus name commemorates the 18th-century German-Swedish herbal doctor Johan Andreas Murray, a student of Linnaeus. In 1986, Paul P.-H. But and co-authors separated off some species of &quot;Murraya&quot; as &quot;M.&quot; sect. &quot;Bergera&quot; based on chemical evidence. Evidence from pollen morphology and multiple molecular phylogenetic studies showed that when broadly circumscribed, &quot;Murraya&quot; was not monophyletic, and treating &quot;M.&quot; sect. &quot;Bergera&quot; as the separate genus &quot;Bergera&quot; has widespread support.

&quot;Murraya&quot; is in the subfamily Aurantioideae, which also includes the genus &quot;Citrus&quot;. It is in the tribe Clauseneae.

===Species list===
Studies have repeatedly shown that two sections into which &quot;Murraya&quot; has been divided, &quot;M.&quot; sect. &quot;Murraya&quot; and &quot;M.&quot; sect. &quot;Bergera&quot;, should be treated as separate genera. &quot;Murraya&quot; sensu stricto was revised in 2021, with eight species being accepted:
* &quot;Murraya alata&quot; – China Southeast, Hainan, Vietnam
* &quot;Murraya elongata&quot; – Myanmar
* &quot;Murraya glenieii&quot; – Sri Lanka
* &quot;Murraya lucida&quot; – Vanuatu
* &quot;Murraya omphalocarpa&quot; 
* &quot;Murraya paniculata&quot; – Tropical Asia to Vanuatu and Australia
* &quot;Murraya sumatrana&quot; 
* &quot;Murraya zollingeri&quot; 
Species that have been placed in &quot;Murraya&quot; sect. &quot;Bergera&quot; belong in &quot;Bergera&quot;, although , names for many have not been published. Further species still accepted in &quot;Murraya&quot; by Plants of the World Online are:
* &quot;Murraya caloxylon&quot; – Malayasia, Thailand; synonym of &quot;Merrillia caloxylon&quot;
* &quot;Murraya crenulata&quot; – Taiwan (Lan Yü) to Malesia and SW. Pacific; placed in &quot;M.&quot; sect. &quot;Bergera&quot;
* &quot;Murraya cyclopensis&quot; – W. New Guinea
* &quot;Murraya euchrestifolia&quot; – China South-Central, China Southeast, Hainan, Taiwan; placed in &quot;M.&quot; sect. &quot;Bergera&quot;
* &quot;Murraya exotica&quot; – China South-Central, China Southeast, Hainan, Taiwan
* &quot;Murraya glabra&quot; – Vietnam

==Uses==
&quot;Murraya&quot; species are used in landscaping. Some species can be grafted onto citrus rootstocks. Species have been used in traditional medicine, with various parts of the plants used to treat fever, pain, and dysentery. &quot;M. paniculata&quot; has been used to induce labor. It has been used in Cuba for painful inflammatory conditions.

In Myanmar, &quot;Murraya&quot; species are used to make thanaka, a cosmetic paste that is typically applied onto the face.

==Chemistry==
Compounds isolated from &quot;Murraya&quot; include many types of coumarins and alkaloids. The novel alkaloid yuehchukene was found in &quot;M. paniculata&quot;, and it has since been isolated from other &quot;Murraya&quot;. It is found in red-fruited species with larger petals, but not in black-fruited species with smaller petals. Some species also contain the carbazole girinimbine.

==Spelling competition==
In July 2021, 14-year old Zaila Avant-garde of Harvey, Louisiana, won the final of the 2021 Scripps National Spelling Bee by correctly spelling the word &quot;Murraya&quot;, and was the first African American to win the 96-year-old event.

<text>Walter Herman Wager (September 4, 1924 – July 11, 2004) was an American crime and espionage-thriller novelist and former editor-in-chief of &quot;Playbill&quot; magazine. The movie &quot;Telefon&quot;, starring Charles Bronson, was inspired by his novel of the same name. His book &quot;58 Minutes&quot; was adapted into &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;, starring Bruce Willis.

==Education and career==
Walter Wager was born in The Bronx, New York City, the son of a doctor and a nurse who had emigrated from the Russian Empire. A 1944 graduate of Columbia College, where he was a member of the Philolexian Society, he went on to a Harvard Law School degree three years later. Passing the bar exams but choosing not to practice, he went on to receive a master&#x27;s degree in aviation law from Chicago&#x27;s Northwestern University in 1949, while also serving as an editor of the &quot;Journal of Air Law and Commerce&quot;, then based in that city.

Afterward, he spent a year at the Sorbonne, in Paris, as a Fulbright Fellow. He spent a year in Israel as an aviation-law consultant for the Israeli Department of Civil Aviation, helping to negotiate a treaty on air space and working out of Lydda Airport in Tel Aviv. In 1952, he returned to New York City, where he worked for the United Nations, editing documents.

Shortly afterward, Wager segued into writing and producing radio and television documentaries for CBS and NBC, and the United States Information Agency, while also beginning a side career as a freelance writer for magazines including &quot;Playbill&quot; and &quot;Show&quot;. Under the pseudonym John Tiger, he wrote the paperback original &quot;Death Hits the Jackpot&quot; (Avon #605) for Avon Books, the fifth publisher he contacted; published in 1954, it paid him $3,000. He recalled in 2000, &quot;I had a friend at a paperback publishing house. I like mystery stories so I thought I could sell this kind of prose.&quot; For several years he worked as a freelance writer.

Two years later, he published a second Avon paperback, &quot;Operation Intrigue&quot;, under the name Walter Herman. From 1963 to 1996, Wager was editor-in-chief of &quot;Playbill&quot; magazine, and from 1966 to 1978 as editor of &quot;ASCAP Today&quot;, the magazine of the music-licensing organization the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers; he later became ASCAP&#x27;s public-relations director. He held a similar position at the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut in the early 1990s, until his retirement in 1993. He also did public relations for organizations including the Juilliard School, the Mann Music Center, and the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre Center.

Wager was a member of the board of directors of the Mystery Writers of America, and its secretary beginning in 2001.

==Personal life==
Wager married Sylvia Leonard (d. 1989), a fellow American student he met at the Sorbonne, in 1951 in Paris. The two had a daughter, Lisa, before the marriage ended in divorce. He married second wife Winifred McIvor Wage in 1975.

A resident of Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side, he died of complications of brain cancer in 2004, at the assisted-living facility Amsterdam House in Manhattan.

==Books==
Wager was best known as an author of crime and espionage thrillers. His novel &quot;Viper Three&quot; (Macmillan, 1971) was released as &quot;Twilight&#x27;s Last Gleaming&quot;, with Burt Lancaster and Richard Widmark, in 1977. That same year, his spy novel &quot;Telefon&quot; (Macmillan, 1975) was adapted as the same-name movie starring Charles Bronson and Lee Remick. Wager&#x27;s airport-based thriller &quot;58 Minutes&quot; (1987) became the basis for the 1990 action film &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;, starring Bruce Willis. Additionally, Wager wrote a number of original novels in the 1960s under the pseudonym &quot;John Tiger&quot; that were based on the TV series &quot;I Spy&quot; and &quot;&quot;. He also wrote the farce &quot;My Side, by King Kong as Told to Walter Wager&quot;, published by Macmillan in 1976.

His series &quot;Blue Leader&quot;, &quot;Blue Moon&quot;, and &quot;Blue Murder&quot; featured tough Beverly Hills private detective Alison Gordon. As one of several writers using the pseudonym Lee Davis Willoughby, Wager also wrote the historical novels &quot;The Wildcatters&quot; and &quot;The Caribbeans&quot;.

<text>Qalqilya or Qalqiliya () is a Palestinian city in the West Bank which serves as the administrative center of the Qalqilya Governorate. In the 2017 census, the city had a population of 51,683. Qalqilya is surrounded by the Israeli West Bank wall, with a narrow gap in the east controlled by the Israeli military and a tunnel to the Palestinian town of Hableh. Qalqilya is under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority (as part of Area A), while remaining under Israeli military occupation. 

==Etymology==
Qalqilya was known as &quot;Calecailes&quot; in the Roman period, and &quot;Calcelie&quot; in the Frankish sources from the early Medieval times. The word &quot;Qalqilya&quot; might be derived from a Canaanite term which means &quot;rounded stones or hills&quot;.According to E.H. Palmer, the name came from &quot;a type of pomegranate&quot;, or &quot;gurgling of water&quot;.

==History==
The vicinity of Qalqilya has been populated since prehistoric times, as attested to by the discovery of prehistoric flint tools.

===Ottoman period===
In 1596, Qalqilya appeared in Ottoman tax registers (transliterated as &quot;Qalqili&quot;) as a village in the &quot;nahiya&quot; (subdistrict) of Bani Sa&#x27;b in the &quot;Liwa&quot; of Nablus. It had a population of 13 Muslim households and paid a total of 3,910 akçe in taxes on wheat, barley, summer crops, olives, and goats or beehives.

In 1838, Edward Robinson described &quot;Kulakilieh&quot; as a village in &quot;Beni Sa&#x27;ab&quot; district, west of Nablus.

In 1870, Victor Guérin found a population of 200. In 1870/1871 (1288 AH), an Ottoman census listed the village in the &quot;nahiya&quot; (sub-district) of Bani Sa&#x27;b.

In 1882, Qalqilya was described as &quot;A large somewhat straggling village, with cisterns to the north and a pool on the south-west. The houses are badly built.&quot; In 1883 some moved there from nearby Baqat al-Hatab, and in 1909 a municipal council to administer Qalqilya was established.

===British Mandate period===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Qalqilya had a population of 2,803 (2,794 Muslims and 9 Christians), increasing in the 1931 census to 3,867 (3,855 Muslims and 12 Christians), in a total of 796 houses.

In the 1938 statistics the population is listed at 4,503 (including 4 Jews). In the 1945 statistics the population of Qalqilya was 5,850 (5,840 Muslims and 10 Christians), who owned 27,915 dunams of land according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 3701 dunams were for citrus and bananas, 3,232 were plantations and irrigable land, 16,197 used for cereals, while 273 dunams were built-up (urban) land.

According to Sami Hadawi, the town had been &quot;one of the most prosperous in Palestine, owning extensive orange groves and serving as one of the main vegetable markets of the country.&quot; 


===1948 War===
In the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and after the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Qalqilya came under Jordanian rule. During the war, many inhabitants from Kafr Saba, Abu Kishk, Miska, Biyar &#x27;Adas and Shaykh Muwannis resettled in Qalqilya. 
Residents of Qalqilya who left during the fighting returned with the arrival of the Jordanian Arab Legion and the Iraqi expeditionary force, apart from 2,000 upper-class residents who settled in Nablus for economic reasons. Sami Hadawi claims that the armistice lines established in 1949 &quot;severed all [Qalqilya&#x27;s] orange groves in favour of Israel,&quot; leaving the town &quot;landless except for its rocky areas towards the east.&quot; 

===Jordanian period===
The area was annexed by Jordan in 1950. On the night of 10 October 1956 the Israeli army launched a raid against Qalqilya police station in response to a Jordanian attack on Israeli bus, among other incidents. The attack was ordered by Moshe Dayan and involved several thousand soldiers. During the fighting a paratroop company was surrounded by Jordanian troops and escaped under close air-cover from four Israeli Air Force aircraft. Eighteen Israelis and between 70 and 90 Jordanians were killed in the operation.

In 1961, the population of Qalqilya was 11,401.

===Post 1967===
In the wake of the Six-Day War in 1967, Qalqilya came under Israeli occupation. Dozens of inhabitants were expelled to Jordan as part of the Palestinian expulsions of 1967 known as the Naksa. 850 buildings were razed. In his memoirs, Moshe Dayan wrote that these actions ultimately constituted &quot;collective punishment&quot; which was contrary to government policy. The villagers were eventually allowed to return and the reconstruction of damaged houses was financed by the military authorities. In September 1967, a census found 8,922 persons, of whom 1,837 were originally from Israeli territory.

As part of the 1993 Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), control of Qalqilya was transferred to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) on 17 December 1995.

In 2003, the Israeli West Bank barrier was built, encircling the town and separating it from agricultural lands on the other side of the wall.

In November 2015, Israel arrested what it alleged to be a network of 24 Hamas militants active in the city.

On 20 October 2017, the municipality of Qalqilya named a street after Saddam Hussein and erected a memorial with his likeness. The monument was unveiled at a ceremony attended by the Qalqilya District Governor Rafi Rawajba and two other Palestinian officials. It bears the slogan &quot;Saddam Hussein – The Master of the Martyrs in Our Age&quot;.

On 19 June 2022, a 53-year-old Palestinian was shot and killed by Israeli forces as he sought to cross the Israeli West Bank barrier, which encircles Qalqilya. According to the IDF, he damaged the security fence in an attempt to cross into Israeli territory. It&#x27;s unclear whether he was armed.

On 22 June 2024, a 60-year-old Israeli citizen was shot dead in Qalqilya by local residents. The victim, from Petah Tikva, regularly bought vegetables in the city. Following the shooting, his car was set on fire, and his personal documents were taken. This incident was the third in Qalqilya within 48 hours, following another attack on Thursday, where a 70-year-old Israeli was killed, and the elimination of two Islamic Jihad operatives who planned an attack.

==Geography==
Qalqilya is located in the northwestern West Bank, straddling the border with Israel. It is 16 kilometers southwest of the Palestinian city of Tulkarm, and the nearest localities are the Arab-Israeli city of Tira and the Palestinian hamlet of &#x27;Arab al-Ramadin al-Shamali to the northeast, the Palestinian village of Nabi Ilyas to the east, the Palestinian hamlets &#x27;Arab Abu Farda and &#x27;Arab ar-Ramadin al-Janubi and the Israeli settlement of Alfei Menashe to the southwest, and the Palestinian village Habla and Arab-Israeli town of Jaljuliya to the south. It contains the point in the West Bank closest to the Mediterranean Sea, with about 14 km to the coast at Shefayim.

Qalqilya has an average elevation of 57 meters above sea level. The average annual rainfall 587.4 millimeters and the average annual temperature is 19 degrees Celsius.

==Demographics==

The 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) recorded Qalqilya&#x27;s population to be 22,168. The majority of the inhabitants (69.8%) were Palestinian refugees or their descendants. In the 2007 census, Qalqilya&#x27;s population was 41,739 (50.9% male and (49.1% female)). The number of registered households was 7,866.
In the 2017 census, Qalqiliya&#x27;s population was 51,683.

==Government==
Hamas won the 2006 municipal elections in Qalqiliya and one of its members, Wajih Qawas, became mayor, although he was incarcerated by Israel for much of his term. On 12 September 2009, the PNA dismissed Qawas for allowing Qalqiliya&#x27;s debt to grow unchecked, failing to attract international funding for city projects and ignoring orders by the Palestinian government. Qawas, however, viewed his dismissal as a result of the ongoing feud between Hamas, which dominates the PNA in the Gaza Strip and Fatah, which dominates the PNA in the West Bank. Human rights groups criticized Qawas&#x27;s dismissal, condemning the intervention by the central Palestinian authorities in the affairs of an elected official. During the 2012 municipal elections, Fatah member Othman Dawood was elected mayor.

==Economy==

Between 1967 and 1995 almost 80 percent of Qalqilya&#x27;s labor force worked for Israeli companies or industries in the construction and agriculture sectors. The remaining 20% engaged in trade and commerce, marketing across the Green Line. According to a field survey taken by the Applied Research Institute-Jerusalem (ARIJ), 45% of Qalqilya&#x27;s working population was employed by government, 25% worked in agriculture, 15% worked in trade and commerce, 10% worked in industry and 5% worked in Israeli labor. In 2012, the unemployment rate was 22%, with those most affected formerly employed in agriculture, trade and services.
Qalqilya is particularly known for its citrus crop and of its total of 10,252 dunams of land, (of which 5,930 are arable) 1802 dunams (about 17.6% of the city&#x27;s land and over 30% of its arable land) are planted with citrus trees. Other major crops are olives and vegetables. Local industries include the manufacture of foodstuffs, olive oil, dairy products, soap, glass, stone, marble and building materials, in addition to the manufacture of wood, and mineral water companies.

The Qalqilya Zoo, established in 1986, is currently the only zoo in the West Bank and in the State of Palestine, and, according to its owner, is the city&#x27;s single-largest employer. It serves as one of Qalqilya&#x27;s main attractions. The zoo houses 170 animals and works closely with zoologists from the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo and the Ramat Gan Safari.The only factory for prosthetic limbs in the northern West Bank is in Qalqilya.

=== Souqs ===
In Qalqilya there are many markets, including:

* &quot;Souq Abu Amsha&quot; (سوق أبو عمشة)
* &quot;Souq Shaheen&quot; (سوق شاهين)
* &quot;Souq Abu Jaber&quot; (سوق أبو جابر)
* &quot;Souq Beshara&quot; (سوق بشارة)
* &quot;Souq Uthman&quot; (سوق عثمان)
* &quot;Souq Um Tareq&quot; (سوق أم طارق)
* &quot;Souq Abu Aisha&quot; (سوق أبو عيشة)

===Land usage and the barrier===
Of the city&#x27;s total area of 10,252 dunams, 3,027 were built-up areas, 266 were used for industrial purposes, 2,894 were planted with permanent crops, 419 were used for greenhouses, 274 for livestock ranges, 2,343 others were classified as arable, and 283 dunams were occupied by the West Bank barrier. Nearly all of Qalqilya&#x27;s urban area is under Palestinian civil jurisdiction and Israeli military control (Area B), while 64.7% of the city&#x27;s municipal territory, mostly agricultural lands and open spaces, is under Israeli civil and military control (Area C).

Israel&#x27;s construction of the barrier began in 2002 and isolates Qalqilya from the north, west, south, and half of its eastern side, leaving a corridor in the east connecting it with smaller Palestinian villages and hamlets. Israel states its construction of the wall is for security purposes, particularly to prevent infiltration by Palestinian militants into Israel as had occurred during the Second Intifada. The Palestinians state that the barrier is meant to annex Palestinian lands (since the wall often juts deep into Palestinian territory) and control the movement of Palestinians. The barrier has negatively affected Qalqilya&#x27;s economy, particularly the commercial and trade sectors, because it has separated the city from nearby Palestinian localities and bordering Arab towns in Israel, which contributed about 40% of the city&#x27;s income prior to the barrier&#x27;s completion. The barrier has also separated 1,836 dunams of mostly agricultural lands and open spaces within Qalqilya&#x27;s jurisdiction from the city proper. Social relations between Qalqilya&#x27;s inhabitants and those of other Palestinian cities have also been hindered by the barrier.

==Education==
According to the 2007 PCBS census, 95.3% of the inhabitants over the age of 10 were literate. About 75% of the illiterate population were women. The town has 21 public schools, four private schools, three schools managed by UNRWA and 13 kindergartens. All schools are overseen by the Palestinian Ministry of Higher Education. As of 2012, there were 12,286 residents enrolled in school, with 660 teaching staff. In 2007, 10.5% of the population had graduated from an institution of higher education, while 15.7% had completed secondary education, 27.5% preparatory education, 27.4% elementary education and 13.8% had no formal education. There are two colleges in the city: the Ad Da&#x27;wa Islamic College established in 1978 and a campus of the Al-Quds Open University established in 1998.

== Culture ==
There are charities, recreational and cultural clubs, Qalqilya TV, and a radio station (Radio Nagham). In the Qalqilya governorate, the NGO Cultural Forum Society (جمعية منتدى المثقفين الخيرية) played a role in publicizing the residents&#x27; economic and political problems due to the occupation, the wall, and settlements.
== International relations ==
Qalqilya is twinned with:
* Mülheim, friendship.

<text>Shakambhari (Sanskrit: शाकम्भरी, IAST: Śākambharī), also referred to as Shatakshi, is a goddess of nourishment. She is regarded to be an incarnation of Mahadevi, and identified with Durga in Hinduism. After the malevolent asura Durgamasura deprived the earth of nourishment by causing the sages to forget the Vedas, the goddess appeared to offer human beings and devas sufficient fruits and vegetables to restore their strength.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;śākaṃbharī&quot; means &#x27;she who bears vegetables&#x27;. The word is derived from two words- &quot;śākaya&quot; (Sanskrit: शाक) which means &#x27;vegetable/vegan food&#x27; and &quot;bharī&quot; (Sanskrit: भरी) which means &#x27;holder/bearer/wearer&#x27; which is ultimately derived from the root word &quot;bhṛ&quot; (Sanskrit: भृ) which means &#x27;to bear/to wear/to nourish&#x27;.

== Legend ==
After the asura Durgamasura sought to plunge the earth in drought and scarcity, a century of suffering endured on earth, when the sages finally remembered the goddess Parvati after the asura had made them forget about the Vedas, she appeared upon the worlds in a dark-hued blue form, casting her hundred eyes on the sages. When the sages extolled and chanted the hymns of Ishvari, the four-handed goddess appeared bearing a lotus, arrows, a great bow, and vegetables, fruits, flower, and roots. According to the Devi Bhagavata Purana, seeing the misery of the people, she showered incessant tears from her eyes, streaming into rivers, and offering medicines.

== Temple ==
There is the main temple in Saharanpur ,Uttar pradesh .There are many various temples of Shakambhari Devi including one of the ancient temples in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh among the mountain range as it is most famous and visited by devotees after Vaishno Devi apart from that there is another major temple which is situated in Rajasthan near at Sambhar Lake Town jheel, a huge ground of dry salt lake. Shakambhari is worshiped as the ninth number among the nine deities in Navaratri after the beginning of Vaishno Devi.

<text>Tulkarm or Tulkarem (, &quot;Ṭūlkarm&quot;) is a Palestinian city in the West Bank, the capital of the Tulkarm Governorate of the State of Palestine. The Israeli city of Netanya is to the west, and the Palestinian cities of Nablus and Jenin to the east. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, in 2017 Tulkarm had a population of 64,532. Tulkarm is under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority.

==Etymology==
The Arabic name translates as &#x27;length of vinyard&#x27; but is a distortion of the Aramaic name &quot;Tur Karma&quot; (&#x27;mount of the vineyard&#x27;), which was used for Tulkarm by the Crusaders and by the mediaeval Samaritan inhabitants.

==History==
Benjamin Mazar identified Tulkarm with the toponym &quot;Birat Seriqa&quot; (בירת סריקא, lit. &#x27;Saracen tower&#x27; or &#x27;vineyard tower&#x27;), mentioned in the Talmud (b. AZ 31a; y. AZ 5:4) as located near the Samaritan town of Burgata (בורגתא/ברקתא, perhaps from &quot;burgus&quot;, &#x27;tower&#x27;), which may be modern Burj al-Atut. However, Félix-Marie Abel put Birat Seriqa closer to Kafr Qallil, and others put it near Qalqilya. Isaiah Press and Dov Zudkevitz suggest the true site may be somewhat west of Tulkarm, at in the Poleg basin.

===Ayyubid and Mamluk periods===
During the Ayyubid era, after the Muslim reconquest of Palestine under Sultan Saladin in 1187, the first families to settle in Tulkarm were from the Kurdish clan of Zaydan. A military group, the Zaydan were dispatched to the Wadi al-Sha&#x27;ir area, which includes Tulkarm, by Saladin to buttress the defense of the western approaches of Muslim-held Palestine from the Crusaders who dominated the coastal area.

The Zaydan politically dominated Tulkarm and the vicinity until the early 17th century. Around 1230, during the late Ayyubid period, a group of Arabs from southern Palestine immigrated to Tulkarm. They had originally migrated to Palestine from Arabia many generations prior and had become semi-nomadic farmers and grazers. Among the Arab families were the Fuqaha clan, who were considered &quot;ashraf&quot; (related to the Islamic prophet Muhammad) and served as the &quot;ulama&quot; (religious scholars) of the village.

During the Ayyubid, and later the Mamluk era (1260–1517), the majority of Tulkarm&#x27;s lands were made part of a &quot;waqf&quot; (religious trust) to support the al-Farisiyya Madrasa, an Islamic religious school in Jerusalem, located north of the Masjid Al-Aqsa compound. Two-thirds of the village&#x27;s farmlands were confirmed as part of this trust in 1354 by the deputy-governor of Damascus, Faris al-Din al-Baki. During Mamluk rule another wave of Arab immigrants arrived in Tulkarm from North Africa and nearby Nablus. They largely engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry, supplying hides to leather merchants in the coastal villages, retaken from the Crusaders in the second half of the 13th century.

===Ottoman era===
Tulkarm was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517. Afterward, Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent (r. 1520–66) transferred Tulkarm&#x27;s &quot;waqf&quot; to the al-Jawhariyya Madrasa (Commons), located in the Muslim Quarter, northwest of the al-Aqsa Mosque. Under this arrangement, Tulkarm&#x27;s inhabitants paid a third of their harvest as a tax towards the &quot;waqf&quot;, called &quot;qasm&quot;. At the time of the &quot;waqf&quot;&#x27;s reassignment, the population of the village was estimated at 522 (95 households) and the &quot;qasm&quot; consisted of eight carats of wheat and three carats of barley. The town&#x27;s elite families administered the trust, which enabled them to reach higher social and economic status. The population increased through intermarriage with families fleeing violent feuds between the various clans of Jabal Nablus. By 1548, the population had grown to 189 households or roughly 1,040 persons.

In 1596 Tulkarm appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being in the &quot;nahiya&quot; (subdistrict) of Qaqun, which was a part of the &quot;sanjak&quot; (district) of Nablus. The largest village in the &quot;nahiya&quot;, Tulkarm had a population of 176 Muslim households (roughly 968 persons) and paid taxes on wheat, barley, summer crops, olives, goats, beehives and a press for olives or grapes. During this early period of Ottoman rule, there were five neighborhoods (pl. &quot;harat&quot;) centered around the Shaykh Ali al-Jazri al-Mughrabi Mosque, today referred to simply as the &quot;Old Mosque&quot;. The population was overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim, and most residents were &quot;fellahin&quot; (peasants who worked the land.) The elite families during that time were the Zaydan and the Lajjun-based Tarabay, the latter belonging to the Bani Harith tribe. Because of the decentralized nature of the Ottoman state, these families and their successors in later centuries ruled the area with a high degree of autonomy. The Zaydan had particular authority over Tulkarm, being appointed as the &quot;mutassalim&quot; (tax collectors or enforcers) on behalf of the central authorities.

In the mid-17th-century most members of the Zaydan family, with the exception of the children and the elderly, were killed in a massacre by Tulkarm&#x27;s inhabitants during Friday prayers. This was in reaction to the Zaydan having forced Tulkarm&#x27;s residents to harvest and process the village&#x27;s grains for taxation purposes. Consequently, political power in Tulkarm passed to the Badran clan, while the Fuqaha family took control of administering the &quot;waqf&quot; lands, firmly establishing them as the village&#x27;s religious leaders. The Fuqaha had derived much of their authority from their classification as &quot;ashraf&quot; and their association with the Sufi Rifa&#x27;iyya &quot;zawiya&quot; of the village. The western neighborhood was mostly emptied of Zaydan members and would serve as the main area of settlement for newcomers.

Tulkarm appears on sheet 45 of Jacotin&#x27;s map drawn up during Napoleon&#x27;s invasion in 1799, named &quot;Toun Karin.&quot;

Following the adoption of the Ottoman Land Code in 1858, the &quot;musha&quot; (collective landownership) system was gradually abrogated and residents were required to register their property with the central authorities. The fellahin were wary of registering their names for fear of military conscription by the Ottoman state and instead entrusted various elite clans with the role of landlords, who were in effect absentee owners. This altered the area&#x27;s social structure, with the Samara, al-Hajj Ibrahim and Hanun clans legally obtaining vast swathes of Tulkarm&#x27;s lands. Leadership of the town&#x27;s two main religious establishments were generally supplied by the Kur-based Jayyusi clan and the al-Barqawi clan of Shufa. The Barqawi clan controlled the area around the town in the 19th century.

The 1860s French explorer Victor Guérin visited Tulkarm, which he described as being of &quot;considerable&quot; size, with about 1,000 inhabitants. During this time, the Ottoman authorities granted the village an agricultural plot of land called Ghabat Tulkarm in the former confines of the Forest of Arsur (Ar. Al-Ghaba) in the coastal plain, west of the village.

In 1882 the &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described Tulkarm as a &quot;long straggling village, on high ground&quot;, surrounded by arable land and rock. There were several &quot;good-sized&quot; houses, mainly of stone in the village.

Tulkarm became the administrative center of a new subdistrict (&quot;qada&#x27;&quot;) Bani Saʿb-Tulkarm in 1876, later becoming a municipality in 1892. Tulkarm was also appointed a governor, bringing the residents who numbered only a few thousand and who were mostly &quot;fellahin&quot;, closer to the central government. This elevated status gave Tulkarm precedence over the nearby villages, which at that time also included Qalqilya. Tulkarm&#x27;s center shifted from the Old Mosque to an empty space in the northwest as the town expanded northward with the construction of government buildings, a post office, a school and a hospital in that area.

Around the turn of the 20th century, Tulkarm was one of the villages in which the Hannun family owned extensive estates. The Hannuns fostered close ties with clans in the village.

In 1908, Tulkarm became a major rail junction on the Hejaz Railway line running up from Egypt and southern Palestine to Haifa and Acre in the northwest, Jerusalem, Nablus and Ramallah to the south, Lebanon to the north, and Syria and Transjordan to the east. The Ottoman Army used Tulkarm as one of its principal bases during the Sinai and Palestine campaign in World War I. It was bombed by British planes carried by HMS Anne. In 1918, it was captured by British forces.

===British Mandate era===

The British Mandatory administration (192–1947) in Palestine designated Tulkarm as the center of the Tulkarm Subdistrict.

In 1920, a road was constructed to connect the town with Netanya on the coast. In order to cope with a significant increase in population and unorganized infrastructural development, a civil planning scheme was designed for Tulkarm and its satellite villages in 1945. At the time Tulkarm was divided into four main sections, with the bulk of commercial activity concentrated along the north–south and east–west roads. Meanwhile, the town continued to expand past its northern fringes, which had previously been characterized by green spaces.

Tulkarm became a haven for Palestinian Arab rebel activity during the 1936–1939 Arab revolt against British rule in Palestine. General Commander of the Revolt Abd al-Rahim al-Hajj Muhammad hailed from Dhinnaba, today part of Tulkarm municipality, and led many operations in the region.

In the 1945 statistics the population of Tulkarm consisted of 8,090; of whom 7,790 were Muslims, 280 Christian and 20 &quot;other&quot;, with a land area of 1,672 dunams (urban) and 32,610 dunams (rural), according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 2,399 dunams were designated for citrus and bananas, 276 plantations and irrigable land, 28,256 for cereals, while 1,492 dunams were built-up areas.

===Jordanian rule===
During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Tulkarm was occupied by the Iraqi Army and later annexed as part of the Jordanian-held West Bank. The 1949 Armistice Agreements between Israel and Jordan left roughly 30,000 dunams of Tulkarm&#x27;s 32,610 dunams of land, mostly agricultural, in Israeli territory. In consequence, many residents moved to Transjordan or went abroad in search of employment. Straddling the armistice line, Tulkarm was cut off from nearby Arab towns. Its principal economic and social connection was with Nablus.

In 1950, the Tulkarm Camp was established by UNRWA in the city, comprising an area of . Most of the refugees who resided in the camp came from Jaffa, Caesarea and Haifa. Today it is the second largest Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank. A period of significant municipal expansion began in Tulkarm after a new civil development scheme was authorized in 1961. As part of this plan, in 1963, the hamlet of Jarrad in the southeast and other lands in the northeast (total of 1.8 square km) were annexed to the city, while the eastern village of Dhinnaba was incorporated into the municipality in 1964, adding another of territory. The village of Shuweika to the north and the smaller village of Irtah to the south were annexed in 1967.

===Contemporary period===

Since the Six-Day War in 1967, Tulkarm has been under Israeli occupation. A military government governed Tulkarm until transfer in 1982 to the Israeli Civil Administration.

During the early months of the First Intifada, 16 May 1989, Muhammad As&#x27;ad Fokhah, 50 years old, from Shuweika, died in Megiddo prison after a three-day hunger strike. Yitzhak Rabin reported to a Member of Knesset that Fokhah died of a heart attack caused by dehydration and that the military investigation found that prison staff had acted in accordance with orders.

In the wake of the 1993 Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), control of Tulkarm was transferred to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) on 10 December 1995, becoming the third Palestinian city from which Israeli forces withdrew. During the early years of the Second Intifada, Israel temporarily reoccupied Tulkarm. Israeli military administration over Tulkarm ended in 2005, when control of the city was handed back to the PNA. Upon assuming control of the city, the PNA instituted new weapons restrictions limiting militants to a single registered weapon that may not be loaded or carried in public.

On 19 October 2023, the IDF entered the city. In August 2024, Israeli bulldozers destroyed miles of the city, including homes, businesses and infrastructure; Israeli soldiers blocked emergency responders from assisting residents. News reports include videos of this attack, as well as assertions by the Israel Defense Forces that it is rooting out terrorism; and that it &quot;undertakes all feasible precautions to avoid damaging essential infrastructure,&quot; while acknowledging that these &quot;operations in the area have caused unavoidable harm to certain civilian structures.&quot;

==Geography==
The city is situated on the western edge of northern West Bank, about west of Nablus further southwest of Jenin and east of the Israeli coastal city of Netanya. It is bordered by the 1948 ceasefire line, with Israel&#x27;s Central and Haifa Districts to the west, and Palestine&#x27;s Qalqilya and Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorates to the south. Its central location between a plain and a mountain has made it commercially and strategically significant and has had a great impact on its growth. In the past, Tulkarm was a caravan station and a trading center for products from the city&#x27;s surrounding villages and farms, as well as a point from which armies crossed to Egypt and the Levant (al-Sham).

Tulkarm is at the crossroads of three historically important arteries: A road which runs north from the Latrun area along the edge of the coastal plain to Mount Carmel, Mount Tabor, Mount Gilboa, Nazareth and the Galilee and the Golan Heights, a road which winds northward along the outer tier of hills from the Ajalon valley to the Jezreel Valley, and a road that rises from the Mediterranean Sea at modern-day Netanya east to Nablus. In the past it was a junction of the coastal railroad from north of Haifa to Cairo and a branch of the narrow gauge Hejaz railway to Damascus.

==Demographics==
According to the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Tulkarm had a population of 3,350 (3,109 Muslims, 208 Christians, 23 Jews, eight Samaritans, one Baha&#x27;i, and one Druze). At the time of the 1931 census, Tulkarm had a population of 4,827 (4,540 Muslims, 255 Christians, 18 Jews, six Samaritans, and one Druze) with 541 in nearby suburbs (516 Muslims, 15 Jews, and 10 Christians).

The village statistics of 1938 list Tulkarm&#x27;s population as 5,700 with 629 in nearby suburbs (including 17 Jews). The village statistics of 1945 list the population as 8,090 (7,790 Muslims, 280 Christians, and 20 &quot;other&quot;).

The populations of Tulkarm, Dhinnaba, Shuweika and Irtah steadily increased by an average of 2% annually between 1931 and 1961, with a drastic increase after the 1948 War as the area experienced an influx of Palestinian refugees. The Jews presumably left/fled during the war. Following the 1967 War, the population saw a temporary decrease as some residents fled to Jordan. In the 1967 census by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics the population of Tulkarm city was recorded as 10,255, Tulkarm Camp as 5,020, Dhinnaba as 1,342, Irtah as 925, Shuweika as 2,332 and Khirbet Jarrad as 128, a total of 20,002. Most of the inhabitants were Muslims, although there was a community of 103 Christians according to the census.

In the first census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) in 1997, Tulkarm had a population of 33,921 and the Tulkarm Refugee Camp had a population of 5,884. Palestinian refugees made up 31.4% of the city&#x27;s residents and 94% of the camp&#x27;s inhabitants. The sex ratio for the city was 50.7% male and 49.3% female. Over half (52.2%) of the city&#x27;s population was under the age of 20, 44.5% were between the ages of 20 and 64 and 4.1% were over the age of 64. In the 2007 PCBS census Tulkarm&#x27;s population grew to 51,300 while the camp&#x27;s increased to 10,641. The sex ratio for the city was 50.3% male and 49.7% female.

Today the population is almost entirely Muslim. Prior to Israel&#x27;s occupation of the city in 1967, there were an estimated 1,000 Christians living in Tulkarm, but roughly half of the community emigrated in the aftermath of the war, while most of the remaining Christians gradually emigrated afterward. There are two Christian families who continue to live in Tulkarm, who are part of the same extended family. There is a Greek Orthodox church in the city dedicated to St. George, built in the early 19th century. The church is active and opens for visitors.

==Climate==
The climate of Tulkarm is Mediterranean and subtropical as the area surrounding it, with rainfall limited to the winter. The average temperature in the winter ranges from , while the average temperature in the summer ranges from . Tulkarm is distinguished by the moderating effect the sea breeze has on its climate because of its location in the mountains. The average temperature does not exceed in August, while February&#x27;s average temperature does not fall below . Humidity is moderate in summer, about 40-70%, though it rises in winter to between 70 and 85%. Tulkarm receives in excess of of rain yearly, which is dispersed and intermittent, characteristic of the Mediterranean Basin.

Rain in June and September is rare and comes to negligible amounts. July and August have no rain at all, except for one rainfall of on July 10, 1995, in Tulkarm city (Tulkarm Agricultural Department). The mean annual rainfall in the city of Tulkarm is for the period from 1952 to 1995 (Tulkarm Agricultural Department).

Prior to the 1948 War, Tulkarm had a major agricultural sector, with grain, olives and fruits, especially watermelons, being the major crops cultivated by in the town&#x27;s lands.

==Education==

Palestinian Technical University - Kadoorie which is the sole governmental university in Palestine, was established as an agricultural college in Tulkarem during the British Mandate by an endowment from the Iraqi-born Jewish philanthropist J.S. Kadoorie in 1930 and then became a university in 2007. Other institutions of higher learning include Al-Quds Open University and two campuses of An-Najah National University.

There are seven high schools in Tulkarm, three for girls (al-Adawiah, Jamal Abd al-Nasser, and Al-Khawaja) and three for boys (al-Fadilia, Ihsan Samara, and Adnan Sefareni) and a vocational school for both genders.
On September 24, 2016, the PA named a school in Tulkarem after Salah Khalaf. Tulkarem governor Issam Abu Bakr said that the school was named after “martyr Salah Khalaf in order to commemorate the memory of this great national fighter”.

==Culture==

<text>A highlighter, also called a fluorescent pen, is a type of writing device used to bring attention to sections of text by marking them with a vivid, translucent colour.
A typical highlighter is fluorescent yellow, with the color coming from pyranine. Different compounds, such as rhodamines (Rhodamine 6GD, Rhodamine B) are used for other colours.

==History==
A highlighter is a felt-tip marker filled with transparent fluorescent ink instead of black or opaque ink. The first highlighter was invented by Dr. Frank Honn in 1962
 and produced by Carter&#x27;s Ink Company, using the trademarked name Hi-Liter. Avery Dennison Corporation now owns the brand, having acquired Carter&#x27;s in 1975.

==Styles==
Many highlighters come in bright, often fluorescent and vibrant colors. Being fluorescent, highlighter ink glows under black light. The most common color for highlighters is yellow, but they are also found in orange, red, pink, purple, blue, and green varieties. Some yellow highlighters may look greenish in colour to the naked eye. Yellow is the preferred color to use when making a photocopy as it will not produce a shadow on the copy.

Highlighters are available in multiple forms, including some that have a retractable felt tip or an eraser on the end opposite the felt. Other types of highlighters include the &quot;trilighter&quot;, a triangularly-shaped pen with a different-coloured tip at each corner, and ones that are stackable. There are also some forms of highlighters that have a wax-like quality similar to an oil pastel.

&quot;Dry highlighters&quot; (occasionally called &quot;dry line highlighters&quot;) have an applicator that applies a thin strip of highlighter tape (physically similar to audio tape or correction tape) instead of a felt tip. Unlike standard highlighters, they are easily erasable. They are different from &quot;dry mark highlighters&quot;, which are sometimes advertised as being useful for highlighting books with thin pages.

&quot;Gel highlighters&quot; contain a gel stick rather than a felt tip. The gel does not bleed through paper or become dried out in the pen as other highlighters&#x27; inks may, which renders them useless.

&quot;Liquid Highlighters&quot; in a range of colours are also available, and because they put more ink on a page when highlighting, they make words stand out more than with non-liquid types. Also the fact that more highlighting ink is put on the page with liquid highlighters means that the highlighting ink is much more resistive to fading with age.

&quot;Pastel Highlighters&quot; use pastel dyes instead of fluorescent dyes.

==In software==

Some word processing software can simulate highlighting by using a technique similar to reverse video on some terminals. For example, the codice_1 command of Commodore 128 BASIC allows text to be displayed in reverse, which can be used to highlight text forms and selected items in menus.

Some forms of syntax highlighting may also be displayed in the style of a highlighter pen, with a bright or pastel background to the text. Some web browser extensions also enables users to create digital highlights on websites and online PDFs.

<doc id="851852" wikidata="Q244731" url="?curid=851852" title="Curry tree">
<text>The curry tree or Bergera koenigii (syn. &quot;Murraya koenigii&quot;), is a tropical and sub-tropical tree in the family Rutaceae (the rue family, which includes rue, citrus, and satinwood), native to Asia. The plant is also sometimes called sweet neem, though &quot;M. koenigii&quot; is in a different family from neem, &quot;Azadirachta indica&quot;, which is in the related family Meliaceae.

Its leaves, known as &quot;curry leaves&quot;, also referred to as &quot;sweet neem&quot;, are used in many dishes in the Indian subcontinent.

==Description==

It is a small tree, growing ) tall, with a trunk up to in diameter. The aromatic leaves are pinnate, with 11–21 leaflets, each leaflet long and broad. The plant produces small white flowers which can self-pollinate to produce small shiny-black drupes containing a single, large viable seed. The berry pulp is edible, with a sweet flavor.

==Distribution and habitat==
The tree is native to the Indian subcontinent. Commercial plantations have been established in India, and more recently Australia and South of Spain (Costa del Sol).

It grows best in well-drained soil that does not dry out, in areas with full sun or partial shade, preferably away from the wind. Growth is more robust when temperatures are at least .

==Etymology and common names==
The word &quot;curry&quot; is borrowed from the Tamil word &quot;kari&quot; (, literally &quot;blackened&quot;), the name of the plant associated with the perceived blackness of the tree&#x27;s leaves. The records of the leaves being utilized are found in Tamil literature dating back to the 1st and 4th centuries CE. Britain had spice trades with the ancient Tamil region. It was introduced to England in the late 16th century.. 

The species &quot;Bergera koenigii&quot; was first published by Carl Linnaeus in &quot;Mantissa Plantarum&quot; vol.2 on page 563 in 1767.
It was formerly known as &quot;Murraya koenigii&quot; , which was first published in Syst. Veg., ed. 16. 2: 315 in 1825. Some sources still recognise it as the accepted name.

The former generic name, &quot;Murraya&quot;, derives from Johan Andreas Murray (1740–1791), who studied botany under Carl Linnaeus and became a professor of medicine with an interest in medicinal plants at the University of Göttingen, Germany. The specific name, &quot;koenigii&quot;, derives from the last name of botanist Johann Gerhard König.

The curry tree is also called &quot;curry leaf tree&quot; or &quot;curry bush&quot;, among numerous local names, depending on the country.

It is known by a variety of names in the Indian subcontinent and South Asia itself. Some of its alternative names are:
*Hindi: करी/करीयापत्ता का पेड़ (&quot;kari/kariyāpattā ka peṛ&quot;)
*Punjabi: ਕਡੀ/ਕੜੀ ਪੱਤੀ ਦਾ ਰੁਖ (&quot;kaḍi/kaṛi patti dā rukh&quot;)
*Gujarati: મીઠો લીંબડો નુ બૃક્ષ/ઝાડ (&quot;miṭho limbḍo nu bruksh/jhāḍ&quot;)
*Marathi: कढीपानाचे/कढीलिंबाचे झाड (&quot;kaḍhīpānache /kaḍhīlimbāche jhāḍ&quot;)
*Bengali: করীফুুলীর/কারীপাতার গাছ (&quot;kariphulir /kāripātār gāchh&quot;) 
*Odia: ଭୃଷଙ୍ଗର/ଭୃଷମର ଗଛ (&quot;bhrusungara/bhrusamara gachha&quot;)
*Assamese: নৰসিংহৰ গাছ (&quot;narahingor gās&quot;)
*Nepali: करीपात को रूख (&quot;karipāt ko rūkh&quot;)
*Meitei: ꯀꯔꯤ ꯄꯥꯝꯕꯤ (&quot;kari pambi&quot;)
*Kannada: ಕರಿಬೇವಿನ ಮರ (&quot;karivēvina mara&quot;)
*Tamil: கறிவேப்பிலை மரம் (&quot;karivēppilai maram&quot;)
*Telugu: కరివేపాకు చెట్టు (&quot;karivēpāku cheṭṭu&quot;)
*Malayalam: കറിവേപ്പ് (&quot;karivēppu&quot;)
*Tulu: ಬೇವುಡಿರೇ ಮರ (&quot;bēvudirae mara&quot;)
*Sinhala: කරපිංච ගස (&quot;karapincha gasa&quot;)
*Burmese:ဟင်းရွက်သစ်ပင် (&quot;hainnrwat saitpain&quot;)

==Uses==
===Culinary===

The fresh leaves are an indispensable part of Indian cuisine and Indian traditional medicines. They are most widely used in southern and west coast Indian cooking, usually fried along with vegetable oil, mustard seeds and chopped onions in the first stage of the preparation. They are also used to make thoran, vada, rasam, and kadhi; additionally, they are often dry-roasted (and then ground) in the preparation of various powdered spice blends (masalas), such as South Indian sambar masala, the main seasoning in the ubiquitous vegetable stew sambar. The curry leaves are also added as flavoring to masala dosa, the South Indian potato-filled dosas, made with a mildly probiotic, fermented lentil and rice batter. The fresh leaves are valued as seasoning in the cuisines of South and Southeast Asia. In Cambodia, curry leaves (, ) are roasted and used as an ingredient for &quot;samlor machu kroeung&quot;. In Java, the leaves are often stewed to flavor &quot;gulai&quot;. Though available dried, the aroma and flavor are greatly inferior. In almost all cases, the leaves will be freshly plucked from a garden only a few hours or even minutes before they are used. The oil can be extracted and used to make scented soaps.

The leaves of &quot;Murraya koenigii&quot; are also used as a herb in Ayurvedic and Siddha medicine in which they are believed to possess anti-disease properties, but there is no high-quality clinical evidence for such effects.

The berries are edible, but the seeds may be toxic to humans.

==Propagation==
Seeds must be ripe and fresh to plant; dried or shriveled fruits are not viable. The skin must be peeled off, and this is recommended before planting. One can plant the whole fruit, but it is best to remove the pulp before planting in a potting mix that is kept moist but not wet. Stem cuttings can be also used for propagation. In the Indian Subcontinent, the plant is a fixture in almost every household. It is mainly planted privately, but also cultivated commercially to a small extent. Because the leaves must be fresh upon use, it is often traded through a small neighborhood or city wide network of farmers, who regularly supply fresh leaves to stall vendors.

==Chemical constituents==

Compounds found in curry tree leaves, stems, bark, and seeds include cinnamaldehyde, and numerous carbazole alkaloids, including mahanimbine, girinimbine, and mahanine.

Nutritionally, the leaves are a rich source of carotenoids, beta-carotene, calcium and iron.

<doc id="851853" wikidata="Q1210950" url="?curid=851853" title="Channel (geography)">
<text>In physical geography and hydrology, a channel is a landform on which a relatively narrow body of water is situated, such as a river, river delta or strait. While &quot;channel&quot; typically refers to a natural formation, the cognate term &quot;canal&quot; denotes a similar artificial structure.

Channels are important for the functionality of ports and other bodies of water used for navigability for shipping. Naturally, channels will change their depth and capacity due to erosion and deposition processes. Humans maintain navigable channels by dredging and other engineering processes.

By extension, the term also applies to fluids other than water, e.g., lava channels.
The term is also traditionally used to describe the waterless surface features on Venus.

==Formation==

Channel initiation refers to the site on a mountain slope where water begins to flow between identifiable banks. This site is referred to as the channel head and it marks an important boundary between hillslope processes and fluvial processes. The channel head is the most upslope part of a channel network and is defined by flowing water between defined identifiable banks. A channel head forms as overland flow and/or subsurface flow accumulate to a point where shear stress can overcome erosion resistance of the ground surface. Channel heads are often associated with colluvium, hollows and landslides.

Overland flow is a primary factor in channel initiation where saturation overland flow deepens to increase shear stress and begin channel incision. Overland flows converge in topographical depressions where channel initiation begins. Soil composition, vegetation, precipitation, and topography dictate the amount and rate of overland flow. The composition of a soil determines how quickly saturation occurs and cohesive strength retards the entrainment of material from overland flows. Vegetation slows infiltration rates during precipitation events and plant roots anchor soil on hillslopes.

Subsurface flow destabilizes soil and resurfaces on hillslopes where channel heads are often formed. This often results in abrupt channel heads and landslides. Hollows form due to concentrated subsurface flows where concentrations of colluvium are in a constant flux. Channel heads associated with hollows in steep terrain frequently migrate up and down hillslopes depending on sediment supply and precipitation.

==Natural channels==

Natural channels are formed by fluvial process and are found across the Earth. These are mostly formed by flowing water from the hydrological cycle, though can also be formed by other fluids such as flowing lava can form lava channels. Channels also describe the deeper course through a reef, sand bar, bay, or any shallow body of water. An example of a river running through a sand bar is the Columbia Bar—the mouth of the Columbia River.

A stream channel is the physical confine of a stream (river) consisting of a bed and stream banks.
Stream channels exist in a variety of geometries. Stream channel development is controlled by both water and sediment movement. There is a difference between low gradient streams (less than a couple of percent in gradient or slightly sloped) and high gradient streams (steeply sloped). A wide variety of stream channel types can be distinguished (e.g. braided rivers, wandering rivers, single-thread sinuous rivers etc.). During floods, water flow may exceed the capacity of the channel and flood waters will spill out of the channel and across the valley bottom, floodplain or drainage area.

Examples of rivers that are trapped in their channels: Grand Canyon and Black Canyon of the Gunnison.

In a larger nautical context, as a geographical place name, the term &quot;channel&quot; is another word for strait, which is defined as a relatively narrow body of water that connects two larger bodies of water. In this nautical context, the terms &quot;strait&quot;, &quot;channel&quot;, &quot;sound&quot;, and &quot;passage&quot; are synonymous and usually interchangeable. For example, in an archipelago, the water between islands is typically called a &quot;channel&quot; or &quot;passage&quot;. The English Channel is the strait between England and France.

==Waterflow channels==
The channel form is described in terms of geometry (plan, cross-sections, profile) enclosed by the materials of its bed and banks. This form is under influence of two major forces: water discharge and sediment supply. For erodible channels the mutual dependence of its parameters may be qualitatively described by Lane&#x27;s Principle (also known as Lane&#x27;s relationship): the product of the sediment load and bed Bukhara size is proportional to the product of discharge and channel slope.

==Nautical channels==

A term &quot;navigable channel&quot; is used as a nautical term to mean a lane for ship travel, frequently marked (cf. Buoy) and sometimes dredged. Thoresen distinguishes few categories of channels, from A (suitable for day and night navigation with guaranteed fairway depth) all the way to D with no navigational aids and only estimated depths provided to the shipmaster. With regard to the dredging, channels can be &quot;unrestricted&quot; (wide enough to accommodate 10 to 15 widths of a largest ship used in this channel, &quot;semi-restricted&quot; with limited dredging in shallow waters, and &quot;fully restricted&quot;, where the entire channel is dredged. The latter, entirely human-made, channel is frequently called a &quot;canal&quot;, with the Panama Canal providing an example.

The term not only includes the deep-dredged ship-navigable parts of an estuary or river leading to port facilities, but also to lesser channels accessing boat port-facilities such as marinas. When dredged channels traverse bay mud or sandy bottoms, repeated dredging is often necessary because of the unstable subsequent movement of benthic soils.

Responsibility for monitoring navigability conditions of &quot;navigation channels&quot; to various port facilities varies, and the actual maintenance work is frequently performed by a third party. Storms, sea-states, flooding, and seasonal sedimentation adversely affect navigability. In the U.S., navigation channels are monitored and maintained by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), although dredging operations are often carried out by private contractors (under USACE supervision). USACE also monitors water quality and some remediation. This was first established under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and modified under acts of 1913, 1935, and 1938. For example, the USACE developed the Intracoastal Waterway, and has the Mississippi Valley Division responsible for the Mississippi River from the Gulf to Cairo, Illinois, the North Atlantic Division for New York Harbor and Port of Boston, and the South Pacific Division for Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach. Waterways policing as well as some emergency spill response falls under United States Coast Guard jurisdiction, including inland channels serving ports like Saint Louis hundreds of miles from any coast. The various state or local governments maintain lesser channels, for example former Erie Canal.

<doc id="851862" wikidata="Q16955720" url="?curid=851862" title="Delivery versus payment">
<text>Delivery versus payment or DvP is a common form of settlement for securities. The process involves the simultaneous delivery of all documents necessary to give effect to a transfer of securities in exchange for the receipt of the stipulated payment amount. Alternatively, it may involve transfers of two securities in such a way as to ensure that delivery of one security occurs if and only if the corresponding delivery of the other security occurs.

This is done to avoid settlement risk such as where one party fails to deliver the security when the other party has already delivered the cash when settling a securities trade.

==History==
The market crash of October 1987 drew global attention to potential weaknesses in the standards applied for clearance and settlement. Numerous studies resulted, among which was one from the Group of Thirty which pioneered standards for providers of securities settlement services. The report included nine recommendations, one of which was that &quot;Delivery versus payment (DvP) should be the method for settling all securities transactions with systems in place by 1992.&quot;

In December 1990, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS), consisting of representatives from the major central banks, initiated further study of DVP. Its report in September 1992 found three ways of achieving DvP:
# Transfer of securities and funds done on a trade-by-trade basis, with final transfer of securities occurring at the same time as the final transfer of funds;
# Transfer of securities on a gross basis, with final transfer of securities occurring throughout the day, but funds transfer on a net basis at the end of the day;
# Transfer of both securities and funds on a net basis, with final transfers occurring at the end of the day.

==Operational perspective==
From an operational perspective DVP is a sale transaction of negotiable securities (in exchange for cash payment) that can be instructed to a settlement agent using SWIFT Message Type MT 543 (in the ISO15022 standard). Use of such standard message types is intended to reduce risk in the settlement of a financial transaction, and enable automatic processing. Ideally, title to an asset and payment are exchanged simultaneously. This may be possible in many cases such as in a central depository system such as the United States Depository Trust Corporation.

==Non-DvP==

Non-DvP settlement processes typically expose the parties to settlement risk. They are known by a variety of names, including &quot;free delivery&quot;, &quot;free of payment&quot; or &quot;FOP&quot; delivery, or in the United States, &quot;delivery versus free&quot;. FOP settlement involves delivery of the securities without a simultaneous transfer of funds – hence &#x27;free of payment&#x27;. Funds may either be remitted by other, mutually agreed means, or payment may not be made at all. This is the case in the transfer of securities gifted or inherited, or, in a country retaining paper securities certificates, in the dematerialisation of such securities, by transfer FOP into the name of the electronic custodian, with beneficial ownership retained by the transferor.

<doc id="851866" wikidata="Q5455349" url="?curid=851866" title="A Fistful of TOWs">
<text>A Fistful of TOWs, often abbreviated FFT, is a series of modern warfare miniatures wargame rules first published in 2000. The first edition was self-published, subsequent editions were published by Fistful of Games.

==Description==
&quot;A Fistful of TOWs&quot; – TOW stands for &quot;tube-launched, optically tracked, wire-guided missiles&quot; — is a set of rules designed for wargames with 6 mm miniatures at a scale of either 1&quot; = 100 metres or 1 cm = 100 metres. The rules for modern combat have specifically been designed to provide relatively fast play.

Unlike boxed set wargames like &quot;Panzergruppe Guderian&quot; or &quot;War in Europe&quot; that include a map, counters and set of rules focussed on a particular conflict or series of conflicts, &quot;FFT&quot; is not designed for specific battles or conflicts. Instead the generic rules outline how combat and movement happen in any scenario — including airborne and amphibious assaults, airstrikes, and chemical weapons — and provide statistics on various army units, vehicles, tanks, and aircraft as well as army lists so that players can design their own scenarios for any modern conflict.

The much-expanded third edition includes 96 pages of army lists including:
*World War II lists for German, American, British, French, and Polish units. 
* American army from the Korean War to present 
* Russian Army from 1970 to 2015
* most NATO armies in the 1980s-1990s
* Arab-Israeli units involved in the Six-Day War and the Yom Kippur War
* Australian units 1966–2015 
* North Vietnam/Vietcong during American involvement in the Vietnam War from 1964 to 1973 
In addition to core and supplemental rules, the third edition also includes 128 pages of data for armaments, armored vehicles, artillery, and aircraft from the First World War to the present.

This gives players the ability to design scenarios for almost any historical global conflict of the twentieth century. These rules have become popular for designing modern conflict scenarios in time-limited settings such as wargaming conventions. &quot;FFT&quot; has also been used by Rand Corporation in developing modern wargaming concepts for the U.S. Department of Defense.

===Gameplay===
Each turn, which covers 5–7 minutes of game time, uses an &quot;I Go, You Go&quot; (IGOUGO) format where one player moves and fires, then the other player has the same opportunities.

===Movement===
Each unit can either move normally or strategically (double movement). A unit that moves strategically cannot participate in combat during the rest of that turn, and defensively is more vulnerable.

===Combat===
For ranged combat, the active player chooses a target at which to fire, and rolls a number of six-sided dice equal to the Rate of Fire of the attacking unit. The die roll required is equal to the range rating of the attacker&#x27;s weapon. Depending on terrain, the target may get a saving throw to negate the attack.

During close combat, the same rules are used, but the defender fires first. If the attacker survives, the attacker returns fire. This continues until either the attacker or defender has been destroyed.

==Publication history==
In the late 1990s, Ty Beard became frustrated with slow-moving wargames. After a particularly trying session of &quot;Combined Arms&quot; — a miniatures wargame published by Games Designers Workshop — in which only four turns were completed in 8 hours, Beard decided to design a streamlined system to produce faster-moving games. The result was a set of rules for modern combat titled &quot;A Fistful of TOWs&quot;, a coil-bound paperback self-published in 2000 written by Beard with contributions by Dave Burnett, Paul Minson, and Bob Mackenzie. In 2010, Fistful of Games released a second edition of the rules, a 204-page coil-bound softcover book written by Ty Beard that expanded the timeline of the rules back as far as 1946.

In 2011, Fistful of Games released a greatly-expanded 458-page third edition written by Ty Beard and Paul Minson that expanded the timeline back to 1915.

Future planned additions to the series are &quot;FFT:2030&quot;, covering the hypothetical wars of the mid-21st century, and &quot;Railgun: 2100&quot;, covering science fiction armored combat.

==Reception==
Mark Severin thought that despite the length of the second edition, the rules were &quot;easy to read and very well presented.&quot; He also liked the executive summary included with each chapter and the detailed table of contents.

In 2020, researchers at Rand Corporation looked for a commercial wargame that would serve their combat simulation research purposes and wrote that &quot;Ground combat experts on the research team determined that &quot;FFT3&quot; represented ground combat at the required level of granularity to allow our research team to simulate [remotely operated] and fully autonomous combat vehicles.&quot; The authors concluded that they were able to obtain the research results they needed using &quot;FFT3&quot;, saying, &quot;Using the &quot;FFT3&quot; commercial wargame as a basis, the researchers demonstrated how postulated [artificial intelligence and machine learning] capabilities could be incorporated into a tactical ground combat wargame.&quot;

<text>The Book of One Hundred Chapters, also called Stoglav (&quot;Стоглав&quot;) in Russian (&quot;Hundred chapters&quot;), is a collection of decisions of the Russian church council of 1551 that regulated the canon law and ecclesiastical life in the Tsardom of Russia, especially the everyday life of the Russian clergy.

The book is shaped in the form of answers to some 100 questions posed by Ivan IV of Russia. A constant theme running through the chapters is the Byzantine &quot;symphonia&quot; (harmony) between the &#x27;priesthood&#x27; and the &#x27;kingdom&#x27;. 

The &quot;Book of Hundred Chapters&quot; canonized the native Muscovite rituals and practices at the expense of those accepted in Greece and other Eastern Orthodox countries. As a result this church code was never accepted by the Russian monks residing on Mount Athos.

In the mid-17th century, the Old Believers championed the &quot;Stoglav&quot; in order to undermine Patriarch Nikon&#x27;s authority and his ecclesiastical reforms. The Great Moscow Synod of 1667 condemned the &quot;Stoglav&quot; and its practices as heretical and banned the book from usage for 200 years. This contributed to a great schism of the Russian church known as the Raskol.

There are at least 100 manuscripts of the &quot;Stoglav&quot;, all of them produced by the Old Believers. The official church historians of the 18th and 19th centuries (such as Platon Levshin) discarded these texts as spurious. Their authenticity was reasserted by historian Ivan Belyayev in 1863.

<text>Non-DVP trading is defined as securities trading where a client&#x27;s custodian will have to release payment or deliver securities on behalf of the client before there is certainty that it will receive the counter-value in cash or securities, thus incurring settlement risk.

DVP stands for delivery versus payment. A party to a transaction pays for something when it is delivered. When there is a delivery from A to B, delivery is made by A, receipt is had by B. B, the party that receives, is obliged to make a payment.

The issue revolves around:
# the timing of the transaction
# the value of the transaction, and
# the trustworthiness of A and B.

The ideal situation is timing is matched for delivery/receipt and payment without any lag or deferral. If A and B had previous dealings and are completely trustworthy, then they may not mind delay of one or two working days. Whereas if trust has not been established, delay of one hour means the transaction is non-DVP. In terms of value, the larger the value, the greater the urgency for everything to be completely wrapped up.

Note: Whenever there is a delivery, there is a receipt; also known as non-RVP (non-Receipt versus payment).

<text>Henry Christopher McCook (July 3, 1837 – 1911) was an American Presbyterian clergyman, naturalist, and prolific author on religion, history, and nature. He was a member of the celebrated Fighting McCooks, a family of Ohio military officers and volunteers during the American Civil War.

==Life and work==
McCook was born in New Lisbon, Ohio, to Dr. John McCook and Julia Sheldon McCook. He learned the printing trade as a youth, then taught school for several years. attended Jefferson College. He was a member of the Franklin Literary Society and founded the chapter of Theta Delta Chi at Jefferson College. After graduation in 1859, he studied theology privately and in the Western Theological Seminary in Allegheny, Pennsylvania. With the outbreak of the Civil War, he enlisted in the 41st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment as a chaplain with the rank of first lieutenant, and helped tend the wounded. As a minister in Clinton, Illinois, St. Louis, and Steubenville, Ohio, McCook became known for his compassion and intellect, and for his leadership in the movement to create Sunday Schools. In 1869, he became pastor of the Seventh Presbyterian church of Philadelphia, where he lived for the rest of his life.

He spent his summers studying the behavior of ants and spiders. He published his observations and discoveries in a number of journals and books, as well as in a series of well-received illustrated children&#x27;s books that explained the insects characteristics and traits in language and drawings for young minds. Many of McCook&#x27;s books used illustrations drawn by Daniel Carter Beard, the founder of the Boy Scouts of America.

In the summer of 1877, he travelled to Texas to study agricultural ants. Two years later, McCook wrote &quot;The Natural History of the Agricultural Ant of Texas&quot;. In 1889–93, he published his most ambitious work, &quot;American Spiders and Their Spinning Work&quot;, in three illustrated volumes. He also wrote a book on his ancestors in the Whiskey Rebellion, and delivered a number of papers on Civil War history at meetings of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States veterans organization.

McCook was Vice President of both the American Entomological Society and the Academy of Natural Sciences. In 1880, Lafayette College conferred the degree of Doctor of Divinity to McCook. In 1895, he designed the official flag of the city of Philadelphia. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1896. He again served as an Army Chaplain during the Spanish–American War in 1898.

<text>Felix Santschi (1 December 1872 – 20 November 1940) was a Swiss entomologist known for discovering that ants use the sun as a compass and for describing about 2000 taxa of ants.

Santschi is known for his pioneering work on the navigational abilities of ants. In one experiment, he investigated the way harvester ants used the sky to navigate. He found that as long as even a small patch of sky was visible, the ants could return directly to the nest after gathering food. However, when the sky was completely hidden, they lost their sense of direction and began moving haphazardly. Some seventy years later it was shown that ants are guided by the polarization of light.

<doc id="851895" wikidata="Q1126800" url="?curid=851895" title="The Strand Magazine">
<text>The Strand Magazine was a monthly British magazine founded by George Newnes, composed of short fiction and general interest articles. It was published in the United Kingdom from January 1891 to March 1950, running to 711 issues, though the first issue was on sale well before Christmas 1890.
Its immediate popularity is evidenced by an initial sale of nearly 300,000. Sales increased in the early months, before settling down to a circulation of almost 500,000 copies a month, which lasted well into the 1930s.

It was edited by Herbert Greenhough Smith from 1891 to 1930. The popularity of Sherlock Holmes became widespread after first appearing in the magazine in 1891. The magazine&#x27;s original offices were on Burleigh Street off The Strand, London. It was revived in 1998 as a quarterly magazine.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; was founded by George Newnes in 1890, and its first edition was dated January 1891. The magazine&#x27;s original offices were located on Burleigh Street, off the Strand, London. The first editor was Herbert Greenhough Smith, who remained the editor until 1930. The magazine published factual articles in addition to fictional short stories and series. It was targeted at a mass market readership. The initial price of an issue was sixpence, about half the typical rate for comparable titles at the time. Initial sales were around 300,000, and circulation soon rose to half a million.

The magazine also published a United States edition from February 1891 through February 1916. In its early years, the contents of the US edition were identical with those of the UK edition, though usually with a one-month time lag. As the years went on there were some differences in the contents of the two editions, reflecting fiction for which &quot;The Strand&quot; did not hold the US rights (such as &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was commissioned by &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine) and non-fiction that would not interest most US readers (such as articles about personalities in the House of Commons). The circulation of the US edition was minimal in the early 1890s but was reported at 150,000 by 1898. The US edition was discontinued in 1916 due to logistical difficulties arising from World War I. The American edition was edited by J. Walter Smith.

The magazine format changed to the smaller digest size in October 1941. &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; ceased publication in March 1950, forced out of the market by declining circulation and rising costs. Its last editor was Macdonald Hastings, distinguished war correspondent and later TV reporter and contributor to the &quot;Eagle&quot; boys&#x27; comic. In 1961, the magazine was briefly revived as &quot;The New Strand&quot; under the editorship of Noni Jabavu.

It was normally bound as six-monthly volumes, from January to June and July to December, but from the mid-1930s this varied, and the final volumes in the late 1940s ran from October to March and April to September, the final volume CXVIII (118) running from October 1949 to March 1950.

The magazine was revived in 1998 in the US (see below).

==Fiction==
The Sherlock Holmes short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle were first published in &quot;The Strand&quot; in the UK. Some of the stories were previously or simultaneously published in US magazines, while several were first published in the United States in the US edition of &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; a month after being published in the UK edition. 38 of the Sherlock Holmes stories, including &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;, were illustrated by Sidney Paget in &quot;The Strand&quot;. Paget&#x27;s illustrations helped form the popular image of Holmes. With the serialisation of Doyle&#x27;s &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;, sales reached their peak. Readers lined up outside the magazine&#x27;s offices, waiting to get the next installment. Doyle also wrote other stories that were published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;.

A number of short stories by Agatha Christie were first published in &quot;The Strand&quot; in the UK, such as the Hercule Poirot stories collected in &quot;The Labours of Hercules&quot;. Many short stories by P. G. Wodehouse, including most of Wodehouse&#x27;s Jeeves short stories, were first published in &quot;The Strand&quot; in the UK (some were published earlier or in the same month in US magazines).

Other contributors included E. W. Hornung, Graham Greene, Rudyard Kipling, W. Somerset Maugham, E. Nesbit, Dorothy L. Sayers, Georges Simenon, Leo Tolstoy, and H. G. Wells, as well as Grant Allen, Margery Allingham, H. C. McNeile (aka Sapper), J. E. Preston Muddock, E. C. Bentley, Mary Angela Dickens, C. B. Fry, Walter Goodman, W. W. Jacobs, Arthur Morrison, Edgar Wallace, Max Beerbohm and Dornford Yates.

==Puzzles and non-fiction==
In addition to the many fiction pieces and illustrations, &quot;The Strand&quot; has been also known for some time as the source of ground-breaking brain teasers, under a column called &quot;Perplexities&quot;, first written by Henry Dudeney. Dudeney introduced many new concepts to the puzzle world, including the first known crossnumber puzzle, in 1926. In that same year, Dudeney produced an article, &quot;The Psychology of Puzzle Crazes&quot;, reflecting and analysing the demand for such works. He edited Perplexities from 1910 until he died in 1930. G. H. Savage became the column&#x27;s editor, soon to be joined by William Thomas Williams (as W. T. Williams), who in 1935 authored the best-known cross-figure puzzle of today. The puzzle goes by many names, the original being &quot;The Little Pigley Farm&quot;. It has also been known as &quot;Dog&#x27;s Mead&quot;, &quot;Little Pigley&quot;, &quot;Little Piggly Farm&quot;, &quot;Little Pigsby&quot;, &quot;Pilgrims&#x27; Plot&quot;, and &quot;Dog Days&quot;.

Some articles by Winston Churchill were published in the magazine. Once a sketch drawn by Queen Victoria of one of her children appeared with her permission. Early issues of the magazine featured non-fiction articles about features and institutions of London, such as the Fire Brigade, the River Police or the veterinary college.

==Cover==
The magazine&#x27;s iconic cover, an illustration looking eastwards down London&#x27;s Strand towards St Mary-le-Strand, with the title suspended on telegraph wires, was the work of Victorian artist and designer George Charles Haité. The initial cover featured a corner plaque showing the name of Burleigh Street, home to the magazine&#x27;s original offices. The lettering on the plaque in Haité&#x27;s design was later changed when Newnes moved to the adjacent address of Southampton Street. A variation of the same design was featured on the cover of a sister title, &quot;The Strand Musical Magazine&quot;.

==1998 revival==
&quot;The Strand&quot; was brought back into publication in 1998 as a quarterly magazine, now based in Birmingham, Michigan, US. It has published fiction by many well-known writers including John Mortimer, Ray Bradbury, Alexander McCall Smith, Ruth Rendell, Colin Dexter, Edward Hoch, James Grippando, and Tennessee Williams. The magazine features stories from emerging crime and mystery writers in addition to stories by established writers.

<doc id="851897" wikidata="Q7830956" url="?curid=851897" title="Toys Went Berserk">
<text>Toys Went Berserk were an Australian post-punk band that formed in late 1985. They released two studio albums, &quot;The Smiler with a Knife&quot; (1989) and &quot;Sensory&quot; (1990), before disbanding in early 1992. They subsequently reformed in 1998, 2005 and 2016.

== History ==
Toys Went Berserk were formed in Sydney in December 1985 by Lesley-Anne &quot;Coo&quot; Bennett on lead vocals and piano (ex-Lavender Disaster), Andy Jarvis on guitar (ex-Dusk Furrow), Mark Nicholson on drums (ex-Happy Hate Me Nots), Bill Quarry on bass guitar (ex-Box of Fish), and Steve Turbit on guitar. Lavender Disaster were a Perth-based band with Coo Bennett on lead vocals, Brett Ford on drums, Peter Hartley on guitar and Danny Vervest on bass. Both Ford and Hartley were later members of the Kryptonics and Lubricated Goat. Bruce Griffiths told Steve Gardner of &quot;Noise for Heroes&quot; that the group, &quot;sounded like a &#x27;tough Blondie&#x27;.&quot;

According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, Toys Went Berserk &quot;derived [their] moniker from a lyric line in the Siouxsie and the Banshees song &#x27;Spellbound&#x27;.&quot; They provided energetic live performances and their music (comparable to bands such as Skeletal Family, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Xmal Deutschland), which was quite distinctive in the Sydney scene of the time. Gardner opined, &quot;They aren&#x27;t like the standard Sydney band, influenced by Detroit music, &#x27;Burn My Eye&#x27; T-shirt on back, stacks of Marshalls behind them. They have other influences. As opposed to big distorted power chords or strong leads, the guitar tends to be more in the way of textured, treated chords; very echo-ey. The drumming is inventive yet driving, with many interesting touches to add spice to standard beats. The bass tends to be mixed back, while Coo&#x27;s vocal provide a large part of the character and melody to the songs.&quot;

The group&#x27;s first recorded track, &quot;One Day (My Head Is Going to Explode)&quot;, appeared on a various artists&#x27; four-track extended play, &quot;Trousers in Action No. 2&quot; (August 1986), via Aberrant Records. It was previously performed by Lavender Disaster and was written by Coo&#x27;s brother Phil Bennett; it was recorded at Sound Barrier studios in June with Jonathan Summers as audio engineer. This was followed by their debut single, &quot;Guns at My Head&quot; (October), which had been recorded at the same session as &quot;One Day&quot; and in early 1987 by an 8 song double 12&quot; EP &quot;Pieces&quot;, also recorded at Sound Barrier. In June 1987 Turbit was replaced briefly on guitar by Carolyn Polley.

Toys Went Berserk issued their first full-length studio album, &quot;The Smiler with a Knife&quot;, on 7 November 1989 with Rob Younger (Died Pretty, Dubrovniks, The Plunderers) producing at Trafalgar Studios in June and July of that year. Gardner felt, &quot;[it] features the sort of clear and solid sound that he&#x27;s becoming famous for. Yet the band had a lot of misgivings about using him at first; they are not at all interested in the Detroit sound, and they associated Younger with that through his Birdman past. And although the new lp certainly isn&#x27;t a Detroit metal record, there&#x27;s no question it has a tougher, more immediate sound.&quot;

Before the album was recorded Polley had left to join indie rockers Big Heavy Stuff and Toys Went Berserk continued as a four-piece. They released numerous records, including six singles and three albums (two on vinyl and one CD), and toured in the United States and Australia. Their goth-influenced version of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; was featured on Andrew Denton&#x27;s ABC-TV program, &quot;The Money or the Gun&quot;, and was later released on a various artists compilation album, &quot;Stairways to Heaven&quot; (1993).

The band recorded their second studio album, &quot;Sensory&quot;(1990), at Fort Apache Studios, near Boston, with Gary Smith (Throwing Muses, Pixies, the Chills) in August. They returned to the US in the following year to tour. They have supported international acts the Cramps, the Sugarcubes, the Fall, Dinosaur Jr. and the Selector during their six-year lifetime. Toys Went Berserk split in early 1992.

== Afterwards ==
Following the break-up of Toys Went Berserk, Bennett and Jarvis, who were domestic partners, moved to England and started new bands, Feast (1993–98) and then Houdini (1998–2001). In late 2003 they returned to Perth to start their own record label, Trickster Music and released an album as Houdini Twins. Toys Went Berserk have regrouped for reunion shows: firstly in 1998, then in 2005, to promote the release of a compilation double album, &quot;The Bitter &amp; the Sweet: Best and Rarest&quot;. It included most of their studio releases, plus selected demos and live recordings. In 2016 the band performed a joint 30th anniversary show in Sydney, with contemporaries, Ratcat.

Bennett and Jarvis continued in other Perth-based outfits, Rocket to Memphis (RTM) and Catzilla. RTM released four CDs of swamp, rockabilly and garage rock n roll music, &quot;Swampwater Shuffle&quot; (2007), &quot;Hip-Shakin&#x27; Voodoo&quot; (2009), &quot;Jungle Juice&quot; (2011) and &quot;Do the Crawl&quot; (2013) and two vinyl singles, &quot;I&#x27;m Bad&quot; (2011) and &quot;Go Go&quot; (2013), and toured both Japan and the United Kingdom. Catzilla play garage rock n roll, featuring Bennett on vocals and keyboards and Jarvis on guitar. They released a vinyl EP, &quot;Going Wild&quot; (2016), a self-titled album in 2017 and have also toured Japan.

<text>Emil &quot;Ehm&quot; Welk (August 29, 1884 – December 19, 1966) was a German journalist, writer, professor and founder of &quot;Volkshochschulen&quot; (adult education centres). He became known for his work &quot;Die Heiden von Kummerow&quot; (&quot;The Heathens of Kummerow&quot;) and used Thomas Trimm as a pseudonym.

==Life==
Welk was born as the son of a farmer in Biesenbrow (now part of Angermünde), Brandenburg. After frequenting the village school, the 16-year-old moved away from home, completed a commercial education, worked on the sea and as a journalist for several papers, e.g. in Brunswick for the &quot;Braunschweiger Allgemeiner Anzeiger&quot;, whose editor-in-chief he was from 1910 on to 1919. Afterwards, he worked for the &quot;Braunschweiger Morgenzeitung&quot;.

During these times, Welk experienced the German Revolution in Brunswick. His experiences later built the background for the novel &quot;Im Morgennebel&quot;, that describes true Brunswick events and people of these times in a not much encrypted way. This novel&#x27;s manuscript, that employed Welk for a long time, was already finished in 1940 but not published until 1953 in East Germany

In 1922 Welk traveled to the United States and Latin America. One year later, he went back to Weimar Germany and worked as a writer and journalist, mainly in Berlin and neighbourhood. Two revolutionary dramas, &quot;Gewitter über Gotland&quot; (1926) and &quot;Kreuzabnahme&quot; (1927), caused scandals and had to be taken out of the theatres&#x27; repertoires – despite their popular success.

In 1934, one year after Hitler&#x27;s Machtergreifung, Welk, under the pseudonym Thomas Trimm, wrote an open letter in the &quot;Grüne Post&quot; titled &quot;Auf ein Wort, Herr Minister&quot;, in which he criticised Nazi press censorship under Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. The writer was then arrested and imprisoned in KZ Oranienburg for a short while. After his discharge (that was mainly due to protests by foreign journalists), he was banned from his profession.

In 1935, Welk settled in the Spreewald with his wife Agathe Lindner, who was also a writer;
she is known for her novel &quot;Juliane Wied&quot; and was together with Welk from 1924 until his death.
Despite the ban, Welk began writing again, but only wrote – seemingly – &quot;unpolitical books&quot;. In this era, his successful novels &quot;Die Heiden von Kummerow&quot; (1937), &quot;Die Lebensuhr des Gottlieb Grambauer&quot; (1938), and &quot;Die Gerechten von Kummerow&quot; (1943) were born. These novels described life in northern Germany&#x27;s villages in a humorous way. It is supposed today that the character Martin Grambauer wears autobiographical traces of his author, while Gottlieb Grambauer is a tribute to the author&#x27;s father.

After 1945, Welk ceased his literary work for a few years. He stayed in East Germany and founded six &quot;Volkshochschulen&quot; (adult education centres) in Mecklenburg. In 1946, he became director of a Volkshochschule in Schwerin.

In 1950, Welk moved to Bad Doberan and began with writing again. He received several awards of the GDR (e.g. the Nationalpreis in 1954), and became an honorary citizen of the towns Bad Doberan and Angermünde. At the University of Greifswald, he became an honorary doctor in 1956 and professor of the philosophy faculty in 1964.

Welk died in 1966 in Bad Doberan.

==Censorship==
Before World War II, Welk was often compared with the &quot;hunger priest&quot; Wilhelm Raabe and with Gustav Freytag. In the GDR &quot;Die Heiden von Kummerow&quot; and &quot;Die Gerechten von Kummerow&quot; were his most popular works; they were seen as a German pendant to Guareschi&#x27;s narrations about &quot;Don Camillo and Peppone&quot;. The film &quot;Die Heiden von Kummerow und ihre lustigen Streiche&quot; was, in 1967, one of the rare co-productions of the GDR and West Germany. DEFA made another movie of the book in 1982. The rest of Welk&#x27;s works were republished by the GDR after his death, but some of them were modified deeply. It is not clear whether Welk wanted to remove Nazi-adopted text or censored himself because of being influenced by upcoming new dictatorship or GDR editors made modifications. Compared to the first edition of &quot;Die Heiden von Kummerow&quot;, for instance, later releases were anti-military in nature. Several words (&quot;König&quot; instead of &quot;General&quot;, &quot;hottentotisch&quot; instead of &quot;polnisch&quot;) were changed, as were contents and motives. Christian and biblical elements were replaced by belief in revolution and class conflict. For instance, Krischan&#x27;s humbleness when he is banished from the village is not Christian anymore, but self-accusing: he accuses himself of not having supported the revolt of the seamen.

<doc id="851903" wikidata="Q374754" url="?curid=851903" title="Carter Burwell">
<text>Carter Benedict Burwell (born November 18, 1954) is an American film composer. He has frequently collaborated with the Coen brothers, having scored most of their films. He has also scored films by other directors such as Bill Condon, Todd Haynes, Spike Jonze, Martin McDonagh, James Foley, Brian Helgeland, and John Lee Hancock. Burwell received Academy Award nominations for Best Original Score for Haynes&#x27;s &quot;Carol&quot; (2015) and McDonagh&#x27;s films &quot;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&quot; (2017), and &quot;The Banshees Of Inisherin&quot; (2022).

==Early life and education==
Burwell was born in New York City, the son of Natalie (née Benedict), a math teacher, and Charles Burwell, who founded Thaibok Fabrics, Ltd. He graduated from King School in Stamford, Connecticut with George Hofecker and other notables and Harvard College, where he was a cartoonist for &quot;The Harvard Lampoon&quot;.

==Career==
As a film composer, Burwell has had a long-working relationship with the Coen brothers, providing music for every film they have made (except for &quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot; and &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;). Among his best known film scores are &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot; (1990), &quot;And the Band Played On&quot; (1993), &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; (1997), &quot;Hamlet&quot; (2000), &quot;The Spanish Prisoner&quot; (1997), &quot;Before the Devil Knows You&#x27;re Dead&quot; (2007), &quot;In Bruges&quot; (2008), &quot;Twilight&quot; (2008), &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; (2009), &quot;The Blind Side&quot; (2009), and &quot;Breaking Dawn - Part 1&quot; (2011) and &quot;Part 2&quot; (2012). Burwell wrote and recorded the original score for the film &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;, but director Doug Liman wanted something else and replaced it with a score by John Powell.

The ethos of the punk rock movement gave Burwell the impetus to start performing. He performed in New York with several bands, notably The Same, Thick Pigeon, and Radiante. Burwell played in Thick Pigeon with Stanton Miranda; the group released two albums, &quot;Too Crazy Cowboys&quot; (Factory) and tracks on &quot;Miranda Dali&quot; (Crepuscule), originally released as a Miranda solo project but later reissued as a Thick Pigeon release. On Burwell&#x27;s soundtrack for &quot;Psycho III&quot;, Miranda was a featured singer.

By 1986 he had composed the music for a dance piece, RAB, which premiered at the Avignon Festival. At the same time, he was touring worldwide with The Harmonic Choir, David Hykes&#x27; experimental vocal group, which specialized in overtone singing.

Burwell used the country music genre as the basis for his score for the Coens&#x27; &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; in 1987. From 1982 to 1987 he worked at the New York Institute of Technology.

His work has alternated between live performance, dance and theater commissions, and film scoring. His chamber opera, &quot;The Celestial Alphabet Event,&quot; was presented in New York in 1991, and other theater pieces include &quot;Mother&quot; (1994) and &quot;Lucia&#x27;s Chapters&quot; (2007), both with the experimental theater group Mabou Mines.

In April 2005, Burwell composed and conducted music performed by The Parabola Ensemble for the plays &quot;Sawbones,&quot; written and directed by the Coen brothers, &quot;Hope Leaves the Theater,&quot; written and directed by Charlie Kaufman, and &quot;Anomalisa,&quot; written and directed by Kaufman as Francis Fregoli. This was a segment of the sound-only production &quot;Theater of the New Ear&quot;, which debuted at St. Ann&#x27;s Warehouse in Brooklyn, New York, with support from Sirius Satellite Radio. It was also performed at the Royal Festival Hall in London, England, in May 2005, and at Royce Hall in Los Angeles, California, in September 2005, as part of the UCLA Live Festival.

In 2009, Burwell was the recipient of the ASCAP Henry Mancini Award from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. In 2010, he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score for &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;.

In 2015, he received the Distinguished Film Composer award from the Middleburg Film Festival, and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association award for Best Music Score for &quot;Anomalisa&quot; and &quot;Carol&quot;. He was nominated for the Annie Award for Music in an Animated Feature Production for &quot;Anomalisa&quot; and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score for &quot;Carol&quot;. In 2016, he received the Satellite Award for Best Original Score and the Best Score award by the International Cinephile Society for &quot;Carol&quot;. Burwell was awarded Film Composer of the Year by the World Soundtrack Awards, and the score for &quot;Carol&quot; received the Public Choice Award for the Best Score of the Year.

Burwell received his first Academy Award for Best Original Score nomination for &quot;Carol&quot;, his second for &quot;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&quot;, and his third for &quot;The Banshees Of Inisherin &quot;.

==Personal life==
Burwell married Christine Sciulli in 1999.

Since 2009, Burwell has lived in Napeague, New York.

<text>Ai-Khanoum (, meaning &#x27;Lady Moon&#x27;; ) is the archaeological site of a Hellenistic city in Takhar Province, Afghanistan. The city, whose original name is unknown, was likely founded by an early ruler of the Seleucid Empire and served as a military and economic centre for the rulers of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom until its destruction  BC. Rediscovered in 1961, the ruins of the city were excavated by a French team of archaeologists until the outbreak of conflict in Afghanistan in the late 1970s.

The city was probably founded between 300 and 285 BC by an official acting on the orders of Seleucus I Nicator or his son Antiochus I Soter, the first two rulers of the Seleucid dynasty. There is a possibility that the site was known to the earlier Achaemenid Empire, who established a small fort nearby. Ai-Khanoum was originally thought to have been a foundation of Alexander the Great, perhaps as Alexandria Oxiana, but this theory is now considered unlikely. Located at the confluence of the Amu Darya ( Oxus) and Kokcha rivers, surrounded by well-irrigated farmland, the city itself was divided between a lower town and a acropolis. Although not situated on a major trade route, Ai-Khanoum controlled access to both mining in the Hindu Kush and strategically important choke points. Extensive fortifications, which were continually maintained and improved, surrounded the city.

Ai-Khanoum, which may have initially grown in population because of royal patronage and the presence of a mint in the city, lost some importance through the secession of the Greco-Bactrians under Diodotus I ( BC). Seleucid construction programmes were halted and the city probably became primarily military in function; it may have been a conflict zone during the invasion of Antiochus III ( BC). Ai-Khanoum began to grow once more under Euthydemus I and his successor Demetrius I, who began to assert control over the northwest Indian subcontinent. Many of the present ruins date from the time of Eucratides I, who substantially redeveloped the city and who may have renamed it Eucratideia, after himself. Soon after his death  BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom collapsed—Ai-Khanoum was captured by Saka invaders and was generally abandoned, although parts of the city were sporadically occupied until the 2nd century AD. Hellenistic culture in the region would persist longer only in the Indo-Greek kingdoms.

While on a hunting trip in 1961, the King of Afghanistan, Mohammed Zahir Shah, rediscovered the city. An archaeological delegation, led by Paul Bernard, unearthed the remains of a huge palace in the lower town, along with a large gymnasium, a theatre capable of holding 6,000 spectators, an arsenal, and two sanctuaries. Several inscriptions were found, along with coins, artefacts, and ceramics. The onset of the Soviet-Afghan War in the late 1970s halted scholarly progress and during the following conflicts in Afghanistan, the site was extensively looted.
== History ==

=== Ancient ===
The precise date of Ai-Khanoum&#x27;s founding is unknown. The northernmost outpost of the Indus Valley Civilization had been established at Shortugai, around north of Ai-Khanoum, during the late third millennium BC. Shortugai, which existed for several centuries, traded with its southern neighbours and constructed the first irrigation systems in the area. A thousand years later, the area fell under the control of the Persian Achaemenids, who established a satrapy (administrative province) centred on Bactra (present-day Balkh) and expanded eastwards by conquering the Indus Valley. To assert control over the local region, they founded a fort named Kohna Qala on a ford of the Oxus, around north of the later city. Although scholars have speculated that a small Achaemenid garrison may have been placed at the location, there is no consensus that a settlement was established at Ai-Khanoum prior to the arrival of the Greco-Macedonians under Alexander the Great  BC.

Historians have disputed who ordered the transformation of this small settlement into the major city it became. Initially, Ai-Khanoum was identified as Alexandria Oxiana, one of the cities founded by Alexander. There are considerable difficulties with identifying these cities, as the sources disagree; and the authors may have inadvertently referred to the same Alexandria as being at two different cities. As well as Ai-Khanoum, Alexandria Oxiana has been variously interpreted as being Alexandria in Sogdiana, Alexandria near Bactra, or as Termez. As there is a lack of distinct identifying features (such as artwork, sculpture, or inscriptions) associating Alexander with the city, it remains unlikely that he did more than replace an Achaemenid garrison on the site, if it existed, with a Greek one.


Based on ceramic data gathered at the site, it is likely that Ai-Khanoum was expanded in stages. The first stage would have begun under one of the first rulers of the Seleucid Empire—either the empire&#x27;s founder Seleucus I Nicator or his son and successor Antiochus I Soter. Seleucus established a cohesive Central Asian policy, which &quot;went beyond the limited, ad hoc military and political aims of Alexander&quot;, according to historian Frank Holt. After the Seleucid–Mauryan war, Seleucus ceded the Indus Valley to Chandragupta Maurya, in return for a pact of friendship and 500 war elephants; he thus sought the sustained economic and military development of Bactria, which was now the headquarters of the Seleucids in the East.

Antiochus, who had a personal connection to the region through his mother, Apama, the daughter of the Sogdian warlord Spitamenes, continued the policies of his father. Several of Ai-Khanoum&#x27;s key buildings, including the heroön (hero&#x27;s shrine), the northern fortifications, and a shrine, were constructed under his reign. It is likely that a mint was opened in Ai-Khanoum in around 285 BC, both because of the metal deposits near the city and a growing Seleucid interest in eastern Bactria, which suggests that this mint spurred the growth of the city as a royal foundation. Around one-third of the bronze coins found in the city were issued in the period following Antiochus&#x27; accession in 281 BC, an indication that he continued to spend money on the city. Under his successor Antiochus II, who came to the throne in 261 BC, the mint continued to strike valuable coins and the ramparts were bolstered with a buttress and brick linings.

The city&#x27;s development was greatly slowed when Diodotus I, governor of the eastern provinces, seceded from the Seleucids and founded the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. Although Ai-Khanoum&#x27;s temple and sanctuary were reconstructed under Diodotus, possibly to enhance religious legitimacy, most Seleucid construction programmes were not continued. Bertille Lyonnet theorises that during this time Ai-Khanoum was merely &quot;a military stronghold with administrative functions&quot;. The Seleucid emperor Antiochus III invaded the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom in 209 BC, defeating its ruler Euthydemus I at the Battle of the Arius and unsuccessfully besieging Bactra, Euthydemus&#x27; capital. Although there is no evidence that Ai-Khanoum was itself attacked by the invaders, Antiochus may have conducted operations near the city, or even minted his currency there. He may have also brought new settlers to the region. The later conquests of Euthydemus and his successor Demetrius I were also beneficial for the city, as the population increased and many public buildings were reconstructed. The improvement in the city&#x27;s fortunes can be seen through innovations in the manufacturing and sophistication of pottery—Achaemenid styles were replaced with more varied shapes, some of which were reminiscent of Megarian bowls.

The city&#x27;s zenith came during the rule of Eucratides I in the mid-second century BC, who probably made it his capital, naming it Eucratideia. During his reign, the palace and gymnasium were constructed, the main sanctuary and heroön were rebuilt, and the theatre was certainly active. He probably sponsored Mediterranean artists to place himself on a par with other major Hellenistic kings, the status of his capital city thus being comparable to that of Alexandria, Antioch, or Pergamum. The treasury was found to house substantial quantities of the loot from his campaigns in India against the Indo-Greek King Menander. It is likely that Ai-Khanoum was already under attack by nomadic tribes when Eucratides was assassinated in around 144 BC. This invasion was probably carried out by Saka tribes driven south by the Yuezhi peoples, who in turn formed a second wave of invaders, in around 130 BC. The treasury complex shows signs of having been plundered in two assaults, fifteen years apart.

Although the first assault led to the end of Hellenistic rule in the city, Ai-Khanoum continued to be inhabited; it remains unknown whether this reoccupation was effected by Greco-Bactrian survivors or nomadic invaders. During this time, public buildings such as the palace and sanctuary were repurposed as residential dwellings and the city maintained some semblance of normality: some sort of authority, possibly cultish in origin, encouraged the inhabitants to reuse the raw building materials now freely available in the city for their own ends, whether for construction or trade. A silver ingot engraved with runic letters and buried in a treasury room provides support for the theory that the Saka occupied the city, with tombs containing typical nomadic grave goods also being dug into the acropolis and the gymnasium. The reoccupation of the city was soon terminated by a huge fire. It is unknown when the final occupants of Ai-Khanoum abandoned the city. The final signs of any habitation date from the 2nd century AD; by this time, more than of earth had accumulated in the palace.

=== Modern ===
On 18 March 1838, a British soldier-explorer named John Wood was travelling in Badakshan as a representative of the East India Company. He was informed by his guides of the existence of an ancient city in the area, which the natives called &quot;Babarrah&quot;. All his inquiries were rebuffed by the local inhabitants and the chance of rediscovery was lost, as Wood wrote in an account:

In 1961, the King of Afghanistan, Mohammed Zahir Shah, was on a hunting expedition when he noticed the still-visible outline of the city from a hillside. He called in the French Archaeological Delegation in Afghanistan (DAFA), who had been excavating sites in the country since 1923. The excavation was led first by Daniel Schlumberger and then by Paul Bernard. As the city had never been resettled after its abandonment, the ruins lay close to the surface and were easy to excavate. At other sites in the region, successive generations built upon the foundations of their predecessors, leaving the Hellenistic construction layer as much as below the ground.

Nevertheless, the excavation of Ai-Khanoum proved problematic and complex. The city&#x27;s immense size meant that DAFA&#x27;s small team had to focus their attention on key areas, especially when the French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs decreased its funding in the mid-1970s. The inaccessibility of the city&#x27;s acropolis and the roughness of its terrain meant that any excavation there was much more difficult than on the lower level, leading to it being studied much less than the lower city. Despite these and other constraints, DAFA did not compromise on scientific rigour or procedure. In 1974, the remit of the mission was expanded to include paleogeographical and archaeological surveys of the surrounding areas; building upon these successful surveys, further fieldwork was also planned.

All archaeological work was stopped in 1978, when the Saur Revolution sparked the Soviet-Afghan War and triggered the still-ongoing political instability in Afghanistan. During the warfare, the site was comprehensively looted and several important artefacts were sold on the antiquities market to private collectors. The systematic looting of the northern part of the lower city appears to have been carried out through the digging of hundreds of holes. Although this suggests that the looters expected to find artefacts in an area DAFA had not excavated, the archaeological integrity of the site has been compromised. Although similar holes were found in the gymnasium complex, the palace complex perhaps suffered the greatest damage: the walls were used as a quarry for building materials (in some places even the deepest foundations were gutted), while the small quantities of limestone at the site, primarily found as decoration or capitals, were consumed in lime kilns. The Northern Alliance built a gun battery atop the acropolis, further destabilizing the site.

== Site ==
=== Location and layout ===
The city of Ai-Khanoum was founded at the southwest corner of a plain in the region of Bactria, at the confluence of the Oxus (modern Amu Darya) and Kokcha rivers. The plain, which covered an area of around , was triangular, being bounded by the rivers on two sides and the mountains of the eastern Hindu Kush on the third. The loess soil of the plain was naturally suitable for agriculture; the proximity to the rivers allowed for the construction of irrigation canals; and the nearby highlands provided herders with large areas of summer pasturage. The area was also rich in minerals: mines on the upper Kokcha in Badakshan were the only sources of lapis lazuli in the world, also producing copper, iron, lead, and rubies. The city was downstream from the confluence of the Oxus and Qizilsu, a tributary whose valley provided access to the mineral-rich Western Pamirs and Chinese Turkestan, but which also formed a natural corridor for any potential northern invaders. Ai-Khanoum therefore served as a strategically important bulwark, despite not controlling a major crossing of the Oxus or any other large trade route.

Reflecting the city&#x27;s strategic importance, its founders built Ai-Khanoum to a high defensive standard. To the south and west lay the Kokcha and Oxus, respectively—both riverbanks were steep cliffs more than high, which presented a challenge to any amphibious assault. Meanwhile, any eastward approach was protected by a natural acropolis, around in height, which stretched about north from the Kokcha. This plateau also included a small citadel at its southeast corner—protected by the -high cliffs on two sides and a small moat on the third, this fort served as the defensive headquarters of Ai-Khanoum.
These natural defences were reinforced by walls that completely enclosed Ai-Khanoum&#x27;s city and acropolis. The northern ramparts, which were not assisted by any natural features, were built to be particularly strong: the -high and -thick walls were built out of solid mud bricks and protected by large towers and a steep ditch. The size of these ramparts allowed a few defending soldiers to nullify siege engines and engage an attacking force with minimal casualties; the large scale also reflects the low confidence of the Greek architects in the strength of mud-brick walls. The main gate of the city was set in the northern rampart, which also guarded the canal that supplied water to the city&#x27;s centre.

From the main gate, a street ran southwards in a straight line along the base of the acropolis and continued through the lower city to the southern riverbank—a distance of about . Apart from the southern zone, which housed large dwellings organised in three blocks, the lower town was unplanned; this distinguishes Ai-Khanoum from other Hellenistic foundations of the Near East, such as Seleucia on the Tigris, which tended to be built according to the Hippodamian grid plan. It was also the subject of a major redevelopment during the early second century BC, which resulted in slight disunity in the orientations of some major buildings (the palace, for example, is at an angle to the older main street). Ai-Khanoum was built predominantly using unbaked bricks, with baked bricks and stone used much less often.

=== Palace complex ===

The palace complex was large, measuring about and occupying around a third of the lower town. The size and intricacy of the complex, which was built on the order of Eucratides I, would have served as a demonstration of the ruler&#x27;s power and wealth; Bernard commented that it &quot;simultaneously served three functions: it was a state structure, a residence, and a treasury&quot;. A huge plaza, in area, lay to the south of the palace and may have been used for military parades, drills, or simply as garrison quarters. The palace itself was accessed through a gateway known as the Main Propylaea, which opened on the west side of the main street; the propylaea itself had been built by an earlier ruler and was reconstructed under Eucratides. Encompassing a wide portico in between two adjoining porches, the roof of the structure was noted for its palmette antefixes. It allowed access to a curved road that ran towards the palace&#x27;s courtyard.

This rectangular courtyard, which measured and served as the main entrance to the palace, was entered from the curved road through another propylaeum. The courtyard was bordered by 118 Corinthian columns. The columns of the north, east, and west colonnades were high, while those of the south colonnade were almost tall, forming a Rhodian peristyle. The palace was entered through a hypostyle behind the southern portico; this vestibule, similar in style to a Persian &quot;iwan&quot;, was supported by eighteen columns, ornamented slightly differently from those in the courtyard. On the southern side of the hypostyle, a door opened onto a large reception room ornamented with decorations including wooden sconces, painted protomes of lions, and geometrical art; this room was probably enclosed, as it had no drainage system, and it allowed access to the other areas of the palace through doors on every side.

The palace was divided into three zones, each serving different functions and linked by a network of courtyards and long corridors, which were carefully placed, allowing both seclusion and easy access for royalty and highly ranked officials. South of the reception area lay a suite of rooms that would have served as the administrative quarters, consisting of a quadrangular block of two pairs of units separated from each other by corridors meeting at right angles; the eastern pair were used as audience halls, while the western pair possibly functioned as chancelleries. The entrances to the chambers from the encircling corridors were offset, meaning that, in theory, two separate groups could have entered the complex, been allowed an audience, received a decision, and left, without seeing each other.

West of the administrative quarter, on the southwestern side of the palace, lay two units that were identified, by the presence of bathrooms, as residential in purpose. In layout, the structures were similar to other residences excavated in the city, with a small courtyard to the north and living quarters to the south. The larger of the units, which contained other features such as a small &quot;iwan&quot; behind the courtyard, lay to the west and was separated from its smaller neighbour by an isolating corridor. The three-room bathrooms lay to the rear of the units and were tiled with limestone slabs and pebble mosaics of palmettes and marine animals, continuing an existing tradition of Hellenistic art. Based on the more private nature of the western unit, scholars have speculated that it was intended for the sovereign&#x27;s family, as contrasted with the eastern unit, which was probably intended for the monarch himself and his intimate companions. North of the residential units lay a small courtyard, which was connected to a small library in the treasury.

==== Treasury ====
The treasury building, on the western side of the palace courtyard, from which it could be entered, constituted the third zone. This building was of late construction, as the treasury itself was likely previously located in buildings east of the courtyard. In its latest form, the treasury building was composed of twenty-one rooms grouped around a square courtyard of approximately on a side. The thirteen rooms on the southern, eastern, and western sides opened directly onto this courtyard, while the eight storage rooms to the north were accessed from doors on an east–west corridor. The complex housed the inventory of the palace in vases labelled in Greek, including gemstones and lapis lazuli from the Badakshan mines, ivory, olive oil, incense, a cash reserve, and other valuables.
Many of the vase labels, which were either written with ink or inscribed post-firing, describe monetary transactions: for example, one attests that an official named Zenon had transferred 500 drachmas to two employees named Oxèboakès and Oxybazos, who were responsible for depositing the sum in the vase and sealing it. Most of the names inscribed on the labels are of Greek origin, but some, like Oxèboakès and Oxybazos, are not; these Bactrian-Iranian names were never inscribed in the &quot;senior&quot; position. Scholars have disputed whether a meaningful conclusion can be drawn.

Some of the other vases indicate transportation of luxury goods, such as incense from the Middle East or olive oil from the Mediterranean. Because of the perishable nature of the oil inside it, one of these vases is inscribed with the regnal year of the monarch (Year 24). Combined with other inscriptions in the treasury and the identification of the ruling monarch as Eucratides I, the date of Ai-Khanoum&#x27;s fall has been dated with fair certainty to around 145 BC. Several items in the treasury are likely to have been loot brought back by Eucratides from his Indian conquests: these include Indian agates and jewellery, offerings from Buddhist stupas, and a disc of mother-of-pearl plates depicting a scene from Hindu mythology. This disc, which was decorated with polychrome glass paste and gold thread, most probably represents the meeting of Dushyanta and Shakuntala.

The library was located at the south of the treasury near the residential quarters. Its function was identified through the discovery of two literary fragments, one on papyrus and the other on parchment; the organic writing material had decomposed, but through a process similar to decalcomania, the letters had been engraved on fine earth formed from mudbrick decomposition. The parchment constituted an unknown theatrical work, most probably a trimetrical tragedy, possibly involving Dionysus, a figure known for travelling to India and the East. On the other hand, the papyrus was a philosophical dialogue discussing the theory of forms of Plato, which some have considered a lost work by Aristotle. It is also possible, conversely, that the text was written by a Greco-Bactrian philosopher in Ai-Khanoum.

=== Private housing ===
A residential zone was situated in the area south of the palatial complex. This consisted of rows of blocks of large aristocratic houses, separated by streets at right angles to the main north–south road. The DAFA archaeologists chose to excavate a house near the end of the fourth row from the palace, close to the confluence of the two rivers. This house, in area, showed evidence of three older architectural stages dating back half a century to BC; it consisted of a large courtyard to the north and the main building to the south, separated by a large porch with two columns. The main building comprised a central reception room, encircled by a corridor which provided access to the bath complex, kitchen, and other rooms.
Another house, located outside the northern rampart, was partially excavated in 1973; the archaeologists were only able to study the central part of the main building and part of the western side in detail. This extramural dwelling was much larger than the one inside the city, covering an area of . With a large courtyard to the north and buildings to the south, it had a similar layout to the urban house, although its main building was divided by an east–west corridor into two halves—the northern section formed the living quarters, with a central reception room, while the southern section included the service quarters and bath complex. Fragments of columns found at the site indicate a height of nearly .

As the large dwellings at Ai-Khanoum, including those in the palace, have little in common with the traditional Greek &quot;oikos&quot;, scholars have theorised as to their origin. The prevailing hypothesis suggests an Iranian origin, similar styles being visible at Parthian Nisa and Dilberjin Tepe under the Kushan Empire. The city also contained other types of housing, including smaller houses for people of lower status.

=== Religious structures ===
The excavators discovered three temples at Ai-Khanoum—a large sanctuary on the main street near the palace, a smaller temple in a similar style outside the northern wall, and an open-air podium on the acropolis. The large sanctuary, often called the Temple with Indented Niches, was located prominently in the lower city, between the main street and the palace, and it consisted of a square edifice upon a -high podium, surrounded by an open area. It was constructed by the early Diodotids on the site of a very early Seleucid structure, which had been established shortly after the city&#x27;s foundation. The eponymous indented niches were situated on the -high temple walls—one was on each side of the front entrance, while each of the other sides was sculpted with four more. The courtyard was enclosed on three sides by buildings. To the southwest, there was a wooden colonnade with Oriental pedestals; to the southeast was a series of small rooms and porticoes adjoining a porch with columns of the distyle in antis style, which formed the entrance from the main street; and an altar was situated in the northeast wall.
From the beginning of the excavation, the Persian and Achaemenid elements of the temple&#x27;s architecture were remarked upon. The identifying &quot;indented niches&quot;, along with the building&#x27;s three-stepped platform, were common features of Mesopotamian architecture and successor styles. Many artefacts were found at the temple, including libation vessels (common to both Greek and Central Asian religious practices), ivory furniture and figurines, terracottas, and a singular medallion (&quot;pictured&quot;). This disc, which depicts the Greek goddess Cybele accompanied by Nike in a chariot drawn by lions, was described as &quot;remarkable&quot; by the Metropolitan Museum of Art on account of its &quot;hybrid Greek and Oriental imagery&quot;. Made of silver, the disk combines components of Greek culture, such as the chlamys all the deities wear, with Oriental design motifs such as the fixed pose of the figures and the crescent moon.

The small fragments that remain of the cult statue, which would have stood at the centre of the temple, show that it was sculpted according to the Greek tradition; a small portion of the left foot has survived and displays a thunderbolt, a common motif of Zeus. Based on the apparent dissonance between the Greek statue and the Oriental temple it was located in, scholars have posited the syncretism of Zeus and a Bactrian deity such as Ahura Mazda, Mithra, or a deity representing the Oxus. The thunderbolt has also been used as an attribute for the goddesses Artemis, Athena, or even Cybele; it could even be purely symbolic.

The DAFA archaeologists were only able to perform superficial studies of the other two religious structures. The temple outside the northern wall, which had succeeded a simpler and smaller structure on the site, somewhat resembled the grand central sanctuary in architecture with niches in the walls, but featured, instead of a cult image, three chapels for worship. The podium on the acropolis was oriented towards the east, provoking suggestions that it was used as a sacrificial platform for worship of the rising sun, as similar platforms have been found in the region. As the acropolis was primarily military, with only a few small residences, scholars have suggested that it was used as a ghetto quarter for native Bactrian soldiers; the validity of this segregationary hypothesis continues to be debated.

==== Heroön of Kineas ====
One of the most-studied monuments in the city is a small heroön, located just north of the palace in the lower town. This shrine, which was constructed on a three-stepped platform, consisted of a distyle in antis pronaos and a narrow cella. Four coffins—two wooden and two stone—were found underneath the platform. Burials were generally not allowed within the walls of Greek cities—hence Ai-Khanoum&#x27;s necropolis being located outside the northern ramparts—but special exemptions were made for prominent citizens, especially city founders. Since the shrine predated every other structure in the lower city, it reasonably may be supposed that the person the heroön was built to honour was either the city&#x27;s founder or an extremely notable early citizen. The most prominent of the coffins, which was also the earliest, was linked to the upper temple by an opening and conduit down which offerings could be poured. As the builders had not endowed any of the other sarcophagi with such a feature, this coffin would likely have housed the remains of that eminent citizen, while the others were reserved for family members. The general scholarly consensus is thus that this man, known from an inscription to have been named Kineas, was the Seleucid &quot;epistates&quot; or &quot;oikistes&quot; who governed the first settlers of Ai-Khanoum.

The archaeologists unearthed the base of a stele placed in a prominent position in the pronaos. Engraved upon it were the last five lines of a series of maxims, originally displayed at the Temple of Apollo in Delphi—only small and barely legible fragments of the upright portion of the stele, which would have been inscribed with the first 145 maxims, survive. An epigram was inscribed adjacent to the maxims, commemorating a man named Klearchos, who had copied the maxims from the Delphic sanctuary:

In 1968, Louis Robert, a French historian, proposed that the Klearchos named in the inscription was the philosopher Clearchus of Soli. This identification was founded on the fact that the philosopher Clearchus had written extensively on the morals and cultures of barbarian and Oriental cultures. Robert proposed that on a journey to research his literary subjects in more detail, Clearchus had stopped at Ai-Khanoum and set up his stele there. This theory was accepted as fact, and was often cited as an example of the purely Greek nature of Ai-Khanoum and of the interconnected nature of the Hellenistic world. Later historians have dismissed Robert&#x27;s hypothesis: Jeffrey Lerner noted that there is no evidence to support the assumption that Clearchus travelled to the eastern regions for research, as opposed to simply using a reference source; following Lerner, Rachel Mairs observed, knowing the philosopher&#x27;s approximate date of death, that the placement of the stele in the sanctuary would have been a generation after the presumed journey; Shane Wallace, meanwhile, has noted that Klearchus was not an uncommon name and thus Robert&#x27;s identification was improbable at best. All three propose instead that this Klearchus was a resident of Ai-Khanoum.

Despite the refutation of Robert&#x27;s theory, the stele still maintains its importance in modern analyses. The text of the epigram is poetic in its composition and vocabulary, echoing well-known Greek works such as Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Pindar&#x27;s odes, and possibly even Apollonius&#x27; &quot;Argonautica&quot;. Mairs and Wallace have attributed the inscription and placing of the stele to &quot;the first Bactrian-born generation&quot; in the middle or late second century BC; they propose that this generation sought to define themselves as part of the wider Greek world by giving Ai-Khanoum legitimacy in the eyes of Delphi, itself a symbol of Hellenic unity. The poem also shares thematic elements with the Buddhist Edicts of Ashoka (inscribed in 260–232 BC); and Valeri Yailenko has proposed that it may have inspired them, suggesting a contribution of Hellenistic philosophy to the development of Buddhist moral precepts.

=== Other buildings ===

A gymnasium was located along the western ramparts. In its final architectural phase, it covered an area of , divided between a southern courtyard and a northern complex, and was accessible from both the palace district and a street running behind the riverside fortifications. There were three doors allowing entrance from the courtyard to a corridor which encircled the main complex. This comprised long rectangular rooms surrounding a square central courtyard, entered through four exedrae, one on each side; the exedra on the northern side contained a small plinth bearing an inscribed dedication and a statue. The inscription was addressed to Hermes and Heracles, the two patron deities of the Greek gymnasium, by two brothers named Triballos and Straton, on behalf of their father, also named Straton; it is probable that the elder Straton was represented by the statue.

The arsenal, which was not fully excavated, was on the eastern side of the southern main street, against the base of the acropolis. Substantial quantities of slag found in the building&#x27;s courtyard suggest that the building housed the workshops of blacksmiths. Although the recovered weapons were diverse, they were few in number, leading to speculation that the main army was in the field when the city was taken; this theory was supported by brick blockages in the arsenal&#x27;s passages, suggesting a limited number of defenders. Of the pieces found, which included arrowheads, spears, javelins, a caltrop intended to stop mounted animals, and uniform ornaments, the most interest was paid to iron cataphract armour—the earliest example yet found.
The theatre was also built into the side of the acropolis, on the northern part of the main street. Seating between five and six thousand spectators—considerably more than would have lived in the city—it was in diameter and contained three loggia, just below the diazoma, which were probably used for dignitaries. It is clear that the audience was expected to come from the surrounding districts as well as the city, possibly for religious festivals. The excavators found the bones of around 120 individuals in the orchestra, probably dating from the fall of the city in 145 BC.

== Significance ==
=== Coinage ===

The excavations of Ai-Khanoum yielded three hoards of Hellenistic coins, along with 274 stray coins, of which 224 were legible. The first hoard was found in a small room in the administrative section of the palace complex in 1970. It contained 677 punch-marked coins and six silver drachmas all bearing the name of Agathocles of Bactria. The latter six coins are inscribed with the Greek and Brahmi scripts on either side, and are significant in their own right as &quot;the earliest unambiguous images&quot; of the Vrsni Viras. The figures on the coins can be definitively identified through their iconography: on the Greek side is Balarama, possibly as Sankarshana, holding his customary plough and a club, while the Brahmi side displays Vāsudeva with his Sudarshana Chakra and a conch shell. The coins indicate that the cult of the Vrsni Viras had spread far from their Mathuran homeland and that they had retained enough importance to be recognised with royal patronage; further, as the Greek obverse would have been superior to the Brahmi reverse, the coins show that Balarama was considered senior to Vāsudeva, in accordance with the traditional lineage system.

The second hoard was found three years later, in the kitchen of the extramural residence. This hoard consisted of 63 silver tetradrachms, of which 49 were Greco-Bactrian; a majority of these were dedicated to Euthydemus I, while the others were dedicated to other kings. The third hoard was found during the winter of 1973–4 by an Afghan farmer near the site, and was quickly sold on the antiquities market in Kabul. Although a large portion of the hoard later passed through New York, where a member of the American Numismatic Society was able to compile an inventory, its integrity had then been lost; some coins had been removed, while others, such as a drachma of Lysias Anicetus, had been added. Only 77 of the 224 legible stray coins were Greco-Bactrian or Indo-Greek; there were also 68 stray Seleucid coins, 62 of which displayed Antiochus I.

One series of Bactrian coins from the reign of Antiochus I was stamped with a triangular monogram () during the coining process. At Ai-Khanoum, bricks bearing the same mark were found in the heroön, one of the oldest structures in the city. Therefore, it is considered probable that Ai-Khanoum was the site of the primary Seleucid mint during Antiochus&#x27; coregency and early sole reign; an earlier mint, which was most likely located at Bactra but may have been elsewhere, was terminated near-simultaneously after a relatively brief period of operation.

=== Wider influence ===
Some items found at Ai-Khanoum, such as Greek olive oil in the treasury or the Mediterranean plater mouldings on Greco-Bactrian artwork, would suggest the existence of large-scale trading networks, but such findings are few, while the Indian art in the treasury seems to have simply been plunder. Historians have thus concluded that Greco-Bactria was isolated in terms of trade, but had a developed administration with a high level of economic diversity. This administration was passed on to the Yuezhi and Kushan nations, as shown by their use of Greek titles and coinage and their adaptations of the Hellenistic numerical and calendrical systems.

The art historian John Boardman has also noted that Ai-Khanoum may have been one of the conduits for Greek art influencing the art of ancient India; the sculpture of the pillars of Ashoka may have been inspired by drawings of Greco-Bactrian buildings brought back to the Mauryan Empire by ambassadors. It is impossible to say whether inspiration came from Ai-Khanoum or other Hellenistic sites. The artwork of Ai-Khanoum does display innovative and original craftsmanship, such as the biggest faïence sculpture found in the Hellenistic world, which melded Oriental production techniques with Greek traditions of acrolithic statues. A statuette of Heracles found at the site displays artistic continuity with later Indo-Greek coinage, which depict Vajrapani as syncretised with the demigod and Zeus.

=== Modern scholarship ===
The discovery of Ai-Khanoum, even more than that of the nearby temple of Takht-i Sangin, was of fundamental importance to the study of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom. Before its discovery, archaeologists such as Alfred Foucher had devoted careers to trying to find any physical confirmation for the existence of Hellenistic culture in Central Asia, but had continually failed. Apart from textual fragments in classical texts and a variety of coins with Greek inscriptions found throughout the region, there was a near-complete absence of evidence to support the theory. Foucher, who had found nothing during a difficult 18-month excavation in Balkh, gradually lost all hope, famously dismissing the hypothesis as the &quot;Greco-Bactrian mirage&quot;. The discovery of Ai-Khanoum re-energised the discipline and several Hellenistic sites have since been found throughout Central Asia. Mairs has noted that the discovery of Ai-Khanoum did represent a sort of &quot;turning point&quot; in the study of the Hellenistic Far East, even if the primary pre-discovery questions were still asked after the excavations had been finished.

<doc id="851905" wikidata="Q1088697" url="?curid=851905" title="Chrysler K platform">
<text>The K-car platform was a key automotive design platform introduced by Chrysler Corporation for the 1981 model year, featuring a transverse engine, front-wheel drive, independent front and semi-independent rear suspension configuration—a stark departure from the company&#x27;s previous reliance on solid axle, rear-drive unibody configurations during the 1970s. Derived from Chrysler&#x27;s L-cars, the Plymouth Horizon and Dodge Omni, the platform was developed just as the company faltered in the market, at first underpinning a modest range of compact/mid-size sedans and wagons—and eventually underpinning nearly fifty different models, including all-wheel drive variants—and playing a vital role in the company&#x27;s subsequent resurgence.

==Common platforms==
The use of a common platform is a widely used practice for reducing the number of parts and engineering time. Before creating the K platform, Chrysler was building vehicles on a small number of common platforms (e.g. F/L/J/M and R), but the different models shared few parts. In announcing his decision to develop the K platform, Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca said the company&#x27;s huge number of parts in inventory and the complexity of building many completely different versions of vehicles were reasons Chrysler was losing money. He directed the engineers to focus on making a larger number of common parts where they would not be visible to customers; this was already common practice in Japan and Germany and would help to make the K-cars profitable even at low prices.

Arriving on the brink of Chrysler&#x27;s near-certain financial collapse, the new platform had a dramatic effect, helping Chrysler report a profit in October 1980 of $10 million ($ in ), its first profit in two years. A plethora of K-platform body styles and badge-engineered variants followed the original range, including the company&#x27;s minivans and upscale Chrysler division models. The platform interchangeability saved production and purchasing costs, initially costing Chrysler $1 billion over three years to develop ($ in ), but only costing $50 million ($ in ) to generate the second group of badge-engineered variants, the LeBaron and Dodge 400. Within two years, the K platform vehicles accounted for roughly half of Chrysler&#x27;s operating profits.

In 1984, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;Not only did [K-cars] almost single-handedly save Chrysler from certain death, they also provided the company with a vehicle that could be stretched, smoothed, poked, chopped and trimmed to create almost a dozen different models.&quot;

In 1984, David Lewis, an auto industry historian and professor of business history at the University of Michigan said no platform &quot;in the history of the automobile industry has so dramatically allowed a company to survive in such a substantial way. No company has been down so low, in such difficult straits, and then depended on practically a single product to bring it back.&quot;


==Sales figures==
Following the 1973 oil crisis, compounded by the 1979 energy crisis, American consumers began to buy fuel-efficient, low-cost automobiles built in Japan. With the market for large V-8 engined automobiles declining, American domestic auto manufacturers found themselves trying to develop compact vehicles that could compete with the Japanese imports of Toyota, Honda, and Nissan in price and finish. Chrysler Corporation&#x27;s answer to the import pressure was the K platform, which featured an economical 4-cylinder engine, front-wheel drive and used many modern weight-reducing measures, such as replacing metal styling parts with plastic interior and exterior components.

The K-cars (Dodge Aries, Plymouth Reliant, Chrysler LeBaron, Dodge 400, and, in Mexico, Dodge Dart) sold over 2 million vehicles from 1981 to 1988, and around 100,000 in their final year, 1989.

The manual transmission provided acceleration of in 10 seconds, while the automatic was between 13 and 14 seconds, similar to or better than most competitors, while fuel economy was rated by the EPA at city and highway with the manual transmission. All had a wheelbase. The overall length of the two- and four-door models was . The wagon was longer. The vehicles had an approximate fuel tank. The coupe and sedan had approximately of luggage space; the wagons, with the rear seat upright and about when folded down.

Numerous improvements to the sound insulation and general feel were made for the model year 1983. In 1985, the Reliant, Aries, and LeBaron received a facelift, with a rounded front fascia, smoother hood, and bigger taillights. In 1986, the cars began using fuel injection on the 2.2-liter engine and a 2.5-liter engine replaced the arguably unreliable Mitsubishi 2.6-liter engine.

They were initially very profitable, and Iacocca credited them with allowing the company to pay off its bankruptcy loans early.

==Derivatives==
The K-derivatives offered a large variety of engines, depending on year and model. Four-cylinder engines were initially equipped with carburetors; fuel injection was phased in beginning in 1986. Engine output ranged from to . Most vehicles had the or Chrysler four-cylinder engine; however, from 1981 to 1985, a four and from 1987 to 1995, a V6, both made by Mitsubishi were offered.

<text>Serge Reggiani (born Sergio Reggiani; 2 May 1922 – 23 July 2004) was an Italian-French actor and singer. He was born in Reggio Emilia, Italy, and moved to France with his parents at the age of eight.

After studying acting at the Conservatoire des arts cinématographiques, he was discovered by Jean Cocteau and appeared in the wartime production of &quot;Les Parents terribles&quot;. He then left Paris to join the French Resistance.

His first feature film was &quot;Les portes de la nuit&quot; (&quot;Gates of the Night&quot;), released in 1946. He went on to perform in 80 films in total, including &quot;Casque d&#x27;or&quot;, &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1958), &quot;Tutti a casa&quot;, &quot;Le Doulos&quot;, &quot;Il Gattopardo&quot;, &quot;La terrazza&quot;, &quot;The Pianist&quot; (1998).

Reggiani also triumphed in the theatre in 1959 with his performance in Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s play &quot;Les Séquestrés d&#x27;Altona&quot;. In 1961, Reggiani co-starred with Paul Newman and Sidney Poitier in the film &quot;Paris Blues&quot;, filmed on location in Paris.

In 1965, at the age of 43, he began a second career as a singer, with the help of Simone Signoret and her husband Yves Montand, and later with the assistance of the French singer Barbara. Reggiani became one of the more acclaimed performers of French chanson, and although he was in his 40s, his rugged image made him popular with both younger and older listeners. His best-known songs include &quot;Les loups sont entrés dans Paris&quot; (&quot;The Wolves Have Entered Paris&quot;) and &quot;Sarah (La femme qui est dans mon lit)&quot; (&quot;The Woman Who Is in My Bed&quot;), the latter written by Georges Moustaki. He regularly sang songs by Boris Vian (&quot;Le Déserteur&quot;, &quot;Arthur où t&#x27;as mis le corps&quot;, &quot;La Java des bombes atomiques&quot;). His young fans identified with his left-wing ideals and anti-militarism, most notably during the student revolts in France in 1968. With age, he became acclaimed as being one of the better interpreters of the &quot;chanson&quot; and for bringing the poems of Rimbaud, Apollinaire, and Prévert to new audiences.

From 1980, when his son died, Reggiani struggled with alcoholism and depression. In 1995, however, he made a comeback to singing, giving a few concerts despite his deteriorated health and personal distress, the last one being held as late as the spring of 2004.

In later life, he became a painter and gave a number of exhibitions of his works.

Serge Reggiani died in Paris of a heart attack at the age of 82. He is buried in Montparnasse Cemetery.

<text>Wilburt &quot;Red&quot; Prysock (February 2, 1926 – July 19, 1993) was an American R&amp;B tenor saxophonist, one of the early Coleman Hawkins-influenced saxophonists to move in the direction of rhythm and blues, rather than bebop.

==Career==
With Tiny Grimes and his Rocking Highlanders, Prysock staged a saxophone battle with Benny Golson on &quot;Battle of the Mass&quot;. He first gained attention as a member of Tiny Bradshaw&#x27;s band, playing the lead saxophone solo on his own &quot;Soft&quot;, which was a hit for the Bradshaw band in 1952. Prysock also played with Roy Milton and Cootie Williams.

In 1954, he signed with Mercury Records as a bandleader and had his biggest hit, the instrumental &quot;Hand Clappin&#x27;&quot; in 1955. During the same year, he joined the band that played at Alan Freed&#x27;s stage shows. He also played on several hit records by his brother, singer Arthur Prysock, in the 1960s.

==Personal life==
Prysock was born in 1926 in Greensboro, North Carolina, United States, and died of a heart attack in 1993 in Chicago, at the age of 67. He served in the United States Army during World War II, which was when he learned to play saxophone. He was buried at the Salisbury National Cemetery in Salisbury, North Carolina.

<text>Makarska () is a town on the Adriatic coastline of Croatia, about southeast of Split and northwest of Dubrovnik, in the Split-Dalmatia County.

Makarska is a prominent regional tourist center, located on a horseshoe-shaped bay between the Biokovo mountains and the Adriatic Sea. The city is noted for its palm-fringed promenade, where cafes, bars and boutiques overlook the harbor. Adjacent to the beach are several large capacity hotels as well as a camping grounds.

Makarska is the centre of the Makarska Riviera, a popular tourist destination under the Biokovo mountain. It stretches for between the municipalities of Brela and Gradac.

==History==
===Pre-history===
Near present-day Makarska, there was a settlement as early as the middle of the 2nd millennium BC. It is thought that it was a point used by the Cretans on their way up to the Adriatic (the so-called Amber Road). However it was only one of the ports with links with the wider Mediterranean, as shown by a copper tablet with Cretan and Egyptian systems of measurement.

A similar tablet was found in the Egyptian pyramids. In the Illyrian era this region was part of the broader alliance of tribes, led by the Ardaeans, founded in the third century BC in the Cetina area (Omiš) down to the River Vjosë in present-day Albania.

===The Roman era===
Although the Romans became rulers of the Adriatic by defeating the Ardiaei in 228 BC, it took them two centuries to confirm their rule. The Romans sent their veteran soldiers to settle in Makarska. After the division of the Empire in 395 AD, this part of the Adriatic became part of the Eastern Roman Empire and many people fled to Muccurum from the new wave of invaders. The town appears in the Tabula Peutingeriana as the port of Inaronia, but is mentioned as Muccurum, a larger settlement that grew up in the most inaccessible part of Biokovo mountain, probably at the very edge of the Roman civilisation. It appears as Macrum on the acts of the Salonan Synod of 4 May 533 AD held in Salona (533), when also the town&#x27;s diocese was created.

===Early Middle Ages===
During the Migration Period, in 548, Muccurum was destroyed by the army of the Ostrogoth king Totila. The byzantine Emperor expelled the Eastern Goths (Ostrogoths).

In the 7th century the region between the Cetina and Neretva was occupied by the Narentines, with &quot;Mokro&quot;, located in today&#x27;s Makarska, as its administrative centre. The doge of Venice Pietro I Candiano, whose Venetian fleet aimed to punish the piratesque activities of the town&#x27;s vessels, was defeated here on September 18, 877 and had to pay tribute to the Narentines for the free passage of its ships on the Adriatic.

===Late Middle Ages===
The principality was annexed to the Kingdom of Croatia in the 12th century, and was conquered by the Republic of Venice a century later. Making use of the rivalry between the Croatian leaders and their power struggles (1324–1326), the Bosnian Ban Stjepan II Kotromanić annexed the Makarska coastal area. There were many changes of rulers here: from the Croatian and Bosnian feudal lords, to those from Zahumlje (later Herzegovina).

In the eventful 15th century the Ottomans conquered the Balkans. In order to protect his territory from the Turks, Duke Stjepan Vukčić Kosača handed the region to the Venetians in 1452. The Makarska coastal area fell to the Turks in 1499.

===Under the Turks===
Under Ottoman rule, the town was surrounded with walls that had three towers. The name Makarska was cited for the first time in a 1502 document telling how nuns from Makarska were permitted to repair their church.
The Turks had links with all parts of the Adriatic via Makarska and they therefore paid a great deal of attention to the port&#x27;s maintenance. In 1568 they built a fortress as defence against the Venetians. During Turkish rule the seat of the administrative and judicial authority was in Foča, Mostar, for a short time in Makarska itself and finally in Gabela on the River Neretva.

During the Cretan War between Venice and the Turks (1645–1669), the desire among the people of the area to be free of the Turks intensified. In 1646, Venice recaptured the coastline. A period of dual leadership, marked with armed conflicts, destruction, and reprisals, lasted until 1684, until the danger of the Turks ended in 1699.

===Once more under the Venetians===

In 1695 Makarska became the seat of a bishopric and commercial activity came to life, but it was a neglected area and little attention was given to the education of its inhabitants. At the time when the people were fighting against the Turks, and Venice paid more attention to the people&#x27;s demands. According to Alberto Fortis in his travel chronicles (18th century), Makarska was the only town in the coastal area, and the only Dalmatian town where there were absolutely no historical remains.

After the fall of the Venetian Republic, it was given to the Austrians by the Treaty of Campo Formio (1797).
===From 1797 to 1813===
With the fall of Venice, the Austrian army entered Makarska and remained there until Napoleon took the upper hand. The French arrived in Makarska on 8 March 1806 and remained until 1813. This was an age of prosperity, cultural, social and economic development. Under French rule all the people were equal, and education laws written, for the first time in many centuries, in Croatian were passed. Schools were opened. Makarska was at this time a small town with about 1580 inhabitants.

===Under the Austrians (1813–1918)===
As in Dalmatia as a whole, the Austrian authorities imposed a policy of Italianization, and the official language was Italian. The Makarska representatives in the Dalmatian assembly in Zadar and the Imperial Council in Vienna demanded the introduction of Croatian for use in public life, but the authorities steadfastly opposed the idea. One of the leaders of the National (pro-Croatian) Party was Mihovil Pavlinović of Podgora. Makarska was one of the first communities to introduce Croatian (1865).

In the second half of the 19th century Makarska experienced a great boom and in 1900 it had about 1800 inhabitants. It became a trading point for agricultural products, not only from the coastal area, but also from the hinterland (Bosnia and Herzegovina) and had shipping links with Trieste, Rijeka and Split.

The Congress of Vienna assigned Makarska to Austria-Hungary, under which it remained until 1918.

===20th century===

In the early 20th century agriculture, trade and fishing remained the mainstay of economy. In 1914, the first hotel was built, beginning the tourism tradition in the area. During World War II, Makarska was part of the Independent State of Croatia. It was a port for the nation&#x27;s navy and served as the headquarters of the Central Adriatic Naval Command, until it was moved to Split.

After the war, during the socialist Yugoslavia, Makarska experienced a period of growth, and the population tripled. All the natural advantages of the region were used to create in Makarska one of the best known tourist areas on the Croatian Adriatic.

===21st century ===
Following Croatian independence in 1991, Makarska had a sustained growth in first few years with many of the refugees (mostly from Herzegovina) being accommodated in tourist accommodation. In the late 1990s tourism was thriving again and in following decades created a speculative, rapid and wild construction boom with lot of highly problematic expansions (especially in Veliko Brdo), while with little or no urban planning at all. Local and regional experts have been active in drawing attention to the problems caused by the lack of planning and in this have recently been joined by members of the local population and citizens along with urban and environmental activists.

== Geography ==

Makarska is located in central Dalmatia, at the junction of Biokovo and the Adriatic Sea.

The town is sharply separated from the interior by the mountain Biokovo (the highest peak of St. George, 1762 m), and it is connected with the central Dalmatian islands of Brač and Hvar by the Adriatic Sea, which modelled some of the most beautiful Croatian beaches in the Makarska Riviera.

The town itself is located in a natural harbour between two peninsulas, Osejava and Sv. Petra. The flysch zone between the mountain and the sea is only a few kilometres wide, so that the further expansion of the city goes to the east and west, i.e. to the neighbouring settlements of Tučepi and Krvavica.

== Main sights ==

<text>Richard Harlan (September 19, 1796 – September 30, 1843) was an American paleontologist, anatomist, and physician. He was the first American to devote significant time and attention to vertebrate paleontology and was one of the most important contributors to the field in the early nineteenth century. His work was noted for its focus on objective descriptions, taxonomy and nomenclature. He was the first American to routinely apply binomial Linnaean names to vertebrate and invertebrate fossils. Prior to the time of Harlan, it was common practice to publish only a genus name for a fossil animal that was new to science.

==Biography==
Harlan was born in Philadelphia on September 19, 1796, to Joshua Harlan, a wealthy Quaker merchant, and his wife Sarah Hinchman Harlan, one of their ten children. He was three years older than his brother Josiah Harlan, who would become the first American to visit Afghanistan. Harlan graduated in medicine from the University of Pennsylvania in 1818 after taking time off during his studies to spend a year sailing to India as a ship&#x27;s surgeon for the British East India Company. He worked briefly at the private medical school of Joseph Parish. He wrote a text on the human brain &quot;Anatomical Investigations&quot; (1824). In 1820, he was a physician at the Philadelphia Dispensary, where he worked with Philip Syng Physick. In 1822 he was elected professor of comparative anatomy at Charles Wilson Peale&#x27;s Philadelphia Museum. One of his passions was the collection and study of human skulls. In 1822, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society. At its peak, his collection contained 275 skulls, the largest such collection in America. In 1825 he published &quot;Fauna Americana,&quot; a catalogue of American mammals, including those known only from fossils. In 1832 he went to Montreal to study a cholera epidemic.

Harlan also collected and received natural history specimens from a number of his friends and colleagues including Dr William Blanding (1773-1857), Samuel George Morton (1799-1851), and Samuel Wilson (and his son). He collaborated with other naturalists and supported Audubon during his travels. He described a number of species including &quot;Macroclemys temminckii&quot;, Harlan&#x27;s ground sloth, Harlan&#x27;s muskox and the Indian Hoolock gibbon. A parasite of the alligator snapping turtle is named after him &quot;Eimeria harlani&quot;.

In 1833 he attended a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science where he presented information on the fossil reptiles of America. He made an error in describing a species called &quot;Osteopera platycephala&quot; based on the skull of &quot;Agouti paca&quot;. He was criticized by his colleague from the Peale museum, John D. Godman (1794-1830), who wrote anonymously. In 1834, Harlan described and named &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; (&quot;king lizard&quot;), a genus of early whale, erroneously assuming he had found a &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot;-like dinosaur. In 1839 he visited Europe again and received a plaster copy of &quot;Mosasaurus hoffmannii&quot; from the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle that is now in the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. While in France he received news of a fire that had destroyed his collections. In 1842 he moved to New Orleans, Louisiana where he died of apoplexy a year later.

== Works ==
Harlan was the author of several books including:

* &quot;Fauna Americana&quot; (1825)
* &quot;American Herpetology&quot; (1827)
* Medical and physical researches, or, Original memoirs in medicine, surgery, physiology, geology, zoology, and comparative anatomy (1835)

<text>Sonny Stitt (born Edward Hammond Boatner Jr.; February 2, 1924 – July 22, 1982) was an American jazz saxophonist of the bebop/hard bop idiom. Known for his warm tone, he was one of the best-documented saxophonists of his era, recording over 100 albums. He was nicknamed the &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; by jazz critic Dan Morgenstern because of his tendency to rarely work with the same musicians for long despite his relentless touring and devotion to the craft. Stitt was sometimes regarded as a Charlie Parker mimic early in his career, but gradually developed his own sound and style, particularly when performing on the tenor saxophone and even occasionally baritone saxophone.

==Early life==
Edward Hammond Boatner Jr. was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and grew up in Saginaw, Michigan. He had a musical background: his father, Edward Boatner, was a baritone singer, composer, and college music professor; his brother was a classically trained pianist, and his mother was a piano teacher. He was placed for adoption in 1924 by his father and adopted by the Stitt family in Saginaw. He later began calling himself &quot;Sonny&quot;. While in high school in Saginaw, he played in the Len Francke Band, a local popular swing band.

In 1943, Stitt met Charlie Parker. As he often recalled, the two men had similar styles. Parker is alleged to have remarked, &quot;Well, I&#x27;ll be damned, you sound just like me&quot;, to which Stitt responded, &quot;Well, I can&#x27;t help the way I sound. It&#x27;s the only way I know how to play.&quot; Kenny Clarke said of Stitt, &quot;Even if there had not been a Bird, there would have been a Sonny Stitt.&quot;

During the 1940s, he played alto saxophone as a member of Tiny Bradshaw&#x27;s big band, Billy Eckstine&#x27;s big band with Gene Ammons and Dexter Gordon, and Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s big band. Stitt was a leader of Bebop Boys and Galaxy in 1946 and 1948 respectively.

When playing tenor saxophone Stitt seemed to break free from some of the criticism that he was imitating Parker&#x27;s style, and began to develop a far more distinctive sound. He played with other bop musicians including Horace Parlan, Bud Powell and Eddie &quot;Lockjaw&quot; Davis, a fellow tenor with a distinctly tough tone in comparison to Stitt, in the 1950s and recorded a number of sides for Prestige Records as well as albums for Argo, Verve, and Roost. Stitt experimented with Afro-Cuban jazz in the late 1950s, and the results can be heard on his recordings for Roost and Verve, on which he teamed up with Thad Jones and Chick Corea for Latin versions of such standards as &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot;.

In 1952 Stitt played with pianist Jimmy Jones and the next year performed orchestral music with Johnny Richards. Under Quincy Jones&#x27;s guidance in 1955 he played uptempos and ballads such as &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot; and &quot;Star Dust&quot; and the same year performed &quot;Afterwards&quot; and &quot;There Will Never Be Another You&quot; with Hank Jones. Stitt joined Dolo Coker in 1957 to perform &quot;Blues for Yard&quot; and &quot;Blue Moon&quot; before returning to Hank to perform &quot;Cherokee&quot;.

Stitt joined Miles Davis briefly in 1960, and recordings with Davis&#x27; quintet can be found only in live settings on the tour of 1960. Concerts in Manchester and Paris are available commercially and also a number of concerts (which include sets by the earlier quintet with John Coltrane) on the record &quot;Live at Stockholm&quot; (Dragon), all of which featured Wynton Kelly, Jimmy Cobb, and Paul Chambers. However, Miles fired Stitt due to the excessive drinking habit he had developed, and replaced him with Hank Mobley. Later in the 1960s, Stitt paid homage to Parker on the album &quot;Stitt Plays Bird&quot;, which features Jim Hall on guitar.

Stitt recorded several times with his friend Gene Ammons in sessions that were interrupted by Ammons&#x27; own imprisonment for narcotics possession. The records recorded by these two saxophonists are regarded by many as some of both Ammons and Stitt&#x27;s best work. The Ammons/Stitt partnership went down in posterity as one of the best dueling partnerships in jazz, alongside Zoot Sims and Al Cohn, and Johnny Griffin with Eddie &quot;Lockjaw&quot; Davis. Stitt ventured into soul jazz, and he recorded with fellow tenor saxophonist Booker Ervin in 1964 on the &quot;Soul People&quot; album. Stitt also recorded with Duke Ellington alumnus Paul Gonsalves in 1963 for Impulse! on the &quot;Salt and Pepper&quot; album in 1964. Around that time he appeared regularly at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s in London, a live 1964 encounter with Ronnie Scott, &quot;The Night Has a Thousand Eyes&quot;, eventually surfaced, and another in 1966 with resident guitarist Ernest Ranglin and British tenor saxophonist Dick Morrissey. Stitt was one of the first jazz musicians to experiment with the Selmer Varitone amplification system as heard on the albums &quot;What&#x27;s New!!!&quot; in 1966 and &quot;Parallel-a-Stitt&quot; in 1967.

==Later life==

In the 1970s Stitt slowed his recording output slightly but in 1972 produced another classic, &quot;Tune-Up!&quot;, which was and still is regarded by many jazz critics, such as Scott Yanow, as his definitive record. Indeed, his fiery and ebullient soloing was reminiscent of his earlier playing. In 1971 he managed to record four albums; &quot;Turn It On!&quot; with Leon Spencer, Melvin Sparks, Idris Muhammad, and Virgil Jones, &quot;You Talk That Talk!&quot; with Gene Ammons and George Freeman as new members of the group, &quot;Just the Way It Was (Live at the Left Bank)&quot; with Don Patterson and Billy James, and &quot;Black Vibrations&quot; which featured the same group as in &quot;Turn It On!&quot;. &quot;Just the Way It Was (Live at the Left Bank)&quot; which was released in 2000 also featured Stitt as an electric saxophone player, which was the first album which encompassed it.

Stitt&#x27;s productivity dropped in the 1970s due to alcoholism. He drank heavily after giving up heroin in the late fifties and the abuse was beginning to take its toll. A series of alcohol-induced seizures caused Stitt to abstain and quit for good.

Stitt joined the all-star group The Giants of Jazz (which also featured Art Blakey, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Kai Winding and bassist Al McKibbon) and made albums for Atlantic, Concord and EmArcy. His last recordings were made in Japan. A rejuvenated Stitt also toured with Red Holloway in the late 1970s, who noted a marked improvement in his playing. In 1975 he performed with Ron Burton, Major Holley and drummer John Lewis at the Village Vanguard.

In 1981, Stitt performed with George Duvivier and Jimmy Cobb, Six weeks before his death, Stitt recorded two consecutive sessions which were with George Duvivier, Jimmy Cobb, Bill Hardman and either Junior Mance or Walter Davis Jr. on piano.

In 1982, Stitt was diagnosed with cancer, and died on July 22 in Washington, D.C. He is buried in a wall crypt at Fort Lincoln Cemetery, Brentwood, Maryland.

<doc id="851927" wikidata="Q370163" url="?curid=851927" title="Obscurantism">
<text>In philosophy, the terms obscurantism and obscurationism identify and describe the anti-intellectual practices of deliberately presenting information in an and imprecise manner that limits further inquiry and understanding of a subject. The two historical and intellectual denotations of &quot;obscurantism&quot; are: (1) the deliberate restriction of knowledge — opposition to the dissemination of knowledge; and (2) deliberate obscurity — a style of writing characterized by deliberate vagueness.

In the 18th century, Enlightenment philosophers applied the term &quot;obscurantist&quot; to any enemy of intellectual enlightenment and the liberal diffusion of knowledge. In the 19th century, in distinguishing the varieties of obscurantism found in metaphysics and theology, from the &quot;more subtle&quot; obscurantism of the critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant and of modern philosophical skepticism, Friedrich Nietzsche said that: &quot;The essential element in the black art of obscurantism is not that it wants to darken individual understanding, but that it wants to blacken our picture of the world, and darken our idea of existence.&quot;

== Restricting knowledge ==
In restricting education and knowledge to a ruling class, obscurantism is anti-democratic in its components of anti-intellectualism and social elitism, which exclude the majority of the people, deemed unworthy of knowing the facts about their government and the political and economic affairs of their city-state.

In 18th century monarchic France, the political scientist Marquis de Condorcet documented the obscurantism of the aristocracy and their indifference to the social problems that provoked the French Revolution (1789–1799), which violently overthrew the aristocracy and deposed the monarch, King Louis XVI of France (r. 1774–1792).

In the 19th century, the mathematician William Kingdon Clifford, who was an early proponent of Darwinism, worked to eliminate obscurantism in England after hearing clerics — who privately agreed with him about evolution — publicly denounce evolution as un-Christian heresy. Moreover, in the realm of organized religion, obscurantism is a distinct strain of anti-intellectualism that is independent of theologic allegiance, by which distinction, religious fundamentalism presupposes sincere religious belief in the person, whereas censorship is obscurantism that is based upon the élite power-group manipulating the religious faith of the majority of the population of believers.

=== Leo Strauss ===

==== Political philosophy ====
In the 20th century, the American conservative political philosopher Leo Strauss and his neo-conservative adherents adopted the notion of government by the enlightened few as political strategy. He noted that intellectuals, dating from Plato, confronted the dilemma of either an informed populace &quot;interfering&quot; with government, or whether it were possible for good politicians to be truthful and still govern to maintain a stable society—hence the noble lie necessary in securing public acquiescence. In &quot;The City and Man&quot; (1964), he discusses the myths in &quot;The Republic&quot; that Plato proposes effective governing requires, among them, the belief that the country (land) ruled by the state belongs to it (despite some having been conquered from others), and that citizenship derives from more than the accident of birth in the city-state. Thus, in the &quot;New Yorker&quot; magazine article &quot;Selective Intelligence&quot;, Seymour Hersh observes that Strauss endorsed the &quot;noble lie&quot; concept: the myths politicians use in maintaining a cohesive society.

Shadia Drury criticized Strauss&#x27;s acceptance of dissembling and deception of the populace as &quot;the peculiar justice of the wise&quot;, whereas Plato proposed the noble lie as based upon moral good. In criticizing &quot;Natural Right and History&quot; (1953), she said that &quot;Strauss thinks that the superiority of the ruling philosophers is an intellectual superiority and not a moral one ... [he] is the only interpreter who gives a sinister reading to Plato, and then celebrates him.&quot;

==== Esoteric texts ====
Leo Strauss also was criticized for proposing the notion of &quot;esoteric&quot; meanings to ancient texts, obscure knowledge inaccessible to the &quot;ordinary&quot; intellect. In &quot;Persecution and the Art of Writing&quot; (1952), he proposes that some philosophers write esoterically to avert persecution by the political or religious authorities, and, per his knowledge of Maimonides, Al Farabi, and Plato, proposed that an esoteric writing style is proper for the philosophic text. Rather than explicitly presenting his thoughts, the philosopher&#x27;s esoteric writing compels the reader to think independently of the text, and so learn. In the , Socrates notes that writing does not reply to questions, but invites dialogue with the reader, thereby minimizing the problems of grasping the written word. Strauss noted that one of writing&#x27;s political dangers is students&#x27; too-readily accepting dangerous ideas—as in the trial of Socrates, wherein the relationship with Alcibiades was used to prosecute him.

For Leo Strauss, philosophers&#x27; texts offered the reader lucid &quot;exoteric&quot; (salutary) and obscure &quot;esoteric&quot; (true) teachings, which are concealed to the reader of ordinary intellect; emphasizing that writers often left contradictions and other errors to encourage the reader&#x27;s more scrupulous (re-)reading of the text. In observing and maintaining the &quot;exoteric—esoteric&quot; dichotomy, Strauss was accused of obscurantism, and for writing esoterically.

=== Bill Joy ===

In the article &quot;Why the Future Doesn&#x27;t Need Us&quot; (April 2000), the computer scientist Bill Joy, then chief scientist at Sun Microsystems, in the sub-title of the article proposed that: &quot;Our most powerful twenty-first-century technologies—robotics, genetic engineering, and nanotech—are threatening to make humans an endangered species&quot;, and said that:

Critics readily noted the obscurantism in Joy&#x27;s elitist proposal for limiting the dissemination of &quot;certain knowledge&quot; in order to preserve society. A year later, in the &quot;Science and Technology Policy Yearbook 2001&quot;, the American Association for the Advancement of Science answered Joy&#x27;s propositions with the article &quot;A Response to Bill Joy and the Doom-and-Gloom Technofuturists&quot;, wherein the computer scientists John Seely Brown and Paul Duguid said that Joy&#x27;s proposal was a form of technological tunnel vision, and that the technologically derived problems are infeasible, for disregarding the influence of non-scientists upon such societal problems.

== Appeal to emotion ==

In the essay &quot;Why I Am Not a Conservative&quot; (1960), the economist Friedrich von Hayek said that political conservatism is ideologically unrealistic, because of the conservative person&#x27;s inability to adapt to changing human realities and refusal to offer a positive political program that benefits everyone in a society. In that context, Hayek used the term &quot;obscurantism&quot; differently, to denote and describe the denial of the empirical truth of scientific theory, because of the disagreeable moral consequences that might arise from acceptance of fact.

== Deliberate obscurity ==
The second sense of &quot;obscurantism&quot; denotes making knowledge abstruse, that is, difficult to grasp. In the 19th and 20th centuries obscurantism became a polemical term for accusing an author of deliberately writing obscurely, in order to hide his or her intellectual vacuousness. From that perspective, obscure (clouded, vague, abstruse) writing does not necessarily indicate that the writer has a poor grasp of the subject, because unintelligible writing sometimes is purposeful.

=== Aristotle ===

Aristotle divided his own works into two classifications: &quot;exoteric&quot; and &quot;esoteric&quot;. Most scholars have understood this as a distinction of intended audience, where exoteric works were written for the public, and the esoteric works were more technical works intended for use within the Lyceum. Modern scholars commonly assume these latter to be Aristotle&#x27;s own (unpolished) lecture notes or, in some cases, possible notes by his students. However, the 5th-century neoplatonist Ammonius Hermiae writes that Aristotle&#x27;s writing style is deliberately obscurantist so that &quot;good people may for that reason stretch their mind even more, whereas empty minds that are lost through carelessness will be put to flight by the obscurity when they encounter sentences like these&quot;.

In contemporary discussions of virtue ethics, Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; (&quot;The Ethics&quot;) stands accused of ethical obscurantism, because of the technical, philosophic language and writing style, and their purpose being the education of a cultured governing elite.

=== Kant ===
Immanuel Kant employed technical terms that were not commonly understood by the layman. Arthur Schopenhauer contended that post-Kantian philosophers such as Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel deliberately imitated the abstruse style of writing practiced by Kant.

=== Hegel ===
G. W. F. Hegel&#x27;s philosophy, and the philosophies of those he influenced, especially Karl Marx, have been accused of obscurantism. Analytic and positivistic philosophers, such as A. J. Ayer, Bertrand Russell, and the critical-rationalist Karl Popper, accused Hegel and Hegelianism of being obscure. About Hegel&#x27;s philosophy, Schopenhauer wrote that it is &quot;a colossal piece of mystification, which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a pseudo-philosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage&quot;.

Nevertheless, biographer Terry Pinkard notes: &quot;Hegel has refused to go away, even in analytic philosophy, itself.&quot; Hegel was aware of his perceived obscurantism and perceived it as part of philosophical thinking: to accept and transcend the limitations of quotidian (everyday) thought and its concepts. In the essay &quot;Who Thinks Abstractly?&quot;, he said that it is not the philosopher who thinks abstractly, but the layman, who uses concepts as givens that are immutable, without context. It is the philosopher who thinks concretely, because he transcends the limits of quotidian concepts, in order to understand their broader context. This makes philosophical thought and language appear obscure, esoteric, and mysterious to the layman.

=== Marx ===
In his early works, Karl Marx criticized German and French philosophy, especially German Idealism, for its traditions of German irrationalism and ideologically motivated obscurantism. Later thinkers whom he influenced, such as the philosopher György Lukács and social theorist Jürgen Habermas, followed with similar arguments of their own. However, philosophers such as Karl Popper and Friedrich Hayek in turn criticized Marx and Marxist philosophy as obscurantist (however, see above for Hayek&#x27;s particular interpretation of the term).

=== Heidegger ===
Martin Heidegger, and those influenced by him, such as Jacques Derrida and Emmanuel Levinas, have been labeled obscurantists by critics from analytic philosophy and the Frankfurt School of critical theory. Of Heidegger, Bertrand Russell wrote: &quot;his philosophy is extremely obscure. One cannot help suspecting that language is here running riot. An interesting point in his speculations is the insistence that nothingness is something positive. As with much else in Existentialism, this is a psychological observation made to pass for logic.&quot; That is Russell&#x27;s complete entry on Heidegger, and it expresses the sentiments of many 20th-century analytic philosophers concerning Heidegger.

=== Derrida ===
In their obituaries &quot;Jacques Derrida, Abstruse Theorist, Dies at 74&quot; (10 October 2004) and &quot;Obituary of Jacques Derrida, French intellectual&quot; (21 October 2004), &quot;The New York Times&quot; newspaper and &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine described Derrida as a deliberately obscure philosopher.

In &quot;Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity&quot; (1989), Richard Rorty proposed that in &quot;The Post Card: From Socrates to Freud and Beyond&quot; (1978), Jacques Derrida purposefully used undefinable words (e.g. différance) and used defined words in contexts so diverse that they render the words unintelligible, hence, the reader is unable to establish a context for his literary self. In that way, the philosopher Derrida escapes metaphysical accounts of his work. Since the work ostensibly contains no metaphysics, Derrida has, consequently, escaped metaphysics.

Derrida&#x27;s philosophic work is especially controversial among American and British academics, as when the University of Cambridge awarded him an honorary doctorate, despite opposition from among the Cambridge philosophy faculty and analytical philosophers worldwide. In opposing the decision, philosophers including Barry Smith, W. V. O. Quine, David Armstrong, Ruth Barcan Marcus, René Thom, and twelve others, published a letter of protestation in &quot;The Times&quot; of London, arguing that &quot;his works employ a written style that defies comprehension ... [thus] Academic status based on what seems to us to be little more than semi-intelligible attacks upon the values of reason, truth, and scholarship is not, we submit, sufficient grounds for the awarding of an honorary degree in a distinguished university.&quot;

In the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot; article &quot;An Exchange on Deconstruction&quot; (February 1984), John Searle comments on Deconstruction: &quot;anyone who reads deconstructive texts with an open mind is likely to be struck by the same phenomena that initially surprised me: the low level of philosophical argumentation, the deliberate obscurantism of the prose, the wildly exaggerated claims, and the constant striving to give the appearance of profundity, by making claims that seem paradoxical, but under analysis often turn out to be silly or trivial&quot;.

=== Lacan ===
Jacques Lacan was an intellectual who defended obscurantism to a degree. To his students&#x27; complaint about the deliberate obscurity of his lectures, he replied: &quot;The less you understand, the better you listen.&quot; In the 1973 seminar &quot;Encore&quot;, he said that his (&quot;Writings&quot;) were not to be understood, but would effect a meaning in the reader, like that induced by mystical texts. The obscurity is not in his writing style, but in the repeated allusions to Hegel, derived from Alexandre Kojève&#x27;s lectures on Hegel, and similar theoretic divergences.

=== Sokal affair ===
The Sokal affair (1996) was a publishing hoax that the professor of physics Alan Sokal perpetrated on the editors and readers of &quot;Social Text&quot;, an academic journal of post-modern cultural studies that was not then a peer-reviewed publication. In 1996, as an experiment testing editorial integrity (fact-checking, verification, peer review, etc.), Sokal submitted &quot;Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity&quot;, a pseudoscientific article proposing that physical reality is a social construct, in order to learn whether &quot;Social Text&quot; would &quot;publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if: (a) it sounded good, and, (b) it flattered the editors&#x27; ideological preconceptions&quot;. Sokal&#x27;s fake article was published in the spring/summer 1996 issue of &quot;Social Text&quot;, which was dedicated to the science wars about the conceptual validity of scientific objectivity and the nature of scientific theory, among scientific realists and postmodern critics in American universities.

Sokal&#x27;s reason for publication of a false article was that postmodernist critics questioned the objectivity of science, by criticising the scientific method and the nature of knowledge, usually in the disciplines of cultural studies, cultural anthropology, feminist studies, comparative literature, media studies, and science and technology studies. Whereas the scientific realists countered that objective scientific knowledge exists, riposting that postmodernist critics almost knew nothing of the science they criticized. In the event, editorial deference to &quot;academic authority&quot; (the author-professor) prompted the editors of &quot;Social Text&quot; not to fact-check Sokal&#x27;s manuscript by submitting it to peer review by a scientist.

Concerning the lack of editorial integrity shown by the publication of his fake article in &quot;Social Text&quot; magazine, Sokal addressed the matter in the May 1996 edition of the &quot;Lingua Franca&quot; journal, in the article &quot;A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies&quot;, in which he revealed that his transformative hermeneutics article was a parody, submitted &quot;to test the prevailing intellectual standards&quot;, and concluded that, as an academic publication, &quot;Social Text&quot; ignored the requisite intellectual rigor of verification and &quot;felt comfortable publishing an article on quantum physics without bothering to consult anyone knowledgeable in the subject&quot;.

Moreover, as a public intellectual, Sokal said that his hoax was an action protesting against the contemporary tendency towards obscurantism—abstruse, esoteric, and vague writing in the social sciences:

In short, my concern over the spread of subjectivist thinking is both intellectual and political. Intellectually, the problem with such doctrines is that they are false (when not simply meaningless). There is a real world; its properties are not merely social constructions; facts and evidence do matter. What sane person would contend otherwise? And yet, much contemporary academic theorizing consists precisely of attempts to blur these obvious truths—the utter absurdity of it all being concealed through obscure and pretentious language.
As a pseudoscientific opus, the article &quot;Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity&quot; is described as an exemplar &quot;pastiche of left-wing cant, fawning references, grandiose quotations, and outright nonsense, centered on the claim that physical reality is merely a social construct&quot;.

<text>This is a list of lakes of Minnesota. Although promoted as the &quot;Land of 10,000 Lakes&quot;, Minnesota has 11,842 lakes of or more. The 1968 state survey found 15,291 lake basins, of which 3,257 were dry. If all basins over 2.5 acres were counted, Minnesota would have 21,871 lakes. The prevalence of lakes has generated many repeat names. For example, there are more than 200 Mud Lakes, 150 Long Lakes, and 120 Rice Lakes. All but four of Minnesota&#x27;s 87 counties (Mower, Olmsted, Pipestone and Rock) contain at least one natural lake. Minnesota&#x27;s lakes provide 44,926 miles of shoreline, more than the combined lake (~32,000 mi) and coastal (3,427 mi) shorelines of California.
Lakes whose coordinates are included below are visible in linked OSM map. Minnesota&#x27;s lakes are cataloged by the state Department of Natural Resources with a unique DNR Division of Waters Lake Number, which is listed for a subset of lakes in the table below. Swimming, fishing, and/or boating are permitted in some of these lakes, but not all.

<doc id="851935" wikidata="Q4943926" url="?curid=851935" title="Missouri Bootheel">
<text>The Missouri Bootheel is a salient (protrusion) located in the southeasternmost part of the U.S. state of Missouri, extending south of 36°30′ north latitude, so called because its shape in relation to the rest of the state resembles the heel of a boot. Strictly speaking, it is composed of some or all of the counties of Dunklin, New Madrid, and Pemiscot. However, the term is locally used to refer to the entire southeastern lowlands of Missouri located within the Mississippi Embayment, which includes parts of Butler, Mississippi, Ripley, Scott, Stoddard and extreme southern portions of Cape Girardeau and Bollinger counties. The largest city in the region is Kennett.

Until the 1920s, the district was a wheat-growing area of family farms. Following the invasion of the boll weevil, which ruined the cotton crop in Arkansas, planters moved in. They bought up the land for conversion to cotton commodity crops, bringing along thousands of sharecroppers. After mechanization of agriculture and other changes in the 1930s, many black families left the area to go north in the Great Migration. These counties have predominantly white populations in the 21st century, although some have a significant number of black residents.

==History==
When Missouri was admitted to the Union as part of the Missouri Compromise, its original border was proposed as an extension of the 36°30′ parallel north that formed the border between Kentucky and Tennessee. That would have excluded the Bootheel. John Hardeman Walker, a pioneer planter in what is now Pemiscot County, argued that the area had more in common with the Mississippi River towns of Cape Girardeau, Ste. Genevieve and St. Louis in Missouri than with its proposed incorporation in the Arkansas Territory. The border was dropped about 50 miles to the 36th parallel north. It follows that parallel west about 30 miles until intersecting the St. Francis River, then follows that river north to about the 36°30′ parallel just west of Campbell, Missouri.

According to an apocryphal story in various versions, the Bootheel was added to the state because of the request of John Hardeman Walker to remain in the state &quot;as he had heard it was so sickly in Arkansas&quot;, &quot;...full of bears and panthers and copperhead snakes, so it ain&#x27;t safe for civilized people to stay there over night even.&quot; Another legend has the adaptation made by a lovestruck surveyor to spare the feelings of a widow living 50 miles south of the Missouri border, but unaware of it. At one time, the area was known locally as &quot;Lapland, because it&#x27;s the place where Missouri laps over into Arkansas&quot;.

During the American Civil War, a number of battles took place in this area, most notably the Battle of Island No. 10.

Until the early 20th century, the district was largely covered by wetlands and swamps, but otherwise was a wheat-growing area of family farms. Lumbering was important in the 1890s until the most valuable trees were taken.

In 1905, the Little River Drainage District built an elaborate network of ditches, canals, and levees to drain the swamps, as people believed, not understanding about the important function of wetlands in modifying river flooding, that the highest use was for agriculture.

From 1880 to 1930, the population in the area more than tripled as many workers were brought in. Cotton became the chief commodity crop. Meanwhile, the boll weevil ruined the cotton crop in Arkansas, and planters moved into the Bootheel, bought up the new lands or leased them from insurance companies that had invested in the area, and recruited thousands of black sharecroppers as workers.

During the 1910s, the Bootheel experienced a surge in racial violence as white tenant farmers attacked black workers who were imported by landowners from the South. This competition between white laborers and black laborers resulted in a period of extreme racial violence which took the form of lynchings in New Madrid, Charleston, and Caruthersville.

In contrast to the other cotton-growing areas of the South, where blacks had been disfranchised around the turn of the century, they were allowed to vote in Missouri and played a political role in this area. In the main, political power was held by white power brokers, especially Democrat J. V. Conran from the 1930s to 1960s. He worked closely with blacks in the region. An ally of Senator and President Harry S. Truman, Conran packed the ballot boxes but did bring efficiency and government services, and helped improve economic and social conditions.

During the Great Depression, the Farm Security Administration said that the Bootheel was a &quot;paradox of rich land and poor people.&quot; In 1935, three-fourths of all farms were operated by tenants, most of them black. Radicals in the Southern Tenant Farmers Union organized protests by hundreds of sharecroppers in early 1939, alleging that landlords had evicted masses of tenants because they did not want to share federal AAA checks with them. The Farm Security Administration, a New Deal agency, responded by providing low-cost rental housing for 500 cropper families. It awarded $500,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) in grants to 11,000 families in 1939. The protest fizzled out as Communist and Socialist elements battled for control.

==Geography and geology==
Available samples from the Bootheel and most of the southeastern Missouri counties demonstrate late Tertiary (more than 1.8 mya) to Quaternary (1.8 mya to present) geology, much younger than neighboring highlands. The lowest point in the state is in southwestern Dunklin County along the St. Francis River near Arbyrd, at 230 feet above sea level. The bootheel area is notable for being the epicenter of the 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes, some of the largest earthquakes ever felt in the United States.

==Swamp reclamation and flooding==
As glaciers receded towards the end of the Ice Age and turned ice into liquid, the Mississippi River grew longer and wider. Over time, the silt deposits of the Mississippi created some of the most fertile soil in the world, ideal for agriculture. The areas around the Mississippi are composed of thick regolith that is around thick. The Bootheel lies in the flood plain between the Mississippi and St. Francis rivers, so the land is very flat. Since clearing and drainage of wetlands in the early 20th century, it has been predominantly developed for agricultural purposes. Prior to the 20th century, it was mostly unsettled swampy forestland.

Between 1893 and 1989, developers cut about 85% of the native forests in the region; most clearing was done in the early decades of the 20th century. The entire landscape was transformed into farmland by extensive logging, draining of the watershed, channelization, and the construction of flood control structures. High levees along both river courses, an extensive system of drainage ditches and diversion channels, and controlled lakes, pumping stations and cutoffs protect the area from flooding. The soils are predominantly a rich and deep glacial loess, alluvial silt, and a sandy loam, well-suited for agricultural use.

But the levees have changed the nature of the rivers, and cumulatively have aggravated flooding problems. They also prevent regular silt deposits, as they have increased the speed of the rivers. The reduction in wetlands has reduced important habitats for many species of migratory birds and a variety of fish and animals.

Flooding is a major concern along the Mississippi River. With such a large river basin and the vast discharge of water, the river makes the towns along its banks highly susceptible to frequent flooding. The National Weather Service reported that from 1980 to 2002, nine floods in the United States had total losses exceeding one billion dollars. In terms of monetary loss and effects on society, the Great Flood of 1993 was the worst.

==New Madrid fault zone==
Earthquakes have long been frequent in the area. The New Madrid Fault Zone is named for the city of New Madrid in the Bootheel. This fault zone is entirely hidden beneath the deep alluvial deposits of the Mississippi embayment. Unlike the San Andreas Fault in California, it is not visible anywhere. This fault zone was responsible for an extremely powerful series of earthquakes that rocked the area in 1811 and 1812, known collectively as the New Madrid earthquake. It was reported to have been so powerful as to ring church bells along the East Coast. Subsidence formed Reelfoot Lake on the other side of the Mississippi River in West Tennessee. An eyewitness of the earthquakes of 1811 and 1812 noted:
The states of Missouri, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, and Indiana felt the brunt of this quake, ruining lives and leaving residents in fear of aftershocks and possible larger quakes. The New Madrid Seismic Zone is still active and frequently produces small earthquakes. Scientists have estimated that a strong earthquake is inevitable and is overdue. Residents of the area are aware of the risk, but critics say they are not well prepared for a disaster. William Atkinson, author of &quot;The Next New Madrid Earthquake&quot;, writes:

Given the population in the area, even a moderately sized earthquake would be disastrous.

==Culture and economy==
The Bootheel is on the edge of the Mississippi Delta culture that produced the Delta blues. Its relatively large black population makes it distinct from the rest of rural Missouri. The area has a unique rural black culture reflected in its music, churches and other traditions. The black population ranges from about 26% in Pemiscot County, to 15% in New Madrid County, and about 9% in Dunklin County.

The Bootheel once had a reputation for lawlessness. Remote settlements along the river banks, miles from paved roads, provided an ideal environment (and market) for moonshining and bootlegging.

Culturally, the Bootheel is considered more Southern than Midwestern. It was settled largely by people from the South, both black and white. It is considered part of the Mid-South, a region centered on the Memphis metropolitan area; it is also included in the area of the Upper South. Definitions of the Mid-South vary but in general include west Tennessee and Kentucky, north Mississippi, northeast Arkansas, and the Missouri Bootheel. The locations of the region&#x27;s television stations had reflected this until the early 21st century prior to smaller, but closer cities obtaining local stations and before the digital transition in 2009:
*CBS and Fox affiliates (KFVS-TV and KBSI, respectively) are located in Cape Girardeau (the prior affiliate was WREG-TV in Memphis)
*ABC affiliates include WSIL-TV in Harrisburg, Illinois, and KAIT in Jonesboro, Arkansas (the prior affiliate was WATN in Memphis)
*NBC affiliate WPSD-TV is in Paducah, Kentucky; digital subchannel KAIT-DT2 from Jonesboro is a secondary affiliate (the prior affiliate was WMC-TV in Memphis)

Economically, the agricultural area is one of the more impoverished parts of Missouri. It does not enjoy the benefits of tourism as do areas of the nearby Ozark Mountains. There is some manufacturing, but the area is primarily agricultural. Because of its alluvial past, the area&#x27;s rich soil is ideal for growing soybeans, rice and cotton. Some truck crops are grown, most notably various types of melons, especially watermelons. A limited amount of livestock is raised. In contrast to much of the rest of Missouri, there are few fences.

No large cities are located in the Bootheel. Sizable towns include Kennett, the birthplace of singers Sheryl Crow, David Nail, and Trent Tomlinson; and Sikeston, the birthplace of professional athletes James Wilder Sr., Brandon Barnes, and Blake DeWitt. Sikeston&#x27;s city limits fall within both Scott County and New Madrid County. Cape Girardeau and Poplar Bluff are often considered to be part of the Bootheel due to the influence the two cities have had on the development of the region, but neither is located within its geographic boundaries.

Hornersville, a small town in southern Dunklin County, was home to William H. &quot;Major&quot; Ray, a one-time 19th-century circus &quot;midget&quot;. He later became known as the representative of the Buster Brown shoe brand. He and his wife, Jennie, are buried in a cemetery in Hornersville. Caruthersville is the county seat of Pemiscot County.

The small towns of Senath and Arbyrd are also located in Dunklin County. They are home to a locally celebrated ghost light, sometimes called the &quot;Senath Light&quot; or &quot;Arbyrd light&quot;. It occurs between these two towns and closer to Hollywood near the Lulu Church and Cemetery.

The Missouri Bootheel is the home of two members of the musical group the Kentucky Headhunters, Doug and Ricky Phelps. They received their education at Southland C-9, the consolidated schools of Arbyrd and Cardwell, Missouri. They performed at the Cotton Pickin Festival in the small town of Arbyrd; a place where they spent much time while growing up. They both performed as Brother Phelps, and then Doug came back and performed with The Kentucky Headhunters. This festival is a major attraction and draws a huge crowd for a town of only about 550 people. Other prominent acts at Arbyrd include T. Graham Brown and The Bellamy Brothers.

Also in the northern part of Dunklin County lies the town of Malden, the home of country/rockabilly singer Narvel Felts. Felts&#x27; music has played worldwide, as he continues to tour.

<text>In the musical system of ancient Greece, genus (Greek: γένος [&quot;genos&quot;], pl. γένη [&quot;genē&quot;], Latin: &quot;genus&quot;, pl. &quot;genera&quot; &quot;type, kind&quot;) is a term used to describe certain classes of intonations of the two movable notes within a tetrachord. The tetrachordal system was inherited by the Latin medieval theory of scales and by the modal theory of Byzantine music; it may have been one source of the later theory of the jins of Arabic music. In addition, Aristoxenus (in his fragmentary treatise on rhythm) calls some patterns of rhythm &quot;genera&quot;.

==Tetrachords==
According to the system of Aristoxenus and his followers—Cleonides, Bacchius, Gaudentius, Alypius, Bryennius, and Aristides Quintilianus—the paradigmatic tetrachord was bounded by the fixed tones &quot;hypate&quot; and &quot;mese&quot;, which are a perfect fourth apart and do not vary from one genus to another. Between these are two movable notes, called &quot;parhypate&quot; and &quot;lichanos&quot;. The upper tone, lichanos, can vary over the range of a whole tone, whereas the lower note, parhypate, is restricted to the span of a quarter tone. However, their variation in position must always be proportional. This interval between the fixed hypate and movable parhypate cannot ever be larger than the interval between the two movable tones. When the composite of the two smaller intervals is less than the remaining (incomposite) interval, the three-note group is called &quot;pyknon&quot; (meaning &quot;compressed&quot;). 

The positioning of these two notes defined three genera: the diatonic, chromatic (also called &quot;chroma&quot;, &quot;colour&quot;), and enharmonic (also called ἁρμονία [&quot;harmonia&quot;]). The first two of these were subject to further variation, called shades—χρόαι (&quot;chroai&quot;)—or species—εἶδη (&quot;eidē&quot;). For Aristoxenus himself, these shades were dynamic: that is, they were not fixed in an ordered scale, and the shades were flexible along a continuum within certain limits. Instead, they described characteristic functional progressions of intervals, which he called &quot;roads&quot; (ὁδοί), possessing different ascending and descending patterns while nevertheless remaining recognisable. For his successors, however, the genera became fixed intervallic successions, and their shades became precisely defined subcategories. Furthermore, in sharp contrast to the Pythagoreans, Aristoxenos deliberately avoids numerical ratios. Instead, he defines a whole tone as the difference between a perfect fifth and a perfect fourth, and then divides that tone into semitones, third-tones, and quarter tones, to correspond to the diatonic, chromatic, and enharmonic genera, respectively.

===Diatonic===
Aristoxenus describes the diatonic genus () as the oldest and most natural of the genera. It is the division of the tetrachord from which the modern diatonic scale evolved. The distinguishing characteristic of the diatonic genus is that its largest interval is about the size of a major second. The other two intervals vary according to the tunings of the various shades.

====Etymology====
The English word &quot;&quot; is ultimately from the , itself from , of disputed etymology.

Most plausibly, it refers to the intervals being &quot;stretched out&quot; in that tuning, in contrast to the other two tunings, whose lower two intervals were referred to as , from . This takes , to mean &quot;interval of a tone&quot;; see Liddell and Scott&#x27;s &quot;Greek Lexicon &quot; and Barsky (second interpretation), below.

Alternatively, it could mean (as OED claims) &quot;through the tones&quot;, interpreting as &quot;through&quot;. See also Barsky: &quot;There are two possible ways of translating the Greek term &#x27;diatonic&#x27;: (1) &#x27;running through tones&#x27;, i.e. through the whole tones; or (2) a &#x27;tensed&#x27; tetrachord filled up with the widest intervals&quot;.
The second interpretation would be justified by consideration of the pitches in the diatonic tetrachord, which are more equally distributed (&quot;stretched out&quot;) than in the chromatic and enharmonic tetrachords, and are also the result of tighter stretching of the two variable strings. It is perhaps also sounder on linguistic morphological grounds. Compare &quot;&quot; as &quot;across/width distance&quot;.

A completely separate explanation of the origins of the term &quot;diatonic&quot; appeals to the generation of the diatonic scale from &quot;two tones&quot;: &quot;Because the musical scale is based entirely on octaves and fifths, that is, two notes, it is called the &#x27;diatonic scale&#x27; &quot;. But this ignores the fact that it is the element &quot;di-&quot; that means &quot;two&quot;, not the element &quot;dia-&quot;, which has &quot;through&quot; among its meanings (see Liddell and Scott). There is a Greek term , which is applied to an interval equivalent to two tones. It yields the English words &quot;ditone&quot; and &quot;ditonic&quot; (see Pythagorean comma), but it is quite distinct from διάτονος.

The Byzantine theorist George Pachymeres consider the term derived from , meaning &quot;to stretch to the end&quot;, because &quot;...the voice is most stretched by it&quot; ().

Yet another derivation assumes the sense &quot;through the tones&quot; for διάτονος, but interprets &quot;tone&quot; as meaning &quot;individual note&quot; of the scale: &quot;The word diatonic means &#x27;through the tones&#x27; (i.e., through the tones of the key)&quot; (Gehrkens, 1914, see ; see also the Prout citation, at the same location). This is not in accord with any accepted Greek meaning, and in Greek theory it would fail to exclude the other tetrachords.

The fact that τόνος itself has at least four distinct meanings in Greek theory of music contributes to the uncertainty of the exact meaning and derivation of διατονικός, even among ancient writers: τόνος may refer to a pitch, an interval, a &quot;key&quot; or register of the voice, or a mode.

====Shades or tunings==== 
The diatonic tetrachord can be &quot;tuned&quot; using several shades or tunings. Aristoxenus (and Cleonides, following his example; see also Ptolemy&#x27;s tunings) describes two shades of the diatonic, which he calls συντονόν (&quot;syntonón&quot;, from συντονός) and μαλακόν (&quot;malakón&quot;, from ). &quot;Syntonón&quot; and &quot;malakón&quot; can be translated as &quot;tense&quot; (&quot;taut&quot;) and &quot;relaxed&quot; (&quot;lax, loose&quot;), corresponding to the tension in the strings. These are often translated as &quot;intense&quot; and &quot;soft&quot;, as in Harry Partch&#x27;s influential &quot;Genesis of a Music&quot;, or alternatively as &quot;sharp&quot; (higher in pitch) and &quot;soft&quot; (&quot;flat&quot;, lower in pitch). The structures of some of the most common tunings are the following:
The traditional Pythagorean tuning of the diatonic, also known as Ptolemy&#x27;s ditonic diatonic, has two identical 9:8 tones (see major tone) in succession, making the other interval a Pythagorean limma (256:243):
 hypate parhypate lichanos mese
 4:3 81:64 9:8 1:1
 | 256:243 | 9:8 | 9:8 |
 -498 -408 -204 0 cents

However, the most common tuning in practice from about the 4th century BC to the 2nd century AD appears to have been Archytas&#x27;s diatonic, or Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;tonic diatonic&quot;, which has an 8:7 tone (see septimal whole tone) and the superparticular 28:27 instead of the complex 256:243 for the lowest interval:
 hypate parhypate lichanos mese
 4:3 9:7 9:8 1:1
 | 28:27 | 8:7 | 9:8 |
 -498 -435 -204 0 cents

Didymus described the following tuning, similar to Ptolemy&#x27;s later tense diatonic, but reversing the order of the 10:9 and 9:8, namely:
 hypate parhypate lichanos mese
 4:3 5:4 9:8 1:1
 | 16:15 | 10:9 | 9:8 |
 -498 -386 -204 0 cents

Ptolemy, following Aristoxenus, also described &quot;tense&quot; and &quot;relaxed&quot; (&quot;intense&quot; and &quot;soft&quot;) tunings. His &quot;tense diatonic&quot;, as used in Ptolemy&#x27;s intense diatonic scale, is:
 hypate parhypate lichanos mese
 4:3 5:4 10:9 1:1
 | 16:15 | 9:8 | 10:9 |
 -498 -386 -182 0 cents

Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;relaxed diatonic&quot; (&quot;soft diatonic&quot;) was:
 hypate parhypate lichanos mese
 4:3 80:63 8:7 1:1
 | 21:20 | 10:9 | 8:7 |
 -498 -413 -231 0 cents

Ptolemy described his &quot;equable&quot; or &quot;even diatonic&quot; as sounding foreign or rustic, and its neutral seconds are reminiscent of scales used in Arabic music. It is based on an equal division of string lengths (thus presumably simple to build and &quot;rustic&quot;), which implies a harmonic series of pitch frequencies:
 hypate parhypate lichanos mese
 4:3 11:9 10:9 1:1
 | 12:11 | 11:10 | 10:9 |
 -498 -347 -182 0 cents

====Byzantine music====
In Byzantine music most of the modes of the octoechos are based on the diatonic genus, apart from the &quot;second mode (both authentic and plagal)&quot; which is based on the chromatic genus. Byzantine music theory distinguishes between two tunings of the diatonic genus, the so-called &quot;hard diatonic&quot; on which the &quot;third mode&quot; and two of the &quot;grave modes&quot; are based, and the &quot;soft diatonic&quot; on which the &quot;first mode (both authentic and plagal)&quot; and the &quot;fourth mode (both authentic and plagal)&quot; are based. The hard tuning of the diatonic genus in Byzantine music may also be referred to as the &quot;enharmonic genus&quot;; an unfortunate name that persisted, since it can be confused with the ancient enharmonic genus.

===Chromatic===
Aristoxenus describes the chromatic genus () as a more recent development than the diatonic. It is characterized by an upper interval of a minor third. The &quot;pyknon&quot; (πυκνόν), consisting of the two movable members of the tetrachord, is divided into two adjacent semitones.

The scale generated by the chromatic genus is not like the modern twelve-tone chromatic scale. The modern (18th-century) well-tempered chromatic scale has twelve pitches to the octave, and consists of semitones of various sizes; the equal temperament common today, on the other hand, also has twelve pitches to the octave, but the semitones are all of the same size. In contrast, the ancient Greek chromatic scale had seven pitches (i.e. heptatonic) to the octave (assuming alternating conjunct and disjunct tetrachords), and had incomposite minor thirds as well as semitones and whole tones.

The (Dorian) scale generated from the chromatic genus is composed of two chromatic tetrachords:
:E−F−G−A || B−C−D−E
whereas in modern music theory, a &quot;chromatic scale&quot; is:
:E−F−G−A−B−C−D−E

====Shades====
The number and nature of the shades of the chromatic genus vary amongst the Greek theorists. The major division is between the Aristoxenians and the Pythagoreans. Aristoxenus and Cleonides agree there are three, called soft, hemiolic, and tonic. Ptolemy, representing a Pythagorean view, held that there are five.

====Tunings====
Theon of Smyrna gives an incomplete account of Thrasyllus of Mendes&#x27; formulation of the greater perfect system, from which the diatonic and enharmonic genera can be deduced.
For the chromatic genus, however, all that is given is a 32:27 proportion of &quot;mese&quot; to &quot;lichanos&quot;. This leaves 9:8 for the &quot;pyknon&quot;, but there is no information at all about the position of the chromatic &quot;parhypate&quot; and therefore of the division of the &quot;pyknon&quot; into two semitones, though it may have been the &quot;limma&quot; of 256:243, as Boethius does later. Someone has referred to this speculative reconstructions as the traditional Pythagorean tuning of the chromatic genus:
 hypate parhypate lichanos mese
 4:3 81:64 32:27 1:1
 | 256:243 | 2187:2048 | 32:27 |
 -498 -408 -294 0 cents

Archytas used the simpler and more consonant 9:7, which he used in all three of his genera. His chromatic division is:
 hypate parhypate lichanos mese
 4:3 9:7 32:27 1:1
 | 28:27 | 243:224 | 32:27 |
 -498 -435 -294 0 cents

According to Ptolemy&#x27;s calculations, Didymus&#x27;s chromatic has only 5-limit intervals, with the smallest possible numerators and denominators. The successive intervals are all superparticular ratios:
 hypate parhypate lichanos mese
 4:3 5:4 6:5 1:1
 | 16:15 | 25:24 | 6:5 |
 -498 -386 -316 0 cents

====Byzantine music====
In Byzantine music the chromatic genus is the genus on which the &quot;second mode&quot; and &quot;second plagal mode&quot; are based. The &quot;extra&quot; mode nenano is also based on this genus.

===Enharmonic ===
Aristoxenus describes the enharmonic genus (; ) as the &quot;highest and most difficult for the senses&quot;. Historically it has been the most mysterious and controversial of the three genera. Its characteristic interval is a ditone (or major third in modern terminology), leaving the &quot;pyknon&quot; to be divided by two intervals smaller than a semitone called dieses (approximately quarter tones, though they could be calculated in a variety of ways). Because it is not easily represented by Pythagorean tuning or meantone temperament, there was much fascination with it in the Renaissance.

In the modern tuning system of twelve-tone equal temperament, &quot;enharmonic&quot; refers to tones that are &quot;identical&quot;, but spelled differently. In other tuning systems, enharmonic notes, such as C and D, may be close but not identical, differing by a comma (an interval smaller than a semitone, like a diesis).

====Notation====
Modern notation for enharmonic notes requires two special symbols for raised and lowered quarter tones or half-semitones or quarter steps. Some symbols used for a quarter-tone flat are a downward-pointing arrow ↓, or a flat combined with an upward-pointing arrow ↑. Similarly, for a quarter-tone sharp, an upward-pointing arrow may be used, or else a sharp with a downward-pointing arrow. Three-quarter flat and sharp symbols are formed similarly. A further modern notation involves reversed flat signs for quarter-flat, so that an enharmonic tetrachord may be represented:
: D   E   F   G ,
or
: A   B   C   D .
The double-flat symbol () is used for modern notation of the third tone in the tetrachord to follow modern convention of keeping scale notes as a letter sequence, and to remind the reader that the third tone in an enharmonic tetrachord (say F, shown above) was not tuned quite the same as the second note in a diatonic or chromatic scale (the expected E instead of F).

====Scale====
Like the diatonic scale, the ancient Greek enharmonic scale also had seven notes to the octave (assuming alternating conjunct and disjunct tetrachords), not 24 as one might imagine by analogy to the modern chromatic scale. A scale generated from two disjunct enharmonic tetrachords is:

: D   E   F   G ‖ A   B   C   D  
or, in music notation starting on E: ,
with the corresponding conjunct tetrachords forming

: A   B   C | D | E   F   G  
or, transposed to E like the previous example: .

====Tunings====
The precise ancient Pythagorean tuning of the enharmonic genus is not known. Aristoxenus believed that the &quot;pyknon&quot; evolved from an originally pentatonic trichord in which a perfect fourth was divided by a single &quot;infix&quot;—an additional note dividing the fourth into a semitone plus a major third (e.g., E, F, A, where F is the infix dividing the fourth E–A). Such a division of a fourth necessarily produces a scale of the type called pentatonic, because compounding two such segments into an octave produces a scale with just five steps. This became an enharmonic tetrachord by the division of the semitone into two quarter tones (E, E↑, F, A).
Archytas used 9:7 in all three of his genera; here it is the mediant of 4:3 and 5:4, as (4+5):(3+4) = 9:7:
 hypate parhypate lichanos mese
 4:3 9:7 5:4 1:1
 | 28:27 |36:35| 5:4 |
 -498 -435 -386 0 cents

Didymus uses the same major third (5:4) but divides the &quot;pyknon&quot; with the arithmetic mean of the string lengths (if one wishes to think in terms of frequencies, rather than string lengths or interval distance down from the tonic, as the example below does, splitting the interval between the frequencies 4:3 and 5:4 by their harmonic mean 31:24 will result in the same sequence of intervals as below):
 hypate parhypate lichanos mese
 4:3 31:24 5:4 1:1
 |32:31 |31:30 | 5:4 |
 -498 -443 -386 0 cents

This method splits the 16:15 half-step &quot;pyknon&quot; into two nearly equal intervals, the difference in size between 31:30 and 32:31 being less than 2 cents.

==Rhythmic genera==
The principal theorist of rhythmic genera was Aristides Quintilianus, who considered there to be three: equal (dactylic or anapestic), sesquialteran (paeonic), and duple (iambic and trochaic), though he also admitted that some authorities added a fourth genus, sesquitertian.

<text>The &quot;Independence&quot;-class aircraft carriers were a class of light carriers built for the United States Navy that served during World War II.

==Development==

Adapted from the design for the light cruisers, this class of ship resulted from the interest of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in naval air power. With war looming, Roosevelt, a former Assistant Secretary of the Navy, noted no new fleet aircraft carriers were expected to be completed before 1944. He proposed to convert some of the many cruisers then under construction to carriers. Studies of cruiser-size aircraft carriers had shown the type had serious limitations, and on 13 October 1941, the General Board of the United States Navy replied that such a conversion showed too many compromises to be effective.

Undeterred, President Roosevelt ordered another study. On 25 October 1941, the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Ships reported that aircraft carriers converted from cruiser hulls would be of lesser capability, but available much sooner. After the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, the need for more carriers became urgent. The Navy accelerated construction of the 34,000-ton s, but these large ships could not be finished quickly. The &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class light cruisers then under construction were adopted for this purpose.

Plans developed for this conversion showed much more promise than expected. Nine light cruisers were reordered as carriers in the first half of 1942. The &quot;Independence&quot;-class design had a relatively short and narrow flight deck and hangar, with a small island superstructure. The hangar, flight deck, and island represented a significant increase in the ship&#x27;s topside weight. To compensate for this, blisters were added to the original cruiser hull, which increased the original beam by . Ships of this class carried a small air group – only about 30 aircraft. This was originally set to consist of nine fighters, nine scout bombers, and nine torpedo bombers, but later revised to about two dozen fighters and nine torpedo bombers.

These were limited-capability ships, whose principal virtue was near-term availability. Their limited size made for seakeeping difficulties in the many typhoons of the Pacific, and their small flight decks led to a high aircraft accident rate. However, being based on a light cruiser, they were fast ships, much faster than the s. The cruiser hull and engineering allowed them the speed necessary to operate with the main fleet carrier task groups. Their names followed the US Navy&#x27;s policy of naming aircraft carriers after historic navy ships (&quot;Independence&quot;) or historic battles (&quot;Cowpens&quot;).

==Service==
Completed in the course of 1943, and coming into service with the first eight of the &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers, the nine &quot;Independence&quot;-class ships made up a vital component of the Fast Carrier Task Force, which carried the Navy&#x27;s offensive through the central and western Pacific from November 1943 through August 1945. Eight of these carriers participated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944, which effectively ended Japan&#x27;s carrier air power. The light carriers provided 40 percent of the Fast Carrier Task Force&#x27;s fighters and 36 percent of the torpedo bombers. The protection on these carriers was modest, and munitions often had to be stowed at the hangar level, a factor that contributed greatly to the loss of &quot;Princeton&quot; in October 1944.

==Ships in class==
The nine ships of the &quot;Independence&quot; class were all converted from &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class light cruisers building at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation shipyard, Camden, New Jersey. Initially classified as &quot;aircraft carriers&quot; (CV), all were re-designated &quot;small aircraft carriers&quot; (CVL) on 15 July 1943 while four ships were still under construction.

* &quot;Independence&quot; (CV/CVL-22) – Postwar, she was surplus to the Navy&#x27;s requirements and expended in the nuclear test Operation Crossroads in July 1946. The ship survived both tests with little damage. She was used as a radiation research hulk for several years afterward and expended as a target in January 1951.
* &quot;Princeton&quot; (CV/CVL-23) – Destroyed as a result of Japanese air attack 24 October 1944 during Battle of Leyte Gulf.
* &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; (CV/CVL-24) – Decommissioned to reserve in January, 1947. Transferred to French Navy as in June 1951. Returned to the US Navy for scrapping September 1960.
* &quot;Cowpens&quot; (CV/CVL-25) – Decommissioned to reserve in January, 1947. Stricken and scrapped starting November 1959.
* &quot;Monterey&quot; (CV/CVL-26) – Decommissioned to reserve February 1947. Recommissioned as training carrier September 1950, decommissioned to reserve again January 1956. Re-designated aircraft transport AVT-2 May 1959. Stricken June 1970.
* &quot;Langley&quot; CVL-27 – Decommissioned to reserve February 1947. Transferred to France as on 2 June 1951. Returned to USN and stricken March 1963, scrapped at Baltimore in 1964.

* &quot;Cabot&quot; CVL-28 – Decommissioned to reserve February 1947, recommissioned and modernised as anti-submarine warfare (ASW) carrier October 1948. Decommissioned to reserve January 1955, modernised 1965–1967 and transferred to Spain as on 30 August 1967. Stricken from Naval Vessel Register and sold to Spain August 1972. Decommissioned for preservation at New Orleans August 1989, preservation efforts failed. Scrapped at Brownsville, Texas starting October 2000.
* &quot;Bataan&quot; CVL-29 – Decommissioned to reserve February 1947, recommissioned and modernised as ASW carrier May 1950. Decommissioned to reserve April 1954. Stricken for scrapping September 1959.
*&quot;San Jacinto&quot; CVL-30 – Decommissioned to reserve March 1947. Stricken June 1970.

==Disposal==

There was little margin for growth, as the ships&#x27; post-war careers showed. &quot;Independence&quot; was expended as an atomic bomb target, and the rest were laid up in 1947. Five returned to service in 1948–53, two with the French Navy. Two were used as training carriers, while &quot;Bataan&quot; saw Korean War combat duty with Marine Corps air groups. She and &quot;Cabot&quot; received anti-submarine warfare modernizations in the early 1950s, emerging with two funnels instead of the original four. All but the French ships were decommissioned in 1954–56 and were reclassified as aircraft transports in 1959. &quot;Cabot&quot; got a new lease on life in 1967, when she became the Spanish Navy&#x27;s carrier &quot;Dédalo&quot;, serving until 1989 (in Spanish service, she was the first carrier to regularly deploy the Harrier jump jet). Despite efforts to preserve her, &quot;Cabot&quot; was scrapped at Brownsville in 1999–2003. Preservation efforts continued until the hull was half scrapped.

<text>Garrett Motion Inc., formerly Honeywell Transportation Systems and Honeywell Turbo Technologies, is an American company primarily involved in engineering, development and manufacturing of turbochargers and related forced induction systems for ground vehicles from small passenger cars to large trucks and industrial equipment and construction machinery. It originated as part of Garrett AiResearch&#x27;s Industrial Division in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1954, after which they entered a contract to provide 5,000 turbochargers for the Caterpillar mining vehicle. It manufactured turbochargers for railroads and commercial trucks. The business produced approximately $3.6 billion in revenue in 2021. Garrett Motion is also involved in motorsports providing turbochargers and forced induction systems, solutions and related equipment to racing teams and various forms of automobile racing and professional competitions. In 2004, the business became part of American industrial conglomerate Honeywell International, Inc., as their Transportation Systems division. In 2018, it was spun off to become an independent company under the Garrett Motion name with corporate headquarters in Rolle, Switzerland.

==History==
 John Clifford &quot;Cliff&quot; Garrett founded the Aircraft Tool and Supply Company in a one-room office in Los Angeles in 1936. In 1938, the company changed its name to Garrett Corporation, consolidating several companies into one with three divisions. The company produced aircraft turbochargers for the war effort in World War II, as well as avionics, environmental controls and other products.

In the 1950s, the city of Los Angeles and other municipalities started using turbochargers in their sewage purification operations. By 1952, 20,000 turbocharged engines were in use in the US. In order to explore applications of turbochargers for diesel engines, Garrett separated the turbocharger group from the gas turbine group on September 27, 1954, to form the AiResearch Industrial Division (AID).

The first T-15 Turbocharger was delivered to the Caterpillar Company in 1955. It was followed by an order for 5,000 production units, to be installed in the Caterpillar D9 tractor. The industrial division produced turbochargers for construction machinery, railroad locomotives, tractors, ships, powerplants and oil pipeline pumping stations.

The T11 automotive turbocharger developed in 1960 expanded turbos to commercial vehicles such as the heavy trucks produced by Mack Trucks, Volvo and Scania. The first turbocharged passenger cars were the Chevrolet Corvair Monza and the Oldsmobile Jetfire in 1962/1963. In the 1960s turbochargers were used in race-cars and sports cars, gaining an association with racing culture and auto-enthusiasts. Company founder Cliff Garrett&#x27;s death in 1963 was followed by a hostile takeover threat by Curtiss-Wright Corporation. To avoid this, Garrett Corporation merged with Signal Oil and Gas Company in 1964. The combined company adopted the name The Signal Companies in 1968 before merging with Allied Corporation to become Allied-Signal Inc.

The oil crisis of the 1970s made federal regulators put pressure on car manufacturers to reduce exhaust emissions. By 1977 manufacturers introduced turbocharged cars in the US and Europe like the second generation Buick Regal and LeSabre sports coupe as well as European cars by Volvo, Saab, Peugeot, Renault and Mercedes. In 1978 there were only eight turbocharged car models and seven used Garrett turbochargers. Garrett formed the automotive group in 1980 and by the mid-1980s there were over 100 turbocharged models. Turbochargers became commonplace by the 1990s.

In 1994, Allied-Signal acquired the Lycoming Turbine Engine Division of Textron followed by the sale of the Garrett Aviation Division to General Electric three years later. In 1999, it merged with Honeywell International Inc. and adopted Honeywell as the company name. In 2011, Honeywell sold its automotive Consumer Products Group to Rank Group, a New Zealand private investment firm, for $950 million. This included brands like Fram Filters, Prestone antifreeze and Autolite spark plugs.

In the 2000s Garrett&#x27;s turbochargers were installed in the engines of the Chevrolet Sonic, Mercedes S 350, Volkswagen Polo, BMW X6 ActiveHybrid, Ford F-350, Volkswagen Golf and Jaguar XF among others. In 2010 the company developed 15 new technologies for 100 new engines, including the world&#x27;s first use of ball bearing technology in a mainstream light vehicle diesel engine. Garrett has developed the world&#x27;s smallest turbo for the Tata Nano as well as for the 100-liter engine of the Caterpillar mining truck.

On October 1, 2018, Garrett Motion Inc. became an independent publicly-traded company through a pro rata distribution of Garrett shares to Honeywell&#x27;s stockholders. Each Honeywell stockholder of record received one share of Garrett common stock for every 10 shares of Honeywell common stock held on the record date. Approximately 74 million shares of Garrett common stock were distributed on October 1, 2018, to Honeywell stockholders.

On September 21, 2020, Garrett Motion announced its intention to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and be acquired by KPS Capital Partners.

In April 2021, Garrett emerged from Chapter 11, completing the restructuring process and implementing the restructuring plan that was confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York on April 23, 2021. The company raised 1.3 bln in equity during Chapter 11 restructuring.

==Turbo racing==
The Garrett brand competes in numerous motorsport series and supports sports car racing, drag racing, rally racing, and open-wheel racing. Racing vehicles using a Garrett turbo include:
==Technologies and products==

Garrett offers gasoline-powered turbochargers called wastegate turbos. They are designed to be smaller than previous turbo generations, have higher fuel efficiency, more torque, and meet emissions standards. Garrett also offers Variable-geometry turbochargers called VNT. They have nine moveable vanes, an electrohydraulic actuator and a proportional solenoid for variable control throughout the engine&#x27;s power curve. This means the air passageway of the turbo varies to meet the engine&#x27;s needs at different RPMs. Forty million VNT turbochargers have been sold since the 1990s. VNT DutyDrive, previously called Double Axle VNT, uses 12–19 turbine nozzle vanes supported by twin axles for trucks and buses.

Garrett also offers a diesel engine version of wastegate turbos and VNTs. Dual-stage turbochargers use two smaller turbochargers either side-by-side (parallel) or in sequence (serial). The first is used at low speeds and a valve opens up the second as engine RPMs increase. The dual-stage used in the Audi A6/A7 three liter V6 engine however runs both turbochargers at a lower pressure mode and some use one larger turbo followed by a smaller one. The Dualboost has dual compressors to mimic a twin turbocharger.

===Patents===
Garrett Motion has patented a single-cartridge, dual ball bearing technology, which uses a single sleeve system with a set of angular ball bearings on either end. This creates a rolling rather than sliding mechanism between parts intended to reduce the amount of pressure required to achieve airflow.

<text>This is a list of monarchs of [[Kingdom of Tahiti|Tahiti]], all of which belonged to the Pōmare dynasty. They carried the title &quot;Ari&#x27;i rahi&quot;.

== Monarchs of Tahiti ==
==Family tree==

==Current status ==
In 2006, Tauatomo Mairau claimed to be the heir to the Tahitian throne, and attempted to re-assert the status of the monarchy in court. His claims were not recognized by France. On 28 May 2009, Joinville Pōmare, an adopted member of the Pōmare family, declared himself King Pōmare XI, during a ceremony attended by descendants of leading chiefs but spurned by members of his own family. Other members of the family recognised his uncle, Léopold Pōmare, as heir to the throne.

He attempted to have royal trust lands returned to him and his family. The French government mortgaged the land after World War II, and in doing so violated the terms of the agreement signed with Pōmare V in 1880 which reserved control of the trust lands for the royal family of Tahiti. The banks may be in the process of freezing the assets, and Mairau sued to prevent native Tahitians from being evicted from his trust lands, and wished for them to retain their usage rights over the land.

<text>Al McKibbon (January 1, 1919 – July 29, 2005) was an American jazz double bassist, known for his work in bop, hard bop, and Latin jazz.

In 1947, after working with Lucky Millinder, Tab Smith, J. C. Heard, and Coleman Hawkins, he replaced Ray Brown in Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s band, in which he played until 1950. In the 1950s he recorded with the Miles Davis nonet, Earl Hines, Count Basie, Johnny Hodges, Thelonious Monk, Mongo Santamaria, George Shearing, Cal Tjader, Herbie Nichols and Hawkins. McKibbon was credited with interesting Tjader in Latin music while he played in Shearing&#x27;s group.

In 1999, the first album in his own name, &quot;Tumbao Para Los Congueros De Mi Vida&quot;, was released. McKibbon&#x27;s second album, &quot;Black Orchid&quot;, was released in 2004.

<text>The Dodge Omni and the nearly identical badge engineered variant, the Plymouth Horizon, is a subcompact car manufactured and marketed by Chrysler Corporation for model years 1978–1990. The first Chrysler model line produced with front-wheel drive, the Omni and Horizon were also the first front-wheel drive economy cars assembled in the United States. Marketed for eleven years with very few changes, around 2,500,000 Omnis and Horizons were manufactured, with the Plymouth variants more popular than the Dodge-branded models.

The first (and only) world car designed by Chrysler, the model line originated from a design of Chrysler Europe (who developed the namesake Chrysler Horizon). While visually similar, the American Omni/Horizon would have extensive functional differences from its European counterpart, primarily to accommodate US marketing and regulatory requirements.

From 1977 to 1990, Chrysler manufactured the Omni and Horizon at its Belvidere Assembly Plant facility (Belvidere, Illinois); from 1987 to 1989, the model line was manufactured under contract by American Motors Corporation (AMC) at its own facility in Kenosha, Wisconsin. From 1987 to 1990, the model line was marketed alongside its successor, the Dodge Shadow/Plymouth Sundance hatchback sedan.

In the early 1970s, Chrysler Corporation had repeatedly announced it would enter the North American small car market to compete with Chevrolet Vega, Ford Pinto and AMC Gremlin, by developing and manufacturing its own domestic small car, known as its &quot;Project R-429&quot; — only to repeatedly delay the project. 

In an attempt to stave off the U.S. small car competion, the company increased their stake to 77% of Simca in 1963 and had taken control of the Rootes Group by mid-1964, marketing numerous Simca and Rootes models, e.g. the Simca 1204 and Sunbeam Arrow via a new Simca-Rootes Division, formed in 1966
— with 850 dealers selling four Simca models and 400 dealers selling four Rootes models. Results were dismal, and in late 1969, Chrysler announced it would market its Rootes and Simca products directly via its Chrysler-Plymouth Division.

Chrysler introduced its newly developed Hillman Avenger to the U.S. and Canadian market for model years 1971-1973 as the rebadged &quot;Plymouth Cricket,&quot; directly via its Plymouth dealerships — as a 4-door saloon/sedan (and a 5-door station wagon for MY 1972). The Cricket, and the Mitsubishi-built Colt, marketed concurrently by Dodge dealerships, were both seen in the industry as stop-gap measures until Chrysler could design a small car to be domestically manufactured. The Cricket in particular failed to resonate in the market.

At the same time Chrysler marketed these captive imports, Chrysler executives denounced the concept of subcompact cars, Chrysler&#x27;s Chairman, Lynn A. Townsend saying &quot;the subcompacts are just too small, the American people won&#x27;t climb into them. They have to give up too much in creature comfort. 

In 1974, Townsend sent an American management team to Chrysler Europe to find a suitable small-car design for the U.S. market, ultimately rejecting a front-wheel drive compact (codenamed C6) as unsuitable for the U.S. production, the design subsequently manufactured in Europe as the Chrysler Alpine. At the end of 1974, Chrysler Europe approved the final clay model design of a shorter wheelbase version (codenamed C2) as a subcompact in the 1.3 L engine range. The C2 project provided multinational Chrysler Europe with a single model line to replace the outdated Simca 1100 and the Hillman Avenger.

The development of the Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon began life in 1975. Following the retirement of Townsend, Chrysler management decided to develop an American-market version of the C2 project, working in tandem with Chrysler Europe. While one American design team sought to redevelop the body as a coupe, designers ultimately retained the five-door hatchback, favoring its European-style configuration similar to the five-door Volkswagen Golf.

At the time, Chrysler Europe was splitting design and engineering work between France (chassis, powertrain, and manufacturing) and the United Kingdom (body design and development). Alongside component design for European use, American designers developed the C2 project to comply with local standards.

As part of the dire financial situation of its parent company, Chrysler Europe was sold to PSA Peugeot Citroën in August 1978. As part of the sale, Peugeot phased out the Chrysler brand in Europe in favor of a revived Talbot marque; the rebranded Horizon continued production (nearly unchanged) through 1987.

The sale of Chrysler Europe ended further design work on the C2 project; at the time, the company was seeking to expand the model line to a four-door sedan and a shorter-wheelbase three-door hatchback.

Notably, the front-wheel drive layout at this time had been largely reserved in the U.S. for low-volume luxury cars (including the Cadillac Eldorado and Oldsmobile Toronado). By 1976, Honda (with the Civic and the Accord) and Volkswagen (with the Rabbit) would become the first manufacturers to offer competitive front-wheel drive economy cars in the American market.

=== Transition to American design ===
To further develop the C2 project for the American market, Chrysler Corporation purchased nearly 100 Volkswagen Rabbits in the United States for the purposes of reverse engineering.

At the end of 1977, the C2 project entered production in both Europe and North America, with Chrysler Europe sharing the Horizon nameplate (as the Chrysler-Simca Horizon) with the American Plymouth division. While Chrysler had trailed the AMC Gremlin, Ford Pinto, and Chevrolet Vega to market by eight years, the $2,500 (US$ in ) Omni/Horizon provided the company an extensive headstart on its American competitors (which were released in 1981 and 1982, respectively) with the adoption of front-wheel drive, transverse-mount powertrains.

Following the 1978 sale of Chrysler Europe, Chrysler Corporation retained the design rights to its version of the C2 project and continued production in Illinois.

== Model overview ==
The Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon are five-door hatchbacks sold in North America. Introduced in January 1978, the model line was developed in tandem with Chrysler Europe, leading to the namesake Chrysler Horizon. Chrysler also sold multiple variants of the model line derived from the same chassis, including 2+2 coupes and coupe utility pickup trucks.

Produced nearly unchanged from the 1978 to the 1990 model years, Chrysler had beaten out Ford and General Motors to the market with a domestically produced front-wheel drive car to challenge the VW Rabbit.

=== Chassis ===

The Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon use the front-wheel drive Chrysler L platform on a 99.2-inch wheelbase (shared with its European namesake). Initially designed by Chrysler Europe, Chrysler Corporation made substantial changes to the suspension design for the American market. In contrast to the Chrysler Horizon, which has a front torsion bar suspension, the model line uses front MacPherson struts. The rear suspension uses a semi-independent twist-beam layout in contrast to the independent trailing arms on the European variant; both are coil-sprung in the rear.

The model line is equipped with power-assisted front disc brakes and rear drum brakes and a rack and pinion steering system.

==== Powertrain ====
While sharing a transverse engine layout, the Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon diverge furthest from the Chrysler Horizon in its engine offerings. At the time, Chrysler did not have capability to supply four-cylinder engines for the North American market (of any type), and the Simca-designed 1.1 to 1.4 L engines were deemed insufficient in terms of output. Instead, Chrysler adopted a 1.7 L I4, sourced from Volkswagen in the United States with a Chrysler-designed intake manifold. Torque was and the engine was paired with a 4-speed manual transmission or a 3-speed automatic. At the time of introduction, only the CARB-certified version with an air pump and had been available. In 1979 power climbed to , while by 1980 it dropped to and of torque in all fifty states.

Chrysler&#x27;s 2.2 L K-car engine appeared for the 1981 model year as an upmarket option to the Volkswagen engine, mated to a new four-speed manual with an overdrive fourth. It produced at first, rising to in 1986. For 1983, Chrysler introduced a Peugeot-supplied 1.6-liter Simca unit as a new base engine (requiring only an alternator to be added by Chrysler); the engine was paired with a manual transmission and the deletion of air conditioning. For 1987, the 1.6 was dropped, with the 2.2-liter becoming the standard engine offering. The 2.2 received fuel injection for 1988, accompanied by three additional horsepower. Latterly, the 2.2 L engine was paired to a 5-speed manual transmission or a 3-speed automatic.

Chrysler had planned on offering PSA&#x27;s new 1.9-liter diesel in the Omni/Horizon for the 1984 model year. Thanks to the implosion of the diesel market in North America, this never saw the light of day – although the engine was used in the European Horizon. For 1985, Chrysler had planned to build a &quot;fast-burn, high-swirl&quot; 1.8-liter four for the Omni as well as K-cars, but these plans also stalled.

=== Body ===
While sharing a visually similar appearance with its Chrysler Europe counterpart, the Omni/Horizon shares almost no body commonality. Along with the American requirement of sealed-beam headlamps, 5-mph bumpers, the body stampings are not shared between the two model line; for example, the joint between the roof and A-pillar on the American model line is welded together (on the European version, it is a single stamping). On the Omni/Horizon, the rear door windows do not roll down completely; the corresponding version of the Chrysler Horizon does (through a higher-cost, more complex design).

With the exception of grilles, taillamps, and model badging, the Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon were largely indistinguishable from one another. For 1984, the model line underwent a minor revision. Distinguished by revised exterior badging, the revision phased out a large degree of chrome exterior trim in favor of black-painted trim. The interior received a redesigned dashboard (a Rallye dashboard with full instrumentation was introduced as an option) and new seats; a 5-speed manual transmission became standard. For 1987, to streamline production, all vehicles received an instrument panel with tachometer, oil pressure, and voltmeter gauges.

For 1990, the Omni and Horizon underwent several minor revisions. Chrysler invested in a number of significant changes that ended up being used for only one year; the cars gained larger exterior rear-view mirrors borrowed from the departed M-body sedans in lieu of the original round units, and, to comply with federal passive-restraint regulations, a driver-side airbag was added along with rear-seat outboard shoulder belts. The instrument panel was mildly redesigned, complete with HVAC controls moved to the center, taking the place of the radio (which took the place of the ashtray).

=== Trim ===
In contrast to many Chrysler model lines, the Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon were largely sold across a single trim level. For 1981 and 1982, Chrysler introduced a &quot;Miser&quot; version; this lightly equipped version was developed to increase fuel economy, including an overdrive manual transmission.

For 1984, the SE (Sport Edition) option was introduced, which consisted of two-tone exterior paint. From 1984 to 1986, the Carroll Shelby Omni GLH, GLH-T, and GLHS (see below) were high-performance turbocharged versions of the Omni hatchback.

For 1987, the America edition of the Omni was introduced to compete with recent low-priced imports such as the Yugo and the Hyundai Excel. The price was dropped from $6,209 to $5,499, with &quot;$684 of added equipment at no cost&quot; according to Chrysler. The break-even point of the Omni America was 170,000 cars. To offer the vehicle as the lowest-price American-assembled subcompact, Chrysler reduced the number of options to two (air conditioning and a radio, three options if the California emissions package is included), while cutting the profit margin. Suppliers, United Auto Workers, Chrysler dealers, and even the State of Illinois also made concessions to help lower the price of the car.

== Production ==
From 1977 to 1990, Chrysler Corporation assembled the Omni and Horizon hatchbacks at Belvidere Assembly Plant (Belvidere, Illinois), which assembled the entire line of L-body vehicles, including the Dodge Omni 024, Plymouth Horizon TC3, Dodge Charger, Plymouth Turismo, Dodge Rampage, and Plymouth Scamp. The Omni and Horizon appeared at a critical time for Chrysler, when the company was on the brink of bankruptcy and sought government support to survive. However, the L-bodies miscarried at first, since 1978 was a year of strong sales for larger cars and demand for compacts and subcompacts noticeably shrank. These initial poor sales of the cars contributed to Chrysler&#x27;s financial woes at the time, but when the company requested federal assistance, the Omni was an important piece of evidence that they were attempting to compete with imports and build small, fuel-efficient cars and might be worth saving. For the three years leading up to the introduction of Chrysler&#x27;s K-cars, the Omni/Horizon was Chrysler&#x27;s best selling model line.

In 1985, Chrysler entered an agreement with American Motors Corporation (AMC) to produce Chrysler M-body vehicles at its Kenosha, Wisconsin facility (supplementing AMC production of Renault-badged vehicles). Alongside production of Chrysler&#x27;s M-body sedans (Dodge Diplomat/Plymouth Gran Fury/Chrysler Fifth Avenue), Chrysler and AMC agreed to add the L-body Omni and Horizon to the contract in 1987. M-body sedans were built at the Kenosha Main plant, while L-bodies were built at Kenosha Lakefront.

Production Figures:

==Variants==
Following the introduction of the five-door Omni/Horizon, Chrysler introduced several additional versions of the L-body platform, including the Dodge 024/Plymouth TC3 three-door hatchbacks (later the Dodge Charger/Plymouth Turismo) and the Dodge Rampage/Plymouth Scamp coupé utility pickup truck.

As a hot hatch, Chrysler introduced the turbocharged Omni GLH (later the Shelby GLH-S).

=== Dodge Omni 024/Dodge Charger ===
For 1979, Chrysler introduced a hatchback coupe version of the Omni/Horizon, named the Dodge Omni 024 and Plymouth Horizon TC3. Using an L-body chassis (shortened to a 96.6-inch wheelbase), the 024/TC3 coupes shared no external bodywork with the five-door hatchbacks. Sharing the same powertrain as the Omni and Horizon, the coupes were largely designed for appearance over performance. 

For 1982, the O24/TC3 were renamed Dodge Charger and Plymouth Turismo. While again offering the same powertrain as the five-door hatchbacks, the 2.2 L high-output engine was added to create the Dodge Shelby Charger/Plymouth Turismo Duster. For 1984, the coupes received updated exterior styling (distinguished by a quad-headlamp front fascia). For 1985 and 1986, the Shelby Charger adopted the engine of the Omni GLH-T.

Following the 1987 model year, the Dodge Charger/Plymouth Turismo were replaced by the Dodge Shadow/Plymouth Sundance; Dodge would not again remarket a Charger until the 2005 model year. The final 1000 Dodge Shelby Chargers were built as Shelby Charger GLHS vehicles with a 2.2 L Turbo II engine, upgraded transmission, brakes, and suspension, and the deletion of all Dodge badging.

=== Dodge Rampage/Plymouth Scamp ===
For 1982, Chrysler introduced a coupe utility pickup derived from the L-body chassis, named the Dodge Rampage. The first front-wheel drive American pickup truck, the Rampage extended the Dodge Omni chassis to a 104.2-inch wheelbase. To compete with the payload of the larger Chevrolet El Camino, Chrysler redesigned the rear frame and suspension of the L-body for the Rampage, with the vehicle receiving a leaf-sprung rear axle.

For 1983 the Plymouth Scamp was introduced alongside the Dodge Rampage, distinguished primarily by badging and trim; the Scamp was offered only for 1983. For 1984, the Rampage received the quad-headlight front fascia of the Dodge Charger and block-letter badging.

===Dodge Omni GLH===
The highest-performance Dodge Omni was the 1984–1986 Omni GLH, modified by Carroll Shelby. Following the rejection of &quot;Coyote&quot; by Chrysler, the initials GLH (&quot;Goes Like Hell&quot;, the choice of Carroll Shelby) were used instead.

For 1984, the Omni GLH adopted many of the modifications of the 1983 Shelby Charger, including its 2.2 L &quot;high-output&quot; I4, stiffer suspension, larger brakes and wider tires. For 1985 and 1986, Shelby offered the GLH with an optional 2.2 L Turbo I I4 (GLH-T); 1986 vehicles are largely distinguished by their center brake light.

==== Shelby GLH-S ====

Shelby Automobiles purchased the final 500 1986 GLH-T (all in black) and used them as the basis for the 1986 Shelby GLHS (&quot;Goes Like Hell S&#x27;more&quot;). Modified by the company in California, the GLHS vehicles were legally sold as Shelbys. The Turbo I engine underwent extensive modification, adopting multiple components of what would become the Turbo II engine introduced for 1987. Along with an intercooler, the engine received a larger turbocharger and throttle body, tuned intake and exhaust manifolds, a new wiring harness, and a new radiator and engine fan (among other engine modifications). The suspension was upgraded further, receiving stiffer springs, and adjustable Koni struts and shocks, along with larger tires mounted on Shelby-designed wheels. In contrast to the red pinstripes of the GLH/GLH-T, the GLHS used silver pinstripes and badging; a &quot;Shelby&quot; decal was added to the windshield and a large GLHS decal was added to the driver-side C-pillar (the passenger-side C-pillar was occupied by the gas cap door).

== Legacy ==

At the time of its 1978 launch, the Omni and Horizon would play a significant role in the survival of Chrysler Corporation. While initially struggling against rebounding sales of larger vehicles, nearly 200,000 examples of the combined model line were sold in the first model year. In contrast to most Chrysler model lines, the Plymouth Horizon would outsell the Dodge Omni (some years, by a significant margin), with the exception of the final 1989 and 1990 model years.

As the Omni/Horizon became the best-selling Chrysler model line between 1978 and 1980, it would play a major role in Chrysler securing government-backed funding in 1979. The model line was evidence that Chrysler was attempting to develop more fuel-efficient vehicles competitive with automakers around the world. Along with ensuring the continued survival of the company, the $1.5 billion loans ($ in ) allowed Chrysler to finish the development of its compact/mid-size K-Car program and its minivans, two of its most profitable model lines during the 1980s.

== Awards ==
Following its launch, the Dodge Omni was awarded the 1978 &quot;Motor Trend&quot; Car of the Year Award. In a similar fashion, the 1978 Chrysler Horizon was voted European Car of the Year for 1979.

== Consumer Reports review ==
Shortly after their introduction, Consumer Reports tested the Omni and Horizon and reported that it lost control in hard maneuvering. As front-wheel-drive cars were still considered a new idea in the American automotive industry, the allegation received extensive mainstream coverage, including a piece in &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Other automotive media reported no problems and said the Consumer Reports test did not approximate real-world driving conditions. In response to the &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; article, Chrysler modified the car to add a steering damper and a lighter-weight steering wheel.

<doc id="851963" wikidata="Q3517153" url="?curid=851963" title="Tehaapapa III">
<text>Princess Teri&#x27;inavaharoa (8 August 1879 – 27 April 1917) was the last sovereign monarch of the Kingdom of Huahine and Mai&#x27;ao from 1893 to 1895. Comteporary sources seems to call her Tehaapapa II instead, disregarding the ruling queen by the same name at the time James Cook visited the island.

==Biography==
Teha&#x27;apapa III was a member of a royal Tahitian dynasty, the deposed royal family Teururai of Huahine.

As a Tahitian Princess, she became Queen of Huahine. 

She was the last Queen of Huahine from 1893 to 1895. She was the eldest daughter of Marama Teururai, prince regent of Huahine by his wife Tetuanuimarama a Teuruari&#x27;i, Princess of Rurutu. 

She was crowned with the regnal name Teha&#x27;apapa III in 1893, and was deposed when Huahine was annexed by the French in September 1895.

==Marriage==
She married first at Fare on 15 May 1895 (divorced 6 August 1897) to His Highness Teriitevaearai a Mai, a descendant of Mai, of the Princely House of Bora Bora, and secondly on 1900 to a native minor noble man called Tinitua a Tuariihi&#x27;onoa . 

She had one son by her first husband and eleven other natural children through a morganatic union with Tinitua a Tuariihi&#x27;onoa.

She died at Fare, 27 April 1917.

<text>Pumping stations, also called pumphouses, are public utility buildings containing pumps and equipment for pumping fluids from one place to another. They are critical in a variety of infrastructure systems, such as water supply, drainage of low-lying land, canals and removal of sewage to processing sites. A pumping station is an integral part of a pumped-storage hydroelectricity installation.

Pumping stations are designed to move water or sewage from one location to another, overcoming gravitational challenges, and are essential for maintaining navigable canal levels, supplying water, and managing sewage and floodwaters. In canal systems, pumping stations help replenish water lost through lock usage and leakage, ensuring navigability. Similarly, in land drainage, stations pump water to prevent flooding in areas below sea level, a concept pioneered during the Victorian era in places like The Fens in the UK. The introduction of &quot;package pumping stations&quot; has modernized drainage systems, allowing a compact, efficient solution for areas where gravity drainage is impractical.

Water pumping stations are differentiated by their applications, such as sourcing from wells, raw water pumping, and high service pumping, each designed to meet specific demand projections and customer needs. Wastewater pumping stations, on the other hand, are engineered to handle sewage, with designs that ensure reliability and safety, minimizing environmental impacts from overflows. Innovations in pump technology and station design have led to the development of submersible pump stations, which are more compact and safer, effectively reducing the footprint and visibility of sewage management infrastructure. Electronic controllers have enhanced the efficiency and monitoring capabilities of pumping stations, essential for modern systems. Pumped-storage schemes represent a critical use of pumping stations, providing a method for energy storage and generation by moving water between reservoirs at different elevations, highlighting the versatility and importance of pumping stations across sectors.

Some pumping stations have been recognized for their architectural and historical significance, e.g. the Claverton and Crofton Pumping Stations, are preserved as museum attractions. Examples such as land drainage in the Netherlands water supply in Hong Kong and agricultural drainage in Iraq, underscore the vital role these facilities play in supporting modern infrastructure, environmental management, and energy storage.

==Canal water supply==
In countries with canal systems, pumping stations are also frequent. Because of the way the system of canal locks work, water is lost from the upper part of a canal each time a vessel passes through. Also, most lock gates are not watertight, so some water leaks from the higher levels of the canal to those lower down. The water has to be replaced or eventually the upper levels of the canal would not hold enough water to be navigable.

Canals are usually fed by diverting water from streams and rivers into the upper parts of the canal, but if no suitable source is available, a pumping station can be used to maintain the water level. An example of a canal pumping station is the Claverton Pumping Station on the Kennet and Avon Canal in southern England, United Kingdom. This pumps water from the nearby River Avon to the canal using pumps driven by a waterwheel which is powered by the river.

Where no external water supply is available, back pumping systems may be employed. Water is extracted from the canal below the lowest lock of a flight and is pumped back to the top of the flight, ready for the next boat to pass through. Such installations are usually small.

==Land drainage==
When low-lying areas of land are drained, the general method is to dig drainage ditches. However, if the area is below sea level then it is necessary to pump the water upwards into water channels that finally drain into the sea.

The Victorians understood this concept, and in the United Kingdom they built pumping stations with water pumps, powered by steam engines to accomplish this task. In Lincolnshire, large areas of wetland at sea level, called The Fens, were turned into rich arable farmland by this method. The land is full of nutrients because of the accumulation of sedimentary mud that created the land initially.
Elsewhere, pumping stations are used to remove water that has found its way into low-lying areas as a result of leakage or flooding (in New Orleans, for example).

===Package pumping station===
In more recent times, a &quot;package pumping station&quot; provides an efficient and economic way of installing a drainage system. They are suitable for mechanical building services collection and pumping of liquids like surface water, wastewater or sewage from areas where drainage by gravity is not possible.

A package pumping station is an integrated system, built in a housing manufactured from strong, impact-resistant materials such as precast concrete, polyethylene, or glass-reinforced plastic. The unit is supplied with internal pipework fitted, pre-assembled ready for installation into the ground, after which the submersible pumps and control equipment are fitted. Features may include controls for fully automatic operation; a high-level alarm indication, in the event of pump failure; and possibly a guide-rail/auto-coupling/pedestal system, to permit easy removal of pumps for maintenance.

Traditional site constructed systems have the valve vault components installed in a separate structure. Having two structural components can lead to potentially serious site problems such as uneven settling between components which results in stress on, and failure of the pipes and connections between components. The development of a packaged pump station system combined all components into a single housing which not only eliminates uneven settling issues, but pre-plumbing and outfitting each unit prior to installation can reduce the cost and time involved with civil work and site labor.

== Water pumping stations ==
Water pumping stations are differentiated from wastewater pumping stations in that they do not have to be sized to account for high peak flow rates. They have five general categories:

* Source (such as a well) pump discharging into an elevated tank
* Raw water pumping from a river or lake
* In-line booster pumping into an elevated tank
* High service pumping of finished water at high pressure
* Distributed system booster without a storage tank in the piping system

Water pumping stations are constructed in areas in which the demand or projected demand is reasonably defined, and is dependent on a combination of customer needs and fire flow requirements. Average annual per-capita water consumption, peak hour, and maximum daily can vary greatly due to factors such as climate, income levels, population, and the proportions of residential, commercial, and industrial users.

==Wastewater pumping stations==

Pumping stations in sewage collection systems are normally designed to handle raw sewage that is fed from underground gravity pipelines (pipes that are sloped so that a liquid can flow in one direction under gravity). Sewage is fed into and stored in a pit, commonly known as a &quot;wet well&quot;. The well is equipped with electrical instrumentation to detect the level of sewage present. When the sewage level rises to a predetermined point, a pump will be started to lift the sewage upward through a pressurized pipe system called a &quot;sewer force main&quot; if the sewage is transported some significant distance. The pumping station may be called a &quot;lift station&quot; if the pump merely discharges into a nearby gravity manhole. From here the cycle starts all over again until the sewage reaches its point of destination—usually a treatment plant. By this method, pumping stations are used to move waste to higher elevations. In the case of high sewage flows into the well (for example during peak flow periods and wet weather) additional pumps will be used. If this is insufficient, or in the case of failure of the pumping station, a backup in the sewer system can occur, leading to a sanitary sewer overflow—the discharge of raw sewage into the environment.

Sewage pumping stations are typically designed so that one pump or one set of pumps will handle normal peak flow conditions. Redundancy is built into the system so that in the event that any one pump is out of service, the remaining pump or pumps will handle the designed flow. The storage volume of the wet well between the &quot;pump on&quot; and &quot;pump off&quot; settings is designed to minimize pump starts and stops, but is not so long a retention time as to allow the sewage in the wet well to go septic.

Sewage pumps are almost always end-suction centrifugal pumps with open impellers and are specially designed with a large open passage so as to avoid clogging with debris or winding stringy debris onto the impeller. A four pole or six pole AC induction motor normally drives the pump. Rather than provide large open passages, some pumps, typically smaller sewage pumps, also macerate any solids within the sewage breaking them down into smaller parts which can more easily pass through the impeller.

The interior of a sewage pump station is a very dangerous place. Poisonous gases, such as methane and hydrogen sulfide, can accumulate in the wet well; an ill-equipped person entering the well would be overcome by fumes very quickly. Any entry into the wet well requires the correct confined space entry method for a hazardous environment. To minimize the need for entry, the facility is normally designed to allow pumps and other equipment to be removed from outside the wet well.

Traditional sewage pumping stations incorporate both a wet well and a &quot;dry well&quot;. Often these are the same structure separated by an internal divide. In this configuration pumps are installed below ground level on the base of the dry well so that their inlets are below water level on pump start, priming the pump and also maximising the available NPSH. Although nominally isolated from the sewage in the wet well, dry wells are underground, confined spaces and require appropriate precautions for entry. Further, any failure or leakage of the pumps or pipework can discharge sewage directly into the dry well with complete flooding not an uncommon occurrence. As a result, the electric motors are normally mounted above the overflow, top water level of the wet well, usually above ground level, and drive the sewage pumps through an extended vertical shaft. To protect the above ground motors from weather, small pump houses are normally built, which also incorporate the electrical switchgear and control electronics. These are the visible parts of a traditional sewage pumping station although they are typically smaller than the underground wet and dry wells.

More modern pumping stations do not require a dry well or pump house and usually consist only of a wet well. In this configuration, submersible sewage pumps with closely coupled electric motor are mounted within the wet well itself, submerged within the sewage. Submersible pumps are mounted on two vertical guide rails and seal onto a permanently fixed &quot;duckfoot&quot;, which forms both a mount and also a vertical bend for the discharge pipe. For maintenance or replacement, submersible pumps are raised by a chain off of the duckfoot and up the two guide rails to the maintenance (normally ground) level. Reinstalling the pumps simply reverses this process with the pump being remounted on the guide rails and lowered onto the duckfoot where the weight of the pump reseals it. As the motors are sealed and weather is not a concern, no above ground structures are required, excepting a small kiosk to contain the electrical switchgear and control systems.

Due to the much reduced health and safety concerns, and smaller footprint and visibility, submersible pump sewage pumping stations have almost completely superseded traditional sewage pumping stations. Further, a refit of a traditional pumping station usually involves converting it into a modern pumping station by installing submersibles in the wet well, demolishing the pump house and retiring the dry well by either stripping it, or knocking down the internal partition and merging it with the wet well.

== Electronic controllers ==
Pump manufacturers have always designed and manufactured electronic devices to control and supervise pumping stations. Today it is also very common to use a programmable logic controller (PLC) or Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) for such work, but the experience needed to solve certain particular problems, makes an easy choice to look for a specific pump controller.
RTUs are very helpful in remote monitoring of each pumping station from a centralized control room with SCADA (Supervisory Control &amp; Data Acquisition) systems. This setup can be helpful in monitoring pump faults, levels, and other alarms and parameters, making it more efficient.

==Pumped-storage schemes==

A pumped-storage scheme is a type of power station for storing and producing electricity to supply high peak demands by moving water between reservoirs at different elevations.

Typically, water is channeled from a high-level reservoir to a low-level reservoir, through turbine generators that generate electricity. This is done when the station is required to generate power. During low-demand periods, such as overnight, the generators are reversed to become pumps that move the water back up to the top reservoir.

<text>Carlos Paredes (; 16 February 1925 – 23 July 2004) was a virtuoso Portuguese guitar player and composer. He is regarded as one of the greatest players of Portuguese guitar of all-time.

Born in Coimbra, Portugal, in a family with a long tradition of guitar playing, he was taught to play the Portuguese guitar by his father, Artur Paredes. He composed numerous soundtracks for cinema and theatre, such as the soundtrack for the Portuguese film &quot;Os&quot; &quot;Verdes Anos&quot; (1963), which contains his famous piece &quot;Canção Verde Anos&quot;. He released several recordings as a solo artist and performed in numerous countries worldwide.

Besides his music career, Paredes also worked in the public service for most of his life. In 1958, during Portugal&#x27;s dictatorial Estado Novo regime, he was imprisoned for 18 months for joining the Portuguese Communist Party, at the time an illegal organization.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Carlos Paredes was born in Coimbra on 16 February 1925. His father was Artur Paredes, an acclaimed player of Portuguese guitar from Coimbra. His grandfather Gonçalo Paredes, his great-uncle Manuel Paredes and his great-grandfather António Paredes were also guitar players.

Around 1934, aged 9, Paredes and his family moved to Lisbon. He did his primary education at the João de Deus School, and afterwards attended the Passos Manuel Lyceum. While attending the lyceum, he had violin and piano lessons. In 1943, he entered the Chemical-Industrial Engineering Course in Instituto Superior Técnico, but was enrolled for only one year.

He started playing guitar when he was 4 years-old, taught by his father. At age 9, he began accompanying his father on the guitar, in his father&#x27;s concerts. At age 14, Carlos and Artur Paredes started participating on a weekly show in the Emissora Nacional de Radiodifusão, Portugal&#x27;s public national radio broadcaster, a show that was created by Artur Paredes himself.

In 1949, he became a public service worker, a job he would retire from only later in life, in November 1986. He worked in the radiography archive of the Hospital de São José, in Lisbon, while maintaining his musical career.

=== Political affiliation and imprisonment ===
Paredes grew up in an environment of discreet resistance and political opposition to António Salazar&#x27;s Estado Novo regime. In 1958, he became a member of the Portuguese Communist Party, which at the time was an illegal organization in Portugal.

In the morning of 26 September 1958, he was arrested by PIDE agents in his workplace in Hospital de São José, on the accusation of belonging to an illegal political party opposing the government. He was kept imprisoned for 18 months. During his time in prison, he composed music in his head. According to some sources, people in the prison thought that Paredes was going insane, walking around his cell pretending to play the guitar, when in fact he was composing.

After his release from prison, he was suspended from his job in the hospital and worked for some years as a delegate of medical propaganda.

After the Carnation Revolution in Portugal, like others who had been political prisoners during the Estado Novo regime, Paredes was seen as a hero. He disliked this status and preferred not to talk about his time in prison, saying that there were people who suffered more than him. He was reinstated to his previous job in the Hospital de São José shortly after the revolution.

Paredes remained a member of the Portuguese Communist Party until his death.

=== Music career ===

==== 1950s and 1960s ====
Paredes&#x27; first release was a self-titled EP in 1957. He was accompanied by Fernando Alvim on the classical guitar. After this first record, the musical partnership between Paredes and Alvim would last for more than 20 years.

During the 1960s, Paredes composed the soundtracks for numerous Portuguese films. He composed the soundtrack for the 1963 film &quot;Os&quot; &quot;Verdes Anos&quot;, directed by Paulo Rocha. The piece &quot;Canção Verdes Anos&quot;, which is part of this soundtrack and was also included in his first studio album, became one his most recognizable works. He also composed the soundtracks for the film &quot;Fado Corrido&quot; (1964), by Jorge Brum do Canto, the film &quot;Mudar de Vida&quot; (1966), by Paulo Rocha, and contributed to the soundtrack of several short-films: &quot;Rendas de Metais Preciosos&quot; (1960)&quot;,&quot; by Cândido Costa Pinto; &quot;P.X.O.&quot; (1962), by Pierre Kast and Jacques Valcroze; &quot;As Pinturas do Meu Irmão Júlio&quot; (1965), by Manoel de Oliveira; &quot;Crónica do Esforço Perdido&quot; (1966), by António de Macedo; &quot;À Cidade (The City)&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Colombus Route&quot; (1969), by José Fonseca e Costa; and &quot;Tráfego e Estiva&quot; (1968), by Manuel Guimarães.

In theatre, he collaborated with José Cardoso Pires and Fernando Gusmão in 1964, with Carlos Avillez in the play &quot;Bodas de Sangue&quot; and performances of García Lorca&#x27;s &quot;The House of Bernarda Alba&quot; by Teatro Experimental de Cascais.

His first studio album, &quot;Guitarra Portuguesa&quot;, was released in 1967. That same year, he played alongside Amália Rodrigues in her show at the Olympia in Paris, by her invitation. Amália, who was very impressed with his talent, wished to have Paredes accompany her in her touring band, but Paredes declined, citing his father&#x27;s advice: &quot;If you want to be soloist, you must accompany no-one&quot;. Still, the two remained lifelong friends.

In 1968 he released three EPs: &quot;Porto Santo&quot;, &quot;Divertimento&quot; and &quot;Variações em Ré menor&quot;.

==== 1970s ====
In 1970 he released a collaboration album with Cecília de Melo, titled &quot;Meu País.&quot; In 1971, he released his second solo album, &quot;Movimento Perpétuo&quot;.

Between 1971 and 1977, he composed the music for Agustin Cuzzani&#x27;s play &quot;O Avançado Centro Morreu ao Amanhecer,&quot; performed by the Campolide Theatre Group. He also selected the soundtrack for the group following shows.

After the Carnation Revolution of 1974 in Portugal, he toured Europe. He participated in several events promoted by the Portuguese Communist Party, playing shows in Portugal and Eastern Europe. His music was used in the television coverage of the country&#x27;s first democratic elections for the Assembly of the Republic, in 1975. In 1975 he released the album &quot;É Preciso um País&quot; with poet Manuel Alegre.

Around 1975, Paredes was working on the successor for &quot;Movimento Perpétuo.&quot; The recording sessions were interrupted and resumed several times because of Paredes&#x27; dissatisfaction with his recordings. Eventually, the initial plans for the album were abandoned, but some of the recordings from these sessions were selected by Paredes for a release named &quot;O Oiro e o Trigo.&quot; However, his record label Valentim de Carvalho did not agree with it, and this was the basis for his breakup with Valentim de Carvalho. &quot;O Oiro e o Trigo&quot; was ultimately released in East Germany in 1980.

==== 1980s ====
In 1982 his piece &quot;Danças Para Uma Guitarra&quot; was choreographed by Vasco Wellenkamp for the Gulbenkian Ballet.

In 1983 Paredes released the live album &quot;Concerto em Frankfurt,&quot; recorded in a concert at the Frankfurt Opera.

In 1986 he released a collaboration album with Portuguese composer António Victorino de Almeida, titled &quot;Invenções Livres&quot;.

In 1987 he released a new solo album, &quot;Espelho de Sons&quot;, which reached 3rd place in the Portuguese weekly album charts. It was followed by &quot;Asas Sobre o Mundo,&quot; in 1989.

==== 1990s ====
In 1990 Paredes released an album with American jazz bassist Charlie Haden, titled &quot;Dialogues.&quot;

His last show was in October 1993 at the Aula Magna, in Lisbon, accompanied by Luísa Amaro.

After retiring from music and public life, he release two more albums from previously unreleased material: &quot;Na Corrente&quot; (1996), containing pieces recorded between 1969 and 1973 at the Valentim de Carvalho studios, and &quot;Canção para Titi&quot; (2000)&quot;,&quot; with recordings from 1993.

=== Illness and death ===

In December 1993, Paredes was diagnosed with myelopathy. The disease forced Paredes to stop playing guitar, thus ending his career as a musician. He was interned at the Fundação-Lar Nossa Senhora da Saúde, in Campo de Ourique, Lisbon, until his death.

Paredes died on 23 July 2004, in Lisbon. Following his death, the Portuguese government declared one day of national mourning in his honour. He lays buried at the Prazeres Cemetery, in Lisbon.
== Personal life ==
Carlos Paredes was married two times. He married Ana Maria Napoleão Franco, in 1960. His second marriage was with Cecília de Melo. He had six children.

He is remembered for his humbleness by those who knew him. He refused to solely make a living as a musician and kept his job in the radiography archive of the Hospital de São José until the age of 61, stating that he &quot;loved music too much to live from it&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Carlos Paredes is regarded as one of the greatest Portuguese guitarists of all-time and a genius of the Portuguese guitar. He is frequently called &quot;The master of the Portuguese guitar&quot; (Portuguese: &quot;O mestre da guitarra portuguesa&quot;) and &quot;The man with the thousand fingers&quot; (Portuguese: &quot;O homem dos mil dedos&quot;). Acclaimed fado singer Amália Rodrigues said that Paredes was &quot;a national monument, like the Jerónimos Monastery&quot;.

Several buildings in Portugal are named after Paredes. The Carlos Paredes Prize, an award for Portuguese musicians given by the Vila Franca de Xira municipality since 2003, is named after him.

== Awards and honors ==
In 1992, Carlos Paredes was awarded the title of Commander of the Military Order of Saint James of the Sword by the President of Portugal.

<text>Warren Ellis (born 14 February 1965) is an Australian musician and composer. He is a member of the rock groups Dirty Three and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. He performed with the band Grinderman until its disbandment in 2013, and has composed film scores with long-time friend, collaborator and band-mate Nick Cave. Ellis plays the violin, piano, accordion, bouzouki, guitar, flute, mandolin, mandocello and viola. He has been a member of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds since 1994.

==Life and career==
Ellis was born in Ballarat, Victoria. He has said that he came to music by accident: while playing at the local tip, he found an abandoned piano accordion. He took it to school and his teacher showed him how to play it. He later learned classical violin and flute at school in Ballarat.

After winning a scholarship to a private high school, Ellis went to university in Melbourne, where he studied classical violin. After that he then worked briefly as a schoolteacher in country Victoria. In January 1988 he travelled to Europe, where he busked in Greece, Hungary, Scotland and Ireland. A year later he returned to Australia. Ellis then wrote music for theatre groups and performed at art openings and plays in Melbourne, before he started playing in bands in the early nineties.

In 1992, Ellis formed The Dirty Three with guitarist Mick Turner and drummer Jim White. As of 2018 the band has recorded nine studio albums, including several to appear on the ARIA charts in their native Australia.

In 1993, Ellis was invited to play with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds as part of a small string ensemble for several songs on &quot;Let Love In&quot; (released 1994). He soon joined the band as a full-time member, initially emphasising violin but gradually adding many other instruments. Ellis eventually co-wrote many of the band&#x27;s songs and became a pivotal collaborator with singer Nick Cave in film scores and other projects. Ellis was also a member of Grinderman, a side-group from the Bad Seeds, who have released two albums.

In 2002, Ellis released a solo album on King Crab records called &quot;Three Pieces for Violin&quot;. Since 2005 he has played on several Marianne Faithfull albums. Nick Cave and Warren Ellis composed the award-winning score of the film &quot;The Proposition&quot;, and collaborated again on the scores of &quot;The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford&quot;, &quot;The Road&quot;, and &quot;Far from Men&quot;.

In 2009, Nick Cave and Warren Ellis released &quot;White Lunar&quot; – an album that includes other soundtrack scores.

Following the release of &quot;Carnage&quot;, Ellis and Nick Cave toured Europe in the autumn of 2021 and the United States in the spring of 2022.

Ellis has lived in Paris since 1998 with his French wife and their two children.

In 2021, Ellis and his wife announced the purchase of a parcel of land in Sumatra, which they donated to the non-profit Jakarta Animal Aid Network. Ellis Park Wildlife Sanctuary is adjacent to the existing Sumatra Wildlife Centre, and specialises in animals who need lifetime care and cannot survive in the wild. &quot;Ellis Park&quot;, a documentary about Ellis and the sanctuary was directed by Justin Kurzel.

<text>Karl Muck (October 22, 1859 – March 3, 1940) was a Hessian-born conductor of classical music. He based his activities principally in Europe and mostly in opera. His American career comprised two stints at the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO). Muck endured a trial by media in 1917, after &quot;Providence Journal&quot; editor John R. Rathom falsely accused him of knowingly refusing a request to have the BSO play the &quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot; following American entry into World War I. Although Muck was a citizen of neutral Switzerland, he was arrested based on Rathom&#x27;s accusation and incarcerated as an enemy alien at Fort Oglethorpe, a German-American internment camp in Georgia from March 1918 until August 1919. Karl Muck and his wife were then deported from the United States. His later career included notable engagements in Hamburg and at the Bayreuth Festival.

==Early life and career==

Karl Muck was born in Darmstadt, which was then the capital of the Grand Duchy of Hesse, in modern Germany. Muck&#x27;s father, a senior court official and amateur musician, moved the family to Switzerland in 1867 and acquired Swiss citizenship. Karl Muck acquired Swiss citizenship when he was 21. Muck studied piano as a child and made his first public appearance at the age of 11 when he gave a piano solo at a chamber music recital. He also played the violin in a local symphony orchestra as a boy. He graduated from the gymnasium at Würzburg and entered the University of Heidelberg at 16. In May 1878 he entered the University of Leipzig, where he took his degree as Doctor of Philosophy in 1880. While there studied music at Leipzig Conservatory. He made his formal debut as a concert pianist on February 19, 1880, at the Leipzig Gewandhaus in Xaver Scharwenka&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor with Arthur Nikisch conducting.

He began his conducting career in comparatively minor provincial cities, starting in 1880 as Second Conductor (&quot;Zweiter Kapellmeister&quot;) in Zurich (Aktientheater), moving to Salzburg (k.k. Theater) in October 1881 as Principal Conductor (&quot;Erster Kapellmeister&quot;), where he served until April 1882. He then held appointments in Brünn (Stadttheater: October 1882 to June 1883) and Graz (1884–1886), where he married 21-year-old Anita Portugall on February 3, 1887. His first position in a major musical center came in Prague as Principal Conductor at Angelo Neumann&#x27;s Deutsches Landestheater, starting with a performance of &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; on August 15, 1886, and ending in June 1892. He also conducted Neumann&#x27;s traveling opera company, appearing at Berlin and in 1888–1889 conducting Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; cycle in Moscow and St. Petersburg. He left Prague to become principal conductor in October 1892 of the Berlin Court Opera (Kgl. Oper — today the Berlin State Opera, where he was appointed Chief Musical Director (&quot;Kgl. preußischer Generalmusikdirektor&quot;) on August 26, 1908. He remained in Berlin until 1912, conducting 1,071 performances of 103 operas. He also conducted the Royal Orchestra in concerts there.

He took other assignments during his tenure in Berlin. He was guest conductor at the Silesian music festivals in Goerlitz between 1894 and 1911. In May and June 1899 at London&#x27;s Royal Opera House Covent Garden, he conducted Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot; and several of Wagner&#x27;s operas (&quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot;, &quot;Der fliegende Höllander&quot; and &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;). He devoted many summers to the Wagner Festival in Bayreuth where he became principal conductor in 1903, after serving as a musical assistant since 1892. He succeeded Hermann Levi as the conductor of &quot;Parsifal&quot; there. As war approached in the summer of 1914, Muck insisted on performing &quot;Parsifal&quot; on August 1, 1914, to close the Festival, which was not revived until 1924. Muck conducted &quot;Parsifal&quot; at all of the fourteen Bayreuth festivals held between 1901 and 1930, and also conducted &quot;Lohengrin&quot; there in 1909 and &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; in 1925, becoming a close friend of the Wagner family. The American music critic Herbert Peyser (1886-1953) thought Muck&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;Parsifal&quot; the greatest he had ever heard: &quot;the only and ultimate &quot;Parsifal&quot;; the &quot;Parsifal&quot; in which every phrase was charged with infinities; the &quot;Parsifal&quot; which was neither of this age nor that age but of all time.&quot; He led the Vienna Philharmonic from 1903 to 1906 and the Boston Symphony Orchestra from 1906 to 1918, and took visiting assignments in other cities, including Paris, Madrid, Copenhagen, Brussels.

Muck was offered the Metropolitan Opera House podium in New York at a reputed $27,000 a year, but declined. From 1903 to 1906 he alternated with Felix Mottl as conductor of the Vienna Philharmonic. At the Panama-Pacific International Exhibition held in San Francisco May 14–26, 1915, Muck conducted the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 13 concerts of music of all nations.

==Conducting==
Solo performers praised his work with them. Artur Schnabel called Muck: &quot;a very great master, whose reliability, maturity and selfless dedication are not equaled by any living artist.&quot; Paderewski called him &quot;an ideal accompanist&quot;. In physical terms, his conducting style required minimal movement, only small gestures with the tip of his baton. In areas of interpretation he was one of the first modernists. Though old enough to be part of generation known for taking liberties with the score and indulging in flexible tempos, he was by contrast disciplined and direct, less concerned with placing his personal stamp on a score than on demonstrating fidelity to the score and ceding a certain interpretative anonymity. By contrast with his conducting style, orchestra players found him impatient, explosive, nervous, and impulsive. He showed no casual or relaxed side of himself at concerts, rather &quot;he dominated the orchestra and the audience and the occasion.&quot; The Austrian conductor Karl Böhm said in a 1972 interview: &quot;Karl Muck by chance heard me direct &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, and he invited me to study all Wagner&#x27;s scores with him. He was the first and greatest influence on me ... Muck told me where the orchestra should be more prominent, how to handle the Bayreuth acoustics, and so on.&quot;

==Boston, 1906–1918==
Muck served as music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) from 1906 to 1908 and then again from 1912 to 1918 (with a yearly salary of 28,000 dollars as the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported on March 26, 1918). Initially he had to work to expand his repertoire from the operas and German music he concentrated on in Europe. Olin Downes later wrote that &quot;his repertory was unequal to the demands of his audience&quot; so he relied on members of the BSO for coaching in French works. Contemporary works were not his strong suit, though he dutifully programmed music that was not to his own taste, such as the American premiere of Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Five Pieces for Orchestra&quot;. He also introduced some Sibelius symphonies and many works of Debussy to Boston. Despite his restrained style, he occasionally revealed his romantic side in a work like Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Faust Symphony&quot;. On his death the &quot;New York Times&quot; said that in Boston &quot;he built a virtuoso orchestra.&quot;

Why he chose to work in America is unknown. In Berlin he was on close personal terms with Kaiser Wilhelm, but American gossip held that he preferred his freedom and for that reason refused the post of director of the royal opera in Munich in 1911. His life in Boston appeared unremarkable and he guest conducted at the Bayreuth Festival as the conductor of the BSO. Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity made him an honorary member in 1916 and he judged a piano competition in the spring of 1917. On October 2–5, 1917, he led the BSO in historic recordings for the Victor Talking Machine Company in Camden, New Jersey. The sessions included works by Tchaikovsky, Wolf-Ferrari, Berlioz, Beethoven, and Wagner.

Philip Hale, music critic of the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; during Muck&#x27;s years there, wrote: &quot;He stands there calm, undemonstrative, graceful, elegant, aristocratic; a man of singularly commanding and magnetic personality even in repose. The orchestra is his speech, the expression of the composer&#x27;s music as it appeals to the conductor&#x27;s brain, heart and soul.&quot;

==National Anthem controversy==
After American entry into World War I in the spring of 1917, Muck offered to resign his position as music director of the BSO. He anticipated that his natural sympathies for Germany, where he was born and spent most of his career despite his Swiss citizenship, might give offense. Henry Lee Higginson, the orchestra&#x27;s founder and financer, declined it and instead signed Muck to another five-year contract. Muck had fears for his own safety, but Higginson gave him assurances that as an apolitical artist he had nothing to fear. Even so, Muck became very sensitive to avoid giving offense. The orchestra&#x27;s publicity manager later wrote: &quot;A good and patriotic German, he had become greatly attached to this country, and altogether he was a thoroughly unhappy man.&quot; Nevertheless, he continued his former practice and programmed concerts of Classical music only by German and Austro-Hungarian composers on his first tour of American cities following U.S. entry into the war, which some found not at all sensitive to the public&#x27;s mood in wartime.

In the fall of 1917, some orchestras like the New York Orchestra Society started performing &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at all their concerts. Members of the BSO management team discussed programming the anthem for weeks, but without any sense of the issue&#x27;s importance. Moreover, the orchestra&#x27;s manager, Charles A. Ellis, did not want to embarrass Muck by asking him to conduct the anthem, particularly given Muck&#x27;s close attachment to his birthplace and his past personal friendship with the last Kaiser.

The BSO performed regularly at Infantry Hall in Providence, Rhode Island, where John R. Rathom, the unscrupulous and openly Pro-British editor of the &quot;Providence Journal&quot; had been attacking Muck for his past ties to the last Kaiser. The BSO&#x27;s managers anticipated there might be trouble during their October 1917 visit. One member of the management team later said that Major Higginson, the BSO&#x27;s chairman, was &quot;pugnacious&quot; while Ellis, the manager, was &quot;rather nervous&quot; as they joined the orchestra on the trip. Higginson took measures to protect Muck&#x27;s safety in the case of serious trouble.

On October 30, 1917, the day of the concert, the &quot;Providence Journal&quot; published an editorial that said &quot;Professor Muck is a man of notoriously pro-German affiliations and the programme as announced is almost entirely German in character.&quot; Rathom also demanded that the BSO to perform the National Anthem that night &quot;to put Professor Muck to the test.&quot; About to leave Boston for Providence, Higginson and Ellis received two requests, one from a local patriotic organization and another from the heads of local music clubs, asking the BSO to play the anthem. Muck never saw the request, but Higginson and others viewed it as the work of John R. Rathom, editor and publisher of the &quot;Providence Journal&quot;, whose motto was &quot;Raise hell and sell newspapers.&quot; They dismissed the request without much consideration and the concert went off without incident. Muck only learned of the petition on the orchestra&#x27;s train ride back to Boston that same night. Shocked and somewhat fearful, he said he did not object to playing the anthem, that it was fitting for him as a guest in America to accommodate the wishes of his host country.

Now that the BSO had failed to play the anthem, Rathom created the false narrative that Muck had known of the request and had refused to perform it, accused Muck of treason (sic) and called him a German spy and a hater of all things American.

Similarly to Rathom&#x27;s many other fake news publicity stunts, the Muck story instantly took on a life of its own. As the orchestra publicity manager wrote years later of Muck, &quot;his fate, so far as America was concerned, was settled that night in Providence because of the short-sighted stubbornness of Henry L. Higginson and Charles A. Ellis.&quot; The American Defense Society demanded Muck&#x27;s immediate arrest and internment. The Orchestra found its November Baltimore engagement canceled, with even Cardinal Gibbons adding his voice to denunciations of Muck. 

Just as he had following the 1891 New Orleans lynchings, former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt took fake news in print at face value and also publicly denounced the maestro. Rival conductor Walter Damrosch, the music director of the New York Symphony Society (later the New York Philharmonic), also denounced Muck&#x27;s &quot;cynical disregard of the sanctity of our national air&quot;, which Damrosch alleged showed disrespect for the emotions of his audience and led to a disrespect for the great heritage of German music.

Meanwhile, Major Higginson claimed responsibility for the BSO&#x27;s initial failure to play the anthem, with little effect on the outrage stirred by the now nationwide press coverage. He visited the Washington, D.C. headquarters of the Department of Justice and received assurances that the government had no issue with any member of the orchestra. He tried to present the issue as one of artistic freedom, saying he would rather disband the orchestra than allow anyone to dictate its programming for political reasons. Muck took a similarly apolitical artistic stance with the statement: &quot;Art is a thing by itself, and not related to any particular nation or group. Therefore, it would be a gross mistake, a violation of artistic taste and principles for such an organization as ours to play patriotic airs. Does the public think that the Symphony Orchestra is a military band or a ballroom orchestra?&quot;

Back in Boston, the BSO found curiosity and support. On November 2, 1917, the crowd that filled a Friday afternoon concert at Symphony Hall read a program insert announcing that the national anthem would follow every BSO concert and applauded when Higginson appeared. Higginson announced that Muck had once again tendered his resignation so that &quot;no prejudice against him may prejudice the welfare of the orchestra&quot; and Higginson had yet to accept it. The audience then greeted the entry of Muck with a standing ovation and rose to applaud again after he led the orchestra in a performance of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;.

The &quot;New York Times&quot; pointed out that the entire affair could have been avoided if Higginson and Muck had had a better sense of the public sentiment. They should have anticipated the request for the anthem and should have programmed it in the first place. The paper blamed the entire affair on Muck and &quot;the then obstinate management of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.&quot;

In November, the BSO performed in New York City, where at last Higginson and Ellis reluctantly gave in to Muck&#x27;s insistence on playing the anthem. Critics were not completely satisfied and criticized the arrangement Muck used as &quot;cheap&quot; and &quot;undignified&quot; without realizing it was the work of Victor Herbert, who in addition to his popular Broadway operettas had also written serious symphonic works and conducted both the New York Philharmonic and the Pittsburgh Symphony. When the orchestra returned to New York in December, Muck used a new arrangement that proved a critical success. It was the work of BSO concertmaster Anton Witek, &quot;the most pro-German of all the Germans in the orchestra.&quot;

== Internment ==
Muck was arrested on March 25, 1918, just before midnight and therefore the BSO&#x27;s performances of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Saint Matthew Passion&quot; on March 26 and April 2, which Muck had been preparing for months, had to be conducted by Ernst Schmidt. Government officials were free to ignore the fact that he was a citizen of neutral Switzerland and the bearer of a Swiss passport, since the law sanctioned the arrest of those born in any of the German States before the 1871 founding of the German Empire without respect to citizenship. Boston police and federal agents also searched Muck&#x27;s home at 50 Fenway and removed personal papers and scores. They suspected the conductor&#x27;s markings in the score of the &quot;St. Matthew Passion&quot; were coded messages proving that Muck was a German spy. As part of German-American internment, he was imprisoned at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia. The Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity that had elected him to national honorary membership in 1916 expelled Muck in 1919 for allegedly sympathizing with the Central Powers.

Fellow internees had heard that Muck had decided in protest to never conduct in America again, but they persuaded him that the camp was more of a German village — which was facetiously dubbed &quot;Orglesdorf.&quot; A memoir of the event written in 1940 recalled the mess hall packed with 2000 internees, with honored guests like their doctors and government censors on the front benches, facing 100 musicians. Under Muck&#x27;s baton, he wrote, &quot;the &quot;Eroica&quot; rushed at us and carried us far away and above war and worry and barbed wire.&quot;

On August 21, 1919, an agent of the U.S. Department of Justice put Muck and his wife aboard a ship bound for Copenhagen. Before sailing from New York Harbor, Muck told reporters: &quot;I am not a German, although they said I was. I considered myself an American.&quot; He admitted, however, to having &quot;bitter feelings&quot; toward certain American newspapers over their biased and inaccurate treatment of him. He also expressed doubts that the BSO, which was in a sorry state of organization, would ever recover after the similar internment of 29 of its best musicians.

Meanwhile, the American media&#x27;s smear campaign continued. Later that year the &quot;Boston Post&quot; alleged that Muck had been having an extramarital affair with soprano Rosamond Young, a 20-year-old in Boston&#x27;s Back Bay and had written her a letter reading in part: &quot;I am on my way to the concert hall to entertain the crowds of dogs and swine who think that because they pay the entrance fee they have the right to dictate to me my selections. I hate to play for this rabble ... [In] a very short time our gracious Kaiser will smile on my request and recall me to Berlin ... Our Kaiser will be prevailed upon to see the benefit to the Fatherland of my obtaining a divorce and making you my own.&quot;

After his deportation, Karl Muck declined all subsequent invitations to return to the United States.

== Later career, 1919–1933 ==
Muck returned to a different Germany. The recent German Revolution of 1918–1919 made him &quot;a man in marked disfavor with the republican government.&quot; The death of his beloved wife Anita on April 14, 1921, left him &quot;infinitely lonesome&quot;. Muck eventually took the helm of the Hamburg Philharmonic Orchestra in 1922 and made additional recordings. He returned to Bayreuth when the festival was revived there in 1924, the representative of the pre-war tradition. He expressed his devotion to the Festival and Wagner&#x27;s music in a letter advising Fritz Busch that all he needed to succeed there was &quot;the unassuming humility and the holy fanaticism of the Believer.&quot; He was also engaged in Munich, Amsterdam (Concertgebouw Orchestra) and Salzburg (&quot;Don Giovanni&quot; in 1925).

In September 1930, he resigned his position at Bayreuth, much to the distress of Winifred Wagner, who had just succeeded her late husband Siegfried Wagner as the Festival&#x27;s director. He never accommodated himself to being upstaged by Toscanini, but writing privately to Winifred Wagner, he said he had been committed to serving her husband, but the Festival now required someone other than &quot;I, whose artistic standpoint and convictions, so far as is concerned, stem from the preceding century.&quot; Muck also resigned his Hamburg position in 1933, as censorship in Nazi Germany began to affect the performance of Classical music in ideological ways that made Muck deeply uncomfortable.

His last noteworthy appearance came in February 1933 at a concert marking the 50th anniversary of Wagner&#x27;s death, given at Leipzig and with Adolf Hitler among those in attendance. His final concert was on May 19, 1933, with the Hamburg Philharmonic. In October 1939, Muck &quot;on his 80th birthday in Berlin received from Adolf Hitler the Plaque of the German Eagle&quot; with the inscription DEM GROSSEN DIRIGENTEN (TO THE GREAT CONDUCTOR).

A widower since 1921, whose only child, a son, had died young, Muck spent his last years at the Stuttgart home of Baroness von Scholley, the daughter of his close friend and fellow Fort Oglethorpe internee, who had served the German Foreign Office as Consul General in New York City. Partially paralyzed from nicotine poisoning and immersing himself in Oriental philosophy, he rarely left the house during the last three years of his life. Muck died in Stuttgart, Germany on March 3, 1940, at the age of 80. Upon receipt of the news of his death, the BSO interrupted a rehearsal to stand in silent tribute to his memory. Geraldine Farrar wrote a letter to the &quot;New York Times&quot; recalling that she sang with him and the Boston Symphony on the night when Muck was &quot;bitterly and unjustly assailed&quot; for not playing the National Anthem and adding: &quot;As your editorial correctly reports, he knew nothing of the request.&quot; She continued: &quot;The fortunes of war brought Dr. Muck — as well as other aliens — no disgrace in an internment camp. I saw Dr. Muck several times in later years and I know he counted the years with the Boston Symphony Orchestra among the happiest and most fruitful of his career.&quot;

== Recordings ==
Muck&#x27;s reputation rests largely on his recorded legacy. In October 1917 he made a series of sound recordings in the US with the Boston Symphony Orchestra for the Victor Talking Machine Company in their Camden, New Jersey auditorium. Unusually for the time (when the pre-electric purely mechanical “acoustic” process was in use) the orchestra seems to have been recorded at full strength as the 1919 Victor catalogue refers to &quot;approximately a hundred men&quot;. Eight short pieces spread over ten 78 r.p.m. sides were selected, including excerpts from Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 7, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Symphony No. 4 and two items from Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Damnation of Faust.&quot;

Muck&#x27;s most important recordings were made at the 1927 Bayreuth Festival for the English Columbia Gramophone Company and in 1927 to 1929 in Berlin for the Gramophone Company (HMV). At Bayreuth sometime between late June and mid-August 1927, he conducted about 30 minutes of excerpts from Acts 1 and 2. His control of phrasing in the Transformation and Grail scenes is regarded as unsurpassed to this day. In December 1927 he led the Berlin State Opera Orchestra in an account of the opera&#x27;s Prelude, one of the slowest on record. A year later, in December 1928, he made a nearly complete recording of the third act of , using the Parsifal and Gurnemanz singers from that year&#x27;s Bayreuth performances. The music critic Alan Blyth described this as &quot;the most uplifting, superbly executed reading of Act 3 ... in the history of recording&quot; and Robin Holloway commented that &quot;It realizes better than any other Wagner performance the idea of endless melody&quot;. In all about 40% of the opera&#x27;s score was recorded over the -year period. HMV also recorded eight further Wagner orchestral pieces, including the &quot;Siegfried Idyll&quot;, with the Berlin State Opera Orchestra in December 1927, May 1928, and November 1929. These have been reissued on various CDs.

A discography of Muck&#x27;s original commercial recordings, not including reissues, appeared in 1977.

Several radio recordings allegedly conducted by Muck also exist, including a &quot;Faust Overture&quot; and () with the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra and an excerpt from the Adagio of Bruckner&#x27;s Symphony No. 7 with the Hamburg Philharmonic.

<doc id="852003" wikidata="Q16999058" url="?curid=852003" title="Lambuth University">
<text>Lambuth University was a private Methodist university in Jackson, Tennessee. It was active from 1843 to 2011 and was supported by the Memphis Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church. The university began as the Memphis Conference Female Institute in 1843 and was later renamed in honor of Walter Russell Lambuth (1854–1921), a Methodist missionary who traveled globally.

After several years of financial struggles, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools opted not to renew Lambuth&#x27;s accreditation in 2011. Due to both the financial and accreditation problems, the Board of Trustees voted in April 2011 to cease operations two months later. Final commencement exercises were held April 30, 2011. The University of Memphis acquired the campus which is now the Lambuth branch campus of the University of Memphis.

==Athletics==
The Lambuth athletic teams were called the Eagles. They participated in dual membership with both the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) and the NCAA Division II ranks, primarily competing as an NAIA Independent within the Association of Independent Institutions (AII) and an NCAA D-II Independent in transition as a provisional member from 2008–09 to 2010–11. The Eagles previously competed as full members for the TranSouth Athletic Conference (TranSouth or TSAC) from 2006–07 to 2007–08, and for the Mid-South Conference (MSC) from 1995–96 to 2005–06; both from the NAIA.

Lambuth competed in 11 intercollegiate sports: Men&#x27;s sports included baseball, basketball, football, golf, soccer and tennis; while women&#x27;s sports included basketball, golf, soccer, softball and tennis.

<doc id="852018" wikidata="Q670054" url="?curid=852018" title="William Henry Flower">
<text>Sir William Henry Flower (30 November 18311 July 1899) was an English surgeon, museum curator and comparative anatomist, who became a leading authority on mammals and especially on the primate brain. He supported Thomas Henry Huxley in an important controversy with Richard Owen about the human brain and eventually succeeded Owen as Director of the Natural History Museum in London.

==Origins and early years==
Born on 30 November 1831 in his father&#x27;s house at Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire, he was the second son of Edward Fordham Flower, founder of the town brewery, and his wife Celina Greaves (18041884), eldest daughter of John Greaves and his wife Mary Whitehead. His paternal grandfather Richard Flower had married Elizabeth Fordham and settled at Albion, Illinois, where his father grew up.

His uncles included the slate entrepreneur John Whitehead Greaves and William Pickering, Governor of Washington. His elder brother Charles Edward Flower ran the family brewery with the third brother Edgar Flower, while he chose a scientific career.

First taught at home by his mother, he went to a school in Edgbaston at the age 11 and then from age 13 to a Pestalozzian school at Worksop under a Swiss headmaster, Dr B. Heldenmaier. There were ten hours schooling each day which included, rare at that time, science. Already a collector of natural history objects, he was made curator of the school museum and for almost all the rest of his life was a museum curator of one kind or another.

He then attended University College, London, followed by the Middlesex Hospital, where he studied medicine and surgery. Graduating as an MB of London University in 1851, he won a gold medal in physiology and a silver in zoology and comparative anatomy. In 1852 he read his first paper before the Zoological Society of London, of which he was made a Fellow.

==Medical career==
Appointed a junior house surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital, after six months he was promoted to senior house surgeon and in 1854 passed the exam to become an MRCS (Member of the Royal College of Surgeons). Also in 1854 he became Curator of the Middlesex Hospital Museum.

However, with the outbreak of the Crimean War that year, he joined the British Army and was appointed as Assistant-Surgeon to the 63rd (West Suffolk) Regiment of Foot. Embarking at Cork in July 1854, they sailed for Constantinople and then on to the Crimea, landing at Kalamita Bay in August. Within four months, the regiment was reduced in strength by almost one half from cold, exposure, infectious disease and, lastly, enemy action. His own health broke down and he had to be invalided home, never fully recovering. In recognition of his services, he received from the hands of Queen Victoria the Crimea Medal with clasps for Alma, Inkerman, Balaclava, and Sebastopol. Later, he received the Turkish Crimean War medal as well.
When fit to work he returned to London, taking the diploma to become an FRCS (Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons) in 1857 and joining the staff of the Middlesex Hospital as a Demonstrator in Anatomy. In 1858 he married, and during the next year became Assistant-Surgeon at the Middlesex, curator of the Anatomical Museum and also Lecturer on Comparative Anatomy. In his 1859 lecture to the Royal United Services Institute on practical surgery for naval and military officers, as a direct result of his Crimean experience he summarised the first aid knowledge needed by soldiers and sailors to help the wounded before a surgeon was available.

==The evolution debate==
In 1860, intellectual circles in London were alive with talk of evolution. Long interested in the wider sphere of natural history rather than just human physiology, he decided to move his career in that direction. A probable influence was Thomas Henry Huxley, also a comparative anatomist and Fullerian Professor at the Royal Institution at the time, and his first contact with Huxley came through the naval surgeon, zoologist, and palaeontologist George Busk.

With Huxley he became engaged in controversy with Richard Owen, who claimed that the human brain had unique structures not present in simians. Huxley had contradicted this at the British Association meeting at Oxford in 1860, which included a debate on evolution, and promised proof. He was among experts consulted by Huxley and gave demonstrations at Huxley&#x27;s public lectures, using monkey brains rather than scarce ape brains. He published papers on the brains of four species of monkey, and at the 1862 meeting of the British Association in Cambridge, after Owen read a paper repeating his claims, stood up saying &quot;I happen to have in my pocket a monkey&#x27;s brain&quot; and produced the object in question.

In the evolution debate he was among those who, like his wife&#x27;s brother-in-law. the Reverend Professor Baden Powell, saw no threat to religious belief in accepting the theory. In 1883 he expounded his view in an address to the Church Congress in Reading under the title: &quot;The bearing of science on religion&quot;.

==Transfer to zoology==
On the recommendation of Huxley and others, in 1862 he became Conservator of the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, holding the post for 22 years, and in 1864 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

In 1870 he became Hunterian Professor of Comparative Anatomy, in succession to Huxley, and began a series of lectures that ran for fourteen years, all on aspects of the Mammalia. The essence was published in his books of 1870 and 1891. He was elected President of the Zoological Society of London in 1879, holding the post for life, and in 1882 was awarded the Royal Medal of the Royal Society. From 1883 to 1885 he was President of the Anthropological Institute.

==Natural History Museum==

In 1884, on the retirement of Sir Richard Owen, he was appointed to the directorship of what were then the Natural History departments of the British Museum in South Kensington. The four departments of Zoology, Botany, Mineralogy and Geology each had its own Keeper, who was largely autonomous from the Director, who was himself subject to the Principal Librarian and to the Trustees of the British Museum. Facing a wide array of personalities to contend with and a heavy load of administrative duties, he was a more or less instant success, testifying to his strong but tactful personality.

In 1889 he showed his devotion by installing a statue of Charles Darwin in the Museum. In that year he was chosen as President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, having previously headed its biological section in 1878 and its anthropological section in 1881 (being chosen again in 1894). In 1893 he served as President of the Museums Association.

In 1895, in addition to his role as Director he took over the post of Keeper of Zoology, holding it until his retirement. He immediately set about rearranging the zoological galleries according to the theories he had evolved on effective presentation by de-cluttering the exhibits, ensuring each specimen had an easy-to-read label, and placing each stuffed animal beside its skeleton and remains of its extinct allies in order to give the displays depth and context.

==Other contributions to knowledge==

Beyond his continuing interest in primates, he became an expert on the Cetacea, that is the whales and their relatives. He carried out dissections, went out on whaling boats, studied discoveries of whale fossils, and established a whale room at the Natural History Museum with skeletons and plaster casts.
 It was he who made public the &quot;absolute and complete destruction of two species of right whale by the reckless greed of the whalers&quot;.

He made valuable contributions to structural anthropology, for example by publishing complete and accurate measurements of 1,300 human skulls, and as a comparative anatomist in the field of Mammalia he ranked high. He was the first person to show that lemurs are primates.

He was a leading authority on the arrangement of museums. He insisted on the importance of distinguishing between collections intended for the use of specialists and those designed for the instruction of the general public, pointing out that it was as futile to present to the former a number of merely typical forms as to provide the latter with a long series of specimens differing only in the most minute details. His ideas, which were largely and successfully applied to the museums of which he had charge, gained wide approval and entitle him to be seen as a reformer who did much to improve methods of museum arrangement and management.

He also laboured for wider access to museums, both by educated people who needed to know more about the rapidly developing world of science and by ordinary people whose mental horizons could be expanded. He personally led conducted tours for groups across the social spectrum, from royalty at one end to working men at the other.

He became a public figure, his lectures being crowded and his views influential. In a study of deliberate deformation of the human body in various cultures, he included corsets and high heels, illustrating the effects with pictures of distorted female skeletons. Horrified at the widespread slaughter of birds to provide feathers for fashionable hats, he said of the egret: &quot;one of the most beautiful of birds is being swept off the face of the earth under circumstances of peculiar cruelty, to minister to a passing fashion.&quot; Which led Beatrix Potter to write: &quot;I wonder what Sir W Flower&#x27;s speciality is besides ladies&#x27; bonnets.&quot;

In 1869, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

==Family and personal life==
Flower married Georgiana Rosetta Smyth, on 15 April 1858, at Stone in Buckinghamshire. Georgiana was the youngest daughter of Admiral William Henry Smyth, an astronomer and hydrographer, and his wife Eliza Anne (Annarella) Warington. Flower and Georgiana had four daughters and three sons, including the zoologist Stanley Smyth Flower (18711946). He and his wife led an active life outside his work, over the years meeting many leading figures in British society. Among their friends were the poet laureate Alfred, Lord Tennyson and the leading churchman Dean Stanley.

Having been created a Companion of the Bath in 1887, three years after his first appointment to the Museum, he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 1892. He also received the Jubilee Medal and the Royal Prussian order &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;.

Illness and overwork led him to take retirement from the Natural History Museum in August 1898 and he died at his home in South Kensington on I July 1899, aged 67. His remains were buried with his wife&#x27;s family at Stone in Buckinghamshire.

<doc id="852020" wikidata="Q6059891" url="?curid=852020" title="Inventor's notebook">
<text>An inventor&#x27;s notebook is used by inventors, scientists and engineers to record their ideas, invention process, experimental tests and results and observations. It is not a legal document but is valuable, if properly organized and maintained, since it can help establish dates of conception and reduction to practice. It may be considered as grey literature. The information can improve the outcome of a patent or a patent contestation.

== Purpose==

A patent grants its owner(s) the right to sue those who manufacture and market products or services that infringe on the claims declared in the patent. Typically, governments award patents on either a &quot;first to file&quot; or &quot;first to invent&quot; basis. Therefore, it is important to keep and maintain records that help establish who is first to invent a particular invention.

The inventor&#x27;s notebook (also called a journal, lab book or log book) is a systematic device for recording all information related to an invention in such a way that it can be used to develop a case during a patent contestation or patent-related lawsuit.

The notebook is also a valuable tool for the inventor since it provides a chronological record of an invention and its reduction to practice. Each entry must be signed and dated by a witness. The witness should not be someone with a conflict of interest (such as a research partner). If an inventor ever has to go to court to prove that they were the first to make the invention, then the witness would be called to the stand to testify that the signature is theirs and they signed that page on that date.

A &quot;virtual inventor&#x27;s notebook&quot;, in which one scans note pages and emails them to oneself, would not provide the same legal protection as a since it is easier to commit fraud with a virtual notebook.

The need for an inventor&#x27;s notebook will diminish in the future as the United States is progressively implementing a first-to-file system pursuant to the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. It has been said that first-to-file eliminates a troubling source of litigation, particularly for individual inventors who may lack the processes and legal resources to defend against evidentiary challenges by large corporate research organizations.

== Famous notebooks ==

Though not necessarily following all the guidelines above, journals and notebooks have been kept by many famous inventors, scientists and engineers. Some of the most well-known journals include those of:
* Leonardo da Vinci
* Galileo Galilei
* Evangelista Torricelli
* Alessandro Volta
* Thomas A. Edison
* Thomas Jefferson
* Albert Einstein
* Nikola Tesla
* Frederic Tudor

<text>Aloisius Joseph Muench (February 18, 1889 – February 15, 1962) was an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Bishop of Fargo from 1935 to 1959, and as Apostolic Nuncio to Germany from 1951 to 1959. He was elevated to the cardinalate in 1959.

Muench was the most powerful American Catholic and Vatican representative in Allied-occupied Germany and subsequently in West Germany from 1946 to 1959 as the liaison between the U.S. Office of Military Government and the German Catholic Church in the American occupation zone (1946–1949), Pope Pius XII&#x27;s apostolic visitor to Germany (1946–1947), the Vatican relief officer in Kronberg im Taunus, Germany (1947–1949), regent in Kronberg (1949–1951), as well as nuncio to Germany.

==Early life and education==
Muench was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Joseph Muench and Theresa Kraus on February 18, 1889, the first of seven surviving children. His father&#x27;s ancestors were from Sankt Katharina in the Bohemian Forest near the Bavarian border, what is now Svatá Kateřina in the Czech Republic. His father, a baker, emigrated to Milwaukee at age 18 in 1882. His mother was born in Kemnath in the Upper Palatinate region of Bavaria and emigrated to Milwaukee in 1882 at age 14; Muench&#x27;s parents married in 1888.

The family lived on the north side of Milwaukee among other German Catholic immigrants, his parents speaking only German in the home. Muench began his training for the priesthood at age 14, entering Saint Francis Seminary in 1904. He was ordained on June 8, 1916, in the Archdiocese of Milwaukee and assigned to Saint Michael&#x27;s parish.

He left Milwaukee in 1917 to become the assistant chaplain of Saint Paul&#x27;s University Chapel at the University of Wisconsin (now University of Wisconsin–Madison), where he obtained a masters in economics in 1918.

In 1919 Muench entered the University of Fribourg in Switzerland, earning a doctorate &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in July 1921 in the social sciences, focusing on theological disciplines of economics, social morality, and social ethics. He was a member of K.D.St.V. Teutonia Fribourg (Switzerland), a Catholic student fraternity that is part of the Cartellverband der katholischen deutschen Studentenverbindungen.

The archbishop of Milwaukee granted Muench permission to remain in Europe to study at University of Leuven (Belgium), Cambridge, Oxford, the London School of Economics, the Collège de France, and the Sorbonne. Muench returned to St. Francis Seminary in 1922 as a professor. In 1929, he ceased his teaching duties to become a rector. Muench was promoted to the rank of monsignor in September 1934.

==Bishop of Fargo (1935–1959)==

On August 10, 1935, Pope Pius XI appointed Muench the third bishop of the Diocese of Fargo, North Dakota; he was consecrated on October 15, 1935, and installed on November 6, 1935.

Muench accompanied Archbishop Samuel Stritch to Rome when the latter was created cardinal by Pope Pius XII in 1946, and purchased the red hat Stritch received in the ceremony. In a meeting with the pope, Stritch recommended Muench for the role of apostolic visitor in Germany, because of his &quot;sympathy&quot; for the &quot;suffering of the German people&quot;.

When Muench returned to the United States, he was offered the additional position of liaison between the U.S. post-war occupation authorities in Germany (the Office of Military Government, United States Zone, OMGUS) and the German Catholic Church, also on the recommendation of Stritch, after Anthony Strauss, the first choice of the Truman administration, turned the appointment down.

==Post-war Germany (1946–1951)==
Pope Pius XII appointed Muench apostolic visitor to Germany in 1946. From 1946 to 1949, he served as military vicar delegate of the United States armed forces, and from 1949 to 1951, he was the regent of the nunciature in Germany; back in Fargo, from 1947 onward, Leo Ferdinand Dworschak, the auxiliary bishop, served as apostolic administrator. Muench also served as &quot;liaison consultant for religious affairs to the military governor&quot;, appointed by Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson. The German nunciature had been vacant since the death of Cesare Orsenigo in 1946. Muench assumed the &quot;de facto&quot; role of nuncio before he received the title on March 6, 1951.

According to Barry&#x27;s biography, Muench focused on three goals: the Vatican mission for Catholic displaced persons and prisoners of war (funded by American donations brokered by Muench); maintaining the validity of the &quot;Reichskonkordat&quot; (a 1933 treaty between the Vatican and Nazi Germany); and the autonomy of German Catholic schools.

Historian Michael Phayer views Muench&#x27;s dual appointment as significant: &quot;Muench&#x27;s position was extraordinary. At one and the same time, he was President Truman&#x27;s Catholic liaison to OMGUS and Pius XII&#x27;s personal envoy to zonal Germany. Serving two masters, he listened to Rome, not Washington from the moment of his arrival in Germany&quot;.
===&quot;One World in Charity&quot;===
Muench&#x27;s pastoral letter &quot;One World In Charity&quot; was published in installments (in the U.S. first in January 1946, and in occupied Germany one year later). The 10,200 word letter was read from the diocese of Fargo&#x27;s pulpits weekly on the five Sundays between Shrove Tuesday and Passion Sunday, and then translated into German and printed first in German language newspapers in the United States. Truncated versions of &quot;One World&quot;, focusing on Muench&#x27;s comments about the collective guilt of German Catholics and the equation of the Nazis and the allied occupation authorities began to circulate in Germany in early 1947, and spread rapidly due to grassroots distribution (authorized or unauthorized) and quotation in German newspapers.

&quot;One World&quot; appeared in both religious and secular publications alongside statements denying Germans&#x27; complicity in the Holocaust, especially the concept of collective guilt. Muench received several letters from German Catholics commenting on &quot;One World&quot;; they regarded him as one who understood German &quot;suffering&quot; and believed him to be of German descent.&quot;One World&quot; referred to the Allied authorities as &quot;other Hitlers in disguise, who would make of [the German] nation a crawling [Bergen-]Belsen. &quot;One World&quot; argued that responsibility for the Holocaust lay only with a very few war criminals who had &quot;revived the Mosaic idea of an eye for an eye&quot;.

According to Brown-Fleming, Muench&#x27;s sympathies in his writing matched his actions as one of the most active participants in the Vatican&#x27;s &quot;postwar clemency campaign on behalf of convicted war criminals&quot;. In particular, he spoke against what he perceived to be the mistreatment of high-ranking prisoners such as Konstantin von Neurath, Erich Raeder, Karl Dönitz, Walther Funk, Baldur von Schirach, Albert Speer, and Rudolf Hess. He wrote that their treatment was &quot;another terrible blotch on our record for decent, humane treatment of war criminals&quot;. &quot;One World&quot; was cited by Josef Hering and other war criminals in their own writings.

===Relationship with Jews===
In at least four instances, Muench became involved in restitution disputes between Catholic Germans and Jews regarding property seized during the war; in each instance, Muench sided with the German Catholics, contacting highly placed German and American officials on their behalf. Muench wrote in a September 1946 letter that &quot;some of these gents exploit the fact that they were in concentration camps for their own benefit, although some were there because of an unsavory past&quot;. In one restitution case, where a distant relative of Muench had been sentenced by a military court to a fine of 2,000 marks and the return of his business to a Warsaw Jew, Muench wrote &quot;a lot of hardship and injustice comes about because of [restitution resulting from] denazification&quot;.

Muench was also an opponent of interreligious dialogue efforts that included Jews, opposing the organization of chapters of the National Conference of Christians and Jews (NCCJ) and the International Conference of Christians and Jews (ICCJ), among others, in occupied Germany. In a 1948 letter to Carl Zietlow, a Minnesotan Protestant pastor of the NCCJ, Muench described the organization as unneeded because: &quot;regarding anti-Semitism&quot; he had &quot;found very little of it&quot;. Historian Paul Weindling has described Muench as having &quot;made efforts to downplay war crimes by distrusting Holocaust survivors as exaggerating Nazi crimes&quot;, part of a broader worldview that stated that &quot;Germans were victims: Jews, Slavs and communists were exaggerating crimes against them to extricate resources&quot;.

According to Phayer, for Muench as well as Pius XII, the &quot;priority was not the survivors of the Holocaust, but the situation of the German Catholic refugees in Eastern Europe who had been driven from their homes at the end of the war. Bishop Muench felt that their lot was comparable to that of the Jews during the Holocaust&quot;.

===Clemency for war crimes===
Along with other German and American clerics, such as Johann Neuhausler, auxiliary bishop of Munich, Cardinal Josef Frings of Cologne, Muench was &quot;in close contact with occupation authorities, other religious leaders, and the convicted war criminals themselves&quot; regarding the campaign for clemency for Nazi war criminals.

In February 1950, Pius XII instructed Muench to write a letter in support of clemency for some convicted German war criminals to General Thomas Hardy, the head of the U.S. Army European Command, who had the final word on all clemency decisions; with his new appointment as papal regent, Muench was to speak as a direct representative of the pope. In his diary, Muench made it clear that he viewed as &quot;questionable&quot; the sentences of war criminals who had not been directly involved in medical experimentation or other extreme acts at concentration camps or the deportation of people for slave labor. Prior to this, Muench had frequently become involved in individual clemency cases, but took care not to attract undue attention or publicity to the Vatican. As the Vatican urged Muench to press harder against the U.S. authorities, Muench wrote to Undersecretary Montini (future Pope Paul VI) warning him that Rome was on &quot;dangerously thin ice&quot;. According to Phayer, it was Muench&#x27;s discretion that &quot;saved the Vatican from becoming publicly associated with former Nazis&quot;. Muench wrote: &quot;I have not dared to advise the Holy See to intervene, especially if such intervention would eventually become public&quot;.

Muench often preferred to work behind the scenes; for example, a letter from one of Muench&#x27;s secretaries provided Father Franz Lovenstein the contact information he had requested &quot;with the understanding, of course, that you are not to use his name in connection with any letters or briefs that will be sent to those gentlemen&quot;. For example, in the case of Hans Eisele, former SS doctor convicted of experimentation on prisoners, there is some evidence that Muench&#x27;s intervention with General Clay in the summer of 1948 resulted in the commutation of Eisele&#x27;s execution (scheduled for June 1948) and Eisele&#x27;s eventual release in 1952.

==Nunciature (1951–1959)==
Muench&#x27;s role as apostolic visitor was upgraded to nuncio when the Allied High Commission permitted the Federal Republic to form an independent foreign affairs ministry in March 1951. On March 9, 1951, Pope Pius XII appointed Bishop Muench papal nuncio to Germany with the title of archbishop. 1886 Muench viewed it as no small honor to hold the nunciature formerly occupied by Pius XII himself. On March 12, Pius XII moved the nunciature from Eichstätt to Bad Godesberg, outside of Bonn. By April 4, 1951, Muench was named dean of the German diplomatic corps, the first diplomat accredited by the Federal Republic.

==Relationship with Pius XII==

There is much evidence of genuine camaraderie between Pius XII and Muench. He met Eugenio Pacelli (the future pope) for the first time while Pacelli was nuncio to Bavaria, when Muench visited Munich as a student representative of the Catholic Central Verein of America (CCVA).

As pope, Pius XII received Muench in several audiences, and after their second audience on July 12, 1946, the two always conversed in German. Muench also wrote many reports on the events in Germany directly to Pius XII between 1946 and 1958, and there is some evidence that Pius XII read many of them personally, even in 1953 when his health began to deteriorate. The reports spoke not only of the immediate, material needs of German Catholics, but also of the spread of communism, a fear shared by Muench and Pius XII, and the subject of another 1954 audience between the two.

Muench and Pius XII met in February 1947 and in the fall of 1948 and 1949; although initially Muench (in his letters to others) expressed satisfaction with Pius XII&#x27;s grasp of the situation in Germany, he later stated that the pope was too reliant on his own, earlier experiences in Germany and did not &quot;fully grasp&quot; the implications of the occupation and increasing secularization. Muench wrote that Pius XII was continuing to interpret the events unfolding in Germany &quot;according to this or that phrase of the Concordat&quot;.

In the 1953 dedication of the North American College in Rome, Pius XII stopped as he passed by Muench, expressed his gratitude that Muench could join him in Rome, and added &quot;don&#x27;t forget to see me before you leave&quot;. Muench was, according to Father Gerald Weber (in attendance), the only one of the many assembled bishops and cardinals whom Pius XII stopped and talked to.

Muench mourned the death of Pius XII in October 1958, telling friends that the pope &quot;treated him with the affection and love of a father to his son&quot;.

The correspondence between Muench and Pius XII focused almost exclusively on the various opinions shared by the two men, often with great levity, but rarely touched on the issues of anti-Semitism, the Holocaust, the wartime relationship between the church and Nazi Germany, and the situation of the postwar Jewry. According to Brown-Fleming, in one private audience between the two in May 1957 Pius XII told Muench a joke about Hitler dying, going to Heaven, and meeting the Old Testament Prophet Moses, who forgives Hitler; Hitler then asks Moses if he set fire to the burning bush himself, a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Reichstag fire, which apparently elicited a &quot;big laugh&quot; from Pius XII.

==Cardinalate and death==
He was elevated to cardinal on December 14, 1959, by Pope John XXIII. Muench resigned as Bishop of Fargo on December 9, 1959, just before he became Cardinal. He died in Rome on February 15, 1962, and was buried in Fargo.

==Papers==

===Origins===
Muench&#x27;s papers from course of his work in Germany are well preserved. This makes them one of a very few collections of papers from German, American, or Vatican Catholic dignitaries of that time period that are &quot;fully accessible to historians&quot;. According to Muench&#x27;s biographer, Father Colman Barry, Muench took his papers with him to Rome when he retired as nuncio in December 1959 and the papers were returned to the diocesan archives in 1962 after his death. Altogether, the papers weigh over 2,500 pounds, including those Muench transferred directly from Bad Godesberg to Fargo prior to moving to Rome.

As early as June 1956, Muench tasked his secretary, Father Gerard Weber, with the talk of sending his files, mostly composed of his personal correspondences, back to Fargo; Muench further directed four German nuns of the Saint Lioba convent in Freiburg/Breisgau to organize his German language correspondence. He continued sending records to Fargo until December 1959; in December 1960 he wrote a letter thanking an American friend bringing his personal diplomatic archives to the United States &quot;without custom difficulties&quot;. After Muench died on February 15, 1962, the papers were found by Sister Ilga Braun, secretary to the Bonn nunciature since 1951, who was invited by his successor as Bishop of Fargo, Leo Dworschak to organize the papers, which she did until 1963.
The papers were presented to The Catholic University of America in September 1972 by Bishop Justin Albert Driscoll, and indexed by 1976.

===Contents===
Among the papers are tens of thousands of letters (and Muench&#x27;s replies) from German Catholics dated from 1946 to 1959, many from convicted Catholic war criminals seeking Muench&#x27;s assistance in revising their denazification sentence, having their imprisonment commuted, or seeking emigration to the United States. Muench&#x27;s correspondence was vast, numbering approximately 15,000 letters in 1956 alone; but of those, only 300 addressed the Holocaust explicitly.

In addition, Muench received approximately 100 letters from U.S. Catholics and military government officials speaking frankly on taboo topics, such as anti-Semitism, the Holocaust, and its survivors. For example, a 1947 letter from a German Catholic alleged that U.S. generals such as Lucius D. Clay and Walter Muller were Jews, that Roosevelt had been assassinated by Jews, and other Jewish conspiracy theories. Another letter from a Catholic Army major wrote that enlisted Jews sought promotions into positions where they could &quot;control thought&quot;.

===Diary===
Muench kept a diary, which often recorded his recollections of conversations with important post-war leaders. For example, Muench wrote in his diary that former President Herbert Hoover had confided in Muench his belief that &quot;no emigrés who were not citizens for at least twenty years should be permitted to shape and execute policies in Germany&quot;.

He also reserved for his diary his description of Jewish Germans who had survived the war and resettled in the United States as &quot;alien&quot; and &quot;recent&quot; Americans, disloyal citizens, &quot;in control&quot; of American post-war policy in Germany, and harsh &quot;avengers&quot; against the Germans. For example, when Muench encountered difficulty in 1946 in easing travel restrictions on members of the clergy, he wrote in his diary that the problem was due to &quot;Jews in control [of the] Public Safety [division]&quot;. Similarly, Muench referred to Franz Cueppers, a Frankfurt banker convicted of conducting illegal foreign exchange as a &quot;victim of Jewish lawyers&quot;.

A recurring point of interest for Muench were what he referred to as &quot;Thirty-Niners&quot;: Jews who had fled Germany in 1933 or 1934, received United States citizenship in 1939, and then enlisted in the U.S. Armed Forces—Muench believed—&quot;to wreak their vengeance in every way possible on the defeated foe&quot;. Muench&#x27;s writings often characterized Jews generally, and Jewish displaced persons specifically, to be &quot;greedy, wilfully destructive, sexual predators, thieves, and anarchists involved in leftist activities&quot;.

==Secondary sources==

===Barry&#x27;s biography===
Muench commissioned Father Coleman Barry—whom he had met in Munich in 1953—to write his biography in 1961. Muench was a long-time benefactor of Barry, ever since he had reviewed Barry&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Catholic Church and the German Americans&quot; for the &quot;Catholic Historical Review&quot;.

Barry interviewed Muench extensively in Fargo in the summer of 1961 and thereafter interviewed his family, friends, colleagues, and acquaintances in Milwaukee, Fargo, Germany, and Rome. Barry published &quot;American Nuncio; Cardinal Aloisius Muensch&quot; in 1969 and it remains the only biography of Muench.

Barry&#x27;s biography does not cover the letters between Muench, American Catholics, occupation authorities, and Vatican officials; nor does it address Muench&#x27;s views of German guilt and collective responsibility for the Holocaust in much depth.

Barry&#x27;s biography was reviewed by the &quot;Journal of Ecumenical Studies&quot; and &quot;Church History&quot; as well as several Catholic journals and papers, which leveled very little criticism of the work, with the exception of the &quot;Journal of Ecumenical Studies&quot;. The reviewer, Prof. Franklin Littell of Temple University, argued that the work lacked objectivity.

===Brown-Fleming&#x27;s monograph===
Suzanne Brown-Fleming, a fellow at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum&#x27;s Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies, published her monograph of the Muench papers in 2006: &quot;The Holocaust and Catholic Conscience: Cardinal Aloisius Muench and the Guilt Question in Germany&quot;. Dr. Brown-Fleming holds a Ph.D. in Modern German History form the University of Maryland, College Park.

The monograph has received positive reviews. Prof. Mark Edward Ruff of Saint Louis University calls the work &quot;concise and clearly written&quot;, her use of primary sources &quot;often convincing and damning&quot;, states Brown-Fleming &quot;deserves kudos for bringing the work and values of Muench, a hitherto neglected figure, to the public eye&quot;. Prof. Michael Ott of Grand Valley State University calls the work a &quot;critical contribution to the growing research on the question of the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s policies and actions with regard to the Holocaust during World War II&quot;. Prof. Kevin Spicer of Stonehill College calls the work an &quot;insightful and well-researched examination&quot;.

Although Prof. John Conway of the University of British Columbia praises her use of the Muench papers, he notes that &quot;her book suffers from the inaccessibility of the Vatican&#x27;s records, since the papers for the reign of Pius XII are still-regrettably-closed&quot;.

<text>(born March 11, 1972), simply known by the stage name Ua (), is a Japanese singer. She made her debut under Speedstar Records in 1995 with the single &quot;Horizon&quot;.

== Biography ==
Ua was born Kaori Shima and grew up in Suita, Osaka. After graduating from Saga University of Arts in Kyoto, she worked as a lounge singer in her hometown. There in 1994, she was scouted by producer Hiroshi Fujiwara. She took on the unusual stage name of &quot;Ua&quot; (a Swahili word that means both &quot;flower&quot; and &quot;kill&quot;) and made her debut with the Fujiwara-produced &quot;Horizon&quot;. Her fourth single &quot;Jōnetsu&quot; became a smash hit and Ua was recognized all over Japan.

After releasing her first album, &quot;11&quot;, Ua married actor Jun Murakami and gave birth to a son, Nijirō, in 1997, who is also an actor. The couple divorced in 2006. In 2000, after two more albums, &quot;Ametora&quot; and &quot;Turbo&quot;, Ua took a hiatus from her solo work and formed the band Ajico with Kenichi Asai. She resumed her solo activities in 2002 and released her fourth album, &quot;Dorobō&quot;. The same year she made her acting debut as the leading role in the film &quot;Mizu no Onna&quot;, as well as contributing to the soundtrack. The film went on to win the Golden Alexander prize for Best Feature-Length Film at the International Thessaloniki Film Festival and was screened at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival.

In 2003, Ua released &quot;Illuminate: The Very Best Songs&quot;, her first compilation album. In April that year, she expanded her activities by becoming the hostess named ううあ (the pronunciation remains the same since it is meant to be a phonetic representation of her usual stagename) of an educational TV program on NHK called &quot;Do Re Mi no TV&quot;, designed to pass along Japanese traditional songs to children. &quot;Utauua&quot;, a compilation of the songs performed, was released in 2004. The same year she released her fifth album, &quot;Sun&quot;, which was mastered by Ted Jensen. In 2005, she released her sixth album, &quot;Breathe&quot;, and a compilation album of collaborations titled &quot;Nephews&quot; to mark her 10th anniversary. In 2006, Ua collaborated with renowned jazz musician Naruyoshi Kikuchi on the album &quot;Cure Jazz&quot;. In 2007, in addition to releasing her seventh album &quot;Golden Green&quot;, Ua made a second foray into acting by appearing in Hitoshi Matsumoto&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Dai Nipponjin&quot;.

In 2008, Ua revealed that she married again and gave birth to a daughter, in August. In December, she released the single &quot;2008&quot;, followed by her eighth album, &quot;Atta&quot;, in July 2009. In April 2010, Ua released her fourth live album, entitled &quot;Haluto Live&quot;.

<text>The soft sign (Ь ь; italics: &quot;Ь ь&quot;) is a letter in the Cyrillic script that is used in various Slavic languages. In Old Church Slavonic, it represented a short or reduced front vowel. However, over time, the specific vowel sound it denoted was largely eliminated and merged with other vowel sounds.

In most contemporary Slavic Cyrillic writing systems, such as those used in East Slavic languages (Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian) and Church Slavic, the soft sign does not represent a distinct sound on its own. Instead, it serves as an indicator of palatalization of the preceding consonant. In the Bulgarian language, it is only used to mark the palatalization of the preceding consonant when in front of the letter o, causing the combination ьо (/ʲo/). An example of this is the word (/gʲol/).

Palatalization is a linguistic process in which the middle of the tongue moves closer to the hard palate while pronouncing a consonant. It affects the pronunciation of the preceding consonant by giving it a palatal quality or causing it to become a palatal consonant. The soft sign acts as a visual marker to show that the consonant before it is palatalized.

For example, in Russian, the soft sign is often used after consonants to indicate palatalization. It affects the pronunciation of the preceding consonant and can change the sound of words. The specific effect varies depending on the consonant it follows. In other Slavic languages where the soft sign is used, a similar palatalization function is observed.

It may also be used as a superscript. (ь)

== Uses and meanings ==
=== Palatalization sign ===

The soft sign is normally written after a consonant and indicates its &quot;softening&quot; (palatalization) (for example Ukrainian батько &#x27;father&#x27;). Less commonly, the soft sign just has a grammatically determined usage with no phonetic meaning (like &#x27;fanfare&#x27; and тушь &#x27;India ink&#x27;, both pronounced but different in grammatical gender and declension). In East Slavic languages and some other Slavic languages (such as Bulgarian), there are some consonants that do not have phonetically different palatalized forms but corresponding letters still admit the affixing soft sign.

The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet has had no soft sign as a distinct letter since the mid-19th century: palatalization is represented by special consonant letters instead of the sign (some of these letters, such as or , were designed as ligatures with the grapheme of the soft sign). The modern Macedonian alphabet, based on the Serbian Cyrillic variant, has had no soft sign since its creation, in 1944.

=== Before a vowel in East Slavic languages ===
Between a consonant and a vowel, the soft sign bears also a function of &quot;iotation sign&quot;: in Russian, vowels after the soft sign are iotated (compare Russian льют &#x27;(they) pour/cast&#x27; and лют &#x27;(he is) fierce&#x27;). The feature, quite consistent with Russian orthography, promulgated a confusion between palatalization and iotation, especially because usually precedes so-called &quot;soft vowels&quot;. Combinations (ya), (ye), (yo) and (yu) give iotated vowels, like corresponding vowel letters in isolation (and word-initially), and unlike its use immediately after a consonant letter in which palatalization can occur but not iotation. In those cases, may be considered as a sign indicating that a vowel after it is pronounced separately from the previous consonant, but that is the case neither for (yi) nor for (yo), because these vowels are not iotated in isolation. The latter case, though, is rarely used in Russian (only in loanwords such as ) and can be seen as a replacement of phonetically identical , which gets rid of an &quot;inconvenient&quot; letter . In Ukrainian and Bulgarian, the spelling indicates palatalization, not iotation.

Known as the &quot;hard sign&quot; (, ), , an &quot;unpalatalization sign&quot;, also denotes iotation, as in the case of , , and in Russian. It differs from the soft sign in that it doesn&#x27;t necessarily soften the preceding consonant like the soft sign does (although consonants preceding the hard sign are still sometimes softened).

Similarly, the soft sign may denote iotation in Belarusian and Ukrainian, but it is not used so extensively as in Russian. Ukrainian uses a quite different repertoire of vowel letters from those of Russian and Belarusian, and iotation is usually expressed by an apostrophe in Ukrainian. Still the soft sign is used in Ukrainian if the sound preceded by an iotated vowel is palatalized.

=== In Bulgarian ===
Among Slavic languages using the Cyrillic script, the soft sign has the most limited use in Bulgarian: while phonemic palatalization does occur, it is very limited, even more than in other hard languages like Serbian (compare Bulgarian &quot;кон&quot; to Russian &quot;конь&quot; or Serbian &quot;коњ&quot;). The only possible position is one between consonants and (such as in names , and , or the word синьо). Rather, the letter is mostly used in foreign words of French or German origin, such as шофьор (driver, chauffeur). There are almost no native Bulgarian words with the soft sign.

=== As a vowel in Slavic studies ===

In Slavistic transcription, which is a system used to represent Proto-Slavic language, the Cyrillic letters Ь and Ъ are employed to denote extra-short vowel sounds. Ь represents the extra-short /ĭ/ sound, while Ъ represents the extra-short /ŭ/ sound.

Proto-Slavic refers to the common ancestor of the Slavic languages, which was spoken around the 5th to 9th centuries AD. During this period, the Slavic languages were still in the process of diverging from a shared linguistic ancestor. Slavistic transcription aims to reconstruct the phonological features of Proto-Slavic based on historical and comparative linguistics.

In Old Slavonic orthography, which is closely related to Proto-Slavic, the soft sign (Ь) and the hard sign (Ъ) were originally used to represent the extra-short vowel sounds. These extra-short vowels were distinct from regular short vowels in terms of their duration or length.

The extra-short /ĭ/ sound represented by Ь was a front vowel, similar to the sound of &quot;i&quot; in the English word &quot;bit.&quot; On the other hand, the extra-short /ŭ/ sound represented by Ъ was a back vowel, similar to the sound of &quot;u&quot; in the English word &quot;put.&quot;

By utilizing Ь and Ъ in Slavistic transcription, linguists and researchers can indicate the presence of these extra-short vowel sounds in reconstructed Proto-Slavic words. This transcription system allows for a more accurate representation of the phonetic and phonological characteristics of the ancestral Slavic language.

===Digraphs===

In certain non-Slavic Cyrillic-based alphabets, such as Chechen, Ingush, and various Dagestanian languages like Tabasaran, the digraph ⟨аь⟩ is introduced to represent the sounds /æ/ or /a/. This combination of the letter &quot;а&quot; and the soft sign &quot;ь&quot; denotes a specific vowel sound. Similarly, the digraph ⟨оь⟩ is used for /œ/ or /ø/, and ⟨уь⟩ for /y/. Additional iotated forms like ⟨юь⟩ and ⟨яь⟩ are used as needed. This usage of the soft sign is similar to the trailing &quot;e&quot; in German when umlauts are unavailable.

This approach allows for the representation of specific vowel sounds in these non-Slavic languages using the available Cyrillic characters. The soft sign ⟨ь⟩, combined with other letters, creates digraphs to represent distinct phonemes that cannot be expressed by the bare letters alone.

There have also been proposals to use the ⟨аь⟩ digraph in Turkic languages as a replacement for Cyrillic Schwa (Ә), which represents the sound /ə/ or /æ/. Unlike Schwa, which may not be present in all Cyrillic character repertoires, both ⟨а⟩ and ⟨ь⟩ are commonly available letters in the basic modern Russian alphabet.

In addition to its use with vowels, the soft sign, like the hard sign and the palochka, is employed in many languages as digraphs to represent consonant sounds that are phonetically similar but distinct from the bare letter. For example, while the letter &quot;г&quot; represents the sound /g/, the combination &quot;гь&quot; represents /ɣ/ in Crimean Tatar, /ɦ/ in Archi, and /h/ in Avar and Tabasaran.

== Representations ==
Under normal orthographic rules, it has no uppercase form, as no word begins with the letter. However, Cyrillic type fonts normally provide an uppercase form for setting type in all caps or for using it as an element of various serial numbers (like series of Soviet banknotes) and indices (for example, there was once a model of old Russian steam locomotives marked &quot;Ь&quot; – :ru:Паровоз Ь).

In the romanization of Cyrillic, the soft sign is typically transliterated with . Sometimes is used, or the soft sign may be ignored if it is in a position that it does not denote iotation, for example: Тверь=Tver, Обь=Ob. It can also be transcribed &quot;y&quot; or &quot;i&quot; if preceding a vowel.

In Belarusian it is romanized as a combining acute, e.g., зь , ць , нь , ль .
