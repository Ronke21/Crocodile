<text>The Villa Farnese, also known as Villa Caprarola, is a pentagonal mansion in the town of Caprarola in the province of Viterbo, Northern Lazio, Italy, approximately north-west of Rome, originally commissioned and owned by the House of Farnese. A property of the Republic of Italy, Villa Farnese is run by the Polo Museale del Lazio. This villa is not to be confused with two similarly-named properties of the family, the Palazzo Farnese and the Villa Farnesina, both in Rome.

The Villa Farnese is situated directly above the town of Caprarola and dominates its surroundings. It is a massive Renaissance and Mannerist construction, opening to the Monte Cimini, a range of densely wooded volcanic hills. It is built on a five-sided plan in reddish gold stone; buttresses support the upper floors. As a centerpiece of the vast Farnese holdings, Caprarola was always an expression of Farnese power, rather than a villa in the more usual agricultural or pleasure senses.

==History==
In 1504, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, the future Pope Paul III, acquired the estate at Caprarola. He had designs made for a fortified castle or &quot;rocca&quot; by the architects Antonio da Sangallo the Younger and Baldassare Peruzzi. Surviving plan drawings by Peruzzi show a pentagonal arrangement with each face of the pentagon canted inwards towards its center, to permit raking fire upon a would-be scaling force, both from the center and from the projecting bastions that advance from each corner angle of the fortress. Peruzzi&#x27;s plan also shows a central pentagonal courtyard and it is likely that the later development of the circular central court was also determined by the necessities of the pentagonal plan. The pentagonal fortress foundations, constructed probably between 1515 and 1530, became the base upon which the present villa sits; so the overall form of the villa was predetermined by the &quot;rocca&quot; foundations.

Subsequently, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, a grandson of Pope Paul III, and a man who was known for promoting his family&#x27;s interests, planned to turn this partly constructed fortified edifice into a villa or country house. In 1556, he commissioned Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola as his architect, building work commenced in 1559 and Vignola continued to work on the villa at Caprarola until his death in 1573. Farnese was a courteous man of letters; however, the Farnese family as a whole became unpopular with the following pope, Julius III, and, accordingly, Alessandro Farnese decided it would be politic to retire from the Vatican for a period. He therefore selected Caprarola on the family holding of Ronciglione, being both near and yet far enough from Rome as the ideal place to build a country house.

==Design==
The villa is one of the finest examples of Renaissance architecture. Ornament is used sparingly to achieve proportion and harmony. Thus while the villa dominates the surroundings, its severe design also complements the site. This particular style, known today as Mannerism, was a reaction to the earlier High Renaissance designs of twenty years earlier.

Vignola, the architect chosen for this difficult and inhospitable site, had recently proved his mettle in designing Villa Giulia on the outskirts of Rome for the preceding pope, Julius III. Vignola in his youth had been heavily influenced by Michelangelo. For the villa at Caprarola, his plans as built were for a pentagon constructed around a circular colonnaded courtyard. In the galleried court, paired Ionic columns flank niches containing busts of the Roman Emperors, above a rusticated arcade, a reworking of Bramante&#x27;s scheme for the &quot;House of Raphael&quot;, in the Borgo rione, Rome. A further Bramantesque detail is the entablature that breaks forward over the columns, linking them above, while they stand on separate bases. The interior loggia formed by the arcade is frescoed with Raphaelesque grotesques, in the manner of the Vatican &quot;Logge&quot;. The gallery and upper floors were reached by five spiral staircases around the courtyard: the most important of these is the &quot;Scala Regia&quot; (&quot;Royal Stairs&quot;) rising through the principal floors.

===Approach and entrance===
The approach to the Villa Farnese is from the town&#x27;s main street, which is centred on the villa, to a piazza from which stairs ascend to a series of terraces beginning with the subterranean basement excavated from the tuff, surrounded by steep curving steps leading to the terrace above. This basement floor in the foundations, which functioned as a carriage entrance in inclement weather, features a massive central column with a series of buttresses and retaining walls; on the exterior, large heavily grilled doors in the rusticated walls appear to lead into the guardrooms of a fortress, while above them a curved balustraded external double stairway leads to the terrace above. This in turn has a formal double staircase to the principal entrance on the &quot;Piano dei Prelati&quot; floor which is accessed from the broad terrace. This bastion-like floor, which appears in the elevation as a second ground floor, is rusticated, the main door a severe arch flanked by three windows on each side. The facade at this level is terminated by massive solid corner projections.

Above this is the double-height &quot;piano nobile&quot;, where five huge arched windows incongruously dominate the facade over the front door; above this sit a further two floors for housing gentlefolk with servants above them, the numerous windows divided on the exterior by rusticated pilasters in dressed stone.
===Interiors===
The villa&#x27;s interiors are arranged over five floors, each floor designed for a different function. The main rooms are located on the first floor or &quot;piano nobile&quot;, where a large central loggia (now glazed in) looks down over the town, its main street and the surrounding countryside. This hall is known as the Room of Hercules on account of its fresco decorations, and was used as a summer dining hall. It has a grotto-like fountain with sculpture at one end. To either side of the loggia are two circular rooms: one is the chapel, the other accommodates the principal staircase or &quot;Scala Regia&quot;, a graceful spiral of steps supported by pairs of Ionic columns rising up through three floors and frescoed by Antonio Tempesta.

The two grand apartments at first floor level are symmetrically-matched in plan and complete the remaining enclosure of the courtyard. Each has a series of five rooms with state rooms, which begin with the largest reception hall nearest the entrance and proceed, with increasing intimacy and decreased size, to a bedroom, wardrobe and &quot;studiolo&quot; at the northern end; an ordered suite that would become standardized in the 17th century as the Baroque state apartment. The different orientations of these two apartments allows for a seasonal differentiation; the east, or summer apartment is associated with the active life, the west, or winter range with the contemplative life. The scrupulous symmetrical balance of the two apartments is carried through by their matching parterre gardens, each reached by a bridge across the moat and cut into the hillslope.

The suites are famous for their Mannerist frescoes. The iconographic program of frescoes expressing the glory of the Farnese was worked out by the humanists in Farnese&#x27;s court, notably his secretary, Annibale Caro; The fresco cycles portray the exploits of Alexander the Great, and of course of the Farnese themselves: in the &quot;Sala dei Fasti Farnesiani&quot; (the Room of Farnese Deeds), decorated by the brothers Taddeo and Federico Zuccari, the Farnese are depicted at all their most glorious moments, from floor to coffered ceiling. Other artists employed in fresco decoration include Giacomo Zanguidi (il Bertoia), Raffaellino da Reggio, Antonio Tempesta, Giacomo del Duca, and Giovanni De Vecchi. The Flemish painters Joos van Winghe and Bartholomaeus Spranger assisted il Bertoia with the decorations in the rooms he had been commissioned to finish.

Among the frescoed subjects of the contemplative winter suite is the famous &quot;Room of the World Map&quot; or &quot;Sala del Mappamondo&quot;, displaying the whole known world as it was in 1574 when the frescoes were completed. Above, the frescoed vault depicts the celestial spheres and the constellations of the zodiac.

===Gardens===

The gardens of the villa are as impressive as the building itself, a significant example of the Italian Renaissance garden period. The villa&#x27;s fortress theme is carried through by a surrounding moat and three drawbridges. Two facades of the pentagonal arrangement face the two gardens cut into the hill; each garden is accessed across the moat by a drawbridge from the apartments on the &quot;piano nobile&quot; and each is a parterre garden of box topiary with fountains. A grotto-like theatre was once here. A walk through the chestnut woods beyond, leads to the &quot;giardino segreto&quot;, or secret garden, with its well-known casino.

====The Casino====
The Casino, a small habitable summerhouse with two loggie for &quot;al fresco&quot; dining. It was built probably on designs by Giacomo del Duca, with later alterations were made to the area around the casino by the architect Girolamo Rainaldi. The casino is approached by stairs contained between heavily rusticated grotto walls, with a central &quot;catena d&#x27;acqua&quot;, a cascaded rill or &#x27;water-staircase&#x27;, which the water flows down to a stone basin. At the top of the steps and set in an oval space are large statues of two reclining river gods to either side of a large central vase fountain. Stairs built into the oval walls lead up to the parterred terrace in front of the south facade of the casino. This part of the terrace is lined by stone herms with cypress trees. To the north of the casino is a private garden which steps up slightly and accommodates roses.

==Today==
Alessandro Farnese died in 1589 bequeathing his estates to relations - the Farnese dukes of Parma. The Cardinal&#x27;s fabulous collection was transferred eventually to Charles III of Spain in Naples. In the 19th century the villa became for a while the residence of the heir to the throne of the newly united Italy.

Elements of the villa&#x27;s Renaissance gardens have influenced many estate gardens of the 19th and 20th century by landscape designers, such as Beatrix Farrand, A.E. Hanson, and Florence Yoch. 1920s gardens with a &quot;catena d&#x27;acqua&quot; include the Harold Lloyd Estate in Beverly Hills and &#x27;Las Tejas&#x27; in Montecito, California, with the latter also having a casino in direct homage to the original at Villa Farnese.

The villa Farnese in Caprarola provided the model for the Pentagon in Washington D.C.

Today the casino and its gardens are one of the homes of the President of the Italian Republic. The empty main villa, owned by the State, is open to the public. The numerous rooms, salons and halls with their marbles and frescoes, and the architecture of the great palazzo-like villa are still as impressive and daunting as they were first intended to be.

==Filmography==

* Several scenes from the TV series are set in Villa Farnese.
* Several scenes from 2003 movie &quot;Luther&quot; was filmed in Villa Farnese, featuring the central courtyard and Scala Regia.
* Scenes of the Vinceguerra Estate in the movie The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (film)  were filmed in the gardens of the Villa Farnese.

The Villa was depicted both as the interior of Papal Palace in Vatican and as Castel Gandolfo in the original Netflix movie The Two Popes.

Several major scenes were filmed at Villa Farnese’s Casino (that is “summerhouse” that is not a main villa but separate smaller building with gardens) in 2013 film Romeo and Juliet. Particularly, the loggia of casino served as Juliet’s balcony where Romeo and Juliet exchanged an oath of love; for the filming the empty loggia’s walls were decorated by artificial climbing roses on supports that Romeo used to climb up. The casino’s southern side garden staircase with water cascade (catena d&#x27;acqua) and fountain at the bottom were the ones in the scene of Romeo and Juliet separation at dawn after their first night together.

<text>Szabolcs Fazakas (26 October 1947 – 31 March 2020) was a Hungarian politician and diplomat.

==Profession==
Fazakas was born in Budapest, and earned a degree of external trade in 1971, graduating from Karl Marx University of Economic Sciences (present-day Corvinus University of Budapest). He taught as an assistant lecturer there from 1971 to 1973. Earning PhD, he was employed by the Ministry of External Trade (then Ministry of Trade) between 1973 and 1990, where he worked as a rapporteur for economic relations with West Germany and East Germany, then commercial counselor at Vienna, finally Head of Department responsible for OECD affairs and relations. He served as Deputy Minister of Trade, and was also Head of the Secretariat for International Economic Relations from 1989 to 1990.

Following the transition to democracy, Fazakas joined the private sector. He functioned as regional representative of the Österreichische Industrieholding (ÖIAG) in Budapest from 1990 to 1995. Beside that, he was also Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the European Commercial Bank Limited Liability Company from 1994 to 1995.

==Political career==
Fazakas entered government service in the cabinet of Prime Minister Gyula Horn, when he held the position of Secretary of State for Administrative Affairs in the Ministry of Industry and Trade between 25 September 1995 and 15 July 1996. After that, he briefly served as Hungarian Ambassador to Germany from 30 August to 29 October 1996. Returning to Hungary, he functioned as Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism from 29 October 1996 to 8 July 1998, until the 1998 parliamentary election. After the electoral defeat of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), Fazakas returned to the private sector. He was regional representative of the DaimlerChrysler automotive corporation between 1998 and 2002. He functioned as Chairman of the Board of GarAgent-Excel from 2000.

After the 2002 parliamentary election, when MSZP was able to form a government, Fazakas became a member of the National Assembly (MP) between 2002 and 2004, obtaining a mandate from the party&#x27;s national list. He was a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. He was also delegated into the Interparliamentary Union from 2002 to 2004. He was then Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Hungarian Socialist Party, part of the Party of European Socialists from 2004 to 2009. On 23 July 2004, he was elected Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control, holding the position until 30 January 2007, when he was elected one of the quaestors of the European Parliament for the second half of the term (2007–2009). His name appeared in the 6th place in the candidacy list of MSZP during the 2009 European Parliament election in Hungary, but the party gained only 4 seats, thus Fazakas lost his mandate.

Szabolcs Fazakas was elected to the European Court of Auditors on 7 May 2010, replacing Gejza Halász. During his nomination, Fidesz MEP Tamás Deutsch charged that he had voluntarily joined the Hungarian Secret Service during the communist dictatorship and worked there for more than 13 years as a secret agent, and was also involved in a suspicious arms procurement. Fazakas denied the charges and sued Deutsch. His mandate expired on 31 August 2017, he was replaced by Ildikó Pelczné Gáll.

==Personal life==
He was married to Judit Benkő. They had two sons, Gergely and Balázs.

<text>Ralph Thomas Hotchkin Griffith (1826–1906) was an English Indologist. He was a member of the Indian education service, and was among the first Europeans to translate the Vedas into English. He had lived in Oxford, Benares, and in Madras.

==Life==
Griffith was born at Corsley, Wiltshire, on 25 May 1826. The son of the Reverend R. C. Griffith (Chaplain to the Marquess of Bath 1830), he was a B.A. of Queen&#x27;s College and was elected Boden Professor of Sanskrit on Nov 24, 1849. The Boden Sanskrit professorship was established in 1832 with money bequeathed to the university by Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Boden to assist in the conversion of the people of India to Christianity. Griffith took up this objective and translated the Vedic scriptures into English. He also produced translations of other Sanskrit literature, including a verse version of the Ramayana and the Kumara Sambhava of Kalidasa. He held the position of principal at the Benares College in India and later lived in Kotagiri, Nilgiri. Griffith was more interested in translating Vedic books into English, and did most of his translations while living, teaching and researching in Kotagiri in the Nilgiris.

His translation of the Rigveda follows the text of Max Müller&#x27;s six-volume Sanskrit edition. His readings generally follow the work of the great scholar Sayana, who was Prime Minister at the court of the King of Vijaynagar in what is now the District of Bellary in the Indian state of Karnataka during the fourteenth century.

On his retirement he withdrew to Kotagiri, a hill station, some 7000 feet high, in the Nilgiris district, Madras, residing with his brother Frank, an engineer in the public works department of the Bombay presidency, who had settled there in 1879. At Kotagiri he tranquilly engaged in the study and translation of the Vedas. He died on 7 November 1906, and was buried there.

==Works==
Copies of his translation of the Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajur Veda, Atharvaveda and Ramayana are available on the internet.

<doc id="865167" wikidata="Q472691" url="?curid=865167" title="Cyril Radcliffe, 1st Viscount Radcliffe">
<text>Cyril John Radcliffe, 1st Viscount Radcliffe, (30 March 1899 – 1 April 1977) was a British lawyer and Law Lord best known for his role in the Partition of India. He served as the first chancellor of the University of Warwick from its foundation in 1965 to 1977.

==Background, education and early career==

Radcliffe was born in Llanychan, Denbighshire, Wales, third of the four children- all sons- of Captain Alfred Ernest Radcliffe, of the Royal Lancashire Regiment, and Sybil Harriet, daughter of solicitor Robert Cunliffe, President of the Law Society between 1890 and 1891.

Radcliffe was educated at Haileybury College. He was conscripted in World War I but his poor eyesight limited the options for service so he was allocated to the Labour Corps. After the War, he attended New College, Oxford as a scholar, and took a first in &quot;literae humaniores&quot; in 1921. In 1922 he was elected to a prize fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford. He won the Eldon Law Scholarship in 1923.

He was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1924, and joined the chambers of Wilfred Greene, later the Master of the Rolls. He practised at the Chancery bar, and was appointed a King&#x27;s Counsel in 1935.

During World War II, Radcliffe joined the Ministry of Information becoming its Director-General by 1941, where he worked closely with the Minister Brendan Bracken. In 1944 he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). He returned to the bar in 1945.

==Indian Boundary Committees==
Radcliffe, a man who had never been east of Paris, was given the chairmanship of the two boundary committees set up with the passing of the Indian Independence Act. Radcliffe was given the task of drawing the borders for the new nations of Pakistan and India in a way that would leave as many Sikhs and Hindus in India and Muslims in Pakistan as possible. He was given only 5 weeks to complete the job. Radcliffe submitted his partition map on 9 August 1947, which split apart Punjab and Bengal almost in half. The new boundaries were formally announced on 17 August 1947 – three days after Pakistan&#x27;s independence and two days after India became independent of the United Kingdom.

Radcliffe&#x27;s efforts saw some 14 million people – roughly seven million from each side – flee across the border when they discovered the new boundaries left them in the &quot;wrong&quot; country. In the violence that ensued after independence, estimates of loss of life accompanying or preceding the partition vary between several hundred thousand and two million, and millions more were injured. After seeing the mayhem occurring on both sides of the boundary, Radcliffe refused his salary of 40,000 rupees (then 3,000 pounds). He was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire in 1948. 

Speaking of his experience as the chairman of boundary committees, he later said-&quot;I had no alternative, the time at my disposal was so short that I could not do a better job. Given the same period I would do the same thing. However, if I had two to three years, I might have improved on what I did.&quot;The poet W. H. Auden referred to Radcliffe&#x27;s role in the partition of India and Pakistan in his 1966 poem &quot;Partition&quot;.

==Later career==
In 1949, Radcliffe was made a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, sworn of the Privy Council, and created a law lord as Baron Radcliffe, of Werneth in the County of Lancaster. Unusually, he had not previously been a judge. In the 1940s and 1950s he chaired a string of public enquiries in addition to his legal duties and continued to hold numerous trusteeships, governorships and chairmanships right up until his death. He chaired the Committee of Enquiry into the Future of the British Film Institute (1948), whose recommendations led to the modernisation of the BFI in the post-war period. 

While a Law Lord, he produced a report in 1956 making proposals for the constitution of Cyprus, then a British colony. 

From 1957 he was chairman of the Radcliffe Committee, called to enquire into the working of the monetary and credit system. The committee published a report known as the Radcliffe report which suggested reforms on how monetary policy is run. He was also a frequent public speaker and wrote numerous books: he gave the BBC Reith Lecture in 1951 – a series of seven broadcasts titled &quot;Power and the State&quot; which examined the features of democratic society, and considered the problematic notions of power and authority. He also presented the Oxford University Romanes Lecture in 1963 on Mountstuart Elphinstone. 

In 1962 he was made a hereditary peer as Viscount Radcliffe, of Hampton Lucy in the County of Warwick.

==Personal life==

Lord Radcliffe married Antonia Mary Roby, daughter of Godfrey Benson, 1st Baron Charnwood and former wife of John Tennant, in 1939. He died in April 1977, aged 78. He had no issue and the viscountcy of Radcliffe became extinct on his death.

In 2006, two sets of Chancery barristers&#x27; chambers in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn merged and adopted the name &quot;Radcliffe Chambers&quot;.

<text>The Edmund Burke Foundation () is a conservative organization based in The Hague, the Netherlands.

==History==
The Edmund Burke Foundation was founded in 2000 by a group of young conservatives, including professor Andreas Kinneging and journalist Bart Jan Spruyt, dissatisfied with the consensus of Dutch politics, the level of public debate and what they believe is the dangerous drift of philosophy and culture in the Netherlands. It is named after the 18th-century conservative philosopher Edmund Burke.

From 2000 to 2005, the Foundation was active as both a think tank and an educational group. In that time, the foundation took positions that are both fiscally and socially conservative. It organized an annual summer school for undergraduate students, conferences, seminars and lectures on topics such as the multicultural society, education, health care, foreign policy and defense. Conservatives associated with the Foundation were, for example, in favor of health care privatization and tax cuts. The Foundation has links with conservative think tanks in the U.S., including The Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute. Speakers at the foundation&#x27;s events included Roger Scruton, the Burke scholar Peter Stanlis, Dutch writer Leon de Winter, Islam-expert Reuel Marc Gerecht, Frits Bolkestein and Onno Ruding, former finance minister of The Netherlands.

In the summer of 2005, the Board of the Foundation decided to focus its activities more exclusively on its educational, cultural and philosophical programs, taking the Intercollegiate Studies Institute explicitly as a role model. Consequently, Bart Jan Spruyt stepped back as full-time managing director of the think tank to join the political party of Geert Wilders, but remained a member of the governing Board of the Foundation. Several former employees then spun off the think-tank activities into a new group called the European Independent Institute.

==Media activities==
In its think tank period, the Burke Foundation regularly published reports and studies on a variety of topics, including the Dutch health care sector, privatization, wasteful government spending and conservative philosophy and thought. Members of the Burke Foundation published articles and op-eds in numerous newspapers, and many newspapers devoted substantial attention to the activities of the Foundation. Those newspapers include De Telegraaf, de Volkskrant, NRC Handelsblad, Het Parool, Trouw, Nederlands Dagblad, and weekly magazines such as HP/De Tijd, Elsevier, and De Groene Amsterdammer. Members of the Burke Foundation also appeared regularly on TV and Radio programs, including NOVA, Den Haag Vandaag, TweeVandaag, and the Radio 1 News program.

==Funding==
The Foundation received substantial support during its think-tank period from a variety of sources, including small private donors, Dutch entrepreneurs, and various multinational corporations, such as Pfizer and Microsoft.

<text>In cooking, reduction is the process of thickening and intensifying the flavor of a liquid mixture, such as a soup, sauce, wine or juice, by simmering or boiling.

Reduction is performed by simmering or boiling a liquid, such as a stock, fruit or vegetable juice, wine, vinegar or sauce, until the desired concentration is reached by evaporation. This is done without a lid, enabling the vapor to escape from the mixture. Different components of the liquid will evaporate at slightly different temperatures, and the goal of reduction is to drive away those with lowest points of evaporation.

While reduction does concentrate the flavors left in the pan, reducing too much will decrease the amount of all liquid in the sauce, leaving a sticky, burnt coating on the pan.

Sauces, ranging from basic brown sauce to béchamel sauce and even tomato sauce, are simmered for long periods (from 1 to 10 hours) but not boiled. Simmering not only develops the maximum possible flavor, but also allows impurities to collect at the top and be skimmed off periodically as the sauce cooks. Boiling would diffuse the impurities into the liquid and result in a bitter taste and unclear stock. Broths are also simmered rather than boiled, and for the same reasons.

== Examples ==

1. Evaporation of juice

When the pot is continuously heated on the stove, the moisture in the sauce will naturally evaporate into gas due to the high temperature, allowing the soup at the bottom of the pot to dry. This is the most basic way of harvesting juice, and all kinds of dishes are common. This requires that the ingredients have been cooked, the pot is opened and turned on high heat, as far as possible to boil the water, let the sauce concentrate, before the ingredients must turn off the fire.

2. Harvesting juice with starch syrup

The starch is dissolved in water, and when it is pasteurized, it can increase the consistency of the soup, and it is also the most commonly used way in Chinese cuisine. The general form of starching is to use too white powder or corn flour, starch and cold water in a bowl, then pour the starch juice into the pot, and mix well with the water in the pot.

3. Sugar harvesting juice

Sugar harvest juice is to increase the sugar to increase the concentration of soup, so that the more it is boiled, the thicker it can be completed. Suitable for sweet dishes such as sweet and sour ribs and braised meat. The best time to harvest is before the dishes are cooked and ready to cook. When harvesting the juice, turn the heat and add more sugar than when seasoning, but the dosage should be controlled to prevent the taste from being too sweet; and always pay attention to the conditions in the pot. Starching for juice

4. Natural juice harvest

Natural juices are only available for collagen-rich ingredients such as pork skin, beef tendons, or pork feet. The connective tissue is mainly composed of collagen, in the process of heating, will gradually release sticky protein, fully dissolved into the soup, can form starch. It is similar to evaporating and harvesting juice, but instead of adding starchy water to the pot, it is heated and braised directly, allowing the gelatin to dissolve into the sauce and become sticky enough to wrap the ingredients.

<doc id="865176" wikidata="Q3393334" url="?curid=865176" title="Signoria of Florence">
<text>The Signoria of Florence (Italian: &quot;lordship&quot;) was the government of the medieval and Renaissance Republic of Florence, between 1250 and 1532. Its nine members, the &quot;Priori&quot;, were chosen from the ranks of the guilds of the city: six of them from the major guilds, and two from the minor guilds. The ninth became the Gonfaloniere of Justice.

==Selection of members==
The names of all guild members over thirty years old were put in eight leather bags called &quot;borse&quot;. Every two months, these bags were taken from the church of Santa Croce, where they were ordinarily kept, and in a short ceremony drawn out at random. Only men who were not in debt, had not served a recent term, and had no relation to the names of men already drawn, would be considered eligible for office.

==Service in the Signoria==
Immediately after they were elected, the nine were expected to move into the Palazzo della Signoria, where they would remain for the two months of their office. There they were paid a modest sum to cover their expenses and were provided with green-liveried servants. The &quot;Priori&quot; had a uniform of crimson coats, lined with ermine and with ermine collars and cuffs.

In undertaking their governmental duties, the Signoria was required to consult two other elected councils collectively known as &quot;Collegi&quot;. The first was the &quot;Dodici Buonomini&quot;, with twelve members, while the second, the &quot;Sedici Gonfalonieri&quot;, consisted of sixteen people. Other councils, such as the Ten of War, the Eight of Security and the Six of Commerce, were elected as the need arose.

<doc id="865181" wikidata="Q711098" url="?curid=865181" title="Jean-Louis Bourlanges">
<text>Jean-Louis Bourlanges (; born 13 July 1946) is a French politician who represented the 12th constituency of the Hauts-de-Seine department in the National Assembly from 2017 to 2024. A member of the Democratic Movement (MoDem), he presided over the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the National Assembly from 2021.

Bourlanges previously served as Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1989 to 2007. He was elected on the Union for French Democracy (UDF) list and sat with the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group.

He is a graduate of the Paris Institute of Political Studies (better known as Sciences Po), where he is currently an associate professor.

==Political career==
===Early career in local politics===
Bourlanges, a graduate of the École nationale d&#x27;administration who was appointed an auditor of the Court of Audit in 1979, was a municipal councillor of Dieppe (1983–1989) and regional councillor of Haute-Normandie (1986–1998).

===Member of the European Parliament, 1989–2007===
During his time as a Member of the European Parliament, Bourlanges served on the Committee on Transport and Tourism (1989–1993), the Committee on Budgetary Control (1993–1999), the Committee on Budgets (1994–2002) and the Committee on International Trade (2005–2007), among others. From 2003 until 2004 he chaired the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.

Following the 2004 European elections, Bourlanges was instrumental in establishing the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group in the European Parliament. In 2007, he left his parliamentary seat two years before the next elections. He was succeeded in the European Parliament by Brigitte Fouré.

Ahead of the 2007 French presidential election, Bourlanges was a vocal critic of efforts made by the Socialist Party&#x27;s candidate Ségolène Royal to seek the endorsement of his party, the Union for French Democracy. In the second round of the election, he supported Nicolas Sarkozy of the Union for a Popular Movement.

===Later career===
Bourlanges was a regular contributor to the radio broadcast &quot;L&#x27;Esprit public&quot; on France Culture until 2017.

===Return to politics===
Following the 2012 French legislative election, Bourlanges supported Jean-Louis Borloo&#x27;s initiative to establish the new centre-right Union of Democrats and Independents party.

Ahead of the 2017 presidential election, Bourlanges quit his role as a radio commentator and publicly endorsed Emmanuel Macron. He was critical of the Union of Democrats and Independents&#x27; support of The Republicans nominee François Fillon.

===Member of the National Assembly, 2017–present===
In the 2017 election for the National Assembly, Bourlanges was elected as the Member of Parliament for Hauts-de-Seine&#x27;s 12th constituency with the support of La République En Marche! as a member of the Democratic Movement. 

In Parliament, Bourlanges has since been serving on the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on European Affairs. From 2017 until 2019, he was also a member of the Finance Committee. Since 2019, she has also been a member of the French delegation to the Franco-German Parliamentary Assembly. In January 2021, Bourlanges was elected to succeed Marielle de Sarnez at the presidency of the Foreign Affairs Committee.

In May 2022, Bourlanges was a notable critic of the appointment of Pap Ndiaye as Education Minister in the government of Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne by President Emmanuel Macron. The following month, he won reelection to a second term in the National Assembly in the 2022 legislative election.

On 1 December 2022, Bourlanges was among the guests invited to the state dinner hosted by U.S. President Joe Biden in honor of President Emmanuel Macron at the White House. 

==Other activities==
* Institut français des relations internationales (Ifri), Member of the Board of Directors
* Jacques Delors Institute, Member of the Advisory Board
* Trilateral Commission, Member of the European Group

==Political positions==
In July 2019, Bourlanges voted in favour of the French ratification of the European Union&#x27;s Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with Canada.

<doc id="865191" wikidata="Q1418899" url="?curid=865191" title="Beurre manié">
<text>Beurre manié (French &quot;kneaded butter&quot;) is a paste, consisting of equal parts by volume of soft butter and flour, used to thicken soups and sauces. By kneading the flour and butter together, the flour particles are coated in butter. When the beurre manié is whisked into a hot or warm liquid, the butter melts, releasing the flour particles without creating lumps.

Beurre manié is similar to, but should not be confused with, a roux, which is also a thickener made of equal parts of sometimes clarified butter or many other oils and flour but is cooked before use.

Beurre manié is also used as a finishing step for sauces, imparting a smooth, shiny texture prior to service.

<doc id="865195" wikidata="Q3892696" url="?curid=865195" title="Water polo ball">
<text>A water polo ball is a ball used in water polo and canoe polo, usually characterized by a bright yellow color and ease of grip ability, so as to allow it to be held with one hand despite its large size. 

==Standard water polo ball characteristics==
Water Polo Balls come in standard sizes:
* Size 5: Men&#x27;s water polo ball. Circumference of the ball shall be not less than 0.68 metres and not more than 0.71 metres. Ball weight is 400-450 grams (14-16 ounces) and inflated to 90-97 kPa (kilopascals) gauge pressure (7.5-8.5psi)
* Size 4: Compact (age 14 &amp; under boys) and Women&#x27;s water polo ball. Circumference of the ball shall be not less than 0.65 metres and not more than 0.67 metres. Ball weight is 400-450 grams (14-16 ounces) and inflated to 83-90 kPa (12-13 psi) for women.
* Size 3: Intermediate (age 14 &amp; under girls and 12 &amp; under boys) water polo ball.
* Size 2: Junior (age 12 &amp; under girls and 10 &amp; under co-ed) water polo ball.
* Size 1: Splashball (age 8 and under boys and girls) water polo ball.

==Development of the water polo ball==
The modern game originated in the late 19th century as a form of rugby football, played in rivers in England and Scotland, with a small 3 to 4 inch ball constructed of rubber imported from colonial plantations in India. This &quot;water rugby&quot; came to be called &quot;water polo&quot; based on the English pronunciation of the Balti word for ball, &quot;pulu&quot;. The original ball soon gave way to a football (soccer ball), which allowed for passing and swimming above water with the ball. However, the leather football absorbed water and became extremely heavy, slippery and out-of-control when wet. In 1936, James R. (&quot;Jimmy&quot;) Smith, California water polo coach and author of several books on water polo mechanics, developed a ball made with an inflatable bladder and a rubber fabric cover, which improved performance. The new ball was red, but by 1948 yellow was adopted for better visibility by players. It became the official FINA and Olympic ball in 1956.

==Recent changes to water polo balls==

In the first half of 2005, FINA allowed a change to the standard water polo ball used in official games. This change permitted a coloured middle stripe (blue, green, red, black, or yellow) with the normal yellow stripes flanking the coloured.

In May 2006, the NCAA and National Federation of State High School Associations Rules Committees announced a rule change allowing the colored balls to be used in all NCAA and NFHS sanctioned games. The current rule states that the water polo ball must be &quot;yellow with black lines&quot;, but new wording will allow for colored panels. Mikasa Sports, manufacturer of the new colored ball, claims that the new ball benefits teams by making it easier for them to keep track of their balls, differentiating the women’s balls from the men’s and teaching proper rotation on the ball.

Unique designs and color combinations have been used to commemorate special competitions.

<text>Joseph Leinen (born 6 April 1948) is a German politician who served as Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1999 until 2019. He is a member of the Social Democratic Party, part of the Party of European Socialists.

He is well known for his environmental and foreign affairs activities, as well as for his support for a Federal Europe. He obtained a law degree in Germany in 1972 and a Certificate of Advanced European Studies from the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium, in 1974. Since 1977 he has worked as a lawyer.

== Extraparliamentary tasks ==

Leinen became publicly known as a spokesman of the anti-nuclear movement and the peace movement (1980), he was also active for the Bundesverband Bürgerinitiativen Umweltschutz (BBU). He received the nickname &quot;container-Jo&quot; during a demonstration, having climbed a container in order to coordinate protest actions by megaphone. 
Because of his participation at a demonstration against the Brokdorf Nuclear Power Plant (1981), he was briefly charged with being &quot;guide and ringleader&quot; of a rioting &#x27;mob&#x27;, however the Federal Constitutional Court eventually dropped charges against him, ruling that there can not be a case of &quot;guide and ringleader&quot; during collective actions. (One of his defenders at the time was Gerhard Schröder, former Chancellor of the BRD.) 

== Party ==

Jo Leinen is a member of the SPD and had different functions:
* 1977–1979: Europe-Secretary of the youth of the SPD
* 1981–1985: member of the committee of environment of the SPD
* 1985–1999: member of the state-directorate of the SPD Saar
* 1996 until today: member of the Europe-Commission of the SPD

==Career in national politics==
From 1985 until 1999, Leinen was a Member of the Landtag of Saarland. He served as State Minister of the Environment in the government of Minister-President Oskar Lafontaine between 1985 and 1994. 

From 1995, Leinen was also a substitute member of the Committee of the Regions (CoR), invariably standing in for Lafontaine. In 1999, he was also member of the municipal council of Püttlingen/Saar.

==Member of the European Parliament==
Leinen was elected Member of the European Parliament without interruption from 1999 until 2019. In parliament, he focused on environment, the development of the unification of the European Union and on foreign affairs. From 2004 he was the President of some key Committees and Delegations in the EP.

In 2015, Leinen was one of the Parliament&#x27;s two rapporteurs (alongside Danuta Hübner) on a set of proposed changes to EU electoral law that sought to regularize a variety of different electoral systems across the EU.

In addition to his committee assignments, Leinen served on the European Parliament Intergroup on a European Constitution from 1999 until 2009.

In the negotiations to form a coalition government under the leadership of Chancellor Angela Merkel following the 2017 federal elections, he was part of the working group on European policy, led by Peter Altmaier, Alexander Dobrindt and Achim Post.

=== EP Parliamentary activities, membership in Committees and in Delegations ===



== Commitment to European ideal ==
Leinen was Chairman of the German section of the Young European Federalists (JEF) from 1977 to 1979 and a member of its Federal Committee at European level, then chaired by Richard Corbett. He was European Secretary of the youth section of the SPD (Jusos) and Vice-President of the European Environment Bureau (EEB) in Brussels from 1979 to 1984.

He was member in the Committee of the Regions from 1995 to 1999 and in the Congress of the Regions and Communes of the Council of Europe. Currently, he is member of different organisations of culture, social and sport; and also vice-president of EUROSOLAR e.V (1988-2005).

He was President of the UEF (1997–2005). He served as vice-president of the European Movement International from 2005 to 2011 until in November 2011 he was elected president of the organisation.

==Other activities==
Leinen has been President of the Union of European Federalists since 1997. In addition, he holds various other positions, including: 
* Committee for a Democratic UN, Member of the Advisory Council (since 2004)
* Energy Watch Group (EWG), Member
* Union of European Federalists (UEF) Europa-Union Deutschland
* European Movement International, Member
* European Policy Centre (EPC), Member of the Strategic Council
* German Industry Initiative for Energy Efficiency (DENEFF), Member of the Parliamentary Advisory Board
* &quot;A Soul for Europe&quot;, Parliamentarian Working Group of the Advisory Board

<doc id="865211" wikidata="Q5890404" url="?curid=865211" title="Homes's law">
<text>In superconductivity, Homes&#x27;s law is an empirical relation that states that a superconductor&#x27;s 
critical temperature (&quot;T&quot;c) is proportional to the strength of the superconducting state for temperatures well below &quot;T&quot;c close to zero temperature (also referred to as the fully formed superfluid density, formula_1) multiplied by the electrical resistivity formula_2 measured just above the critical temperature. In cuprate high-temperature superconductors the relation follows the form

:formula_3,

or alternatively

:formula_4.

Many novel superconductors are anisotropic, so the resistivity and the superfluid density are 
tensor quantities; the superscript formula_5 denotes the crystallographic direction 
along which these quantities are measured.
Note that this expression assumes that the conductivity and temperature have both been recast in units
of cm−1 (or s−1), and that the superfluid density has units of cm−2 
(or s−2); the constant is dimensionless. The expected form for a BCS dirty-limit superconductor 
has slightly larger numerical constant of ~8.1.

The law is named for physicist Christopher Homes and was first presented in the July 29, 2004 edition of Nature, and was the subject of a News and Views article by Jan Zaanen in the same issue in which he speculated that the high transition temperatures observed in the 
cuprate superconductors are because the metallic states in these materials are as viscous as
permitted by the laws of quantum physics. A more detailed version of this scaling relation subsequently appeared in
Physical Review B in 2005, in which it was argued that any material that falls on the scaling line is likely in the 
dirty limit (superconducting coherence length ξ0 is much greater than the normal-state mean-free path &quot;l&quot;,
ξ0≫ &quot;l&quot;); however, a paper by Vladimir Kogan in Physical Review B in 2013 has shown that the 
scaling relation is valid even when ξ0~ &quot;l&quot;, 
suggesting that only materials in the clean limit (ξ0≪ &quot;l&quot;) will fall off of this scaling line.

Francis Pratt and Stephen Blundell have argued that Homes&#x27;s law is violated in the organic superconductors. This 
work was first presented in Physical Review Letters in March 2005. On the other hand, it has been recently demonstrated by Sasa Dordevic and coworkers that 
if the dc conductivity and the superfluid density are measured on the same sample at the same time using either infrared 
or microwave impedance spectroscopy, then the organic superconductors do indeed fall on the universal scaling line, 
along with a number of other exotic superconductors. This work was published in Scientific Reports in 
2013.

<text>Mobility: A City in Motion is a city-building simulation video game developed by Glamus as an initiative of DaimlerChrysler, with scientific data done by the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar. It is similar to &quot;SimCity&quot;, in that the game involves successfully developing a town into a larger metropolis; however, the focus is more on the ability of the citizens to use transportation to get around the area (hence the name).

Very fine control of traffic flow is given to the player — details all the way down to speed limits and right-of-way at intersections are options that can be selected in-game. Due to Mobility&#x27;s focus on getting around, most of the structures that can be built are dedicated to transportation, such as bus stops, parking decks, and train stations, although there are other basic gameplay items such as zones.

== Development ==
&quot;Mobility&quot; was released for Windows in 1999, according to the updates log in the download page in the game&#x27;s official German language website. The Linux version was released in May 9, 2001.

The current Microsoft Windows version is 3.02, released on 26 October 2012. The Linux version is still limited to 2.00. It is released as shareware, available on the Mobility web site. The cost of registration varies by country.

<doc id="865216" wikidata="Q355701" url="?curid=865216" title="Adema">
<text>Adema () is an American rock band from Bakersfield, California. The band formed in 2000 with members vocalist Mark Chavez, guitarist Tim Fluckey, guitarist Mike Ransom, bassist Dave DeRoo, and drummer Kris Kohls. After their first two albums, &quot;Adema&quot;, and &quot;Unstable&quot;, the band was plagued with years of conflict and lineup changes. Ransom left the band in 2003 followed by Chavez later in 2004 due to conflicts between themselves and other members of the band. Luke Caraccioli replaced Chavez in early 2005 for one album, &quot;Planets&quot;, but then left a few months later in late 2005. Vocalist Bobby Reeves and guitarist Ed Faris, both from the band Level, were recruited to join as well, but only released one album, &quot;Kill the Headlights&quot; in 2007, before entering a hiatus. The band&#x27;s original lineup reformed in late 2009 and toured, but both Ransom and Chavez left again before any new music would be recorded. Fluckey took over lead vocals from 2011 to 2017. The lineup released an EP, &quot;Topple the Giants.&quot; In 2013 Ransom returned once again; Chavez rejoined the band again in March 2017, only to leave again in 2019. He was replaced by Ryan Shuck. The band continued performing with Shuck, releasing two singles and a three song EP until February 2024 when Shuck departed from the band.

==History==
===2000–2002: Formation and self-titled release===
Before Adema, lead vocalist Mark Chavez, half-brother of Korn&#x27;s lead vocalist, Jonathan Davis, played guitar for B.P.D. (Big, Powerful, and Dangerous), guitarist Tim Fluckey formerly played with Juice along with bassist Dave DeRoo, who previously played with Sexart along with Orgy guitarist Ryan Shuck and Jonathan Davis, guitarist Mike Ransom formerly played saxophone of Ska band Mento Buru, and drummer Kris Kohls formerly played with Cradle of Thorns/Videodrone (who were previously signed to Korn&#x27;s Elementree Records). The association of Chavez and Kohls to Korn sparked a major label bidding war; ultimately, the band signed to Arista Records in a three-album deal in October 2000. Chavez said that the band&#x27;s decision to sign with Arista was partially influenced by their belief that the label&#x27;s president, L.A. Reid, was &quot;more of a music man than a corporate fuck.&quot;

The band&#x27;s eponymous debut album, &quot;Adema&quot;, was released in August 2001 to moderate success. It sold 46,800 copies in its first week of release to debut and peak at number 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Its two major singles, &quot;Giving In&quot; and &quot;The Way You Like It,&quot; received significant airplay on rock radio. All of the lyrics were written by Chavez, and the album was produced by Bill Appleberry (7th House) and Tobi Miller (The Wallflowers guitarist). Adema&#x27;s eponymous debut album was certified gold, and the band received a spot on the main stage during the Ozzfest tour. They kept playing live with the Music as a Weapon, SnoCore Rock, and Projekt Revolution tours. By September 2004, the album had sold 671,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

In 2002, Adema released &quot;Insomniac&#x27;s Dream&quot;, an EP, as a &quot;gift to fans.&quot; The single from the album, &quot;Immortal,&quot; was written for the video game &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot;. Besides the single, it included a track from international versions of &quot;Adema&quot;, a cover to Alice in Chains&#x27;s &quot;Nutshell&quot;, and four remix versions of songs from &quot;Adema&quot;. 2002 also marked Adema&#x27;s inclusion in the Resident Evil Soundtrack, contributing the track &quot;Everyone&quot; from their debut album.

===2003–2004: &quot;Unstable&quot; and lineup changes===
Adema&#x27;s second album, &quot;Unstable&quot;, was released by Arista in August 2003. It was produced by Howard Benson, whose credits also include producing albums with P.O.D., Hoobastank, Cold and most famously, for his work with post hardcore band Saosin.

The band has vigorously fought the label &quot;nu metal,&quot; preferring to be classified as traditional rock. While &quot;Unstable&quot; was not a significant break from their earlier sound, Chavez compared it to the rawness of Nirvana, and bassist DeRoo hoped that Chavez&#x27;s stronger voice (the result of voice lessons) would result in a more mainstream sound. &quot;We don&#x27;t go onstage and nu metal,&quot; said drummer Kohls. &quot;We&#x27;re sick of that phrase. ROCK – it&#x27;s such a broad word that it doesn&#x27;t categorize you.&quot;

Chavez and guitarist Ransom had a bitter rivalry that ended when first Ransom, then Chavez, left the band. During 2003, when the band released and toured for &quot;Unstable&quot;, Chavez and Ransom didn&#x27;t speak to one another. The band claimed that the split was no surprise. Ransom left in December, while the remaining four members finished touring.

Amidst this conflict, &quot;Unstable&quot; sold over 66% less than the band&#x27;s debut album. In December, the band learned that Arista was dropping them during a label merger. A large number of Arista&#x27;s staff was fired in a management shakeup by its parent company, Sony. L.A. Reid, who originally signed the band, had left the label a week earlier. The band has blamed low sales of &quot;Unstable&quot; on being dropped.

The band continued to write, but in February 2004, Chavez started to lose interest. He quit the band in September.

With regards to the split with Adema, Adema blamed the split on Chavez&#x27;s disinterest in the band. However, Chavez acknowledged personal problems and claimed that &quot;it takes two to tango,&quot; and that his decision precipitated from an argument with drummer Kohls over the direction of the band. Chavez would form the band Midnight Panic with his cousin and old bandmates Cesareo Garasa and Mike Montano, which released the self-titled &quot;Midnight Panic&quot; EP before dissolving.

===2004–2005: &quot;Planets&quot; with Luke Caraccioli===
The remaining three Adema members regrouped to write new music and auditioned for a new lead singer. After Kohls heard a demo from Rewind Yesterday, another Bakersfield band, he was impressed by the group&#x27;s lead singer, Luke Caraccioli. Adema asked Caraccioli to front the band. Luke Caraccioli accepted a few months later in January 2005.

Adema signed to metal label Earache Records in Spring 2004 when its manager, Al Dawson, heard them at a show. Under their new label, the band gained more control over their direction than they had when signed with Arista. Adema lauded Earache for allowing &quot;bands to express themselves creatively.&quot;

On April 5, 2005, the band would deliver their next album, &quot;Planets&quot; produced by Nick Forcillo. They released the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Tornado,&quot; back on February 18, 2005.

&quot;Planets&quot;, as an album, was musically, a significant break from Adema&#x27;s two earlier albums; it was much closer to rock than Adema&#x27;s nu metal history. In comparison to the previous albums, which featured heavy usages of programming and synthesizers, &quot;Planets&quot; features stronger piano melodies and guitar-drive harmonics. Kohls said that the band relied on influences from classic rock and that the band proved that they were &quot;so much more than&quot; a nu metal band. The writing for the album was shared between the four members with Fluckey recording all of the guitar portions of the album.

As a former marine, Caraccioli played his first show with Adema in the Persian Gulf in April 2005. They performed for American troops stationed in Iraq and Kuwait for the Armed Forces Entertainment. Though the Iraq War was still raging, the band stressed that the tour was apolitical. Adema then promoted the release by touring with Brides of Destruction, a band that Kohls had briefly been involved in. Though proud of their identity change, the band noted that they had a mixture of fans from both the &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; Adema at live shows.

In September of that year, the band released a second single from the album, &quot;Planets.&quot; The music video for the single was featured in the film, &quot;Cry Wolf&quot;.

In October 2005, after only 10 months, Luke Caraccioli left the band, citing personal reasons. Following his departure, the band got in touch with Mark Chavez and according to the band, both parties were back on good terms. Both parties even had talks about Chavez singing for Adema again and even wrote some new songs together, nothing transpired from these events until August 2009.

===2006–2008: &quot;Kill The Headlights&quot; with Bobby Reeves and hiatus===
In March 2006, Adema announced a new vocalist, Bobby Reeves, a former member of the band LEVEL. In August, the band recruited guitarist Ed Faris, also a former member of LEVEL. With their new lineup, the band signed onto Immortal Records in February 2007. They released &quot;Kill the Headlights&quot;, produced by Marshall Altman (Marc Broussard, Zebrahead) in August 2007. The first single, &quot;Cold and Jaded,&quot; was released in July.

In early 2008 Dave DeRoo announced the band decided to go on a &quot;hiatus&quot; to regroup, take a break, and assured fans they had not broken up.

===2009–2011: Reunion and departure of original lineup===
On August 13, 2009, Mark Chavez posted a blog on his official Myspace page stating that he had returned to Adema. He also planned for the band to write an album and begin touring before the release of said album.

It was later confirmed that both Mark Chavez and original guitarist Mike Ransom were back in the band. A second blog from the band&#x27;s Myspace stated that both Bobby Reeves and Ed Faris had agreed to leave the band and that this was the right thing to do for Adema and their fans, the blog went on to say, &quot;This SURE won&#x27;t be the last you see of Bobby or Ed, and we wanted to take the time to thank them for their service in the line of duty...&quot;

Adema announced on their official Twitter page that the first rehearsal with the original lineup in 6 years took place November 15, 2009.

The original members of Adema played their first show together in over five years on January 14, 2010, at Whisky A Go Go in West Hollywood.

A full 2010 tour list across the United States had also been posted on the band&#x27;s Myspace and Facebook page and new material was announced to be released around February 2011. The band went on their 2010 tour. However, Mike Ransom was unable to join them due to his commitments with recording an album with his band, Black Heart Vacancy. He left once again in November.

Mark Chavez abruptly left Adema once again before the start of the 2011 tour to pursue his solo project. Guitarist Tim Fluckey and Bassist David DeRoo have since taken over vocal duties.

The reason behind Chavez&#x27;s departure was that he had another conflict with the band. Chavez brought his wife with him on the band&#x27;s 2010 tour. When the band didn&#x27;t let her on the 2011 tour, he reportedly told the other members, &quot;Alright, if you think you can do this without me, you go right ahead.&quot;

In January 2011, bassist David DeRoo was arrested just prior to performing a concert in Connecticut, and was charged with being a fugitive of the law. A warrant for his arrest was issued in July 2010 for violating his probation issued from a prior DUI incident in November 2008. DeRoo&#x27;s bond was set at US$1 million. Being contractually obligated to fulfill their already scheduled 2011 tour dates, Tim Fluckey, Kris Kohls and touring fill-in and the Mentors lead vocalist and drummer Marc DeLeon performed as Adema in the absence of DeRoo.

===2011–2013: &quot;Topple the Giants&quot;===
On their official Facebook page, the band announced on July 19, 2011, &quot;We&#x27;re going in the studio this week! New music coming soon!&quot;.
Since then they had also announced a new EP, &quot;Topple the Giants&quot;, available for download in February 2012 along with a special edition disc in March. It included new songs along with old songs re-recorded with the current line-up. A full-length album was announced to be released later in summer 2012. However, on May 22, 2012, they announced that their new EP &quot;that was slated for release on all digital formats today has been delayed until further notice.&quot; After finally signing a deal with Pavement Entertainment in early 2013, the band had announced they would release Topple the Giants on the release date of April 2, 2013. Many have called the cover one of the worst metal album covers of all time.

===2013–2017: Mike Ransom&#x27;s second return===
On September 13, 2013, it was announced by Dave DeRoo that Mike Ransom had returned to the band once again.

===2017–2024: Chavez&#x27; third short tenure and replacement with Ryan Shuck===
On March 27, 2017, Mark Chavez was seen rehearsing with original members of Adema, signifying his return to band. They performed with him at the Whisky A Go Go on May 24, 2017, his first show with the band in six years. The band later confirmed that they were working on a new album. Following their last shows in December of that year, no news emerged until June 2019, when it was announced that Chavez had departed again. Julien-K frontman Ryan Shuck confirmed he would be fronting the band for their fall tour with Powerman 5000.
In March 2021, the band announced via their Facebook page that they are in the studio working on new material. Various pictures and videos of the band members recording their tracks were shown.
Adema released their new single with new frontman Ryan Shuck titled &quot;Ready to Die&quot; on August 20, 2021. On June 24, 2022, Adema released their second single with Shuck titled &quot;Violent Principles&quot;.

Adema debut their first EP with Shuck titled &quot;The Cerberus&quot; while embarking on 2023&#x27;s Nu-Metal Madness Tour 2 with returning bands Hed PE, Crazytown, and newcomer Tantric. The EP contains both previously released singles &quot;Ready To Die&quot; and &quot;Violent Principles&quot;, along with new single &quot;You Wanted This&quot; (released exclusively on the EP). Along with the new EP, a live recording titled &quot;Live at the Den in Los Angeles&quot; was also released.

===2024–present: Ryan Shuck&#x27;s departure and future===
On February 27, 2024, Ryan Shuck confirmed his departure from the band through his social media accounts, stating his time with the band came abruptly to an end and that he would be focusing on his touring commitments to Julien-K. The band announced in their own statement that they would be continuing as a four piece lineup indefinitely, though future plans and tours were not affected with the line-up change.

<doc id="865226" wikidata="Q985827" url="?curid=865226" title="Estcourt">
<text>Estcourt () is a town in the uThukela District of KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. The main economic activity is farming with large bacon and processed food factories situated around the town. The N3 freeway passes close to the town, linking it to the rest of South Africa.

==Location==
Estcourt is located at the confluence of the Bushmans and the Little Bushmans River. It is also on the main Durban - Johannesburg railway line some 160 km north of Durban and 25 km south of the Tugela River crossing. In earlier years the main road, later to become the N3, passed through the town. The town itself is 1196 m above sea level and lies in the hilly country that dominates most of the Natal Midlands. The Drakensberg lies some 41 km to the west of the town.

==19th century==
The earliest identifiable inhabitants of the Estcourt area were the San, a hunter-gather people, though rock engravings dating from four different Iron Age periods have been found on the farm &quot;Hattingsvlakte&quot;. The San had been displaced by the Bantu people, a pastoral people and in particular the Zulu, a tribe that traced its origins as a separate nation to the early eighteenth century. The San had sought sanctuary in the foothills of the Drakensberg. In the early nineteenth century the Zulu king Shaka used the Mfecane to build his empire, which led to a depopulation of the area. Thus, when the white settlers first arrived in the Estcourt area, the land appeared to be almost uninhabited.

===The first settlers===
The first recorded settlement in the Estcourt area was in 1838 when a group of Voortrekkers encamped on the banks of the Bushmans River in anticipation of securing land right from Dingane kaSenzangakhona, the Zulu king. The negotiator, Piet Retief, and his party were murdered by Dingane on 6 February 1838 and on 17 February attacks, since known as the Weenen massacre, were launched on the Voortrekker encampments along the Bloukrans River, the Bushmans River and the Mooi River. After a Voortrekker retaliation at the Battle of Blood River, Dingane was deposed and his place taken by Mpande. Mpande seceded the land south of the Tugela River to the settlers which included the area that was to become Estcourt. The Voortrekkers set up the Natalia Republic, but after the Battle of Congella in 1842, they abandoned their settlements and moved into the interior, leaving Natalia to the British who established the Colony of Natal. Thus Natal acquired an English-speaking rather than an Afrikaans-speaking settler community and Estcourt, being so close to the Tugela River become a frontier outpost.
In 1847 Clem Heeley was the owner of an inn and trading store at a ford on the Bushman&#x27;s River. On 4 December that year a military post known as Bushman&#x27;s River Post was established on a hill dominating the ford, whilst at the same time a village known as Bushman&#x27;s River was established across the river. On 4 January 1848 the Surveyor General recommended that the seat for the new magisterial district of Impofane be located at Bushmans River Drift. Initially the recommendation was ignored and the magistracy was located at Weenen, some 30 km away but in 1859, with the growing importance of Estcourt, the seat was moved there.

===The Byrne settlers and the name &quot;Estcourt&quot;===
The settler community was further strengthened by the arrival of the Byrne Settlers - English immigrants whose settlement in the Colony was sponsored by Thomas Estcourt, a North Wiltshire, MP. In 1946 there appears have been conflicting suggestions of why the town was called &quot;Estcourt&quot; - one body of opinion favouring the view that the town was named after Captain Estcourt, a member of the party who established the military outpost in 1847 and the other favouring the view that the town was named after Thomas Estcourt MP in 1863. Pearce, after extensive research which was backed up by the Ralfe family legend, supported the latter view which is now the accepted view.

===The settlement grows===
In 1872 an Anglican church was built on the banks of the Bushman&#x27;s River, and Fort Durnford was built in 1874 by Lt-Col Durnford, a military engineer, as a base for the Natal Mounted Police. The fort became a substantial stronghold, and was used to protect transport riders and the herds of cattle driven across the ford. It is as secure as any castle with drinking water tanks in the basement, a drawbridge, moat and two secret tunnels.

The confirmation of large deposits of coal in the Dundee area in 1880, some 100 km north of Estcourt led to the building of a railway line to link the coalfields with Durban. In 1885 the railway reached Estcourt and a bridge that is still in use today was built across the Bushman&#x27;s River. The completion of the line to the coalfields the following year provided Estcourt with a good communications link to the coast.

After a number of attempts to establish private schools had failed due to lack of support, the town&#x27;s first government school, the Estcourt Government School was established in 1886 with an initial role of 45 children. In accordance with the prevailing colonial policy, the school only admitted pupils of European descent.

In 1895, the traveller Ingram described Estcourt as having &quot; ... 
&quot;buildings [that] are strong and substantial, being for the most part constructed of hewn stone. A fort crowns the hill to the southward. There are in the town three churches, four hotels, and at the station a railway bar, A commodious sanatorium in connection with the Roman Catholic Mission has recently been established near the town. The population is put down at about 300 residents, though on market days, quite a large throng of farmers are to be met in its streets&quot;.&quot;

The mission station itself had been opened in 1892 - the second Augustinian Sisters establishment in Natal staffed mainly by French-speaking nuns from Canada and France. The mission had a school, sanatorium and a chapel for the Roman Catholic families in the town. The sanatorium was well used during the period when the railway line was being constructed and during the Boer War. Due to an economic depression after the war the school was unable to survive and the sanatorium had to complete with a nursing home that was run by one of the two doctors in the town. Changing attitudes after Vatican II and the opening of hospitals run by the Provincial Departments contributed to the order closing its mission and the sanatorium in Estcourt in the late 1960s.

In 1899, when he arrived at Estcourt as a war correspondent, Churchill described the town as &quot;a South African town—that is to say, it is a collection of about three hundred detached stone or corrugated iron houses, nearly all one-storied, arranged along two broad streets—for space is plentiful—or straggling away towards the country&quot;.

===Second Boer War===
When the Second Boer War broke out on 11 October 1899, the Boer forces had 21,000 men ready to invade the Colony of Natal. Ranged against them, the British had 13,000 men. The Boers under the command of General Petrus Joubert crossed the border into the Natal Colony and rapidly advanced to the Tugela river, laying siege to Ladysmith, some 40 km north of the river and entrapping some 8,000 British regulars. Estcourt effectively became the front and this is where General Sir Redvers Buller first established his Natal headquarters and where Winston Churchill, then a war correspondent based himself. On 15 November a raiding party ambushed an armoured train at Frere, 20 km north of Estcourt taking 70 prisoners including Churchill. After another raiding party was surprised on 23 November at Willow Grange, 10 km to the south of Estcourt, the Boers withdrew to a position behind the Tugela River. British reinforcements arrived and once Ladysmith was relieved on 1 March 1900, formal Boer opposition melted away and the colony was secured.

==20th century==
As the twentieth century dawned, Estcourt&#x27;s position as a communications hub was enhanced by the building of the Estcourt - Weenen railway line in 1907 to enable agricultural produce from Weenen to reach the main cities. (This line was closed in 1983).

===Municipal development===
Estcourt became a municipality in 1914. The Augustinian Order of Natal, having been present in the town since the 1890s built a chapel in 1929.

In the last census of the century, taken in 1991, the population of Esctourt was recorded as being approximately 3 407 whites, 710 coloureds, 5 432 Asians and 1 296 blacks.

===Industrial development===
During the twentieth century, Estcourt developed from being a market town serving the local farming community to one in which the products from the farming community were used in the manufacture of consumer products.

At some time close to the start of the twentieth century, Joseph Baynes, a Byrne settler and dairy industry pioneer, established a milk processing plant in Estcourt under the name of the Natal Creamery Ltd. This factory was located adjacent to the railway station. Baynes died in 1925 and in 1927 the factory, which by this time was owned by South African Condensed Milk Ltd. was bought by Nestlé. Today the factory produces Coffee, MILO and NESQUIK.

In August 1917 the Farmer&#x27;s Co-operative Bacon Factory Limited was founded and the building of the factory commenced. The factory was opened on 6 June 1918 by the Prime Minister General Louis Botha and marketed its products under the brand name Eskort. In August 1920, the company secured the services of Mr. H.W. Lambert of Scotland as &#x27;sausage maker&#x27;, thereby starting a tradition for quality sausages whose reputation has since become world famous. The following year the factory commenced exports to the United Kingdom and during the Second World War supplied over one million tins of sausages to the Allied forces all over the world and over 12 tonnes of bacon weekly to convoys calling at Durban harbour. A sister plant was built in Heidelberg and in 1967 the Eskort brand was the largest processed meat brand in South Africa. In 1998 the company was converted from a cooperative to a limited liability company.

1948 saw the establishment of the Masonite factory in Estcourt. Masonite was a hardboard product developed in the United States in 1924 by William H. Mason. The mill is in Estcourt, but its headquarters are in Durban and uses timber harvested from 21 922 ha of productive commercial plantations owned by the company. The mill currently employs 900 people and chips 600 logs a day.

In 1963 the 58.5 million cubic metre Wagendrift Dam was constructed on the Bushman&#x27;s River some 2 km upstream from the town of Estcourt. The dam was designed to irrigate 3,000 ha of land that lay upstream from the river&#x27;s confluence with the Tugela River.

===Education===
At the turn of the century, the Estcourt Government School had about 100 children and offered formal education only at primary level, although the occasional bright student was coached at secondary level to enable them to enter university.

By the 1920s the school had expanded to 226 children and in 1924 four children sat the matriculation exam. This sparked a growth in demand for secondary education, and in 1927 the school was split into two - Estcourt Junior School retaining the old school building and Estcourt High School (as the secondary school later became known) moving to Hospital Hill on the outskirts of the town. The new school had a boarding establishment, and soon the boarders outnumbered the day pupils.

After the Second World War, both schools continued to grow and in 1960 a second primary school - Drakensview Primary School - was built to accommodate the overflow from the Estcourt Junior School.

Towards the end of the twentieth century, the Siraatul Haq Islamic School and Madrasah was established to serve the large local Muslim community with a combined educational option, offering both Islamic and a secular academic curriculum. As of 2018, it is the best performing private school in the district.

==Today==
During the Apartheid era, Esctourt was a predominantly white and Asian town. The nearby Wembezi township was home to a large black population. In 1995 these two areas were incorporated into a transitional local council prior to the setting up of the uMtshezi Municipality. The new council continues to display the old Estcourt coat of arms on its letterheads. In 2008, the estimated population of the uMtshezi Municipality was 57189 blacks, 1726 coloureds, 6155 Asians, and 3244 whites.

<text>The Coeur d&#x27;Alene Tribe ( ; also Skitswish; Coeur d&#x27;Alene language: ) are a Native American tribe and one of five federally recognized tribes in the state of Idaho. The Coeur d&#x27;Alene have sovereign control of their Coeur d&#x27;Alene Reservation, which includes a significant portion of Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene and its submerged lands.

In &quot;Idaho v. United States&quot; (2001), the United States Supreme Court ruled against the state&#x27;s claim of the submerged lands of the lower third of Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene and related waters of the St. Joe River. It said that the Coeur d&#x27;Alene were the traditional owners and that the Executive Branch and Congress had clearly included this area in their reservation, with compensation for ceded territory. This area was designated in 1983 by the Environmental Protection Agency as Bunker Hill Mine and Smelting Complex, the nation&#x27;s second-largest Superfund site for cleanup.

Concerned at the slow pace of progress, in 1991 the tribe filed suit against mining companies for damages and cleanup costs, joined in 1996 by the United States and in 2011 by the state of Idaho. Settlements were reached with major defendants in 2008 and 2011, providing funds to be used in removal of hazardous wastes and restoration of habitat and natural resources.

Historically the Coeur d&#x27;Alene occupied a territory of 3.5 million acres in present-day northern Idaho, eastern Washington and western Montana. They lived in villages along the Coeur d&#x27;Alene, St. Joe, Clark Fork, and Spokane rivers, as well as sites on the shores of Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Lake Pend Oreille, and Hayden Lake. Their native language is Snchitsu&#x27;umshtsn, an Interior Salishan language. They are one of the Salish language peoples, which tribes occupy areas of the inland plateau and the coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest.

== Name ==
The French name &quot;Cœur d&#x27;Alêne&quot; translates to &quot;heart of an awl&quot;. The name is first recorded by the Lewis and Clark Expedition (1805) and was later popularly said to have been given by French traders to one of the chiefs of the tribe noted for his stinginess.
The alternative name &quot;Skitswish&quot; is recorded by Alexander Henry the younger in 1810 (as &quot;Skeetshue&quot;) and by George Gibbs in &quot;Pacific Railroad Report&quot; vol. 1 (1853). This is an exonym used by the Sahaptin.

The self-designation &quot;Schi̲tsu&#x27;umsh&quot; is reported from Coeur d&#x27;Alene phrasebooks since the 1970s.
A modern speaker of Coeur d&#x27;Alene was reported as interpreting this name as &quot;the discovered people&quot;.

The federally recognized tribe was named the Coeur D&#x27;Alene Tribe of the Coeur D&#x27;Alene Reservation, but they shortened it to Coeur D&#x27;Alene Tribe.

== Geography ==
Historically, the Coeur d&#x27;Alene lived in what would become the Panhandle region of Idaho and neighboring areas of what is today eastern Washington and western Montana, occupying an area of more than 3.5 million acres (14,164 km2) of grass-covered hills, camas-prairie, forested mountains, lakes, marshes, and river habitat. The territory extended from the southern end of Lake Pend Oreille in the north, running along the Bitterroot Range of Montana in the east, to the Palouse and North Fork of the Clearwater River in the south, to Steptoe Butte and up to just east of Spokane Falls in the west. At the center of this region was Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene. The abundant natural resources included trout, salmon, and whitefish. The tribe supplemented hunting and gathering activities by fishing the St. Joe and Spokane rivers. They used gaff hooks, spears, nets, traps and angled for fish.

== History ==
An Interior Salish peoples, the Coeur d&#x27;Alene people first encountered Europeans in 1793. Then their economy was based on fishing, hunting, and plant gathering, with seasonal migratory patterns and retreating to clustered semi-subterranean dwellings during the winter months.
The precontact lifeways of Interior Salish peoples are not widely written about, but available evidence favors the possibility of a recent expansion from the coast to the interior, possibly related to an increase in coastal population about 600 to 900 years ago.

The earliest written description of the Coeur d&#x27;Alene people comes from the journals of Alexander Henry the younger, a fur trader with the North West Company. He and British explorer David Thompson traded and traveled in their lands from 1810 to 1814. He wrote about the Coeur d&#x27;Alene:

The Skeetshue [Skitsuish] or Pointed Hearts [Coeur d&#x27;Alene] Indians dwell further southward [than the Kallispell or Pend d&#x27;Oreille tribes], about Skeetshue [Coeur d&#x27;Alene] Lake and [Spokane] River; they are a distinct nation, and have a different language [Salish] from the Flat Heads. They are very numerous, and have a vast number of horses, as their country is open and admits of breeding them in great abundance.

Ross Cox, a clerk with the Pacific Fur Company and then the North West Company, spent considerable time at the trading post of Spokane House between 1812 and 1817:

The Pointed Hearts, or as the [French] Canadians call them, les Coeurs d&#x27; Alênes (Hearts of Awls), are a small tribe inhabiting the shores of a lake about fifty miles to the eastward of Spokan House. Their country is tolerably well stocked with beaver, deer, wild-fowl, &amp;c.; and its vegetable productions are similar to those of Spokan. Some of this tribe occasionally visited our fort at the latter place with furs to barter, and we made a few excursions to their lands. We found them uniformly honest in their traffic; but they did not evince the same warmth of friendship for us as the Spokans, and expressed no desire for the establishment of a trading post among them.About twenty years before our arrival [hence in the early 1790s], the Spokans and Pointed Hearts were at war, caused by a kind of Trojan origin. A party of the former [Spokane Indians] had been on a hunting visit to the land of the latter [Coeur d&#x27;Alene], and were hospitably received. One day, a young Spokan discovered the wife of a Pointed Heart alone, some distance from the village, and violated her. Although she might have born this in silence from one of her own tribe, she was not as equally forbearing with regard to a stranger, and immediately informed her husband of the outrage. He lost no time in seeking revenge, and shot the Spokan as he entered the village. The others fled to their own lands, and prepared for war. A succession of sanguinary conflicts followed, in the course of which the greatest warriors of both side were nearly destroyed. At the end of a year, however, hostilities ceased; since which period they have been at peace. The two nations now intermarry, and appear to be on the best terms of friendship.
Many of the tribe were converted to Roman Catholicism in 1842 by Fr. Pierre-Jean De Smet, a Belgian Jesuit missionary from St. Louis, Missouri, who was active throughout the Northwest. The twin towns of De Smet and Tensed (originally Temsed), Idaho, are named for him. The United States acquired this territory in 1846 by treaty with Great Britain. European-American settlers and other immigrants began to move from the United States into parts of the territory in the 1840s. After the Indian defeat in the Skitswish War of May–September 1858, many more speculators were attracted after the discovery of silver in 1863 in the north Panhandle near the city of Coeur d&#x27;Alene. Mining and development revealed this to be an area of the second-largest silver deposits in the United States.

In 1873 the Coeur d&#x27;Alene lands were reduced to approximately when President Ulysses S. Grant established the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Indian Reservation by executive order. Chief Peter Moctelme traveled to Washington D.C. to meet with the President to discuss his disagreement of allotments. Upon ratification, Chief Peter Moctelme&#x27;s land was reduced by 1/3 and sold to white settlers. The US agreement with the tribe &quot;expressly included part of the St. Joe River (then called the St. Joseph), and all of Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene except a sliver cut off by the northern boundary.&quot;

As of 1885, Congress had neither ratified the 1873 agreement nor compensated the Tribe. This inaction prompted the Tribe to petition the Government again, to &quot;make with us a proper treaty of peace and friendship ... by which your petitioners may be properly and fully compensated for such portion of their lands not now reserved to them; [and] that their present reserve may be confirmed to them.&quot; Successive government acts put a reservation boundary across Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene, rather than following customary practice of using the high water line, and reduced the size of the reservation to near Plummer, south of the town of Coeur d&#x27;Alene.

== 20th century to present ==
Due to extensive mining and smelting operations in the Panhandle during the 19th and 20th centuries, there was hazardous waste in water discharges and pollution in air emissions. The mining industry &quot;left several thousand acres of land and tributaries, connected to the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Basin, contaminated with heavy metals.&quot; These mining operations have contributed &quot;an estimated 100 million tons of mine waste to the river system.&quot;

In the early 21st century, the federally recognized Tribe has approximately 2,000 enrolled citizens. The Tribe manages the sovereign Coeur d&#x27;Alene Reservation, which includes the lower third of Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene and the Saint Joe River, and their submerged lands. Members of the tribe reside in such area cities as DeSmet, Harrison, Parkline, Plummer, St. Maries (part on the reservation, population 734), Tensed, and Worley.

In 1935, Ignace Garry was one of a group of chiefs who managed the tribe. In 1949 he was selected as the last traditional chief of the Coeur d&#x27;Alene; he served until his death in 1965. During this period the tribe worked to restore its government under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. It gained approval of a written constitution in 1949 and elected representatives to the Tribal Council. In the 1950s, the tribe was one of several that came under termination pressure by the United States Congress. It helped found the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, an organization to represent the Salish peoples in both Coastal and Plateau tribes, and resisted termination of its federal status.

Within Idaho, in the late 20th century the Coeur d&#x27;Alene organized with the four other federally recognized tribes in the state to form the Five Tribes Council, including the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho, Nez Perce, Shoshone-Bannock, and Shoshone-Paiute. The peoples work together for mutual benefit, for instance, in applying for grants or negotiating with the state government on Native American affairs.

=== Government ===
The tribe reorganized under a written constitution approved by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, United States Department of Interior, on September 2, 1949, and amended in 1961. The constitution provides for an elected Tribal Council to serve as the legislature and governing body of the Tribe. It defined all tribal members of voting age as the General Council. At the time, the Tribe was still governed by Ignace Garry, the last traditional chief. The seven members of the tribal council are elected by citizens of the tribe to 3-year terms; with staggered expiration years. The elected head of the tribe is the chairman.

Since 2005, the chairman has been Chief James Allan (&quot;Chief&quot; is his given first name). Born in 1972 in Spokane, Allan grew up in Idaho on the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Reservation and graduated from Eastern Washington University in Cheney. He served in administrative and elected positions in the tribe and with the National Congress of American Indians in Washington, DC before being elected as chairman.

Joseph Garry, son of Chief Ignace, was the first Native American to be elected to the Idaho state legislature. He also served as chairman of the tribe for 10 years. In 1984 his niece, Jeanne Givens, was the first Native American woman to be elected to the Idaho state legislature, serving two terms.

The Coeur d&#x27;Alene Tribe operates a health care facility, which opened as the Benewah Medical Center in 1998 and was later re-named Marimn Health. The center was described by the Indian Health Service as a national model for Indian Health Care and rural health care. The clinic provides comprehensive primary care services including dental, mental health services, and community health outreach services to both the Native American population and general community.

=== Economy ===
Tribal businesses include the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Casino, Hotel, and Circling Raven Golf Club in southwestern Kootenai County, about three miles (5 km) northwest of Worley and thirty miles (50 km) south of the city of Coeur d&#x27;Alene, via U.S. Route 95. Tribal gaming employs about 500 and generates about $20 million in profits annually, funding programs, contributing to economic development.

The tribe also operates the Benewah Automotive Center, the Benewah Market, the first three floors of the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Resort, and Ace Hardware, which are located a few miles south of Worley at Plummer, in northwestern Benewah County. The tribe has invested in two businesses, a manufacturing plant (BERG Integrated Systems), and a bakery (HearthBread Bakery), in both of which the tribe owns a majority share.

The tribal farm covers about . It produces wheat, barley, peas, lentils, and canola. It also harvests timber among its natural resources.

=== Culture ===
Tribal traditions include a respect and reverence for natural law, and for responsible environmental stewardship. The tribe is active in the protection, conservation and enhancement of fish and wildlife resources; as well as conservation issues that impact tribal land and water resources.

Traditionally the tribe had a flexible kinship system with both paternal and maternal lines recognized within the extended family. People may claim ancestors on either side, and address all cousins the same. This enabled them to have a flexible society, as they would live in differently sized groups during different seasons, in order to adapt to the environment.

== Environmental suit, land claim and compensation ==
In 1991, the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Tribe began the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Basin Restoration Project. That year tribal leaders, including Henry SiJohn, Lawrence Aripa, and Richard Mullen, decided to file a lawsuit against the mining companies, as they were concerned that cleanup progress by EPA and the state was too slow in the Basin and at the Bunker Hill Mine and Smelting Complex Superfund site. They filed suit against Hecla Mining Company, ASARCO and other companies for damages and recovery of cleanup costs of the site. In 1996 their suit was joined by the United States.

In 2001 the United States and the Coeur d&#x27;Alene litigated a 78-day trial against Hecla and ASARCO over liability issues. In 2008, ASARCO LLC, reached a settlement of $452 million with the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Tribe and United States for the Bunker Hill site after emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

In 2011 the government, the Coeur d&#x27;Alene, and the state of Idaho (which joined the suit that year) reached settlement with the Hecla Mining Company to resolve one of the largest cases ever filed under CERCLA, the Superfund statute. Hecla Mining Company will pay $263.4 million plus interest to the United States and other parties to &quot;resolve claims stemming from releases of wastes from its mining operations. Settlement funds will be dedicated to restoration and remediation of natural resources in the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Basin.&quot; The trustees intend to restore habitat for fish, birds and other natural resources, for stewardship while working for economic progress in the region. This was one of the top 10 settlement cash awards in Superfund history.

In a related case, at the turn of the 21st century, U.S. courts ruled in &quot;Idaho v. United States&quot; (2001) that the Coeur d&#x27;Alene tribe has legal jurisdiction over the submerged land of the lower third of Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene, which the US holds in trust for the tribe, as well as under a related of the St. Joe River. The case was initiated by the US government to &quot;quiet title&quot; with the state, and the Tribe entered to assert its interest. The State of Idaho had appealed a lower court decision but that was upheld by the United States Supreme Court.

The tribe has worked with the US Department of Justice in filing suit also against the Union Pacific Railroad over contamination of the lake and related lands.

== Representation in other media ==
*&quot;Smoke Signals&quot; (1998) is an independent film that was set in the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Reservation. It was based on the short story, &quot;This Is What It Means to Say Phoenix, Arizona&quot;, collected in the book &quot;The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven&quot; (1993) by Sherman Alexie (Spokane-Coeur d&#x27;Alene). Alexie wrote the screenplay and served as film producer. The film focuses on a personal quest journey of two young men from the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Reservation. It was an all-Native American production.

<text>Goli Otok (; ; ) is a barren, uninhabited island that was the site of a political prison which was in use when Croatia was part of Yugoslavia. The prison was in operation between 1949 and 1989.

The island is located in the northern Adriatic Sea just off the coast of Primorje-Gorski Kotar County, Croatia with an area of approximately . Exposed to strong bora winds, particularly in the winter, the island&#x27;s surface is almost completely devoid of vegetation, giving Goli Otok (literally, &#x27;barren island&#x27; in Croatian) its name. It is also known as the &quot;Croatian Alcatraz&quot; because of its island location and high security.

==Prison==
Despite having long been an occasional grazing ground for local shepherds&#x27; flocks, the barren island was apparently never permanently settled other than by the prisoners during the 20th century. Throughout World War I, Austria-Hungary sent Russian prisoners of war from the Eastern Front to Goli Otok.

In 1949, the entire island was officially made into a high-security, top secret prison and labor camp run by the authorities of the People&#x27;s Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, together with the nearby Sveti Grgur island, which held a similar camp for female prisoners. Until 1956, following the Tito–Stalin split and throughout the Informbiro period, it was used to incarcerate political prisoners. These included known and alleged Stalinists, but also other Communist Party of Yugoslavia members or even non-party citizens accused of exhibiting sympathy or leanings towards the Soviet Union.

Many anti-communists (Serbian, Croatian, Macedonian, Albanian and other nationalists etc.) were also incarcerated on Goli Otok. Non-political prisoners were also sent to the island to serve out simple criminal sentences and some of them were sentenced to death. A total of approximately 16,000 political prisoners served there, of which between 400 and 600 died on the island. Other sources, largely based on various individual statements, claim almost 4,000 prisoners died in the camp.

The prison inmates were forced to labor (in a stone quarry, pottery and joinery), without regard to the weather conditions: in the summer the temperature would rise as high as , while in the winter they were subjected to the chilling bora wind and freezing temperatures. The prison was entirely inmate-run, and its hierarchical system forced the convicts into beating, humiliating, denouncing and shunning each other. Those who cooperated could hope to rise up the hierarchy and receive better treatment.

After Yugoslavia normalized relations with the Soviet Union, Goli Otok prison passed to the provincial jurisdiction of the People&#x27;s Republic of Croatia (as opposed to the Yugoslav federal authorities). Regardless, the prison remained a taboo topic in Yugoslavia until the early 1980s. Antonije Isaković wrote the novel &quot;Tren&quot; (Moment) about the prison in 1979, waiting until after Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s death in 1980 to release it. The book became an instant bestseller.
The prison was shut down on 30 December 1988 and completely abandoned in 1989. Since then it has been left to ruin. It has since become a tourist attraction and is populated by shepherds from Rab. Former Croatian prisoners are organized into the Association of Former Political Prisoners of Goli Otok. In Serbia, they are organized into the Society of Goli Otok.

<text>R-trees are tree data structures used for spatial access methods, i.e., for indexing multi-dimensional information such as geographical coordinates, rectangles or polygons. The R-tree was proposed by Antonin Guttman in 1984 and has found significant use in both theoretical and applied contexts. A common real-world usage for an R-tree might be to store spatial objects such as restaurant locations or the polygons that typical maps are made of: streets, buildings, outlines of lakes, coastlines, etc. and then find answers quickly to queries such as &quot;Find all museums within 2 km of my current location&quot;, &quot;retrieve all road segments within 2 km of my location&quot; (to display them in a navigation system) or &quot;find the nearest gas station&quot; (although not taking roads into account). The R-tree can also accelerate nearest neighbor search for various distance metrics, including great-circle distance.

== R-tree idea ==

The key idea of the data structure is to group nearby objects and represent them with their minimum bounding rectangle in the next higher level of the tree; the &quot;R&quot; in R-tree is for rectangle. Since all objects lie within this bounding rectangle, a query that does not intersect the bounding rectangle also cannot intersect any of the contained objects. At the leaf level, each rectangle describes a single object; at higher levels the aggregation includes an increasing number of objects. This can also be seen as an increasingly coarse approximation of the data set.

Similar to the B-tree, the R-tree is also a balanced search tree (so all leaf nodes are at the same depth), organizes the data in pages, and is designed for storage on disk (as used in databases). Each page can contain a maximum number of entries, often denoted as formula_1. It also guarantees a minimum fill (except for the root node), however best performance has been experienced with a minimum fill of 30%–40% of the maximum number of entries (B-trees guarantee 50% page fill, and B*-trees even 66%). The reason for this is the more complex balancing required for spatial data as opposed to linear data stored in B-trees.

As with most trees, the searching algorithms (e.g., intersection, containment, nearest neighbor search) are rather simple. The key idea is to use the bounding boxes to decide whether or not to search inside a subtree. In this way, most of the nodes in the tree are never read during a search. Like B-trees, R-trees are suitable for large data sets and databases, where nodes can be paged to memory when needed, and the whole tree cannot be kept in main memory. Even if data can be fit in memory (or cached), the R-trees in most practical applications will usually provide performance advantages over naive check of all objects when the number of objects is more than few hundred or so. However, for in-memory applications, there are similar alternatives that can provide slightly better performance or be simpler to implement in practice. To maintain in-memory computing for R-tree in a computer cluster where computing nodes are connected by a network, researchers have used RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) to implement data-intensive applications under R-tree in a distributed environment. This approach is scalable for increasingly large applications and achieves high throughput and low latency performance for R-tree.

The key difficulty of R-tree is to build an efficient tree that on one hand is balanced (so the leaf nodes are at the same height) on the other hand the rectangles do not cover too much empty space and do not overlap too much (so that during search, fewer subtrees need to be processed). For example, the original idea for inserting elements to obtain an efficient tree is to always insert into the subtree that requires least enlargement of its bounding box. Once that page is full, the data is split into two sets that should cover the minimal area each. Most of the research and improvements for R-trees aims at improving the way the tree is built and can be grouped into two objectives: building an efficient tree from scratch (known as bulk-loading) and performing changes on an existing tree (insertion and deletion).

R-trees do not guarantee good worst-case performance, but generally perform well with real-world data. While more of theoretical interest, the (bulk-loaded) Priority R-tree variant of the R-tree is worst-case optimal, but due to the increased complexity, has not received much attention in practical applications so far.

When data is organized in an R-tree, the neighbors within a given distance r and the k nearest neighbors (for any Lp-Norm) of all points can efficiently be computed using a spatial join. This is beneficial for many algorithms based on such queries, for example the Local Outlier Factor. DeLi-Clu, Density-Link-Clustering is a cluster analysis algorithm that uses the R-tree structure for a similar kind of spatial join to efficiently compute an OPTICS clustering.

== Variants ==
*Priority R-tree
*R*-tree
*R+ tree
*Hilbert R-tree
*X-tree

== Algorithm ==

=== Data layout ===
Data in R-trees is organized in pages that can have a variable number of entries (up to some pre-defined maximum, and usually above a minimum fill). Each entry within a non-leaf node stores two pieces of data: a way of identifying a child node, and the bounding box of all entries within this child node. Leaf nodes store the data required for each child, often a point or bounding box representing the child and an external identifier for the child. For point data, the leaf entries can be just the points themselves. For polygon data (that often requires the storage of large polygons) the common setup is to store only the MBR (minimum bounding rectangle) of the polygon along with a unique identifier in the tree.

=== Search ===
In range searching, the input is a search rectangle (Query box). Searching is quite similar to searching in a B+ tree. The search starts from the root node of the tree. Every internal node contains a set of rectangles and pointers to the corresponding child node and every leaf node contains the rectangles of spatial objects (the pointer to some spatial object can be there). For every rectangle in a node, it has to be decided if it overlaps the search rectangle or not. If yes, the corresponding child node has to be searched also. Searching is done like this in a recursive manner until all overlapping nodes have been traversed. When a leaf node is reached, the contained bounding boxes (rectangles) are tested against the search rectangle and their objects (if there are any) are put into the result set if they lie within the search rectangle.

For priority search such as nearest neighbor search, the query consists of a point or rectangle. The root node is inserted into the priority queue. Until the queue is empty or the desired number of results have been returned the search continues by processing the nearest entry in the queue. Tree nodes are expanded and their children reinserted. Leaf entries are returned when encountered in the queue. This approach can be used with various distance metrics, including great-circle distance for geographic data.

=== Insertion ===
To insert an object, the tree is traversed recursively from the root node. At each step, all rectangles in the current directory node are examined, and a candidate is chosen using a heuristic such as choosing the rectangle which requires least enlargement. The search then descends into this page, until reaching a leaf node. If the leaf node is full, it must be split before the insertion is made. Again, since an exhaustive search is too expensive, a heuristic is employed to split the node into two. Adding the newly created node to the previous level, this level can again overflow, and these overflows can propagate up to the root node; when this node also overflows, a new root node is created and the tree has increased in height.

==== Choosing the insertion subtree ====
The algorithm needs to decide in which subtree to insert. When a data object is fully contained in a single rectangle, the choice is clear. When there are multiple options or rectangles in need of enlargement, the choice can have a significant impact on the performance of the tree.

The objects are inserted into the subtree that needs the least enlargement. A Mixture heuristic is employed throughout. What happens next is it tries to minimize the overlap (in case of ties, prefer least enlargement and then least area); at the higher levels, it behaves similar to the R-tree, but on ties again preferring the subtree with smaller area. The decreased overlap of rectangles in the R*-tree is one of the key benefits over the traditional R-tree.

==== Splitting an overflowing node ====
Since redistributing all objects of a node into two nodes has an exponential number of options, a heuristic needs to be employed to find the best split. In the classic R-tree, Guttman proposed two such heuristics, called QuadraticSplit and LinearSplit. In quadratic split, the algorithm searches for the pair of rectangles that is the worst combination to have in the same node, and puts them as initial objects into the two new groups. It then searches for the entry which has the strongest preference for one of the groups (in terms of area increase) and assigns the object to this group until all objects are assigned (satisfying the minimum fill).

There are other splitting strategies such as Greene&#x27;s Split, the R*-tree splitting heuristic (which again tries to minimize overlap, but also prefers quadratic pages) or the linear split algorithm proposed by Ang and Tan (which however can produce very irregular rectangles, which are less performant for many real world range and window queries). In addition to having a more advanced splitting heuristic, the R*-tree also tries to avoid splitting a node by reinserting some of the node members, which is similar to the way a B-tree balances overflowing nodes. This was shown to also reduce overlap and thus increase tree performance.

Finally, the X-tree can be seen as a R*-tree variant that can also decide to not split a node, but construct a so-called super-node containing all the extra entries, when it doesn&#x27;t find a good split (in particular for high-dimensional data).

=== Deletion ===
Deleting an entry from a page may require updating the bounding rectangles of parent pages. However, when a page is underfull, it will not be balanced with its neighbors. Instead, the page will be dissolved and all its children (which may be subtrees, not only leaf objects) will be reinserted. If during this process the root node has a single element, the tree height can decrease.

=== Bulk-loading ===

* Nearest-X: Objects are sorted by their first coordinate (&quot;X&quot;) and then split into pages of the desired size.
* Packed Hilbert R-tree: variation of Nearest-X, but sorting using the Hilbert value of the center of a rectangle instead of using the X coordinate. There is no guarantee the pages will not overlap.
* Sort-Tile-Recursive (STR): Another variation of Nearest-X, that estimates the total number of leaves required as formula_2, the required split factor in each dimension to achieve this as formula_3, then repeatedly splits each dimensions successively into formula_4 equal sized partitions using 1-dimensional sorting. The resulting pages, if they occupy more than one page, are again bulk-loaded using the same algorithm. For point data, the leaf nodes will not overlap, and &quot;tile&quot; the data space into approximately equal sized pages.
* Overlap Minimizing Top-down (OMT): Improvement over STR using a top-down approach which minimizes overlaps between slices and improves query performance.
* Priority R-tree

<text>Ottaviano Del Turco (7 November 1944 – 22 August 2024) was an Italian politician.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Del Turco was born in Collelongo on 7 November 1944.

===Career===
After a career in trade unionism in the Italian General Confederation of Labour (CGIL), Del Turco rose to the top of Bettino Craxi&#x27;s Italian Socialist Party (PSI) before it was swept away in the Tangentopoli scandals of 1992–94. Del Turco was the president of the Antimafia Commission from December 1996 to May 2000. He was Minister of Finance in the cabinet led by the then prime minister Giuliano Amato from 2000 to 2001.

He was elected to the European Parliament in 2004 on the Italian Democratic Socialists (SDI) ticket and sat with the Party of European Socialists group. On 20 July 2004, he was elected chair of the committee on employment and social affairs at the parliament.

On 4 April 2005, he won the election as president of his native Abruzzo as candidate for centre-left coalition The Union, and on 1 May resigned his seat in the European Parliament to take up this post. In 2007, he founded the &quot;Reformist Alliance&quot; (Italian: &quot;Alleanza Riformista&quot;) movement within the SDI, with which he left the SDI and became a member of the Democratic Party (&quot;Partito Democratico&quot;, PD) at the PD&#x27;s founding congress on 14 October 2007. He was a member of the 45-strong national council. On 16 July 2008, he resigned as President of Abruzzo, and left the national council of the PD.

===Death===
Del Turco died in Collelongo on 22 August 2024, at the age of 79.

==Legal issues==
On 14 July 2008, Del Turco was arrested on suspicion of involvement in a €12.8 million fraud in the financing of the public health system of his region. He was not charged with a crime, but was suspected of corruption and criminal association, prosecutors said. He was among 10 people arrested or placed under house arrest.

Del Turco was sentenced to nine and a half years in prison for his involvement in the exchange of health sector bribes. He was convicted by a court in the city of Pescara on Monday 22 July 2013. The sentencing was in connection with a major €15 million (US$19 million) fraud in the financing of the public health system. In addition to the jail term, he was ordered to pay more than €3 million in damages and given a lifetime ban on holding public office.

<text>IrelandOffline (IOFFL) is an Irish consumer pressure group which was set up on 13 May 2001 to lobby for universal, affordable internet access in Ireland.

In early May 2001, the internet service provider Esat discontinued provision to 2000 users of its &quot;IOL Surf No Limits&quot; internet access package - a flat rate package - for what it deemed &quot;excessive usage&quot; of the service. This prompted discussions by disgruntled users on the ie.comp newsgroup, where it was decided that a pressure group was required to lobby Eircom (the former state-owned monopoly), Esat, Comreg (formerly the ODTR), and the Irish Government to take effective action that would ultimately result in universal Broadband Internet access to every home in the country.

Since its founding, IrelandOffline has changed its strategy and objectives as the market in Ireland has evolved. IrelandOffline&#x27;s current objective is &quot;Affordable Internet access for all&quot;;
*Affordable—comparable with other countries for comparable services.
*Internet—functional narrowband access (that is, not at rates as low as the 14 kbit/s currently available to a substantial number of households), and proper broadband access.
*Access—accessible to every household in the country.

Ireland Offline terminated its operation in August 2007 with Ireland still ranking low in the European broadband availability and usage statistics. 
IrelandOffline have reformed as of January 2009 due to the lack of activity, in regard to the provisioning of broadband, in the telecommunications sector since previously terminating.

<text>Margaret Leiteritz (1907–1976) was a German painter who studied at the Bauhaus in Dessau from 1928 to 1931.

==Early life and education==
Leiteritz was born in Dresden, Germany on April 19, 1907. Leiteritz was born into an artistic family as her father, Woldemar Leiteritz was an artist. Leiteritz attended a girls school until 1924 when she trained to become a librarian in Dresden and Leipzig until 1926. Following her training, Leiteritz worked at the Dresden Public Library until 1928 when she left after being accepted into the Bauhaus in Dessau in 1928.

Leiteritz took her prerequisite courses at the Bauhaus in Dessau under the instruction of Josef Albers, Hinnerk Scheper, Joost Schmidt, and Wassily Kandinsky. Leiteritz spent a large portion of her time at the Bauhaus with Hinnerk Scheper and Alfred Arndt studying in their mural painting workshops. Leiteritz continued her liberal arts education in studying under an array of artists such as Wassily Kandinsky and his abstract work, with Joost Schmidt and his writing and advertising, and Josef Albers&#x27; material and theory. She spent considerable time studying under Kandinsky and Klee in their free painting class having spent four semester in the class. Leiteritz also explored personal expression in Schmidt&#x27;s nude and figure drawing instruction in 1931. Ultimately, Leiteritz completed her vast array of studies and left the Bauhaus in 1931.

==Career==
Throughout her time at the Bauhaus, Leiteritz became known for her now famous wallpaper designs. She took part in a competition brought by wallpaper manufacturer Gebr. Rasch GmbH &amp; Company, and split prizes between her friend Hans Fischli. Subsequently, Leiteritz took wallpaper design as a priority and was appointed to head the production of Bauhaus wallpapers.

In her later life in the 1960s and early 1970s, Leiteritz produced &#x27;painted diagrams&#x27;, which drew heavily from the scientific articles and books in her care.

Many of her works were strongly influenced by chemical engineering, and especially the field&#x27;s graphs which depicted physical properties of substances. Leiteritz&#x27;s paintings typically reworked a mundane graph using large expanses of colour and a bold abstract theme, changing it into a dynamic painting. Other works are reminiscent of Bunsen burner flame or DNA gel.

One of her most famous paintings, &quot;Crossing at the Left Border&quot; (1966;il on linen), appeared on the cover of the catalogue for an art exhibition in Chicago in 1969. This painting is known to have been inspired by a specific graph appearing in an otherwise unremarkable paper of the American Institute of Chemical Engineering Journal.

Her work has much in common with that of Paul Klee.

<text>Jim Nance McCord (March 17, 1879 – September 2, 1968) was an American journalist and politician who served as the 40th governor of Tennessee from 1945 to 1949, and was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1943 to 1945. He was also Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Conservation from 1953 to 1958, and was a delegate to the state constitutional convention of 1953. Prior to state and national service, McCord served as Mayor of Lewisburg, Tennessee, from 1916 to 1942, and was publisher and editor of the &quot;Marshall Gazette&quot;.

As governor, McCord greatly increased funding for education, instituted a state sales tax, and enacted right-to-work legislation.

==Early life and career==

McCord was born in Unionville in Bedford County, Tennessee, the second of seven children of Thomas McCord, a farmer, and Iva (Steele) McCord. He was educated in the public schools and by private instructors. In 1894, he moved to Shelbyville, where he worked as a clerk at a hardware store. Two years later, he and his half-brother, W.A. McCord, opened a bookstore in Lewisburg (in Marshall County). From 1900 to 1910, McCord worked as a traveling salesman, gaining invaluable insight into the needs of Middle Tennessee farmers.

In 1901, McCord married Vera Kercheval, daughter of William Kercheval, publisher of the Lewisburg-based newspaper, the &quot;Marshall Gazette&quot;. In 1910, he began a long newspaper career as editor and publisher of the &quot;Gazette&quot; after purchasing a stake in the paper from his father-in-law. Two years later, he bought out his father-in-law&#x27;s remaining shares.

As an editor, McCord supported the &quot;Independent&quot; Democrats, a pro-temperance faction of the state Democratic Party, in the early 1910s. In the 1930s, he supported Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal. In 1942, McCord was elected president of the Tennessee Press Association.

McCord had a lifelong interest in livestock breeding, focusing mainly on Jersey cattle and Tennessee Walking Horses. He began working as an auctioneer of purebred Jersey cattle in 1920, and helped convince the U.S. Department of Agriculture to establish an experimental dairy farm specializing in Jersey cattle near Lewisburg in the 1930s. In 1935, McCord helped form the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders Association.

McCord&#x27;s political career began in 1914, when he was elected to the Marshall County Court. In 1916, he was elected Mayor of Lewisburg, serving until 1942 (13 consecutive terms). He was an elector for Roosevelt in 1932, and was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1940. In 1942, he ran unopposed for the 5th district seat in the U.S. House of Representatives (the incumbent, Percy Priest, had been redistricted).

==Governor==

In 1944, McCord sought his party&#x27;s nomination for governor in the race to succeed the incumbent, Prentice Cooper, who was term-limited. With the support of powerful Memphis political boss, E. H. Crump, McCord won the primary by a lopsided margin over Nashville attorney Rex Manning and Knoxville law professor John R. Neal, and defeated the Republican candidate, Greeneville attorney John Wesley Kilgo, in the general election, 275,746 votes to 158,742.

During his first term, McCord obtained significant appropriations for education, including $4 million for monthly raises for teachers and principals, and funding to provide tuition assistance for returning World War II veterans. He also signed a retirement law for state employees.

In the 1946 gubernatorial campaign, McCord beat back a primary challenge from former governor Gordon Browning (who was in Germany and did not actively campaign), and easily defeated the Republican candidate, W.O. Lowe, in the general election. The 1946 primary was marred by an uprising known as the &quot;Battle of Athens,&quot; which erupted when several hundred ex-World War II veterans launched an armed assault on the jail in Athens, Tennessee, where the sheriff and several Crump-linked figures had retreated with ballot boxes, presumably to fix local elections. McCord dispatched the state guard to restore order.

During his second term, McCord enacted a 2% sales tax, which Crump had reluctantly agreed not to oppose. The revenue from this tax was used to build new schools, buy school buses, and help implement the state&#x27;s first comprehensive program for grades 1 through 12. McCord also enacted right-to-work legislation, which was made possible by the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947. The enactment of this law alienated the party&#x27;s organized labor constituency.

In the governor&#x27;s race of 1948, Browning, determined to break the Crump machine, ran a strong campaign for the nomination. He assailed McCord for the sales tax, and accused Crump of voter fraud. Gradually, important constituencies, including veterans, black voters, rural voters, and organized labor, began abandoning Crump and McCord. On election day, Browning defeated McCord for the nomination, 231,852 votes to 158,854. It was the first defeat of a Crump-backed candidate in a major state election in over two decades.

==Later life==

McCord was a delegate to the limited state constitutional convention of 1953, which submitted several important changes to the voters for approval, most notably extension of the gubernatorial term from two to four years, and the repeal of the state&#x27;s poll tax. McCord also served in the cabinet of Governor Frank G. Clement as Commissioner of Conservation, from 1953 to 1958.

In 1958, at the age of 79, McCord ran for governor as an independent against the Democratic nominee, Buford Ellington, his former campaign manager and fellow Clement cabinet official. McCord received just 32% to Ellington&#x27;s 58%.

McCord died in Nashville on September 2, 1968, at the age of 89, a decade after his last run for the governorship. At the time of his death, he was the third oldest governor in Tennessee history, behind John I. Cox and Tom Rye, both of whom lived to age 90. Winfield Dunn has since surpassed their ages. McCord is buried in Lone Oak Cemetery in Lewisburg.

==Family and legacy==

McCord had a twin brother, Ed, who died at a relatively young age. His father, Thomas, fought for the Confederacy under General Nathan B. Forrest during the Civil War, and suffered a wound that required the amputation of part of his leg. Thomas McCord was married twice before marrying Iva Steele, and Jim Nance McCord had several half-siblings from these first two marriages.

McCord married Vera Kercheval in 1901. In 1954, a year after her death, he married Sula (Tatum) Sheeley. In 1967, after the death of his second wife, he married Nell (Spence) Estes. McCord had no children.

Buildings on the campuses of Austin Peay State University, the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, the University of Memphis, Tennessee Technological University, Tennessee State University, and the University of Tennessee at Martin, have been named in honor of McCord.

<text>5261 Eureka is the first Mars trojan discovered. It was discovered by David H. Levy and Henry Holt at Palomar Observatory on 20 June 1990. It trails Mars (at the ) at a distance varying by only 0.3 AU during each revolution (with a secular trend superimposed, changing the distance from 1.5–1.8 AU around 1850 to 1.3–1.6 AU around 2400). Minimum distances from Earth, Venus, and Jupiter, are 0.5, 0.8, and 3.5 AU, respectively.

Long-term numerical integration shows that the orbit is stable. Kimmo A. Innanen and Seppo Mikkola note that &quot;contrary to intuition, there is clear empirical evidence for the stability of motion around the and points of all the terrestrial planets over a timeframe of several million years&quot;.

Since the discovery of 5261 Eureka, the Minor Planet Center has recognized three other asteroids as Martian trojans: at the point, at the point, and , also at the point. At least five other asteroids in near-1:1 resonances with Mars have been discovered, but they do not exhibit trojan behavior. They are , , (36017) 1999 ND43, and (152704) 1998 SD4. Due to close orbital similarities, most of the other, smaller, members of the L5 group are hypothesized to be fragments of 5261 Eureka that were detached after it was spun up by the YORP effect (consistent with its rotational period of 2.69 h).

The infrared spectrum for 5261 Eureka is typical for an A-type asteroid, but the visual spectrum is consistent with an evolved form of achondrite called an angrite. A-class asteroids are tinted red in hue, with a moderate albedo. The asteroid is located deep within a stable Lagrangian zone of Mars, which is considered indicative of a primordial origin—meaning the asteroid has most likely been in this orbit for much of the history of the Solar System.

==Satellite==

On 28 November 2011, a natural satellite of 5261 Eureka was found. This unnamed moon is about 0.46 km in diameter and orbits 2.1 km from Eureka. The satellite&#x27;s existence was announced in September 2014.

<text>A speakerphone is a telephone with a microphone and loudspeaker provided separately from those in the handset. This device allows multiple persons to participate in a conversation. The loudspeaker broadcasts the voice or voices of those on the other end of the telephone line, while the microphone captures all voices of those using the speakerphone. The term speakerphone is also sometimes used for &quot;loudspeaker&quot;, as in &quot;put it on speakerphone&quot;.

Many telephones have an integrated speakerphone function which can be activated by pushing a single button. This button transfers the sound input and output from the handset to the ambient microphone and loudspeaker. Devices designed specifically for speakerphone use often have multiple microphone inputs arranged radially around the device to maximize sound input, such as may occur around a conference table. The most sophisticated units allow the connection of additional &quot;satellite&quot; microphones that can be placed some distance from the main unit.

==Types of speakerphones==
Speakerphones may be broadly divided into two classes of Duplex:
* Half-duplex
* Full-duplex

Half-duplex speakerphones allow sound to travel only in one direction at a time, either: 1) into the speakerphone from the telephone line and out of its internal speaker to its user, or 2) from its user, into the microphone, and out through the telephone line. While the users of the speakerphone are speaking, the phone only transmits sound to the telephone line; its internal speaker is cut off and no sound arriving from the telephone line can be heard by the user. While the user of the speakerphone is quiet, the speakerphone only receives sound from the telephone line and its internal speaker broadcasts that sound to its user. There is a very definite, noticeable switching action each time the phone &quot;changes directions&quot; and a cough or other transient noise in the room may interrupt incoming sound from the far end of the telephone connection.

Full-duplex speakerphones are able to transmit and receive simultaneously and there is no discernible change of transmission direction. These phones are much more complicated and often employ sophisticated digital signal processing algorithms to sort out the incoming sound and the sound in the room for echo cancellation. Their cost is also higher than for a half-duplex speakerphone.

==Speakerphone setup==
Many modern speakerphones must first be calibrated to the acoustic characteristics of the room in which they will be used. During this calibration phase, they may make a variety of noises including ascending tones or chiming sounds. This calibration may be automatic or manually invoked by the user, and it may need to be repeated if the speakerphone is relocated within the room. A failure to be properly calibrated can be indicated by the occurrence of echoing, ringing sounds, or feedback.

==Handset vs. base speakerphone==
Many cordless telephones have a handset speakerphone as well as a base speakerphone. The handset speakerphone allows hands free conversations away from the base unit. The base speakerphone is located in the base unit. The user must be at the base unit, but still gets the added benefits of having hands free conversations. Most base speakerphones have a secondary keypad for dialing calls on the base unit.

<text>Liver disease, or hepatic disease, is any of many diseases of the liver. If long-lasting it is termed chronic liver disease. Although the diseases differ in detail, liver diseases often have features in common.

==Liver diseases==
There are more than a hundred different liver diseases. Some of the most common are:
* Fascioliasis, a parasitic infection of liver caused by a liver fluke of the genus &quot;Fasciola&quot;, mostly &quot;Fasciola hepatica&quot;.
* Hepatitis, inflammation of the liver, is caused by various viruses (viral hepatitis) also by some liver toxins (e.g. alcoholic hepatitis), autoimmunity (autoimmune hepatitis) or hereditary conditions.
* Alcoholic liver disease is a hepatic manifestation of alcohol overconsumption, including fatty liver disease, alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Analogous terms such as &quot;drug-induced&quot; or &quot;toxic&quot; liver disease are also used to refer to disorders caused by various drugs.
* Fatty liver disease (hepatic steatosis) is a reversible condition where large vacuoles of triglyceride fat accumulate in liver cells. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a spectrum of disease associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome.
* Hereditary diseases that cause damage to the liver include hemochromatosis, involving accumulation of iron in the body, and Wilson&#x27;s disease. Liver damage is also a clinical feature of alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency and glycogen storage disease type II.
* In transthyretin-related hereditary amyloidosis, the liver produces a mutated transthyretin protein which has severe neurodegenerative or cardiopathic effects. Liver transplantation can be curative.
* Gilbert&#x27;s syndrome, a genetic disorder of bilirubin metabolism found in a small percent of the population, can cause mild jaundice.
* Cirrhosis is the formation of fibrous tissue (fibrosis) in the place of liver cells that have died due to a variety of causes, including viral hepatitis, alcohol overconsumption, and other forms of liver toxicity. Cirrhosis causes chronic liver failure.
* Primary liver cancer most commonly manifests as hepatocellular carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma; rarer forms include angiosarcoma and hemangiosarcoma of the liver. (Many liver malignancies are secondary lesions that have metastasized from primary cancers in the gastrointestinal tract and other organs, such as the kidneys, lungs.)
* Primary biliary cirrhosis is a serious autoimmune disease of the bile capillaries.
* Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a serious chronic inflammatory disease of the bile duct, which is believed to be autoimmune in origin.
* Budd–Chiari syndrome is the clinical picture caused by occlusion of the hepatic vein.

==Signs and symptoms==
Some of the signs and symptoms of a liver disease are the following:
* Jaundice
* Confusion and altered consciousness caused by hepatic encephalopathy.
* Thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy.
* Risk of bleeding symptoms, particularly taking place in the gastrointestinal tract

==Mechanisms==
Liver diseases can develop through several mechanisms:

===DNA damage===
One general mechanism, increased DNA damage, is shared by some of the major liver diseases, including infection by &quot;hepatitis B virus&quot; or &quot;hepatitis C virus&quot;, heavy alcohol consumption, and obesity.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlChronic Liver Disease/Cirrhosis | Johns Hopkins Medicine Health Library&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Viral infection by hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus causes an increase of reactive oxygen species. The increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species is about 10,000-fold with chronic hepatitis B virus infection and 100,000-fold following hepatitis C virus infection. This increase in reactive oxygen species causes inflammation and more than 20 types of DNA damage. Oxidative DNA damage is mutagenic and also causes epigenetic alterations at the sites of DNA repair. Epigenetic alterations and mutations affect the cellular machinery that may cause the cell to replicate at a higher rate or result in the cell avoiding apoptosis, and thus contribute to liver disease. By the time accumulating epigenetic and mutational changes eventually cause hepatocellular carcinoma, epigenetic alterations appear to have an even larger role in carcinogenesis than mutations. Only one gene, TP53, is mutated in more than 20% of liver cancers while 41 genes each have hypermethylated promoters (repressing gene expression) in more than 20% of liver cancers.

Alcohol consumption in excess causes a build-up of acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde and free radicals generated by metabolizing alcohol induce DNA damage and oxidative stress. In addition, activation of neutrophils in alcoholic liver disease contributes to the pathogenesis of hepatocellular damage by releasing reactive oxygen species (which can damage DNA). The level of oxidative stress and acetaldehyde-induced DNA adducts due to alcohol consumption does not appear sufficient to cause increased mutagenesis. However, as reviewed by Nishida et al., alcohol exposure, causing oxidative DNA damage (which is repairable), can result in epigenetic alterations at the sites of DNA repair. Alcohol-induced epigenetic alterations of gene expression appear to lead to liver injury and ultimately carcinoma.

Obesity is associated with a higher risk of primary liver cancer. As shown with mice, obese mice are prone to liver cancer, likely due to two factors. Obese mice have increased pro-inflammatory cytokines. Obese mice also have higher levels of deoxycholic acid, a product of bile acid alteration by certain gut microbes, and these microbes are increased with obesity. The excess deoxycholic acid causes DNA damage and inflammation in the liver, which, in turn, can lead to liver cancer.

===Other relevant aspects===
Several liver diseases are due to viral infection. Viral hepatitides such as Hepatitis B virus and Hepatitis C virus can be vertically transmitted during birth via contact with infected blood. According to a 2012 NICE publication, &quot;about 85% of hepatitis B infections in newborns become chronic&quot;. In occult cases, Hepatitis B virus is present by hepatitis B virus DNA, but testing for HBsAg is negative. High consumption of alcohol can lead to several forms of liver disease including alcoholic hepatitis, alcoholic fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. In the earlier stages of alcoholic liver disease, fat builds up in the liver&#x27;s cells due to increased creation of triglycerides and fatty acids and a decreased ability to break down fatty acids. Progression of the disease can lead to liver inflammation from the excess fat in the liver. Scarring in the liver often occurs as the body attempts to heal and extensive scarring can lead to the development of cirrhosis in more advanced stages of the disease. Approximately 3–10% of individuals with cirrhosis develop a form of liver cancer known as hepatocellular carcinoma. According to Tilg, et al., gut microbiome could very well have an effect, be involved in the pathophysiology, on the various types of liver disease which an individual may encounter. Insight into the exact causes and mechanisms mediating pathophysiology of the liver is quickly progressing due to the introduction new technological approaches like Single cell sequencing and kinome profiling 

===Air pollutants===
Particulate matter or carbon black are common pollutants. They have a direct toxic effect on the liver; cause inflammation of liver caused by and thereby impact lipid metabolism and fatty liver disease; and can translocate from the lungs to the liver.

Because particulate matter and carbon black are very diverse and each has different toxicodynamics, detailed mechanisms of translocation are not clear. Water-soluble fractions of particulate matter are the most important part of translocation to the liver, through extrapulmonary circulation. When particulate matter gets into the bloodstream, it combines with immune cells and stimulates innate immune responses. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are released and cause disease progression.

== Epidemiology ==
Liver diseases, including conditions such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcohol-related liver disease (ALD), and viral hepatitis, are significant public health concerns worldwide. In the United States, NAFLD is the most common chronic liver condition, affecting approximately 24% of the population, with the prevalence rising due to increasing rates of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Alcohol-related liver disease accounts for about 4.5% of liver-related deaths globally, underscoring the substantial burden of alcohol misuse. Viral hepatitis, primarily hepatitis B and hepatitis C, remains a leading cause of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer worldwide, despite advances in antiviral therapies and vaccination efforts. Additionally, recent studies have highlighted lean steatotic liver disease (SLD), a subset of NAFLD, affecting over 12% of U.S. adults even in the absence of obesity. These data emphasize the importance of early detection and targeted interventions to manage liver disease and its associated complications effectively.

New research reports the prevalence of lean steatotic liver disease (SLD) in the United States using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2017-2023), researchers estimated the age-adjusted prevalence of lean SLD at 12.8%. This includes 9.3% for lean metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, 1.3% for metabolic dysfunction and alcohol-related steatotic liver disease, and 1.0% for alcohol-related liver disease. 

==Diagnosis==
A number of liver function tests are available to test the proper function of the liver. These test for the presence of enzymes in blood that are normally most abundant in liver tissue, metabolites or products. serum proteins, serum albumin, serum globulin, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time.

Imaging tests such as transient elastography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging can be used to show the liver tissue and the bile ducts. Liver biopsy can be performed to examine liver tissue to distinguish between various conditions; tests such as elastography may reduce the need for biopsy in some situations.

In liver disease, prothrombin time is longer than usual. In addition, the amounts of both coagulation factors and anticoagulation factors are reduced as a diseased liver cannot productively synthesize them as it did when healthy. Nonetheless, there are two exceptions in this falling tendency: coagulation factor VIII and von Willebrand factor, a platelet adhesive protein. Both inversely rise in the setting of hepatic insufficiency, thanks to the drop of hepatic clearance and compensatory productions from other sites of the body. Fibrinolysis generally proceeds faster with acute liver failure and advanced stage liver disease, unlike chronic liver disease in which concentration of fibrinogen remains unchanged.

A previously undiagnosed liver disease may become evident first after autopsy. Following are gross pathology images:
==Treatment==

Anti-viral medications are available to treat infections such as hepatitis B. Other conditions may be managed by slowing down disease progression, for example:
* By using steroid-based drugs in autoimmune hepatitis.
* Regularly removing a quantity of blood from a vein (venesection) in the iron overload condition, hemochromatosis.
* Wilson&#x27;s disease, a condition where copper builds up in the body, can be managed with drugs that bind copper, allowing it to be passed from the body in urine.
* In cholestatic liver disease, (where the flow of bile is affected due to cystic fibrosis) a medication called ursodeoxycholic acid may be given.

<text>Violence: The Role-Playing Game of Egregious and Repulsive Bloodshed is a short, 32-page role-playing game written by Greg Costikyan under the pseudonym &quot;Designer X&quot; and was published by Hogshead Publishing in 1999 as part of its &quot;New Style&quot; line of games.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Violence&quot; is a satire of conventional dungeon-bashing games, set in a contemporary metropolis where the player characters dash from room to room killing the occupants and stealing their belongings. It is relentlessly user-hostile, taking time out to insult the reader wherever possible (it opens with the words, &quot;Welcome to &quot;Violence&quot;, you degraded turd&quot;) and uses a system where the user can buy experience points for cash from the designer or publisher. The rule-set provides information on a range of things related to killing. Weapons, combat styles, and the like are intricately detailed.

==Publication history==
&quot;Violence&quot; (1999) was designed by Greg Costikyan (aka Designer X) and was published with cover art by Clint Langley in 1999 as one of the &quot;New Style&quot; role-playing games published by Hogshead Publishing, a series of experimental and alternative role-playing games that included &quot;The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot;, &quot;Pantheon&quot;, and &quot;Puppetland/Powerkill&quot;. 

In August 2005, Costikyan released &quot;Violence&quot; under a Creative Commons license, and made it available for download.

A Spanish language edition exists.

==Reception==
In his 2011 book &quot;Designers &amp; Dragons&quot;, game historian Shannon Appelcline noted that &quot;Violence&quot; &quot;was probably the least loved of the New Style games. Like &quot;Power Kill&quot; it was a largely social commentary. It used humor and satire to critique violence in role-playing games and was sufficiently biting that [game designer James] Wallis thought of it as a &quot;Modest Proposal&quot; for the role-playing game industry. Set in the modern day, &quot;Violence&quot; lets players do dungeon crawls into places like the homes of illegal immigrants, kill them and take their stuff. However, satire did not necessarily produce a playable role-playing game on its own.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, &quot;The book is grotesque, sneering, and snide, explicitly calling itself disgusting and questioning the moral fiber of anyone willing to read it. It&#x27;s often quite funny but also gets at a deep frustration regarding the centering of violence in all sorts of play — tabletop games, videogames, make believe.

<text>Captain Cyril Edward Gourley VC MM (19 January 1893 – 31 January 1982) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Cyril Edward Gourley was born in Wavertree, Liverpool and educated at Calday Grange Grammar School and Liverpool University, graduating in 1913.

==First World War service==
Gourley had joined 7th Lancashire Battery of the IV West Lancashire (Howitzer) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery (Territorial Force) in May 1914. He was mobilised with his unit on the outbreak of war in August 1914 and went with it to the Western Front in September 1915. His battery was transferred to CCLXXVI (276) Brigade in 1916. In September 1917, he was serving near Ypres and was awarded the Military Medal for conspicuous gallantry in putting out a fire near an ammunition dump.

===Victoria Cross===
Gourley was 24 years old, and a sergeant in D (Howitzer) Battery of 276th (West Lancashire) Brigade, RFA, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 30 November 1917 at Little Priel Farm, east of Epehy, France, during the Battle of Cambrai, Sergeant Gourley was in command of a section of howitzers of the 55th (West Lancashire) Division. During an enemy advance, when their forces were within a few hundred yards of him, both to the front and on one flank, and though plagued by snipers, Sergeant Gourley managed to keep one gun firing. At one point he pulled the gun out of the pit and engaged a machine-gun at 500 yards, knocking it out with a direct hit. All day he held the Germans in check, firing over open sights on enemy parties, thereby saving his guns, which were withdrawn at nightfall.

The citation for his VC reads:

Gourley was originally denied an officer&#x27;s commission due to &quot;defective eyesight&quot;, but, after being made a second lieutenant in the RFA, later rose to the rank of captain.

==Post-war==
From 1919, Gourley worked for Lever Brothers, travelling widely to open up new business for the company. On his retirement a director of the company spoke of &quot;...his quiet, gentle courteousness and his readiness to do all he could for other people. In fact he was a jolly good man to have beside you when you were in trouble&quot;. In 1925, the Gourley family moved to Hill Close, School Lane, off Column Road, Grange, West Kirby; the house was later renamed Gourley Grange and the lane renamed Gourley&#x27;s Lane in his honour. The gardens created by the Gourley family have now been redeveloped as a small housing estate.

During the Second World War, Gourley was a firewatcher in Liverpool, and dealt with many of the air raids on Liverpool.

In 1952, Gourley, &quot;a modest, kindly and courteous gentleman&quot;, moved to Haslemere, Surrey, where he died on 31 January 1982, at the age of eighty-nine. He is buried in Grange Cemetery, West Kirby, Wirral. Gourley never married.

The Trustees of The Cyril Edward Gourley Victoria Cross Endowment, Registered Charity 525987, set up in his honour after the First World War from local donations, provide grants to University Students who attended schools, or reside in the Hoylake and West Kirby area, subject to certain conditions.

==The medal==
His VC, along with his other medals which include the Croix de Guerre, is held by the Royal Artillery Museum.

<text>Philippe Morillon (; born 24 October 1935) is a former French general and was a Member of the European Parliament until 2009. He was elected on the Union for French Democracy ticket with the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group. On 23 July 2004 he was elected Chair of the Committee on Fisheries.

Before turning to politics he was an army General, and commanded the United Nations Forces in Bosnia (1992-1993). In Srebrenica, Bosniak survivors fled into three eastern enclaves where the Bosnian republican army had resisted: Goražde, Žepa and Srebrenica, their populations swelled by displaced deportees, cowering, bombarded relentlessly and largely cut off from supplies of food and medicine. The population of Srebrenica swelled from 9,000 to 70,000, and by March 1993 the situation was sufficiently horrific that Philippe Morillon led a convoy into the battered pocket and, appalled, promised: “You are now under the protection of the UN forces. I will never abandon you.” The UN duly proclaimed Srebrenica as one of six “safe areas” to be defended by the United Nations Protection Force (our emphasis), or Unprofor. In July 1995, 8000 Bosnian men and boys were massacred in Srebrenica.

After Bosnia, Morillon commanded the Rapid Reaction Force, after which he retired with the rank of général de corps d&#x27;armée. He is a Grand Officer of the Légion d&#x27;honneur.

In September 2010, Morillon was denied access to Srebrenica Genocide memorial by Bosniak women who believed that he had allowed the Srebrenica massacre.

<text>The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is an American government-backed insurer of credit unions in the United States, one of two agencies that provide deposit insurance to depositors in U.S. depository institutions, the other being the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which insures commercial banks and savings institutions. The NCUA is an independent federal agency created by the United States Congress to regulate, charter, and supervise federal credit unions. With the backing of the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, the NCUA operates and manages the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, insuring the deposits of more than 124 million account holders in all federal credit unions and the overwhelming majority of state-chartered credit unions. Besides the Share Insurance Fund, the NCUA operates three other funds: the NCUA Operating Fund, the Central Liquidity Facility (CLF), and the Community Development Revolving Loan Fund (CDRLF). The NCUA Operating Fund, with the Share Insurance Fund, finances the agency&#x27;s operations.

, there were 5,099 federally insured credit unions, with assets totaling more than $1.84 trillion, and net loans of $1.16 trillion. The NCUA exclusively insures credit unions, whereas commercial banks and savings institutions are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

==Organization==
The NCUA is governed by a three-member board appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. The president also chooses who will serve as Chairman. No more than two members may be members of the same political party. Board members serve six-year terms, and cannot be reappointed to succeed themselves, unless initially appointed to fill the remainder of an unexpired term. Board members may, however, continue to serve until their successor is confirmed and takes office.

===Board members===
The current board members :
The NCUA is administered through three regional offices, each responsible for specific states and territories.

==History==
As part of the New Deal, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Federal Credit Union Act into law in 1934. The law allowed the chartering of federal credit unions in all states. The federal law sought to make credit available and promote thrift through a national system of nonprofit, cooperative credit.

At first, the newly created Bureau of Federal Credit Unions was housed at the Farm Credit Administration. Regulatory responsibility shifted over the years as the bureau migrated from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the Federal Security Agency, then to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.

In the 1940s and 1950s, credit unions grew steadily, reaching a membership of more than six million people at over 10,000 federal credit unions by 1960.

===1970s===

The growth in credit unions resulted in an overhauling of the Bureau of Federal Credit Unions to form the modern independent federal agency that presently regulates the industry.

In 1970, the renaming to National Credit Union Administration was made possible in part by the creation of the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) to insure credit union deposits. The NCUSIF was created without any tax dollars, capitalized solely by credit unions.

By 1977, services available to credit union members expanded, including share certificates and mortgage lending. In 1979, a three-member Board replaced the NCUA administrator. Congress added the finishing touches to this new administration with the addition of the Central Liquidity Facility, the lender of last resort for all credit unions.

The decade of the 1970s saw substantial growth for existing credit unions, with membership doubling and assets tripling to over $65 billion.

===1980s and 1990s===
The high interest rates and unemployment in the early 1980s brought insurance losses. The NCUSIF experienced strain, and credit unions lobbied Congress to recapitalize the Fund. In 1985, the plan became law, and federally insured credit unions recapitalized the NCUSIF by depositing 1 percent of their shares into the NCUSIF. The fully capitalized National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund has &quot;fail safe&quot; features. In 1991, when equity level dipped below 1.23 percent, the Board charged credit unions a premium to insure deposits. The enhancement of member services in the 1980s accompanied deregulation and increased flexibility in merger and field of membership criteria. Previously, membership in credit unions was generally limited to select groups with a pre-existing common bond, often employees of a particular company or trade. Changes since 1998 as a result of H.R. 1151, the Credit Union Membership Access Act, opened up membership eligibility to include much larger and loosely defined groups.

During the 1990s and into the 21st century, credit unions grew steadily in assets, shares and members. Failures remained generally low, and the Share Insurance Fund maintained a healthy equity level.

===2000s and 2010s===
During the 1990s and into the beginning of the 21st century, U.S. credit unions continued to develop as a whole. The NCUSIF also continued to thrive due to very few credit union failures. In 2008 and 2009, the global financial crisis exerted a strain on all institutions in the financial services sector – including credit unions. As a result, the Board charged NCUSIF premiums in 2009 and 2010.
Ultimately, five of the largest wholesale corporate credit unions (Constitution Corporate, Members United Corporate, Western Corporate, Southwest Corporate, and U.S. Central Corporate) in the United States were rendered insolvent after investing in troubled mortgage-backed securities that became overwhelmed with unprecedented declines in value. 
In response to the growing corporate credit union crisis, the NCUA took the following actions:

*Collaborated with the U.S. Treasury Department and Congress to establish the Temporary Corporate Credit Union Stabilization Fund (Stabilization Fund) to stabilize the U.S. credit unions, protect the NCUSIF and ensured credit unions, not taxpayers, paid the costs of the Stabilization Fund over time.
*Re-securitized the unsuccessful mortgage backed securities after liquidating the five failed corporate credit unions. With a government-backed guarantee, the securities were sold to raise nearly $30 billion.
*A temporary share guarantee was established for deposits at corporate credit unions.
*Bridge corporate credit unions were established to ensure services continued to be provided to consumer credit unions during the transition and resolution timeframe. 
*Worked together with bridge corporate credit union members and to ensure a seamless transition of services to new entities.

In addition to the corporate credit union crisis, the NCUA dealt with the failure of a number of consumer-owned credit unions, which weakened as a result of spikes in home foreclosures, business failures, and unemployment.

To protect against the failure of more credit unions, the NCUA implemented a 12-month examination cycle for federally insured credit unions to detect problems in individual credit unions before they became insurmountable. NCUA also stepped up administrative actions wherever necessary to ensure prompt compliance. By year-end 2009, more than 96 percent of credit unions met the statutory definition of &quot;well capitalized.&quot;

On December 8, 2017, President Donald Trump issued an executive order revising the Seal for the National Credit Union Administration.

On August 20, 2019, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld much of the NCUA&#x27;s 2016 field-of-membership regulations changes, and on June 29, 2020, the Supreme Court of the United States denied an appeal to review the NCUA&#x27;s 2016 field-of-membership rule.

=== 2020s and beyond ===
On March 10, 2020, the NCUA celebrated its 50th anniversary.

On March 16, 2020, in response to the global coronavirus pandemic, the NCUA issued a Letter to Credit Unions that outlines several strategies credit unions may consider when determining how to address the challenges associated with COVID-19. Throughout the pandemic, the NCUA provided targeted regulatory flexibility, where appropriate, so federally insured credit unions could manage their operational and financial risks. Notably, the NCUA worked to bolster the Central Liquidity Facility and enhance its ability to serve as a liquidity backstop for the system during 2020. Following the regulatory enhancements provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and changes to the agency&#x27;s regulations by the NCUA Board, the facility experienced a significant increase in its membership and borrowing capacity. 

Because the COVID-19 pandemic posed unique economic and financial challenges to rural and underserved communities, the NCUA committed the majority of its 2020 Community Development Revolving Loan Fund allocation to COVID-19 assistance. 

In 2021 and beyond, the NCUA&#x27;s goals include advancing economic equity and justice within the credit union movement and build on the agency&#x27;s ACCESS program. Plans call for enhancing support for minority depository institutions, ensuring compliance with fair lending laws, advancing initiatives to close the wealth gap, and proactively considering future challenges like climate change to mitigate risks posed by rising seas, climbing temperatures, and devastating wildfires. 

==Insurance coverage==


The National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) is the federal fund created by the United States Congress in 1970 to insure members&#x27; deposits in federally insured credit unions. On July 22, 2010, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law and included permanently establishing NCUA&#x27;s standard minimum share insurance amount at $250,000. The NCUA operates and manages the NCUSIF, insuring the deposits of more than 111 million account holders in all federal credit unions and the overwhelming majority of state-chartered credit unions.

Credit unions may also offer an array of additional financial services which are not covered by federal insurance.

==Website==
On March 9, 2011, then Board Chairman Debbie Matz unveiled MyCreditUnion.gov, a source of educational information and personal finance tips designed to help individuals make financial decisions. The website also explains how credit unions work, where to find one, and even how to start a credit union.

<text>Unstable is the second studio album by the American rock band Adema, and is the final album to feature its full original lineup with lead vocalist Mark Chavez and guitarist Mike Ransom departing from the band after its release and then again after their reunion, although they returned to the band in March 2017 (only for Mark to leave once again in 2019). The album was released on August 19, 2003 by Arista Records. It features the self-titled single &quot;Unstable&quot; and has sold about 400,000 copies worldwide. Many songs relied more on instrumentation and harmony instead of distortion in comparison to their previous album. It debuted at number 43 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 before quickly falling off the chart.

<doc id="865300" wikidata="Q980941" url="?curid=865300" title="IBM 305 RAMAC">
<text>The IBM 305 RAMAC was the first commercial computer that used a moving-head hard disk drive (magnetic disk storage) for secondary storage. The system was publicly announced on September 14, 1956, with test units already installed at the U.S. Navy and at private corporations. RAMAC stood for &quot;Random Access Method of Accounting and Control&quot;, as its design was motivated by the need for real-time accounting in business.

==History==
RAMAC was developed and manufactured at IBM&#x27;s research facility in San Jose, California. In 1959, IBM&#x27;s CEO Thomas J. Watson Jr. exhibited the RAMAC in Moscow. This led to a visit by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev to IBM&#x27;s San Jose facility. 

The first RAMAC to be used in the U.S. auto industry was installed at Chrysler&#x27;s MOPAR Division in 1957. It replaced a huge tub file which was part of MOPAR&#x27;s parts inventory control and order processing system.

During the 1960 Olympic Winter Games in Squaw Valley (USA), IBM provided the first electronic data processing systems for the Games. The system featured an IBM RAMAC 305 computer, punched card data collection, and a central printing facility.

More than 1,000 systems were built. Production ended in 1961; the RAMAC computer became obsolete in 1962 when the IBM 1405 Disk Storage Unit for the IBM 1401 was introduced, and the 305 was withdrawn in 1969.

==Overview==
The first hard disk unit was shipped September 13, 1956. The additional components of the computer were a card punch, a central processing unit, a power supply unit, an operator&#x27;s console/card reader unit, and a printer. There was also a manual inquiry station that allowed direct access to stored records. IBM touted the system as being able to store the equivalent of 64,000 punched cards.

The 305 was one of the last vacuum tube computers that IBM built. It weighed over a ton.

The IBM 350 disk system stored 5 million alphanumeric characters recorded as six data bits, one parity bit and one space bit for eight bits recorded per character. It had fifty disks. Two independent access arms moved up and down to select a disk, and in and out to select a recording track, all under servo control. Average time to locate a single record was 600 milliseconds. Several improved models were added in the 1950s. The IBM RAMAC 305 system with 350 disk storage leased for US$3,200 () per month.

The original 305 RAMAC computer system could be housed in a room of about 9 m (30 ft) by 15 m (50 ft); the 350 disk storage unit measured around . Currie Munce, research vice president for Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (which has acquired IBM&#x27;s hard disk drive business), stated in a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; interview that the RAMAC unit weighed over a ton, had to be moved around with forklifts, and was delivered via large cargo airplanes. According to Munce, the storage capacity of the drive could have been increased beyond five megabytes, but IBM&#x27;s marketing department at that time was against a larger capacity drive, because they did not know how to sell a product with more storage.
Programming the 305 involved not only writing machine language instructions to be stored on the drum memory, but also almost every unit in the system (including the computer itself) could be programmed by inserting wire jumpers into a plugboard control panel.

==Architecture==
System architecture was documented in the &quot;305 RAMAC Manual of Operation&quot;.
The 305 was a character-oriented variable &quot;word&quot; length decimal (BCD) computer with a drum memory rotating at 6000 RPM that held 3200 alphanumeric characters. A core memory buffer of 100 characters was used for temporary storage during data transfers.

Each character was six bits plus one odd parity bit (&quot;R&quot;) composed of two zone bits (&quot;X&quot; and &quot;O&quot;) and remaining four binary bits for the value of the digit in the following format:
 X O 8 4 2 1 R

Instructions could only be stored on 20 tracks of the drum memory and were fixed length (10 characters), in the following format:
:T1 A1 B1 T2 A2 B2 M N P Q

Fixed-point data &quot;words&quot; could be any size from one decimal digit up to 100 decimal digits, with the X bit of the least significant digit storing the sign (signed magnitude).

Data records could be any size from one character up to 100 characters.

===Drum memory===
The drum memory was organized into 32 tracks of 100 characters each.

The color code of this table is:

* Yellow – Storage
* Blue – Arithmetic
* Green – Input/output
* Red – Special function

codice_1 and codice_2 select the same track, containing ten 10-character &quot;Accumulators&quot;. As a destination &quot;L&quot; specifies addition, &quot;M&quot; specifies subtraction. (Numbers in these accumulators were stored in ten&#x27;s complement form, with the X bit of the most significant digit storing the sign. The sign of each accumulator was also held in a relay. However the 305 automatically converted between its standard signed magnitude format and this format without the need for special programming.)

codice_3, codice_4, and codice_5 do not select tracks on the drum, they specify other sources and destinations.

===Jumps===
The 305&#x27;s instruction set does not include any jumps, instead these are programmed on the control panel:

* Unconditional jump – the program exit code (P field) specifies a &quot;Program exit hub&quot; on the control panel, which has a wire plugged into it and, via distributors, to &quot;Program entry hubs&quot; specifying the first, second and third address digit of the instruction to jump to.
* Conditional jump – the program exit code (P field) specifies a &quot;Program exit hub&quot; on the control panel, which has a wire plugged into it and the appropriate &quot;Condition selector common hub&quot; to be tested, the corresponding two &quot;Condition selector output hub&quot;s have wires plugged into them and the &quot;Program entry hub&quot;s specifying the instructions to jump to or the &quot;Program advance hub&quot; to continue in sequence. Complicated conditions involving many &quot;Condition selectors&quot; could be wired to execute in a single instruction (e.g., Testing the sign and zero states of multiple accumulators), with one of several &quot;Program entry hub&quot;s activated.
* Multi-way jump – the destination track (T2 field) is set to codice_5 and the appropriate &quot;Character selector hub&quot;s on the control panel have wires plugged into them and the &quot;Program entry hub&quot;s specifying the instructions to jump to or the &quot;Program advance hub&quot; to continue in sequence.

===Timing===
All timing signals for the 305 were derived from a factory recorded &quot;clock track&quot; on the drum. The clock track contained 816 pulses 12 μs apart with a 208 μs gap for sync.

Reading or writing a character took 96 μs.

The 305&#x27;s typical instruction took three revolutions of the drum (30 ms): one (&quot;I phase&quot;) to fetch the instruction, one (&quot;R phase&quot;) to read the source operand and copy it to the core buffer, and one (&quot;W phase&quot;) to write the destination operand from the core buffer. If the P field (Program exit code) was not blank, then two (&quot;D phase&quot; and &quot;P phase&quot;) additional revolutions of the drum (20 ms) were added to the execution time to allow relays to be picked. The &quot;Improved Processing Speed&quot; option could be installed that allowed the three instruction phases (&quot;IRW&quot;) to immediately follow each other instead of waiting for the next revolution to start; with this option and well optimized code and operand placement a typical instruction could execute in as little as one revolution of the drum (10 ms).

Certain instructions though took far longer than the typical 30 ms to 50 ms. For example, multiply took six to nineteen revolutions of the drum (60 ms to 190 ms) and divide (an option) took ten to thirty seven revolutions of the drum (100 ms to 370 ms). Input/Output instructions could interlock the processor for as many revolutions of the drum as needed by the hardware.

==Hardware implementation==
The logic circuitry of the 305 was built of one- and two-tube pluggable units and relays.

==Related peripheral units==
A basic system was composed of the following units:

* IBM 305 – Processing unit, the magnetic process drum, magnetic core register and electronic logical and arithmetic circuits

<text>A piphat () is a kind of ensemble in the classical music of Thailand, which features wind and percussion instruments. It is considered the primary form of ensemble for the interpretation of the most sacred and &quot;high-class&quot; compositions of the Thai classical repertoire, including the Buddhist invocation entitled &quot;sathukan&quot; () as well as the suites called &quot;phleng rueang&quot;. It is also used to accompany traditional Thai theatrical and dance forms including &quot;khon&quot; () (masked dance-drama), &quot;lakhon&quot; (classical dance), and shadow puppet theater. 

Piphat in the earlier time was called phinphat. It is analogous to its Cambodian musical ensemble of pinpeat and Laotian ensemble of pinphat.

==Types of &quot;piphat&quot;==
The smallest &quot;piphat&quot;, called &quot;piphat khrueang ha&quot;, is composed of six instruments: &quot;pi nai&quot; (oboe); &quot;ranat ek&quot; (xylophone); &quot;khong wong yai&quot; (gong circle); &quot;taphon&quot; or other Thai drums; &quot;glong thad&quot;, a set of two large barrel drums beaten with sticks; and &quot;ching&quot; (small cymbals). Often other small percussion instruments such as &quot;krap&quot; or &quot;chap&quot; are used.

A slightly larger &quot;piphat&quot; ensemble is called &quot;piphat khrueang khu&quot;, and consists of eight musical instruments. The other two instruments are the &quot;ranat thum&quot; (xylophone), which produces a deeper sound than the &quot;ranat ek&quot;, and &quot;khong wong lek&quot;, a gong circle that is higher in pitch than the &quot;khong wong yai&quot;.

The largest form of &quot;piphat&quot; ensemble is the &quot;piphat khrueang yai&quot;, which consists of ten musical instruments. Another ones are &quot;ranat ek lek&quot; and &quot;ranat thum lek&quot;; these are almost the same as their ancestors, the &quot;ranat ek&quot; and &quot;ranat thum&quot;, but they have keys made from metal instead of wood.

===Piphat khrueang ha===

&quot;Wong piphat khrueang ha&quot; (, ) is an ensemble consisting of:
# 1 pi nai - bass oboe
# 1 taphon - secondary beat
# 1 ching - main beat
# 1 khong wong yai - bass gongs hung in a nearly full circular track
# 2 glong thad - Thai tympani
# 1 ranat ek - treble xylophone

===Piphat khrueang khu===
&quot;Wong piphat khrueang khu&quot; (, ) is developed from &quot;piphat khrueang ha&quot;, by arranging instruments in pairs of treble-bass. It consists of:
# 1 pi nai - bass oboe
# 1 pi nok - treble oboe
# 1 taphon - secondary timekeeper
# 1 glong songna or 2 glong khaek
# 2 glong thad - Thai tympani
# 1 ching - main timekeeper
# 1 chap
# 1 khong wong yai - bass gongs hung in semicircular track
# 1 khong wong lek - treble version of gongs hung in semicircular track
# 1 khong mong
# 1 ranat ek - treble xylophone
# 1 ranat thum - bass xylophone

===Piphat khrueang yai===

&quot;Wong piphat khrueang yai&quot; (, ) is arranged by adding &quot;ranat ek lek&quot; (ระนาดเอกเหล็ก; treble metallophone) and &quot;ranat thum lek&quot; (ระนาดทุ้มเหล็ก; bass metallophone) to the &quot;wong piphat khrueang khu&quot;.

===Piphat nang hong===
&quot;Wong piphat nang hong&quot; (, ) is an ensemble used in funerals. It is arranged by replacing the &quot;pi nai&quot; and &quot;pi nok&quot; with a &quot;pi chawa&quot;. The name &quot;nang hong&quot; comes from name of its main music, which is intended for funeral ceremonies. A royal variant for Thai royal funerals, &quot;Wong piphat nang hong khruang yai&quot; (for the King) or &quot;Wong piphat nang hong khrueang khu&quot; (for senior members of the Royal Family), introduced during the reign of King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) for use in royal funerals of the Chakri Dynasty, was reinstated during the reign of King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) in 1995, during the state funeral rites for Srinagarindra, the Princess Mother, upon the initiative of Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, the Princess Royal, after years of absence. If playing for the king, the royal funeral ensemble has 10 to 12 instruments played, a few more than the simple ensemble, for senior members 8 to 9 instruments are used.

In some funerals in Thailand the &quot;nang hong&quot; variant ensemble is supplemented by Western instruments like trumpets, saxophones, clarinets and even a drum kit, guitars and an electric piano. Some of these have also appeared in the normal ensembles.

===Piphat duek dam ban===
&quot;Wong piphat duek dam ban&quot; (, , literally &quot;ancient ensemble&quot;) was proposed by Prince Naris. It consists of:

#1 ranat ek
#1 taphon
#1 ranat thum
#1 ranat thum lek
#1 khong wong yai
#1 ching
#1 taphon - &quot;tympani&quot; made by using two taphons arranged together.
#1 saw u
#1 khlui u - bass flute
#1 khlui phiang aw - medium
#1 wong khong chai - a set of 7 khong chai with different size hung on wooden bar.

===Piphat mon===

The &quot;piphat mon&quot; is believed to derive from the Mon people, an ancient Mon-Khmer-speaking people of mainland Southeast Asia, and uses special instruments such as an upright gong circle called &quot;khong mon&quot;. &quot;Wong piphat mon&quot; (, ) has three sizes:

====Piphat mon khrueang ha====
&quot;Wong piphat mon khrueang ha&quot; (, ) consists of:
#1 ranat ek
#1 pi mon - bass oboe with horn-shaped end.
#1 khong mon wong yai - a set of bass gongs set in vertical frame (unlike khong wong yai, which gongs are set in horizontal semicircular frame).
#1 poengmang khok (เปิงมางคอก) or &quot;khok poeng&quot; (คอกเปิง) - Mon drums set in cage-shaped frame.
# ching, chap and khong mong

====Piphat mon khrueang khu====
&quot;Wong piphat mon khrueang khu&quot; (, ) is arranged by adding &quot;ranat thum&quot; and &quot;khong mon wong lek&quot; to the &quot;piphat mon khrueang ha&quot;.

====Piphat mon khrueang yai====
&quot;Wong piphat mon khrueang yai&quot; (, ) is arranged by adding &quot;ranat ek lek&quot; and &quot;ranat thum lek&quot; to the &quot;piphat mon khrueang khu&quot;.

The &quot;piphat mon&quot; ensemble is usually used in funerals, but it can be used for other events as well.

The &quot;piphat&quot; ensemble can be mixed with the &quot;khrueang sai&quot; ensemble to create a new ensemble called &quot;khrueang sai prasom piphat&quot; (เครื่องสายประสมปี่พาทย์ or เครื่องสายผสมปี่พาทย์). This hybrid or combined ensemble can also accommodate Western instruments as well.

==Similar ensembles==
The Cambodian equivalent of the &quot;piphat&quot; is called &quot;pinpeat&quot;. The Myanmar equivalent to &quot;piphat&quot; is known as &quot;hsaing waing&quot;. The instrumentation is very similar to the Piphat Mon, which indicates a common origin. 

Gong-chime ensembles are also found in other Southeast Asian nations, such as Gamelan in Indonesia, and Kulintang in the Philippines. 

Gong-chime ensembles can also be found in Vietnam, although they&#x27;re no longer played among the ethnic Viet, they&#x27;re still played among the indigenous peoples in the Space of gong culture, as well as among the Muong people and the Thổ people.

<doc id="865304" wikidata="Q1071280" url="?curid=865304" title="Chevrolet S-10">
<text>The Chevrolet S-10 is a compact pickup truck produced by Chevrolet. It was the first domestically-built compact pickup of the big three American automakers. When it was first introduced as a &quot;quarter-ton pickup&quot; in 1981 for the 1982 model year, the GMC version was known as the S-15 and later renamed the GMC Sonoma. A high-performance version of the latter was released in 1991, called &quot;Syclone&quot;. The pickup was also sold by Isuzu as the Hombre from 1996 through 2000, but only in North America. There was also an SUV version, the Chevrolet S-10 Blazer/GMC S-15 Jimmy. An electric version was leased as a fleet vehicle in 1997 and 1998. These models are sometimes internally referred to as the S/T series to denote two- and four-wheel-drive models respectively (similar to the full-size Chevrolet C/K trucks) despite all versions being badged with &quot;S&quot; nomenclature.

In North America, the S-series was replaced by the Chevrolet Colorado, GMC Canyon, and Isuzu i-Series in 2004.

The S-series ended production in Brazil in 2012, being replaced by the Chevrolet Colorado, but still with the name S-10.

==First generation (1982)==
After the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the demand for smaller and more affordable utility vehicles had increased in North America. General Motors&#x27; initial response to this was the Chevrolet Light Utility Vehicle (LUV), a rebadged Isuzu KB which was introduced in 1972 as the first compact truck from the Big Three automakers. However, the American chicken tax stated that imported utility vehicles would be subject to a 25% tax charge. This meant that, despite the U.S. branding, the LUV&#x27;s Japanese origins made it expensive and complicated to import, with many needing to be shipped disassembled to get around the tax. To solve this, GM opted to replace the LUV with a domestically built compact truck which would no longer be subject to the chicken tax. As usual, parts from other GM chassis lines (primarily from the GM G-body intermediates) were incorporated. Track width was similar to the former GM H-body subcompacts (Vega/Monza). The first S-series pickups were introduced in 1981 for the 1982 model year. The base engine (manufactured in Japan and imported) was a 1.9 L Isuzu four-cylinder (RPO LR1) shared with the LUV and Isuzu P&#x27;up, with a 2.8 L V6 as an option. The Chevrolet and GMC models were identical apart from the grille, tailgate and assorted insignia. For 1983, an extended cab, called &quot;Maxi-Cab&quot; on Chevrolet models and &quot;Club Coupe&quot; on GMCs, and &quot;Insta-Trac&quot; four-wheel drive were added, along with two new engines: a 2.0 L four-cylinder engine (RPO LQ2) from the J-platform automobiles along with an Isuzu 2.2 L (RPO LQ7) four-cylinder diesel engine.
The sport utility S-10 Blazer and S-15 Jimmy debuted for 1983; GM was the first to introduce the compact sport utility, followed by Ford and then Jeep the following year. Following the popularity of the Jeep Cherokee, 4-door SUV variants were introduced in March 1990 as 1991 models alongside the badge-engineered Oldsmobile Bravada.

New heavy-duty and off-road suspensions appeared in 1984 along with a hydraulic clutch, while the big news for 1985 was the discontinuation of the Cavalier&#x27;s 2.0 L OHV I4 in favor of Pontiac&#x27;s 2.5 L &quot;Iron Duke&quot; OHV I4. The 2.2 L OHV diesel engine and 1.9 L SOHC gas engine, both from Isuzu, were gone the next year, leaving just the Iron Duke and updated 2.8 L V6. A much-welcomed 4.3 L V6 was added for 1988, and anti-lock brakes came the next year.
The GMC S-15 became the GMC Sonoma in 1991, and the Sierra trim packages were dropped to avoid confusion with the new GMC Sierra full-size pickup. The GMC Syclone also appeared that year, with an SUV version, the GMC Typhoon, making its debut the year after that. The Sonoma GT bowed in 1992. Added to this was the 4.3 L V6 Vortec W-code engine. This generation&#x27;s last year was 1993.

===Appearance packages===
The S-10 Baja was an optional appearance package that was put on any four-wheel-drive S-10 (regular-cab with short-box, regular-cab with long box, and extended-cab with short box) from 1989 to 1991. The Baja was available in three colors: Midnight Black, Apple Red and Frost White. The Baja option also included a roll bar with off-road lights, front tubular grille guard with fog lights, tubular rear bumper, an underbody shield package (transfer case shield, front differential shield, fuel tank shield, oil pan/steering linkage shields), a suspension package, Chevrolet windshield banner, Baja decals on the box sides, and one inch wide body striping. Extra-cost Baja options included a cargo-net end-gate, aluminum &quot;Outlaw&quot; wheels, and a special box-mounted spare tire carrier with aluminum wheel. 1991 S-10 Bajas came with special &quot;BAJA&quot; embroidered red and gray bucket seats and unique red door panel trim.

The S-10 Cameo and Cameo EL were appearance packages available for the two-wheel drive S-10 between 1989 and 1991. When first introduced in 1989, the Cameo had three color choices; Apple Red, Frost White or Midnight Black. In 1991, two-tone paint schemes were available, as well as additional exterior features such as a wraparound front bumper with fog lamps, lower body ground-effects moldings and wheel flares, a flush-fitting tailgate valance, rear roll pan (state laws permitting), and &quot;Cameo&quot; lettering on the doors and tailgate. Other appearance packages included the S-10 Back Country (predecessor to the Baja), the S-10 Top Gun edition, the GMC Sonoma SST, the GMC S-15 Gypsy Magic, and GMC Jimmy Magic.

===Sonoma GT===
Debuting in 1992, the GMC Sonoma GT was a performance package available on the two-wheel-drive, regular-cab, short-bed Sonoma, and was offered as a lower-priced alternative to its predecessor, the 1991 Syclone. The Sonoma GT was powered by an enhanced Vortec non-turbocharged 4.3L L35 V6. It featured central multi-port fuel injection and produced and of torque. It was equipped with a 4L60 automatic transmission and a limited-slip differential with 3.42:1 gearing. Because the Sonoma GT was not built as a track-oriented speed demon like the Syclone, it still retained its payload capacity and towing ratings meaning that the owner could still use it like a pickup truck if they so desired.

Modified by Production Automotive Services of Troy, Michigan, the Sonoma GT featured a unique &quot;Syclone-inspired&quot; cladding kit. While sharing the same front and rear bumper as the Syclone (and future 92–93 GMC Typhoon), the aero package did not have as much of an aggressive look as the Syclone but still featured bumperettes, lower door skirts, and rear quarter bed corners to round out the cladding package. GMC also decided to follow through with the Syclone theme into the interior which featured the same black and red piping door inserts and bucket seats, but without any headrest logo (the Syclone featured embroidered headrest logos), along with the same center console and shifter as seen in the Syclone. The gauge cluster was also the same setup; however, due to the non-turbocharged powerplant of the Sonoma GT, the boost gauge is not included in the RPM cluster. The Sonoma GT&#x27;s production only lasted for 1992.

Only 806 Sonoma GTs were ever produced, in a variety of colors such as the standard monochromatic black, apple red, white, aspen blue, teal, and forest green.

Sonoma GT color breakdown:
* 1991 Black w/ Black (1 Total)
* Black w/ Black (406 Total)
* Black w/ Gray (30 Total)
* Frost White w/ Gray (107 Total)
* Apple Red w/ Gray (179 Total)
* Bright Teal w/ Gray (54 Total)
* Forest Green Metallic w/ Gray (15 Total)
* Aspen Blue w/ Gray (15 Total)

===1993 Sonoma===
Some 1992 and 1993 Sonomas came with a factory-equipped L35 W-code engine. For 1993, no specialty labeling or limited-edition tags were known to be used with the W-code engine. Production totals for these vehicles are unknown.

===1991 Syclone===

The Syclone was a high performance package for the 1991 model year. It came with all-wheel drive, 4-wheel anti-lock brakes, and a 4.3-litre &quot;LB4&quot; V6 producing 280 hp with lower compression pistons, a turbocharger, and a water intercooler system. Production was limited to just 2998 units.

===Engines===

==Second generation (1994)==


The second-generation trucks arrived for the 1994 model year. All of the special models (the Syclone, Typhoon, and Sonoma GT) were discontinued, but the changes to the pickup brought it in line with its major competitor, the Ford Ranger. The Iron Duke 4-cylinder and 2.8 L 60° V6 engines were discontinued, the 4.3 L Vortec V6 was enhanced, and a new 2.2 L 4-cylinder engine (which had been introduced in 1990 on various front-wheel-drive GM compact and mid-size platforms) became the engines of choice to power the second generation of S-10s. In compliance with the Clean Air Act, all second-generation S-10s and Sonomas equipped with air conditioning used CFC-free R134a refrigerant beginning with the 1994 model year. The all-new 1994 S-10 did not offer any airbag, presumably as a temporary measure to economize the introduction of the new body styles, as well as to gradually phase out steering wheel designs that did not accommodate for airbags, though the vehicle itself was slated for airbag capability.

Many of the chassis components were the same as the first generation (the control arms between the first and second generation were the same, originally sourced from GM&#x27;s G-body platform), along with the steering knuckle, leaf springs, and differential assembly but suspension and axles were greatly enhanced. Lower control arms for the two-wheel drive model had 1/4-inch thicker steering stops; the second-generation control arms are commonly used as an upgrade for the first generation. SUV models (Blazer, Jimmy, Bravada) came with thicker front and rear sway bars.

Generally, for the two-wheel-drive trucks, the 8.5-inch rear end was only used when it came with both a manual transmission and the L35 W-code V6 engine; it was an option for four-wheel-drive trucks with either transmission. This was also the year that GM introduced the ZR2 off-road package.

For 1995, a driver&#x27;s-side airbag was added as well as daytime running lights. In 1996, the 4.3 L engine was refreshed, and a third (rear) door was added for extended cab models, along with the bed option. In 1998, the exterior, interior, brakes, and 2.2 L I4 engine were refreshed, along with a &quot;next-generation&quot; supplemental restraint system that added a passenger-side air bag. The SS package was replaced by the &quot;Xtreme&quot; package. In 2001, a crew cab option was added and was only available with four-wheel drive and an automatic transmission. For the 2004 model year, the regular and extended cab models were discontinued; only the crew cab model was retained. Production ended in January 2004. 

Base two-wheel-drive models came with 15×6.5&quot; wheels with directional vents, and Xtreme and ZQ8 models came with 16×8&quot; wheels, while four-wheel-drive models (including the ZR2) used 15×7&quot; wheels. The wheels used on the first generation were discontinued.
===Electric versions===

Solectria Corporation offered the E-10, which was an electric vehicle conversion of the S-10 starting in 1993. U.S. Electricar also offered S-10 conversions starting in 1994. In 1997, General Motors introduced the Chevrolet S-10 EV, a battery-electric version of the S-10 pickup. The S-10 EV used the same front-wheel-drive powertrain as the GM EV1.

===1998 restyling===

For 1998, the Chevrolet S-10, GMC Sonoma, and Isuzu Hombre received a mid-cycle refresh. On the exterior, the front fascia was redesigned, and new wheel designs were added. The interior received a full redesign, with &quot;TheftLock&quot; anti-theft functionality for most radios, improved audio systems (including newly designed radios), new interior front door panels, an optional combination cassette and CD player radio, redesigned keyless entry remotes, a new steering wheel, dual airbags, a new instrument cluster with digital odometer and gear shift indicator for automatic transmission-equipped models, and new seat fabrics.

===Crew Cab (2001–2004)===

For the 2001 model year, a four-door Crew Cab configuration was introduced for the Chevrolet S-10 and GMC Sonoma (just three years before the full-size Silverado 1500 added it). Available exclusively in LS or SLS trims, the Crew Cab included many features that were optional on other S-10 models, such as four-wheel drive, full power accessories (windows, door locks, exterior side mirrors, and keyless entry), dual front bucket seats, fifteen-inch five-spoke aluminum-alloy wheels, an AM/FM stereo radio with TheftLock capabilities, a single-disc CD player, and Automatic Tone Control (ATC), a six-speaker audio system, a tachometer for the instrument cluster, and air conditioning. Leather-trimmed seating surfaces were also introduced for the Crew Cab for the first time.

==== ZR-5 Sport Package ====
Available exclusively on the Chevrolet S-10 and GMC Sonoma LS and SLS Crew Cab models, the ZR-5 Sport Package was a sport appearance package that added black front and rear bumpers, fifteen-inch (15&quot;) machined aluminum-alloy wheels, &quot;ZR-5&quot; pickup side box decals to the standard S-10 and Sonoma LS and SLS Crew Cab models.

===SS===
The Chevrolet S-10 SS was a high-performance version of the S-10, introduced in 1994. Fewer than 3,000 SS units were produced yearly on average. When introduced, the SS was only sold in three colors: Onyx Black, Summit White, and Apple Red. The SS was discontinued in 1998 and was replaced by the S-10 Xtreme for the 1999 model year.

A 4.3 L V6 (which was optional on regular S-10s) was the standard engine used in the SS, producing between 180 and . The SS included a limited-slip differential, lowered suspension (starting with the 1996 model year), cosmetic changes such as a different grille, body-colored bumpers, 16-inch wheels (available from 1996 to 1998, similar in design to the 1991 and 1992 Camaro Z28 with Chevrolet &quot;bowtie&quot; logo center caps), and other minor cosmetic differences. All SS versions were regular cabs, while Xtremes were available with the &quot;third door&quot; extended cab. A Stepside bed version was available from 1996 to 1998 and until 2003 on the Xtreme.

===ZR2===
The ZR2 package was an off-road package available for the second generation S-10. The ZR2 package included a wider track width, a boxed ladder-type frame with modified suspension mounting points, larger wheel and axle bearings, 31-inch all-terrain tires, a suspension lift (approximately three inches more ground clearance versus a regular four-wheel drive S-10), upgraded Bilstein suspension, fender flares, alloy wheels, and an 8.5-inch Chevrolet 10-bolt rear differential with 3.73:1 gears and an Eaton MLocker (coded as G80).

===Isuzu Hombre===

In 1996, Isuzu replaced its P&#x27;up with a version of the Louisiana-built Chevrolet S-10, the Isuzu Hombre, based on the Brazilian-market S-10 (the front grille and fenders are based on the Brazilian S-10 along with the truck bed sheetmetal). The Hombre differed from its GM siblings mostly in the front sheetmetal, with different lights, grille, front bumper, and front fenders, which were more flared out. The rear quarter panels were also different, as they had a slight flare over the wheel well to match the front fenders. The Hombre had a much smaller range of equipment options compared to the S-10 and Sonoma; a &quot;Spacecab&quot; extended cab, V6 engine, and four-wheel drive were added for 1997 and available until 1998.

Two trim levels were offered: the base S and the uplevel XS. The XS had features like a cassette tape deck, higher-grade interior fabric, a tachometer, sliding rear window, and a split 60/40 seatback. Hombres were equipped with the S-10&#x27;s 15×7&quot; steel wheels (with 8 directional vents); the Hombre wheels were painted black (the S-10, Sonoma, and Blazer/Jimmy wheels were painted silver) since a majority were equipped with wheel covers with the Isuzu logo. Hombres were also available with the S-10&#x27;s aluminum wheels with Isuzu center caps.

Slow sales resulted in production ending in 2000. It would be another six years before Isuzu re-entered the pick-up market with the i-Series, which formed the basis for the S-10&#x27;s successor, the Colorado.

===South America and China (1994–2012)===


===Engines===

==Third generation (2012)==
Although the North American version of the S-Series was discontinued in 2004, the second generation S-10 was still being built in Brazil until 2012, when it was replaced by a Brazilian-built version of the Chevrolet Colorado called the S-10.

In Brazil, until 2014, the third generation S-10 offered a 2.4 L 147 hp &quot;Flexpower&quot; flex-fuel engine or a 2.8 L 180 hp &quot;Duramax&quot; diesel engine. For 2015 models, the diesel engine was refreshed, resulting in an increased power output of 200 hp. The flex-fuel (gasoline/ethanol) engine had an upgrade for some versions (LT and LTZ) and offered 206 hp with a 2.5 L LCV Ecotec with direct fuel injection. Also, for the first time in Brazil, Chevrolet offered the flex-fuel S-10 with four-wheel drive.

For the 2017 model, the S-10 received a facelift and the flex-fuel 2.4 L engine was dropped, with the remaining engine choices being unchanged. For 2018, the flex-fuel S-10 offers an automatic transmission, currently the market trend on these vehicles in Brazil. Since 2021, the Holden S-10 received a facelift in Warren, but as Holden was closed in Australia, the tooling was transferred to Brazil. The Brazilian S-10 was facelifted for 2023, the same model year the North American Colorado was redesigned.

A right-hand-drive version of the 2017+ facelifted model was built at the GM Thailand plant and sold in Australia and New Zealand as Holden Colorado until 2020.

== S10 Max (2021) ==

In late 2021, General Motors introduced the S10 Max for the Mexican market and several other Latin American countries. Imported from China and produced by SAIC, it is a rebadged Maxus T70.

<text>Elmar Peter Brok (born 14 May 1946) is a German politician who was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1980 until 2019. He was the chairman of the European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs from 1999-2007 and from 2012-2017. He is a member of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany, which is part of the European People&#x27;s Party.

Brok held many leadership positions in German and European politics. As a member of the Convention on the Constitution for Europe and in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, he is widely credited with contributing crucially to the Constitution of the European Union. He is also a former President of the Union of European Federalists (UEF).

==Early life and education==
Brok studied law and politics in Germany and at the Centre for European Governmental Studies at the University of Edinburgh. Formerly, he worked as a radio journalist and newspaper correspondent.

==Political career==

===Positions in the European Parliament===
*Member of the European Peoples Party and European Democrats group (member of the board of directors)
*Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs (1999–2007, again 2012-2017)
*Substitute member of the Subcommittees on Security and Defence (SEDE) and Constitutional Affairs (AFCO)
*Co-Chair of the Transatlantic Legislators&#x27; Dialogue
*Member of the EP-Delegation for relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China
*Substitute Member of the delegation for the relations with the United States
*Substitute member of the EP-Delegation for relations with the NATO Parliamentary Assembly
*Chairman of the Board of Governors of the European Endowment for Democracy (EED)
* Member of the European Parliament Intergroup on Biodiversity, Countryside, Hunting and Recreational Fisheries (since 2014)

Brok has held several other leadership positions in the European Parliament, including Member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) Political Bureau, Member of the EPP Group Bureau, Coordinator in the European Parliament committees on social affairs, drugs and German unity, and the European Parliament Representative on the Council&#x27;s Reflection Group for Maastricht II.

From 2007 until 2017, Brok was the co-chair of the EPP Foreign Ministers Meeting, which gathers EPP foreign ministers ahead of meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council, serving alongside Franco Frattini (2007-2011), Radosław Sikorski (2011-2014) and Sebastian Kurz (2014-2017).

Brok was the European Parliament&#x27;s negotiator at several treaty negotiations including the EU-Treaties of Amsterdam (1996/1997), Nice (2000) and Lisbon (2007), the Convention on the Future of Europe (2001-2002), the European Stability Mechanism (2011-2012) and the International Treaty on Fiscal Stability (2011-2012). In November 2014, he and fellow MEP Mercedes Bresso were appointed by the constitutional affairs committee to explore the possibilities of the eurozone governance reform without any treaty change.

Besides his constitutional work, Brok is best known for his activities on the Committee on Foreign Affairs. He was chairman of the committee in 1997-2007, but ousted after a contest within the centre-right European People&#x27;s Party by Jacek Saryusz-Wolski, who was followed in 2009 by Gabriele Albertini; Brok returned to the position for the period from 2012 until 2017. He was the Parliament&#x27;s main rapporteur on enlargement and rapporteur for the EU&#x27;s enlargement strategy and the European External Action Service (along with Guy Verhofstadt). In 2010, he joined the &quot;Friends of the EEAS&quot;, an unofficial and independent pressure group formed because of concerns that the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy  Catherine Ashton was not paying sufficient attention to the Parliament and was sharing too little information on the formation of the European External Action Service. In a 2013 own-initiative report drawn up by Brok and fellow MEP Roberto Gualtieri, the European Parliament called for overhauling the EEAS and increasing parliamentary influence over the EU&#x27;s diplomatic service.

From 2017, Brok served on the Parliament&#x27;s so-called Brexit Steering Group, which works under the aegis of the Conference of Presidents and to coordinates Parliament&#x27;s deliberations, considerations and resolutions on the UK&#x27;s withdrawal from the EU.

Ahead of the 2019 European elections, CDU officials voted not to grant Brok spot on the party&#x27;s candidate list.

===Positions in the Christian Democratic Union===
Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl once sarcastically summarized Brok&#x27;s CV: &quot;born, married, MEP.&quot; Brok has held numerous leadership positions for the Christian Democratic Party in Germany, including Deputy Federal Chairman of the Junge Union (CDU youth section) (1973–1981), Chairman of the CDU Federal Committee on Foreign and Security Policy (1989–1999), CDU District Chairman of Ostwestfalen-Lippe (since 1996), Secretary of the CDU Land Executive of North Rhine-Westphalia (since 1996), Chairman of the CDU Federal Committee on European policy (since 1999), Assistant Chairman of the International Democrat Union (since 1991), Deputy Chairman of the European Union of Christian Democratic Workers (since 1991), and Chairman of the European Union of Christian Democratic Workers.

On 15 September 2010, Brok supported the new initiative Spinelli Group in the European Parliament, which was founded to reinvigorate the campaign for federalisation of the European Union (EU).

On 16 November 2013, he was elected president of the Union of European Federalists.

Following the 2013 German elections, Brok was part of the CDU/CSU team in the negotiations with the SPD on a coalition agreement.

==Political views==

===European integration===
Over the course of his political career, Brok has been an advocate of ever closer integration between Germany and the other countries of the European Union. Along with Greek MEP Dimitris Tsatsos, he was one of the European Parliament&#x27;s two official observers at the EU negotiations that culminated in the Treaty of Nice, a deal which he later harshly criticized.

Brok has been an early proponent of having the European Union abandon its old method of leaving constitutional negotiations to national leaders. In 2013, however, he opposed German plans to hold national referendums for major decisions on Europe; he argued that &quot;[i]f this was implemented in Germany, it would be seen abroad as putting an end to further development of the EU, the EU would become ineffective.&quot;

Brok is regarded a critic of an accession of Turkey to the European Union. In 2011, he expressed his skepticism of Turkey&#x27;s efforts to establish itself as a regional power within the Arab world; in his view, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is seeking to transform it into a regional power similar to the status it held &quot;earlier with the Ottoman Empire&quot; rather than pursuing the goal of EU membership.

In 2018, Brok voted against transnational voting lists for European elections.

===Relations with Russia===
Brok is an advocate of pursuing a &quot;two-track policy with Russia&quot;. In an interview with the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, he said: &quot;Europe and Germany together need a strategic partnership with Russia but in parallel to focusing on human rights, too.&quot; Following the assassination of journalist and human rights activist Anna Politkovskaya in 2006, Brok demanded that German Chancellor Angela Merkel speak openly about human rights with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Speaking on European investments made by the Russian sovereign wealth fund and Gazprom in 2008, he expressed uncertainty about the intentions of Russia: &quot;The Russians are just getting going and we don&#x27;t fully understand their motives [...] That is going to keep the political pressure to do something high.&quot;

In 2012, Brok was among the 48 signatories of an open letter to demand that the European Union implement its own version of the U.S. Magnitsky Act.

When Russian leaders, concerned about Ukraine setting course toward Europe, threatened to permanently tighten customs on Ukrainian goods should the country proceed with the agreement, Brok declared that “Russia has no right to act in the way it&#x27;s doing.” In 2013, he publicly blamed Russian pressure for Ukraine&#x27;s leadership not signing the Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement.

When the request of Lithuanian MEP Gabrielius Landsbergis to meet with Russian MPs and officials in Moscow was denied amid the Russo-Ukrainian War in early 2015, Brok complained that the case represents “a new level of non-co-operation.”

===Transatlantic relations===
Amid tensions between Germany and the United States over intelligence cooperation in 2015, Brok cited the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership as one project that could fail as a result of the frayed relations, calling the tensions “a further blow for all those who want closer relations with America.” Asked why Germans failed to spot American violations of a 2002 accord on sharing intelligence, he suggested that too many Germans working in the BND had “a blind loyalty” to their trans-Atlantic partners.

===On the United Kingdom===
Following British prime minister David Cameron&#x27;s decision to wield the UK veto against European Union treaty change, Brok said it was time to “marginalize Britain, so that the country comes to feel its loss of influence”.

===Armenian genocide===
Speaking during the parliamentary debate on a 2015 resolution commemorating the centennial of the Armenian genocide, Brok underlined what he called the moral obligation to recognize and commemorate such massacres: “My own people committed genocides,” he said. “Hundreds of thousands of Armenians died at the hands of the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s henchmen.”

===United Nations reform===
Brok is a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which advocates for democratic reformation of the United Nations, &quot;to allow for greater public participation in the activities of the UN.&quot;

==Controversies==

===Lobbying activities===
Between 2004 and May 2011, Brok was Senior Vice President for Media Development at Bertelsmann. According to information broadcast by German media his activities as lobbyist of Bertelsmann were also scrutinized by the EU Commission. According to journalist Lutz Mükke (2005) Brok used his influence to ban Hajo Friedrich, who published a critical article concerning Brok&#x27;s muddy activities, from the political ressort of the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;. In an interview with the German newspaper &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot;, Brok reflected his activities and stated that for him politics was not profession, but hobby. Accordingly, critics of Brok call him a &quot;hobbyist&quot;.

In 2011, members of the European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs voted unanimously against a request by German prosecutors to lift Brok&#x27;s immunity in a tax blunder. Italian MEP Francesco Speroni had been tasked to write the parliament&#x27;s view on the matter.

===Femen attack in Brussels===
On 21 March 2013 women&#x27;s rights activist and Femen-founder Alexandra Shevchenko assaulted Elmar Brok in front of the European Parliament in Brussels, after luring him outside the building with a phony interview request. Femen accused Brok of soliciting the services of Ukrainian prostitutes and insulting Ukrainian women. Although Femen never disclosed its source, instead mentioning &quot;reliable informations&quot;(sic), the Kyiv Post reported shortly after that circumstantial evidence points to First Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine Renat Kuzmin being involved. The European External Action Service denied all allegations against Brok, citing his intensive agenda during his visit.
After the assault, one Femen activist was able to flee the scene while Shevchenko was arrested by police officers. Brok did not press criminal charges against Shevchenko.

<doc id="865314" wikidata="Q1485939" url="?curid=865314" title="GMC Envoy">
<text>The GMC Envoy is a mid-size SUV manufactured and marketed by General Motors for the 1998 to 2009 model years over two generations. Adopting a nameplate used by GM Canada, the Envoy was phased in as a trim variant of the GMC Jimmy alongside the similar Chevrolet TrailBlazer.

The second generation of the GMC Envoy replaced the Jimmy outright, again sharing a common platform with the Trailblazer; General Motors also marketed the chassis architecture under various other nameplates, including the Oldsmobile Bravada, Buick Rainier, Isuzu Ascender, and Saab 9-7X.

General Motors assembled the model line at its Moraine Assembly (Moraine, Ohio) and Oklahoma City Assembly (Oklahoma City, Oklahoma). Both facilities were closed by 2008, leading to the discontinuation of the model line. The Envoy was not directly replaced in the GMC model line as General Motors transitioned its smaller SUVs to unibody-chassis designs, introducing the smaller GMC Terrain and larger GMC Acadia.

==First generation (1998–2000)==

The first generation GMC Envoy was introduced for the 1998 model year. Introduced a year before the Chevrolet TrailBlazer, the Envoy was the highest-trim version of the GMC Jimmy SUV. In line with the Oldsmobile Bravada, the Envoy was fitted with a leather-trim interior, floor-mounted shifter, and a largely monochromatic exterior with aluminum-alloy wheels. In line with the TrailBlazer and the Bravada, the Envoy trim was offered only in the five-door version.

The Envoy had many extra features not available on the regular Jimmy 4-door including: a remote trunk release, heated driver&#x27;s and passenger&#x27;s seats, a Bose sound system, and High Intensity Discharge headlights. Optional features included: a power sunroof, a panic alarm, an anti-theft system, and a power front driver &amp; passenger seat.

GMC ended sales of the first generation Envoy after the 2000 model year as the division adopted the name to replace the entire Jimmy SUV line for 2002.

===Safety features===
The 1998-2000 GMC Envoy had a four-wheel antilock braking system standard as well as standard front driver and passenger airbags. However, the Envoy received a Poor rating in the IIHS frontal offset crash test.

==Second generation (2002–2009)==
The second generation GMC Envoy was introduced in early 2001 as a 2002 model (skipping the 2001 model year). In line with the Chevrolet Trailblazer replacing the Chevrolet (S-10) Blazer, the 2002 Envoy replaced the GMC Jimmy five-door.

The Envoy was &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine&#x27;s Sport/Utility of the Year for 2002. The 4200 Vortec 4200 engine I6 engine was named one of &quot;Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines&quot; from 2002 to 2005.

=== Chassis ===
The second generation GMC Envoy uses the body-on-frame GMT360 chassis architecture. Ending its commonality with GM compact pickup trucks, the GMT360 chassis was designed from the ground up for SUV use. The frame rails are hydroformed and fully boxed for their entire length. The wheelbase grew to 113 inches (six inches longer than the first generation); for the first time, an extended-wheelbase version was introduced with a 129-inch wheelbase length (1 inch shorter than the GMC Yukon XL).

The front suspension used a double-wishbone independent configuration with Bilstein shock absorbers. The rear suspension featured a 5-link solid rear axle; load-leveling air suspension was an option for the rear axle.

The second-generation Envoy adopted four-wheel disc brakes as standard equipment.

==== Powertrain ====
For its 2002 debut, the GMT360 Envoy received an all-new standard engine, with a Vortec 4200 4.2L inline-6 replacing the previous 4.3L V6. The first inline-6 from GM in North America since 1984, the &quot;Atlas&quot; engine produced 270 hp (80 more than its V6 predecessor). Beginning in 2003, the Envoy XL could be equipped with an optional 290 hp 5.3L V8. For 2005, the 5.3L V8 was updated to include the Displacement on Demand variable-displacement system (using 4 of 8 cylinders during low-load situations), increasing output to 300 hp.

Alongside a standard rear-wheel drive layout, the GMT360 Envoy was offered with either permanent 2-wheel drive or a 4x4 &quot;Shift On-Demand&quot; system, offering 2-wheel drive, Automatic 4-wheel drive, and High-range and Low-range 4-wheel drive (the latter, in 2.69:1 reduction). Two rear axles were offered, a rear &quot;Posi-Trac&quot; limited-slip differential and an Eaton automatic rear locking differential.

===Trim===
Throughout its production run, the Envoy was available in three different trim levels:

The base SLE trim level was produced from 2002 to 2009, and included a plentiful amount of standard equipment, including full power equipment (power front seats, power door locks, power windows, and power mirrors), keyless entry, cloth seating surfaces, an A/M-F/M stereo with single-disc CD player (later, with satellite radio), a four-speaker audio system, OnStar, aluminum-alloy wheels, a full-size spare tire with black-painted steel spare wheel, a 65/35 split-folding rear bench seat, faux carbon fiber interior trim panels, a cruise control, a dual-zone, manual climate control system, the 4.2L Vortec Inline Six-Cylinder (I6) gasoline engine, and a four-speed automatic transmission. Optional features included an in-dash, six-disc CD changer, a Bose six-speaker premium amplified audio system, a rear DVD entertainment system by Panasonic, a security system, polished aluminum-alloy wheels, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces, dual heated front bucket seats, and a power moonroof.

The uplevel SLT trim level, available from 2002 to 2009, added extra luxury and convenience features to the base SLE trim, including a six-disc, in-dash CD changer, a Bose six-speaker premium amplified audio system, OnStar, polished aluminum-alloy wheels, luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces, dual heated front bucket seats, Driver Information Center, faux wood interior trim panels, a universal garage door opener system with a travel note recorder, a dual-zone, automatic climate control system, and a driver&#x27;s memory system for driver&#x27;s seat, mirrors, and radio preset settings. Optional features included an in-dash, touchscreen GPS navigation system (later models), a rear DVD entertainment system by Panasonic, and a power moonroof.

The top-of-the-line Denali trim level, available from 2005 to 2008, was the most luxurious trim level of the Envoy, adding additional luxury features to the also luxurious SLT trim. Additional features included additional faux wood interior trim accents, a two-tone, luxury leather-trimmed interior, a &#x27;Denali&#x27; emblem for the steering wheel, the 5.3L Vortec V8 gasoline engine, a power single-pane moonroof, unique chrome-plated aluminum-alloy wheels, satellite radio, and a chrome mesh front upper grille. Additional options included an in-dash, touchscreen GPS navigation system and a rear DVD entertainment system.

=== Body ===
Replacing the GMC Jimmy completely, the second-generation GMC Envoy was offered solely as a five-door SUV. Within the GMT360 model family, the Envoy shares its body most closely with the Isuzu Ascender; the two model lines differ primarily in their front bumpers, grille and side body moldings.

To accommodate third-row seating within the model line, an extended-length Envoy XL was introduced. Sixteen inches longer than the standard Envoy, the Envoy XL effectively bridged the gap in length between the full-size Yukon and Yukon XL SUVs. Distinguished by body-color C-pillars, the XL received its own rear door stampings. For 2004, GMC introduced the 5-passenger GMC Envoy XUV, combining the functionality of a pickup truck and an SUV. Derived from the Envoy XL, the XUV used a retractable rear roof and a folding &quot;mid-gate&quot; to create a plastic-lined reconfigurable cargo area.

=== Model history ===

==== 2003 ====
For 2003, to lower the price of the model line, GMC began to offer several options as stand-alone features (instead of grouping them together); front-seat side airbags were demoted to optional status. The headlight switch was revised, allowing an override of the Daytime Running Lamps (DRLs). The head restraints were revised from 4-way to 2-way movement.

A 290 hp 5.3L V8 was introduced as an option for standard-length Envoys and the Envoy XL; all versions received a 22-gallon fuel tank.

====2004====
The model year was largely carryover for the Envoy SUV. For the interior, adjustable pedals became an option, alongside XM Satellite Radio and an optional DVD-based navigation system. Derived from the Envoy XL, the Envoy XUV was a retractable-roof vehicle, combining the design capability of a SUV with a pickup truck.

====2005====

Following the discontinuation of the Oldsmobile Bravada, GMC expanded its Denali model range to the Envoy for 2005, including both versions of the model line. Along with its own grille design and chromed alloy wheels, the interior received standard leather trim, heated power seats, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and upgraded wood trim.

For all versions of the Envoy, GMC introduced revised seats; optional side airbags were replaced by full-length side curtain airbags (covering all three rows of seats in the Envoy XL). The DVD navigation system option was updated, adopting a touchscreen interface.

The 5.3L V8 was upgraded with a variable-displacement Displacement on Demand system, using four of eight cylinders in low-workload driving.

====2006====
For 2006, Stabilitrak stability control was made a standard feature alongside cruise control, OnStar, and a tire pressure monitoring system. The Envoy Denali received updated 18-inch alloy wheels.

Following low sales of the vehicle, the Envoy XUV was dropped from the model line for 2006.

====2007====
Following the discontinuation of the Envoy XL, all versions of the model line were now offered with five-passenger seating.

====2008====
For 2008, side-curtain airbags (introduced as an option in 2005) were made standard.

==== 2009 ====
For 2009, few functional changes were made, with Bluetooth wireless technology for wireless phones added as a new option.

Following the closure of Moraine Assembly, GMC ended sales of the model line after the 2009 model year, with its role in the GMC line largely succeeded by the GMC Terrain CUV/wagon. This marked the Envoy&#x27;s final year.

===Recall===
In 2012, General Motors had recalled more than 258,000 SUVs in the U.S. and Canada to fix short-circuits in power window and door lock switches that could cause fires. The recall covered Chevrolet TrailBlazer, GMC Envoy, Buick Rainier, Isuzu Ascender and Saab 9-7X SUVs from the 2006 and 2007 model years. The SUVs were sold or registered in 20 U.S. states, Washington, D.C., and Canada, where salt and other chemicals are used to clear roads in the winter.

=== Variants ===
====Envoy XL====

From 2002 to 2006, GMC offered the extended-wheelbase Envoy XL SUV. Sixteen inches longer in wheelbase and length than the standard-length Envoy, the longer body of the XL was designed for third-row seating. To improve access and rear-seat room, the roofline over the third-row seat was raised (shrouded slightly with a standard roof rack).

Extended to a 129-inch wheelbase, the Envoy XL was only one inch shorter than the full-size Yukon XL (Chevrolet Suburban) in wheelbase, conceding to its full-size counterparts in width. The Envoy XL (also produced as a Chevrolet TrailBlazer EXT and Isuzu Ascender) served as the basis of the GMC Envoy XUV (see below).

Following the closure of the Oklahoma City Assembly facility, the Envoy XL was dropped from the model line, with its 7-passenger midsize role largely replaced by the GMC Acadia CUV wagon (which also replaced the GMC Safari).

====Envoy XUV====

For 2004 and 2005, GMC offered the five-passenger Envoy XUV retractable-roof vehicle. Similar in concept to the 2001 GMC Terracross (a mid-size SUV concept), the Envoy XUV modernized the retractable roof concept of the 1960s Studebaker Wagonaire. To reconfigure the interior cargo space, the XUV was fitted with a &quot;midgate&quot; (similar to the Chevrolet Avalanche). Derived from the long-wheelbase chassis of the Envoy XL, the Envoy XUV design was exclusive to GMC.

Externally, the vehicle was distinguished by large chrome rails above the cargo area (housing the retractable rear roof) and variant-specific taillamps. In place of the liftgate, a two-way tailgate was used (side-hinged or bottom hinged) with a retractable rear window.

Selling far under sales projections, GM ended sales of the XUV before the end of the 2005 model year.

===== Cargo configuration =====
Marketed by its ability to combine the cargo-carrying aspects of both SUVs and pickup trucks, the Envoy XUV used the midgate to partition the passenger compartment from the rear cargo area (replacing the third-row seating of the XL). The cargo compartment was plastic-lined, allowing it to be hosed clean (with an onboard drainage system). To accommodate tall cargo, the rear roof panel could be retracted forward; to increase the size of the cargo compartment, the midgate and rear seats were folded down, creating a flat, plastic-lined floor (other bulky cargo could be transported by retracting the rear window or lowering the tailgate).

==Discontinuation==
The Envoy (along with the Chevrolet TrailBlazer, Buick Rainier, Isuzu Ascender, and Saab 9-7X) were discontinued by GM during the 2009 model year. On December 23, 2008, Moraine Assembly ended production, with a white GMC Envoy as its final vehicle. The closing of the last factory that manufactured the trucks was the subject of a 2009 HBO documentary: &quot;The Last Truck: Closing of a GM Plant&quot;.

While Chevrolet revived the TrailBlazer nameplate as both an SUV and as a compact CUV; neither vehicle has been produced with a GMC counterpart (the Envoy nameplate remains retired).

<text>Shifeng Bridge () is a cable-stayed bridge on Beijing&#x27;s western 5th Ring Road. It is near Wanping, near the Marco Polo Bridge.

Nearly 1.4 kilometres in length, it is a trademark bridge of the 5th Ring Road.

Under the bridge runs many railways to other parts of China.

The bridge is so named because it crosses from Shijingshan District into Fengtai District.

<text>Gustav Ernesaks (12 December 1908 – 24 January 1993) was an Estonian composer and a choir conductor.

==Biography==
Gustav Ernesaks was born on 12 December 1908 in Perila, Estonia. He was educated at the Estonian Academy of Music and Theatre where he was a pupil of Juhan Aavik and  Artur Kapp. After completing his education, he founded the first professional choir in the history of Estonia in 1944, the State Academic Men&#x27;s Choir (now the Estonian National Male Choir). 

Ernesaks played an integral role in the Singing Revolution and was one of the father figures of the Estonian Song Festival tradition. One of his songs, a setting of Lydia Koidula&#x27;s poem &quot;Mu isamaa on minu arm&quot;, became an unofficial national anthem during the years of Estonian SSR. His performance of the song at the XVII Estonian Song Festival was one of the inspirations for Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s 1970 a capella choral cycle, &quot;Loyalty&quot;. He dedicated the score to Ernesaks, who also premiered it in Tallinn. He also composed the Estonian SSR anthem used between 1945 and 1990.

In 1935, Ernesaks married Stella Merjam. They had three sons: Ott Ernesaks, Jüri Ernesaks and Peep Ernesaks. His wife died in 1973. Ernesaks died in Tallinn on 24 January 1993 aged 84. A statue of him was erected in 2004 on the Tallinn Song Festival Grounds.

<doc id="865328" wikidata="Q14711914" url="?curid=865328" title="Jay Peak Resort">
<text>Jay Peak Resort is an American ski resort located on Jay Peak in the northern Green Mountains, between Jay, Vermont and Montgomery Center, Vermont. Its vertical drop of is the eighth largest in New England and the fifth largest in Vermont. Although mostly located in the town of Jay, part of the resort, including the summit of Jay Peak, the Jet Triple Chair area, and much of the Big Jay backcountry descent, is located in the town of Westfield, Vermont, to the south. The northernmost part of the resort is just 4 miles (6.5 km) south of the border with Quebec, Canada.

The resort opened for skiing in 1957 and later expanded to year-round activities. The mountain offers 81 trails served by nine lifts. It receives the most snowfall of any ski area in the Northeastern U.S. and is known for its gladed skiing.

In 2008, Jay Peak Resort was purchased by a group of investors headed by Ariel Quiros and the resort&#x27;s CEO, Bill Stenger. They raised money from EB5 investors and undertook a major expansion of the resort&#x27;s facilities, adding, among other things, new hotels, condos, an ice rink and a water park. In 2016, Jay Peak and another Vermont mountain, Burke Mountain Ski Area, were seized by U.S. government officials amid investigations regarding fraudulent offerings of securities. Quiros and Stenger pleaded guilty and received prison sentences.

The resort was operated under US government receivership for more than six years, and in 2022 it was purchased by Pacific Group Resorts, Inc., with proceeds going to the defrauded EB5 investors.

==History==

===First half century===

Jay Peak was incorporated by Harold Haynes in 1955. That same year, the resort purchased its first ski lift, a T-bar, and in January 1957 it opened for skiing. Many ski trails were carved into the mountain during the 1950s by its first ski school director/general manager, Walter Foeger, an Austrian and former racer who had previously trained the Spanish Olympic ski team. In 1968 Weyerhaeuser invested $300,000 in the predecessor organization, Jay Peak, Inc., and loaned it $2.2 million. A 48-room hotel was built in the mid-1970s. In 1978 Mont Saint-Sauveur International, a Canadian firm, bought the resort.

In 2006, the resort employed 550 people in the winter, 100 in the summer. The following year, the resort agreed to pay the State of Vermont $105,000 for violating stormwater rules in polluting a stream while building a new golf course. Despite a drop in skier visits statewide during the 2006–2007 season, Jay Peak saw a record year with skier visits up 7%. In 2007–2008, the resort reported a record 320,000 skiers for the winter. In 2008, it was the second biggest employer in the area. In 2008, the resort was valued by the town of Jay at slightly over $12 million.

=== EB-5 fraud; water park, ice arena, hotel and other improvements ===
By 2008, the resort&#x27;s owner, Mount Saint-Sauveur, began an EB-5 visa program to finance development. That year, a group headed by Miami businessman Ariel Quiros and the resort&#x27;s CEO, Bill Stenger, purchased the resort. Before the purchase of Jay, Quiros claimed that he needed to verify the existence of the $18 million already raised by Mount Saint-Sauveur through the EB-5 program. He persuaded the sellers to put the funds into an account at Raymond James Financial, which employed his son-in-law, who helped to retitle the accounts in Quiros&#x27; name immediately before the closing of the sale of Jay. They transferred the funds to other accounts, misusing the EB-5 funds to pay part of the purchase price; they used more EB-5 funds raised later to complete the payments owed to Mount Saint-Sauveur.

The new resort company&#x27;s plan was to invest $100 million in capital improvements for the resort over the next few years. The resort company raised $250 million by 2010, for improvements at Jay and other nearby projects and purchases, including Burke Mountain Ski Area, from 250 investors from 43 companies through the incentive of the EB-5 program. Under this visa program, every $500,000 invested in the U.S. that results in ten new jobs gains the investor permanent U.S. residence. Separately from that program, but as part of its ongoing planning, the resort engaged in a three-way swap with the State of Vermont in 2010. The State deeded to the resort. The resort relinquished its lease to a parcel of nearby undeveloped forest back to the state and sold to the Green Mountain Club to ensure that the nearby of Long Trail would have a permanent buffer from ski-area development.

In 2010, $13 million worth of improvements at Jay were completed including an indoor ice arena, a parking garage, an enclosed beginners surface lift, and a new RFID ticketing system. The old Hotel Jay was razed and replaced with a new 170-room hotel. The new facilities also include a spa, conference center, movie theatre and water park. Also in 2010, &quot;Yankee&quot; magazine named Jay as the best ski resort in New England. In 2011, the resort agreed to pay an $80,000 fine to the United States Environmental Protection Agency for filling in of wetlands to construct a golf course in 2004–2006, without a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This was the same event for which the resort had paid a fine to the state in 2007. Over the ensuing years, the resort repeatedly postponed plans to expand its skiing terrain to a new area to be known as the West Bowl; it is not clear whether the resort ever obtained the support of the state to conduct the necessary cutting and construction in the forest.

By 2014, some EB-5 investors had complained to the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation (DFR) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the resort company had abruptly reclassified their investments. The investigators found the resort company&#x27;s answers to their questions about the use of the funds to be evasive. They eventually found that Quiros had diverted millions of the dollars raised for his personal use and that Stenger had lied to investors and the SEC about, among other things, the status of some of the construction projects, some of which were never built, including a biotechnology plant in Newport, Vermont.

On April 14, 2016, Jay Peak and Burke Mountain were seized by U.S. government officials. The resort remained operational under management of an SEC-designated receiver, Michael Goldberg, and acting CEO Steve Wright, who was previously Jay Peak&#x27;s marketing director. On January 15, 2019, Goldberg announced that the resort had been offered for sale. The SEC recovered $81 million from Quiros (including the ski area assets), who pleaded guilty in 2020 to federal crimes including wire fraud, money laundering and obstructing investigators. He was sentenced to five years in prison. Stenger cooperated with the investigation and pleaded guilty in 2021 to supplying false statements to federal investigators. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison (but served 10 months) and a further 3 years of home confinement, and he was fined $250,000. A third conspirator, William Kelly, also received fines and a prison sentence. Raymond James Financial paid a $150 million settlement for its part in the fraud.

===2022–present; purchase by Pacific Group Resorts===
As of 2022, Jay Peak employed more than 1,200 people in the winter and about half that number year-round; profits increased, during the receivership, from $2 million to $10 million annually.

In September 2022, after operating the resort for more than six years, Goldberg conducted an auction of the resort in which the winner was Pacific Group Resorts, Inc. of Park City, Utah, with a bid of $76 million. The sale was approved by the federal court, which ordered that approximately $70 million of the purchase funds were to be distributed to the defrauded EB-5 investors, representing about 40% of their original investments. The transaction was completed in November 2022. Pacific stated that it had no plans to make &quot;major changes&quot; to winter operations at the resort.

In February 2024, five Jay Peak Resort employees working in the water park under the J-1 visa program were fired by the resort after posting a photo of themselves on social media wearing home-made Swastika armbands and giving a Nazi salute.

==Trails and lifts==

As of 2024, the mountain offers 81 trails covering nearly of skiable terrain. About two dozen of these are off-piste tree-skiing areas, or glades, covering approximately . Jay Peak is home to the &quot;Face Chutes,&quot; arguably the most challenging and steepest marked terrain in the east with an average slope of 56.5 percent (almost 30°) and a maximum slope of 73.9 percent (37°). The &quot;Face Chutes&quot; consist of four skiable lines, the most challenging being the 3 lines to skier&#x27;s right, all of which are extremely narrow and include a mandatory cliff drop. The ski area is known for its gladed skiing.

Jay Peak has a lift fleet consisting of an aerial tram, six chairlifts and two magic carpet surface lifts. It is one of two ski resorts on the east coast that has and aerial tram, the other being Cannon Mountain in New Hampshire.

The mountain has a total uphill capacity of approximately 12,820 skiers/hour. The oldest of the lifts, the 60-person aerial tramway, also known as the &quot;tram&quot;, is the only one of its type in the State of Vermont. This tramway was originally installed in 1966 by Von Roll and upgraded in 2000 with new cabins from Garaventa.

In 1985, the resort purchased the Jet Triple chair from Doppelmayr to replace a T-Bar. This was followed in 1987 with the purchase of the Bonaventure Quad which replaced a double chairlift. In 1999 the resort removed the Green Mountain Double chair, which had serviced the north side of the mountain for 30 years, and replaced it with the Green Mountain Flyer (dubbed the &quot;Green Mountain Freezer&quot; by skiers because of its notoriously cold ride due to the strong winds blowing on it), the mountain&#x27;s first high-speed detachable chairlift. The other five lifts serve the lower mountain terrain. 

In May 2016 the state raised concerns over the safety of the aerial tramway, which resulted in $4.5 million worth of electronic upgrades and carriage overhauls. The capacity of the two tram cars was reduced from 60 to 45 at this time.

To gain access to the lifts, an RFID system scans a chip embedded in a plastic card which is typically held in the skier&#x27;s pocket.

==Snowfall==
The summit is at an elevation of 3,862 feet (1,177 m), with a 2,153 foot (656 m) vertical drop. Jay Peak has the largest average annual snowfall of any ski area in Eastern North America. The resort states its annual snowfall at 359 inches (9.1 metres), while the &quot;Zrankings&quot; ski resort data site calculates it at 322 inches, excluding October and May snow, writing: &quot;Jay Peak&#x27;s location near the northern tip of the Green Mountains and its proximity to large bodies of water means it often catches moist air. As this moist air is forced upwards by the mountain&#x27;s topography, it cools and condenses, leading to snowfall, a process known as orographic lift.

==Other facilities==
The resort has two base lodges and a small lodge at the summit where the aerial tram terminates. There are also hotel facilities and a large number of ski-in/ski-out condominium units on the lower part of the mountain.

Features at Jay include a league-sized hockey rink, the Ice Haus, with room for 700 spectators. Next to it is a 220 space parking garage, where 80% of the slots are covered. In 2011, an indoor water park named The Pump House opened. It features the longest &quot;lazy river&quot; in Vermont. The resort also has a cross-country ski center, a recreation center with climbing walls and a movie theatre, athletic fields, and an 18-hole golf course.

<text>The Reality Dysfunction is a science fiction novel by British writer Peter F. Hamilton, the first book in The Night&#x27;s Dawn Trilogy. It is followed by &quot;The Neutronium Alchemist&quot; and &quot;The Naked God&quot;. It was first published in the United Kingdom by Macmillan Publishers on 26 January 1996. The first US edition, which was broken into two volumes, &quot;Emergence&quot; and &quot;Expansion&quot; (the UK paperback is not), followed in July and August 1997 from Time Warner Books. The second US edition, published by Orbit Books in October 2008, is published in a single volume.

In some countries, the paperback editions were split into two (Germany and the United States), three (France) or four volumes (Italy and Portugal) per book. Usually the first volume is a translation of &quot;Emergence&quot;.

==Background==

The novel is set in the 26th and 27th centuries. The opening chapters cover a period of some thirty years, with the bulk of the story set in the years 2610 and 2611 AD.

A timeline in the appendix briskly covers the future history of the human race, from the settling of the Moon and the opening up of space to commercial exploitation to the founding of the Confederation. Humanity is split into two strands, the &quot;Adamists&quot; and the &quot;Edenists&quot;.

The Edenists possess the affinity gene, which allows telepathic communication between one another and the construction and use of bio-technological (or &#x27;bitek&#x27;) constructs, including sentient, living starships (voidhawks) and enormous space habitats. The Edenists inhabit sentient habitats orbiting gas giants, which they mine for helium-3, and they have a much greater standard of living than their Adamist counterparts.

The Adamists, divided into numerous nation-states, are &#x27;classic&#x27; humans who employ mechanical and cybernetic technology and use implants to achieve their ends. The Adamists mostly reject bitek for religious and cultural reasons, but it is later revealed that certain individuals working within Earth&#x27;s government have discouraged the use of bitek for fear of losing their ability to influence the development of mankind. Some Adamists still use bitek, such as &#x27;blackhawks&#x27;, advanced living spacecraft similar to Edenist voidhawks, with enhanced combat capabilities.

Despite their cultural, ideological and religious differences, the Edenists and Adamists generally work together in a forum known as the Confederation, which seeks to regulate interstellar trade, prevent war and repress the use and spread of antimatter, the most feared weapon of mass destruction at the time of the novels.

Humanity has only encountered three extraterrestrial races: the Jiciro, a race in the stages of an Industrial Revolution that the Confederation is observing discreetly; the Tyrathca, an insectoid species fleeing the destruction of their home world through a nova; and the Kiint, an incredibly advanced, ancient species who adopt a slightly condescending policy of non-interference in human affairs, but occasionally help with scientific research in areas of mutual interest. The Kiint only occupy one planet and do not possess starships, claiming to have passed beyond the need for economics and now exist purely to learn more about the universe. The Confederation has also found the ruins of a race known as the Laymil who, for reasons unknown, committed racial suicide some two thousand years prior to the start of the novels.

==Plot summary==

&quot;The Reality Dysfunction&quot; opens in the year 2581 with a war raging between two worlds, Omuta and Garissa, over three hundred and eighty seven mineral-rich asteroids known as the Dorados. The war escalates in a matter of months and it is rumoured that Garissa has developed an ultimate weapon of mass destruction known only as &#x27;The Alchemist&#x27;. The Alchemist deployment mission, on the starship &quot;Beezling&quot; and its two escorts, is intercepted by blackhawk mercenaries. Two of the ships survive, although they are crippled and stranded far from the nearest system. Dr. Alkad Mzu, creator of the Alchemist, survives the attack. Shortly after, the Omutans drop fifteen antimatter planet-busters on Garissa, rendering the planet uninhabitable and killing the majority of the ninety-five million inhabitants. The Confederation imposes a 30-year blockade around Omuta, and executes its government.

Many millions of years earlier, the extremely rare conditions on a moon orbiting a gas giant in a remote galaxy allow for the creation of a lifeform able to &#x27;transcend&#x27; to a purely energy-based (later known as energistic) state, the &quot;Ly-Cilph&quot;. The Ly-cilph become explorers of the universe, determined to know all that can be known about space and time. Over the course of aeons, they explore the universe and, presently, one arrives in the Milky Way galaxy.

An Edenist voidhawk named &quot;Iasius&quot; returns home to Saturn to die. As is traditional, a mating flight is called, with many voidhawks and even a blackhawk, &quot;Udat&quot;, joining &quot;Iasius&quot; on its final voyage into Saturn&#x27;s atmosphere. As it descends, the other ships energise its bitek eggs, which are taken to nest in Saturn&#x27;s rings. After several months, when the eggs are large enough, the infant children of &quot;Iasius&quot;&#x27; captain, Athene, are placed within them, so ship and captain experience infancy together, forming an unbreakable bond of love. The ship that grows from the egg energised by &quot;Udat&quot;, &quot;Oenone&quot;, becomes the most notable of the new brood of voidhawks, and its captain, Syrinx, the most wilful. As with many Edenists, Syrinx and &quot;Oenone&quot; volunteer to serve a tour of duty with the Confederation Navy, but the destruction of their fellow ship &quot;Graeae&quot; (commanded by Syrinx&#x27;s brother, Thetis) by an Adamist starship (called the &quot;Dymasio&quot;) using antimatter causes Syrinx to take a dim view of Adamists in general from that point on. She finishes her service with the Navy and then goes into cargo shipping.

A group of colonists arrive on the frontier world of Lalonde from Earth. Grossly overpopulated, with tens, sometimes hundreds of millions of people crammed into domed cities called arcologies, many people on Earth dream of escaping to virgin worlds with open skies above their heads. However, Lalonde is a typical stage-one colony world, dirty and corrupt with a ridiculously low level of technology. The latest colonists, mostly from Earth&#x27;s European arcologies, vow to create a peaceful, safe society. They are taken by steamboat up the mighty Juliffe River to found their new township, which they name Aberdale. Among the colonists are the Skibbow family, whose patriarch, Gerald, is excited about the prospect of living as a farmer. His teenage daughter, Marie, is less impressed and vows to escape back to Earth at the first opportunity. Also among the colonists are Father Horst Elwes, a Christian priest, and a large number of &#x27;Ivets&#x27; (Involuntary Transportees), petty criminals from Earth sentenced to work on the colony worlds to repay their debt to society. Unbeknown to the authorities, one of the Ivets, Quinn Dexter, is a member of the Light Brother sect (devil worshippers) and is armed with highly advanced information implants which have escaped detection. Dexter soon exerts his command over all the other Ivets through the use of satanic rituals, whilst simultaneously ingratiating himself with the colonists. His act does not fool Powel Manani, the town&#x27;s assigned settlement supervisor. Around this time the Ly-cilph arrives on Lalonde and studies Aberdale. Its curiosity is piqued when Father Elwes manages to see it, since few species are capable of perceiving it.

Joshua Calvert is a resident of Tranquillity, an independent bitek habitat (one of only five such habitats) orbiting the gas giant Mirchusko. Tranquillity was founded to study the Ruin Ring, the remains of some forty thousand alien habitats which apparently self-destructed two thousand years ago. It was created by the strictly Christian Kulu Kingdom, but when its founder Prince Michael Saldana chose to also accept affinity gene implants and have them inherited by his children, Tranquillity was excommunicated by the Kingdom and its leaders disinherited. Since then it has flourished as a tax haven, a trustworthy base for blackhawk mating flights, and an exclusive business locale in its area of the Confederation. Calvert has inherited a trader starship, the &quot;Lady MacBeth&quot;, from his late father, but the ship was heavily damaged in an unknown incident (Calvert makes up several stories during the course of the novel to explain this incident, all false; the incident is later explained in the short story &#x27;Escape Route&#x27; in the short story collection &quot;A Second Chance at Eden&quot;) and is no longer operational. Calvert dreams of making a big find in the Ruin Ring to finance repairs. Much to his surprise, Calvert indeed strikes lucky, finding a virtually intact memory core with the first-ever images of the reason for the Laymil racial suicide. However, decoding the information will take some time. Calvert sells his find for nearly seven million six hundred thousand fuseodollars, fixes up the &quot;Lady MacBeth&quot; and begins his life as a trader captain. He also starts a relationship with Ione Saldana, the current ruler of Tranquillity.

Also on Tranquillity is Dr. Alkad Mzu, who has been imprisoned on the habitat for nearly thirty years. How she escaped the situation at the start of the novel is not explained. Mzu is kept under the watchful eye of half a dozen major Confederation intelligence agencies to ensure that her knowledge of the Alchemist is not revealed to anyone else. From time to time, Mzu asks ship captains for passage off the habitat, knowing that such requests will be vetoed by Ione Saldana. She asks both Calvert and Meyer, the captain of the &quot;Udat&quot;, for aid but both times they refuse to help after Saldana intervenes.

On Lalonde Dexter encounters a group of people hiding in the jungle, led by the authoritative Laton. Laton is a &#x27;Serpent&#x27;, an Edenist who has rejected his society and, for lack of a better term, &#x27;gone bad&#x27;. More than thirty-five years ago Laton tried to stage a coup to seize control of a habitat called Jantrit, using a proteinic virus to threaten it with destruction. In the resulting chaos the habitat was destroyed (the only Edenist habitat ever lost) with more than a million deaths. The Confederation Navy believed it had killed Laton, but Laton had evaded capture and fled into obscurity in the wilds of Lalonde. Laton, impressed with Dexter&#x27;s resourcefulness (but disgusted by his religion), offers him a place in his organisation, whose goal is the discovery of true immortality. Dexter pretends to agree, knowing refusal will mean death. Realising that Dexter is faking his interest, Laton arranges for the villagers to discover that the Ivets are satanists. In the resulting chaos most of Dexter&#x27;s followers are killed. The remaining few take Powel Manani prisoner and sacrifice him in a grisly ceremony. At this moment, the observing Ly-cilph detects a strange energy current streaming from Manani through a quantum fracture in the space-time continuum. The Ly-cilph attempts to investigate by following the energy current, only to find it flooding into an energistic vacuum. Unable to extricate itself, the Ly-cilph goes into hibernation whilst still halfway between the two dimensions. This allows the strange energy forms in the dimension beyond to cross back into our universe.

The result is utter mayhem. Several of the strange entities seize control of Dexter and his followers, in effect &#x27;possessing&#x27; them. Able to call upon powers from the other realm, such as the ability to control and alter matter and hurl powerful white fireballs around, they then seize control of Aberdale and Laton&#x27;s compound, forcing the inhabitants to accept possession or death. Father Elwes escapes onto the savannah with most of Aberdale&#x27;s children, but not before one of the possessed reveals a terrible secret: the possessing entities are the souls of humans who have died and been trapped, some of them for millennia, in an absolute void where the only way to pass the time is to parasitically feed on the memories and experiences of others. And there are billions of them in the darkness still screaming for escape.

At the moment Laton is possessed, he manages to generate a tremendously powerful affinity SOS. This reaches the only two Edenists on the planet, a pair of agents from the Edenist Intelligence agency. They travel upriver to investigate, but are neutralised by the possessed. They manage to alert Ralph Hiltch (the Kulu External Security Agency&#x27;s Lalonde head of station) and Kelven Solanki (from Confederation Navy Intelligence) to the threat, although not its nature. With the subversion spreading across the planet, the governor authorises the recruitment of mercenaries to put down what he perceives as an &#x27;Ivet uprising&#x27;. Unbeknown to the governor, several possessed have already infiltrated the capital, Durringham, and taken passage on ships bound for other worlds.

One of these ships is the &quot;Lady MacBeth&quot;. Calvert has hit on the idea of transporting Lalonde&#x27;s legendarily tough wood (called Mayope) to the pastoral planet of Norfolk, which has banned all high technology. The idea sounds crazy, but it gets around Norfolk&#x27;s ban on high-tech items and gives Calvert access to the planet&#x27;s lucrative market in &#x27;Norfolk Tears&#x27;, the most desired alcoholic beverage in the galaxy. Calvert also begins a relationship with Louise Kavanagh, the young and naive daughter of Joshua&#x27;s business partner, Grant. Although Calvert treats the relationship as a bit of fun, Louise falls in love with Joshua and, due to her planet&#x27;s lack of chemical contraceptive, falls pregnant shortly after he leaves. Unfortunately for Norfolk, Calvert&#x27;s passenger on the flight from Lalonde was a man called Quinn Dexter.

Syrinx and &quot;Oenone&quot; arrive at Atlantis, the only planet colonised by Edenists (and unsurprisingly, entirely covered in a vast planet-ranging ocean), to purchase seafood to transport to Norfolk to trade for their Tears. During the stay at Pernik Island, Syrinx develops a relationship with an Edenist by the name of Mosul, the son of the family patriarch and guardian of the family fishing business. Mosul and Syrinx develop a contract which includes Syrinx&#x27;s return to distribute ten percent of Syrinx&#x27;s stock to the inhabitants of Pernik Island. However, the possessed have infiltrated Atlantis, led by the possessed Laton. They have taken control of Pernik Island and plan to possess Syrinx in the hope of possessing &quot;Oenone&quot; as well. Syrinx is captured and tortured as a prelude to possession. The plot backfires when Laton, having taken the time to study his possessing soul, manages to gain access to Pernik Island. He saves Syrinx, allows the crew of &quot;Oenone&quot; to rescue her (and gives them a message to take to Jupiter), and then causes the island to self-destruct, killing all of the possessed on it.

Laton&#x27;s departure from Lalonde was observed by a reporter. Within days half the Confederation knows that the most infamous Serpent of them all has returned, and a Confederation-wide quarantine to prevent the spread of Laton and his proteanic virus is enacted.

On Tranquillity data from the Laymil information stack reveals that their homeworld in the Mirchusko system (which does not seem to exist any more) was taken over by a &#x27;reality dysfunction&#x27;, triggered by the &#x27;Galheith research death essence tragedy&#x27;. The data shows the Laymil homeworld being overrun by a red cloud of unknown origin.

On Lalonde the possessed close to within a few hundred kilometres of Durringham. As they advance, a strange red cloud starts forming above centres of possessed activity. Ralph Hiltch and Kelven Solanki evacuate their respective personnel from the planet. Hiltch&#x27;s team manage to capture a possessed before they leave (this possessed is controlling the body of Gerald Skibbow of Aberdale) Solanki&#x27;s report reaches the Confederation Navy, which swiftly organises a fleet to quarantine Lalonde.

On Norfolk Quinn Dexter manages to reassert control of his body, by feeding his possessor images of his depraved activities as a satanist to the point where the possessor starts behaving like Dexter and then retreats into a catatonic state. Enhanced with his ex-possessor&#x27;s energistic power, Dexter swiftly organises the possessed and they rapidly start taking over the planet.

Several more possessed reach the independent bitek habitat Valisk in the Srinagar system and begin possessing several inhabitants as a prelude to taking over the entire habitat. They are led by Kiera, who has possessed the body of Marie Skibbow from Aberdale. Dariat, one of the children of Rubra, the eccentric genius who founded Valisk and then transferred his personality into it upon his death, becomes aware of their activities and volunteers to help them, so he can revenge himself upon the manipulative Rubra. His knowledge of the habitat&#x27;s surveillance techniques and how to evade them proves invaluable to the possessed. They kill him, and then guide his soul into a new body to give him the same powers they possess.

The Kulu embassy staff reach Ombey, the nearest Kulu colony world to Lalonde. However, when they bring their possessed prisoner out of zero-tau (a form of suspension which reduces energy movements to zero, effectively freezing time), they find the possessing spirit has fled, leaving the traumatised, broken form of Gerald Skibbow within. Princess Kirsten Saldana, the Saldana family member responsible for Ombey, is rapidly forced to declare a state of emergency when it is revealed that three personnel from the embassy staff were possessed and have begun spreading across the planet. Ralph Hiltch is brought in to advise.

The &quot;Lady MacBeth&quot; reaches Tranquillity at the same time that representatives of the Lalonde government are forming a mercenary fleet and army to save the planet. Keen to protect his investment, Calvert volunteers to accompany the fleet. They reach Lalonde (of which a sizable portion is covered by a strange red cloud) and begin landing mercenaries on the surface, but many of the landing teams are rapidly possessed and return to the orbiting ships. A full-scale space battle erupts when the Confederation Navy squadron arrives to blockade the planet and the possessed ships start firing on them. The mercenary team from the &quot;Lady MacBeth&quot; evades possession and manage to take a prisoner whose possessor is called Shaun Wallace, who tells them that the red cloud will hide Lalonde from the universe. He reveals that the possessed can hear the cries for help from the possessed still in &#x27;the beyond&#x27; and they desperately need to escape them. Once the cloud encircles Lalonde completely, the combined will of the possessed can physically move the planet onto another plane of existence where the cries of the possessed will not reach them.

The mercenary team evacuates to a nearby settlement belonging to the alien Tyrathca. The xenocs are extremely agitated by the human&#x27;s newly revealed ability to become &#x27;elemental&#x27; as they call it. They have built a statue to their &#x27;Sleeping God&#x27;, which &#x27;sees the universe&#x27; and they believe will save them. A reporter accompanying the mission, Kelly Tirrel, takes images of the statue and notes that there is no record of the Tyrathca having a god due to their highly unimaginative nature. They move on and discover Father Elwes and the children from Aberdale in hiding on the savannah. They manage to arrange a pick-up from the &quot;Lady MacBeth&quot;. The mercenary team sacrifices itself against an attack by possessed masquerading as the stereotypical knights in shining armour in order to give the children, Elwes and Kelly, time to evacuate.

A message hidden in the request for aid given by Alkad Mzu to Captain Meyer of the &quot;Udat&quot; is revealed, offering him a vast sum of money for his help in aiding her escape. Meyer agrees and has &quot;Udat&quot; make a wormhole jump into the &quot;interior&quot; of Tranquillity. Mzu arranges to be in place for a pick-up, but underestimates the ability and sheer power of Tranquillity to enforce its will through affinity. &quot;Udat&quot; is compelled to jump back out with Mzu perilously hanging onto a rope ladder trailing from the blackhawk.

The story continues in &quot;The Neutronium Alchemist.&quot;

==Reception==
Cliff Ramshaw reviewed &quot;The Reality Dysfunction&quot; for &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine, rating it an 8 out of 10 overall. Ramshaw comments that &quot;Hamilton&#x27;s wide scope and weak characters mean that the initial stages of the novel flounder. It isn&#x27;t until after page 200 or so that the plot begins to take shape; after page 300 things are motoring along at a more than acceptable rate. Towards the end the epic scale really pays off: the tension mounts and mounts as a wide array of human forces, hampered by ignorance and communication failures, attempts to halt an invasion on a colony world seemingly without strategic value.&quot;

<doc id="865332" wikidata="Q1658038" url="?curid=865332" title="Ikaho, Gunma">
<text>was a town located in Kitagunma District, Gunma Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 3,920 and a density of 175.63 persons per km2. The total area was 22.32 km2.

On February 20, 2006, Ikaho, along with the villages of Komochi and Onogami (all in Kitagunma District), and the villages of Akagi and Kitatachibana (both in Seta District), was merged into the expanded city of Shibukawa.

Situated on the slopes of Mount Haruna, an extinct volcano, Ikaho is well known for its hot springs.

Ikaho is 2.5 hours from Shinjuku by express bus, and can be easily enjoyed on a day trip from Tokyo

== Onsen (Hot springs) ==
Ikaho Onsen is one of Gunma&#x27;s 4 large onsen. This makes it one of the main onsen locations in Japan. 

The onsen locations are usually open during weekdays, from 09:00 AM to 06:00 PM

Ikaho Onsen has been called Kogane-no-Yu (The Golden Waters), but the waters used to be clear and colorless. However, due to the iron content, they turned dark brown when in contact with the air. They are also known as Kodakara-no-Yu (Child Waters) since they tend to be mild, warm the body from inside and are popular with women.

==History==

* 1889 - Ikaho town is created in Nishigunma District by the uniting of the villages of Ikaho, Mizusawa, and Yunakako.
* 1896 - Nishigunma District merges with Kataoka District and is renamed Gunma District.
* 1949 - Kitagunma District, including Ikaho town, separates from Gunma District.
* 1997 - Hilo, Hawaii becomes a sister city.
* February 20, 2006 - Ikaho, along with the villages of Komochi and Onogami (all from Kitagunma District), and the villages of Akagi and Kitatachibana (both from Seta District), was merged into the expanded city of Shibukawa.

==Notable places==
* Mount Haruna

<text>The South Shore of Massachusetts is a geographic region stretching south and east from Boston toward Cape Cod along the shores of Massachusetts Bay and Cape Cod Bay. It is subject to varying descriptions including municipalities in eastern Norfolk and Plymouth counties. The South Shore is an affluent area. The median income of the region as of 2020 is $104,691. The median home value of the region as of 2020 is $574,831.

Depending on its geographical definition, the South Shore is composed of a mix of suburban towns, mid-sized industrial cities and rural towns. Massachusetts&#x27; heaviest concentration of Irish-American residents and descendants from ancestors from Ireland is on the South Shore, and 6 of the United States&#x27; 10 most Irish towns are located on the South Shore, which is sometimes referred to locally as the [[Irish Riviera]].

==Geography==
By its most literal definition, the South Shore includes only cities and towns between Boston and Cape Cod that physically border the Atlantic Ocean, thereby limiting the South Shore to the following:

The Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management limits its definition of the South Shore to the municipalities between Boston Harbor and Cape Cod, which includes Atlantic coastal and coastal watershed areas &quot;from the three-mile (5 km) limit of the state territorial sea to beyond the first major land transportation route encountered (a road, highway, rail line, etc.)&quot;. This definition eliminates Braintree, Quincy and Weymouth, which border Boston Harbor, but adds the towns of Hanover, Norwell and Pembroke.

With respect to regional planning and cooperation among municipal governments, some of these coastal communities are either members of the Boston-centered Inner Core Committee of the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) or not part of the metropolitan area at all, while the South Shore Coalition of the MAPC comprises representatives from 13 coastal and inland communities and includes the following cities and towns:

The South Shore Chamber of Commerce includes all of the above towns, as well as several more farther inland in Norfolk and Plymouth counties, in its definition of the region:

Informal definitions of South Shore—defined by the service areas of other nonprofits or businesses with &quot;South Shore&quot; in their names, by real estate agents, or by individuals, for example—always include at least some of the shoreline communities but can stretch considerably to the west. Readers of &quot;Boston&quot; magazine, in 2016, identified &quot;Anything below the city, Cape included&quot; as one potential definition of &quot;South Shore&quot;. Suggested western boundaries included the Rhode Island state line, or Massachusetts Route 24. Some individuals placed Foxborough and Stoughton in the region. One definition included all of Cape Cod, as far as Provincetown; others said the South Shore ends at the Sagamore Bridge, which would place part of Bourne in the region.

==Education==
Institutions of higher learning located in South Shore communities include:

*Curry College, a private four-year liberal arts college with the main campus located in Milton, and a satellite campus located in Plymouth
*Bridgewater State University, a public four-year liberal arts college in Bridgewater, and the largest public university in the Massachusetts State University system outside of the University of Massachusetts system
*Eastern Nazarene College, a private college of the liberal arts and sciences in Quincy
*Massasoit Community College, a public two-year community college with campuses in Brockton and Canton
*Quincy College, a two-year city-operated community college in Quincy

<doc id="865334" wikidata="Q1203698" url="?curid=865334" title="Shintō, Gunma">
<text>is a village located in Gunma Prefecture, Japan. , the village had an estimated population of 15,653 in 5,942 households, and a population density of 520 persons per km². The total area of the village is .

==Geography==
Located in central Gunma, Shintō sits between the slopes of Mount Haruna and the Tone River region.

===Surrounding municipalities===
Gunma Prefecture
* Maebashi
* Shibukawa
* Takasaki
* Yoshioka

===Climate===
Shintō has a Humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cold winters with heavy snowfall. The average annual temperature in Shintō is 12.1 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1282 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 24.8 °C, and lowest in January, at around 0.4 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Shintō has recently plateaued after a long period of growth.

==History==
The area of present-day Shintō contains numerous &quot;kofun&quot; burial mounds from the 6th century. On April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system after the Meiji Restoration, Momonoi village was established within Nishigunma District, Gunma. In 1896, Nishigunma District was united with Kataoka District to create Gunma District, which was subsequently divided in 1949 with Momonoi village becoming part of Kitagunma District. The village was the scene of the Girard incident in 1957, in which an American soldier stationed at Shintō shot and killed a Japanese civilian, sparking a jurisdictional dispute between the Japanese and American governments. In 1957, a portion of Sōma village was merged with Momonoi village. Momonoi was renamed Shintō on August 1, 1959.

==Economy==
Traditionally, the economy of Shintō was heavily dependent on agriculture; however, the area has developed into a bedroom community for neighboring Takasaki and Maebashi. The village also hosts JGSDF Camp Soumagahara, home of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force JGSDF 12th Brigade.

==Government==
Shintō has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral village council of 14 members. Shintō and neighboring Yoshioka contribute one member to the Gunma Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the village is part of Gunma 5th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Education==
Shintō has two public elementary schools and one public middle school operated by the town government. The village does not have a high school.

<doc id="865335" wikidata="Q61485" url="?curid=865335" title="Johann Konrad Dippel">
<text>Johann Konrad Dippel, also spelled Johann Conrad Dippel (10 August 1673 – 25 April 1734), was a German Pietist theologian, physician, and alchemist.

== Life ==
Dippel was born at Castle Frankenstein near Mühltal and Darmstadt, thus, when he entered school, the addendum &quot;Franckensteinensis&quot; was attached to his name, and once at university, the addendum &quot;Franckensteina-Strataemontanus&quot; was used.

He studied theology, philosophy and alchemy at the University of Giessen, obtaining a master&#x27;s degree in theology in 1693. He published many theological works under the name Christianus Demócritus, and most of them are still preserved. Around 1700, he turned to Hermetic studies and alchemy as a key to nature. Between 1700 and 1702, he engaged in a bitter dispute with the Reformed Court Preacher Conrad Broeske in Offenbach, with whom he shared millenarian hopes for soon-coming renewal in Christendom. He accused Broeske of compromise and collusion with the authorities after Broeske refused to publish Dippel&#x27;s &quot;The Scourging Papacy of the Protestants&quot; on the Offenbach press.

Dippel&#x27;s reputation as a controversial theologian earned him both defenders and enemies throughout all of Europe. Emanuel Swedenborg was probably both his most notable supporter and, later, staunch critic: Swedenborg began as a disciple of Dippel, but eventually dismissed him as a &quot;most vile devil ... who attempted wicked things.&quot; Swedenborg clarified that he was at first enamored by Dippel&#x27;s emotionally charged writings and agreed with his attempts to dissolve traditional churches for a more personal faith and rejection of the Bible as the literal Word of God; however, he eventually criticized Dippel as &quot;bound to no principles, but was in general opposed to all, whoever they may be, of whatever principle or faith ... becoming angry with any one for contradicting him.&quot; Swedenborg went so far as to suggest that Dippel was merely a cultish opportunist who used his theological charisma for his own financial gain and social influence, actively leading people away from traditional faith in order to &quot;take away all their intelligence of truth and good, and leaving them in a kind of delirium.&quot;

Dippel led an adventurous life, often getting into trouble because of his disputed opinions and his problems with managing money. He was eventually imprisoned for heresy, where he served a seven-year sentence. He created an animal oil known as &quot;Dippel&#x27;s oil&quot;, which was supposed to be the equivalent to the alchemists&#x27; dream of the &quot;elixir of life&quot;. At one point, Dippel attempted to purchase Castle Frankenstein in exchange for his elixir formula, which he claimed he had recently discovered; the offer was turned down.

According to Stahl, Dippel and the pigment maker Diesbach used potassium carbonate contaminated with this oil in producing red dyes. To their surprise, they obtained a blue pigment &quot;Berliner Blau&quot;, also called &quot;Preussisch Blau&quot; or &quot;Prussian blue&quot;.

There are claims that during his stay at Castle Frankenstein, he practiced alchemy and anatomy. He was allegedly working with nitroglycerin, which led to the destruction of a tower at the Castle Frankenstein. But this seems to be a modern myth, for it is an anachronism. Nitroglycerin hadn&#x27;t been discovered in Dippel&#x27;s time. And although the history of the castle during Dippel&#x27;s lifetime is well documented, the destruction of a tower – though surely a remarkable event – is nowhere mentioned.

Other rumours about Dippel appear to be modern inventions, too. For example, that which said he performed experiments with cadavers, in which he attempted to transfer the soul of one cadaver into another. Soul-transference with cadavers was a common experiment among alchemists at the time and was a theory that Dippel supported in his writings, thus making it possible that Dippel pursued similar objectives, but there is no direct evidence to link him to these specific acts. There is also no evidence to the rumour that he was driven out of town when word of his activities reached the ears of the townspeople — though he was often banned from countries, notably Sweden, for his controversial theological positions. He also eventually had to flee to Giessen after killing a man in a duel.

Dippel did, however, experiment quite frequently with dead animals, of which he was an &quot;avid dissector&quot;. In his dissertation &quot;Maladies and Remedies of the Life of the Flesh&quot;, Dippel claims to have discovered both the elixir of life and the means to exorcize demons through potions that he concocted from boiled animal bones and flesh. This is the same essay in which Dippel claimed to believe that souls could be transferred from one corpse to another by using a funnel.

Some of Dippel&#x27;s contemporaries, notably Johann Heinrich Jung, believed that toward the end of his life, Dippel lost his faith altogether after years of bitter disputes with other Christian leaders. Calling Christ &quot;an indifferent being&quot;, Dippel shifted all of his energy exclusively on his alchemical experiments. He set up a lab near Wittgenstein (which was eventually converted into a pub named after him, Dippelshof), and at this point in his life historical records are vague on his activities and thus grew folkloric in nature. During this time, at least one local minister apparently accused Dippel of grave-robbing, experimenting on cadavers, and keeping company with the Devil. For the most part, Dippel kept to himself and his work; he perhaps even actively perpetuated the rumours that he had sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for secret knowledge, as relying on his reputation as a dark sorcerer better enabled him to find audiences with those willing to pay for his knowledge of the philosopher&#x27;s stone and the elixir of life.

He died at Castle Wittgenstein near Bad Laasphe, probably from a stroke, though some contemporaries suspected poisoning. A year before his death, he wrote a pamphlet in which he claimed to have discovered an elixir that would keep him alive until the age of 135.

== Connection to the novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot; ==
Dippel&#x27;s connection to the Castle Frankenstein gave rise to the theory that he was a model for Mary Shelley&#x27;s 1818 novel &quot;Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus&quot;, although that idea remains controversial. This hypothesis was probably first suggested by Radu Florescu in his book &quot;In Search of Frankenstein&quot; (1975), which speculated that Shelley (then Mary Wollstonecraft) visited the castle during her travels on the Rhine with Percy Shelley, where they might have heard local stories about Dippel, which by then would have grown legendary and notorious. Florescu also notes that the Shelleys reference a brief interaction while touring the countryside around Castle Frankenstein with students of the University of Strasbourg, of which Dippel was once a student; these students could have told them stories about the infamous alumnus. In addition, the Shelleys knew several members of the so-called &quot;Kreis der Empfindsamen&quot;, a literary circle that met in Darmstadt from 1769 to 1773; Castle Frankenstein was frequently used as a location for their public readings, thus making it possible that Dippel&#x27;s legends could have come up during conversations between those in the circle and the Shelleys.

A local historian, Walter Scheele, believes that the legends told in the villages surrounding the castle were transmitted by Jacob Grimm to Mary Jane Clairmont, translator of Grimm&#x27;s fairy tales and stepmother of Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin. Scheele also claims that, in 1814, Mary, her stepsister Claire Clairmont, and Percy Bysshe Shelley are said to have visited Castle Frankenstein, on their way to Lake Geneva. Other historians, whether their field of research is Grimm, Shelley, or the Castle Frankenstein, do not see any evidence for this. Scheele&#x27;s claimed letter of Grimm is nowhere to be found. And no evidence can be found that Clairmont was considered the translator for Grimm&#x27;s Fairy Tales.
Several nonfiction books on the life of Mary Shelley also confirm Dippel as a possible influence. In particular, Miranda Seymour finds it curious that Mary speaks of &quot;gods [making entirely] new men&quot; in her journal so soon after her travels through the regions surrounding Castle Frankenstein; if rumors indeed existed throughout the area that Dippel experimented on cadavers in an attempt to create life, Seymour argues, Mary&#x27;s phrasing could be more than merely coincidental. In his book &quot;Frankenstein: The First 200 Years&quot;, Christopher Frayling refers to a passage in Mary&#x27;s diaries later in her life in which she expresses a desire to return to the region surrounding Castle Frankenstein to take in more of its folklore—implying that she is already familiar with at least some of the local legends. For now, however, the connection remains a subject of an ongoing debate.

===Later Dippel–Frankenstein connections===
Regardless of the historical validity of the connection, however, Dippel&#x27;s status as Frankenstein&#x27;s prototype seems assured in current popular culture (similar to Count Dracula&#x27;s equally controversial interchangeability with the historical Vlad the Impaler). In addition to Florescu&#x27;s speculative work, the Dippel/Frankenstein merging has appeared in several works of fiction: Robert Anton Wilson&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;The Earth Will Shake&quot; features Dippel as a monster-making, globe-hopping magician who calls himself Frankenstein; the science fiction novel &quot;The Frankenstein Murders&quot; portrays Dippel as an assistant to Victor Frankenstein; Topps&#x27; three-part comic book miniseries &quot;The Frankenstein-Dracula War&quot; lists Dippel as one of Dr. Frankenstein&#x27;s chief inspirations; Warren Ellis&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Womb&quot; hypothesizes that Shelley indeed visited Castle Frankenstein and heard of Dippel before writing her famous work; Christopher Farnsworth&#x27;s debut novel &quot;Blood Oath&quot; features a vampire trying to stop an immortal Dippel (who had once worked for Adolf Hitler) from creating a Frankenstein-like army; G.M.S. Altman&#x27;s novel &quot;Dippel&#x27;s Oil&quot; features a kindhearted Dippel living in modern times, bemused at his influence on the Frankenstein myth; Larry Correia&#x27;s novel &quot;Monster Hunter Vendetta&quot; makes reference to Dippel as the creator of an enigmatic character, &#x27;Agent Franks&#x27;; Kenneth Oppel&#x27;s 2011 novel &quot;This Dark Endeavor: The Apprenticeship of Victor Frankenstein&quot; includes several homages to Shelley&#x27;s influences, including the naming of Victor Frankenstein&#x27;s twin brother Konrad, after the alchemist; Stan Major&#x27;s novel &quot;Rimms of Khaos&quot; features Dippel as an immortal criminal mastermind, forced to make Frankensteinian monsters for a master vampire bent on world domination. Johann Dippel is mad-doctor Lord Hervey&#x27;s hero in the &quot;Frankenstein Chronicles&quot; TV series, and Dippel&#x27;s reanimated son becomes Hervey&#x27;s partner in crime. Also more recently in Jeanette Winterson&#x27;s 2019 novel &quot;Frankissstein&quot;, which dramatizes the Shelleys&#x27; visit to Castle Frankenstein, where they hear the story of Conrad Dippel&#x27;s determination to learn the secret of life in order to reanimated his beloved deceased wife.

Johann Dippel is mentioned as the teacher of one of the characters in the episode &quot;Lost and Found&quot; of the TV series &quot;The Frankenstein Chronicles&quot; (2015). In season 2, Laurence Fox plays Dippel&#x27;s son, who is involved in resurrections, but he is not mentioned as having met the Shelleys.

Dippel appears as a minor character in Larry Correia&#x27;s &quot;Monster Hunter&quot; series of novels as Konrad Dippel. He is credited with the creation of the Frankenstein monster, and contrary to Mary Shelley&#x27;s novel, he is credited with teaching the monster human mannerisms and the German language.

Dutch symphonic black metal band Carach Angren released a concept album inspired by Dippel, titled &quot;Franckensteina Strataemontanus&quot;, in 2020.

<doc id="865341" wikidata="Q871329" url="?curid=865341" title="Chevrolet Silverado">
<text>The Chevrolet Silverado is a range of trucks manufactured by General Motors under the Chevrolet brand. Introduced for the 1999 model year, the Silverado is the successor to the long-running Chevrolet C/K model line. Taking its name from the top trim level from the Chevrolet C/K series, the Silverado is offered as a series of full-size pickup trucks, chassis cab trucks, and medium-duty trucks. The fourth generation of the model line was introduced for the 2019 model year.

The Chevrolet Silverado shares mechanical commonality with the identically related GMC Sierra; GMC ended the use of the C/K nomenclature a model generation prior to Chevrolet. In Mexico, high-trim level versions of the Silverado use the Chevrolet Cheyenne name (not to be confused with the 2003 concept). Competing against the Ford F-Series, Ram pickup, Toyota Tundra, and Nissan Titan, the Silverado is among the best-selling vehicles in the United States, having sold over 12 million trucks since its introduction in 1998 as a 1999 model year.

==History==
The Silverado nameplate made its debut for the 1975 model year, becoming the top trim level on all Chevrolet C/K trucks, slotted above Custom Deluxe, Scottsdale, and Cheyenne. For the 1968 model year (seven years before the Silverado), GMC C/K trucks used variations of the Sierra name (Sierra, Sierra Classic, Sierra Grande, and High Sierra). Even after the C/K series officially ended, GM still uses the CK and the CC in their current model codes, to denote a two-wheel drive (CC), and four-wheel drive (CK).

For the 1988 GMT400 model architecture, Chevrolet retained the C/K model nomenclature, with GMC branding its full-size line as Sierras. While sharing the same body and chassis, the model chronology of the Silverado and Sierra are different, with five generations of the Sierra, while four of the Silverado.

In 2018, at the NTEA Work Truck Show in Indianapolis, Indiana, Chevrolet unveiled the first medium-duty Silverado, expanding the model line to a 4500HD, 5500HD, and 6500HD chassis cab. Largely the successor to the 2003–2009 GMT560 chassis, the medium-duty trucks are exclusive to Chevrolet, with no plans for an equivalent GMC version. Instead, Navistar International (now partnering with GM) would sell the medium-duty trucks as a rebadged counterpart, called the CV. This is in fact a very similar nod to how the Avalanche did not have a GMC Yukon–based equivalent, but instead, Cadillac would take its place as the former&#x27;s rebadged counterpart, the Escalade EXT.

==First-generation Silverado / second-generation Sierra (GMT800; 1999)==
The GMT800 Silverado/Sierra 1500 and 2500 pickup trucks were released in August 1998 as 1999 models. The &quot;classic&quot; light-duty GMT400 C/K trucks continued to be produced for the first two years alongside the new models, and the Heavy-Duty GMT400 pickups (alongside the GMT400 SUVs) were continued until 2000, with the new GMT800 Silverado/Sierra HD (Heavy Duty) released a year later. A 3500 model was added later for 2001, with the introduction of the HD moniker (though it was not until the 2007 GMT900 model year a 3500HD debuted).

The trucks were refreshed in 2002 for the 2003 model year, bringing slight design changes and an upgrade to the audio and HVAC controls. The 2007 GMT800 trucks, built after the new GMT900 entered production, used the name &quot;Classic&quot; to denote the difference between the two generations.

== Second-generation Silverado / third-generation Sierra (GMT900; 2007) ==


The GMT900 generation of the Silverado/Sierra arrived in the last quarter of 2006 as a 2007 model. It features a redesigned exterior, interior, frame, and suspension as well as power increases on certain engines. Like the previous generation GMT800&#x27;s and earlier C/K lines, it takes many styling cues from the GMT900 SUVs of the same year. Like the GMT900 SUVs, these pickups have improved aerodynamics over their predecessors thanks to steeply raked windshields and tighter panel gaps which help improve fuel economy. The previous GMT800 models were continued through 2007 badged as &quot;Classic,&quot; just as the GMT400 models continued for two years after the GMT800&#x27;s introduction. 

The new Silverado earned the &quot;North American Truck of the Year&quot; award for 2007 and was &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine&#x27;s Truck of the Year for 2007.

Production continued until 2013.


== Third-generation Silverado / fourth-generation Sierra (GMT K2XX; 2014) ==

On December 13, 2012, the fully-redesigned 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra were both introduced in Detroit, Michigan, later making their public debut at the North American International Auto Show. GM has now dropped the GMT900 platform, becoming &quot;K2XX.&quot; This generation of the Silverado/Sierra 1500 has three all-new gasoline engine options: a 4.3L EcoTec3 V6, a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8, and a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8, while dropping the 4.8L Vortec V8 from the last generation. Chevrolet&#x27;s MyLink touch-screen multimedia interface system became available on most models. It included A2DP stereo streaming technologies, Bluetooth hands-free telephone, USB hookups, and an input for an Apple iPod or iPhone. A Bose premium audio system, as well as a Bose surround sound audio system, was available on most models. OnStar became standard on all models.

Underneath, the Silverado rides on a fully boxed high-strength steel frame with hydroforming technology; truck cab&#x27;s frame is built with high strength steel as well. The third generation Silverado uses aluminum on the hood, for the engine block and for the control arms in order to save mass. The truck&#x27;s bed is made of roll-formed steel instead of stamped steel used by other manufacturers in order to save weight and gain strength. The third generation Silverado introduced the all-new upmarket top-of-the-line &quot;High Country&quot; trim level which includes saddle brown leather interior, which is Chevrolet&#x27;s very first entry into the luxury truck market since the 1955–1959 Task-Force 3100 &quot;Cameo Carrier.&quot; A fully-squared front fascia takes retro-modern styling cues from the GMT400 and 1981–1987 Square-Body trucks, and on Z71 models, a Z71 badge was added to the bottom right place of the grille. The first production Silverado completed assembly on April 29, 2013. The Silverado 1500 went on sale in May 2013 as a 2014 model, with the Silverado HD being available in early 2014 for the 2015 model year. On January 10, 2014, a recall was issued for 370,000 Silverado and Sierra pickups over a fire risk.

In the U.S., the 2014 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and 2015 2500HD/3500HD (as well as the latter&#x27;s 2015 High Country) were introduced to the Philippines market by Chevrolet Motorama Show in late November 2014 for MY2015, along with the MY2015 Suburban, Tahoe, Impala, Express, Trax, and Colorado.

On January 14, 2014, the Silverado, along with the Corvette Stingray, received the 2014 North American International Auto Show&#x27;s Car and Truck of the Year awards, respectively.

For 2018, this generation of Silverado was officially exported to Australia and converted to right-hand-drive and Australian Design Rules (ADR) by General Motors Australian subsidiary, Holden Special Vehicles (HSV). In the past, several independent specialists imported and converted Silverados and Sierras for Australian and right-hand-drive markets. Only 2500HD and 3500HD models equipped with 6.6L Duramax diesel option were available. Neither gasoline engines nor 1500 series trucks were offered.

===2015===

For the 2015 model year, the 6.2L EcoTec3 is now paired with the new 8-speed 8L90 transmission, offering a wider ratio spread with more closely spaced gears, quicker shifts, improved acceleration, and fuel economy. The Silverado 2500HD/3500HD models carried over the 6.0L L96 flex-fuel capable Vortec engine combined with the 6L90E transmission, installed with engine oil and transmission fluid coolers for hauling/towing applications. The 6.6L Duramax also continued to be backed by the 6-speed Allison 1000 automatic. The 1500 Regular Cab Long Box model also became available from the factory without a pickup bed (i.e., as a chassis cab). GM last offered its half-ton trucks as chassis cabs in 1980.

The GMC Sierra 2500HD/3500HD were the first &quot;heavy-duty&quot; trucks to offer an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), a Forward Collision Warning System (FCWS), and a Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS) available together as part of the available Driver Assist Package. The Driver Assist Package was standard equipment on the GMC Sierra 2500HD/3500HD Denali, and optional on most other Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD/3500HD and GMC Sierra 2500HD/3500HD models. Other new options for the Silverado and Sierra 2500HD/3500HD models included an eight-inch, full-color, reconfigurable LCD Driver Information Center (DIC) screen (for Sierra 2500HD/3500HD Denali models only), a 110-volt AC household-style power outlet, up to six available USB ports, an available eight-inch touchscreen infotainment system, and a power-sliding rear window with integrated defroster.

In mid-year 2015, Chevrolet and GMC made enhancements to the all-new Silverado 2500HD/3500HD and Sierra 2500HD/3500HD. Some of these enhancements included a new OnStar telematics system with 4G LTE Wi-Fi capabilities, new wheel designs, new exterior paint color options, new exterior tow mirror designs, a USB port added the glove compartment of trucks equipped with a front bench seat, DURALIFE brake rotors, the availability of dual 150 and 220 amp alternators for models equipped with the 6.6-liter Duramax Turbodiesel V8 engine, an off-road information screen added to the instrument cluster of 4×4 models equipped with the Z71 or All-Terrain Packages (the latter is a GMC-only option), a Bi-Fi Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) option for models equipped with the 6.0L Vortec gasoline V8 engine, a new All-Terrain Package available on SLE and SLT Double Cab and Crew Cab models (for GMC models only), a standard heavy-duty locking rear axle for all models, and the removal of HD Radio from the &quot;up-level&quot; IO5 and IO6 infotainment systems. A Regular Production Option (RPO) Code of &quot;AVF&quot; in the upper glove compartment distinguishes early-build 2015 models from their 2015.5 successors.

====Special Editions====
For 2015, Chevrolet introduced a Special Edition for the Silverado truck series. They are in the following series of Rally Edition 1 and 2, Midnight Edition, Custom Sport Edition, Custom Sport Plus Edition, Black Out Edition, and Texas Edition.

The interior backlighting on GMC Sierras changed from red to blue-green (or teal). Silverado and Sierra Double and Crew Cabs also received several new safety features, including GM&#x27;s Rear Seat Reminder and Teen Driver Mode.

===eAssist Mild Hybrid===
Starting in 2016, GM offered an &quot;eAssist&quot; mild hybrid version of the 5.3L V8 engine in the Silverado LT and Sierra SLT, but only in the state of California. The engine came with an 8-speed automatic transmission and had the same horsepower and torque as the standard version. For 2017, it was also available in Hawaii, Oregon, Texas, and Washington. For 2018, it became available nationwide and was also offered in the Silverado LTZ.

===Silverado SSV===
In late 2014, Chevrolet released the 2015 Silverado SSV (Special Service Vehicle) to complement its lineup of law enforcement vehicles.

It was available on four-wheel-drive 2500 HD crew cab models and came in either Black Onyx or Summit White exterior colors.

All Terrain X models had a body-color grille surround and a grille insert that was unique to the All Terrain. Body-color door handles, front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, and black accents, including belt moldings, front bumper skid plate, and B-pillar accents, gave it a monochromatic appearance.

Sierra HD All Terrain X models also included 18&quot; black-painted aluminum wheels—fitted with LT275/65R18 Goodyear Duratrac MT-rated tires—along with four-inch black sport side steps, black heated and power-folding trailering mirrors with integrated turn signals and LED guidance lamps, a spray-on bedliner, and a black bed-mounted sport bar, which was designed to support available LED off-road driving lamps from GMC Accessories.

In addition to the Centennial Edition, the remaining Silverado Special Editions were virtually unchanged from the last year model.

===2019 Silverado LD/Sierra Limited===
Chevrolet continued production of the third-generation Silverado 1500 for 2019, which was sold alongside the all-new, fourth-generation 2019 Silverado 1500. Renamed the Chevrolet Silverado LD (&quot;LD&quot; for Light Duty), production of the previous-generation truck moved from Fort Wayne, Indiana, to Oshawa Car Assembly, Ontario, Canada. Only available in &quot;Double Cab/Standard Box&quot; configuration and with the 5.3L V8 engine, the Silverado LD ended production in December 2019.

It was also sold alongside the new-style second-generation Silverado for the 2007 model year as the Silverado Classic. GMC also offered versions of their Sierra trucks as the Sierra Classic for 1999 and 2007 as well, and did the same for 2019, offering the predecessor generation model as the Sierra 1500 Limited.

== Fourth-generation Silverado / fifth-generation Sierra (GMT T1XX; 2019) ==
On December 16, 2017, Chevrolet unveiled the all-new, fourth-generation 2019 Silverado 1500 at its Chevy Truck Centennial Celebration Weekend at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, Texas. The debut of the all-new Silverado was not expected until early 2018. For its debut, the Silverado 1500 was airlifted via a helicopter onto a stage, where it was introduced to a crowd of Chevrolet truck owners and enthusiasts, as well as to the automotive press. Chevrolet NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. also spoke at the event. In addition to the reveal of the 2019 Silverado 1500, multiple Chevrolet trucks of different generations were on display as well.

The model shown at the reveal was the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LT Trail Boss, an all-new trim level added to the lineup, and is a factory-modified version of the Silverado 1500 LT Z71. Distinguishing features of the Trail Boss from other Silverado 1500 trim levels are its gloss black front fascia, black rear step bumper, black Chevrolet &quot;bow-tie&quot; emblems on the front grille and rear tailgate, 18-inch gloss black-finished aluminum-alloy wheels, large off-road tires, altered suspension, &quot;Trail Boss&quot; decals on the sides of the bed, front bumper-mounted center fog lamps, &quot;Z71&quot; emblems on each front fender, and red-painted front tow hooks.

The formal unveiling of the Silverado 1500 took place at the 2018 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan on January 13, 2018, exactly 100 years after Chevrolet delivered its first trucks to customers on January 13, 1918. The model was unveiled as a Silverado LT Trail Boss model.

Sales to customers began in August 2018 as an early 2019 model year vehicle with a base price of $32,200 MSRP.

The Silverado 1500 features a more sculpted exterior design, with headlamps that integrate into the grille (similar to more recent Ford trucks), and the former also incorporates LED Daytime Running Accent Lamps (DRL&#x27;s). Coincidentally, both brought in an all-new 10-speed automatic transmission.

For the 2020 model year, the Silverado 1500 has been launched in Australia for the first time. Holden Special Vehicles (known as General Motors Specialty Vehicles since 2021) has started the conversion to right-hand-drive and Australian Design Rules. The 6.2L V8 engine is the sole engine choice at the launch.

===Trims===
As of 2019, the Silverado 1500 was planned to be available in eight distinct trim levels: WT, Custom, Custom Trail Boss, LT, RST, LT Trail Boss, LTZ, and High Country.

All trim levels include a next-generation touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth for hands-free calling and wireless audio streaming via A2DP, power windows and door locks (on Double and Crew Cab models), air conditioning, and a rearview backup camera system. Additional features available on select trim levels include GPS navigation, SiriusXM Satellite Radio and Travel Link, OnStar with 4G LTE in-vehicle Wi-Fi, a Bose premium audio system with seven speakers, keyless access and push-button start, a remote starter system, heated and ventilated luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces, a heated leather-wrapped steering wheel, driver-assist technologies, a multi-angle camera system, and heated rear seats.

The package featured black Rally Stripes on the hood and tailgate, black CHEVROLET tailgate lettering, and black assist steps. The Midnight Edition featured Bucket Seats with Console, special headlamp bezels, black dual exhaust tips, and black assist steps. The Midnight Edition was only available on the LT Trail Boss trim level.

Also in 2020, Chevrolet and Realtree announced that there would be a 2021 Silverado 1500 Realtree Edition. This was the second time Chevrolet and Realtree teamed up to produce a special edition Silverado, having done so in 2016. The 2021 model was based on a Silverado 1500 Custom Trail Boss in Crew Cab Short Box configuration, adding 20-inch black wheels and Realtree camouflage graphics inside and out. Ultimately, only seven examples came to exist to the public in the United States.

===Engines===
The all-new 2019 Silverado and Sierra 1500 offers a choice of six different engine options, dependent upon trim level. The base engine on lower trim levels is the , 4.3-liter EcoTec3 E85-capable V6 gasoline engine. Standard on mid-level trims is an all-new, , 2.7-liter turbocharged inline-four gasoline engine (thus being the smallest engine available on a GM full-size half-ton pickup), and features cylinder deactivation for improved fuel economy. Optional on most trim levels is the , 5.3-liter EcoTec3 V8 gasoline engine, which is optionally E85 capable, and features either a carryover Active Fuel Management (AFM) system, or a brand-new Dynamic Fuel Management system (DFM), which now can shut off two, three, four, five, or six of eight cylinders. The availability of either AFM or DFM is dependent on trim level, with WT and Custom trucks available with AFM, and LT and above trucks standard with DFM. Optional on upper-level trims is a , 6.2-liter EcoTec3 V8 gasoline engine with Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM). An also all-new, 3.0-liter turbocharged Duramax I6 engine became available for the 2020 model year. Availability of this engine had been delayed because of EPA certification. All engines are paired to either a 6-speed, 8-speed, or 10-speed automatic transmission, with a choice of either two-wheel-drive or four-wheel-drive (the latter being standard equipment on Silverado 1500 Custom Trail Boss and LT Trail Boss trims, and optional on all other Silverado 1500 and Sierra 1500 models). For 2020, availability of both the 6.2-liter EcoTec3 V8 gasoline engine and the 10-speed automatic transmission will expand to most Silverado 1500 and Sierra 1500 trim levels.

According to EPA ratings, 2WD 2019 Silverado models with the 2.7-liter turbo inline-4 engine can achieve / city/highway.

====GMC Sierra====
The fifth-generation GMC Sierra was unveiled in Detroit on March 1, 2018. The Sierra 1500 differentiates itself from its Chevrolet Silverado 1500 counterpart by offering unique features, such as a two-piece tailgate, a pickup bed constructed from carbon fiber, a multi-color head-up display, a rearview mirror backup camera system, and a luxury Denali trim level. The Sierra 1500 also features its own distinct exterior styling, though interior styling is similar to that of the Chevrolet Silverado 1500.

There are six functions of GMC Sierra&#x27;s Multi-Pro Tailgate including a primary tailgate load stop for large items. Its inner tailgate can be a load stopper, a full-width step, and a work area by dropping down the load stop or provide easy access to the bed just by folding down the inner tailgate.

Powertrains include improved versions of the current 5.3-liter and 6.2-liter EcoTec3 V8 gasoline engines, as well as the same 3.0-liter Duramax turbocharged diesel I6 engine that is also available in the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 1500. An all-new, ten-speed automatic transmission comes as standard equipment on gasoline-powered Sierra 1500 models. Availability of the previous 4.3-liter EcoTec3 V6 gasoline engine was not announced at launch.

All trim levels included a next-generation touch screen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth for hands-free calling and wireless audio streaming via A2DP, power windows and door locks (on Double and Crew Cab models), air conditioning, and a rearview backup camera system. Additional features available on select trim levels included GPS navigation, SiriusXM Satellite Radio and Travel Link, OnStar with 4G LTE in-vehicle Wi-Fi, a Bose premium audio system with seven speakers, keyless access and push-button start, a remote starter system, heated and ventilated luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces, a heated leather-wrapped steering wheel, driver-assist technologies, a multi-angle camera system, and heated rear seats.

Initially only available with an pickup box, with a choice of two-wheel-drive or four-wheel-drive and the 4.3-liter EcoTec3 V6 or 5.3-liter V8 gasoline engines, the regular cab is exclusively available in the WT trim (1WT) for Silverado 1500, or the Sierra (1SA) trim for Sierra 1500. The regular cab option is not available in other trim levels in the United States and Canada, as these trucks are geared mainly towards fleet and commercial buyers. Although regular cab models with a bed and in higher trim levels actually are produced, they are only available for sale in Mexico and the Middle East. Starting in 2022, regular cab models with a bed were made available in the United States and Canada, albeit only in WT trim and with the 2.7L L4 engine.

===2020 changes===
The 2020 Silverado saw the deletion of the &quot;Oakwood Metallic&quot; exterior paint color. Aside from the 3.0 L Duramax, major additions were new vertical trailering mirrors, which include power adjustability, as well as power-folding and power-extension capabilities. Adaptive cruise control was optional on the LTZ and High Country trim levels, and SiriusXM 360L capability was available on LT and higher trims. The Silverado 1500 also deleted the keyless access buttons on the rear doors.

For 2021, the Silverado and Sierra pickups saw relatively few changes. Most notably, the Silverado 1500 offered the newly named Multi-Flex six-position tailgate, which was borrowed from the GMC Sierra, and the introduction of wireless CarPlay and Android Auto projection capability. The 2.7-liter 4-cylinder and 3.0-liter Duramax diesel–equipped Silverado and Sierra models saw increased towing capacity ratings and new towing technology, including a jack-knife alert and trailer length indicator. Several colors were changed on the Silverado: &quot;Havana Brown Metallic&quot; and &quot;Cajun Red Tintcoat&quot; were replaced by &quot;Oxford Brown Metallic&quot; and &quot;Cherry Red Tintcoat&quot;, respectively, and &quot;Mosaic Black Metallic&quot; is a new addition. 2021 Sierra models received color changes as well; &quot;Deep Mahogany Metallic&quot;, &quot;Red Quartz Tintcoat&quot;, and &quot;Carbon Black Metallic&quot; are replaced with &quot;Brownstone Metallic&quot;, &quot;Cayenne Red Tintcoat&quot;, and &quot;Ebony Twilight Metallic&quot;, respectively. &quot;Smokey Quartz Metallic&quot; was removed from the available color options and &quot;Hunter Metallic&quot; was added as a new paint color. For the 2021 Sierra, the previously unnamed &quot;Sierra&quot; trim officially became &quot;Pro.&quot;

Forward Collision Alert, Automatic Emergency Braking, and Front Pedestrian Braking options were now available on Silverado WT and Custom trim levels as part of the &quot;Safety Confidence Package&quot;. &quot;Crew Cab Standard Box&quot; Sierra 1500 models were now only available in four wheel drive.

Silverado and Sierra 3500 HD DRW models saw an increase in maximum towing capacity to .

Due to the global microchip shortage, some 2021 Silverado and Sierra vehicles were built without options like automatic start-stop and heated and ventilated front seats, heated outboard rear seats, and heated steering wheel.

=== 2022 changes ===

The 2022 Silverado LTD and Sierra Limited entered the model lineup as a stop-gap measure until production of the newly-refreshed 2022 model began. As such, the 2022 Silverado LTD and Sierra Limited had very few changes from the 2021 models.

Notable changes for the 2022 Limited models included the discontinuation of both the 4.3-liter LV3 EcoTec3 V6 and 5.3-liter L82 EcoTec3 V8 with active fuel management (AFM) gasoline engines, as well as the previous &quot;6L80&quot; six-speed automatic transmission, leaving only the 8-speed and 10-speed available. The LT Trail Boss trim-level (Chevrolet) was now available with the 3.0-liter Duramax turbodiesel engine. The 5.3L V8 is now no longer available on the Sierra 1500 Limited AT4.

=== 2022 refresh ===
For the 2022 model year, the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 receives a mid-cycle refresh that includes the following new trim levels for the Chevrolet Silverado, called the ZR2, and for the GMC Sierra, called the AT4X and Denali Ultimate. The refresh also includes a new front-end design, as well as a revised interior. All trucks equipped with front bucket seats receive a new center console-mounted transmission shift lever (trucks equipped with a front bench seat retain the previous column-mounted gear selector lever). The 3.0-liter Duramax turbocharged diesel engine now has expanded availability on more trim levels. The 5.3L V8 is not available on Sierra 1500 AT4 models once again.

The short pickup box option has returned for the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 Regular Cabs since last being offered in the US market on the previous generation from 2018. The current generation version, which was previously only available in Mexico and the Middle East, is only available in the U.S. market with the WT and Pro trims of the Silverado and Sierra, respectively. Other trim levels like RST and Trail Boss for the Silverado and Elevation and AT4 for the Sierra have been available with this configuration in the Middle East since 2019 but are not offered in the U.S. Base Silverado 1500 WT and Sierra 1500 Pro Regular Cab models now received standard power windows, door locks, and push-button start, although keyless entry remained an extra-cost option. All models from the LT (Silverado) and SLE (Sierra) and above received a newly standard 13.4-inch touchscreen infotainment system, which included wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration and SiriusXM Satellite Radio with 360L (up-level models also receive connected GPS navigation), while base models retained the previously-standard seven-inch touchscreen display. A new Silverado 1500 ZR2 model became the most off-road capable model in the lineup, while a new Sierra 1500 Denali Ultimate was now the top-tier trim of the lineup, which also received a new premium Bose surround sound audio system with an amplifier, subwoofer, and genuine metal speaker grilles. Top-tier Silverado and Sierra models received the General Motors Super Cruise semi-autonomous driving system, allowing for hands-free driving on most highways, and all models received more standard safety equipment.

Chevrolet also introduced a new trim level to this series, the ZR2, which slotted between High Country and LTZ. GMC models receive a similar, though more upscale model known as AT4X.

The refreshed 2022 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 began shipping to dealerships in the spring of 2022. Both brands also sold the outgoing models of both trucks, named the Silverado 1500 LTD and Sierra 1500 Limited respectively, alongside the new models. Only 1500 (half-ton) models of both trucks were refreshed for 2022, with a refresh of the heavy-duty (2500HD and 3500HD) trucks following in 2024.

In April 2023, GM introduced the 2500HD version of the ZR2, a new heavy-duty off-road model, as well as a special edition called the ZR2 Bison, in partnership with parts supplier American Expedition Vehicles. &quot;CNBC&quot; noted it was another sign of a trend where automakers grew their off-road models to increase profits. 

===Safety===
Sitting higher than other consumer vehicles, the Chevrolet Silverado has significantly larger blind spots in which people or other cars are invisible to the driver. According to data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Silverado is the second most likely car to be involved in a fatal crash.

The 2022 Silverado 1500 LTD Crew Cab was tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS):

==Silverado EV==
In April 2021, GM President Mark Reuss announced Chevrolet would be building an electric variant of the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 pickup truck at the Factory ZERO complex in Detroit. The vehicle will have a targeted range of 400 miles. The vehicle was unveiled in January 2022 at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show (CES). The vehicle has been built from the ground up as a fully electric pickup by using a battery electric platform shared with the GMC Hummer EV, instead of using the existing Silverado platform. Production will start in the Factory ZERO assembly plant (formerly Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly) in the second quarter of 2023.

== Medium duty version (4500HD, 5500HD, 6500HD, and International CV) ==

For the 2019 model year, General Motors released the medium-duty Silverado 4500HD/5500HD/6500HD, joining the Chevrolet LCF 3500/4500/5500 model line (derived from the Isuzu NPR) and succeeding the prior Chevrolet Kodiak and GMC TopKick. Competing against the Ford F-450/550/650 and Ram 4500/5500, the model line spans Class 4–6 trucks, with GVWR ranging from . Unlike the previous Kodiak/TopKick line, which was discontinued in 2009, GM markets the medium-duty Silverado line exclusively as a Chevrolet with no GMC equivalent; along with a lack of divisional support for the segment, GM is seeking to rebrand the current GMC line as premium vehicles.

===History===
The medium-duty Silverado was co-developed with Navistar, which sells a rebadged variant as the International CV (Commercial Vocational); the CV replaces the International D series and as well as the International TerraStar. GM developed the powertrain, while Navistar was responsible for the chassis. With the exception of grilles and badging, both model lines are identical. Navistar assembles both lines at its Springfield, Ohio facility, using cabs assembled by Navistar in Springfield.

GM unveiled the medium-duty Silverado line at the NTEA Work Truck Show in March 2018. Navistar unveiled the CV Series that November, and production began in December.

===Design===
In contrast to smaller Silverado pickup trucks, the 4500HD/5500HD/6500HD and CV are only offered as a chassis cab vehicle intended for modification by upfitters/body builders, typically by adding specialized rear bodywork. The frame rails have been designed to ease installation for upfitters. It is marketed with two-door or four-door cabs and either rear-wheel or four-wheel drive, using a gear-driven transfer case. The hood tilts forward for easier access to the engine and for routine service. GM have designated the model as the GM515 or GM51P, depending on the end use, with the GM51P used for incomplete passenger bus chassis.

Both the Silverado medium-duty and CV are powered by a , variant of the Duramax 6.6L V8 diesel engine paired with an Allison 1000 or 2000 series automatic transmission. There is also a diesel exhaust fluid filling port by the passenger&#x27;s side door.
The front wheels can turn by up to 50 degrees to enhance maneuverability.

===Sales===
At its launch, GM introduced the model line primarily through its dealer network that specialized in fleet and commercial truck sales, known as the &#x27;Business Elite&#x27; program, alongside an additional limited number of selected dealerships.

==Military applications==
===LSSV===
When production of the CUCV II ended in 2000, GM redesigned it to coincide with civilian truck offerings. The CUCV nomenclature was changed to Light Service Support Vehicle (LSSV) in 2001. In 2005, LSSV production switched to AM General, a unit of MacAndrews and Forbes Holdings. The LSSV is a GM-built Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD, Chevrolet Tahoe, or Chevrolet Suburban that is powered by a Duramax 6.6 liter turbo diesel engine. The various Silverados, Tahoes, and Suburbans that are used provide numerous platforms for different kinds of vehicles. As GM has redesigned its civilian trucks and SUVs from 2001–present, LSSVs have also been updated cosmetically.

The Militarization of standard GM trucks/SUVs to become LSSVs includes exterior changes such as CARC paint (Forest Green, Desert Sand, or 3-color Camouflage), blackout lights, military bumpers, a brush guard, a NATO slave receptacle/NATO trailer receptacle, a pintle hook and tow shackles. The electrical system is changed to the 24/12-volt military standard. The dashboard has additional controls and data plates. The truck also can be equipped with weapon supports in the cab, cargo tie down hooks, folding troop seats, pioneer tools, winches, and other military accessories.

The Enhanced Mobility Package (EMP) option adds enhanced suspension, 4-wheel anti-lock brakes, a locking differential, on/off-road bead-lock tires, a tire pressure monitoring system and other upgrades. About 2,000 LSSV units were sold to U.S. and international military and law enforcement organizations.

===Variants===
*Cargo/Troop Carrier Pickup (2-door, Extended Cab, or 4-door Silverado)

===ZH2===
General Motors relaunched the GM Defense division in 2018 offering the ZH2 Silverado, an advanced technology Chevrolet Silverado with a hydrogen-powered fuel cell and a heavy-duty truck architecture modified for next generation military vehicle needs. There is also a ZH2 Chevrolet Colorado military version.

Chevrolet has won the Truck Series Manufacturers Championship ten times since the series inception in 1995 and Chevrolet drivers have won the Drivers Championship a combined 12 times. The Silverado was also the title sponsor for the Chevrolet Silverado 250 Truck Series race at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park.

The truck also won the Primm 300 off-road race in 2004, 2005, and 2006.
==World markets==

As of 2015, the Chevrolet Silverado is sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, Chile, and the Middle East (except Iran).

<text>A series of military conflicts between the Ottoman Empire and various European states took place from the Late Middle Ages up through the early 20th century. The earliest conflicts began during the Byzantine–Ottoman wars, waged in Anatolia in the late 13th century before entering Europe in the mid-14th century with the Bulgarian–Ottoman wars. The mid-15th century saw the Serbian–Ottoman wars and the Albanian-Ottoman wars. Much of this period was characterized by the Ottoman expansion into the Balkans. The Ottoman Empire made further inroads into Central Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries, culminating in the peak of Ottoman territorial claims in Europe.

The Ottoman–Venetian wars spanned four centuries, starting in 1423 and lasting until 1718. This period witnessed the fall of Negroponte in 1470, the siege of Malta in 1565, the fall of Famagusta (Cyprus) in 1571, the defeat of the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571 (at that time the largest naval battle in history), the fall of Candia (Crete) in 1669, the Venetian reconquest of Morea (Peloponnese) in the 1680s and its loss again in 1715. The island of Venetian-ruled Corfu remained the only Greek island not conquered by the Ottomans.

In the late seventeenth century, European powers began to consolidate against the Ottomans and formed the Holy League, reversing a number of Ottoman land gains during the Great Turkish War of 1683–99. Nevertheless, Ottoman armies were able to hold their own against their European rivals until the second half of the eighteenth century.

In the nineteenth century the Ottomans were confronted with insurrection from their Serbian (1804–1817), Greek (1821–1832) and Romanian (1877–1878) subjects. This occurred in tandem with the Russo-Turkish wars, which further destabilized the empire. The final retreat of Ottoman rule began with the First Balkan War (1912–1913), and culminated in the signing of the Treaty of Sèvres after World War I, leading to the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire.

== History ==

=== Rise of the Ottomans (1299–1453) ===
====Byzantine Empire====
After striking a blow to the weakened Byzantine Empire in 1356 (or in 1358 – disputable due to a change in the Byzantine calendar), (see Süleyman Pasha) which provided it with Gallipoli as a basis for operations in Europe, the Ottoman Empire started its westward expansion into the European continent in the middle of the 14th century.

Constantinople fell in 1453 after the Battle of Varna (1444) and the Second Battle of Kosovo (1448).

The remaining Greek states fell in 1461 (Despotate of the Morea and Empire of Trebizond) (see: Ottoman Greece).

====Bulgarian Empire====

In the latter half of the 14th century, the Ottoman Empire proceeded to advance north and west in the Balkans, completely subordinating Thrace and much of Macedonia after the Battle of Maritsa in 1371. Sofia fell in 1382, followed by the capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire Tarnovgrad in 1393, and the northwest remnants of the state after the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396.

====Serbian Empire====
A significant opponent of the Ottomans, the young Serbian Empire, was worn down by a series of campaigns, notably in the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, in which the leaders of both armies were killed, and which gained a central role in Serbian folklore as an epic battle and as the beginning of the end for medieval Serbia. Much of Serbia fell to the Ottomans by 1459, the Kingdom of Hungary made a partial reconquest in 1480, but it fell again by 1499. Territories of Serbian Empire were divided between Ottoman Empire, the Republic of Venice and the Kingdom of Hungary, with remaining territories being in some sort of a vassal status towards Hungary, until its own conquest.

====Crusades against the Ottoman Empire====
The papacy regularly offered crusade privileges from the 1360s generating no significant military response against Muslims in the Mediterranean. The first revival of activity was a 1390 Genoese plan to seize the Tunisian port of Al-Mahdiya. Both the Roman and Avignon popes awarded indulgences and the French king&#x27;s uncle, Louis II, Duke of Bourbon, was the leader. There is little evidence of cross taking, and the exercise was more of a chivalric promenade by a small force. After a disease-ridden, nine-week siege, the Tunis crusade agreed to withdraw. After their victory at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, the Ottomans had conquered most of the Balkans and had reduced Byzantine influence to the area immediately surrounding Constantinople, which they later besieged. In 1393, the Bulgarian Tsar Ivan Shishman lost Nicopolis to the Ottomans. In 1394, Pope Boniface IX proclaimed a new Crusade against the Turks, although the Western Schism had split the papacy. Sigismund of Luxemburg, King of Hungary, led this Crusade which involved several French nobles including John the Fearless, the son of the Duke of Burgundy, who became the Crusade&#x27;s military leader. Sigismund advised the Crusaders to focus on defence when they reached the Danube, but they besieged the city of Nicopolis. The Ottomans defeated them in the Battle of Nicopolis on 25September, capturing 3,000 prisoners.

As the Ottomans pressed westward, Sultan Murad II destroyed the last Papal-funded Crusade at Varna on the Black Sea in 1444 and four years later crushed the last Hungarian expedition. John Hunyadi and Giovanni da Capistrano organised a 1456 Crusade to lift the Siege of Belgrade. Æneas Sylvius and John of Capistrano preached the Crusade, the princes of the Holy Roman Empire in the Diets of Ratisbon and Frankfurt promised assistance, and a league was formed between Venice, Florence and Milan, but nothing came of it. Venice was the only polity to continue to pose a significant threat to the Ottomans in the Mediterranean, but it pursued the &quot;Crusade&quot; mostly for its commercial interests, leading to the protracted Ottoman–Venetian Wars, which continued, with interruptions, until 1718. The end of the Crusades, in at least a nominal effort of Catholic Europe against Muslim incursion, came in the 16thcentury, when the Franco-Imperial wars assumed continental proportions. Francis I of France sought allies from all quarters, including from German Protestant princes and Muslims. Amongst these, he entered into one of the capitulations of the Ottoman Empire with Suleiman the Magnificent while making common cause with Hayreddin Barbarossa and a number of the Sultan&#x27;s North African vassals.

==== Kingdom of Hungary ====
Since 1360s Hungary confronted with the Ottoman Empire. The Kingdom of Hungary led several crusades, campaigns and carried out several defence battles and sieges against the Ottomans. Hungary bore the brunt of the Ottoman wars in Europe during the 15th century and successfully halted the Ottoman advance.

In the year of 1442, John Hunyadi won four victories against the Ottomans, two of which were decisive. In March 1442, Hunyadi defeated Mezid Bey and the raiding Ottoman army at the Battle of Szeben in the south part of the Kingdom of Hungary in Transylvania. In September 1442, Hunyadi defeated a large Ottoman army of Beylerbey Şehabeddin, the Provincial Governor of Rumelia. This was the first time that a European army defeated such a large Ottoman force, composed not only of raiders, but of the provincial cavalry led by their own sanjak beys (governors) and accompanied by the formidable janissaries. These victories made Hunyadi a prominent enemy of the Ottomans and a renowned figure throughout Christendom and were prime motivators for him to undertake along with King Władysław the famous expedition known as the &quot;Long Campaign&quot; in 1443, with the Battle of Niš being the first major clash of this expedition. Hunyadi was accompanied by Giuliano Cesarini during the campaign.

The defeat in 1456 at the siege of Nándorfehérvár (Belgrade) held up Ottoman expansion into Catholic Europe for 70 years, though for one year (1480–1481) the Italian port of Otranto was taken, and in 1493 the Ottoman army successfully raided Croatia and Styria.

During the reign of King Matthias of Hungary, the standing professional mercenary army was called the Black Army of Hungary Matthias recognized the importance and key role of early firearms in the infantry, which greatly contributed to his victories. Every fourth soldier in the Black Army had an arquebus, which was an unusual ratio at the time. In the great Viennese military parade in 1485, the Black Army consisted 20,000 horsemen and 8,000 infantry in 1485. The Black Army was larger than the army of King Louis XI of France, the only other existing permanent professional European army in the era. The Hungarian army destroyed the three times bigger attacker Ottoman and Wallachian troops at the Battle of Breadfield in Transylvania in 1479. The battle was the most significant victory for the Hungarians against the raiding Ottomans, and as a result, the Ottomans did not attack southern Hungary and Transylvania for many years thereafter. The Black Army recaptured Otranto in Italy from the Ottoman Empire in 1481.

=== Growth (1453–1683) ===
====Wars in Albania and Italy====

The Ottomans took much of Albania in the 1385 Battle of Savra. The 1444 League of Lezhë briefly restored one part of Albania, until Ottomans captured complete territory of Albania after capture of Shkodër in 1479 and Durrës in 1501.

The Ottomans faced resistance from Albanians who gathered around their leader, Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg, son of a feudal Albanian Nobleman, Gjon Kastrioti who also fought against the Ottomans in the Albanian revolt of 1432–1436 led by Gjergj Arianiti. Skanderbeg managed to fend off Ottoman attacks for more than 25 years, culminating at the siege of Shkodra in 1478–79. During this period, many Albanian victories were achieved like the Battle of Torvioll, Battle of Otonetë, siege of Krujë, Battle of Polog, Battle of Ohrid, Battle of Mokra, Battle of Oranik 1456 and many other battles, culminating in the Battle of Albulena in 1457 where the Albanian Army under Skanderbeg won a decisive victory over the Ottomans. In 1465 Ballaban&#x27;s Campaign against Skanderbeg took place. Its goal was to crush the Albanian Resistance, but it was not successful and it ended in an Albanian victory. With the death of Skanderbeg on 17 January 1468, the Albanian Resistance began to fall. After the death of Skanderbeg, the Albanian Resistance was led by Lekë Dukagjini from 1468 until 1479, but it didn&#x27;t have the same success as before. Merely two years after the collapse of the Albanian resistance in 1479, Sultan Mehmet II launched an Italian campaign, which failed thanks to Christian recapture of Otranto and Sultan&#x27;s death in 1481.
====Conquest of Bosnia====

The Ottoman Empire first reached Bosnia in 1388 where they were defeated by Bosnian forces in the Battle of Bileća and then were forced to retreat. After the fall of Serbia in 1389 Battle of Kosovo, where the Bosnians participated through Vlatko Vuković, the Turks began various offensives against the Kingdom of Bosnia. The Bosnians defended themselves but without much success. The Bosnians resisted strongly in the Bosnian Royal castle of Jajce (the siege of Jajce), where the last Bosnian king Stjepan Tomašević tried to repel the Turks. The Ottoman army conquered Jajce after a few months in 1463 and executed the last King of Bosnia, ending Medieval Bosnia.

The House of Kosača held Herzegovina until 1482. It took another four decades for the Ottomans to defeat the Hungarian garrison at Jajce Fortress in 1527. Bihać and the westernmost areas of Bosnia were finally conquered by the Ottomans in 1592.

====Croatia====

After the fall of the Kingdom of Bosnia into Ottoman hands in 1463, the southern and central parts of the Kingdom of Croatia remained unprotected, the defense of which was left to Croatian gentry who kept smaller troops in the fortified border areas at their own expense. The Ottomans meanwhile reached the river Neretva and, having conquered Herzegovina (Rama) in 1482, they encroached upon Croatia, skillfully avoiding the fortified border towns. A decisive Ottoman victory at the Battle of Krbava Field shook all of Croatia. However, it did not dissuade the Croats from making persistent attempts at defending themselves against the attacks of the superior Ottoman forces. After almost two hundred years of Croatian resistance against the Ottoman Empire victory in the Battle of Sisak marked the end of Ottoman rule and the Hundred Years&#x27; Croatian–Ottoman War. The Viceroy&#x27;s army, chasing the fleeing remnants at Petrinja in 1595, sealed the decisive Croatian victory.

====Conquest of Serbia====
As a result of heavy losses inflicted by the Ottomans in the Battle of Maritsa in 1371, the Serbian Empire had dissolved into several principalities. In the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, Serbian forces were again annihilated. Throughout the 15th and 16th centuries, constant struggles took place between various Serbian kingdoms and the Ottoman Empire. The turning point was the fall of Constantinople to the Turks. In 1459, following the siege, the temporary Serbian capital of Smederevo fell. Zeta was overrun by 1499. Belgrade was the last major Balkan city to endure Ottoman forces. Serbs, Hungarians, and European crusaders defeated the Turkish army in the siege of Belgrade in 1456. After repelling Ottoman attacks for over 70 years, Belgrade finally fell in 1521, along with the greater part of the Kingdom of Hungary. The rebellion of Serbian military commander Jovan Nenad between 1526 and 1528 led to the proclamation of the Second Serbian Empire in modern-day Serbian province of Vojvodina, which was among the last Serbian territories to resist the Ottomans. The Serbian Despotate fell in 1459, thus marking the two-century-long Ottoman conquest of Serbian principalities.

==== 1463–1503: Wars with Venice ====

The wars with the Republic of Venice began in 1463. A favorable peace treaty was signed in 1479 after the lengthy siege of Shkodra (1478–79). In 1480, now no longer hampered by the Venetian fleet, the Ottomans besieged Rhodes and captured Otranto. War with Venice resumed from 1499 to 1503. In 1500, a Spanish–Venetian army commanded by Gonzalo de Córdoba took Kefalonia, temporarily stopping the Ottoman offensive on eastern Venetian territories. The offensive resumed after the Ottoman victory of Preveza (1538), fought between an Ottoman fleet commanded by Hayreddin Barbarossa and that of a Christian alliance assembled by Pope Paul III.

==== 1462–1483: Wallachian and Moldavian campaigns ====
In 1462, Mehmed II was driven back by Wallachian prince Vlad III Dracula in the Night Attack at Târgovişte. However, the latter was imprisoned by Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus. This caused outrage among many influential Hungarian figures and Western admirers of Vlad&#x27;s success in the battle against the Ottoman Empire (and his early recognition of the threat it posed), including high-ranking members of the Vatican. Because of this, Matthias granted him the status of distinguished prisoner. Eventually, Dracula was freed in late 1475 and was sent with an army of Hungarian and Serbian soldiers to recover Bosnia from the Ottomans. There he defeated Ottoman forces for the first time. Upon this victory, Ottoman forces entered Wallachia in 1476 under the command of Mehmed II. Vlad was killed and, according to some sources, his head was sent to Constantinople to discourage the other rebellions. (Bosnia was completely added to Ottoman lands in 1482.)

The Turkish advance was temporarily halted after Stephen the Great of Moldavia defeated the armies of the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II at the Battle of Vaslui in 1475, one of the greatest defeats of the Ottoman Empire until that time. Stephen was defeated the next year at Războieni (Battle of Valea Albă), but the Ottomans had to retreat after they failed to take any significant castle (see siege of Neamț Citadel) as a plague started to spread in the Ottoman army. Stephen&#x27;s search for European assistance against the Turks met with little success, even though he had &quot;cut off the pagan&#x27;s right-hand&quot;, as he put it in a letter.

==== 1526–1566: Conquest of the Kingdom of Hungary ====


Since 1360s Hungary confronted with the Ottoman Empire. The Kingdom of Hungary led several crusades, campaigns and carried out several defence battles and sieges against the Ottomans. Hungary bore the brunt of the Ottoman wars in Europe during the 15th century and successfully halted the Ottoman advance. From 1490, after the death of King Matthias of Hungary, the royal power declined. In 1521, Hungary was invaded by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, the border fortress Belgrade considered as the key and southern gate of the Kingdom of Hungary, after two previous sieges, the Ottomans captured this stronghold by the Third Siege of Belgrade. The Sultan launched an attack against the weakened kingdom, whose smaller army was defeated in 1526 at the Battle of Mohács and King Louis II of Hungary died.

After the Ottoman victory in the Battle of Mohács in 1526, only the southwestern part of the Kingdom of Hungary was actually conquered. The Ottoman campaign continued between 1526 and 1556 with small campaigns and major summer invasions – troops would return south of the Balkan Mountains before winter. In 1529, they mounted their first major attack on the Austrian Habsburg monarchy, attempting to conquer the city of Vienna (siege of Vienna). In 1532, another attack on Vienna with 60,000 troops in the main army was held up by the small fort (800 defenders) of &quot;Kőszeg&quot; in western Hungary, fighting a suicidal battle. The invading troops were held up until winter was close and the Habsburg Empire had assembled a force of 80,000 at Vienna. The Ottoman troops returned home through Styria, laying waste to the country.

In the meantime, in 1538, the Ottoman Empire invaded Moldavia. In 1541, another campaign in Hungary took Buda and Pest (which today together form the Hungarian capital Budapest) with a largely bloodless trick: after concluding peace talks with an agreement, troops stormed the open gates of Buda in the night. In retaliation for a failed Austrian counter-attack in 1542, the conquest of the western half of central Hungary was finished in the 1543 campaign that took both the most important royal ex-capital, Székesfehérvár, and the ex-seat of the cardinal, Esztergom. However, the army of 35–40,000 men was not enough for Suleiman to mount another attack on Vienna. A temporary truce was signed between the Habsburg and Ottoman Empires in 1547, which was soon disregarded by the Habsburgs.

In the major but moderately successful Ottoman campaign of 1552, two armies took the eastern part of central Hungary, pushing the borders of the Ottoman Empire to the second (inner) line of northern &quot;végvár&quot;s (border castles), which Hungary originally built as defence against an expected second Mongol invasion—hence, afterwards, borders on this front changed little. For Hungarians, the 1552 campaign was a series of tragic losses and some heroic (but pyrrhic) victories, which entered folklore—most notably the fall of &quot;Drégely&quot; (a small fort defended to the last man by just 146 men, and the siege of Eger. The latter was a major &quot;végvár&quot; with more than 2,000 men, without outside help. They faced two Ottoman armies, which were surprisingly unable to take the castle within five weeks. (The fort was later taken in 1596.) Finally, the 1556 campaign secured Ottoman influence over Transylvania (which had fallen under Habsburg control for a time), while failing to gain any ground on the western front, being tied down in the second (after 1555) unsuccessful siege of the southwestern Hungarian border castle of Szigetvár.

The Ottoman Empire conducted another major war against the Habsburgs and their Hungarian territories between 1566 and 1568. The 1566 siege of Szigetvár, the third siege in which the fort was finally taken, but the aged Sultan died, deterring that year&#x27;s push for Vienna.

==== 1522–1573: Rhodes, Malta and the Holy League ====

Ottoman forces invaded and captured the island of Rhodes in 1522, after two previous failed attempts (see Siege of Rhodes (1522)). The Knights of Saint John were banished to Malta, which was in turn besieged in 1565.

After a siege of three months, the Ottoman army failed to control all of the Maltese forts. Delaying the Ottomans until bad weather conditions and the arrival of Sicilian reinforcements, made Ottoman commander Kızılahmedli Mustafa Pasha quit the siege. Around 22,000 to 48,000 Ottoman troops against 6,000 to 8,500 Maltese troops, the Ottomans failed to conquer Malta, sustaining more than 25,000 losses, including one of the greatest Muslim corsair generals of the time, Dragut, and were repulsed. Had Malta fallen, Sicily and mainland Italy could have fallen under the threat of an Ottoman invasion. The victory of Malta during this event, which is nowadays known as the Great Siege of Malta, turned the tide and gave Europe hopes and motivation. It also marked the importance of the Knights of Saint John and their relevant presence in Malta to aid Christendom in its defence against the Muslim conquest.

The Ottoman naval victories of this period were in the Battle of Preveza (1538) and the Battle of Djerba (1560).

The Mediterranean campaign, which lasted from 1570 to 1573, resulted in the Ottoman conquest of Cyprus. A Holy League of Venice, the Papal States, Spain, the Knights of Saint John in Malta and initially Portugal was formed against the Ottoman Empire during this period. The League&#x27;s victory in the Battle of Lepanto (1571) briefly ended Ottoman predominance at sea.

==== 1570–1571: Conquest of Cyprus ====
In the summer of 1570, the Turks struck again, but this time with a full-scale invasion rather than a raid. About 60,000 troops, including cavalry and artillery, under the command of Lala Mustafa Pasha landed unopposed near Limassol on July 2, 1570, and laid siege to Nicosia. In an orgy of victory on the day that the city fell—September 9, every public building and palace was looted. Word of the superior Ottoman numbers spread, and a few days later Mustafa took Kyrenia without having to fire a shot. Famagusta, however, resisted and put up a defense that lasted from September 1570 until August 1571.

The fall of Famagusta marked the beginning of the Ottoman period in Cyprus. Two months later, the naval forces of the Holy League, composed mainly of Venetian, Spanish, and Papal ships under the command of Don John of Austria, defeated the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto in one of the decisive battles of world history. The victory over the Turks, however, came too late to help Cyprus, and the island remained under Ottoman rule for the next three centuries.

In 1570, the Ottoman Empire first conquered Cyprus, and Lala Mustafa Pasha became the first Ottoman governor of Cyprus, challenging the claims of Venice. Simultaneously, the Pope formed a coalition between the Papal States, Malta, Spain, Venice and several other Italian states, with no real result. In 1573 the Venetians left, removing the influence of the Roman Catholic Church.

==== 1593–1669: Austria, Venice and Wallachia ====
* Long War (15-year war with Austria, 1593–1606) ends with status quo.
* Michael the Brave campaign against the Ottoman Empire (1593–1601)
* War with Venice 1645–1669 and the conquest of Crete (see Cretan War (1645–1669)).
* Austro-Turkish War (1663–1664): failed Ottoman attempt to defeat and invade Austria.

==== 1620–1621: Poland-Lithuania ====
Wars fought over Moldavia. The Polish army advanced into Moldavia and was defeated in the Battle of Ţuţora. The next year, the Poles repelled the Turkish invasion in the Battle of Khotyn. Another conflict started in 1633 but was soon settled.

==== 1657–1683 Conclusion of wars with Habsburgs ====
Transylvania, the Eastern part of the former Hungarian Kingdom, gained semi-independence in 1526, while paying tribute to the Ottoman Empire. In 1657, Transylvania under George II Rákóczi felt strong enough to attack the Tatars to the East (then the Empire&#x27;s vassals), and later the Ottoman Empire itself, which had come to the Tatars&#x27; defence. The war lasted until 1662, ending in defeat for the Hungarians. The Western part of the Hungarian Kingdom (&quot;Partium&quot;) was annexed and placed under direct Ottoman control. At the same time, there was another campaign against Austria between 1663 and 1664. Despite being defeated in the Battle of Saint Gotthard on 1 August 1664 by Raimondo Montecuccoli, the Ottomans secured recognition of their conquest of Nové Zámky in the Peace of Vasvár with Austria, marking the greatest territorial extent of Ottoman rule in the former Hungarian Kingdom.

==== 1672–1676: Poland-Lithuania ====
The Polish–Ottoman War (1672–1676) ended with the Treaty of Żurawno, in which the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ceded control of most of its Ukrainian territories to the empire. The war showed the increasing weakness and disorder of the Commonwealth, who by the second half of the 17th century had started its gradual decline that would culminate a century later with the partitions of Poland.

=== Stagnation (1683–1828) ===
==== 1683–1699: Great Turkish War – Loss of Hungary and the Morea ====

The Great Turkish War started in 1683, with a grand invasion force of 140,000 men marching on Vienna, supported by Protestant Hungarian noblemen rebelling against Habsburg rule. To stop the invasion, another Holy League was formed, composed of Austria and Poland (notably in the Battle of Vienna), Venetians and the Russian Empire, Vienna had been besieged by the Ottoman Empire for two months. The battle marked the first time the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Holy Roman Empire had cooperated militarily against the Ottomans, and it is often seen as a turning point in history, after which &quot;the Ottoman Turks ceased to be a menace to the Christian world&quot;.
 In the ensuing war that lasted until 1699, the Ottomans lost almost all of Hungary to the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I.

After winning the Battle of Vienna, the Holy League gained the upper hand and reconquered Hungary (Buda and Pest were retaken in 1686, the former under the command of a Swiss-born convert to Islam). At the same time, the Venetians launched an expedition into Greece, which conquered the Peloponnese. During the 1687 Venetian attack on the city of Athens (conquered by the Ottomans), the Ottomans turned the ancient Parthenon into an ammunitions storehouse. A Venetian mortar hit the Parthenon, detonating the Ottoman gunpowder stored inside, partially destroying it.

The war ended with the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699. Prince Eugene of Savoy first distinguished himself in 1683 and remained the most important Austrian commander until 1718.

==== 18th century ====

The Fourth Russo-Turkish War took place in 1710–1711 in the basin of the Pruth river, as part of the Great Northern War. It was instigated by Charles XII of Sweden after the defeat at the Battle of Poltava, in order to tie down Russia with the Ottoman Empire and gain some breathing space in the increasingly unsuccessful campaign. The Russians were severely beaten but not annihilated, and after the Treaty of the Pruth was signed, the Ottoman Empire disengaged, allowing Russia to refocus its energies on the defeat of Sweden.

The Ottoman–Venetian War started in 1714. It overlapped with the Austro-Turkish War (1716–1718), in which Austria conquered the remaining areas of the former Hungarian Kingdom, ending with the Treaty of Passarowitz in 1718.

A war erupted again with Russia in 1735 and Austria in 1737. It lasted until 1739 when the Treaty of Belgrade was signed with Austria and the Treaty of Niš with Russia.

The Sixth Russo-Turkish War started in 1768 and ended in 1774 with the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. As a result of this treaty, the Crimean Khanate became a Russian client state.

Another war with Russia started in 1787 and a concurrent war with Austria followed in 1788; the Austrian war ended with the 1791 Treaty of Sistova, and the Russian war ended with the 1792 Treaty of Jassy.

An invasion of Egypt and Syria by Napoleon I of France took place in 1798–99, but ended due to British intervention.

Napoleon&#x27;s capture of Malta on his way to Egypt resulted in the unusual alliance of Russia and the Ottomans resulting in a joint naval expedition to the Ionian Islands. Their successful capture of these islands led to the setting up of the Septinsular Republic.

==== 19th century ====
The First Serbian Uprising took place in 1804, followed by the Second Serbian Uprising in 1815. The result of this successful Serbian Revolution was the establishment of a semi-independent Principality of Serbia, and its acknowledgment by the Ottoman Empire (although &quot;de jure&quot; independent in domestic matters, the principality had to pay a yearly tax to the Porte and accept the permanent presence of the Ottoman army on its soil).

The Eighth Russo-Turkish War began in 1806 and ended in May 1812, just 13 days before Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia.

The Moldavian–Wallachian (Romanian) Uprising (starting simultaneously with the Greek Revolution).

The Greek War of Independence started in 1821. The Great Powers intervened from 1827 in support of the revolutionaries, including Russia (Ninth Russo-Turkish War). The Treaty of Adrianople ended the war in 1829, and forced the Ottomans to accept Greek independence (as the new Kingdom of Greece), more autonomy for Serbia and the Russian occupation of the Romanian principalities.

=== Ottoman decline (1828–1908) ===

The decline of the Ottoman Empire included the following conflicts.

Albanian rebellions 1820–1822, 1830–1839, 1843, 1845, 1847.

Bosnian rebellions 1831–1836, 1836–1837, 1841.

War with Montenegro 1852–1853.

The Tenth Russo-Turkish War of 1853–56, better known as the Crimean War, in which the United Kingdom and France joined the war on the side of the Ottoman Empire. Ended with the Treaty of Paris.

Second war with Montenegro in 1858–1859.

War with Montenegro, Bosnia and Serbia in 1862.

Cretan Uprising in 1866.

The decision to increase taxes to Christian nations in the empire&#x27;s Balkan provinces resulted in widespread outrage that lead to several revolts. The first was the Herzegovinian Uprising in 1875, followed by Bulgarian revolutionaries starting an uprising in April 1876 that was brutally suppressed (see Batak massacre). Later in June, Serbia and Montenegro jointly declared war on the empire. After six months of inconclusive fighting, international reaction to atrocities committed by Turkish troops forced intervention of the major European powers, which concluded a ceasefire. In December, the Constantinople Conference was organized to deal with the situation and resolve the crisis. However, the Ottoman Empire refused the proposed reforms and withdrew from the Conference.

Russia, inspired by Pan-Slavism and feeling support in the anti-Ottoman sympathies running throughout Europe, saw the chance to declare war on the Ottoman Empire and fulfill the union of all Orthodox nations in the Balkans under its mantle. That started the eleventh Russo-Turkish War in 1877, fought in the Balkans and in the Caucasus, with Russia leading a coalition with Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro. The coalition won the war, pushing the Ottomans all the way back to the gates of Constantinople. Russians and Ottomans signed the Treaty of San Stefano in early 1878. After deliberations at the Congress of Berlin, which was attended by all the Great Powers of the time, the Treaty of Berlin (1878) provided independence or autonomy for the Christian nations in the empire&#x27;s Balkan territories, and drastically restructured the map of the region.

Shortly after the war, Austria-Hungary was allowed to militarily occupy Bosnia, which formally continued to be part of the Ottoman territories.

Eastern Rumelia was granted some autonomy in 1878, but then rebelled and joined Bulgaria in 1885. Thessaly was ceded to Greece in 1881, but after Greece attacked the Ottoman Empire to help the Second Cretan Uprising in 1897, Greece was defeated in Thessaly. Crete would gain autonomy in 1898 after the Cretan Revolt (1897–1898).

=== Dissolution (1908–22) ===

====Italo-Turkish War====

In 1911, Italy invaded Ottoman Tripolitania (During the colonisation of Africa, Tripolitania became Libya), which was controlled by the Ottoman Empire. The war ended with the Italian annexation of the Tripolitania.

====Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising====
Bulgaro-Macedonian insurrection from 1903. See Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising.

==== 1912–13: Balkan Wars ====

Two Balkan Wars, in 1912 and 1913, entailed further action against the Ottoman Empire in Europe. The Balkan League first conquered Macedonia and most of Thrace from the Ottoman Empire, and then fell out over the division of the spoils. Albania declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912, after several rebellions and uprisings. This reduced Turkey&#x27;s possessions in Europe (Rumelia) to their present borders in Eastern Thrace.

====World War I====
World War I (1914–1918) became the ultimate cause of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, which formally ended in 1922. However, during wartime operations the Empire prevented the British Royal Navy from reaching Constantinople, stopping an Entente invasion in the Battle of Gallipoli (1915–1916). Nevertheless, under the provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) the Empire ultimately fell.

<text>The point spread function (PSF) describes the response of a focused optical imaging system to a point source or point object. A more general term for the PSF is the system&#x27;s impulse response; the PSF is the impulse response or impulse response function (IRF) of a focused optical imaging system. 
The PSF in many contexts can be thought of as the shapeless blob in an image that should represent a single point object.
We can consider this as a spatial impulse response function. 
In functional terms, it is the spatial domain version (i.e., the inverse Fourier transform) of the optical transfer function (OTF) of an imaging system. It is a useful concept in Fourier optics, astronomical imaging, medical imaging, electron microscopy and other imaging techniques such as 3D microscopy (like in confocal laser scanning microscopy) and fluorescence microscopy. 

The degree of spreading (blurring) in the image of a point object for an imaging system is a measure of the quality of the imaging system. In non-coherent imaging systems, such as fluorescent microscopes, telescopes or optical microscopes, the image formation process is linear in the image intensity and described by a linear system theory. This means that when two objects A and B are imaged simultaneously by a non-coherent imaging system, the resulting image is equal to the sum of the independently imaged objects. In other words: the imaging of A is unaffected by the imaging of B and &quot;vice versa&quot;, owing to the non-interacting property of photons. In space-invariant systems, i.e. those in which the PSF is the same everywhere in the imaging space, the image of a complex object is then the convolution of that object and the PSF. The PSF can be derived from diffraction integrals.

==Introduction==
By virtue of the linearity property of optical &quot;non-coherent&quot; imaging systems, i.e.,

: &quot;Image&quot;(&quot;Object&quot;1 + &quot;Object&quot;2) = &quot;Image&quot;(&quot;Object&quot;1) + &quot;Image&quot;(&quot;Object&quot;2)

the image of an object in a microscope or telescope as a non-coherent imaging system can be computed by expressing the object-plane field as a weighted sum of 2D impulse functions, and then expressing the image plane field as a weighted sum of the &quot;images&quot; of these impulse functions. This is known as the &quot;superposition principle&quot;, valid for linear systems. The images of the individual object-plane impulse functions are called point spread functions (PSF), reflecting the fact that a mathematical &quot;point&quot; of light in the object plane is &quot;spread&quot; out to form a finite area in the image plane. (In some branches of mathematics and physics, these might be referred to as Green&#x27;s functions or impulse response functions. PSFs are considered impulse response functions for imaging systems.

When the object is divided into discrete point objects of varying intensity, the image is computed as a sum of the PSF of each point. As the PSF is typically determined entirely by the imaging system (that is, microscope or telescope), the entire image can be described by knowing the optical properties of the system. This imaging process is usually formulated by a convolution equation. In microscope image processing and astronomy, knowing the PSF of the measuring device is very important for restoring the (original) object with deconvolution. For the case of laser beams, the PSF can be mathematically modeled using the concepts of Gaussian beams. For instance, deconvolution of the mathematically modeled PSF and the image, improves visibility of features and removes imaging noise.

==Theory==
The point spread function may be independent of position in the object plane, in which case it is called &quot;shift invariant&quot;. In addition, if there is no distortion in the system, the image plane coordinates are linearly related to the object plane coordinates via the magnification &quot;M&quot; as:

:formula_1.

If the imaging system produces an inverted image, we may simply regard the image plane coordinate axes as being reversed from the object plane axes. With these two assumptions, i.e., that the PSF is shift-invariant &quot;and&quot; that there is no distortion, calculating the image plane convolution integral is a straightforward process.

Mathematically, we may represent the object plane field as:

:formula_2

i.e., as a sum over weighted impulse functions, although this is also really just stating the shifting property of 2D delta functions (discussed further below). Rewriting the object transmittance function in the form above allows us to calculate the image plane field as the superposition of the images of each of the individual impulse functions, i.e., as a superposition over weighted point spread functions in the image plane using the &quot;same&quot; weighting function as in the object plane, i.e., formula_3. Mathematically, the image is expressed as:

:formula_4

in which formula_5 is the image of the impulse function formula_6.

The 2D impulse function may be regarded as the limit (as side dimension &quot;w&quot; tends to zero) of the &quot;square post&quot; function, shown in the figure below.

We imagine the object plane as being decomposed into square areas such as this, with each having its own associated square post function. If the height, &quot;h&quot;, of the post is maintained at 1/w2, then as the side dimension &quot;w&quot; tends to zero, the height, &quot;h&quot;, tends to infinity in such a way that the volume (integral) remains constant at 1. This gives the 2D impulse the shifting property (which is implied in the equation above), which says that when the 2D impulse function, δ(&quot;x&quot; − &quot;u&quot;,&quot;y&quot; − &quot;v&quot;), is integrated against any other continuous function, , it &quot;sifts out&quot; the value of &quot;f&quot; at the location of the impulse, i.e., at the point .

The concept of a perfect point source object is central to the idea of PSF. However, there is no such thing in nature as a perfect mathematical point source radiator; the concept is completely non-physical and is rather a mathematical construct used to model and understand optical imaging systems. The utility of the point source concept comes from the fact that a point source in the 2D object plane can only radiate a perfect uniform-amplitude, spherical wave — a wave having perfectly spherical, outward travelling phase fronts with uniform intensity everywhere on the spheres (see Huygens–Fresnel principle). Such a source of uniform spherical waves is shown in the figure below. We also note that a perfect point source radiator will not only radiate a uniform spectrum of propagating plane waves, but a uniform spectrum of exponentially decaying (evanescent) waves as well, and it is these which are responsible for resolution finer than one wavelength (see Fourier optics). This follows from the following Fourier transform expression for a 2D impulse function,

:formula_7

The quadratic lens intercepts a &quot;portion&quot; of this spherical wave, and refocuses it onto a blurred point in the image plane. For a single lens, an on-axis point source in the object plane produces an Airy disc PSF in the image plane. It can be shown (see Fourier optics, Huygens–Fresnel principle, Fraunhofer diffraction) that the field radiated by a planar object (or, by reciprocity, the field converging onto a planar image) is related to its corresponding source (or image) plane distribution via a Fourier transform (FT) relation. In addition, a uniform function over a circular area (in one FT domain) corresponds to in the other FT domain, where is the first-order Bessel function of the first kind. That is, a uniformly-illuminated circular aperture that passes a converging uniform spherical wave yields an Airy disk image at the focal plane. A graph of a sample Airy disk is shown in the adjoining figure.

Therefore, the converging (&quot;partial&quot;) spherical wave shown in the figure above produces an Airy disc in the image plane. The argument of the function is important, because this determines the &quot;scaling&quot; of the Airy disc (in other words, how big the disc is in the image plane). If Θmax is the maximum angle that the converging waves make with the lens axis, &quot;r&quot; is radial distance in the image plane, and wavenumber &quot;k&quot; = 2π/λ where λ = wavelength, then the argument of the function is: . If Θmax is small (only a small portion of the converging spherical wave is available to form the image), then radial distance, r, has to be very large before the total argument of the function moves away from the central spot. In other words, if Θmax is small, the Airy disc is large (which is just another statement of Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle for Fourier Transform pairs, namely that small extent in one domain corresponds to wide extent in the other domain, and the two are related via the &quot;space-bandwidth product&quot;). By virtue of this, high magnification systems, which typically have small values of Θmax (by the Abbe sine condition), can have more blur in the image, owing to the broader PSF. The size of the PSF is proportional to the magnification, so that the blur is no worse in a relative sense, but it is definitely worse in an absolute sense.

The figure above illustrates the truncation of the incident spherical wave by the lens. In order to measure the point spread function — or impulse response function — of the lens, a perfect point source that radiates a perfect spherical wave in all directions of space is not needed. This is because the lens has only a finite (angular) bandwidth, or finite intercept angle. Therefore, any angular bandwidth contained in the source, which extends past the edge angle of the lens (i.e., lies outside the bandwidth of the system), is essentially wasted source bandwidth because the lens can&#x27;t intercept it in order to process it. As a result, a perfect point source is not required in order to measure a perfect point spread function. All we need is a light source which has at least as much angular bandwidth as the lens being tested (and of course, is uniform over that angular sector). In other words, we only require a point source which is produced by a convergent (uniform) spherical wave whose half angle is greater than the edge angle of the lens.

Due to intrinsic limited resolution of the imaging systems, measured PSFs are not free of uncertainty. In imaging, it is desired to suppress the side-lobes of the imaging beam by apodization techniques. In the case of transmission imaging systems with Gaussian beam distribution, the PSF is modeled by the following equation:

:formula_8 

where &quot;k-factor&quot; depends on the truncation ratio and level of the irradiance, &quot;NA&quot; is numerical aperture, &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light, &quot;f&quot; is the photon frequency of the imaging beam, &quot;Ir&quot; is the intensity of reference beam, &quot;a&quot; is an adjustment factor and formula_9 is the radial position from the center of the beam on the corresponding &quot;z-plane&quot;.

==History and methods==
The diffraction theory of point spread functions was first studied by Airy in the nineteenth century. He developed an expression for the point spread function amplitude and intensity of a perfect instrument, free of aberrations (the so-called Airy disc). The theory of aberrated point spread functions close to the optimum focal plane was studied by Zernike and Nijboer in the 1930–40s. A central role in their analysis is played by Zernike&#x27;s circle polynomials that allow an efficient representation of the aberrations of any optical system with rotational symmetry. Recent analytic results have made it possible to extend Nijboer and Zernike&#x27;s approach for point spread function evaluation to a large volume around the optimum focal point. This extended Nijboer-Zernike (ENZ) theory allows studying the imperfect imaging of three-dimensional objects in confocal microscopy or astronomy under non-ideal imaging conditions. The ENZ-theory has also been applied to the characterization of optical instruments with respect to their aberration by measuring the through-focus intensity distribution and solving an appropriate inverse problem.

== Applications ==
=== Microscopy ===

In microscopy, experimental determination of PSF requires sub-resolution (point-like) radiating sources. Quantum dots and fluorescent beads are usually considered for this purpose. 
Theoretical models as described above, on the other hand, allow the detailed calculation of the PSF for various imaging conditions. The most compact diffraction limited shape of the PSF is usually preferred. However, by using appropriate optical elements (e.g., a spatial light modulator) the shape of the PSF can be engineered towards different applications.

=== Astronomy ===
In observational astronomy, the experimental determination of a PSF is often very straightforward due to the ample supply of point sources (stars or quasars). The form and source of the PSF may vary widely depending on the instrument and the context in which it is used.

For radio telescopes and diffraction-limited space telescopes, the dominant terms in the PSF may be inferred from the configuration of the aperture in the Fourier domain. In practice, there may be multiple terms contributed by the various components in a complex optical system. A complete description of the PSF will also include diffusion of light (or photo-electrons) in the detector, as well as tracking errors in the spacecraft or telescope.

For ground-based optical telescopes, atmospheric turbulence (known as astronomical seeing) dominates the contribution to the PSF. In high-resolution ground-based imaging, the PSF is often found to vary with position in the image (an effect called anisoplanatism). In ground-based adaptive optics systems, the PSF is a combination of the aperture of the system with residual uncorrected atmospheric terms.

=== Lithography ===

The PSF is also a fundamental limit to the conventional focused imaging of a hole, with the minimum printed size being in the range of 0.6-0.7 wavelength/NA, with NA being the numerical aperture of the imaging system. For example, in the case of an EUV system with wavelength of 13.5 nm and NA=0.33, the minimum individual hole size that can be imaged is in the range of 25-29 nm. A phase-shift mask has 180-degree phase edges which allow finer resolution.

=== Ophthalmology ===

Point spread functions have recently become a useful diagnostic tool in clinical ophthalmology. Patients are measured with a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor, and special software calculates the PSF for that patient&#x27;s eye. This method allows a physician to simulate potential treatments on a patient, and estimate how those treatments would alter the patient&#x27;s PSF. Additionally, once measured the PSF can be minimized using an adaptive optics system. This, in conjunction with a CCD camera and an adaptive optics system, can be used to visualize anatomical structures not otherwise visible &quot;in vivo&quot;, such as cone photoreceptors.

<doc id="865354" wikidata="Q741803" url="?curid=865354" title="RMS Mauretania (1906)">
<text>RMS &quot;Mauretania&quot; was a British ocean liner designed by Leonard Peskett and built by Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson on the River Tyne, England for the Cunard Line, launched on the afternoon of 20 September 1906. She was the world&#x27;s largest ship until the launch of RMS &quot;Olympic&quot; in 1910. &quot;Mauretania&quot; captured the eastbound Blue Riband on the maiden return voyage in December 1907, then claimed the westbound Blue Riband for the fastest transatlantic crossing during her 1909 season. She held both speed records for 20 years.

The ship&#x27;s name was taken from the ancient Roman province of Mauretania on the northwest African coast, not the modern Mauritania to the south. Similar nomenclature was also employed by &quot;Mauretania&quot;″s running mate , which was named after the Roman province directly north of Mauretania, across the Strait of Gibraltar in Portugal. &quot;Mauretania&quot; remained in service until September 1934, when Cunard-White Star retired her; scrapping commenced in Rosyth, in 1935.

==Overview==
In 1897 the German liner became the largest and fastest ship in the world. With a speed of , she captured the Blue Riband from Cunard Line&#x27;s and . Germany came to dominate the Atlantic, and by 1906 they had five four-funnel superliners in service, four of them owned by North German Lloyd.

At around the same time the American financier J. P. Morgan&#x27;s International Mercantile Marine Co. was attempting to monopolise the shipping trade, and had already acquired Britain&#x27;s other major transatlantic line, 
the White Star Line.

In the face of these threats the Cunard Line was determined to regain the prestige of dominance in ocean travel not only for the company, but also for the United Kingdom. By 1902, Cunard Line and the British government reached an agreement to build two superliners, &quot;Lusitania&quot; and &quot;Mauretania&quot;, with a guaranteed service speed of no less than . The British government was to loan £2,600,000 (equivalent to £ in ) for the construction of the ships, at an interest rate of 2.75%, to be paid back over twenty years, with a stipulation that the ships could be converted to armed merchant cruisers if needed. Further funding was secured when the Admiralty arranged for Cunard to be paid an annual subsidy as a Royal Navy Reserve Merchant Vessel (which also authorised both ships to fly the Blue Ensign), additional to the mail contract.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Mauretania&quot; and &quot;Lusitania&quot; were both designed by Cunard naval architect Leonard Peskett, with Swan Hunter and John Brown working from plans for an ocean greyhound with a stipulated service speed of twenty-four knots in moderate weather, as per the terms of her mail subsidy contract. Peskett&#x27;s original configuration for the ships in 1902 was a three-funnel design, when reciprocating engines were destined to be the powerplant. A giant model of the ships appeared in &quot;Shipbuilder&#x27;s&quot; magazine in this configuration. Cunard decided to change power plants to Parsons&#x27; new turbine technology, and the ship&#x27;s design was again modified when Peskett added a fourth funnel to the ship&#x27;s profile. Construction of the vessel finally began with the laying of the keel in August 1904. By tradition, the hull was painted in a light grey colour for photographic purposes during her launch; a common practice of the day for the first ship in a new class, as it made the lines of the ship clearer in the black-and-white photographs. Her hull was painted black after her maiden voyage.


In 1906, &quot;Mauretania&quot; was launched by the Duchess of Roxburghe. At the time of her launch, she was the largest moving structure ever built, and slightly larger in gross tonnage than &quot;Lusitania&quot;. The main visual differences between &quot;Mauretania&quot; and &quot;Lusitania&quot; were that &quot;Mauretania&quot; was five feet longer and had different vents. &quot;Mauretania&quot; also had two extra stages of turbine blades in her forward turbines, making her slightly faster than &quot;Lusitania&quot;. &quot;Mauretania&quot; and &quot;Lusitania&quot; were the only ships with direct-drive steam turbines to hold the Blue Riband; in later ships, reduction-geared turbines were mainly used. &quot;Mauretania&quot;″s usage of the steam turbine was the largest application yet of the then-new technology, developed by Charles Algernon Parsons. During speed trials, these engines caused significant vibration at high speeds; in response, &quot;Mauretania&quot; received strengthening members aft and redesigned propellers before entering service, which reduced vibration.

&quot;Mauretania&quot; was designed to suit Edwardian tastes. The ship&#x27;s interior was designed by the architect Harold Peto, and her public rooms were fitted out by two notable London design houses – Ch. Mellier &amp; Sons and Turner and Lord, with twenty-eight different types of wood, along with marble, tapestries, and other furnishings such as the stunning octagon table in the smoking room. Wood panelling for her first class public rooms was supposedly carved by three hundred craftsmen from Palestine but this seems unlikely, unnecessary and was probably executed by the yard or subcontracted, as were the majority of the second and third class areas. The multi-level first-class dining saloon of straw oak was decorated in Francis I style and topped by a large dome skylight. A series of elevators, then a rare new feature for liners, with grilles composed of the relatively new lightweight aluminium, were installed next to &quot;Mauretania&quot;″s walnut grand staircase. A new feature was the Verandah Café on the boat deck, where passengers were served beverages in a weather-protected environment, although this was enclosed within a year as it proved unrealistic.

== Early career (1906–1914) ==
&quot;Mauretania&quot; departed Liverpool on her maiden voyage on 16 November 1907 under the command of Captain John Pritchard, but failed to capture the Blue Riband due to a rough storm that broke free her spare anchor. She also suffered minor damage to her superstructure. On the return voyage, however, (30 November – 5 December 1907) she captured the record for the fastest eastbound crossing of the Atlantic, with an average speed of . On 23 December 1907, &quot;Mauretania&quot; was again at New York City and moored to Pier 54 in the North River when a squall with high winds struck, causing mooring posts on Pier 54 to give way. &quot;Mauretania&quot; went partially adrift, and her bow swung around and struck several barges which were bringing her coal and taking off ashes; the barges &quot;Roan&quot; and &quot;Tomhicken&quot; and the boats &quot;Eureka 32&quot; and &quot;Eureka 36&quot; were damaged and the barge &quot;Ellis P. Rogers&quot; was lost. In subsequent litigation, Cunard was found liable for damages. On 24 March 1908, the &quot;Mauretania&quot; had her bridge badly damaged when she was hit by an 80 foot (24.4 metre) tall rogue wave. Six bridge windows were smashed, injuring an officer.

In September 1909, &quot;Mauretania&quot; captured the Blue Riband for the fastest westbound crossing—a record that was to stand for more than two decades. In December 1911, as in New York City in December 1910, &quot;Mauretania&quot; broke loose from her moorings while in the River Mersey and sustained damage that caused the cancellation of her special speedy Christmas voyage to New York. In a quick change of events Cunard rescheduled &quot;Mauretania&quot;″s voyage for &quot;Lusitania&quot;, which had just returned from New York, under the command of Captain James Charles. &quot;Lusitania&quot; completed Christmas crossings for &quot;Mauretania&quot;, carrying travellers back to New York. &quot;Mauretania&quot; was on a westbound voyage from Liverpool to New York, beginning 13 April 1912, and was docked at Queenstown, Ireland, at the time of the disaster. &quot;Mauretania&quot; was transporting &quot;Titanic&quot;″s cargo manifest carried by registered mail. Traveling on &quot;Mauretania&quot; at the time was the chairman of Cunard, A. A. Booth, who organised a vigil for the &quot;Titanic&quot; victims. In the spring of 1913 westbound transatlantic passage aboard &quot;Mauretania&quot; cost roughly $17 for third class passengers, as shown in the original ticket at right.

In July 1913, King George and Queen Mary were given a special tour of &quot;Mauretania&quot;, then Britain&#x27;s fastest merchant vessel, adding further distinction to the ship&#x27;s reputation. On 26 January 1914, while &quot;Mauretania&quot; was in the middle of annual refit in Liverpool, four men were killed and six injured when a gas cylinder exploded while they were working on one of her steam turbines. Damage to the ship was minimal; she was repaired in the new Gladstone drydock and returned to service two months later.

==First World War (1914–1919)==
After Great Britain declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914, &quot;Mauretania&quot; made a dash for safety in Halifax, Nova Scotia, arriving on 6 August. Shortly after, she and &quot;Aquitania&quot; were requested by the British government to become armed merchant cruisers, but their huge size and massive fuel consumption made them unsuitable for the duty, and they resumed their civilian service on 11 August. Later, due to lack of passengers crossing the Atlantic, &quot;Mauretania&quot; was laid up in Liverpool until 7 May 1915, at the time that &quot;Lusitania&quot; was sunk by a German U-Boat.

&quot;Mauretania&quot; was planned to replace the &quot;Lusitania&quot; on the Transatlantic run after the Lusitania was sunk, but she was ordered by the British government to serve as a troop ship to carry British soldiers during the Gallipoli campaign. She avoided becoming prey for German U-boats because of her high speed and the seamanship of her crew. As a troopship, she was painted in dark greys with black funnels, as were her contemporaries.

When combined forces from the British empire and France began to suffer heavy casualties, &quot;Mauretania&quot; was ordered to serve as a hospital ship, along with the &quot;Aquitania&quot; and White Star&#x27;s &quot;Britannic&quot;, to treat the wounded until 25 January 1916. In medical service the vessel was painted white with buff funnels and large medical cross emblems surrounding the vessel and possibly illuminated signs starboard and port. Seven months later, &quot;Mauretania&quot; once again became a troop ship late in 1916 when requisitioned by the Canadian government to carry Canadian troops from Halifax to Liverpool.
Her war duty was not yet over when the United States declared war on Germany in 1917, and she carried thousands of American troops.

The ship was known by the Admiralty as HMS &quot;Tuberose&quot; until the end of the war, but the vessel&#x27;s name was never changed by Cunard. Starting in March 1918, &quot;Mauretania&quot; received two forms of dazzle camouflage, a type of abstract colour scheme designed by Norman Wilkinson in 1917 in an effort to confuse enemy ships. The first camouflage scheme, applied early in March 1918, was curvilinear in nature and largely broad areas of olive with blacks, greys and blues. The second scheme was the more geometric design commonly referred to as &quot;dazzle&quot;; this design, applied by July 1918, was mostly several dark blues and greys with some black. After her war service, she was repainted in a drab grey scheme and finally full Cunard livery by the middle of 1919.

==Post-war career (1919–1934)==

&quot;Mauretania&quot; returned to civilian service on 21 September 1919, now serving on the Southampton to New York route.

Her busy sailing schedule prevented her from having an extensive overhaul scheduled in 1920. However, in 1921, Cunard removed her from service when fire broke out on E deck and decided to overhaul the ship. She returned to the Tyne shipyard where she was built, where her boilers were converted to oil firing, and returned to service in March 1922. Cunard noticed that &quot;Mauretania&quot; struggled to maintain her regular Atlantic service speed.

Although the ship&#x27;s service speed had improved and it now burned only of oil per 24 hours, compared to of coal previously, it was not operating at her pre-war service speeds. On one crossing in 1922 the ship managed an average speed of only .

It was during these years her promenade was enclosed temporarily, and her funnels were modified to have an ovoid shape, making them look nearly identical to &quot;Lusitania&quot;. Cunard decided that the ship&#x27;s once revolutionary turbines were in desperate need of an overhaul. In 1923, a major refitting was begun in Southampton. &quot;Mauretania&quot;″s turbines were dismantled. Halfway through the overhaul, the shipyard workers went on strike and the work was halted, so Cunard had the ship towed to Cherbourg, France, where the work was completed at another shipyard. In May 1924, the ship returned to Atlantic service.


The next several years would prove to Cunard that the changes made to &quot;Mauretania&quot; had helped, and she was a very popular and successful vessel during this time. In 1928, &quot;Mauretania&quot; was refurbished with a new interior design and in the next year her speed record was broken by the German liner , with a speed of . On 27 August, Cunard permitted the former ocean greyhound to have one final attempt to recapture the record from the newer German liner, but even her best efforts could only come just short of &quot;Bremen&quot;&#x27;s record. She was taken out of service and her engines were adjusted to produce more power to give a higher service speed; however, this was still not enough. &quot;Bremen&quot; represented a new generation of ocean liners that were far more powerful and technologically advanced than the aging Cunard liner. Even though &quot;Mauretania&quot; did not beat her German rival, the ship lost by just a fraction after decades of design improvement and beat all her own previous speed records both east and westbound. In 1929, &quot;Mauretania&quot; collided with a train ferry near Robbins Reef Light. No-one was killed or injured and her damage was quickly repaired.

In 1930, with a combination of the Great Depression and newer competitors on the Atlantic run, &quot;Mauretania&quot; became a dedicated cruise ship running six day cruises from New York to Pier 21 in Halifax, Nova Scotia. On 19 November 1930, &quot;Mauretania&quot; rescued 28 people and the ship&#x27;s cat of the Swedish cargo ship which foundered in the Atlantic Ocean south east of Cape Race, Newfoundland. In 1932, she was painted white for cruise service. When Cunard Line merged with White Star Line in 1934, &quot;Mauretania&quot;, along with , , and other aging ocean liners, were deemed surplus to requirements and withdrawn from service.

==Retirement and scrapping==
Cunard White Star withdrew &quot;Mauretania&quot; from service following a final eastward crossing from New York to Southampton in September 1934. The voyage was made at an average speed of , equaling the original contractual stipulation for her mail subsidy. She was then laid up at Southampton, her twenty-eight years of service at a close.

In May 1935 her furnishings and fittings were put up for auction by Hampton and Sons and on 1 July that year she departed Southampton for the last time to Metal Industries shipbreakers at Rosyth. One of her former captains, the retired commodore Sir Arthur Rostron, captain of during the rescue, came to see her on her final departure from Southampton. Rostron refused to go aboard &quot;Mauretania&quot; before her final journey, stating that he preferred to remember the ship as she was when he commanded her.
En route to Rosyth, &quot;Mauretania&quot; stopped at her birthplace on the Tyne for half an hour, where she drew crowds of sightseers. Rockets were fired from her bridge, messages relayed, and she was boarded by the Lord Mayor of Newcastle. The mayor bade her farewell from the people of Newcastle, and her last captain, A. T. Brown, then resumed his course for Rosyth.
Approximately 30 miles north of Newcastle is the small seaport of Amble, Northumberland. The local town council sent a telegram to the ship stating, &quot;Still the finest ship on the seas.&quot; To which &quot;Mauretania&quot; replied with, &quot;to the last and kindliest port in England, greetings and thanks.&quot; Amble, to this day, is still known as &#x27;Amble, the Friendliest Port&#x27;, and this is still seen on signs when entering the town. With masts cut down to fit, the ship passed under the Forth Bridge and was delivered to the breakers.
&quot;Mauretania&quot; arrived at Rosyth in Fife at about 6 am on 4 July 1935 during a half-gale, passing under Forth Bridge. By 6:30 am she passed the entrance to the Metal Industries yards under the command of Pilot Captain Whince. A lone kilted piper was present at the quayside, playing a funeral lament for the popular vessel. It was reported to author and historian John Maxtone-Graham that upon the final shut-down of her great engines, she gave a dark &quot;final shudder...&quot;. &quot;Mauretania&quot; had her last public inspection on 8 July, a Sunday with 20,000 in attendance, with the monies raised going to local charities. Scrapping began shortly after and with great rapidity. Unusually, she was cut up afloat in drydock, with a complex system of wooden battens and pencil marks to monitor her balance. In a month her funnels were gone. By 1936 she was little more than a hulk, and she was beached at the tidal basin at Metal Industries and her remaining structure was scrapped by 1937.

To prevent a rival company using the name and to keep it available for a future Cunard White Star liner, arrangements were made for the Red Funnel Paddle Steamer &quot;Queen&quot; to be renamed &quot;Mauretania&quot; in the interim before the launch of the new in 1938.

The demise of the beloved &quot;Mauretania&quot; was protested by many of her loyal passengers, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who wrote a private letter against the scrapping.

==Post-scrapping==

The ship&#x27;s bell is in the reception of the Lloyd&#x27;s Register, Fenchurch Street, London. Annually for Remembrance Day, Lloyds Register observe two minutes of silence and lay a wreath at its base in honour of servicemen and women.

Some of the furnishings from &quot;Mauretania&quot; were installed in a bar/restaurant complex in Bristol called the Mauretania Bar (now Illuminati Bristol), situated in Park Street. The bar was panelled with great quantities of richly carved and gilt old growth African mahogany, which came from her first class lounge. The neon sign made for the 1937 opening on the south wall still advertises &quot;Mauretania&quot; and her bow lettering was used above the entrance.

Additionally, nearly the complete first class reading-writing room, with the original chandeliers and ornate gilt grilled bookcases, has been serving as the boardroom at Pinewood Studios, west of London. The colour is no longer shimmering silver sycamore – it has been altered over the years to an amber. According to a Channel 4 programme about coast properties the whole of the Second Class drawing room from the ship form the interior of a white and blue house overlooking Poole Harbour; the drawing room is overlooked by a balustraded circular veranda which is also original. Other panels and fittings were used to decorate the foyer and auditorium areas of the now defunct Windsor Cinema in Carluke. Some of the timber panelling was also used in the extension (completed in 1937) of St John the Baptist&#x27;s Catholic Church in Padiham, Lancashire.

In 2010, an African mahogany pilaster from the first class lounge, fluted with an intricate gilt acanthus motif and intact rams head capital, was discovered and restored; since 2012, it has been on permanent display in the Discovery Museum&#x27;s Segedunum Annex at Wallsend, just a few hundred yards from where it was carved and installed in the Swan Hunter fitting out basin, over a century earlier. Many examples of the liner&#x27;s fixtures and fittings exist in private collections as well, including large sections of moulding, panelling, ceilings and samples of her turbine blades. The original wheelhouse ( port high pressure turbine) telegraph from the &quot;Mauritania&quot; is on display in the lobby of the QE2, which now serves as a five star hotel, in Dubai.

An original model of &quot;Mauretania&quot; is displayed at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. after a long stay on the retired in Long Beach, California. Originally with a black hull, it was repainted to show her white cruising paint scheme in the 1930s after it was gifted to the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; by Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Another scale model of &quot;Mauretania&quot; is displayed at the Discovery Museum in Newcastle upon Tyne. It is still in its original color scheme.

A large builder&#x27;s model, showing &quot;Mauretania&quot; in her white cruising paint scheme, is displayed in the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic&#x27;s Cunard exhibit in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Originally a model of &quot;Lusitania&quot;, it was converted to represent &quot;Mauretania&quot; after &quot;Lusitania&quot; was torpedoed.

Another large builder&#x27;s model is situated aboard the ocean liner &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;, currently located in Dubai. This model was also originally &quot;Lusitania&quot;, and, like the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic&#x27;s model, it was converted into &quot;Mauretania&quot; after &quot;Lusitania&quot; was lost. When inspecting the model, one can tell it was &quot;Lusitania&quot; by examining the different boom crutches and bridge front, which is on the boat deck level.

A model of the vessel which was commissioned by Cunard is now held in the collection of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Mauretania&quot; is remembered in a song, &quot;The fireman&#x27;s lament&quot; or &quot;Firing the &quot;Mauretania&quot;&quot;, collected by Redd Sullivan. The song starts &quot;In 19 hundred and 24, I ... got a job on the &quot;Mauretania&quot;&quot;; but then goes on to say &quot;shovelling coal from morn till night&quot; (not possible in 1924 as she was oil-fired by then). The number of &quot;fires&quot; is said to be 64. Hughie Jones also recorded the song but the last verse of Hughie&#x27;s version calls upon &quot;all you trimmers&quot; whereas Redd Sullivan&#x27;s version calls upon &quot;stokers&quot;.

The Clive Cussler Isaac Bell novel &quot;The Thief&quot; is set aboard &quot;Mauretania&quot;. A terrible fire engulfs the forward storage area but it is brought under control.

&quot;Mauretania&quot; is also mentioned in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s poem &quot;The Secret of the Machines&quot;:

The boat-express is waiting your command!
You will find the &quot;Mauretania&quot; at the quay,
Till her captain turns the lever &#x27;neath his hand,
And the monstrous nine-decked city goes to sea.

&quot;Mauretania&quot; is mentioned at the beginning of James Cameron&#x27;s 1997 film &quot;Titanic&quot;. When Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) says of &quot;Titanic&quot;, “I don’t see what all the fuss is about. It doesn’t look any bigger than the &quot;Mauretania&quot;”, her snobbish fiancé Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane) inaccurately says to her that &quot;Titanic&quot; is “over a hundred feet longer” and that she is “far more luxurious” than her older competitor. 

The historical novel &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot; by British writer Roger Harvey set in Newcastle in the 1900s gives an accurate account of the building of &quot;Mauretania&quot; and features characters involved with her turbine engines. The climax of two love stories and a thriller comes as the ship approaches New York on her maiden voyage.

The ship that Spencer Dutton used to return the message from his aunt to return to the Yellowstone Ranch in &quot;1923&quot;.

One of the episodes involving the ship takes place in the 1976 animated series &quot;Candy Candy&quot;. According to the plot, the main character, Candy White, goes to study from New York to London on the &quot;Mauretania&quot;, and after a while, presumably on the same ship, Candy&#x27;s lover, Terrus Granchester, leaves for New York.

<text>Camilo Mori Serrano (September 24, 1896 – December 7, 1973) was a Chilean painter and a founder of the &quot;Grupo Montparnasse&quot;.

The son of an Italian immigrant, Camilo Mori entered the &quot;Escuela de Bellas Artes&quot; (School of Fine Arts) at the University of Chile in 1914 and studied under masters Juan Francisco González, Richón Brunet and Alberto Valenzuela Llanos. In 1920, he was sent by the Chilean government to further his studies in Europe]

Over the next three years, Mori spent time in Rome and Paris. He joined the gathering of artists in the Montparnasse Quarter in Paris. There, his encounter with Pablo Picasso and Juan Gris greatly influenced his ideas of painting. However it was the influence of the works of Paul Cézanne that challenged Mori to move away from the Realism that marked his earlier work. He started experimenting with a variety of styles which later formed the basis of modern art. He exhibited in the Salon d&#x27;Automne of 1920 in Paris, where his &quot;Circo de la Feria&quot; received an honorable mention.

He returned to Chile and became one of the founding members of the Grupo Montparnasse, a key influence in the diffusion of the new European painting trends in Chile. In 1928 Camilo Mori was named director of the National Museum of Fine Arts (Spanish: Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes or MNBA). During his tenure in this post, he was responsible for many initiatives aimed at promoting art in Chile. In 1928, as an initiative to mitigate the closure of the School of Fine Arts, Mori was once again sent by the Chilean government to Europe, this time to direct the studies of a group of young painters known as the &quot;Generation of 1928&quot; (Spanish: Generacion del 28), which culminated in 26 of the most outstanding young Chilean artists being sent to study in Paris for five years.

Mori returned to Chile in 1933, where he accepted a position as professor of drawing and color at the Universidad de Chile, a post he retained for over 30 years. In 1937 he moved to the United States where he spent two years exploring some of the newest artistic trends of the time. He was placed in charge of supervising the decoration of, and created a mural for, the pavilion of Chile at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair.

For his contribution to Chilean art, in 1950 he received the National Prize of Art. His work was complex and multifaceted and moved through Post-Impressionism, Expressionism, Cubism and Surrealism, with the common trend among them being a prominent treatment of color.

<doc id="865369" wikidata="Q1071075" url="?curid=865369" title="Chevrolet C/K">
<text>The Chevrolet C/K is a series of trucks that was manufactured by General Motors from the 1960 to 2002 model years. Marketed by both the Chevrolet and GMC divisions, the C/K series encompassed a wide range of vehicles. While most commonly associated with pickup trucks, the model line also included chassis-cab trucks and medium-duty trucks and served as the basis for GM full-size SUVs. Through its entire production, the model line competed directly against the Ford F-Series and the Dodge D series (later the Dodge Ram pickup).

Used for both the model branding and the internal model code, &quot;C&quot; denoted two-wheel drive, while &quot;K&quot; denoted four-wheel drive. Four generations of the C/K series were produced, including the GM monikered second-generation &quot;Action Line&quot; and third-generation &quot;Rounded Line&quot; vehicles (colloquially aka Square-Body trucks). For the fourth-generation (colloquially also known as OBS trucks), Chevrolet kept using the C/K designation while GMC revised its branding, changing to a singular GMC Sierra nameplate (C/K remained as an internal model code).

For South America, the model line was manufactured by General Motors de Argentina from 1960 to 1978, Sevel Argentina from 1986 to 1991, and General Motors Brazil, who produced versions of the model line for Brazil, Argentina, and Chile from 1964 to 2001.

As GM entered the 1990s, the company revised its truck ranges, replacing the medium-duty C/K trucks with the Chevrolet Kodiak/GMC TopKick for 1990. For 1999, GM replaced the fourth-generation C/K pickup trucks with an all-new model line; in line with GMC, Chevrolet dropped the C/K nameplate (in favor of a singular Chevrolet Silverado nameplate). Initially marketed with its successor, the final C/K pickup trucks were produced for the 2000 model year. From 2001 to 2002, the final vehicles of the C/K model line were medium-duty chassis cab trucks.


==First generation (1960–1966)==
Launched in the fall of 1959 as a 1960 model, the first-generation C/K debuted a number of design changes for General Motors light-truck design. Replacing the Task Force range, the C/K was developed from the start as a truck chassis, no longer sharing commonality with the GM A-body platform. Though developed as a truck for the sake of durability, the C/K adopted several features from cars into its design to increase its functionality. For pickup trucks, the C/K trucks used a drop-center frame which allowed for a lower cab and lower center of gravity, and independent front suspension was paired with a coil-sprung rear axle. For 1963, front torsion bars were replaced by front coil springs (on two-wheel drive vehicles).

While the first generation would not undergo a comprehensive facelift or update, GM would make a series of gradual changes to the model line through its production. For 1962, the hood was redesigned, with a new windshield and A-pillar added to the cab for 1964.

In a break from General Motors tradition, this is one of the few generations of trucks not given an in-house moniker. The C/K nomenclature was developed by GMC; &quot;C&quot; denoted conventional cab, with &quot;K&quot; standing for 4×4 drive.

==Second generation (1967–1972)==

The second-generation C/K was introduced for the 1967 model year. Designated the &quot;Action Line&quot; generation by General Motors, the C/K largely carried over its drop-center ladder frame and its coil-sprung rear axle, but the body was redesigned from the ground up to improve its capability as a multi-purpose vehicle. Alongside a utilitarian vehicle intended for work or farm use, the C/K was also offered with optional features carried over from Chevrolet sedans, including automatic transmissions, AM/FM radio, carpet, and two-tone paint.

While the Action Line would not undergo a definitive model revision through its production, the series underwent gradual changes on a biannual basis. The drivetrain line underwent multiple revisions, as a large-block V8 was offered for the first time in 1968. After 1969, GM switched entirely to Chevrolet-produced engines for C/K pickup trucks.

This generation marks the debut of the Chevrolet Cheyenne and GMC Sierra nameplates; introduced in 1971 and 1972, respectively, General Motors still uses both nameplates for full-size pickups in current production. The Action-Line pickup also served as the basis of ancestors of modern full-size SUVs, including the Chevrolet K5 Blazer, an open-body off-road vehicle, and the Chevrolet Suburban truck-based station wagon.

For 1973, GM replaced the Action Line trucks with the long-running Rounded Line series; the Action Line trucks are the final C/K trucks offered solely with a two-door cab.

==Third generation (1973–1991)==

The third-generation C/K was introduced for the 1973 model year. Designated the &quot;Rounded Line&quot; generation by General Motors, the C/K grew in size inside and out. As pickup trucks increased in use as personal vehicles, cab features and options moved closer in line with GM sedans (with power windows and power door locks becoming options). To further expand its practicality, a four-door crew cab body was introduced (offering 6-passenger seating).

While relatively straight-lined and boxy in appearance (leading to their &quot;square-body&quot; nickname from the public) the Rounded Line trucks were the first generation of the C/K to be designed with the use of computers and wind tunnels, optimizing the exterior shape for lower drag and improved fuel economy. The chassis was an all-new design (with all trucks receiving a leaf-spring rear suspension); K-Series trucks moved to all-wheel drive (shift-on-the-fly 4×4 was introduced for 1981).

Alongside the introduction of the four-door crew cab, the third generation C/K marked the introduction of a dual rear-wheel pickup truck (&quot;Big Dooley&quot;). For 1978, the C/K became the first American full-size pickup truck sold with a diesel engine (a 5.7L Oldsmobile diesel V8); a 6.2L diesel V8 was introduced for 1982. This generation also marks the first use of the Chevrolet Silverado nameplate (in use for Chevrolet full-size trucks today).

The Rounded Line generation is the longest-produced version of the C/K model line, produced for 18 model years. For 1987, it was renamed the R/V series (to accommodate the fourth-generation C/K marketed alongside it) and was gradually phased out through the 1991 model year.
==Fourth generation C/K / first generation Sierra (1988–2002)==

The fourth-generation C/K was introduced in April 1987 for the 1988 model year. Known officially by its GMT400 internal codename (GM never assigned this model line a generational moniker), these are informally known as the &quot;OBS&quot; (Old or Original Body Style). Slightly smaller in cab dimensions, the fourth-generation C/K increased interior space over its predecessor. After trailing Ford and Dodge by over a decade, GM introduced the C/K in an extended-cab configuration. For nearly five years, the fourth-generation C/K was sold alongside its R/V series predecessor, as the crew cab pickup (which served as the basis of the Suburban SUV) was not released until the 1992 model year.

In a branding change, the C/K nomenclature became exclusive to Chevrolet, as all GMC pickups became Sierras (GMC retained the C/K nomenclature for its internal model codes). Chevrolet introduced several specialized variants of the C/K series, including the work-oriented W/T 1500, off-road Z71, and the high-performance 454SS. Between one-ton trucks and the Kodiak medium-duty trucks, Chevrolet and GMC offered the C3500HD chassis cab for commercial use.

For 1995, the fourth-generation C/K underwent a mid-cycle revision, adding a driver-side airbag (dual airbags became standard for 1998). For 1996, the extended cab was redesigned, adding a rear-hinged passenger-side third door on select 1500 models.

For the 1999 model year, to accommodate the introduction of the GMT800-chassis Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra, the fourth-generation C/K was renamed as the Chevrolet Silverado Classic and GMC Sierra Classic. After the 2000 model year, C/K pickup trucks were discontinued. GM produced the heavy-duty C3500HD chassis cab as the final version of the C/K model family through the 2002 model year.
==South American production (1964–2001)==

General Motors Brazil produced three generations of light-duty Chevrolet pickup trucks from 1964 to 2001. Developed specifically for South American production, each version was also derived (to various extents) from the contemporary version of its American C/K counterpart. The model line also included truck-based station wagon/SUVs (similar to the Chevrolet Suburban).

In January 2002, GM Brazil ended production of full-size pickup trucks, concentrating its production towards the Chevrolet S-10 and car-based pickup trucks.

=== 1964–1984 ===
In 1964, GM Brazil launched its first line of light trucks designed in Brazil, the Chevrolet C-series pickup truck; in line with the Chevrolet Suburban, the model line was sold in a wagon configuration, renamed from C-1416 to Chevrolet Veraneio in 1969. Styled with an exterior exclusive to Brazil, the model line shared its instrument panel with the first-generation Chevrolet C/K of 1960–1966. Nearly a decade before its American counterpart, a four-door &quot;double cab&quot; was offered alongside the standard two-door configuration, sharing its doors with the Veraneio wagon/SUV.

The model line was launched with a 261 cubic-inch inline-six (derived from the Chevrolet &quot;Stovebolt&quot; engine); this engine was replaced in 1971 by a 250 cubic-inch inline-6 from the Chevrolet Opala. In 1976, the standard gasoline engine for the C-10 became a 2.5L inline-four. A four-cylinder diesel (Perkins 4236 3.8L) was introduced for 1978 in the D10 pickup. For 1981, the engine line was reduced to two, with a 4.1L inline-six becoming offered in gasoline and ethanol-fuel versions (C-10 and A-10) and the Perkins 4236 (D10).

=== 1985–1996 ===
For 1985 production, GM Brazil introduced the 20-series model line as its second generation of light trucks. Sharing its cab structure with the &quot;Rounded Line&quot; generation, the 20-series received its own front fascia (sharing headlights with the Opala) and larger taillamps than its American counterpart. Far more advanced in design than its utilitarian predecessor, the 20-series carried over little more than its powertrains from the previous generation. In addition to 20-series pickup trucks, GM Brazil offered a full line of Chevrolet medium- and heavy-duty trucks derived from the &quot;Rounded Line&quot; cab.

Again offered in single and double cabs (introduced in 1986), the C-20 and A-20 (ethanol) received a 4.1L inline-six, with the D-20 receiving the Perkins Q20B inline-4 diesel (replaced by the Maxion S4 for 1990). In contrast to its American counterpart, the 20-series was offered nearly exclusively with 2-wheel drive; a 4×4 version was offered for 1989 and was withdrawn before the end of the model year, following poor reliability of its drivetrain.

For 1988, the Veraneio wagon/SUV was redesigned for the first time since its introduction, adopting the 20-series body structure; the four-door was joined by the two-door Chevrolet Bonanza. With the exception of its taillamps and front fascia, the Veraneio adopted an appearance close to the Chevrolet/GMC Suburban; the Bonanza was proportioned similar to the Chevrolet K5 Blazer (though fitted with two-wheel drive and a permanent roof).

For 1992, the 20-series underwent a minor exterior revision, again sharing its headlights with the Opala (higher-trim vehicles shared wheels with GMT400 pickup trucks); the interior underwent a redesign, adopting a redesigned instrument panel.

For 1996, the model line adopted the fuel-injected version of the 4.1L six-cylinder from the Chevrolet Omega, ending its use of carbureted engines.
=== 1997–2001 ===

For 1997, the 20-series (based on the 1973 &quot;Rounded Line&quot; pickups) was retired, with GM Brazil introducing the Argentine-produced Chevrolet Silverado. In contrast to the previous two generations of Brazilian Chevrolet trucks, the Chevrolet Silverado was no longer a market-exclusive design; the Silverado was identical to the American-market GMT400 pickup. Offered only as a two-door C2500 with a standard-length bed, the Silverado was fitted with locally sourced powertrains, including a 138 hp 4.1L inline-six (from the previous C-20/A-20 and the Chevrolet Omega) and a MWM-produced 168 hp 4.2L turbodiesel inline-six.

The locally designed Veraneio and Bonanza were discontinued; in 1998, GM Brazil began production of the Chevrolet Grand Blazer, a renamed Chevrolet Tahoe.

For 2000 production, production of the Silverado shifted from Argentina to Brazil. Alongside the withdrawal of the Grand Blazer (in favor of the smaller S-10 Blazer), the Silverado adopted a D-20 suffix (from the popularity of its predecessor). During 2001, Chevrolet withdrew the 4.1L gasoline six-cylinder from the Silverado D-20 (the final vehicle to use the engine).

After many years of declining market share in the truck segment, GM Brazil produced the final Silverado D-20 in January 2002.

<text>Christian Otto Mohr (8 October 1835 – 2 October 1918) was a German civil engineer. He is renowned for his contributions to the field of structural engineering, such as Mohr&#x27;s circle, and for his study of stress.

==Biography==
He was born on 8 October 1835 to a landowning family in Wesselburen in the Holstein region. At the age of 16 attended the Polytechnic School in Hannover.

Starting in 1855, his early working life was spent in railroad engineering for the Hanover and Oldenburg state railways, designing some famous bridges and making some of the earliest uses of steel trusses.

Even during his early railway years, Mohr had developed an interest in the theories of mechanics and the strength of materials. In 1867, he became professor of mechanics at Stuttgart Polytechnic, and in 1873 at Dresden Polytechnic. Mohr had a direct and unpretentious lecturing style that was popular with his students. In addition to a lone textbook, Mohr published many research papers on the theory of structures and strength of materials.

In 1874, Mohr formalised the idea of a statically indeterminate structure.

Mohr was an enthusiast for graphical tools and developed the method, for visually representing stress in three dimensions, previously proposed by Carl Culmann. In 1882, he famously developed the graphical method for analysing stress known as Mohr&#x27;s circle and used it to propose an early theory of strength based on shear stress. He also developed the Williot-Mohr diagram for truss displacements and the Maxwell-Mohr method for analysing statically indeterminate structures, it can also be used to determine the displacement of truss nodes and forces acting on each member. The Maxwell-Mohr method is also referred to as the virtual force method for redundant trusses.

He retired in 1900, yet continued his scientific work in Dresden until his death on 2 October 1918.

<text>Nguyễn Đan Quế (born 13 April 1942) is a Vietnamese endocrinologist and pro-democracy activist in Saigon. He was imprisoned from 1978 to 1988, 1990 to 1998, 2003 to 2005, and briefly in 2011 on state security charges related to his activism. In 2003, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described him as &quot;Vietnam&#x27;s most renowned dissident&quot;.

==Early life==
Quế was born on 13 April 1942 in Hanoi in northern Vietnam, then occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army. His family, including his mother and five siblings immigrated to Saigon after the Geneva Accords, fleeing communist rule in North Vietnam. He received an M.D. from Saigon University at age 22. In the 1960s and early 70s, he trained in Europe on a United Nations scholarship, specializing in radiotherapy.

In 1974, he joined the teaching staff at Saigon University, and the following year became the director of Cho-Ray Hospital. He had the opportunity to leave the country but chose to stay to provide medical care to the poor. However, he was removed from his post one year later for criticizing the communist regime&#x27;s discriminatory health care policy. He then formed the pro-democracy group National Front for Progress. He also became Amnesty International&#x27;s first member in Vietnam and began publishing two underground newspapers, &quot;The Uprising&quot; (Vung Day) for youth and &quot;The People’s Uprising&quot; (Toan Dan Vung Day) for the general public, to question the government&#x27;s violations of basic human rights and to demand that the government reduce military spending and invest in the welfare of the people. In 1978, he was arrested for his continued critique of national health care policy, along with 47 associates, and imprisoned without trial; many were tortured and five died in captivity. When Quế demanded improvement in the treatment of political prisoners, he was incarcerated in a five-by-six foot cell without sanitary facilities for two months. He was sentenced for 10 years imprisonment.

== 1990–1998 imprisonment ==
Quế formed a new pro-democracy group following his arrest called the High Tide of Humanism Movement (). On 14 June 1990, he was arrested again. On 29 November 1991, after a half-hour sham trial he was sentenced to twenty years of hard labor plus five years&#x27; house arrest for treason after sending documents to Amnesty International; according to the Vietnamese national press agency, &quot;reactionary forces used them to denigrate Vietnam&quot; and &quot;attempting to overthrow the people&#x27;s government&quot;. Quế&#x27;s family and human rights groups reported that he was assigned to hard labor despite declining health. Vietnam&#x27;s foreign ministry denied the statement.

In April 1991, U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey attempted repeatedly to meet with Quế, but was refused; U.S. Senator Charles S. Robb, whose district included Quế&#x27;s brother, was blocked by the Vietnamese government from meeting with Quế to bring him medicine in August 1993. Quế&#x27;s case was also taken up by the European Parliament, Amnesty International, and France.

Quế was released in a 1998 general amnesty that included fellow dissident Doan Viet Hoat. Both Quế and Hoat were offered resettlement in the United States on the condition that they leave the country. Quế refused, stating that he would rather stay in prison than be forced into exile.

==Later activism==
Quế remained in Vietnam, and on 12 May 1999, posted a statement to the Internet advocating free elections for the National Assembly. On 17 March 2003, Quế was arrested for again after he wrote a series of articles about Vietnamese media censorship, with the regime accusing him of &quot;espionage&quot;. On 29 January 2004, the Ho Chi Minh People&#x27;s Court found him guilty of &quot;abusing democratic rights to jeopardise the interests of the state, and the legitimate rights and interests of social organisations and citizens&quot; and sentenced to 30 months&#x27; imprisonment. On September 22, 2004, Quế was secretly sent to a hard labor camp (gulag) in Thanh Hoa Province. However, he was granted an amnesty on 31 January 2005 for Tết, the Vietnamese New Year, along with fellow dissidents Nguyen Van Ly, Nguyen Dinh Huy, and Huynh Van Ba.

In mid-February 2011, Quế posted an Internet appeal for mass demonstrations in Vietnam on the model of the Arab Spring uprisings, calling on citizens to make a &quot;clean sweep of Communist dictatorship and build a new, free, democratic, humane and progressive Vietnam&quot;. He was then detained by the authorities for &quot;directly violating the stability and strength of the people&#x27;s government&quot;. Following a raid on his home, police reported that they had found thousands of anti-government documents in his home. A government media report stated that he had been caught &quot;red-handed keeping and distributing documents&quot; calling for revolution. Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience and called for his immediate release. On 6 March 2012, former U.S. Representative Joseph Cao organized a Vietnamese-American lobbying effort for Quế, Nguyen Van Ly, Dieu Cay, and other Vietnamese political prisoners, calling on the administration of President Barack Obama and the U.S. Congress to take a stronger stand on their behalf.

==Awards==
In 1995, Quế was given the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award by the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights. The Center praised his work &quot;promoting greater freedom of expression and human rights in Viet Nam&quot;. In 2004, he was a finalist for the US-based Civil Courage Prize, which &quot;honors civil courage — steadfast resistance to evil at great personal risk — rather than military valor&quot;. He ultimately won a &quot;Certificate of Distinction in Civil Courage&quot; and a $1,000 cash prize.

<doc id="865380" wikidata="Q7624098" url="?curid=865380" title="Strip squeeze">
<text>A strip squeeze is a declarer technique at contract bridge combining elements of squeeze and endplay.

This squeeze occurs when declarer has two or more losers remaining. By cashing winners, declarer forces the squeezed defender to discard cards so that he cannot defeat the contract. Eventually, the defender will be forced to unguard a potential winner, exposing it to capture or be put on lead and forced to lead a suit that will cost his side a trick.

==Examples==
South is in a 6 contract with 11 top tricks on the K lead. To perform a simple squeeze, South would have to lose a trick at some point to rectify the count. This will not work on this hand because the only menaces South has are in clubs and spades. Ducking a trick in clubs would allow East to guard the suit.

South must rely on a strip squeeze to make the hand. The first club trick is won, and the hearts then the diamonds are cashed. 
South remains with Q 4 J and A3 4 in dummy. West must choose between baring the K or Q. If West keeps K x, South puts West on lead with a club to lead away from the spade. Otherwise, South plays a spade to the Ace to drop West&#x27;s King.

An experienced West will try to make things as difficult as possible for South so that the correct route to 12 tricks is not certain. Making the key discard before the final winner is cashed will introduce as much ambiguity as possible. Although in double-dummy it is impossible to go wrong, occasionally South will make the wrong decision in competition.
Squeezes often require declarer to know the location of specific high cards or the number of cards a defender holds in a particular suit, in order to know what cards the squeezee will be forced to play. Examples 2a and 2b illustrates:

Again South needs three of the remaining tricks in a notrump contract. In Example 2a the presence of the diamond loser means that when South cashes the A, West is not squeezed. He can safely discard his idle 7. However, when South next plays the 3, West is squeezed again. East wins the Q, but must lead to dummy&#x27;s winners.

In Example 2b East&#x27;s 3 2 are replaced by the 3 2 and declarer must know East&#x27;s club length in order to make the correct play. If South cashes the A and then leads the 3, East wins the Q and will take the rest of the tricks. In this case, the correct play is for South to lose the Q immediately, before taking the A, in order to rectify the count. Now East is forced to lead a club to South&#x27;s ace, and West is squeezed as before.

But with East&#x27;s hand as shown in Example 2a, losing the Q first does not work. East can return a spade, and declarer will score only the A. Not only does the squeeze position disappear, but there is no entry to cash the A.

<text>Deep Thought was a computer designed to play chess. Deep Thought was initially developed at Carnegie Mellon University and later at IBM. It was second in the line of chess computers developed by Feng-hsiung Hsu, starting with ChipTest and culminating in Deep Blue. In addition to Hsu, the Deep Thought team included Thomas Anantharaman, Mike Browne, Murray Campbell and Andreas Nowatzyk. Deep Thought became the first computer to beat a grandmaster in a regular tournament game when it beat Bent Larsen in 1988, but was easily defeated in both games of a two-game match with Garry Kasparov in 1989 as well as in a correspondence match with Michael Valvo.

It was named after Deep Thought, a fictional computer in Douglas Adams&#x27; series, &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. The naming of chess computers has continued in this vein with Deep Blue, Deep Fritz, Deep Junior, etc.

Deep Thought won the North American Computer Chess Championship in 1988 and the World Computer Chess Championship in the year 1989, and its rating, according to the USCF was 2551. In 1994, Deep Thought 2 won the North American Computer Chess Championship for the fifth time, with its rating estimated at around 2600. It was sponsored by IBM. Some engineers who designed Deep Thought also worked in the design of Deep Thought 2. Its algorithms were quite simple evaluation functions, but it could examine half a billion chess positions per move in tournament games, which is sufficient to reach depth of 10 or 11 moves ahead in complex positions. Despite that, using the technique of &quot;singular extensions&quot; it could also follow lines of forced moves that reach even further, which is how it once found a checkmate in 18 moves.

<text>Cardamine is a large genus of flowering plants in the mustard family, Brassicaceae, known as bittercresses and toothworts. It contains more than 200 species of annuals and perennials. Species in this genus can be found in diverse habitats worldwide, except the Antarctic. The name &quot;Cardamine&quot; is derived from the Greek &quot;kardaminē&quot;, water cress, from &quot;kardamon&quot;, pepper grass.

==Description==
The leaves can have different forms, from minute to medium in size. They can be simple, pinnate or bipinnate. They are basal and cauline (growing on the upper part of the stem), with narrow tips. They are rosulate (forming a rosette). The blade margins can be entire, serrate or dentate. The stem internodes lack firmness.

The radially symmetrical flowers grow in a racemose many-flowered inflorescence or in corymbs. The white, pink or purple flowers are minute to medium-sized. The petals are longer than the sepals. The fertile flowers are hermaphroditic.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Cardamine&quot; was first formally named in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in his &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;. , there are 264 accepted species in Kew&#x27;s Plants of the World Online database.

The genus name Dentaria is a commonly used synonym for some species of &quot;Cardamine&quot;.

==Species==

Select species include:


==Ecology==

This plant is also used as one of the main food sources for the butterfly &quot;Pieris oleracea.&quot;

==Uses==
The roots of most species are edible raw.

Some species were reputed to have medicinal qualities (treatment of heart or stomach ailments).

<text>Vibe (real name Paco Ramone or Francisco &quot;Cisco&quot; Ramon) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics.

He has the metahuman ability to emit powerful vibratory shock waves. Introduced in 1984, he joined the new Justice League formed in Detroit and became the first member to be killed in action. In DC&#x27;s New 52 continuity, his powers were redefined to involve interdimensional physics, posing a significant threat to characters like the Flash. 

Carlos Valdes portrays Cisco Ramon in The CW&#x27;s Arrowverse, where he develops from a supporting engineer to a superhero. Vibe also makes lesser appearances in the animated series &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; and a self-titled &quot;DC Nation Shorts&quot; episode.

==Creation==
Co creator Chuck Patton discussed the characters creation stating, 

&quot;We threw ideas back and forth, but the most important one that stuck out for me was Gerry really wanted to tap into breakdancing, BIG TIME, lol. And all joking aside, he wasn’t wrong, the time was right, break dancing was all over the media, from music to movies and television. I wanted whomever we came up with to have a strong, urban ethnic, &quot;Down to Earth&quot; feel that would reflect my own background.

However, Gerry&#x27;s inspiration was definitely more &#x27;West Coast&#x27; oriented, so he, tapped into the spirit of the movie &quot;Electric Boogaloo&quot; and our first hero came from out of the gang element of &#x27;80s LA.

I went along to get along, because I really disliked that movie and was unsure about the West Side Story gang influence, lol. But I did like the potential, so I suggested that his powers would be from what all Angelenos feared most out here—earthquakes. We later changed them into super-vibrational waves he would project thru his dance moves, hence the name &#x27;Vibe&#x27;.&quot;

Vibe was one of the first US Latino superheroes, and possibly the first Mexican-American superhero (if the character is Mexican-American, which is implied but not made explicit). However, the character has been described as stereotypical, and the well-known comic artist George Pérez, a Puerto Rican, refused to draw him in his entirety.

==Publication history==
Vibe first appeared in &quot;Justice League of America Annual&quot; #2 (October 1984), and was created by Gerry Conway and Chuck Patton.

==Fictional character biography==
Cisco Ramon is a metahuman from Detroit with the ability to generate powerful vibratory shock waves and the leader of the street gang Los Lobos. He has two brothers, Armando and Dante, with the former possessing similar abilities. When he learns that a new Justice League is forming in Detroit, Cisco gives up his position to join them.

Vibe&#x27;s presence on the team causes Aquaman and the Martian Manhunter to harbor some strong doubts about the new JLA, particularly after he got the League involves in a battle with a rival gang. Vibe soon proves his mettle during the League&#x27;s battles against Cadre, Anton Allegro, and Amazo. He stays with the League through the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; crossover, when his powers play a vital role in defeating Despero.

During Darkseid&#x27;s assault on Earth in &quot;Legends&quot;, Vibe leaves the Justice League after it disbands and is killed by one of Professor Ivo&#x27;s androids.

In &quot;Trinity&quot;, Cisco is resurrected and rejoins the Justice League. Soon after Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman return, his head is disintegrated by an energy blast, killing him again.

In &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Vibe is temporarily resurrected as a member of the Black Lantern Corps before Doctor Light kills him.

===The New 52===
In DC&#x27;s Free Comic Book Day 2012 sample during &quot;The New 52&quot;, a gatefold revealed various characters who would make an appearance in &quot;Justice League&quot; over the coming year, one of which was Vibe. Geoff Johns revealed that Vibe&#x27;s return would be explored in greater detail in the third story arc of &quot;Justice League&quot;. On August 26, 2012, DC announced a new &quot;Justice League of America&quot; title which would feature Vibe. On November 5, 2012, DC announced that Vibe would star in his own ongoing monthly title. It was written by Andrew Kreisberg and drawn by Pete Woods and debuted in February 2013. In new continuity, Vibe&#x27;s powers derive from being &quot;caught in the event horizon of a Boom Tube&quot;, in which &quot;interdimensional forces rewrote his DNA&quot;. &quot;Justice League of America&#x27;s Vibe&quot; lasted for ten issues, with the final issue released on December 18, 2013.

==Powers and abilities==
As his name suggests, Vibe&#x27;s powers revolve around vibration, frequency, and resonance. His powers enable him to create shock waves of considerable strength that could shatter concrete or steel as well as affect the physical world as seismic vibrations (and even earth manipulation) or the fabric of spacetime (interdimensional, transdimensional and extradimensional portals).

Vibe&#x27;s reintroduction in 2013 redefined his powers as having to do with interdimensional physics. Vibe&#x27;s waves have the power to disrupt the Speed Force, making him one of the few characters who poses a serious threat to the Flash. For this reason, Steve Trevor recruits him into the JLA, which exists to guard against the threat of the main Justice League going rogue.

Amanda Waller says that &quot;Cisco Ramon might be one of the most powerful super-humans on the planet. He wields vibrational powers that could in theory shake the Earth apart. And he&#x27;s the only person we know of who can find and track inter-dimensional breaches.&quot; He is also undetectable by security cameras.

<doc id="865389" wikidata="Q1072857" url="?curid=865389" title="International Crisis Group">
<text>The International Crisis Group (ICG; also known as the Crisis Group) is a global non-profit, non-governmental organisation founded in 1995. It is a think tank, used by policymakers and academics, conducting research and analysis on global crises. ICG has described itself as &quot;working to prevent wars and shape policies that will build a more peaceful world&quot;.

ICG states that it provides early warning through its monthly &quot;CrisisWatch&quot; bulletin, a global conflict tracker designed to identify both risks of escalation and opportunities to advance peace. The organisation says that it produces detailed analysis and advice on specific policy issues that are affecting conflict or potential conflict situations; that it engages with policy-makers, regional organisations and other key actors to promote peaceful solutions to major conflicts; and that it offers new strategic and tactical thinking on intractable conflicts and crises.

The ICG has been characterized as &quot;liberal&quot;. Its permanent field presence forms the basis of the organisation&#x27;s methodology. It has regional programmers covering over 70 actual and potential conflicts in Africa, Asia, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa, and the United States. As of September 2023, Crisis Group has approximately 150 staff members from various backgrounds, including academia, civil society, diplomacy and media.
Since December 2021, Comfort Ero is the President and CEO of the organisation with Richard Atwood as Executive Vice President.

== History ==
George Soros provided the organisation&#x27;s seed funding and continues to support it. The first government representative to offer financial support was Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, in March 1994. That same year, Gareth Evans, as Foreign Minister of Australia, pledged $500,000. As private individuals, Ahtisaari later became Chairman of ICG, and Evans became CEO of ICG.

A January 1995 meeting in London brought many international figures together and approved a proposal for an annual budget of $8 million and 75 full-time staff. In mid-1995, the organisation was formally registered in the U.S. as a tax-exempt non-profit. From 1996 to 1999, Crisis Group had an annual budget of around $2 million and around 20 full-time staff; by 2017 its budget had risen to over $17 million. Crisis Group received funding under grants from governments, charitable foundations, private companies and individual donors. For the financial year ending June 30, 2019, it received 43% of its funding from governments, 31% from foundations, 22% from the private sector, 2% from in-kind contributions and 2% from investment income.

In a 2014 paper for &quot;Third World Quarterly&quot;, social researcher Berit Bliesemann de Guevara writes that ICG&#x27;s significant budget was a requirement of its activities, though small compared to government research agencies. She wrote that &quot;Critics have argued that it is not the amount but the sources of the ICG&#x27;s funding which have opened Western policymakers&#x27; doors to its advocacy, while at the same time (possibly) compromising the ICG&#x27;s political independence&quot;. She wrote that the ICG has &quot;contradict[ed] the idea of simple, straightforward connections between donors and reporting&quot; through the broad variety of its donors.

Robert Malley, who previously served in the Obama administration as a senior adviser, became president and CEO of ICG in January 2018. Malley had his ties to the Obama electoral campaign severed in May 2008, when it became public that Malley had been in discussions with the militant Palestinian group Hamas, listed by the U.S. State Department as a terrorist organisation. His predecessors in the position include former UN Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations Jean-Marie Guéhenno, former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada Louise Arbour, and former Foreign Minister of Australia Gareth Evans.

The Crisis Group, and in particular its Iran Project Director, Ali Vaez, played an important role in advancing the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).

== Organisation ==
=== Offices ===
Crisis Group is headquartered in Brussels, with advocacy offices in Washington DC, New York and London. Other legally registered offices are based in Bogota, Colombia; Dakar, Senegal; Istanbul, Turkey; and Nairobi, Kenya.

As of June 2018, Crisis Group has a presence in Abu Dhabi, Abuja, Bangkok, Beirut, Caracas, Gaza City, Guatemala City, Hong Kong, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Juba, Kabul, Kyiv, Mexico City, Mogadishu, Rabat, Tbilisi, Toronto, Tunis and Yangon.

=== Board of trustees ===

As of September 2023, Crisis Group Board of Trustees has 44 members. Frank Giustra, founder of the Giustra Foundation and Acceso, became co-chair in 2020, and Susana Malcorra, former Foreign Minister of Argentina and former Chef de Cabinet of the UN Secretary-General, joined him as co-chair in 2021.

Previously, the board was chaired by Mark Malloch Brown, former UN Deputy Secretary-General and Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme. Past board members have included Sandy Berger and Stephen Solarz. Chairmen emeritus are Martti Ahtisaari, George J. Mitchell and Thomas R. Pickering.

Gareth Evans remained President Emeritus as of 2023.

== Awards ==
Crisis Group&#x27;s &quot;In Pursuit of Peace Award” was established in 2005, and is associated with a gala event in New York City. Recipients include U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush, Hillary Clinton, former Brazilian President Lula da Silva, Nobel Peace Prize laureates Martti Ahtisaari and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and financier and philanthropist George Soros.

Recipients for 2018 included Frank Giustra, founder of the Radcliffe Foundation and a prolific entrepreneur and financier, and H.R.H. Prince Zeid Raad Al Hussein, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Olympic Refugee and Paralympic Teams.

== Research and critique about the organization ==
The Swedish ONG Transnational Foundation for Peace and Future Research alleged in 2005 that the ICG board of directors&#x27; had close ties to Western governments, a lack of independent scholars, and an absence of an objective standard theoretical framework.

In 2010, Tom Hazeldine argued in an article published in the &quot;New Left Review&quot; that the ICG &quot;styles itself as independent and non-partisan, but has consistently championed NATO&#x27;s wars to fulsome transatlantic praise&quot;. A 2007 piece in &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; described ICG as &quot;liberal&quot; and critical of Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez.

The ICG generated controversy in April 2013 as it awarded Myanmar President Thein Sein its &quot;In Pursuit of Peace Award&quot;, with the award ceremony coinciding with the publication of a Human Rights Watch report of ethnic cleansing by Sein&#x27;s administration.

In 2014, the journal &quot;Third World Quarterly&quot; published a special issue about the ICG and its role in knowledge production about conflict, featuring 10 separate critiques about the ICG, ranging from its influence on foreign-policy makers, &quot;manufacturing&quot; crises, and the methodologies it deploys in gathering its research. The ICG&#x27;s briefings and reports were described as having &quot;a generally good reputation&quot; among policymakers in the issue&#x27;s introduction, which also notes that while academics working on conflict often cite the ICG&#x27;s analysis, there is little academic research about the ICG itself.

The ICG was criticised in September 2016 for its 2011 report entitled &quot;The Syrian Regime&#x27;s Slow-motion Suicide&quot;, with Nicholas Noe arguing: &quot;Regrettably, ICG&#x27;s overconfidence in regime suicide not only encouraged the premature and disastrous rejection of diplomacy that has helped prolong the Syria war. It also essentially abdicated the main role for which peace, promotion, and conflict mitigation NGOs exist in the first place: Advocating for strong international engagement and negotiated solutions that regard the safety of civilian populations as paramount&quot;.

In 2023, several of ICG&#x27;s staff, including Ali Vaez, Iran Project Director, were connected to the Iran Experts Initiative.

<text>Edolphus &quot;Ed&quot; Towns Jr. (born July 21, 1934) is an American educator, military veteran, and politician who served in the United States House of Representatives from 1983 to 2013. A Democrat from New York, Towns was Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee from 2009 to 2011.

During his 30 years in Congress, Towns represented districts based in Brooklyn: first , from 1983 to 1993, and then the from 1993 to 2013.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Towns was born in Chadbourn, North Carolina, the son of Versie (née Brown) and Edolphus Towns. He graduated from West Side High School, Chadbourn, North Carolina in 1952. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in sociology from North Carolina A&amp;T State University in 1956 and a master&#x27;s degree in social work from Adelphi University in 1973. Towns is a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity.

Towns was an administrator at Beth Israel Medical Center, a professor at New York&#x27;s Medgar Evers College and Fordham University, and a public school teacher teaching orientation and mobility to blind students. In 1956, he joined the United States Army as a private and received basic combat training at Fort Hood, Texas with the 4th Armored Division. He served until 1958. He was also an ordained Baptist minister.

In 1970, he ran for New York Assembly District 38, and was defeated in the Democratic primary by John Mullally, 75%–25%. In 1972, he ran in District 40 and was defeated in the Democratic primary by Edward Griffith, who won the primary with a plurality of 37%.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
After redistricting, Towns ran for the open seat in the Brooklyn-based New York&#x27;s 11th congressional district. Towns won the Democratic primary with a plurality of 48%, and won the general election with 84% of the vote. He never won a general election campaign with less than 85% of the vote. He has won the Democratic primary with at least 60% of the vote all but three times (1998, 2000, and 2006).

From 1996 to 1998, Towns was in a rivalry with Brooklyn Democratic Party Chairman Clarence Norman. In addition, he has received criticism for endorsing Republican Rudy Giuliani for Mayor of New York City in 1997. He was challenged in the 1998 primaries by Barry D. Ford, a 35-year-old lawyer with the firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &amp; Hamilton and also faced a challenge from political activist Ken Diamondstone. Towns won the primary with 55% of the vote. In 2000, Ford ran for a rematch against Towns and lost 57%–43%.

In 2006, Towns faced Democratic primary challenges from Charles Barron, a member of the New York City Council, and Roger Green, a former member of the New York State Assembly. Barron was a staunch ally of Al Sharpton. Green was convicted of stealing $3,000 in taxpayer dollars. Towns defeated Barron and Green 47%–37%–15%, the worst primary performance of his career. In 2012, Towns endorsed Barron in the race for his Congressional seat, but Barron was routed by a 72–28% margin and the seat went to Hakeem Jeffries.

Kevin Powell, a hip hop activist, writer, and former cast member on the MTV Reality TV show &quot;The Real World&quot;, opted out of challenging Towns for the 2006 Democratic nomination, challenging him in 2008 instead. Powell criticized Towns for supporting Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama in the Democratic presidential primaries. Towns defeated Powell 69%–31%.

===Tenure===
Towns served on the Energy and Commerce Committee and is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. On January 7, 2009, his proposed legislation to require information on Presidential donors kicked off the new session of the 111th Congress. Towns&#x27; past accomplishments include, co-sponsoring or enacting several pieces of federal legislation, including the Student Right To Know Act, which mandated the reporting of the rate of graduation among student athletes, creating the Telecommunications Development Fund, which provides capital for minority business initiatives, and the development of a federal program for poison control centers.

He had been targeted by various Democratic Party constituencies, including factions led by his political rival Al Sharpton, and national and local labor unions, who resent his support for passage of the Central American Free Trade Agreement, which passed the House of Representatives by a razor-thin margin. In addition, he has been heavily criticized for taking money from telecom PACs and opposing net neutrality. 

He put particular emphasis on arguing in behalf of underserved Brooklyn communities, and has won recognition from several organizations for his efforts. The National Audubon Society has honored him for his efforts in fighting to secure federal funds for the restoration of Prospect Park. Towns fought to have Environmental Protection Agency testing in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, including neighborhoods outside of the borough of Manhattan. 
Towns delayed the investigation into Countrywide Financial&#x27;s VIP loan program when he was the House oversight panel&#x27;s chairman by refusing to issue a subpoena for Bank of America records. After &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that public loan documents indicated Towns had received two mortgages from the VIP program, he issued the subpoena and his office denied wrongdoing.

In December 2010, he announced that he would not seek the position of Ranking Minority Member of the Oversight Committee in the next Congress, even though his seniority and service as Chair would typically result in him filling this post. Towns reportedly withdrew due to lack of support from Nancy Pelosi, who reportedly feared Towns would not be a sufficiently aggressive leader in an anticipated struggle with incoming committee chair Darrell Issa (R-CA). Towns&#x27;s successor is Elijah Cummings, who defeated Carolyn Maloney in a vote of the House Democratic Caucus.

On April 16, 2012, Towns announced he would be retiring at the end of his 15th term. His district had been renumbered as the 8th district in redistricting and had a significant increase of white voters, though it still had a large black majority.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Energy and Commerce
** Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade
** Subcommittee on Communications and Technology
** Subcommittee on Health
* Committee on Oversight and Government Reform
** Subcommittee on Government Organization, Efficiency and Financial Management (Ranking Member)

===Caucus memberships===
* Congressional Black Caucus
* House Democratic Caucus
* Congressional COPD Caucus
* International Conservation Caucus
* Congressional Arts Caucus

== Later career ==
After leaving Congress, Towns became a senior advisor for the government relations and lobbying firm Gray Global Advisors.

==Personal life==
Towns is married to the former Gwendolyn Forbes and they reside in the Cypress Hills section of Brooklyn. They have two children, Darryl (who had served in the New York State Assembly but vacated his seat to become commissioner and chief executive of New York State Homes and Community Renewal agency when appointed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo) and Deidra, who ran in special election to replace her brother, on a self-created ticket, Community First. 

He is a distant cousin of White House correspondent April Ryan.

<text>Carl Culmann (10 July 1821 – 9 December 1881) was a German structural engineer.

Born in Bad Bergzabern, Rhenish Palatinate, in modern-day Germany, Culmann&#x27;s father, a pastor, tutored him at home before enrolling him at the military engineering school at Metz to prepare for entry to the École Polytechnique. Culmann&#x27;s ambitions were frustrated by an attack of typhoid and, after a long convalescence, he attended the Karlsruhe Polytechnic School. He joined the Bavarian civil service in 1841 as an apprentice engineer in the design of railroad bridges.

Continuing his mathematical studies, in particular under L. C. Schnürlein, in 1847 Culmann transferred to Munich so that he could improve his English in anticipation of a study tour to the United Kingdom and the United States. His tour lasted from 1849 to 1851, studying the comparative designs of truss bridges and developing new analytical techniques to facilitate his investigations.

In 1855, he took up the chair of engineering sciences at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, holding the post until his death.

Inspired by the work of Jean-Victor Poncelet, Culmann was a pioneer of graphical methods in engineering (&quot;graphic statics&quot;), publishing his seminal book on the topic, &quot;Die graphische Statik&quot; in 1865. A French language translation was prepared in 1879.

Culmann had a profound influence on a generation of engineers including Maurice Koechlin, Otto Mohr and Luigi Cremona. He died in Zurich, Switzerland.

<text>Edward Hull &quot;Boss&quot; Crump Jr. (October 2, 1874 – October 16, 1954) was an American politician from Memphis, Tennessee. Representing the Democratic Party, he was the dominant force in the city&#x27;s politics for most of the first half of the 20th century, during which the city had a commission form of government. He also usually dominated Tennessee politics from the 1920s to the 1940s. He was elected and served as mayor of Memphis from 1910 to 1915 and again briefly in 1940. However, he effectively appointed every mayor who was elected from 1915 to 1954.

==Career==
A native of Holly Springs in northern Mississippi, 19-year-old Crump moved to Memphis, Tennessee, on September 21, 1893, according to the &quot;Holly Springs Reporter&quot;. When he first arrived in Memphis, the ongoing Panic of 1893, possibly the worst recession in the United States to that time, made it hard for Crump to find work. Eventually, he obtained a clerical position with the Walter Goodman Cotton Company, on Front Street in downtown Memphis. This was the start of his successful business career as a broker and trader.

Early in 1901, Crump began seriously courting 23-year-old Bessie Byrd McLean. Bessie (or Betty) McLean, the only child of Mr. and Mrs. Robert McLean (Mr. McLean was then the vice president of the William R. Moore Dry Goods Company), was a prominent Memphis socialite and considered &quot;one of the city&#x27;s most beautiful and most sought after women.&quot; Crump and McLean were married on January 22, 1902 at the Calvary Episcopal Church.

==Politics==
Alongside his rising business career, Crump began to make the political connections that served him for the rest of his life. He was a delegate to the Tennessee Democratic State Convention in 1902 and 1904. In 1905, he was named to the municipal Board of Public Works, and was elected to the powerful position of Commissioner of Fire and Police in 1907, among three commissioners who governed the city.
Starting in the 1910s, Crump began to build a political machine which came to have statewide influence. He was particularly adept in his use of what were at the time two politically weak minority groups in Tennessee: Blacks and Republicans. Unlike most Southern Democrats of his era, Crump was not opposed to Blacks voting. Memphis Blacks were reliable Crump machine voters for the most part. The party often paid the poll taxes required by state law since the late 1880s; otherwise this requirement resulted in disenfranchising many poor Black people. One of Crump&#x27;s lieutenants in the Black community was funeral director N. J. Ford, whose family (in the persons of several sons, including Harold Sr. and John Ford, daughter Ophelia, and grandson Harold, Jr.) became influential in Memphis, state and national politics, continuing to be so today. A relationship developed in which Black people aided Crump, and he aided them, as was usual in politics. Crump also skillfully manipulated Republicans, who were numerically very weak in the western two-thirds of the state due to the disenfranchisement of the Black population, but dominated politics in East Tennessee. Frequently, they found it necessary to align with Crump in order to accomplish any of their goals in the state government.

Crump was influential for nearly half a century. He usually preferred to work behind the scenes and served only three two-year terms as mayor of Memphis (1910–1915) at the beginning of his career. He essentially named the next several mayors. His rise to prominence disturbed many of the state political leaders in Nashville. The &quot;Ouster Law&quot;, designed to remove officials who refused to enforce state laws, was passed primarily with Crump and his lax enforcement of state Prohibition in mind. He was county treasurer of Shelby County from 1917 to 1923. He was elected seven times as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention.

Crump became involved in earnest in state politics during the 1928 gubernatorial election when Henry Horton was seeking election in his own right. Horton had earlier been speaker of the state senate and succeeded to the position of governor when Austin Peay died in office. Crump supported Hill McAlister in the Democratic primary, while the Nashville machine of Luke Lea supported Governor Horton. Horton won the primary despite the strong vote for McAlister in populous Shelby County. When Horton ran for reelection in 1930, Crump and Lea cut a deal, and Crump swung his formidable political machine behind Horton. Horton defeated independent Democrat L. E. Gwinn in the primary and Republican C. Arthur Bruce in the general election.

After years of working behind the scenes, Crump decided to run for U.S. Representative in 1930. He was easily elected to the Tenth District, which was then co-extensive with Shelby County (it became the Ninth in 1932). He served two terms: from March 4, 1931, to January 3, 1935. (The Twentieth Amendment was enacted in 1933, shifting the starting date of Congressional terms.) During this time, he was also a regent of the Smithsonian Institution. He remained hugely influential in Memphis as well. He was in constant communication with his operatives there and visited during each congressional recess.

In 1936, Crump was named to the Democratic National Committee, serving on that body until 1945. In 1939, he was elected a final time as mayor, although that term was officially served by Walter Chandler. Chandler was U.S. Representative for the Ninth District, and Crump thought that Chandler&#x27;s time was better spent tending to congressional matters in Washington than campaigning for mayor in Memphis. So, without a platform, without a speech, and without opposition, Crump was elected mayor of Memphis.

Crump was sworn in at a few minutes past midnight on January 1, 1940, in a snowstorm on the platform of the railroad station, just before leaving for New Orleans to attend the Sugar Bowl football game. In high humor, he resigned immediately. Vice Mayor Joseph Boyle became Mayor until the next day, when the faithful City Commission met and elected Chandler. Watkins Overton&#x27;s term had ended at midnight, and thus Memphis had four mayors in less than twenty-four hours.

In 1940, Crump initiated a campaign of political persecution against J. B. Martin, a founder of the Memphis Red Sox and the head of the Negro American League. Martin, a longtime Republican Party activist, had become chair of the Shelby County Republican Party in October. After he staged a rally for Republican Wendell Willkie later than month, Crump ordered officers to &quot;police&quot; or search all patrons of Martin&#x27;s South Memphis Drugstore, including children. Because Crump threatened a possible term for him in prison workhouse on trumped up charges, Martin left the city. Republican leaders and civil rights organizations, such as the NAACP, urged the Roosevelt administration to bring charges against, or denounce, Crump, who benefited from a close alliance with President Roosevelt, but had no success. Although the head of the Civil Rights Section of the Department of Justice indicated a willingness to prosecute Crump for violation of Martin&#x27;s civil rights, more senior officials in the Roosevelt administration refused to do so. When Martin briefly returned to Memphis in 1943 to attend a game at the Martin Stadium (which he had helped to build), police arrested him, put him in a holding cell, and ordered to leave Memphis. By this time, Martin had settled permanently in Chicago.

Less than a month after this incident, Martin and Robert Church Jr., another Black Republican leader who had also been driven out of the city by Crump, successfully urged labor leader A. Philip Randolph to come to Memphis to speak out against Crump&#x27;s suppression of free speech. Crump&#x27;s subordinates responded by denying Randolph speaking venues by intimidating local Black leaders into withdrawing invitations and shunning him. When Randolph urged Eleanor Roosevelt, who had friendly political ties with Crump, to do something to counter Crump&#x27;s &quot;fascist&quot; denial of free speech, she refused. Her reply on December 18, 1943 to Randolph read in full: &quot;I referred your letter to a friend of mine when I received it and I am sorry it has not been answered before. I was advised not to do anything, as it might do more harm than good.&quot;

Crump&#x27;s statewide influence began to wane in the late 1940s. Edward J. Meeman, editor of the &quot;Memphis Press-Scimitar&quot;, opposed Crump&#x27;s initiatives and called for a city manager government and abolition of the poll tax to weaken the power of the machine. He also worked to unseat U. S. Senator Tom Stewart, whom Crump supported in the 1948 Democratic primary against his intra-party challenger, U.S. Representative Estes Kefauver. Gordon Browning, a one-time protégé whom Crump had helped elect governor in 1936, was elected governor again in 1948, this time over Crump&#x27;s opposition. For the rest of his life, Crump&#x27;s influence was largely limited to Memphis. In 1952, his longtime associate, Senator Kenneth McKellar, was defeated in the Democratic primary — in those days with a practically powerless state Republican party, the real contest in Tennessee — by Congressman Albert Gore, Sr. A final triumph for Crump was the victory in 1952 of his chosen candidate, Frank G. Clement in the gubernatorial primary over Browning.

Crump died less than two years later. He is interred at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis.

==Political machine==
From the 1910s to the 1950s, Memphis was a locus of machine politics under the direction of &quot;Boss&quot; Crump, a Democrat. He obtained a state law in 1911 to establish a small commission to manage the city. The city retained a form of commission government until 1967, but Crump was in full control at all times. He used all of the familiar techniques of the big city boss: ballot manipulation, patronage for friends, and frustrating bureaucratic obstacles for the opposition. Crump built a complex alliance with established power figures at the local, state, and national levels. He ensured that dissidents had little or no voice.

At the center of his network was &quot;Cotton Row,&quot; the business elite that dominated the cotton industry. Secondly, he included the modernizers: business-oriented progressives who were most concerned with upgrading the city&#x27;s waterfront, parks, highways, and skyscrapers, as well as a moderately good school system. Working-class whites got their share of jobs, but labor unions had marginal influence.

Roger Biles argues that the political system was virtually unchanged from 1910 into the 1950s and 1960s, thanks to Crump&#x27;s wire-pulling. Crump was the leading Tennessee supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal. In return, the city received ample relief programs, which provided jobs for the unemployed, as selected by machine lieutenants. The city also got major federal building projects, which helped to fund the business community. Crump incorporated hand-picked black leaders of proven loyalty to the machine in his outer circle by dispensing patronage in return for the black vote. Memphis was one of the largest southern cities in which blacks could vote, although segregation was as rigid as elsewhere in the South. The amounts which African Americans received from Crump&#x27;s largess, however, were comparatively minuscule. Of the more than $300,000 spent on Memphis parks in 1937, for example, only $3,000 went to African Americans though they were forty percent of Memphis&#x27;s population.

==Legacy==
*Crump was a strong supporter of fire service and for many years the Memphis Fire Department was considered one of the best in the country; it still has a high reputation. 
*He believed that separate operations for each municipal utility were inherently inefficient and combined them; in the early 21st century, Memphis Light, Gas and Water is one of the largest combined municipal utilities in the United States.
*Crump thought that cities should not be too noisy; Memphis has strong noise ordinances that are more aggressively enforced than those of many other jurisdictions. 
*He was an early supporter of requiring automobile safety inspections; all of Memphis-registered vehicles were inspected annually (twice a year until the 1990s), until June 28, 2013, when all city inspections ceased after a de-funding of the department by the Memphis City Council. 
*The city&#x27;s Crump Stadium, E. H. Crump Memorial Hospital, and Crump Boulevard are named after him. He also chaired the joint Memphis-Arkansas commission that oversaw the construction of the Memphis &amp; Arkansas Bridge, originally (1949) at the end of Crump Boulevard but now part of Interstate 55.
*The lyrics to &quot;The Memphis Blues&quot; by composer and bandleader W. C. Handy mention &quot;Mr. Crump.&quot; The song was published in 1912, but may have originated during Crump&#x27;s 1909 mayoral campaign.
*The lyrics to &quot;Motel in Memphis&quot; by Old Crow Medicine Show also mention &quot;Mr. Crump&quot; and his involvement in the political machine that shaped the city.
*Crump appointed Lloyd Binford to be head of the Memphis Censor Board which governed approval and editing of movies, a position he maintained with Crump&#x27;s support from 1928–1955. Binford imposed harsh and erratic censorship during his era, leading Memphis to have a different selection of movies available than any other part of America. Among Binford&#x27;s objections included movies with train robberies, movies that showed blacks and whites together at any time, movies that included actors of whom he disapproved, and other quibbles. Theaters in nearby towns would advertise that their movies were &quot;banned in Memphis&quot;.
*One of Crump&#x27;s Memphis society friends was Georgia Tann, who served as head of the Tennessee Children&#x27;s Home Society. Historians generally believe that Crump saw Tann as most other respectable residents did - as a hard-working, dedicated social worker worthy of support and protection - but in reality, Tann performed unethical black market adoptions for fees, acquired many adoptees via misrepresentation and trickery to their birth parents, and let difficult-to-place orphans and wards simply die of malnutrition, conduct considered scandalous even for the era had it been more widely known.

<doc id="865403" wikidata="Q4834859" url="?curid=865403" title="BBC Studios Natural History Unit">
<text>The BBC Studios Natural History Unit (NHU) is a department of BBC Studios that produces television, radio and online content with a natural history or wildlife theme. It is best known for its highly regarded nature documentaries, including &quot;The Blue Planet&quot; and &quot;Planet Earth&quot;, and has a long association with David Attenborough&#x27;s authored documentaries, starting with 1979&#x27;s &quot;Life on Earth&quot;.

The Natural History Unit is a specialist department within BBC Studios Productions. Each year it produces around 100 hours of television and 50 hours of radio programmes, making it the largest wildlife documentary production house in the world. The BBC commissions programmes from the Unit for broadcast on five terrestrial television channels (BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Four, CBBC and CBeebies) and BBC Radio 4. It also makes programmes for other broadcasters and services including Apple TV+, Warner Bros. Discovery, National Geographic Global Networks and NBC Universal. Content is marketed internationally under the BBC Earth brand. Original content is also broadcast on the &quot;Earth Unplugged&quot; YouTube channel.

The Unit has been based in Broadcasting House, Bristol since its formation in 1957, and has been headed by Jonny Keeling since 2021.

==History==
===First steps in natural history broadcasting===
The BBC natural history unit&#x27;s links to Bristol date back to the 1940s, when Desmond Hawkins, then a young producer, joined the West Region staff. His personal interest in the subject led to a radio series called &quot;The Naturalist&quot;, which began on the Home Service in 1946 and proved an immediate success, later augmented by &quot;Out of Doors&quot; and &quot;Birds in Britain&quot;.

By the early 1950s, Hawkins had been promoted to Head of Programmes, West Region and was keen to translate his success to the developing medium of television. At the time, radio still commanded much higher audiences than the fledgling television service, but Hawkins was not alone in recognising the potential for natural history programmes for the newer medium. His vision was shared by Frank Gillard, the regional Head, and the two men would become the driving force behind the establishment of the Natural History Unit (NHU) in Bristol.

Until such formalities were completed, natural history programmes were the responsibility of the Features office of the West Region. One of the first programmes was an outside broadcast from the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust&#x27;s centre at Slimbridge in 1953, the first TV collaboration between the BBC and Peter Scott. Occasional programmes continued the following year, but it was not until 1955 that the BBC began a regular studio-based series, &quot;Look&quot;, presented by Scott.

One of the early problems for the Unit was the difficulty in sourcing film stock. At the time, the only wildlife cameramen were amateurs, and the footage wasn&#x27;t always good enough for broadcast. The embryo unit&#x27;s first film camera, a clockwork Bolex, was bought from a Bristol camera shop with petty cash by Desmond&#x27;s assistant, Tony Soper. Some of Scott&#x27;s own expedition films were used for early episodes of &quot;Look&quot;. One particularly outstanding film from 1955, shot by Heinz Sielmann, showed woodpeckers inside a nest hole.

===Unit formation===

By 1957, with &quot;Look&quot; firmly established and Gillard and Hawkins lobbying hard, the BBC management in London approved the official formation of a Natural History Unit. Gillard was on the search for a senior producer to head the new Unit, and asked David Attenborough to take on the role. Attenborough had good credentials (he was a trained zoologist) but declined, having recently settled in London with his young family. Instead, he was placed in charge of the newly formed Travel and Exploration Unit, striking a deal which would allow him to continue to film his popular &quot;Zoo Quest&quot; (1954–1963) series alongside natural history output from the fledgling Bristol unit. The Travel and Exploration Unit in London also introduced viewers to more exotic wildlife, and made household names of the first natural history presenters. Armand and Michaela Denis filmed East African wildlife for their &quot;On Safari&quot; programmes, whilst another pioneering husband-and-wife team, Hans and Lotte Hass, created some of the first underwater films.

Nicholas Crocker, a senior producer with West Region, became the Unit&#x27;s first Head in September 1957. Founder members included Tony Soper (producer) and Christopher Parsons (assistant film editor), both of whom would go on to play a major part in the Unit&#x27;s development.

Although much of the Unit&#x27;s early output concentrated on British and European wildlife, one of its first productions to be broadcast was &quot;Faraway Look&quot; featuring Peter Scott in Australia. The early programmes were limited by the available technology, but it was also a time of great experimentation in style and content, bringing the Unit notable success. &quot;Animal Magic&quot; (1962–1983), presented by Johnny Morris and Tony Soper, was a successful format for young audiences which ran for over 20 years. The Unit also collaborated with Gerald Durrell on several films of his animal-collecting expeditions, beginning with the studio-based series &quot;To Bafut for Beef&quot; (April 1958), using African footage shot by Durrell.

===Colour television arrives===
In the early 1960s, natural history filmmaking was being held back by the limitations of the available technology, particularly the restrictions of shooting often fast-moving subjects in poor light and spectacularly colourful subjects in black and white. The second of these problems was about to be resolved.

Around the same time, the technology to broadcast and receive colour television was being developed, and the BBC made funds available to begin filming in colour to allow filmmakers to experiment with the latest equipment in preparation for the switchover. &quot;The Major&quot; (1963), produced by Parsons and filmed largely by New Forest cameraman Eric Ashby, told the story of an ancient English oak and was the Unit&#x27;s first colour production. This was one of six films made for the BBC by part-time film-makers Ron Peggs and Leslie Jackman. Leslie filmed the insect sequences at his home in Paignton using specimens collected by John Burton.

Colour transmission finally arrived in 1967 on BBC 2 under the stewardship of David Attenborough, who had retired from programme-making to move into BBC administration. The first natural history film to be shown in colour was Ron Eastman&#x27;s &quot;The Private Life of the Kingfisher&quot; (1968), written and produced by Jeffery Boswall.

Attenborough, by then controller of BBC 2, wanted to make a strong statement on BBC&#x27;s second channel of the boundless possibilities that colour television offered, and recognised that natural history was the obvious subject matter to choose. He commissioned a series called &quot;The World About Us&quot; (1969–1982) that would broadcast in a 50-minute Sunday evening slot. Because of the challenge of producing enough colour material, the commission was shared between the NHU and London&#x27;s Travel and Exploration Unit. The extended opportunities offered by the 50-minute format and improvements in film technology and expertise finally allowed the NHU to begin showcasing its talent.

===Birth of the &#x27;personal view&#x27; series===
One of Attenborough&#x27;s main achievements as Controller of BBC 2 was to commission &quot;&quot; (1969), a major series presented by the respected art historian Kenneth Clark. It was a resounding success with critics and the public, pioneering the &#x27;personal view&#x27; form of documentary films for television. Parsons, by then an experienced producer with the NHU, recognised the potential for a similar treatment with natural history as the subject and approached Attenborough in 1970 with the idea. Attenborough was receptive, even to the idea that he should present the series, but both men realised at that time that it was beyond the scope of the Unit&#x27;s capabilities.

When Attenborough resigned from his administrative duties to return to programme making at the start of 1973, planning for the proposed series resumed. It was another three years before the resourcing and financing were agreed, the outline episode scripts written (by Attenborough) and a production team in place. Parsons would serve as series producer and share production duties for the individual episodes with Richard Brock and John Sparks. Filming took place in 39 countries, featured over 650 different species and involved over 1 million miles of travel. Attenborough himself has said that if it had not been for computerised airline schedules, the series would have probably been impossible to undertake. When it was finally broadcast in 1979 on BBC 1, &quot;Life on Earth&quot; drew an audience of 15 million people in the UK and was eventually seen by an estimated 500 million people worldwide.

===Building on success===

The Natural History Unit made its name with &quot;Life on Earth&quot;, and was rewarded by being awarded departmental status by BBC management in December 1979. Christopher Parsons, by then its most experienced producer, became the first official Head of the Unit. It celebrated its silver jubilee in 1982 with the miniseries &quot;Flight of the Condor&quot;, and sealed its reputation as one of the foremost production companies for popular natural history films in the following decades. A succession of series have followed the format established by &quot;Life on Earth&quot;, often presented or narrated by Attenborough, and transmitted on the BBC&#x27;s main channel. &quot;The Blue Planet&quot; (2001) and &quot;Planet Earth&quot; (2006) typify these signature programmes, characterised by high production values, specially-commissioned musical scores and often ground-breaking footage of wildlife from around the globe.

The NHU has also diversified into other programme formats. Its &quot;Diary&quot; series have featured African big cats, elephants, orang-utans and bears in a nightly wildlife soap opera. Among of the longest-running programmes has been &quot;Wildlife on One&quot; (1977–2005) which was broadcast in a regular evening slot.

The &quot;Continents&quot; strand on BBC Two has featured series on all the world&#x27;s major land areas over the past eighteen years, including &quot;Spirits of the Jaguar&quot; (1996), &quot;Land of the Tiger&quot; (1997), &quot;Andes to Amazon&quot; (2000) and &quot;Wild Down Under&quot; (2003). Also on BBC Two, the annual &quot;Springwatch&quot; (since 2005) and &quot;Autumnwatch&quot; (since 2006) series have brought live pictures of British wildlife into millions of homes.

===50 years of wildlife film making===
In 2007, the Unit celebrated its 50th anniversary and was rewarded with a special award at the International Broadcasting Convention in recognition of its unique contribution to wildlife film and documentary making.

On television, the anniversary was marked with the broadcast of &quot;Saving Planet Earth&quot;, a conservation-themed series which helped to raise over £1.5 million for the BBC Wildlife Fund.

In October 2007, the BBC announced that the NHU would suffer cuts of a third in both staff numbers and its £37 million annual budget, as a result of the Government&#x27;s decision to impose a lower than inflation increase in the television licence fee. The cutbacks were widely condemned within the media industry and by programme-makers, including David Attenborough.

In response to the criticism, Keith Scholey, Factual Controller of BBC Vision, promised that the BBC would &quot;continue to make and show the ambitious, large-scale, truly memorable series that audiences associate with BBC natural history output&quot;. Titles affected by the cuts include the BBC Two &quot;Wild&quot; strand.

Productions already underway were not affected by the cuts, so the following year came &quot;Wild China&quot;, &quot;Pacific Abyss&quot;, &quot;Lost Land of the Jaguar&quot; and &quot;Big Cat Live&quot;, as well as the Unit&#x27;s most ambitious radio event to date, &quot;World on the Move&quot;. &quot;Natural World&quot; also received a three-year commission from BBC Two on its 25th anniversary.

===Modern era===
Post 2010, a greater emphasis was placed on climate change, which several special programmes broadcast focusing on the issue. More broadly, series looked at the negative effects of climate change and habitat destruction within series that did not focus solely on the topic.

In 2016, BBC&#x27;s non-news content production, including natural history, was separated into a commercial subsidiary BBC Studios. NHU head Wendy Darke departed and was succeeded by Julian Hector.

== Awards and recognition ==
The Natural History Unit as a whole was awarded the Gold Medal at the 2001 Royal Television Society awards for its &quot;outstanding contribution over the past 44 years to broadcasting about the natural world&quot;. It was praised for being &quot;a national resource for people&#x27;s understanding and love of wildlife on our planet, and a symbol of both quality and talent in public service broadcasting&quot;.

NHU filmmakers are regularly nominated and rewarded at film festivals such as Wildscreen, the Missoula International Wildlife Film Festival and the Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival and their output has been recognised by the wider broadcasting industry too, winning four Emmys, eleven BAFTAs, and the Prix Italia on three occasions. 

Recognition has also come in the form of high audience viewing figures and audience approval ratings, particularly for &#x27;blue-chip&#x27; series such as &quot;Planet Earth&quot;. When first screened in the UK it was watched by more than 8 million people. In 2008, episodes of &quot;Life in Cold Blood&quot; and the &quot;Wildlife Special&quot; miniseries &quot;&quot; both reportedly achieved the highest-ever audience appreciation index (AI) rating for a factual programme.

== New customers and audiences ==

<doc id="865416" wikidata="Q1249333" url="?curid=865416" title="The Quatermass Experiment">
<text>The Quatermass Experiment is a British science fiction serial broadcast by BBC Television during the summer of 1953 and re-staged by BBC Four in 2005. Set in the near future against the background of a British space programme, it tells the story of the first crewed flight into space, supervised by Professor Bernard Quatermass of the British Experimental Rocket Group.

When the spaceship that carries the first successful crew returns to Earth, two of the three astronauts are missing, and the third – Victor Carroon – is behaving strangely. It eventually becomes apparent that an alien presence entered the rocket during its flight, and Quatermass and his associates must prevent the alien from destroying the world.

Originally comprising six half-hour episodes, it was the first science fiction production to be written especially for a British adult television audience. The serial was the first of four &quot;Quatermass&quot; productions to be screened on British television between 1953 and 1979. It was transmitted live from the BBC&#x27;s original television studios at Alexandra Palace in north London, one of the final productions before BBC television drama moved to west London.

Despite its success and influence, only two episodes have survived, the other four having never even been recorded on their live broadcast. As well as spawning various remakes and sequels, &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; inspired much of the television science fiction that succeeded it, particularly in the United Kingdom, where it influenced successful series such as &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Sapphire and Steel&quot;. It also influenced successful Hollywood films such as &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Alien&quot;.

==Plot==
Along with his laboratory assistants, Professor Bernard Quatermass anxiously awaits the return to Earth of his new rocketship and its crew, who have become the first humans to travel into space. The rocket is at first thought to be lost, having dramatically overshot its planned orbit, but eventually it is detected by radar and returns to Earth, crash-landing in Wimbledon, London.

When Quatermass and his team reach the crash area and succeed in opening the rocket, they discover that only one of the three crewmen, Victor Carroon, remains inside. Quatermass and his chief assistant Paterson (Hugh Kelly) investigate the rocket&#x27;s interior and are baffled by what they find: the space suits of the others are present, and the instruments on board indicate that the door was never opened in flight, but there is no sign of the other two crewmen.

Carroon, gravely ill, is cared for by the Rocket Group&#x27;s doctor, Briscoe (John Glen), who has been having a secret affair with Carroon&#x27;s wife, Judith (Isabel Dean). It is not just Quatermass who is interested in what happened to Carroon and his crewmates; journalists such as James Fullalove (Paul Whitsun-Jones) and Scotland Yard&#x27;s Inspector Lomax (Ian Colin) are also keen to hear his story. Carroon is abducted by a group of local gangsters hoping to ransom him back to British Rocket Group but swiftly kills them and escapes. It is clear that there is something critically wrong: Carroon appears to have absorbed the consciousness and physical bodies of the other two crew members and is slowly mutating into a plant-like alien organism.

As the police chase the rapidly transforming Carroon across London, Quatermass analyses samples of the mutated creature in a laboratory and realises that if allowed to spore, the alien will eventually consume all life on Earth. A television crew working on an architectural programme locates the creature in Westminster Abbey, and Quatermass and British Army troops rush in to destroy it in the hour just before it will bring about doomsday. Quatermass discovers that the alien has become too strong to be killed by the Army&#x27;s weapons and persuades the three human minds within it to reclaim their humanity and destroy it from within. Thus, the alien is finally destroyed.

==Cast and crew==
Following the success of &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;, Nigel Kneale became one of the best-regarded screenwriters in the history of British television. In addition to the various &quot;Quatermass&quot; spin-offs and sequels, he wrote acclaimed productions such as &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1954) and &quot;The Stone Tape&quot; (1972). A tribute article by writer and admirer Mark Gatiss, published on the BBC News Online website shortly after Kneale&#x27;s death in 2006, praised his contribution to British television history: &quot;He is amongst the greats—he is absolutely as important as Dennis Potter, as David Mercer, as Alan Bleasdale, as Alan Bennett&quot;.

Kneale&#x27;s actions were represented on screen in the final episode of &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;. He manipulated the monster seen in Westminster Abbey at the climax, with his hands stuck through a photographic blow-up of the interior of the Abbey. The monster actually consisted of gloves covered in various plant and other materials, prepared by Kneale and his girlfriend (and future wife) Judith Kerr. The couple kept the gloves as a memento, and still owned them fifty years later, when Kneale wore them again in a television documentary about his career.

Rudolph Cartier had emigrated from Germany in the 1930s to escape its Nazi regime, and joined the staff of the BBC the year before &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; was made. He collaborated with Kneale on several further productions, and became a major figure in the British television industry. He directed important productions such as Kneale&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; adaptation, the two further BBC &quot;Quatermass&quot; serials, and one-off plays such as &quot;Cross of Iron&quot; (1961) and &quot;Lee Oswald: Assassin&quot; (1966). His 1994 obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; praised his contribution to 1950s television drama: &quot;At a time when studio productions were usually as static as the conventional theatre, he was widely respected for a creative contribution to British television drama which gave it a new dimension&quot;. The same piece also named &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; as a high point in his career, calling the serial &quot;a landmark in British television drama as much for its visual imagination as for its ability to shock and disturb&quot;.

Quatermass was played by the experienced Reginald Tate, who had appeared in various films, including &quot;The Way Ahead&quot; (1944). He died two years later, while preparing to take the role of the Professor again in &quot;Quatermass II&quot;. Tate was the second choice for the part; Cartier had previously offered it to André Morell, who declined the role. Morell did later play Quatermass in the third instalment of the series, &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;. Victor Carroon was played by Scottish actor Duncan Lamont, who later appeared in the film &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1962), and as a different character in the film adaptation of &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; (1967). He enjoyed working on &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; so much that, although he was not required for the final episode, he went to Alexandra Palace to lend moral support. While there, he helped Kneale and Kerr to prepare their &#x27;monster&#x27; prop.

Appearing in a small role as a drunk was Wilfrid Brambell, who later appeared as a tramp in &quot;Quatermass II&quot;. Brambell, who also appeared in Cartier and Kneale&#x27;s production of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, later became widely known for his roles in the sitcom &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; (1962–74) and the film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (1964). The 74-year-old actress Katie Johnson played a supporting part; she later became well known and won a British Film Award for her role as the landlady Mrs. Louisa Wilberforce in the film &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; (1955).

==Episodes==
==Production==
The serial was written by BBC television drama writer Nigel Kneale, who had been an actor and an award-winning fiction writer before joining the BBC. The BBC&#x27;s Head of Television Drama, Michael Barry, had committed most of his original script budget for the year to employing Kneale. An interest in science, particularly the idea of &#x27;science going bad&#x27;, led Kneale to write &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;. The project originated when a gap formed in the BBC&#x27;s schedules for a six-week serial to run on Saturday nights during the summer of 1953, and Kneale&#x27;s idea was to fill it with &quot;a mystifying, rather than horrific&quot; storyline.

Rudolph Cartier, one of the BBC&#x27;s best-regarded directors, directed the serial. He and Kneale had collaborated on the play &quot;Arrow to the Heart&quot;, and worked closely on the initial storyline to make it suit the television production methods of the time. Kneale claimed to have picked his leading character&#x27;s unusual last name at random from a London telephone directory. He chose the character&#x27;s first name, Bernard, in honour of astronomer Bernard Lovell. The working titles for the production were &quot;The Unbegotten&quot; and &quot;Bring Something Back...!&quot;, the latter a line of dialogue spoken in the second episode. Kneale had not finished scripting the serial&#x27;s final two episodes before the first episode was broadcast. The production had an overall budget of just under £4000. The theme music used was the BBC Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s 1945 recording of &quot;Mars, Bringer of War&quot; from Gustav Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot;, conducted by Adrian Boult.

Each episode was rehearsed from Monday to Friday at the Student Movement House on Gower Street in London, with camera rehearsals taking place all day on Saturday before transmission. The episodes were then transmitted live—with a few pre-filmed 35mm film inserts shot before and during the rehearsal period—from Studio A of the BBC&#x27;s original television studios at Alexandra Palace in London. It was one of the last major dramas to be broadcast from the Palace, as the majority of television production was soon to transfer to Lime Grove Studios, and it was made using the BBC&#x27;s oldest television cameras, the Emitrons, installed with the opening of the Alexandra Palace studios in 1936. These cameras gave a (by modern standards) poor-quality picture, with areas of black and white shading across portions of the image.

&quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; was transmitted weekly on Saturday night from 18 July to 22 August 1953. Episode one (&quot;Contact Has Been Established&quot;) was scheduled from 8.15 to 8.45 p.m.; episode two (&quot;Persons Reported Missing&quot;), 8.25–8.55 p.m.; episodes three and four (&quot;Very Special Knowledge&quot; and &quot;Believed to be Suffering&quot;), 8.45–9.15 p.m.; and the final two episodes (&quot;An Unidentified Species&quot; and &quot;State of Emergency&quot;) from 9.00 to 9.30 p.m. Due to the live performances, each episode overran its slot slightly, from two minutes (episode four) to six (episode six). The long overrun of the final episode was caused by a temporary break in transmission to replace a failing microphone. Kneale later claimed that the BBC&#x27;s transmission controllers had threatened to take them off the air during one significant overrun, to which Cartier replied, &quot;Just let them try!&quot; Some BBC documentation suggests that at least one transmitter region did cut short the broadcast of the final episode.

The BBC intended that each episode be telerecorded onto 35mm film, a relatively new process that allowed for the preservation of live television broadcasts. Sale of the serial had been provisionally agreed upon with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and Cartier wanted the material available to use for trailers and recaps. Only poor-quality copies of the first two episodes were recorded before the idea was abandoned, although the first of these was later shown in Canada. During the telerecording of the second episode, an insect landed on the screen being filmed, and can be seen on the image for several minutes. It is very unlikely that material from the third to sixth episodes of the serial will ever be recovered to the BBC&#x27;s archives. The two existing episodes are the oldest surviving examples of a multi-episodic British drama production, and some of the earliest existing examples of British television drama at all, with only a few earlier one-off plays surviving.

In November 1953, it was suggested that the existing two episodes could be combined and followed with a condensed live production of the latter part of the story for a special Christmas omnibus repeat of the serial. This idea was later abandoned. Although Cartier and star Reginald Tate were keen to make an all-film omnibus version for television, this also did not come to fruition. In 1963, one of the existing episodes was selected as a representative of early British programming for the Festival of World Television at the National Film Theatre in London.

==Reception and influence==
&quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; achieved favourable viewing figures in 1953, opening with an estimated audience of 3.4 million for the first episode, increasing to 5 million for the sixth and final episode, and averaging 3.9 million for the entire serial. &quot;The Times&quot; estimated that one year before &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; was broadcast, in August 1952, the total television audience consisted of about 4 million people. In March of that year, the BBC estimated that an average of 2.25 million people watched BBC programmes each evening.

In 1954 Cecil McGivern, the Controller of Programmes at BBC Television, referred to the success of the serial in a memo discussing the impending launch of a new commercial television channel, ending the BBC&#x27;s monopoly: &quot;Had competitive television been in existence then, we would have killed it every Saturday night while &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; lasted. We are going to need &quot;many&quot; more &#x27;Quatermass Experiment&#x27; programmes&quot;. Following Kneale&#x27;s death in 2006, film historian Robert Simpson said that the serial had been &quot;event television, emptying the streets and pubs for the six weeks of its duration&quot;. When the digital television channel BBC Four remade the serial in 2005, the channel&#x27;s controller, Janice Hadlow, described the original as &quot;one of the first &#x27;must-watch&#x27; TV experiences that inspired the water cooler chat of its day&quot;.

Viewers&#x27; responses were generally positive. Letters praising the production were sent to the BBC&#x27;s listings magazine, the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, while the writer and producer were also applauded by readers of &quot;TV News&quot; magazine, which nominated them for one of the publication&#x27;s &quot;TV Bouquet&quot; awards. Looking back at &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; in a 1981 article for &quot;The Times&quot;, journalist Geoffrey Wansell highlighted the finale:&quot;Westminster Abbey undoubtedly dominated television during the summer of 1953 but it was not just the Coronation of the Queen that sticks in my mind now. It is also the memory of Professor Bernard Quatermass grappling with the pulsating giant plant that threatened to destroy the world from its rooting place in the Abbey&#x27;s nave… &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; frightened the life out of a vast new generation of television viewers whose sets had been acquired in order to watch the Coronation… Quatermass was one of the first series on British television to make life seem potentially terrifying&quot;. Subsequent audience research showed that technical problems interrupting the final episode&#x27;s broadcast had a negative impact on audiences&#x27; views of the serial; the audience felt that the climax had been spoiled.

Despite such problems—and the existence of only the first two episodes in the archives—&quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; continued to earn critical praise in the decades following its transmission. The British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Screenonline&quot; website describes the serial as &quot;one of the most influential series of the 1950s&quot;, adding that &quot;with its originality, mass appeal and dynamism, &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; became a landmark of science fiction and the cornerstone of the genre on British television&quot;. The website of the Museum of Broadcast Communications praises the serial&#x27;s underlying themes as its most effective feature: &quot;&quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;&#x27;s depiction of an Englishman&#x27;s transformation into an alienated monster dramatized a new range of gendered fears about Britain&#x27;s postwar and post-colonial security. As a result, or perhaps simply because of Kneale and Cartier&#x27;s effective combination of science fiction and poignant melodrama, audiences were captivated&quot;. The website also points to the programme&#x27;s influence on the British science-fiction television productions that followed, claiming that &quot;with [&quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;] began a British tradition of science fiction television which runs in various forms from &quot;Quatermass&quot; to &quot;A for Andromeda&quot; to &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;, and from &quot;Doctor Who&quot; to &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;&quot;.

Kneale disliked &quot;Doctor Who&quot; - the most successful of the British science-fiction programmes - saying that it had stolen his ideas. An article for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2005 described &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as the &quot;spiritual successor&quot; to the &quot;Quatermass&quot; serials, and Mark Gatiss, a scriptwriter for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, wrote of his admiration of Kneale in an article for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2006: &quot;Kneale wrote that [1953] was &#x27;an over-confident year&#x27; and he piloted his hugely influential tale like a rocket into the drab schedules of Austerity Britain… What sci-fi piece of the past 50 years doesn&#x27;t owe Kneale a huge debt?&quot;

In 2007, Gatiss appeared as the character Professor Lazarus in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Lazarus Experiment&quot;. The &quot;Radio Times&quot; noted in its preview of the episode that &quot;tonight&#x27;s story is an enjoyable synthesis of &quot;She&quot;, &quot;The Fly&quot; and &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;—even down to the final battle in a London cathedral&quot;.

==Other media==
The popularity of &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; gained the attention of the film industry, and Hammer Film Productions quickly purchased the rights to make an adaptation. It was released in 1955, and starred the American actor Brian Donlevy, supported by the English actor Jack Warner, with Val Guest directing and co-writing the screenplay. Nigel Kneale was unhappy with the result, and was especially displeased with the casting of Donlevy as Quatermass: &quot;[Donlevy] was then really on the skids and didn&#x27;t care what he was doing. He took very little interest in the making of the films or in playing the part. It was a case of take the money and run. Or in the case of Mr Donlevy, waddle&quot;. The film was titled &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot; to emphasise its X-certificate status. In America the film was renamed &quot;The Creeping Unknown&quot; after the title &quot;Shock!&quot; was considered for that territory, and an alternative opening title sequence with that name was prepared.

The BBC was also pleased with the success of &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; and in 1955 a sequel, &quot;Quatermass II&quot;, was broadcast, with John Robinson in the title role following Tate&#x27;s death. This was followed in 1958 by &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;, and both serials also had feature film versions made by Hammer. The character returned to television in a 1979 serial, simply titled &quot;Quatermass&quot;, for Thames Television.

A script book of &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;, containing several production stills from the missing episodes, was published by Penguin Books in 1959. To coincide with the broadcast of the Thames serial, it was republished in 1979 with a new introduction by Kneale.

In April 2005, BBC Worldwide released a boxed set of all their &quot;Quatermass&quot; material on DVD, containing digitally restored versions of the two existing episodes of &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;, the two subsequent BBC serials, and various extra material, including PDF files of photocopies of the original scripts for episodes three to six, but the quality of these photocopies is in some cases quite poor. The missing episodes were also semi-reconstructed using production stills, with subtitles to describe the actions depicted in the photographs.

On 2 April 2005, the digital television channel BBC Four broadcast a live remake of the serial, abridged to a single special, also entitled &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;.

On 9 September 2023, a live script-reading production of &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; was staged at Alexandra Palace in London, with Mark Gatiss playing the role of Quatermass.

<doc id="865420" wikidata="Q2157950" url="?curid=865420" title="Robert L. Caruthers">
<text>Robert Looney Caruthers (July 31, 1800 – October 2, 1882) was an American judge, politician, and professor. He helped establish Cumberland University in 1842, serving as the first president of its board of trustees, and was a cofounder of the Cumberland School of Law, one of the oldest law schools in the South. He served as a Tennessee state attorney general in the late 1820s and early 1830s, and was a justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court in the 1850s and early 1860s. He also served one term in the United States House of Representatives (1841–1843). In 1863, he was elected Governor of Tennessee by the state&#x27;s Confederates, but never took office.

==Early life and career==
Robert Looney Caruthers was born near Carthage, Tennessee, the youngest of seven children of Samuel and Elizabeth Looney Caruthers. His father had represented Sullivan County at the constitutional convention of the State of Franklin in the 1780s. After his death, Robert went to live with an uncle in Columbia, Tennessee, where he attended Woodward Academy. He later attended Washington College near Jonesborough and Greeneville College in Greeneville, and studied law under Judge Samuel Powell in Greeneville.

Caruthers returned to Carthage in 1823 to practice law. He served as the clerk for the Tennessee House of Representatives for the 1823–1824 term, and worked as editor of the &quot;Tennessee Republican&quot; newsletter. In 1826, he moved to Lebanon, Tennessee, and married Sally Sanders, a niece of Andrew Jackson&#x27;s wife, Rachel Donelson Jackson. That same year, he was appointed attorney general for the Sixth Judicial District (based in Lebanon) by Governor Sam Houston. He served in this position until 1832. In 1834, he was elected brigadier general in the Tennessee militia. In 1836, he and Alfred O. P. Nicholson published &quot;A Compilation of the Statutes of Tennessee&quot;, which remained the state&#x27;s standard compilation of statutes for over two decades.

In 1835, Caruthers was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives, representing Wilson County. He served on the House Judiciary Committee, and did not seek reelection. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives for Tennessee&#x27;s 7th District for the 1841–1843 term. Once again, he served just one term, and did not seek reelection. In 1844, he was the Whig elector for Tennessee&#x27;s at-large district, and as such, canvassed the state for unsuccessful presidential candidate Henry Clay.

In 1852, Caruthers was appointed by Governor William B. Campbell to fill the term of Nathan Green (who had retired) as Middle Tennessee&#x27;s justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court. The following year, the state legislature voted to give Caruthers a full term. In 1854, after the state constitution was amended to allow popular election of justices, Caruthers won reelection to the court.

One of Caruthers&#x27; most important decisions on the court was his opinion in &quot;Rippy v. State&quot; (1858), which involved killing in self-defense. In this decision, he rejected a literal interpretation of a statement in Judge John Catron&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Grainger v. State&quot;, issued three decades earlier, that suggested a person did not need sufficient grounds to kill in self-defense, but merely needed to testify that there was imminent danger. Caruthers&#x27; opinion reinstated the &quot;sufficient grounds&quot; rule. He wrote of &quot;Grainger&quot;, &quot;no case has been more perverted and misapplied by advocates and juries.&quot;

Prior to the outbreak of the Civil War, Caruthers was a delegate to the Washington Peace Convention in February 1861, which sought to find a peaceful resolution to the sectional strife between the North and South. He remained pro-Union until the Battle of Fort Sumter in April 1861, after which he aligned himself with the Confederacy. In August 1861, he resigned from the court to represent Tennessee in the Provisional Confederate Congress.

On July 17, 1863, the state&#x27;s Confederate leaders met in Winchester, Tennessee, and nominated Caruthers for governor to replace Isham G. Harris, who was prohibited by the state constitution from seeking a fourth consecutive term. Caruthers was officially elected on August 6, but the state constitution required that the governor-elect take the oath of office before the General Assembly. Since the Union Army controlled most of Middle and West Tennessee at this time, the Assembly was unable to convene, and Caruthers never officially took office. Confederates continued to recognize Harris as governor until the end of the war. Union forces, in the meantime, had installed Andrew Johnson as military governor.

==Cumberland University==
Cumberland University was established in Lebanon by the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in 1842. Winstead Paine Bone, in his book, &quot;A History of Cumberland University&quot;, wrote that Caruthers, a member of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, &quot;had more to do with the founding of Cumberland University than any other person.&quot; He was appointed president of the school&#x27;s first board of trustees in the Summer of 1842, and helped the school secure a charter in December of the following year. He remained president of the board until his death in 1882.

In 1847, Caruthers and his brother, Abraham Caruthers, founded the Cumberland School of Law, one of the first law schools in the South. The school, which had an initial enrollment of seven students, held its first classes in Robert Caruthers&#x27; law office. As an instructor, Abraham Caruthers abandoned the lecture system, and instead assigned a chapter from a law text, and quizzed each student on the chapter the following day, considering this the best way to determine the areas in which a student was struggling. He also held moot courts. During the Civil War, Nathan Green, Jr., whose father had been succeeded by Robert Caruthers on the Tennessee Supreme Court in 1852, managed to keep the school open.

Caruthers joined the Cumberland School of Law&#x27;s faculty as a professor of law in 1868, replacing Judge Henry Cooper. In 1878, in memory of his brother, Abraham, he funded the construction of Caruthers Hall, which housed the law school for several decades. He resigned from the faculty in 1880.

==Death and legacy==

Caruthers died in Lebanon on October 2, 1882. He was buried in the city&#x27;s Cedar Grove Cemetery. Along with being an elder in the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, Caruthers was the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Tennessee Free and Accepted Masons. His house, built in 1828, still stands on West Main Street in Lebanon. The house was designed by Henry Reiff, who built the original Hermitage mansion for Andrew Jackson in Hermitage in 1819.

<text>Maurice Stevenson Bartlett FRS (18 June 1910 – 8 January 2002) was an English statistician who made particular contributions to the analysis of data with spatial and temporal patterns. He is also known for his work in the theory of statistical inference and in multivariate analysis.

==Biography==
Born in London, Bartlett was raised in a poor family but won a scholarship to Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith, where he was inspired to the study of statistics by a chapter in Hall and Knight&#x27;s &quot;Algebra&quot;. In 1929, he won a scholarship to Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge where he read mathematics, graduating with the rank of wrangler. He attended lectures on statistics by John Wishart, on relativity by Arthur Eddington and on quantum mechanics by Paul Dirac. In one of his lectures Wishart described his geometric derivation of the Wishart distribution. Overnight Bartlett worked out a proof using characteristic functions. Bartlett was Wishart&#x27;s first post-graduate student and they wrote two papers together. This was the beginning of Bartlett&#x27;s involvement with multivariate analysis. During his Queens years, he rowed for the college.

In 1933, Bartlett was recruited by Egon Pearson to the new statistics department at University College, London. Pearson was already working with Jerzy Neyman. Also in the college were Ronald A. Fisher and J. B. S. Haldane. Bartlett was stimulated by all of them, most of all by the work of Fisher, criticising some of it (for example, fiducial inference) while developing other parts (for example conditional inference). Relations between the two men fluctuated; sometimes Bartlett was in Fisher&#x27;s good books, but often not. In 1934, Bartlett became statistician at the Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) agricultural research station at Jealott&#x27;s Hill. Not only did he deal with practical problems but he worked on statistical theory, as well as on problems in genetics but he became interested in the characterisation of intelligence. He remembered Jealott&#x27;s Hill as the best working environment of his career. Bartlett left ICI for the University of Cambridge in 1938 but at the outset of World War II was mobilised into the Ministry of Supply, conducting rocket research alongside Frank Anscombe, David Kendall and Pat Moran.

After the war Bartlett&#x27;s renewed Cambridge work focused on time-series analysis and stochastic process. With Jo Moyal he planned a large book on probability, but the collaboration did not work out and Bartlett went ahead and published his own book on stochastic processes. He made a number of visits to the United States. In 1947 he became professor of mathematical statistics at the School of Mathematics at the University of Manchester where he not only developed his interests in epidemiology but also served as an able and active administrator. In 1960, he took up the chair of statistics at University College, London before serving the last eight years of his academic life as professor of biomathematics at the University of Oxford. He retired in 1975.

After his retirement Bartlett remained active in statistics, visiting the Institute of Advanced Studies at the Australian National University several times. He had married Sheila, daughter of C. E. Chapman, in 1957, the couple parenting a daughter. Bartlett died in Exmouth, Devon.

Bartlett is known for Bartlett&#x27;s method for estimating power spectra and Bartlett&#x27;s test for homoscedasticity.

<text>Jackson Beck (July 23, 1912 – July 28, 2004) was an American actor best known as the announcer on radio&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; and the voice of Bluto in the Famous era Popeye theatrical shorts.

==Early years==
Beck was born on July 23, 1912, in New York City. Beck&#x27;s father, Max Beck, was an actor on stage and in silent film. His grandfather Joseph immigrated from Saxony, Germany and founded the distillery Joseph Beck &amp; Sons.

==Radio==
Beck&#x27;s early radio experience included work at WINS and WHN, both in New York City. Beginning in 1931, he worked on &quot;Myrt and Marge&quot;, among other roles. In 1934, he was the announcer for &quot;The Adventures of Babe Ruth&quot; on the radio. In 1943, he took over as narrator of radio&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot;; it was Beck who intoned the familiar prologue &quot;strange visitor from another planet...&quot;
He also had recurring roles, voicing an occasional tough guy and also portraying Beany Martin, the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;&#x27;s teenage copy boy. On &quot;Superman&quot; episodes featuring Batman, he played Bruce Wayne&#x27;s butler, Alfred Beagle.

He also impersonated Joseph Stalin and other world leaders for &quot;The March of Time&quot; radio series, starred as &quot;The Cisco Kid&quot; on radio from 1942 to 1945 and sleuth Philo Vance in a syndicated series from 1948 to 1950, starred in the dramatic anthology &quot;Brownstone Theater&quot; on Mutual, and served as narrator for the radio adventures of &quot;Tom Corbett, Space Cadet&quot;.

Beck also co-starred in several episodes of the &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot;.

==Television==
Beck portrayed Perry White, Clark Kent&#x27;s boss in Filmation&#x27;s &quot;The New Adventures of Superman&quot; animated series and was narrator as well. He was the announcer for the first season of &quot;Tom Corbett, Space Cadet&quot; on television.

==Film==
In 1966, Beck dubbed the English voice of the judge listing Tuco&#x27;s many crimes before sentencing him to death by hanging in &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;, and used his deep, dramatic, modulated voice as the narrator of Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot; in 1969. He also narrated the cult comedy film &quot;Cry Uncle!&quot; in 1971, and was one of the players in National Lampoon&#x27;s first comedy album &quot;Radio Dinner&quot; in 1972. He was prominent as well in Allen&#x27;s 1987 film &quot;Radio Days&quot;, dubbing the voice of the on-the-spot newsman.

==Animation==
Beck had a prolific career in animation, becoming one of the regular voice actors at Famous Studios in the mid-1940s. He voiced Bluto in the Popeye cartoons, Little Lulu&#x27;s father, the fox in the Baby Huey cartoons, and Buzzy the Crow, who was a foil for Katnip the Cat in a number of cartoons. Beck used a black dialect for the voice of Buzzy. He was also the voice of King Leonardo in the 1960s TV cartoon series of the same name. He also had a part in the &quot;Peanuts&quot; 1977 film &quot;Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown&quot; as the snickering cat, Brutus. He narrated the 1980s &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; animated TV series. His other voice work included network TV promos (he did a series of promos for NBC&#x27;s NFL coverage for much of the 1980s), narration for sketches on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, movie trailers, and commercials for everything from toys to shampoo (one of Beck&#x27;s very last commercials was for Infusium Shampoo).

==Other work==
Beck also served as a pitchman for products from Combat Roach Killer to Little Caesars Pizza (he was Caesar Jr.) In 1999, he narrated a dramatization of L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Methuselah&quot; for NPR&#x27;s radio series &quot;2000X&quot;. Beck also did few onscreen acting roles. A notable one was as mobster Willie Saffire in the crime-based daytime soap opera &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; from 1968 to 1969.

Beck was featured announcer on the 1972 comedy record album &quot;National Lampoon Radio Dinner&quot;.

Beck had also done some voice work for MTV, mostly for their contest advertisements.

Beck also recorded voices for children&#x27;s records such as &quot;The Little Engine That Could&quot; from Diplomat Records.

In 1990, he told Newsday “My job is to sell a carload of whatever the hell it is,” he told Newsday in 1990, “to clean out the supermarket shelves, and get them replenished. … I’m an advertising man, and I treat my voice as a business. People who treat it as art don’t make money.”

In 1994, Beck voiced Darrel the Fifth Fish, Hunter #2, Wickersham Guard #2, the Sneetches and Greedy Ape in &quot;Storybook Weaver&quot;, and later in 2004, remade as &quot;Storybook Weaver Deluxe&quot; (his last voice).

==Death==
Beck died of a stroke on July 28, 2004, five days after his 92nd birthday. He is buried in Brooklyn&#x27;s Mount Hope Cemetery.
