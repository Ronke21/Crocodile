<doc id="864044" wikidata="Q1513887" url="?curid=864044" title="Courtney Whitmore">
<text>Courtney Elizabeth Whitmore, known as Stargirl and formerly as the second [[Star-Spangled Kid]], is a superhero created by Geoff Johns and Lee Moder who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character&#x27;s name, appearance, and personality were patterned after Johns&#x27; 18-year-old sister Courtney, who died in the explosion of TWA Flight 800 in 1996.

Stargirl has appeared in &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Justice League Action&quot;, and &quot;Young Justice&quot;. She has also appeared in live-action shows &quot;Smallville&quot; played by Britt Irvin, &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot; played by Sarah Grey, and in her own television series played by Brec Bassinger. Bassinger reprised the role in the fourth season of the HBO Max series &quot;Titans&quot;.

==Publication history==
The character was created by writer Geoff Johns and artist Lee Moder. She made her first appearance in &quot;Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.&quot; #0 (July 1999). 

==Fictional character biography==
===Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.===

Courtney Whitmore, stepdaughter of Pat Dugan, finds the original Star-Spangled Kid&#x27;s gear in her stepfather&#x27;s belongings. She dons the costume to annoy Dugan, as she resents him marrying her mother and moving the family from Los Angeles to Blue Valley, Nebraska. Dugan, a skilled mechanic, designs and builds S.T.R.I.P.E., a robotic suit that he uses to accompany and protect her.

During her time in Blue Valley, her frequent nemesis is the young villainess known as Shiv, daughter of the immortal Dragon King. Their most recent rematch was in &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, on a page added to the hardcover edition.

===Stargirl===
Courtney joins the Justice Society of America. After being given Starman Jack Knight&#x27;s cosmic staff, she changes her identity to Stargirl. Courtney appears in most issues of &quot;JSA&quot; and it is in these pages that her half-sister Patricia Dugan is born.

Later, she confronts her predecessor&#x27;s killer, Solomon Grundy. Driven further into madness by the Joker&#x27;s chemical assault, Grundy attacks the JSA headquarters with the head of the Statue of Liberty. With the aid of Jakeem Thunder, Courtney fights Grundy in the streets and into the sewers below. The young heroes barely defeat Grundy and Johnny Thunderbolt repairs the Statue. Grundy later develops an obsession with Courtney.

Courtney encounters Merry Pemberton, the sister of the original Star-Spangled Kid, during the &quot;Sins of Youth&quot; storyline. Merry&#x27;s concerns about her brother&#x27;s legacy and about young superheroes battling adults causes friction with Courtney. They resolve their differences during a battle against the forces of Klarion the Witch Boy. Courtney later saves Merry&#x27;s life during an attack by Amazo. During this incident, Courtney is magically aged to an adult by Klarion.

Later, she discovers her biological father Sam Kurtis working as a common thug for an incarnation of the Royal Flush Gang. They later confront each other during one of the Flush Gang&#x27;s robberies.

In &quot;Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.&quot; and an issue of &quot;Impulse&quot;, Courtney hints at having a crush on Robin (Tim Drake), a concept that was not developed in subsequent issues.

Courtney briefly dates fellow JSA member Captain Marvel, who, in his secret identity of Billy Batson, is the same age as she, although she was attracted to Billy in his older form in the first place, without knowing his secret identity, and even kissed him. To outsiders, however, Captain Marvel is by all appearances a fully grown up adult, and the relationship between Marvel and Stargirl draws criticism from Jakeem Thunder and Jay Garrick. After Garrick confronts them, Marvel decides to leave the JSA and Courtney, instead of revealing his secret to the team. Marvel later returns to the JSA and explains that the Wisdom of Solomon prevents him from revealing his secret identity.

A glimpse into the future shows an adult &quot;Starwoman&quot; married to Albert Rothstein, the JSA member known as Atom Smasher.

====JSA/JSA and Black Vengeance====

Courtney&#x27;s family is murdered by agents of Per Degaton and she travels with the rest of the JSA to 1951. The Modern Age successors to Golden Age JSA members meet and fight alongside the originals to save her family and the future. She finds herself forced to work with Atom Smasher again, for the first time since he defected to Black Adam&#x27;s rival team. During her trip to the past, Courtney is briefly stuck in an asylum when she tries to recruit Ted Knight. Knight had become clinically depressed for his perceived role in the creation of the atomic bomb to the point that he initially thought Courtney was a hallucination, but she was saved by a figure later identified as Starwoman, an adult version of her infant sister Patricia. After the crisis is over, Courtney forgives Al for his past alliance with Black Adam but Atom Smasher is nearly killed by the Spectre during an attack on Khandaq. He survives, but the event reveals the depth of Courtney&#x27;s feelings for him. She returns to her own time to find her family alive again.

Later, Atom Smasher is tried and convicted for his actions while working for Black Adam. During a TV appearance, Courtney says that with Al in prison, she would &quot;be there for him... no matter how long it takes.&quot;

====&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;====
Courtney is approached by the Shade, who tells her that her biological father is dead. This tragedy and her experience of the relationship between Liberty Belle and Jesse Quick prompts her to re-evaluate her family life. She discovers that she can&#x27;t hate her biological father for his failings as a father and as a man. She also learns to accept Pat Dugan as her only real father figure.

Stargirl becomes part of a coalition consisting of the JSA, the Doom Patrol and the Teen Titans that is organized to stop Superboy-Prime from destroying Smallville. Superboy-Prime kills several of the Titans, including Pantha and Baby Wildebeest and maims Risk, removing his arm. Stargirl later attends a memorial service for heroes who died in the Crisis.

Afterwards, she begins attending college. She has altered her equipment: her rod now telescopes into a small cylinder, and her costume and belt materialize as the rod extends to full size.

===&quot;One Year Later&quot;===
Courtney joins the new roster of the Justice Society and fights without S.T.R.I.P.E.&#x27;s assistance.

A seasoned hero despite her age, she forges a bond with her young teammate Cyclone, the eager and over-impulsive granddaughter of the first Red Tornado. They two bond after witnessing the death of Mister America and Courtney suggests Cyclone create a new superhero costume and name. Stargirl resumes her role of mentorship for the youngest heroes by helping Jefferson Pierce&#x27;s daughter, Jennifer, cope with her powers and her isolation. Courtney later expresses to Damage her doubts about Gog.

A future version of Courtney is seen in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; (vol. 3) #53 along with Lex Luthor and his future Titans. Her role is minimal, however, she is seen wearing Jack Knight&#x27;s goggles and jacket—the closest she has ever come to Jack&#x27;s vision of &quot;Starwoman&quot; at the end of his series.

In the &quot;Final Crisis&quot; miniseries, Courtney joins with other heroes to form an underground resistance against Darkseid.

Courtney is present (and apparently involved in voting) for discussions on how to move the JSA forward after the Gog debacle (and whom to retain or remove from the team) and she defends some of the heroes who sided with Gog. Later she is present when the JSA meet a depowered Billy Batson, who reveals his secret identity to the others.

After the battle with Black Adam and Isis, Courtney was unhappy, as the events had happened on her birthday (and had ruined any planned celebrations). When she goes home and opens the door, the entire Justice Society is present and have prepared a late surprise party for her. Later she is unhappy to learn she still needed her braces despite being acknowledged as one of the senior members of the JSA. It has been established that both she and Atom Smasher love each other in direct quotes rather than asides and implied habits, but the elder JSA members&#x27; comments about their age difference forced Al to turn Courtney down, stating he loved her &quot;like a sister&quot;.

Following a massive supervillain attack, the JSA is split in two. Power Girl convinces Courtney to join the JSA All-Stars splinter group. She later expresses a deep feeling of regret over siding with the All-Stars, claiming that she feels more at home with the original roster. Karen talks her through these doubts, telling her that she needed Courtney on the team because all the other teen members of the JSA look up to her.

===The New 52===
In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC&#x27;s continuity. In this new timeline, Stargirl appears as part of a new &quot;Justice League of America&quot; title.

Born in Los Angeles, Courtney Whitmore was cleaning out the office of Barbara Whitmore&#x27;s boyfriend Pat Dugan when she found a staff, a belt, and a shirt with a star on it. While trying them on, she became Stargirl and caught the perpetrator of a fire she spotted. The heroic actions went viral. After talking to her friend about what happens next, Courtney was informed by Pat that the person who originally wielded the equipment has died. Though Pat agreed to train her, Courtney had to respond to the criminal activity caused by Shadow Thief who was taking hostages to draw out a superhero. She managed to rout out Shadow Thief. When Stargirl returned home, she found that Shadow Thief arrived first, killed her brother, and wounded Barbara and Ted. Stargirl used this trauma to become a better superhero.

Amanda Waller later chooses Stargirl as the public face of the JLA&#x27;s public relations campaign. After the JLA disbands in &quot;Forever Evil&quot;, she joins Justice League United.

In &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Stargirl is among the superheroes who confront Doctor Manhattan on the Moon. Stargirl appears with the Justice Society of America when Manhattan restores them and the Legion of Super-Heroes.

===DC Rebirth===
In &quot;The New Golden Age&quot;, Stargirl helps rescue thirteen missing sidekicks known as the Lost Children, who the Time Masters kidnapped in an attempt to rescue them from Doctor Manhattan&#x27;s alterations to the timeline. After discovering that the children cannot be returned to their own times or risk causing a time paradox, Courtney helps them find homes in the present day.

In &quot;&quot;, Huntress and Stargirl battle various heroes who were mutated by Beast Boy&#x27;s spores.

<doc id="864048" wikidata="Q1192867" url="?curid=864048" title="Battle of Pułtusk (1806)">
<text>The Battle of Pułtusk took place on 26 December 1806 during the War of the Fourth Coalition near Pułtusk, Poland. Despite their strong numerical superiority and artillery, the Russians suffered the French attacks, before retiring the next day having suffered greater losses than the French, disorganizing their army for the rest of the year.

==Background==

===Strategic context===
After defeating the Prussian army in the autumn of 1806, Emperor Napoleon entered partitioned Poland to confront the Russian army, which had been preparing to support the Prussians until their sudden defeat. Crossing the River Vistula, the French advance corps took Warsaw on 28 November 1806.
The Russian army was under the overall command of Field Marshal Mikhail Kamensky, but he was old and becoming infirm. The Russian First Army of some 55,000 to 68,000 men, commanded by Count Bennigsen, had fallen back from the Vistula to the line of the River Wkra (Ukra), in order to unite with the Second Army, about 37,000 strong, under General Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden (Buxhöwden), which was approaching from Russia and was still several days march from the First Army. However, realising his mistake in allowing the French to cross the Vistula, Kamensky advanced at the beginning of December to try to regain the line of the river. French forces crossed the Narew River at Modlin on 10 December, and the Prussian Corps commanded by General-Leutnant Anton Wilhelm von L&#x27;Estocq failed to retake Thorn (Toruń). This led Bennigsen on 11 December to issue orders to fall back and hold the line of the River Wkra.

When this was reported to Napoleon, he assumed the Russians were in full retreat. He ordered the forces under Marshal Joachim Murat – the 3rd corps of Marshal Louis Nicolas Davout, 7th Corps of Marshal Pierre Augereau, 5th Corps under Lannes, and Murat&#x27;s 1st Cavalry Reserve Corps – to pursue towards Pułtusk. Meanwhile, Marshal Michel Ney&#x27;s 6th Corps, Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte&#x27;s 1st Corps, and Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessières&#x27;s 2nd Cavalry Reserve Corps turned the Russian right. Marshal Nicolas Soult&#x27;s 4th Corps linked the two wings of the French army.

Kamensky reversed the Russian retreat, and he ordered an advance to support the troops on the River Wkra. On the night of 23 and 24 December, Davout&#x27;s corps forced a crossing of the lower Wkra in the Battle of Czarnowo. After engagements at Bieżuń on 23 December with Bessières and Soldau (Działdowo) on 25 December with Ney, the Prussian corps under L&#x27;Estocq was driven north towards Königsberg. Augereau&#x27;s corps seized a second crossing of the Wkra on the 24th at Kołoząb. Realising the danger, Kamensky ordered a retreat to Ostrołęka; the old field marshal, however, appears to have had a mental breakdown and withdrew himself to Grodno. Bennigsen decided to disobey his superior&#x27;s orders by standing and fighting on 26 December at Pułtusk. He had available the 2nd Division of Lieutenant General Alexander Ivanovich Ostermann-Tolstoy, the 6th Division of Lieutenant General Alexander Karlovich Sedmoratski, part of Lieutenant General Dmitry Golitsyn&#x27;s 4th Division, and part of Lieutenant General Fabian Gottlieb von Osten-Sacken&#x27;s 3rd Division. To the north-west, most of the 4th Division commanded by Golitsyn and the 5th Division under Lieutenant General Dmitry Dokhturov fought the Battle of Gołymin on the same day.

===Weather===
The weather caused severe difficulties for both sides. Mild autumn weather had lasted longer than normal. The usual frosts, which rendered the inadequate roads passable after the muddy conditions of autumn, were broken by thaws. There was a thaw on 17 December and a two-day thaw on 26 and 27 December. The result was that both sides found it very difficult to manoeuvre; in particular the French (as they were advancing) had great difficulty bringing up their artillery. Davout recorded it took two hours to cover miles.

There were also difficulties with supply. Captain Marcellin Marbot, who was serving with Augereau&#x27;s Corps wrote:
===Site===
Pułtusk lies on the west bank of the River Narew with a suburb on the east bank. The road from Strzegociz crossed the river by a bridge and then ran north-west towards Gołymin. A second road from Warsaw entered the town from the south-west, and then ran along the west bank of the river towards Różan. Before it reached Pułtusk this road was joined by one from Nasielsk. Another longer route to Różan ran along the east bank. The final road was that to Markow, which ran northwards from the town. The town itself lay on low ground. To the north and west lay a plateau, narrowing to a wide ridge nearer the river. A ravine cut into the plateau near the river. A large wood lay on the north-west side of the plateau, towards the village of Mosin. Further out from the plateau more woods covered the approaches from Warsaw.

==Battle==

===Forces===

Lannes commanded two infantry divisions under Generals of Division Louis Gabriel Suchet and Honoré Théodore Maxime Gazan de la Peyrière. Suchet&#x27;s 1st Division included General of Brigade Michel Marie Claparède&#x27;s 3-battalion 17th Light Infantry Regiment, General of Brigade Honoré Charles Reille&#x27;s 4-battalion 34th Line Infantry Regiment and 3-battalion 40th Line Infantry Regiment, and General of Brigade Dominique Honoré Antoine Vedel&#x27;s 64th and 88th Line Infantry Regiments, three battalions each. Gazan&#x27;s 2nd Division comprised General of Brigade Jean François Graindorge&#x27;s 3-battalion 21st Light Infantry Regiment and 2-battalion 28th Light Infantry Regiment and General of Brigade François Frédéric Campana&#x27;s 100th and 103rd Line Infantry Regiments, three battalions each. General of Brigade Anne-François-Charles Trelliard led 12 squadrons of the corps cavalry, which consisted of the 9th and 10th Hussar Regiments and the 21st Chasseurs à Cheval Regiment. General of Brigade Louis Foucher de Careil commanded the corps artillery, 38 guns in four foot and two horse artillery batteries at full strength. Smith itemized Colbert-Chabanais&#x27; 6th Corps cavalry but repeated Trelliard&#x27;s list of regiments, which was clearly a misprint.
Historian Francis Loraine Petre wrote that General of Division Nicolas Léonard Beker&#x27;s 1,200-strong 5th Dragoon Division was also present, but did not note its composition. Petre mentioned Beker and Trelliard, but not Colbert-Chabanais. Petre stated that Beker led the 5th Division. Digby Smith placed Beker in charge of the 2nd Dragoon Division and listed the 3rd, 4th, 10th, 11th, 13th, and 22nd Dragoon Regiments as part of this unit. These units are identical to Grouchy&#x27;s division. General of Brigade Joseph Augustin Fournier Marquis de D&#x27;Aultane was the acting commander of the 3rd Division of Davout&#x27;s corps. This unit was made up of two brigades. General of Brigade Claude Petit led the 2-battalion 12th Line Infantry Regiment and the 3-battalion 21st Line Infantry Regiment. General of Brigade Nicolas Hyacinthe Gautier directed the 25th and 85th Line Infantry Regiments, two battalions each. General of Division Louis Michel Antoine Sahuc led the 4th Dragoon Division, which only had one brigade present. General of Brigade Jacques Léonard Laplanche commanded the 15th and 25th Dragoon Regiments. Fournier had 70 chasseurs à cheval, 100 dragoons, and only one artillery piece attached to his command. The rest of the corps cavalry was at Gołymin.

Bennigsen commanded Ostermann-Tolstoy&#x27;s 2nd Division, Sedmoratski&#x27;s 6th Division, and elements of the 3rd and 4th Divisions. The 2nd Division had three infantry and one cavalry brigades. Major General Nikolai Mazovsky directed the &quot;Pavlovski&quot; Grenadier and &quot;Rostov&quot; Musketeer Regiments, Major General Alexander Yakovlevich Sukin led the &quot;Petersburg&quot; Grenadier and &quot;Jeletzsky&quot; Musketeer Regiments, and Major General Ivan Andreievich Lieven commanded the 1st and 20th Jager Regiments. Major General Koschin&#x27;s cavalry brigade included the &quot;Life&quot; Cuirassier, &quot;Kargopol&quot; Dragoon, and &quot;Soum&quot; Hussar Regiments, plus two cossack units. There were a total of 60 artillery pieces in four foot batteries and one horse artillery batteries.

The 6th Division also controlled three infantry and one cavalry brigades. Major General Karl Gustav von Baggovut led the &quot;Starokolski&quot; Musketeer and 4th Jäger Regiments, Major General Vasili Sergeievich Rachmanov commanded the &quot;Vilnius&quot; and &quot;Nizov&quot; Musketeer Regiments, and Major General Fedosei Mikhailovich Bikov directed the &quot;Reval&quot; and &quot;Volhynia&quot; Musketeer Regiments. Major General Karl Osipovich Lambert&#x27;s cavalry brigade comprised the &quot;Ekaterinoslav&quot; Cuirassier, &quot;Kiev&quot; Dragoon, and &quot;Alexandrov&quot; Hussar Regiments, plus one Tatar and one cossack unit. The 6th Division artillery numbered 72 guns in five foot and one horse artillery batteries. The units of the 3rd and 4th Divisions are not listed. Altogether, Bennigsen controlled 50,500 men in 66 battalions, 55 squadrons, and his artillery.

===Action===
Bennigsen arrayed his forces along the Pułtusk-Gołymin road, with three lines composed respectively of 21, 18 and 5 battalions. The left rested on the town, the right on the Mosin wood. The artillery was positioned in front of the first line. On the extreme right Major General Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly occupied part of the Mosin wood with three battalions, a cavalry regiment and an artillery battery covering the road to Gołymin. Baggovut covered the left of the line and the bridge over the Narew from a position in front of the ravine with ten battalions, two squadrons of dragoons and an artillery battery. Deployed along the edge of the ridge were 28 squadrons of cavalry linking Barclay de Tolly and Baggovut. Cossack cavalry was deployed in front of them.

Marshal Lannes had orders to cross the Narew at Pułtusk with his corps. He was aware that there was a Russian force in front of him, but did not know its size. After struggling through the mud, his first troops reached the area at about 10:00 AM, and drove the cossacks back onto the Russian main line. Because of the terrain, Lannes could only see the Russian advance positions on the extreme left and right with the cavalry between them.

Lannes deployed Suchet&#x27;s division on his left, opposite the Mosin wood. Gazan&#x27;s division covered the rest of the Russian line. The few guns were deployed on the left and in the centre.

At about 11:00 AM the French right advanced against Baggovut. The Russian cossacks and cavalry were driven back and Baggovut sent forward a Jäger unit, which was driven back despite artillery support. The French centre had also advanced, to attack Baggovut from the flank. But this manoeuvre exposed them to the Russian cavalry line, seven squadrons of which suddenly attacked the French flank in a sudden snow storm while Baggovut&#x27;s cavalry and the jägers attacked from the front. A French infantry battalion then took the Russian cavalry in their flank. After a confused melee the Russians fell back to their original position. Lannes&#x27;s cavalry division, under Trelliard tried to advance but was driven off by artillery fire.
At the same time as the French right attacked, on the French left Suchet&#x27;s division, led by Lannes in person, attacked the position held by Barclay. The initial attack drove the Russians out of the wood, and captured the battery stationed there, but Barclay&#x27;s reserve drove the French back into the wood and recaptured the guns.

The French centre had also advanced. The Russian cavalry withdrew behind the main line, exposing the French to artillery fire from the Russian batteries.

By about 2 p.m. the French position looked dangerous. The Russian left had held, the French centre was suffering from the artillery fire, and on the right increasing pressure was beginning to force Suchet&#x27;s men out of the wood. A French retreat looked a distinct possibility when unexpected reinforcements arrived.
The 3rd Division of Davout&#x27;s 3rd Corps, temporarily commanded by his Chief of Staff Fournier, had been ordered to pursue a Russian column apparently retiring on Pułtusk. Concerned about the strength of the Russian cavalry force which was escorting guns and stores, Fournier had pursued but not engaged. He was preparing to stop for the night when he heard the sounds of combat to his right, and so marched his men towards Pułtusk. Due to the state of the roads he was only able to bring up one gun.

Seeing this force approach, Bennigsen wheeled back his main line to face the wood, thus reducing the artillery fire directed at Lannes&#x27;s units. Barclay, finding Fournier attacking his right flank, fell back to the right of the main Russian line. Bennigsen reinforced him with two infantry regiments and some cavalry, and directed an artillery battery to fire on the wood. Thus reinforced Barclay attacked the wood. The French were driven out, and Fournier&#x27;s right flank exposed. This was attacked by twenty squadrons of Russian cavalry, but the 85th French Infantry Regiment formed squares and by a steady fire drove the cavalry off. At about 8:00 PM the combat died away, and Fournier retired to the edge of the woods.

The arrival of Fournier&#x27;s division also had an effect on the French right wing. With the switch of much of the Russian artillery to support Barclay de Tolly, the French were able to use their own guns to support a fresh attack at about 2:00 PM on Baggovut by the brigades of Claparède and Vedel, supported by Gazan on their left. Baggovut&#x27;s men were driven back over the ravine in their rear, and their guns captured. Ostermann-Tolstoy established a battery to Barclay&#x27;s right and reinforced by five battalions he attacked. After a desperate fight the French were thrown back and the guns recaptured. The French right and centre fell back to their start positions as night fell.

During the night, Bennigsen decided to retire, and did so the next day, 27 December, using the longer road to Różan along the east bank of the Narew. From there he continued his retreat to Ostrołęka. Fournier&#x27;s division also moved off to rejoin the 3rd Corps at Golymin. Lannes was in no position to pursue the Russians, and occupied Pułtusk on 28 December.

==Analysis==
Losses on both sides are disputed. Lannes claimed the Russians lost 2,000 killed, 3,000 wounded and 1,800 prisoners, a total of 6,800; Sir Robert Wilson, British liaison officer with the Russian army, claimed the Russians lost less than 5,000 men. Lannes undercounted and only admitted to 700 French killed and 1,500 wounded; Russian authorities said the French losses were 7,000 killed and wounded and 70 prisoners. Given that the French were attacking and exposed to artillery fire, a total for them of 7,000 killed, wounded and prisoners does not seem unreasonable, and a total of 5,000 casualties for the Russians seems a good estimate. Petre quotes the various authorities. Another authority gives French losses as five generals and 140 officers killed or wounded, 3,200 soldiers dead or wounded, and 700 captured. Russian losses are stated as 3,500 total, including 1,500 men and 12 guns captured. On the French side, Lannes, Bonnard, Claparède and Vedel were all wounded.

Bennigsen claimed a victory. The consensus seems to be that having decided to fight, in defiance of his orders he could have better disposed his forces, taken the offensive and destroyed Lannes&#x27;s corps before Fournier came up. Bennigsen said he thought he was facing 60,000 French under Napoleon in person, which may explain his defensive stance. Bennigsen also complained that Buxhoeveden did not support him, but that officer was obeying his orders to retire.

Lannes, on the other hand, was following his orders, and the result was to find himself facing a superior force in a good defensive position. Napoleon&#x27;s orders had not allowed for this, and unaware of the odds against him, Lannes attacked. If Fournier had not used his initiative and marched to the sound of the guns, the result may have been very different.

==Aftermath==
At the Battle of Gołymin, Golitsyn successfully held off a superior French force. This, combined with the failure of Soult&#x27;s corps to pass around the Russian right flank spoiled Napoleon&#x27;s chances of cutting the Russian line of retreat and trapping them against the River Narew.

The Russian 5th and 7th Divisions retired towards the main body of the army at Różan. Bennigsen&#x27;s forces fell back to Nowogród on the River Narew, uniting on 1 January 1807 with the forces under Buxhoeveden.
On 28 December, Napoleon stopped his advance and, having lost contact with the Russian army, decided to go into winter quarters. His troops were exhausted and discontented, and the supply situation was in great disorder.

The break in hostilities did not last long. Soon afterward, Bennigsen was appointed army commander and he launched an unexpected winter offensive into East Prussia. Aimed at the French strategic left flank, the Russian blow was blunted at the Battle of Mohrungen on 25 January 1807. Napoleon immediately counterattacked, trying to cut the Russian communications line that ran to the northeast. The French caught up with the Russians on 7 and 8 February 1807 and the dreadful Battle of Eylau was fought.

==Popular culture==
The battle is included in Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;.

<text>The Technique, also known as the &quot;″Nique&quot;, is the official student newspaper of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia, and has referred to itself as &quot;the South&#x27;s liveliest college newspaper&quot; since 1945. As of the fall semester of 2011, the &quot;Technique&quot; has a weekly circulation of 10,000, distributed to numerous locations on the Georgia Tech campus and a handful of locations in the surrounding area. The first issue of the &quot;Technique&quot; was published on November 17, 1911, and the paper has printed continuously since its founding. The paper publishes weekly throughout the regular school year and primarily covers news, events and issues specific to the Georgia Tech community. In 2004 it was one of 25 collegiate newspapers to receive the Pacemaker award from the Associated Collegiate Press.

==History==
A publication known as &quot;The Georgia Tech&quot; was the Georgia Institute of Technology&#x27;s (also known as &quot;Georgia Tech&quot;) first student newspaper. It was established in 1894 and was the second student publication to be established on campus. &quot;The Georgia Tech&quot; published a &quot;Commencement Issue&quot; that reviewed sporting events and gave information about each class. The &quot;Commencement Issue&quot; was likely similar to the &quot;Technique&quot;″s Freshman Issue. The &quot;Technique&quot; was founded in 1911; its first issue was published on November 17, 1911 by editors Albert Blohm and E. A. Turner, and the content revolved around the upcoming rivalry football game against the University of Georgia. The first issue also featured an article by legendary football coach John Heisman.

The &quot;Technique&quot; has been published weekly ever since, except for a brief period that the paper was published twice weekly. This period ran from January 14, 1948, to September 6, 1956. &quot;The Georgia Tech&quot; and the &quot;Technique&quot; operated separately for several years following the &quot;Technique&quot;″s establishment, though the two publications eventually merged in 1916. Several sources claim that the &quot;Technique&quot; is among a number of student organizations to be founded by the ANAK Society.

==Present-day publication==
The &quot;Technique&quot; is published weekly during the fall and spring semesters, with the exceptions of &quot;dead week&quot;, finals week, and spring break and is published biweekly during the summer semester. As of the 2005–2006 publication year, the paper has also taken a hiatus the week prior to spring break. General staff meetings are held on Tuesdays, when the majority of story assignments are made to a mostly volunteer writing staff. Deadline is on Wednesday nights during weeks when the paper is published, and the copy is sent to the printer on Thursday morning. The paper is then distributed around the campus on the Friday of that week. The &quot;Technique&quot;″s office is located in the northwest corner of the Student Services Building.

The paper is operated by a staff of approximately 50 paid and unpaid students, as well as two permanent, paid, non-student staff members. As Georgia Tech has no journalism school, the &quot;Technique&quot; welcomes all students within the institute to contribute to its content. The &quot;Technique&quot; is funded primarily by advertisements, and to a lesser extent by Tech&#x27;s Student Government Association.

The &quot;Technique&quot; is generally between 16 and 40 pages long, the length of an issue being dependent upon the number of advertisements purchased for a given week. The paper is organized into five sections: News (includes Georgia Tech-specific crime reports and news), Life (previously Focus; includes human interest stories), Entertainment (includes reviews of music, movies, performance arts, and video games, cartoons, a crossword puzzle, and sudoku puzzles), Opinions (includes editorials, an editorial cartoon, op-eds, and letters to the editor), and Sports (includes summaries of recent Georgia Tech sports games and sports features).

==Special editions==
===To Hell With Georgia===
The most well-known of the special issues the &quot;Technique&quot; publishes is a satire of the University of Georgia&#x27;s (UGA) student newspaper (&quot;The Red and Black&quot;). The tradition of this parody dates back to the very first issue of the &quot;Technique&quot;, which was published with the intent of taunting Georgia Tech&#x27;s rival school, and has its roots in the embittered rivalry between Georgia Tech and the University of Georgia. It is published just before the two schools compete in football and is one of the last issues of the fall semester. The parody is known as &quot;To Hell With Georgia&quot;, after the school&#x27;s popular cheer. On years where the schools play their football match at UGA&#x27;s Sanford Stadium, &quot;Technique&quot; staff distribute the issue across UGA&#x27;s campus. In 2009, the THWGA issue was printed with an incorrect year in the masthead, though the date was corrected in the version posted online.

===Freshman Issue===
The Freshman Issue is another special edition of the &quot;Technique&quot;. It is the first issue published each academic year and is by far the longest issue, with each of the sections about as long as a normal issue. The content usually centers on the themes of welcoming freshmen and welcoming returning students back to Tech. The Freshman Issue also contains a special section dedicated to helping freshmen become more acquainted with Tech and its customs. It is generally the only issue in which content from previous issues is reprinted.

===Other special editions===
Other special editions include the Homecoming issue, the April Fool&#x27;s issue (historically known as the Techlique, which includes a section of fake news parodying Tech in a similar style to the &quot;To Hell With Georgia&quot; issue) and the &quot;Best of Tech&quot; issue, which is the final issue of the spring semester.

==Recurring features==
===Two Bits===
The &quot;Technique&quot; featured an anonymous humor column called &quot;Two Bits&quot;, which is authored by the mysterious Two Bits Man, a sarcastic, everyday virtuoso who concerns himself with Tech- and university-specific subjects. His articles range from relentless sickly sniffles to school-wide subjects of controversy or interest. Popular targets for his scorn include Georgia Tech&#x27;s Parking department and School of Physics, whereas he consistently praises the President Emeritus G. Wayne Clough, who he refers to as &quot;Funk Masta G. Wayne&quot;. The Two Bits column had been discontinued in 2010, but was brought back in 2012, to again be discontinued in 2013.

===Sliver Box===
One of the &quot;Technique&quot;″s most popular features is the Sliver Box, an analogue of the Vent feature of the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;, which allows readers to submit any comment they wish. Comments are submitted on the &quot;Technique&quot;″s website and as many Slivers that will fit appear in the week&#x27;s paper, usually in order of submission. Slivers are subject to minimal censorship, with only full names of non-public figures, personal information, and strong profanities typically removed or altered. Other entries are occasionally removed or truncated, usually in cases of spamming of the Sliver submission system. According to the paper, the Box is used to fill empty room left between advertisements in order to maintain a modular layout style. It is not uncommon for students to have conversations using the Sliver Box. Slivers were originally comments made by editorial board members during deadline night and were placed in narrow boxes (&quot;Slivers&quot;) at the bottom of each page. Comments made on deadline night and opinions of editorial board members still occasionally find their way into the Sliver Box.

==1995 refusal of Campus Crusade for Christ ad==
In 1995, Campus Crusade for Christ registered a complaint with the attorney general&#x27;s office protesting the paper&#x27;s refusal of its ad which included a picture of a young man captioned “a former homosexual, male prostitute and female impersonator.&quot; right around National Coming Out Day. The CCC argued that the refusal amounted to a state censorship, because administration was allegedly involved in the decision and that administration is considered a state agency. Following the AG&#x27;s opinion, the paper reluctantly agreed to run the ad, however, CCC withdrew the ad before it ran. People have sent in letters to the editor.

<text>Belfast West is a parliamentary constituency (seat) in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament. The current MP is Paul Maskey of Sinn Fein.

In 2017, it ranked the most secure of Northern Ireland&#x27;s 18 seats by percentage and/or numerical tally of its winning majority, followed by North Down and by North Antrim respectively.

==Boundaries==

1885–1918: In the Borough of Belfast, Smithfield ward, that part of St. Anne&#x27;s ward bounded on the north-west by a line drawn along the centre of Carrick Hill, that part of St. George&#x27;s ward lying to the north of a line drawn along the centre of Grosvenor Street and west of a line drawn along the centre of Durham Street, and the townlands of Ballymagarry and Ballymurphy in the parish of Shankill.

1922–1974: The County Borough of Belfast wards of Court, Falls, St. Anne&#x27;s, St. George&#x27;s, Smithfield, and Woodvale. The boundaries of these wards can be seen in Schedule 9 of the Report of the Boundary Commission (Ireland) on the Representation of the People Bill 1917 - redistribution of seats.

1974–1983: The County Borough of Belfast wards of Court, Falls, St Anne&#x27;s, St George&#x27;s, Smithfield, and Woodvale, and the Rural District of Lisburn electoral divisions of Andersonstown, Ballygammon, and Ladybrook.

1983–1997: The District of Belfast wards of Andersonstown, Ballygomartin, Central, Clonard, Court, Falls, Grosvenor, Highfield, Ladybrook, Milltown, North Howard, St James, Suffolk, and Whiterock.

1997–2010: The District of Belfast wards of Andersonstown, Beechmount, Clonard, Falls, Falls Park, Glencairn, Glencolin, Glen Road, Highfield, Ladybrook, Shankill, Upper Springfield, and Whiterock, and the District of Lisburn wards of Collin Glen, Kilwee, Poleglass, and Twinbrook.

2010–present: The District of Belfast wards of Andersonstown, Beechmount, Clonard, Falls, Falls Park, Glencairn, Glencolin, Glen Road, Highfield, Ladybrook, Shankill, Upper Springfield, and Whiterock, and the City of Lisburn wards of Collin Glen, Dunmurry, Kilwee, Poleglass, Twinbrook, and part of Derryaghy.

The seat was restored in 1922 (having been abolished for the 1918 general election) when as part of the establishment of the devolved Stormont Parliament for Northern Ireland, the number of MPs in the Westminster Parliament was drastically cut. In 1983 the Sandy Row and Donegall Road areas were removed leaving a seat centred on the west section of Belfast, though between 1983 and 1997 it included the area around the Docks on the north east side of the Lagan Estuary.

Prior to the 2010 general election, boundary changes added the Dunmurry ward and the northern part of Derriaghy ward to this seat. Following public consultation, the proposals were passed through Parliament via the Northern Ireland Parliamentary Constituencies Order. In an unprecedented move by a Boundary Commission, an electoral ward was split between constituencies following disquiet in parts of Derriaghy. This ward is now split between Belfast West and Lagan Valley.

==History ==

Belfast West has historically been the most nationalist of Belfast&#x27;s four constituencies, though it is only in the last few decades that the votes for unionist parties have plunged to tiny levels. The constituency is largely made of a long, slender, belt along the Falls Road and its suburban extensions, with three of the five wards from the staunchly unionist Shankill area now something of a bolt-on, with a several kilometre (miles) long peace line dividing them from the rest of the constituency. There is also a smaller Protestant enclave at Suffolk.

The tenor of the constituency is largely working class and in the 1991 census it was one of only twenty constituencies where the majority of housing was still state owned. Although there are now large pockets of middle-class housing in Andersonstown and other suburban parts of the seat. Closer to the centre public-sector terraced housing, both Victorian and high quality modern housing, predominates, while in the suburbs, leafy pockets are scattered among post-War housing estates such as Lenadoon and Twinbrook.

The Westminster constituency was consistently held by the Ulster Unionist Party but always had strong Labour movement sympathies. In the 1923 UK general election, the Belfast Labour Party came within 1,000 votes of taking the seat. A by-election in 1943 was won by Jack Beattie, standing for the Northern Ireland Labour Party. For the next twenty-three years the seat would regularly change from unionist to nationalist/labour, with the latter represented by a variety of parties.

In the 1966 general election the seat was won by Gerry Fitt of the Republican Labour Party. Later in 1970 he left that party to become a founder and first leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party. In the February 1974 general election, Belfast West was the only constituency in Northern Ireland to elect an MP supporting the Sunningdale Agreement. Fitt&#x27;s majority was a narrow 2180 votes in February 1974 primarily due to the candidature of Albert Price, father of the Price sisters who were in prison in England for PIRA related offences. However the candidacy of a UVF backed candidate in October 1974 and a declining Unionist vote in 1979 led to him increasing his majorities in subsequent years. He retained the seat for the next nine years but increasingly distanced himself from nationalist groups and in late 1979 he left the SDLP altogether. He sat as an independent socialist but lost his seat in the 1983 General Election when it was won by Gerry Adams of Sinn Féin. The Unionist vote which had still been at 30% in the 1982 Assembly elections was cut to 20% as a result of the 1983 boundary changes which, while adding the loyalist Glencairn area, removed the Donegall Road, Sandy Row and added the Nationalist Lenadoon area.

Adams&#x27; share of the vote, at 37%, was short of a majority and he achieved victory only due to Fitt and the SDLP candidate splitting the non-Sinn Féin vote. In 1987 Adams narrowly held his seat, but lost it in the 1992 general election amidst a strong tactical voting campaign in favour of Joe Hendron of the Social Democratic and Labour Party by unionists in the Shankill Road area of the constituency. After the election a constituent, Maura McCrory, lodged an election petition challenging the result. The election court reported Hendron personally guilty of the illegal practice of failing to deliver a declaration verifying the return of his election expenses, and guilty through his election agent of failing to deliver a verified return of election expenses within 35 days, exceeding the maximum spending by £782.02, and failing to pay all the expenses within 28 days. Hendron&#x27;s agent was also reported personally guilty of distributing election material without the name and address of the printer and publisher. The Judges granted both Hendron and his agent relief from their findings, on the grounds that the law had been broken through inadvertence; they therefore certified that Hendron had been duly elected.

In the mid-1990s the Boundary Commission originally suggested removing the Shankill wards from the constituency and replacing them with about half of the Belfast South constituency namely the 6 wards of the Balmoral Electoral Area and the Shaftesbury ward, effectively transforming the seat into a Belfast South West constituency.

The subsequent local enquiries were bitterly contested with the SDLP favouring the commission&#x27;s original proposals which would add an area where Sinn Féin had little support (and aside from the Shaftesbury ward, had not contested in council elections), while Sinn Féin argued instead for adding the mostly republican Twinbrook and Poleglass estates (where they were outpolling the SDLP in council elections by a margin of 3 to 1). With all parties except the SDLP supporting an option of retaining four seats in Belfast the latter option became the commissions final proposals and the Shankill wards remained in the constituency.

The boundary changes, coupled with the IRA ceasefire, meant that support for Sinn Féin in the constituency soared to new levels and in all elections held in the seat since 1996 they have taken over 50% of the vote. In 1997 Adams regained the seat and held it in 2001, 2005 and 2010. In 2011, Adams decided to stand in the 2011 Republic of Ireland general election and vacated his seat.

In the 2016 referendum to leave the European Union, the constituency voted remain by 74.1%.

== Members of Parliament ==

The Member of Parliament since a 2011 by-election is Paul Maskey of Sinn Féin, who succeeded Gerry Adams, the party president. Adams previously held the seat from 1983 to 1992 when he lost it to Joe Hendron of the Social Democratic and Labour Party but regained it in 1997.

In November 2010, Adams announced his intention to contest the imminent election in the Republic of Ireland. Although the Disqualifications Act 2000 permits MPs to sit in Dáil Éireann, he submitted a letter of resignation to the Speaker in January 2011. However, the prescribed procedure for vacating a parliamentary seat involves applying for the post of Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead, which he had &quot;no intention&quot; of doing. Thus he was still considered to hold the seat. On 26 January, HM Treasury announced that Adams had been appointed as Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead. The Prime Minister, David Cameron, claimed that Adams had applied for the appointment, but this was later clarified to state that he had not requested the appointment. Adams stated the Prime Minister&#x27;s private secretary had apologised to him for making the announcement that Adams had &#x27;accepted&#x27; the position, when in fact Adams&#x27; resignation letter was taken to be a request to be so appointed, whatever his own wishes.

<text>A territorial collectivity (, previously &#x27;), orterritorial authority, in many francophone countries, is a legal entity governed by public law that exercises within its territory certain powers devolved to it by the State as part of a decentralization process. In France, it also refers to a chartered administrative division of France with recognized governing authority. It is the generic name for any territory with an elective form of local government and local regulatory authority. The nature of a French territorial collectivity is set forth in Article 72 of the Constitution of France (1958), which provides for local autonomy within limits prescribed by law.

== Overview ==

=== Use of the term ===
The term &quot;collectivité territoriale&quot; is used in Burkina Faso, in France by its legislation and the Constitution, in Mali and in Morocco.

In Algeria and Senegal, they refer to it as &quot;collectivité locale&quot;. However, in France, it is also used by the State administration: the &quot;Direction Générale des Collectivités Locales&quot; deals with matters relating to local authorities.

In English-speaking countries, the term used is &quot;local government&quot; or &quot;local government area&quot;, and in German is &quot;Gebietskörperschaft&quot;.

=== Characteristics ===
Territorial authorities have legal status. They are often administered by a deliberative assembly, which may be elected by direct universal suffrage. Depending on local legislation, they may levy local taxes and receive funds from the State.

== Categories ==
*Regions: France has 18 regions, or 14 not including single territorial collectivities (collectivities with special status).
*Departments: France has 94 departments as territorial collectivities (most recently the merger of the territorial collectivities of Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin to form the European Collectivity of Alsace). However, the word is also used for the 101 territorial divisions of the State administration, which in most cases cover the same area as territorial collectivities.
*Collectivities with special status: this status is awarded by specific laws to 6 collectivities which replace departments and regions (Corsica, French Guiana, Greater Lyon, Martinique, Mayotte, and Paris).
*Overseas collectivities (&quot;&quot;, COM): France has five COMs.
*Provinces: There are 3 provinces, all in New Caledonia.
*Communes: There are 36,782 communes. They are found throughout the republic (except for Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Wallis and Futuna, which are subdivided differently, as well as uninhabited Clipperton Island, which is directly administered by the office of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Overseas France).

==Administration==
*The assembly of a &quot;région&quot; and of a ROM is the regional council (&quot;conseil régional&quot;). They are presided over by a president of the regional council (&quot;président du conseil régional&quot;).
** Corsica&#x27;s assembly is called the &quot;assemblée de Corse&quot; (Corsican Assembly) that exercises some Corsican autonomy. It is also presided over by the president of the regional council.
*The assembly of a &quot;département&quot; (except Paris) or that of a DOM is called a &quot;conseil départemental&quot;. It is presided over by a &quot;président du conseil départemental&quot;.
*The assembly of a province is called an &quot;assemblée de province&quot;. It is presided over by a &quot;président de l&#x27;assemblée de province&quot;.
*A commune&#x27;s assembly (except that of Paris) is called a &quot;conseil municipal&quot;. It is presided over by a mayor (&quot;maire&quot;).
** The Paris assembly is called the &quot;conseil de Paris&quot;. It is also presided over by a mayor.
*The Assembly of French Polynesia is presided over by the &quot;président de la Polynésie française&quot;.
*Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, and Saint Pierre and Miquelon&#x27;s assemblies are called &quot;conseil territorial&quot;. Each of these is presided over by a &quot;président du conseil territorial&quot;.
*Wallis and Futuna&#x27;s assembly is called an &quot;assemblée territoriale&quot;. It is presided over by the prefect (&quot;préfet&quot;).
*New Caledonia&#x27;s assembly is called a &quot;congrès&quot;. It is presided over by the &quot;président du gouvernement&quot;.

== Past and future territorial collectivities ==
*The category of overseas territory (&quot;territoires d&#x27;outre-mer&quot;) was eliminated under the constitutional reform of 28 March 2003. French Southern Territories is still a &quot;TOM&quot;, but this is now a particular designation, not a category. This uninhabited territory no longer is a &quot;collectivité territoriale&quot;.
*Mayotte and Saint Pierre and Miquelon used to be &quot;collectivités territoriales&quot; belonging to no category (but with a status close to that of a &quot;DOM&quot;), sometimes unofficially called &quot;collectivité territoriale à statut particulier&quot;, or &quot;collectivité territoriale d&#x27;outre-mer&quot;.
*Mayotte held a vote in 2009 to change its status, and it became a &quot;ROM&quot; in 2011.
*Guadeloupians and Réunionnais have refused to eliminate their &quot;ROM&quot; and &quot;DOM&quot; in order to create a unique &quot;collectivité territoriale&quot;.
*The European Collectivity of Alsace became effective on the first day of 2021.

== Territorial authorities and European institutions ==
The Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe is a pan-European political assembly made up of 648 regional and municipal councillors, mayors and regional presidents, elected for four-year terms. It represents 200,000 territorial authorities in 47 European countries, including France&#x27;s 36,000 communes. As the voice of territorial authorities, towns and regions, the Congress is responsible for strengthening local and regional democracy in its 47 member states by promoting consultation and political dialogue between governments and territorial authorities. To this end, it cooperates with the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. The work of the Congress is structured around its two chambers, the Chamber of Local Authorities and the Chamber of Regions, and is organized around three statutory committees: a Monitoring Committee, a Governance Committee and a Current Affairs Committee.

== Sustainable development applied to territorial authorities ==
In June 1992, at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, a plan of action for the 21st century called Agenda 21 was adopted, applying to territorial authorities, regions, départements, communities of communes or municipalities. The action plan was divided into 40 chapters, with a preamble and four sections. It includes recommendations in areas as varied as poverty, health, housing, pollution, the management of seas, forests and mountains, desertification, the management of water resources and sanitation, agricultural management and waste management.

Most French regions have an Agenda 21. Taking all territorial authorities together, there were 1128 local agendas listed in France in 2017.

==Other facts==
*New Caledonia is the only French local government that is not a &quot;collectivité territoriale&quot;. It has its own articles in the French Constitution. Since it cannot be categorized, it is sometimes unofficially called a &quot;collectivité sui generis&quot; (although &quot;collectivity&quot; is not, strictly speaking, a legal category). It is also unofficially called a &quot;pays (d&#x27;outre-mer)&quot;, because its local legislative assembly (the congress) can rule using its own &quot;lois du pays&quot;. New Caledonia voted in 1987, 2018, 2020 and 2021 to reject independence and maintain its current status of large autonomy gained from the national constitutional referendum of 1988.
*Corsica became the first &quot;collectivité territoriale unique&quot; that is within metropolitan France starting on 1 January 2018, with new territorial elections held as a result.
*The &quot;régions&quot; are divided into &quot;départements&quot;: &quot;ROMs&quot; are divided into &quot;DOMs&quot;; New Caledonia is divided into &quot;provinces&quot;; &quot;départements&quot;, &quot;COMs&quot; (except Saint Barthélemy, Saint-Martin, and Wallis and Futuna), &quot;DOMs&quot;, and &quot;provinces&quot; all are divided into &quot;communes&quot;.
*The &quot;commune&quot; of Poya is the only French subdivision assigned to two upper-level units (the &quot;provinces&quot; of North and South).
*Paris and some overseas entities belong to two categories. 
** Paris is both a &quot;département&quot; and a &quot;commune&quot;. It has one mayor and one assembly.
** French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and Réunion are both &quot;ROM&quot; and &quot;DOM&quot;. Guadeloupe and Réunion each have two presidents and two assemblies, while French Guiana, Martinique and Mayotte each have a single assembly.
*Each &quot;COM&quot; has its own statutory law that gives it a particular designation:
** French Polynesia is designated as a &quot;pays d&#x27;outre-mer&quot;,
** Saint Barthélemy and Saint Martin as &quot;collectivités&quot;, 
** Saint Pierre and Miquelon as a &quot;collectivité territoriale&quot;, and 
** Wallis and Futuna as a &quot;territoire&quot;.

<text>Double Dare is an American television game show, produced by Mark Goodson &amp; Bill Todman, that ran from 1976 to 1977 on CBS. The main game pitted two contestants in isolation booths attempting to correctly identify a person, place, or thing based on one-sentence clues. The bonus round then pitted the champion of the main game against a panel of three Ph.Ds, referred to as the &quot;Spoilers&quot;. Alex Trebek was the host, with Johnny Olson and later Gene Wood announcing. The show was created by Jay Wolpert.

==Gameplay==

===Main game===
Two contestants, typically a returning champion and a challenger, sat in separate isolation booths. They attempted to identify a subject based on one-sentence clues that were given to them, one at a time, on an electronic gameboard. Before the first clue was given, the correct response was shown to the home audience and the host stated the general category (person, place, etc.). A maximum of 10 clues were played per subject, typically starting with obscure pieces of trivia and progressing toward more widely-known facts.

Either contestant could buzz in at any time to guess the subject, and doing so closed off the opponent&#x27;s booth so that he/she could not see or hear anything. A correct guess won $50 for the contestant, while a miss closed his/her own booth and gave the opponent a chance to see the next clue (referred to as a &quot;penalty clue&quot;) and offer a guess unopposed. If the opponent also missed, both booths were opened and play resumed with the next clue after the penalty.

When a contestant correctly identified a subject on a buzz-in, he/she was shown the next clue in sequence and could dare the opponent to answer. When a contestant gave the answer on a penalty clue, it was used for the dare since the opponent had not yet seen it. If the contestant chose to dare, the opponent&#x27;s booth was opened and he/she had five seconds to study the clue before guessing. A correct answer awarded $50 to the opponent; a miss awarded $100 to the daring contestant, closed the opponent&#x27;s booth again, and gave the contestant a chance to offer a double dare based on the next clue. A correct answer on a double dare awarded $100 to the opponent, and a miss awarded $200 to the double-daring contestant.

Play on a particular subject ended after any of the following occurred:

* A contestant identified the subject, but chose not to dare
* A contestant successfully dared the opponent, but chose not to double dare
* An opponent correctly identified the subject on a dare
* A double dare was played
* Neither contestant identified the subject after all 10 clues were played

In either of the first two cases, the clue for the dare or double dare was read to the opponent to see if he/she would have been able to guess the subject.

The first contestant to accrue $500 or more won the game and moved on to the bonus round. Both contestants kept their accrued money, and the runner-up of each game also received parting gifts.

===Beat the Spoilers===
The winner of the main game competed in a bonus round against the Spoilers, a panel of three Ph.Ds placed in separate isolation booths so that they could not see or hear each other. The booths were turned off to begin the round.

The gameboard displayed a subject and eight numbered clues (10 in the pilot) in random order of difficulty, and was placed so that the Spoilers could not see it. The contestant selected one clue at a time and, after seeing and hearing it, had to decide whether to pass it or give it to the Spoilers. He/she could pass up to four times (five in the pilot), and these clues were immediately discarded from play. If the contestant decided to give a clue to the Spoilers, their booths were turned on long enough for Trebek to read it to them; he also announced the general category to them before reading the first given clue. The booths were then turned on, one at a time, so that each Spoiler could guess the subject without being heard by the others. Each incorrect answer awarded $100 to the contestant, while a correct answer awarded the money to that Spoiler, who then sat out the rest of the round with his/her booth open so as to hear the remaining clues and the others&#x27; guesses.

The round continued as long as at least one Spoiler failed to guess correctly. If all three Spoilers managed to identify the subject, the contestant lost the round but kept any money accumulated to that point from incorrect guesses. If any of the Spoilers were unable to identify the subject after the fourth (fifth in the pilot) given clue, the contestant&#x27;s winnings for the round were increased to $5,000.

===Limits on champions&#x27; winnings===
Champions stayed on the show until either defeated or surpassing CBS&#x27;s maximum winnings limit which, for this show, was $20,000 at that time.

Alan Lusher was the only contestant to retire as champion. He crossed the $20,000 threshold with a victory in the main game, then won a further $300 in the bonus round for a final winnings total of $20,500.

==Broadcast history==
&quot;Double Dare&quot; premiered on December 13, 1976, and replaced &quot;Gambit&quot; on CBS&#x27; daytime lineup at 11:00 AM Pacific (10:00 Central) following &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;. Facing NBC&#x27;s popular two-year-old &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, it did not draw the audience &quot;Gambit&quot; had. On March 7, 1977, &quot;Double Dare&quot; shifted back one hour from its original time slot in order to accommodate the hour-long &quot;Price Is Right&quot; taking the 10:30 AM timeslot. CBS saw no further success for the show at the earlier hour and decided to cancel &quot;Double Dare&quot; after 20 weeks and 96 total episodes. The final episode aired on April 29, 1977.

===Miscellaneous===
Jay Wolpert was acknowledged as the series&#x27; creator in the closing credits. Wolpert later created his own production company. This series also marked the debut of Jonathan Goodson as a producer.

Markie Post was an employee of Goodson-Todman at the time and was an associate producer on &quot;Double Dare&quot;.

Virtually all of the show&#x27;s music and sounds were recycled for other Goodson-Todman shows. The show&#x27;s theme music, composed by Edd Kalehoff (who coincidently composed the theme for another game show called Double Dare) for Score Productions, was reused one year later for &quot;Card Sharks&quot;. The sound effect for the opening of the clue board and the isolation booths was later used for &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;″s Penny Ante and Vend-O-Price pricing games, as well as the bonus round level &quot;wind-up&quot; sound on the Jack Barry-produced game show &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot;. A truncated version of the &quot;losing horns&quot; from &quot;Price&quot; was also used for bonus round losses.

The show&#x27;s taping alternated between Studios 31, 33 and 41 at CBS Television City in Hollywood, California, during its run.

==Episode status==
All episodes are reported to exist. Reruns of the series aired on Game Show Network from 1996 to 1997, as well as in several one-off airings between 1998 and 2000, then returned to the regular schedule later in the decade, airing from 2007 to 2009.

Buzzr, an American digital broadcast television network owned by Fremantle, then aired several episodes of &quot;Double Dare&quot;, including one of the 1976 pilot episodes, as part of its &quot;Buzzr Lost and Found&quot; special in September 2015. The series later won a slot on the network&#x27;s Sunday night lineup that year by viewer vote through their Pick &amp; Play Sweepstakes, and two episodes then aired Sundays at 10 PM (PST) until 2017.

The first 20 episodes of the series (dubbed the &quot;76 &amp; 77&quot; collection) were made available on Amazon Prime Video in North America.

==In popular culture==
A clip from the finale, where sexually-suggestive clues to &quot;a boomerang&quot; were presented, appeared on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Game Show Moments Gone Bananas&quot; in 2005.

<doc id="864084" wikidata="Q2891642" url="?curid=864084" title="Batsugun">
<text>is a 1993 vertically scrolling bullet hell arcade video game originally developed and published by Toaplan in Japan and Europe by Taito, as well as Korea by Unite Trading. The last shoot &#x27;em up created by Toaplan, the title takes place on a distant Earth-like planet where a global takeover operative led by king Renoselva A. Gladebaran VII is set into motion, as players assume the role from one of the six fighter pilots conforming the Skull Hornets squadron taking control of submersible jets in a last-ditch effort to overthrow the invading military force from the planet. Its gameplay mainly consists of shooting mixed with role-playing game-esque elements using a main two-button configuration.

Headed by &quot;Fire Shark&quot; designer Yuko Tataka, &quot;Batsugun&quot; was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Toaplan and who would later go on to join one of its offshoots after the company declared bankruptcy in 1994 to continue working in the bullet hell sub-genre. Though first launched for the arcades, the game was later ported to the Sega Saturn by Gazelle and published exclusively in Japan by Banpresto on 25 October 1996, featuring various changes and additions compared with the original version.

&quot;Batsugun&quot; garnered positive reception from during its initial release in arcades but was later met with mixed critical reception on the Saturn as an import title. Nevertheless, the game garnered awards from &quot;Gamest&quot; magazine. It has been heralded by many as the first manic shooter due to its evolution of various gameplay features in the shoot &#x27;em up genre and as an inspiration for other similar titles. As of 2019, the rights to the project are owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in 2017 by former Toaplan member Masahiro Yuge and now-subsidiary of Swedish video game and media holding company, Embracer Group, alongside many other Toaplan IPs.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Batsugun&quot; is a science fiction-themed vertically scrolling bullet hell game where players assume the role of one of the six Skull Hornets pilots taking control of their respective fighter jets through five increasingly difficult levels in a last-ditch effort to overthrow a global takeover led by the army of king Renoselva A. Gladebaran VII as the main objective. The title initially appears to be standard; players control their craft over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a boss is reached. Players also have only two weapons at their disposal: the main gun that travels a max distance of the screen&#x27;s height and three bombs capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its blast radius.

A unique gameplay feature is the weapon system; as enemies are destroyed, players gain experience points that are separate from the score and for every experience points gained, the main gun is leveled up and becomes much stronger. This is analogous to exp and levelling up in role-playing games. The weapon can only level up twice and after achieving its maximum level, experience points will grant players an extra bomb stock instead. In addition, player can also grab &quot;P&quot; icons to increase the power of the current level gun. A maximum of five &quot;P&quot; icons can be collected per experience level and getting more after this gives extra points instead, while collecting &quot;B&quot; icons increases the number of bomb stock to a maximum of seven. Another gameplay feature, reminiscent of &quot;Aero Fighters&quot;, is the ability to choose between three fighter ship variations: Sky Mirage (type A), Dragon&#x27;s Whisper (type B) and Judgement Flasher (type C). Type A ships have a simple array of rapid-fire energy-beams that spread evenly. Type B ships shoot a straight beam of lightning for as long as the fire button is held, while tapping the button causes sparks to appear and travel along the beam. Lastly, Type C ships are adaptable; holding the fire button shoot energy waves straight, while tapping the button fires a spread of projectiles. Each ship type becomes more powerful by leveling up.

There are multiple scoring methods for reaching high-scores to obtain extra lives in the game apart from destroying enemies, which are awarded at one million points. Points can be gained from collecting V-shaped gold medals and once the level is finished, points are awarded for every type of medal collected. Firing or bombing on determined locations is also crucial to reach high-scores, as certain setpieces in some stages hosts bonus secrets within their scenery, as well as destroying enemies on certain spots. The game employs a respawn system where a downed single player will start off immediately at the location they died at. Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a life, as well as a penalty of decreasing the ship&#x27;s firepower to its original state, in addition of all medals collected and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the player inserts more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. Unlike previous shoot &#x27;em ups titles from Toaplan, there are no additional loops after completing the last stage.

== Plot ==
The plot summary of &quot;Batsugun&quot; is explained through supplementary materials. On a distant planet similar to Earth, a global takeover codenamed Epsilon Plan led by king Renoselva A. Gladebaran VII is set into motion, with the Imperial Army successfully staging multiple coup d&#x27;états upon countries of the planet in less than two weeks. All that stands between the military forces of Renoselva and world domination are the Skull Hornets: a squadron of fighter pilots led by prince Olisis R. Gladebaran VIII, son of Renoselva. The Skull Hornets utilize the most powerful submersible jets the planet&#x27;s scientists have ever devised.

=== Characters ===
* Jeeno: Pilot of the Type A (P1) ship, he is a teenage soldier with cybernetic implants by Dr. Gabriel and a tragic past.
* Schneider: Pilot of the Type A (P2) ship and a war veteran who was previously cryogenized and is the main protagonist of &quot;Flying Shark&quot;.
* Beltiana: Pilot of the Type B (P1) ship and a young woman who seeks to avenge the death of her brother.
* Alteeno: Pilot of the Type B (P2) ship, he is a tomboyish mechanic of the Skull Hornets squadron and a child prodigy.
* Iceman: Pilot of the Type C (P1) ship and a hired mercenary with a turbulent past.
* Olisis: Pilot of the Type C (P2) ship. Founder and director of the Skull Hornets squadron, he is the exiled prince of his home planet and fights to dethrone his father Renoselva.

== Development ==

&quot;Batsugun&quot; was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Toaplan such as &quot;Grind Stormer&quot; and who would later go on to join one of its offshoots after the company declared bankruptcy in 1994 to continue working in the bullet hell sub-genre. Its development was helmed by a small group at the company and most of the members had several roles during this process, with &quot;Fire Shark&quot; designer Yuko Tataka acting as both producer and co-designer alongside artists Junya Inoue and Takeshi Kawamoto. Cave co-founder Tsuneki Ikeda served as one of its programmers prior to &quot;DonPachi&quot; alongside Satoshi Kōyama, Seiji Iwakura and composer Yoshitatsu Sakai. Both Ikeda and Inoue have stated that several games from other companies that were popular at the time served as influence early in development.

== Release ==
&quot;Batsugun&quot; was first launched in arcades worldwide by Toaplan, Taito and Unite Trading in 1993. During the same year, a soundtrack album containing music from the title was co-published exclusively in Japan by Scitron and Pony Canyon. Several promotional materials were also released by Toaplan.

A second edition, titled &quot;Batsugun Special Version&quot;, was showcased to attendees at the 1994 AOU Show in Japan but was never officially released in arcades, as Toaplan slid into bankruptcy and this special version appeared on the secondary video game collecting market after the company vanished. The special version featured a number of changes compared to the original version including a much smaller hitbox, a shield protecting the player from one hit, more powerful bombs, new scoring items, and the addition of multiple loops of increasing difficulty after completing the initial loop, among other changes.

On 25 October 1996, &quot;Batsugun&quot; received a conversion to the Sega Saturn by Gazelle, an offshoot of Toaplan, and published exclusively in Japan by Banpresto. The Saturn version featured various changes and additions such as the inclusion of both the original and special versions as a 2-in-1 package, as well as an arranged soundtrack. 

In 2022, the original arcade version was included as part of the Sega Astro City Mini V, a vertically-oriented variant of the Sega Astro City mini console. In 2023, the Saturn version was ported to Playstation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC under the title &quot;Batsugun Saturn Tribute Boosted&quot;. This modern version includes new features such as a &quot;Boost Up HUD&quot; which displays extra information and an increased maximum score. In 2024 &quot;Batsugun&quot; was released on PC through Steam. The port and new features were handled by Bitwave Games.
In November 2024 both Batsugun and Batsugun Special Version are to be included on the Toaplan Arcade Collection 3 cartridge for the Evercade system.

== EXA Label ==
In June 2023, Batsugun EXA Label was released in arcades by exA-Arcadia. Besides including the existing Original Arcade and Special modes, a Special&#x27; (Special Dash) mode is included which condenses the original Special 4-loop mode into a 1-loop mode. A newly created mode called EXA Label focuses on scoring and bomb usage while allowing the player to select from all pilots instead of being restricted to a set of 3 pilots. Input lag has been decreased to 1 frame. All pilots are now voiced and a new arranged soundtrack by Keishi Yonao has been added. The original character designer, Junya Inoue, created new illustrations for this release.

== Reception ==
&quot;Batsugun&quot; was met with positive reception during its initial release in arcades. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed it on their February 1, 1994 issue as being the seventh most-popular arcade game at the time. In the April 1994 issue of Japanese publication &quot;Micom BASIC Magazine&quot;, the game was ranked on the number nine spot in popularity. &quot;Gamest&quot; simultaneously awarded the title with both the 6th &quot;Best Shooting&quot; and 36th &quot;Best Character &#x27;94&quot; awards. Nick Zverloff of &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot; praised Inoue and Sakai&#x27;s artwork and soundtrack respectively, among other aspects.

The Sega Saturn conversion received mixed reviews from critics such as &quot;Famitsu&quot; and the Japanese &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot;. According to &quot;Famitsu&quot;, the Saturn version sold over 7,017 copies in its first week on the market. Readers of the Japanese &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; voted to give the Saturn port a 8.4 out of 10 score, ranking at the number 245 spot, indicating a large popular following. &quot;Edge&quot; reviewed the Saturn version, deeming it &quot;not a classic in designs terms, perhaps, but one that won&#x27;t disappoint those yearning a show-off 2D title&quot;. French magazine &quot;Joypad&quot; commended the Saturn released for its boss encounters, arsenal, multiplayer and game modes, stating that &quot;taken from the arcade game of the same name, this Saturn shoot&#x27;em-up isn&#x27;t just another shoot, it&#x27;s the game to own if you want to see how the genre has evolved today&quot;. Christian Blendl of German magazine &quot;MAN!AC&quot; gave the Saturn an overall mixed outlook. Zverloff of &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot; criticized some of the additions in the Saturn conversion such as the arranged soundtrack.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Batsugun&quot; has been regarded by multiple publications as the first manic shooter due to its evolution of complex enemy waves, bullet patterns, firepower and hitbox. Mark R. Johnson, an author at The University of Sydney in Australia, noted that its first boss unveiled a number of on-screen bullets players never witnessed before. In addition, the game was also cited as an inspiration for other titles in the shoot &#x27;em up genre since its release such as &quot;Cho Ren Sha 68K&quot; and &quot;Eschatos&quot;.

After the initial launch of &quot;Batsugun&quot;, Toaplan would cease development of shooting projects prior to their closure on March 31, 1994. A sequel was planned but never released, although Inoue stated that the idea of gender-based firepower pairing envisionsed for the title was integrated into &quot;Progear&quot;. In more recent years, the rights to the title and many other IPs from Toaplan are now owned by Tatsujin, a company named after &quot;Truxton&quot;″s Japanese title that was founded in 2017 by Masahiro Yuge, and is part of Embracer Group since 2022.

<doc id="864090" wikidata="Q7430081" url="?curid=864090" title="Scanning voltage microscopy">
<text>Scanning voltage microscopy (SVM), sometimes also called nanopotentiometry, is a scientific experimental technique based on atomic force microscopy. A conductive probe, usually only a few nanometers wide at the tip, is placed in full contact with an operational electronic or optoelectronic sample. By connecting the probe to a high-impedance voltmeter and rastering over the sample&#x27;s surface, a map of the electric potential can be acquired. SVM is generally nondestructive to the sample although some damage may occur to the sample or the probe if the pressure required to maintain good electrical contact is too high. If the input impedance of the voltmeter is sufficiently large, the SVM probe should not perturb the operation of the operational sample.

==Applications==
SVM is particularly well suited to analyzing microelectronic devices (such as transistors or diodes) or quantum electronic devices (such as quantum well diode lasers) directly because nanometer spatial resolution is possible. SVM can also be used to verify theoretical simulation of complex electronic devices.

For example, the potential profile across the quantum well structure of a diode laser can be mapped and analyzed; such a profile could indicate the electron and hole distributions where light is generated and could lead to improved laser designs.

==Scanning gate microscopy==
In a similar technique, scanning gate microscopy (SGM), the probe is oscillated at some natural frequency some fixed distance above the sample with an applied voltage relative to the sample. The image is constructed from the X,Y position of the probe and the conductance of the sample, with no significant current passing through the probe, which acts as a local gate. The image is interpreted as a map of the sample&#x27;s sensitivity to gate voltage. A lock-in amplifier aids noise reduction by filtering through only the amplitude oscillations that match the probe&#x27;s vibration frequency. Applications include imaging defect sites in carbon nanotubes and doping profiles in nanowires.

<doc id="864092" wikidata="Q11777662" url="?curid=864092" title="Metaplot">
<text>The metaplot (also, metastory) is the overarching storyline that binds together events in the official continuity of a published role-playing game campaign setting, also defined as an &quot;evolving history of a given fictional universe&quot;. Major official story events that change the world, or simply move important non-player characters from one place to another, are part of the metaplot for a game. Metaplot information is usually included within gaming products such as rule books and modules as they are released. Major events in the metaplot are often used to explain changes in the rules in between versions of the games, as was the case with the Time of Judgment in White Wolf&#x27;s World of Darkness and the Time of Troubles and the Sundering for TSR&#x27;s/Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;. Because of events like this, many gaming groups choose to ignore the metaplot for a game entirely.

Metaplot is often developed not just by the writers, but by teams - multiple writers, editors, publishers, graphic designers and even players. The concept is related to more than just role-playing sourcebooks, as much of the metaplot can come from other media, such as novels (for example, &quot;The Legend of Drizzt&quot; or the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; novels, representative of numerous &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fiction). For the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; this was the case only after its inception, while it was part of the design from the start for the &quot;Dark Sun&quot; setting. For campaign settings based on movies, TV shows or other pieces of fiction, the plot of those works usually functions as the metaplot, while for historical settings history itself may fill this role.

Metaplot appears in settings of various genres like &quot;The Dark Eye&quot;, &quot;Deadlands&quot;, &quot;Dragonlance&quot;, &quot;Fading Suns&quot;, &quot;Legend of the Five Rings&quot;, and &quot;Shadowrun&quot;.

==Reception==
The metaplot is meant to &quot;give the players a sense of immersion in a large and complex world as well as an aesthetic appreciation of the story they were witnessing&quot; whenever their characters come into contact with it. The narrative tool of metaplot has been criticised for shifting the focus away from the player characters and making them &quot;marginal rather than central figures&quot;.

Role-playing game designer Jasmin Neitzel commented that metaplot could facilitate constructive interaction of players with a game setting within and beyond individual gaming groups, but could be a hindrance in getting beyond harmful stereotypes used in past products.

Olaf Pajączkowski notes that the metaplot constraints reduce the freedom of writers, who have to respect the history and present events in the universe (as many books are set in the present), and they cannot &quot;break the world&quot;. Pajączkowski gives an example of Elaine Cunningham&#x27;s novel &quot;Reclamation&quot; which was cancelled because the metaplot evolved changing the world (a 100-year jump) making her book &#x27;obsolete&#x27;, and the publisher decided it&#x27;s not worth finishing as it was no longer set in the &quot;present&quot; of the evolving &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; universe.

<text>Alan Reed (born Herbert Theodore Bergman; August 20, 1907 – June 14, 1977) was an American actor, best known as the original voice of Fred Flintstone on &quot;The Flintstones&quot; and various spinoff series. He also appeared in many films, including &quot;Days of Glory&quot;, &quot;The Tarnished Angels&quot;, &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Viva Zapata!&quot; and &quot;Nob Hill&quot;, as well as several television and radio series.

==Early years==
Alan Reed was born Herbert Theodore Bergman on August 20, 1907, in New York City to Jewish parents. His father was a Lithuanian-Jewish immigrant and his mother was born in the United States to Ukrainian-Jewish parents from Galicia. He attended George Washington High School (now George Washington Educational Campus) and majored in journalism at Columbia University. 

Between graduating from WHS and entering Columbia, he studied drama at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He began his acting career in the city, eventually working on Broadway.

For several years, Reed toured in vaudeville with his cousin, Harry Green. He also had two other jobs—operating a wholesale candy factory and working at the Copake Country Club as &quot;social director, entertainment producer and actor&quot;.

==Career==
===Radio===
As early as 1930, Reed (billed as Teddy Bergman) co-starred with Herbert Polesie in &quot;Henry and George&quot;, a CBS program that featured &quot;minute dramas, popular laughmakers ... interspersed with dance music selections&quot;.

Reed&#x27;s radio work included having two roles in &quot;Valiant Lady&quot;, the role of Solomon Levy on &quot;Abie&#x27;s Irish Rose&quot;, as the &quot;Allen&#x27;s Alley&quot; resident poet Falstaff Openshaw on Fred Allen&#x27;s NBC radio show, and later on his own five-minute show, &quot;Falstaff&#x27;s Fables&quot;, on ABC, as Officer Clancey and other occasional roles on the NBC radio show &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot;, as Shrevey the driver on several years of &quot;The Shadow&quot;, as Chester Riley&#x27;s boss on the NBC radio show &quot;The Life of Riley&quot;, as Italian immigrant Pasquale in &quot;Life with Luigi&quot; on CBS radio, various supporting roles on &quot;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar&quot; and &quot;The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show&quot;, and as Lt. Walter Levinson in several episodes of &quot;Richard Diamond, Private Detective&quot;.

Reed was &quot;heard regularly on the &quot;Crime Doctor&quot; series,&quot; and &quot;was the original Daddy to Fanny Brice on &quot;Baby Snooks&quot;&quot;. Billed as Teddy Bergman, he had the title role on &quot;Joe Palooka&quot;. Reed also regularly appeared on the show &quot;Life With Luigi&quot; as included Pasquale, another Italian immigrant who is always trying to trap Luigi into marrying his daughter Rosa.

===Stage===
Billed as Teddy Bergman, Reed appeared on Broadway in &quot;Double Dummy&quot; (1936), and &quot;A House in the Country&quot; (1937), and &quot;Love&#x27;s Old Sweet Song&quot; (1940).

===Film===
&quot;Porky&#x27;s Romance&quot;; &quot;Days of Glory&quot;; &quot;Nob Hill&quot;; &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot;; &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;; &quot;Emergency Wedding&quot;; &quot;The Redhead and the Cowboy&quot;; &quot;Here Comes the Groom&quot;; &quot;Viva Zapata!&quot;; &quot;Pickup on South Street&quot;; &quot;I, the Jury&quot;.

===Television===
From 1957 to 1958, Reed appeared in a recurring role as J.B. Hafter, a studio boss, on the CBS sitcom &quot;Mr. Adams and Eve&quot;. He also played the same character in &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot;. In 1963, he appeared as Councilman Jack Gramby in episode 8 of the CBS sitcom &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot;. In 1964–65, he had a recurring role as Mr. Swidler in the ABC sitcom &quot;Mickey&quot;.

===Voice acting===
In animation, Reed provided the voice of Boris the Russian Wolfhound in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; in 1955. In 1960, he began the voice role for Fred Flintstone, the lead character of Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s prime-time animated series &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. Reed provided Fred&#x27;s voice for the entire six-season run of the show, as well as in several spin-off series (&quot;The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show&quot;, &quot;The Flintstone Comedy Hour&quot;) and specials. His final performance as Fred Flintstone was a cameo guest role on an episode of &quot;Scooby&#x27;s All-Star Laff-A-Lympics.&quot; Afterwards, Fred would be voiced by Henry Corden (who had previously done voice work for Hanna-Barbera and bore a striking resemblance to Reed). Reed&#x27;s other voice roles for Hanna-Barbera was Touché Turtle&#x27;s sidekick, Dum Dum.

Radio playwright and director Norman Corwin cast Reed as Santa Claus in the 1969 KCET television reading of his 1938 play &quot;The Plot to Overthrow Christmas&quot;.

In television commercials Reed was the voice over for J.J. Keebler, a creation of the Leo Burnett Agency.

==Personal life==
In May 1932, Reed married Finette Walker (1909–2005), a Broadway actress whom he met at television station W2XAB (later WCBS-TV) in New York City. She appeared on stage in the early 1930s and was a chorus member in the original 1934 Broadway production of &quot;Anything Goes&quot; with Ethel Merman. They had three sons, including actor Alan Reed, Jr. (born 1936).

==Death==
Reed, a heavy smoker, was diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1967. The cancer was treated surgically, but he later developed emphysema. On June 14, 1977, he died at St. Vincent Medical Center (Los Angeles) after having a heart attack, two months before his 70th birthday.

<text>The 9K34 Strela-3 (, &#x27;arrow&#x27;, NATO reporting name: SA-14 Gremlin) is a man-portable air defense missile system (MANPADS) developed in the Soviet Union as a response to the poor performance of the earlier 9K32 Strela-2 (SA-7 Grail) system. The missile was largely based on the earlier Strela 2, and thus development proceeded rapidly. The new weapon was accepted into service in the Soviet Army in January 1974.

==Description==

The most significant change over the Strela 2 was the introduction of an all-new infra-red homing seeker head. The new seeker worked on FM modulation (con-scan) principle, which is less vulnerable to jamming and decoy flares than the earlier AM (spin-scan) seekers, which were easily fooled by flares and even the most primitive infrared jammers. The new seeker also introduced detector element cooling in the form of a pressurized nitrogen bottle attached to the launcher.
The effect of cooling was to expand the seeker&#x27;s lead sulfide detector element&#x27;s sensitivity range to longer wavelengths (slightly over 4 μm as opposed to 2.8 μm of uncooled PbS elements). In practice this made possible the tracking of cooler targets over longer ranges, and enabled forward-hemisphere engagement of jets under favourable circumstances. The seeker also had better tracking rate, enabling the missile to track maneuvering of fast and approaching targets.

A negative side effect from the aforementioned improvements was increased missile weight, which caused a slight decrease in the kinematic performance of the original Strela-2 (SA-7). Against relatively slow, low-altitude battlefield air threats the overall effectiveness was much improved.

Strela-3 missiles have been exported to over 30 countries.

The original Strela-3 missile was the 9M36. The follow-on to the Strela-3 was Igla.

The naval version of this missile has the NATO reporting name of SA-N-8.

==Operational history==
===Iraq===
On 22 November 2003 an Airbus A300 cargo plane was hit by a Strela-3 missile after takeoff from Baghdad International Airport, but managed to land safely despite losing hydraulic power.

On 6 May 2006, a British Westland Lynx AH.7 of the Royal Navy from 847 Squadron was shot down with a Strela-3 over Basra, killing five crewmen and crashing into a house.

===Georgia===
During the War in Abkhazia (1992–1993), a Russian Mi-8 helicopter was shot down by a Georgian Army SA-14 on December 14, 1992, resulting in the death of 3 crew and 58 passengers, most of them Russian refugees. A Georgian Air Force Su-25 was shot down over Nizhnaya Eshera on 4 July 1993 by SA-14, and several other aircraft on both sides may have been shot down by SA-14s.

===Former Yugoslavia===
A British Sea Harrier FRS1 of 801 Naval Air Squadron, operating from aircraft carrier on 16 April 1994, was shot down during its attack on two Republika Srpska T-55 tanks in Bosnia. The pilot, Lieutenant Nick Richardson, ejected and landed in territory controlled by friendly Bosnian Muslims.

===DRC Congo===
A Zimbabwe Air Force Il-76 was shot down by Congolese rebels using an SA-14 on 11 October 1998 during the Second Congo War, resulting in the death of 40 troops and crew.

===Afghanistan===
SA-14s used by the Northern Alliance are credited with having shot down 8 Taliban MiG-21 and Su-22 fighters during the Taliban&#x27;s 2000 offensive against Taloqan.

<text>Gordon Weaver Browning (November 22, 1889May 23, 1976) was an American politician who served as the 38th governor of Tennessee from 1937 to 1939, and again from 1949 to 1953. He also served six terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, from 1923 to 1935, and was Chancellor of Tennessee&#x27;s Eighth Chancery District in the 1940s. As governor, he stabilized state finances, doubled the state&#x27;s mileage of paved roads, and enacted legislation to curb voter fraud. His victory in the hard-fought 1948 gubernatorial campaign helped break the power of Memphis political boss E. H. Crump.

In the years following World War II, Browning served in the Allied occupational government in Germany, and was a civil affairs advisor on the staff of General Dwight D. Eisenhower.

==Early life==
Browning was born near Atwood in Carroll County, Tennessee, the son of James and Melissa (Brooks) Browning. When he was still young, his parents moved to Milan, Tennessee, where his father served as a justice of the peace. He grew up in the historic Browning House. After graduating from Milan High School in 1908, Browning enrolled in Valparaiso University in Indiana, where he earned tuition money waiting tables. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science and a Bachelor of Pedagogy in 1913.

Browning taught school briefly before enrolling in the Cumberland School of Law in Lebanon, Tennessee. He graduated in 1915, and was admitted to the bar shortly afterward. In March 1915, he began practicing in the law office of George McCall in Huntingdon, Tennessee, in his native Carroll County.

In June 1917, after the U.S. entry into World War I, Browning enlisted in the Tennessee National Guard as a 2nd lieutenant in Company D of the First Tennessee Field Artillery. This unit was activated as the 114th Field Artillery of the 30th Infantry Division, under the command of General Lawrence Tyson. Browning was promoted to captain, and transferred to Company A. He fought with the unit in northern France, and was cited for gallantry.

After being discharged in 1919, Browning resumed practice of law in Huntingdon. In 1920, he ran for the 8th district seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, but lost to his former law school classmate, Lon Scott, by a 50% to 49% margin. He ran again in 1922, and was victorious. He represented this district for five consecutive terms (frequently running unopposed), and represented the 7th district for one term (1933–1935) following redistricting. During his final term in the House, Browning was one of the &quot;managers&quot; (prosecutors) in the impeachment hearings of California judge Harold Louderback.

In 1934, Browning sought the Democratic Party nomination for the U.S. Senate seat that had been vacated when Cordell Hull resigned to become Secretary of State. His chief opponent was Nathan L. Bachman, who had been temporarily appointed to the seat. Bachman had the support of Memphis political boss E. H. Crump, who was at the height of his power after the downfall of his rival, Luke Lea, and Browning struggled with voters in East Tennessee. He was defeated by Bachman, 166,293 votes to 121,169.

==First gubernatorial term and World War II==

In 1936, incumbent Governor Hill McAlister angered Crump by proposing a state sales tax, and did not seek reelection. Browning sought the party&#x27;s nomination, his chief opponent being Campbell County school superintendent Burgin Dossett. Crump initially proclaimed neutrality, but when it became clear Browning could win with or without the Shelby County vote, he endorsed Browning. Browning coasted to victory in the primary, and defeated the Republican candidate, Pat Thach, 332,523 votes to 77,392 in the general election.

Browning had campaigned on cleaning up state government, getting the debt (which had skyrocketed to over $100 million by the time he took office) under control, and maintaining statewide prohibition (national prohibition had ended with the repeal of the 18th Amendment). In 1937, he signed the Debt Reorganization Act, which consolidated the state&#x27;s debt, and enacted several taxes. Over the next 10 years, these efforts reduced the state&#x27;s debt by 40%. He also created the Department of Conservation (now the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation), implemented the state portions of several federal programs aimed at providing Depression-era relief, and created a civil service merit system.

In April 1937, Senator Bachman (who had defeated Browning for the Senate seat in 1934) died in office. Browning engineered a plan that would have allowed him to take Bachman&#x27;s seat, while helping Crump to defeat Kenneth McKellar for the other seat, and allowing Lewis S. Pope to become governor. The plan never materialized, however, as Crump refused to run against his longtime friend, McKellar. Furthermore, Browning had angered Crump by appointing several of Luke Lea&#x27;s former associates to government positions, while ignoring Crump&#x27;s requests for appointments. Browning appointed George L. Berry to finish Bachman&#x27;s term.

In 1938, Prentice Cooper, with Crump&#x27;s endorsement, challenged Browning for the party&#x27;s nomination for governor. After learning that Crump had registered over 100,000 voters in Shelby County, Browning sought to replace the primary system with a &quot;county unit&quot; system, which would equalize votes by county, thereby reducing the influence of Shelby. The bill passed, but was declared unconstitutional by the Tennessee Supreme Court prior to the election. Browning also formed a commission to investigate voter fraud in Shelby County, and managed to have over 13,000 voters purged. His efforts fell short, however, and he was defeated by Cooper, 231,852 votes to 158,854.

Following his defeat in the primary, Browning returned to Huntingdon to practice law. In 1942, he was elected Chancellor of the Eighth Chancery District without opposition.

In the months following the U.S. entry into World War II, Browning consistently sought a commission in the U.S. Army, but was thwarted by political foes. He finally appealed directly to the Army&#x27;s adjutant general in Washington, and was commissioned in 1943 with the rank of captain. He attended the School of Military Government in Charlottesville, Virginia, which trained military officers in matters related to governing occupied territories, and was eventually promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He initially served as deputy head of the Belgium-Luxembourg mission, which aimed to restore civilian government to these areas, and aided in the Allied victory at the Battle of the Bulge in early 1945. In September 1946, Browning was appointed commander of the military government in the Bremen enclave as part of the Allied Occupation of Germany.

==Second gubernatorial term==

Browning challenged incumbent Governor Jim Nance McCord for the nomination in 1946, though he was still in Europe and did not actively campaign. Though he lost, his 120,535 votes (to McCord&#x27;s 187,119) showed he still had substantial support in Tennessee.

In 1948, Browning again sought the nomination against McCord. Realizing it would take a considerable effort to defeat the Crump machine, he teamed up with Congressman Estes Kefauver, who was challenging Crump&#x27;s candidate, Tom Stewart, for one of the state&#x27;s U.S. Senate seats. Crump ran attack ads against Browning and Kefauver, criticizing the former for issuing too many pardons as governor, and accusing the latter of being a communist sympathizer. Browning compared Crump to Adolf Hitler, and told stories about Crump sneaking through Memphis cemeteries at night to find names of dead people to add to voter lists. He also attacked McCord for implementing a 2% state sales tax (which Crump had reluctantly supported).

As the campaign heated up, Crump&#x27;s hold on state politics appeared to be weakening. Congressman Al Gore, Sr., returned from Washington to canvass for Browning. Various voting blocks began turning against Crump, among them black voters in Memphis, who had grown tired of his control of the city. Returning veterans sympathized with Browning&#x27;s military experience, while labor groups were angry with McCord for enacting a right-to-work law. On election day, Browning defeated McCord for the nomination, 231,852 votes to 158,854, and Kefauver defeated Stewart. It was the first defeat for a Crump-backed candidate in a major election in over two decades.

In the general election, Browning faced country music singer Roy Acuff. Republicans had added Acuff&#x27;s name to their primary ballot as a publicity stunt to draw attention to the party, and he unexpectedly won the nomination. Though Acuff ran a serious campaign, Browning nevertheless won easily, 363,903 votes to 179,957.

During his second tenure as governor, Browning enacted several measures aimed at further weakening Crump and other political bosses, including laws requiring permanent voter registration, open election commission meetings, and metal ballot boxes in places where voting machines were not used. Browning signed legislation that partially eliminated the state&#x27;s poll tax, which political bosses had used for decades to control votes. Along with election reforms, Browning also increased funding for rural schools and higher education, established a retirement system and minimum salaries for teachers, and expanded the state&#x27;s system of paved roads from roughly to over .

In the 1950 governor&#x27;s race, Browning beat back a primary challenge by Nashville attorney and state senator Clifford Allen, winning the nomination 267,855 votes to 208,634. For the first time since the Civil War, no Republican ran in the general election. Browning&#x27;s only opponent was eccentric attorney John R. Neal, who was running as a third-party candidate. Browning defeated Neal, 184,437 votes to 51,757.

In 1952, rising politician Frank G. Clement challenged Browning for the party&#x27;s nomination for governor. Clement derided Browning as &quot;dishonest, indecent, and immoral,&quot; and criticized the state&#x27;s purchase of an expensive office building in Nashville. Browning, nearly twice Clement&#x27;s age, struggled to adapt to the new medium of television. He lost to Clement in the primary, 302,487 votes to 245,156.

==Later life==

Following his defeat in 1952, Browning returned to Huntingdon to practice law. He again challenged Clement for the party&#x27;s nomination for governor in 1954, but was defeated by a large margin. He remained active in the Democratic Party, however, travelling frequently to attend party functions. He also operated a dairy farm and an insurance firm. He died on May 23, 1976, and was buried in Huntingdon&#x27;s Oak Hill Cemetery.

==Family and legacy==

Browning married Ida Leach in 1920. They had no children.

The Gordon Browning Museum in McKenzie, Tennessee (in Carroll County) preserves documents and artifacts related Browning&#x27;s life and career. The museum is located in the old McKenzie post office building. Dormitories on the campuses of Tennessee Tech and the University of Tennessee at Martin have been named in honor of Browning. The administration building on the campus of Austin Peay State University is named in Browning&#x27;s honor.

<text>The Doctor of Technology (abbreviated variously in different countries) is a degree normally conferred upon candidates after having completed a course of study in technology and a dissertation or a project of lengthy duration in a technologically related field. Like other doctorates, it is usually an academic degree at the highest level equivalent to a PhD.

While the details of the degree vary, a doctor of technology program usually enables graduates to obtain an advanced level of knowledge in specialist fields and aims to produce graduates capable of advancing knowledge within their industry. The degree focuses on developing practical solutions in the workplace, critical analysis, synthesis, and innovation.

==As a substantive degree==
In Austria, universities of technology, such as TU Wien, grant the title of &quot;Dr.techn.&quot; (in German: &quot;Doktor der technischen Wissenschaften&quot; which means doctor of technical sciences), also rendered as &quot;Doctor technicae&quot; (Dr.techn.), as equivalent to the PhD. A similar title, also designated &quot;Dr.techn.&quot; (Doctor technicae), is awarded in Denmark (e.g., DTU). 

In Sweden the situation is the same and the degrees are called &quot;teknologie doktor&quot; or &quot;teknisk doktor&quot; (&quot;Tekn. Dr.&quot; or &quot;Tek. Dr.&quot;) and are translated to PhD in English. In Finland, the degree &quot;tekniikan tohtori&quot; (&quot;TkT&quot;) or &quot;teknologie doktor&quot; (Doctor of Science (Technology), D.Sc. (Tech.)) is comparable to a Finnish &quot;filosofian tohtori&quot; (Doctor of Philosophy).

In South Africa, the Doctor of Technology or &quot;Doctor Technologiae&quot; (DTech) is equivalent to other research doctorates at level 10 of the South African National Qualifications Framework. It is normally awarded by universities of technology and can be awarded in a wide variety of fields, not just technology.

In the United States, Purdue University offers the Doctor of Technology (DTech) as an equivalent to the Ph.D. through the Purdue Polytechnic Institute with the key differentiator being the DTech requires a dissertation focusing on applied/use-inspired research of direct relevance to professional practice. Additionally, the Doctor of Industrial Technology (D.I.T.) degree was recognized by the National Science Foundation (NSF) as equivalent to the PhD degree until 2008, when it was determined that it had moved to a more professional orientation and no longer met the NSF criteria for a research doctorate.

==Higher doctorates==
In the United Kingdom the degree of Doctor of Technology (DTech) is offered as a higher doctorate by a number of universities.

<doc id="864118" wikidata="Q10759605" url="?curid=864118" title="Eupetaurus">
<text>Eupetaurus is a genus of rodent in the family Sciuridae. Members of this genus are known as woolly flying squirrels. They are large to very large flying squirrels found in the highest rocky cliffs near the treeline of the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau. Due to the inaccessibility of their montane habitat, they are difficult to study.

==Taxonomy==
Flying squirrels in the central and eastern Himalayas have been separated from those in the western Himalayas by the Ganges and Yarlung Tsangpo rivers, and are thought to have diverged in the Neogene, between 4.5 and 10.2 million years ago.

==Species==
For more than a century since its description by Oldfield Thomas, the only species in the genus was thought to be the western woolly flying squirrel (&quot;E. cinereus&quot;), which is found in northern Pakistan and northwestern India. However, an analysis of museum specimens found evidence of two more species in the eastern Himalayas, the Tibetan woolly flying squirrel (&quot;E. tibetensis&quot;) and the Yunnan woolly flying squirrel (&quot;E. nivamons&quot;).

There are currently three known species in the genus:
* Western woolly flying squirrel (&quot;Eupetaurus cinereus&quot;)
* Yunnan woolly flying squirrel (&quot;Eupetaurus nivamons&quot;)
* Tibetan woolly flying squirrel (&quot;Eupetaurus tibetensis&quot;)

==Description==
The cheek teeth are unique as they are both flat-crowned and high crowned (hypsodont), setting &quot;Eupetaurus&quot; apart from other squirrels and suggesting that they feed on very abrasive plant material, including pine needles. The western woolly flying squirrel has a grizzled-grey pelage with pronounced frosting, in contrast to the more saturated brown coloration of the two other species, and has more robust cusps and cheek teeth.

==Relationships==
The woolly flying squirrels are unique among the flying squirrels because of their large size and unique dentition. This led a few early researchers to go so far as to create a distinct family. Some of their arguments were based on poorly drawn and labeled diagrams of the cranium and lower jaw of &quot;E. cinereus&quot;. Zahler and Woods (1997) suggest instead that &quot;Eupetaurus&quot; is closely related to another genus of large flying squirrels, &quot;Petaurista&quot;. A 2021 study suggested that &quot;Eupetaurus&quot; is the sister genus to a clade consisting of &quot;Aeromys&quot; and &quot;Biswamayopterus&quot;.

Pools and fountains had been a feature from Roman times, but hydraulic engineers first took full advantage of characteristic sloping sites of villas in the hills surrounding Lazio, where there was copious available water. Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola&#x27;s &quot;catene d&#x27;aqua&quot; (water chains) and water stairs, fountains, cascades, jets, pools and canals at Villa Farnese at Caprarola and Villa Lante at Bagnaia led the way. At Villa Lante a rill of water flows down the center of a stone picnic table.
French 16th-century gardens in the Ile-de-France were generally in flat terrain that did not lend itself to elaborate &quot;jeux d&#x27;eau.&quot; Fountains, &quot;bassins&quot; (pools in raised basins) and canals were more typical of French water features. For the &quot;jeux d&#x27;eau&quot; at Versailles, a watermill-driven pumping station (the &quot;machine de Marly&quot;, at the time being the most powerful machine in Europe) and elaborate aqueducts had to be constructed to bring water from many kilometers away.

Sloping sites at the palaces of Caserta and Peterhof permitted grand cascades. At Caserta, a rill of water even flows down the handrail of a staircase balustrade.

A favorite &quot;jeu d&#x27;eau&quot; was the practical joke of surprise water jets that could be turned on suddenly by a gardener accomplice turning a hidden wheel, trapping guests or soaking their finery. Joking water jets remained a feature in German gardens well into the 19th century.

In the 1930s, Otto Przystawik invented the novelty musical fountain feature that came to be called &quot;dancing waters&quot;. Early systems in displays and nightclubs were manually operated by hand pumps and levers. Harold Steinman, the New York-based promoter of &quot;Holiday on Ice&quot;, spotted the Przystawik display in a Berlin nightclub. He took the machine on tour with his roller-skating review, where its success inspired him to send out duplicates on tours during the 1950s and 60s. In the later 20th century, programmable &quot;dancing waters&quot; became a feature of novelty fountains associated with resort hotels, where they were combined with laser light shows. Elaborate moving water effects and shifting colored lighting were coordinated with recorded music. Such features draw crowds in Las Vegas, where they were initiated as part of Liberace&#x27;s stage show and have been satirized in a &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode.

<doc id="864130" wikidata="Q4889340" url="?curid=864130" title="Benjamin W. Crowninshield">
<text>Benjamin Williams Crowninshield (March 12, 1837–January 16, 1892) was an American historian, businessman, and Union Army officer during the American Civil War.

==Life==
A member of the Boston Brahmin Crowninshield family, Benjamin Williams Crowninshield was born in Boston, the son of Francis Boardman Crowninshield (1809–1877) and Sarah Putnam (1810–1880).
He attended Harvard College, graduating in 1858, along with classmates Henry Hobson Richardson and Henry Adams. Adams&#x27; &quot;Education of Henry Adams&quot; (1918) includes descriptions of his friendship with Crowninshield.

At Harvard, Crowninshield kept a daily diary through his junior and senior years, which was published in 1941 by his son Francis, under the title &quot;A Private Journal, 1856–1858&quot;. It records that he was captain of the rowing team; handled most of his classes with ease, with the exception of Logic which he called &quot;that cursed nonsense&quot;; was president, Learoyd Director, and Abercrombie Treasurer of the Glee Club; was a member of the Porcellian Club and Pierian Sodality; was treasurer of the Hasty Pudding; sang in the choir; and played the &#x27;cello. He resided, in 1856, at Number 9 Hollis Hall. His diary records many activities, from visiting old friends through attending drawing courses and music lessons; going to dances, theatres, and concerts; playing billiards at Ripley&#x27;s; and spending the evening in Parker&#x27;s Restaurant; to spending a whole day making a model boat.

Other people that he befriended at Harvard, according to his diary, include Robert Gould Shaw, whom Crowninshield first met when Shaw was a freshman who was hoping to become a member of the Pierian Sodality, and William Henry Fitzhugh Lee, son of Robert E. Lee. His diary entry for November 19, 1856, for example, records him playing whist &quot;till the sociable (Lee&#x27;s) was ready at L. Erving&#x27;s room&quot;. (The &quot;sociable&quot; was a party.) Its entry for June 24, 1857 records him going &quot;into town to a supper at Parker&#x27;s given in honor of Lee, Jones, Lowndes all of whom are going to leave the class&quot;.

===Civil War service===
With the onset of the Civil War, Crowninshield enlisted as a lieutenant with the First Massachusetts Cavalry on November 11, 1861. He rose through the ranks, being promoted to first lieutenant on December 19, 1861, captain on March 26, 1862, and major on August 10, 1864. He was aide de camp to General Philip Sheridan, remaining with the General until mustered out on November 6, 1864. On June 17, 1865, he reached the highest rank that he was to attain, brevet colonel of the U.S. Volunteers.

Crowninshield was the provost marshal on duty at the time W.H.F. Lee, by then a cavalry general in the Confederate States Army, was captured after the Battle of Brandy Station in June 1863. Crowninshield&#x27;s son Francis was later to record that it was &quot;a truly embarrassing position for both of them&quot;, with Lee rejecting &quot;any of the privileges [that] Crowninshield tried to bestow upon him&quot;.

After the war he became a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States - a military society of officers who had served in the Union armed forces.

===Post war===

Crowninshield pursued the study of history, publishing and speaking on various topics, such as yachting and military history. He wrote his &quot;History of the First Massachusetts Cavalry&quot; (see further reading) in 1891. His personal account of Sheridan at Winchester (also listed in further reading) was published in &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;.

In 1868, Crowninshield commissioned his friend H.H. Richardson to design and build a house on Marlborough Street in the newly land-filled Back Bay area of Boston. The Crowninshield House, completed in 1870, still exists.

After the War, Crowninshield married and moved to New York, where he was a member of New York drygoods merchants Sprague, Colburn, and Company. In 1868 he moved to Boston to join a different drygood merchants, Wheelwright, Anderson, and Company. He was later president of the Realty Company.

His health began to fail in 1891, and he died January 16, 1892, at age 54, in Rome, having travelled to Europe for a rest.
His oldest son was boat designer Bowdoin B. Crowninshield (1867–1948).

<doc id="864134" wikidata="Q1174756" url="?curid=864134" title="David Holmes (musician)">
<text>David Holmes (born 25 February 1969) is a Northern-Irish musician and composer from Northern Ireland. He worked as a DJ before releasing several solo albums that incorporated elements of trip hop, big beat, rock and electronic music. In the late 1990s, he also began composing film scores, establishing a long-standing collaboration with director Steven Soderbergh that includes &quot;Out of Sight&quot; (1998) and the &quot;Ocean&#x27;s&quot; trilogy.

Holmes is currently a member of the band Unloved, whose music has been used extensively in the television series &quot;Killing Eve&quot;, for which Holmes is also a composer. He has remixed songs for numerous artists and produced albums for Primal Scream and Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds.

==Career==
===DJ===
Holmes began DJing in Belfast from the age of 15. His first hit was the 1992 track &quot;De Niro&quot; as the Disco Evangelists, with Ashley Beedle and Lindsay Edwards (who later joined Tin Tin Out). In the early to mid-1990s, he ran two club nights in the Belfast Art College known as Sugar Sweet and Shake Yer Brain. Orbital wrote the track &quot;Belfast&quot;, released on their debut album &quot;Orbital&quot;, after playing at Sugar Sweet.

Holmes released &quot;This Film&#x27;s Crap Let&#x27;s Slash the Seats&quot;, in July 1995. At the time he described the album as being inspired by movies and movie soundtracks, a recurring theme throughout Holmes&#x27; work (see Discography). The opening track, &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, featured on the soundtrack to the film, &quot;Pi&quot;. In the same year, he also provided the ambient links between the songs on the album &quot;Infernal Love&quot; by Therapy?. In 1997, Holmes released &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Killed&quot;. Many of the tracks featured Brazilians dancing in the streets of New York City, recorded by Holmes using a minidisc recorder. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;My Mate Paul,&quot; was Holmes&#x27; first commercial success.

His 1997 Essential Mix, a mixture of northern soul, psychedelic funk and hip hop was voted mix of the year by &quot;Muzik&quot; magazine. In 1998, Danny DeVito commissioned him to do the score for Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s film &quot;Out of Sight&quot;. He scored a second film for Soderbergh in 2001, including some songs from &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Killed&quot; and &quot;Bow Down to the Exit Sign&quot; on the &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; remake.

After releasing a remix album, &quot;Come Get It I Got It&quot;, in 2002, Holmes released &quot;David Holmes Presents The Free Association&quot;. This was a departure for the artist as all his previous work had been solo. The Free Association featured four other bandmates who toured with Holmes after the album was launched. As a remixer he has reworked tracks by artists such as U2, Doves, Manic Street Preachers, Primal Scream, Page and Plant, Saint Etienne and Ice Cube. In 2008, Holmes composed the music for the &quot;New iPhone&quot; ad campaign. An album, &quot;The Holy Pictures&quot;, was released on 8 September 2008, from which the track &quot;Holy Pictures&quot; was selected for the soundtrack of &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer 2010&quot;. The first track from this album, &quot;I Heard Wonders&quot;, also featured in the movie &quot;Cherrybomb&quot; and the Opening Ceremony of the 2012 Olympics to accompany the footage of David Beckham and Jade Bailey bringing the olympic flame up the River Thames by speedboat. He worked with Leo Abrahams to create the score for the award-winning film &quot;Hunger&quot;, directed by Steve McQueen, about the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike. The score won an IFTA at the Irish Film Awards.

In April 2009, he topped &quot;The Irish Times&quot;″ &quot;50 Best Irish Acts Right Now&quot;. His film project &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, was the first feature film from David&#x27;s film company Canderblicks Film. Set in the heart of the punk rock scene of 1970s Belfast, it tells the story of Terri Hooley. Directed by Glenn Leyburn and Lisa Barros D&#x27;Sa, written by Glen Patterson and Colin Carbury and co-produced by Andrew Eaton (Revolution Films) &amp; BBC Films, it was nominated for a BAFTA and the soundtrack was Rough Trade&#x27;s Compilation of the year 2013.

===Soundtracks===
Holmes scored all three series of &quot;The Fall&quot; starring Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan. His score for the first series was nominated for an RTS Craft and Design Award in 2013 and winner of the best score at the Irish Film and TV Awards in 2014. He scored the film &quot;&#x27;71&quot;, for which he won an Ivor Novello Award. Directed by Yann Demange, the film tells the story of a British Soldier who became separated from his unit during a riot in Belfast at the height of The Troubles in 1971. In May 2015, Holmes&#x27; first film which he directed and wrote &quot;I Am Here&quot; was shown on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Shooting Gallery&quot;.

Holmes produced the third album by Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds. Recorded and mixed in Belfast, the album &quot;Who Built the Moon?&quot; was released on 24 November 2017. In 2019, he and American musician, composer and music producer Keith Ciancia won the Original Music category at the BAFTA TV Craft Awards for their work on the &quot;Killing Eve&quot; soundtrack.

<text>Jussi Pekka Pohjola (13 January 1952 – 27 November 2008) was a Finnish multi-instrumentalist, composer and producer. Best known as a bass player, Pohjola was also a classically trained pianist and violinist.

Pohjola rose to fame as the bass player of the Finnish progressive rock band Wigwam, but he soon departed on a solo career, initially releasing Frank Zappa–influenced progressive rock albums. As his career progressed Pohjola developed a more novel musical style that could best be described as fusion jazz. In addition to Wigwam and his solo albums, Pohjola played with the band Made in Sweden, and the bands of Jukka Tolonen and Mike Oldfield.

Pohjola belonged to one of the most prominent musical families in Finland. Conductor Sakari Oramo is Pohjola&#x27;s cousin, and Verneri Pohjola is his son.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Pohjola was born in Helsinki, Finland and studied classical piano and violin at the Sibelius Academy in the city. After a stint with The Boys (the seminal Finnish band led by brothers Eero and Jussi Raittinen), he joined Wigwam in 1970, contributing on two of their albums before leaving the group in 1972 to pursue a solo career (although he contributed again on Wigwam&#x27;s &quot;Being&quot; in 1974). Pohjola&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Pihkasilmä Kaarnakorva&quot; (&quot;Resin Eye Bark Ear&quot;), released in 1972, bears a notable resemblance to the work of Frank Zappa.

After leaving Wigwam, Pohjola played with the Jukka Tolonen Band for a short time. In 1974 his second solo album, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Bialoipokku the Magpie&quot;), was released in Finland. The album saw Pohjola&#x27;s sound developing in a more distinctive direction, with heavy use of trumpets, saxophones and piano. The somewhat jazz-influenced album sufficiently piqued the interest of Virgin Records executive Richard Branson for him to release it in the United Kingdom the following year under the name &quot;B the Magpie&quot;. The album was re-released, in October 2010, by Cherry Red Records.

At the request of Virgin, Pohjola teamed up with Mike Oldfield to record and produce his third solo album, released in 1977 in Finland as &quot;Keesojen Lehto&quot; (&quot;Grove of the Keeso&quot;) and in the UK as &quot;The Mathematician&#x27;s Air Display&quot;. The album was released, in Germany (1981, album and cassette) and Italy (1987) as simply &quot;Mike &amp; Sally Oldfield / Pekka Pohjola&quot;. The album was also released in 1981 on the Happy Bird label, in the Netherlands, under the name &quot;The Consequences of Indecisions&quot; and credited to Oldfield instead of Pohjola. Oldfield asked Pohjola to join him on his 1978 tour and Pohjola can be heard on Oldfield&#x27;s live album &quot;Exposed&quot;, released in 1979.

In 1978 Pohjola formed , which released a self-titled album that same year. In 1979 Pohjola released &quot;Visitation&quot;, his fourth solo album. All of Pohjola&#x27;s 1970s solo albums exhibited fantasy influences, but these were undoubtedly strongest on his 1979 &quot;Visitation&quot;.

===1980s===
In 1980 The Group changed its name to Pekka Pohjola Group and released the album &quot;Kätkävaaran Lohikäärme&quot; (&quot;The Dragon of Kätkävaara&quot;), with musicians Pohjola on bass and with Ippe Kätkä (drums), Pekka Tyni (keyboards) and Seppo Tyni (guitars). The group disbanded soon after the release of their second album.

Pohjola&#x27;s next solo album, &quot;Urban Tango&quot;, was released in 1982. It was a radical departure from fantasy- and nature-inspired works of the &#x27;70s. It was also the first Pekka Pohjola album to feature comprehensible singing, the vocals provided by Kassu Halonen. &quot;Urban Tango&quot; was also the first of Pohjola&#x27;s albums to be released on his own Pohjola Records label. His next album was the soundtrack to Hannu Heikinheimo&#x27;s 1983 movie &quot;Jokamies&quot; (released in 1984 under the title &quot;Everyman&quot; in the United States and Germany). The album was notable for an abundant use of synthesizers. &quot;Space Waltz&quot;, released in 1985, further explored the themes first heard on &quot;Urban Tango&quot; (1982). 1986&#x27;s &quot;Flight of the Angel&quot; was to be Pohjola&#x27;s last album of the &#x27;80s. The following year a compilation of his material was released under the name &quot;New Impressionist&quot;.

Pohjola&#x27;s record label in the United States during the 1980s was Breakthru&#x27; Records, a pioneering audiophile record company started by Robert Silverstein in 1983. The advent of the compact disc in 1984 made it very difficult for independent American record labels to make CD pressings in the U.S. as the first plants, aside from the Sony plant in Indiana, were in Germany and Japan. As a result, Breakthru&#x27; scrambled and forfeited away its rights to unscrupulous distributors in an effort to adapt to the fast changing audio landscape of the music business during 1984 and 1986. With the 1985 release of &quot;Space Waltz&quot;, Breakthru&#x27; Records became the first label ever to release a compact disc by Pohjola. The first Pohjola album to be released on CD, &quot;Space Waltz&quot; was mastered in New York City by mastering engineer legend Greg Calbi. Pressed on CD in Switzerland, &quot;Space Waltz&quot; was also released by Breakthru&#x27; Records on audiophile vinyl and cassette. Robert Silverstein&#x27;s 1980 interview with Pohjola can be found on the Music Web Express 3000 (www.mwe3.com) web site.

===Later life and death===
During the late &#x27;80s Pohjola composed &quot;Sinfonia No 1&quot; (&quot;Symphony No. 1&quot;), which premiered live in 1989 and was released on CD in 1990, performed by the AVANTI! music group. Returning to the music scene in 1992, Pohjola released his ninth solo album, &quot;Changing Waters&quot;. The album&#x27;s sound differed greatly from Pohjola&#x27;s guitar-driven works of the &#x27;80s, offering a softer, more piano-based soundscape. &quot;Changing Waters&quot; was given in an international release in spring 1993. The album featured Finnish top musicians Seppo Kantonen (keyboards), Markku Kanerva (guitar) and Anssi Nykänen (drums), who became Pohjola&#x27;s regular band. In May 1995, Pohjola released &quot;Live in Japan&quot;, a recording from three shows in Tokyo in November 1994. Later that year, Pohjola released a double CD, &quot;Heavy Jazz - Live in Helsinki and Tokyo&quot;. His next studio album, &quot;Pewit&quot;, followed in September 1997. In May 2001 Pekka Pohjola released &quot;Views&quot;, on which he toned down the rock-solid guitar-based sound of &quot;Urban Tango&quot; (1982) and &quot;Space Waltz&quot; (1985), instead focusing more on jazz and pop-classical arrangements, leaning heavily on strings and brass arrangements. The only song on &quot;Views&quot; to feature a guitar is &quot;The Red Porsche&quot;, after a poem written by Charles Bukowski.

Pohjola&#x27;s piece &quot;The Madness Subsides&quot; from &quot;B the Magpie&quot; (1974) was sampled by DJ Shadow as the main bass line in his song &quot;Midnight in a Perfect World&quot;, from the wildly successful debut album &quot;Endtroducing...&quot; (1996).

On 27 November 2008 Pohjola, who had alcoholism, died of an epileptic seizure at the age of 56.

She also played Amy on &quot;First Love&quot; (1954–1955), Amy Tyler on &quot;All My Children&quot; (1970), and Dr. Julie Franklin on &quot;How to Survive a Marriage&quot; (1974–1975) . She has performed in many theatrical productions. She appeared on Broadway in &quot;The Grey-Eyed People&quot; (1952), &quot;Tonight in Samarkand&quot; (1955), &quot;Three Men on a Horse&quot; (1969), &quot;The Prisoner of Second Avenue&quot; (1971), and &quot;Tribute&quot; (1978). Prinz originated the role of M&#x27;Lynn Eatenton in &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; during its first production Off-Broadway in 1987.

== Early life ==
Prinz was born in The Bronx, New York. Her father was cellist Milton Prinz, who performed with the NBC Symphony Orchestra and was the founder of the New York String Quartet. Prinz later taped &quot;How to Survive a Marriage&quot; in the same studio where her father had performed with Arturo Toscanini.

==Career==

=== 1947-1955: Early work ===
In 1947, at age sixteen, Prinz made her professional acting debut in &quot;Dream Girl&quot; at the Craigsmoor Summer Theatre. Her father gave her permission to finish high school early. She was cast in a touring production of &quot;Joan of Lorraine&quot;, co-starring with Diana Barrymore. She later joined touring productions of &quot;Kiss and Tell&quot;, &quot;Glad Tidings&quot;, and &quot;The Second Man&quot;. In 1948, she starred in &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; at the Flat Rock Playhouse in North Carolina.

She made her Broadway debut as First Girl Scout in the original production of &quot;The Grey-Eyed People&quot;, opening on December 17, 1952 at the Martin Beck Theatre. Prinz played Amy on the NBC soap opera &quot;First Love&quot; from 1954 to 1955. She guest starred on &quot;The Mickey Rooney Show&quot;. She appeared as Pandore in the original Broadway production of &quot;Tonight in Samarkand&quot;. The play opened at the Morosco Theatre on February 16, 1955.

=== 1956-1968: &quot;As the World Turns&quot; ===
She was cast in the contract role of Penny Hughes on the CBS soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, appearing in the show&#x27;s first episode on April 2, 1956. In the beginning, the show taped a half-hour episode live every day. The character of Penny was paired romantically with Jeff Baker (Mark Rydell). They were daytime&#x27;s first teen romance, breaking up and reuniting many times. The couple finally married and planned to adopt a child. Their storyline ended when Jeff was killed in a car crash and Penny suffered from amnesia.Prinz sparred with Irna Phillips, the creator and writer of &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. She has said that Phillips would become angry when she took roles in theatrical productions. She also didn&#x27;t want her to smoke or drink, because it was something that Penny wouldn&#x27;t do. Prinz has said, &quot;I was supposed to be Penny all the time.&quot;

After the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, &quot;ATWT&quot; was preempted by news coverage for four days. When the show began airing again, Prinz asked if she could make a reference to it on the air. She was told not to, but she improvised a line anyway, saying &quot;Grandpa, here we are talking about Tommy, and after all the country&#x27;s been through for the last four days.&quot;

From December 1967 to January 1968, Prinz starred in &quot;A Girl Could Get Lucky&quot; at The Little Theatre on the Square. The stress of working on &quot;ATWT&quot; and the conflicts with Irna Phillips caused her to have a nervous breakdown. She sought help from a psychoanalyst and decided to leave the show when her contract ended in 1968. Phillips&#x27; last revenge on her was to have the character of Penny steal her brother&#x27;s child and go to England. The role was briefly recast with actress Phoebe Dorin.

=== 1968-1982: &quot;All My Children&quot; ===
From 1968 to 1969, Prinz played Ella in a touring production of &quot;The Apple Tree&quot;, co-starring with Tom Ewell.

<text>William Prentice Cooper Jr. (September 28, 1895May 18, 1969) was an American politician and diplomat who served as the 39th governor of Tennessee from 1939 to 1945. He led the state&#x27;s mobilization efforts for World War II, when over 300,000 Tennesseans joined the armed forces, and numerous defense-related facilities were established across the state. He later served as United States Ambassador to Peru (1946–1948) and chaired Tennessee&#x27;s 1953 constitutional convention.

==Early life==
Cooper was born at the home of his maternal grandparents, River Side Farmhouse, along the Duck River in Bedford County, Tennessee. He was the son of William Prentice Cooper, an attorney and businessman, and Argentine (Shofner) Cooper. He attended private schools in nearby Shelbyville and graduated in 1913 from the Webb School in Bell Buckle, where he was president of the debate team.

In 1914, Cooper enrolled in Vanderbilt University, where he was a member of Phi Delta Theta and vice president of the freshman class. After two years, he transferred to Princeton University, from which he graduated in 1917 with a Bachelor of Arts. Following the U.S. entry into World War I, he enlisted in the Army, initially serving with the 307th Field Artillery before being transferred to Fort Monroe in Virginia. He was discharged in January 1919 with the rank of second lieutenant.

Cooper enrolled in Harvard Law School in February 1919 and graduated with an LL.B in 1921. He was admitted to the bar in 1922 and began practice in Shelbyville. That same year he was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives, where he secured passage of the state&#x27;s Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act.

Cooper left the house after one term and was elected district attorney of the state&#x27;s Eighth Judicial District in 1925. He later served as a city attorney for Shelbyville. In the 1930s, he helped organize the Duck River Electric Membership Corporation, an electric cooperative.

==Governor==

In 1936 Cooper was elected to the Tennessee Senate, representing Bedford, Coffee, and Moore counties. In 1938, he ran for his party&#x27;s nomination for governor with the support of Memphis political boss E. H. Crump. Crump was at the height of his power in state politics and had had a falling out with the incumbent, Gordon Browning, over state appointments. He spent thousands of dollars on ads to boost Cooper&#x27;s image and assail Browning, and Cooper won the nomination, 231,852 votes to 158,854. In the general election, he defeated the Republican candidate, Howard Baker, Sr., 210,567 votes to 83,031.

In the 1940 governor&#x27;s race, Cooper defeated Knoxville inventor George Roby Dempster in the Democratic primary, and he defeated C. Arthur Bruce by a more than 2-to-1 margin in the general election. In the 1942 race, Judge J. Ridley Mitchell, who despised Crump, sought the party&#x27;s nomination for governor but was defeated by Cooper, 171,259 votes to 124,037. Cooper easily defeated Republican candidate C.N. Frazier in the general election. Constitutional term limits prevented Cooper from seeking reelection in 1944.

Cooper was Tennessee&#x27;s governor during World War II. In 1940, anticipating the U.S. entry into the war, he organized the Tennessee State Defense Council, which many other states would later imitate. He also coordinated the establishment of draft boards, organized a state guard to replace the National Guard (which had been called up to active service), and established a model Home Food Supply Program. Large defense-related facilities were built throughout the state, including Fort Campbell, most of which is in Tennessee despite its Kentucky address, a naval training base in Millington, and Sewart Air Force Base in Smyrna. Defense-related plants, employing thousands of Tennesseans, were also built, among them a gunpowder plant at Millington, a shell-loading factory in Milan, and an aircraft factory in Nashville.

In 1942, the federal government appropriated land in what is now Oak Ridge, Tennessee, for the top secret Manhattan Project which was developing the world&#x27;s first atomic bomb. Cooper was not informed of the purpose of the project. When Anderson Countians complained to Cooper of land appropriations, Cooper accused the federal government of stealing the land for a &quot;socialist&quot; project. When officially notified in July 1943 by an Army lieutenant of the presidential proclamation making the area a military district not subject to state control, he angrily ripped it to pieces. The new MED District Engineer Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Nichols had to placate him.

Along with defense mobilization, Cooper increased funding for state schools and implemented a program that provided free textbooks for children in grades 1 through 3. He increased aid to the elderly, established a system of tuberculosis hospitals, and acquired land for state parks and state forests. He cut the state payroll and placed taxes on alcohol, and he managed to reduce the state debt by $21 million. In January 1941, a Cooper-supported bill calling for a repeal of the state&#x27;s poll tax was introduced in the state legislature but was defeated. In 1943, the repeal passed but was thrown out by the Tennessee Supreme Court.

==Later life==

Cooper was among 12 nominated at the 1944 Democratic National Convention to serve as Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s running mate in the presidential election that year, receiving 26 votes. In 1946, Cooper was appointed U.S. Ambassador to Peru by President Harry Truman. He convinced Peru to repay an outstanding loan to the United States and had a reputation as a frugal entertainer. An Argentine newspaper accused Cooper of inciting a rebellion by APRA members in Callao in October 1948 (the rebellion took place several months after Cooper had left office), but Cooper adamantly denied any involvement.

Cooper was chairman of the limited state constitutional convention of 1953 which proposed eight amendments to the Tennessee State Constitution, all of which were subsequently adopted by voters. The most notable of these amendments included the repeal of the poll tax and the extension of the gubernatorial term from two years to four years.

Encouraged by pro-segregation interests, Cooper challenged freshman U.S. Senator Albert Gore Sr., in the 1958 Democratic primary but lost handily, with Gore taking about 60% of the vote. Cooper remained an active participant in Democratic Party events until his death from cancer on May 18, 1969, at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

==Family and legacy==

Cooper married Hortense Hayes Powell (1919–2017) in 1950. They had three sons: William Prentice Cooper, III, Jim Cooper, John Cooper. Since Cooper was a bachelor during his tenure as governor, his mother served as the state&#x27;s first lady. Jim is a former U.S. congressman, while John was mayor of Metro Nashville.

Prentice Cooper State Forest, located west of Chattanooga, is named for Cooper. Most of the land for the forest was acquired during Cooper&#x27;s tenure as governor. Residence halls at Tennessee Tech and the University of Tennessee at Martin have also been named for Cooper. Cooper&#x27;s house stands in Shelbyville and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="864142" wikidata="Q3215230" url="?curid=864142" title="Lake Texoma">
<text>Lake Texoma is one of the largest reservoirs in the United States, the 12th-largest US Army Corps of Engineers&#x27; (USACE) lake, and the largest in USACE Tulsa District. Lake Texoma is formed by Denison Dam on the Red River in Bryan County, Oklahoma, and Grayson County, Texas, about upstream from the mouth of the river. It is located at the confluence of the Red and Washita Rivers. The project was completed in 1944. The damsite is about northwest of Denison, Texas, and southwest of Durant, Oklahoma. Lake Texoma is the most developed and most popular lake within the USACE Tulsa District, attracting around 6 million visitors a year. Oklahoma has more of the lake within its boundaries than Texas.

==Hydrology==

===Tributaries and outlet===
Lake Texoma&#x27;s two main sources are the Red River from the west and Washita River from the north. Other notable sources include Big Mineral Creek, Little Mineral Creek, Buncombe Creek, Rock Creek, and Glasses Creek. Lake Texoma drains into the Red River at the Denison Dam.

===Water levels===
Normal elevation of the conservation pool varies from National Geodetic Vertical Datum depending on the time of year. The flood control pool extends to elevation . The lake has crested the dam&#x27;s spillway at a height of five times - once in 1957, 1990, and 2007, and on May 24 and June 18, 2015. (USACE 2003a) The lake&#x27;s previously highest elevation was recorded on May 6, 1990, at 644.76 feet. This record was broken on May 29, 2015, and the lake crested on June 1, 2015, at a new record elevation of 645.72 feet. The top of Denison Dam is at 670 feet.

===Saltwater from the Red River===
The Red River that formed Lake Texoma is a saltwater river due to salt deposits left over from a 250-million-year-old former sea that was in the current Texas-Oklahoma border region. As time passed, that sea evaporated, leaving salts deposits — mostly sodium chloride. Rock and silt eventually buried the deposits, but the salts continue to leach through natural seeps in tributaries above Lake Texoma, sending as much as 3,450 tons of salt per day flowing down the Red River. The problem with the water in the Red River is much of it is too salty and requires costly treatment, if it is usable at all. Due to this phenomenon, striped bass, a saltwater fish species, thrives in Lake Texoma. Lake Texoma is home to the only self-sustaining population of striped bass in Texas.

==Geography==

Lake Texoma is situated on the border between Oklahoma and Texas in the Oklahoma counties of Bryan, Marshall, Johnston, and Love, and the Texas counties of Grayson and Cooke. It has a surface area of 89,000 acres (360 km2), a conservation water volume of , and a flood-control volume of .

===Cities===
Notable cities surrounding the lake in Texas are Denison, Sherman, and Gainesville. In Oklahoma, the most notable city is Durant.

Other towns and cities near the lake in Bryan County, Oklahoma, include Cartwright, Colbert, Calera, Platter, and Mead. In Marshall County, Oklahoma, Madill and Kingston are the nearest cities, with many smaller communities near the lake including Enos, Little City, Cumberland, Kingston, New Woodville, McBride, Willis, and the unsubmerged portion of Aylesworth. Most of Aylesworth was submerged under the water of the lake. Other towns and cities in Texas include Gordonville, Locust, Fink, Pottsboro, and Preston.

===Islands===
Several small islands on Lake Texoma are accessible only by means of water transportation. Some of the island names include, in order from west to east, West Island, Wood Island, Hog Island, Treasure Island, Little Island, and North Island.

===Parks===
Lake Texoma features two state parks, being Lake Texoma State Park in Oklahoma and Eisenhower State Park in Texas. It also has 54 United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) managed parks. The northern and southern reaches of the lake each terminate within a National Wildlife Refuge.

==History==
Lake Texoma has grown in importance over the decades from primarily relief from annual flooding and destruction to an employment engine for the area, and finally a recreation mecca for the nation.

Mr. George Moulton who some consider the father of the Denison Dam was a Denison businessman who dreamed of placing a dam on the Red River at Baer’s Ferry as early as 1925. He began lobbying and talking to Chambers of Commerce in Denison and Durant in the late 1920s. Sam Rayburn joined the dream team in the early 1930s and was instrumental in the legislative process of making the great lake a reality.

The Flood Control Act of 1938 (Public Law No. 761, 75th Congress, 3rd Session) authorized funding for the Denison dam, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers set up the Denison District Office in June of that year. The first Commander was Captain Lucius D. Clay.

Lake Texoma was constructed during WWII. German prisoners of war were involved in the construction of the dam and were the first POWs to be used in a labor camp. These prisoners were from Rommel’s Afrika Korps and were housed in camps at Tishomingo and Powell, Oklahoma. Later, the Tishomingo POWs were housed in another camp at the spillway. Only non-war related work could be performed by POWs according to the Geneva Convention – such as clearing trees for the proposed lake and light construction. Construction projects performed by the prisoners included mortared stone lining of the drainage ditches around the damsite, which are still present today.

Construction of the dam was completed in January 1944 at a cost of $54 million ($881 million in 2022 dollars). The installation of the two generators was completed in September 1949. Initially Lake Texoma was authorized for flood control, hydropower and water supply. Recreation was not officially added as a project purpose by Congress until 1988.

The management of the lands around Lake Texoma was turned over to the National Park Service (NPS) in 1946 and they continued until 1949 when both agencies decided that the NPS would move out and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers would take over the operations and maintenance responsibilities. The National Park Service was always a reluctant partner in this arrangement and finally removed themselves from Texoma in 1949.

The lake attracted worldwide media attention in June 2015 when water was drained following a flood, causing a vortex with 2.5-m-wide hole to form.

In 2024, the border between Texas and Oklahoma was adjusted so that a North Texas Municipal Water District pump station on the lake was no longer bisected by the border.

==Popularity==
Lake Texoma&#x27;s popularity is largely attributed to its sheer size and proximity to the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. The lake is about an hour&#x27;s drive north from the metropolitan area. The Lake Texoma area, known simply as Texoma or Texomaland, is experiencing rapid economic growth due to heavy tourist use.

==Recreation==
Diverse recreational opportunities include two wildlife refuges, two state parks, 54 USACE-managed parks, 12 marinas, 26 resorts, hundreds of campgrounds, and a variety of golf courses. Power boating, sailing, personal watercraft, water skiing, and wind surfing are all popular. The lake has become a major sailing center based on its size, depth, and miles of sailing shoreline.

During the spring break and Fourth of July holidays, many college students home for the holidays gather in an area called &quot;Fobb Bottom&quot; on the Oklahoma side.

Lake Texoma is also home to the Lakefest Regatta, widely considered to be the first inland charity regatta in the United States. The event typically attracts up to 100 keelboats and more than 500 sailors each spring. Since its inception, Lakefest has raised more than $2 million in support of various children’s charities in North Texas. The current beneficiary is the Make-A-Wish Foundation® of North Texas.

Former professional funny car race driver &quot;Flash&quot; Gordon Mineo organized many &quot;poker run&quot; events on Lake Texoma. Gordon and his wife, Ann Mineo, along with three others, died September 2, 2006, in a boating accident on Lake Texoma.

===Fishing===
In 2004, a blue catfish was pulled from the lake that weighed , temporarily setting a world weight record for rod-and-reel-caught catfish. The fish was moved to a freshwater aquarium in Athens, Texas. More commonly, catfish in Lake Texoma weigh between .

===Camping===
Many campgrounds, both public and private, exist along the shores of Lake Texoma. Among these are Eisenhower State Park, named for President Dwight Eisenhower, who was born in nearby Denison; Camp All Saints owned by the Episcopal Diocese of Dallas; and James Ray Scout Reservation, owned by the Circle Ten Council of the Boy Scouts of America.

==Fees==
Because of a need to pay for maintenance and improvements, the State of Oklahoma has imposed a use fee on some Lake Texoma State Park visitors effective June 15, 2020.

==Private development initiatives==

Recently, several large transfers of public land to private developers have been authorized by the federal government.

The Water Resources Development Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-53 113 Stat. 359), authorized USACE to sell to the state of Oklahoma about of federally owned land on the north shore of Lake Texoma in Marshall County, Oklahoma, under lease at that time to the Oklahoma Tourism and Recreation Department. The land was part of the Lake Texoma State Park, a conglomerate of state-owned and federally owned lands leased to the state, totaling around . The park was home to numerous state- and concession-operated facilities and activities, including a resort lodge with 106 guest rooms and suites.

Initially, the State of Oklahoma Commissioners of the Land Office purchased only from USACE in March 2007. Soon after, the state reached an agreement with Pointe Vista Development, LLC, for the sale of roughly 750 acres (to include the land purchased from USACE and land already owned by the state) for the development of home sites and an upscale resort. Pointe Vista is a partnership between Mark Fischer, president and chief executive of Chaparral Energy, and Aubrey McClendon, chairman and chief executive of Chesapeake Energy. Also in 2007, the Governor of Oklahoma, Brad Henry, indicated that the state would likely purchase all or most of the remaining land at Texoma State Park under lease from USACE to transfer to Pointe Vista for further development. The new development is proposed to include 18–36 holes of championship golf, a club house and practice facility, aquatic center, outdoor recreation center, nature parks, campgrounds, retail shops, and an amphitheater. The new development will cost an estimated $360 million, which will also include housing, as well as a full-service hotel with restaurants, gym, business center, multiple swimming pools, spa, and meeting rooms. The proposed private community will have 250–350 high-end homes, ranging in size from .

The Lake Texoma Lodge, built in 1951, officially closed its doors on December 1, 2006. The lodge was in poor repair, resulting in a steady decline in the facility&#x27;s use. The lodge has since been demolished.

Section 3182(j) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2007, authorized USACE to convey approximately of land at Lake Texoma to the city of Denison, Texas. The provision was backed by U.S. Congressman Ralph Hall (R) as an economic development initiative. The sale is to be at fair market value and the city of Denison is responsible for all costs associated with the transaction (costs for completing NEPA compliance documentation, surveys, appraisals, USACE administrative costs, etc.). The city in turn intends to sell the property to George Schuler, a local developer, for the creation of a private residential and recreational development on the conveyed land and adjacent land already owned by Mr. Schuler. The eventual development may result in as many as 10,000 residents locating in the Grandpappy Point area.

The city and Mr. Schuler attempted to lease the same land from the Corps of Engineers in 2004, but abandoned those attempts in favor of legislation mandating the transfer, due to the inability to use the land for the intended purposes under a lease without an update of the Corps Shoreline Management Plan (SMP) for Lake Texoma. The majority of the land is currently zoned as Limited Development, Protected Area (suitable for nature hiking, birdwatching, etc.) and Aesthetic or Scenic areas. The Corps has previously stated that any revision of the SMP will require the completion of a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) for the entire Lake Texoma project that will consider the cumulative impacts of the extensive development that has occurred around the Lake since the original EIS was conducted in the 1970s. Completion of a lake-wde SEIS has been estimated by the Corps to take up to 2 years to complete at a cost of approximately $2.5 million. Since Section 3182(j) contained no provisions exempting the sale from the requirements of NEPA, it is expected that completion of the SEIS and revision of the SMP will also be required prior to completion of the sale, and that the city of Denison will be required to bear that as a cost associated with the transaction.. Ultimately, were transferred in 2013.

<text>The Stahlhelm (German for &quot;steel helmet&quot;) is a term used to refer to a series of German steel combat helmet designs intended to protect the wearer from common battlefield hazards such as shrapnel.

The armies of the great powers began to issue steel helmets during World War I as a result of combat experience and experimentation. The German Army began to replace the boiled leather &quot;Pickelhaube&quot; with the &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; in 1916. The &quot;Stahlhelm&#x27;s&quot; distinctive &quot;coal scuttle&quot; shape, was instantly recognizable and became a common element of propaganda on both sides, like the &quot;Pickelhaube&quot; before it. The name was used by &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot;, a German veterans&#x27; organization that existed from 1918 to 1935.

After World War II, both East and West German militaries adopted helmets unrelated to the archetypical German helmet designs from the world wars, but continued to refer to the new models as &quot;Stahlhelm&quot;. The WWII era Stahlhelm continued to be used by police and border guards in West Germany until the 1990s, when they were replaced by modern kevlar helmets.

==Historical Context &amp; Origin==
Before the Great War, most types of military headdress were not designed for protection. Most militaries had adopted either a cap or helmet, usually made of fabric or leather. Only some types of cavalry retained a metal helmet, albeit these were designed to protect against sabre blows rather than the causes of injury that would become prevalent in the war.

With the growing prevalence of artillery and the widespread adoption of trench warfare, the proportion of casualties on all sides suffering head injuries rose dramatically. Numerous units on both sides independently developed and locally produced their own ad hoc protective helmets starting in 1915. Stationed in the rocky area of the Vosges, Army Detachment Gaede recorded significantly more head injuries caused by stones and shell fragments than other units elsewhere. The artillery workshop of the Army Detachment developed a helmet that consisted of a cloth and leather skullcap with a steel plate (6 mm thickness). The plate protected not only the forehead but also the eyes and nose.

While the Germans were the first to initiate development of a modern combat helmet, they were plagued by red tape and inaction. The French were the first country to adopt and issue their Adrian helmet to units starting in 1915. The British Empire followed suit later that year with the Brodie helmet.

==Development==

The design of the &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; was carried out by Dr Friedrich Schwerd of the Technical Institute of Hanover. In early 1915, Schwerd had carried out a study of head wounds suffered during trench warfare and submitted a recommendation for steel helmets, shortly after which he was ordered to Berlin. Schwerd then undertook the task of designing and producing a suitable helmet, broadly based on the 15th-century sallet, which provided good protection for the head and neck.

After lengthy development work, which included testing a selection of German and Allied headgear, the first &quot;stahlhelm&quot; were tested in November 1915 at the Kummersdorf Proving Ground and then field-tested by the 1st Assault Battalion. Thirty thousand examples were ordered, but it was not approved for general issue until New Year of 1916, hence it is most usually referred to as the &quot;Model 1916&quot;. In February 1916 it was distributed to troops at Verdun, following which the incidence of serious head injuries fell dramatically. The first German troops to use this helmet were the stormtroopers of the &quot;Sturm-Bataillon Nr. 5 (Rohr)&quot;, commanded by Captain Willy Rohr.

In contrast to the Hadfield steel used in the British Brodie helmet, the Germans used a harder martensitic silicon/nickel steel. As a result, and also due to the helmet&#x27;s form, the &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; had to be formed in heated dies at a greater unit cost than the British helmet, which could be formed in one piece.

Like the British and French, German troops identified highly with their helmets. The &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; became a popular symbol of paramilitary groups after the First World War. Such was the attachment of the World War One generation to the design that it was reportedly the reason that Hitler rejected a modernised, sloping helmet design to replace it.

==&quot;Stahlhelm&quot; use in other countries==
Germany exported versions of the M1935 helmet to various countries. Versions of the M1935 &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; were sent to Republic of China from 1935 to 1936 and the M1935 was the main helmet of the Chinese Nationalist Army (especially the &quot;central&quot; divisions) during World War II. Spain also received shipments of the helmet. During the inter-war years, several military missions were sent to South America under the command of Hans Kundt. After the Chaco War, the Bolivian army adopted the &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; and continued using it until recently. The exported M1935 helmets were similar to the German issue, except for a different liner.

Some countries manufactured their own helmets using the M1935 design, and this basic design was in use in various nations as late as the 1970s.
The Germans helped the Hungarians copy the M1935 design. The WWII M38 Hungarian steel helmet is nearly identical to the German M1935. Both have almost the same shape, riveted ventilation holes, and the classic rolled edge. Differences include somewhat rougher Hungarian finishing, a different liner and different rivets position – the split pins are situated behind the ventilation holes. A square metal bracket is riveted on the rear, above the back brim, to secure the helmet to the knapsack while marching. It was typically painted in Hungarian brown-green, though blue-grey versions existed. It is sometimes called the &quot;Finnish M35&quot; due to its extensive use by the Finnish Army during the Continuation War 1941–44.

After World War I Poland seized large quantities of M1918 helmets. Most were later sold to various countries, including Spain. However, at the end of the 1930s, it was discovered that the standard Polish wz. 31 helmet was unsuitable for tank troops and motorized units; while offering decent protection, it was too large and heavy. As a stop-gap measure before a new helmet was developed, the General Staff decided to issue M1918 helmets to the 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade, which used them during the September Campaign.

During the time of the Warsaw Uprising the helmet was also worn by the members of the Polish Home Army and it was during this time that the helmet became the symbol of the resistance, as every &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; worn by a soldier of the underground army signified a dead German occupier it was taken from.

In November 1926, the Irish Defence Forces adopted the &quot;Stahlhelm&quot;. As the Treaty of Versailles barred Germany from exporting steel helmets, the Irish turned to London-based Vickers, ordering 5,000 copies of a model closely resembling the M1918 helmet. The helmet remained in use until it was replaced by the British Mark II model in 1940. Following the outbreak of World War II, the helmets became the subject of anti-Irish propaganda in Britain. A large number of the withdrawn helmets were reissued to various emergency services after being painted white.

Switzerland used a helmet, designated the M1918, that was roughly similar to the M1916 but had a shallower, wider and more rounded crown and skirt. This was to protect against the harsh winter winds of the alpine regions.

The Chilean Army was a prolific user of the Vulkanfiber models, bought before the Second World War, along with a few M1935 and Czechoslovak M32 helmets. After the war, local production of lightweight fiber and plastic models started, which are still in ceremonial &amp; garrison use today. Small runs of steel helmets were made by FAMAE in the late 90s, either newly made or by reforming M1 Helmet shells, but ultimately were not adopted due to the ascendance of kevlar and synthetic ballistic fiber helmets by that time. A &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; with crossed bayonets and the corresponding number is the standard insignia of infantry regiments.

The Imperial Iranian Army used small numbers of the Vulkanfiber model, mostly with the Imperial Guard and a few units around Tehran, acquired prior to the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran.

During World War II, the Argentine Army adopted a similar model made of pressed fibre. For combat and provincial police use, imported Swiss M1918 Helmets were still in service as late as 1976.

In the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, due to large quantities captured by World War II Partisans, the &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; was used in Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army up to 1959, when it was phased out and replaced by the M59/85 steel helmet.

=== Postwar ===

After World War II, West Germany&#x27;s Bundesgrenzschutz border guards and some West German police units kept the &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; in their inventories (police units can be seen wearing them during footage of the Black September hostage crisis in 1972), and the Fallschirmjäger variant was used for some time by the GSG 9. With the re-armament of West Germany the Bundeswehr introduced the United States Army M1 Helmet which was replaced by a Kevlar helmet (&quot;Gefechtshelm&quot;), similar to the modern US helmets, in the 1990s. German firefighter units today still use &quot;Stahlhelm&quot;-shaped helmets in a fluorescent colour.

East Germany&#x27;s National People&#x27;s Army M-56 helmet was modelled on an unused 1942 German design with a more conical shape. The Chilean Army still uses the &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; design for ceremonial purposes, as does the Bolivian Army. There are also some Japanese bicycle helmets (with accompanying goggles) that resemble the &quot;Stahlhelm&quot;. Many schools and universities in Mexico such as the Autonomous University of Baja California have military bands that use or resemble the M35 &quot;Stahlhelm&quot;.

The U.S. Army&#x27;s 1980s and 1990s era Kevlar Personnel Armor System for Ground Troops Helmet was sometimes called the &quot;Fritz helmet&quot; for its resemblance to the &quot;Stahlhelm&quot;. The U.S. Army and Marines have continued to use a design akin to the PASGT helmet with the MICH TC-2000 Combat Helmet and Lightweight Helmet, respectively.

The Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army soldiers still used M1935 helmets which were captured from the Chinese Nationalist Army during the Chinese Civil War until the 1970s.

Since 2012, El Salvador&#x27;s Policia Nacional Civil use a navy/indigo blue-coloured helmet that strongly resembles the &quot;Stahlhelm&quot;; this helmet is used by some members of the riot-control unit and rarely used by the Police&#x27;s assault teams.

==Variants==
The different &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; designs are named for their year of introduction. For example, the &quot;Modell 1942&quot; which was introduced in 1942 is commonly known as &quot;M1942&quot; or simply &quot;M42&quot;. Here, they are referred to by their M19&quot;XX&quot; names.

=== M1916 and M1917 ===


The &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; was introduced into regular service during the Verdun campaign in early 1916.

The M1916 design had side-mounted horn-like ventilator lugs which were intended to support an additional steel brow plate or &quot;Stirnpanzer&quot;, which saw limited use only by snipers and trench raiding parties, as it was too heavy for general use.

The shell came in different sizes, from 60 to 68, with some size 70s reported. Helmet weight varied from 0.98 kg to 1.4 kg, depending on shell size. The suspension, or liner, consisted of a headband with three segmented leather pouches, each holding padding materials, and leather or fabric cords that could be adjusted to provide a comfortable fit. The one-piece leather chin strap was attached to the shell by M1891 chinstrap lugs, the same kind used in the Pickelhaube helmet.

The M1916 design provided excellent protection. Reserve Lieutenant Walter Schulze of 8th Company Reserve Infantry Regiment 76 described his combat introduction to the helmet on the Somme, 29 July 1916:

... suddenly, with a great clanging thud, I was hit on the forehead and knocked flying onto the floor of the trench... a shrapnel bullet had hit my helmet with great violence, without piercing it, but sufficiently hard to dent it. If I had, as had been usual up until a few days previously, been wearing a cap, then the Regiment would have had one more man killed.

But the helmet had a few flaws. The ventilator horns often let cold air in during the winter, requiring the wearer to block the vents with mud or fabric. The large, flared skirt tended to make it difficult for soldiers to hear, distorting surrounding sounds and creating an echo when the wearer spoke.

Originally painted &quot;Feldgrau&quot; (field grey), the &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; was often camouflaged by troops in the field using mud, foliage, cloth covers, and paint. Official issue cloth covers in white and grey appeared in late 1916 and early 1917. Camouflage paint was not formally introduced until July 1918, when German Army Order II, No 91 366, signed by General Erich Ludendorff on 7 July 1918, outlined official standards for helmet camouflage. The order stipulated that helmets should be painted in several colours, separated by a finger-wide black line. The colours should be relevant to the season, such as using green, brown and ochre in summer. In the closing months, some experiments were conducted on the Stahlhelm paint. &quot;Wollstaub&quot; was one such paint iteration that was infused with crushed felt in hopes of glare reduction.

After the effectiveness of the M1916 design was validated during the 1916 campaigns, incremental improvements were subsequently made. The M1917 version saw improvements to the liner but was otherwise identical to the original design.

=== M1918 ===
Introduced on February 12, 1918 Extensive redesigns were made for the M1918 model. A new two-piece chin strap was introduced and was attached directly to the helmet liner rather than the shell. Certain examples of the M1918 had cutouts in the rim along the sides of the helmet. This iteration was dubbed the cavalry or telephone talker helmet, despite the fact that it was intended to be utilized by all units. It has incorrectly been said that these cutouts were to accommodate headphones while wearing the helmet. These cutouts were actually done to improve hearing and to reduce echo created by the large, flared skirt. About ten thousand were created in the closing months of the war.

The M1918 &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; can be distinguished from the M1916, as the M1918 shell lacks the chinstrap rivet on the lower side of the helmet skirt found on earlier models.

A modified variant of the M1918 was also made, referred to as the Armored Warfare Stahlhelm, created in sparing amounts for tank crews. The only difference from previous models was the reduction of the visor extending over the eyes to allow for better visibility.

=== Austro-Hungarian variants ===

Austria-Hungary purchased about 416,000 German helmets from November 1916 until the end of the war and also began its own licensed production starting in May 1917. Around a million &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; of all variants were issued until the end of the war.

==== Austro-Hungarian M17 ====
The Austrian M17 helmet was similar to the German M16, it was indicated &quot;nach deutschem Muster“ i.e. &quot;following Germany&#x27;s example&quot;. It was coloured golden-brown (known as Isonzo-braun), had a cloth chinstrap, an Austrian chinstrap bale and had the chinstrap rivet located higher up on the steel shell. From May 1917 till the end of World War I 534,013 were produced, many of which were manufactured at the Krupp in Berndorf, Lower Austria.
Other known production locations were:
* Adolf Westen factory in Celje, present day Slovenia
* Brüder Gottlieb u. Brauchbar in Brno, present day Czech Republic
* Bleckmann &amp; Poldihutte in Kladno, present day Czech Republic
* C. A. Scholtz in Matejovce, Poprad, present day Slovakia
* Nădrag, present day Romania
* Reșița, present day Romania
* Weiss Manfréd Acél- és Fémművek in Csepel, Budapest, present day Hungary
* Bruder Lapp in Rottenmann, present day Austria
* Warchalowski, Eissler &amp; Co in Vienna, present day Austria
* Gebruder Bohler &amp; Co. in Kapfenberg, present day Austria.

==== Austro-Hungarian M18 ====
This helmet is known by collectors as Hungarian M18 variant and it was similar to the Austrian M17 design, but the chinstrap rivet was smaller in size and located even higher up than the Austrian version. It was coloured in golden-brown (known as Isonzo-braun). Another difference was in the attachment method of the chinstrap, it was fixed to the same rivet that held the liner metal ring. These were manufactured at the Krupp in Berndorf.

==== Berndorfer variant ====
There was also a quite different, domestically developed Berndorfer variant. It was indicated as &quot;österreichisches Muster&quot; i.e. Austrian mode. 139,968 were produced from May till November 1917 at the Krupp in Berndorf.

=== Ottoman variant ===
The formation in 1917 by the Ottoman Empire of stormtrooper battalions following the German model prompted the requirement for steel helmets, as these had not previously been adopted. Although German helmets were ordered, Ottoman officers believed that the design impeded the soldiers&#x27; ability to hear orders in the field and requested that the visor, ear and neck protectors be removed, which was done using grinding machines. Germany delivered 5,400 visorless versions of the M1918 helmet for the Ottoman Empire. The missing front visor was thought by the Germans to be for religious reasons, and it was claimed that it was to allow Turkish soldiers to touch their foreheads to the ground during prayer, without removing their helmets. However, this story has been disputed. The Turks rejected any more than the 5,400 delivered and an unknown number from the overrun were issued to German armed forces and were used by German Freikorps units after the war.

=== M1933 ===

In 1932 the Army High Command ordered the testing of a new prototype helmet intended to replace the older models. It was made entirely from a composite plastic material called &quot;Vulkanfiber&quot;. The Model 1933 Vulkanfiber helmet kept the basic form of previous helmets but was much lighter. It was put into limited production following favourable field tests in early 1933 and small numbers were issued to Reichswehr infantry, artillery and communications units. It was removed from service following the introduction of the M1935 helmet and most of the remaining stock were reissued to civil organizations such as fire brigades and police forces. Some examples were also retained for parade use by senior officers, who were not generally issued with the &quot;Stahlhelm&quot;.

=== M1935 ===
In 1934 tests began on an improved &quot;Stahlhelm&quot;, whose design was a development of World War I models. The company &quot;Eisenhüttenwerke Thale&quot; (today Thaletec) carried out prototype design and testing, with Dr Friedrich Schwerd once again taking a hand.

The new helmet was pressed from sheets of molybdenum steel in several stages. The size of the flared visor and skirt was reduced, and the large projecting lugs for the obsolete armour shield were eliminated. The ventilator holes were retained but were set in smaller hollow rivets mounted to the helmet&#x27;s shell. The edges of the shell were rolled over, creating a smooth edge along the helmet. Finally, a completely new leather suspension, or liner, was incorporated that greatly improved the helmet&#x27;s safety, adjustability, and comfort for each wearer. These improvements made the new M1935 helmet lighter, more compact, and more comfortable to wear than the previous designs.

The Army&#x27;s Supreme Command within the Third Reich&#x27;s &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; or combined armed forces officially accepted the new helmet on June 25, 1935 and it was intended to replace all other helmets in service.

More than 1 million M1935 helmets were manufactured in the first two years after its introduction, and millions more were produced until 1940 when the basic design and production methods were changed.

===Gladiator civil defense helmet===
In 1938, the Germans developed a variant of the &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; with a wider, flared peak and ventilation holes originally intended for civil defense and Luftschutz personnel. Known as the gladiator pattern, the privately purchased Luftschutz helmet was originally made from three pieces of steel and typically painted black or dark blue. Later in the war these were issued to Volkssturm personnel, and sometimes repainted in Feldgrün. By 1944, the helmets were stamped from a single steel sheet, and the original leather lining replaced with vinyl or cloth to reduce costs. A modified postwar version in fluorescent green, white or yellow continued to be issued to rescue workers in the Bundesrepublik until the early 1990s.

=== M1940 ===
The M1935 design was slightly modified in 1940 to simplify its construction, the manufacturing process now incorporating more automated stamping methods. The principal change was to stamp the ventilator hole mounts directly onto the shell, rather than utilizing separate fittings. In other respects, the M1940 helmet was identical to the M1935. The Germans still referred to the M1940 as the M1935, while the M1940 designation were given by collectors.

====&quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; version====
A variant of the M1935 helmet with a shell lacking the projecting visor and deep flared rim was issued to (German paratrooper) units. It was so designed in order to lessen the risk of head injury on landing after a parachute jump; also to reduce the significant wind resistance and resulting neck trauma. Early helmets were manufactured from existing M1935 helmets by removing the undesirable projections, which were omitted when the new design entered full production. The modified shell also incorporated a completely different and more substantial liner and chinstrap design that provided far more protection for German airborne troops. The chinstrap featured a four-point retention system that has come into use again by modern combat helmets such as the MICH since the late 1990s.

=== M1942 ===
The M1942 design was a result of wartime demands, by order of Hitler, to ‘maintain intimidation but reduce cost’. The rolled edge on the shell was eliminated, creating an unfinished edge along the rim. This edge slightly flared out, along the base of the skirt, reducing the protection the helmet gave. The elimination of the rolled edge expedited the manufacturing process and reduced the amount of metal used in each helmet. Shell paint colours were typically matte grey-green (Heer) or grey-blue (Luftwaffe), and the decals were eliminated in 1943 to speed up production and reduce the helmet&#x27;s combat visibility. Greater manufacturing flaws were also observed in M1942 helmets made late in the war.

=== M1944 ===
A new variant, designed in 1942 by the Institute for Defence Technical Materials Science in Berlin, was the so called M44. It was stamped out of one piece of metal, but with sloped sides. It was similar in appearance to the British 1944 Type Mk III helmet. They were tested in three variant models B, B/II, and C. The one selected for extensive tests was the B/II. They were produced by the Thale Eisenhuttenwerke. The B/II will inspire the East German M56 in fact they looked very similar. M44 helmet was never approved for service and it remained a prototype.

=== M1945 ===
There have been reports of a variant manufactured in the last months of the war. The M1945 was reported to have been similar to the M1942 design but did away completely with the ventilator. These helmets are reported to be extremely rare. Many collectors and historians are of the opinion that the M1945 helmet is just a regular M1942 helmet that lacked the vents simply because of machine malfunctions in the factory, or unfinished M1942 helmets that were completed in the post-war era.

=== East Germany ===

==== M1954 ====
It was an evolution of the prototype M1944 with a modified and more squared line. The appearance of the helmet was a transitional way between the M35 and the M44. It was nicknamed &quot;Kesslerbombe&quot; as a reference to the general Heinz Keßler. It was used by the KVP of the GDR and it was fitted with two different suspension systems during its life in service. The first one fixed with three rivets as in the WW2 models, the second type required further holes in the helmet shell. It was substituted by the helmet M1956.

==== M1956 ====
The East German M-56 helmet was inspired by the 1942 designed helmet, intended as a replacement for the M1935/M1940 model &quot;Stahlhelm&quot;. It was initially developed for the Wehrmacht by the Institute for Defense Technical Materials Science in Berlin (see &quot;M1944&quot; above). The helmet had seen trials since 1943 but was not adopted during World War II.

The design was not used until the requirement for a distinct German helmet for the Volkspolizei and the National People&#x27;s Army arose. The East German leadership was motivated in large part by a desire to avoid provoking the offence that using a traditional &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; design would have caused East Germany&#x27;s Warsaw Pact allies (especially Czechoslovakia, Poland and the Soviet Union), but a more practical military necessity was also present due to the continued use of surplus &quot;Stahlhelme&quot; by West German units, in particular border guards. Moreover, the East Germans suspected the West could re-issue the &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; on a general basis in the Bundeswehr at any time and therefore needed a helmet that was easily distinguishable from that of their potential enemy. For both reasons, the 1942 design was likely chosen because it was the most similar of all German designs to the most recognizable Soviet helmets, in particular the iconic SSh-40 design. Such a design not only served a political purpose but was one that NATO armies were unlikely to duplicate closely. Indeed, the M-56 was similar enough in appearance to the SSh-40 that some Westerners failed to realize its German origins altogether and assumed the East Germans had adopted a Soviet design.

The M-56 helmet came in three basic versions, Mod 1 or I/56, Mod 2 or I/57 and Mod 3 or I/71, and was widely sold (or given) to Third World armies.

=== West Germany ===

==== M40/51 ====
When the Bundesgrenzschutz (BGS) (Federal Border Guards of Germany) was formed in 1951, it was supplied with old salvaged and refurbished M35, M40 or M42 helmets. Among the changes made, there was the replacement of the interior and the introduction of new eyelets for the chinstrap, some welded inside the helmet some even fixed to the helmet with rivets. The helmets for the BGS were repainted in dark green RAL 6012.

With the progressive depletion of stocks, starting from 1951 new helmets were produced following the construction rules of the M40 model. Regarding the interior, was used the simplified M31 type, with a chinstrap directly fixed to it, (adopted above all by the police forces of the Länder), and a liner with a chinstrap fixed to the helmet according to the methods described above; this version was adopted by the BGS.

==== M40/53 ====
Starting in 1953, a further update of the interior was introduced with the type called I53, developed by the company Schuberth Werke Braunschweig.

This interior was no longer fixed with the classic three nails that ran along the helmet shell but by a screw placed inside, in the centre of the upper part of the helmet.

For this reason the helmet is recognizable from the previous versions by the absence of the rivets on the shell. In later versions, the ventilation holes were also removed. As regards to the fastening of the chinstrap, were used the same solutions of the previous model.

==== M56 &amp; M1A1 ====

The West German M-56 &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; was a direct copy of the U.S. M1 helmet. It was properly called &quot;zweiteiliger &quot;Stahlhelm&quot;&quot; (two-piece steel helmet). In 1958 the helmet was made as a one-piece helmet and renamed &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; M1A1. The M1A1 came in three sizes: 66, 68, and 71. This helmet was used until 1981 when a modified version was released and renamed the Helm1A1. Modifications included a 3-point chin strap with the third point connecting at the nape, extra-large sizes, and a further adjustable liner.

The M1A1 &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; remained in service until 1992 when the Bundeswehr replaced it with a PASGT-derived kevlar helmet called the &quot;Gefechtshelm&quot; (&quot;Combat helmet&quot;).

==Decals and insignia==
After &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; shells were painted, the colours of which varied by organization, small identification or insignia decals usually were affixed to one or both sides of the helmet. Almost every military, naval, and political organization had its own distinctive insignia, which was applied as decals to the sides of helmets. The right side of early M35 helmets bore the tricolored shield of black, white, and red stripes, the traditional national colors of the pre-WWI German Empire (cf. the black, red, and gold of today&#x27;s Federal Republic of Germany, harking back to the 1848 Revolt). The left side of the shell often received decal insignia denoting the branch of the armed forces, or &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, or an organization within the Nazi Party.

The combined &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; military forces of Nazi Germany consisted of the &quot;Heer&quot; (army), the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; (navy), and the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; (air force). While not technically part of the Wehrmacht, the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; (&quot;Armed-SS&quot;) tactically operated as such and was considered part of Germany&#x27;s armed forces during the war. The same was true of some &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) units, along with other subsidiary organizations, which functioned as part of the armed forces particularly towards the end of the war. Wehrmacht branches typically displayed distinctive emblems in the form of decals on their helmets. The Heer, or army, displayed a black shield bearing the frontal view of a silver-coloured German eagle holding a swastika in its talons (known as the &quot;Reichsadler&quot;), while the navy used the same eagle emblem in gold. Luftwaffe decals displayed the side view of an eagle in flight, also holding a swastika. The SS was both a paramilitary and a political organization, and its black runic initials on a silver-coloured shield (normally applied to the right side of the shell) looked like twin lightning bolts. Other military, political, and civil or defence organizations used similar decal insignia to distinguish their helmets. Such visible identification devices were gradually abandoned as the war progressed, however, so that by war&#x27;s end most Wehrmacht helmet insignia had been eliminated to reduce the wearer&#x27;s visibility in combat.

For the Chinese Nationalist Army soldiers, their M35 helmets were stencilled with the Chinese Nationalist Insignia on the left side. Bolivian Army personnel carry the national flag and Wiphala decals on their Stahlhelms when in the full dress.

<text>Aljaž Tower () or the Triglav Tower () is a tower, a storm shelter and a triangulation point on the summit of Mount Triglav in northwestern Slovenia. Along with Triglav, it is a landmark of Slovenia and a symbol of the Slovenehood. The tower was designed by Jakob Aljaž, a priest in the Upper Carniolan village of Dovje, who also had it erected, in 1895. Today it is owned by the state, tended by the and stands on a parcel belonging to the Municipality of Bohinj.

==History==
In early 1895, hoping to be able to restrain the increased interest of foreigners in the Slovene mountains, Aljaž drew up with a chalk on the floor of his room in the Parish of Dovje plans for a cylindrical tower with a flag on its top. In April that year, he purchased the summit of Triglav for the sum of one florin from the then Municipality of Dovje. Having done so, he secured himself the right to erect a building on his own real property. The tower was constructed from iron and zinc-coated sheet steel by Anton Belec from Šentvid near Ljubljana. He and four workers brought the parts of the tower to the summit of Triglav and put the tower together in only five hours on 7 August 1895. Its opening ceremony and blessing took place in a small circle on 22 August that year.

Aljaž donated the shelter to the Alpine Association of Slovenia. In the beginning, there were three four-legged chairs, a summit register, a spirit stove, and the image &quot;The Triglav Panorama&quot; by Marko Pernhart in the tower. It was later repainted and renovated several times by Alojz Knafelc and others. In the communist era, as the highest point of the former Yugoslavia, it was painted red and decorated with a red star. However, it has more or less retained its original appearance. The star was removed shortly before the dissolution of Yugoslavia. On the proclamation of Slovene independence in June 1991, the flag of Slovenia was ceremonially raised at the tower. On 5 October 1999, the tower and its immediate surroundings were proclaimed a site of national cultural importance for Slovenia.

The tower was removed from the summit by helicopter for restoration on September 7, 2018,
and put back on 3 October same year.

<text>The Lancia 1Z and the Lancia 1ZM were two variations of an Italian armoured car built during World War I and which saw limited service during that war, the interwar period, and during World War II. The name is often misspelled as Lancia IZM.

==Design==
In 1916, the Lancia 1Z armoured car was built by Ansaldo of Italy. It was the most common of the early Italian armoured cars. Based on a Lancia truck, the armoured car was an advanced design for its day. For firepower the vehicle was equipped with twin turret mounted machine guns. The initial ten vehicles featured a further small turret on top with yet another machine gun. This gave the vehicle considerable firepower for the time. As a result of experiences in World War I, steel rails were installed over the top of the vehicle for cutting wire. Having had good results with the early car, another production run of a slightly modified version (the Lancia 1ZM) or &quot;Model 1918&quot; was ordered. The major difference between the 1Z and 1ZM was that the 1ZM did not have the top turret with the extra machine gun.

The Lancia 1ZM was the second batch of Ansaldo-Lancia armoured cars built. 110 cars of the improved model were ordered in 1917 and all were delivered before the end of 1918. Sometimes difficult to identify from the original Lancia 1Z (&quot;Model 1916&quot;), the most obvious difference is the removal of the top machine gun turret. This left the 1ZM with just the one larger, twin machine gun turret. Other features that will help are that the first 1ZM&#x27;s usually have two spare tyres mounted on the right side of the vehicle (on the 1Z they were under the rear). The cooling vents and front armour of the engine compartment are slightly different and there are fewer vision ports in the armoured crew compartment. The front bumpers were also simplified. However, some of the original 1Z series were modified to initial 1ZM standard by the removal of the extra top turret and up-dating the chassis. This makes it possible to find photos of 1ZM armoured cars with both 1Z and 1ZM features. American troops on the Italian Front during World War I trained with and used some of these vehicles.

==In combat==
The Lancia 1Z/1ZM armoured car saw little combat in World War I due to the mountainous terrain in which the Italian Royal Army (&quot;Regio Esercito&quot;) fought. However, a few were deployed in the northern parts of the country where they saw combat against the Austro-Hungarian Army. A Lancia 1Z captured by the Austro-Hungarian Army was assigned, along with one Romfell armoured car, two Junovicz P.A.1 armored cars, a captured Isotta-Fraschini armored car and a captured Austin armored car to K.u.K. Panzerautozug No.1 near Udine in June 1918, where the unit saw little to no action.

After World War I, Lancia 1Z/1ZM armoured cars were sent to North Africa and to East Africa for policing duties. A few cars were also sent to the Albanian Kingdom where they were to form the sole armoured force of the country for many years. Some Lancia 1Z/1ZMs played a minor role during the Italian invasion and the occupation of Ethiopia. Some Lancia 1Z/1ZMs were sent to Spain during the Spanish Civil War and were used by the Italian Corps of Volunteer Troops (&quot;Corpo Truppe Volontarie Italia&quot;, or CTV). These armoured cars were already hopelessly outdated by this point and performed poorly against the Spanish Republican forces.

A few obsolete Lancia 1Z/1ZM armoured cars were still in use with the Italian Royal Army during World War II. In 1940 and 1941, several vehicles served with the Royal Army during the East African Campaign. In some instances, operable machines were pressed into service by other Axis forces after the Armistice of Cassibile in September 1943. In the service of the forces of Nazi Germany, the vehicle was identified as the &quot;Panzerspähwagen 1ZM (i)&quot;.

<doc id="864149" wikidata="Q4795848" url="?curid=864149" title="Arrangement of lines">
<text>In geometry, an arrangement of lines is the subdivision of the Euclidean plane formed by a finite set of lines. An arrangement consists of bounded and unbounded convex polygons, the &quot;cells&quot; of the arrangement, line segments and rays, the &quot;edges&quot; of the arrangement, and points where two or more lines cross, the &quot;vertices&quot; of the arrangement. When considered in the projective plane rather than in the Euclidean plane, every two lines cross, and an arrangement is the projective dual to a finite set of points. Arrangements of lines have also been considered in the hyperbolic plane, and generalized to &quot;pseudolines&quot;, curves that have similar topological properties to lines. The initial study of arrangements has been attributed to an 1826 paper by Jakob Steiner.

An arrangement is said to be &quot;simple&quot; when at most two lines cross at each vertex, and &quot;simplicial&quot; when all cells are triangles (including the unbounded cells, as subsets of the projective plane). There are three known infinite families of simplicial arrangements, as well as many &quot;sporadic simplicial arrangements&quot; that do not fit into any known family. Arrangements have also been considered for infinite but locally finite systems of lines. Certain infinite arrangements of parallel lines can form simplicial arrangements, and one way of constructing the aperiodic Penrose tiling involves finding the dual graph of an arrangement of lines forming five parallel subsets. 

The maximum numbers of cells, edges, and vertices, for arrangements with a given number of lines, are quadratic functions of the number of lines. These maxima are attained by simple arrangements. The complexity of other features of arrangements have been studied in discrete geometry; these include zones, the cells touching a single line, and levels, the polygonal chains having a given number of lines passing below them. Roberts&#x27;s triangle theorem and the Kobon triangle problem concern the minimum and maximum number of triangular cells in a Euclidean arrangement, respectively.

Algorithms in computational geometry are known for constructing the features of an arrangement in time proportional to the number of features, and space linear in the number of lines. As well, researchers have studied efficient algorithms for constructing smaller portions of an arrangement, and for problems such as the shortest path problem on the vertices and edges of an arrangement.

==Definition==
As an informal thought experiment, consider cutting an infinite sheet of paper along finitely many lines. These cuts would partition the paper into convex polygons. Their edges would be one-dimensional line segments or rays, with vertices at the points where two cut lines cross. This can be formalized mathematically by classifying the points of the plane according to which side of each line they are on. Each line produces three possibilities per point: the point can be in one of the two open half-planes on either side of the line, or it can be on the line. Two points can be considered to be equivalent if they have the same classification with respect to all of the lines. This is an equivalence relation, whose equivalence classes are subsets of equivalent points. These subsets subdivide the plane into shapes of the following three types:
#The &quot;cells&quot; or &quot;chambers&quot; of the arrangement are two-dimensional regions not part of any line. They form the interiors of bounded convex polygons or unbounded convex regions. These are the connected components of the points that would remain after removing all points on lines.
#The &quot;edges&quot; or &quot;panels&quot; of the arrangement are one-dimensional regions belonging to a single line. They are the open line segments and open infinite rays into which each line is partitioned by its crossing points with the other lines. That is, if one of the lines is cut by all the other lines, these are the connected components of its uncut points.
#The &quot;vertices&quot; of the arrangement are isolated points belonging to two or more lines, where those lines cross each other.
The boundary of a cell is the system of edges that touch it, and the boundary of an edge is the set of vertices that touch it (one vertex for a ray and two for a line segment). The system of objects of all three types, linked by this boundary operator, form a cell complex covering the plane. Two arrangements are said to be &quot;isomorphic&quot; or &quot;combinatorially equivalent&quot; if there is a one-to-one boundary-preserving correspondence between the objects in their associated cell complexes.

The same classification of points, and the same shapes of equivalence classes, can be used for infinite but &quot;locally finite&quot; arrangements, defined as arrangements in which every bounded subset of the plane is crossed by finitely many lines. In this case the unbounded cells may have infinitely many sides.

==Complexity of arrangements==
It is straightforward to count the maximum numbers of vertices, edges, and cells in an arrangement, all of which are quadratic in the number of lines:
*An arrangement with formula_1 lines has at most formula_2 vertices (a triangular number), one per pair of crossing lines. This maximum is attained for &quot;simple arrangements&quot;, those in which each two lines cross at a vertex that is disjoint from all the other lines. The number of vertices is smaller when some lines are parallel, or when some vertices are crossed by more than two lines.
*An arrangement can be rotated, if necessary, to avoid axis-parallel lines. After this step, each ray that forms an edge of the arrangement extends either upward or downward from its endpoint; it cannot be horizontal. There are formula_1 downward rays, one per line, and these rays separate formula_4 cells of the arrangement that are unbounded in the downward direction. The remaining cells all have a unique bottommost vertex (again, because there are no axis-parallel lines). For each pair of lines, there can be only one cell where the two lines meet at the bottom vertex, so the number of downward-bounded cells is at most the number of pairs of Adding the unbounded and bounded cells, the total number of cells in an arrangement can be These are the numbers of the lazy caterer&#x27;s sequence.
*The number of edges of the arrangement is as may be seen either by using the Euler characteristic to calculate it from the numbers of vertices and cells, or by observing that each line is partitioned into at most formula_1 edges by the other formula_6 lines. Simple arrangements have exactly formula_7 edges.

More complex features go by the names of &quot;zones&quot;, &quot;levels&quot;, and &quot;many faces&quot;:

*The &quot;zone&quot; of a in a line arrangement is the collection of cells having edges belonging The zone theorem states that the total number of edges in the cells of a single zone is linear. More precisely, the total number of edges of the cells belonging to a single side of is and the total number of edges of the cells belonging to both sides is More generally, the total complexity of the cells of a line arrangement that are intersected by any convex curve where formula_8 denotes the inverse Ackermann function, as may be shown using Davenport–Schinzel sequences. The sum of squares of cell complexities in an arrangement as can be shown by summing the zones of all lines.
*The of an arrangement is the polygonal chain formed by the edges that have other lines directly below them. The is the portion of the arrangement below the Finding matching upper and lower bounds for the complexity of a remains a major open problem in discrete geometry. The best upper bound known while the best lower bound known In contrast, the maximum complexity of the is known to A is a special case of a monotone path in an arrangement; that is, a sequence of edges that intersects any vertical line in a single point. However, monotone paths may be much more complicated than there exist arrangements and monotone paths in these arrangements where the number of points at which the path changes direction 
*Although a single cell in an arrangement may be bounded by all formula_1 lines, it is not possible in general for formula_10 different cells to all be bounded by formula_1 lines. Rather, the total complexity of formula_10 cells is almost the same bound as occurs in the Szemerédi–Trotter theorem on point-line incidences in the plane. A simple proof of this follows from the crossing number inequality: if formula_10 cells have a total of formula_14 edges, one can form a graph with formula_10 nodes (one per cell) and formula_16 edges (one per pair of consecutive cells on the same line). The edges of this graph can be drawn as curves that do not cross within the cells corresponding to their endpoints, and then follow the lines of the arrangement. Therefore, there are formula_17 crossings in this drawing. However, by the crossing number inequality, there are formula_18 crossings. In order to satisfy both bounds, formula_16 must 

==Projective arrangements and projective duality==
It is convenient to study line arrangements in the projective plane as every pair of lines has a crossing point. Line arrangements cannot be defined using the sides of lines, because a line in the projective plane does not separate the plane into two distinct sides. One may still define the cells of an arrangement to be the connected components of the points not belonging to any line, the edges to be the connected components of sets of points belonging to a single line, and the vertices to be points where two or more lines cross. A line arrangement in the projective plane differs from its Euclidean counterpart in that the two Euclidean rays at either end of a line are replaced by a single edge in the projective plane that connects the leftmost and rightmost vertices on that line, and in that pairs of unbounded Euclidean cells are replaced in the projective plane by single cells that are crossed by the projective line at infinity.

Due to projective duality, many statements about the combinatorial properties of points in the plane may be more easily understood in an equivalent dual form about arrangements of lines. For instance, the Sylvester–Gallai theorem, stating that any non-collinear set of points in the plane has an &quot;ordinary line&quot; containing exactly two points, transforms under projective duality to the statement that any projective arrangement of finitely many lines with more than one vertex has an &quot;ordinary point&quot;, a vertex where only two lines cross. The earliest known proof of the Sylvester–Gallai theorem, by Eberhard Melchior in , uses the Euler characteristic to show that such a vertex must always exist.

==Triangles in arrangements==

An arrangement of lines in the projective plane is said to be &quot;simplicial&quot; if every cell of the arrangement is bounded by exactly three edges. Simplicial arrangements were first studied by Melchior. Three infinite families of simplicial line arrangements are known:
#A &quot;near-pencil&quot; consisting of formula_6 lines through a single point, together with a single additional line that does not go through the same point,
#The family of lines formed by the sides of a regular polygon together with its axes of symmetry, and
#The sides and axes of symmetry of an even regular polygon, together with the line at infinity.
Additionally there are many other examples of &quot;sporadic simplicial arrangements&quot; that do not fit into any known infinite family.
As Branko Grünbaum writes, simplicial arrangements &quot;appear as examples or counterexamples in many contexts of combinatorial geometry and its applications.&quot; For instance, simplicial arrangements form counterexamples to a conjecture on the relation between the degree of a set of differential equations and the number of invariant lines the equations may have. The two known counterexamples to the Dirac–Motzkin conjecture (which states that any arrangement has at least formula_21 ordinary points) are both simplicial.

The dual graph of a line arrangement has one node per cell and one edge linking any pair of cells that share an edge of the arrangement. These graphs are partial cubes, graphs in which the nodes can be labeled by bitvectors in such a way that the graph distance equals the Hamming distance between labels. In the case of a line arrangement, each coordinate of the labeling assigns 0 to nodes on one side of one of the lines and 1 to nodes on the other side. Dual graphs of simplicial arrangements have been used to construct infinite families of 3-regular partial cubes, isomorphic to the graphs of simple zonohedra.
It is also of interest to study the extremal numbers of triangular cells in arrangements that may not necessarily be simplicial. Any arrangement in the projective plane must have at least formula_1 triangles. Every arrangement that has only formula_1 triangles must be simple. For Euclidean rather than projective arrangements, the minimum number of triangles by Roberts&#x27;s triangle theorem. The maximum possible number of triangular faces in a simple arrangement is known to be upper bounded by formula_24 and lower bounded the lower bound is achieved by certain subsets of the diagonals of a regular For projective arrangements that are not required to be simple, there exist arrangements with formula_25 triangles for all formula_26, and all arrangements with formula_27 have at most formula_28 triangles. The closely related Kobon triangle problem asks for the maximum number of non-overlapping finite triangles in an arrangement in the Euclidean plane, not counting the unbounded faces that might form triangles in the projective plane. Again, the arrangements are not required to be simple. For some but not all values there exist arrangements with formula_29 triangles.

==Multigrids and rhombus tilings==
The dual graph of a simple line arrangement may be represented geometrically as a collection of rhombi, one per vertex of the arrangement, with sides perpendicular to the lines that meet at that vertex. These rhombi may be joined together to form a tiling of a convex polygon in the case of an arrangement of finitely many lines, or of the entire plane in the case of a locally finite arrangement with infinitely many lines. This construction is sometimes known as a Klee diagram, after a publication of Rudolf Klee in 1938 that used this technique. Not every rhombus tiling comes from lines in this way, however.

In , N. G. de Bruijn investigated special cases of this construction in which the line arrangement consists of formula_30 sets of equally spaced parallel lines. For two perpendicular families of parallel lines this construction gives the square tiling of the plane, and for three families of lines at 120-degree angles from each other (themselves forming a trihexagonal tiling) this produces the rhombille tiling. However, for more families of lines this construction produces aperiodic tilings. In particular, for five families of lines at equal angles to each other (or, as de Bruijn calls this arrangement, a &quot;pentagrid&quot;) it produces a family of tilings that include the rhombic version of the Penrose tilings.
There also exist three infinite simplicial arrangements formed from sets of parallel lines. The tetrakis square tiling is an infinite arrangement of lines forming a periodic tiling that resembles a multigrid with four parallel families, but in which two of the families are more widely spaced than the other two, and in which the arrangement is simplicial rather than simple. Its dual is the truncated square tiling. Similarly, the triangular tiling is an infinite simplicial line arrangement with three parallel families, which has as its dual the hexagonal tiling, and the bisected hexagonal tiling is an infinite simplicial line arrangement with six parallel families and two line spacings, dual to the great rhombitrihexagonal tiling. These three examples come from three affine reflection groups in the Euclidean plane, systems of symmetries based on reflection across each line in these arrangements.

==Algorithms==
Constructing an arrangement means, given as input a list of the lines in the arrangement, computing a representation of the vertices, edges, and cells of the arrangement together with the adjacencies between these objects. For instance, these features may be represented as a doubly connected edge list. Arrangements can be constructed efficiently by an incremental algorithm that adds one line at a time to the arrangement of the previously added lines. Each new line can be added in time proportional to the size of its zone, linear by the zone theorem. This results in a total construction time The memory requirements of this algorithm are also formula_17. It is possible instead to report the features of an arrangement without storing them all at once, in and by an algorithmic technique known as topological sweeping. Computing a line arrangement exactly requires a numerical precision several times greater than that of the input coordinates: if a line is specified by two points on it, the coordinates of the arrangement vertices may need four times as much precision as these input points. Therefore, computational geometers have also studied algorithms for constructing arrangements with limited numerical precision.

As well, researchers have studied efficient algorithms for constructing smaller portions of an arrangement, such as zones, or the set of cells containing a given set of points. The problem of finding the arrangement vertex with the median arises (in a dual form) in robust statistics as the problem of computing the Theil–Sen estimator of a set of points.

Marc van Kreveld suggested the algorithmic problem of computing shortest paths between vertices in a line arrangement, where the paths are restricted to follow the edges of the arrangement, more quickly than the quadratic time that it would take to apply a shortest path algorithm to the whole arrangement graph. An approximation algorithm is known, and the problem may be solved efficiently for lines that fall into a small number of parallel families (as is typical for urban street grids), but the general problem remains open.

==Non-Euclidean line arrangements==
A pseudoline arrangement is a family of curves that share similar topological properties with a line arrangement. These can be defined in the projective plane as simple closed curves any two of which meet in a single crossing point. A pseudoline arrangement is said to be &quot;stretchable&quot; if it is combinatorially equivalent to a line arrangement. Determining stretchability is a difficult computational task: it is complete for the existential theory of the reals to distinguish stretchable arrangements from non-stretchable ones. Every arrangement of finitely many pseudolines can be extended so that they become lines in a &quot;spread&quot;, a type of non-Euclidean incidence geometry in which every two points of a topological plane are connected by a unique line (as in the Euclidean plane) but in which other axioms of Euclidean geometry may not apply.

Another type of non-Euclidean geometry is the hyperbolic plane, and
arrangements of lines in this geometry have also been studied. Any finite set of lines in the Euclidean plane has a combinatorially equivalent arrangement in the hyperbolic plane (e.g. by enclosing the vertices of the arrangement by a large circle and interpreting the interior of the circle as a Klein model of the hyperbolic plane). However, parallel (non-crossing) pairs of lines are less restricted in hyperbolic line arrangements than in the Euclidean plane: in particular, the relation of being parallel is an equivalence relation for Euclidean lines but not for hyperbolic lines. The intersection graph of the lines in a hyperbolic arrangement can be an arbitrary circle graph. The corresponding concept to hyperbolic line arrangements for pseudolines is a &quot;weak pseudoline arrangement&quot;, a family of curves having the same topological properties as lines such that any two curves in the family either meet in a single crossing point or have no intersection.

==History==
In a survey on arrangements, Pankaj Agarwal and Micha Sharir attribute the study of arrangements to Jakob Steiner, writing that &quot;the first paper on this topic is perhaps&quot; an 1826 paper of Steiner. In this paper, Steiner proved bounds on the maximum number of features of different types that an arrangement may have. After Steiner, the study of arrangements turned to higher-dimensional arrangements of hyperplanes, focusing on their overall structure and on single cells in these arrangements. The study of arrangements of lines, and of more complex features such as zones within these arrangements, returned to interest beginning in the 1980s as part of the foundations of computational geometry.

<text>The Democratic Alternative &#x27;91 (, DA&#x27;91) is a liberal political party in Suriname.

==History==
The DA &#x27;91 was founded in 1991 when it split off from the National Party of Suriname. The party was founded shortly before the 1991 general election. The intention had been to establish the party in 1991 but the &quot;Telephone Coup&quot; that removed President Ramsewak Shankar from office interfered with the planning.

Winston Jessurun was one of the founders, together with Gerard Brunings. Brunings has stated that when establishing the party they asked the Dutch embassy for programs of Dutch political parties and that of Democrats 66 appealed most to them. With the most significant change being changing Netherlands for Suriname.

In the 1991 elections, the party obtained 9 seats. At the 1996 elections the number of seats dropped to four. It further dropped to two in the 2000 elections and one in the 2005 elections. Even though the party gained only one seat it was able to join the third cabinet of President Ronald Venetiaan and had one Minister in the cabinet and received an ambassadorship.

For the 2010 elections, the DA&#x27;91 joined the political alliance New Front for Democracy and Development that won 31.6% of the popular vote and 14 out of 51 seats in the National Assembly. Out of these 14, one seat went to DA&#x27;91. 

For the 2015 elections, DA&#x27;91 entered the elections as part of the political alliance V7. On 30 September 2015 Angelic Alihusain-del Castilho became chairperson of the party, succeeding Winston Jessurun.

<text>Troy Kennedy Martin (15 February 1932 – 15 September 2009) was a Scottish-born film and television screenwriter. He created the long-running BBC TV police series &quot;Z-Cars&quot; (1962–1978), and the award-winning 1985 anti-nuclear drama &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;. He also wrote the screenplay for the original version of &quot;The Italian Job&quot; (1969). His last film was &quot;Ferrari&quot; (2023), which was posthumously released.

==Biography==
===Early life===
He was born in Rothesay, Isle of Bute, and educated at Finchley Catholic Grammar School and Trinity College, Dublin. He had a younger brother Ian, who is also a television writer best known for creating &quot;The Sweeney&quot;.

===1960s===
He began writing for BBC Television in 1958, beginning with the play &quot;Incident at Echo Six&quot;, and he wrote four further plays for the BBC over the following three years, before in 1961 creating his first series, &quot;Storyboard&quot;, a six-part anthology series that consisted both of original scripts and adaptations. The same year, he wrote the police drama &quot;The Interrogator&quot;. He wrote an important manifesto about new television drama in 1964, calling for a more mobile style of camera work and less emphasis on dialogue.

In 1962, Martin co-created the drama series &quot;Z-Cars&quot;. Set in &quot;Newtown&quot;, based on Kirkby near Liverpool, &quot;Z-Cars&quot; was revolutionary in that it depicted a hard-edged, grittier and much more realistic vision of the police force than had been seen on British television – as a result, it was initially very unpopular with the real police. Although he left the programme after the first two series, the series ran until 1978, and he returned to write the final episode.

In 1965, Martin scripted a television adaptation of Frederik Pohl&#x27;s short story &quot;The Midas Plague&quot;, which was shown as an episode for the first series of &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot;, a science-fiction anthology series shown on BBC2. One of the more light-hearted stories of the otherwise dark and dramatic show, it is one of only 20 (and a half) episodes of the original 48 known to have survived destruction, and is available on DVD.

===1970s===
Over the following decade he contributed to various television programmes, and made his first foray into feature films when he wrote &quot;The Italian Job&quot;, which was released in 1969 and starred Noël Coward and Michael Caine. The following year he wrote &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, and he scripted two more films during the 1970s – &quot;The Jerusalem File&quot; (1971) and &quot;Sweeney 2&quot; (1978).

&quot;Sweeney 2&quot; was the second cinematic spin-off from the television series &quot;The Sweeney&quot;, which had been created by his brother Ian Kennedy Martin, and for which he had written several episodes. He is less well known for writing a little-seen television sitcom based in the British Civil Service, &quot;If It Moves, File It&quot; (1970), featuring amongst others John Bird, who later co-starred in the satirical &quot;Bremner, Bird and Fortune&quot;.

===1980s===
In the early 1980s he was no less successful, with two highly popular series on different networks in 1983. &quot;The Old Men at the Zoo&quot; was an adaptation of the novel by Angus Wilson and screened on BBC One; the second was the hugely popular &quot;Reilly, Ace of Spies&quot; on ITV, based on the book by Robin Bruce Lockhart and starring Sam Neill.

Greatly influenced by the political landscape of the early 1980s, he had drafted a script for a political thriller-cum-science fiction drama serial entitled &quot;Magnox&quot;, which became &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;. He was interviewed about the genesis of the series for &quot;Magnox: The Secrets of Edge of Darkness&quot; documentary, an extra on the show&#x27;s 2003 DVD release:

The concept attracted little interest from television executives until incoming BBC Head of Drama Series &amp; Serials Jonathan Powell picked it up in 1983, assigning experienced producer Michael Wearing to the project. &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; was eventually screened on BBC2 in late 1985. Although Kennedy Martin had many creative differences with director Martin Campbell and star Bob Peck (who is reported to have vetoed the scripted ending with the remark &quot;I&#x27;m not turning into a fucking tree!&quot;), the drama was a resounding success, picking up several awards and being remembered as one of the best British television drama productions of the 1980s. Following &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; he wrote another feature film screenplay, &quot;Red Heat&quot; (1988, co-written with director Walter Hill), which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Belushi.

===1990s===
Kennedy Martin did not return to television scriptwriting until the one-off BBC Two drama &quot;Hostile Waters&quot; in 1997. Other later work included &quot;Bravo Two Zero&quot; for BBC One in 1999, co-written with Andy McNab and starring Sean Bean.

===Death===
He died of lung cancer on 15 September 2009 aged 77, in Ditchling, East Sussex.

<doc id="864158" wikidata="Q585700" url="?curid=864158" title="Useful idiot">
<text>A useful idiot or useful fool is a pejorative description of a person, suggesting that the person thinks they are fighting for a cause without fully comprehending the consequences of their actions, and who does not realize they are being manipulated by the cause&#x27;s leaders or by other political players. The term was often used during the Cold War in the Western bloc to describe non-communists regarded as susceptible to communist propaganda and psychological manipulation. 

This statement has traditionally been attributed to Vladimir Lenin, but this attribution is not supported by any evidence. Similar terms exist in other languages, and the first mention in the English language predates Lenin&#x27;s birth.

== Early usages ==
The term &quot;useful idiot&quot;, for a foolish person whose views can be taken advantage of for political purposes, was used in a British periodical as early as 1864. In relation to the Cold War, the term appeared in a June 1948 &quot;New York Times&quot; article on contemporary Italian politics (&quot;Communist shift is seen in Europe&quot;), citing the Italian Democratic Socialist Party&#x27;s newspaper . &quot;L&#x27;Umanità&quot; argued that the Italian Socialist Party, which had entered into a popular front with the Italian Communist Party (PCI) known as the Popular Democratic Front during the 1948 Italian general election, would be given the option to either merge with the PCI or leave the alliance. The term was later used in a 1955 article in the &quot;American Federation of Labor News-Reporter&quot; to refer to Italians who supported Communist causes. &quot;Time&quot; first used the phrase in January 1958, writing that some members of Christian Democracy considered social activist Danilo Dolci a &quot;useful idiot&quot; for Communist causes. It has since recurred in that periodical&#x27;s articles, from the 1970s, to the 1980s, to the 2000s, and 2010s.

In the Russian language, the term &quot;useful fools&quot; (, tr. &quot;polezniye duraki&quot;) was already in use in 1941. It was mockingly used against Russian &quot;nihilists&quot; of the 1860s who, for Polish agents, were said to be no more than &quot;useful fools and silly enthusiasts.&quot;

While the phrase &quot;useful idiots of the West&quot; has often been attributed to Vladimir Lenin, he is not documented as ever having used the phrase. In a 1987 article for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, American journalist William Safire reported about his search for the origin of the term. He wrote that a senior reference librarian at the Library of Congress, Grant Harris, had been unable to find the phrase in Lenin&#x27;s works. Safire was also out of luck contacting TASS and the New York headquarters of the Communist Party. He concluded that, lacking solid evidence, a cautious phrasing must be used, e.g., &quot;a phrase attributed to Lenin...&quot;

== Select usage ==
In 1959, Congressman Ed Derwinski of Illinois entered an editorial by the &quot;Chicago Daily Calumet&quot; into the Congressional record, referring to Americans who travelled to the Soviet Union to promote peace as &quot;what Lenin calls useful idiots in the Communist game.&quot; In a speech in 1965, American diplomat Spruille Braden said the term was used by Joseph Stalin to refer to what Braden called &quot;countless innocent although well-intentioned sentimentalists or idealists&quot; who aided the Soviet agenda.

Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1987, Safire discussed the increasing use of the term &quot;useful idiot&quot; against &quot;anybody insufficiently anti-Communist in the view of the phrase&#x27;s user&quot;, including Congressmen who supported the anti-Contras led by the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and the Labour Party in the Netherlands. After United States president Ronald Reagan concluded negotiations with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev over the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, conservative political leader Howard Phillips declared Reagan a &quot;useful idiot for Soviet propaganda&quot;.

In the end of 2016, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the Editorial Board of &quot;The New York Times&quot; applied the term to President-elect Donald Trump.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_12/15/2016&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Morell, former acting CIA director, wrote: &quot;In the intelligence business, we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.&quot; Michael Hayden, former director of both the US National Security Agency and the CIA, described Trump as a &quot;useful fool, some naif, manipulated by Moscow, secretly held in contempt, but whose blind support is happily accepted and exploited.&quot;

&quot;The Economist&quot; published a 2023 article titled &quot;Vladimir Putin&#x27;s useful idiots&quot;; it describes &quot;useful Idiot narratives&quot; pushed by &quot;Putinversteher&quot; that support Putin&#x27;s aims and denigrate his perceived enemies.

== Variations of the term ==
The Serbo-Croatian term &quot; &quot;, which may be translated as &quot;useful idiots&quot; or &quot;useful innocents&quot;, attributed to unnamed Yugoslav communists, appears in a 1946 &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; article titled &quot;Yugoslavia&#x27;s Tragic Lesson to the World&quot;, written by Bogdan Raditsa. Raditsa had served the Yugoslav government-in-exile during World War II, supported Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s partisans but was not a communist himself, and briefly served in Tito&#x27;s led Provisional Government of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia before leaving for New York. Raditsa said: &quot;In the Serbo-Croat language, the communists have a phrase for true democrats who consent to collaborate with them for [the sake of] &#x27;democracy&#x27;. It is &quot;Korisne Budale&quot;, or Useful Innocents.&quot; 

In his 1947 book &quot;Planned Chaos&quot;, Austrian-American economist Ludwig von Mises wrote that the term &quot;useful innocents&quot; was used by communists for those whom von Mises describes as &quot;confused and misguided sympathizers [of the revolutionary idea]&quot;. 

The expression was discussed in connection with two other related quotations attributed to Lenin, which are also about Western &quot;idiots&quot; being manipulated by the Soviet communists. The quotations are known as &quot;the rope&quot; (&quot;The capitalists will sell us the rope with which to hang them&quot;) and the &quot;deaf, dumb and blind&quot;. For example, William J. Bennett alleged that &quot;&#x27;Useful idiot&#x27; was the term Lenin had used for credulous Western businessmen&quot;, giving as an example Armand Hammer &quot;who helped build up the Soviet Communist state&quot;. Bennett recounted a famous story wherein Lenin was asked, &quot;How will we hang the Capitalists, we don&#x27;t have enough rope!&quot; Lenin was reported to have &quot;famously replied&quot; with the rejoinder, &quot;They will sell it to us — on credit.&quot; 

The wording from written works by Lenin about the &quot;rope&quot; was as follows

and the &quot;dumb and blind&quot; version of the quotation (from handwritten notes by Lenin) was the following:

<text>Jakob Aljaž (July 6, 1845 – May 4, 1927) was a Slovene Roman Catholic priest, composer and mountaineer.

Aljaž was born in a small Upper Carniolan village of Zavrh pod Šmarno Goro, northeast of Ljubljana, in what was then the Austrian Empire. He was a priest and also a successful composer, singer and choir master. His works are still very popular among Slovenes. He became known for his role fostering the development of mountaineering in the Slovene Lands. By far his most well known construction is the Aljaž Tower (), built on the summit of Mount Triglav, the highest mountain of the Julian Alps and of Slovenia, which he purchased to secure the area for Slovene rather than German mountaineers. He also designed shelters and huts, and worked with the Slovene Mountaineering Society to improve use of the land on Triglav.

The endeavours of Jakob Aljaž had a very influential role in the emergence of Mount Triglav as one of the central symbols of the Slovene people. The first verse from the patriotic poem &quot;Oh, Triglav, My Home&quot; () by Matija Zemljič, put into music by Jakob Aljaž, is engraved in the Slovenian 50 cent euro coin. Since 2007, its first stance has been the anthem of the Alpine Association of Slovenia.

Jakob Aljaž died in the village of Dovje in Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.

<text>Lydie Polfer (born 22 November 1952) is a Luxembourgish politician of the Democratic Party who has served as Mayor of Luxembourg City since 2013, having previously held the role from 1982 to 1999. She has served in a number of other capacities, including as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, as well as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and a member of the Chamber of Deputies.

== Political career ==
Polfer succeeded her father, Camille Polfer, as mayor of Luxembourg City, when he was forced to resign from the position due to poor health after only two years. She was first elected to the Chamber of Deputies in the 1984 election, representing Centre. She was the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs in the government of Jean-Claude Juncker from August 1999 until July 2004.

In the 2004 legislative election, Polfer was elected, once again, top of the DP list, coming second overall to Luc Frieden. However, the DP polled poorly overall, losing five seats nationwide, and, with them, their position as the second-largest party and kingmakers. As such, the CSV entered instead into a coalition with the Luxembourg Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (LSAP), ejecting Polfer from the government. The European Parliament election held on the same day also saw the DP lose votes, as well as fall to fourth, behind the Greens for the first time. Nonetheless, Polfer still came top of the DP list (and third overall), and took her place in the European Parliament, where the DP sit in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.

She is now once again Mayor of Luxembourg City, after previously being mayor there from 1982 to 1999. Polfer is a Vice Chair of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.

In 2023 elections Polfer finished 3rd on the DP list, with 19,345 votes.

<doc id="864164" wikidata="Q1810004" url="?curid=864164" title="Election law">
<text>Election law is a branch of public law that relates to the democratic processes, election of representatives and office holders, and referendums, through the regulation of the electoral system, voting rights, ballot access, election management bodies, election campaign, the division of the territory into electoral zones, the procedures for the registration of voters and candidacies, its financing and propaganda, voting, counting of votes, scrutiny, electoral disputes, electoral observation and all contentious matters derived from them. It is a discipline falling at the juncture of constitutional law and political science, and involves &quot;the politics of law and the law of politics&quot;.

== History and the field ==
After the legally-contested 2000 United States presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore, the importance of election law has grown in the United States. According to the National Law Journal, election law &quot;grew from a niche to multi million-dollar draw.&quot; The UCLA election law professor Richard Hasen showed that in the United States, litigation rates have been soaring for two decades and hit record high during the 2020 election.

Since the early 2000s, election law has been taught at most of the law schools throughout the United States. American election law experts and academics are connected in the academic network founded by Daniel H. Lowenstein, professor at UCLA Law School, and Richard L. Hasen. Lowenstein is considered the &quot;pioneer&quot; and the one who &quot;invented&quot; the election law. In 2000s, Lowenstein and Hasen edited the Election Law Journal and the election law mailinglist. As of 2022, Hasen manages the Election Law Blog and the mailing list. The Election Law Journal is an academic publication devoted to election law, currently edited by David Canon of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Most of its articles deal with election law in the United States.

According to the Routledge Handbook of Election Law, election law is a growing area globally. Voters around the world are increasingly challenging election results. Austria, Switzerland, Slovenia, Iceland, Kenya, and Malawi are some countries where courts have recently invalidated national elections or referendums. Electoral disputes are good for democracy, according to the book&#x27;s editors. They can &quot;remove voters&#x27; doubts, remedy violations, increase trust, and, when needed, invalidate flawed elections and defend the integrity of the electoral process. Letting all participants know violations will not be tolerated benefits future elections.&quot;

== Issues ==
Some of the questions that are addressed by election law are:
* Which people are entitled to vote in an election (e.g. age, residency or literacy requirements, or poll taxes), and the procedures by which such persons must register to vote or present identification in order to vote
* Which people are entitled to hold office (for example, age, residency, birth or citizenship requirements), and the procedures candidates must follow to appear on the ballot (such as the formatting and filing of nominating petitions) and rules governing write-in candidates
* The rules about what subjects may be submitted to a direct popular vote through a referendum or plebiscite, and the rules that governmental agencies or citizen groups must follow to place questions on the ballot for public consideration
* The framework by which political parties may organize their internal government, and how they select candidates to run for political office (e.g. primary elections)
* The financing of elections (e.g. contribution limits, rules for public financing of elections, the public disclosure of contributors, and rules governing interest groups other than a candidate&#x27;s campaign organization)
* The requirements for creating districts which elect representatives to a legislative assembly (examples include congressional districts, ridings or wards within a Municipality)
* What restrictions are placed on campaign advocacy (such as rules on anonymous adds, false advertising, and limits on free speech)
* How votes are cast at an election (including whether to use a paper ballot, or some other form of recording votes such as a mechanical voting machine or electronic voting device, and how information is presented to voters on the ballot or device)
* How votes are counted at an election, recounts, and election challenges
* Whether, and how, voters or candidates may file legal actions in a court of law or administrative agency to enforce their rights or contest the outcome of an election
* Definition of electoral fraud and other crimes against the electoral system
* The sources of election law (for example, constitutions, national statutes, state statutes, or judicial decisions) and the interplay between these sources of law

== Sources of election law ==
== Regimes in comparative law ==

=== France ===

The French electoral code addresses most of the elections. However, other texts frame this material for special elections. Thus the Constitution but fixed some general basic provisions concerning the presidential election, the legislative and senatorial elections.

For litigation election, the court depends on the concerned election. The Constitutional Council is responsible for the most important elections: presidential elections and senatorial elections or referendums. In contrast, to the municipal or district elections the administrative tribunal has jurisdiction, then the appeal is to the State Council. Finally, for the regional and European elections, the Council of State which has jurisdiction at first and last resort.

In decisions on electoral matters, the law takes into account the results: if an essential principle is violated, the election is canceled but if fraud is &quot;classic&quot; (ballot stuffing, failure to register as voters, vote the dead ...) but the election was won (after counting of ballots invalidated) with a large or very large lead, the judge then cancels rarely the result.

=== Italy ===
The Italian Constitution fixes some general basic provisions concerning the legislative elections.
Electoral disputes in Italy are complex because they are divided between several court orders. For example, with regard to the dispute concerning registration of candidates for ballots or litigation election, the administrative court has jurisdiction. For eligibility and disfranchisement, the judge is the ordinary tribunal.

If a fraud is proven by the judge, it does not cancel necessarily the elections, unless they think that the result of election without the fraud would not have been identical. The survival of the acts already performed by the elected organs would seem solved by abundant case law that protects innocent trust of third parties.

===Mexico===

Elections in Mexico are held every 6 years to elect a president and every 3 years to elect a legislature. These elections determine who, on the national level, takes the position of the head of state – the president – as well as the legislature. At the local level, each of Mexico&#x27;s 31 constituent states elects a governor to serve a six-year term; they also elect legislative deputies who sit in state congresses, and municipal presidents &quot;(presidentes municipales,&quot; or mayors). Mexico City, the national capital, elects a head of government in lieu of a mayor, city assemblymen in lieu of state congressional deputies, and borough mayors in lieu of municipal mayors.

===Philippines===

The president, vice-president, and the senators are elected for a six-year term, while the members of the House of Representatives, governors, vice-governors, members of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan (provincial board members), mayors, vice-mayors, members of the Sangguniang Panlungsod/members of the Sangguniang Bayan (city/municipal councilors), barangay officials, and the members of the Sangguniang Kabataan (youth councilors) are elected to serve for a three-year term.

Synchronized with the national elections are the local elections. The voter may vote for any of the following:
*Provincial-level: One governor, one vice governor, one to seven Sangguniang Panlalawigan members (provincial board)
*City- or municipal-level: one mayor, one vice mayor, four to twelve Sangguniang Panlungsod/Sangguniang Bayan members (city or municipal council, respectively)
If the city the voter is residing in a highly urbanized city, or independent component city. or in Pateros, the voter can not vote for any of the provincial-level positions.

=== Republic of the Congo ===
=== United States ===

Elections in the United States are held for government officials at the federal, state, and local levels. At the federal level, the nation&#x27;s head of state, the president, is elected indirectly by the people of each state, through an Electoral College. Today, these electors almost always vote with the popular vote of their state. All members of the federal legislature, the Congress, are directly elected by the people of each state. There are many elected offices at state level, each state having at least an elective governor and legislature. There are also elected offices at the local level, in counties, cities, towns, townships, boroughs, and villages; as well as for special districts and school districts which may transcend county and municipal boundaries.

The legal case Pitts v. Black in 1984 established the definition of &quot;“residence”&quot; under the Election Law was excessively strict to the point of disenfranchising homeless voters. The Court concluded a specific location where the people returns regularly and a place designated to receive mail should satisfy the &quot;“residence”&quot; requirements. As a result, homeless people were allowed to cast their ballots. 

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, election law is legislated for by The Houses of Parliament. The statutory governance of UK Election law comes from acts of parliament such as the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011. The Electoral Commission&#x27;s mandate and establishment was set out in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA), and ranges from the regulation of political donations and expenditure by political and third parties through to promoting greater participation in the electoral process.

The Electoral Administration Act 2006 made a number of improvements to electoral registration, improving the security arrangements for absent voting, allowing observers to attend elections and a major change in reducing the minimum age for candidates at UK parliamentary elections. It also introduced the performance standards regime for electoral services.

== Notable authors ==
According to University of Chicago Law Professor Brian Leiter, the most cited American election law scholars between 2016 and 2020 included Samuel Issacharoff, Richard Pildes, Richard Hasen, Heather Gerken, Richard Briffault, Nathaniel Persily, and Nicholas Stephanopoulos, respectively. Other notable election law experts and professors include David Schultz, Joshua Douglas, Ed Foley, Guy-Uriel Charles, Jessica Levinson, Rebecca Green, Eugene Mazo, Justin Levitt, in the U.S, Graeme Orr in Australia and Jurij Toplak in Europe.

<text>Mains electricity by country includes a list of countries and territories, with the plugs, voltages and frequencies they commonly use for providing electrical power to low voltage appliances, equipment, and lighting typically found in homes and offices. (For industrial machinery, see industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets.) Some countries have more than one voltage available. For example, in North America, a unique split-phase system is used to supply to most premises that works by center tapping a 240 volt transformer. This system is able to concurrently provide 240 volts and 120 volts. Consequently, this allows homeowners to wire up both 240 V and 120 V circuits as they wish (as regulated by local building codes). Most sockets are connected to 120 V for the use of small appliances and electronic devices, while larger appliances such as dryers, electric ovens, ranges and EV chargers use dedicated 240 V sockets. Different sockets are mandated for different voltage or maximum current levels.

Voltage, frequency, and plug type vary, but large regions may use common standards. Physical compatibility of receptacles may not ensure compatibility of voltage, frequency, or connection to earth (ground), including plugs and cords. In some areas, older standards may still exist. Foreign enclaves, extraterritorial government installations, or buildings frequented by tourists may support plugs not otherwise used in a country, for the convenience of travellers.

== Main reference sourceIEC World Plugs ==
The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) publishes a web microsite &quot;World Plugs&quot; which provides the main source for this page, except where other sources are indicated. &quot;World Plugs&quot; includes some history, a description of plug types, and a list of countries giving the type(s) used and the mains voltage and frequency.
Although useful for quick reference, especially for travellers, &quot;IEC World Plugs&quot; may not be regarded as totally accurate, as illustrated by the examples in the plugs section below, and errors may exist.

== Voltages ==
Voltages in this article are the nominal single-phase supply voltages, or split-phase supply voltages. Three-phase and industrial loads may have other voltages.

All voltages are root mean square (RMS) voltage; the peak AC voltage is greater by a factor of formula_1, and the peak-to-peak voltage greater by a factor of formula_2
== Plugs ==


The system of plug types using a single letter (from A to O) used here is from &quot;World Plugs&quot;, which defines the plug type letters in terms of a general description, without making reference to specific standards. Where a plug does not have a specific letter code assigned to it, then it may be defined by the style sheet number listed in IEC TR 60083.

<doc id="864169" wikidata="Q1071848" url="?curid=864169" title="Horse-chestnut leaf miner">
<text>The horse-chestnut leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella) is a leaf-mining moth of the family Gracillariidae. The horse-chestnut leaf miner was first observed in North Macedonia in 1984, and was described as a new species in 1986. Its larvae are leaf miners on the common horse-chestnut (&quot;Aesculus hippocastanum&quot;). The horse-chestnut leafminer was first collected and inadvertently pressed in herbarium sheets by the botanist Theodor von Heldreich in central Greece in 1879.

==Damage==
&quot;Cameraria ohridella&quot; causes significant damage, mainly late summer browning, to the appearance of horse-chestnut trees. Despite the poor appearance of these infested trees, there is no evidence that damage by the moth leads to tree death. Seed weight, photosynthetic storage and reproductive capacity may however be reduced. Trees survive repeated infestations and re-flush normally in the following year. It appears that most of the damage caused by the moth occurs too late in the growing season to greatly affect tree performance. Consequently, there is no reason to fell and remove trees just because they are attacked by &quot;C. ohridella&quot;.

The larva feeds in a mine in the leaves of the tree, damaging the leaves and stunting growth. Infected leaves are covered in small brown patches which spread rapidly across the entire tree, giving an autumnal appearance. Eventually the leaves die and drop off; when new ones grow they are again infected. This cycle can repeat itself several times in one season.

==Description==
The moth is up to long, with shiny, bright brown forewings with thin, silvery white stripes. The hindwings are dark grey with long fringes. Each female moth lays between 20 and 40 eggs singly on the upper surface of leaves, and once these hatch 2–3 weeks later, the larvae develop through five feeding phases (or instars) and two prepupal (spinning) phases before the pupal phase. The first stage creates a small cavity (or mine) parallel to a vein in the leaf and is &quot;sap-sipping&quot; rather than &quot;tissue-feeding&quot;. By the third instar, the larva creates a mine approximately 8mm in diameter; this is further expanded by later instars until one mine can cover several square centimeters. The larva starts to pupate around four weeks after the egg hatches and, except when hibernating as a pupa in the mine, the adult emerges around two weeks later. In severe infestations, the mines of individuals can merge and almost the entire leaf area may be utilised. When this occurs it may lead to high moth mortality as the larvae compete for space and food. The moth is able to go through up to five generations each year, if the weather is hot and dry; on average in western Europe, the moth goes through three generations each year. The last generation of the year pupates for over six months so as to survive the winter. The pupae are extremely frost tolerant and have been recorded to survive temperatures as low as . This allows its populations to increase even after hard winters.

The dead patches that the horse-chestnut leaf miner causes on leaves are similar to damage caused to horse-chestnut trees by the fungus &quot;Guignardia&quot; &quot;aesculi&quot;, but can be distinguished by the fungal infection often being outlined by a conspicuous yellow band which the mines lack. The pupae can be mistaken for pupae of the genus &quot;Phyllonorycter&quot; but can be distinguished because &quot;C. ohridella&quot; pupae do not have a cremaster and the first five abdominal sections have strong lateral spines on them.

==Distribution and dispersal==

&quot;Cameraria ohridella&quot; has now been found in Albania, Austria, Belgium, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, England and Wales, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Kosovo, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Moldova, Montenegro, the Netherlands, North Macedonia, Poland, Serbia, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine. Although horse-chestnut occurs naturally mostly above the contours the moth does well in well-watered places such as parks in cities and at low elevation but not well in the hotter parts of Europe e.g. Spain. Probably aided greatly by vehicular transport, the moth has attained a very rapid dispersal rate across Europe of per year.

==Origin and epidemiology==
&quot;Cameraria ohridella&quot; was first noticed from outbreaks near Ohrid Lake, Yugoslavia in 1984, and was described as a new species by Deschka and Dimić in 1986. A likely Balkan origin for this moth was evidenced from a decrease in genetic diversity from natural towards artificial horse-chestnut stands that were planted around Europe since around 1600. This Balkan origin is further documented by numerous herbarium samples that date back to 1879. These include an outbreak which occurred in horse-chestnut specimens collected by F.K. Meyer in 1961 in Albania. Of the 30 known mitochondrial haplotypes for the species only three (known as A, B and C) have invaded the rest of Europe since 1989, and only A is dominant. It is likely that the frequency of haplotype A has been increasing even in Balkan natural sites, aided by the late development of roads in the region.

==Host plants==
As well as colonising the leaves of the common horse-chestnut, &quot;C. ohridella&quot; is also able to feed on &quot;Aesculus pavia&quot;, &quot;Acer platanoides&quot; and &quot;Acer pseudoplatanus&quot;, on which in particular one mitochondrial race, haplotype B, seems to develop successfully when nearby horse-chestnut leaves are exhausted, but is not thought to pose such a strong risk to these species unlike to the common horse-chestnut.

==Control==

===Parasitoids===
Over 60 generalist parasitoids have been recorded. However, for biological control a highly specialist parasitoid still needs to be found.

===Predators===
A number of natural predators of the larval stages of &quot;C. ohridella&quot; have been recorded. Observations have shown that blue tits (&quot;Cyanistes caeruleus&quot;), great tits (&quot;Parus major&quot;) and marsh tits (&quot;Poecile palustris&quot;) feed on the larvae. Between them, three tit species are thought to prey on between 2 and 4% of the larvae. The southern oak bushcricket (&quot;Meconema meridionale&quot;) has also been found to prey on &quot;C. ohridella&quot;, consuming around 10 larvae per day. Overall the predation by the southern oak bushcricket is insignificant compared to that by birds however. Experiments with the predatory mite &quot;Euseius finlandicus&quot;, bush crickets (&quot;Phaneroptera&quot; sp.), ladybirds and lacewings found that none prey on &quot;C. ohridella&quot;.

===Procedures===
Inadvisably, trees can be removed, or better, leaves cleared and burned before adult emergence by the end of March. Use of the systemic insecticide imidacloprid is usually banned as it kills bees. Fenoxycarb causes up to 100% pupal mortality, has low environmental toxicity and can be combined successfully with manual leaf removal. A synthetic pheromone can be used to trap males, but effective control may be hard to thus achieve. In any case, infestation levels could diminish over time as &quot;Cameraria ohridella&quot; starts to recruit generalist members of the local parasitoid wasp community.

===Projects===
A number of projects have been launched to investigate the biology and biological control of &quot;Cameraria ohridella&quot; and its impact since 2001, for example, an EU-wide multidisciplinary project, CONTROCAM (&quot;Control of &quot;Cameraria&quot;&quot;) and the HAM-CAM Project.

<text>Robin Sachs (5 February 1951 – 1 February 2013) was an English actor, active in the theatre, television and films. He was also known for his voice-over work in films and video games.

Born to a theatrical family, Sachs studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, and made a theatrical and screen career, working his way up from supporting parts in the 1970s to leading roles from the 1980s. He made his later career in the United States, and became known for his role of Ethan Rayne in the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;.

==Early life and early career==
Sachs was born in London, the elder of two sons of the South African-born actor Leonard Sachs and the English actress Eleanor Summerfield. His father was Jewish. After leaving school he studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, after which he followed the traditional route of provincial repertory and touring before being cast in supporting roles in West End productions during the 1970s, including Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV&quot;, with Rex Harrison; &quot;Pericles&quot;, with Derek Jacobi, and Pinero&#x27;s &quot;The Gay Lord Quex&quot;, with Judi Dench, directed by John Gielgud.

==Career==
He appeared in leading stage roles, in Leicester in 1979 in Sartre&#x27;s &quot;The Assassin&quot;, Brighton in 1984 in &quot;Love Affair&quot; with Siân Phillips, and at the Ashcroft Theatre, Croydon in 1985 in &quot;On Approval&quot; with Polly James and Christopher Biggins, On British television, he was cast in &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;; &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;; &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot;; &quot;Quiller&quot; and &quot;Gentlemen and Players&quot;. In the 1983 series &quot;Chessgame&quot; he played the secret agent Hugh Roskill.

Sachs&#x27;s first film role was as Heinrich, a young vampire, in Hammer&#x27;s &quot;Vampire Circus&quot; (1972). He played Thomas Culpepper, Catherine Howard&#x27;s lover in &quot;Henry VIII and his Six Wives&quot; (1973), and featured in &quot;The Disappearance&quot; (1977) alongside Donald Sutherland.

In the early 1990s, Sachs moved to Los Angeles after being cast as a guest star in the television series &quot;Jake and the Fatman&quot; and played Adam Carrington in the miniseries &quot;&quot;. He remained based in the US, guest starring in television shows including &quot;The Return of Ironside&quot; with Raymond Burr (1993). Among his later films were Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; (1997) and Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s remake of &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; (2001). He appeared in several science-fiction programmes on television, including &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; and &quot;Torchwood&quot;, and in 1999 played General Sarris in the satirical comedy &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot;, co-starring Tim Allen and Sigourney Weaver. In 2002, he was cast as Peter Brazier, head of Nexexcon in &quot;Megalodon&quot;. In his last film appearance, &quot;Northfork&quot; (2002), he played Cup of Tea, the leader of the vestigial community of a town about to be flooded.

Sachs became known for his role as the sorcerer Ethan Rayne in the American television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, and for voicing Zaeed Massani in the &quot;Mass Effect&quot; video game franchise, Admiral Saul Karath in &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot;, Sergeant Roderick in &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; and Xoloti in &quot;Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom&quot;. In recognition of his popularity as a voice artist, following his death, a &quot;Mass Effect 3&quot; multiplayer challenge was enacted during the last weekend of February 2013, called &quot;Operation Tribute&quot;.

==Personal life==
Sachs was twice married: from 1979 to 1991 to Siân Phillips, and from 1995 to 2006 to the American actress Casey DeFranco. Both marriages were dissolved. He died of a heart attack on 1 February 2013.

<text>Le Tombeau de Couperin (&quot;The Tomb of Couperin&quot;) is a suite for solo piano by Maurice Ravel, composed between 1914 and 1917. The piece is in six movements, based on those of a traditional Baroque suite. Each movement is dedicated to the memory of a friend of the composer (or in one case, two brothers) who had died fighting in World War I. Ravel also produced an orchestral version of the work in 1919, although this omitted two of the original movements.

==Overview==
The word &quot;tombeau&quot; in the title is a musical term popular from the 17th century, meaning &quot;a piece written as a memorial&quot;. The specific Couperin, among a family noted as musicians for about two centuries, that Ravel intended to evoke is thought to be François Couperin &quot;the Great&quot; (1668–1733). Ravel stated that his intention was to pay homage more generally to the sensibilities of the Baroque French keyboard suite, not necessarily to imitate or pay tribute to Couperin himself in particular. This is reflected in the piece&#x27;s structure, which imitates a Baroque dance suite.

As a preparatory exercise, Ravel had transcribed a &quot;forlane&quot; (an Italian folk dance) from the fourth suite of Couperin&#x27;s &quot;Concerts royaux&quot;, and this piece invokes Ravel&#x27;s Forlane structurally. The other movements are similarly based on Baroque forms, with the Toccata taking the form of a &quot;perpetuum mobile&quot; reminiscent of Alessandro Scarlatti. Ravel also revives Baroque practices through his distinctive use of ornamentation and modal harmony. Neoclassicism also shines through with Ravel&#x27;s pointedly twentieth-century chromatic melody and piquant harmonies, particularly in the dissonant Forlane.

Written after the death of Ravel&#x27;s mother in 1917 and of friends in the First World War, &quot;Le Tombeau de Couperin&quot; is a light-hearted, and sometimes reflective work rather than a sombre one which Ravel explained in response to criticism saying, &quot;The dead are sad enough, in their eternal silence&quot;.

The first performance of the original piano version was given on 11 April 1919 by Marguerite Long, in the Salle Gaveau in Paris. Long was the widow of Joseph de Marliave, to whom the last movement of the piece, the Toccata, is dedicated.

==Composition==
The movements are as follows:
==Orchestrations and transcriptions==

In 1919 Ravel orchestrated four movements of the work (Prélude, Forlane, Menuet and Rigaudon); this version was premiered in February 1920 by Rhené-Baton and the Pasdeloup Orchestra, and has remained one of his more popular works. The orchestral version clarifies the harmonic language of the suite and brings sharpness to its classical dance rhythms. The oboe features prominently, taking the melody in the Prélude and the Menuet, as well as for the pastoral C minor section of the Rigaudon, where it is accompanied by guitar-like pizzicati.

The orchestrated version is scored for two flutes (one doubling piccolo), two oboes (one doubling cor anglais), two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, trumpet, harp, and strings.
Four movements (Prélude, Fugue, Menuet, and Rigaudon) have been arranged for wind quintet by American horn player Mason Jones (1919–2009). Danish composer Hans Abrahamsen has also transcribed four movements for wind quintet, and further, American composer Gunther Schuller has made a wind-quintet arrangement.

<text>Dovje (; ) is a village in the Municipality of Kranjska Gora in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia, located on the southern slopes of the Karawanks at an elevation of 703 m. It has a rich history and rural tradition and is known as one of the sunniest villages in Slovenia. Its location is ideal for farming, and this has been the main occupation of its inhabitants for many centuries.

==Name==
Dovje was attested in historical sources in 1029 as &quot;Lenginvuélt&quot;, in 1065 as &quot;Lenginvelt&quot;, and in 1318 as &quot;Langenuelt&quot;. The Slovene name is based on a translation of the German name (literally, &#x27;long field&#x27;), presumably through dialect development from *&quot;dolgē (polje)&quot; &#x27;long field&#x27;, referring to the configuration of the village&#x27;s territory.

==Cultural heritage==
The village has preserved a number of elements typical of alpine architecture. The most interesting of these are the arched front doors of the old houses. The view toward the Julian Alps from the village has made the cemetery next to St. Michael&#x27;s Church an appropriate final resting place for many hikers that lost their lives on Mount Triglav and the surrounding mountains.

==Notable people==
Notable people that were born or lived in Dovje include:
*Jakob Aljaž (1847–1927), poet, composer, and mountain enthusiast
*Franjo Jeglič (1856–1935), beekeeper

<doc id="864180" wikidata="Q4676210" url="?curid=864180" title="Adaptive Multi-Rate audio codec">
<text>The Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR, AMR-NB or GSM-AMR) audio codec is an audio compression format optimized for speech coding. AMR is a multi-rate narrowband speech codec that encodes narrowband (200–3400 Hz) signals at variable bit rates ranging from 4.75 to 12.2 kbit/s with toll quality speech starting at 7.4 kbit/s.

AMR was adopted as the standard speech codec by 3GPP in October 1999 and is now widely used in GSM and UMTS. It uses link adaptation to select from one of eight different bit rates based on link conditions.

AMR is also a file format for storing spoken audio using the AMR codec. Many modern mobile telephone handsets can store short audio recordings in the AMR format, and both free and proprietary programs exist (see Software support) to convert between this and other formats, although AMR is a speech format and is unlikely to give ideal results for other audio. The common filename extension is codice_1. There also exists another storage format for AMR that is suitable for applications with more advanced demands on the storage format, like random access or synchronization with video. This format is the 3GPP-specified 3GP container format based on ISO base media file format.

== Usage ==
The frames contain 160 samples and are 20 milliseconds long. AMR uses various techniques, such as ACELP, DTX, VAD and CNG. The usage of AMR requires optimized link adaptation that selects the best codec mode to meet the local radio channel and capacity requirements. If the radio conditions are bad, source coding is reduced and channel coding is increased. This improves the quality and robustness of the network connection while sacrificing some voice clarity. In the particular case of AMR this improvement is somewhere around S/N = 4–6 dB for usable communication. The new intelligent system allows the network operator to prioritize capacity or quality per base station.

There are a total of 14 modes of the AMR codec, eight are available in a full rate channel (FR) and six on a half rate channel (HR).

== Features ==
* Sampling frequency 8 kHz/13-bit (160 samples for 20 ms frames), filtered to 200–3400 Hz.
* The AMR codec uses eight source codecs with bit-rates of 12.2, 10.2, 7.95, 7.40, 6.70, 5.90, 5.15 and 4.75 kbit/s.
* Generates frame length of 95, 103, 118, 134, 148, 159, 204, or 244 bits for AMR FR bit rates 4.75, 5.15, 5.90, 6.70, 7.40, 7.95, 10.2, or 12.2 kbit/s, respectively. AMR HR frame lengths are different.
* AMR utilizes discontinuous transmission (DTX), with voice activity detection (VAD) and comfort noise generation (CNG) to reduce bandwidth usage during silence periods
* Algorithmic delay is 20 ms per frame. For bit-rates of 12.2, there is no &quot;algorithm&quot; look-ahead delay. For other rates, look-ahead delay is 5 ms. Note that there is 5 ms &quot;dummy&quot; look-ahead delay, to allow seamless frame-wise mode switching with the rest of rates.
* AMR is a hybrid speech coder, and as such transmits both speech parameters and a waveform signal
** Linear predictive coding (LPC) is used to synthesize the speech from a residual waveform. The LPC parameters are encoded as line spectral pairs (LSP).
** The residual waveform is coded using algebraic code-excited linear prediction (ACELP).

<doc id="864183" wikidata="Q603448" url="?curid=864183" title="Indecent Proposal">
<text>Indecent Proposal is a 1993 American erotic drama film directed by Adrian Lyne and written by Amy Holden Jones. It is based on the 1988 novel by Jack Engelhard, in which a couple&#x27;s marriage is disrupted by a stranger&#x27;s offer of a million dollars for the wife to spend the night with him. It stars Robert Redford, Demi Moore, and Woody Harrelson.

The film received a mostly negative response from critics for the contrivances and implausibilities of its story. It also sparked controversy, with feminists arguing the film&#x27;s premise promotes prostitution and the treatment of women as property. Despite this, the film was a box office success and grossed nearly $267 million worldwide on a $38 million budget, becoming the sixth highest-grossing film of 1993.

==Plot==
David and Diana Murphy are married high school sweethearts living in California. Diana is working as a real estate agent, while David hopes to establish himself as an architect by designing their dream home. The couple invest everything they have in David&#x27;s project, purchasing beachfront property in Santa Monica, California and beginning construction, but the recession leaves Diana without houses to sell and David without a job. In desperate need of $50,000 to save their land from being repossessed, they travel to Las Vegas to gamble with the last of their savings.

At a casino, Diana catches the eye of high roller John Gage, while David wins over $25,000 at craps. Reveling in their winnings, Diana assures David that she loves him regardless of the money. The next day, they lose everything at roulette; leaving the casino, they notice a crowd gathered to watch Gage play baccarat. Gage asks Diana to join him for good luck, and she makes a winning craps roll on his $1 million bet. As thanks, Gage insists on paying for the Murphys&#x27; stay, giving them a lavish hotel suite and a dress he saw Diana admire. After an enjoyable evening together, Gage offers the couple $1 million to allow him to spend a night with Diana, with David flatly refusing.

Later, Diana convinces David to agree to Gage&#x27;s proposal. David contacts his lawyer, who prepares a contract for the arrangement. Leaving Diana with Gage, David has a change of heart and races to stop them but arrives just as they depart by helicopter. Gage flies Diana to his private yacht and offers her a chance to void their deal and return to her husband if he loses a toss of his lucky coin. He wins the toss, and Diana spends the night with him.

Agreeing to forget the incident, the Murphys return home to discover that the bank had already foreclosed on and sold their land. Overcome with anger and jealousy, David accuses Diana of continuing to see Gage after finding his business card in her wallet, which she denies knowing about. Discovering that it was Gage who bought out their land, Diana angrily confronts him and rejects his attempts to pursue her. When she informs David, their tension reaches a breaking point, and they separate; Diana allows David to keep the $1 million.

Weeks later, Gage visits Diana at work and renews his advances. Initially resistant, she eventually consents to spending time with him, and a romance develops between them. David, meanwhile, turns to alcohol and eventually hits rock bottom, leading to a public confrontation with Gage and Diana. He pulls his life back together and finds a teaching position, and Diana files for divorce. Finding her at a zoo benefit with Gage, David donates the entire $1 million in a charity auction bid, then makes his peace with Diana and signs their divorce papers.

Realizing that Diana will never love him the way she loves David, Gage lies to her that she is merely the latest member of his &quot;million-dollar club&quot; of women. Seeing through his deception, she gratefully ends their relationship; before parting ways, he gives her his lucky coin, which she realizes is double headed. Diana returns to the pier where David proposed to her seven years earlier, finding him there. Repeating their unique declaration of love, they join hands.

==Production==
===Development===
Paramount Pictures bought the rights to Jack Engelhard&#x27;s 1988 novel &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot; for $120,000. Adrian Lyne signed on to direct, reuniting with producer Sherry Lansing, with whom he had worked on &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;. Lyne had a falling out with past collaborator Stanley Jaffe, who wanted the film to be released by Christmas season of 1992 and thus allotted for limited post-production time.

The film was originally planned as a vehicle for Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, with Warren Beatty as John Gage. Kidman and Isabelle Adjani screen tested for the role of Diana. Cruise backed out amidst speculation that the film&#x27;s morals conflicted with his new involvement in the Church of Scientology. Robert Redford accepted the part of Gage on the condition that his character be adjusted to be less of a villain. He turned down the $4 million salary initially offered to him in exchange for gross profit participation from the film&#x27;s box office.

Johnny Depp, Tim Robbins, and William Baldwin were among the actors considered for the role of David Murphy. Woody Harrelson dropped out of the film &quot;Benny &amp; Joon&quot; to commit to the role, resulting in a lawsuit from MGM-Pathe Entertainment that was settled out of court.

===Writing===
Of the script, screenwriter Amy Holden Jones said there were multiple third-act changes to the script, made primarily by men. Jones initially wrote the ending with Diana leaving Gage of her own accord, without prompting from Gage.

Jones said: &quot;I always had a lot of trouble with the movie after [David and Diana] split up. The men in charge, and particularly Redford, decided to make [Gage] very sympathetic. In the original script, it was a clear journey where she came to realize that she was his next acquisition. There were four or five people that Redford cycled through to work on his character. In my draft, what she said to him was that you can’t buy love, and then she left him. He had that changed, because Robert Redford couldn’t be left.&quot;

Jones added: &quot;I thought [Diana] should leave both men at the end. I brought it up several times [in studio meetings], including once the movie was greenlit. And that was basically laughed at. No one would consider it, really.&quot;

William Goldman says he was brought in to work on the script after John Cusack had turned it down. &quot;They couldn’t get anyone to do it,&quot; he said. &quot;I wrote a draft and I don’t think they changed anything. I don’t know why the actors decided to do it or didn’t do it, but it was an enormous success so that’s good for me.&quot;

===Filming===
Filming began in Las Vegas in June 1992. The casino scenes were filmed at the Westgate Las Vegas. After a month in Las Vegas, the production moved to southern California, where locations included the Echo Park neighborhood and a Santa Barbara mansion that stood in for Gage’s home.

Lyne decided to feature the novel &quot;&quot; in a scene because author Susan Faludi had notably criticized Lyne’s film &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;.

Lyne completed post-production work on the film roughly two weeks before its opening in April 1993.

===Differences between novel and film===
Engelhard&#x27;s novel contained cultural friction that the screenwriter left out of the movie: the main character, named Joshua, is Jewish, and his billionaire foil is Arab. In a review of the novel, &quot;The New York Times&quot; summarized its themes as &quot;the sanctity of marriage versus the love of money, the Jew versus significant non-Jews such as shiksas and sheiks, skill versus luck, materialism versus spirituality, Israel versus the Arab countries, the past versus the future, and the religious world versus the secular one.&quot;

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Indecent Proposal&quot; was a box office success, grossing $106,614,059 in the US and Canada and $159,985,941 internationally for a worldwide total of $266,600,000.

The film opened on 1,694 screens in the United States and Canada on April 7, 1993, and grossed $18,387,632 in its opening weekend to top the US box office, the biggest opening at the time for an April release. It was number one for four weeks and became the sixth highest-grossing film of 1993. Some journalists attributed the audience turnout to Paramount’s strong marketing campaign, as well as the film&#x27;s sensational premise that made for heated debates.

It entered international release on April 23, 1993, previewing on 66 screens in Australia for the weekend. Despite only playing for three days, it topped the Australian box office for the week with a three-day gross of $0.8 million (A$1.16 million). It officially opened in Australia on April 29 and remained at number one for four more weeks. In the UK, it also benefited from previews in topping the UK box office with an opening weekend gross of $2.4 million (£1.5 million) including previews. It remained number one in the UK for three weeks. In Italy, it was Paramount/United International Pictures&#x27; second biggest ever opening with an opening weekend gross of $1.6 million.

===Critical response===
The film received negative reviews from critics, who cited the contrivances of the film&#x27;s script and its underdeveloped characters. Critics noted that the film was the latest of a string of movies that involved women being treated as property, such as &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;, &quot;Honeymoon in Vegas&quot;, and &quot;Mad Dog and Glory&quot;. A major criticism was that the film did not fully explore its potentially enticing premise. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;For all its ostensible daring, &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot; is much too cautious. None of the three principals really change as a consequence of the story. None of the frankness that might make matters interesting is allowed to sully the romantic mood. None of the characters have lives outside the confines of the story, although the lonely Gage, when celebrating a big gambling win, suddenly gives a party for 200 anonymous, soigne-looking friends.&quot;

In &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, Anthony Brett said that despite its packaging as a steamy thriller, &quot;&quot;Indecent Proposal&quot; is in fact a largely distasteful and bizarrely plodding romantic drama, one that gently pokes at lofty ideas about power and marriage and the American dream but scurries away before it hits on anything too dicey.&quot; In &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Owen Gleiberman wrote: &quot;&quot;Indecent Proposal&quot; starts out kinky and turns into a languid — and shockingly banal — domestic soap opera. Like &quot;9 1/2 Weeks&quot;, the movie is all tease, all come-on. Next time Lyne should try for something a little more indecent.&quot;

Critics generally praised Redford&#x27;s performance, but some lamented that the character of John Gage was given too much of a sympathetic edge, and that the role was merely a chance for Redford to once again play Jay Gatsby. Gleiberman wrote: &quot;Like Michael Douglas&#x27; Gordon Gekko, he has that aura of money that’s almost tactile — even in his dark suit, he glows — and he speaks with the dry enticement of someone who has had too much of what he wants and now gets his kicks by testing people, living through their experiences.&quot;

Of Moore, Maslin wrote, she &quot;pours all of her effort into going through such motions smolderingly, and none into whatever sense may lie behind them. That&#x27;s fine for the role; she falters only when the screenplay turns mute or turns up howlers.&quot; Todd McCarthy wrote: &quot;What emotional legitimacy the film does possess stems from Moore&#x27;s performance, which is lively, heartfelt and believable until the script ceases to permit it.&quot; Several critics found Harrelson to be the weak link of the cast, with McCarthy writing the actor is not given much to do except display &quot;puppydog love in the first section and standard-issue jealousy in the second&quot;. However, multiple critics were complimentary of the film&#x27;s supporting cast, particularly Oliver Platt as the Murphys&#x27; wisecracking, sleazy lawyer.

Multiple critics opined that the film loses its narrative steam after the climactic deal takes place. In a 2014 review, Nathan Rabin wrote: &quot;&quot;Indecent Proposal&quot; suffers from a distinct lack of stakes. The second [Diana returns from her night with Gage], the million dollars that just moments ago was going to change her and her husband&#x27;s lives ceases to matter. Diana doesn’t want it. David doesn’t want it...Money ultimately doesn’t matter in the sleazy fairy-tale world of &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot;, only love, and when money threatens to soil that love, then it must be openly rejected.&quot;

The film also sparked significant backlash from feminists and critics for its depiction of a woman bartering with her body for the benefit of her husband. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the film &quot;sexist propaganda.&quot; Activist Betty Friedan and filmmaker Callie Khouri argued the film promotes the idea of prostitution, with Friedan saying, &quot;What does it say? Thirteen-year-old girls will see that movie and be told you don’t need to bother to do your homework or to get an MBA, all you need to do is diet enough to be anorexic, get some silicone and look for that lonely billionaire.&quot; Feminist writer Susan Faludi likened Gage&#x27;s actions in the film to &quot;essentially...raping a woman with money.&quot; Producer Denise Di Novi suggested the film could be characterized as a women in prison film, because it has a woman in a &quot;submissive, controlled situation.&quot; Camille Paglia dissented, saying &quot;What is it about this picture that moviegoers are in sync with? (Is it) women’s sexuality in ways feminist rhetoric is unable to define?&quot;

Amy Holden Jones wrote a defense of the film in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, arguing that Diana had agency in her choice and that much of the criticism levied against the film came from male critics. Jones later said: &quot;When the film was released, it caused a great deal of controversy, because, you know, how could I write this thing about a woman spending the night with this guy for a million dollars? The idea that a woman should not be tempted by any of those things, or she should be so pure that you can’t make a movie about her feeling that way — I mean, go watch some French cinema! It&#x27;s more complicated than that. I’m as big a feminist as you’ll find, but part of feminism for me is that women can be portrayed not as visions of perfection on-screen, but as whole human beings with choices.&quot;

Among the few critics to review the film positively was Roger Ebert. Ebert gave the film a thumbs up on &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot;, while his colleague Gene Siskel gave it a thumbs down. In his print review, Ebert admitted there &quot;are large challenges to logic&quot; and the plot is &quot;manipulative&quot;, but said &quot;there is a genuine romantic spirit at work here&quot;, concluding that a necessary suspension of disbelief is &quot;why we line up at the ticket window: We want to leave the real world, for a couple of hours, anyway&quot;. He also described the film&#x27;s decision to keep the actual night of adultery offscreen as wise.

Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; also gave a positive review, writing that while &quot;Honeymoon in Vegas&quot; and &quot;Mad Dog and Glory&quot; &quot;dance around the issue of buying and bartering people, &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot; embraces it. It isn&#x27;t aways a good film; it employs lazy voice-overs to express sappy sentiments about the Murphys&#x27; eternal love. But it turns an inflammatory plot into a surprisingly honest and entertaining movie.&quot; Her colleague Janet Maslin gave a similarly mixed response, saying the film &quot;calls for grudging admiration. Working with a ridiculous premise and...[a] badly underwritten script...the director of &quot;Flashdance&quot; and &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; has still come up with the sort of sexy pop parable that is his specialty. Mr. Lyne&#x27;s films may not cast any new light on the human condition, but they do keep you glued to the screen.&quot;

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot; has a 34% &quot;rotten&quot; rating based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 4.8/10. The consensus reads: &quot;Lurid but acted with gusto, &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot; has difficulty keeping it up beyond its initial titillating premise.&quot; Audience response was less negative, with those polled by CinemaScore giving an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale. The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;The Official Razzie Movie Guide&quot; as one of the &quot;100 most enjoyably worst movies ever made&quot;.

===Awards and nominations===
==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack was released on April 6, 1993, by MCA Records. &quot;In All the Right Places&quot; by Lisa Stansfield was released as the album&#x27;s lead single on May 24, 1993, and is the film&#x27;s theme song. Sheena Easton makes a cameo appearance in the movie performing &quot;The Nearness of You&quot; at a pivotal part of the movie. The length of the soundtrack is 60 minutes and 37 seconds. &quot;No Ordinary Love&quot; by English band Sade was also prominently featured in the film, though it was not included on its soundtrack album.

In 2015, Intrada Records released an album of John Barry&#x27;s score.

== Remake ==
On July 30, 2018, Paramount Players announced that a remake of the film was in development, with the screenplay being written by Erin Cressida Wilson.

== In popular culture ==
The animation series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&#x27;s 2002 episode &quot;Half-Decent Proposal&quot; parodies the movie&#x27;s premise.

In the television series &quot;Mad About You&quot; episode, &quot;A Pair of Hearts&quot;, during the end credits, the married couple Paul and Jamie Buchman are approached by a man who offers a million dollars to sleep with Jamie. They immediately reply &quot;Sure!&quot;, and, after a quick smooch, Jamie leaves with the man (to the laughter of the audience).

The TV series &quot;Impractical Jokers&quot; featured a punishment inspired by &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot; in the Season 7 episode of the same name where Sal Vulcano is forced to ask couples while working as a dance instructor&#x27;s assistant if they would be willing to meet him in a more passionate setting in exchange for money.

<text>Carmine Gerard DeSapio (December 10, 1908 – July 27, 2004) was an American politician from New York City. He was the last head of the Tammany Hall political machine to dominate municipal politics.

==Early life and career==
DeSapio was born in lower Manhattan. His father was an Italian immigrant from Campania (Monteforte Irpino), while his mother was a second generation Italian American. DeSapio&#x27;s father operated a trucking business. DeSapio graduated from Fordham University in 1931.

He started his career in the Tammany Hall organization as an errand boy and messenger for precinct captains. DeSapio earned a reputation during his deliveries of coal and turkey on behalf of the local Tammany club by thanking recipients for their acceptance of Tammany handouts. Tammany Hall had dominated New York City politics from the mayoral victory of Fernando Wood in 1854 until the election of Fiorello H. La Guardia in 1933. DeSapio was first elected a district captain in 1939, but was rejected by the leadership in the struggle between Irish and Italian interests for control of the organization. In 1943 he was accepted as district leader for lower Greenwich Village.

==Tammany Hall boss==
In 1949, DeSapio became the youngest &quot;boss&quot; in the history of Tammany Hall, succeeding Hugo Rogers.

DeSapio&#x27;s Italian heritage signaled the end of Tammany&#x27;s longtime dominance by Irish-American politicians, and he became the first nationally prominent Italian-American political leader.

Unlike many previous Tammany Hall bosses, DeSapio always made his decisions known to the public and promoted himself as a reformer. As boss of Tammany, he demonstrated liberal credentials when he diversified Tammany&#x27;s leadership by naming the first Puerto Rican Manhattan district leader, Anthony Mandez, and backed Hulan Jack as Manhattan&#x27;s first African-American Borough President. His ties with Frank Costello also failed to halt his rise to power in the local political scene. DeSapio reformed Tammany Hall&#x27;s traditional sale of judgeships early in his role as Boss, reducing the cost of a position of a judge from $75,000 to $25,000. This money was used to offset the cost of campaign expenses.

===Public image===
DeSapio always seemed a personally modest man. Even though he operated out of four lavish offices, he lived for fifty years in a middle-class apartment on Washington Square with his wife Theresa Natale (&quot;Natalie&quot;) and daughter Geraldine. As leader of Tammany Hall, DeSapio reveled in the limelight, attending charitable fund-raising events, making himself available to the press, and delivering speeches in highbrow venues that were thought off-limits to political bosses. In wielding his enormous political clout, he usually preferred extensive consultations and consensus-building to unilateral decision-making. His 16- to-18-hour workday began with pre-breakfast phone calls at home where, still dressed in pajamas and bathrobe, he received a stream of political associates. DeSapio would then visit his various offices for further meetings, and cram in a half-dozen public functions, including radio and television appearances and a late-night political dinner.

DeSapio succeeded in shucking Tammany&#x27;s notoriety and fashioning himself as a sophisticated, enlightened and modern political boss. He favored well-tailored dark suits and striped ties and always looked as if he had just stepped out of a barber&#x27;s chair. The only incongruity was the dark glasses he was forced to always wear because of chronic iritis.

===Involvement with organized crime===
Throughout his political life, DeSapio was noted for alleged involvement with organized crime, even though he fought to distance the organization from the unsavory days of Boss Tweed, and allegations of corruption. In 1951, Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee concluded that DeSapio was assisting the activities of New York&#x27;s most powerful mobster Frank Costello, and that Costello had become influential in decisions made by the Tammany Hall council. DeSapio admitted to having met Costello several times, but insisted that &quot;politics was never discussed&quot;. These connections were examined by the Kefauver Commission.

However, it later became apparent that he was also selling out to benefit local mobsters such as Costello. DeSapio was accused of staffing New York City&#x27;s government with clubhouse hacks. He steered valuable city contracts for streetlights and parking meters to the Broadway Maintenance Corporation, a company that, according to the State Investigation Commission, cheated taxpayers out of millions of dollars.

===1953 mayoral election===
In 1953, he earned new respect and public admiration when he turned against the other Democratic leaders in New York City and used the power of Tammany Hall to help ensure that the highly-unpopular incumbent mayor, Vincent R. Impellitteri, was defeated in the Democratic Party primary by Robert F. Wagner Jr., an outspoken pro-reform Democrat, and then helped assure Wagner&#x27;s victory in the general election. Following Wagner&#x27;s success, DeSapio became a powerful and well-respected kingmaker in the New York political scene.

===1958 U.S. Senate race===
In 1958, DeSapio&#x27;s image was severely damaged after he successfully manoeuvred to have his own candidate for Senate, Manhattan District Attorney Frank Hogan, placed on the Democratic and Liberal ticket. New Yorkers now saw DeSapio as an old-time Tammany Hall boss and Hogan lost the Senate election to Republican Kenneth Keating. Republican Nelson Rockefeller was elected Governor the same year as well. Democrats who had once praised DeSapio now found it expedient to excoriate him. In 1961, Wagner won re-election by running a reformist campaign that denounced his former patron, DeSapio, as an undemocratic practitioner of Tammany machine politics. The same year, DeSapio lost the district leadership of his native Greenwich Village, a post he had held for two decades, to an upstart reform Democrat, James Lanigan, who was backed by nationally known liberal Democrats such as Wagner, Eleanor Roosevelt and former Senator Herbert H. Lehman.

===Ouster===
His leadership ended in 1961, and with it the dynasty that was Tammany Hall. It took several years of work by Eleanor Roosevelt to bring this about. She told local journalist Murray Kempton, who published her remarks many years later in 1991 when he was a columnist for &quot;Newsday&quot;, &quot;I told Carmine I would get him for what he did to Franklin, and get him I did.&quot; She had vowed revenge because she felt DeSapio had derailed her son&#x27;s (Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr.) political ambitions by persuading him to abandon his run for Governor of New York in 1954 and instead run for New York Attorney General. After Roosevelt dropped out, DeSapio then got the local Democratic Party officials to accept former banker and diplomat W. Averell Harriman as the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee for governor in the New York state election. Harriman barely managed to secure victory as Governor of New York and Roosevelt lost his bid to become the New York Attorney General. Following Harriman&#x27;s victory, DeSapio served in Harriman&#x27;s cabinet as Secretary of State of New York.

==Later career==
In 1963 and 1965, after Lanigan stepped down, DeSapio tried to retake his position as Greenwich Village district leader, but was twice defeated by another reform candidate, Edward I. Koch, who became mayor in 1977. DeSapio reached a low point in 1969 when he was convicted in a federal court of conspiracy and bribery after it was acknowledged that he conspired to bribe the New York City water commissioner, James L. Marcus, and extort contracts from Consolidated Edison that would result in kickbacks. He served two years in federal prison (1971–1973). After his release, he never re-entered politics, although he supported many community, charitable, and civic causes. He regained some of his former popularity through his skill as a speaker. In 1992, former Mayor Ed Koch, his opponent in 1963 and 1965, whom DeSapio had later befriended and met with on occasions, said of him, &quot;He is a crook, but I like him ... Most politicians still like DeSapio. He always gets the most applause when he is introduced at Democratic dinners&quot;.

Among DeSapio&#x27;s accomplishments were support of the Fair Employment Practices Law, the New York City rent control laws, and the lowering of the voting age to 18.

==Death==
DeSapio died at age 95 on July 27, 2004, at St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital in Manhattan. He was interred in a private mausoleum at Calvary Cemetery in Woodside, Queens. He was survived by his daughter Geraldine A. DeSapio.

<text>Philip Burton Moon FRS (17 May 1907 – 9 October 1994) was a British nuclear physicist. He is most remembered for his research work in atomic physics and nuclear physics. He is one of the British scientists who participated in the United States&#x27; Manhattan Project, Britain&#x27;s Tube Alloys, and was involved in nuclear weapon development. Moon made outstanding and original experimental contributions which stimulated the development of whole fields of research involving neutrons, gamma rays and novel methods of studying chemical reactions (&#x27;Mechanically propelled molecular beams: techniques and opportunities&#x27;, Moon, P.B. Ralls, M.P., Proceedings of the Royal Society A, 423, 361 371, 1989).

==Early life and education==
Philip Burton Moon was born in 1907, attended Leyton Sixth Form College, and in 1925 entered Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. He became a research student in the Cavendish Laboratory under Ernest Rutherford. From 1928 to 1931 he worked with Mark Oliphant on the collision of atoms with solids. Rutherford called him &quot;Oliphant&#x27;s satellite&quot; and that influence remained with him for decades.

===Cavendish Laboratory===
He worked at Cavendish Laboratory in the mid-1930s, where he shared a room with Australian physicist Mark Oliphant. Both later joined the University of Birmingham; Moon in 1938.

==Tube Alloys and Manhattan Project==
During World War II Moon was part of the MAUD Committee that confirmed the feasibility of an atomic bomb and then became part of the British delegation to the Manhattan Project, where amongst other things he did work on designing instrumentation for measuring the eventual bomb test.

His wife, Winifred Moon, was a staff worker at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project.

==Career at Birmingham University==
After the war he was made Poynting Professor of Physics at Birmingham in 1946, succeeding Oliphant but receiving the appointment only after the first choice (Cecil Powell) had been rejected at the last minute for being a communist. He held the position until 1973.

In 1950 Moon was the first person to detect gamma ray fluorescence; however his results were not considered statistically significant enough and it would be several years before they were proven.

Moon was invited to become the honorary life president of the Poynting Physical Society, at the University of Birmingham, in 1975.

In 1991, Moon was the recipient of the Hughes Medal from the Royal Society.

His papers are held at the University of Birmingham Special Collections.

<doc id="864202" wikidata="Q417997" url="?curid=864202" title="Ezetimibe">
<text>Ezetimibe, sold under the brand name Zetia among others, is a medication used to treat high blood cholesterol and certain other lipid abnormalities. Generally it is used together with dietary changes and a statin. Alone, it is less preferred than a statin. It is taken by mouth. It is also available in the fixed-dose combinations ezetimibe/simvastatin, ezetimibe/atorvastatin, ezetimibe/rosuvastatin, and ezetimibe/bempedoic acid.
The most commonly reported adverse events include upper respiratory tract infections, joint pain, diarrhea, and tiredness. Serious side effects may include anaphylaxis, liver problems, depression, and muscle breakdown. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is of unclear safety. Ezetimibe works by decreasing cholesterol absorption in the intestines.
Ezetimibe was approved for medical use in the United States in 2002. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 79th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Adding ezetimibe to statin treatment of high blood cholesterol has no effect on overall mortality or cardiovascular mortality, although it significantly reduces the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. Combining ezetimibe with simvastatin had no effect on overall mortality but did lower the risk of heart attack or stroke in people with prior heart attack. Several treatment guidelines recommend adding ezetimibe in select high risk persons in whom LDL goals cannot be achieved by maximally tolerated statin alone.

Initiation of ezetimibe along with high-intensity statin therapy at the time of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event was associated with significantly better cholesterol reduction at day 7, 1-month, 3-months, and 1-year post-ACS event; which translated into significantly lower recurrent cardiovascular events (death from any cause, major ACS, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke) post the index event of ACS. 

Ezetimibe is indicated in the United States as an add-on to dietary measures to reduce levels of certain lipids in people with:
*Primary hyperlipidemia, alone or with a statin
*Mixed hyperlipidemia, in combination with fenofibrate
*Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, in combination with specific statins
*Homozygous sitosterolemia

A 2018 review found that ezetimibe used as sole treatment slightly lowered plasma levels of lipoprotein(a), but the effect was not large enough to be important.

Ezetimibe improves the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score but the available evidence indicates it does not improve outcomes of hepatic steatosis.

==Contraindications==
The two contraindications to taking ezetimibe are a previous allergic reaction to it, including symptoms of rash, angioedema, anaphylaxis, and severe liver disease, especially when taken with a statin.

Ezetimibe may have significant medication interactions with ciclosporin and with fibrates other than fenofibrate.

==Adverse effects==
Common adverse drug reactions (≥1% of patients) associated with ezetimibe therapy include headache and/or diarrhea (steatorrhea). Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of patients) include myalgia and/or raised liver function test (ALT/AST) results. Rarely (&lt;0.1% of patients), hypersensitivity reactions (rash, angioedema) or myopathy may occur. Cases of muscle problems (myalgia and rhabdomyolysis) have been reported and are included as warnings on the label for ezetimibe.

Since NPC1L1 also regulates vitamin K uptake, the use of ezetimibe can lead to side effects in warfarin therapy.

==Overdose==
The incidence of overdose with ezetimibe is rare; subsequently, few data exist on the effects of overdose. However, an acute overdose of ezetimibe is expected to produce an exaggeration of its usual effects, leading to loose stools, abdominal pain, and fatigue.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Ezetimibe inhibits the absorption of cholesterol from the small intestine and decreases the amount of cholesterol normally available to liver cells. The lower levels of cholesterol in the liver cells lead them to absorb more cholesterol from circulation thus lowering the levels of circulating cholesterol. It blocks the critical mediator of cholesterol absorption, the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) protein on the gastrointestinal tract epithelial cells, as well as in hepatocytes; it blocks aminopeptidase N and interrupts a caveolin 1–annexin A2 complex involved in trafficking cholesterol.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Within 4–12 hours of the oral administration of a 10-mg dose to fasting adults, the attained mean ezetimibe peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 3.4–5.5 ng/ml. Following oral administration, ezetimibe is absorbed and extensively conjugated to a phenolic glucuronide (active metabolite). Mean Cmax (45–71 ng/ml) of ezetimibe-glucuronide is attained within 1–2 hours. The concomitant administration of food (high-fat vs. nonfat meals) does not affect the extent of absorption of ezetimibe. However, coadministration with a high-fat meal increases its Cmax by 38%. The absolute bioavailability cannot be determined, since ezetimibe is insoluble in aqueous media suitable for injection. Ezetimibe and its active metabolites are highly bound to human plasma proteins (90%).

Ezetimibe is primarily metabolized in the liver and the small intestine via glucuronide conjugation with subsequent renal and biliary excretion. Both the parent compound and its active metabolite are eliminated from plasma with a half-life of around 22 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing. Ezetimibe lacks significant inhibitor or inducer effects on cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, which explains its limited number of drug interactions. No dose adjustment is needed in patients with chronic kidney disease or mild hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh score 5–6). Due to insufficient data, the manufacturer does not recommend ezetimibe for patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7–15). In patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment, the mean AUC values for total ezetimibe are increased about 1.7-fold, 3-to-4-fold, and 5-to-6-fold, respectively, compared to healthy subjects.

<text>Benjamin Spooner Briggs (April 24, 1835 – likely November 1872) was an experienced American seaman and master mariner. He was the captain of the merchant ship &quot;Mary Celeste,&quot; which was discovered unmanned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean midway between the Azores and the coast of Portugal on December 4, 1872. The lifeboat was missing, yet the &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; was still under sail. Briggs, his wife Sarah and their two-year-old daughter Sophia Matilda were never found and were presumed lost, along with the crew of &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;.

==Maritime career==
The Briggs family of Massachusetts had a long maritime connection, and Benjamin Briggs himself spent most of his life at sea. He was an experienced, hardy, and able seaman. He reportedly was respected by those who served under him because of his fairness and ability. He worked his way to eventually become a master mariner. Briggs captained the brigantine &quot;Sea Foam&quot;, and in 1862 became master of the three-masted schooner &quot;Forest King&quot;. When he took command of the bark &quot;Arthur&quot; in 1865, he turned over command of the &quot;Forest King&quot; to his brother, Oliver Briggs. Oliver Briggs was a frequent business partner and sailor with his brother.

==Family==
Briggs was devoutly religious and a believer in abstinence. In 1862, he married Sarah Elizabeth Cobb, daughter of the reverend Leander Cobb. The newlyweds sailed to Europe in Briggs&#x27; schooner &quot;Forest King&quot;. Their son Arthur S. Briggs was born in 1865 at the family home at Rose Cottage, Marion, Massachusetts. The following year, the family travelled to Marseilles, France, returning in time for the birth of their daughter Sophia Matilda on October 31, 1870.

==&quot;Mary Celeste&quot;==

In 1871 Briggs and his brother considered purchasing a hardware store in New Bedford. However, in 1872, he purchased a share in the brigantine &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;, owned by James Winchester, and modified the cabin to house his family. In late 1872, his wife and daughter accompanied him on the ill-fated voyage from Staten Island, New York to Genoa, Italy. Briggs&#x27; son Arthur stayed with his grandmother at Rose Cottage in Marion, Massachusetts in order to attend school.

The following month, Briggs&#x27; ship was found abandoned in the Atlantic Ocean near the Straits of Gibraltar. Briggs, his wife, his daughter and the crew of the &quot;Mary Celeste&quot; were never found and their fate remains a mystery.

==Legacy==
A cenotaph memorializing the family stands in the Evergreen Cemetery in Marion, Massachusetts. The inscription reads: &quot;Capt. Benj S. Briggs born Apr 24, 1835, Sarah E Cobb his wife born Apr 20 1841, Sophia M, their daughter, born Oct 31, 1870. Lost in Brig Mary Celeste Nov 1872&quot;.

Briggs is the main protagonist in the game &quot;Limbo of the Lost&quot;, in which he is caught within a battle between Destiny and Fate. In the game, Briggs is heavily fictionalized, with no mention of his wife, child or the crew of &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;.

<doc id="864217" wikidata="Q2546045" url="?curid=864217" title="The Care Bears Movie">
<text>The Care Bears Movie is a 1985 animated musical fantasy film directed by Arna Selznick from a screenplay by Peter Sauder. It was the second feature film from the Canadian animation studio Nelvana after the 1983 film &quot;Rock &amp; Rule,&quot; in addition to being one of the first films based directly on a toy line and the first based on Care Bears. It introduced the Care Bears characters and their companions, the Care Bear Cousins. The voice cast includes Mickey Rooney, Georgia Engel, Jackie Burroughs and Cree Summer. In the film, an orphanage owner (Mickey Rooney) tells a story about the Care Bears, who live in a cloud-filled land called Care-a-Lot. While traveling across Earth, the Bears help two lonely children named Kim and Jason, who lost their parents in a car accident, and also save Nicholas, a young magician&#x27;s apprentice, from an evil spirit&#x27;s influence. Deep within a place called the Forest of Feelings, Kim, Jason and their friends soon meet another group of creatures known as the &quot;Care Bear Cousins&quot;.

American Greetings, the owners of the &quot;Care Bears&quot; characters, began development of a feature film adaptation in 1981. Later on, the card company chose Nelvana to produce it and granted them rights to the characters, in addition to financing the film along with cereal manufacturer General Mills and television syndicator LBS Communications. Nelvana&#x27;s founders were producers, with fellow employee Arna Selznick directing the film. Production lasted eight months, with a production budget of at least $2 million, and took place in Canada, Taiwan, and South Korea. Carole King and John Sebastian contributed several songs for the film. Though major American film studios passed on the project, newly established independent distributor The Samuel Goldwyn Company acquired the distribution rights to the film and soon spent a record $24 million promoting it.

&quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; premiered on March 24, 1985, in Washington, D.C, and was released in North America on March 29, 1985; another Nelvana film, &quot;Strawberry Shortcake Meets the Berrykins&quot;, was released alongside it. It received mixed reviews from critics, who raised concern over its potential as a full-length advertisement for the title characters, among other aspects. It went on to earn $23 million domestically, making it the highest-grossing Canadian film during 1985 (with C$1.845 million), in addition to winning a Golden Reel Award. With over $34 million in worldwide sales, it set a box-office record for Canadian and non-Disney animation and has remained one of Goldwyn&#x27;s largest-earning releases. The film&#x27;s success, which saved Nelvana from closing, helped revive films aimed at children in the US market. It has since been cited as inspiring a spate of toy-based animated and live-action features; the film was later followed by two sequels, &quot;A New Generation&quot; (1986) and &quot;Adventure in Wonderland&quot; (1987), neither surpassing the original financially or critically.

==Plot==

The Cherrywoods are a middle-aged couple who run an orphanage. Mr. Cherrywood tells the orphans a story about the Care Bears and Care-a-Lot, their home in the clouds. In the story, Friend Bear and Secret Bear travel looking for people to cheer up. They meet Kim and Jason, two lonely orphaned children, who lost their parents in a car accident. Friend Bear and Secret Bear introduce themselves and remind the children of their ambitions, but neither of them are interested.

At an amusement park, Tenderheart Bear spots a magician&#x27;s apprentice named Nicholas. While unloading a trunk of goods for his master, the &quot;Great Fetuccini&quot;, Nicholas finds an old book with a diary-style lock. When he unlocks it, an evil spirit appears as a woman&#x27;s face and starts corrupting him. With his help, it lays waste to the park and begins a quest to remove all caring from the world.

Back at Care-a-Lot, some of the other bears are working on their new invention: the Rainbow Rescue Beam, a portal that can send any bear to Earth and back. The two Care Bear cubs belonging to Grams Bear, Baby Hugs and Baby Tugs, interfere with it and bring forth a group of unexpected visitors: Friend Bear, Secret Bear, Kim, and Jason. The bears introduce themselves to the children, and give them a tour of their home. Tenderheart Bear returns on his now out of control Rainbow Roller just before a &quot;Cloud Quake&quot; caused by the spirit, which ruins Care-a-Lot. He informs the others of Nicholas&#x27; troubles on Earth. Using the Rainbow Rescue Beam, he sends Kim and Jason to the park, along with Friend Bear and Secret Bear. They end up in the Forest of Feelings when the portal malfunctions. From a nearby river, the rest of the bears begin searching for them aboard a cloud ship called the Cloud Clipper, leaving behind Good Luck Bear, Grumpy Bear, Grams Bear and the cubs in Care-a-Lot.

Within the Forest, the children and their friends are introduced to Brave Heart Lion and Playful Heart Monkey, two of the Care Bear Cousins. Later on, the other bears discover more of these creatures, among them Cozy Heart Penguin, Lotsa Heart Elephant, Swift Heart Rabbit, and Bright Heart Raccoon. During their stay, the spirit attacks them in several disguises: a pike, tree, and eagle. After the Care Bears and their Cousins defeat it, they venture back to Earth with the remaining cousins Loyal Heart Dog, Proud Heart Cat, Gentle Heart Lamb, and Treat Heart Pig to save Nicholas from its influence.

At the park, Nicholas obtains the ingredients for his spell against the children and the creatures. After he casts it, the Care Bears and company engage in a long battle. The bears shoot beams of bright light on him, forming their &quot;Stare&quot;; the Cousins help with their &quot;Call&quot; – Good Luck Bear and Grumpy Bear arriving in time to help after fixing the Rainbow Rescue Beam. As the creatures&#x27; power drains away, Nicholas and the spirit briefly regain control. After Kim and Jason assist him, he finally realizes his misdeeds. With Secret Bear&#x27;s help, he closes the spirit&#x27;s face back into the book and saves himself, the park, and the world. He thanks the group and reunites with Fetuccini, while Tenderheart Bear inducts the Care Bear Cousins into the Care Bear Family and gives them their own tummy symbols, and Kim and Jason find new parents who take them to one of Nicholas&#x27; shows.

As Mr. Cherrywood finishes his story, it is revealed that he is actually Nicholas. Tenderheart Bear, who has been listening from outside a window, returns to Care-a-Lot in his Cloudmobile.

==Production==
===Development===
The Care Bears were created in 1981 by Those Characters from Cleveland (TCFC), a division of the Cleveland greeting card company American Greetings Corporation (AGC). That same year, the title characters made their debut on greeting cards by Elena Kucharik, while American Greetings began to develop a feature-length film using the characters. Kucharik, along with Linda Denham, Linda Edwards, Muriel Fahrion, Dave Polter, Tom Schneider, Ralph Shaffer, and Clark Wiley, created the original characters. Early in their tenure, the Bears appeared as toys from the Kenner company, and starred in two syndicated television specials from a Canadian animation studio, Atkinson Film-Arts of Ottawa: &quot;The Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine&quot; (1984).

Production of the first feature took place at another Canadian outlet, Toronto&#x27;s Nelvana studio. This came in a period in the company&#x27;s history which Nelvana co-founder Michael Hirsh refers to as its &quot;dark years&quot;. At the time, Nelvana had just finished production of its first full-length film, 1983&#x27;s &quot;Rock &amp; Rule&quot;, which was produced using almost all of its resources (for around US$8 million), and failed to find proper distribution. The film put them on the verge of closing down. Soon after, the Nelvana team began doing work on television shows like &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; (from DIC Entertainment), &quot;20 Minute Workout&quot; (from Orion Television), and &quot;Mr. Microchip&quot;. During this period, they also made syndicated specials based on American Greetings properties: Strawberry Shortcake, The Get Along Gang, and Herself the Elf. &quot;In some instances,&quot; noted Harvey Levin, vice-president of marketing and entertainment communications at TCFC, &quot;their capabilities [on the Strawberry Shortcake specials] surpassed Disney quality.&quot; Various companies vied to produce a Care Bears feature, and Nelvana was the first to do so; Hirsh sought to seize the opportunity after hearing of its development. DIC Entertainment also expressed interest. Thanks to the Strawberry Shortcake specials and their experience on &quot;Rock &amp; Rule&quot;, Nelvana acquired the rights to the characters and gained a contract from American Greetings to create the script. To convince the production partnership of TCFC and Kenner Toys, Hirsh held a competition inspired by Pepsi-Cola&#x27;s &quot;Pepsi Challenge&quot; commercials of the time, in which he tested clips from Nelvana and other vying studios and checked the &quot;animation quality, music, sound effects, and colour&quot; of each. He then asked the producers to decide on the best demo, and Nelvana scored highest. Hirsh later recalled the words of his partners: &quot;We know you&#x27;ve rigged this against everybody else because you&#x27;ve chosen the clips. But we like the approach.&quot;

===Producers and crew===
&quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; was one of the first films to be based directly on an established toy line. It featured the ten original Bears, along with six additions to the line-up, and marked the media debut of the Care Bear Cousins. Produced for at least US$2 million, the film was financed by American Greetings, the owners of the Care Bears franchise; General Mills, the toys&#x27; distributor; and television syndicator LBS Communications. The Kenner company also took part in the production. Brought in under budget, &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; became Nelvana&#x27;s second feature-length production, and was made over an eight-month period that lasted until February 1985. Michael Hirsh is quoted as saying in Daniel Stoffman&#x27;s 2002 book, &quot;The Nelvana Story&quot;: &quot;Nobody had ever made an animated movie for theatrical release for as little money and in as little time.&quot; In 2009 his partner, Clive A. Smith, told &quot;Canadian Business&quot; magazine: &quot;I swear I grimaced at the thought of doing a Care Bears feature. But Michael [Hirsh] went out and actually brought that project in.&quot; Nelvana was responsible for the script, several special effects, including those for the &quot;Care Bear Stare&quot;, and hired musicians and voice actors. With this project, Arna Selznick became the third of only four women ever to direct an animated feature; prior to this, she worked on several Nelvana productions, including &quot;Strawberry Shortcake and the Baby Without a Name&quot;. Nelvana&#x27;s founders—Michael Hirsh, Patrick Loubert, and Clive A. Smith—participated as the main producers. The studio&#x27;s roster included Charles Bonifacio, the director of animation, and supervising animator D. Brewster, who previously took part in the animation courses at Ontario&#x27;s Sheridan College. Dale Schott, who served as a storyboard artist, remarked that &quot;Nelvana had a lot to do with reviving the low-budget feature&quot; with its efforts on &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot;.

Four employees of the film&#x27;s financiers served as executive producers: Louis Gioia Jr., president of Kenner&#x27;s Marketing Services division; Jack Chojnacki, co-president of TCFC; Carole MacGillvray, who became president of General Mills&#x27; M.A.D. (Marketing and Design) division in February 1984; and Robert Unkel, LBS&#x27; senior vice-president of programming. A fifth producer, American Greetings staffer W. Ray Peterson, went uncredited. Three associate producers worked on the film: Paul Pressler, another employee at Kenner; John Bohach, who later became LBS&#x27; executive vice-president; and Harvey Levin. Lenora Hume, the director of photography on &quot;Rock &amp; Rule&quot;, was the supervising producer.

===Animation===
Along with &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;, &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; was Nelvana&#x27;s first foray into animation outsourcing. Production took place at Nelvana&#x27;s facilities in Toronto, Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest Studios in Taiwan and the newly established Hanho Heung-Up and Mihahn studios in South Korea. Delaney and Friends, a Vancouver-based outlet, did the uncredited work. Nelvana faced several problems with their Korean contractors, among them the language barrier between the Canadian crew and the overseas staff, and the unwieldy processes through which the film reels were shipped to the West. At one point, Loubert, Smith, and fellow staffer David Altman spent three days trying to persuade several unpaid animators to return important layout sketches. In exchange for the layouts, Nelvana gave them US$20,000 in South Korean won. By then, the production was falling behind schedule, and an opening date was already set; Loubert sent half of the work to Taiwan (where Lenora Hume supervised), while the remainder stayed in South Korea under Loubert&#x27;s and Smith&#x27;s watch.

Back in Canada, Hirsh tried to promote the unfinished feature before its deadline; unable to get available footage, he instead managed to show potential marketers some Leica reels and a few moments of completed colour animation. According to him, it was the first time an animated &quot;work in progress&quot; was screened to exhibitors; this ploy has since been used by the Disney company, particularly in the case of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (at the 1991 New York Film Festival). &quot;People loved the movie anyway,&quot; he said of this experiment. &quot;I was told it was considered great salesmanship. It made [them] feel that they were part of the process because they were seeing unfinished work.&quot;

===Music===
The music for &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; was composed by Patricia Cullen. The soundtrack album was released in LP and cassette format by Kid Stuff Records in the United States, Six songs were performed by Carole King, John Sebastian, NRBQ, and the Tower of Power, actor Harry Dean Stanton had a guest appearance as Brave Heart Lion for the song &quot;Home is in Your Heart&quot;. The songs were produced by Lou Adler and John Sebastian, with additional lyrics and music by Ken Stephenson, Walt Woodward, and David Bird, Nelvana crewmember Peter Hudecki prepared the song sequences.

Before &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot;, Sebastian contributed to several other Nelvana specials, including &quot;The Devil and Daniel Mouse&quot; (1978) and &quot;Easter Fever&quot; (1980). When asked to compose three tracks for the film, he learned about the characters since he was unfamiliar with the franchise. Despite his misgivings on the marketing aspects, Sebastian said in April 1985, &quot;I think their central theme—being candid about your feelings, sharing your feelings—is a very positive message for children.&quot;

Adele Freedman of Toronto&#x27;s &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote positively about the music in the film:

Other critics tended to differ. The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;″s Stephen Hunter found that &quot;the film integrates its music into the story very clumsily. It&#x27;s not merely that the numbers are forgettable—they are—it&#x27;s that they&#x27;re shoe-horned so obviously into the story that they don&#x27;t amplify it, they stop it cold.&quot; Likewise, Michael Blowen of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; said that &quot;the uninspired songs ... add nothing to the banal plot.&quot;

==Release==

In 1984, before the film&#x27;s completion, Carole MacGillvray offered &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; for consideration to major studios in the US; since they did not see the financial potential in a picture aimed strictly at children, they declined the offer. MacGillvray told &quot;Adweek&quot; magazine in April 1985, &quot;I made several trips, and I was really disappointed. They kept telling me things like &#x27;Animated movies won&#x27;t sell&#x27; and &#x27;Maybe we&#x27;d consider it if you were Disney,&#x27; but most just said, &#x27;You&#x27;re very nice, good-bye.&#x27; &quot; When few takers were left, she took it to the Samuel Goldwyn Company. A newcomer in the independent market, it agreed to release the film. Comparing the title characters&#x27; appeal to Hollywood stars like Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford, founder Samuel Goldwyn Jr. remarked: &quot;Having my [two] children, I know these bears are stars, too.&quot;

According to the 1985 edition of &quot;Guinness Film Facts and Feats&quot;, the Samuel Goldwyn Company spent up to US$24 million on the publicity budget for &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot;, the largest at that time. The film&#x27;s advertising budget was US$4 million; &quot;Variety&quot; reported that &quot;the beneficiaries of [its] merchandising tie-ins have earmarked [the remaining] $20,000,000 to promo Care Bear products in step with the film&#x27;s release&quot;. For the film&#x27;s promotion, Goldwyn&#x27;s staff partnered with Kenner Toys and the fast food chain Pizza Hut; there were also tie-ins on Trix cereal boxes. Parker Brothers published two tie-in books, &quot;Meet the Care Bear Cousins&quot; and &quot;Keep On Caring&quot;, shortly after the film&#x27;s release; both were reissued in October 1985 by Children&#x27;s Press.

The Goldwyn staff came up with two advertising strategies, which tested well with the company—one was aimed at the film&#x27;s target audience of children as young as age five; another targeted grown-ups, parents, and older children. In the words of Cliff Hauser, the distributor&#x27;s executive director of marketing, &quot;We didn&#x27;t want parents to think the movie was threatening. So the big debate was—although the formula for success in animated film is the triumph of good over evil—how can you do that in single-image ads?&quot; Jeff Lipsky, vice-president of theatrical at Goldwyn, referred to the first one as &quot;the cheery approach&quot;; ads therein featured the Care Bears on clouds, and carried the tagline &quot;A movie that&#x27;ll make the whole family care-a-lot&quot;. Hauser said, &quot;That&#x27;s one that a mother can look at and know she can take the 2-year-old to it and not worry.&quot; The other campaign, which Lipsky called &quot;more Disney-esque&quot;, featured an evil tree whose hands reached out to capture the Bears; its tagline, &quot;What happens when the world stops caring?&quot;, was also seen on the official poster. Bingham Ray, Goldwyn&#x27;s vice-president of distribution, was involved in the promotional efforts.

Around opening time, Hirsh predicted that &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; would be its decade&#x27;s response to &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, both from Walt Disney Productions. Loubert added, &quot;These characters say something important to children. Our challenge has been to create a very distinct character for each Care Bear. A lot of effort went into bringing out their individuality.&quot; Some time afterward, Hirsh conceded that parents had to come to the film, out of respect for the dark content within. &quot;Frightening scenes,&quot; he said, &quot;are a necessity for the reality of the hero and villain—just as it works in nursery rhymes. Kids work out their fears this way.&quot; TCFC&#x27;s Jack Chojnacki offered this vindication in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;: &quot;We consider a film one of the many products we license. When we started the whole Care Bears project we knew the importance of bears in the market but that there was a void. There were no specific bears. In the movie marketplace there was a void for good family-fare films.&quot; And, in the words of Carole MacGillvray, &quot;Toy recognition drives this movie.&quot;

===North America===

&quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; premiered in Washington, D.C., on March 24, 1985, as part of a Special Olympics benefit; Georgia Engel, the voice of Love-a-lot Bear, attended this event. The film opened on March 29, 1985, in the United States and Canada, as Nelvana&#x27;s first widely released feature. It became surprisingly successful at the North American box office, playing primarily at matinees and early evening showings. At the time, the North American film industry was bereft of children&#x27;s and family fare; with &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot;, Hirsh said, &quot;There&#x27;s such a large audience for a film that appeals primarily to 6-year-olds.&quot; He remarked later on, &quot;What we&#x27;ve done [at Nelvana] is tailor the film to a pre-literate audience, the very young. It&#x27;s interesting to see the audience. The kids are fixated on the screen. [It&#x27;s] awesome to them.&quot; Clive A. Smith observed that some children came to showings with their Bears; long line-ups held back its audience in several cities. Among those attending the matinee screenings was John Waters, a filmmaker known for controversial and cult classics &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; (1972) and &quot;Polyester&quot; (1981). The film made an appearance at the USA Film Festival in Dallas, Texas, during its release.

When shown in theatres, the feature was immediately followed by Nelvana&#x27;s TV special, &quot;Strawberry Shortcake Meets the Berrykins&quot;. It was directed by Laura Shepherd and produced by Nelvana&#x27;s founders along with Lenora Hume. The story involves Strawberry Shortcake and a tiny group of creatures called the Berrykins as they work to clear their home of Strawberryland of the &quot;world&#x27;s favourite perfume&quot;, a pungent odour which was unleashed from a purple cloud. LBS Communications syndicated it on US television around the time of &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot;″s theatrical tenure; a video release from Family Home Entertainment soon followed.

&quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; ranked fourth at the North American box office on its first two weekends, grossing US$3.7 million and US$3.2 million respectively. It was screened in 1,003 venues during its first four weeks. After three months, it grossed about US$23 million in the United States, and placed 40th among 1985&#x27;s major films; it brought in US$9,435,000 in rentals for the Goldwyn company. In Canada, the film was released by Astral Films and Criterion Pictures Corporation, and made C$1,845,000 by the end of 1985. It was the year&#x27;s highest-grossing release in that market, followed by Disney&#x27;s &quot;One Magic Christmas&quot; and a Quebec production called &quot;The Alley Cat (Le Matou)&quot;.

Several months after &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot;, Walt Disney Pictures released its animated feature &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;. Costing US$25 million, it was the most expensive animated film of its time, but grossed less than Nelvana&#x27;s production (US$21.3 million). As a result, &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot;″s performance alarmed animators at the Disney Studios; Don Bluth, a former recruit, dismissed the &quot;public taste&quot; factor that it demonstrated. Another animator, Ron Clements, later reflected on this: &quot;Everyone was kind of scared about the future of Disney animation. It wasn&#x27;t a good time. It was really a terrible time.&quot; This sentiment was echoed in &quot;Waking Sleeping Beauty&quot;, Disney&#x27;s 2010 documentary on the revival of its animation unit. While comparing &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; with &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot;, Eleanor Ringel of &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; singled out the &quot;putrid pastels&quot; of Nelvana&#x27;s production and commented that they &quot;don&#x27;t even deserve to be mentioned in the same review.&quot; Months afterward, a re-issue of Disney&#x27;s &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; surpassed both &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; and &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;, with over US$30 million in sales.

Sometime after the film&#x27;s release, Children&#x27;s Video Library (a division of Vestron Video) picked up the video rights to &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; for US$1.8 million. It was released in the United States on July 10, 1985, in VHS and Betamax formats. On August 10, 1985, it debuted in 26th place on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Videocassette Rentals chart. It ranked fourth on the first edition of the magazine&#x27;s Top Kid Video chart (on October 5). It was tracked by &quot;Video Insider&quot;″s children&#x27;s chart (on August 30, 1985), as one of five toy-related titles on tape (along with two compilations of Hasbro&#x27;s &quot;Transformers&quot; series; another with Hallmark Cards&#x27; Rainbow Brite; and the last with Strawberry Shortcake). By 1988, Vestron&#x27;s edition sold over 140,000 copies. In 1990, Video Treasures reissued it on videocassette; on October 10, 1995, Hallmark Home Entertainment published another VHS edition as part of a six-title package from Goldwyn and Britain&#x27;s Rank Organisation.

On September 5, 2000, MGM Home Entertainment re-released the film on VHS under the MGM Family Entertainment label; the DVD edition premiered on August 6, 2002, and was packaged with the 1978 British family film &quot;The Water Babies&quot;. In 2003, the film was inducted into the MGM Kids line. In honour of the Care Bears&#x27; 25th anniversary, another DVD edition of the film was released on March 20, 2007, with restored picture quality; it contained the franchise&#x27;s second Atkinson Film-Arts special, &quot;The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine&quot;, as an extra. American Greetings launched an official anniversary website and a Dodge Grand Caravan giveaway as part of the proceedings. By 2007, home video sales of &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; totaled over five million units. It was later re-released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on DVD on March 5, 2013. To date, this is the only theatrical &quot;Care Bears&quot; movie from the 1980s to be known for being successfully reissued, outselling &quot;A New Generation&quot;, which had not been reissued after the 2003 DVD release.

&quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; was scheduled to premiere on the US premium television network, Disney Channel, on June 28, 1986, but did so one month in advance. In September 1987, the film made its terrestrial broadcast premiere on the ABC network&#x27;s Saturday morning schedule. It also aired on American Movie Classics on July 7, 1991, and on Showtime and The Movie Channel in the 2000s. The film aired on Starz Entertainment&#x27;s Encore channel in September 2007, as part of its &quot;Big &#x27;80s&quot; Labour Day marathon, chronicling various releases from that decade. It was among the first films shown on Canada&#x27;s Moviepix channel in October 1994.

===International===
Amid the US and Canadian success of &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot;, Goldwyn took the film to the 38th edition of the Cannes Film Festival, where it was highly received; a group of costumed Care Bears strolled along the Croisette to promote the picture. Among its international distributors was Germany&#x27;s Filmwelt, which released it on March 20, 1986, under the title &quot;Der Glücksbärchi Film&quot;. It sold 538,487 tickets in that territory, placing 47th among new releases, and grossed over DM4,013,000 (€2,051,600; US$2,868,000). The film was released on VHS in October 1986 by the local division of CBS/Fox Video, and aired on national broadcaster ARD during the 1988 Christmas season.

&quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; was released in the United Kingdom by Miracle Films in August 1985, and did well in matinee-only engagements; a video edition from Vestron&#x27;s local branch came out some months later. It was also released in Australia on December 12, 1985. In February 1986, the film was released by France&#x27;s Artédis under the franchise name &quot;Les Bisounours&quot;; publishing rights were held by Hachette Livre. It opened on March 20, 1986, in the Netherlands as &quot;De Troetelbeertjes&quot;. On July 21, 1986, the Bermudez de Castro company opened the film in Madrid, Spain, as &quot;Los osos amorosos&quot;; it grossed over 23,728,000 Pts (€142,606; US$199,500) from 93,294 admissions. Among that country&#x27;s Catalan speakers, it is known as &quot;Els Óssos Amorosos&quot;. The film was released in Czechoslovakia by Ústřední půjčovna filmů on December 1, 1988, as &quot;Starostliví medvídci&quot;. It was advertised in Italy as &quot;Orsetti del cuore&quot;, and in Poland as &quot;Opowieść o Troskliwych Misiach&quot;.

In Mexico, &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; was released on April 24, 1986, as &quot;Los ositos cariñositos&quot;. In Brazil, the film was promoted as &quot;As novas aventuras dos ursinhos carinhosos&quot;. Television airings occurred on Australia&#x27;s Nine Network in 1987, Philippines&#x27; ABS-CBN in December 1992, and Malaysia&#x27;s TV2 (in August 1993) and Disney Channel in April 2002.

===Aftermath===
As opposed to &quot;Rock &amp; Rule&quot; (which Nelvana owned outright), the characters in &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; were the property of American Greetings, who paid Nelvana a service fee to work on the film. Nelvana, however, hardly received any profits from the production; this caused its founders to express regret about the situation. In &quot;The Nelvana Story&quot;, Patrick Loubert explained the catch-22 that they would face numerous times in the years to come: &quot;We could have waived our fee and taken a big piece of the film. We were offered that deal. But if we had waived the fee, we couldn&#x27;t have made the payroll. Once the picture was hugely successful, we thought we should have waived the fee. But we couldn&#x27;t have.&quot; At the time of production, Nelvana had begun embarking on service work that other companies provided them, not only to help ease the debts the studio incurred after &quot;Rock &amp; Rule&quot;, but also because it proved profitable in due time.

By 1989, &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; made over US$34 million worldwide, according to &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine; this made it the highest-grossing animated feature film to come from Canada, and the highest grossing animated film of 1985. It also became the highest-grossing animated film not produced by the Disney company, surpassing the US$11 million of Atlantic Entertainment Group&#x27;s 1983 release &quot;The Smurfs and the Magic Flute&quot;; Don Bluth&#x27;s &quot;An American Tail&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; (1988) later took over this position. As of 2023, that title is held by Illumination Entertainment and Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot; (2023), with US$1.288 billion. The film virtually saved a fledgling Nelvana from going out of business, and was the company&#x27;s highest-grossing venture. It is also among the highest-grossing releases from either incarnation of Samuel Goldwyn.

==Reception and legacy==
===Critical analysis===

&quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; received mixed reviews. During its original release, &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; had varying degrees of success with critics. &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Richard Grenier wrote, &quot;[The film] recalls vintage Walt Disney, both in substance and in the style of hand animation.&quot; Rick Lyman of Knight Ridder News Services said in his review: &quot;Any movie—even an animated one—that has characters with names such as Funshine Bear, Love-a-lot Bear, and Lotsa Heart Elephant is obviously going to rank quite high on the cute meter. And this one sends the needle right off the chart. You&#x27;ve never seen such cuteness.&quot; Adele Freedman also gave it a positive review, commenting: &quot;[It] has a lot going for it if you can tolerate the Bears.&quot; Edward Jones of Virginia&#x27;s &quot;The Free Lance-Star&quot; praised it, but stated that &quot;More comedy would have helped broaden [its] appeal to older youngsters.&quot; The &quot;Deseret News&quot; of Utah gave it three stars out of four (a &quot;Good&quot; grade) with this comment: &quot;Sticky sweet, but a nice message.&quot;

Michael Blowen began his review of the film by stating that &quot;[it] satisfies the primary obligation of a bedtime story—before it&#x27;s half over the children will be fast asleep.&quot; He added that &quot;this sugar-coated trifle could only satisfy the most Care Bears fan&quot;, and that &quot;the characters themselves lack definition&quot;. The &quot;Arkansas Democrat-Gazette&quot; said, &quot;Who except a callous scrooge would carp about the fact that &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; espouses a psychopop philosophy of &#x27;sharing our feelings&#x27; that seems drawn straight from the pages on one of those insufferable self-motivation tomes? No one, that&#x27;s who.&quot; Paul Attanasio of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;The best cartoons recognize the dark side of kids, their penchant for violence, their fearful fantasies. [This movie] just patronizes them. It even has a child chortling, &#x27;Aren&#x27;t parents great!&#x27; Well, they are and they aren&#x27;t, and kids know that.&quot;

The animation in the film received mixed reviews as well. Adele Freedman praised the style and backgrounds, and called the special effects &quot;stunning&quot;. Likewise, John Stanley wrote that &quot;The style is cartoonish and cute&quot; in his 1988 film guide, &quot;Revenge of the Creature Features&quot;. While complimenting it as &quot;a harmless film diversion&quot;, Stephen Hunter said that &quot;the movie has the lustrous, glossy look of the very best in children&#x27;s book illustrations&quot;. &quot;On the other hand,&quot; he added, &quot;the producers obviously couldn&#x27;t afford an expensive [multiplane] camera, the staple of the Disney product, and so the scenes have a depressing flatness to them. And the backgrounds, so brilliantly developed in Disney, tend to be blurry and hastily done.&quot; Jim Moorhead of Florida&#x27;s &quot;The Evening Independent&quot; said, &quot;[Nelvana&#x27;s] animation is not the best. Far from it. Everything&#x27;s in pastels, fine details are largely missing, mouth movements are minimal and the motions of the figures are scarcely better than some of those awful Saturday morning cartoons on TV.&quot; The staff at &quot;Variety&quot; magazine stated that the &quot;style ... tends towards a primer reading level.&quot; &quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Film Guide&quot; called it &quot;sluggishly animated and narrated&quot;. As with the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Janet Maslin found that the quality paled in comparison to Disney features (in this case, 1940&#x27;s &quot;Pinocchio&quot;).

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;&#x27; Charles Solomon (in his 1989 book &quot;Enchanted Drawings: The History of Animation&quot;), and Michael Janusonis of Rhode Island&#x27;s &quot;Providence Journal&quot;, faulted the plot. The &quot;Evening Independent&quot;″s Moorhead and Jim Davidson of the &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot; noticed at least two parallel storylines in the film, one of which involved the magician Nicholas. The National Coalition on Television Violence counted at least 20 acts of violence throughout the picture.

Critics questioned its purpose as a feature-length advertisement for Care Bears merchandise; among them were Charles Solomon, Paul Attanasio, &quot;The Morning Call&quot; of Pennsylvania, and Bill Cosford of &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;. The &quot;Boca Raton News&quot;&#x27; Skip Sheffield commented, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t help being bothered by the blatant commercialism of this whole venture.&quot; The British magazine &quot;Films and Filming&quot; remarked: &quot;The purpose of the film is presumably to sell more toys as it unashamedly pushes the message that without at least one Care Bear around life can be very lonely.&quot; Stoffman observed, &quot;one of the youngest target audiences of any animated movie&quot;, as did the &quot;Halliwell&#x27;s&quot; staff; film critic Leonard Maltin (in his &quot;Movie Guide&quot;); and Henry Herx (in his &quot;Family Guide to Movies on Video&quot;).

The 1986 &quot;International Film Guide&quot; called it &quot;an elementary piece of animation lacking colour and character, with not much humour, quite lacking in charm, and indifferently scored&quot;. Maltin gave it two stars out of four in his &quot;Movie Guide&quot;; similarly, the Gale Group publication, &quot;VideoHound&#x27;s Golden Movie Retriever&quot;, gave it two bones out of four in its 1997 edition. According to Derek Owen of &quot;Time Out&quot; &quot;Film Guide&quot;, &quot;Adults forced to accompany three-year-olds to the movie would have had a little moment of satisfaction when the time came to shovel the Care Bears toys out of the house into landfill sites.&quot;

The mixed reception carried on in the years ahead: in her 1995 book &quot;Inside Kidvid&quot;, Loretta MacAlpine said of the film and its subsequent follow-ups, &quot;If you can hack the sugarcoated attitudes of this group of cuddly bears, more power to you! There&#x27;s nothing insidious about the Care Bears, but their overbearing sweetness may not appeal to all viewers.&quot; She cautioned parents of the merchandising aspect behind the tapes. Dave Gathman of Illinois&#x27; &quot;Courier-News&quot; wrote in 1998, &quot;One &quot;Care Bears Movie&quot; ... can give all G-rated entertainment a bad name.&quot; In 2003 the &quot;Erie Times-News&quot; acknowledged its financial success, but commented on its &quot;lack of a creative title&quot;. Animation expert Jerry Beck wrote in his 2005 book, &quot;The Animated Movie Guide&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a simple, serviceable adventure with several standout sequences. ... There&#x27;s no doubt about it, this is a children&#x27;s film aimed at the under-seven crowd. But it&#x27;s one of the better animated children&#x27;s films produced during this period.&quot;

Common Sense Media gave this movie some average reviews, as the group stated &quot;&quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; was made for young kids, but this movie&#x27;s plot has some dark scenes and parents will want to be close at hand to comfort young viewers.&quot;

&quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; holds a 43% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 7 reviews.

In the words of Jerry Beck, &quot;[&quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot;″s] box-office gross signalled to Hollywood a renewed interest in animated features, albeit for children. This is something &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; tried to accomplish but failed to do.&quot; A plethora of children&#x27;s and family film entertainment followed in its wake, such as &quot;Sesame Street Presents: Follow That Bird&quot; from Warner Bros., and a re-issue of Universal Studios&#x27; &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;. Atlantic Releasing joined this movement by establishing Clubhouse Pictures, which showed G-rated films during 1986. Nelvana&#x27;s film helped to bring back matinee engagements to prominence across North America.

Mentioning &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; as &quot;the most recent example&quot;, Charles Solomon brought up the subject of feature-length toy adaptations in an April 1985 interview on Los Angeles&#x27; KUSC-FM. He spoke to Warner Bros. animator Chuck Jones, who replied: &quot;I feel that it&#x27;s proper—after all, that&#x27;s the way &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; was written: the dolls were all made first, then they made the picture about the dolls, right?&quot; In July 1985, Sarah Stiansen of United Press International (UPI) called &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; &quot;another licensing innovation for TCFC&quot;, following the department&#x27;s previous endeavours. UPI&#x27;s Vernon Scott (in 1985), and Bruce A. Austin (in his 1989 book &quot;Immediate Seating&quot;), observed how the merchandising arrived in advance of the film&#x27;s release. In forthcoming years, several media adaptations based on established toy lines would follow a similar marketing tactic. Examples included films based on Hasbro&#x27;s Transformers (in 1986 and 2007) and My Little Pony (in 1986, 2017, and &quot;A New Generation&quot;); features with Tonka&#x27;s GoBots (&quot;&quot;) and Pound Puppies (&quot;Legend of Big Paw&quot;); and a television series and feature with Hallmark&#x27;s Rainbow Brite.

===In popular culture===
&quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; was parodied in &quot;At the Movies&quot;, a 1991 episode of Nickelodeon and Klasky Csupo&#x27;s animated series &quot;Rugrats&quot;. In that episode, the Pickles family goes to see &quot;The Land Without Smiles&quot;, starring the Dummi Bears.

===Allusions===

In his &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; review, David Sterritt observed that &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; was mostly influenced by &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, a 1797 poem by German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, along with &quot;a trace of H. P. Lovecraft &quot;that probably wasn&#x27;t intended&quot;. He went on to say, &quot;I also noticed a subtle sexism at work. Why must it be the little girl [Kim] who dreams of being a nurse and the little boy [Jason] of being a jet pilot—and not the other way around, to stimulate young imaginations instead of echoing past patterns?&quot; Blowen wrote that the two children both get turned &quot;from to idealists&quot;. Joe Fox of Ontario&#x27;s &quot;The Windsor Star&quot;, and Stephen Hunter, compared the Bears&#x27; home of Care-a-lot to King Arthur&#x27;s mythical castle of Camelot; Blowen commented that in this place, &quot;altruism is king&quot;. Hunter noted that &quot;the celestial physics are left vague&quot;, concerning Kim and Jason&#x27;s trip from Care-a-lot to the Forest of Feelings. Critics compared at least two aspects of the film to Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;: the Spirit received similarities to the Magic Mirror and the Wicked Queen, but Charles Solomon felt that the Bears lacked the individual qualities of the Dwarfs. Solomon noted that in animated features of that era, villains such as the Spirit &quot;lacked motivation—if the viewer accepts their evil intentions, it&#x27;s only because he&#x27;s been told to&quot;. According to Tom Ogden (in his 1997 book &quot;Wizards and Sorcerers: From Abracabadra to Zoroaster&quot;), the Bears&#x27; Stare against the Spirit serves as a kind of white magic. &quot;Such a non-violent solution,&quot; wrote Bruce Bailey in &quot;The Montreal Gazette&quot;, &quot;should sit well with peace lobbyists&quot;. According to a 2005 article in &quot;The Times&quot; of London, an Internet reviewer called &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; &quot;a fine example of Christian socialism&quot;.

===Accolades===
At the 1985 Genie Awards in its native Canada, &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot; won the Golden Reel Award for being the country&#x27;s highest-grossing film of the year. Ron Cohen, president of the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television, presented the award to producers Hirsh, Loubert, and Smith. John Sebastian&#x27;s &quot;Nobody Cares Like a Bear&quot; received a Genie nomination for Best Original Song; his performance was part of CBC&#x27;s live telecast of the ceremony on March 20, 1986. The film received a Young Artist Award nomination for &quot;Best Family Animation Series or Special&quot;, but lost to the CBS series &quot;The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show&quot;. During its 21st annual award ceremony on October 17, 1985, Nashville&#x27;s performance rights organization SESAC honoured Woodward and Bird for their songwriting efforts.

==Follow-ups==
After the release of &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot;, DIC Entertainment produced a syndicated 11-episode television series featuring the title characters. Another series, Nelvana&#x27;s &quot;The Care Bears Family&quot;, premiered on ABC in the US and Canada&#x27;s Global in September 1986, and was subsequently broadcast in 140 countries. Nelvana followed the first film with another two theatrical installments, &quot;Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland&quot; (1987); neither made as much of a critical or commercial impact. &quot;A New Generation&quot;, released by Columbia Pictures, made over US$8.5 million in North America and US$12 million worldwide &quot;Adventure in Wonderland&quot; was self-financed by Nelvana and released by Cineplex Odeon Films, and grossed US$2.608 million domestically, with worldwide earnings of US$6 million; it barely recovered its costs. Because of this, Michael Hirsh later declared, &quot;It was just one sequel too many.&quot; The Bears returned for one more animated production, &quot;Care Bears Nutcracker Suite&quot;, which debuted on video and television in December 1988. The franchise&#x27;s next feature film, 2004&#x27;s &quot;Journey to Joke-a-lot&quot;, also premiered on video (via Lionsgate and Family Home Entertainment).

<text>Human Head Studios, Inc. was an American video game developer located in Madison, Wisconsin.

== History ==
Human Head Studios was founded in October 1997 by a group of six developers formerly from Raven Software: Ben Gokey, Chris Rhinehart, Paul MacArthur, Ted Halsted, James Sumwalt, and Shane Gurno—later joined by game producer Tim Gerritsen as co-owner in June 1998. Regarding the origin of the studio&#x27;s name, Gerritsen explained: &quot;When the guys were thinking of leaving Raven Software, someone posted a message via e-mail that they had lost some money. This started people saying they had lost all sorts of things. One person posted that they had misplaced a bag of human heads and this gave the inspiration for the name.&quot; Their first game was &quot;Rune&quot;, a third-person Viking action game. The company also worked on the long-anticipated first-person shooter &quot;Prey&quot;, a game that was executive produced by 3D Realms.

On April 20, 2007, a news report indicated that the company&#x27;s headquarters were partially destroyed in a fire. No injuries were reported. On October 1, 2007, the company moved back into their newly renovated offices. In 2014, Human Head announced that they have revived a multiplayer video game called &quot;Minimum&quot; from TimeGate Studios, which filed for bankruptcy in 2013. Their final major release was the infamous &quot;The Quiet Man&quot;, an action-adventure beat-em-up published by Square Enix which features full-motion video cutscenes.

On November 13, 2019, the studio announced its closure, immediately after the release of &quot;Rune II&quot;. The whole team subsequently formed a new studio, Roundhouse Studios, under ZeniMax Media. Chris Rhinehart of Human Head/Roundhouse stated that &quot;Sadly, we had to wind down the business of Human Head Studios and close its doors&quot;, but had been able to reach out to ZeniMax to establish this new studio. Roundhouse Studios was closed in May 2024 and its team was moved to ZeniMax Online Studios.

<text>Jacob de Wit (19 December 1695 – 12 November 1754) was a Dutch artist and interior decorator who painted many religious scenes.

==Biography==

Jacob de Wit was born in Amsterdam, and became famous for his door and ceiling paintings. He lived on the Keizersgracht in Amsterdam, and many of the buildings on the Keizersgracht still have door or ceiling paintings done by him. Since many of the families who lived in Amsterdam in those days had country villas, de Wit also painted in houses in the fashionable areas of Haarlem and the Vecht river. 

According to the RKD he was the pupil of Albert van Spiers in Amsterdam and Jacob van Hal in Antwerp where he became a member of the Guild of St. Luke in 1714. While in Antwerp, he made a series of watercolor sketches of the Rubens ceilings in the Carolus Borromeuskerk in Antwerp. After the church was struck by lightning in 1718 these became a historical document, and his pupil Jan Punt later engraved his sketches and published them in 1751.
His pupils were Jan de Groot (painter from The Hague), Dionys van Nijmegen, Jan Punt, Pieter Tanjé, and the brothers Frans and Jacob Xavery.
Jacob de Wit died in Amsterdam in 1754. Tako Hajo Jelgersma was his follower.

==Major works==
*Baptism of Christ in the Jordan (1716) – Chalk and pen drawing
*Adoration of the Shepherds (1726) – Oil on canvas
*Holy Family and Trinity, also : The Return from Egypt (1726) – Oil on canvas
*Allegory of Transience (1733) – Oil on canvas
*&quot;Moses Elects Seventy Elders&quot; (1737) – Oil on canvas

==Location of paintings==
*One of his paintings for a door in Heemstede now hangs in Uppsala, Sweden, in the Linnaeus museum.
*A set of paintings of the four seasons depicting cherubs painted in a three-dimensional monochrome style now hangs at Hinton Ampner house in Hampshire.
*Another of his three-dimensional monochrome style cherub paintings hangs in Kingston Lacy house in Dorset.
*Old City Hall (The Hague)
*Museum Willet-Holthuysen

<text>Staples High School is a public high school in Westport, Connecticut, United States. It is named after Horace Staples, who founded the school on April 26, 1884. Westport is one of eight school districts in District Reference Group A (along with Darien, Easton, New Canaan, Redding, Ridgefield, Weston, and Wilton).

==Campus==
The school was first located at Riverside Avenue in a three-level red brick building. In 1958 Staples High School moved to its current location on a campus at 70 North Avenue. As of 2020, the neighborhood around the high school is known as the Staples census-designated place.

==History==
Seeing the &quot;town&#x27;s lack of progress in education,&quot; Horace Staples, a wealthy businessman with interests in shipping, hardware sales, and banking, founded Staples High School. Initially Staples intended to fund the school via an interest left in his will; however, that interest became known while he was still alive, and led to the school&#x27;s foundation being laid in 1884. On April 24, 1884, businesses closed early in Westport to celebrate the dedication of Staples High School. Connecticut Governor Thomas M. Waller attended the opening.

In the first year of operation, commencing in the fall of 1884, Staples High School had 60 of the 807 students attending schools in Westport.

On June 24, 1887, Staples High School conferred its first high school diplomas to six female students who comprised its first graduating class.

In 1909, the town of Westport accepted control of Staples High School from the Horace Staples estate. From 1966 to 1969, Staples attracted some of the biggest names in music to perform in concert. The Animals, Cream, the Yardbirds, the Young Rascals, Sly and the Family Stone and Louis Armstrong to name a few. A short documentary was produced in 2017.

==Activities==

===&quot;Inklings&quot;===
The school newspaper, &quot;Inklings&quot;, has won the Columbia Scholastic Press Association gold medal every year since 2000 (in addition to a silver medal in 1999). The paper has also received the rank of First Place with &quot;Special Honors&quot; from the American Scholastic Press Association since 2001 and has been dubbed &quot;the best school paper in the state&quot; by the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot;.

<doc id="864247" wikidata="Q738446" url="?curid=864247" title="Emmanuel Milingo">
<text>Emmanuel Milingo (born June 13, 1930) is an excommunicated former Roman Catholic archbishop from Zambia. He was ordained in 1958; in 1969, aged 39, Milingo was consecrated by Pope Paul VI as the bishop of the Archdiocese of Lusaka. In 1983, he stepped down from his position as Archbishop of Lusaka after criticism for exorcism and faith healing practices that were not approved by church authorities. In 2001, when Milingo was 71, he received a marriage blessing from Sun Myung Moon, the leader of the Unification Church, despite the prohibition on marriage for ordained priests. In July 2006, he established Married Priests Now!, an advocacy organization to promote the acceptance of married priests in the Roman Catholic Church.

On September 24, 2006, Milingo consecrated four men as bishops (including American George Augustus Stallings Jr., who had established an independent denomination) without a papal mandate. Through that act alone, Milingo had incurred a latae sententiae excommunication, which was stated by the Holy See Press Office two days later. On December 17, 2009, the Holy See Press Office announced that Milingo had been reduced to the lay state, making him no longer a member of the Catholic clergy. Mlingo retired from ministry in his movement for married priests in March 2013, appointing Peter Paul Brennan to take his place.

==Life and career==

===Education and ordination===

Born in 1930 in Mnukwa, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) to Yakobe Milingo and Tomaida Lumbiwe, he was educated at St Mary&#x27;s Minor Seminary in Chipata. He attended the Kasina Seminary and Kachebere Seminary. He was ordained a priest in 1958. He served as the parish priest in Chipata from 1963 to 1966, and founded the Zambia Helpers&#x27; Society during this time. He was the secretary of Mass Media at the Zambia Episcopal Conference from 1966 to 1969 and founded the Daughters of the Redeemer.

Pope Paul VI consecrated him as bishop of the Archdiocese of Lusaka, the capital of Zambia. He served there from 1969 to 1983. In the 1970s, Milingo conducted public religious services of healing and exorcism, which attracted huge crowds. In 1999 and 2000, Milingo participated in mass-marriage ceremonies conducted by Sun Myung Moon&#x27;s Unification Church in Japan and Korea, for which he received a severe written reprimand from Cardinal Angelo Sodano, Vatican Secretary of State.

In 1983, Pope John Paul II transferred Milingo to Rome because of his inappropriate use of his office of exorcism and his role in causing divisions in the Lusaka archdiocese. He was barred from practicing as a priest and bishop in Zambia, but the Pope appointed Milingo a &quot;special delegate&quot; of the Pontifical Council for Migrants and Travelers.

In 1992, Milingo endorsed the book &quot;On the Eucharist, a Divine Appeal&quot;, a collection of messages reputed to have been given by Jesus Christ in an apparition and written from September 8, 1987, to 1991 by Sr. Anna Ali, DOJS. These messages were a traditional call to conversion and eucharistic devotion, as well as expressing sadness over the current state of the Catholic priesthood. Although Milingo did not hold office as a diocesan bishop at the time, his name appears on the book&#x27;s purported &quot;imprimatur&quot;, with the date March 17, 1992.

In the late 1990s, Milingo became well known in traditionalist and sedevacantist circles for a speech he gave at the Our Lady of Fatima 2000 International Conference on World Peace, organized by Canadian priest Nicholas Gruner and held November 18–23, 1996. He said that high-ranking members of the church hierarchy were &quot;followers of Satan&quot; or otherwise enabled evil:
=== Marriage ===
In May 2001, Milingo said that the Roman Catholic Church should provide priests dispensation from the obligation of celibacy and should readmit married priests to the priestly ministry. To &quot;set an example&quot;, at the age of 71, he and Maria Sung, a 43-year-old South Korean acupuncturist and Unificationist, married in a blessing ceremony in New York City, presided over by Sun Myung Moon and Hak Ja Han Moon. In July 2001, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI), then prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, issued a Public Canonical Admonition officially warning Milingo to separate from Moon and from contacts with the Unification Church. Milingo protested the order, saying, &quot;How can I now leave my wife? For 43 years as a celibate priest I only knew God as a male. Now, through my union with Maria, I have come to see the other side of God&#x27;s heart, which is female.&quot;

In a press conference organized by the Unification Church affiliate American Church Leadership Conference, Milingo said, &quot;Celibacy has become a façade, secret affairs and marriages, raping of nuns, illegitimate children, rampant homosexuality, pedophilia and illicit sex have riddled the priesthood. Christ is mocked, the devil laughs.&quot;

In August 2001, Milingo met with Pope John Paul II, who appealed to him: &quot;In the name of Jesus Christ, return to the Catholic Church.&quot; Milingo agreed to separate from Sung and went into seclusion. Sung went on a hunger strike and appeared outside of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica to protest their separation. In an interview on Italian television in 2002, Milingo said that he had spent a year in prayer and meditation in Argentina, at a Capuchin monastery. In November 2003, he made a trip to Africa over the objections of the Catholic bishops there. In 2004 and 2005, he kept a low profile and media accounts suggested that he was living in a monastery near Rome.

===Organization for married priests===

In late June or early July 2006, Milingo quietly left Italy and, on July 12, announced at a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., his plans to &quot;embark on an independent charismatic ministry to reconcile married priests with the Catholic Faith&quot; as an advocate of the removal of the rule of celibacy for Latin Rite priests in the Catholic Church; the group is called Married Priests Now!. The sponsor of the press conference was MJT Television. Archbishop George Augustus Stallings, Jr., also an excommunicated priest, who had founded his own Imani Temple African-American Catholic Congregation and married in 2001 at the same mass event as Milingo, spoke as well.

Stallings said that Milingo &quot;is not seeking to defy or divide the (Roman Catholic) Church, but is acting out of deep love for the Church and concern for its future.&quot; In August 2006 Milingo rejoined his wife. In January 2010 the Catholic News Agency reported that 20 priests in Uganda had formed a breakaway Catholic sect that accepts married priests. This was said to have been inspired by Milingo; the group claims to have around 12,000 members.

=== Excommunication ===
On September 24, 2006, Milingo consecrated four married men as bishops, each of whom were already ordained in the Old Catholic apostolic succession and serving as a bishop in their respective Independent Catholic churches. One of the four was Stallings. The other three were Archbishop Peter Paul Brennan of the Old Catholic Confederation; Archbishop Patrick E. Trujillo of the Old Catholic Church in America, and Archbishop Joseph J. Gouthro of Las Vegas, presiding bishop of the Catholic Apostolic Church International (CACI).

Two days after the consecration of the four Americans as bishops, on September 26, 2006, the Holy See&#x27;s press office announced the excommunication of all five men in a statement that Milingo and the four men involved in the episcopal consecration had automatically incurred excommunication (see &quot;Latæ sententiæ&quot;) in accordance with canon 1382 of the 1983 &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot;. According to the dogma of sacramental character, while the four men were consecrated against Catholic canons, they were validly but illicitly consecrated. In October 2007, Milingo&#x27;s Vatican passport was revoked. This ended his status as a person with diplomatic protection by the Vatican City State.

==Reduction to the lay state==
In December 2007, in Brazil, Milingo conferred episcopal ordination on Harold J. Norwood. On July 15, 2009, in Massa, Italy, he consecrated Vitaliy Kuzhelnyi as a bishop, a former priest of the Russian Orthodox Church and, later, of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.

On December 17, 2009, the Holy See Press Office in a statement announced that Milingo had been dismissed from the clerical state. The statement explained the effect of the action as &quot;loss of the rights and duties attached to the clerical state, except for the obligation of celibacy; prohibition of the exercise of any ministry, except as provided for by Canon 976 of the Code of Canon Law in those cases involving danger of death; loss of all offices and functions and of all delegated power, as well as prohibition of the use of clerical attire. Consequently, the participation of the faithful in any future celebrations organized by Archbishop Emmanuel Milingo is to be considered unlawful.&quot;

On June 11, 2011, the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts issued a statement about illicitly consecrated bishops, pointing out the canons which provide for an automatic &quot;latae sententiae&quot; excommunication for both the consecrating bishop and those consecrated. Bishop Juan Ignacio Arrieta, Secretary of the Council, explained that the statement applied to the bishops consecrated by Milingo as well as to more recent cases.

===Ecumenical Catholic Apostolic Church of Peace===

In August 2010, Milingo was named Patriarch for Southern Africa of the new &quot;Ecumenical Catholic Apostolic Church of Peace&quot;. He called for married former Catholic clergy to join the movement. In April 2011, he consecrated the Rev. Peter Njogu as a bishop in Nyeri, Kenya. In 2012, Milingo praised Sun Myung Moon for his work to promote religious unity. Milingo retired from ministry in 2013, appointing Archbishop Peter Paul Brennan as his successor. Later that year, he stated that he still considered himself a Roman Catholic.

<text>The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master is a book about computer programming and software engineering, written by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas and published in October 1999. It is used as a textbook in related university courses. It was the first in a series of books under the label &quot;The Pragmatic Bookshelf&quot;. A second edition, The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey to Mastery was released in 2019 for the book&#x27;s 20th anniversary, with major revisions and new material which reflects new technology and other changes in the software engineering industry over the last twenty years.

The book does not present a systematic theory, but rather a collection of tips to improve the development process in a pragmatic way. The main qualities of what the authors refer to as a pragmatic programmer are being an early adopter, to have fast adaptation, inquisitiveness and critical thinking, realism, and being a jack-of-all-trades.

The book uses analogies and short stories to present development methodologies and caveats, for example the broken windows theory, the story of the stone soup, or the boiling frog. Some concepts were named or popularized in the book, such as DRY (or &quot;don&#x27;t repeat yourself&quot;) and rubber duck debugging, a method of debugging whose name is a reference to a story in the book.

<text>The  (German: &quot;hunting Panther&quot;), Sd.Kfz. 173, was a tank destroyer (, a self-propelled anti-tank gun) built by Germany during World War II.
The combined the 8.8 cm Pak 43 anti-tank gun, similar to the main gun of the Tiger II, with the armor and suspension of the Panther chassis.

It entered service in 1944 and served on the Eastern and Western Fronts. During the last stages of the war, limited German production resulted in small production numbers, shortage of spare parts, and shortened crew training periods of younger operators.

==Development==
The Jagdpanther was preceded by two attempts at mounting an 8.8 cm gun as a self-propelled anti-tank weapon; &quot;Ferdinand&quot; - also known as (P) - using the ninety-one leftover Porsche-built VK 45.01 (P) chassis from the Tiger tank competition it lost to Henschel in 1942, and the on the Geschützwagen III/IV (which used a combination of the Panzer III and Panzer IV components) chassis. &quot;Ferdinand&quot; proved to be too heavy, and lightly armored and under-powered.

A heavy tank destroyer design based on the 8.8 cm Pak 43 gun and the Panther tank chassis was ordered in late 1942. The full-size model by Daimler-Benz was demonstrated in October 1943 before Hitler. MIAG-built prototypes followed in October/November 1943.

Production started in January 1944; in February, Hitler specified the simpler name instead of its original &quot;&quot;.

To accommodate the heavier-calibre gun, as on previous -style unturreted tank destroyers, the glacis plate and sloped hull sides of the were extended up into an integral fixed casemate as part of the main hull to provide a roomy interior. The had side plates armour thickness increased (to 50 mm) to offset the slightly reduced angle of the side plate to provide enough interior space. Lower frontal hull plate was reduced to while upper hull frontal plate was kept at . The chassis armour changes were also introduced on the main Panther tank assembly lines with the Panther Ausf. G in spring 1944.

It was armed with the long-barreled 8.8 cm Pak 43/3 L/71 gun, similar to the main gun of the Tiger II (&quot;King Tiger&quot;). The gun was mounted in a central mantlet, giving it a limited traverse of twelve degrees to each side. A single 7.92 mm MG 34 machine gun was in a ball mount on the right side of the front glacis plate. The machine gunner was also the radio operator. The driver sat on the left. The gunner had a rangefinder and a periscope telescopic sight. The periscope – linked to the gun mount – was under an armoured housing on the roof.

The had a good power-to-weight ratio and a powerful main gun, enabling crews to destroy any type of Allied tank. Based on the established Panther &quot;Ausf&quot; G chassis, the vehicle encountered few mechanical problems. It was crewed by five: driver, radio operator/machine gunner, commander, gunner, and a loader.

== Variants ==

There were two main variants. The earlier G1 1944 model had a small welded main gun mantlet, one-piece Pak 43/3 gun, a modified Panther A engine deck, and had two vision openings for the driver. The G2 Jagdpanther used a Panther Ausf. G engine deck, a larger gun mantlet bolted externally, and a two-piece KwK 43/4 L/71 gun. Some later G1 models had &#x27;hybrid&#x27; G2 features such as the larger G2 mantlet as changes to the design were implemented. Zimmerit was applied to G1s up to September 1944, then was withdrawn to decrease production time. Early had two vision openings for the driver, whereas late versions had only one. The main gun originally had a monobloc gun barrel, but, May 1944-on, it was gradually replaced by an economical two-part barrel after crews determined barrel wear was uneven.

==Reliability==

Notes for the meeting with Adolf Hitler on 10.28.1944:

Mike Gibb of the Weald Foundation being interviewed by historian James Holland, disagreed that the Jagdpanther was unreliable. He said that the Jagdpanther owned by the Weald foundation, which he had first hand experience with, had done hundreds of miles without any reliability issues normally raised about the tank. When the vehicle was properly maintained, and properly driven, it was reliable. Gibb theorised that claims about the tank being unreliable may have been with some crews who may have been young and inexperienced and not operated or maintained the vehicle properly.

==Production and service==

A total of 413 were produced from January 1944 by three manufacturers: MIAG in Braunschweig produced 268 from January 1944 until the end of the war, Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen Hannover (MNH) produced 112 from November 1944, Maschinenbau und Bahnbedarf (MBA) in Potsdam produced 33 vehicles from December 1944. Planned production was between 100 and 200 a month, but the disruption to German manufacturing made this goal unachievable.

The last &#x27;production&#x27; Jagdpanthers were produced at the factory by German staff just after the end of World War II under the supervision of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) during the American and British occupation of Germany. Nine Panthers and a dozen Jagdpanthers were produced, then shipped to England for evaluation. A complete Panther and a complete Jagdpanther produced this way are displayed at the Bovington Tank Museum, Dorset, with brass plates on them explaining their history.

 equipped heavy antitank battalions () and served mainly on the Eastern Front. In the West, they were encountered in very small numbers late in the Battle of Normandy; the German (&quot;654th Heavy Antitank Battalion&quot;) deployed about twelve against the British armed forces. Seven of the 1. Schwere Panzerjäger Bataillon 559 were involved in the Battle of Geel in September 1944. Later, significant numbers were concentrated in the West for the Ardennes Offensive.

==Survivors==

Four surviving are restored to running condition one each at the at Munster and the (WTS) at Koblenz. The Weald Foundation in the UK restored one to running condition and has a second undergoing restoration. The &quot;Imperial War Museum&quot; at Duxford, UK has restored a to running condition.

;Seven surviving Jagdpanthers are displayed at:
* Bovington Tank Museum, Dorset, UK. One of those assembled by the British Army Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers for trials, late production model.
* Imperial War Museum Duxford, Cambridgeshire, UK. An early production variant, with three shell holes on the right side of the engine compartment with the left side, sectioned and opened to public view. Provenance is uncertain but claimed to be one knocked out during the battle of Hechtel, Belgium by Hugh Griffiths, previously displayed at Imperial War Museum London.

<text>Tang is an American drink mix brand that was formulated by General Foods Corporation food scientist William A. Mitchell and chemist William Bruce James in 1957, and first marketed in powdered form in 1959. The Tang brand is currently owned in most countries by Mondelēz International, a North American company spun off from Kraft Foods in 2012. Kraft Heinz owns the Tang brand in North America.

Sales of Tang were poor until NASA used it on John Glenn&#x27;s Mercury flight in February 1962, and on subsequent Gemini missions. Since then it has been closely associated with the U.S. human spaceflight program, which created the misconception that Tang was invented for the space program. Tang continues to be used on NASA missions in the present day, over 50 years after its introduction.

==History==
General Foods Corporation food scientist William A. Mitchell and chemist William Bruce James formulated and trademarked orange Tang in 1957. Tang entered test markets in 1958 and was available to the public beginning in 1959.

Tang was used by early NASA crewed space flights. In 1962, when Mercury astronaut John Glenn conducted eating experiments in orbit, Tang was selected for the menu; it was also used during some Gemini flights, and has also been carried aboard numerous space shuttle missions. Although many soda companies sent specially designed canned drinks into space with the crew of STS-51-F, the crew preferred to use Tang, as it could be mixed into existing water containers easily. In 2013, former NASA astronaut Buzz Aldrin said &quot;Tang sucks&quot;. In his autobiography, &quot;Return to Earth&quot;, published forty years earlier, Aldrin had further clarified: &quot;I can&#x27;t speak for the other flights, but before ours [Apollo 11], the three of us dutifully sampled the orange drink, supposedly Tang, and instead chose a grapefruit-orange mixture as our citrus drink. If Tang was on our flight I was unaware of it.&quot;

The creator of Tang, William A. Mitchell, also invented Pop Rocks, Cool Whip, a form of instant-set Jell-O, and other convenience foods. Chemist William Bruce James also invented several Jell-O flavors.

Orange Tang was packaged in glass jars with a metallic green label and orange metal lid. It was promoted as an &quot;instant breakfast&quot; drink rather than a soft drink mix, because it was fortified with vitamins C and A. In print and television advertising Tang was referred to as the nutritious &quot;space age&quot; drink of the astronauts.

Tang&#x27;s advertising in the 1990s and early 2000s featured an orangutan as a mascot.

==Nutritional facts==
Tang is sold in powdered and liquid-concentrate form. The suggested serving size is 2 tablespoons, or 31 grams of powdered Original Orange flavored Tang per of water. A single suggested serving of Tang contains of sugar (representing 94% of the product&#x27;s dry weight); 10% RDA of carbohydrates; 100% RDA of vitamin E; 100% RDA of vitamin C; 6% RDA of calcium and has a total of 120 calories (500 kJ).

==Other versions==
In 1961 General Foods introduced grapefruit flavored Tang and advertised it in &quot;Time Life&quot; magazine. It was referred to as a new, natural-tasting Tang flavor. Packaging was a glass jar with yellow label and green metal lid. In 1971 the packaging was updated with an orange metallic label.

In 1971 General Foods introduced a grape flavor of Tang and advertised it in the &quot;New York Times Weekly Magazine&quot; July 18, 1971. It appeared on store shelves, first with a metallic blue label and blue metal lid, subsequently with a metallic purple label and purple metal lid. While orange Tang could be purchased in various sizes including a large net weight 27 oz. glass jar, the grape flavor was only available in an 18 oz. size.

In 2007, Kraft introduced a new version of orange Tang which replaced half of the sugar with artificial sweeteners. The new packaging advertises &quot;1/2 the sugar of 100% juice&quot;. The artificial sweeteners used in the new formulation are sucralose, acesulfame potassium and neotame. The new formula is more concentrated and distributed in smaller containers, with a () making .

According to the preparation instructions on the 20 fl oz (590 ml) Tang orange drink mix, 2 level tablespoons of Tang can be combined with 1 cup or 8 fl oz (240 ml) of cold water for 1 serving.

In 2009, another version of Tang emerged in containers making only .

Orange flavored Tang contributes to most current sales worldwide; however, there are a wide range of flavors of Tang offered globally, including grape, lemon, mango, and pineapple.

== Sales ==
Tang is sold in more than 30 countries and is available in a variety of flavors depending on location. The top three markets for Tang around the world are Brazil, Argentina, and the Philippines.

In the Middle East, more than half of Tang&#x27;s annual sales occur in just six weeks around Ramadan.

In June 2011, Kraft Foods announced that Tang has become its twelfth billion-dollar brand, with global sales nearly doubling since 2006. The brand in 2010 controlled a category-best 15.6% of the international powder concentrate market although, like other highly processed or sweetened beverages, demand in developed economies has stagnated or fallen in line with consumers increasing preference for lower calorie drinks. In 2018, Tang&#x27;s manufacturer Mondelez reported a drop in sales following the introduction of tax on calorific sweetened beverages in the Philippines.

<text>ABS-CBN Corporation is a Filipino media company based in Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines. It is the largest entertainment television and film production, program syndication provider, film distributor and media conglomerate in the Philippines. It is a subsidiary of Lopez Holdings Corporation, which is owned by the López family. ABS-CBN was formed by the merger of Alto Broadcasting System (ABS) and Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN). The conglomerate is metonymically called as &quot;Ignacia&quot; due to the location of its headquarters ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center along Mother Ignacia Street in Quezon City.

ABS was founded in 1946 by American electronics engineer James Lindenberg as Bolinao Electronics Corporation (BEC). In 1952, BEC was renamed Alto Broadcasting System (ABS) with its corporate name, Alto Sales Corporation after Judge Antonio Quirino, brother of President Elpidio Quirino, purchased the company and later launched the first TV station in the country, DZAQ-TV on October 23, 1953. The company that would later be merged with ABS to form ABS-CBN was founded in 1956 as Chronicle Broadcasting Network, Inc. (CBN) by Eugenio Lopez Sr. and his brother Fernando Lopez, who was the sitting Vice President of the Philippines. A year later, the Lopezes acquired ABS. The ABS-CBN brand was first used on television in 1961. 

The conglomerate became known as ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation on February 1, 1967. It then changed its corporate name to ABS-CBN Corporation in August 2007 where it dropped the word &quot;Broadcasting&quot; on primary uses, to signify its diversification. Due to the change in the conglomerate&#x27;s name, the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation name is now used as the company&#x27;s alternative and secondary name in certain contexts. The common shares of ABS-CBN were first traded on the Philippine Stock Exchange in July 1992 under the ticker symbol ABS.

Due to being denied for another 25-year free-to-air broadcasting franchise by the Philippine Congress, the conglomerate now mainly focuses on working as a content company, which includes producing television programs, films and other entertainment contents and distributions.

==History==

The company was founded on July 11, 1946, as Bolinao Electronics Corporation (BEC). BEC was established by James Lindenberg, one of the founding fathers of Philippine television, an American electronics engineer who went into radio equipment assembly and radio broadcasting. In 1949, Lindenberg shifted Bolinao to radio broadcasting with DZBC and masterminded the introduction of television to the country in 1953.

In 1951, Lindenberg partnered with Antonio Quirino, brother of then-Philippine President Elpidio Quirino, in order to try their hand at television broadcasting. In 1952, BEC was renamed as Alto Broadcasting System or ABS (with Alto Sales Corporation as its corporate name). &quot;Alto&quot; was a contraction of Quirino&#x27;s and his wife&#x27;s first names, Tony and Aleli, and is Spanish for &quot;tall&quot;. Though they had little money and resources, ABS was able to put up its TV tower by July 1953 and import some 300 television sets. The initial test broadcasts began in September of the same year. The first full-blown broadcast was on October 23, 1953, of a party in Tony Quirino&#x27;s humble abode. The television station was known as DZAQ-TV.

On June 16, 1955, Republic Act No. 1343 signed by President Ramon Magsaysay granted the &quot;Manila Chronicle&quot; its broadcasting franchise, leading to the formation of the Chronicle Broadcasting Network.

The Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN) was founded on September 24, 1956, by Eugenio Lopez Sr. and the then-Philippine Vice President Fernando Lopez. The network initially focused only on radio broadcasting. It launched its very own TV station, DZXL-TV 9, on April 19 (or July), 1958. On February 24, 1957, Don Eugenio acquired ABS from Quirino and Lindenberg. A month later, Don Eugenio also acquired Monserrat Broadcasting System. 

In 1958, the network&#x27;s new headquarters at Dewey Boulevard was inaugurated, and all radio and television operations were consolidated into its two buildings – the radio stations at the Chronicle Building at Aduana Street, Intramuros, Manila and the TV operations at the brand new Dewey Boulevard building in Pasay, Rizal.

The ABS-CBN brand was first used in 1961. However, it was only on February 1, 1967, that the corporate name was changed to ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation. Before it was named ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation, the corporate name was Bolinao Electronics Corporation (BEC).

In August 2007, the conglomerate&#x27;s and network&#x27;s corporate name were changed to simply ABS-CBN Corporation to reflect its diversification. According to the conglomerate&#x27;s chairman Gabby Lopez during its annual stockholders&#x27; meeting three years later in May 27, 2010, the name change was &quot;a response to the changes in the media landscape brought about by technology. The media business has gone beyond merely broadcasting to encompass other platforms.&quot;

<text>Edwin Augustus Stevens (July 28, 1795 – August 7, 1868) was an American engineer, inventor, and entrepreneur who left a bequest that was used to establish the Stevens Institute of Technology.
==Life==
Stevens was born at Castle Point, Hoboken, New Jersey, the son of Colonel John Stevens III (1749–1838) and his wife Rachel (née Cox) Stevens (1761–1839). He was the sixth of eleven children, and among his older brothers were John Cox Stevens and Robert Livingston Stevens.

==Career==
At an early age Stevens was entrusted by his father with the family business affairs, and in 1821 at the age of 26 he assumed full responsibility for the Stevens estate in Hoboken and other properties. Also in 1821, he developed the &quot;Jeef Beef,&quot; a cast-iron plow with a curved moldboard and replaceable heel piece. The plow was popular among New Jersey farmers. He went on to design many other technological innovations, such as the “twohorse dump wagon” for New York City; the &quot;closed fireroom” system of forced draft for his family&#x27;s steamboat fleet; and the &quot;vestibule car&quot; for the Camden and Amboy Railroad.

Following the death of Colonel Stevens in 1838, Edwin and his brother Robert worked on a commission from the United States government to construct the nation&#x27;s first ironclad naval vessel. After conducting tests to determine the amount of armor a vessel needed to defend itself against naval guns, the two brothers constructed a huge vessel known as the Stevens Battery. Though the craft was never fully completed, it nevertheless laid the groundwork for the modern armored warship. A scaled-down version, the USRC &quot;Naugatuck&quot;, saw limited action in the Civil War. After the war, the Naugatuck and the Battery were sold for scrap.

Stevens was part of the syndicate from the New York Yacht Club that built and raced the schooner-yacht &quot;America&quot;. His brother, John Cox Stevens, was the head of the syndicate and the NYYC&#x27;s first Commodore. Edwin Augustus also served as Commodore of the NYYC, resigning in 1866.

==Personal life==
In 1836, he married Mary Barton Picton (1806–1842), daughter of Rev. Thomas Picton of Princeton, New Jersey. Together, they had a daughter:

* Mary Picton Stevens (1840–1903), who married Virginia politician Muscoe Russell Hunter Garnett (1821–1864). After his death, she married Edward Parke Custis Lewis (1837–1892), U.S. Minister to Portugal.

In 1854, after his first wife&#x27;s death, Stevens married Martha Bayard Dod (1831–1899), the daughter of Albert Baldwin Dod, a professor of mathematics at Princeton University, and Caroline Smith (née Bayard) Dod, who was the daughter of Samuel Bayard and granddaughter of Continental Congressman John Bubenheim Bayard. With Martha he had seven children:

* John Stevens IV (1856-1895), father of Mary Picton Stevens Hammond, who perished in the sinking of the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot;. and grandfather of Millicent Fenwick
* Edwin Augustus Stevens, Jr. (1858–1918), who married Emily Contee Lewis (1857–1931), the great-granddaughter of Lawrence Lewis, George Washington&#x27;s nephew, and Eleanor Parke Custis Lewis, Washington&#x27;s adopted daughter and step-granddaughter.
* Caroline Bayard Stevens (1859-1932), who married Archibald Alexander and then H. Otto Wittpenn
* Julia Augusta Stevens (1863-1870)
* Robert Livingston Stevens II (1864-1907), who married Mary Stuart Whitney, great-grand daughter of Stephen Whitney. They were the parents of Robert Livingston Stevens (1907-1972) who was the second husband of Grace Vanderbilt, daughter of Cornelius III and Grace Graham Vanderbilt.
* Charles Albert Stevens (1865-1901)
* Richard Stevens (1868–1919), a Columbia College and Columbia Law School graduate who served as president of the Hoboken Land and Improvement Company.

Stevens died in Paris, France on August 7, 1868.

===Legacy===
In Stevens&#x27;s will, he left the bulk of his fortune to his wife and children, but also donated land adjoining the Stevens family estate, as well as $150,000 for the erection of a building and $500,000 as an endowment for the establishment of an &quot;institution of learning&quot;. Because of the Stevens family&#x27;s close ties with engineering, the will&#x27;s executors decided it would be an institution devoted to the &quot;mechanical arts&quot;. This institution became Stevens Institute of Technology, which opened its doors in 1870.

The university has since expanded to an entire hilltop campus overlooking Manhattan, and the original building funded by Stevens&#x27;s bequest, which was renamed Edwin A. Stevens Hall, continues to house much of the School of Engineering, the oldest of the university&#x27;s four schools.

<doc id="864274" wikidata="Q2055205" url="?curid=864274" title="Cold case">
<text>A cold case is a crime, or a suspected crime, that has not yet been fully resolved and is not the subject of a current criminal investigation, but for which new information could emerge from new witness testimony, re-examined archives, new or retained material evidence, or fresh activities of a suspect. New technological methods developed after the crime was committed can be used on the surviving evidence for analysis often with conclusive results.

==Characteristics==
===Violent or major crime===
Typically, cold cases are violent and other major felony crimes, such as murder and rape, which—unlike unsolved minor crimes—are generally not subject to a statute of limitations. Sometimes disappearances can also be considered cold cases if the victim has not been seen or heard from for some time, such as the case of Natalee Holloway or the Beaumont children.

The rate of cold cases being solved are slowly declining, soon less than 30% will be solved per year. About 35% of those cases are not cold cases at all. Some cases become instantly cold when a seeming closed (solved) case is re-opened due to the discovery of new evidence pointing away from the original suspect(s). Other cases are cold when the crime is discovered well after the fact—for example, by the discovery of human remains. Some cases become classified cold cases when a case that had been originally ruled an accident or suicide is re-designated as murder when new evidence emerges.

The John Christie murders is a notable case when Timothy Evans was wrongly executed for the alleged murders of his wife and child. Many other bodies were later found in the house where they lived with Christie, and he was then executed for the crimes. The case helped a campaign against capital punishment in Britain.

===Identifying a suspect===
A case is considered unsolved until a suspect has been identified, charged, and tried for the crime. A case that goes to trial and does not result in a conviction can also be kept on the books pending new evidence. In some cases, a suspect, often called a &quot;person of interest&quot; or &quot;subject&quot; is identified early on but no evidence definitively linking the subject to the crime is found at that time and more often than not the subject is not forthcoming with a confession. This often happens in cases where the subject has an alibi, alibi witnesses, or lack of forensic evidence. Eventually, the alibi is disproved, the witnesses recanted their statements or advances in forensics helped bring the subjects to justice. Sometimes a case is not solved but forensic evidence helps to determine that the crimes are serial crimes. The BTK case and Original Night Stalker cases are such examples. The Texas Rangers have established a website in the hopes that it shall elicit new information and investigative leads.

===Tunnel vision===
Sometimes, a viable suspect has been overlooked or simply ignored due to then-flimsy circumstantial evidence, the presence of a likelier suspect (who is later proven to be innocent), or a tendency of investigators to zero in on someone else to the exclusion of other possibilities (which goes back to the likelier suspect angle)—known as &quot;tunnel vision&quot;.
===Improvements in forensics===
With the advent of and improvements to DNA testing/DNA profiling and other forensics technology, many cold cases are being re-opened and prosecuted. Police departments are opening cold case units whose job is to re-examine cold case files. DNA evidence helps in such cases but as in the case of fingerprints, it is of no value unless there is evidence on file to compare it to. However, to combat that issue, the FBI is switching from using the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) to using a newer technology called the Next Generation Identification (NGI). Other improvements in forensics lie in fields such as:

* Digital Forensics one application of which is to recover hidden or deleted data.
* Ballistics Analysis which involves the evaluation of ammunition and firearms to determine which weapon might have been used in a crime.
* Forensic Anthropology which analyzes skeletal remains to determine their cause of death or any other relevant information.
* Mobile Forensics and Social Media which, since their creation, have had increased involvement in any police case cold or not.
* Forensic Psychology which can be used to analyze crime scenes and identify suspect profiles.
* Facial Recognition which has been used to identify suspects based on their facial features.
* Artificial Intelligence (AI) which is used in all of the above systems to help analyze data and information from crime scenes.

==Famous criminal examples==

The identity of Jack the Ripper is a notorious example of an outstanding cold case, with numerous suggestions as to the identity of the serial killer. Similarly, the Zodiac Killer has been studied extensively for almost 50 years, with numerous suspects discussed and debated. The perpetrators of the Wall Street bombing of 1920 have never been positively identified, though the Galleanists, a group of Italian anarchists, are widely believed to have planned the explosion. The burning of the Reichstag building in 1933 remains controversial and although Marinus van der Lubbe was tried, convicted and executed for arson, it is possible that the Reichstag fire was perpetrated by the Nazis to enhance their power and destroy democracy in Germany.

<doc id="864281" wikidata="Q618616" url="?curid=864281" title="George Bancroft (actor)">
<text>George Bancroft (September 30, 1882 – October 2, 1956) was an American 
film actor, whose career spanned seventeen years from 1925 to 1942. A star of pre-Code Hollywood, he is best known as the tough guy lead in four Josef von Sternberg films, the last of which, &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; (1929) earned him a Best Actor Award nomination. He was later a supporting actor in a number of notable movies, including &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot; (1936) and &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1939).

==Early years==

Bancroft was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1882. He attended Tomes Institute in Port Deposit, Maryland.

==Maritime work==
After working on merchant marine vessels at age 14, Bancroft was an apprentice on and later served on and &quot;West Indies&quot;. Additionally, during the Battle of Manila Bay (1898), he was a gunner on . During his days in the Navy, he staged plays aboard ship.

In 1900, he swam underneath the hull of the battleship to check the extent of the damage after it struck a rock off the coast of China. For this, he was appointed to the United States Naval Academy, but found it too restrictive for his tastes and left to pursue a theatrical career.

== Acting career ==
In 1901, Bancroft began acting in earnest, as he toured in plays and had juvenile leads in musical comedies. In vaudeville, he did blackface routines and impersonated celebrities. His Broadway credits include the musical comedies &quot;Cinders&quot; (1923) and &quot;The Rise of Rosie O&#x27;Reilly&quot; (1923).

One of his early films was &quot;The Journey&#x27;s End&quot; (1921). Bancroft&#x27;s first starring role was in &quot;The Pony Express&quot; (1925), and the next year he played an important supporting role in a cast including Wallace Beery, Charles Farrell and Esther Ralston in the period naval widescreen epic &quot;Old Ironsides&quot; (1926). He then had his finest period as a lead actor, starring in four Paramount productions directed by Josef von Sternberg: &quot;Underworld&quot; (1927), &quot;The Drag Net&quot; (1928), &quot;The Docks of New York&quot; (1928) and &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; (1929); the latter earning him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. He played the title role in &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot; (1929, released just prior to the Wall Street Crash), appeared in Paramount&#x27;s all-star revue &quot;Paramount on Parade&quot; (1930) and starred in Rowland Brown&#x27;s &quot;Blood Money&quot; (1933), condemned by the censors because they feared the film would &quot;incite law-abiding citizens to crime.&quot; 

Reportedly, he refused to fall down on set after a prop revolver was fired at him, saying &quot;Just &quot;one&quot; bullet can&#x27;t stop Bancroft!&quot;. 

Bancroft enjoyed his career height in the late 1920s, his thirties&#x27; films where he was the leading man, didn&#x27;t quite have the same impact and by 1936 he had slipped to being a supporting actor; although he still appeared in such classics as &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot; (1936) with Gary Cooper, &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; (1938) with James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart, &quot;Each Dawn I Die&quot; (1939) with Cagney and George Raft, and &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1939) with John Wayne and Thomas Mitchell. In 1942, he left Hollywood to be a full-time rancher.

== Personal life ==
Bancroft first married actress Edna Brothers. Three years later, he married musical comedy star Octavia Broske. In 1934, Brothers sued him, claiming they had never divorced. Two years later, the case was settled, and Brothers obtained a divorce.

== Death ==
On October 2, 1956, Bancroft died in Santa Monica, California, at age 74. He was interred there in the Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery.

<text>Hargeisa ( ; ; ) is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Somaliland, a &quot;de facto&quot; sovereign state in the Horn of Africa, still considered internationally to be part of Somalia. It is also the regional capital of the Maroodi Jeex region of Somaliland.

Hargeisa was founded as a watering and trading stop between the coast and the interior by the Isaaq Sultanate. Initially it served as a watering well for the vast livestock of the Isaaq clan that inhabited that specific region and later were joined by other Isaaq clans that currently inhabit Hargeisa. In 1960, the Somaliland Protectorate gained independence from the United Kingdom and as scheduled united days later with the Trust Territory of Somaliland (former Italian Somaliland) to form the Somali Republic on 1 July. Up to 90% of the city was destroyed during the Isaaq genocide, a state-sponsored campaign of violence during the Somaliland War of Independence.

Hargeisa is situated in a valley in the Galgodon (Ogo) highlands, and sits at an elevation of . Home to rock art from the Neolithic period, the city is also a commercial hub for precious stone-cutting, construction, retail services and trading, among other activities.

==Etymology==
The town evolved in the latter half of the 1800s as a Qadiriyya settlement established by Sheikh Madar, near a water-stop used by nomadic stock-herders on the way to the town of Harar. It proposes a possible derivation of the name &quot;Hargeisa&quot; from the sobriquet &quot;Harar as-sagir&quot;, meaning &quot;Harar the little&quot; According to historian Norman Bennett, Madar named the settlement Hargeisa or &quot;Little Harar&quot; since he aspired for it to emulate the city of Harar as a center for Islamic teachings. Another etymological root for Hargeisa&#x27;s name derives from the towns connection to the skins trade. Hargeisa has been a watering and trading stop between the coast and the interior, and chief amongst the goods traded were the hide skins procured from the interior to be processed in the settlement. In this etymological version, &#x27;Hargeisa&#x27; is derived from &quot;hargageys&quot;, which means &quot;place to sell hides and skins&quot; in Somali.

==History==
===Prehistory===

Numerous cave paintings from the Neolithic period are found in the Laas Geel complex, on the outskirts of Hargeisa. During November and December 2002, an archaeological survey was carried out in the area by a French team of researchers. The expedition&#x27;s objective was to search for rock shelters and caves containing stratified archaeological infills capable of documenting the period when production economy appeared in this part of Somaliland ( and 2nd millennium BCE). During the course of the survey, the French archaeological team discovered the Laas Geel rock art, encompassing an area of ten rock alcoves (caves). In an excellent state of preservation, the paintings show human figures with their hands raised and facing long-horned, humpless cattle.

The rock art had been known to the area&#x27;s inhabitants for centuries before the French discovery. However, the existence of the site had not been broadcast to the international community. In November 2003, a mission returned to Laas Geel and a team of experts undertook a detailed study of the paintings and their prehistoric context.

Somaliland generally is home to numerous such archaeological sites, with similar rock art and/or ancient edifices such as the Dhambalin rock art. However, many of these old structures have yet to be properly explored, a process which would help shed further light on local history and facilitate their preservation for posterity.

===The Big Commune &amp; Sheikh Madar===

According to traditional poetic (gabay) oral accounts, Hargeisa was founded by the Arap as a watering and trading stop for passing nomads and caravans. It is believed that and the Habar Yoonis and the Eidagale subtribes were amongst the early settlers of Hargeisa. Hargeisa continued to grow with the arrival of Sheikh Madar Shirwa, widely considered to be the founder of Hargeisa religious commune and the modern iteration of the settlement.
Madar Shirwa was born in Berbera and belonged to the Nuh Ismail subdivision of the Sa&#x27;ad Musa Habr Awal. Madar arrived in Harar to study the Islamic Sciences under the top ulema of Harar, which consisted of Harari and Somali scholars. Sheikh Khalil, one of the ulema of Harar, advised Sheikh Madar to establish a Qadiriyya tariqa commune in present-day Hargeisa and spread the teachings he was taught, which lead Sheikh Madar and his companions to found the Big Commune (Jama&#x27;a weyne) of Little Harar (Hargeisa) in . Somali pastoralists heavily follow rain and pastures this would change with the agricultural and stationary lifestyle Madar would introduce on the back of large sorghum plantations. This was to maintain self-sufficiency and Sheikh Madar and the other Mullahs would take care of the sick and elderly inhabitants of the growing settlement. Lastly, Sheikh Madar pushed towards a common religious identity rather than identifying solely by tribe. Stone houses and other structures would be built and Hargeisa would develop into a large permanent settlement irrespective of the caravan trade that defined it in decades prior. Sheikh Madar met with the 4th Isaaq Grand Sultan Deria Hassan outside Hargeisa in a famous 1870 &quot;shir&quot; (meeting) to discuss issues regarding the new town of Hargeisa and agreed that poaching and tree cutting in the vicinity should be banned.

H. Swayne, a British soldier and explorer who traversed the Somali peninsula between the 1880-1890s wrote about Hargeisa in his journals:

This town is built some five hundred yards from the right bank of the Aleyadera nala, and at an elevation of thirty or forty feet above it. Round the place is a patch of jowari (sorghum) cultivation, two and a half miles long and a quarter of a mile broad. Quantities of livestock of all kinds graze on the low undulating hills for half a mile from the Aleyadera nala on either bank. Hargeisa is situated on two important caravan routes, one from Ogaden and the other from Harar. There are good direct camel-roads to Berbera and Bulhar. Supplies of rice, tobacco, and dates can sometimes be bought here in the trading season. Some four hundred people are employed looking after the jowari fields, and may be seen sitting on platforms, shouting and throwing stones to scare birds from the crops. There is abundance of good water in the bed of the river, and a masonry well has been built, and is kept in order by an Arab from Aden. The town is full of blind and lame people, who are under the protection of Sheikh Mattar and his mullahs.

===British Somaliland===

In 1888, after signing successive treaties with the then ruling Somali Sultans and chiefs, the British established a protectorate in the region referred to as British Somaliland with Berbera becoming the capital. The British garrisoned the protectorate from Aden in present-day Yemen, and administered it from their British India until 1898. British Somaliland was then administered by the Foreign Office until 1905 and afterwards by the Colonial Office.

The capital was moved from Berbera to Hargeisa, and the city was granted capital status in 1941. During the East African Campaign, the protectorate was invaded by Italy in August 1940, but recaptured by the British in March 1941. In 1945 the British administration had grown weary of the influence &quot;wadaads&quot; had wielded in the protectorate and moved to arrest several in Hargeisa. They had been deemed nuisances to implementing &#x27;modern education&#x27; and agricultural reforms in Somaliland. Following their arrests on June 4, a mob formed and temporarily freed the imprisoned &quot;wadaads&quot; who were recaptured the next day. Religious leaders motivated the city&#x27;s inhabitants and a crowd of several thousand rioters marched on the Hargeisa District Headquarters determined to free the imprisoned &quot;wadaads&quot;. They were fired upon by the District Commissioner&#x27;s troops with one dying and dozens imprisoned for trying to free the Sheikhs.

The protectorate gained its independence on 26 June 1960 as the State of Somaliland, before uniting as planned days later with the Trust Territory of Somaliland (the former Italian Somaliland) to form the Somali Republic.

===1960–1991===
In the post-independence period, Hargeisa was administered as the capital of the Woqooyi Galbeed province of Somalia. Numerous new development projects were subsequently launched in the city by the Somali government. Among these initiatives was the creation of the Hargeisa Provincial Museum. It was the first museum to be established in Somalia since independence in 1960. The Hargeisa International Airport was also renovated and modernized, with the ultimate aim of equipping the facility to accommodate larger aircraft and offer more flight destinations.

==== SNM offensive ====

On 31 May 1988, at 2:15 a.m, the Somali National Movement (shortened SNM) attacked Hargeisa. With two Habar yunis leaders, one in Burco and the other in the capital city Hargeisa. The SNM force attacking Hargeisa was estimated at 500 men equipped with 84 vehicles, of whom only 14 were left due to vehicles being sent to the front in Adadley. The SNM captured the headquarters of the 26th Division, as well as capturing the Birjeex arms depot where the SNM collected ammunition. An SNM fighter who partook in the Hargeisa offensive described Somali troops dropping their uniforms on the ground and fleeing. The SNM encountered stiff resistance from the Somali Army as they surrounded Radio Hargeisa&#x27;s headquarters. Due to heavy bombardment from Somali heavy artillery and tanks, the SNM force tasked with capturing Hargeisa airport fell back and retreated to Adadley.

By 1 June, with the exception of Hargeisa Airport, the SNM overran the city. During the Somali army counterattack the SNM line of defense in the city was behind Hargeisa&#x27;s radio station.

====Hargeisa campaign====

Dictator Siad Barre&#x27;s response to the SNM attacks was of unparalleled brutality; with explicit aims of handling the &quot;Isaaq problem&quot;, he ordered &quot;the shelling and aerial bombardment of the major cities in the northwest and the systematic destruction of Isaaq dwellings, settlements and water points. In one of the most brutal episodes of the Isaaq genocide, the regime targeted civilian members of the Isaaq group specifically, especially in the cities of Hargeisa and Burco and to that end employed the use of indiscriminate artillery shelling and aerial bombardment against civilian populations belonging to the Isaaq ethnic group. Up to 90% of the city was destroyed.

===Reconstruction===
After the collapse of the Somali central government and the unilateral declaration of independence of the Republic of Somaliland, a slow process of infrastructural reconstruction subsequently began in Hargeisa and other towns in the country.

Since 1991, Hargeisa has undergone a large-scale facelift. The renovations have been largely financed by local entrepreneurs, as well as Somali expatriates sending remittance funds to relatives in the region through some of the various Somali-owned money transfer operators. Most of the destroyed residential and commercial buildings have since been reconstructed, with many newer structures erected. Single-storey buildings downtown are also progressively giving way to multi-storey high-rises.

== Climate ==
Hargeisa has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSh&quot;). The city generally features very warm winters and hot summers. However, despite its location in the tropics, due to the high altitude Hargeisa seldom experiences either very hot or very cold weather, a trait rarely seen in semi-arid climates. The city receives the bulk of its rain between the months of April and September, averaging just over of rainfall annually. Average monthly temperatures in Hargeisa range from in the months of December and January to in the month of June.

==Administration==

Situated in the Maroodi Jeh region of Somaliland, Hargeisa is the seat of the Somaliland&#x27;s Parliament, the presidential palace, and government ministries.

The first mayor of Hargeisa in 1960 was Aadan Cumar fure, who held the position from 1950 to 1959. The current municipal administration is led by Abdikarim Ahmed Mooge. A member of the Waddani party, he was elected the Mayor during the 2021 Somaliland municipal elections.

== Districts ==
According to a more recent December 2017 report from the Social Research and Development Institute (SORADI) based in Hargeisa, the city divided into eight sub-districts; being the 31 May, 26 June, Ahmed Dhagah, Ahmed Moallim Haruun, Gacan Libaax, Ibrahim Kodbuur, Mohamoud Haibe, and Mohamed Moge Districts. This information is contradictory to an April 2003 report by the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), which states only five sub-districts exist: being the 26 June, Ahmed Dhagah, Gacan Libaax, Ibrahim Kodbuur, and Mohamoud Haibe sub-districts, each having between four and six sub-sections of their own. Presumably a redistricting occurred sometime between 2004 and 2017.

Each sub-district has their own elected council members, whose responsibility is to represent their district and fulfil their populations needs. To increase the effectiveness of these sub-districts, especially underrepresented ones such as Gacan Libaax, a so-called &quot;accountability forum&quot; has been established to discuss and create policy to better represent marginalized communities.

== Demographics ==
Hargeisa has grown rapidly since the middle of the 20th century. According to I. M. Lewis, Hargeisa&#x27;s population was estimated to be 30,000 in 1958. In 2005, the UNDP said that the city had a population of 560,028. According to CIA factbook, Hargeisa had an estimated population of around 760,000 as of 2015. The main residents of Hargeisa are the Sa&#x27;ad Musa subclan of the Habr Awal, the Eidagale and Habar Yoonis subclans of the Habr Garhajis, the Arap, and the Ayub, all of which are subdivisions of the larger Isaaq clan. As of 2019, it is estimated that Hargeisa has a population of 1.2 million The urban area occupies , with a population density of .

==Economy==

Hargeisa is the financial hub to many entrepreneurial industries ranging from finance, retail, imports/export warehouses to gem cutters, construction, food processing, textiles and livestock trading. 

In June 2012, the Partnership Fund for the private sector in Somaliland was launched at Hargeisa&#x27;s Ambassador Hotel. Part of the larger Partnership for Economic Growth program, the initiative will see $900,000 USD allocated to 13 private local businesses, as well as the creation of 250 new full-time jobs, half of which are to be earmarked for youth and one third for women. The fund is expected to improve job opportunities for 1,300 entrepreneurs through ameliorated product distribution and investment in new technologies and processing facilities. Eligibility is determined through a competitive and transparent selection process overseen by the Partnership program, the Somaliland Chamber of Commerce, and government officials.

==Transportation==

Buses are the most commonly used form of public transportation in Hargeisa. They travel on a number of routes serving nearly all of the city&#x27;s districts. Intercity bus services are also available, which connect Hargeisa to other major cities and towns across Somaliland, including Burao, Berbera and Borama.

With the growth of urban development, several new taxi companies have sprung up in Hargeisa.

Hargeisa Taxi is another of the recent taxi firms based in Hargeisa. It has a fleet of four small compact cars and seven passenger minivans, in addition to around 19 other vehicles. GPS devices installed by the Sahal Technology firm allow the cab company&#x27;s dispatch office to monitor its taxis to ensure that they travel within the speed limit. The office can also disable the vehicles online in the event of theft. Other new taxi firms serving Hargeisa include Dalhis Taxi and Marodi Jeh Taxi. Fares are inexpensive, costing between 15,000 and 18,000 Somaliland shillings ($2–$3 USD) per ride, the US dollar is also widely accepted alongside the local currency.

===International Airport===
For air transportation, the city is served by the Hargeisa International Airport. The Somali-owned private carriers Daallo Airlines and Jubba Airways offer flights to various other towns in neighbouring Somalia, such as Mogadishu, Bosaso and Galkayo. Trips to international destinations are also available, including to Djibouti and Dubai. It has recently gained more airlines such as Ethiopian Airlines and flydubai. However, both airlines have listed the city as being in Somalia since August 2024, following an ultimatum from the Somali government, which would have otherwise seen them prohibited from using Somali airspace.

==Education==

Various primary schools and nurseries are located in Hargeisa. There are several state-run and privately owned secondary and high schools in the city. Among these are the SOS Sheikh Secondary School, Abaarso School of Science and Technology, Hargeisa Technical School, Salaama Secondary School, and Smart Secondary School, the latter of which is the pre-eminent secondary institution in the area, about west of Hargeisa.

The city is home to a number of colleges and universities including the University of Hargeisa, Admas University College, Somaliland University of Technology, Gollis University, New Generation University, Hope University and Marodijeh International University. The Edna Adan Maternity Hospital offers nursing programmes to students. The Institute for Practical Research and Training specializes in (applied) research and training.

<doc id="864288" wikidata="Q8019436" url="?curid=864288" title="William Tite">
<text>Sir William Tite (7 February 179820 April 1873) was an English architect who twice served as President of the Royal Institute of British Architects. He was particularly associated with various London buildings, with railway stations and cemetery projects. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Bath from 1855 until his death.

==Early life and career==
Tite was born in the parish of St Bartholomew the Great in the City of London, in February 1798, the son of a merchant in Russian goods named Arthur Tite.

He was articled to David Laing, architect of the new Custom House, and surveyor to the Parish of St Dunstan-in-the-East. Tite assisted Laing in the rebuilding of St Dunstan&#x27;s church: according to an article published in the &quot;Architect&quot; in 1869, Tite entirely designed the new building, Laing himself having no knowledge of Gothic architecture.

In 1827–8 Tite built the Scottish church in Regent Square, St Pancras, London, for Edward Irving, in a Gothic Revival style, partly inspired by York Minster, and ten years later collaborated with Charles Robert Cockerell in designing the London &amp; Westminster Bank head office in Lothbury, also in the city.

==Royal Exchange==

The rebuilding of the Royal Exchange, opened in 1844, was Tite&#x27;s greatest undertaking. The previous building was destroyed by fire in 1838, and a competition to design a replacement was held the following year. When this proved unproductive, a second limited competition was held between Tite, Charles Robert Cockerell, George Gwilt, Charles Barry and Robert Smirke. Tite&#x27;s winning design has an imposing eight-column entrance portico, inspired by the Pantheon in Rome, while the other sides of the building are based on Italian renaissance models.

==Railway stations==
Tite was the architect for the Eastern Counties, London and Blackwall, Gravesend and South Western Railways, and in France those between Paris and Rouen and Rouen and Le Havre; an article in the &quot;Architect&quot; named the station at Rouen, spanning nearly ninety feet, as an example of his structural skill. Tite designed many of the early railway stations in Britain, including:
*The termini of the London and South Western Railway at Vauxhall (Nine Elms), Southampton Terminus, Gosport and Windsor Riverside
*The termini of the London and Blackwall Railway at Minories and Blackwall (1840)
*Carnforth, Carlisle Citadel and Lancaster Castle railway stations (1846–1847)
*The majority of the stations on the Caledonian and Scottish Central railways, including Edinburgh (1847–1848) (not built) and Perth (1847–1848)
*Barnes, Barnes Bridge, Chiswick and Kew Bridge railway stations (1849)
*Stations between Yeovil and Exeter, including Axminster and the now-demolished Honiton.

His station at Carlisle was built in a neo-Tudor style with a frontage of about 400 feet, broken into several masses. At the centre of the façade was an arcade of five arches, with buttresses and pinnacles. The refreshment rooms had &quot;an open timber roof, and oriels or bays, reminiscent of the dining-hall of olden times&quot;.

==Cemeteries==
As a company director of the South Metropolitan Cemetery Company he laid out his first cemetery at Norwood in 1836 and designed several significant monuments and chapels there. While previous cemetery designs had followed a classical style, Tite&#x27;s design was the first to employ the Gothic revival alongside landscaping, which was subsequently judged to be the archetype for future cemeteries.

Between 1853 and 1854, with Sydney Smirke, he landscaped Brookwood Cemetery near Woking in Surrey for the London Necropolis Company. 
Maintaining his associations with railways, this cemetery was served by a dedicated train service from London Necropolis railway station, next to Waterloo station, in central London.

Between 1858 and 1859 he built a memorial church in the Byzantine style at Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire.

==Later life==
Tite&#x27;s active work as an architect ceased about twenty years before his death (in recognition of his contributions, however, he was awarded the RIBA Royal Gold Medal in 1856).

In 1851 he visited Italy after a grave illness. In 1854 he stood for parliament, unsuccessfully contesting Barnstaple as a Liberal, but the following year he was returned as Member of Parliament for Bath, which he represented until his death. He keenly opposed Sir George Gilbert Scott&#x27;s proposal to build the new Foreign and Commonwealth Office and other government buildings adjacent to the Treasury in Whitehall in the Gothic style. He was knighted in 1869 and was made a Companion of the Bath the next year. Tite had a wide knowledge of English literature and was a good linguist and a lover of old books. He was an elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1835, and a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1839. He was President of the Camden Society and of the Royal Institute of British Architects.

He was a director of the London and Westminster Bank and Governor of the Bank of Egypt; in 1856 he was nominated a member of the Select Committee on the Bank Charter. He was a member of the Metropolitan Board of Works, a magistrate of Middlesex and Somerset and Deputy Lieutenant for London. He was also a Governor of St. Thomas&#x27;s Hospital, London, where he is commemorated by the William Tite Scholarship, for the best student in the first year, with the highest aggregate marks in Anatomy and Physiology. After over 125 years, this prize has been subsumed into King&#x27;s College London, where it is still awarded for excellence in the pre-clinical medical course.

He died on 20 April 1873 at Torquay and was interred in the catacombs of his South Metropolitan Cemetery. Tite Street, which runs north-west from London&#x27;s Chelsea Embankment, is named for him.

<doc id="864291" wikidata="Q332887" url="?curid=864291" title="Brendan Bracken">
<text>Brendan Rendall Bracken, 1st Viscount Bracken (15 February 1901 – 8 August 1958), was an Irish-born businessman, politician and a Minister of Information and First Lord of the Admiralty in Winston Churchill&#x27;s War Cabinet.

He is best remembered for supporting Churchill during his whole political career.

A noted publisher and editor, he was also the founder of the modern version of the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and of the monthly business magazine &quot;The Banker,&quot; as well as Managing Editor of &quot;The Economist.&quot;

He was Minister of Information from 1941 to 1945, managing the United Kingdom&#x27;s propaganda efforts against Nazi Germany during the War.

==Early life==
Brendan Rendall Bracken was born in Templemore, County Tipperary, Ireland, the second son and third of the four children of Joseph Kevin Bracken (1852–1904), builder and monumental mason, and his second wife, Hannah Agnes Ryan (1872–1928). His father had belonged to the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB).

Widowed in 1904, Hannah Bracken had moved her family (including two stepdaughters) by 1908 to Dublin, where Brendan attended St Patrick&#x27;s National School, Drumcondra, until 1910, when he was transferred to the O&#x27;Connell School, run by the Irish Christian Brothers. Distressed by his misbehaviour, his mother sent him in 1915 to Mungret College, a Jesuit boarding school in County Limerick, but he quickly bolted and ran up hotel bills. She then sent him to Australia to live with a cousin who was a priest in Echuca, Victoria. The young man led a nomadic existence in Australia, moving often but reading avidly, as an auto-didact.

In 1919, Bracken returned briefly to Ireland, finding his mother settled in County Meath. He distanced himself from Ireland as well as his siblings, who were in revolt over their father&#x27;s inheritance. He moved instead to settle in Liverpool.

In 1920, he appeared at Sedbergh School, claiming to be a 15-year-old and an Australian, to have been orphaned in a bush fire and to have a family connection to Montagu Rendell, the headmaster of Winchester College. Without fully believing the story, Sedbergh&#x27;s headmaster, impressed by the young Bracken&#x27;s depth of knowledge and eagerness to progress, accepted him. By the end of one term, his Irish republican heritage and his five formative years in Australia had blended with the elements and trappings of a British public school man.

He might have had good reason to hide his Irish heritage, as the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921) had aroused hostility toward Irish people living in Great Britain. For whatever reason, that denial became a regular feature of his life. Another example occurred in 1926, when he met Major-General Emmet Dalton, a former senior commander in the new Irish Army, in London.

The former British Army officer, turned IRA confidant, who was one of General Michael Collins&#x27;s right-hand men, recalled meeting Bracken at national school in Dublin. Bracken denied that, but Dalton insisted that he remembered the smell of Bracken&#x27;s corduroy trousers. A third example occurred during the Second World War, when Bracken told people that his brother had been killed in action at Narvik, but his brother was alive and well in Ireland and was importuning Brendan for money.

==Business and political career==
After Sedbergh, whose &quot;old boy&quot; tie he used to good effect, Bracken was briefly a schoolmaster at Bishop&#x27;s Stortford College. He moved to London, where he joined the League of Nations Union and made pro-imperialist speeches. He obtained a job at the &quot;Empire Review&quot;, where he got acquainted with J. L. Garvin, former editor of &quot;The Observer&quot;, who would introduce him to Winston Churchill in the summer of 1923.

He then made a successful career from 1922 as a magazine publisher and newspaper editor in London. His initial success was based on selling advertising space to at least cover the cost of each number. In the 1923 election, he assisted Winston Churchill&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to be elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Leicester West, which began their political association. He also assisted in Churchill&#x27;s 1924 Westminster Abbey by-election campaign. In the fighting that occurred on the streets, Bracken was stabbed.

He joined the publishing company Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode and, in 1925, became a director of the company.

In 1926, he was the founding editor of &quot;The Banker&quot;, and magazine and bankers still name their respected annual Bank of the Year awards &quot;Brackens&quot; in his honour. &quot;The Banker&quot; features a regular column called &quot;Bracken&quot;, focusing on providing views and perspectives on how to improve the global financial system. He edited the &quot;Financial News,&quot; and &quot;The Practitioner&quot; before being promoted to managing director of &quot;The Economist&quot; in 1928.

Many of his early magazine stories included a political flavour, and he commissioned articles from a wide range of politicians such as Churchill and Benito Mussolini. Business and politics permanently overlapped in his life, like that of the career of his occasional friend Lord Beaverbrook. He needed politicians for stories and they needed the publicity his publications gave. A supporter of Churchill from 1923, who was out of Parliament and in his political wilderness, Bracken was invited to join Churchill&#x27;s &quot;Other Club&quot;. Their lives changed from the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939.

Bracken himself was elected to the House of Commons in 1929 as a Unionist for the London constituency of North Paddington, which he won with just 528 votes. Stanley Baldwin described Bracken as Churchill&#x27;s &quot;faithful chela&quot;, &quot;chela&quot; being the Hindi word for disciple.

During Churchill&#x27;s &quot;Wilderness Years&quot;, Bracken would become his main support. From 1934 Brendan also supported Churchill&#x27;s calls for rearmament in Parliament. Later, when King George VI personally expressed his concern that an Irishman, son of an IRB man, should be appointed a Government Minister and member of the Privy Council. Churchill stood up for his protégé and wrote to the King: “He has sometimes been almost my sole supporter in the years when I have been striving to get this country properly defended”.

===Assists in selection of Churchill===
In two matters relating to Churchill, Bracken can be said to have played a key part behind the scenes. When Neville Chamberlain prepared to resign in May 1940, the candidates to succeed him were Churchill or Lord Halifax. The political issue at stake at the time was which potential successor would the Labour Party accept in the formation of a National Government. Churchill&#x27;s view was that the Labour Party would not support him and so agreed with Chamberlain to nominate Halifax.

When Bracken became aware of Churchill&#x27;s agreement to nominate Halifax, he convinced Churchill that the Labour Party would indeed support him as Chamberlain&#x27;s successor and Lord Halifax&#x27;s appointment would hand certain victory to Hitler.

Bracken advised Churchill tactically to say nothing when the three met to arrange the succession. After a deafening silence when Churchill was expected to nominate Halifax, the latter obligingly ruled himself out, and Churchill was put forward as Britain&#x27;s wartime Prime Minister, having avoided any appearance of disloyalty to Chamberlain.

===Support from the US 1940–1941===
When Churchill became Prime Minister in May 1940, Bracken helped in moving him into 10 Downing Street. Bracken was sworn into the Privy Council in 1940, despite his lack of ministerial experience, and became Churchill&#x27;s parliamentary private secretary.

An insight into the nature of the relationship between Churchill and Bracken is found in Churchill&#x27;s history of the Second World War. Churchill wrote that he had received telegrams from Washington about Harry Hopkins &quot;stating that he was the closest confidant and personal agent of the President. I therefore arranged that he should be met by Mr. Brendan Bracken on his arrival.&quot; The suggestion was that Churchill had arranged, as is diplomatic custom, for Hopkins to be met by the person who was his closest counterpart in British government and that Bracken often played the role of confidant and personal agent to Churchill. After Bracken met Hopkins&#x27;s flight on 9 January 1941, Churchill and Hopkins forged a close association. According to Charles Lysaght&#x27;s biography, Bracken and Hopkins had met in America in the late 1930s, and that personal tie helped speed the decision to assist Britain nearly a year before the US actually entered the war.

===Minister of Information===
In 1941, Bracken persuaded by Lord Beaverbrook and Churchill himself to become Britain&#x27;s wartime Minister for Information. At the same time, he was one of the heads of the Political Warfare Executive. He won over most of the proprietors by giving them more news, often on a confidential basis, and censorship was kept to a minimum. The BBC was also allowed a of freedom as long as it behaved according to the UK&#x27;s war interests.

He is said to have inspired George&#x27;s Orwell Big Brother Character in the novel 1984. Coincidentally, Orwell worked at the ministry under Bracken&#x27;s leadership. The initials B.B. coincide with those of Bracken.

==Postwar years==
In 1945, after the end of the wartime coalition, Bracken was briefly First Lord of the Admiralty in the Churchill caretaker ministry, but lost the post in the general election won by Clement Attlee&#x27;s Labour Party. Bracken lost his North Paddington seat but soon returned to the Commons, as Member of Parliament for Bournemouth in a November 1945 by-election. He was a relentless critic of the Labour government&#x27;s policy of nationalisation and the retreat from empire.

At the 1950 general election, he was returned for Bournemouth East and Christchurch, a seat he held until the general election the following year. His last speech in the House of Commons would take place on 5 July 1951 on the Hants and Dorset Bus Company Dispute.

In early 1952 he was elevated to the peerage as Viscount Bracken, of Christchurch in the County of Southampton, but never used the title or sat in the House of Lords, which he called &quot;the Morgue&quot;.

At that stage, he was also publishing &quot;The Economist&quot;. In 1951, with his love of history, he helped found &quot;History Today&quot; magazine.

From 1950 he was chairman of the board of governors of his former school, Sedbergh School, where he went frequently. He organised and financed the restoration of the eighteenth-century school building as a library, with a commemoratory inscription, &quot;Remember Winston Churchill&quot;, which still stands today.

From 1955 he was a trustee of the National Gallery.

==Death==
A heavy smoker, Bracken died of oesophageal cancer on 8 August 1958, aged 57, at the flat of his friend Sir Patrick Hennessy in Park Lane, in London. Although raised a Catholic, he refused the last rites of the Church despite efforts by his nephew, Rev Kevin Bracken, a Cistercian monk at Bethlehem Abbey, Portglenone, County Antrim, to persuade him. As he was unmarried, the viscountcy died with him.

Upon learning of his demise, Churchill reacted to the news of his death by saying &quot;Poor, dear Brendan.&quot; 

He was cremated without ceremony at Golders Green Crematorium in north London. By his own wishes, he was cremated and his ashes were scattered behind the Cinque Ports by his chauffeur, Alex Aley, at Romney Marshes of which &quot;his master, Winston Churchill was the then Lord Warden&quot;.

At the time of his death estate came to £145,032. On his instructions his papers were burnt by his chauffeur. Some of his documents are kept at the Churchill College Archive Centre of the University of Cambridge.

== Legacy ==
Bracken was a consequential figure in British politics during his lifetime. His biographer, Charles Lysaght, wrote about him: “Without him Churchill might not have survived politically, let alone become Prime Minister. He was also a spin doctor par excellence half a century before the term was invented. And he was the effective founding father of the modern Financial Times, Britain’s highest quality daily newspaper.”

The son of Winston Churchill&#x27;s, Lord Randolph Churchill, once described Bracken as “the fantasist whose dreams came true&quot;.

Bracken and his relationship with Churchill were the focus of an exhibit at The Little Museum of Dublin in 2016 called &quot;Churchill &amp; the Irishman&quot;. The exhibit featured a collection of Bracken&#x27;s letters to his mother. This was the first time that Bracken had been the subject of an exhibition. The exhibition was formally opened by John Ridding, Chief Executive of the Financial Times at the time.

===In popular culture===
In Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s 1945 novel &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;, Bracken served as a model for the character of Rex Mottram. Bracken is featured in the 1981 TV mini series &quot;Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years&quot;, portrayed by Tim Pigott-Smith. In &quot;The Gathering Storm&quot; (2002), he is played by Anthony Brophy.

It has been theorized that Bracken may have been the inspiration for Big Brother and/or O&#x27;Brien of the novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, as George Orwell worked at the Ministry of Information under Bracken&#x27;s term as Minister of Information.

Bracken appears as a major character in Thomas Kilroy&#x27;s 1986 play &quot;Double Cross&quot;. Stephen Rea originated the role.

===2010 and 2015 television documentaries===
On 21 December 2010, RTÉ One broadcast an hour-long TV documentary about his life entitled &quot;Brendan Bracken – Churchill&#x27;s Irishman&quot;. The programme was made by Spanish production company, Marbella Productions, in association with RTÉ, and examined Bracken&#x27;s life through photographs, interviews, rare archive footage and dramatic reconstructions, and told of his importance in the areas of British political and journalistic life, despite his attempt to hide from history by having all his papers burned after his death.

The 2015 television documentary &quot;Churchill&#x27;s Secret Son&quot; is the 90-minute version of the previous documentary &quot;Churchill&#x27;s Irishman&quot;, updated by the producers including additional images, stories about Bracken&#x27;s life and additional footage. The programme was transmitted on Discovery UK&#x27;s History Channel on 24 January 2015 at 10pm, as part of the British History week, and coincided with the 50th anniversary of Churchill&#x27;s death in 1965.

<text>Ruth Ida Krauss (July 25, 1901 – July 10, 1993) was an American writer of children&#x27;s books, including &quot;The Carrot Seed&quot;, and of theatrical poems for adult readers. Many of her books are still in print.

==Early life and education==
Ruth Krauss was born July 25, 1901, in Baltimore, Maryland to Julius Leopold and Blanche Krauss. As a child, Ruth had numerous health problems, including the rare autoimmune disorder pemphigus. She began writing and illustrating her own stories while still a child, hand sewing her pages into books.

Ruth went to a local high school but left in 1917 after her sophomore year to focus on the study of art. She enrolled in the Maryland Institute for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts (now known as the Maryland Institute College of Art). The school&#x27;s focus on applied arts did not suit her and she left after about a year. Her next stop was a girls camp, Camp Walden in Maine, where she discovered her love for writing; the camp yearbook for 1919 contains her first published piece of writing. After the camp, she spent some time studying violin in the Peabody Institute of Music&#x27;s preparatory program. She was considered a gifted but undisciplined musician by her teachers.

Ruth&#x27;s father died in late 1921, requiring Ruth to drop out of school. She took a series of office jobs. In 1927, she decided to enroll at the Parsons School of Design in New York. Graduating from Parsons in 1929, as the Great Depression was beginning, she found it difficult to get work as an illustrator. Among the work she did find in this period was the first pictorial book jacket for the Modern Library (&quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, 1932).

Ruth was a member of the Writers&#x27; Laboratory at the Bank Street College of Education in New York during the 1940s.

In the 1930s, Ruth was married to journalist and crime novelist Lionel White; they divorced shortly before World War II.

==Personal life and career==
Ruth Krauss married children&#x27;s book author Crockett Johnson in 1943. They collaborated on many books, among them &quot;The Carrot Seed&quot;, &quot;How to Make an Earthquake&quot;, &quot;Is This You?&quot; and &quot;The Happy Egg&quot;.

Another eight of her books were illustrated by Maurice Sendak, starting with &quot;A Hole Is to Dig&quot; (1952), which launched Sendak&#x27;s career. The Krauss-Sendak collaborations spawned a host of imitators of their &quot;unruly&quot; and &quot;rebellious&quot; child protagonists. The peculiar definitional phrasing of Krauss&#x27;s writing in this book—with sentences like &quot;A party is to make little children happy&quot;—became something of a cultural phenomenon when the book was first published and has helped to maintain its popularity.

Krauss also illustrated a few of her own books. In addition to her books for children, Krauss wrote three collections of poetry and plays in verse for adults.

==Recognition==
Two books that Krauss wrote were runners-up for the prestigious Caldecott Medal, which is awarded to children&#x27;s book illustrators: &quot;The Happy Day&quot; (1950) and &quot;A Very Special House&quot; (1954). 

Maurice Sendak characterized Krauss as a giant in the world of children&#x27;s literature, saying: &quot;Ruth broke rules and invented new ones, and her respect for the natural ferocity of children bloomed in to poetry that was utterly faithful to what was true in their lives&quot;. He honored her in the &quot;New Yorker&quot; cover illustration for Sept. 27, 1993, which shows a homeless boy using Krauss&#x27;s book &quot;A Hole Is to Dig&quot; as a pillow and another child holding &quot;I Can Fly&quot; as they sleep.

<text>The Baltimore School for the Arts (BSA) is a public performing arts high school located in Mount Vernon, Baltimore, Maryland, United States and is part of the Baltimore City Public Schools system. Established in 1979, The Baltimore School for the Arts offers art concentrations in vocal music, instrumental music, acting, theater production, dance, visual arts and film. The high school has produced numerous &quot;Presidential Scholars&quot; in the Arts and its students have gone on to attend major conservatories and Ivy League Schools.

In 2020, BSA was named a &quot;Silver Medal School&quot; by the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; magazine and was ranked 1,173th nationally and 29th in the state of Maryland (first overall in Baltimore City).

==History==
In 1979, the president of the board of school commissioners authored a charter creating the Baltimore School for the Arts. This charter followed many years of effort to create an arts high school, including a 1978 recommendation of a special Task Force appointed and given strong support by then Mayor William Donald Schaefer, (1921–2011), [served 1971–1986]; [later Governor of Maryland, 1987–1995, Comptroller of Maryland, 1999–2007]. The BSA was created as part of the Baltimore City Public Schools system, however the charter provided the BSA with the structure and the authority to design and implement policies and programs.

The school was originally founded with programs in vocal music, instrumental music, acting, theater production. dance, and visual arts however in December of 2016 Mark Joseph made a three million dollar donation to the school to support a new film and visual storytelling program. The donation was the largest in the school&#x27;s history. The program was first launched in fall of 2017. 

==Mission==

The Baltimore School for the Arts is a school that intends to prepare its students for careers in the arts. The school provides qualified students with training in one of five arts disciplines: music (vocal/instrumental), visual arts, theatre (acting/stage design and production), dance, or film in combination with a college preparatory academic program. The theater and music majors are split into two groups each: for the theater department, there is both acting and Stage Design and Production, and the music department is split into vocal and instrumental.

==Arts==

The Baltimore School for the Arts is a four-year public high school that provides young people with pre-professional training in the arts. Students pursue any one of five disciplines—the visual arts, music (vocal or instrumental), theater (acting or theater production), dance and film. In addition, the school maintains artistic relationships with local organizations such as the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, Center Stage, the Hippodrome Foundation, and the Walters Museum.

== Academics ==
Students follow a college-preparatory curriculum that intends to emphasizes the core values commonly found in a liberal arts education. BSA has a graduation rate of 95 percent sends 99% of their students into higher education. The academic program includes honors-level courses in English, Spanish, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, World History, and U.S. History. AP classes in American Government, English Composition, English Literature, Calculus AB, and Spanish Language &amp; Culture are also offered. In 2022, 131 BSA students took a total of 194 AP exams in English Language and Composition, English Literature, English Composition, and Calculus. Students spend half of each day, four or five periods, in academic courses and half of each day, four or five periods, in their art discipline.

== Extracurricular Activities ==
Due to the focus of many of the student&#x27;s on their artistic discipline the school only began hosting extracurriculars in the 2000s and still retains a limited selection. The BSA has no sports. The BSA&#x27;s official in-school newspaper is &quot;The Muse&quot; which runs bi-monthly and is independent from the school. 

== Admission ==
About 400 students attend the school, coming from public and private schools in and around Baltimore. Students are accepted by an audition or portfolio review only– without regard to grades or academic performance. The audition process varies by artistic discipline. Rising 9th and 10th graders may apply to attend. Of the 1,000 or so students that audition each year, about 115 are accepted for enrollment.

== Campus and facilities ==
Situated in Mount Vernon, a historic cultural district immediately north of downtown Baltimore, BSA is located in two buildings on the corner of Madison Avenue and Cathedral Street. It occupies the former Alcazar Hotel and a historic brownstone. Workspaces consist of music practice rooms, art and dance studios, a film editing lab, a costume/scene shop, and a Center for Collaborative Arts and Technology (CCAT) located in the third floor library. Performance spaces include a black box theater, a recital hall, an art gallery and a theater for larger performances and galas.

<text>The Sd.Kfz. 251 (&quot;Sonderkraftfahrzeug 251&quot;) half-track was a World War II German armoured personnel carrier designed by the Hanomag company, based on its earlier, unarmored Sd.Kfz. 11 vehicle. The Sd.Kfz. 251 was designed to transport the &quot;Panzergrenadier&quot; (German mechanized infantry) into battle. Sd.Kfz. 251s were the most widely produced German half-tracks of the war, with at least 15,252 vehicles and variants produced by seven manufacturers. The utility of this vehicle led the German Army to develop the similar looking but shorter and lighter Sd.Kfz. 250 as a supplement.

Some sources state that the Sd.Kfz. 251 was commonly referred to simply as &quot;Hanomags&quot; by both German and Allied soldiers after the manufacturer of the vehicle; this has been questioned, and may have been only a postwar label. German officers referred to them as &quot;SPW&quot; (&quot;Schützenpanzerwagen&quot;, or armored infantry vehicle) in their daily orders and memoirs.

==Design==
There were four main model modifications (Ausführung A through D), which formed the basis for at least 22 variants. The initial idea was for a vehicle that could be used to transport a single squad of 10 panzergrenadiers to the battlefield protected from enemy small arms fire, and with some protection from artillery fire. In addition, the standard mounting of at least one MG 34 or MG 42 machine gun allowed the vehicle to provide suppressive fire for the rifle squad both while they dismounted and in combat.

The armour plates were designed to provide protection against standard rifle/ machine gun bullets (like the 7.92×57mm Mauser bullet). The front-facing plates were 14.5mm thick; the sides were steeply angled, V-shape 8mm thick plates. This level of armour provided protection against normal (non-tungsten) rifle AP round, which could pierce about 8mm of vertical armour.

Positive aspects of the open top included greater situational awareness and faster egress by the infantry, as well as the ability to throw grenades and fire over the top of the fighting compartment as necessary while remaining under good horizontal cover. The downside, as with all armored personnel carriers of the era, was a major vulnerability to all types of plunging fire; this included indirect fire from mortars and field artillery, as well as small arms fire from higher elevated positions, lobbed hand grenades, Molotov cocktails, and strafing by enemy aircraft.

The first two models (Ausf. A and B) were produced in small numbers from 1939. Ausf. A and B models can be identified by the structure of the nose armor, which comprised two trapezoidal armor panels - the lower of which had an engine cooling vent. The B model, which began production in 1940, eliminated the fighting compartment&#x27;s side vision slits. The C model, which started production in mid-1942, featured a simplified hexagonal-shaped forward armored plate for the engine. Models A through C had rear doors that bulged out. The C model had a large production run, but was quite complex to build, involving many angled plates. From early 1943, the D model was developed with the purpose of halving the number of angled body plates, simplifying the design and thus speeding up the production. D models can be easily recognized by their single piece sloping rear, with flat doors.

The standard personnel carrier version was equipped with a 7.92 mm MG 34 or MG 42 machine gun mounted at the front of the open compartment, above and behind the driver. A second machine gun could be mounted at the rear on an anti-aircraft mount.

Variants were produced for specialized purposes, including with anti-aircraft guns, light howitzers, anti-tank guns and mortars or even large unguided artillery rockets, as well as a version with an infrared search light used to spot potential targets for associated Panther tanks equipped with infrared detectors.

A strong design feature of the Sd.Kfz. 251 was the large track area, with the characteristic &quot;slack track&quot; design with no return rollers for the upper run of track. The Sd.Kfz. 251 also had the &quot;Schachtellaufwerk&quot; system of overlapping and interleaved main road wheels common to virtually all German halftracks of the period. This lowered the ground pressure and provided better traction, at the cost of much greater complexity in maintenance. The Sd.Kfz. 251 also had tank steering, whereby the normal steering wheel moved the front wheels, but after more turning of the steering wheel, the tracks are braked to cause turning, like on a tank. However, the interleaved and overlapping main road wheels shared a major problem with the Tiger I and Panther tanks that also used such roadwheel configurations - in muddy or winter weather conditions, such as those during a mud season (rasputitsa) or the winter conditions, accumulated mud and snow could freeze solid between the road wheels, immobilizing the vehicle.

==Use==

The early production models of this vehicle were issued to the 1st Panzer Division in 1939 as the &#x27;Ausf.A&#x27; or &#x27;A-version&#x27;. There were 232 estimated Ausf.A units produced, which took place in Hannover&#x27;s Hanomag, Büssing-NAG of Berlin-Oberschöneweide, Weserhütte of Bad Oeynhausen, Wumag of Görlitz, and F. Schichau shipyard of Elbing facilities.

These vehicles were meant to enable &quot;Panzergrenadiere&quot; to accompany panzers and provide infantry support as required. In practice, there were never enough of them to go around, and most &quot;Panzergrenadier&quot; units had to make do with trucks for transport.

In August 1943, Romania acquired a total of 27 armored half-tracks, of both the &quot;251&quot; and &quot;250&quot; types followed in 1944 by 251 type and other types of armored cars to convert two cavalry divisions into armored or mechanized divisions. Sd.Kfz. 251s were known as &quot;SPW mijlociu&quot; (&quot;medium SPW&quot;) in Romanian service, while Sd.Kfz. 250s were referred to as &quot;SPW ușor&quot; (&quot;light SPW&quot;).

The Army of the Independent State of Croatia received 15 Sd.Kfz. 251 in spring 1944 and the Ustashe Militia received 12 in autumn 1944.

==Variants==

There were 23 official variants, and sundry unofficial variants. Each variant is identified by a suffix to the model number; however, there was some overlap in the variant numbers.
===Nazi Germany===
*Sd.Kfz. 251/1 - &quot;Schützenpanzerwagen&quot;. Standard personnel carrier.
**Sd.Kfz. 251/1 Ausf. A Ungepanzerte. Made with plain steel 5mm plates instead of armour, to make up numbers due to slow initial 251 production. Around 350 made up to mid 1940.
**251/1 I - with intercom facilities
**251/1 II - Rocket launcher (called &quot;Stuka zu Fuß&quot; (Walking Stuka) or Wurfrahmen 40) equipped with six side-mounted frames for launching 280 mm or 320 mm Wurfkoerper rockets.
**Sd.Kfz. 251/1 - &quot;Falke&quot; Infrared imaging equipment for driver and MG 42 or MG 34 machine gun operator, to be used in combination with Sd.Kfz. 251/20 &quot;Uhu&quot;. Mostly Ausf. D variants.
*Sd.Kfz. 251/2 - &quot;Schützenpanzerwagen (Granatwerfer)&quot;. 81 mm Mortar carrier. Carried 66 rounds for the GrW34. A base plate was also stored so that the mortar could be offloaded and used.
*Sd.Kfz. 251/3 - &quot;mittlerer Kommandopanzerwagen (Funkpanzerwagen)&quot;. Communications vehicle, fitted with extra radio equipment for command use in Ausf. C and Ausf. D versions.
**251/3 I - FuG8 and FuG5 Radios
**251/3 II - FuG8 and FuG5 Radios
**251/3 III - FuG7 and FuG1 Radios (for ground to air coordination)
**251/3 IV - FuG11 and FuG12 Radios (with 9 m telescopic mast); Command vehicle variant (&quot;Kommandowagen&quot;)
**251/3 V - FuG11 Radio
*Sd.Kfz. 251/4 - &quot;Schützenpanzerwagen für Munition und Zubehör des leIG18&quot;. Gun-towing tractor, initially for use with the 7.5 cm leichtes Infanteriegeschütz 18. Later used to tow the 50 mm Pak 38, 75 mm PaK 40 and 10.5 cm leFH 18 light field howitzer.
*Sd.Kfz. 251/5 - &quot;Schützenpanzerwagen für Pionierzug&quot;. Assault Engineer vehicle with inflatable boats stored in the side storage lockers, and light dismantleable assault bridges stored inside through loss of a seat for more storage space. Early command vehicles for Pioneer platoons (&quot;Pionierzug&quot;) were equipped with a 37 mm Pak 36 anti-tank gun mount.
*Sd.Kfz. 251/6 - &quot;mittlere Funkpanzerwagen (Kommandopanzerwagen)&quot;. Command version equipped with map boards, cipher and encoding machines, and Enigma equipment. Probably only made in versions Ausf. A and Ausf. B. Replaced by the 251/3 IV command SPW.
*Sd.Kfz. 251/7 I - &quot;Pionierpanzerwagen&quot;. Another assault engineer vehicle; this had fittings to carry assault bridge ramps on the sides.
**251/7 II - As above but with different radio.
*Sd.Kfz. 251/8 I - &quot;Krankenpanzerwagen&quot;. Armored ambulance capable of carrying up to 8 seated casualties or 4 seated casualties and 2 stretcher cases.
**251/8 II - As above but fitted with FuG5 radio and 2m rod antenna. Assigned to HQ and Panzer units.
*Sd.Kfz. 251/9 - &quot;Schützenpanzerwagen (7.5 cm KwK37)&quot;. Equipped with a 7.5 cm KwK 37 L/24 low velocity gun, using the same pedestal gun mount employed on the StuG III. Nicknamed &quot;Stummel&quot; (&quot;stump&quot;). In 1944, the 7.5 cm K 51 L/24 in a revised modular gun mount was introduced to facilitate production that also incorporated a coaxial MG42. This universal gun mount was also used to create the Sd.Kfz. 250/8 variant and the Sd.Kfz. 234/3.
*Sd.Kfz. 251/10 - &quot;Schützenpanzerwagen (3.7 cm PaK)&quot;. Equipped with a 37 mm Pak 36 anti-tank gun mount. Issued to platoon leaders as a fire support vehicle. Early versions used the whole top half of a Pak 36 with full gunshield, but later ausf. C &amp; D used a much smaller half-size gunshield so that the vehicle didn&#x27;t advertise its firepower, so it looked more like a regular 251/1.
*Sd.Kfz. 251/11 - &quot;Fernsprechpanzerwagen&quot;. Telephone line layer.
*Sd.Kfz. 251/12 - &quot;Messtrupp und Gerätpanzerwagen&quot;. Survey and instrument carrier for artillery units. Never built.

This was in addition to the standard forward machine gun mount. Six Sd.Kfz. 251/16 Flammpanzerwagens were authorised for issue to each Panzergrenadier regiment or in the Pioneer battalion. Though vulnerable, they were used very successfully at night to quickly attack enemy infantry who had just captured German trenches, hitting the enemy before they could consolidate and bring up the heavy weapons that would make them much costlier to defeat later. Late ausf. D versions had larger gunshields.
*Sd.Kfz. 251/17 - &quot;Schützenpanzerwagen (2 cm)&quot;. Anti-aircraft vehicle armed with a 2 cm FlaK 38 L/65 on a Schwebelafette pedestal mounting with a small armored turret to protect the gunner. Late war, it was issued as a platoon commander&#x27;s vehicle to replace the Sd.Kfz. 251/10.
*Sd.Kfz. 251/18 I - &quot;Beobachtungspanzerwagen&quot;. Artillery observation vehicle.
**251/18 Ia - Differences unknown, likely different radio fit.

Known as &quot;Uhu&quot; (Eagle Owl), they guided IR sight-equipped Panther tanks to targets that were out of range of their own smaller infrared searchlights.
*Sd.Kfz. 251/21 - &quot;Schützenpanzerwagen (Drilling MG151s)&quot;. Anti-aircraft and ground support variant equipped with a triple-mount (&quot;Drilling&quot; in German means &quot;triple&quot;) of MG151 autocannon; early version being MG151/15 mm cannon, later being MG151/20 mm Luftwaffe cannon, on a Kriegsmarine triple mount. Strong firepower, especially when organised into platoons of 6 SPW. However, with a combined rate of fire of 2000 RPM, it could fire off its full load of 3000 rounds in just 90 seconds.
*Sd.Kfz. 251/22 - &quot;7.5 cm PaK40 L/46 auf mittlerem Schützenpanzerwagen&quot;. Fitted with a 75 mm PaK 40 anti-tank gun. Probably too big a gun for the carriage, overloaded but effective, and the Yugoslav military was still using captured examples into the 1950s.
*Sd.Kfz. 251/23 - &quot;2 cm Hängelafette 38 auf mittlerem Schützenpanzerwagen&quot;. Reconnaissance variant intended to replace the Sd.Kfz. 250/9 and fitted with the same turret mounting as the Sd.Kfz. 234/1 armoured car. Probably never built.
*Field modified variants - Various field modified variants also existed during World War II. There was a kit for installing an armoured map table in place of the forward MG34 mount in use in 1941. One interesting variant was made at the closing stages of the war, when German forces removed the armored bodies of damaged Sd.Kfz. 251s and installed them on light truck chassis, resulting in a wheeled variant of the Sd.Kfz. 251. At least two were made in this way judging by their number plates.

===Czechoslovakia===
*OT-810 - Czechoslovakian modified version known as Tatra OT-810 was made by Podpolianske strojárne Detva. About 1,500 vehicles were built during 1958–62, they have had an air-cooled diesel engine made by Tatra and armored roof over the troop compartment for better protection in case of nuclear war. The vehicle was not liked by those who used it and was nicknamed &quot;Hitler&#x27;s revenge&quot;. Last vehicles were removed from Czech Army magazines in 1995.
*OT-810D - OT-810 armed with a 82 mm BZK vz. 59 recoilless rifle in a raised rear superstructure, similar to the Sd.Kfz. 251/22.

<text>Gavdos (, ) is the southernmost Greek island, located to the south of its much larger neighbour, Crete, of which it is administratively a part, in the regional unit of Chania. It forms a community with surrounding islets and was part of the former Selino Province. 

==Name==
Gavdos has been known by a wide variety of names. For example, it appears in the biblical account of Paul&#x27;s journey to Rome in Acts 27 as &quot;Clauda&quot; () or &quot;Cauda&quot; (). The island was also referred to as &quot;Cauda&quot; by Roman geographer Pomponius Mela, and as &quot;Gaudos&quot; by Pliny. Ptolemy called Gavdos &quot;Claudos&quot; (). The Venetians called it &quot;Gotzo&quot;, perhaps in imitation of the Maltese island &quot;Gozo&quot;. From the 17th to the 19th centuries, the island was known as &quot;Gondzo&quot;. A Turkish name of Godzo was &quot;Bougadoz&quot;.

==Geography==
The island is south of Chora Sfakion. The area of the municipality, which includes the small island Gavdopoula, is . The island is roughly triangular in shape. Its highest point is Mount Vardia, . The southeastern corner is a rocky peninsula with a natural arch carved by the elements, called Trypiti. A concrete sculpture of an oversized chair, built by a group of Russians who came to the island in the 1990s, sits on top of Trypiti.

==Environment==
There is an islet called Gavdopoula (Γαυδοπούλα, &quot;little Gavdos&quot;) to the north west of Gavdos. Gavdos and Gavdopoula are covered with phrygana (φρύγανα), low-lying shrubs. Both are important stops for migrating birds. Local birds include the Eurasian scops owl and the European shag. Both Gavdos and Gavdopoula have been designated by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). Gavdos also has a variety of other vegetation, such as maquis as well as forests of pines and junipers.

==Climate==
Gavdos is the southernmost island in Greece and all of Europe. The island has a borderline hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSh&quot;). Summers are constantly hot, with daily temperatures reaching around in July and August. Extremes are occasional, sometimes reaching up to , and it has extremely mild winters by European standards. January, the coldest month, has an average temperature around . The Mediterranean Sea is an important thermal regulator that surrounds its island in all its directions, while maintaining the high temperature of the sea, especially in summer passing from . The mild climate is aided by hot winds blowing from the Sahara Desert. As a result of the Subtropical High of the Azores precipitation is concentrated in winter, making summers dry with no precipitation days during July and August. It is one of the sunniest places in Europe, with the highest amounts of radiation: between 1800 and 1900 kWh/m2 (ideal for solar panels), values closer to North Africa and the Middle East. It falls in plant hardiness zone 11a.

==Demographics==
There are only a small number of year-round residents of Gavdos and services for tourists are basic. , the resident population of Gavdos was 142. In the summer the total people on the island can reach over 3,500, most of whom are campers and tourists. The largest man-made harbour is at Karave. The island&#x27;s capital is Kastri. The southernmost populated village is Vatsiana, with a total permanent population of 31 people. Fokia (with Korfos beach area), Ampelos and the area around Sarakiniko beach are the other main populated places.

==History==

Gavdos has supported a permanent population since Neolithic times and the Bronze Age.

Gavdos has been identified as a possible site of the mythical Ogygia where Kalypso held Odysseus prisoner. Archaeological evidence showed that the Roman Empire was active on the island. During that time the flora of the island was overexploited and that started a process of erosion which has continued to this day.

Gavdos, under the name of Cauda, was briefly referenced in the Bible&#x27;s New Testament in the book of Acts. In chapter 27 whilst Paul is a prisoner being transported to Rome by ship they encounter a storm, in verse 16 it reads &quot;As we passed to the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were hardly able to make the lifeboat secure...&quot;. (NIV Version) They eventually shipwrecked in Malta.

Gavdos had approximately 8,000 inhabitants by 900 AD. During the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s reign on the island, which lasted from 1665 until 1895, Gavdos was known as Gondzo. During this period the population decreased considerably to only 500 by 1882. A reference to Saracens on the island survives: the beach Sarakiniko (&quot;of the Saracens&quot;).

In the 1930s the island was used as a place of exile of communists; more than 250 people were exiled including leading figures of the Greek movement, such as Markos Vafiadis and Aris Velouchiotis. During World War II, Allied forces evacuated some forces to Gavdos following the German victory in the battle of Crete. Gavdos was then occupied by the Axis powers from June 1941 until liberation in October 1944.

Later on, the general phase of urbanization that started in other parts of Greece in the 1960s took place in the 1950s on Gavdos. During that period the islanders exchanged their land on Gavdos with ex-Turkish land on Crete, which had now become exchangeable via the state. Upon settling in Crete they created a community known as Gavdiotika, which is part of the town of Paleochora.

==Economy==
There are many abandoned terraces on Gavdos where farmers used to grow crops on the hillsides. There still is some agriculture on Gavdos. During the summer, the population of the island swells to a few thousand because of tourists, although there are few facilities for tourists. There is one year-round cafe in Karave, run by Evangelina Tsigonakis. There is a modern non-functioning reproduction lighthouse tower on Gavdos which now serves as a cafe during the summer season; the complex also contains a museum on the history of the original lighthouse with several rooms of photos and antique equipment. Gavdos has an FM radio station, &quot;Gavdos FM 88.8&quot;, which is also available online.
==Transport==
Ferries connect the port of Karave with those of Paleochora, Sougia, Agia Roumeli, Loutro and Hóra Sfakíon. There is a heliport in the northern part of the island. Bus services connect the island&#x27;s main locations. The island&#x27;s road network is a mixture of paved, unsurfaced and dirt roads.

==Politics==
Following years of isolation, in 1996 the island came to media prominence. In a NATO exercise Gavdos was the focal point of a confrontation between Greece and Turkey. Following that, Prime Minister Costas Simitis visited Gavdos and announced a five-year, €1.5 million plan for the island&#x27;s development.

In 2001, Costis Stephanopoulos, the Greek President, inaugurated a telemedicine centre on Gavdos, an island which has not had a full-time doctor in recent memory. This effort, however, was marred as the island&#x27;s infrastructure could not provide the necessary power required by the centre. For the purposes of the inauguration, generators were brought in, which were then removed. However, according to a 2008 BBC News report the island now features stable electrical power, and young medical graduates can serve for six months on Gavdos in lieu of compulsory military service. But visitors to Gavdos in June 2008 found that the power station was not functioning and that businesses were relying on gas generators operated for a few hours per night; locals stated that the power station worked initially, but no longer serves the entire island reliably.

In 2002, the island was in the news again, due to the arrests of members of the extremist Marxist group 17 November. The leader of this organization had been living openly for several years on Gavdos as a beekeeper.

For the first time, a military outpost was established on the Island of Gavdos by the Greek defence ministry on 30 November 2020. The ministry announced plans of doing the same at the Othonoi island, the westernmost point of the country, following the establishment at the southernmost point of Greece. A total of 9 soldiers were deployed at the outpost in Gavdos at the Cape Tripiti. The decision followed the announcement made by the ministry of expanding Greek territorial waters to 12 nautical miles in the Ionian Sea.

==Gavdos in literature==

Gavdos is featured in James Aldridge&#x27;s 1944 novel &quot;The Sea Eagle&quot;, which tells the story of the escape of a Greek partisan and two Australian soldiers after the Battle of Crete. The three join an expedition to liberate some Cretan fishermen from a Metaxas-era prison on the eastern end of the island. The attack on the cliffs of Khavro Spahti Bay is described in Chapters 24–28.
