<text>An or is a type of traditionally made used by the samurai class of feudal Japan. The Chinese equivalent of this type of sword in terms of weight and length is the &quot;miaodao&quot; or the earlier &quot;zhanmadao&quot;, and the Western battlefield equivalent (though less similar) is the &quot;Zweihänder&quot;.

To qualify as an &quot;ōdachi&quot;, the sword in question would have a blade length of around 3 &quot;shaku&quot; (). However, as with most terms in Japanese sword arts, there is no exact definition of the size of an &quot;ōdachi&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The character for means &quot;big&quot; or &quot;great&quot;; means &quot;field&quot;. The &quot;dachi&quot; here is simply the voiced compounding version of the term , the older style of sword that predates the &quot;katana&quot;. The second character in &quot;tachi&quot;, , is the Chinese character for &quot;blade&quot; (see also &quot;dāo&quot;), and is also the same character used to spell &quot;katana&quot; (刀) and the &quot;tō&quot; in &quot;nihontō&quot; (日本刀 &quot;Japanese sword&quot;).

The word &quot;tachi&quot; itself is derived as the stem or noun form of verb . The kanji spelling is an example of jukujikun, applying a semantically based kanji spelling without regard to the usual phonetic values of the characters.

== History ==
&quot;Ōdachi&quot; became popular in Kamakura period (1185－1333). Until the middle of the Kamakura period, high-ranking samurai mainly fought on horseback with &quot;yumi&quot; (bows), but as group battles by foot soldiers increased from the late Kamakura period, the importance of weapons possessed by those who did not have horses and did not have sufficient training in bows increased. Until then, they mainly used &quot;naginata&quot; with a long handle, but they also started to use &quot;ōdachi&quot;. The Kamakura period was the first time that samurai ruled Japan, and powerful men were valued, and those who wanted to show off the honor of being a warrior preferred to use &quot;ōdachi&quot;.

In the Nanboku-chō period in the 14th century, huge Japanese swords such as &quot;ōdachi&quot; were at their peak. The reason for this is thought to be that the conditions for making a practical large-sized sword were established due to the nationwide spread of strong and sharp swords of the Sōshū school. In the case of &quot;ōdachi&quot; whose blade was long, it was impossible to draw a sword from the scabbard on the waist, so people carried it on their back or had their servants carry it. Large naginata and kanabō were also popular in this period. However, infantry units gradually came to be equipped with &quot;yari&quot; (spears) in addition to &quot;naginata&quot;, and because &quot;ōdachi&quot; was disadvantageous for mountain battles and surprise attacks, and only a few powerful men could use it effectively, this trend ended for a short time. Furthermore, from the Sengoku period in the latter part of the Muromachi period to the Azuchi-Momoyama period, as tactics shifted to fighting with &quot;yari&quot; and &quot;tanegashima&quot; (guns) by a large group of infantry, &quot;ōdachi&quot; became even more obsolete. As &quot;ōdachi&quot; became useless, it was often replaced with a &quot;tachi&quot; and &quot;katana&quot;.
Even so, sengoku-daimyo in the Sengoku period dared to equip their own troops with &quot;ōdachi&quot; in order to show off their strength and bravery. Uesugi Kenshin had men more than six &quot;shaku&quot; (approx. ) tall equipped with an &quot;ōdachi&quot; guard around his horse. The Asakura clan made a troop called &quot;Rikishizei (力士勢)&quot; equip with an ōdachi with a blade length of 5 &quot;shaku&quot; (approx. ), and fought well against the troop of Oda Nobunaga in the Battle of Anegawa.

The ōdachi was used as a weapon, but because of its magnificent appearance, it was often used as an offering to kami, a Shinto shrine. For example, Ōyamazumi Shrine, which is said to be a treasure house of Japanese swords and armor, is dedicated to the national treasure Ōdachi, which was dedicated by Emperor Go-Murakami, and ōdachi, which was dedicated by Ōmori Naoharu and killed Kusunoki Masashige.

In the peaceful Edo period, &quot;ōdachi&quot; was no longer regarded as a practical weapon and came to be recognized only as an offering to the kami of Shinto shrines.

According to the historical book &quot;Wakan Shuyo&quot; (), the had a blade length of 3 &quot;shaku&quot; (traditional Japanese feet) and 9 &quot;sun&quot; (traditional Japanese inches; approx. ) and &quot;ōdachi&quot; had a blade length of 3 &quot;shaku&quot; 3 &quot;sun&quot; (approx. ), but in fact, they were not strictly distinguished between &quot;nodachi&quot; and &quot;ōdachi&quot;, and it is thought that the term &quot;ōdachi&quot; indicated a long &quot;tachi&quot;, and the term &quot;nodachi&quot; indicated an &quot;ōdachi&quot; used in field battles (in keeping with the name, since the initial literally means &quot;field&quot;).

==Production==

&quot;Ōdachi&quot; are difficult to produce because their length makes traditional heat treatment more complicated: The longer a blade is, the more difficult (and expensive) it is to heat the whole blade to a homogeneous temperature, both for annealing and to reach the hardening temperature. The quenching process then needs a bigger quenching medium because uneven quenching might lead to warping the blade.

The method of polishing is also different. Because of their size, ōdachi are usually hung from the ceiling or placed in a stationary position to be polished, unlike normal swords which are moved over polishing stones.

==Method of use==
As battlefield weapons, ōdachi were too long for samurai to carry on their waists like normal swords. There were two main methods in which they could be carried.
One was to carry it on one&#x27;s back and unsheathe before battle starts. The other method was simply to carry the sheathed ōdachi by hand. The trend during the Muromachi era was for the samurai carrying the ōdachi to have a follower to help draw it.

An exception does exist, though. The &quot;Kōden Enshin-ryū&quot; taught by Fumon Tanaka use a special drawing technique for &quot;short&quot; ōdachi allowing it to be carried on the waist. The technique is to pull out the sheath rather than drawing the blade. While this move is also used in other schools, for example, Yagyū Shinkage-ryū, Shin musō Hayashizaki-ryū and Iaidō, only Enshin-ryū seems to have used it to improve the drawing speed of an ōdachi, the other schools having used it with classical katana. The Kage-ryū style is also used to draw from the belt, using blades of approximately 2.8 shaku (.

Ōdachi swordplay styles differed from that of other Japanese swords, focusing on downward cuts.

One possible use of ōdachi is as large anti-cavalry weapons, to strike down the horse as it approaches. Alternatively, it could be used as a cavalry-on-cavalry weapon comparable to the Chinese zhanmadao, with the long reach, increased weight and slashing area of the blade offering some advantages over spears, lances, and smaller swords.

==Notable &quot;ōdachi&quot;==

===&quot;Ōdachi Norimitsu&quot;===
One of the longest &quot;ōdachi&quot; is the &quot;Odachi Norimitsu&quot;, with a total length of . It was forged by the Japanese master bladesmith Norimitsu Osafune in the former Bishū province in August 1446. It is kept in the Yahiko jinja (弥彦神社) in the village of Yahiko, Nishikanbara District, Niigata Prefecture, Japan. A special attribute is that this blade was forged from one piece, similarly to the conventional Japanese katana; it was not forged from multiple pieces or sections. This required the skill of a master bladesmith. The blade, &quot;hada&quot;, and &quot;hamon&quot; are authentic. This &quot;ōdachi&quot; has a &quot;bo-hi&quot; (fuller). Norimitsu was a famous line of swordsmiths that began in the &quot;Oei Bizen&quot; school (1394) and continued until the end of Bizen. Around 2000, it was polished and named &quot;Kibitsu maru&quot; by the priest of Kibitsu Shrine in Okayama Prefecture.

<text>Black XXX-Mas is a 1999 Belgian short film by Pieter Van Hees about a poor family on Christmas Eve, in a story that loosely follows Little Red Riding Hood. It stars Rochelle Gadd, Don Warrington, and Manou Kersting.

== Plot ==
Little Red (Rochelle Gadd) goes out on Christmas Eve to buy some drugs on the dangerous streets, aptly named &quot;The Forest&quot;. She is caught with a joint by a crooked police officer, &quot;Wolfy&quot; (Manou Kersting), who seems more interested in molesting Red than making the arrest. When some careless tourists snap photos of Wolfy&#x27;s lewd behavior, he is forced to shoot them, then eats Red, the only witness.

Meanwhile, Red&#x27;s father, Black Santa (Don Warrington), goes out to steal some presents from rich families. He happens to break into Wolfy&#x27;s house, and ends up having sex with his wife. Wolfy comes home to find his wife with Santa, and shoots her. Santa manages to grab a gun from above the fireplace and shoots Wolfy. Hearing Red&#x27;s voice coming from inside Wolfy&#x27;s body, Santa tears open Wolfy&#x27;s body to find his daughter safe, although shaken.

Later in the evening, Red and her family sing carols around the Christmas tree, which is now topped by a star, Wolfy&#x27;s police badge.

== Cast ==
* Don Warrington as Black Santa
* Rochelle Gadd as Little Red 
* Manou Kersting as Office Wolfy
* Hilde Wils as Mrs. Santa

== Reception ==
Academic Jack Zipes wrote, &quot;As gruesome as this film is, it is also very funny.&quot; In reviewing it on a collection of shorts from Atom.com, Chris Hughes of DVD Talk called the premise &quot;a springboard for broad religious and social satire&quot;. Hughes described the dialogue as &quot;snappy and quotable&quot;.

It won a Pixie Award in 2001.

<text>Gyromancy is a method of divination in which a person spins around inside or walks the circumference of a circle drawn on the ground, the perimeter of which is marked with the letters of an alphabet. The divination is inferred from the letter at the position where the person either stumbles or falls across the circle&#x27;s edge. The person would repeat the practice &quot;...till he evolved an intelligible sentence, or till death or madness intervened.&quot; The dizziness brought on by spinning or circling is intended to introduce randomness or to facilitate an altered state of consciousness.

The word is derived from Medieval Latin, , which is derived from Greek (circle) and (oracle).

Gyromancy is mentioned in the PlayStation game Silent Hill (video game).

<text>In the Book of Ezekiel in the Hebrew Bible, New Jerusalem (, &quot;YHWH šāmmā&quot;, YHWH [is] there&quot;) is Ezekiel&#x27;s prophetic vision of a city centered on the rebuilt Holy Temple, to be established in Jerusalem, which would be the capital of the Messianic Kingdom, the meeting place of the twelve tribes of Israel, during the Messianic era. The prophecy is recorded by Ezekiel as having been received on Yom Kippur of the year 3372 of the Hebrew calendar.

In the Book of Revelation in the New Testament, the city is also called the Heavenly Jerusalem, as well as being called Zion in other books of the Christian Bible.

==Judaism and origin==

In Jewish mysticism, there are two Gardens of Eden and two Promised Lands: the heavenly invisible one and the earthly visible one that is a copy of the heavenly invisible one. Heaven in Jewish mysticism includes a heavenly Promised land – including Jerusalem, the temple, and the Ark of the Covenant – and a heavenly Garden of Eden – including the tree of life, a storehouse for the manna that angels eat, and multiple rivers that water the garden. When the Bible mentions a New Jerusalem, heavenly sanctuary, bread of life, or God&#x27;s throne, it is referring to the Jewish mystical understanding of heaven.

The Babylonian threat to the Kingdom of Judah began as the Babylonian Empire conquered Assyria and rose to power from 612 to 609 BCE. Jerusalem surrendered without major bloodshed to Babylon in 597 BCE. An Israelite uprising brought the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar’s army in 586 BCE. The entire city, including the First Temple, was burned. Israelite aristocrats were taken captive to Babylon.

The Book of Ezekiel contains the first record of the New Jerusalem. Within , there is an extended and detailed description of the measurements of the Temple, its chambers, porticos, and walls. contains a list of twelve Temple gates named for Israel&#x27;s tribes.

The Book of Zechariah expands upon Ezekiel&#x27;s New Jerusalem. When the Second Temple was built, after the exile, Jerusalem&#x27;s population was only a few hundred. There were no defensive city walls until 445 BCE. In the passage, the author writes about a city wall of fire to protect the enormous population. This text demonstrates the beginning of a progression of New Jerusalem thought. In Ezekiel, the focus is primarily on the human act of Temple construction. In Zechariah, the focus shifts to God&#x27;s intercession in the founding of New Jerusalem.

New Jerusalem is further extrapolated in Isaiah, where New Jerusalem is adorned with precious sapphires, jewels, and rubies. The city is described as a place free from terror and full of righteousness. Here, Isaiah provides an example of Jewish apocalypticism, where a hope for a perfected Jerusalem and freedom from oppression is revealed.

As the original New Jerusalem composition, Ezekiel functioned as a source for later works such as 4 Ezra, 2 Baruch, Qumran documents, and the Book of Revelation. These texts used similar measurement language and expanded on the limited eschatological perspective in Ezekiel.

=== Interpretation ===
Judaism sees the Messiah as a human male descendant of King David who will be anointed as the king of Israel and sit on the throne of David in Jerusalem. He will gather in the lost tribes of Israel, clarify unresolved issues of halakha, and rebuild the Holy Temple in Jerusalem according to the pattern shown to the prophet Ezekiel. During this time Jews believe an era of global peace and prosperity will be initiated, the nations will love Israel and will abandon their gods, turn toward Jerusalem, and come to the Holy Temple to worship the one God of Israel. Zechariah prophesied that any family among the nations who does not appear in the Temple in Jerusalem for the festival of Sukkoth will have no rain that year. Isaiah prophesied that the rebuilt Temple will be a house of prayer for all nations. The city of &quot;YHWH Shamma,&quot; (cf. Ezek 48:35) the new Jerusalem, will be the gathering point of the world&#x27;s nations, and will serve as the capital of the renewed Kingdom of Israel. Ezekiel prophesied that this city will have 12 gates, one gate for each of the tribes of Israel. The book of Isaiah closes with the prophecy, &quot;And it will come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, all flesh will come to worship before Me, says YHWH&quot;.

=== Antiochene Persecutions, Hasmonean High Priesthood ===
The Animal Apocalypse within 1 Enoch (chapters 85–90), is another example where conflict sparks hopes for the New Jerusalem. First Enoch is an apocalyptic response to the persecutions under Seleucid Emperor Antiochus IV. In 167 BCE, Emperor Antiochus returned from fighting in Egypt to quell a revolt in Jerusalem led by Jason, the former High Priest. An agitated Antiochus imposed harsh restrictions on Jewish religion. Circumcision, feast celebration, and Sabbath observance were all banned. Antiochus ordered the burning of Torah copies. Jews were required to eat pork. The worst oppression came in the desecration of the Temple. A polytheistic cult was formed, and worship of YHWH abolished. A statue to a Seleucid deity was constructed on the Jewish altar.

First Enoch was written in the wake of this calamity between 166 BCE–163 BCE. For the author of 1 Enoch, history is a steep descent into evil from the utopia in Eden. The author&#x27;s vision of the eschaton centers on the restoration of Jerusalem: &quot;I saw until the owner of the sheep brought a house, new and larger and loftier than the former&quot; (1 Enoch 90:29). In this New Jerusalem passage, the sheep are the Jewish people, the builder is God, and the house is the Temple. During the same time period, the Dead Sea scrolls contain a New Jerusalem tradition formed out of strife. As a tiny Jewish sect living in the caves of Qumran, the Essenes opposed Temple leadership and the High Priesthood in Jerusalem. Their condemnation of the Temple focused on criticizing High Priests. They were also frustrated that Judean Kings were also given the role of High Priest. The Essenes were not against the institution of the Temple and its cult per se. The Essenes at Qumran predicted the reunified twelve tribes to rise together against Roman occupation and incompetent Temple leadership and re-establish true Temple worship.

The surviving New Jerusalem texts in Qumran literature focus specifically on the twelve city gates, and on the dimensions of the entire new city. In 4Q554, the gates of Simeon, Joseph, and Reuben are mentioned in this partial fragment. For the author of this fragment, the New Jerusalem&#x27;s twelve gates signify the reunification of the twelve tribes of Israel. In 5Q15, the author accompanies an angel who measures the blocks, houses, gates, avenues, streets, dining halls, and stairs of the New Jerusalem. There are two important points to consider regarding the Qumran Essenes. First, we do not have enough scroll fragments to completely analyze their New Jerusalem ideologies. Second, based on the evidence available, the Essenes rebelled against Temple leadership, not the Temple itself. Their vision of the New Jerusalem looked for the reunification of the twelve tribes around an eschatological Temple.

=== 4 Ezra, 2 Baruch, 3 Baruch ===
As evidenced above, the historical progression of New Jerusalem language is specifically tied to conflict. The Babylonian Exile, Antiochene persecutions, and corrupt leadership in Jerusalem incited apocalyptic responses with a vision for a New Jerusalem. In the 1st century CE, an even greater conflict exploded in Iudaea province; the Roman destruction of Jerusalem, as well as the other Roman-Jewish Wars. Subsequent apocalyptic responses fundamentally altered the New Jerusalem eschatology for Jews and Early Christians.

At the core, apocalypses are a form of theodicy. They respond to overwhelming suffering with the hope of divine intercession and a perfected World to Come. The destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE meant an end to Second Temple Judaism. Naturally, apocalyptic responses to the disaster followed. This section will first cover 4 Ezra and 2 Baruch. Fourth Ezra and 2 Baruch are important for two reasons. First, they look for a Temple in Heaven, not the eschaton. Second, these texts exhibit the final new Temple texts in Judaism. Jewish texts like 3 Baruch began to reject a restored Temple completely. However, these texts were deemed to be apocryphal by the Rabbis who maintained the belief in a Third Temple as central to Rabbinic Judaism.

The Jewish apocalypse of 4 Ezra is a text contained in the apocryphal book 2 Esdras. The genre of 4 Ezra is historical fiction, set thirteen years after the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem. Fourth Ezra is dated approximately in 83 CE, thirteen years after the Roman destruction of Jerusalem. The story follows Ezra&#x27;s period of mourning following Jerusalem&#x27;s fall. Ezra is Job-like in his criticism of God&#x27;s allowance of Jerusalem&#x27;s downfall.

In Ezra&#x27;s deep state of grief, he meets a woman lamenting over Jerusalem. Ezra consoles the woman, and tells her to, &quot;shake off your great sadness, and lay aside your many sorrows… the Most High may give you rest.&quot; (4 Ezra 10:24). Suddenly, the woman is transfigured in an array of bright lights. She transforms into the New Jerusalem being rebuilt. As a bereaved widow she convinced Ezra to apply solace to himself through the image of a New Jerusalem.

Fourth Ezra has two clear messages. First, do not grieve excessively over Jerusalem. Second, Jerusalem will be restored as a heavenly kingdom. Fourth Ezra also uses the title &quot;Most High,&quot; throughout the apocalypse to emphasise that the Lord will once again reign and reside in Jerusalem.

The apocalypse of 2 Baruch is a contemporary narrative of 4 Ezra. The text also follows the same basic structure 4 Ezra: Job-like grief, animosity towards the Lord, and the rectification of Jerusalem that leads to the comfort of the Job-figure. Second Baruch is historical fiction, written after the Roman destruction but set before the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians.

Baruch is distressed when the Lord informs him of Jerusalem&#x27;s impending doom. Baruch responds with several theological questions for God. For this study, Baruch&#x27;s inquiry about the future of Israel and the honor of the Lord are most pertinent (2 Baruch 3:4-6). Baruch learns that the Lord will destroy the city, not the enemy. Baruch also learns of a pre-immanent heavenly Temple: &quot;[The Temple] was already prepared from the moment I decided to create paradise.&quot; And I showed it to Adam before he sinned.&quot; (2 Baruch 4:3). This Temple was created before Adam, and shown to him before Adam’s fall.

Two important conclusions come from 2 Baruch. First, the author dismisses hopes for an earthly re-built Temple. The focus is entirely on the heavenly Temple that pre-dated the Garden of Eden. This may be a device to express the supremacy of the heavenly Temple as a sanctuary built before Eden (the traditional location of the earthly Temple). Second, Baruch believes that restoration for the people of Israel exists in heaven, not on earth.

The apocalypse of 3 Baruch is the anomaly among post-revolt New Jerusalem texts. Unlike 2 Baruch and 4 Ezra, the text exemplifies an alternative tradition that lacks a restored Temple. Like other apocalypses, 3 Baruch still mourns over the Temple, and re-focuses Jews to the heavens. Yet 3 Baruch finds that the Temple is ultimately unnecessary. This move could be polemical against works which afforded the Temple with excessive veneration. In the passage, an angel comes to Baruch and consoles him over Jerusalem: &quot;Where is their God? And behold as I was weeping and saying such things, I saw an angel of the Lord coming and saying to me: Understand, O man, greatly beloved, and trouble not thyself so greatly concerning the salvation of Jerusalem.&quot; (3 Baruch 1:3)

Third Baruch certainly mourns over the Temple. Yet 3 Baruch is not ultimately concerned with the lack of a Temple. This text goes along with Jeremiah and Sibylline Oracles 4 to express a minority tradition within Jewish literature. In the first Christian apocalypse, the Book of Revelation coincides with this perspective on Jerusalem. The study will now move to early Christian perspectives on the Temple and the apocalyptic response in Revelation.

==Christianity==
Christians have always placed religious significance on Jerusalem as the site of the crucifixion of Jesus and other events central to the Christian faith.

In particular, the destruction of the Second Temple that took place in the year 70, a few decades after Christianity began its split from Judaism, was seminal to the nascent Christian apocalypticism of that time. In the Olivet Discourse of the Gospels, Jesus predicts the destruction of Herod&#x27;s Temple, and promises that it will precede the return of the Son of Man, commonly called the Second Coming. This prophecy of the renewal of Jerusalem by the messiah echoes those of the Jewish prophets. John of Patmos&#x27; vision of the New Jerusalem in the Book of Revelation draws on the Olivet discourse and all the historical precursors mentioned above.

Based on the Book of Revelation, premillennialism holds that, following the end times and the second creation of heaven and earth (see The New Earth), the New Jerusalem will be the earthly location where all true believers will spend eternity with God. The New Jerusalem is not limited to eschatology, however. Many Christians view the New Jerusalem as a current reality, that the New Jerusalem is the consummation of the Body of Christ, the Church and that Christians already take part in membership of both the heavenly Jerusalem and the earthly Church in a kind of dual citizenship. In this way, the New Jerusalem represents to Christians the final and everlasting reconciliation of God and his chosen people, &quot;the end of the Christian pilgrimage.&quot; As such, the New Jerusalem is a conception of Heaven, see also Heaven (Christianity).

=== Interpretation ===

Christianity interprets the city as a physical and/or spiritual restoration or divine re-creation of the city of Jerusalem. It is also interpreted by many Christian groups as referring to the Church to be the dwelling place of the saints.

John of Patmos describes the New Jerusalem in the Book of Revelation in the Christian Bible, and so the New Jerusalem holds an important place in Christian eschatology and Christian mysticism, and has also influenced Christian philosophy and Christian theology. Such a renewal of Jerusalem, if a reconstruction, is an important theme in Judaism, Christianity, and the Baháʼí Faith. Renewed Jerusalem bears as its motto the words &quot;Ad librum&quot; (Latin: &quot;as by the book&quot;.)

Many traditions based on biblical scripture and other writings in the Jewish and Christian religions, such as Protestantism, and Orthodox Judaism, expect the literal renewal of Jerusalem to some day take place at the Temple Mount in accordance with various prophecies. Dispensationalists believe in a literal New Jerusalem that will come down out of Heaven, which will be an entirely new city of incredible dimensions. Other sects, such as various Protestant denominations, modernist branches of Christianity, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and Reform Judaism, view the New Jerusalem as figurative, or believe that such a renewal may have already taken place, or that it will take place at some other location besides the Temple Mount.

It is important to distinguish between &quot;the camp of the saints, and the beloved city&quot; spoken of in Revelation 20:9, and the New Jerusalem of chapter 21.
Rev. 20:9 refers to an earthly city, the description and purpose of which is found in book of Ezekiel, starting with chapter 36 and ending with chapter 48.
One of the most obvious differences is that the dimensions of the New Jerusalem of Rev. 21 are 1,000 times bigger than the dimensions of the city in Ezekiel 48 (and, in Rev. 20:9).
New Jerusalem of Revelation 21 is 2,225 km in length, width, and height. A city of these gigantic proportions cannot be located on Earth; but, as stated in Rev. 21, the city comes &quot;down out of Heaven from God&quot;, presumably onto, the &quot;new earth.&quot;

===The Book of Revelation===
====Introduction to the City====
The term &quot;New Jerusalem&quot; () occurs twice in the New Testament, in Revelation verses 3:12 and 21:2. A large portion of the final two chapters of Revelation deals with John of Patmos&#x27; vision of New Jerusalem. He describes New Jerusalem as &quot;&#x27;the bride, the wife of the Lamb&#x27;&quot;, where the river of the &quot;Water of Life&quot; flows (Revelation 22:1).

After John witnesses the new heaven and a new earth &quot;that no longer has any sea&quot;, an angel takes him &quot;in the Spirit&quot; to a vantage point on &quot;a great and high mountain&quot; to see New Jerusalem &quot;descend out of heaven.&quot; The enormous city comes out of heaven down to the New Earth. John&#x27;s elaborate description of New Jerusalem retains many features of the Garden of Eden and the paradise garden, such as rivers, a square shape, a wall, and the Tree of Life.

====Description of the City====
According to John, the New Jerusalem is &quot;pure gold, like clear glass&quot; and its &quot;brilliance [is] like a very costly stone, as a stone of crystal-clear jasper.&quot; The street of the city is also made of &quot;pure gold, like transparent glass&quot;. The base of the city is laid out in a square and surrounded by a wall made of jasper. It says in that the height, length, and width are of equal dimensions – as it was with the Holy of Holies in the Tabernacle and First Temple – and they measure 12,000 furlongs (approximately 1,500 miles). John writes that the wall is 144 cubits, which is assumed to be the thickness since the length is mentioned previously. 144 cubits is about 65 meters, or 72 yards. It is important to note that 12 is the square root of 144. The number 12 was very important to early Jews and Christians, and represented the 12 tribes of Israel and 12 Apostles of Jesus Christ. The number symbolizes completeness in Revelation. The four sides of the New City represent the four cardinal directions (North, South, East, and West.) In this way, New Jerusalem is thought of as an inclusive place, with the 12 gates accepting all of the 12 tribes of Israel from all corners of the earth.

There is no temple building in the New Jerusalem. God and the Lamb are the city&#x27;s temple, since they are worshipped everywhere. Revelation 22 goes on to describe a river of the water of life that flows down the middle of the great street of the city from the Throne of God. The tree of life grows in the middle of the street and to both sides of the river. The tree bears twelve (kinds of) fruit and yields its fruit every month. According to John, &quot;The leaves of the tree were for healing (those of all) nations.&quot; This inclusion of the tree of life in the New Jerusalem harkens back to the Garden of Eden. The fruit the tree bears may be the fruit of life.

John states that the New Jerusalem will be free of sin. The servants of God will have theosis (i.e. the power or likeness of God, that is &quot;in his image&quot; of holiness) and &quot;His name will be on their foreheads.&quot; Night will no longer fall, and the inhabitants of the city will &quot;have need (of) no lamp nor light of the sun, for the Lord God gives them light.&quot; John ends his account of the New Jerusalem by stressing its eternal nature: &quot;And they shall reign forever and ever.&quot;

=====Gates=====
It had a great, high wall with twelve gates and with twelve angels in charge of the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel. There were three gates on each side: three on the east, three on the south, three on the north, and three on the west (Revelation 21:12–13). The twelve gates were twelve pearls; each gate was made from a single pearl (Revelation 21:21a). The gates in the north wall are named for Reuben, Judah, and Levi; those in the east wall, for Joseph, Benjamin, and Dan; those in the south wall, for Simeon, Issachar, and Zebulun; and those in the west wall are named for Gad, Asher, and Naphtali (Ezekiel 48:31–34).

The New Jerusalem gates may bear some relation to the gates mentioned in Enoch, Chapters 33–35, where the prophet Enoch reports that from each of the four &quot;heavenly gates – opening in heaven – three (new gates) were seen distinctly separating (off, as if) the extremities of the whole earth&quot; [were pulling apart each of the four gates into three new ones]. Thus, the four gates were each replaced by three new ones, totaling twelve [i.e. 3 x 4 = 12] gates in all. [33, 3.][ref. Laurence translation, Book of Enoch.]

=====Geometry=====

In 21:16, the angel measures the city with a golden rod or reed, and records it as 12,000 stadia by 12,000 stadia at the base, and 12,000 stadia high. A stadion is usually stated as 185 meters, or 607 feet, so the base has dimensions of about 2220 km by 2220 km, or 1380 miles by 1380 miles. In the ancient Greek system of measurement, the base of the New Jerusalem would have been equal to 144 million square stadia, 4.9 million square kilometers or 1.9 million square miles (roughly midway between the sizes of Australia and India). If rested on the Earth, its ceiling would be inside the upper boundary of the exosphere but outside the lower boundary. By way of comparison, the International Space Station maintains an orbit with an altitude of about 386 km (240 mi) above the earth.

====Revelation 21:22====
The Book of Revelation may have been composed during the end of the 1st century AD near the end of Domitian’s reign (A.D. 96), although some date it to the later end of the reign of Emperor Nero Domitius (54 to 68 CE). The work is addressed to the &quot;seven churches that are in Asia&quot; (1:4). Revelation is normally broken into three sections: the prologue (1:1–3:22), the visions (4:1–22:5), and the epilogue (22:6–20). This study is principally concerned with chapter 21.

The author of Revelation was both a Jew by birth and a believing Christian. The author and the addressees of Revelation are searching for the Lord to vindicate them and judge the &quot;inhabitants of the earth&quot; for their suffering (6:10). The fall of Jerusalem, coupled with the Neronian persecutions, form the tension within the subtext of Revelation.

Throughout Revelation, several references to the Temple are made . This Temple appears to be of heavenly origin. When the eschaton arrives in , the reader expects the temple to come down from heaven with the New Jerusalem. Revelation 21 even contains typical New Jerusalem terminology that accompanies a restored Temple. Specific measurements are given for the new city (Ezekiel 40–48, 4Q554), and the city is built with gold, sapphires, and emeralds (Isaiah, Tobit). In addition, 21:21 references the &quot;twelve gates.&quot; Revelation maintains another typical aspect of New Jerusalem tradition – the reunification of the twelve tribes of Israel (Ezekiel 48:33–34, 4Q554).

Verse 22 marks a sudden and remarkable shift in New Jerusalem apocalyptic rhetoric: &quot;I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb.&quot; Following with the tradition of 3 Baruch and 4 Sibylline Oracles, Revelation foresees an eschaton without the Temple. Why has the Revelation suddenly denied an eschatological Temple? Verse 23 sheds light on this disparity.

Verse 23 proclaims, &quot;And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God is the light, and its lamp is the lamb.&quot; For the author of Revelation, there is no need for a Temple because the Lord will be the New Jerusalem&#x27;s eternal light and Jesus (the lamb) will be its lamp. This re-interpretation uses Isaiah to make its case:
&quot;The LORD will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory. Your sun shall no more go down, or your moon withdraw itself; for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your days of mourning shall be ended.&quot; (Isaiah 60:19)

The Temple is discarded in the eschaton because the Lord will provide illumination for the New Jerusalem, and Christ will be the glory for its residents. Henceforth, Christians believed that the New Jerusalem no longer required a Temple. For Christians, their Lord sufficiently replaced the Temple.

=== New Jerusalem – Dead Sea Scrolls ===
Discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls near Qumran, Israel, were fragments of a scroll which describes New Jerusalem in minute detail. The New Jerusalem Scroll (as it is called) appears to contain apocalyptic vision, although, being fragmented, it is hard to categorize. Written in Aramaic, the text describes a vast city, rectangular in shape, with twelve gates and encircled by a long wall. Similar descriptions appear in Ezekiel 40–48 and Revelation 21–22 and comparison to the Temple Scroll (also found near Qumran) shows many similarities despite no direct literary links between the two.

=== Montanism ===
From the middle of the 2nd century CE to the middle of the 6th century CE, the ancient Christian sect of Montanism, which spread throughout the Roman Empire, expected the New Jerusalem to descend to earth at the neighboring Phrygian towns of Pepuza and Tymion. In late antiquity, both places attracted crowds of pilgrims from all over the Roman Empire. Pepuza was the headquarters of the Montanist church. The Montanist patriarch resided at Pepuza. Women played an emancipated role in Montanism, serving as priests and also bishops. In the 6th century CE, this church became extinct.

Since 2001, Peter Lampe of the University of Heidelberg has directed annual archaeological campaigns in Phrygia, Turkey. During these interdisciplinary campaigns, together with William Tabbernee of Tulsa, Oklahoma, numerous unknown ancient settlements were discovered and archaeologically documented. Two of them are the best candidates so far in the search for the identification of the two holy centers of ancient Montanism, Pepuza and Tymion, the sites of the expected descent of the New Jerusalem. Scholars had searched for these lost sites since the 19th century.

The ancient settlement discovered and identified as Pepuza by William Tabbernee and Peter Lampe was settled continuously from Hellenistic times to Byzantine times. In Byzantine times, an important rock-cut monastery belonged to the town. The town is in the Phrygian Karahallı area, near the village of Karayakuplu (Uşak Province, Aegean Region, Turkey). The ancient site of Tymion identified by Peter Lampe is located not far away at the Turkish village of Şükranje. For the Montanists, the high plane between Pepuza and Tymion was an ideal landing place for the heavenly New Jerusalem.

===Catholicism===

The Catholic Church places the New Jerusalem in the eschatological role found in Revelation. Catholicism also holds that the New Jerusalem already exists as a spiritual community in Heaven, the Church triumphant, with an outpost on earth, the Church militant. Together, the Church triumphant, Church militant, and Church suffering form the Church universal. Augustine of Hippo, a Doctor of the Church and Church Father, draws inspiration from John&#x27;s account of the New Jerusalem to outline this view in his monumental work &quot;The City of God&quot;.

The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; article on &quot;Heaven&quot; states that Catholic
theologians deem more appropriate that there should be a special and glorious abode, in which the blessed have their peculiar home and where they usually abide, even though they be free to go about in this world. For the surroundings in the midst of which the blessed have their dwelling must be in accordance with their happy state; and the internal union of charity which joins them in affection must find its outward expression in community of habitation. At the end of the world, the earth together with the celestial bodies will be gloriously transformed into a part of the dwelling-place of the blessed (Revelation 21). Hence there seems to be no sufficient reason for attributing a metaphorical sense to those numerous utterances of the Bible which suggest a definite dwelling-place of the blessed. Theologians, therefore, generally hold that the heaven of the blessed is a special place with definite limits. Naturally, this place is held to exist, not within the earth, but, in accordance with the expressions of Scripture, without and beyond its limits. All further details regarding its locality are quite uncertain. The Church has decided nothing on this subject.

===Eastern Christianity===
Emperor Lalibela of Ethiopia built the city of Lalibela as a new reconstructed Jerusalem in response to the Muslim capture of Jerusalem by Saladin&#x27;s forces in 1187.

The Eastern Orthodox Church teaches that the New Jerusalem is the City of God that will come down from heaven in the manner described in the Book of the Apocalypse (Revelation). The Church is an icon of the heavenly Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem Monastery in Russia takes its name from the heavenly Jerusalem.

===Puritans===
The New Jerusalem was an important theme in the Puritan colonization of New England in the 17th century. The Puritans were inspired by the passages in Revelation about the New Jerusalem, which they interpreted as being a symbol for the New World. The Puritans saw themselves as the builders of the New Jerusalem on earth. This idea was foundational to American nationalism.

===Swedenborgian===
Ecclesiastic Swedenborgians often refer to their organizations as part of or contributing to the New Jerusalem as explained by Emanuel Swedenborg in such books as &quot;New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse Revealed&quot;, and &quot;Apocalypse Explained&quot;. According to Swedenborg, the New Jerusalem described in the Bible is a symbol for a new dispensation that was to replace/restore Christianity. Also according to these books, this New Jerusalem began to be established around 1757. This stems from their belief that Jerusalem itself is a symbol of the Church, and so the New Jerusalem in the Bible is a prophetic description of a New Church.

===Latter Day Saints===

In the Latter Day Saint movement, the New Jerusalem is viewed as a physical kingdom that will be built in North America, centered on Independence, Missouri. The movement refers to the New Jerusalem as Zion. The movement&#x27;s founder, Joseph Smith, attempted to establish this Zion in the early 1830s, and drafted a detailed plat of Zion based on his view of the biblical description of the New Jerusalem, including plans for a temple. However, due to political and military rivalry with other Missouri settlers, members of the religion were expelled from Missouri in 1838. Subsequently, several Latter Day Saint denominations have established residence there, believing that it will be the center of God&#x27;s Millennial kingdom.

===Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses===

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that New Jerusalem is made up of anointed Christians serving in heaven as Kings and Priests over the earth. The number of these King-Priests will eventually total 144,000. This belief is based on New Jerusalem being described as &quot;a bride adorned for her husband&quot; , and this same &quot;bride&quot; then being described as &quot;the Lamb&#x27;s wife&quot; . is seen as depicting a wife-like relationship between the Lamb and the 144,000, therefore linking the identity of the 144,000 with the Lamb&#x27;s wife and in-turn also that of New Jerusalem.

===Universal Friends===
The religious community known collectively as the Society of Universal Friends that gathered around the Quaker evangelist known as the Public Universal Friend in the late 18th century was one of religious righteousness and devotion to Christian ideals. In 1790, the preacher founded a community called (New) Jerusalem, planned as a communal society where righteousness would prevail in the wilderness of New York&#x27;s Finger Lakes region, in what is today the town of Jerusalem, New York. The society faded away after the death of their leader.

===British Israelism===
Richard Brothers, the originator of British Israelism, developed a viewpoint that the British are descended from the Lost Tribes of Israel, and that the capital city of Britain should therefore be re-modeled as a New Jerusalem for the coming Age of Enlightenment. Supposedly this idea was already present in 16th Century England, and that it reached its height of influence during and just after the First World War; certain buildings, such as St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, supposedly contain elements of the plan in their design.

===Bedwardism===
Bedwardism, a Jamaican religious movement active between 1889 and 1921, asserted that August Town (a suburb of Kingston) was the New Jerusalem for the western hemisphere, and that Union Camp, where Alexander Bedward&#x27;s Free Baptist Church was located, was Zion. This movement fell apart when Bedward was arrested in 1921.

===Kimbanguism===
Kimbanguism, a Congolese sectarian church founded in 1921 by Simon Kimbangu, refers to Kimbangu&#x27;s birthplace in Nkamba, Congo (a village near Mbanza-Ngungu), as New Jerusalem, where he reputedly performed miracles. Like Bedward, Kimbangu was imprisoned for life in the year 1921, however his movement continues with many followers to the present.

The Kimbanguist believe that people of the Nkamba village saw the New Jerusalem descending from heaven (a building) physically in 1935, by which time Father Simon Kimbangu was in prison. The Kimbanguist has constructed this same design of the building, calling it Nkamba New Jerusalem, in reference to Revelation 21; it has a river with supposed healing power.

===Taiping Heavenly Kingdom===
In 1853, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom captured Nanjing (Nanking) during the Taiping Rebellion against the Qing dynasty of China and renamed the city &quot;New Jerusalem&quot;.

==Baháʼí Faith==
The Baháʼí Faith views the New Jerusalem as the renewal of religion that takes place about every thousand years and which secures the prosperity of the human world. Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, identified the New Jerusalem with his claimed revelation (the word of God), and more specifically with the Law of God.

`Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá, Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh&#x27;s son, further explains that the New Jerusalem which descends from heaven is not an actual city which is renewed, but the law of God since it descends from heaven through a new revelation and it is renewed.
Shoghi Effendi, head of the religion after the death of `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá, stated that specifically Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh&#x27;s book of laws, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, is the new Jerusalem. Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, in the Tablet of Carmel, also states that the new Jerusalem had appeared upon the new Mount Zion, Mount Carmel.

== Music ==
The Lutheran hymn &quot;Jerusalem, du hochgebaute Stadt&quot;, with lyrics written by Johann Matthäus Meyfart in 1626, describes entering the Heavenly Jerusalem. It was set by composers such as Max Reger and Sigfrid Karg-Elert.

<doc id="860238" wikidata="Q5114640" url="?curid=860238" title="Chrysler B platform">
<text>The B platform or B-body was the name of two of Chrysler&#x27;s midsize passenger car platforms – at first rear-wheel drive, from 1962 through 1979; and the later, unrelated front-wheel drive platform, used by the Eagle Premier / Dodge Monaco, from 1988 through 1992. 

The 1962-1979 platform underwent significant changes through its production life, but each Chrysler B-platform car in a given model year shared the same chassis, with only styling differences between the Dodge and Plymouth models. The cars were otherwise mechanically identical. Similarly, the 1988-1992 Premier and Monaco models differed only by styling and shared the same front-wheel drive B-body platform.

The Plymouth B-body series ultimately comprised four cars with nearly identical outward appearances (differing only in trim package, drive train and accessories). These were the Belvedere, Satellite, GTX and Road Runner. The 1970 Superbird was a Road Runner with an extended nose cone and front fenders borrowed from the Dodge Coronet, a revised rear window, and a high-mounted rear wing. The Superbird&#x27;s unique styling was a result of homologation requirements for using the same aerodynamic nose and rear wing when racing the car in the NASCAR series of the time. While the aerodynamic concept used to create the Superbird was identical to that of the 1969 Dodge Charger Daytona, they shared no common body components. The Superbird was produced only during the 1970 model year.

In NASCAR competition, the Superbird was successful with Pete Hamilton driving for Petty Enterprises winning the 1970 Daytona 500 using a Superbird. However, NASCAR effectively hobbled the low production winged cars after 1970 with strict regulations that limited the size of engines that could power them. This rendered them uncompetitive.

There was more diversity in the outward appearance of the Dodge B-body series. The Dodge models based on the B-body were the Coronet, Super Bee and the Charger. The 1969 Charger Daytona was a Charger with an extended nose and high-mounted rear wing, offered for the same reasons as the Superbird. The Charger Daytona was produced only during the 1969 model year.

The Premier was later joined by the similar Dodge Monaco for 1990.

<text>Chrysler&#x27;s C platform was the basis for rear wheel drive full-size cars from 1965 to 1978. Although often misclassified, 1964 and earlier full-size Chrysler products, and 1966 and earlier Imperials are not C-bodies.

== History ==
C-bodies were built between 1965 and 1978. They had wheelbases ranging from 119 to 124 inches, they were generally loaded with features, and all C-Body cars used a torsion bar front suspension design.

In 1969, Chrysler redesigned the C-Body platform to incorporate its new &quot;Fuselage&quot; styling that brought the upper and lower sections of body into one uniformly shaped design, in turn changing the look of all the models. This new C-Body design saw Chrysler ditching the last stylistic remnants of the early-to-mid 1960s in favor of a more contemporary silhouette. These emphasized luxury over performance.

However, due to economic turmoil and an auto industry reeling from a one-two punch of federal regulation and skyrocketing gas prices, Chrysler&#x27;s sales dipped and production ended in 1978.

<text>Cumulus castellanus (from Latin &quot;castellanus&quot;, castle) is an unofficial name of a species of cumulus cloud that is distinctive because it displays multiple towers arising from its top, indicating significant vertical air movement. It is a misnomer for cumulus congestus and correspondingly can be an indicator of forthcoming showers and thunderstorms. The World Meteorological Organization and the American Meteorological Society do not recognize cumulus castellanus as a distinct species, but instead classify all towering cumulus clouds as Cumulus congestus.

<doc id="860249" wikidata="Q893103" url="?curid=860249" title="Booster engine">
<text>A locomotive booster for steam locomotives is a small supplementary two-cylinder steam engine back-gear-connected to the trailing truck axle on the locomotive or one of the trucks on the tender. It was invented in 1918 by Howard L. Ingersoll, assistant to the president of the New York Central Railroad.

A rocking idler gear permits the booster engine to be put into operation by the driver (engineer). A geared booster engine drives one axle only and can be non-reversible, with one idler gear, or reversible, with two idler gears. There were variations built by the Franklin company which utilized side rods to transmit tractive force to all axles of the booster truck. These rod boosters were predominately used on the leading truck of the tender, though there is an example of a Lehigh Valley 4-8-4 using it as a trailing tender truck.

A booster engine is used to start a heavy train or maintain low speed under demanding conditions. Rated at about at speeds from , it can be cut in while moving at speeds under and is semi-automatically cut out via the engineer notching back the reverse gear or manually through knocking down the control latch up to a speed between , depending on the model and gearing of the booster. A tractive effort rating of was common, although ratings of up to around were possible.

Tender boosters are equipped with side-rods connecting axles on the lead truck. Such small side-rods restrict speed and are therefore confined mostly to switching locomotives, often used in transfer services between yards. Tender boosters were far less common than engine boosters; the inherent weight of the tenders would decrease as coal and water were consumed during operation, effectively lowering the adhesion of the booster-powered truck.

== Reasons for use ==

The booster was intended to make up for fundamental flaws in the design of the standard steam locomotive. To start off, most steam locomotives do not provide power to all wheels. The amount of force that can be applied to the rail depends on the weight on the driven wheels and the factor of adhesion of the wheels against the track. Unpowered wheels are generally needed to provide stability at speed, but at low speed they are not required, so they effectively &#x27;waste&#x27; weight which could be used for traction. Therefore, the application of a booster engine to the previously unpowered axle meant that overall starting tractive effort was increased with zero penalty to the adhesion levels of the main engine.

Additionally, the &quot;gearing&quot; of a steam locomotive is fixed, because the pistons are linked directly to the wheels via rods and cranks. Therefore, a compromise must be struck between ability to exert high tractive effort at low speed and the ability to run fast without inducing excessive piston speeds (which would cause failure), or the exhaustion of steam. That compromise means that, at low speeds, a steam locomotive is not able to use all the power the boiler is capable of producing; it simply cannot use steam that quickly, so there is a substantial difference between the amount of steam the boiler can produce and the amount that can be used. The booster engine enabled that wasted potential to be put to use.

The increased starting tractive effort provided by the booster meant that, in some instances, railroads were able to reduce the number of, or eliminate the use of additional helper locomotives on heavier trains. This resulted in lower operating and maintenance costs, higher locomotive availability and productivity (ton-miles), and ultimately, greater profitability.

== Disadvantages ==

Boosters were costly to maintain, with their flexible steam and exhaust pipes, idler gear, etc. Improper operation could also result in undesirable drops in boiler pressure and/or damage to the booster. The booster and its associated components also added several tons of weight to the locomotive which would be considered &quot;dead weight&quot; at speeds above which the booster could not be used. Additionally, if the booster suffered a failure where the idler gear could not be disengaged, the entire locomotive would be speed restricted to 20 mph or less, until it could be taken out of service to facilitate repairs, decreasing locomotive availability.

==Calculating tractive effort and operating speeds==

A rough calculation of booster tractive effort could be made with the following formula:

formula_1

where
* &quot;t&quot; is tractive effort in pound-force
* &quot;c&quot; is the coefficient representing mean effective pressure, normally set to 0.80
* &quot;d&quot; is the piston diameter in inches (bore)
* &quot;s&quot; is the piston stroke in inches
* &quot;p&quot; is the working pressure in pounds per square inch
* &quot;r&quot; is the booster gear ratio
* &quot;w&quot; is the diameter of the trailing wheels to which the booster is geared in inches

The typical locomotive booster employed a pair of by cylinders. Available gear ratios and associated operating speeds for both the Franklin type C and type E booster models are detailed in the table below.

== Usage ==
===North America===
The booster saw most use in North America. Railway systems elsewhere often considered the expense and complexity unjustified.

Even in the North American region, booster engines were applied to only a fraction of all locomotives built. Some railroads used boosters extensively while others did not. The New York Central was the first railroad to use a booster in 1919 and remained a proponent of the device, applying them to all of its high-drivered 4-6-4 Hudson locomotives to increase their acceleration out of stations with crack passenger trains. The rival Pennsylvania Railroad, however, used few booster-equipped locomotives. Similarly, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio specified boosters on all of its Superpower locomotives aside from the Allegheny to increase tonnage ratings over some of the hilly terrain found on their main lines, while rival Norfolk &amp; Western experimented with boosters briefly and found their cost unjustified, instead choosing to increase engine tractive effort through the raising of boiler pressure.

Canadian Pacific Railway rostered 3,257 steam locomotives acquired between 1881 and 1949, yet only 55 were equipped with boosters. 17 H1 class 4-6-4s, 2 K1 class 4-8-4s and all 36 Selkirk 2-10-4s.

===Australia===
In Australia, Victorian Railways equipped all but one of its X class 2-8-2 locomotives (built between 1929 and 1947) with a &#x27;Franklin&#x27; two-cylinder booster engine, following a successful trial of the device on a smaller N class 2-8-2 in 1927. From 1929 onwards, South Australian Railways 500 class 4-8-2 heavy passenger locomotives were rebuilt into 4-8-4s with the addition of a booster truck .

===New Zealand===
NZR&#x27;s KB class of 1939 were built with a booster truck to enable the locomotives to handle the steeper grades of some South Island lines (particularly the &quot;Cass Bank&quot; of the Midland Line). Some boosters were later removed because of the gear jamming.

===Great Britain===
In Great Britain, eight locomotives of four different classes on the London and North Eastern Railway were equipped with booster units by Nigel Gresley. Four were existing locomotives rebuilt with boosters between 1923 and 1932: one of class C1 (in 1923); both of the conversions from class C7 to class C9 (in 1931); and one of class S1 (in 1932). The remaining four were all fitted to new locomotives: the two P1 2-8-2 locomotives, built in 1925; and two class S1 locomotives built in 1932. The boosters were removed between 1935 and 1938, apart from those on class S1 which were retained until 1943.

An early type of booster used in Great Britain was the steam tender, which was tried in 1859 by Benjamin Connor of the Caledonian Railway on four 2-4-0 locomotives. Archibald Sturrock of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) patented a similar system on 6 May 1863 (patent no. 1135). It was used on fifty GNR 0-6-0 locomotives: thirty converted from existing locomotives between 1863 and 1866, and twenty built new in 1865 (nos. 400–419). The equipment was removed from all fifty during 1867–68.

<text>The Chrysler F platform was a rear wheel drive automobile platform used by Chrysler motors from 1976 to 1980. It was replaced by the nearly identical M platform. There were two wheelbases: 108.7 in for 2-door models, and 112.7 in for four-doors. As the market evolved, these would be marketed as mid-size and eventually take on full-sized nameplates such as Plymouth Fury for police and fleet applications. These were effectively replaced by the very successful Chrysler K platform in standard and stretch sizes which retained two bench seats, column shifter and room for six, unlike many other compact-sized cars modeled after non-American designs.
Cars that used the F platform include:
* 1976–1980 Dodge Aspen/Plymouth Volaré
* 1979–1980 Plymouth Duster
* 1976–1980 Plymouth Road Runner
* 1976–1980 Dodge Dart (Mexico)
* 1976–1980 Dodge Super Bee (Mexico)
* 1976–1980 Chrysler Valiant/Valiant Volare
*1977–1980 Monteverdi Sierra

<doc id="860258" wikidata="Q6824872" url="?curid=860258" title="Metropark station">
<text>Metropark station is an intermodal transportation hub on the Northeast Corridor in the Iselin section of Woodbridge Township in Middlesex County, New Jersey that is located 24.6 miles southwest of New York Penn Station. It is owned and operated by NJ Transit and serves Amtrak and NJ Transit&#x27;s Northeast Corridor Line. NJ Transit runs peak period &#x27;loop&#x27; buses in coordination with train schedules.

The station is near the interchange of Route 27 and Garden State Parkway near exits 131 and 132. and has a multi-story parking facility that is open at all times.

The station, built by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) and the United States Department of Transportation, opened on November 14, 1971, as Garden State Metropark. It was built as a suburban park-and-ride stop for the then-new high-speed rail &quot;Metroliners&quot;.

==History==

Metropark was one of two park-and-ride infill stations proposed in the 1960s for use by the new &quot;Metroliners&quot;, the other being Capital Beltway in Lanham, Maryland, just outside Washington, D.C. The two stations were originally named Capital Beltway Metropark and Garden State Metropark; these were shortened to Capital Beltway and Metropark. Both were conceived as public-private partnerships. Under a plan put forward in late 1968 by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) the state would contribute $648,000 toward the cost of the station, then estimated at $1.4 million.

Amtrak service to Metropark began on November 14, 1971. The station&#x27;s cost had increased to $2.6 million, shared by NJDOT and the United States Department of Transportation. It had two high-level platforms and had 820 parking spaces. It was next to the Garden State Parkway to allow easy access by automobile; a large business park – &quot;the first Edge City in the world to grow from a parking lot&quot; – soon grew near the station. Commuter trains continued to use Iselin station, half a mile east.

The station was officially renamed Harrison A. Williams Metropark Station on July 30, 1979, in recognition of Senator Williams&#x27; support for its construction. After his 1981 conviction for bribery and conspiracy in the Abscam scandal, local officials campaigned to have his name removed from the station, though it remained until at least 1984. Northbound on- and off-ramps were added to the Garden State Parkway at Exit 131A in November 1986 to improve station access.

===Renovation===

In January 2007, NJ Transit announced a nearly $30 million renovation plan for the station, to be completed by 2010. Reconstruction was completed by Anselmi &amp; DeCicco, Inc. of Maplewood, NJ in summer 2009, and cost $47 million. Climate-controlled shelters and LCD train information systems were installed, platforms were extended to accommodate 12-car trains, canopies were lengthened and the station building was enlarged as part of the project.

On April 12, 2023, one of the two staircases between the underpass and the southbound platform was closed.

==Layout and services==

The station is served by NJ Transit Rail Operations Northeast Corridor Line. The station has two high-level side platforms flanking the four tracks of the Northeast Corridor. Amtrak&#x27;s long-haul services and most Keystone Service trains that utilize the Northeast Corridor bypass the station via the inner tracks, as do some NJ Transit express trains. Until 2005, the eastbound also stopped at Metropark. Amtrak trains skip most other stations between Trenton and Newark Penn Station, but many trains stop at Metropark despite having to switch to the outside (local) tracks to do so. Pairs of 45-mph crossovers (interlockings MENLO and ISELIN) just east and west of the station were added about 1986 to make this easier.

Five peak-hour &quot;Metropark Loop&quot; routes, operated by NJ Transit as bus routes 801–805, connect the station to the surrounding office parks and residential areas.

<doc id="860262" wikidata="Q5114686" url="?curid=860262" title="Chrysler minivans">
<text>The Chrysler minivans are a series of minivans that have been produced and marketed by the American automaker Chrysler since the 1984 model year. Currently in its sixth generation, the model line is marketed worldwide, primarily in North America and Europe. Introduced as the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager, the Chrysler minivans have been marketed under a variety of nameplates under the Chrysler, Plymouth, Dodge, and Ram brands; through the use of rebadging, the model line has also been marketed under the Lancia and Volkswagen brands.

The introduction of the Chrysler minivans popularized the body styles by automakers in North America, leading to the introduction of competitive vehicles such as the Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari, Ford Aerostar, Toyota Previa, and Mazda MPV. During the 1990s, the popularity of the model line led to its form factor becoming closely adopted by many of its competitors, leading to the Ford Windstar/Freestar, Honda Odyssey, Toyota Sienna, and Nissan Quest. 

Since 1983, Chrysler has manufactured minivans at its Windsor Assembly facility (Windsor, Ontario, Canada). From 1987 to 2007, the company supplemented production in North America with its Saint Louis Assembly facility (Fenton, Missouri). For the European market, exports were largely supplemented by the Eurostar joint-venture factory in Graz, Austria from 1992 to 2002. The highest-selling line of minivans worldwide, Chrysler produced the 15 millionth example of the model line in 2019.

== Table of models ==
==First generation (1984–1990)==

The first-generation Chrysler minivans were released in November 1983 as 1984 models. The Dodge Caravan was an all-new nameplate, with the Plymouth Voyager adopted from its previous full-size van line. The model lines were built on the front-wheel drive Chrysler S platform. To streamline production and development costs, while the S platform was a distinct design, it shared powertrain commonality with the K platform and its variants; interior components were also shared with other Chrysler vehicles.

For 1987, Chrysler introduced the extended-length Dodge Grand Caravan and Plymouth Grand Voyager, which used a long-wheelbase version of the S platform chassis. For 1988, the Chrysler Voyager was introduced for European export. Alongside the passenger van, the model line was sold by Dodge as a cargo van; from 1984 to 1988, it was known as the Dodge Mini Ram Van and as the Dodge (Grand) Caravan C/V from 1989 to 1990.

Chrysler added a minivan to its namesake brand early in the 1990 year, shifting the Chrysler Town &amp; Country from its traditional station wagon usage to a minivan; sold exclusively in a long-wheelbase version, the Town &amp; Country became the highest-trim Chrysler minivan. 

==Second generation (1991–1995)==

The second-generation Chrysler minivans were released for the 1991 model year, returning the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager, their extended-wheelbase &quot;Grand&quot; versions, and the Chrysler Town &amp; Country. The minivans were introduced to Mexico, with Chrysler using the Chrysler Grand Voyager/Grand Caravan nameplate.

Designated the Chrysler AS platform (as Chrysler switched to a two-letter platform nomenclature), the second-generation minivans underwent a substantial revision of the body (sharing only the front door and sliding door stampings) and chassis (the front suspension was retuned and the rear suspension was redesigned entirely); powertrain commonality shifted from the K-car sedans towards its larger derivatives. In a first for the segment, the model line was fitted with a standard driver-side airbag (1991) and optional integrated rear child safety seats (1992). Following its introduction in its Ford and GM competitors, Chrysler introduced an all-wheel drive system as an option for 1991.

For 1994, the model line underwent a mid-cycle revision. While the model line was officially classified a light truck by the US government, the minivans were upgraded to meet 1998 federal safety standards for cars, adding side-impact door beams, dual airbags, four-wheel disc brakes, and a redesigned dashboard. The second-generation minivans are the last versions of the model line to be fitted with a manual transmission in North America and also the final versions fitted with exterior woodgrain trim.

From 1993 to 1995, the Chrysler TEVan was a limited-production electric vehicle based on the Dodge Caravan; sold to fleet buyers, between 56 and 80 were produced. For 1994, Chrysler offered a CNG (compressed natural gas) version of its minivan; the fuel tank replaced the spare tire well.

===ES platform===
The ES platform is the European counterpart to the North American AS platform. Alongside production by Windsor Assembly in Canada, production of export-market minivans began in 1992 in Graz, Austria (in the Eurostar joint venture factory between Chrysler and Steyr-Daimler-Puch). Alongside the European-market Chrysler Voyager and Grand Voyager, the ES platform serves as the basis for the Dodge Mini Ram Van (a cargo van exclusive to the Netherlands). 

==Third generation (1996–2000)==

The third-generation Chrysler minivans were released in January 1995 for model year 1996. In a $2.8 billion redesign of the model line (the most expensive design program ever undertaken by Chrysler at the time), the Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager, and Chrysler Town &amp; Country underwent their first complete redesign since their introduction. The Dodge Caravan (Chrysler Caravan in Mexico) and Plymouth Voyager were both returned in both standard and extended-wheelbase versions; the Chrysler Town &amp; Country was expanded into a full model line, introducing multiple trim levels and a short-wheelbase body.

Designated the Chrysler NS platform, the minivans again used a front-wheel drive chassis (with all-wheel drive as an option). Nearly four inches taller than its predecessor, the third generation adopted a cab forward configuration, shifting the windshield and dashboard forward. As a first in an American-market large minivan, a driver-side sliding door (originally intended for the first-generation model line, but deleted to reduce costs) was introduced as an option. To improve the flexibility of seat removal, the rear seat latches were redesigned, with bench seat latches set on rollers. To further differentiate each model line, designers styled the Caravan, Voyager, and Town &amp; Country with distinct front fascias and exterior trim; exterior woodgrain trim was retired from all three model lines. In another change, the hood ornament was deleted (the only Chrysler Pentastar visible to the driver was on the steering wheel).

Replacing the TEVan, the Dodge Caravan EPIC electric vehicle was produced from 1999 to 2000 (taking its name from a 1992 concept car); the EPIC was leased to fleet buyers.

Coinciding with the phaseout of the Plymouth brand, Chrysler introduced a Chrysler-brand Voyager and Grand Voyager for North America for 2000 (sold concurrently alongside its Plymouth namesake).

===GS platform===
The Chrysler GS platform is the global export counterpart to the North American Chrysler NS platform. Again sharing design and powertrain commonality with its North American counterpart, the export version of the Chrysler model line was the only version to offer a manual transmission and a 2.5L turbodiesel engine. In 1996, the Austrian Eurostar factory commenced production of the first right-hand drive Chrysler minivans.

Alongside the Chrysler Voyager and Grand Voyager marketed for European export, Chrysler marketed the renamed Dodge Ram Van in the Netherlands in a cargo-only configuration. 

==Fourth generation (2001–2007)==

Generation IV of the platform was introduced on January 10, 2000, and was called RS.

Models:
* 2001–2003 Chrysler Voyager
* 2001–2007 Chrysler Town &amp; Country 
* 2001–2007 Dodge Caravan/Grand Caravan
* 2001–2007 Chrysler Voyager/Grand Voyager (Mexico)

===CS===

The CS is a variant of the RS platform made specifically for the Chrysler Pacifica crossover SUV.

Model:
* 2004–2008 Chrysler Pacifica

===RG===
The Chrysler RG platform is the global export counterpart to the North American Chrysler RS platform.

Model:
* 2001–2007 Chrysler Caravan/Grand Caravan
* 2001–2007 Chrysler Voyager/Grand Voyager
* 2005–2007 Chrysler Town &amp; Country (Taiwan)
* 2001–2007 Dodge/Chrysler Ram Van (Netherlands, cargo van)
* 2007–2010 Chrysler Grand Voyager/Dodge Grand Caravan (China)
==Fifth generation (2008–2020)==
The fifth-generation Chrysler minivans were introduced at the 2007 North American International Auto Show for the 2008 model year, marking the debut of the RT platform. In a major change, the short-wheelbase configuration was dropped, alongside the Chrysler Town &amp; Country, all Dodge minivans were now Grand Caravans. The export-market Chrysler Grand Voyager made its return; following the acquisition of Chrysler by Fiat, the model line was also marketed as a Lancia Voyager outside North America. Unlike the preceding and succeeding generations, the fifth generation minivans were not marketed under the Chrysler Grand Caravan nameplate. It was also the only generation of the Dodge Grand Caravan to be marketed in Mexico.

The first Chrysler minivans to be powered exclusively by V6 engines (in North America), the RT platform marked the introduction of a 4.0 L SOHC V6 and a 6-speed automatic transmission. For 2011, the 3.6 L Pentastar V6 replaced all three V6 engines, remaining the sole V6 engine through current production. In Europe, the Voyager was powered by a 2.8 L VM Motori inline-4 turbodiesel; for the first time, no manual transmission was offered.

For 2012, the Grand Caravan C/V cargo van shifted its branding, becoming the Ram C/V. In 2015, Ram replaced the C/V with the Ram ProMaster City (a rebadged Fiat Doblo).

Models:
* 2008–2016 Chrysler Town &amp; Country 
* 2008–2020 Dodge Grand Caravan
* 2008–2010 Chrysler Grand Voyager
* 2011–2015 Lancia Voyager
* 2012–2014 Ram C/V (replaced by Ram ProMaster City)

===RM===

The Volkswagen Routan was introduced at the 2008 Chicago Auto Show as a rebadged variant of the Chrysler minivans, manufactured at Windsor Assembly using the RT platform, designated as the RM platform. Marketed by Volkswagen exclusively in the North American market, the Routan featured revised interior and exterior styling as well as different equipment content from the Chrysler vans. Production of the Routan was discontinued in 2013.

Model:
* 2009–2014 Volkswagen Routan

=== Discontinuation ===
On February 28, 2020, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced the discontinuation of the Dodge Grand Caravan, the last RT nameplate in production; production of the minivan was scheduled to conclude in late May but has since been delayed to mid-July.

== Sixth generation (2017–present) ==

The sixth generation of the Chrysler minivan was introduced at the 2016 North American International Auto Show, as Chrysler released the 2017 Chrysler Pacifica. Serving as a replacement for the Town &amp; Country, the Pacifica revived the nameplate of the 2004–2008 Town &amp; Country-derived CUV. For the first time since their 1984 introduction, Chrysler markets a different minivan than Dodge, with the latter division retaining the previous-generation Grand Caravan; the Chrysler/Lancia Voyager export nameplates were discontinued and all exports are sold as Pacificas.

Sharing the CUSW (Fiat D-Evo) platform with the Chrysler 200, the Pacifica is the first minivan sold in North America sold with a 9-speed automatic transmission; a CVT is part of the first plug-in hybrid powertrain in a minivan, offered as an option.

For the 2020 model year, Chrysler reintroduced the Voyager nameplate (last seen in 2003 for the United States). Adopting the lower two trim levels of the Pacifica, the Voyager also introduces a trim level specifically for fleet sale. The option of all-wheel drive (last seen in 2004) was also reintroduced for the gasoline-only Pacifica during this model year.

For the 2021 model year, Chrysler announced that the lower two trim levels of Pacifica, sold as the Voyager in the United States, will be sold under the Grand Caravan nameplate in Canada. The L and LX trim levels respectively adopt the SE and SXT designations from the outgoing Dodge Grand Caravan. Vehicles bearing the &quot;Chrysler Grand Caravan&quot; nameplate were last seen in 2007, primarily in South American markets.

Models:
* 2017–present Chrysler Pacifica/Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid
* 2020–present Chrysler Voyager/Chrysler Grand Caravan

<text>Bartolomé de Escobedo (1515 – August 11, 1563) was a Spanish composer of the Renaissance.

==Biography==
He was born in Zamora, studied at Salamanca where he was a singer, and in 1536 joined the papal choir in Rome as only the second Spaniard to be admitted after Cristóbal de Morales. He remained in Rome until 1554, interrupted by a short return to his home in 1541-5. When he left the papal choir he returned to Spain, taking a non-resident prebend at the cathedral in Segovia.

He had his share of difficulties while in Rome, mostly due to his short temper and illness. Records from the Vatican, the &quot;Diarii Sistini&quot;, show that he was fined on two occasions for calling a fellow singer an &quot;ass&quot; and a &quot;fat pig&quot;, and that he was inexplicably excommunicated for one day in 1546. Despite this, he was well regarded as a theorist and was famously involved in judging the public debate of 1551 between Nicola Vicentino and Vicenzo Lusitano over the relevance of ancient Greek modes to 16th century music.

Escobedo has been speculated to be the teacher of Tomás Luis de Victoria, but no firm evidence of this has been uncovered.

Of his music only two masses, six motets and one villancico survive.

==Works==

Masses:
*&quot;Missa Ad te levavi&quot; (a6)
*&quot;Missa Philippus Rex Hispanie&quot; (a6)

Motets:
*&quot;Domme non secundum&quot; (a5)
*&quot;Erravi sicut ovis&quot; (a4)
*&quot;Exurge quare obdormis&quot; (a4)
*&quot;Hodie completi sunt&quot; (a5)
*&quot;Immutentur habitu&quot; (a4)
*&quot;Magna opera Domini&quot; (a4)

Villancico:
*&quot;Ay, ay, ay, quien se queja&quot; (a6)

<doc id="860272" wikidata="Q5114672" url="?curid=860272" title="Chrysler LH platform">
<text>The LH platform served as the basis for the Chrysler Concorde, Chrysler LHS, Chrysler 300M, Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision, and the final Chrysler New Yorker. A Plymouth to be called the &quot;Accolade&quot; was planned, but never saw production. The platform pioneered Chrysler&#x27;s &quot;cab-forward&quot; design; featured on some Chrysler, Dodge, and Eagle cars in the 1990s and early 2000s.

== Development ==
As the 1990s dawned, Chrysler faced a renewed round of financial troubles. The US economy slipped into a recession following the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash and the Savings and Loan Crisis, but the company&#x27;s main problems were due to a lack of engineering innovation and careless spending during the years of prosperity in the 1980s. Most of Chrysler&#x27;s lineup was based on the proven, but dated K-car platform, plus debt accumulated from expensive purchases including Italian automaker Lamborghini along with American Motors, and critics routinely criticized their inability to produce cars that were competitive with Japanese companies or Ford, which had just struck a coup-de-grace with the Taurus line. It was time for Chrysler to make a fresh start for the 1990s. The Board of Directors at Chrysler announced that Lee Iacocca would retire at the end of 1992. Iacocca was promoting Gerald Greenwald as his replacement, but that bought opposition. Although some suspected that he would later turn the leadership over to Bob Lutz, the board instead designated an outsider, the straitlaced Bob Eaton as the new chairman. With Chrysler facing an uncertain future in the late 1980s, engineering teams were now allowed to explore new designs that had been largely discouraged under Iacocca&#x27;s tenure.

The LH platform was based on the American Motors-developed and Renault-derived Eagle Premier. According to Bob Lutz, &quot;[t]he Premier had an excellent chassis and drove so damned well that it served as a benchmark for the LH ... the spiritual father, the genetic antecedent of the LH is the Premier.&quot; Like the Premier, the LH-cars featured a longitudinally-mounted engine with a front-wheel drive drivetrain, unusual in most U.S. front-wheel drive cars, but a hallmark of Renault&#x27;s designs. This arrangement meant that the design team had to use a chain to connect the automatic transmission with the front differential, a design reminiscent of the original Oldsmobile Toronado though subject to greater wear and noise.

The LH platform team was headed by François Castaing, who was previously responsible for product engineering and development at American Motors Corporation (AMC). Working with an engineering team of only 700, it took just over three years from the styling studio to the showrooms. To give focus for the platform engineering team, the benchmark target was the Eagle Premier.

Exterior styling was heavily influenced by another Chrysler design which debuted as the Lamborghini Portofino, a concept car introduced at the 1987 Frankfurt Auto Show.

The Dodge and Eagle LH cars competed directly against the Ford Taurus and other mid-size cars, largely replacing the K-based C-bodies. The Chrysler models competed with upmarket domestics such as Buick and Oldsmobile. The LH cars debuted in 1992 and were updated in 1997. The LH platform was replaced with the rear-wheel drive Chrysler LX platform for the 2005 model year. While Chrysler&#x27;s sales never rose to the levels of those popular rivals, the LH vehicles succeeded in altering Chrysler&#x27;s previously dowdy public image, recasting the automaker as an innovative design leader. The cab-forward look also influenced Chrysler&#x27;s subsequent compact PL (Chrysler Neon) and midsize JA platform car designs in the 1990s. 

Much as the company had done in the months leading up to the introduction of the K-platform cars in 1980, Chrysler referred directly to the LH platform in advertisements touting the advantages of its &quot;cab-forward&quot; architecture (generally meant to imply wheels moved out towards the corners of the body; a short, sloping hood; and a large windshield extending from its base over the front wheels), and also referred to the platform name for the Chrysler LHS sedan. Although the real &quot;gold mine&quot; of Chrysler&#x27;s acquisition of AMC was the Jeep brand, their minivans and LH sedans also helped to bail the company out of almost certain bankruptcy in the 1990s.

==First generation (1993–1997)==
The first generation LH cars used the existing 3.3 L OHV V6 as well as a new 3.5 L SOHC V6, with a four-speed automatic transmission as standard.

Cars built on the first version of the LH platform:
* 1993–1997 Chrysler Concorde
* 1993–1997 Dodge Intrepid
* 1993–1997 Eagle Vision
* 1994–1996 Chrysler New Yorker
* 1994–1997 Chrysler LHS

All versions shared a wheelbase. One year after the original three cars were introduced, the &quot;stretched&quot; LHS and New Yorker had different rear bodywork providing more overall length as well as a revised rear seat providing more legroom. 

Originally, Chrysler came close to giving Plymouth a variant of the LH platform, called the Plymouth Accolade, a name consistent with the then-current Plymouth Acclaim. It was to be a base model below the equipment level of the Intrepid. The Accolade never made it into production.

==Second generation (1998–2004)==

The second generation LH cars used the 2.7 L DOHC V6 and 3.2 L SOHC V6, as well as an updated version of the older 3.5 L, with a four-speed automatic transmission as standard.

Cars built on the second version of the LH platform:
* 1998–2004 Chrysler Concorde
* 1998–2004 Dodge Intrepid
* 1999–2001 Chrysler LHS
* 1999–2004 Chrysler 300M
* 2002–2004 Chrysler Concorde Limited

When Chrysler discontinued the Eagle brand after 1998, the Chrysler 300M was introduced which was originally intended as a replacement for the Eagle Vision. All models again shared a wheelbase of . The 300M was several inches shorter than Concorde, Intrepid, &amp; LHS, due to shorter front and rear overhangs in order to bring the car&#x27;s length under 5 meters.

==Media==
One episode of Robert Reich&#x27;s 1992 PBS miniseries &quot;Made In America&quot; focused on the then-yet-to-be-released LH&#x27;s development and its role in reversing Chrysler&#x27;s flagging fortunes. A camouflaged Dodge Intrepid is seen being put through the paces at Chrysler&#x27;s test track, along with concept sketches and other behind-the-scenes activities.

<text>&quot;A Little Peace and Quiet&quot; is the second segment of the first episode of the first season of the television series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. In this segment, a woman discovers a pendant which allows her to freeze time.

==Plot==
While digging in her garden, harried housewife Penny unearths a wooden box containing a gold pendant in the shape of a sundial. She discovers that saying &quot;shut up&quot; while wearing the pendant causes the entire world but herself to become frozen in time and saying &quot;start talking&quot; makes everything begin moving again. She uses this power to give herself much-needed reprieves from the demands of her dim-witted and hapless husband Russell and their four children: Janet and Susan, who are always fighting; Bertie, who is clumsy; and Russell Jr., who is always playing pranks. She also silences news programs about recent arms talks between the United States and the Soviet Union and moves door-to-door anti-nuclear weapons activists away from her house while they are frozen in time.

One evening, the radio announces that nuclear missiles are heading for the United States from the Soviet Union. When the radio reveals that ICBMs have entered U.S. airspace, the terrified Penny freezes time, then leaves her house and walks through town. As she notices terrified people looking skyward, she looks up to see a Soviet nuclear missile frozen a few hundred feet in the air, nose down, and moments from impact. She is left with a no-win choice: unfreeze time and die or live eternally alone in a silent world.

==Production==
No visual effects were used for the time stops; the actors and numerous extras, even the dog, all had to hold themselves perfectly still during these sequences. In the cases of characters who were frozen in off-balance positions (e.g. running or lunging), concealed armatures were used to support their weight. The mid-pour orange juice and mid-spill milk were both plastic.

Director Wes Craven said the child actors needed little encouragement to be rambunctious, being naturally full of energy. In conjunction with the exceptionally large cast, the set was always chaotic between takes.

Lead actress Melinda Dillon&#x27;s shouting &quot;Shut up!&quot; an extra two times as the nuclear missiles approach was unscripted. In the final scene, the two films playing in the theater when Penny stops time are &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; and &quot;Fail Safe.&quot; Both 1964 films depict nuclear warfare.

<text>A gold frame is an attachment to a military decoration which is issued by the militaries of some countries. The gold frame is designed to enclose an award ribbon and is usually a means of distinguishing the ribbon&#x27;s special quality or denoting some additional achievement to the award&#x27;s basic criteria.

The gold frame is normally an automatic attachment to a ribbon decoration. In certain cases, however, awards may be issued both with and without the gold frame depending upon the level of achievement. Such is the case in the United States Air Force which denotes the gold frame as a &quot;gold border&quot;. The Air Force Expeditionary Service Ribbon may be presented with a gold border when the decoration is presented for service in a designated combat zone.

The gold frame and gold border is a device for ribbon awards only, and there are no provisions for issuing the attachment for medals.

<text>&quot;Examination Day&quot; is the first segment of the sixth episode of the first season of the television series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. The segment is based on the short story &quot;Examination Day&quot; by Henry Slesar. The story was first published in &quot;Playboy&quot; (February 1958).

== Plot ==
Dickie Jordan is an intelligent and curious youth. He and his family live in a dystopian future. On Dickie&#x27;s twelfth birthday, he is required by law to undergo an intelligence examination. Dickie&#x27;s birthday wish is to do well on his exam. His parents appear stressed and avoid his questions. When the time comes, his father brings him to a government testing facility. There he is given a serum to ensure he tells the truth and given a series of intelligence assessment questions.

After the test is complete, Dickie&#x27;s parents are contacted by the government and told that Dickie&#x27;s intelligence exceeded the legal limit and so he was executed. The parents burst into tears as the government examiners ask them how they would like to handle their son&#x27;s remains: whether his body should be interred by the government, or if they would prefer a private burial.

== Reception ==
The &quot;Evening Independent&quot; wrote that the episode was &quot;a bit predictable, but the reason for the tragic climax was a shock&quot;.

<doc id="860291" wikidata="Q573836" url="?curid=860291" title="Button, Button (The Twilight Zone)">
<text>&quot;Button, Button&quot; is the second segment of the 20th episode of the first season of the revival of the television series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. The segment is based on the 1970 short story of the same name by Richard Matheson; the same short story forms the basis of the 2009 film &quot;The Box&quot;. It poses the question of whether an ordinary person would be willing to cause a total stranger to die in exchange for $200,000 ($1 million in &quot;The Box&quot;) by simply pushing a button. In a documentary on the making of the movie &quot;The Box&quot;, Matheson states the inspiration for the story came from his wife, whose college professor had asked a similar question as a way of promoting a class discussion.

Matheson, who was one of the most prolific contributors to the original &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, wrote the teleplay for the segment himself under a pseudonym, making &quot;Button, Button&quot; one of just two segments in the series written by one of the original &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; writers (the other being &quot;The Elevator&quot;).

==Plot==
Arthur and Norma Lewis live in a low-rent apartment and are descending into abject poverty. One day, a box with a button on top of it is delivered to their apartment. That evening, a man who introduces himself as Mr. Steward visits. He gives Norma the key to the box and explains that if she presses the button, someone she does not know will die, and she will receive $200,000 ().

Arthur and Norma wonder whether Steward&#x27;s proposal is genuine, and debate whether to press the button. They open the box and discover it is empty, with no mechanism that the button could activate, so Arthur throws it in the trash. However, after Arthur goes to bed, Norma retrieves the box from the dumpster. The next day, Arthur sees Norma sitting at the kitchen table transfixed by the button. He encourages her to push it just so she can get it off her mind. Finally, she pushes the button.

The next day, Mr. Steward returns to retrieve the box and deliver the $200,000. Steward says that the button will be &quot;reprogrammed&quot; and offered to someone else with the same terms and conditions adding as he focuses on Norma: &quot;&quot;I can assure you it will be offered to someone whom you don&#x27;t know&quot;.&quot; A horrified, knowing expression crosses Norma&#x27;s face.

==Short story==
&quot;Button, Button&quot; was first published in &quot;Playboy&quot;, June 1970. The story was republished as part of a collection of Matheson&#x27;s short stories.

In the original short story, the plot is resolved differently. Norma presses the button, and receives the money—after her husband dies in a train incident, where he is pushed onto the tracks. The money is the no-fault insurance settlement, which is $50,000 () rather than the $200,000 in the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode. A despondent Norma asks the stranger why her husband was the one who was killed. The stranger replies, &quot;Do you really think you knew your husband?&quot;

Matheson strongly disapproved of the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; version, especially the new ending, and used his pseudonym Logan Swanson for the teleplay.

==Film==
&quot;The Box&quot;, a feature film based on this story written and directed by Richard Kelly, starring Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, was released in 2009. Basil Hoffman, the actor who played Steward in the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode, appears in the film in a different role.

==Radio==
A radio-play version of the story is written by Henry Slesar, who also produced the radio program. As the &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot; 15th episode entitled &quot;The Chinaman Button&quot;, it was first broadcast Jan. 20, 1974. It was repeated at least twice on March 15, 1974, and again October 7, 1978.

In this version of the story, a man who is desperate for money is offered the chance to make a fortune. All he has to do is commit an anonymous murder, where he will not even have to see the victim. Actors for this radio play were Mason Adams, Paul Hecht, Evie Juster, Ralph Bell, and Will Hare.

<text>&quot;A Message From Charity&quot; is the second segment of the sixth episode of the first season from the television series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. In this segment, a pair of teenagers–one from 1700, and one from 1985–share a mental link across time.

==Plot==
Two teenagers–Peter Wood, an academically overachieving loner from 1985, and Charity Payne, a Puritan from 1700 Colonial Massachusetts, come in telepathic contact with each other when they have high fever from the same bacterial infection. After Peter convinces Charity she is not bedeviled, they find they enjoy each other&#x27;s conversation and remain in frequent contact as they go about their day. Peter is heartened to have made at least one friend, while Charity is intrigued by the future events and technologies he tells her about.

At Peter&#x27;s coaxing, Charity tells her neighbors about some of her &quot;future visions&quot;, including the American Revolution. The notion that the Thirteen Colonies will eventually revolt against their government is controversial, and a posse led by Squire Jonas Hacker visits Charity&#x27;s home to follow up on suspicions she is a witch. When Hacker tries to examine Charity for a witches&#x27; mark, she fears he intends to sexually molest her and flees.

Peter tells Charity to take refuge in a region less beset by panic over witchcraft, but she refuses to leave her home, so he searches library records of witch trials to see if she will be tried if she comes out of hiding. He instead stumbles on a biographical entry on Hacker, who was posthumously convicted of a double homicide. At her trial, Charity claims that her visions come not from witchcraft, but from a God-given second sight, and uses her knowledge of the murders to blackmail Hacker into supporting her claims. After her acquittal, Charity breaks off her relationship with Peter so that she will not risk getting into trouble again.

A year later, Peter receives one last telepathic call from Charity. She has left him a message at a local landmark known as Bear Rock. Peter finds Charity&#x27;s message: chiseled into Bear Rock are the initials &quot;CP + PW&quot; inside a heart shape.

==Production==
&quot;A Message from Charity&quot; is based on the short story of the same name by William M. Lee. The story was first published in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; (November 1967). In the original short story, Peter Wood is 16 years old while Charity Payne is 11 years old. The episode&#x27;s screenwriter, Alan Brennert, was worried this would come off as creepy and made the two characters the same age. He also added in the aspect of Peter being a loner who comes out of his shell thanks to his relationship with Charity; however, he resisted the producers&#x27; suggestion that he modernize the story by having Peter introduce Charity to elements of 1980s-specific pop culture.

Robert MacNaughton, who was known for his role as Elliott&#x27;s brother Michael in 1982 film &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, was initially cast in the role of Peter Wood, but dropped out shortly before filming was due to begin. The producers quickly scheduled a casting call to find a replacement, and Robert Duncan McNeill was offered the role and flown out to Los Angeles within a day of his audition, which had taken place in New York.

Actress Kerry Noonan originally auditioned for the part of Ursula Miller, but after reading the script, implored the casting directors to let her read for the lead role of Charity Payne as well. Noonan was ultimately passed up for both roles, and the part of Charity Payne was given to Justine Bateman, who had not auditioned but had been cast on the strength of her lead roles in a popular sitcom of the time and a television film. According to Brennert, Bateman (whom he did not name) had difficulty with the Puritan lingo and refused to take direction during the first two days of filming, which were devoted to shooting the 20th century scenes, with Bateman talking to McNeill from off-camera. Due to the extent of the problems with Bateman, Brennert felt the best solution was to recast the part, even though it was Friday and filming of the Charity scenes was scheduled to begin on Monday. The casting director recalled that Noonan had done a good reading for Charity, and at his suggestion she was called in for another audition. Noonan said the part came very naturally to her, since she was an avid reader of historical fiction, had played in a number of historical dramas in high school, and even used to role-play as a Puritan when she was a young child.

Though the Charity shots and Peter shots were mostly filmed separately, the scene where Peter washes his car while Charity gardens was filmed with Robert Duncan McNeill positioned at the edge of the field where Kerry Noonan was performing; the two instinctively shouted their lines to each other until they were directed to speak at a lower volume.

Airplanes were flying overhead during the filming of the trial scene, so all the dialogue for that scene had to be dubbed on afterwards.

<text>702 (pronounced &quot;seven-oh-two&quot;) is an American musical girl group whose most notable line-up consisted of Misha Grinstead, Irish Grinstead, and Meelah Williams. The group began their musical career as Sweeter than Sugar, formed in 1993 in Las Vegas. After years of limited success, the original quartet comprising Misha Grinstead, Irish Grinstead, Orish Grinstead, and Amelia Cruz were signed in 1995 to Biv 10 Records as 702. The group first had mainstream success following the release of their 1996 single, &quot;Steelo&quot;.

Spawning from their debut studio album &quot;No Doubt&quot; (1996), the song peaked within the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while the album received gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Their self-titled second album (1999) became their best-selling release, and contained the top-five single &quot;Where My Girls At?&quot;. Despite critical and commercial success, the group experienced lineup changes with Orish and Cruz being replaced by Meelah Williams and Tiffany Villarreal, respectively.

In mid-1996, Villarreal quit after a few months, leaving the group as a trio. In 2001, Cree Lemore replaced Williams after her departure from the group. This lineup released a single &quot;Pootie Tangin&#x27;&quot; before Lemore left and Williams re-joining the group. The group released their final album &quot;Star&quot; in 2003 and disbanded in 2006. The group reunited at 2017 Soul Train Music Awards. 702 has sold over 4 million records as of 2006.

==History==
===1993–1996: Early beginnings and Sweeter than Sugar===
LeMisha Grinstead wanted to pursue a solo career and with the support of her parents, she began performing in local competitions and churches. After performing in the lobby of Caesars Palace, she attracted the attention of actor/comedian Sinbad. Sinbad approached her parents with an opportunity in music, her parents encouraged their twin daughters Irish and Orish to perform alongside their sister LeMisha as a trio. Sinbad entered the quartet into a music competition in Atlanta under the group name Sweeter than Sugar. Although they finished second in the competition, Michael Bivins agreed to work with the group. They also added singer Amelia Cruz to the lineup. After signing the group to his record label Biv 10 Records, Bivins renamed the group &quot;702&quot;, after the area code for Las Vegas.

In November 1994, 702 debuted on Subway&#x27;s first single &quot;This Lil&#x27; Game We Play&quot;. The single peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 4 on Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It eventually became certified gold, selling over 500,000 copies in the United States of America. LeMisha, who sang lead vocals on the song, was the only one to go on tour with Subway in 1995. In 1995, 702 began recording their first album. During the recording of the album, Bivins dismissed Orish Grinstead and Amelia Cruz from the group because of his lack of support in their vocal abilities. They were replaced by classmates Meelah Williams (born Kameelah Williams) and Tiffany Villarreal. Six months after joining the group, Villarreal left the group during the recording of the first album, leaving 702 to continue as a trio.

===1996–1998: Rise to fame===

702 released their first album &quot;No Doubt&quot; in October 1996. &quot;No Doubt&quot; peaked at number eighty-two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number twenty-four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. It managed to sell over half of a million copies in the United States, earning a gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album&#x27;s singles &quot;Steelo&quot; and &quot;Get It Together reached the top twenty on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks. Both of the singles earned gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 1997, 702 became the opening act for New Edition&#x27;s &quot;Home Again Tour&quot;. In the same year, their album &quot;No Doubt&quot; won a Lady of Soul Award for &quot;Best R&amp;B/Soul Album, Group, Band, or Duo&quot; in 1997. Their single &quot;Get It Together&quot; was nominated for &quot;Best R&amp;B/Soul Single, Solo&quot; and &quot;Best R&amp;B/Soul Song of the Year&quot;, while the group was nominated for &quot;Best R&amp;B/Soul or Rap New Artist&quot;.

&quot;Steelo&quot; became the theme song to the Nickelodeon television show &quot;Cousin Skeeter&quot; in 1998. In the same year, 702 made cameo appearances in the sitcoms &quot;Sister, Sister&quot; and &quot;Moesha&quot;. In March 1998, Missy Elliott released a single &quot;Beep Me 911&quot; which featured 702. The song charted in the top twenty on the UK Singles chart.

During that time, she sang backup and wrote three songs for Faith Evans&#x27; album, &quot;Faithfully&quot;. She also sang backup for Missy Elliott&#x27;s song &quot;Take Away&quot;, the third single from her 2001 album &quot;Miss E...So Addictive&quot;.

==Artistry==
702 recorded R&amp;B songs with styles that encompass rap, soul, contemporary, gospel, and jazz. In the group&#x27;s original lineup, LeMisha was the lead vocalist, Irish was on alto, Orish and Amelia were on soprano. After the lineup change, LeMisha later alternated as second soprano and alternate lead vocalist in the group&#x27;s trio lineup as Meelah often sang lead for the majority of their songs. In their first album &quot;No Doubt&quot; (1996), each member sings lead in the majority of the songs. Williams, however, completely led songs like &quot;Steelo&quot; and &quot;Get It Together&quot;. The group explored themes of women&#x27;s empowerment in songs such as &quot;Where My Girls At?&quot; and &quot;Better Day (Ghetto Girl)&quot;.

==Legacy==
702 have been recognized as one of the most influential female R&amp;B groups of the 1990s. 702&#x27;s final lineup as a trio has been widely noted as the group&#x27;s most recognizable and successful lineup, having sold over 4 million records worldwide.

The group&#x27;s single &quot;Where My Girls At?&quot; (1999) was ranked number 46 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time&quot;, ranked number 72 on their &quot;The 99 Greatest Songs of 1999&quot; list, and was listed on their &quot;Greatest of All Time Top Songs of the 90s&quot; list. The term &quot;Steelo&quot; became popularized by 702&#x27;s single of the same name as a slang word for &quot;style&quot;.

<doc id="860304" wikidata="Q313843" url="?curid=860304" title="Nikola Pašić">
<text>Nikola Pašić (, ; 18 December 1845 – 10 December 1926) was a Serbian and Yugoslav politician and diplomat. During his political career, which spanned almost five decades, he served five times as prime minister of Serbia and three times as prime minister of Yugoslavia, leading 22 governments in total. He played an instrumental role in the founding of Yugoslavia and is considered one of the most influential figures in Serbian twentieth-century history. With 12 years in office, Pašić was the longest-serving prime minister of Serbia.

Born in Zaječar, in eastern Serbia, Pašić studied engineering in Switzerland and embraced radical politics as a student at the Polytechnical School in Zürich. On his return to Serbia, he was elected to the National Assembly in 1878 as a member of the People&#x27;s Radical Party, which was formally organised three years later. After the failed Timok Rebellion against the government of King Milan I, he was sentenced to death but narrowly avoided capture and execution. He spent the next six years exiled in Bulgaria. Following Milan&#x27;s abdication in 1889, Pašić returned to Serbia and was elected president of the National Assembly. A year later he also became mayor of Belgrade. In 1891, Pašić became prime minister for the first time, but was forced to resign the following year.

Following the May Coup and the murder of King Alexander I, Pašić emerged as a leading figure in Serbian politics while the Radical Party established its dominance. He served as prime minister from 1904 to 1905, 1906 to 1908, 1909 to 1911 and finally from 1912 to 1918, as Serbia entered a golden age of economic growth and growing influence on the continental stage. He led Serbia to victory in the Balkan Wars against the Ottomans and Bulgaria, almost doubling the size of Serbian territories. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand brought Serbia to war with Austria-Hungary, sparking the First World War in which the country was overrun by the Central Powers. Pašić led the government in exile in the Greek island of Corfu, where the Corfu Declaration was signed and paved the way for a future state of South Slavs.

In 1918, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was officially proclaimed, and Pašić was recognised as the &quot;de facto&quot; prime minister of the new state. Despite his resignation just a month later, he took part in the Paris Peace Conference as the Serbian representative. He served as prime minister on two more occasions, from 1921 to July 1924 and from November 1924 to 1926. During his final tenure, he oversaw the creation of the kingdom&#x27;s first constitution. He died of a heart attack in late 1926, at age 80. A proponent of populism, nationalism, and political pragmatism, Pašić began his career as a socialist but became a conservative in the 1910s.

==Early life==
Pašić was born in Zaječar, Principality of Serbia. According to Slovenian ethnologist Niko Županič, Pašić&#x27;s ancestors migrated from the Tetovo region in the 16th century and founded the village of Zvezdan near Zaječar. Pašić himself said that his ancestors settled from the area of the Lešok Monastery in Tetovo. Jovan Dučić concluded that Pašić hailed from Veliki Izvor near Zaječar, and that Pašić&#x27;s ancestry in Tetovo had been long lost. Bulgarian ethnologist Stilian Chilingirov stated that Pašić&#x27;s roots were from the village of Veliki Izvor, founded during the 18th century by refugees from the Ottoman Bulgarian village of Golyam Izvor in Teteven area in today&#x27;s Bulgaria. Ljubomir Miletić also claimed that Pašić&#x27;s grandfather settled in Veliki Izvor from Teteven area, which was refuted by Serbian authors, claiming his parents were both born in Zaječar. However, the village of Veliki Izvor, was really founded by refugees from the village of Golyam Izvor, Teteven area. Carlo Sforza mentioned that Pašić &quot;was lucky in another respect, he belonged to the Shopi community&quot;. There also are claims attributing Aromanian descent to Pašić.

Pašić completed elementary school in Zaječar, and finished his gymnasium work in Negotin and Kragujevac. In the fall of 1865, he enrolled in the Belgrade Higher School and in 1867 received a state scholarship to study railroad engineering at the Polytechnical School in Zürich. Historian Gale Stokes wrote that Pašić was a &quot;serious student&quot; who &quot;went beyond the required subjects of his specialization&quot;. According to Stokes, Pašić&#x27;s early socialist ideals were shaped by German experiences rather than Marxist or Russian populism, as his studies were focused on German history and contemporary events which were taught by Germanophile professors. He graduated as an engineer but, apart from his brief participation in the construction of the Vienna–Budapest railroad, he never worked in this field.

==Radical Party==
===Origins===
While a student in Zürich, Pašić lived near other Serbian students and became politically involved, initially as an organizer. Some of these students would later become the core of the Socialist and Radical movement in Serbia. One of them was Svetozar Marković, who would become a major socialist ideologue in Serbia. Along with Marković, Pera Velimirović, Jovan Žujović, and others, Pašić became an early member of the &quot;Radical Party&quot;.

After returning to Serbia, Pašić went to Bosnia to support the anti-Ottoman uprising of Nevesinjska puška. The Socialists started publishing &quot;Samouprava&quot; which later became the official bulletin of the Radical Party. After Marković&#x27;s death in 1875, Pašić became the leader of the movement and in 1878 was elected to the National Assembly of Serbia, even before the party was formed. In 1880, he made an unprecedented move in the Serbian political scene by forming an opposition deputies&#x27; club in the assembly. Finally, a party program was completed in January 1881 and the Radical Party, the first systematically organized Serbian party, was officially established, with Pašić elected its first president.

===Timok Rebellion===

The party and Pašić quickly gained popularity; the Radicals received 54 percent of the vote in the September 1883 elections, while the Progressive Party, favored by King Milan Obrenović IV only got 30 percent. Despite the Radicals&#x27; clear victory, the pro-Austrian king, who disliked the pro-Russian Pašić and the Radical party, nominated old non-partisan hardliner Nikola Hristić to form a government. The assembly refused to cooperate and the session was suspended.

The atmosphere was made worse when Hristić attempted to take away peasants&#x27; guns, in order to establish a regular army. As a result, clashes began in eastern Serbia, in the Timok valley. King Milan blamed the unrest on the Radicals and sent troops to crush the rebellion. Pašić was sentenced to death in absentia and he narrowly avoided arrest by fleeing to Hungary. Twenty-one others were sentenced to death and executed, and 734 more were imprisoned.

===Exile in Bulgaria===
For the next six years, Pašić lived with relatives in Bulgaria, supported by the Bulgarian government. He lived in Sofia, where he worked as a building contractor, and also worked for a short time in the Ministry of Interior. According to Bulgarian sources, he spoke quite fluent Bulgarian, but mixed it with a large number of Serbian words and phrases, and it is claimed that he asked Petko Karavelov&#x27;s friends who hailed from Stara Planina about the characteristics of that region in Bulgaria, explaining that his ancestors had migrated from there to Serbia some generations before.

Bulgarian testimonies completely differ in one important respect, whether Pašić worked actively in politics during his exile in Sofia. The official Bulgarian support became one of several reasons for Milan&#x27;s decision to start the Serbo-Bulgarian War in 1885. After suffering a decisive defeat, Milan granted an amnesty for those sentenced for the Timok rebellion, but not for Pašić, who remained in Bulgarian exile. In 1889, Milan abdicated in favor of his 12-year-old son Alexander. A few days later the newly formed Radical cabinet of Sava Grujić pardoned Pašić.

==High politics 1890–1903==
===President of assembly and mayor===
On 13 October 1889, Pašić was elected president of the National Assembly, a duty he would perform (&quot;de jure&quot; though, not &quot;de facto&quot;) until 9 January 1892. He was also elected mayor of Belgrade from 11 January 1890 to 26 January 1891. His presiding over the assembly saw the largest number of laws being voted in the history of Serbian parliamentarism, while as the mayor of Belgrade he was responsible for cobbling the muddy city streets. He was reelected twice as president of the National Assembly from 13 June 1893 to April 1895 (though from September 1893 only in name; his deputy Dimitrije Katić acted for him) and 12 July 1897 to 29 June 1898 and once more mayor of Belgrade 22 January 1897 to 25 November 1897.

After wisely not accepting to head the government immediately after his return from exile, Nikola Pašić became prime minister for the first time on 23 February 1891. However, ex-king Milan returned to Serbia in May 1890 and again began campaigning against Pašić and the Radicals. On 16 June 1892, Kosta Protić, one of three regents during the minority of Alexander I, died. Under the constitution, the National Assembly was to elect a new regent, but as the assembly was on several months&#x27; vacation, Pašić had to call for an emergency session. Jovan Ristić, the most powerful regent, fearing Pašić might be elected co-regent and thus undermine his position, refused to allow the extra session, and Pašić resigned as prime minister on 22 August 1892. During his tenure, he was also foreign minister from 2 April 1892 and acting finance minister from 3 November 1891.

===Alexander&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état===
In 1893, though still only 16 years old, King Alexander declared himself of age and dismissed the regents who had governed since 1889. He named moderate Radical Lazar Dokić to form a government. Though he received approval from some members of the Radical party to participate in the government, Pašić refused. To exclude him from the political scene in Serbia, Alexander sent Pašić as his extraordinary envoy to Russia in 1893–1894. In 1894, Alexander brought his father back to Serbia. In 1896, the king managed to force Pašić to back off from pushing for constitutional reforms. However, since 1897 both kings, Milan and Alexander, had ruled almost jointly. As both disliked Pašić, in 1898 they had him imprisoned for nine months because &quot;Samouprava&quot; published a statement about his previous opposition to King Milan. Pašić claimed he was misquoted, with no effect.

===Ivandan&#x27;s assassination attempt===
Former fireman, Đura Knežević, who was sentenced to death, tried to assassinate ex-king Milan in June 1899 (Serbian: &quot;Ивандањски атентат&quot;). The same evening, Milan declared that the Radical Party tried to kill him and all heads of the Radical Party were arrested, including Pašić who had just been released from prison from his previous sentence. The accusations that the Radicals or Pašić were linked to the assassination attempt were unfounded. Still, Milan insisted that Nikola Pašić and Kosta Taušanović be sentenced to death. Austria-Hungary feared that the execution of the pro-Russian Pašić would force Russia to intervene, abandoning an 1897 agreement to leave Serbia in status quo. A special envoy was sent from Vienna to Milan to warn him that Austria-Hungary would boycott the Obrenović dynasty if Pašić was executed. Noted Serbian historian Slobodan Jovanović later claimed that the entire assassination was staged so that Milan could get rid of the Radical Party.

Imprisoned and unaware of Austria-Hungary&#x27;s interference, Pašić confessed that the Radical Party had been disloyal to the dynasty, which probably saved many people from prison. As part of the deal reached with the interior minister Đorđe Genčić, the government officially left its own role out of the statement, so that it appeared that Pašić behaved cowardly and succumbed to the pressure. Pašić was sentenced to five years but released immediately. This caused future conflict within the Radical Party as younger members considered Pašić a coward and traitor, and split from the party. For the remainder of Alexander&#x27;s rule, Pašić retired from politics. Although the young monarch disliked Pašić, he was often summoned for consultations but would refrain from giving advice and insist that he was no longer involved with politics.

==Golden age of democracy 1903–1914==
===Royal assassination===

Nikola Pašić was not among the conspirators who plotted to assassinate King Alexander. The assassination occurred on the night of , and both the King and Queen Draga Mašin were killed, as well as Prime Minister Dimitrije Cincar-Marković and Defence Minister Milovan S. Pavlović. The Radical Party did not form the first cabinet after the coup d&#x27;état, but after winning the elections on 4 October 1903, they remained in almost uninterrupted power for the next 15 years.

In the beginning, the Radicals opposed the appointment of a new king, Peter I Karađorđević, calling his appointment illegal. But Pašić later changed his mind after seeing how people willingly accepted the new monarch as well as King Peter I, educated in Western Europe, was a democratic, mild ruler, unlike the last two despotic and erratic Obrenović sovereigns. In the next two decades, the major clash between the king and the prime minister would be Pašić&#x27;s refusal to raise to royal appanage.

Nikola Pašić became foreign minister on 8 February 1904 in Sava Grujić&#x27;s cabinet and headed a government under his own presidency 10 December 1904 to 28 May 1905, continuing as foreign minister as well. During the following decade, under the leadership of Pašić and the Radical Party, Serbia grew so prosperous that many historians call this period the &quot;modern golden age of Serbia&quot;. The country evolved into a European democracy and with financial and economic growth, political influence also grew which caused constant problems with Serbia&#x27;s largest neighbour, Austria-Hungary, which even developed plans to turn Serbia into one of its provinces (already in 1879 German chancellor Otto von Bismarck said that Serbia was the stumbling-block in Austria&#x27;s development). 

===Austro-Hungarian customs war===
As Austro-Hungarian latent provocations of Serbia concerning Serbs living in Bosnia and Herzegovina, officially still part of the Ottoman Empire but occupied by Austria-Hungary since 1878 and causing problems to Serbian exports which mainly went through Austria-Hungary (as Serbia was landlocked) didn&#x27;t bring results, Austria-Hungary began a customs war in 1906. Pašić formed another cabinet from 30 April 1906 to 20 July 1908. Pressured by the Austro-Hungarian government which asked from Serbia to buy everything from Austrian companies, from salt to cannons, he replied to Austrian government that he personally would do that, but that the National Assembly was against this. 

Austria-Hungary closed the borders which did cause a severe blow to the Serbian economy initially, but later it will bounce back even more developed than it was, thanks to the Pašić swift change towards the Western European countries. He forced conspirators of the 1903 coup into retirement which was a condition for reestablishing diplomatic connections with the United Kingdom, he bought cannons from France, etc. In the midst of the customs war, Austria-Hungary officially annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908 which caused mass protests in Serbia and political instability, but Pašić managed to calm the situation down. In this period, Pašić&#x27;s major ally, Imperial Russia, was not much of a help, being defeated by Japan in the Russo-Japanese War and facing domestic political instability.

===Balkan Wars===

Pašić formed two more cabinets (24 October 1909 to 4 July 1911 and from 12 September 1912). He was one of the major players in the formation of the Balkan League which later resulted in the First Balkan War (1912–13) and the Second Balkan War (1913) which almost doubled the size of Serbia with the territories of what was at the time considered &quot;Old Serbia&quot; (Kosovo, Metohija and Vardar Macedonia), retaken from the Ottomans after five centuries. He clashed with some military structures about the handling of the newly acquired territories. Pašić believed the area should be included into the Serbian political and administrative system through the democratic elections, while the Royal Serbian Army sought to keep the areas under the military control. After one year of tensions Pašić dismissed the military administrator of Old Serbia and scheduled new elections for 1914 but the outbreak of World War I prevented it.

===Outbreak of the Great War===
After the Assassination in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914 when members of the Serbian revolutionary organization Young Bosnia assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir-apparent Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the Austro-Hungarian government immediately accused the Serbian government of being behind the assassination. The general consensus today is that government did not organize it, but how much Pašić knew about it is still a controversial issue and it appears that every historian has his or her own opinion on the subject: Pašić knew nothing (Ćorović); Pašić knew &quot;something&quot; is about to happen and told Russia that Austria would attack Serbia before the assassination (Dragnić); Pašić knew but as the assassins were connected to the powerful members of the Serbian intelligence, was afraid to do anything about it personally so he warned Vienna (Balfour).

According to Ljubomir Jovanović, who was the minister of education at the time, Nikola Pašić was at least partially aware of the preparations for the assassination of Austro-Hungarian heir Francis Ferdinand, which were carried out by members of the Young Bosnia. In his essay, a contribution to the memorial book &quot;The Bood of Slavdom&quot; () published on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War in 1924, Jovanović states that &quot;at the end of May or the beginning of June&quot; in 1914 Pašić told some members of his government that some people &quot;were preparing to go to Sarajevo and murder Francis Ferdinand, who was to be solemnly received there on St. Vitus&#x27;s Day.&quot;

Austria-Hungary presented him the July Ultimatum, written together with the envoys of the German ambassadors in such a vein that it would be unlikely for the Serbian government to accept. After extensive consultations in the country itself and formidable pressure from outside to accept it, Pašić told the Austrian ambassador Wladimir Giesl von Gieslingen (who had already packed his bags) that Serbia accepted all the ultimatum demands except that Austrian police could independently travel throughout Serbia and &quot;conduct&quot; their own investigation. Austria-Hungary answered by formally declaring war on Serbia on 28 July 1914.

==World War I and Yugoslavia==
===Glory, defeat and the South Slav state===

Serbian defeat was considered to be imminent, at least by external onlookers, compared to the strength of the Austria-Hungary. Serbia had obviously prepared well, however, and after a series of battles in 1914–1915 (Battle of Cer, Battle of Kolubara), the loss and recapture of Belgrade, and a Serbian counter-offensive with occupation of some Austrian territories (in Syrmia and eastern Bosnia), the Austro-Hungarian Army backed off. On 5 July 1914, things changed as old King Peter I relinquished his duties to the heir apparent Alexander, making him his regent.

On 17 September 1914, Pašić and Albanian leader Essad Pasha Toptani signed in Niš the secret Treaty of Serbian-Albanian Alliance. The treaty had 15 points which focused on setting up joint Serbian-Albanian political and military institutions, as well as a military alliance between Albania and Serbia. The treaty also envisaged building of the rail-road to Durrës, financial and military support of the Kingdom of Serbia to Essad Pasha&#x27;s position as Albanian ruler and drawing of the demarcation line by a special Serbo-Albanian commission. In October 1914, Essad Pasha returned to Albania. With Italian and Serbian financial backing, he established armed forces in Dibër and captured the interior of Albania and Durrës. Pašić ordered that his followers be aided with money and arms.

Unlike Peter, Alexander was not a democratic spirit, rather a dictatorial one and personally disliked Pašić and talk of democracy. Open strife began very soon, when Serbia was proposed the London Pact by which it was supposed to expand into most of the ethnic Serbian territories to the west, including a section of the Adriatic coast and some ethnic Albanian territories in northern Albania. In return, Serbia was supposed to relinquish part of Vardar Macedonia to Bulgaria so that the latter would enter the war on the Entente side. Both Pašić and Prince-regent Alexander were against this as they considered it to be the betrayal of the Croatians, Slovenians and Serbian sacrifices in the Balkan Wars, as negotiations for the future South Slav state already began. However, Pašić and King Peter were not personally much for the Yugoslav idea, unlike the regent who pushed the issue for creating as large a state as possible. Serbia refused the pact and was attacked by Austria-Hungary, Germany and Bulgaria. The Government and the army retreated to the south in the direction of Greece, but were cut off by Bulgarian forces and had to go through Albania and to the Greek island of Corfu where the Corfu Declaration was signed in 1917 preparing the ground for the future South Slav state of Yugoslavia.

===Creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes===
The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (SHS) was officially proclaimed on 1 December 1918, and, being the Prime Minister of Serbia at that time, Pašić was generally considered the &quot;de facto&quot; Prime Minister of the new South Slav state, as well. The political agreement was reached that Pašić would continue on as Prime Minister when the first government of the new state was to be formed, but as a result of his longtime dislike of Pašić, Prince-regent Alexander nominated Stojan Protić to form the government. Consequently, Pašić stepped down on 20 December 1918.

Despite being removed from the government, as the most experienced of politicians, Nikola Pašić was the main negotiator for the new state at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. In an effort to secure the maximalist agenda of the regent, he did not push on the question of the Czech Corridor, Timișoara, and Szeged, managed to secure borders with Albania and Bulgaria, but failed to annex Fiume (which became an independent state) and most of Carinthia (which remained part of Austria). At the time when Benito Mussolini was willing to modify the Treaty of Rapallo, which cut off a quarter of Slovene ethnic territory from the remaining three-quarters of Slovenes living in the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, in order to annex the Free State of Fiume to Italy, Pašić&#x27;s attempts to correct the borders at Postojna and Idrija were undermined by Prince-regent Alexander preferring &quot;good relations&quot; with Italy.

Elections held on 28 November 1920 showed that the Radical Party was the second strongest in the country, having just one seat less than the Democratic Party (91 to 92, respectively, out of 419 seats). However, Pašić managed to form a coalition and became Prime Minister again on 1 January 1921.

Pašić became a very large landowner in the country due to expropriation of Albanian land in Kosovo and other areas.

===Vidovdan Constitution===

As soon as talks about the constitution of the new state began, two diametrically opposite sides, Serbian and Croatian, were established. Both Pašić and Prince-regent Alexander wanted a unitary state but for different reasons. Pašić considered that the Serbs could be outvoted in such a state and that an unconsolidated and heterogeneous entity would fall apart if it was a federal one, while the prince-regent simply didn&#x27;t like to share power with others, which was shown 8 years later when he conducted a coup d&#x27;état.

Stjepan Radić, a leading Croatian politician for a joint Serbian-Croatian state would be a temporary solution on the way to Croatian independence, asked for a federal republic. As Pašić had majority in the assembly, a new constitution was proclaimed on Vidovdan (St. Vitus day), 28 June 1921, organizing the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes as a parliamentary (albeit highly unitary) monarchy, abolishing even the remaining shreds of autonomy which had Slovenia, Croatia, Dalmatia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Vojvodina (provincial governments). In the early 1920s, the Yugoslav government of Prime Minister Pašić used police pressure over voters and ethnic minorities, confiscation of opposition pamphlets and other measures of election rigging to keep the opposition, mainly the autonomy-minded Croats, in minority in the Yugoslav parliament.

During his career as prime minister in the interwar period, Pašić continued to play the role of an important diplomatic negotiator in bilateral talks with neighboring countries. Among his most important foreign policy successes in this period was the settlement of disputes with Bulgaria. A Balkan correspondent of The Times wrote in 1925 that the crown of Pašić&#x27;s long political career was &quot;the successful promotion of a Serbo-Bulgar understanding&quot;. He also stated that Pašić&#x27; personal characteristics and experience in Bulgaria, where he spent his exile, contributed to that success: &quot;No South Slav is more fitted to accomplish this arduous feat than the old statesman from the Serb marches, who speaks Serb with a Bulgar accent and in his middle age was a political exile in Bulgaria&quot;.

Pašić remained prime minister until 8 April 1926, with a short break 27 July 1924 to 6 November 1924, when the government was headed by Ljuba Davidović. After relinquishing temporarily the post to his party colleague Nikola Uzunović, Pasic attempted in 1926 to regain his job. Now a king, Alexander refused to reappoint Pašić using as a pretext the scandals of Pašić&#x27;s son Rade. The following day, on 10 December 1926, Nikola Pašić suffered a heart attack and died in Belgrade, at age 80. He was interred in Belgrade&#x27;s New Cemetery. Milenko Vesnić is interred to the right of Pašić&#x27;s grave and Janko Vukotić is interred to the left of the grave.

==Private life==

Nikola Pašić married Đurđina Duković, daughter of a wealthy Serbian grains trader from Trieste. They were married in the Russian church in Florence to avoid the gathering of the numerous Serbian colony in Trieste and had three children: son Radomir-Rade and daughters Dara and Pava. Radomir-Rade had two sons: Vladislav, an architect (died 1978) and (1918–2015), an Oxford University law graduate who resided in Toronto, Canada, where he founded a Serbian National Academy.

==Legacy==

A central square in Belgrade is named after him, Square of Nikola Pašić (Serbian: &quot;Трг Николе Пашића&quot;/&quot;Trg Nikole Pašića&quot;). During the Communist regime, the square was named after Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. The 4.2 meter tall bronze statue of Pašić stands in the square, overlooking the building of the assembly. He is included in The 100 most prominent Serbs. Pašić was awarded the Russian Order of the White Eagle with brilliants, the Order of Carol I of Romania and Order of Karađorđe&#x27;s Star.

==Media portrayals==
*In 1995 television miniseries &quot;The End of Obrenović Dynasty&quot;, Nikola Pašić was portrayed by actor Petar Kralj.
*&quot;The Last Audience&quot;, a television miniseries based on the biography of Nikola Pašić and directed by George Kadijevich, was produced in 2008 by the Serbian broadcasting service RTS.

<text>&quot;The Elves and The Shoemaker&quot; (German: &quot;Die Wichtelmänner&quot;) is a set of fairy tales collected by the Brothers Grimm (KHM 39) about a poor shoemaker who receives much-needed help from three young helpful elves.

The original story is the first of three fairy tales contained as entry 39 in the German &quot;Grimm&#x27;s Fairy Tales&quot; under the common title &quot;Die Wichtelmänner&quot;. In her translation of 1884 Margaret Hunt chose The Elves as title for these three stories.

The first tale is of Aarne-Thompson (AT) type 503* (&#x27;Helpful Elves&#x27;), also classified as a migratory legend (AT-7015). The second is of AT 476* type (&#x27;A Widwife [or Godmother] for the Elves&#x27;), also categorized as a migratory legend (AT 5070). The third tale is of AT 504 type (&#x27;The Changeling&#x27;), also categorized as a migratory legend (AT 5085).

== Origin ==
The set of related tales was published by the Brothers Grimm in the first edition of &quot;Kinder- und Hausmärchen&quot; (1812), as tale no. 39. Their versions of the three stories are based upon the accounts of Gretchen Wild (1787–1819).

In the first edition, the three stories are subtitled &quot;The Shoemaker for Whom They Did Work&quot;, &quot;The Servant Girl Who Stood In as Godmother for Them&quot;, and &quot;The Woman Whose Child They Exchanged&quot;, respectively, although the Grimms did not give titles to the individual tales in later editions.

==Story==

=== First tale ===
A poor hardworking shoemaker had so little leather that he could only make a single pair of shoes. One evening, leaving the pair with the work unfinished, he went to bed and commended himself to God. After waking up the following day and saying his prayers, he found the shoes finished and perfectly well-made on his workbench. A customer soon entered the store and offered more than the usual price, for he was fond of the pair. 
The shoemaker uses the money to buy leather for more shoes which, after cutting, he also leaves overnight. Again the materials are made into beautiful shoes by morning. In this manner, his situation improves until he is comfortable again.

One evening, shortly before Christmas, the shoemaker said to his wife, &quot;Why don&#x27;t we stay up tonight and see who is giving us this helping hand,&quot; and his wife agreed. Hiding in the corner of the room, they saw two little men working quickly and nimbly on the shoes, then running away after their work was finished.

The next morning, his wife said, &quot;The little men have made us wealthy. We must show them our thanks. They are running around with nothing on, freezing.&quot; She proposed to make clothes, and the shoemaker agreed to make a pair of shoes for each of them. The two of them did not stop until they had finished the work, then hid themselves again. The following night, the couple saw the little men delighted as they tried the beautiful little clothes and shoes; they danced out of the house and never returned, but the shoemaker prospered in his business.

=== Second tale ===
A poor hardworking servant girl was sweeping out the house and shaking the sweepings onto a large pile when she found a letter on the pile. Since she could not read, the servant took the letter to her masters. They told her that she had been invited to an elf baptism and asked to become the godmother of the child. The girl hesitated at first, but her master finally convinced her to accept.

Then the servant girl was led by the elves to their hollow mountain, where everything was smaller but also more splendidly ornamented. The girl helped with the baptism and asked to leave, but the elves convinced her to stay three days with them. The elves did everything to make her happy during those three days, but the girl again asked to leave. The little men gave her gold and let her leave their mountain. When she returned home, the servant girl learned that she did not spend three days with elves but seven years. Meanwhile, her former masters had died.

=== Third tale ===
A woman had her child taken from the cradle by elves and substituted with a changeling. Her neighbour advised her to set the changeling on the hearth, make a fire, and boil water in two eggshells: that should make the changeling laugh, and if he laughs it will be all over with him. The woman did everything her neighbour had said, and the changeling started to laugh about her cooking in shells. Then a band of little elves suddenly appeared, brought the rightful child, set it on the hearth, and took the changeling away.

==&quot;Elves&quot;==
Although the supernatural creatures are translated as &quot;elves&quot; in English, they are called &quot;Wichtelmänner&quot; (&quot;&#x27;&quot;-men&#x27;) in the German original. &quot;Wicht&quot; is cognate with &quot;wight&quot; in English and &quot;vættr&quot; in Old Norse, all stemming from Proto-Germanic *&quot;&quot; or *&quot;wehtiz&quot; (&#x27;thing, creature&#x27;).

==Cultural legacy==

Friz Freleng created a musical adaption of the story for his 1946 Merrie Melodies cartoon &quot;Holiday for Shoestrings&quot;. Four years later, Tex Avery adapted the story for his 1950 MGM cartoon short &quot;The Peachy Cobbler&quot;. The 1956 Looney Tunes cartoon short &quot;Yankee Dood It&quot; is based on this fairy tale, with Elmer Fudd as the king of industrial elves. 150 years after this fairy tale took place, he visits the shoemaker to retrieve the elves he has employed, while also imparting the virtues of mass production capitalism to him. The same basic plot was also used in the 1946 cartoon short &quot;Holiday for Shoestrings&quot;. The 1962 film &quot;The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm&quot; features a segment based on the story. In the 1994 &quot;Due South&quot; episode, &quot;The Deal&quot;, Det. Ray Vecchio vaguely recollects this story when talking with Constable Benton Fraser about a poor cobbler. In &quot;&quot;, a spinoff miniseries of the Vertigo comic-book series &quot;Fables&quot;, the shoemaker appears as an employee in Cinderella&#x27;s shoe store, while the elves are the builders and suppliers of the store&#x27;s inventory.

&quot;Muppet Classic Theater&quot; had a version where a shoemaker (played by Kermit the Frog) faces ruin until his livelihood is saved by a group of philanthropic entertainers, The Elvises, who, naturally, make only blue suede shoes. In a Barney &amp; Friends episode called &quot;If the Shoe Fits...&quot;, the kids are rehearsing for their play about this story. The second season of the animated series &quot;Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child&quot; features a South American twist of the tale&quot;.&quot; In the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series of books, &quot;house elves&quot; are enslaved creatures who take care of the needs of human wizards, and are free of their obligation once given clothes. In the TV show Supernatural, the season 6 episode Clap Your Hands If You Believe has a variation of the tale, of a watchmaker and some fairies.

In Jane Shields and Rosemary Doyle&#x27;s &quot;The Shoemaker and the Pantomimes&quot; Cinderella goes looking for elves to help her father in his obligation to the evil designer Kenneth Coal, but all she ends up with are Mimes, a resourceful mother Twanky, and an even more resourceful cat. Premiered Red Sandcastle Theatre, Toronto, 2012. The fairytale is alluded to in two episodes of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;. In The Extract Obliteration, Leonard Hofstadter mentions it to Penny after he does her essay for her. In The Bus Pants Utilization, Sheldon greets Leonard in the morning with &quot;Good morning, Shoemaker&quot;, in reference to the fact that he has been up all night working on Leonard&#x27;s differential equations app project. In the 2003 Christmas movie &quot;Elf&quot;, shoe making is one of the jobs for elves.

Jim La Marche retold and illustrated his version of the story in 2003, published by Chronicle Books.

&quot;The Grimm Variations&quot;, a 2024 Netflix anime series, features a retelling of the story. This version features a struggling novelist who wakes up to find someone has completed stories he was writing. One of the books written is entitled &quot;The Elves and the Shoemaker&quot;.

<text>&quot;A Small Talent for War&quot; is the second segment of the fifteenth episode of the first season of the television series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. In this segment, an advanced alien race claims to have created human beings and proposes to wipe them out unless they change their ways.

==Plot==
The scene is set with the United Nations Security Council bickering between nations over how to respond to the appearance of an extraterrestrial vessel near the council building.

An ambassador from an alien race then appears to them and claims that his race seeded life on Earth millions of years earlier. He tells them that his race is displeased with humanity&#x27;s &quot;small talent for war,&quot; as they have failed to produce the potential that the aliens had nurtured, and his fleet will destroy all life on Earth. The Security Council pleads for and is granted a 24-hour reprieve to prove humanity&#x27;s worth.

The Security Council and the General Assembly negotiate an accord for lasting global peace and present it to the alien ambassador. He is amused at the peace accord and explains that his race was, in fact, seeking a &quot;greater&quot; talent for war, as they had genetically seeded thousands of planets to breed warriors to fight for them across the galaxy. They perceived humanity&#x27;s conflicts as erratic and clumsy, weapons as crude and primitive, and longing for peace as a fatal flaw. As the ambassador calls down his fleet to destroy Earth, he praises the Security Council for the amusing day, commenting that while war is their goal, good humor is an even more difficult talent to master.

<text>Richard Sheepshanks (30 July 1794 – 4 August 1855) was a British astronomer.

==Personal life==
Sheepshanks was born on 30 July 1794, in Leeds, the son of Joseph Sheepshanks, a Leeds textile manufacturer of the well-to-do Sheepshank family of Bilton, Harrogate. His brother was John Sheepshanks (clothing manufacturer and art collector), and his sister was Anne Sheepshanks (astronomical benefactor). He received his education at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in 1816. He was called to the bar in 1824 and took orders in Church of England in 1825, but did not practise either profession as the death of his father left him with sufficient wealth to pursue his scientific interests. He had six children from a relationship with an Irish dancer, one of whom was Eleanor Louisa Moravia Henry, also known as Nelly, mother of the painter Walter Sickert and the feminist Helena Swanwick. Sheepshanks gave financial support to the dancer and her husband, who in turn claimed paternity. In later life, he and his sister lived in Reading in Berkshire.

==Professional life==
From 1817 until his death, Sheepshanks was a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was an active astronomer. He served as editor of &quot;Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society&quot; and greatly improved their content. In 1830, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1832, he got involved in the lawsuit of Edward Troughton against Sir James South, in which Troughton demanded payment for an equatorial mounting that he had supplied to South, but which South claimed to be defective. Sheepshanks informally served as legal counsel to Troughton; South&#x27;s legal counsel was Drinkwater Bethune. Troughton prevailed in the lawsuit. In 1833, he recommended withholding publication of an early edition of Stephen Groombridge&#x27;s star catalogue, which was being published posthumously, after discovering the edition contained errors. A final corrected edition was later published in 1838 under the auspices of George Biddell Airy. In his later career he worked on establishing a standard of length for imperial measures. He was reportedly deeply sceptical of the work of Charles Babbage and of Babbage&#x27;s ability to deliver a working Difference Engine or Analytical Engine. The two men publicly criticized each other.

==Death and legacy==
He suffered a stroke (&quot;apoplexy&quot;) on 29 July 1855, dying on 4 August, in Reading, and was buried at Trinity College. There is a memorial notice at St John&#x27;s Church, Bilton in Harrogate. After his death, Richard&#x27;s sister Anne Sheepshanks contributed a legacy towards research to be conducted by the Cambridge Observatory and a scholarship in her brother&#x27;s name.

<doc id="860333" wikidata="Q6991715" url="?curid=860333" title="Neo-Confederates">
<text>Neo-Confederates are groups and individuals who portray the Confederate States of America and its actions during the American Civil War in a positive light. The League of the South, the Sons of Confederate Veterans and other neo-Confederate organizations continue to defend the secession of the 11 former Confederate States.

== Etymology ==
Historian James M. McPherson used the term &quot;neo-Confederate historical committees&quot; in his description of the efforts which were undertaken from 1890 to 1930 to have history textbooks present a version of the American Civil War in which secession was not rebellion, the Confederacy did not fight for slavery, and the Confederate soldier was defeated by overwhelming numbers and resources. Historian Nancy MacLean used the term &quot;neo-Confederacy&quot; in reference to groups, such as the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, that formed in the 1950s to oppose the Supreme Court of the United States rulings demanding racial integration, in particular &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954). Former &quot;Southern Partisan&quot; editor and co-owner Richard Quinn used the term when he referred to Richard T. Hines, former &quot;Southern Partisan&quot; contributor and Ronald Reagan administration staffer, as being &quot;among the first neo-Confederates to resist efforts by the infidels to take down the Confederate flag.&quot;

An early use of the term came in 1954. In a book review, Leonard Levy (later a winner of the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1968) wrote: &quot;Similar blindness to the moral issue of slavery, plus a resentment against the rise of the Negro and modern industrialism, resulted in the neo-Confederate interpretation of Phillips, Ramsdell and Owsley.&quot;

Historian Gary W. Gallagher stated in an interview that neo-Confederates do not want to hear him when he talks &quot;about how important maintaining racial control, white supremacy, was to the white South.&quot; He warns, however, that the term neo-Confederate can be overused, writing, &quot;Any historian who argues that the Confederate people demonstrated robust devotion to their slave-based republic, possessed feelings of national community, and sacrificed more than any other segment of white society in United States history runs the risk of being labeled a neo-Confederate.&quot;

== History ==
=== Origins of the &quot;Lost Cause&quot; movement ===
The &quot;Lost Cause&quot; is the name which is commonly given to a movement that seeks to reconcile the existence of the traditional society of the Southern United States with the defeat of the Confederate States of America at the end of the American Civil War of 1861–1865. Those who contribute to the movement tend to portray the Confederacy&#x27;s cause as noble and they also tend to portray most of the Confederacy&#x27;s leaders as exemplars of old-fashioned chivalry who were defeated by the Union&#x27;s armies because the Union&#x27;s armies used overwhelming force rather than superior military skills. They believe that the history of the Civil War which is commonly portrayed is a &quot;false history&quot;. They also tend to condemn Reconstruction, the era when African Americans were first allowed to vote.

On its main website, the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV) speaks of &quot;ensuring that a true history of the 1861-1865 period is preserved&quot;, claiming that &quot;[t]he preservation of liberty and freedom was the motivating factor in the South&#x27;s decision to fight the Second American Revolution.&quot;

James M. McPherson has written the following about the origins of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC): &quot;A principal motive of the UDC&#x27;s founding was to counter this &#x27;false history&#x27; which taught Southern children &#x27;that their fathers were not only rebels but guilty of almost every crime enumerated in the Decalogue. Much of what the UDC called &quot;false history&quot; centered on the relationship between slavery and secession and the war. The chaplain of the United Confederate Veterans (UCV), forerunner of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, wrote in 1898 that history books as written could lead Southern children to &quot;think that we fought for slavery&quot; and would &quot;fasten upon the South the stigma of slavery and that we fought for it ... The Southern soldier will go down in history dishonored&quot;. Referring to a 1932 call by the Sons of Confederate Veterans to restore &quot;the purity of our history&quot;, McPherson notes that the &quot;quest for purity remains vital today, as any historian working in the field can testify.&quot;

===20th century===
In the 1910s, Mildred Rutherford, the historian general of the UDC, spearheaded the attack on schoolbooks that did not present the Lost Cause version of history. Rutherford assembled a &quot;massive collection&quot; which included &quot;essay contests on the glory of the Ku Klux Klan and personal tributes to faithful slaves&quot;. Historian David Blight concluded: &quot;All UDC members and leaders were not as virulently racist as Rutherford, but all, in the name of a reconciled nation, participated in an enterprise that deeply influenced the white supremacist vision of Civil war memory.&quot;

In the 1930s, Seward Collins, a self-described &quot;fascist publisher&quot;, provided an avenue for white supremacists and neo-Confederates to advance their ideology in The American Review, a literary journal openly sympathetic to European fascism. The connections and overlap between white supremacist, fascist, far-right, and neo-Confederate ideologies persisted, and remain in place in the present day.

Historian Alan T. Nolan refers to the Lost Cause as &quot;a rationalization, a cover-up&quot;. After describing the devastation that was the consequence of the war for the South, Nolan states:
Leaders of such a catastrophe must account for themselves. Justification is necessary. Those who followed their leaders into the catastrophe required similar rationalization. Clement A. Evans, a Georgia veteran who at one time commanded the United Confederate Veterans organization, said this: &quot;If we cannot justify the South in the act of Secession, we will go down in History solely as a brave, impulsive but rash people who attempted in an illegal manner to overthrow the Union of our Country.&quot;

Nolan further states his opinion of the racial basis of Lost Cause mythology: 
The Lost Cause version of the war is a caricature, possible, among other reasons, because of the false treatment of slavery and the black people. This false treatment struck at the core of the truth of the war, unhinging cause and effect, depriving the United States of any high purpose, and removing African Americans from their true role as the issue of the war and participants in the war, and characterizing them as historically irrelevant.

In the 1930s and 1940s, supporters of Nazi Germany sought cross appeal with American neo-confederates. Despite a shared commitment to white supremacy, and antipathy towards American Liberalism, the Nazis found few sympathizers amongst white southerners, even the KKK itself. Starting in the 1970s, neo-confederate ideals and organizations became increasingly associated with the emerging neo-Nazi movement. Critics often associate Neo-Confederates with fascism in the United States.

===Contemporary evaluations===
Historian David Goldfield observes: 
If history has defined the South, it has also trapped white southerners into sometimes defending the indefensible, holding onto views generally discredited in the rest of the civilized world and holding on the fiercer because of that. The extreme sensitivity of some Southerners toward criticism of their past (or present) reflects not only their deep attachment to their perception of history but also to their misgivings, a feeling that maybe they&#x27;ve fouled up somewhere and maybe the critics have something.

When asked about purported &quot;neo-Confederate revisionism&quot; and the people behind it, Arizona State University professor and Civil War historian Brooks D. Simpson said:
This is an active attempt to reshape historical memory, an effort by white Southerners to find historical justifications for present-day actions. The neo-Confederate movement&#x27;s ideologues have grasped that if they control how people remember the past, they&#x27;ll control how people approach the present and the future. Ultimately, this is a very conscious war for memory and heritage. It&#x27;s a quest for legitimacy, the eternal quest for justification.

==Tenets and core beliefs==

=== Historical revisionism ===
Neo-Confederates often hold iconoclastic views about the American Civil War and the Confederate States of America. Neo-Confederates are openly critical of the presidency of Abraham Lincoln to varying degrees and they are also critical of the history of Reconstruction. Various authors have written critiques of Lincoln and the Union. Major General William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea is singled out for purported atrocities like the burning of Atlanta which neo-Confederates believe were committed against Southern civilians, in contrast to the mainstream historical perspective which argues that Sherman targeted Southern infrastructure and curtailed killing rather than expand it. Slavery is rarely mentioned—when it is, it is usually not defended and is denied as a primary cause of the Confederacy&#x27;s starting of the American Civil War. Critics often accuse neo-Confederates of engaging in &quot;historical revisionism&quot; and acting as &quot;apologists&quot;.

Neo-Confederates have been accused of downplaying the role of slavery in triggering the Civil War and misrepresenting African-American support for the Confederacy. The book &quot;The Confederate and Neo-Confederate Reader&quot; says that toward the end of the 20th century—in order to support the idea that the Civil War was not about slavery—neo-Confederates began to claim that &quot;thousands of African Americans had served in the Confederate army&quot;. A neo-Confederate publication, &quot;Confederate Veteran&quot;, published by the Sons of Confederate Veterans and the Military Order of the Stars and Bars, said in 1992 that &quot;the overwhelming majority of blacks during the War Between the States supported and defended, with armed resistance, the Cause of Southern Independence&quot;. Historian Bruce Levine says that &quot;their [neo-Confederates&#x27;] insistent celebration these days of &#x27;Black Confederates&#x27; ... seeks to legitimize the claim&quot; that the war &quot;had &quot;never&quot; [italics in original] been fought on behalf of slavery; loyalty to the South, Southern self-government, Southern culture, or states&#x27; rights — rather than slavery and white supremacy — fueled the Southern war effort&quot;.

The honor of the Confederacy and its veterans is another controversial feature of neo-Confederate dogma. The neo-Confederate movement is concerned about giving honor to the Confederacy itself, to the veterans of the Confederacy and Confederate veterans&#x27; cemeteries, to the various flags of the Confederacy and Southern cultural identity.

=== Political beliefs ===
Political values held by neo-Confederates vary, but they often revolve around a belief in limited government, states&#x27; rights, the right of states to secede, and Southern nationalism—that is, the belief that the people of the Southern United States are part of a distinct and unique civilization.

Neo-Confederates typically support a decentralized national government and are strong advocates of states&#x27; rights. Neo-Confederates are strongly in favor of the right of secession, claiming it is legal and thus openly advocate the secession of the Southern states and territories which comprised the old Confederate States of America. The League of the South, for example, promotes the &quot;independence of the Southern people&quot; from the &quot;American empire&quot;. Most neo-Confederate groups do not seek violent revolution, but rather an orderly separation, such as was done in the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. Many neo-Confederate groups have prepared for what they view as a possible collapse of the federal United States into its 50 separate states, similarly to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and believe the Confederacy can be resurrected at that time.

From the 1950s onward, the growth of neo-Confederate ideology was part of a larger reactionary movement against desegregation and the civil rights movement. Historian Nancy MacLean states that neo-Confederates used the history of the Confederacy to justify their opposition to the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s. Historian David Blight writes that current neo-Confederates are &quot;driven largely by the desire of current white supremacists to re-legitimize the Confederacy, while they tacitly reject the victories of the modern civil rights movement&quot;.

=== Cultural and religious ===
Neo-Confederates promote foundational Christian culture. They support public displays of Christianity, such as Ten Commandments monuments and displays of the Christian cross. Some neo-Confederates view the Civil War struggles as being between Christian orthodoxy and anti-Christian forces. Certain neo-Confederates believe in an &quot;Anglo-Celtic&quot; identity theory for residents of the South.

=== Economic policies ===
Neo-Confederates usually advocate a free market economy which engages in significantly less taxation than currently found in the United States and which does not revolve around fiat currencies such as the United States dollar. Some of them desire an extreme type of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economic system involving a minimal role for the state. Other Neo-Confederates believe in distributionism as well as a display of populist tendencies since the Civil War. Figures such as Absolom West, Leonidas L. Polk, and William M. Lowe went on to join the Populist movements of their respective times. There is a minority of neo-Confederates who believe the Confederacy to have been Socialist citing the writings of George Fitzhugh; this was also displayed in Louise Biles Hill&#x27;s book, &quot;State Socialism in the Confederate States&quot;. Many who believe this also point to Albert Parsons as another example.

== Neo-Confederates and libertarianism ==
Historian Daniel Feller asserts that libertarian authors Thomas DiLorenzo, Charles Adams and Jeffrey Rogers Hummel have produced a &quot;marriage of neo-Confederates and libertarianism&quot;. Feller writes: 
In a review of libertarian Thomas E. Woods Jr.&#x27;s &quot;The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History&quot;, in turn Hummel refers to the works by DiLorenzo and Adams as &quot;amateurish neo-Confederate books&quot;. Of Woods, Hummel states that the two main neo-Confederate aspects of Woods&#x27; work are his emphasis on a legal right of secession while ignoring the moral right to secession and his failure to acknowledge the importance of slavery in the Civil War. Hummel writes: 
Hummel also criticizes Woods&#x27; &quot;neo-Confederate sympathies&quot; in his chapter on Reconstruction. Most egregious was his &quot;apologia for the Black Codes adopted by the southern states immediately after the Civil War&quot;. Part of the problem was Woods&#x27; reliance on an earlier neo-Confederate work, Robert Selph Henry&#x27;s 1938 book &quot;The Story of Reconstruction&quot;.

Historian Gerald J. Prokopowicz mentioned apprehension toward recognizing Lincoln&#x27;s role in freeing slaves as well as libertarian attitudes towards the Confederacy in an interview regarding his book &quot;Did Lincoln Own Slaves? And Other Frequently Asked Questions about Abraham Lincoln&quot;: 
Some intellectuals who have helped shape the modern neo-Confederate movement have been associated with libertarian organizations such as the Mises Institute. These individuals often insist on the South&#x27;s right to secede and typically hold views in stark contrast to mainstream academia in regards to the causes and consequences of the American Civil War. Zack Beauchamp of &quot;ThinkProgress&quot; argues that because of its small size, the libertarian movement has become partially beholden to a neo-Confederate demographic. In contemporary politics, some libertarians have tried to distance themselves from neo-Confederate ideology while also critiquing President Lincoln&#x27;s wartime policies, such as the suspension of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, from a libertarian perspective.

== Neo-Confederate views and the Republican Party ==
Historian Nancy MacLean writes that &quot;since the 1960s the party of Lincoln has become the haven of neo-Confederacy. Having long prided itself on saving the Union, the Republican Party has become home to those who lionize the slaveholding South and romanticize the Jim Crow South&quot;. According to MacClean, this embrace of neo-Confederate views is not exclusively about race, but it is related to a pragmatic political realization that the &quot;retrospective romanticization of the Old South&quot; and secession presented many possible themes that could be used as conservatives attempted to reverse the national changes initiated by the New Deal.

According to MacLean, after the defeat of Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election and the successes of the civil rights movement, conservative leaders nationally distanced themselves from racial issues, but they continued to support a &quot;color-blind&quot; version of neo-Confederatism. She writes that &quot;even into the twenty-first century mainstream conservative Republican politicians continued to associate themselves with issues, symbols, and organizations inspired by the neo-Confederate Right&quot;.

Two prominent neo-Confederates—Walter Donald Kennedy and Al Benson—published the book &quot;Red Republicans and Lincoln&#x27;s Marxists: Marxism in the Civil War&quot;, in which they argue that Lincoln and the Republican Party were influenced by Marxism.

==Criticism==
The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) reports on the &quot;neo-Confederate movement&quot; almost always in a critical fashion. A special report by the SPLC&#x27;s Mark Potok in their magazine, &quot;Intelligence Report&quot;, critically described a number of groups as &quot;neo-Confederate&quot; in 2000. &quot;Lincoln Reconstructed&quot;, published in 2003 in the &quot;Intelligence Report&quot;, focuses on the resurgent demonization of Abraham Lincoln in the South. The article quotes the chaplain of the Sons of Confederate Veterans as giving an invocation which recalled &quot;the last real Christian civilization on Earth&quot;.

George Ewert, director of the Museum of Mobile, wrote a review of the film &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; in which he pointed out that the film was &quot;part of a growing movement that seeks to rewrite the history of the American South, downplaying slavery and the economic system that it sustained&quot;. His review enraged local neo-Confederate activists.

<doc id="860337" wikidata="Q3568996" url="?curid=860337" title="William Thomas (architect)">
<text>William Thomas ( – 26 December 1860) was an Anglo-Canadian architect. His son William Tutin Thomas (1829–1892) was also an architect, working mostly in Montreal, Quebec.

== Life ==
Thomas was born in Suffolk, England. He was apprenticed to a local builder after his family moved to Gloucestershire. His two older brothers became master glaziers and younger brother was the sculptor John Thomas, apprenticed under Sir Charles Barry and A. W. Pugin (born 1813).

On completion of his apprenticeship, William moved to Birmingham to work for Richard Tutin, a builder and surveyor. He became a member of the Tutin family by marrying Martha, a member of the Tutin family. During this time he revised his title to architect, however, a depression in the city forced the closure of the firm and he moved to Leamington.

Thomas began his own practice at Leamington Spa in 1831 where he designed many buildings, but in 1837 went bankrupt. In 1843, during a depression in the British building industry, he emigrated to Canada with his wife and 10 children to Toronto, where his career flourished. He designed some of the finest Decorated Gothic Revival architecture in Ontario.

Between 1845 and 1850, Thomas worked extensively with the trio of Scottish sculptors John Cochrane and Brothers. They were responsible for work such as the interior decorations of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, stone and stucco ornamentation inside St. Michael&#x27;s Cathedral Basilica and stone carving, including the coat of arms in the central gable, at Bishop&#x27;s Palace, and exterior embellishments on St. Lawrence Hall.

He was also Toronto&#x27;s city engineer when John George Howard made a trip to England in 1853. He died in Toronto, aged about sixty. Two of his sons, William Tutin Thomas and Cyrus Pole Thomas, also became architects.

Thomas is sometimes incorrectly credited with the architectural design and the elaborate stone carvings on Victoria Hall in Cobourg, Ontario. In fact, Kivas Tully designed the building and the fine sandstone carvings are the work of master stone carver Charles Thomas Thomas (no relation).

<text>St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London, Ontario, Canada, is the seat of the Diocese of Huron of the Anglican Church of Canada. It was designed in the Gothic revival style by William Thomas and built between 1844 and 1846, replacing the previous church, which was built in 1834 and burned down in 1844. It is the oldest church in the city. Sculptors John Cochrane and Brothers undertook the work on the cathedral&#x27;s interior.

In 1966, the cathedral commissioned its history to be written by the Rev. Orlo Miller.

<doc id="860340" wikidata="Q591783" url="?curid=860340" title="The System Has Failed">
<text>The System Has Failed is the tenth studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth, released on September 14, 2004. It was the band&#x27;s second and final studio album to be distributed by Sanctuary Records. &quot;The System Has Failed&quot; was the first album to be released after Dave Mustaine recovered from his arm injury sustained in 2002. It is also the first of four Megadeth studio albums not to include original bassist and co-founder David Ellefson. The album features former Megadeth member Chris Poland (guitar), who previously performed on &quot;Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!&quot; (1985) and &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot; (1986), and session musicians Vinnie Colaiuta (drums) and Jimmie Lee Sloas (bass).

&quot;The System Has Failed&quot; received positive reception from critics and debuted at number 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album was generally thought of as being a return to form for the band, after the release of more commercially accessible albums through the 1990s. &quot;Die Dead Enough&quot; and &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; were released as singles in 2004, and &quot;The Scorpion&quot; was released as a single in 2005. The track &quot;Back in the Day&quot; was featured in the &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot; episode &quot;In Space, No One Can Hear You Rock&quot; in 2005, which featured an animated version of the band performing the song.

==Background and production==
In 2002, Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine announced that he was disbanding the band due to an arm injury that rendered him unable to play guitar. In a statement published on April 3, 2002, he stated that doctors expected that it would take about a year before he would recover from the injury. However, it was uncertain as to how complete of a recovery it would be. Mustaine stated his hopes to regain the ability to play guitar. He subsequently recovered following months of physical therapy.

The album was recorded at Ocean Way and Emerald Entertainment in Nashville, Tennessee and at Phase Four Studios in Tempe, Arizona. In a promotional statement from Megadeth&#x27;s then-label Sanctuary Records, Mustaine clarified that recording the album had been &quot;liberating&quot;, due to having more control over the record than he&#x27;d had since the first two Megadeth records. Mustaine also noted that he initially took a casual approach to the album, starting out working three hours a night, four days a week.

Originally intended to be a solo album by Mustaine, the record was re-branded with the Megadeth name as a result of contractual obligations owed to Mustaine&#x27;s publishing company. Mustaine co-produced the record with Jeff Balding, who had previously engineered &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot; and &quot;Risk&quot;. Upon restarting Megadeth, Mustaine contacted bassist and founding member David Ellefson about resuming bass guitar duties for the band. Those efforts were ultimately fruitless, however. Ellefson claimed that Mustaine was not financially willing to pick up &quot;where it was when [the band] broke up&quot; and did not return to Megadeth.

===Artwork===
The cover art was designed by Mike Learn, and features Vic Rattlehead at a podium in front of the United States Supreme Court building selling a not-guilty verdict to then U.S. President George W. Bush. Saluting is Hillary Clinton, next to former President Bill Clinton. Behind President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney holds a briefcase labeled &quot;plan B&quot;. Behind Cheney are several other Bush Administration officials: then National Security Advisor (and later Secretary of State) Condoleezza Rice, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and Attorney General John Ashcroft. The $100 bills on the cover depict Vic Rattlehead&#x27;s face rather than the one of Benjamin Franklin.

== Release and promotion ==
&quot;The System Has Failed&quot; was released on September 14, 2004, through Sanctuary Records. Three days previously, on September 11, the album was made available for streaming on the VH1 website. The album debuted at number 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with 46,000 units sold in its first week. By December 2007, &quot;The System Has Failed&quot; had sold 196,000 copies in the United States and by October 2019 has sold an additional 200,000 copies. In addition, the album had managed to chart in the top 20 in several other countries, including Canada, Finland, and Sweden.

Still needing a band with whom to tour, Mustaine hired longtime drummer Nick Menza in July, while newcomers James MacDonough (bass) and Glen Drover (guitar) both joined in September (although Jeff Waters of Annihilator nearly joined). Five days before the start of the tour, however, Menza was sent home. His place was filled by Shawn Drover, brother of guitarist Glen Drover. The album&#x27;s promotional tour, the &quot;Blackmail the Universe Tour&quot;, launched on October 23, 2004, in Reno, Nevada and featured Earshot as a supporting act. This tour would also spawn the &quot;That One Night: Live in Buenos Aires&quot; double live album, released in September 2007.

Two music videos were made to promote the album. The first was &quot;Die Dead Enough&quot;, which was directed by Thomas Mignone. &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; was selected as the second video from the album. In this video, the then-new Megadeth lineup is shown performing. The majority of the video was filmed in Los Angeles, California on January 20, 2005. Many fans turned up to be in the video through a contest held by Sanctuary Records. A third video was made for &quot;Back in the Day&quot; in 2005, but was unreleased until September 15, 2014, to celebrate ten years since the album&#x27;s release. &quot;Back in the Day&quot; was also featured in an episode of the &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot; TV series, along with an animated performance from the band. The episode which the song was featured in, &quot;In Space, No One Can Hear You Rock&quot;, aired on November 4, 2005, after having been delayed a week.

A remastered version of &quot;The System Has Failed&quot;, along with &quot;The World Needs a Hero&quot;, was reissued on CD, vinyl, and digital download on February 15, 2019.

== Songs ==
&quot;Die Dead Enough&quot; was the lead single from &quot;The System Has Failed&quot;. Mustaine wrote it when he was asked to write a song for the movie &quot;Tomb Raider II&quot;, but the proposed budget for recording was too low and the deal fell through. Later on, the song was supposed to be featured in the film &quot;Saw&quot;, but ultimately was not for undisclosed reasons. This was later followed by the release of &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;. Additionally, &quot;Kick the Chair&quot; was released as a free promotional download via Megadeth&#x27;s website in May 2004, several months prior to the album&#x27;s release. This version of the song was described by Mustaine as being a final mix, but was not the mix that would appear on the record. &quot;Blackmail the Universe&quot; was also released as a promotional single. &quot;Tears in a Vial&quot; was written by Mustaine shortly after Megadeth disbanded in 2002 about a decision to trade success for happiness. The sixth track on the album, &quot;I Know Jack&quot;, is an instrumental featuring a sample of Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen&#x27;s famous response to Indiana Senator Dan Quayle during a 1988 vice-presidential debate. &quot;Shadow of Deth&quot; consists of Mustaine reciting Psalm 23. The Latin phrase heard at the beginning of the track, &quot;Auxilium meum a Domino,&quot; translates to &quot;My help comes from the Lord.&quot;

==Critical reception==
&quot;The System Has Failed&quot; has received mainly positive reviews from critics, with some of them describing the album as a return to form. AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Birchmeier commented that Megadeth hasn&#x27;t sounded this vital since &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;, and called the album &quot;damn near perfect&quot;. &quot;Brave Words &amp; Bloody Knuckles&quot; reviewer Martin Popoff described the album as a mix of several previous records, and praised a number of the album&#x27;s tracks. Popoff acknowledged the fact that Mustaine only used hired session players on the album was the album&#x27;s only low point. Jeff Kerby of KNAC gave a positive, if at times slightly sarcastic review, as well as a detailed track-by-track commentary. David E. Gehlke of &quot;Blistering&quot; said despite that Mustaine&#x27;s best days were behind him, this record comes across as a &quot;warm return&quot;; although the album fails to recapture past glory, it succeeds in being a solid, reliable metal album. In addition, Gehlke noted that Mustaine&#x27;s vocals were &quot;as strong as ever&quot;, but panned the album for the lack of any &quot;thrash burners&quot;. Neil Arnold of &quot;Metal Forces&quot; had a slightly different opinion, and credited this album for putting Megadeth &quot;back on track&quot;. He praised the album artwork, which reminded him of the 80&#x27;s style of graphics. Another positive review was posted on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. Reviewer Nancy Miller called &quot;The System Has Failed&quot; Megadeth&#x27;s best since 1990&#x27;s &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; and praised Mustaine&#x27;s collaboration with Poland, calling the result &quot;Righteous!&quot;

In spite of a largely positive reception, not all reaction was completely positive. Tom Day of musicOMH had a mixed reaction to the album. Day called &quot;Die Dead Enough&quot; a &quot;slice of classic &#x27;Deth&quot;, while noting its slightly more mainstream sound. Later in his review, however, he noted that with &quot;Shadow of Deth&quot;, it seemed that Mustaine had run out of ideas. Nick Lancaster from Drowned in Sound also reacted unenthusiastically towards the album, saying it was a &quot;severe case of &quot;St. Anger&quot; syndrome&quot;. However, he added there were &quot;occasional moments of the old magic, but they&#x27;re few and far between&quot;.

<text>Operation Eagle Fury was a military operation led by the United States in Afghanistan involving Bravo Company and two Charlie Company SFODAs (762 and 765), 2nd BN, 7th SFG(A) US Army Special Forces, and a sniper team of USN SEALs, members of the QRF 82nd Airborne Division, and loyal Afghan fighters from 9–28 February 2003.
The aim of the operation was to corner Taliban fighters and leaders in the Baghran Valley, located in Helmand Province, in the mountains of south-east Afghanistan. The battle took place in the village of Lejay for 43 consecutive hours. This continues to be the longest solely Special Forces battle to take place during the Afghanistan war.

As part of this operation, in mid-February 2003, the 82nd conducted the first airdrop of fuel to support Operation Enduring Freedom. 
They dropped 38,088 gallons of fuel, almost certainly the first combat fuel drop since the Vietnam War.

<text>Passamaquoddy Bay () is an inlet of the Bay of Fundy, between the U.S. state of Maine and the Canadian province of New Brunswick, at the mouth of the St. Croix River. Most of the bay lies within Canada, with its western shore bounded by Washington County, Maine. The southernmost point is formed by West Quoddy Head on the U.S. mainland in Lubec, Maine; and runs northeasterly through Campobello Island, New Brunswick, engulfing Deer Island, New Brunswick, to the New Brunswick mainland head at L&#x27;Etete, New Brunswick in Charlotte County, New Brunswick.

== Overview ==
The exact demarcation of the border in Passamaquoddy Bay was a long-standing issue between the United States and Britain/Canada. Already the Treaty of Ghent, ending the War of 1812, included a provision for the appointment of &quot;commissioners to divide the islands of Passamaquoddy Bay between the United States and Great Britain&quot; (see John Holmes). Nevertheless, confusions and ambiguities on this issue persisted.

The southern boundaries of the bay are sometimes confused since Deer Island sections off the large open waters of the bay; however, the terminology of the Passamaquoddy Bay Treaty of 1910 specifies that Passamaquoddy Bay runs south of Treat Island (one of the islands that now comprise the city of Eastport, Maine), between Campobello Island and Lubec, Maine:

&quot;Now, therefore, upon the evidence and arguments so presented, and after taking into consideration all actions, of the respective Governments and of their representatives authorized in that behalf and of the local governments on either side of the line, whether prior or subsequent to such treaties and award, tending to aid in the interpretation thereof, the High Contracting Parties hereby agree that the location of the international boundary line between the United States and the Dominion of Canada from a point in Passamaquoddy Bay accurately defined in the Treaty between Great Britain and the United States of April 11, 1908, as, lying between Treat Island and Friar Head, and extending thence through Passamaquoddy Bay and to, the middle of Grand Manan Channel, shall run in a series of seven connected straight lines for the distances and in the directions as follows.&quot;

The largest community on Passamaquoddy Bay proper is St. Andrews, New Brunswick, but the twin communities of Calais-St. Stephen are sometimes included, despite being located on the St. Croix River. The city of Eastport, Maine lies between Passamaquoddy Bay and Cobscook Bay, to the city&#x27;s west. The narrow passage between Maine and Deer Island is known as Western Passage. The passage between Eastport, Maine, and Friar Bay, Campobello Island, is known as Friar Roads.

The three entrances into Passamaquoddy Bay from the Bay of Fundy are Letete Passage northeast of Deer Island, Head Harbour Passage to the southeast of Deer Island and northwest of Campobello Island, and Quoddy Narrows, between southern Lubec, Maine, and southern Campobello Island. Running north from West Quoddy Head in Lubec, the passages known as Quoddy Narrows, Lubec Channel, Lubec Narrows, Friar Roads, and Western Passage also host the International Boundary between Canada and the United States.

The Head Harbour Passage is the deepwater entry to the Bay. The US and Canadian governments agree that the passage is Canadian. The US government believes that it is a territorial sea in which international law gives commercial vessels a right of passage. The Canadian government believes that it can regulate passage and is considering doing so to prevent the use by supertankers carrying cargo to liquified natural gas plants proposed for the American coast of the bay.

== Smuggling ==
After the American Revolution, Passamaquoddy Bay was the scene of a thriving smuggling trade. Smuggling peaked in 1808 during Jefferson&#x27;s Embargo, when smugglers illegally moved tens of thousands of barrels of American flour from American territory into New Brunswick. During the War of 1812, a thriving illicit trade in British manufactured goods existed. After the War of 1812, the primary smuggled good was gypsum from Nova Scotia, which was usually deposited directly into American vessels on or near the border. Smuggling was winked at by both officials and locals in the region, who discouraged outside intervention by British or American authorities who wanted to stop or control it.

<text>&quot;Profile in Silver&quot; is the first segment of the twentieth episode of the first season of the 1985 revival of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; television series. In this segment, a time traveler interferes in the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and must find a way to repair the resulting damage to the timeline.

==Plot==
Dr. Joseph Fitzgerald has traveled back in time from the year 2172 and assumed the identity of an instructor at Harvard University. His mission is to video record the assassination of John F. Kennedy, from whom he is descended. Fitzgerald is nervous about watching his own ancestor be murdered. Dr. Kate Wang, a colleague from his own time, rebukes him for carrying around a 1964 coin with Kennedy&#x27;s image, but he implores her to let this minor infraction against time travel rules slide.

At the scene of the assassination, Fitzgerald impulsively shouts for the president to take cover. President Kennedy ducks, and the shot misses him. A grateful Kennedy invites Fitzgerald to stay at the White House. As Kennedy and his entourage return home, the president is notified that Nikita Khrushchev has been assassinated and Soviet troops have captured West Berlin.

Fitzgerald consults his wrist computer, which informs him that his alteration of history has caused massive rips in the fabric of time. The assassination of Khrushchev was not enough to fix the damage; all possible outcomes to this timeline involve war between the superpowers. The only way to repair the timeline is for Kennedy to die in the exact manner as history recorded.

The president&#x27;s Secret Service bodyguard, Ray, has grown suspicious of Fitzgerald after finding his 1964 coin and examining his video camera, the shell of which is an unknown alloy that cannot be opened. Kennedy summons Fitzgerald, who tells them the whole story, showing a holographic display from the camera as partial proof. Kennedy volunteers to go back and be assassinated in order to repair the timeline. Fitzgerald, overwhelmed by his ancestor&#x27;s heroism, removes his Harvard school ring, which is actually his time travel device, and places it on Kennedy&#x27;s hand. Kennedy is transported to Fitzgerald&#x27;s home, in 2172. Fitzgerald takes Kennedy&#x27;s place in the Dallas motorcade.

At Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, the dead body of &quot;President Kennedy&quot; (actually Fitzgerald) is attended to by Dr. Wang. Ray recognizes her ring because it is identical to Fitzgerald&#x27;s. She tells him she knew what Fitzgerald&#x27;s fate would be, since even actions committed during time travel become part of history, but could not let him know.

At Harvard University in 2172, John F. Kennedy delivers a speech to a classroom full of students, in which he implicitly lauds Fitzgerald&#x27;s sacrifice and the sacrifices of other honorable men like him.

<text>A menagerie is a collection of captive animals, frequently exotic, kept for display; or the place where such a collection is kept, a precursor to the modern zoo or zoological garden.

The term was first used in 17th-century France, referring to the management of household or domestic stock. Later, it came to be used primarily in reference to aristocratic or royal animal collections. The French-language &quot;Methodical Encyclopaedia&quot; of 1782 defines a menagerie as an &quot;establishment of luxury and curiosity&quot;. Later on, the term referred also to travelling animal collections that exhibited wild animals at fairs across Europe and the Americas.

==Aristocratic menageries==

A menagerie was mostly connected with an aristocratic or royal court and was situated within a garden or park of a palace. These aristocrats wanted to illustrate their power and wealth by displaying exotic animals which were uncommon, difficult to acquire, and expensive to maintain in a living and active state.

The aristocratic menageries are distinguished from the later zoological garden (zoos) since they were founded and owned by aristocrats whose intentions were not primarily of scientific and educational interest.

===Medieval period and Renaissance===
During the Middle Ages, several sovereigns across Europe maintained menageries at their royal courts. An early example is that of the Emperor Charlemagne in the 8th century. His three menageries, at Aachen, Nijmegen and Ingelheim, located in present-day Netherlands and Germany, housed the first elephants seen in Europe since the Roman Empire, along with monkeys, lions, bears, camels, falcons, and many exotic birds.
Charlemagne received exotic animals for his collection as gifts from rulers of Africa and Asia.
In 797, the caliph of Baghdad, Harun al-Rashid, presented Charlemagne with an Asian elephant named Abul-Abbas. The elephant arrived on July 1, 802 to the Emperor&#x27;s residence in Aachen. He died in June 810.

William the Conqueror had a small royal menagerie. At his manor, Woodstock, he began a collection of exotic animals. Around the year 1100 his son, Henry I, enclosed Woodstock and enlarged the collection.
At the beginning of the 12th century, Henry I of England is known to have kept a collection of animals at his palace in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, reportedly including lions, leopards, lynxes, camels, owls, and a porcupine.

The most prominent animal collection in medieval England was the Tower Menagerie in London that began as early as 1204.
It was established by King John, who reigned in England from 1199 to 1216 and is known to have held lions and bears.
Henry III received a wedding gift in 1235 of three leopards from Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor.
The most spectacular arrivals in the early years were a white bear and an elephant, gifts from the kings of Norway and France in 1251 and in 1254 respectively.
In 1264, the animals were moved to the Bulwark, which was renamed the Lion Tower, near the main western entrance of the Tower.
This building was constituted by rows of cages with arched entrances, enclosed behind grilles. They were set in two storeys, and it appears that the animals used the upper cages during the day and were moved to the lower storey at night.
The menagerie was opened to the public during the reign of Elizabeth I in the 16th century. During the 18th century, the price of admission was three half-pence, or the supply of a cat or dog to be fed to the lions.
Animals recorded here at the end of the 18th century included lions, tigers, hyenas, and bears.
Most of the animals were transferred in 1831 to the newly opened London Zoo at Regent&#x27;s Park, which did not receive all the animals but rather shared them with Dublin Zoo.
The Tower Menagerie was finally closed in 1835, on the orders of the Duke of Wellington. The Tower Menagerie in London can be considered to have been the royal menagerie of England for six centuries.

In the first half of the thirteenth century, Emperor Frederick II had three permanent menageries in Italy, at Melfi in Basilicata, at Lucera in Apulia and at Palermo in Sicily.
In 1235, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II established at his court in southern Italy the &quot;first great menagerie&quot; in western Europe. An elephant, a white bear, a giraffe, a leopard, hyenas, lions, cheetahs, camels, and monkeys were all exhibited; but the emperor was particularly interested in birds, and studied them sufficiently to write a number of authoritative books on them.

In the beginning of the 15th century, a royal menagerie was established in the Royal Palace of Lisbon, located nearby the Castle of Saint George. Following the conquest of Ceuta in 1415, King John I of Portugal brought back to Lisbon two Barbary lions, and they were installed in a large room inside his Palace in the Citadel of Lisbon. This area of the palace came to be known as &quot;Casa dos Leões&quot; (the &quot;Lions&#x27; House&quot;); today the area is occupied by a famed restaurant with the same name. Later that century, German humanist Hieronymus Münzer spent five days in Lisbon in 1494, and learned about the lions, claiming to be the most beautiful wild beasts he had ever seen.
Later on, the ménagerie of King Manuel I (1495-1521), inside the Ribeira Palace, in downtown Lisbon, was appreciated in Europe due to its huge elephants that the king ordered to be brought from India. One of his elephants, Hanno, as well as a rhinoceros depicted by Dürer were famous gifts to Pope Leo X. However, the rhinoceros drowned as a result of a shipwreck suffered during the transport trip to Italy.

By the end of the 15th century, the aristocracy of Renaissance Italy began to collect exotic animals at their residences on the outskirts of the cities. The role played by animals within the gardens of Italian villas expanded at the end of the 16th century and the beginning of the seventeenth century, and one prominent example was the Villa Borghese built 1608–1628 in Rome.

===Versailles and its legacy===
During the seventeenth century, exotic birds and small animals provided diverting ornaments for the court of France; lions and other large animals were kept primarily to be brought out for staged fights.
The collecting grew and attained more permanent lodgings in the 1660s, when Louis XIV constructed two new menageries: one at Vincennes, next to a palace on the eastern edge of Paris, and a more elaborate one, which became a model for menageries throughout Europe, at Versailles, the site of a royal hunting lodge two hours (by carriage) west of Paris.

Around 1661, he had a menagerie of &quot;ferocious&quot; beasts built at Vincennes for the organization of fights. Surrounding a rectangular courtyard, a two-storey building with balconies allowed spectators to view the scene. The animals were housed on the ground floor in cells bordering the courtyard, with small yards on the outside where they could take a bit of exercise.
At Vincennes, lions, tigers, and leopards, as well as polecat, minks and weasels were kept in cages around an amphitheater where the king could entertain courtiers and visiting dignitaries with bloody battles.
In 1682, for instance, the ambassador of Persia enjoyed the spectacle of a fight to the death between a royal tiger and an elephant.

When the palace of Versailles was built, Louis XIV of France also erected a menagerie within the palace&#x27;s park.
The menagerie at Versailles was to be something very different from the one at Vincennes.
Most of it was constructed in 1664 when the first animals were introduced, although the interior fittings were not finished until 1668–70. Situated in the south-west of the park, it was Louis XIV&#x27;s first major project at Versailles and one of several pleasure houses that were gradually assembled around the palace.
It represented the first menagerie according to Baroque style. The prominent feature of Baroque menageries was the circular layout, in the middle of which stood a beautiful pavilion. Around this pavilion was a walking path and outside this path were the enclosures and cages. Each enclosure had a house or stable at the far end for the animals and was bounded on three sides with walls. There were bars only in the direction of the pavilion.

Animal fights were halted at Vincennes around 1700, the site fell into disuse, and the animals were installed at Versailles with the others.
At about this time, the lions, leopards, and tigers from the menagerie at Vincennes were transferred to Versailles, where they were housed in newly built enclosures fronted with iron bars.
This particular enterprise marked a decisive step in the creation of menageries of curiosities and was imitated to some extent throughout Europe after the late seventeenth century.
Monarchs, princes and important lords built them in France (Chantilly from 1663), England (Kew, Osterley), the United Provinces (Het Loo from 1748), Portugal (Belém in 1726, Queluz around 1780), Spain (Madrid in 1774) and Austria (Belvedere in 1716, Schönbrunn in 1752) as well in the Germanic lands following the ravages of the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) and the ensuing reconstruction. Frederick William, Elector of Prussia, equipped Potsdam with a menagerie around 1680. The Elector of the Palatinate, the Prince Regent of Westphalia and many others followed suit.

This design was adopted particularly by the Habsburg monarchy in Austria. In 1752 Francis I erected his famous Baroque menagerie in the park of Schönbrunn Palace near Vienna. 
Being at first a courtly menagerie with private character it was opened to the general public in 1779. Initially, it was only open for &quot;respectably dressed persons&quot;.

Another aristocratic menagerie was founded in 1774 by Charles III of Spain on grounds which were part of the gardens of the Buen Retiro Palace in Madrid.
During two centuries, it was a predecessor institution of the modern facilities of the Madrid Zoo Aquarium, moved in 1972 to the Casa de Campo.

In the nineteenth century the aristocratic menageries were displaced by the modern zoological gardens with their scientific and educational approach. The last menagerie in Europe was the Tiergarten Schönbrunn in Vienna, which was known officially as a &quot;menagerie&quot; until 1924, before evolving into a modern zoological garden with a scientific, educational and conservationist orientation. Due to its local continuity, the former menagerie established in the medieval through baroque tradition of private wild-animal collections of princes and kings, is often seen as the oldest remaining zoo in the world. Although many of the old Baroque enclosures have been changed, one can still obtain a good impression of the symmetrical ensemble of the formerly imperial menagerie.

==Travelling menageries==

In England travelling menageries had first appeared at around 1700. In contrast to the aristocratic menageries, these travelling animal collections were run by showmen who met the craving for sensation of the ordinary population. These animal shows ranged in size but the largest was George Wombwell&#x27;s. The earliest record of a fatality at one such travelling menagerie was the death of Hannah Twynnoy in 1703 who was killed by a tiger in Malmesbury, Wiltshire.
Also in North America travelling menageries became even more popular during that time.

The first exotic animal known to have been exhibited in America was a lion, in Boston in 1710, followed a year later in the same city by a camel.
A sailor arrived in Philadelphia in August 1727 with another lion, which he exhibited in the city and surrounding towns for eight years.
The first elephant was imported from India to America by a ship&#x27;s captain, Jacob Crowninshield, in 1796. It was first displayed in New York City and travelled extensively up and down the East Coast.
In 1834 James and William Howes’ New York Menagerie toured New England with an elephant, a rhinoceros, a camel, two tigers, a polar bear, and several parrots and monkeys.

America&#x27;s touring menageries slowed to a crawl under the weight of the depression of the 1840s and then to a halt with the outbreak of the Civil War. Only one travelling menagerie of any size existed after the war: The Van Amburgh menagerie travelled the United States for nearly forty years. Unlike their European counterparts, America&#x27;s menageries and circuses had combined as single travelling shows, with one ticket to see both. This increased the size and the diversity of their collections. Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus advertised their shows as the “World’s Greatest Menagerie”.

<text>The Butmir culture was a major Neolithic culture in central Bosnia, developed along the shores of the river Bosna, spanning from Sarajevo to Zavidovići. It was discovered in 1893, at the site located in Butmir, in the vicinity of Ilidža, which gave its name to an entire cultural group of the Late Neolithic in central Bosnia, the Butmir culture. It is characterized by its unique elaborately decorated pottery and anthropomorphic Figurines, and is one of the best researched European cultures from 5100 to 4500 BC. It was part of the larger Danube civilization. The largest Butmir site is in Visoko basin, in Okolište.

== History ==

The Butmir culture was discovered in 1893, when Austro-Hungarian authorities began construction on the agricultural college of the University of Sarajevo. Various traces of human settlement were found dating to the Neolithic period. Digs were begun immediately, and lasted until 1896.

The finds caused interest among archaeologists worldwide. They were largely responsible for the International Congress of Archaeology and Anthropology being held in Sarajevo in August 1894. The most impressive finds were the unique ceramics, which are now found in the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The culture disappeared during the Bronze Age.

==Settlements==
Prominent Butmir culture sites include Butmir (Sarajevo), Kraljevine (Novi Šeher), Obre II (Kakanj), Nebo (Travnik), Crkvina (Turbe), Okolište, (Visoko), and Brdo (Kiseljak).

According to radiocarbon analysis, occupation of these settlements spanned from 5100 to 4500 BCE:

* Butmir I, 5100 – 4900 BCE
* Butmir II, 4850 – 4750 BCE (settlement in Butmir, results from 1979),
* Butmir III, to 4500. BCE (Gimbutas, 1974, 16) (results from 2002).

The Butmir culture was the home for several large settlements, among them the site of Okolište in Bosnia dating to 5200–4500 BCE, with population estimates between 1,000 and 3,000 people. The settlement was largest in the early phase (5200 BC) with an area of 7.5 hectare, gradually declining to 1.2 hectare by 4500 BC. The site likely consisted of parallel rows of houses ranging from four to ten meters in length. The site also likely had a series of ditches surrounding it with a single entrance.

The site of Okolište would likely have been an egalitarian society with no evidence of social stratification. Most animal remains found in Okolište belong to cattle, while a fair amount belonged to sheep, goats, and pigs. The diet of the Okoliste people consisted mainly of cattle, emmer, einkorn, and lentils. Although there was an importance of agriculture and animal husbandry, wild game was still hunted as a source of food.

Butmir is the oldest Neolithic site in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was discovered by Austro-Hungarian authorities during the construction of a school in district of Ilidža. The first field work was conducted between 1893 and 1896 by Vjenceslav Radimski and Franjo Fiala. This discovery was monumental, and sparked an international meeting of archaeologists and anthropologists in Sarajevo in August 1894. Houses that were unearthed took the forms of dugouts (or semi-dugouts) and some above ground buildings. The largest number of dugouts was discovered in Butmir itself (90).

The site of Kraljevine in Novi Šeher was explored in 1906–1908, but the results have not been fully published. Excavations unveiled a large number of carved stone axes, which indicates a large workshop center, but there is almost no Neolithic architecture.

Obre near Kakanj was researched from 1963 to 1965, 1967 to 1968, and in 1970 when large, systematic excavations were done in two close locations: Obre I (Raskršće) and Obre II (Gornje polje). Obre I belonged to the Starcevo culture and Kakanj culture groups, while Obre II completely belonged to the Butmir culture.

The main supplement of this neolithic economy was agriculture and animal husbandry. Hunting was of less importance, but also part of daily life. Pottery produced by these people shows they possessed fine workmanship. Decorations are unique to Butmir culture and have many geometric motifs.

== Pottery ==
=== Dishes ===
In the Butmir II phase, the diversity increased significantly. Conical bowls were a standard form of this phase, but there is emergence of conical bowls with a slightly curved upper part. This phase is also represented by oval, semi-lapid and biconical bowl shapes with less curved and shorter cylindrical necks, vases with legs and shallow coarse bowls with a wavy-shaped rims. A special group is pear-shaped vases with a small opening.

The vast majority of ceramic products were simple, intended for storing food supplies, for holding water and for cooking. Only a small number are ceramics that represent a work of art. In terms of surface treatment and decoration of fine ceramic vessels, they can be divided into three groups:

# Ceramics with dark gray or black gloss finish
# Style with geometric motifs
# Style with decorative motifs

=== Sculptures ===
At Butmir sites, 72 human figures made of baked clay were found. They are made in such way so that one can easily identify some racial features. There are 3 main groups of found figures that showed racial characteristics of Negroid, Armenoid and European races. They are mainly female figures. Animal figures are very rare.

<text>Nyord () is a Danish island in the Baltic Sea, southeast of Zealand, just north of Møn island.

Nyord covers an area of approximately 5 km², although only 1.2 km² is cultivatable moraine, while the remaining 4 km² is salt-meadow which is used for summer grazing, but is flooded during the winter.

The island is reached by a narrow bridge from the larger island of Møn. The bridge was constructed in 1968 and replaced the post boat &quot;Røret&quot; which had been in service since 1902. The boat was not large enough for animals such as cattle or horses, which had to swim alongside the boat.

==History==

Traditionally the island has been self-sufficient, relying upon farming, fishing and piloting. Prior to 1769, the island belonged to the crown, but at this time crown lands were sold off, and the islanders purchased their own island for 3903 rigsdaler. The waters around the island are sufficiently treacherous that islanders could gain a livelihood as pilots, and this became enshrined in law as both a right and duty of the islanders between 1748 and 1879. After 1879, pilots were employed directly by the government instead of earning individual fees. A number of pilots houses and a lookout were constructed when the government took over the service. Piloting ceased in 1966.

The village of Nyord remains similar to its original design, with traditional thatched cottages and farm houses. It has a church, museum and small harbour. There is a restaurant &quot;Lolles Gård&quot; which is both a farm and a restaurant, there also is a village shop. The marshland area crossed by the bridge from the main island has one of Denmark&#x27;s most important habitats for geese, ducks and other wading birds. There is an observation tower for birdwatchers to use.

<text>USS &quot;Trathen&quot; (DD-530) was a World War II-era in the service of the United States Navy from 1943 to 1946 and 1951 to 1965.

== History ==
===World War II===
&quot;Trathen&quot; was named after Lieutenant Commander James Trathen, commander of USS Midnight (1861) during the American Civil War. She was laid down on 17 March 1942 at San Francisco, California, by the Bethlehem Steel Co.; launched on 22 October 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Cassin Young, wife of Captain Cassin Young who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his valor as commanding officer of &quot;Vestal&quot; (AR-4) during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor; and commissioned on 28 May 1943.

====1943====
Following training operations in the Hawaiian area, &quot;Trathen&quot; joined Rear Admiral Willis A. Lee&#x27;s Task Force (TF) 11 to take part in the reoccupation of Baker Island. The target isle, a tiny elliptical speck of land, lay nearer to the Japanese-held northern Gilbert Islands than Funafuti in the Ellice group and presented a valuable staging area for projected aerial search and photo reconnaissance missions against the Japanese mandates. Lee, in &quot;Hercules&quot; (AK-41), led TF 11&#x27;s sortie from Pearl Harbor on 25 August 1943, and his ships arrived off Baker on 1 September. While the transports and &quot;Ashland&quot; (LSD-1) disembarked their troops and disgorged their cargoes shoreward, &quot;Trathen&quot; stood by and provided fighter-direction services to the Grumman F6F Hellcats from &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; (CVL-24) and &quot;Princeton&quot; (CVL-23). During the action, the destroyer directed the F6F&#x27;s to a radar contact 32 miles away. They soon came upon the snooping Kawanishi H8K (Allied identifier: &quot;Emily&quot;) flying boat and dispatched her so fast that no radio report from the Japanese got out over the airwaves. Two days later, &quot;Trathen&quot; again vectored the Hellcats to another &quot;Emily&quot; which they also splashed into the sea.

With Baker secure and the priceless airfield constructed and ready for use by 11 September, &quot;Trathen&quot; headed for Hawaii. On 29 September, the ship commenced screening operations for Task Group (TG) 14.5, as it sortied from Pearl Harbor, bound for Wake Island. Under the command of Rear Admiral Alfred E. Montgomery, this fast carrier task force—the largest yet assembled—consisted of &quot;Essex&quot; (CV-9), &quot;Yorktown&quot; (CV-10), &quot;Lexington&quot; (CV-16), &quot;Cowpens&quot; (CVL-25), &quot;Independence&quot; (CVL-22), and &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;. On 5 and 6 October, Montgomery&#x27;s planes made six strikes, flying 738 combat sorties while battleships and cruisers provided their heavy gunfire for further harassment of the Japanese-held island. Despite a cracked high-pressure turbine casing, &quot;Trathen&quot; retired with the task force back toward the Hawaiian Islands and arrived at Pearl Harbor on the 11th.

Temporary patching at Pearl Harbor permitted the destroyer to proceed to Bremerton, Washington, and permanent repairs at the Puget Sound Navy Yard. The ship sailed for the Hawaiian Islands on 21 November and reached Pearl Harbor six days later. Following training exercises with land-based aircraft off Oahu, &quot;Trathen&quot;&#x27;s commanding officer was designated Commander, Task Unit (TU) 16.15.2, and his ship joined &quot;Martin&quot; (DE-30) and SS &quot;Mormacport&quot;. The ships sailed via Canton Island, Funafuti, and Tarawa to Makin Island where they arrived on 18 December. The next day, the destroyer sped 125 miles to the scene of a downed PBY Catalina, rescued the patrol bomber&#x27;s crew, and returned to Makin on the 20th. On the return leg of the mission, the ship&#x27;s radar picked up a formation of Japanese medium bombers bound for the Gilberts. Evidently attracted to bigger game, the bombers sped on. However, one which passed over the ship was taken under fire but apparently suffered no damage.

After pressing on to Abemama Island, &quot;Trathen&quot; and &quot;Le Hardy&quot; (DE-20) got underway on Christmas Day 1943 to escort SS &quot;Mormacport&quot; back to Hawaii. One day out, an &quot;Emily&quot; spotted the three-ship convoy but stayed tantalizingly out of reach of the Allied ships&#x27; guns. Detaching &quot;Le Hardy&quot; that evening, &quot;Trathen&quot; and &quot;Mormacport&quot; proceeded on to Hawaii and arrived at Pearl Harbor on New Year&#x27;s Day 1944.

====1944====
&quot;Trathen&quot; conducted gunnery exercises in the Hawaiian area before departing Pearl Harbor on 23 January, bound for the Marshall Islands.

Entering Kwajalein lagoon on 2 February, &quot;Trathen&quot; relieved &quot;Schroeder&quot; (DD-501) off Kwajalein Island as a fire-support ship and shelled Japanese positions ashore until the fire control party could locate no further targets. On the 5th, &quot;Trathen&quot; joined &quot;McCord&quot; (DD-534) and cruisers &quot;Minneapolis&quot; (CA-36) and &quot;San Francisco&quot; (CA-38) off Gugegwe delivering support fire for the three battalions of marines, embarked in six LST&#x27;s, as they swarmed ashore in LVT(A)s and 17 amphtrac vehicles, with 16 M4 Sherman tanks. At 0720, &quot;Trathen&quot; commenced fire with her main battery, sending 5-inch shells whistling shoreward. The destroyer and her consorts then stood by as the landing craft reached the beach.

&quot;Trathen&quot; continued to provide gunfire support until the Kwajalein operations ended on 7 February. The destroyer headed for Majuro on the 8th and arrived there the next day. On the 10th, &quot;Trathen&quot; returned to Kwajalein to conduct antisubmarine patrols.

&quot;Trathen&quot; next formed up with &quot;Indianapolis&quot; (CA-35) off Eniwetok. Based on an intelligence report that the island was unoccupied, the American warships carried out relatively light bombardment. In the meantime, analysis of papers captured at Kwajalein revealed that Eniwetok was, in fact, defended by tough, crack Japanese troops.

Too late for a radical change of plans, &quot;Indianapolis&quot; and near-sister &quot;Portland&quot; (CA-33), accompanied by &quot;Trathen&quot; and &quot;Hoel&quot; (DD-533), stationed themselves on the flanks of the LCI(G)&#x27;s, with waves of LVT&#x27;s in the middle. &quot;Trathen&quot; screened the former cruiser while &quot;Hoel&quot; drew the latter, and the ships joined the gunboats (LCI(G)) in firing on the island.

Eniwetok soon fell to the mailed fist of American land and sea power. &quot;Trathen&quot; furnished fire support intermittently until the 29th of the month and thereafter remained at Eniwetok until 4 March when she headed for Majuro for a tender availability. Then, following exercises at Purvis Bay in the Solomon Islands and patrol duty between the Emirau and New Hanover Islands, &quot;Trathen&quot; subsequently joined the 7th Fleet on 3 May.

The destroyer departed Manus, in the Admiralty Islands, on 15 May in company with TF 74 and 75, bound for New Guinea waters. The target island, Wakde—occupied in 1942 by the Japanese—possessed an excellent airstrip and vital facilities which would be immensely useful to the Allies as they &quot;island-hopped&quot; closer to the Philippines and Japan. Arriving on the 17th, &quot;Trathen&quot; provided gunfire support for the force which landed on Wakde and later operated off the coast supporting the operation until the 25th, when the ship sailed for Biak Island.

The next target on the Navy&#x27;s timetable, this island—the largest of the Schouten Islands group—lay fringed with coral reefs. The attack force scheduled to bombard the island arrived off the landing beaches 15 minutes ahead of schedule; and, at 0629 on the morning of 27 May, the 6-inch guns of cruisers &quot;Phoenix&quot; (CL-46), &quot;Boise&quot; (CL-47), and &quot;Nashville&quot; (CL-43) began lobbing the first of 1,000 rounds of shells shoreward, while the destroyers looked for &quot;game&quot; along the landing beaches—such as small Japanese patrol craft.

At 1100, four Japanese fighters made half-hearted passes over the airstrips on Biak. Two fighter-bombers came over late in the afternoon shortly thereafter followed by four twin-engined planes—three of which were destroyed by antiaircraft fire. The fourth was damaged. &quot;Trathen&quot; remained on patrol station off the Schoetens until 31 May, when she retired to Humboldt Bay to rejoin TF 75.

The Japanese&#x27; first reinforcement attempt towards Biak had been detected, and the Nipponese had turned back. On 3 June, as the enemy was retreating, TF 74 and 75 received orders to go after the fleeing Japanese. At 23:18 on 3 June, &quot;Trathen&quot; got underway with the other units of Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 48 and gave chase. The next day, 10 Japanese Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers tried to pounce on the American force but were driven off. On the 5th, Japanese torpedo bombers attacked American forces, and one of them fell to &quot;Trathen&quot;&#x27;s heavy antiaircraft fire.

Subsequently, the enemy launched a second effort aimed at reinforcing their beleaguered outpost on Biak. Six Japanese destroyers—three with troops embarked and three towing landing barges—joined cruisers &quot;Aoba&quot; and &quot;Kinu&quot; north of Misool Island, west of the &quot;parrot beak&quot; of New Guinea. The enemy force was under Rear Admiral Naomasa Sakonju in destroyer &quot;Shikinami&quot;. Proceeding towards Biak, the Japanese reinforcement group remained undetected until 10 B-25 Mitchells, escorted by P-38 Lightnings, spotted them and launched a devastating attack which sank &quot;Harusame&quot; and damaged three of her sister destroyers. Resuming the run to Biak once the planes had departed, the Japanese continued on an unknowing collision course with Vice Admiral V.A.C. Crutchley&#x27;s cruisers and destroyers prowling between Biak and Hollandia.

Unaware of Sakonju&#x27;s position, Crutchley decided to commence a sweep parallel to the coast of Biak. About 2200 on the night of 8 June, a PB4Y bomber on night patrol, detected the Nipponese force and reported five unidentified ships making 12 knots in the direction of Crutchley&#x27;s cruisers and destroyers. Deploying for battle on a northerly course, the British Admiral ordered his ships to general quarters. The Japanese simultaneously detected the American&#x27;s presence and turned to fire torpedo spreads before retiring.

&quot;Trathen&quot;, in DesDiv 48, followed astern of DesDivs 42 and 47, under orders from Crutchley to pursue the fleeing enemy. Then, while the two divisions charged ahead on the heels of the retreating Nipponese, &quot;Trathen&quot; and her division mates fell back on orders to screen Crutchley&#x27;s cruisers.

The American force never caught up with the enemy and returned to Humboldt Bay on the following day. &quot;Trathen&quot; subsequently participated in the invasion of Noemfoor Island. Assigned to TG 77.2, the covering force, she conducted shore bombardment missions there on 2 July before retiring to Humboldt Bay. She later served in the covering forces during the landings at Cape Sansapor, New Guinea, on 30 July, laying smoke screens and patrolling 25 miles off shoreline to cover the invasion.

Recreation and availability at Sydney, Australia, from 13–20 August, provided &quot;Trathen&quot;&#x27;s officers and men with a welcome respite from the toils of war. Heading back north after a week of Australian hospitality, the destroyer conducted exercises and drills in the vicinity of Purvis Bay in preparation for the Western Carolines Operation. On 6 September, she departed from Purvis Bay as part of TG 32.5. After screening the carriers as they launched devastating air strikes in support of the Palau invasion, the destroyer retired on 26 September to refuel and replenish depleted ammunition stocks in Kossol Passage.

With the dissolution of her task, the destroyer headed for Manus and arrived there on 2 October. Next assigned to TG 77.4, &quot;Trathen&quot; set her course towards Leyte Gulf in the Philippine Islands. Landings on Dinagat and Suluan Islands in the entrance to Leyte Gulf commenced on the 17th; and the destroyer stood by to provide antiaircraft and gunfire support. Three days later, three Japanese fighters roared low over the area which &quot;Trathen&quot; was guarding. Within minutes, the ship&#x27;s gunners splashed their second plane of the war; and the destroyer even managed to capture the aircraft&#x27;s pilot whom they transferred to carrier &quot;Sangamon&quot; (CVE-26).

Again on the 24th, Japanese aircraft harassed the ships of the invasion force, and the alert combat air patrol (CAP) downed two more of the enemy. &quot;Trathen&quot; retired to Manus early in November but returned to Leyte Gulf on the 16th for patrols in Surigao Strait. Relieving &quot;Sigourney&quot; (DD-643) on the 19th, &quot;Trathen&quot; remained in the Philippines until the 23d when she headed to the Western Carolines. After sinking a medium barge with 5-inch and 40-millimeter fire en route, she reached Ulithi on 25 November.

Exercises off Ulithi occupied the ship from 30 November to 29 December before &quot;Trathen&quot; joined TG 38.2 on 5 January 1945. She served as plane guard and screening vessel for this group and TG 38.5 through the end of the month. The former group participated in preinvasion strikes on the island of Luzon before turning to the South China Sea for a series of strikes on Japanese-held Taiwan from 9 to 11 January. The French Indochina coast next received its share of attention, with Japanese shipping and coastal installations feeling the might of the American naval air arm. Then, moving northward against virtually no opposition from Japanese planes or ships, the task group aircraft bombed Hong Kong and Hainan Island. Monsoon and typhoon-type winds and seas buffeted the group on the 17th and 18th, with &quot;Trathen&quot;&#x27;s inclinometer registering a staggering 67 degrees from the vertical at the height of the storm.

====1945====
After leaving the South China Sea through the Balintang Channel, &quot;Trathen&quot; and her mates participated in more strikes against Taiwan and in raids on Sakishima Gunto which served Japan as a staging area for the kamikazes. In the course of her plane-guarding duties, &quot;Trathen&quot; steamed astern of &quot;Hancock&quot; (CV-19) on 21 January and witnessed the detonation of a Grumman TBF Avenger as it landed hard on the flight deck. One man was blown overboard by the explosion, but &quot;Trathen&quot; soon fished him from the water.

Following the strikes on Okinawa, &quot;Trathen&quot; got underway from Ulithi on 10 February to support carrier operations between Iwo Jima and the Japanese home islands. Six days later, TF 58 commenced the first strikes against Tokyo launched from 150 miles south east of the Imperial city. After a night retirement, the group conducted further strikes the next day. With the landings at Iwo Jima, &quot;Trathen&quot; arrived in the vicinity on the 20th and screened the carriers as they conducted air strikes for the next four days supporting the American marines fighting for that fanatically defended island.

The force swept north with &quot;Trathen&quot; in its screen and arrived at a point off Tokyo at dawn on the 25th to launch strikes to hit the Japanese capital again. That night, the carriers steamed in the direction of Nagoya, but heavy weather cancelled the strikes scheduled to be launched against that industrial city on the 26th. While in Japanese waters, &quot;Trathen&quot; and her division mates sighted a number of floating mines. The destroyer herself sank one with gun fire on 27 February.

Following availability at Ulithi, &quot;Trathen&quot; returned to the &quot;front lines&quot; on 14 March, rendezvousing with TG 58.4 in preparations for air strikes on the Japanese home islands and on Okinawa. Temporarily detached to pick up a downed pilot, the destroyer rejoined the group as it plowed on towards Japan. She later sank several more floating mines while screening the carriers against air attacks. Slashing through CAP and antiaircraft fire, some kamikazes managed to crash into their targets and give their lives for the Emperor. Antiaircraft fire from &quot;Trathen&quot;&#x27;s group accounted for five of the winged marauders, but one hit &quot;Intrepid&quot; (CV-11) on 18 March.

Nine days later, &quot;Trathen&quot;, in company with battle cruisers &quot;Guam&quot; (CB-2) and &quot;Alaska&quot; (CB-1), cruisers &quot;Flint&quot; (CL-97) and &quot;San Diego&quot; (CL-53) and four other destroyers left the carriers to bombard Minamidaitōjima. All ships shelled the target area with impunity. The battlecruisers, light cruisers, and destroyers rejoined the carriers on 28 March and resumed their screening duties.

In the months that followed, American forces—aided by the small British Far East Fleet—continued hammering at the Japanese homeland with air strikes and bombardments by surface ships. On 11 April, still attached to TF 58, &quot;Trathen&quot; hammered away at attacking Japanese planes with her antiaircraft batteries. During the third raid that day, a 5-inch shell from a &quot;friendly&quot; ship hit the destroyer near her number five 5-inch mount handling room. It killed three men, wounded 21, and rendered the after mount inoperative.

Tender availability soon made good the damage, and &quot;Trathen&quot; returned to the Fleet. Departing Ulithi on 3 May, she rejoined TF 58 on the 5th near Okinawa. Six days later, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; (CV-17), flagship of TF 58, was hit by a kamikaze. Another Japanese pilot, with similar intentions for &quot;Trathen&quot;, dived toward the destroyer. While the ship&#x27;s guns hammered at the suicide plane, help came from the air. A &quot;friendly&quot; fighter, braving the antiaircraft fire from his own ships, also attacked the kamikaze which crashed into the sea off &quot;Trathen&quot;&#x27;s port bow.

Anchoring in Ulithi lagoon for a needed rest, &quot;Trathen&quot; got underway again 10 days later and sortied with TG 58.4 to screen the carrier.

On 4 June, air operations were cancelled as the barometer began to plummet. The storm center of a typhoon passed some 70 miles to the southeast, and the ships in company with &quot;Trathen&quot; emerged unscathed from the fringes of the storm. On 6 June, while carrying out plane-guard duties, the destroyer rescued the two-man crew of a downed SB2C Helldiver. She recovered both men, but the pilot was dead when he was brought on board.

These operations proved to be &quot;Trathen&quot;&#x27;s last of World War II, for she soon departed Leyte to begin the long voyage back to the United States. After a stop at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Trathen&quot; arrived at Seattle, Washington, on 9 July 1945, for an overhaul at the Todd Shipbuilding Co. While the destroyer was in the shipyard, the war in the Pacific ended. Upon completion of the refit, the ship sailed for San Diego on 29 September and arrived there on 2 October. On 18 January 1946, &quot;Trathen&quot; was decommissioned and berthed with the San Diego Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet.

=== Post-World War II ===
When North Korean forces swept southward across the 38th parallel on 25 June 1950, the United States soon came to the aid of the embattled South Koreans. Called out of reserve service on 14 June 1951, &quot;Trathen&quot; was recommissioned on 1 August. As flagship of Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 28, the ship was transferred to the Atlantic Fleet on 5 October, based at Norfolk, Virginia, and operated off the east coast and in the Caribbean through the end of 1952.

Subsequently ordered to the Far East, &quot;Trathen&quot; arrived at Sasebo, Japan, on 12 February 1953. During her Korean deployment, &quot;Trathen&quot;&#x27;s main and secondary batteries pounded railroad lines, trains, bunkers, and transformer stations. On 11 March, the destroyer joined the &quot;Train Buster Club&quot; when she destroyed a railroad train. Two days later, after the ship completed her patrols between Wonsan and Hungnam, she was relieved on station to return to Sasebo for repairs. Later becoming a part of TF 77, &quot;Trathen&quot; continued on duty until 7 June. She departed Sasebo on the following day, bound for Hong Kong.

Returning to the United States via Southeast Asia and the Mediterranean, &quot;Trathen&quot; operated with the Atlantic Fleet until January 1955, when she was transferred back to the Pacific Fleet and subsequently deployed to the Western Pacific (WestPac). On 21 April, &quot;Trathen&quot; departed Long Beach, California to begin successive WestPac deployments which would last through 1964, interspersed with tours of duty on the west coast. When in the Orient, she followed a varied itinerary visiting such ports as Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Hong Kong; Sasebo and Yokosuka, Japan; as well as Pearl Harbor, Guam, Midway, and Subic Bay. During this period, she took part in antisubmarine, antiaircraft, and other exercises; served as plane guard when operating with fast carrier forces, and patrolled the Taiwan Strait as part of American forces protecting that island.

While &quot;Trathen&quot; was at Kaohsiung during her last deployment to WestPac, word arrived early in August of the Gulf of Tonkin Incident. Getting underway shortly thereafter, &quot;Trathen&quot; operated at sea throughout the remainder of the month but for brief replenishments at Kaohsiung. Relieved on station, &quot;Trathen&quot; sailed for Hong Kong to serve as station ship before traveling to the South China Sea to support naval operations off the coast of the Republic of Vietnam. On 8 October 1964, the destroyer departed for eastern waters and proceeded via Guam and Midway to the west coast.

=== Fate ===
After arriving at Long Beach on 28 October, the destroyer conducted routine carrier operations off the west coast. On 12 February 1965, &quot;Trathen&quot; reported to the Commander, San Diego Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet, to begin her second inactivation period at the Todd Shipyard, San Pedro, California. On 15 March, she made her final voyage at the end of a towline. Brought to San Diego, she completed the process of deactivation and was decommissioned on 11 May 1965 and placed in reserve. A survey of the ship conducted in June 1972 reported that the costs of modernization to &quot;Trathen&quot; would be disproportionate to the value of the ship. Accordingly, &quot;Trathen&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 November 1972 and scrapped.

== Honors ==
&quot;Trathen&quot; received eight battle stars for World War II service and two for Korean War service.

<text>Lino César Oviedo Silva (23 September 1943 – 2 February 2013) was a Paraguayan army officer and politician, who was the leader of the National Union of Ethical Citizens, which split from the Colorado Party in 2002.

==Life and work==

===Early career===
Oviedo was born in poverty in the town of Juan de Mena (Cordillera Department) on September 23, 1943. He chose a military career, studied in Germany and eventually became a close aide to General Andrés Rodríguez. He was named chief of the Army in 1993. When President Juan Carlos Wasmosy asked him to step down from that position in April 1996, he allegedly refused and attempted a coup d&#x27;etat. After days of tension, Wasmosy offered him the Defence Ministry instead, but when Oviedo went to the presidential palace to take the oath, dressed in civilian clothes, the President, backed by popular demonstrations, withdrew the offer.

Ousted from the military, he concentrated in winning the ruling Colorado Party&#x27;s candidacy for the 1998 presidential elections, and succeeded by presenting a populist platform through his great rhetorical skills. A month before the national elections, and while leading the polls, he was finally condemned to a ten-year prison term for his 1996 military mutiny. His running mate Raúl Cubas continued the campaign and eventually won the elections, largely based on the promise to free Oviedo, which in fact he did days after taking office, over the protest of the Paraguayan Supreme Court and opposition leaders.

In March 1999, vice president Luis María Argaña, a key political enemy of both Oviedo and President Cubas, was assassinated. In the midst of riots and political turmoil known as &quot;Marzo paraguayo&quot; (&quot;Paraguayan March&quot;), Cubas resigned, abandoning Oviedo, who fled into exile, first in Argentina and then in Brazil.

===Imprisonment and release (2004-2007)===
On June 28, 2004, he returned to Paraguay and was detained by the police, who took him to the Military Prison of Viñas Cué, located a short distance from Asunción. Initially sentenced to a ten-year term, he was released on parole for good behavior on 6 September 2007.

In November 2006, a Paraguayan man, Tomás Velázquez, held a hunger strike before he crucified himself publicly as a protest in Asunción. He maintained that Oviedo was the target of political persecution and that the military tribunal that convicted him for his alleged participation in a subversive plot was illegal according to the constitution, as it had been conducted in time of peace.

On 30 October 2007, Oviedo&#x27;s conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court in an eight to one decision following testimony from former officers that there had been no coup attempt. The ruling left Oviedo free to run in the April 2008 presidential election.

===Later political career===
In January 2008 he was nominated as the candidate of his party, the National Union of Ethical Citizens (UNACE), without opposition. He lost the 2008 Paraguayan presidential election, to Fernando Lugo getting 22.8% of votes.

Lino Oviedo&#x27;s similarly-named nephew, Lino César Oviedo Sánchez, has been a member of the Senate of Paraguay for UNACE since 2008.

==Death==
On the night of 2 February 2013, Lino Cesar Oviedo died in a helicopter accident near Puerto Antequera, in the Chaco region. He was flying back to Asunción after an electoral rally held in the city of Concepción. His death was confirmed the following day by a national police rescue team.

<text>Gaoyao, alternately romanized as Koyiu, is an urban district of Zhaoqing in western Guangdong, China. Its population in 2020 was 741,591.

==Name==
Gaoyao () is a former name of the Lingyang Gorge on the Xi River. It was originally the name of the surrounding land but came to be used for the area&#x27;s seat of government. Gaoyao is the pinyin romanization of the Chinese name, based on its Mandarin pronunciation; the former Chinese Postal Map spelling was based on the local Cantonese pronunciation of the same name. Gaoyao has also sometimes been romanized as KaouYaou.

==Geography==
Gaoyao is located on the southern bank of the Xi River, opposite central Zhaoqing. Both are about away from Guangzhou, the provincial capital.

==Climate==

==History==
Gaoyao was a county of the Qin and Han and its eponymous county seat was the principal settlement of the area. Under the Sui, the administration relocated across the river to Duanzhou, which was renamed Zhaoqing under the Song. Gaoyao continued as a separate county in Zhaoqing Commandery. It was promoted to a county-level city in 1993 and later to urban district status.

==Culture and people==
* Gaoyao is closely connected with the Duanzhou District of Zhaoqing City, geographically as well as culturally. The two urban districts are connected by two road bridges and a railway bridge.
* Gaoyao is also a known hometown for many Overseas Chinese. There is a large community from Gaoyao in Sydney, Australia.

Notable figures include:
* Liang Han Chao (梁寒操): historian, educator, and also founder of Kwangtung cultural and history periodical.
* Herbert Chow Ciu Lung (周小龍): founder of chickeeduck clothing, also a Hong Kong social activist.
* Joshua Wong Chi-fung (黃之鋒): Hong Kong male politician
* Fong Lai Ying (方麗盈): Hong Kong experienced female singer

<text>Appalachia Service Project or ASP is a non-governmental organization which was founded in 1969. ASP addresses substandard housing using volunteer labor to perform repairs to make homes &quot;warmer, safer, and drier.&quot; ASP operates in Central Appalachia, specifically in the states of Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. The mission statement of ASP is &quot;Appalachia Service Project is a Christian ministry, open to all people, that inspires hope and service through volunteer home repair in Central Appalachia,&quot; and ASP&#x27;s vision is that &quot;substandard housing in Central Appalachia will be eradicated and that everyone who comes into contact with this ministry will be transformed.&quot; Repairs are made using volunteer labor and at no cost to the homeowner. Between 1969 and 2015, ASP hosted 377,412 volunteers and performed repairs on 17,373 homes.

==History==
ASP was founded in 1969 by Rev. Glenn &quot;Tex&quot; Evans, who emphasized the importance of providing service to those in need &quot;right where they are, just the way they are.&quot; While working as a director at Henderson Settlement in Frakes, Kentucky, Evans saw first hand the need for assistance in home repairs among his neighbors. Later when he became a staff member of the Board Of Discipleship of the United Methodist Church in Nashville TN, he took several weeks off from his preaching schedule to recruit 50 teens and their adult counselors to repair four homes in Barbourville, Kentucky. This initiative has evolved into the Appalachia Service Project, which currently mobilizes between 15,000 and 17,000 volunteers each year to provide repairs to more than 500 families.[1]

ASP continued to grow between 1969 and 1976 by sponsoring regional workshops across the country to educate volunteers about the Appalachian region, bringing ASP&#x27;s volunteers together to discuss their experiences and discuss replication of ASP&#x27;s home repair model in their home communities. As an outgrowth of this vision, ASP expanded its work outside of the Central Appalachian region during the summer of 1976, sponsoring work crews in Arkansas, California, Alabama, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and Kentucky. Although ASP returned to its Central Appalachian roots the following summer, the Sierra Service Project in California became a successful spin-off and still exists today.

Throughout the summer, ASP hosts volunteers aged 14 years and up. More than 14,000 youth, college, and adult volunteer groups come to Central Appalachian Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia to perform home repairs during the months of June and July. Volunteer groups perform a week a service and are housed in one of ASP&#x27;s 26 &quot;summer centers&quot;, often schools or community centers that have been leased by ASP. ASP staff provide direction for home repair projects and supply tools, construction materials, and three meals each day.

===Year-Round Program===
In 1980, ASP established the first of its permanent facilities, the Jonesville Housing Services Center in Lee County, VA. Prior to the development of this property, ASP had operated as a summer program only. The Housing Services Center, however, established a year-round home rehabilitation program in Jonesville, VA, available to low-income homeowners and advised by a council of local residents.

Follow a 1989 capital campaign, ASP acquired and renovated a second housing services center in Chavies, KY to serve residents of Perry County throughout the year. The third year-round center, located in Brenton, WV was acquired in 1996, when the Wyoming County school board offered ASP permanent use of the former Guyan Valley Elementary School facility.

ASP continues to host volunteers for a week or shorter periods of time throughout the year at these permanent facilities. Volunteers who participate in the year-round program are matched with projects to suit their skills and level of construction experience. Although year-round centers welcome youth volunteers, the program focus is geared more specifically to adult and college-aged groups, and evening programming is not required for all groups. Moreover, volunteers with the year-round program stay in facilities that are climate-controlled and offer amenities such as bunk beds and indoor showers.

The operations of the Year-Round Program are supervised by ASP&#x27;s &quot;Fellows&quot;. The ASP Fellowship was first established through a donation from the Lily Endowment, and includes seminars and activities designed to facilitate the process of vocational discernment. During their year of service, ASP&#x27;s Fellows live in and immerse themselves in the community they work alongside, in addition to supervising and guiding work groups through their assigned construction projects.

===College Service Project (CSP)===
ASP&#x27;s founder, Tex Evans, always said: &quot;We&#x27;d love for all ASP volunteers to come back each summer, but if they don&#x27;t because they have started this in their own community, we&#x27;d love that even more.&quot; CSP chapters use ASP&#x27;s model for home repair to plan and complete projects in their own community. CSP was launched in September, 2014 and 12 Campus Chapters are currently in operation. These chapters are student-run, student-led organizations on college campuses that are nationally affiliated with ASP. The mission statement of CSP is &quot;College Service Project inspires students to lives of Christian service and leadership through home repair for low-income families in Central Appalachia and back in their home communities.&quot;

Students involved with CSP also volunteer with ASP and carry out a trip to one of ASP&#x27;s Year Round centers during the fall, winter, or spring; fundraise and gain community sponsorship in order to raise the funds necessary to complete their projects; and recruit volunteers from within their community as well as potential applicants for ASP&#x27;s Summer Staff program. Furthermore, members of CSP chapters are encouraged to serve with their communities in other ways that promote social justice and are compatible with the guiding principles of ASP.

In addition, CSP provides college students with the opportunity to develop professional skills outside of a classroom setting. The various activities performed by CSP chapters provide students with hands-on experience in construction management, community development, marketing, grant writing, fundraising, recruitment, and volunteer management.

===Long-Term Recovery Program===
Launched in response to flooding in the Dry Creek and Cash Hollow communities of Washington County, Tennessee in August 2012, ASP operates a disaster recovery program designed to assist low-income families in the Central Appalachian region rebuild following disasters such as fires or floods.

Following the June 23, 2016 floods in West Virginia, ASP launched the Rebuilding Rainelle initiative to assist families in Rainelle, WV and surrounding towns. This program, which has been implemented by ASP in partnership with Homes for White Sulphur Springs, the St. Bernard Project, and Neighbors Loving Neighbors completed the first new home for a flood survivor in West Virginia on November 22, 2016. ASP expects to complete 60 new homes for flood survivors and will continue work through 2017.

===New Build Appalachia===
ASP began constructing new homes in 1985 to help those in Central Appalachia achieve decent, safe, and sanitary housing and to complement the home repair ministry. Since that time, 201 new homes have been built in primarily Tennessee, Virginia, and Kentucky. Although the program was temporarily suspended during the 2000s due to operating deficits, the program was relaunched following the success of the new build program developed in the aftermath of the Dry Creek floods.

ASP&#x27;s New Build Appalachia program provides mortgage-free new homes to families in East Tennessee and has constructed 22 new homes since 2014. The recipients of these homes are typically low-income families whose homes are beyond repair.

===Race to Build===
Race to Build is an annual event hosted by ASP in partnership with the Bristol Motor Speedway in Bristol, Tennessee. During the Spring Race in 2016, volunteers from as far north as Washington, D.C., down to Tri Cities, Tennessee, came together to build a home for a veteran, his wife, and two adopted children at the speedway. Volunteers were challenged to push the limits of how quickly it would be possible to build a house. In just one week, the house was completely built and furnished, and was dedicated on the morning of the Food City 500. After construction was completed, the home was moved to a permanent location for the family.

Looking to the future, ASP will continue to partner with the Bristol Motor Speedway to create spin-offs of this event. In spring of 2017, three colleges will compete to build a house as quickly as they can in just 3 ½ days. They will be measured on speed, accuracy, safety, and other factors, and the winning college will bring home a scholarship and claims to first place.

<text>Ben Moon (born 13 June 1966) is a rock climber from England. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Moon, along with climbing partner Jerry Moffatt, were the two strongest British rock climbers and were key pioneers in the development of standards in international sport climbing. In 1991, Moon made the first-ever redpoint in history of a consensus grade climbing route with his ascent of &quot;Hubble.

== Climbing career ==
Moon&#x27;s first officially declared routes had somewhat controversial names. The routes were both in France and had been previously attempted for a long time by local climbers. After climbing them Moon named them after French military disasters, first the Maginot Line, at Volx, and secondly Agincourt, at Buoux. On 8 June 2015, Moon redpointed the Steve McClure route &quot;Rainshadow&quot;, , at Malham Cove in North Yorkshire, England.

== Business ventures ==
In 2002, Moon founded his climbing clothing and equipment company, Moon Climbing, after splitting from his previous company, S7. One of Moon Climbing&#x27;s most popular products is the MoonBoard, an overhanging climbing wall used to train dynamic climbing.

== Notable ascents ==

* &quot;Statement of Youth&quot; , Lower Pen Trwyn (UK), first ascent (1984)
* &quot;Hubble&quot; , Raven Tor (UK), first ascent (1990)
* &quot;Voyager (low start)&quot; , Burbage (UK), first ascent (2006) 
* &quot;Rainshadow&quot; , Malham Cove (UK), repeat ascent (2015)

<doc id="860388" wikidata="Q5089133" url="?curid=860388" title="Checking In">
<text>Checking In is an American sitcom television series and a spin-off of &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; that aired for four episodes on CBS from April 9 to April 30, 1981.

==Synopsis==
In the seventh season finale of &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, &quot;Florence&#x27;s New Job&quot;, the Jeffersons&#x27; maid, Florence Johnston (Marla Gibbs), accepted a job to become the executive housekeeper at the fictional St. Frederick Hotel in New York City. The series follows Florence&#x27;s misadventures at the hotel with her co-workers: Lyle Block, her stuffy manager; Elena Beltran, her assistant; Earl Bellamy, the inept house detective; Hank Sabatino, the lewd handyman; Betty, the floor supervisor; Dennis, the bellboy; and Mr. Claymore, the hotel owner.

==Cast==
* Marla Gibbs as Florence Johnston
* Larry Linville as Lyle Block
* Ruth Brown as Betty
* Patrick Collins as Earl Bellamy
* Robert Costanzo as Hank Sabatino
* Jordan Gibbs as Dennis
* Liz Torres as Elena Beltran
* John Anderson as Mr. Claymore

==Episodes==
==Reception==
&quot;Checking In&quot; premiered on CBS on April 9, 1981, and lasted for only four episodes in the Thursday, 8:00 p.m. ET timeslot. Faced with low ratings, the series was cancelled, and the final episode aired on April 30, 1981. Gibbs then returned to her regular role on &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; and it was explained that the St. Frederick Hotel had burned down.

&quot;Checking In&quot; was the first &quot;All in the Family&quot; spin-off series that was not successful, unlike &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, &quot;Maude&quot; and Maude spin-off &quot;Good Times&quot;. Other failed spin-off attempts were &quot;Gloria&quot; in the 1982-1983 season and &quot;704 Hauser&quot; in 1994.

==Home media==
The third episode, &quot;Whose Side Are You On?&quot;, was added as a bonus feature on &quot;The Jeffersons: The Complete Series&quot; 33-disc DVD set issued by Shout! Factory.

<doc id="860391" wikidata="Q753072" url="?curid=860391" title="Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society">
<text>The Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society is the highest award given by the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS). The RAS Council have &quot;complete freedom as to the grounds on which it is awarded&quot; and it can be awarded for any reason. Past awards have been given for &quot;outstanding personal researches in the fields of astronomy and geophysics&quot; as well as general contributions to astronomy and geophysics &quot;that may be made through leadership in research programmes, through education and through scientific administration&quot;. It has been awarded both for research that has taken a lifetime (it has most frequently been given to recognise an extraordinary lifetime achievement), and for specific pieces of research.

==History==
The RAS was founded in 1820 and the first Gold Medals were awarded in 1824. Silver medals were also awarded in 1824 and 1827, but that practice was quickly abandoned, instead the RAS established other awards.

In the early years, more than one medal was often awarded in a year, but by 1833 only one medal was being awarded per year. This caused a problem when Neptune was discovered in 1846, because many felt an award should jointly be made to John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. A controversy arose and no award was made in 1847. The controversy was resolved by giving 12 &quot;testimonial&quot; awards in 1848 to various people including Adams and Le Verrier, and in 1849 awards resumed, with a limit of one per year. Adams and Le Verrier did not get their gold medals until 1866 and 1868, respectively. Adams, who was then President of the RAS, presented Le Verrier with the medal.

In some years, particularly early on, the RAS sometimes decided that there were no suitable nominations and so did not award the gold medal. There are therefore 17 years without an award, the most recent being 1942 (on that occasion due to the disruption of the Second World War). One medal per year was the usual practise, although two medals were awarded in both 1867 and 1886. To ensure balance in research areas, in 1964 the award was expanded to two medals per year, one in astronomy (including astrophysics, cosmology etc.) and one in geophysics (including planetary science, tectonics etc.), which remains the current system. All recipients are listed below, along with the years when no award was made.

The first woman to receive the Gold Medal was Caroline Herschel in 1828. No other woman received the award until Vera Rubin in 1996. Margaret and Geoffrey Burbidge were jointly awarded the 2005 Gold Medal in astronomy, the first joint award since 1886.

The medal features an image of the 40-foot telescope constructed by Sir William Herschel, the first President of the RAS.

<doc id="860397" wikidata="Q5076816" url="?curid=860397" title="Charles Dellschau">
<text>Charles August Albert Dellschau (4 June 1830 Brandenburg, Prussia – 20 April 1923 Houston, Texas) was a Prussian-American who gained posthumous fame after the discovery of his large scrapbooks that contained drawings, collages and watercolors of airplanes and airships. He has been classified as one of the first visionary artists. 

==Life==
Little is known about Charles Dellschau&#x27;s life. Primary sources are scarce and secondary sources often contain contradictory information. It is known that he emigrated from Brandenburg, Prussia to Texas in 1850, where he worked as a butcher. In 1860, Dellschau received his letter of citizenship in Fort Bend County, and in 1861 he married Antonia Hilt, the widow of Pierre Hilt, who already had a daughter from her previous marriage. Charles Dellschau&#x27;s marriage to Antonia took place in Richmond, Texas., and at some point after the marriage, Charles started working as a sales clerk in his in-laws&#x27; saddlery shop. In addition to his stepdaughter, Dellschau had three children: two daughters, Bertha and Mary, and a son, Edward, who died in 1877 at age 6. Dellschau&#x27;s wife, Antonia, died in the same year, leaving her husband a widower at age 47.

In 1865 Dellschau signed the Civil War Amnesty Oath, indicating that he was a soldier for the Confederate States Army. In this document Charles Dellschau is described as a fair complexioned man of 5&#x27;3&quot; with auburn hair and hazel eyes.

After his retirement in 1899, he lived with his stepdaughter and her husband, and worked in their attic apartment in Houston, Texas, where he filled at least 13 notebooks with drawings, watercolor paintings, and collages depicting fantastical airships. He died at the age of 93, and was buried in the Washington cemetery in Houston in Stelzig Plot A-70. On his grave marker, the last name is misspelled as &quot;Dellschaw,&quot; probably as a result of the &quot;u&quot; being written with an elongated tail on his death certificate. His grave marker also lists his initials on as C. A. instead of C. A. A.

==Posthumous recognition==
After his death, Dellschau&#x27;s home remained in the hands of his descendants. His notebooks of paintings and drawings, as well as his diaries were left virtually untouched for half a century until the late 1960s. Following a fire, the house was cleared and at least 12 of the notebooks were placed on the sidewalk to be discarded. Fred Washington, a local antiques and used furniture dealer, spotted the books, and for $100 bought them from the trash collector. The books sat undisturbed in Washington&#x27;s store under a pile of discarded carpet for over a year. In 1968, Mary Jane Victor, an art student at the University of St. Thomas in Houston stumbled upon the notebooks, and persuaded Washington to lend some of them to the university for a display on the story of flight. She also brought them to the attention of art patron and collector Dominique de Menil. Mrs. de Menil purchased four of the notebooks for $1,500. Of the remaining books, seven were purchased by Peter (Pete) G. Navarro, a Houston commercial artist and UFO researcher. After studying them, Navarro sold four of the notebooks to the Witte Museum in San Antonio, and the San Antonio Museum of Art. One notebook ultimately ended in the private abcd (art brut connaissance &amp; diffusion) collection in Paris belonging to Bruno Decharme, a French filmmaker and art collector. The rest of the notebooks ended up in private hands. Some were dismantled and single pages were sold. In 2016, a double sided page dated 1919, sold for $22,500 at Christie&#x27;s.

Dellschau&#x27;s earliest known work is a diary dated 1899, and the last is an 80-page book dated 1921-1922, giving his career as an artist a 21-year span. His work was in large part a record of the activities of the &quot;Sonora Aero Club,&quot; of which he was a purported member.

Dellschau&#x27;s writings describe the club as a secret group of flight enthusiasts who met in Sonora, California in the mid-19th century. According to Dellschau, one of the club members discovered a formula for an anti-gravity fuel called &quot;NB Gas.&quot; The club mission was to design and build the first navigable aircraft using the NB Gas for lift and propulsion. Dellschau called these flying machines Aeros. Dellschau never claimed to be a pilot or a designer of any of the airships; he identifies himself only as a draftsman for the Sonora Aero Club. His collages incorporate newspaper clippings (called &quot;press blooms&quot;) of then-current news articles about aeronautical advances and disasters.

Though Dellschau&#x27;s work mentioned names of purported Sonora Aero Club members, research of census records, voting rosters, and death records has found nothing to substantiate the existence of this group, though a few gravestones in the Columbia Cemetery share identical surnames. It is speculated that, like the voluminous &quot;Realms of the Unreal&quot; notebooks by outsider artist Henry Darger (1882-1973), the Sonora Aero Club is a fiction by Dellschau.

Dellschau&#x27;s first one-person exhibition &quot;Charles Dellschau - Aeronautical notebooks&quot; and its accompanying catalogue was held in 2000 at the Ricco/Maresca Gallery in New York City, some 75 years after his death.

Witte (which mounted an exhibition of Dellschau and Da Vinci called &quot;Flights of the Imagination&quot;) and the San Antonio Museum (which curated a solo exhibition of Dellschau entitled &quot;Flight or Fancy? The Secret Life of Charles A. A. Dellschau&quot;, also shown at the Menillo Museum in Florida) and the Menil Collection. Dellschau&#x27;s artwork is also in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum, the abcd Art Brut collection in Paris, which owns an entire book, the High Museum in Atlanta, the American Folk Art Museum in New York, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the John Michael Kohler Art Center, and several prominent private collections in America and Europe. Several Dellschau drawings were put on display at the Museum of Everything, London England in 2009 as well as in Turin in 2010. The American Visionary Museum in Baltimore has shown the work of Dellschau on several occasions and the INTUIT Museum in Chicago presented a one-person exhibition of Dellschau&#x27;s art in September 2012.

Charles Dellschau&#x27;s life and art is the subject of a monograph released in the spring of 2013 produced by Marquand Books, Stephen Romano and distributed by Distributed Art Publishers with essays by Thomas McEvilley, Tracy Baker-White, Roger Cardinal, James Brett, Thomas Crouch, Barbara Safarova and Randall Morris. The book has been reviewed in Raw Vision magazine by Tom Patterson, as well as in Bookforum, and Intuit magazine.

==Critical analysis==
Dellschau is regarded as one of America&#x27;s earliest visionary artists. His work has been interpreted as a testimony to the sense of optimism that new technologies inspire as they change the way people see the world. Flight, up until that time, had been a metaphor for man&#x27;s pathos - or his inability to accomplish what he was not meant to. Dellschau&#x27;s work is also remarkable in that it uses the medium of watercolor brilliantly, often using water as the medium with a subtle tint of color.

Dellschau&#x27;s work shows the influence of circus banner painting, in its use of centralized subjects and ornamental borders, and often possesses a jewel-like quality. Reviewing the 1998 Ricco Maresca exhibition, the &quot;New York Times&quot; said:

<text>The following is a list of U.S. cities with large Vietnamese-American populations. They consist of cities with at least 10,000 Vietnamese Americans or where Vietnamese Americans constitute a large percentage of the population. The information contained here was based on the 2010 U.S. census.

Vietnamese-Americans immigrated to the United States in different waves. The first wave of Vietnamese from just before or after the Fall of Saigon/the last day of the Vietnam War, April 30, 1975. They consisted of mostly educated, white collar public servants, senior military officers, and upper and middle class Vietnamese and their families. The second wave came in the 1980s escaping very precariously in boats from the communist regime as boat people. In the 1990s and 2000s, a third wave came from the US&#x27;s Humanitarian Operation Program, family members of Vietnamese Americans, former prisoners of re-education camps, and Amerasian children of American servicemen who applied for entry into the United States. Vietnamese Americans vary in income level, with some being upper-class while others, particular those who came later, are working-class.

Vietnamese Americans are mainly concentrated in metropolitan areas in the West, including Orange County, California, San Jose, California, and Houston, Texas.

<doc id="860406" wikidata="Q2506557" url="?curid=860406" title="Mahanakorn University of Technology">
<text>Mahanakorn University of Technology (, short MUT) is a university in Thailand. The university was established on February 27, 1990 at Nong Chok District, Bangkok. as Mahanakorn College by Prof. Dr. Sitthichai Pookaiyaudom, former Dean of King Mongkut&#x27;s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang. The objective was to train engineering students in response to the severe shortage of engineers. MUT was then promoted to full university status under the new name Mahanakorn University of Technology. It is the first and still the only university in the country that operates its own low-orbit microsatellite (TMSAT).

==Faculties==
There are four faculties,
* Engineering,
* Information Science and Technology,
* Veterinary Medicine and
* Business Administration.

Doctoral and master&#x27;s degree programs are offered in addition to bachelor&#x27;s degree courses.

The main campus of the university is located in Nong chok District, Bangkok. Another campus is located at Vanit2 Building on New Petchaburi Road, Central Bangkok.

==Overseas cooperation==
Cooperation with oversea universities has played an important role in the development of MUT. Partnerships has been established with:
* Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea,
* The University of New South Wales, Australia,
* University of Sydney, Australia,
* Imperial College London, England,
* The University of Surrey, England,
* Coventry University, England,
* University of Veterinary Medicine Hanover, Germany.

MUT and Imperial College (London, England) has jointly established an electronic circuit design laboratory in Imperial College. The centre was opened by Her Royal Highness Princess Royal, daughter of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. It is a research centre for Thai doctoral students and a gateway for Thai industry to access advances in Microelectronics.

==Notable activities==
MUT has designed and constructed a microsatellite. The satellite was built in the University of Surrey by a team of MUT engineers and launched in March 1998. The satellite was named &quot;Thai Paht&quot; by His Majesty King Bhumibol. It is controlled from the ground station on the Nong Chok campus. The station has opened educational centre for communication engineering students and a research centre in satellite engineering. Images downloaded from the satellites are used in the study of regional and environmental features. A program of further satellite construction is underway in cooperation with Chinese and Korean satellite research institutes.

Mahanakorn has established itself as notable research centre nationally and worldwide. MUT staffs have published the largest number of articles among Thai academics in international engineering journals. Several projects have also been recognized for their contribution to society such as mine detector, unmanned aerial vehicle and water filer.

==International and national recognitions==
MUT was ranked 36th by Asia Week Magazine in category of Asian Best Science and Technology Institution within ten years after it was founded.
MUT&#x27;s latest achievement is to accomplish a score of 4.86 out of 5 which is the highest score in the category of Research University in an assessment by the office for National Education Standards and Quality Assessment (ONESQA), a public organization set up to assess the performance of all educational institutions from schools to universities, in two categories: research and learning qualities and the quality of graduates.

<text>A pet cemetery is a cemetery for pets. Although the veneration and burial of beloved pets has been practiced since ancient times, burial grounds reserved specifically for animals were not common until the late 19th century.

==History==

Many human cultures buried animal remains. For example, the Ancient Egyptians mummified and buried cats, which they considered deities; one of the oldest known pet cemeteries, the Berenice pet cemetery, mainly used for cat burials, was found during the excavation of the Berenice Troglodytica seaport in 2011 and was used between the 1st and 2nd century CE. Archaeologists have found that dogs were buried alongside humans in Siberia as many as 8,000 years ago. The Ashkelon dog cemetery, the largest known dog cemetery in the ancient world, was discovered at the Ashkelon National Park in Ashkelon, Israel.

The &quot;Hiran Minar&quot; near Lahore, Pakistan is a minaret that was built in approximately 1606 CE by the Mughal Emperor Jahangir in honor of his beloved pet antelope Mansraj.

London&#x27;s Hyde Park was the site of an informal pet cemetery between 1881 and 1903, in the gatekeeper&#x27;s garden. From the first burial of &quot;Cherry&quot; until its official closure in 1903, it received 300 burials with miniature headstones, with a final special burial of the Royal Marines mascot dog &quot;Prince&quot; in 1967.
Cimetière des Chiens in Asnières-sur-Seine in Paris, dating from 1899, is an elaborate, sculpted pet cemetery believed to be one of the first public zoological necropolis in the world.

America&#x27;s largest and oldest pet cemetery is the Hartsdale Pet Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York. It dates from 1896, when a veterinarian working out of Manhattan offered to let a grieving pet owner bury her dog at his hillside apple orchard. Today, it is the final resting place to around 80,000 animals including famous ones like Mariah Carey&#x27;s cat Clarence and Ming the tiger. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. Some other famous American pet cemeteries include Aspin Hill Memorial Park in Silver Spring, Maryland, believed to be the second-oldest in America, as well as the Pet Memorial Cemetery in Calabasas, California, where Hopalong Cassidy&#x27;s horse, Topper, Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Jack Russell Terrier, and Rudolph Valentino&#x27;s dog, Kabar, are buried.

==Burial with humans==
At some cemeteries, such as Aspin Hill Memorial Park, human and animal remains may be interred alongside each other. In January 2010, West Lindsey District Council gave permission for a site in the village of Stainton by Langworth to inter animal remains alongside human remains as part of a &quot;green burial&quot; site, making it the first place in England where pets could be buried alongside their owners.
In 2011, New York State formally adopted guidelines to allow human burials in pet cemeteries as long as the cemetery doesn&#x27;t advertise it or charge a burial fee.

<doc id="860421" wikidata="Q725362" url="?curid=860421" title="Louis Nelson Delisle">
<text>&quot;Big Eye&quot; Louis Nelson Delisle (January 28, 1885 – August 20, 1949) was an American Dixieland jazz clarinetist in New Orleans, Louisiana. He also played double bass, banjo, and accordion.

==Early life and education==
Nelson Delisle was born into a Creole of color family and spent most of his life in New Orleans. He studied clarinet with the elder Lorenzo Tio.

==Career==
By the age of 15, Delisle worked professionally in the music venues of Storyville, an area of brothels and clubs in New Orleans. He developed a style of hot jazz, a.k.a. Dixieland, and was an influence on clarinetists Johnny Dodds and Jimmie Noone.

Early in his career Delisle often played a C clarinet, as opposed to the more common B♭; the C was used by other New Orleans clarinetists of the era, such as Alcide Nunez.

In 1917, Delisle joined the reconstituted Original Creole Orchestra that included Freddie Keppard and Bill Johnson. The band had disbanded in Boston in the spring of that year but was reassembled in New York City in the fall of the same year. Delisle replaced George Baquet, who had toured with the group in vaudeville. After a short while, Delisle was replaced by Jimmie Noone. He was the regular clarinetist with the Jones &amp; Collins Astoria Hot Eight but did not play on their 1929 recording sessions.

He made his only recordings in his later years in the 1940s, by which time he was often in poor health.

<text>Andrew Philip Mehrtens (born 28 April 1973) is a New Zealand former rugby union player. He was regarded as a top first five-eighth, having played first for Canterbury in 1993, before being selected for the All Blacks (New Zealand&#x27;s national team) in 1995 when he played in the 1995 World Cup.

After his move to England, and later to France, he helped his first three clubs to promotion into their country&#x27;s top flight. He first joined Harlequins in England, where in his first season he played a major factor in leading the freshly relegated club to an immediate return to the top-level Guinness Premiership. After seeing Harlequins successfully through their first season back in the Premiership, he went to the ambitious Pro D2 club Toulon for the 2007–08 season. After Toulon won the title to secure an immediate return to the Top 14, he remained in Pro D2, moving to another ambitious side, Racing Métro. For the second straight season, his team won the Pro D2 crown and a spot in the Top 14.

==Youth==
Mehrtens was born in Durban, South Africa, as his parents lived in South Africa for four years from 1970 and returned to New Zealand when he was still a young child. Mehrtens grew up in Christchurch, attended Christchurch Boys&#x27; High School where he played in the 1st XV, and played Junior Grade Rugby for Kaiapoi. He recalled, when he was aged 10, his Kaiapoi team playing a match at Lancaster Park as a curtain raiser to the Ranfurly Shield match between Canterbury and Mid Canterbury. He also represented New Zealand at under-19 and under-21 levels.

Like many players in New Zealand, Mehrtens comes from a family with a long involvement in rugby. His grandfather, George Mehrtens, played for Canterbury in the 1920s as a fullback and was an All Black in unofficial internationals against New South Wales in 1928. His father, Terry, also a first five, represented Canterbury between 1964 and 1976. He was a New Zealand under-23 player in 1965 against the Springboks and again in 1967, and while in South Africa played as a fullback for against the 1970 All Blacks.

==Career==
New Zealand rugby has had few players who have won such wide popularity and affection as Andrew Mehrtens, who in a 12-year career at first class level became a national figure rather than simply an icon of his Canterbury province. However, there was never total agreement on his ranking in the pecking order of All Black first five-eighths. Some headed by Colin Meads believed that Mehrtens was the best in his position ever produced by New Zealand. Others believed that despite his immense skills, vision, kicking and ability to throw long cut out passes to his outsides he had limitations, especially in the way rugby developed in the professional era. He was seen as lacking the physique or inclination to mix it physically, either taking the ball up or committing himself to the tackle.

Outside the playing field, Mehrtens proved to be a favourite with fans and a large section of the media because of his pleasant manner, his intelligence, and his wit and sense of humour.

Despite his family background Mehrtens only emerged as a rare prospect in his late teens, perhaps because he was a slower developer physically. In his teens Mehrtens showed almost as much promise in tennis, where in various age groups he was nationally ranked.

His first significant rugby selection was in 1992 when he played in the national under 19s against Australia in a side which also included later Crusaders or All Blacks teammates Adrian Cashmore, Norman Berryman, Milton Going, Tabai Matson, Justin Marshall and Taine Randell.

He was first chosen for Canterbury in 1993–94 and in each of those seasons he was in the New Zealand Colts, making his first major impact nationally in the Canterbury side which in 1994 took the Ranfurly Shield from Waikato. His performance that day and in Shield defences later that season against Counties and Otago marked him as a clear All Black prospect.

Though left out of the initial training squads, Mehrtens developed so much that he forced his way into the 1995 World Cup squad, having made his All Black debut in the early season test against Canada when he scored 28 points.

In the World Cup tournament he was a success, one of three youngsters with Jonah Lomu and Josh Kronfeld who gave the All Blacks a dimension which had been lacking for much of the 1994 season. The only quibble about Mehrtens at the World Cup was missing a dropped goal attempt in the extra time of the final.

Over the next six or seven seasons Mehrtens was a virtual automatic selection for the All Black squad, though he was not always assured of a starting position. A knee injury curtailed his 1995 tour of France and in the next few seasons injury and competition from the likes of Carlos Spencer and Tony Brown saw him miss a number of tests.

But he reasserted himself during the 1999 season, both in kicking a record nine penalties in a trans-Tasman test against Australia at Eden Park and then at the World Cup. However, an injury in the quarter-final against Scotland clearly affected him in the latter rounds.

Besides his importance to the All Blacks, Mehrtens from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s fashioned an outstanding record for the Crusaders at Super 12 level. He had key roles in their three title wins in 1998–2000, either through his tactical command of games or, as in the 2000 final against the Brumbies, with a penalty goal under severe pressure. He also played in the Crusaders sides which won the Super 12 titles of 2002 and 2005, even though in the final season he was now playing second fiddle to his protege Dan Carter.

Mehrtens was also a huge contributor to Canterbury at National Provincial Championship (NPC) levels, with his inside back partnership with half-back Justin Marshall becoming celebrated. As well as 1994 against Waikato he played in Shield winning sides in 2000 (against Waikato again) and in 2004 against Bay of Plenty. He played in three NPC winning sides in 1997, 2001 and 2004.

Over the latter stages, especially in 2003, Mehrtens was beset by personal problems which in turn affected his fitness and form. He battled to make the Crusaders then and in 2004 and was left out of the All Blacks for the 2003 season, though many believed he should have been recalled for the World Cup.

He eventually did win his All Black place back for a brief period in 2004, but by then it had become clear that the immediate future belonged to Carter. At the end of the 2005 Super 12, Mehrtens left New Zealand rugby to play for the Harlequins in Britain.

He left behind a formidable record: 281 first class games for 3,178 points, 108 games for Canterbury for 1,056 points, 87 for the Crusaders and 981 points, 72 games for the All Blacks and 967 points in 70 tests. His test aggregate, a record for a New Zealander until Carter surpassed it in November 2009, would have been greater, and well into four figures, had he not missed many of the &quot;softer&quot; tests played during his time in the All Blacks. His understudies – Simon Culhane, Spencer and Brown – all scored heavily in his absence from these matches.

===International===
Mehrtens debuted for the All Blacks in 1995 and made an immediate impact, scoring 28 points against Canada in his Test debut; at that time, that was the highest point total ever by a player making his international debut. He also featured in the team that played in the 1995 Rugby World Cup final against South Africa and came within inches of claiming victory for New Zealand, with a drop goal attempt veering just wide of the posts at the end of regulation time.

Mehrtens is currently the second all-time points scorer for the All Blacks, with 967 points (7t, 169c, 188p, 10dg), having been overtaken by Dan Carter on 21 November 2009. He has scored 20 or more points in 13 separate Tests, has scored nine penalties in two separate Tests, and is currently the only player to have scored over 300 points in the Tri Nations Series. His 209 points against South Africa is the most ever by one player against one country; he also occupies third place on that list, with 202 against Australia. (Carter is currently second with 207 points against Australia.) Mehrtens is also atop the all-time list for Test conversions, with 167. A supposed drop in form, combined with injuries, saw him miss out on the All Blacks World Cup squad in 2003. Critics of coach John Mitchell felt New Zealand&#x27;s chances were dealt a blow without the choice of an experienced goal-kicker, an area in which New Zealand could not compete in the semi-final against Australia. Nonetheless, a strong 2004 Super 12 campaign saw him called back to the All Blacks. He was also not included in the 2005 All Black squad to face the British and Irish Lions.

===Domestic===
In Super 12, Mehrtens was a key member of the dominant Crusaders side that won the competition four times in five years (1998, 1999, 2000, 2002), and in 2005, another successful year for the Crusaders, he also played well, making regular appearances off the bench and starting in a few games. During 2005 he became the competition&#x27;s leading all-time scorer, a crown he held until 9 May 2009, when the Brumbies&#x27; Stirling Mortlock passed his record of 990 points. He was also on three NPC-winning Canterbury sides, in 1997, 2001 and 2004.

Mehrtens is credited with reestablishing the Canterbury region as a force in New Zealand rugby again after nine years in the wilderness when in 1994 he generaled a young team who won the Ranfurly Shield off Waikato. Since that time Canterbury and under his stewardship won numerous NPC championships listed above together with rewinning the Ranfurly Shield in 2000. He won his way into the team having displaced Greg Coffey in the Canterbury A team.

===Post All Blacks===
Mehrtens played his final match for Harlequins on the final day of the 2006–07 season which fell on his birthday, scoring 24 points in a victory over the Sale Sharks, after which supporters and teammates celebrated his birthday and bid farewell to him after the game ended.

On 23 May 2007, Mehrtens joined French Pro D2 team Toulon, who went on to win the league title that season and gain promotion to the Top 14.

For the 2008–2009 season, Mehrtens signed to play with French Pro D2 team Racing Métro 92.

After two years in Paris, which included the 2009 Pro D2 championship and a Top 14 playoff appearance in 2010 (which also secured Racing a place in the 2010–11 Heineken Cup), his contract was not renewed. He moved to the Fédérale 1 (third-division) side Béziers, signing a three-year deal with the club. Under his contract, Mehrtens has the option to move into the club&#x27;s coaching staff once he decides to end his playing career.

In 2014 he joined the Waratahs as a kicking coach.

Mehrtens now lives in Sydney, and works as a commentator on Stan Sport, alongside Justin Harrison, and Morgan Turinui.

==Honours==
In the 2006 New Year Honours, Mehrtens was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to rugby.

<text>Timbuktu! is a musical, with lyrics by George Forrest and Robert Wright, set to music by Borodin, Forrest and Wright. The book is by Luther Davis. It is a resetting of Forrest and Wright&#x27;s musical &quot;Kismet&quot;. The musical is set in 1361 in Timbuktu, in the Empire of Mali, West Africa.

==Production history==
The musical premiered on Broadway at the Mark Hellinger Theatre on March 1, 1978, and closed on September 10, 1978, after 221 performances and 22 previews.

The original production starred Eartha Kitt as Shaleem-La-Lume, William Marshall as Hadji, Gilbert Price as the Mansa of Mali, Melba Moore as Marsinah, and George Bell as the Wazir. Ira Hawkins replaced Marshall prior to the Broadway opening. It was directed, choreographed and costume designed by Geoffrey Holder, with sets designed by Tony Straiges. Alan Eichler was associate producer. Gerald Bordman noted that the sets and costumes had &quot;a Ziegfeldian opulence.&quot; New songs based on African folk music were added to provide &quot;some tonal verisimiltude.&quot;

Following its Broadway run, it toured for more than a year with Kitt continuing in her starring role as Shaleem-La-Lume, Gregg Baker as Hadji, Bruce Hubbard as the Mansa and Vanessa Shaw as Marsinah.

<doc id="860440" wikidata="Q12867502" url="?curid=860440" title="Subshrub">
<text>A subshrub (Latin &quot;suffrutex&quot;) or undershrub is either a small shrub (e.g. prostrate shrubs) or a perennial that is largely herbaceous but slightly woody at the base (e.g. garden pink and florist&#x27;s chrysanthemum). The term is often interchangeable with &quot;bush&quot;.

Because the criteria are matters of degree (normally of height) rather than of kind, the definition of a subshrub is not sharply distinguishable from that of a shrub; examples of reasons for describing plants as subshrubs include ground-hugging stems or low growth habit. Subshrubs may be largely herbaceous though still classified as woody, with overwintering perennial woody growth much lower-growing than deciduous summer growth. Some plants described as subshrubs are only weakly woody and some persist for only a few years. Others, such as &quot;Oldenburgia paradoxa&quot; live indefinitely (though is still vulnerable to external effects), rooted in rocky cracks.

Small, low shrubs such as lavender, periwinkle, and thyme, and many shrub-like members of the family Ericaceae, such as cranberries and small species of &quot;Erica&quot;, are often classed as subshrubs.

==Definition==
A chamaephyte, subshrub or dwarf-shrub is a plant that bears hibernating buds on persistent shoots near the ground – usually woody plants with perennating buds borne close to the ground, usually less than above the soil surface. The significance of the closeness to the ground is that the buds remain within the soil surface layer and are thus somewhat protected from various adverse external influences. Accordingly, the chamaephyte habit is especially common in stressful environments, for example: 
* ecosystems on nutrient-poor soils or rock
* exposed alpine or arctic ecosystems where seasonal or perennial wind and freezing conditions are prone to kill vulnerable growing shoots
* ecosystems subject to frequent fires and burning, where many species of e.g. &quot;Banksia&quot; or &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; regrow from a lignotuber or caudex. 
* heavily grazed or overgrazed ecosystems, such as tortoise turf

==Examples of chamaephytes==
The term chamaephyte is most formally used within the context of Raunkiær plant life-forms&#x27; classification. Examples of chamaephytes are many of the species living in the maquis shrubland and other plants of submediterranean dry ecosystems (species such as thyme, &quot;Thymus vulgaris&quot;, and rosemary, &quot;Salvia rosmarinus&quot;); others include heather species (e.g. &quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot; and &quot;Ericas&quot;), African wild olive (&quot;Olea europaea&quot; ssp. &quot;cuspidata&quot;) and edelweiss (&quot;Leontopodium alpinum&quot;). Chamaephytes also include cushion plants.

<doc id="860445" wikidata="Q11298050" url="?curid=860445" title="Key System">
<text>The Key System (or Key Route) was a privately owned company that provided mass transit in the cities of Oakland, Berkeley, Alameda, Emeryville, Piedmont, San Leandro, Richmond, Albany, and El Cerrito in the eastern San Francisco Bay Area from 1903 until 1960, when it was sold to a newly formed public agency, AC Transit. The Key System consisted of local streetcar and bus lines in the East Bay, and commuter rail and bus lines connecting the East Bay to San Francisco by a ferry pier on San Francisco Bay, later via the lower deck of the Bay Bridge. At its height during the 1940s, the Key System had over of track. The local streetcars were discontinued in 1948 and the commuter trains to San Francisco were discontinued in 1958. The Key System&#x27;s territory is today served by BART and AC Transit bus service.

== History ==
=== Early years ===

The system began as a consolidation of several streetcar lines assembled in the late 1890s and early 1900s by Francis Marion &quot;Borax&quot; Smith and his business interests. After having made a fortune in Borax and gained his nickname, &quot;Borax&quot;, the entrepreneur turned to real estate and electric traction for streetcars. The Key System was founded as the San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose Railway (SFOSJR), incorporated in 1902. After consolidating local lines under one company, Smith sought to compete with the Southern Pacific commuter ferry market as well as develop new streetcar suburbs in the East Bay. The troubled California &amp; Nevada Railroad had begun construction of a ferry pier in Oakland, but its plans were never realized. Smith purchased the railroad in order to gain access to its right of way and waterfront operations, as well as use the abandoned pier as a starting point for his own passenger mole.

Transbay service began on October 26, 1903, with a four-car train carrying 250 passengers, departing downtown Berkeley for the ferry to San Francisco. Before the end of 1903, Frank C. Havens, the general manager of the SFOSJR, devised the idea of using a stylized map on which the system&#x27;s routes resembled an old-fashioned key, with three &quot;handle loops&quot; that covered the cities of Berkeley, Piedmont (initially, &quot;Claremont&quot; shared the Piedmont loop) and Oakland, and a &quot;shaft&quot; in the form of the Key pier, the &quot;teeth&quot; representing the ferry berths at the end of the pier. The company touted its &#x27;key route&#x27;, which led to the adoption of the name &quot;Key System&quot;.

In 1908, the SFOSJR changed its name to the San Francisco, Oakland &amp; San Jose Consolidated Railway; it changed to the San Francisco-Oakland Terminal Railway in 1912. Smith was ousted from the company in 1913. After it went bankrupt in December 1923, it was re-organized as the Key System Transit Co., adopting a marketing concept as the name of the company.
Following the Great Crash of 1929, a holding company called the Railway Equipment &amp; Realty Co. was created, with the subsidiary Key System Ltd running the commuter trains. In 1938, the name became the Key System.

During World War II, the Key System built and operated the Shipyard Railway between a transfer station in Emeryville and the Kaiser Shipyards in Richmond.

=== National City Lines era ===

National City Lines acquired 64% of the stock in the system in 1946.

The same year E. Jay Quinby hand published a document exposing the ownership of National City Lines (General Motors, Firestone Tire, and Phillips Petroleum). He addressed the publication to &quot;The Mayors; The City Manager; The City Transit Engineer; The members of The Committee on Mass-Transportation and The Tax-Payers and The Riding Citizens of Your Community&quot;. In it he wrote &quot;This is an urgent warning to each and every one of you that there is a careful, deliberately planned campaign to swindle you out of your most important and valuable public utilities–your Electric Railway System&quot;.

The new owners made a number of rapid changes. In 1946 they cut back the A-1 train route and then the express trains in 1947. The company increased fares in 1946 and then in both January and November 1947. During the period there were many complaints of overcrowding.

On April9, 1947, nine corporations and seven individuals (constituting officers and directors of certain of the corporate defendants) were indicted in the Federal District Court of Southern California on two counts: &#x27;conspiring to acquire control of a number of transit companies, forming a transportation monopoly&#x27; and &#x27;Conspiring to monopolize sales of buses and supplies to companies owned by National City Lines&#x27;. They were convicted of conspiring to monopolize sales of buses and supplies. They were acquitted of conspiring to monopolize the ownership of these companies.

In 1948 National City Lines proposed a plan to convert all the streetcars to buses. They placed an advertisement in the local papers explaining their plan to &#x27;modernize&#x27; and &#x27;motorize&#x27; Line 14. The Oakland City Council opposed the plan by 5–3. The Public Utilities Commission (PUC) supported the plan which included large fare increases. In October 1948, 700 people signed a petition with the PUC &quot;against the Key System, seeking restoration of the bus service on the #70 Chabot Bus line&quot;. The city councils of Oakland, Berkeley and San Leandro opposed the removal of street cars. The traffic planners supported removal of the streetcar lines to facilitate movement of automobiles. Local governments in the East Bay attempted to purchase the Key System, but were unsuccessful.

Streetcars were converted to buses during November/December 1948.

In 1949 National City Lines, General Motors and others were convicted of conspiring to monopolize the sale of buses and related products to their subsidiary transit companies throughout the U.S.

Between 1946 and 1954 transbay fares increased from 20¢ to 50¢ ($ to $ adjusted for inflation). Fares in this period were used to operate and for &#x27;motorisation&#x27; which included streetcar track removal, repaving, purchase of new buses and the construction of bus maintenance facilities. Transbay ridership fell from 22.2million in 1946 to 9.8million in 1952.

The Key System&#x27;s famed commuter train system was dismantled in 1958 after many years of declining ridership as well by the corrupt monopolistic efforts of National City Lines. The last run was on April20, 1958. In 1960, the newly formed publicly owned AC Transit took over the Key System&#x27;s facilities.

Most of the rolling stock was scrapped, with some sold to Buenos Aires, Argentina. Several streetcars, interurbans and bridge units were salvaged for collections in the United States. Of the large bridge units, three are at the Western Railway Museum near Rio Vista, California while another is at the Orange Empire Railway Museum in southern California.

== System details ==

The initial connection across the Bay to San Francisco was by ferryboat via a causeway and pier (&quot;mole&quot;), extending from the end of Yerba Buena Avenue in Oakland, California, westward 16,000 feet (4,900 m) to a ferry terminal near Yerba Buena Island. Filling for the causeway had been started by a short-lived narrow-gauge railroad company in the late 19th century, the California and Nevada Railroad. &quot;Borax&quot; Smith acquired the causeway from the California and Nevada upon its bankruptcy.

On December 4, 1924, six people were killed in a train collision on the mole. On May 6, 1933, a major fire erupted on the pier end of the mole, consuming the ferry terminal building as well as gutting the ferryboat &quot;Peralta&quot;. The pier was subsequently reconstructed further south and a new terminal building erected.

The Key System operated a fleet of ferries between the Key Route Pier and the San Francisco Ferry Building until January 15, 1939, when a new dual track opened on the south side of the lower deck of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, bringing Key System trains to the then-new Transbay Terminal in San Francisco&#x27;s downtown. The bridge railway and Transbay Terminal were shared with the Southern Pacific&#x27;s Interurban Electric and the Western Pacific&#x27;s Sacramento Northern railroads.

The Key System&#x27;s first trains were composed of standard wooden railroad passenger cars, complete with clerestory roofs. Atop each of these, a pair of pantographs, invented and manufactured by the Key System&#x27;s own shops, were installed to collect current from overhead wires to power a pair of electric motors on each car, one on each truck (bogie).

The design of rolling stock changed over the years. Wood gave way to steel, and, instead of doors at each end, center doors were adopted.

The later rolling stock consisted of specially designed &quot;bridge units&quot; for use on the new bridge, articulated cars sharing a common central truck and including central passenger entries in each car, a forerunner of the design of most light rail vehicles today. Several of these pairs were connected to make up a train. Power pickup was via pantograph from overhead catenary wires, except on the Bay Bridge where a third rail pickup was used. The Key&#x27;s trains ran on 600 volt direct current, compared to the 1200 volts used by the SP commuter trains. The cars had an enclosed operator&#x27;s cab in the right front, with passenger seats extending to the very front of the vehicle, a favorite seat for many children, with dramatic views of the tracks ahead.

The exterior color of the cars was orange and silver. Interior upholstery was woven reed seat covers in one of the articulated sections, and leather in the other, the smoking section. The flooring was linoleum. During WWII, the roofs were painted gray for aerial camouflage. After acquisition by National City Lines, all Key vehicles including the bridge units were re-painted in that company&#x27;s standard colors, yellow and green.

=== Transbay rail lines ===
Until the Bay Bridge railway began operation, Key commuter trains had no letter designation. They were generally referred to by the principal street or district they served, though the Key System did not have any formal naming scheme outside of letter designations.

D was reserved for a proposed line into Montclair alongside the Sacramento Northern interurban railway. Shortly after opening of the Bay Bridge to train traffic, the Key System continued to use its pier for special service trains for ferry service to the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition on Treasure Island— these were given the special designation &quot;X&quot;. The service was discontinued at the end of the first year of the Exposition and not revived for the 1940 season.

On September 13, 1942, a stop was opened at Yerba Buena Island to serve expanded wartime needs on adjacent Treasure Island. It remained after the war until the end of all rail service on the Key System.

The A, B, C, E and F lines were the last Key System rail lines. Train service ended on April 20, 1958, replaced by buses using the same letter designations. AC Transit preserved the letter-designated routes when it took over the Key System two years later, and are still in use; AC Transit&#x27;s B, C, E, F, G and H lines follow roughly the corresponding Key routes and neighborhoods.

=== East Bay Street Railways ===

The Key System&#x27;s streetcars operated as a separate division under the name &quot;&quot;, later changed to &quot;East Bay Street Railways. Ltd&quot;, and finally to &quot;East Bay Transit Co.&quot;, reflecting the increasing use of buses. Initially a separate company, it was formed by the merger of six local street railroads.

The numbering of the streetcar lines changed several times over the years. The Key System&#x27;s streetcars operated out of several carbarns. The Central Carhouse was on the east side of Lake Merritt on Third Avenue. The Western Carhouse was located at 51st and Telegraph Avenue in the Temescal District of Oakland. The Elmhurst Carhouse was in the east Oakland district of Elmhurst, on East 14th (International Blvd.) between 94th and 96th Avenues. The Northern Carhouse was in Richmond where today&#x27;s AC Transit has a bus yard. In the early years of operation, these were supplemented by a number of smaller carbarns scattered throughout the East Bay area, many of them inherited from the pre-Key companies acquired by &quot;Borax&quot; Smith. The Key streetcars were originally painted dark green and cream white, then orange. They were re-painted in the green and yellow scheme of National City Lines after NCL acquired the Key System.

The Key System had ordered 40 trolley coaches from ACF-Brill in 1945 to convert the East Bay trolley lines. The new NCL management canceled the Key&#x27;s trackless program in 1946 before wire changes were made, and diverted the order (some units of which had already been painted for the Key and delivered to Oakland) to its own Los Angeles Transit Lines, where they ran until 1963. The last Key streetcars ran on November 28, 1948, replaced by buses.

=== Related rail systems ===
*The Key System organized its freight business in 1929 as the Key Terminal Railway, Ltd. In 1938, the name was changed to the Oakland Terminal Rail&quot;road&quot;, Ltd. In 1943 the Oakland Terminal Railroad was jointly purchased by the Western Pacific Railroad and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and is now known as the Oakland Terminal Railway.
*The East Shore and Suburban Railway (E&amp;SR) was a formerly independent unit of the Key System which ran streetcar trains in Richmond, San Pablo, and El Cerrito. Service to Oakland required a transfer to Oakland Traction Company trains at the County Line station and service to San Francisco required an additional transfer.
*See also the East Bay Electric Lines; another transbay commuter rail system operated by the Southern Pacific in the East Bay until 1941.
*See also the Sacramento Northern Railroad, an interurban system running from Chico through Sacramento to Oakland which also used some of the Key System&#x27;s trackage as well as the Key System&#x27;s ferry pier, and later ran to the Transbay Terminal until 1941.

=== Other properties ===
From the beginning, the Key System had been conceived as a dual real estate and transportation system. &quot;Borax&quot; Smith and his partner Frank C. Havens first established a company called the &quot;Realty Syndicate&quot; which acquired large tracts of undeveloped land throughout the East Bay. The Realty Syndicate also built two large hotels, each served by a San Francisco-bound train, the Claremont and the Key Route Inn, and a popular amusement park in Oakland called Idora Park. Streetcar lines were also routed to serve all these properties, thereby enhancing their value. In its early years, the Key System was actually a subsidiary of the Realty Syndicate. Berkeley&#x27;s numerous paths, lanes, walks and steps, were put in place in many of the newly developed neighborhoods, often in the middle of a city block, so that commuters could walk more directly to the new train system. Berkeley&#x27;s pathways are still maintained by local groups.

== Legacy ==

Signs of the system still remain:

*The south wall of the lower level (today&#x27;s eastbound lanes) of the Yerba Buena Tunnel, connecting the two spans of the Bay Bridge, still contains the as-built &quot;deadman holes&quot;, regularly spaced refuge bays into which railway workers could duck whenever a train came along.
*The eastern end of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge sits on landfill which was added to the northern edge of the causeway which carried the Key System railbed to the ferry piers.
*The tunnel that Key System trains used to cross under the Southern Pacific (now Union Pacific and Amtrak) tracks to the mole and later the Bay Bridge still exists. It is visible from the Alexander Zuckerman Bike Path, the ramps of the Macarthur Maze, and at the southwest end of the Target store property in Emeryville, a locale that was once part of the Key System yards and shops.
*A stretch of road in Albany that was built with a wide median for a planned extension (never constructed) of the &quot;G&quot; Westbrae line is named &quot;Key Route Boulevard&quot;.
*The Claremont Hotel, built by a Key System affiliate company, The Realty Syndicate, survives as the Claremont Resort. It was the terminus of the &quot;E&quot; transbay line.
*The Realty Syndicate Building at 1440 Broadway was built in 1912 and housed &quot;Borax&quot; Smith and Frank C. Havens&#x27;s Realty Syndicate that created the Key System. It is listed on the National Historic Register.
*The Key System&#x27;s subsequent administrative headquarters building, built as the Security Bank and Trust Company Building in 1914, exists at 1100 Broadway in downtown Oakland and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The building suffered some damage in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and is as of June 2020 unoccupied, although there are plans for the building to be rehabilitated by a developer constructing a larger new building adjacent to it.
*A building which has been converted for restaurant use at 41st Street and Piedmont Avenue in Oakland is the partial remnant of what was formerly a covered stop for trains on the C-line. (The tracks followed 40th Street, crossed Howe Street and curved through the parking lot behind Piedmont Avenue shops, then merged onto Piedmont Avenue at 41st Street and headed toward Pleasant Valley Avenue.) Old photos of the Key System are on the walls of the restaurant, as well as a partial mural (painted in 2005 and partially removed in 2014) of Key System images on one of its outside walls.
*The old Key System Piedmont shops building at Bay Place and Harrison is now a Whole Foods Market retail store. This building was originally built in 1890 as the powerhouse and car barn of the Piedmont Cable Car Co. In the 1920s, it was substantially remodeled and used as a Cadillac showroom which closed in the mid-1990s. The building sat vacant until 2003, when Whole Foods initiated a radical interior redesign while retaining and restoring much of the facade.
*The bus yards of today&#x27;s AC Transit in Emeryville and Richmond were originally the bus yards of the Key System. The Richmond yard was also previously the site of the Northern Carhouse of the Key streetcar system.
*Several streetcars and bridge trains from the Key System are preserved at the Western Railway Museum at Rio Vista Junction in Solano County, as well as a Bridge Unit at the Southern California Railway Museum in Perris, California and a streetcar at Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunk, Maine.
*One of the 0-4-0 Steam locomotives used to push the trains during power outages is on display at the Redwood Valley Railway. It had a brief stint on the currently re-constructing Virginia and Truckee Railroad in Virginia City, Nevada. Here, the mountain grades proved too taxing for the little locomotive. It was later replaced by 2–8–0 Steam locomotive No. 29.
*Although built by the Southern Pacific Railroad, the Key System inherited the Northbrae Tunnel right-of-way, which it operated from 1942 through 1958. It was converted to street use and opened to auto traffic on December 15, 1962.
*Located at the former Oakland Army Base site, The Interurban Electric Railway Bridge Yard Shop Building, was used as a maintenance facility for the Key System electric trains. Today, the building is now known as the Bridge Yard Building and is used as a venue for events as part of the Judge John Sutter Regional Shoreline. A substation located at the site also provided electrical power to all the Key System trains.
*A footpath between York Drive and Ricardo Avenue, which provided access to the Holly Place stop on the C line, is still in use.
*Abandoned tracks on Louise Street and Poplar Street in Oakland, used by the A and B lines, were rebuilt in 1958 and used for freight until 1999.

<text>Phlegra () is both a real and a mythical location in both Greek and Roman mythology.

Phlegra is a peninsula of Macedonia (more specifically in Chalkidike) in modern Greece; it is an ancient name for Pallene in historical Thrace, the latter as per the toponymy of the ancients; Pallene – and Phlegra – is most commonly called nowadays Kassandra, or Peninsula of Kassandra. In Greek mythology, it is the site of Zeus&#x27;s overthrowing of the Giants (Gigantes) at the end of the Gigantomachy.

The Greek geographer Strabo (c.63 BC – c. 24 AD) writes:
Nevertheless, various places have been associated with the Gigantomachy. 
The presence of volcanic phenomena, and the frequent unearthing of the fossilized bones of large prehistoric animals throughout these locations may explain why such sites became associated with the Giants. Pindar writes that the battle occurred at Phlegra (&quot;the place of burning&quot;), as do other early sources. Phlegra was said to be an ancient name for Pallene, and Phlegra/Pallene was the usual birthplace of the Giants and site of the battle. Apollodorus, who placed the battle at Pallene, says the Giants were born &quot;as some say, in Phlegrae, but according to others in Pallene&quot;. But the name Phlegra and the Gigantomachy were also often associated, by later writers, with the Phlegraean Plain, the volcanic fields, at the east of Cumae. Diodorus Siculus presents a war with multiple battles, with one at Pallene, one on the Phlegraean Fields, and one on Crete. Even when, as in Apollodorus, the battle starts at one place, individual battles between Giant and god might range farther afield, with Enceladus buried beneath Sicily, and Polybotes under the island of Nisyros (or Kos).

Strabo also refers to the Phlegraean Plain (, &#x27;, or ,&#x27;, later &quot;&quot; ), in Campania, &quot;which mythology has made the setting of the story of the Giants&quot;:

According to the Greek geographer, the Giants who survived, were driven out by Heracles, finding refuge with their mother in Leuca (Apulia), in Italy&#x27;s &#x27;heel&#x27;. A fountain there had smelly water the locals claimed to be from the ichor of the giants. Strabo also mentions an account of Heracles battling Giants at Phanagoria, a Greek colony on the shores of the Black Sea.

<doc id="860476" wikidata="Q7676135" url="?curid=860476" title="Tailspin Tommy">
<text>Tailspin Tommy was an aviation-adventure comic strip about a youthful pilot, &quot;Tailspin&quot; Tommy Tomkins (sometimes spelled Tompkins). Originally illustrated by Hal Forrest and initially distributed by John Neville Wheeler&#x27;s Bell Syndicate and then by United Feature Syndicate, the strip had a 14-year run from May 21, 1928 to March 15, 1942.

In the wake of Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s 1927 flight across the Atlantic, the public&#x27;s fascination with aviation escalated. &quot;Tailspin Tommy&quot; was the first aviation-based comic strip to appear as a result of this heightened interest. The strip&#x27;s 1928 launch was followed by others, notably &quot;Skyroads&quot; (1929-1942), &quot;Scorchy Smith&quot; (1930-1961), &quot;The Adventures of Smilin&#x27; Jack&quot; (1933-1973) and &quot;Flyin&#x27; Jenny&quot; (1939-1946).

== Publication history ==
Scripted by Glenn Chaffin, a newspaper journalist and press agent, &quot;Tailspin Tommy&quot; began its run in four newspapers on May 21, 1928. By 1931, it was published in more than 250 newspapers across the country. After buying out Chaffin&#x27;s interest, Forrest took over the scripting; his first credited Sunday strip ran on January 7, 1934, and his first Sunday appeared on January 22. Forrest wrote and drew the strip solo for the next three years. 

In 1936, Forrest took on an assistant, Reynold Brown, who inked (uncredited) over Forrest&#x27;s pencils. &quot;Tailspin Tommy&quot; is held by some to have improved with Brown&#x27;s contribution.

The Sunday page had several topper strips over the course of the run: &quot;Progress of Flight&quot; (1930-1933), &quot;Four Aces&quot; (1934-1941), &quot;How to Fly&quot; (1935), &quot;War Plane Insignia&quot; (1935) and &quot;Tailspin Tommy Flying Club&quot; (1935-1941).

==Characters and story==
Living in Littleville, Colorado, young Tommy Tomkins had such an obsession with flying that he was given the nickname Tailspin Tommy before he ever actually went inside a plane. Although Tommy took an aero-engineering correspondence course, his real introduction to aviation happened when mail pilot Milt Howe made an emergency landing in a field near Tommy&#x27;s neighborhood. Tommy watched the downward spiral of Milt&#x27;s plane and ran to help. Howe rewarded Tommy with a greasemonkey job in Texas at the Three Point Airlines, where he soon became a pilot along with his girlfriend, Betty Lou Barnes, and his best buddy, Peter &quot;Skeeter&quot; Milligan. The trio eventually became part owners in Three Point and took off for many airborne adventures.

By 1940, &quot;Tailspin Tommy&quot; began to lose papers. A change in syndicates from Bell to United Features did little to help, and the strip ended on March 15, 1942.

==Film==
Tailspin Tommy flew into movie theaters throughout the 1930s. He was portrayed by Maurice Murphy in the 12-episode 1934 movie serial &quot;Tailspin Tommy&quot;. Another 12-chapter serial, &quot;Tailspin Tommy in the Great Air Mystery&quot; (1935), starred Clark Williams in the title role. John Trent portrayed Tommy in a series of hour-long features, including &quot;Mystery Plane&quot;, &quot;Stunt Pilot&quot;, &quot;Sky Patrol&quot; and &quot;Danger Flight&quot;. All were released in 1939.

==Radio==
A CBS radio series based on the comic strip aired briefly on the U.S. West Coast in 1941, although details are somewhat sketchy. Jack Arnold and Earl Hammond played the roles of &quot;Tailspin&quot; and &quot;Skeeter&quot;. This 30-minute weekly show premiered on Friday, September 5, 1941 at 8:30 p.m., and originated from Los Angeles. In October it was switched to Sundays at 4:30 p.m.

There are also a couple of known 15-minute daily shows, but with unknown broadcast dates (if ever aired). At the end of one of these 15-minute episodes CBS announcer Wendell Niles states that the leads were played by Maurice Murphy and Noah Beery Jr., who were thus reprising their 1934 film roles as &quot;Tailspin&quot; and &quot;Skeeter&quot;.

==Comic books and reprints==

Stephen Slesinger Inc. published a series of 30 &quot;Tailspin Tommy Adventures&quot; in eight-page booklet form as a promotion with Big Thrill Chewing Gum. In 1936, C.J.H. Publications put out two issues of &quot;Tailspin Tommy Adventure Magazine&quot;. The magazines published adaptations of comic strip stories. Publication apparently ceased because the rights to the character had not been properly secured. After taking over the syndication, United Features published two &quot;Tailspin Tommy&quot; comic books, one in 1940 and one in 1946. &quot;Tailspin Tommy&quot; also saw reprints in Dell Comics&#x27; &quot;The Funnies&quot; and &quot;Popular Comics&quot;.

In 1934, &quot;Tailspin Tommy&quot; was among the strips reprinted in the first modern comic book, &quot;Famous Funnies&quot;, published by Max Gaines at Eastern Color Printing. That same year, Slesinger began publishing a series of &quot;Tailspin Tommy&quot; books in its Big Little Book line. Except where noted, beginning with Tailspin Tommy and the Island in the Sky these adaptations of the comic strip were ghostwritten by Gaylord Du Bois and illustrated by Hal Forrest:

*&quot;Tailspin Tommy in The Famous Pay-Roll Mystery&quot;, 1933
*&quot;Tailspin Tommy - The Dirigible Flight to the North Pole&quot;, 1934
*&quot;Tailspin Tommy - Hunting for Pirate Gold&quot;, 1935
*&quot;Tailspin Tommy and the Island in the Sky&quot;, 1936
*&quot;Tailspin Tommy and the Hooded Flyer&quot;, 1937
*&quot;Tailspin Tommy and the Sky Bandits&quot;, 1938
*&quot;Tailspin Tommy in The Great Air Mystery (starring Noah Beery)&quot;, 1938 (based on the screenplay of the serial)
*&quot;Tailspin Tommy and the Lost Transport&quot;, 1940
*&quot;Tailspin Tommy, The Weasel, and His Skywayman&quot;, 1941

Others:

* &quot;Tailspin Tommy&quot;, a Big Little paperback (no subtitle), 1935
* &quot;Tailspin Tommy in Flying Aces&quot;, from Dell Publishing, 1938

A novel by Mark Stevens, &quot;Tailspin Tommy: The Mystery of the Midnight Patrol&quot;, was published by Grosset &amp; Dunlap in 1936

==History==
Eiheiji is part of ancient Echizen Province, and has been populated since the Japanese Paleolithic period. Numerous Kofun period remains have been found in the area, which was part of a large &quot;shōen&quot; in the Heian period. During the Kamakura period, in 1244, the monk Dōgen established the Sōtō Zen monastery of Eihei-ji, and the present town developed as a &quot;monzen-machi&quot; town attached to the temple. During the Edo period, the area was part of the holdings of Fukui Domain. Following the Meiji restoration, it was organised into part of Yoshida District in Fukui Prefecture. With the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889, the villages of Shihidani, Shimoshihi and Jōhō-ji were established. These villages were merged to form the village of Shihi on March 1, 1954. On September 1, 1962 Shihi was raised to town status, and was renamed Eiheiji.

On February 13, 2006 the town of Matsuoka and the village of Kamishihi, both from Yoshida District, were merged into the town of Eiheiji.

<doc id="860497" wikidata="Q2748733" url="?curid=860497" title="Patapsco River">
<text>The Patapsco River ( ) mainstem is a river in central Maryland that flows into the Chesapeake Bay. The river&#x27;s tidal portion forms the harbor for the city of Baltimore. With its South Branch, the Patapsco forms the northern border of Howard County, Maryland. The name &quot;Patapsco&quot; is derived from the Algonquian &quot;pota-psk-ut&quot;, which translates to &quot;backwater&quot; or &quot;tide covered with froth&quot;.

==History==
Captain John Smith was the first European to explore the river, noting it on his 1612 map as the Bolus River. The &quot;Red river&quot;, named after the clay color, is considered the &quot;old Bolus&quot;, as other branches were also labeled Bolus on maps. As the river was not navigable beyond Elkridge, it was not a significant path of commerce; in 1723, only one ship was listed as serving the northern branch, and four others operating around the mouth.

The first land record regarding Parr&#x27;s Springs, the source of the South Branch, dates from 1744, when John Parr laid out a tract he called Parr&#x27;s Range. During the Civil War, Parr&#x27;s Spring was a stop for the Army of the Potomac&#x27;s Brig. Gen. David M. Gregg&#x27;s cavalry, on June 29, 1863, while en route to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Parr&#x27;s Spring was dug to form a pond in the 1950s, filled by seven spring heads that form the headwaters of the South Branch of the Patapsco River.

Beginning in the 1770s, the Patapsco River became the center of Maryland industrialization. Milling and manufacturing operations abounded along the river throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, generally powered by small dams. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s original main line was constructed in 1829 west along the Patapsco Valley; the nation&#x27;s first railroad, the route remains, though much altered. Many railroad bridges were built in the valley, including the Thomas Viaduct, which is still in use, and the Patterson Viaduct, now in ruins. The 1907 hydropower Bloede&#x27;s Dam powered flour mills.

An 1868 flood washed away 14 houses and killed 39 people around Ellicott City. A 1923 flood topped bridges. In 1952, an wall of water swept the shops of Ellicott City. A 1956 flood severely damaged the Bartigis Brothers plant. In 1972, rainfall from the remnants of Hurricane Agnes damaged Ellicott City and the Old Main Line. Two died in the July 2016 Maryland flood ravaged Main Street, followed two years later by a May 2018 Maryland flood that took the life of a rescuer.

The mouth of the Patapsco River forms Baltimore Harbor, the site of the Battle of Baltimore during the War of 1812. This is where Francis Scott Key, aboard the British , wrote &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, a poem later set to music as the national anthem of the United States. Today, a red, white, and blue buoy marks where the ship was anchored.

Bloede&#x27;s Dam, a hydroelectric dam built in 1906, was on the Patapsco River within Patapsco Valley State Park, a nearly complete barrier to anadromous fish passage. Although a fish ladder was installed in 1992, it blocked five of six native fish species trying to run upstream to spawn. Efforts to remove Bloede&#x27;s Dam began in the 1980s when nine drowning deaths occurred, and also to restore fish passage to a large portion of the Patapsco River watershed. Dam demolition began on September 12, 2018, opening the fishery and creating a rocky rapid for kayaking. Two dams upstream of Bloede&#x27;s Dam, Simkins and Union, were removed in 2010. The removal of Bloede&#x27;s Dam leaves Daniels Dam, upstream, as the last remaining dam along the mainstem Patapsco River.

In the early hours of March 26, 2024, the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which carried Interstate 695 over the Patapsco River, was struck by a container ship and partially collapsed into the river.

==Course==
The South Branch rises at Parr&#x27;s Spring, where Howard County, Carroll, Frederick, and Montgomery counties meet. The latter begins at elevation on Parr&#x27;s Ridge, just south of Interstate 70 and east of Ridge Road (Highway 27), south of Mount Airy, Maryland. The South Branch Patapsco River traces the southern boundary of Carroll County and the northern boundary of Howard County.

The North Branch flows southward from its origins in Carroll County. Liberty Dam and its reservoir on the North Branch are major components of the Baltimore City water system.

The Patapsco River mainstem begins at the confluence of the North and South Branches, near Marriottsville, about west of downtown Baltimore. Through most of its length, the Patapsco is a minor river flowing mostly through a narrow valley. Patapsco Valley State Park extends along of the Patapsco and its branches, encompassing in five areas. The river cuts a gorge 100 to 200 feet (35–70 m) deep within the park, with rocky cliffs and tributary waterfalls.

The last , form a large tidal estuary inlet of Chesapeake Bay. Two lobes of the harbor deviate from the &quot;mainstem&quot; harbor: the Middle Branch Patapsco River, into which Gwynns Falls; and the Northwest Branch Patapsco River, into which Jones Falls flows. The inner part of this estuary provides the harbor of Baltimore. Thoms Cove is further down the main harbor. The Patapsco estuary is south of the Back River and north of the Magothy River.

== Tributaries ==
The Patapsco has a watershed (including the water surface) of .

==Ecology and conservation==
The removal of Bloede&#x27;s Dam in September 2018, opened up of the Patapsco River watershed, which will potentially restore spawning runs of at least six species of native anadromous fish: alewife (&quot;Alosa pseudoharengus&quot;), blueback herring (&quot;Alosa aestivalis&quot;), American shad (&quot;Alosa sapidissima&quot;), hickory shad (&quot;Alosa mediocris&quot;), striped bass (&quot;Morone saxatilis&quot;), sea lamprey (&quot;Petromyzon marinus&quot;), as only one species, sea lamprey, were found using the Bloede&#x27;s Dam fish ladder in 2012. One catadromous species would likely also benefit, the American eel (&quot;Anguilla rostrata&quot;), a fish species that lives in freshwater and migrates to the ocean to breed. The Bloede&#x27;s Dam removal project was led by American Rivers and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.

Now that Bloede&#x27;s Dam has been removed, removal of Daniels Dam upstream on the mainstem Patapsco River would open to anadromous fishes the remaining of Patapsco River mainstem, the entire length of the South Branch Patapsco River, of the North Branch Patapsco River up to the Liberty Dam, and many of these rivers&#x27; tributaries.

==Water quality==
The eastern portion of the Patapsco River is in a highly urbanized area and is subject to extensive stormwater runoff and other forms of water pollution. The Maryland Department of the Environment has identified the Lower North Branch as containing high levels of heavy metals (chromium, arsenic, cadmium, copper, mercury, nickel, lead, selenium, and zinc), as well as phosphorus, fecal coliform bacteria, and PCBs. The Piney Run Reservoir on the South Branch of the Patapsco is polluted by excess levels of phosphorus and sediment.

Environmental nonprofit organizations, such as The Friends of Patapsco Valley &amp; Heritage Greenway, Inc. (PHG), lead clean-up efforts by the residents of surrounding communities. From 2006 to 2012, PHG volunteers participated in 183 stream clean-ups, removing 264 tons of trash from the streams of the Patapsco Valley watershed.

== Recreation ==
Recreational swimming is possible in areas of the Patapsco River, sometimes involving rope swings, inner tubing, and wading. The river also serves as a venue for rafting.
The Patapsco is also great for fishing. The MD DNR stocks parts of Patapsco State Park in the early spring and offers some pretty decent trout fishing. The Northern Snakehead has also made the Patapsco their home. They can be found from historic Ellicott City to the harbor.

==Crossings==
This is a list of all crossings of the main stem of the Patapsco River, as well as its two downstream short branches, the Middle Branch and Northwest Branch. Listings start downstream and continue upstream to the sources of the rivers.

<text>was a town located in Sakai District, Fukui Prefecture, Japan.

In the 1870s, the Meiji government constructed a harbor at Mikuni, under supervision of the Dutch engineer George Arnold Escher.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 23,207 and a density of 499.94 persons per km2. The total area was 46.42 km2.

On March 20, 2006, Mikuni, along with the towns of Sakai (former), Harue and Maruoka (all from Sakai District), was merged to create the city of Sakai.

Every August there is a fireworks display at Sunset Beach in Mikuni. Many of the fireworks are floating charges distributed by boat. These explode on the water&#x27;s surface, creating unique effects.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Sakai has recently plateaued after a long period of growth. Sakai is the second most populous city in Fukui Prefecture. The Harue and Maruoka neighborhoods in the southern part of the city function as commuter towns for the city of Fukui.
==History==
Sakai is part of the ancient Echizen Province. The semi-legendary Kofun period Emperor Keitai is said to have come from the area that is now the Maruoka neighbourhood of Sakai. During the Edo period, the area was divided between the holdings of the Maruoka Domain, Fukui Domain and &quot;tenryō&quot; holdings directly under control of the Tokugawa shogunate. Following the Meiji restoration, the area was organised into part of Sakai District in Fukui Prefecture. The epicentre of the 1948 Fukui earthquake was in Maruoka. The towns of Mikuni and Maruoka were created with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. The village of Harue was raised to town status on April 3, 1942. The village of Sakai was created on March 1, 1955 by the merger of the villages of Higashi-Jūgō, Hyōgo and Ōseki. It was raised to town status on April 1, 1961. The modern city of Sakai was established on March 20, 2006, from the merger of the former town of Sakai with the towns of Harue, Maruoka and Mikuni. Sakai District was dissolved as a result of this merger.

<doc id="860507" wikidata="Q190898" url="?curid=860507" title="Centered polygonal number">
<text>In mathematics, the centered polygonal numbers are a class of series of figurate numbers, each formed by a central dot, surrounded by polygonal layers of dots with a constant number of sides. Each side of a polygonal layer contains one more dot than each side in the previous layer; so starting from the second polygonal layer, each layer of a centered &quot;k&quot;-gonal number contains &quot;k&quot; more dots than the previous layer.

== Examples ==

Each centered &quot;k&quot;-gonal number in the series is &quot;k&quot; times the previous triangular number, plus 1. This can be formalized by the expression formula_1, where &quot;n&quot; is the series rank, starting with 0 for the initial 1. For example, each centered square number in the series is four times the previous triangular number, plus 1. This can be formalized by the expression formula_2.

These series consist of the
*centered triangular numbers 1, 4, 10, 19, 31, 46, 64, 85, 109, 136, 166, 199, ... (),
*centered square numbers 1, 5, 13, 25, 41, 61, 85, 113, 145, 181, 221, 265, ... (), which are exactly the sum of consecutive squares, i.e., n^2 + (n - 1)^2.
*centered pentagonal numbers 1, 6, 16, 31, 51, 76, 106, 141, 181, 226, 276, 331, ... (),
*centered hexagonal numbers 1, 7, 19, 37, 61, 91, 127, 169, 217, 271, 331, 397, ... (), which are exactly the difference of consecutive cubes, i.e. &quot;n&quot;3 − (&quot;n&quot; − 1)3,
*centered heptagonal numbers 1, 8, 22, 43, 71, 106, 148, 197, 253, 316, 386, 463, ... (),
*centered octagonal numbers 1, 9, 25, 49, 81, 121, 169, 225, 289, 361, 441, 529, ... (), which are exactly the odd squares,
*centered nonagonal numbers 1, 10, 28, 55, 91, 136, 190, 253, 325, 406, 496, 595, ... (), which include all even perfect numbers except 6,
*centered decagonal numbers 1, 11, 31, 61, 101, 151, 211, 281, 361, 451, 551, 661, ... (),
*centered hendecagonal numbers 1, 12, 34, 67, 111, 166, 232, 309, 397, 496, 606, 727, ... (),
*centered dodecagonal numbers 1, 13, 37, 73, 121, 181, 253, 337, 433, 541, 661, 793, ... (), which are also the star numbers,

and so on.

The following diagrams show a few examples of centered polygonal numbers and their geometric construction. Compare these diagrams with the diagrams in Polygonal number.

=== Centered square numbers ===

=== Centered hexagonal numbers ===


== Formulas ==

As can be seen in the above diagrams, the &quot;n&quot;th centered &quot;k&quot;-gonal number can be obtained by placing &quot;k&quot; copies of the (&quot;n&quot;−1)th triangular number around a central point; therefore, the &quot;n&quot;th centered &quot;k&quot;-gonal number is equal to

:formula_3

The difference of the &quot;n&quot;-th and the (&quot;n&quot;+1)-th consecutive centered &quot;k&quot;-gonal numbers is &quot;k&quot;(2&quot;n&quot;+1).

The &quot;n&quot;-th centered &quot;k&quot;-gonal number is equal to the &quot;n&quot;-th regular &quot;k&quot;-gonal number plus (&quot;n&quot;-1)2.

Just as is the case with regular polygonal numbers, the first centered &quot;k&quot;-gonal number is 1. Thus, for any &quot;k&quot;, 1 is both &quot;k&quot;-gonal and centered &quot;k&quot;-gonal. The next number to be both &quot;k&quot;-gonal and centered &quot;k&quot;-gonal can be found using the formula:

:formula_4

which tells us that 10 is both triangular and centered triangular, 25 is both square and centered square, etc.

Whereas a prime number &quot;p&quot; cannot be a polygonal number (except the trivial case, i.e. each &quot;p&quot; is the second &quot;p&quot;-gonal number), many centered polygonal numbers are primes. In fact, if &quot;k&quot; ≥ 3, &quot;k&quot; ≠ 8, &quot;k&quot; ≠ 9, then there are infinitely many centered &quot;k&quot;-gonal numbers which are primes (assuming the Bunyakovsky conjecture). Since all centered octagonal numbers are also square numbers, and all centered nonagonal numbers are also triangular numbers (and not equal to 3), thus both of them cannot be prime numbers.

== Sum of reciprocals ==

The sum of reciprocals for the centered &quot;k&quot;-gonal numbers is

:formula_5, if &quot;k&quot; ≠ 8

:formula_6, if &quot;k&quot; = 8

<text>The following article gives a list of association football confederations, sub-confederations and associations around the world. The sport&#x27;s international governing body is FIFA, but those associations not affiliated with FIFA are also included in this article.

Most European, African, and Asian countries have two principal competitions: a more prestigious league which is typically a double round-robin tournament restricted to the elite clubs, and a cup which is a single-elimination tournament open to both the elite and lesser clubs.

In the Americas, leagues are often organised as either multi-stage tournaments or separate Apertura and Clausura stages.

==By continent==
===Affiliated with FIFA===
There are currently 211 national associations which are members of FIFA. An additional 11 associations are full or associate members of a continental confederation, but not members of FIFA.

===Other governing bodies===
==By subregion==
===Africa===


===Asia===


===North, Central America and the Caribbean===
==By country==
The football associations listed in this section are members of FIFA-affiliated confederations. They are listed by their official names registered with FIFA.

===Africa===

===Asia===

===Europe===

All UEFA associations are affiliated with FIFA.
===North, Central America and the Caribbean===

===Oceania===

===South America===

All CONMEBOL associations are affiliated with FIFA.
==Non-FIFA associations==
The football associations in this section represent fully and partially recognized sovereign states, dependent territories, and stateless nations that are not members of FIFA or a FIFA confederation.

Several of these non-FIFA associations are included in the World Football Elo Ratings, which ranks all national association football teams from FIFA-affiliated confederations, in addition to some unaffiliated teams. Several of these associations are also members of the Confederation of Independent Football Associations and/or the International Island Games Association.

===Africa===
===Asia===
===Europe===
* Akrotiri and Dhekelia and Svalbard do not have a Football Association.

===North, Central America and the Caribbean===
===Oceania===
* Pitcairn Islands does not have a Football Association.

===South America===
===Regional===
Beneath the national level, governance of football may be divided up into regional or territorial associations. Other non-national associations represent stateless populations, diasporas or micronations. Details of these are listed at non-FIFA international football.

<text>was a town located in Nanjō District, Fukui Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 5,819 and a density of 109.67 persons per km2. The total area was 53.06 km2.

On January 1, 2005, Nanjō, along with the town of Imajō, and the village of Kōno (all from Nanjō District), was merged to create the town of Minamiechizen. As of this merger, the town of Nanjō no longer exists as an independent municipality.

==People==
Nanjō is a rural town consisting of small villages spread out over the Nanjō area. Each village has unique qualities and you will find that many people from the same village share the same surname. The people tend to be shy to foreigners but are friendly if they are spoken to or greeted in Japanese.

==Nanjō Football Club==
Nanjō F.C. is one of the oldest sporting establishments in the town. The club has been running for over 30 years and was established by Don Inoue. The club consists of underage teams and two adult teams. Nanjō FC play in the Fukui Prefectural 1st Division and are generally made up of towns people from the ages of 18 to 30. They have had great success in the Fukui Prefectural league but in recent years have been struggling with under strength teams. Nanjō Hastericks are the second adult team in the village and consist of former Nanjō FC players over 30 years old. They have been playing in the Fukui Prefectural 2nd Division over the last 7 years which is a great credit since the other teams in the division are made up of much younger players.

Following the Meiji restoration, it was organised into part of Mikata District in Fukui Prefecture. With the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889, the villages of Kitasaigō, Minamisaigō, Mimi, and Santō were established. The four villages merged to form the town of Mihama on February 11, 1954.

<text>Action for Children (formerly National Children&#x27;s Home) is a UK children&#x27;s charity created to help vulnerable children and young people and their families in the UK. The charity has 7,000 staff and volunteers who operate over 475 services in the UK. They served a total of 671,275 children in 2021 and 2022. Action for Children&#x27;s national headquarters is in Watford, and it is a registered charity under English and Scottish law. In 2017/2018, it had a gross income of £151 million.

==History==
The first &#x27;Children&#x27;s Home&#x27;, a renovated stable in Church Street, Waterloo, was founded in 1869 by Methodist minister Thomas Bowman Stephenson, who had been moved by the plight of children living on the street in London. The first two boys were admitted on 9 July 1869. In 1871 the home was moved to Bonner Road, Victoria Park, and girls were admitted. The home was approved by the Wesleyan Methodist Conference in the same year. A year later, in 1872, a second home opened in Edgworth, Lancashire.

The homes were divided into small family units run by a &#x27;house mother&#x27; and &#x27;house father&#x27;, which was in marked contrast to the large institutions and workhouses common at the time. Training was also an important aspect. A childcare course was set up in 1878, and the graduates of this programme—who were called &#x27;the Sisterhood&#x27; or &#x27;the Sisters of the Children&#x27;—went on to work in the home.

An industrial school at Milton, Gravesend, was taken over in 1875, and a children&#x27;s refuge in Ramsey on the Isle of Man was established in 1882. With the opening of the Princess Alice Orphanage in Birmingham the home was renamed &#x27;Children&#x27;s Home and Orphanage&#x27;.

Further properties in Alverstoke, Hampshire; Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire; Frodsham, Cheshire; and Bramhope near Leeds were acquired, and, by 1908, the charity had grown to become the &#x27;National Children&#x27;s Home and Orphanage&#x27;.

In 1913, work began on a large site in Harpenden, which became home to over 200 children, with a print works for apprentices. It subsequently became the charity&#x27;s head office.

Many other new branches and schools were founded, including the first residential nursery branch in Sutton Coldfield in 1929 and the first Scottish branch in Glasgow in 1955. The charity became an adoption agency in 1926.

The Rev. Gordon Barritt, who became the head of NCH in 1969, started the process of closing the organisation&#x27;s children&#x27;s homes and starting to offer support to keep children with their families.

In 1994, the charity changed its name to &#x27;NCH Action for Children&#x27;. Fourteen years later, in September 2008, it became &#x27;Action for Children&#x27;. The changes were part of the shift away from providing children&#x27;s homes (most of which have now closed) to a wider range of services.

In December 2016, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, succeeded The Queen as patron of the organisation.

==Child migration==

The NCH set up a child emigration scheme in 1873, and a branch in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, opened. This programme of sending children to Canada, where they were called Home Children, has been criticised, and children have been found to have been abused following migration. The NCH itself has said that &quot;the experience of migration was profoundly damaging to significant numbers of the children concerned&quot;. NCH is estimated to have sent 3,500 children to Canada between 1873 and 1931 and a small number of children to Australia in the 1930s and early 1950s. The Independent Inquiry found that some children were sent by the NCH without their parents&#x27; consent, and that some children who wanted to come back to the UK were not allowed by the NCH to do so. The inquiry concluded that, although the NCH&#x27;s principles of care had been ambitious for the time, some children were placed in &quot;harsh conditions&quot;:

The organisation continues to offer an information and record-access service to people who were sent overseas as children under its auspices.

==Projects and services==

Action for Children works in partnership with statutory bodies to deliver services for children, young people, and their families in five main areas:

=== Family support ===
Action for Children is a major provider of family support services and works in partnership with local authorities across the UK. The aim is to facilitate early intervention and then offer long-term help so families can stay together if possible. This is provided through children&#x27;s and family centres, parenting programmes, and targeted intervention initiatives, often with the hardest-to-reach groups in the community.

=== Disability ===
Action for Children runs specialist projects for disabled children and those with learning and behavioural difficulties. These include residential care, short breaks and respite care services, keyworker support for families and carers, and advocacy work to help young disabled people transition into adulthood.

=== Children in care ===
Action for Children is a registered adoption agency and delivers fostering programmes. The charity also runs a number of small residential units for children and young people, as well as supporting young care leavers moving into independent living.

=== Support for young people ===
Action for Children works with vulnerable and disadvantaged young people. Issues these young people may face include alcohol and substance misuse, anti-social behaviour, homelessness, and unemployment. Other services offer support for young carers, teenage parents, victims of sexual abuse, and those leaving young offenders institutions. This support is provided through a range of services, which offer counselling, help with housing and benefits, access to training and education, basic skills tuition, mediation, and mentoring.

=== Education ===
Action for Children runs a number of schools for children and young people with disabilities, profound and multiple learning difficulties (PMLD) and challenging behaviour (including social or emotional problems). The charity&#x27;s aim is to offer a secure environment in which to facilitate educational, social and personal development adapted to pupils&#x27; individual abilities. The schools offer both residential placements and day care.

==Research==
Action for Children carries out and commissions research into issues around children, young people and families.

The charity also produces a yearly Impact Report, which details research findings on the outcomes and cost effectiveness of its work supporting children and young people.

==Campaigning==

Action for Children campaigns and lobbies governments on behalf of vulnerable children and young people and their families.

One of the charity&#x27;s current campaigns, &#x27;Best Start in Life&#x27;, seeks to address the issue of children – particularly those from poorer backgrounds – struggling to receive the right early years support. The campaign calls on the government to take urgent action so that children under five do not fall behind, either due to cuts in vital services or unequal access to opportunities.

Action for Children is a member of the Disabled Children&#x27;s Partnership alongside 27 other charities, working towards better health and social care for disabled children, young people and their families.

The charity also leads the children and families work of the Jo Cox Commission on Loneliness and is a partner of End Child Poverty.

Action for Children is a founding member of Fostering Through Social Enterprise (FtSE), a consortium of voluntary and non-profit fostering agencies that advocate for children in respect of regulation, as well as representing its membership at central government level.

==Fundraising==
Action for Children raises money through corporate partnerships, fundraising events (such as sponsored runs) and through its partnership with the British Methodist Church.

The charity is also involved with several large fundraising events, including Byte Night – an IT industry event which raises money to prevent youth homelessness – and Never Mind The Business, a music-based quiz night for business people.

In 2018, Action for Children launched its Secret Santa fundraising campaign. The campaign encouraged the public to become a Secret Santa for a vulnerable child, donating £10 or more to support children in the UK at Christmas.

Because of its links to the Methodist Church, which opposes gambling, before 2003 Action for Children did not accept National Lottery funding.

In 2000 and 2002, the organisation was criticised, including by its own staff, for accepting funding from BAE Systems, an arms manufacturer.

<doc id="860569" wikidata="Q7614799" url="?curid=860569" title="Steven Hatfill">
<text>Steven Jay Hatfill (born October 24, 1953) is an American pathologist and biological weapons expert. He became the subject of extensive media coverage beginning in mid-2002, when he was a suspect in the 2001 anthrax attacks. His home was repeatedly raided by the FBI, his phone was tapped, and he was extensively surveilled for more than two years; he was also terminated from his job at Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). At a news conference in August 2002, Hatfill denied that he had anything to do with the anthrax letters and said &quot;irresponsible news media coverage based on government leaks&quot; had &quot;destroyed his reputation&quot;. He filed a lawsuit in 2003, accusing the FBI agents and Justice Department officials who led the criminal investigation of leaking information about him to the press in violation of the Privacy Act.

In 2008, the government settled Hatfill&#x27;s lawsuit with a $4.6 million annuity totaling $5.8 million in payment. The government officially exonerated him of any involvement in the anthrax attacks, and the Justice Department identified another military scientist, Bruce Edwards Ivins, as the sole perpetrator of the anthrax attacks. Jeffrey A. Taylor, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, wrote in a letter to Hatfill&#x27;s lawyer that &quot;we have concluded, based on laboratory access records, witness accounts and other information, that Dr. Hatfill did not have access to the particular anthrax used in the attacks, and that he was not involved in the anthrax mailings.&quot;

In 2004, Hatfill filed lawsuits against several periodicals and journalists who had identified him as a figure warranting further investigation in the anthrax attacks. He sued New York Times Company and &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Nicholas Kristof for defamation, defamation &quot;per se&quot;, and intentional infliction of emotional distress in connection with five of Kristof&#x27;s columns in 2002. The courts dismissed this suit, finding that Hatfill was a limited purpose public figure. In 2007, Hatfill settled a similar libel lawsuit against &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; for an undisclosed amount, after both magazines agreed to formally retract any implication that Hatfill was involved in the anthrax mailings.

In 2010, Hatfill was an independent researcher and an adjunct assistant professor of emergency medicine at the George Washington University Medical Center. He has criticized the response of health authorities to the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa and suggested that it is possible that Ebola could be transmitted by aerosol, a position which other experts have criticized.

In 2020, he became a coronavirus advisor to the Trump White House, where he strongly promoted the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat the virus despite FDA objections to the drug. After the 2020 election he became part of Donald Trump&#x27;s attempt to overturn the election results.

==Early life==
Hatfill was born in Saint Louis, Missouri, and graduated from Mattoon Senior High School, Mattoon, Illinois (1971), and Southwestern College in Winfield, Kansas (1975), where he studied biology.

Hatfill was enlisted as a private in the U.S. Army from 1975 to 1977. (In 1999, during an interview with a journalist, he claimed to have been a &quot;captain in the U.S. Special Forces&quot;, but a subsequent investigation revealed that, according to the Army, he had never served with the Special Forces.) Following his Army discharge, Hatfill qualified and worked as a medical laboratory technician, but soon resolved to become a doctor. He worked as a medical missionary in Kapanga, Zaire under a mentor, Dr. Glenn Eschtruth, who was murdered there in 1977. A brief marriage, from 1976 to 1978, to Eschtruth&#x27;s daughter, Caroline Ruth Eschtruth, produced one daughter.

==Medical education==
In 1978, Hatfill settled in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and entered the Godfrey Huggins Medical School at the University of Rhodesia in Salisbury (now Harare). (His claimed military associations during this period included assistance as a medic with the Selous Scouts and membership in the Rhodesian SAS, but according to one journalist the regimental association of the latter is &quot;adamant Hatfill never belonged to the unit&quot;.) After failing in 1983, he graduated in 1984 with a M ChB degree and, in 1984 to 1985, completed a one-year internship at a small rural hospital in South Africa&#x27;s North West Province. The South African government recruited him to be medical officer on a 14-month tour of duty, from 1986 to 1988, in Antarctica with the South African National Antarctic Expedition (SANAE). In 1988, he completed a master&#x27;s degree in microbiology at the University of Cape Town. Two years later, he worked toward a second master&#x27;s degree—in medical biochemistry and radiation biology—at the University of Stellenbosch, while employed as a medical technician in the university&#x27;s clinical hematology lab. A three-year hematological pathology residency at Stellenbosch from 1991 to 1993 followed. Hatfill also conducted research toward a Ph.D. between 1992 and 1995—under the supervision of microbiology professor Ralph Kirby at Rhodes University—on the treatment of leukemia with thalidomide.

Hatfill submitted his Ph.D. thesis for examination to Rhodes University in January 1995, but it was failed in November. Hatfill later claimed to have completed a Ph.D. degree in &quot;molecular cell biology&quot; at Rhodes, as well as a post-doctoral fellowship (1994–95) at the University of Oxford in England and three master&#x27;s degrees (in microbial genetics, medical biochemistry, and experimental pathology), respectively. Some of these credentials have been seriously questioned or disputed. During a later investigation, officials at Rhodes maintained that their institution had never awarded him a Ph.D. In 2007, Hatfill&#x27;s lawyer Tom Connolly – in his lawsuit against former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft and the FBI – admitted that his client had &quot;[p]uffed on his resume,&quot; falsely claiming he had earned a PhD and had &quot;[f]orged a diploma&quot; for the PhD.

Back in the United States, another of Hatfill&#x27;s post-doctoral appointments commenced at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, in 1995. He then worked in 1997 to 1999 as a civilian researcher at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), the U.S. Department of Defense&#x27;s medical research institute for biological warfare (BW) defense at Fort Detrick, Frederick, Maryland. There, he studied, under a National Research Council fellowship, new drug treatments for the Ebola virus and became an authority on BW defense.

==Anthrax attacks==
In January 1999 Hatfill transferred to a &quot;consulting job&quot; at Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), which has a &quot;sprawling campus&quot; in nearby McLean, Virginia. The corporation did work for a multitude of federal agencies. Many projects were classified. Hatfill designed BW defense training curricula for government agencies.

By this time there had been a number of hoax anthrax mailings in the United States. Hatfill and his collaborator, SAIC vice president Joseph Soukup, commissioned William C. Patrick, retired head of the old US bioweapons program (who had also been a mentor of Hatfill) to write a report on the possibilities of terrorist anthrax mailing attacks. Barbara Hatch Rosenberg (director of the Federation of American Scientists&#x27; biochem weapons working group in 2002) said that the report was commissioned &quot;under a CIA contract to SAIC&quot;. But SAIC said Hatfill and Soukup had commissioned it there was no outside client.

The resulting report, dated February 1999, was subsequently seen by some as a &quot;blueprint&quot; for the 2001 anthrax attacks. Amongst other things, it suggested the maximum amount of anthrax that could be put in an envelope without making a suspicious bulge. The quantity in the envelope sent to Senator Patrick Leahy in October 2001 was 0.871 grams. After the attacks, the report drew the attention of the media and others, and led to their investigation of Patrick and Hatfill.

===Assertions by Rosenberg===
As soon as it became known, in October 2001, that the Ames strain of anthrax had been used in the attacks, Barbara Hatch Rosenberg and others began suggesting that the mailings might be the work of a &quot;rogue CIA agent&quot; and they provided the name of the &quot;most likely&quot; person to the FBI. On November 21, 2001, Rosenberg made similar statements to the Biological and Toxic Weapons convention in Geneva. In December 2001, she published &quot;A Compilation of Evidence and Comments on the Source of the Mailed Anthrax&quot; via the web site of the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) suggesting the attacks were &quot;perpetrated with the unwitting assistance of a sophisticated government program&quot;.

Rosenberg discussed the case with reporters from the &quot;New York Times&quot;. On January 4, 2002, Nicholas Kristof of the &quot;New York Times&quot; published a column titled &quot;Profile of a Killer&quot; stating &quot;I think I know who sent out the anthrax last fall.&quot; For months, Rosenberg gave speeches and stated her beliefs to many reporters from around the world. She posted &quot;Analysis of the Anthrax Attacks&quot; to the FAS web site on January 17, 2002. On February 5, 2002, she published an article called &quot;Is the FBI Dragging Its Feet?&quot; At the time, the FBI denied reports that investigators had identified a chief suspect, saying &quot;There is no prime suspect in this case at this time.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that &quot;FBI officials over the last week have flatly discounted Dr. Rosenberg&#x27;s claims.&quot;

On June 13, 2002, Rosenberg posted &quot;The Anthrax Case: What the FBI Knows&quot; to the FAS site. Five days later, Rosenberg presented her theories to senate staffers working for Senators Daschle and Leahy. On June 25, the FBI publicly searched Hatfill&#x27;s apartment, turning him into a household name. &quot;The FBI also pointed out that Hatfill had agreed to the search and is not considered a suspect.&quot; Both &quot;The American Prospect&quot; and &quot;Salon.com&quot; reported that &quot;Hatfill is not a suspect in the anthrax case, the FBI says.&quot; On August 3, 2002, Rosenberg told the media that the FBI asked her if &quot;a team of government scientists could be trying to frame Steven J. Hatfill.&quot;

===Person of interest===
In August 2002, Attorney General John Ashcroft labeled Hatfill a &quot;person of interest&quot; in a press conference, although no charges were brought against him. Hatfill, who researched viruses, vehemently denied having any connection to the anthrax mailings and sued the FBI, the Justice Department, John Ashcroft, Alberto Gonzales, and others for violating his constitutional rights and the Privacy Act. On June 27, 2008, the Department of Justice announced it would settle Hatfill&#x27;s case for $5.8 million.

Hatfill later went to work at Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. In September 2001, SAIC was commissioned by the Pentagon to create a replica of a mobile WMD &quot;laboratory&quot;, alleged to have been used by Saddam Hussein, then President of Iraq. The Pentagon said the trailer was to be used as a training aid for teams seeking weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.

His lawyer, Victor M. Glasberg, stated: &quot;Steve&#x27;s life has been devastated by a drumbeat of innuendo, implication and speculation. We have a frightening public attack on an individual who, guilty or not, should not be exposed to this type of public opprobrium based on speculation.&quot;

In an embarrassing incident, FBI agents trailing Hatfill in a motor vehicle ran over his foot when he attempted to approach them in May 2003. Police responding to the incident did not cite the driver, but issued Hatfill a citation for &quot;walking to create a hazard&quot;. He and his attorneys fought the ticket, but a hearing officer upheld the ticket and ordered Hatfill to pay the requisite $5 fine.

FBI Director Robert Mueller changed leadership of the investigation in late 2006, and at that time another suspect, USAMRIID bacteriologist Bruce Ivins, became the main focus of the investigation.
Considerable questions were raised about the credibility of the case against Ivins, as well.

===&quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview===
Hatfill&#x27;s lawyer, Tom Connolly, was featured in a CBS News &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview about the anthrax incidents on March 11, 2007. In the interview Connolly revealed that Hatfill faked his Ph.D. degree: &quot;It is true. It is true that he has puffed on his resume. Absolutely. Forged a diploma. Yes, that&#x27;s true.&quot; He went on to state, &quot;Listen, if puffing on your resume made you the anthrax killer, then half this town should be suspect.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that Hatfill had obtained an anti-anthrax medicine (ciprofloxacin, which is an antibiotic medication) immediately prior to the anthrax mailings. Connolly explained, &quot;Before the attacks he had surgery. So yes, he&#x27;s on Cipro. But the fuller truth is in fact he was on Cipro because a doctor gave it to him after sinus surgery.&quot; Hatfill had previously said the antibiotic was for a lingering sinus infection. The omission in the &quot;Times&quot;&#x27; article, of the reason why he had been taking Cipro, is one reason Hatfill sued the newspaper. The newspaper won a summary judgment ruling in early 2007, squelching the libel suit that had been filed by Steven Hatfill against it and columnist Nicholas Kristof.

==Lawsuits==
===&quot;Hatfill v. John Ashcroft, et al.&quot;===
In August 2003, Hatfill sued U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft, the U.S. Department of Justice, the FBI, FBI Supervisory Special Agent Van Harp, two DOJ employees, and an unknown number of FBI agents, alleging that the government denied his constitutional rights and attempted to scapegoat him for the anthrax attacks. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

In March 2007, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton allowed Hatfill to re-subpoena various reporters, seeking the names of government sources who had told reporters that Hatfill was under investigation. During an earlier round of discovery, Hatfill issued subpoenas to six reporters (Michael Isikoff and Daniel Klaidman of &quot;Newsweek&quot;, Brian Ross of ABC, Allan Lengel of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Jim Stewart of CBS, and Toni Locy of &quot;USA Today&quot;). In the second round of subpoenas, Hatfill subpoenaed eight news outlets, including three not previously subpoenaed. The federal government opposed Hatfill&#x27;s move as an impermissible expansion of discovery.

In March 2008, Walton held Toni Locy of &quot;USA Today&quot; in contempt of court for declining to identify her sources, fining her $500 per day, escalating to $5,000 a day, until she identified her sources. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit suspended the fines against Locy, and in November 2008 threw out the order because the case had settled. Locy&#x27;s position was supported by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and Reporters Without Borders, and she received the National Press Club&#x27;s John Aubuchon Freedom of the Press Award for her stance.

In January 2008, Walton ordered the parties to attempt mediation, and set a tentative trial date of December 2008 if settlement talks failed. In June 2008, a settlement was announced, in which the Justice Department agreed to pay $4.6 million (consisting of $2.825 million in cash and an annuity paying $150,000 a year for 20 years) to Hatfill. The settlement did not include an admission of liability by the government.

===&quot;Hatfill v. The New York Times&quot;===
In June 2003, Hatfill sued The New York Times Company and Nicholas D. Kristof for defamation in Virginia state court. Hatfill alleged that Kristof had published columns implying that he was responsible for the anthrax mailings, and thus defamed him. He refiled the suit in federal court in July 2004, alleging defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. After filing his complaint, Hatfill voluntarily dropped Kristof as a defendant because the federal district court lacked personal jurisdiction over the columnist.

The federal district court initially granted the newspaper&#x27;s motion to dismiss, holding that the language in Kristof&#x27;s columns could not reasonably read as accusing Hatfill of responsibility for anthrax attacks, and that the columns reported information on the federal investigation into Hatfill, without accusing him of guilt. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in July 2005, reversed this ruling (holding that &quot;Kristof&#x27;s columns, taken together, are capable of defamatory meaning under Virginia law&quot;) and returned the case to the district court for further proceedings.

In January 2007, Judge Claude M. Hilton threw out Hatfill&#x27;s defamation suit against &quot;The New York Times&quot;, granting summary judgment to the newspaper. The court held that Hatfill was either a &quot;public figure&quot; or &quot;public official&quot; and thus could only prevail in a defamation suit if the defendants acted with actual malice, and that Hatfill could not demonstrate that Kristof had acted with actual malice. The court additionally found that Hatfill could not, as a matter of law, meet his burden of proof that the allegedly defamatory statements were materially false; it also threw out his claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

In July 2008, the Fourth Circuit, in a unanimous decision, affirmed the district court&#x27;s ruling. In December 2008, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal, leaving the newspaper&#x27;s win intact.

===&quot;Hatfill v. Foster&quot;===
Donald Wayne Foster, an expert in forensic linguistics and a professor at Vassar College, advised the FBI during the investigation of the anthrax attacks. He later wrote an article for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; about his investigation of Hatfill. In the October 2003 article (entitled &quot;&quot;The Message in the Anthrax&quot;), Foster described how he had tried to match up Hatfill&#x27;s travels with the postmarks on the anthrax letters, and analyzed old interviews and an unpublished novel by Hatfill about a bioterror attack on the United States. Foster wrote that &quot;When I lined up Hatfill&#x27;s known movements with the postmark locations of reported biothreats, those hoax anthrax attacks appeared to trail him like a vapor cloud.&quot;

In 2004, Hatfill sued Foster and Condé Nast Publications, alleging defamation. He also sued The Reader&#x27;s Digest Association (which had published a condensed version of the article—entitled &quot;Tracking The Anthrax Killer&quot;—in the December 2003 issue of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;). In 2007, the defendants settled the case before trial on undisclosed terms. A statement by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; issued after the settlement was announced read: &quot;To the extent any statements contained in the article might be read to convey that Condé Nast and Professor Foster were accusing Dr. Hatfill of perpetrating these attacks, Condé Nast and Professor Foster retract any such implication.&quot;

===Hatfill case against blogger===
Hatfill obtained from Google the IP address behind the blog of one &quot;Luigi Warren&quot; hosted by Google&#x27;s Blogspot web-hosting service. According to &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Luigi Warren&quot; had &quot;operated a lurid rumor mill about Hatfill for more than a decade – promoting, in particular, hearsay about the years he lived and worked in southern Africa during the throes of apartheid.&quot; In 2010, Hatfill&#x27;s attorneys sent a letter to a stem-cell research scientist at Harvard Medical School whom they accused of authoring the &quot;Luigi Warren&quot; posts. The Harvard researcher, however, did not make the posts in question, and instead maintained a different blog, in which he wrote that &quot;the campaign to promote Steven Hatfill as a &#x27;person of interest&#x27; ... was a bureaucratic ruse or diversion to maintain a useful strategic ambiguity.&quot; The Harvard researcher believed that someone was impersonating him. Google revealed the IP address for the blog, which was traced to a computer at Stellenbosch University in South Africa (Hatfill&#x27;s alma mater); the university identified a radiation oncologist as the user of the computer in question, and the blogger later agreed to an undisclosed settlement.

==Post-settlement life==
===2010s===
Since the settlements of his legal cases, which included receiving $5.8 million (less legal costs) from the Justice Department (2008) and undisclosed sums from Condé Nast (2008) and the South African medical researcher (2010), Hatfill has pursued activities as an independent researcher. He was appointed an adjunct assistant professor of emergency medicine at the George Washington University Medical Center in 2010. In 2011, he added additional affiliations at GW in &quot;Clinical Research and Leadership&quot; and &quot;Microbiology, Immunology, and Tropical Medicine&quot;. (His BA degree and one MS degree — but not his other previously claimed medical degrees — appear on the GW Faculty Directory.) He oversaw construction of a &quot;state-of-the-art boat&quot; on which to conduct his own scientific trials. He has allocated more than $1 million of his own money to construct a full-scale prototype of what he calls &quot;Beagle III&quot;. This craft, with a crew of military veterans and scientists, would ply the waters of &quot;high-biodiversity areas&quot; – the Amazon, or the great rivers of Borneo – seeking and studying rare plants and fungi as sources of new drugs. A &quot;Newsweek&quot; interviewer has described ... ...Hatfill&#x27;s unbuilt, twin-diesel-powered boat. Inside the vessel&#x27;s aluminum hull, he envisioned a plexus of laboratories, with DNA microarrays and other &quot;space-age zuzu&quot; for analyzing the genetic compositions of plants. Bedrooms would be equipped with video-conferencing systems and DVD players, and the executive cabin was modeled after the president&#x27;s quarters on Air Force One... Hatfill had also thrown in a roof-mounted cosmic ray detector, which would switch on near the equator to capture data on &quot;high-energy cosmic ray showers&quot;. An onboard chef from the ranks of Le Cordon Bleu would fuel a crew of scientists and trainees, and a 30-day supply of dehydrated food would hedge against disaster.
Hatfill owns a colonial-style brick home in Marion County, Florida as well as a property in the El Yunque rain forest, in Puerto Rico, where he has run a military-style Outward Bound-like program. Hatfill chairs the Asymmetrical Biodiversity Studies and Observation Group (ABSOG) in Malaysia, a not-for-profit trust he has established to support his drug discovery boat mission. Hatfill has also established Templar Associates II, a for-profit corporation in Puerto Rico as a revenue-generator and as an &quot;environmental testing ground for new tactics, techniques, equipment, and procedures for ABSOG&#x27;s designated mission as well as for the U.S. military&quot;.
Hatfill is also medical director of EFP Tactical Medical Group, a London-based company that provides integrated training, security and tactical medical support services to government agencies, private corporations, and NGOs worldwide. (EFP Tacmed has extensive Middle Eastern and African contracts; it operates a remote jungle-training facility to test new equipment in &quot;high-biodiversity areas&quot;.) He is also a board member of Doctors for Disaster Preparedness, a politically conservative Arizona-based non-profit described by some journalists as a &quot;political fringe group&quot;. He claims status as a fellow of the Explorers Club.
In 2014, Hatfill publicly criticized the response of U.S. public health authorities to the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa and suggested that it is possible that Ebola could be transmitted by aerosol, an assertion which other experts have disputed; his views on this have been characterized as misrepresentations of the primary scientific literature by other experts.

In November 2019, Hatfill and two other authors self-published &quot;Three Seconds Until Midnight&quot;. The book examines current preparedness and unpreparedness for a devastating future influenza pandemic.

===2020s===
In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Hatfill was interviewed on several right-wing media outlets including Stephen Bannon&#x27;s &quot;War Room: Pandemic&quot;, &quot;The Epoch Times&quot;, and Sinclair Broadcast Group&#x27;s &quot;Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson&quot;. He opposed the U.S. response to the pandemic, particularly the exclusion of hydroxychloroquine for early treatment of COVID-19, making unproven claims that the low fatality rate experienced by some nations is the result of their early use of the drug.

In February 2020, Hatfill became an unpaid &quot;volunteer&quot; advisor to White House trade director Peter Navarro on the subject of the coronavirus pandemic. He interacted directly with senior officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the White House, and he represented the administration in dealings with health care companies. Early in the pandemic he urged Navarro to quickly acquire tests and supplies, although he said such supplies should come only from U.S. sources. In an email to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows he said the president was being &quot;grossly misadvised&quot; by the White House Coronavirus Task Force, and recommended that the virus should be fought by widespread proactive administration of hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug which the FDA had declared ineffective and potentially harmful to use for coronavirus. He repeatedly attacked Anthony Fauci and FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn, at one point telling Fauci that he was &quot;full of crap&quot;. Although the two were not removed from the task force as he urged, they were increasingly sidelined by Donald Trump.

Following the November 2020 election, Hatfill became an active participant in Trump&#x27;s efforts to overturn the election results, flying to Arizona to help challenge its election results, writing proposals for &quot;Trump&#x27;s Legal Fight&quot;, and sharing anti-Biden rumors. According to House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) who chairs the House Select subcommittee investigating the COVID-19 crisis, &quot;Dr. Hatfill has refused to provide documents and misleadingly downplayed his involvement in the pandemic response in communications with Select Subcommittee staff&quot;.

<doc id="860574" wikidata="Q5343297" url="?curid=860574" title="Edward Hand">
<text>Edward Hand (31 December 1744 – 3 September 1802) was an Irish-born American military officer and politician who served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, rising to the rank of general, and later was a member of several Pennsylvania governmental bodies.

==Early life and career==
Hand was born in Clyduff, King&#x27;s County (now County Offaly), Kingdom of Ireland, on 31 December 1744, and was baptised in Shinrone. His father was John Hand. Among his immediate neighbours were the Kearney family, ancestors of U.S. President Barack Obama. He was a descendant of either the families of Mag Fhlaithimh (of south Ulaidh and Mide) or Ó Flaithimhín (of the Síol Muireadaigh) who, through mistranslation (&quot;Flaithimh&quot;/&quot;Flaithimhín&quot; into &quot;Láimhín&quot;; &quot;laimh&quot; = &quot;hand&quot;), became Lavin or Hand.

Hand earned a medical certificate from Trinity College, Dublin. In 1767, Hand enlisted as a Surgeon&#x27;s Mate in the 18th (Royal Irish) Regiment of Foot. On 20 May 1767, he sailed with the regiment from Cobh, Cork, Ireland, arriving at Philadelphia on 11 July 1767. In 1772, he was commissioned an ensign. He marched with the regiment to Fort Pitt, on the forks of the Ohio River, returning to Philadelphia in 1774, where he resigned his commission.

In 1774, Hand moved to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he practiced medicine. On 13 March 1775, he married Katherine Ewing (born 25 March 1751 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania). Lancaster was the region of some of the earliest Irish and Scots-Irish settlements in Pennsylvania. Hand was active in forming the Lancaster County Associators, a colonial militia.

Hand was a 32nd degree Freemason, belonging to the Montgomery Military Lodge number 14.

==American Revolution==
Hand entered the Continental Army in 1775 as a lieutenant colonel in the 1st Pennsylvania Regiment under Colonel William Thompson. He was promoted to colonel in 1776 and placed in command of the 1st Continental (then designated the 1st Pennsylvania). 

Promoted to brigadier general in March 1777, he served as the commander of Fort Pitt, fighting British loyalists and their Indian allies. In early 1778, Hand led an expedition into the Ohio country to capture a small British magazine on the Cuyahoga River near Lake Erie, which could be used to supply Native American nations who had allied with the British, such as the Wyandot and the Shawnee. However, failing to distinguish among Native American groups, the unruly militiamen under Hand&#x27;s command attacked the neutral Lenape village of Kuskusky, killing the mother, brother, and a child of Chief Hopocan, known as Captain Pipe. The expedition became derisively known as the Squaw Campaign. Hand was later recalled after serving over a year at Fort Pitt (June 1777 to August 1778), to command a brigade in Major General La Fayette&#x27;s division. 

Planning for a campaign against the Iroquois was already under way, and Hand’s frontier experience naturally recommended him as a participant. In the resulting Sullivan-Clinton Iroquois Expedition (May-November 1779) through the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes regions of New York, Edward Hand commanded the Third Brigade, composed of the Fourth and Eleventh Pennsylvania Regiments, the German Regiment, Proctor’s Artillery, Captain James Parr’s Riflemen, Captain Anthony Selin’s Riflemen, and two Wyoming companies. The brigade composed the “Light Corps” of Sullivan’s army and formed its vanguard. The journals kept by the officers on the expedition indicate that Hand played a major role in the success of the campaign. When he rejoined his family in Lancaster at the close of the year he was thirty-five years old, the youngest of the brigadiers.

After a few months, he was appointed Adjutant General of the Continental Army and served during the siege of Yorktown in that capacity. In recognition of his long and distinguished service, he was, in September 1783, promoted by brevet to major general. He resigned from the Army in November 1783.

He was an original member of the Society of the Cincinnati.

==After the Revolution==

Hand returned to Lancaster and resumed the practice of medicine. A Federalist, Hand was active in civil affairs, holding posts that included:
* Chief Burgess of Lancaster
* Presidential elector
* Delegate to the convention for the 1790 Pennsylvania Constitution
* Member of the Congress of the Confederation, 1784–1785
* Member of the Pennsylvania Assembly, 1785–1786

Beginning in 1785, he owned and operated Rock Ford plantation, a farm on the banks of the Conestoga River, one mile (1.6 km) south of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The Georgian brick mansion remains today; the farm is a historic site open to the public. Hand was also an enslaver, owning several enslaved people, one of whom, Frank, ran away in 1802. 

Hand is suspected to have died from typhoid, dysentery or pneumonia at Rock Ford in 1802. Medical records are unclear, but some sources state Hand died of cholera. There is no evidence Lancaster County suffered from a cholera epidemic in 1802. Hand is buried in St. James&#x27;s Episcopal Cemetery in Lancaster, the same church where he had served as a deacon.

<text>Gerónimo Pedro Knight Caraballo (September 30, 1921 – February 3, 2007) was a Cuban musician, and the husband and manager of singer Celia Cruz.

==Early life==
Pedro Knight Caraballo was born in Cuba September 30, 1921.

==Career==
Knight was a trained trumpeter, and a &quot;powerfully expressive&quot; musician, according to Sue Stewart of &quot;The Guardian&quot;. At age 23, he joined the Havana-based, Afro-Cuban conjunto band, La Sonora Matancera (&quot;the sound of Matanzas&quot;, a port with a large black population), that produced, highly rhythmic dance music rooted in traditional, Africa-based styles of son and guaracha, as revived decades later by the Buena Vista Social Club. The key to the band&#x27;s sound relied on trumpets, percussion, Cuban guitar, double bass, voices, and piano. At the time, Havana was emerging as one of the world&#x27;s most popular musical nightspots. By the 1950s the band&#x27;s sophisticated arrangements and live radio performances had become part of the golden age of Cuban music, having appeared alongside American singers such as Nat King Cole and Sarah Vaughan.
In 1950, the band&#x27;s leader, Rogelio Martínez, invited Celia Cruz, who had gained popularity for her radio performances and for breaking the color barrier with the sexy song and dance act Las Mulatas de Fuego at the Tropicana, to join the band. Over the course of six or seven years, she and Knight gradually became good friends, though she resisted his romantic advances because she feared a relationship with Knight, whom she knew enjoyed casual relationships with women and had five children at that point, would not work out.

In July 1960, a year and a half after Fidel Castro came to power, La Sonora Matancera went to Mexico City to accept a two-year touring contract, but Martínez announced during a radio interview that he had no intention of returning to Cuba, a stance in which the rest of the band joined him. After 18 months, the band accepted a long-term contract at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles, which entitled them to American residencies. By then, Cruz fell in love with Knight, and the couple moved to New York, where they married on July 14, 1962, after Knight abandoned his own music to become Cruz&#x27;s manager, and the couple were inseparable. Commenting on their relationship, Cruz said, &quot;Pedro is my 50%. I am the one that sings, but he takes care of everything else.&quot;

In 1963, after pressure from New York&#x27;s salsa label, Fania, Knight agreed for Cruz to produce the album &quot;Celia y Johnny&quot; with musician/producer Johnny Pacheco, which began a lifelong friendship between the collaborators, and continued success for Cruz, including tours of six continents for the band in the 1970s and 1980s. By the mid-1990s, Cruz was an international star, and incorporated Knight into her performances, clasping him to her and referring to him as &quot;Mi cabecita de algodon&quot; (&quot;my little cottonhead&quot;) because of his halo of snow-white hair, and white mutton-chops. At home in Queens, New York, and later in Fort Lee, New Jersey, however, Cruz said she was a conventional Latina wife, performing errands such as cooking for him.

In early 2005, he attended the opening of an exhibition dedicated to Cruz at Washington&#x27;s Smithsonian Museum. He worked on a biography and CD releases, but complications from years of diabetes began to take their toll on Knight, beginning with a mild stroke and then another more serious seizure in February 2006, the effects of which were exacerbated by family feuding over Cruz&#x27;s fortune, though the lawsuits would be withdrawn due to Knight&#x27;s dementia.

==Death==
Knight died on February 3, 2007, at age 85 of diabetes and other ailments. He is survived by their daughter, Ernestina Knight, and his other four children Emilia, Gladys, Pedro and Roberto, who remained in Cuba. He is buried with Cruz in the mausoleum he built for them in 2003.

<doc id="860584" wikidata="Q13643944" url="?curid=860584" title="List of Germanic and Latinate equivalents in English">
<text>This list contains Germanic elements of the English language which have a close corresponding Latinate form. The correspondence is semantic—in most cases these words are not cognates, but in some cases they are doublets, i.e., ultimately derived from the same root, generally Proto-Indo-European, as in &quot;cow&quot; and &quot;beef,&quot; both ultimately from PIE *gʷōus.

The meanings of these words do not always correspond to Germanic cognates, and occasionally the specific meaning in the list is unique to English.

Those Germanic words listed below with a Frankish source mostly came into English through Anglo-Norman, and so despite ultimately deriving from Proto-Germanic, came to English through a Romance language (and many have cognates in modern Romance languages). This results in some Germanic doublets, such as &quot;yard&quot; and &quot;garden&quot;, through Anglo-Saxons and Anglo-Normans respectively.

<doc id="860590" wikidata="Q2116552" url="?curid=860590" title="Goniatite">
<text>Goniatids, informally goniatites, are ammonoid cephalopods that form the order Goniatitida, derived from the more primitive Agoniatitida during the Middle Devonian some 390 million years ago (around Eifelian stage). Goniatites (goniatitids) survived the Late Devonian extinction to flourish during the Carboniferous and Permian only to become extinct at the end of the Permian some 139 million years later.

== Morphology ==

All goniatites possessed an external shell, which is divided internally into chambers filled with gas giving it buoyancy during the life of the animal. An open chamber at the front of the shell provided living space for the goniatitid animal, with access to open water through a ventral siphuncle. 
The general morphology and habit of goniatites was probably similar to that of their later relatives the ammonites, being free swimming and possessing a head with two well developed eyes and arms (or tentacles).

Goniatite shells are small to medium in size, almost always less than in diameter and often smaller than in diameter. The shell is always planispirally coiled, unlike those of Mesozoic ammonites in which some are trochoidal and even aberrant (called heteromorphs). Goniatitid shells vary in form from thinly discoidal to broadly globular and may be smooth or distinctly ornamented. Their shape suggests many were poor swimmers.

The thin walls between the internal chambers of the shell are called the &quot;septa&quot;, and as the goniatite grew it would move its body forward in the shell secreting septa behind it, thereby adding new chambers to the shell. The &quot;sutures&quot; (or suture lines) are visible as a series of narrow, wavy lines on the surface of the shell. The sutures appear where each septa contacts the wall of the outer shell.

The typical goniatitid has a suture with smooth saddles and lobes, which gives the name &quot;goniatitic&quot; to this particular suture pattern. In some the sutures have a distinctive &quot;zigzag&quot; pattern. Not all goniatitid ammonoides have goniatitic sutures. In some the sutures are ceratitic, in others, even ammonitic. Nor are goniatitic sutures limited to the Goniatidia. 
The sutures of nautiloids are by comparison somewhat simpler, being either straight or slightly curved, whereas later ammonoids showed suture patterns of increasing complexity. One explanation for this increasing extravagancy in suture pattern is that it leads to a higher strength of the shell.

== Ecology ==

Ecologically, goniatites were limited to environments of normal-marine salinity—as appears to be the case for all cephalopods throughout their history. Goniatites are much more abundant and speciose in sediments that represent epicontinental seas than they are in those that represent the open ocean. Within these inland seas, goniatites&#x27; greatest abundance and diversity appears to have been achieved in deeper offshore and basinal environments rather than in nearshore environments. Known nearshore (e.g., lagoonal) occurrences have generally been ascribed to wash-in of shells from offshore waters.

Due to lack of strong evidence for any particular life mode (e.g., benthic, nektonic, and planktonic), it remains unclear what resources goniatites were capitalizing on in these offshore environments. Only a few goniatites&#x27; full apparatuses have ever been described, and reports of stomach contents in these creatures&#x27; fossils remain questionable at best. However, goniatites clearly lacked the calcified jaw apparatuses developed in later ammonites; this has been cited as evidence against their having a durophagous (shell-crushing) diet.

== Distribution ==

Goniatites are found in North America, Europe, North Africa and Australasia where they are used as index fossils in age determination and stratigraphic correlation. However, they seem to occur mostly in areas which at the time would have been tropical to subtropical. Almost any fossil-bearing limestone or shale from inland seas of the late Paleozoic tropics or subtropics is likely to yield some goniatites. In the USA, such rocks are found from Maine, New York, and Virginia and in every state west to Nebraska and south to Texas and Alabama; as well as in parts of almost every western state (with the exception of North Dakota, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii).

Notable goniatite occurrences are found in certain limestones in western part of Ireland (particularly Slieve Anierin) which are packed with beautifully preserved goniatite fossils. They are also found in marine bands of the Carboniferous coal measures in Europe and in marine rocks of the Pennsylvanian period in Arkansas. Large numbers of goniatites also occur in rocks from the Devonian period of Morocco.

<text>Tegel () is a locality (&quot;Ortsteil&quot;) in the Berlin borough of Reinickendorf on the shore of Lake Tegel. The Tegel locality, the second largest in area (after Köpenick) of the 96 Berlin districts, also includes the neighbourhood of &quot;Saatwinkel&quot;.

==History==
The Tegel Palace (or Humboldt Palace), originally a Renaissance manor house from 1558 and a hunting lodge of Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg, was bequeathed to the Humboldt family in 1797. Alexander von Humboldt and Wilhelm von Humboldt lived here for several years. In 1824 Wilhelm had the palace rebuilt in a Neoclassical style by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. In the park is a tomb, where Alexander, Wilhelm, and other members of the Humboldt family are buried. From 1927 until 1931 Tegel Palace was the site of a sanatorium, founded by the psychoanalyst Ernst Simmel (1882–1947).

From 1898 on Tegel was the seat of the &quot;Borsig-Werke&quot; steam locomotive manufacturing company until it moved to Hennigsdorf in Brandenburg in 1931.

Between 1930 and 1934 an artillery firing range in the district was used by the &quot;Verein für Raumschiffahrt&quot; (Society for Space Travel) for experiments with liquid-fueled rockets. The principal names involved were its leader Rudolf Nebel and other staff members Hermann Oberth and Wernher von Braun.

During World War II, Tegel was the location of a subcamp of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, and a Nazi prison with several forced labour subcamps in the region.

Tegel was the site of a medium wave broadcasting station from 1933 to 1948. A wire hung in a wooden tower served as an antenna. This tower was demolished as part of the construction of Tegel International Airport at the end of 1948.

==Today==
Tegel is chiefly known for being the location of Berlin-Tegel &quot;Otto Lilienthal&quot;, Berlin&#x27;s former main airport. It has a population of 33,417 and houses the Tegel Prison, one of Germany&#x27;s largest prisons with about 1,700 inmates as of 2007, known from Alfred Döblin&#x27;s 1929 novel Berlin Alexanderplatz.

One of Berlin&#x27;s largest shopping malls &quot;Borsighallen&quot; is located in the former locomotive manufacturing halls of the &quot;Borsigwerke&quot;. There is also the &quot;Villa Borsig&quot; at the shore of Lake Tegel, the former residence of the Borsig family. Today it is a school for future diplomats.

Besides this, Tegel is an extensive residential district with some industry. With the large Lake Tegel, set in woodlands, the locality is also a popular destination for daytrippers. It boasts Berlin&#x27;s oldest tree, an oak called &quot;Dicke Marie&quot; (&quot;Fat Mary&quot;).

==Transportation==
Tegel is served by the Berlin S-Bahn line S25 at the station &quot;Berlin-Tegel&quot;. U-Bahn connection to the inner city is provided by the U6 line with the stations &quot;Otisstraße&quot;, &quot;Holzhauser Straße&quot;, &quot;Borsigwerke&quot; and &quot;Alt-Tegel&quot;.

<text>Frohnau () is a locality in the Reinickendorf borough of Berlin, Germany. It lies in the extreme northern part of the city. Frohnau is an affluent area characterized by many patrician villas from the early 20th century.

==History==
Founded in 1910, Frohnau was created whole as a planned community, corresponding to the early twentieth-century idea of a garden city. Frohnau was founded in the Stolper Heath, which had been bought for the Berlin Terrain Commission by Count Guido Henckel von Donnersmarck in 1907. The competition for the design was won by a plan developed by Joseph Brix and Felix Genzmer. Their concept represented an asymmetrical, seemingly natural development out of the dunes near the Havel River. Even the name &quot;Frohnau&quot; was determined by a contest. In 1920, Frohnau was annexed into the Greater Berlin city-state. During World War II, in early 1945, a death march of prisoners of various nationalities from the dissolved camp in Żabikowo to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp passed through the neighborhood.

During the Cold War, it was part of West Berlin.

==Architectures==

The natural center of the city has always been the train station and the nearby buildings. The casino tower serves as the symbol of Frohnau. The entire area is noted for its large mansion-like buildings.

The architects responsible for the typical mansions include Walter and Johannes Krüger (the Church of St. John), Hart and Lesser (train station and casino tower), Max Meyer (Buddhist house), Paul Poser, Max Scheidling, and Heinrich Straumer (better known for his work on Berlin&#x27;s radio tower, &quot;Funkturm&quot;).

Frohnau includes one of the tallest buildings in Germany: The &quot;Richtfunkmast&quot; (microwave radio tower) measures 358.6 m (1177 ft) in height and was built between 1977 and 1979. Until German reunification, this was the means for keeping microwave radio contact with West Germany. The receiving tower on the West German side was in Gartow, Lower Saxony. Alongside the &quot;Richtfunkmast&quot; is a 117 m (384 ft) free-standing steel framework tower, which is dwarfed in comparison. This was built between 1970 and 1973, and had 18 m (66 ft) diameter parabolic antennae to enable radio connection beyond the horizon to Lower Saxony until 1995. Since 2002 mediumwave digital radio transmissions have been tested in Frohnau at 1485 kHz. Since neither the &quot;Richtfunkmast&quot; nor the parabolic antenna tower was intended for mediumwave transmissions, an additional 10 m (33 ft) long-wire antenna was installed.

<text>Belemnoids are an extinct group of marine cephalopod, very similar in many ways to the modern squid. Like them, the belemnoids possessed an ink sac, but, unlike the squid, they possessed ten arms of roughly equal length, and no tentacles. The name &quot;belemnoid&quot; comes from the Greek word βέλεμνον, &quot;belemnon&quot; meaning &quot;a dart or arrow&quot; and the Greek word είδος, &quot;eidos&quot; meaning &quot;form&quot;.

Belemnoids include belemnites (which belong to the order Belemnitida), aulacocerids (order Aulacocerida), phragmoteuthids (order Phragmoteuthida), and diplobelids (order Diplobelida). Belemnoidea has been suggested to be paraphyletic by some authors.

==Occurrence==
Belemnoids were numerous during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, and their fossils are abundant in Mesozoic marine rocks, often accompanying their cousins the ammonites. The belemnoids become extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period along with the ammonites. The belemnoids&#x27; origin lies within the bactritoid nautiloids, which date from the Devonian period; well-formed belemnoid guards can be found in rocks dating from the Mississippian (or Early Carboniferous) onward through the Cretaceous. Other fossil cephalopods include baculites, nautiloids and goniatites.

==Anatomy==
Belemnoids possessed a central rostrom/guard made of aragonite and with negative buoyancy. To the rear of the creature was a heavy calcite guard whose main role appears to have been to counterbalance the front (towards the head) of the organism; it positions the centre of mass below the centre of buoyancy, increasing the stability of the swimming organism. The guard would account for between a third and a fifth of the length of the complete organism, arms included.

Like some modern squid, belemnoid arms carried a series of small hooks for grabbing prey. Belemnoids were efficient carnivores that caught small fish and other marine animals with their arms and ate them with their beak-like jaws. In turn, belemnites appear to have formed part of the diet of marine reptiles such as Ichthyosaurs, whose fossilized stomachs frequently contain phosphatic hooks from the arms of cephalopods.

==Ecology==
Belemnoids were effectively neutrally buoyant, and swam in near-shore to mid-shelf oceans. Their fins could be used to their advantage in all water speeds; in a gentle current they could be flapped for propulsion; in a stronger current they could be held erect to generate lift; and when swimming rapidly by jet propulsion they could be tucked in to the body for streamlining.

==Preservation==

Normally with fossil belemnoids only the back part of the shell (called the &quot;guard&quot; or &quot;rostrum&quot;) is found. The guard is usually elongated and bullet-shaped (though in some subgroups the rostrum may only exist as a thin layer coating the phragmocone). The hollow region at the front of the guard is termed the &quot;alveolus&quot;, and this houses a chambered conical-shaped part of the shell (called the &quot;phragmocone&quot;). The phragmocone is usually only found with the better preserved specimens. Projecting forwards from one side of the phragmocone is the thin &quot;pro-ostracum&quot;.

While belemnoid phragmocones are homologous with the shells of other cephalopods and are similarly composed of aragonite, belemnoid guards are evolutionarily novel and are composed of calcite or aragonite, thus tending to preserve well. Broken guards show a structure of radiating calcite fibers and may also display concentric growth rings.

Diagenetic modifications of the shells are complex. Radiating calcitic crystals are thin, or very large, with a shape indicative of a strong alteration. In other samples, the aragonite - calcite boundary is not dependent on growth lines. In a given fossil sites, some specimens are calcite, others are aragonite.

The guard, phragmocone and pro-ostracum were all internal to the living creature, forming a skeleton which was enclosed entirely by soft muscular tissue. The original living creature would have been larger than the fossilized shell, with a long streamlined body and prominent eyes. The guard would have been in place toward the rear of the creature, with the phragmocone behind the head and the pointed end of the guard facing backward.

The guard of the belemnoid &quot;Megateuthis gigantea&quot;, which is found in Europe and Asia, can measure up to in length, giving the living animal an estimated length of .

Very exceptional belemnoid specimens have been found showing the preserved soft parts of the animal. Elsewhere in the fossil record, bullet-shaped belemnite guards are locally found in such profusion that such deposits are referred to semi-formally as &quot;belemnite battlefields&quot; (cf. &quot;orthocone orgies&quot;). It remains unclear whether these deposits represent post-mating mass death events, as are common among modern cephalopods and other semelparous creatures.

===Thunderstones===
The name &quot;thunderbolt&quot; or &quot;thunderstone&quot; has also been traditionally applied to the fossilised rostra of belemnoids. The origin of these bullet-shaped stones was not understood, and thus a mythological explanation of stones created where lightning struck has arisen.

==Uses==
The stable isotope composition of a belemnoid rostrum from the Peedee Formation (Cretaceous, southeast USA) has long been used as a global standard (Peedee Belemnite, &quot;PDB&quot;) against which other isotope geochemistry samples are measured, for both carbon isotopes and oxygen isotopes.

Some belemnoids (such as &quot;Belemnites&quot; of Belemnitida) serve as index fossils, particularly in the Cretaceous Chalk Formation of Europe, enabling geologists to date the age the rocks in which they are found.

<text>Britz () is a German locality (&quot;Ortsteil&quot;) within the Berlin borough (&quot;Bezirk&quot;) of Neukölln.

==History==
The village of &quot;Britzig&quot; was first mentioned in 1273. It was incorporated by the 1920 Greater Berlin Act. It is known for being the site of the &quot;Hufeisensiedlung&quot; (&quot;Horseshoe Estate&quot;), part of the UNESCO Berlin Modernism Housing Estates World Heritage Site since 2008.

==Public transport==
Britz is served by the U7 (Berlin U-Bahn) traveling North / South from and to the terminus at Rudow (Berlin U-Bahn).

==Sights==
*Village church with foundation walls from the 13th century
*Schloss Britz (Britz Manor), rebuilt in 1883, former residence of Prussian statesman Ewald Friedrich von Hertzberg
*Britz windmill built in 1866
*Britzer Garten, site of the 1985 Bundesgartenschau

===Hufeisensiedlung===

The subsidized housing estate was built on the fields of Britz manor between 1925 and 1933 according to plans by Bruno Taut and Martin Wagner. The project was initiated by a housing cooperative established to combat the shortage of affordable living space. Numerous blocks and terraced houses in New Objectivity style with colorful facades include more than 1,000 apartments, situated in spacious gardens designed by landscape architect Leberecht Migge.

===Transmission facility===

The transmission facility of the newly founded RIAS - present-day Deutschlandradio - was built on a site in Britz in 1946 by the American military administration. Several temporary structures were replaced in 1948 with the current, 100-metre high steel masts. These were later extended to heights of 160 m and 144 m.

Short-wave transmissions were made from Britz starting in 1949. In 1978 a medium-wave transmission aerial was added to allow better reception across the whole of the GDR&#x27;s territory, especially at night.

=== Blub ===
The disused Blub (&quot;Berliner Luft- und Badeparadies&quot;) water park is situated in Britz, near the Teltow Canal. It has become a site of interest to those interested in ruined architecture. It is due for redevelopment in the near future.

<text>The Müggelturm (“Müggel Tower”) is a popular day-trip destination in Köpenick, in southeastern Berlin, Germany. It is located to the south of the Müggelsee lake in the Müggelberg hills atop the &quot;Kleiner Müggelberg&quot; (“Small Müggelhill”). Berlin&#x27;s highest natural elevation is the nearby &quot;Großer Müggelberg&quot; at 115 m.

== Access ==
The Müggelturm area can be reached from the former &quot;Marienlust&quot; restaurant to the south at the River Dahme via a footpath ending in a stairway (374 steps), or from lake &quot;Müggelssee&quot; in the northeast up another stairway (111 steps). From the street Müggelheimer Damm there is a road leading to the tower (named &quot;Straße zum Müggelturm&quot;), but cars must be left at a parking lot a few hundred metres before the plateau.

== The early towers ==
In 1880, Carl Spindler, owner of the Köpenick laundry and dyeworks W. Spindler (and source of the name of the Berlin district &quot;Spindlersfeld&quot;), had a 10 m high wooden lookout tower, known as the &quot;Spindlerturm&quot;, built on the&quot; Kleiner Müggelberg&quot;. Because of its low height there was not much of a view and it accordingly attracted few visitors. In 1889 Spinder spent 40,000 marks to extend the tower, now 27 metres high, and choosing an architecture reminiscent of a pagoda, It opened to the public on 1 April 1890 and had a quadratic base of 5 m per side tapering to 4.2 m above the restaurant and 2.8 m at the viewing platform. This tower was also a wooden construction and had a shingled facing. The architect was Max Jacob; and the first restaurant manager was Carl Streichhahn. The enlarged tower and its restaurant rapidly became a popular excursion destination. From the platform at the top a panoramic view extended as far as 50 km on clear days and included the region&#x27;s forest and lake landscape and the Berlin skyline. There were some 52,000 visitors already in its first year of operation.

In 1924 the architect Walter Wichelhaus purchased the tower and in the following years carried out structural improvements on the &quot;Kleiner Müggelberg&quot;. He constructed several buildings which included a new restaurant, a kitchen, and an apartment for himself. During excavation work for these new outbuildings prehistoric relicts were found. In 1926 a new terrace with a large hall at the side was built in front of the tower. Here Wichelhaus and the Märkisches Museum displayed a collection entitled “Geschichte des Müggellandes und der Müggelberge” (“History of the Müggel Area and the Müggel Hills”) with prehistoric artifacts from the Müggel region. Visitors could learn something about the culture of the local inhabitants during the stone age, Bronze Age and Iron Age, as well as about the Sprewanen, a Wendish tribe which lived in the Dahme-Spree region. A famous exhibit item was a molar from a mammoth. Another part of the exhibit provided the evidence that there was formerly a large hall on the &quot;Kleiner Müggelberg&quot; which probably served as a place of ritual worship for the Sprewanen. In 1928 two stairways were constructed up the &quot;Kleiner Müggelberg&quot;. In 1942 the museum&#x27;s artifacts were moved to the &quot;Schmetterlingshorst&quot; restaurant, where they could be viewed there together with the world-famous butterfly collection of the restaurant&#x27;s owner, Büttner. Both collections were destroyed in bombing raids during World War II.

In 1945 as the Soviet army approached Berlin the tower was declared a military object and used as a radio transmission tower as well as an observation post for artillery units. As was the case with the Bismarck vantage point on the neighboring &quot;Großer Müggelberg&quot;, the Müggel tower was to be blown up by German troops before the arrival of the advancing Soviet army. The tower restaurant proprietor Walter Wichelhaus prevented this destruction by cutting the electrical cable leading to the explosives.

After the war a restaurant was again provided for visitors, and in 1956 HO Köpenick took over operation of the Müggel Tower grounds. In January 1957 the Müggel Tower was closed because its dilapidated state made it unsafe; the following month the Berlin magistrate decided to stabilize the tower with a new foundation and the addition of a steel truss construction. As part of this work the restaurant was to be enlarged, but on the afternoon of 19 May 1958 the tower burned down completely, the probable cause being welding activities during the renovation.

== Today’s tower ==
That same year the &quot;Berliner Zeitung&quot; launched an architectural competition for a new construction, which attracted 32 designs. These were exhibited to the public in August 1958 in the Köpenick city hall and a month later in the newspaper&#x27;s pavilion at the &quot;Friedrichstraße&quot; train station. The opinions expressed by visitors in a book made available for the purpose confirmed the choice of the jurors. The proposal by a student collective from the &quot;Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißensee&quot; headed by Jörg Streitparth, Siegfried Wagner and Klaus Weißhaupt won the competition and after modification it formed the basis of the new construction. An oval ground plan was originally intended for the tower, but this was changed to today&#x27;s quadratic form for reasons of cost.

The foundation stone was laid on 6 October 1959 and on 20 August 1960 the topping out ceremony was celebrated. The tower was opened on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 31 December 1961. The construction of the new Müggel Tower was significantly supported by public involvement and donations. As part of the German Democratic Republic&#x27;s initiative calling for voluntary, charitable work (“Nationale Aufbauwerk”), the public contributed 130,000 Marks and 3,700 hours of work.

The 29.61 m high tower of reinforced concrete has nine storeys with panorama windows and a platform which can be reached via 126 steps. Along with its auxiliary buildings it reflects a modern approach in contrast to the eclecticism of the previous construction and is an early example of DDR architecture in the style of socialist classicism. The gastronomy area includes a restaurant, a wine tavern and sun terraces. The new tower again became a centre of attraction for Berlin&#x27;s populace, with an average of 240,000 visitors annually. Especially on holidays such as Pentecost there were large crowds in the tower and gastronomy area. A lack of maintenance effort continues to plague the area. In 1996 the tower itself was fully renovated with EU financing amounting to one million DM, but more work remains to be done.

In a restaurant flower window can be found the triangulation point “1st order Müggelberg,” which is important for Berlin and German geodesy as it defines the zero point of the coordinate network for Berlin topographical maps. The stone is also a memorial to Johann Jacob Baeyer (1794–1885) who was born in Müggelheim and is known for his role in determining central European longitude and latitude degree coordinates. He also used the Müggelberg hills along with measurements of the city of Berlin to determine the elevation of the immediate surroundings, such as the height of Köpenick&#x27;s St. Laurentius church and the Gosener mountains. Since the stone and its precise location as a surveying point is protected, it cannot be moved without the consent of the Berlin Senate (&quot;Senatsverwaltung für Stadtentwicklung&quot;).

== The situation after 1990 and new utilization concepts ==
In 1995 the city of Berlin became owner of the area and the district of Köpenick has administered it ever since. In the same year the building on the &quot;Kleiner Müggelberg&quot; received the status of a listed monument. Since 2000 a number of invitations to tender have been issued in a search for an investor to develop and maintain the area. Proposals included construction of a hotel, a restaurant, and renovation of the water and power supplies, but none were accepted for various reasons. In 2007 the property was sold to an investor from Krefeld.

Tsubata has four town mascots: Yoshinaka-kun (よしなかくん), Tomoe-chan (ともえちゃん), Ka-kun (カーくん) and Mo-chan (モーちゃん). They are modeled after a possibly fictional battle that took place in the hills that lie between what are now Tsubata and Oyabe in Toyama. During the Genpei War between the Genji and Heike clans in 12th century), Genji general Kiso Yoshinaka is said to have defeated a large Heike army by driving bulls with flaming torches attached to their horns (カーくん and モーちゃん) into the enemy camp in the dead of night, causing the Heike to panic and flee. The battle is called the Battle of Kurikara. Tomoe Gozen was one of Yoshinaka&#x27;s wives and a female samurai.

The town crest is a stylized rendition of the characters for “Tsuba” (written in katakana as ツバ). The shape of a flying bird signifies Tsubata&#x27;s soaring industrial and cultural development, while the figure in the center, its feet firmly planted on the earth, represents stability. The circle represents harmony and peace.

The town logo is warm and soft, expressing Tsubata&#x27;s familiarity and friendliness. Overlaying the brightly shining sun, “1-2-3” (the English word “sun” sounds like the Japanese word for the number three, “san”) signifies Tsubata&#x27;s progress. Beneath the words are three lines. The green like symbolizes the richness of the greenery that grows throughout Tsubata. The dark blue line represents Tsubata&#x27;s bright blue sky, while the light blue line stands for the pure water that Tsubata&#x27;s rich natural environment provides.

<text>The Berlin-Müggelberge TV tower is the 31 metre tall base of a tower, never completed, in the Müggel hills of southeast Berlin, Germany. The tower base is currently used as radio relay link station.

The tower was originally planned as the TV tower for Berlin. It was to have a total height of with an observation platform at .

After construction was started in 1954, a survey indicated that the tower would endanger aircraft on approach to the Berlin-Schoenefeld airport. For this reason, on 13 December 1955 construction was stopped.

The tower base was later used by the East German Ministry for State Security (&quot;Ministerium für Staatssicherheit&quot; or &quot;Stasi&quot;) as a listening post.

Today it serves the Deutsche Telekom AG as radio relay link station and has a radar dome on its top.

Close to the tower, there is a 64 metre tall lattice tower with aerials for non-public mobile radio services and directional antennas.

The Berlin-Müggelberge TV tower is not accessible to the public and is not to be confused with the Berlin-Müggelberge look-out, known as the Müggelturm (Müggel tower), which is publicly accessible.

<doc id="860625" wikidata="Q432027" url="?curid=860625" title="Uchinada, Ishikawa">
<text>is a town located in Kahoku District, Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. , the town had an estimated population of 26,811 in 10783 households, and a population density of 1300 persons per km2. The total area of the town was .

==Geography==
Uchinada is located near the middle of Ishikawa Prefecture, bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west, the city of Kanazawa to the south and the city of Kahoku to the north. Uchinada sits in a typical seaside sand-dune environment, lacking any major mountains or rivers, with an average elevation of 20 meters. The highest point of elevation reaches 58.51 meters, with a dynamic landscape formed by the constant forming and reforming of sand dunes, both new and old. It is a suburb of Kanazawa, the capital of Ishikawa Prefecture. The town has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by mild summers and cold winters with heavy snowfall. The average annual temperature in Uchinada is 14.3 °C. The average annual rainfall is 2534 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.9 °C, and lowest in January, at around 3.2 °C.

*Ishikawa Prefecture
**Kahoku
**Kanazawa
**Tsubata

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Uchinada nearly doubled in the 1970s and has remained relatively stable in recent decades.
==History==
Remains of earthenware pots found in the sand dunes of Uchinada reveal the existence of humans living in the area since the Jōmon period. The area around Uchinada was mostly part of ancient Kaga Province. The area became part of Kaga Domain under the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate. Following the Meiji restoration, the area was organised into Kahoku District, Ishikawa. The village of Uchinada was founded on April 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. It was rated to town status on January 1, 1952.

Uchinada became the center of the first large-scale protest movement against one of the US military bases that remained in Japan even after the end of the US Military Occupation of Japan. The movement arose in protest against the construction of an artillery range to train United States Army units during the Korean War. Nationwide sympathy was aroused by the perceived danger to the natural ecosystem of the Uchinada sand dunes. Activists from around Japan joined the protests, and the &quot;Uchinada Incident&quot; helped launch a nationwide anti-base movement. Ultimately, the protest movement, which lasted from 1952 to 1953, failed to stop the opening of the range. The artillery range opened in March 1953, and was turned over to the Japanese government in 1957.

==Economy==
Commercial fishing was formerly a mainstay of the local economy, followed by the industrial fiber industry, and agriculture. The town is increasingly a bedroom community for Kanazawa.

==Education==
Uchinada has six public elementary schools and one public middle school operated by the town government as of April 2018. The town has one public high school operated by the Ishikawa Prefectural Board of Education. Kanazawa Medical University is also located in Uchinada.

The area around Shika was part of ancient Noto Province. During the Sengoku Period (1467–1568), the area was contested between the Hatakeyama clan, Uesugi clan and Maeda clan, with the area becoming part of Kaga Domain under the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate. Following the Meiji restoration, the area was organised into Hakui District, Ishikawa, and the village of Shika was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Shika was raised to town status on February 1, 1936. On September 1, 2005, the former town of Togi was annexed by Shika.

On January 9, 2015, a resident reported a wooden boat to the local police, which was washed up on the shore. Due to Hangul characters on the boat it was suspected to be from North Korea. The police arrested one man on the boat, who claimed he had left North Korea unintended in mid-December 2014 when conducting an inspection of the boat.

== Tatsuruhama High School ==
Tatsuruhama High School has specialised Nursing and Welfare courses. Students who complete 3rd year high school (12th year of schooling) can go on to either further study in Welfare training colleges, or continue through the school&#x27;s own speciality training course (専攻) at Noto General Hospital (能登総合病院) for a further two years to become a fully qualified nurse. There is an onsite dormitory for 50 students, and the school used to be a girls-only school, but has recently opened its doors to male students also (the school&#x27;s population of male students remains fairly low).
