<text>The Buick LaCrosse is a four-door, front-wheel-drive sedan manufactured by Buick since model year 2005, and marketed variously across four generations for the North American and Chinese markets.

The first-generation LaCrosse replaced the Century and Regal in North America beginning for model year 2005 as a five- or six-passenger, four-door, front-wheel-drive, V6-powered sedan using GM&#x27;s mid-size W platform—and marketed in Canada as the Buick Allure. Notably, the first generation was also offered with a V8 engine, as a high-performance sub-model marketed as the &quot;LaCrosse Super&quot; (2008–2009). LaCrosse production and marketing began for China with model year 2006.

The second-generation LaCrosse was introduced for 2010 as a larger premium sedan for North American and Chinese markets using a long-wheelbase (LWB) variant of the Epsilon II platform shared with the Cadillac XTS—and available solely as a five-passenger sedan with a range of four- and six-cylinder engines.

The third generation was introduced for North America and China for model year 2017 using the GM Epsilon platform shared with the Chevrolet Impala, notably offering a mild hybrid powertrain combining electric and 2.5-liter Ecotec gasoline engine. North American production ended with the third generation, with model year 2019; however, it continued to be offered in China, with a 2019 facelift.

The fourth-generation LaCrosse, launched in 2023, is currently manufactured and marketed solely in China. It is powered by a turbocharged 1.5-liter or 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine.

== Background and name ==
In 2000, Buick showcased a LaCrosse concept featuring styling features that referred to Buicks of the late 1940s including a descending swage line (featured on Buicks starting in 1940 and sporadically until the 1970s) and front fender port holes. Unique features included a removable rear roof and trunk panel (converting the trunk into a truck bed) and voice recognition instead of traditional switches for basic interior functions. The Buick LaCrosse concept was based on the GM G body shared with the Buick Park Avenue.

As the Buick nameplate, the term &quot;lacrosse&quot; refers to the sport. Out of caution, GM chose to market the model in Canada as the &quot;Allure&quot; because the words &quot;faire la crosse (make the cross)&quot; are a slang Québecoise phrase meaning &quot;to masturbate&quot;—even though the words &quot;la crosse&quot; themselves translate as &quot;the cross&quot; in French and are not generally problematic.

==First generation (2005)==
===North America===

The first generation LaCrosse debuted in late 2004 as a 2005 model, replacing the Century and Regal—solely as a four-door, front-drive sedan. The nameplate was borrowed from the 2000 Buick concept of the same name.

Using the &quot;MS2000&quot; variant of GM&#x27;s long-lived front-drive W-body platform, the LaCrosse was initially available with two powerplants and three trim levels: a 3.8 L &quot;3800 Series III&quot; V6 available in CX and mid-level CXL, and a 3.6 L &quot;HFV6&quot; V6 in the CXS model. The CXS was replaced by the &quot;LaCrosse Super&quot; sub-model in North American markets, with the CXS available partly through model year 2008. Sales of the CXS continued in Canada until January 1, 2008.

Structurally, the engine cradle, previously steel, was replaced by a stiffer, stronger, and lighter extruded aluminum cradle, weighing 20 pounds less. The LaCrosse used more high-strength steel than its predecessors, as well as a magnesium cross-car beam behind the instrument panel, another cross-car beam behind the rear seats, steel reinforcements in the rocker panels, interlocking door latch system, high-strength steel door beams, and a double-thick Quiet Steel floor pan and firewalls.

CX and CXL models used the 4T65-E automatic transmission and Super models used the 4T65-E HD variant. The LaCrosse, along with all other GM vehicles powered by the 3.8 L V6, became the first SULEV-compliant vehicles for 2006. All models were manufactured at GM Oshawa Assembly. Front driver and passenger airbags were standard, with optional side curtain airbags — which became standard for model year 2006.

All LaCrosse models featured an acoustic package, marketed by Buick as &quot;QuietTuning&quot;, to reduce, block, and absorb cabin noise. Features of the system included acoustical windshield and front side laminated glass; steel laminate on the front-of-dash body area; expanded baffles in the roof pillars; melt-on sound deadeners throughout the entire lower body structure; and sound-absorbing material throughout the engine, passenger, and cargo compartments.

Buick offered the LaCrosse as a five-passenger sedan, using front bucket seats and a console-mounted shifter, the console integrating with the upper instrument panel. At extra cost, a six-passenger configuration was available where the front seats shared a center flexible console that could fold up for a sixth passenger or fold out to provide a storage console, the transmission using a column-mounted shifter.

Regarding its styling, noted automotive journalist Warren Brown described the Lacrosse as a &quot;delightful rendition of the automobile as functional art.&quot;

The final first-generation LaCrosse was manufactured on December 23, 2008. North American sales reached roughly 290,000 for model years 2005–2009, and the 2009 model was the last GM car using the company&#x27;s noted and long-lived 3800 V6 engine.

====2008 facelift====

The LaCrosse received a facelift for 2008 with the vehicle&#x27;s revised front design based on the Buick Velite concept and later used by the first generation Chinese LaCrosse.

All trim levels received a chrome exterior appearance package, factory remote start feature, XM Satellite Radio, telescoping steering wheel column, redundant steering wheel and climate control as added standard equipment (audio only post-MY 2006). CX included a leather-wrapped steering wheel, theft-deterrent system, illuminated vanity mirrors, driver information center personalization, and hydraulic struts supporting both the engine hood and trunk lid.

For the 2009 model year, the last of the first generation, heated outside rearview mirrors became standard on all models; a 60/40 split folding rear seat added to Driver Confidence Package; navigation became available via OnStar; Bluetooth became available on all models with includes integrated steering wheel controls; 16-inch painted aluminum wheel were standard on CX models and 17-inch chrome-clad wheels became available on CX models.

====LaCrosse Super (2008–2009)====

To coincide its introduction with the first generation&#x27;s MY 2008 facelift, Buick previewed the &quot;LaCrosse Super&quot; in March, 2006 in New York and again at the Buick Open in Grand Blanc, Michigan, in July 2006, presenting it formally at the 2007 New York International Auto Show—as a higher-content, higher-performance, and more exclusive LaCrosse sub-model.

Resurrecting the &quot;Super&quot; nameplate from Buick&#x27;s 1930s–1950s model, the model featured minor interior and exterior tweaks as well as a 5.3-liter, 300-hp V8 engine shared with the Pontiac Grand Prix GXP and Chevrolet Impala SS, and Monte Carlo SS—engineered under the direction of former Corvette engineer John Heinricy with the GM Performance Division. Noting that the Super would share parts with Chevrolet and Pontiac variants, Heinricy said the LaCrosse aimed to balance performance and refinement for a smoother, quieter and more grown-up demeanor.

The Super&#x27;s LS4 5.3 L V8 engine made and , used premium fuel, and featured variable displacement technology (marketed as &quot;Active Fuel Management&quot;), capable of deactivating four of its eight cylinders to save fuel. It was noted for its factory top speed of and a 0–60 mph time of 5.7 seconds.

The Super used the heavier duty &quot;4T65-E HD&quot; four-speed automatic transmission, magnetically sensitive variable-effort power steering (marketed as &quot;Magnasteer&quot;), and a steering rack with closer-fitting gear teeth, tighter bushings, and a stiffer torsion rod controlling the variable-effort power assist. Chassis tuning featured Bilstein mono-tube struts; larger rotors at all four disc brakes; full-range, powertrain- and brake-modulated traction control; revised suspension tuning with standard electronic stability control, marketed as &quot;Stabilitrak&quot;; dual exhaust with two 3.5-inch chrome tips; and 18-inch cast aluminum wheels with P235/50R18 all-season tires.

The exterior featured Buick&#x27;s hallmark fender-mounted VentiPorts; a revised front fascia incorporating the larger and more pronounced 2008 upper grille (recalling Buick&#x27;s Velite concept), lower grille chrome trim with chrome bezels for projector beam fog lights, revised side rocker moldings, a very small deck-mounted rear spoiler, and a revised rear fascia with integrated parking sensors. Exterior color choices were brown, black, red, and silver—marketed as &quot;Mocha Brown Metallic&quot;, &quot;Black Onyx&quot;, &quot;Red Jewel Tincoat&quot;, and &quot;Platinum Metallic&quot;.

Interior features included a blue-faced instrument cluster with &quot;Super&quot; badging, dark faux chestnut wood trim, enhanced front seatback bolstering, split fold-down rear seats, redundant steering wheel–mounted radio and cruise controls, leather seating surfaces with inserts embossed to mimic woven leather (marketed as &quot;Dream Weave&quot;), heated front seats, remote start, premium sound system with nine speakers (marketed as &quot;Concert III&quot;), OnStar, and optional Bluetooth wireless technology. Upholstery colors were Platinum (light beige) and Mocha Brown (dark brown).

The 2008 base price for the LaCrosse Super was $32,820 (), which rose to $33,805 for 2009. Assembled alongside other LaCrosse models at GM&#x27;s Oshawa Car Assembly Plant 2, sales reached 2,277 for 2008 and 139 for 2009.

====Safety====
The LaCrosse received a &quot;Good&quot; overall score in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety&#x27;s frontal impact crash test and a &quot;Marginal&quot; overall rating in the side impact test. Injury measurements for the side-impact crash test include a &quot;Poor&quot; mark for the driver&#x27;s torso and a &quot;Marginal&quot; score for the driver&#x27;s pelvis and leg. Side airbags are limited to the curtain type for both front and rear rows; the torso-type side airbag is unavailable. 2007 models also earned one out of five stars in a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration side-impact crash test. The IIHS also found that the 2006–08 model year LaCrosse had the second-highest fatality rate in the large four-door car class; only the Buick Lucerne fared worse.

====Models====
===China===
Shanghai GM introduced the Buick LaCrosse in February 2006, as a more upscale companion to its Buick Regal sedan. Designed by Shanghai GM&#x27;s Pan Asia Technical Automotive Center (PATAC), the Chinese LaCrosse is based on the same architecture as the North American model, with different exterior sheetmetal, interior design and available engines. The car is also manufactured in Taiwan by a joint Yulon–GM venture.
====Eco-Hybrid====
In 2008, Shanghai GM introduced a mild hybrid system on the LaCrosse. Using the Belt Alternator Starter system, it is the first hybrid vehicle in the Chinese market as well as the first hybrid in its segment.

==Second generation (2010)==
Launched at the 2009 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, the second-generation Buick LaCrosse was completely redesigned, becoming Buick&#x27;s flagship sedan.

The exterior used faux vents and a falling swage line, marketed respectively as VentiPorts and Sweepspears—and making reference to styling elements Buick had incorporated in various forms since introducing them in 1949.

The second-generation used a long-wheelbase (LWB) variant of the Epsilon II platform, shared with the Opel Insignia, 2010–2012 Saab 9-5, and the Cadillac XTS. The design was based on 2008 Buick Invicta concept, and replaces both the Chinese and North American models. The final design work was carried out at the GM design center in Warren, Michigan.

The LaCrosse was marketed in Mexico starting in 2010, as the Buick brand returned to the country after 13 years.

===Engines===
The 2.4L Ecotec four-cylinder replaced the 3.0L V6 as the standard engine on the CX model in the first quarter of 2010. The 3.6L V6 continues to be an option on the CX and front-wheel-drive CXL and standard on the CXS and all-wheel-drive CXL.

All V6 models are equipped with the Hydra-Matic 6T70 6-speed automatic transmission.

===Reception===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; said the new LaCrosse combined design elements from classic American cars of the 1930s and 1950s with traditional Chinese aesthetic elements: &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; aggregated the following ratings based on numerous reviews of the models years, also for the 2016 model year. Results of the analysis were given on a scale of 1 to 10, where a higher number indicates positive reception. The overall result for the 2016 model year was 8.7, critics&#x27; rating 8.8, performance 8.1, interior 8.4, and safety 9.7.

===Technology and features===
The 2010 Buick LaCrosse CXS was the first North American car to incorporate a front suspension design, marketed as &quot;HiPer Strut&quot;, designed to improve ride and handling while reducing torque steer. The Buick LaCrosse CXS included a system marketed as &quot;Real Time Damping&quot; that adjusts the damping forces of the shocks and struts for improved ride and handling.

The 2010, 2012, and 2013 models lacked an interior trunk release mechanism. The trunk was only accessible using the key fob (remote keyless entry) or a touch sensor between the trunk lid and the license plate. The 2011 model added a remote release button at the left of the steering wheel on the instrument panel. The 2014 model refresh returned the trunk release button to LaCrosse but placed it on the driver door.

====eAssist====
The 2012 LaCrosse features a new mild hybrid as its base model. Dubbed eAssist, the 2012 LaCrosse introduced GM&#x27;s second-generation belted-alternator starter system. The non-hybrid 4-cylinder was no longer offered. The system consists of a 115-volt lithium-ion battery pack, a 15 kW electric motor capable of adding 15 horsepower of assist while accelerating, and the next-generation 6T40 GM Hydra-Matic transmission with reduced friction components over the previous generation. The eAssist LaCrosse delivers a class leading fuel economy of 25 mpg city and 36 mpg highway. In addition to providing additional power to the 182 hp 2.4L 4-cylinder, the BAS-II system allows for engine start/stop operation when the vehicle is not moving and allows for complete fuel cutoff to the engine during deceleration.

===Canadian market: Allure===
The second-generation LaCrosse debuted to the Canadian market at the 2009 Montreal International Auto Show as the Buick Allure, and soon after production began, General Motors Canada renamed the Allure to LaCrosse, to correspond with the car&#x27;s global marketing. GM Canada has offered existing Allure owners the option to change nameplates to LaCrosse.

===Korean market: Alpheon===
The Alpheon was a localized version of the Buick LaCrosse for the South Korean market. &quot;Alpheon&quot; was a standalone brand from GM Korea. The cars were additionally fitted with amenities such as controls in the rear armrest, mood lights and more. A version of the vehicle (with 3.0L V6 engine mated to a six-speed automatic transmission) was unveiled at the 2010 Busan International Motor Show.

Production began on August 9, 2010, at GM Daewoo&#x27;s factory in Bupyeong, Incheon. Market launch began in September 2010. Early models included one with a 3.0-liter engine (from the 2010 Buick LaCrosse) in mid-September, followed by two models each with a 2.4-liter engine in October.

The Alpheon was discontinued in 2015, after monthly sales fell below 500 cars. GM Korea replaced it with the Chevrolet Impala.

===Chinese market: Roewe 950===

The Roewe 950 was a Chinese version of the Buick LaCrosse produced by Roewe of SAIC. It was sold alongside the Buick LaCrosse in China, and had a price range similar to that of the LaCrosse. The sheet metal, while similar in appearance, was unique to the Roewe.

In late February 2012, the Chinese government removed the Buick LaCrosse (along with all other foreign vehicles) from the list of vehicles approved for government procurement. Though popular among government officials, the LaCrosse also thrived via private purchases.

===2014 facelift===
Buick unveiled a revised 2014 LaCrosse at the 2013 New York Auto Show. Redesigned front and rear fascias, new wheel designs, a reconfigurable eight-inch TFT LCD instrument cluster, semi-aniline leather seating, and radar- and camera-based safety features such as forward collision alert and side blind zone alert are among the most notable changes for this mid-cycle refresh.

For 2016, the LaCrosse added a new Sport Touring Edition which included unique 18&quot; aluminum black pocket wheels, and a rear lip spoiler.

===Production===
Production of North American models moved from Oshawa to the Fairfax Assembly plant in Kansas City, Kansas, where it ran down the same production line as the Chevrolet Malibu. Delivery of 2010 models was delayed a few weeks in order to assure quality control. Production for China started a month later.

=== Safety ===
The 2010 model year LaCrosse was awarded &quot;Top Safety Pick&quot; by IIHS, as it received a Good rating in the crash test evaluations particularly in the roof strength test which it could withstand force of four times its vehicle weight. 
==Third generation (2017)==
The third-generation LaCrosse debuted at the 2015 LA Auto Show as a 2017 model using the E2XX platform shared with the 2016–2020 Chevrolet Impala. The platform switch and use of high-strength steels reduced weight by about , despite slightly growing in length and width.

The car was powered by a GM Small Gasoline Engine and GM Ecotec engine in China for tax credit purposes and by a fourth-generation GM High Feature engine in North America. Since 2018, the LaCrosse came standard with an eAssist drivetrain, consisting of a mild hybrid electric and 2.5-liter Ecotec gasoline engine sending power to the front wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission.

In order to make room for an upcoming new product in the Kansas City facility, the production of the LaCrosse was moved from GM Fairfax Assembly to Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly.

The main difference between the North American and Chinese model LaCrosse was the drive system. Models sold in the Chinese market were front-wheel drive vehicles only, compared to their American counterparts which were available in front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive.

Third-generation features included:
*Automatic parking assist (front ultrasonic parking assist is now present).
*Apple CarPlay and Android Auto for the Buick IntelliLink infotainment system.
*An all-new 3.6-liter direct-injection VVT V6 engine (&quot;LGX&quot; 310 hp / 282 lb-ft), with stop-start and cylinder deactivation.
*Externally-sourced 8-speed Aisin (AWF8F35) automatic transmission (2017 only).
*Starting in 2018, an all-new 9-speed GM 9T60 (M3G) automatic transmission with the optional V6.

===Safety===

The 2017 LaCrosse received a &quot;Top Safety Pick&quot; in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety&#x27;s Crashworthiness test and a &quot;Poor&quot; rating for headlights, which prevented a &quot;Top Safety Pick Plus&quot;. The LaCrosse came standard with ten airbags: front air bags, roof rail–mounted head-curtain air bags, seat-mounted side-impact air bags for both front and rear outboard seat passengers, and knee air bags for front seat passengers. Additional standard safety features included ultrasonic rear parking sensors and a backup camera. Optional safety features included a following distance indicator, forward collision alert, forward collision braking, front pedestrian detection, blind spot detection, lane keeping assist, and rear-cross traffic alert.
===Reception===
Car and Driver&#x27;s said the LaCrosse had an &quot;elegant exterior, much-improved interior materials, impressive ride and handling with up level suspension,&quot; while &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; listed the 2017 LaCrosse as a Finalist for Best Large Car for Families. Motor Trend said &quot;the car drops about 300 pounds and rides on a new platform, which contributes to a better driving experience and a much quieter ride. Buick also separates the LaCrosse from most competitors by offering all-wheel drive on the highest trim level,&quot; and listed the Kia Cadenza, Nissan Maxima, Chrysler 300, and Lexus ES as competitors.

Consumer Reports was critical of the gear selector, saying &quot;our biggest gripe about the controls is the new electronic gear selector. Drivers used to a traditional PRNDL configuration—in other words, those drivers who kept the lights on for Buick for many years—will be puzzled, if not angered.&quot; In addition, reviewers were critical of the sticker price on top-trim, heavily optioned models with Bloomberg saying &quot;by the time you spend the $48,395 it costs to get the LaCrosse to this level, you&#x27;re creeping into Audi/BMW/Mercedes territory.&quot;

===Discontinuation===

The Buick LaCrosse was one of six vehicles GM discontinued after the 2019 model year amid a global restructuring effort. The discontinuation of the LaCrosse affected the North American market and Buick will continue to manufacture the LaCrosse in China, where the sedan remains a best seller. Production of the Buick LaCrosse for North America ceased on February 15, 2019.

===2019 facelift===

A facelift was introduced for the 2019 model year in the Chinese market, with the facelifted LaCrosse featuring a new 2.0-liter turbo engine to the powertrain options. The new 2.0-liter turbo engine is one of GM&#x27;s eighth-generation Ecotec engines and delivers a maximum output of 237 hp and 350 N-m (258 lb-ft) of torque. The 2019 LaCrosse was available with a nine-speed Hydra-Matic automatic transmission with an average fuel consumption of 6.9 liters per 100 kilometers (34 miles per gallon). Trim levels for the New LaCrosse model are known as the 652T Elite, 652T Luxury and 652T Distinguished. From 2021 to 2023, the 552T trim level was available where a 1.5 liter turbocharged engine was also introduced as standard.

==Fourth generation (2023)==
In 2023, Buick unveiled the fourth-generation LaCrosse, adopting Buick&#x27;s new Pure Design philosophy first seen on the Buick GL8 Century minivan, as well as Buick&#x27;s new corporate emblem. The fourth-generation LaCrosse is available in four trims: Beyond, Enjoy, Premium, and Avenir. The LaCrosse was only offered with a turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine at launch; a 1.5-liter four-cylinder for the base model will be available later in 2023.

<doc id="855463" wikidata="Q2742568" url="?curid=855463" title="USS Syren (1803)">
<text>USS &quot;Syren&quot; (later &quot;Siren&quot;) was a brig of the United States Navy built at Philadelphia in 1803. She served during the First Barbary War and the War of 1812 until the Royal Navy captured her in 1814. The British never commissioned her but apparently used her for a year or so as a lazaretto, or a prison vessel. She then disappears from records.

== Description ==
&quot;Syren&quot; was designed by Benjamin Hutton, Jr. of Philadelphia and built for the Navy in 1803 at Philadelphia by shipwright Nathaniel Hutton and launched on 6 August 1803. Capt. Bainbridge supervised her construction. She was commissioned in September and in a letter dated 9 May, 1803 Lieutenant Charles Stewart was appointed in command as of her launching, but was appointed to supervie her construction on 28 May.

She was sharper, but smaller than USS &quot;Argus&quot; (1803)&quot;,&quot; yet carried the same armament. Both vessels were built the same year for the First Barbary War.

==Service history in US Navy==

===First Barbary War===
&quot;Syren&quot; departed Philadelphia on 27 August 1803 passing by Cape Henlopen on 3 September and reached Gibraltar on 1 October. On 11 October, 1803 in Tangier Bay she collided with USS New York, almost being run down by the frigate, receiving damage to her rigging and losing an anchor. Three days later she sailed via Livorno to Algiers carrying presents and money to the Dey of Algiers. just after midnight 29 November while at sea she was caught by a severe storm, being put on her beams ens, filled to the waist with water and her jolly boat destroyed. She then sailed to Algiers, arriving on 21 December and then on to Syracuse, Sicily, where she arrived 28 December, 1804 where repairs were made.

The first action &quot;Syren&quot; was involved in was an attack aimed at destroying , a frigate that had run aground the previous autumn and that Tripolitan gunboats had then captured. To prevent &quot;Philadelphia&quot; from opposing his planned operations against Tripoli, the commander of the American squadron in the Mediterranean, Commodore Edward Preble, decided to destroy her. To achieve this, &quot;Syren&quot; and ketch sailed from Syracuse on 3 February 1804 and proceeded to Tripoli, which they reached on 7 February. However, before the American ships could launch their attack, they were driven off by a violent gale and did not get back off Tripoli until 16 February. Before the attack &quot;Syren&quot; tied up alongside &quot;Intrepid&quot; to transfer some of her crew for the assault on &quot;Philadelphia&quot;. Aboard &quot;Intrepid&quot;, under the command of Stephen Decatur, sailors from both &quot;Intrepid&quot; and &quot;Syren&quot; succeeded in burning &quot;Philadelphia&quot;. Also present during the assault was Thomas Macdonough of &quot;Syren&quot;.

&quot;Syren&quot; returned to Syracuse on the morning of 19 February. On 5 March she detained a Prussian brig on a voyage from Tunis to Candia with Turkish passengers, she was sent to Malta, arriving same day, where Squadron Commander Preble immediately released her. On 9 March, she and sailed for Tripoli. Soon after their arrival, on 17 March 1804, she captured the Maltese armed brig &quot;Transfer&quot; belonging to Count Golena. Stewart took &quot;Transfer&quot; into US service and renamed her . She then served in the American squadron. On 20 March she collided with , causing damage to Nautilas that she had to return to port. On 22 March &quot;Syren&quot; captured a Russian flagged polacca named &quot;Madonna di Catapoliani&quot; or &quot;Madona de Catapolaigne&quot; and sent her to Malta. Capt. Preble ordered her released on 25 March after arrival. Operations in the Mediterranean during the spring and summer of 1804 and participated in the attacks on Tripoli in August and September 1804. The ship continued to support the squadron&#x27;s operation against Tripoli which forced the Pasha to accede to American demands. After a peace treaty with Tripoli was signed on 10 June 1805, the brig remained in the Mediterranean commanded by Master Commandant John Smith for almost a year helping to establish and maintain satisfactory relations with other Barbary states.

The ship returned to America in May 1806 and reached the Washington Navy Yard in August. She was laid up in ordinary there until recommissioned in 1807 and subsequently carried dispatches to France in 1809. In 1809, her sailing master at the Norfolk Navy Yard was Captain John &quot;Mad Jack&quot; Percival. The following year, her name was changed to &quot;Siren&quot;.

===War of 1812===
Little record has been found of the brig&#x27;s service during the War of 1812, however small news items appeared in the Salem Gazette and the Boston Gazette.

In May 1813 it was reported that within the space of two days a merchant vessel, &quot;Pilgrim&quot;, was boarded, first by which was searching for &quot;Syren&quot;, and then by &quot;Syren&quot;, which was searching for &quot;Herald&quot;. &quot;Syren&quot; was now commanded by Lieutenant Joseph Bainbridge. The following month &quot;Syren&quot; left Belize and proceeded to Cuba where after three weeks searching for a Royal Navy sloop, probably &quot;Herald&quot;, she sailed for the coast of Florida putting in at New Orleans before departing on 9 May 1813. No prizes were taken during this voyage and the ship needed repairs.

By January 1814 &quot;Syren&quot; was in Massachusetts and was now commanded by Lieutenant Parker, In February she sailed along with a privateer, &quot;Grand Turk&quot;. Not long after sailing Parker died and command transferred to Lieutenant N.J. Nicholson.

&quot;Syren&quot; captured at least three merchant ships off the coast of Africa. On 28 May she captured and burnt , Hassler, master, which had been sailing from Africa to Liverpool. Then on 1 June &quot;Syren&quot; captured &quot;Adventure&quot;, which too was from Africa to Liverpool. She took-off their cargoes of ivory and sank them. Lastly, at some point &quot;Syren&quot; captured &quot;Catherine&quot;.

On 12 July 1814 &quot;Syren&quot; while cruising off the West African coast encountered the British ship a 74-gun third rate ship of the line under the command of Captain Augustus Brine. Heavily outgunned, &quot;Syren&quot; attempted to run. After an 11-hour chase &quot;Medway&quot; captured her despite &quot;Syren&quot; having lightened her load by throwing overboard her guns, anchors and boats. During her last voyage she had captured or sunk several British merchantmen. Among the prisoners was Samuel Leech, who later wrote an account of his experiences.

According to Samuel Leech, after being captured the crew of &quot;Syren&quot; were taken to the Cape of Good Hope, and after landing at Simonstown, marched to a jail in Cape Town. Here they were held until transferred to England when the war was over. On arriving at Simonstown, other American prisoners were seen to be leaving the jail and being shipped off to Dartmoor. The &quot;Syren&quot; crew met these again in England while waiting for transfer to the United States. Some had been present at &#x27;The Massacre&#x27;.

==British service history==
After her capture by the Royal Navy she had a figurehead of a mermaid installed.

The Royal Navy used her as a lazaretto. She is no longer listed after 1815.

<text>Wail Mohammed al-Shehri (; or Alshehri; July 31, 1973September 11, 2001) was a Saudi school teacher and terrorist hijacker. He was one of five hijackers of American Airlines Flight 11, which was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center as part of the September 11 attacks.

Wail al-Shehri was an elementary school teacher from Khamis Mushait in the Asir region of Saudi Arabia. In early 2000, he traveled to Medina to seek treatment for mental problems. He and his younger brother Waleed traveled to Afghanistan in March 2000 and joined an Al-Qaeda training camp. The brothers were chosen, along with others from the same region of Saudi Arabia, to participate in the September 11 attacks. Once selected, al-Shehri returned to Saudi Arabia in October 2000 to obtain a clean passport, then returned to Afghanistan. In March 2001, he recorded his last will and testament on video.

Al-Shehri arrived in the United States in early June 2001, staying in budget motels in the Boynton Beach area of south Florida. On September 5, 2001, al-Shehri traveled to Boston and checked into a motel with his brother. Six days later, al-Shehri arrived early in the morning at Boston&#x27;s Logan International Airport and boarded American Airlines Flight 11. Fifteen minutes after takeoff, al-Shehri, along with his brother and three others, hijacked the airliner. They deliberately crashed it into the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 8:46 a.m.

In the aftermath of the attacks, some news reports mistakenly reported that al-Shehri was the son of a Saudi diplomat and was still alive and well. The al-Shehri family in Khamis Mushait spoke to the media, denying those early reports, saying that the al-Shehri brothers had disappeared and have not been heard from since.

== Background ==

Wail al-Shehri and his younger brother Waleed were from Khamis Mushait in the Asir province, which is an impoverished area in southwestern Saudi Arabia, along the Yemeni border. Al-Shehri was born in Annams, and grew up in the Um Saraar neighborhood in Khamis Mushait. He had ten brothers and one sister. Several of al-Shehri&#x27;s brothers joined the Saudi military, while his uncle may have been a major in the army and director of logistics. Al-Shehri&#x27;s father, Mohammed Ali Asgley Al Shehri, worked as a car dealer. On weekends, the family often spent time together at the Red Sea. The family strictly adhered to the Wahabi school of Islam, which forbids many elements of modernity. As such, the al-Shehri family did not have satellite television or Internet, nor did his parents permit music or contact with girls. Some of Wail al-Shehri&#x27;s elder brothers had visited the United States and could speak English, but Wail himself knew little English.

During high school and college, al-Shehri was deeply religious and attended Al-Seqley Mosque, which his family had built as the local mosque. Al-Shehri also frequented government-supported religious camps in Saudi Arabia. At this time, there were strong religious feelings in Saudi Arabia, especially in the Asir region. Many young people in the region idolized Osama bin Laden, who had family ties to the area. Al-Shehri&#x27;s father was a friend of Bin Laden&#x27;s father, Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden. Ahmed al-Nami and Saeed al-Ghamdi, who were both hijackers on United Airlines Flight 93, came from the same area in Saudi Arabia as the Shehri family.

After graduating from Abha teachers college in 1999, Wail al-Shehri took a job as an elementary school physical education teacher at the Khamis Mushait airbase. Five months into the job, al-Shehri took leave due to mental illness and depression. Rather than conventional therapy, al-Shehri sought consultation with Muslim clerics, and hoped that a visit to Medina would help. His treatment involved verses from the Qur&#x27;an read to him by a sheikh. He traveled to Medina together with Waleed. After the September 11 attacks, others recalled seeing the al-Shehri brothers in Medina.

== Afghanistan ==
Wail and Waleed al-Shehri disappeared after going to Medina, calling their father just once; in the conversation, the brothers were vague about when they would return. Both had expressed interest in joining the jihad in Chechnya, though may have been diverted to Afghanistan. Before disappearing, the al-Shehri brothers went to Al-Seqley Mosque to swear an oath and commitment to jihad, as did Ahmed al-Nami and Saeed al-Ghamdi. Wail al-Shehri presided over the ceremony, dubbing himself &quot;Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi&quot; after one of Muhammad&#x27;s companions.

In March 2000, he left for Pakistan with Waleed and Ahmed al-Nami; later, they went on to Afghanistan. Wail al-Shehri followed the standard path for new al-Qaeda recruits in Afghanistan, spending time in the Khalden training camp and then Al Farouq training camp near Kandahar. Details on how the non-pilot (&quot;muscle&quot;) hijackers were chosen for the 9/11 attacks are vague, though the hijackers appear to have been selected by senior al-Qaeda leaders in 2000 from the thousands of recruits at training camps in Afghanistan. The most capable and motivated volunteers were at al-Farouq, and Saudi citizens were good candidates, since it would be easy for them to obtain visas to travel to the United States. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director George Tenet later said that the muscle hijackers were probably told little about their mission in the United States.

Once al-Shehri and the other muscle hijackers completed their training in Afghanistan, they received $2,000 so they could return to Saudi Arabia to obtain new passports and visas. The al-Shehri brothers may have been assisted by a relative who worked in the Saudi passport office. Wail and Waleed al-Shehri received passports on 3 October 2000, and then obtained United States visas on 24 October. On his visa application, Wail al-Shehri provided vague information, stating his employer/school as &quot;South City&quot;, and his destination as &quot;Wasantwn&quot;. Al-Shehri indicated his occupation as &quot;teacher&quot;, and that he would be traveling with his brother on a four-to-six month vacation, which would be paid for with al-Shehri&#x27;s teacher salary. Although he would not be working while on vacation, consular officials nonetheless did not question if the al-Shehri brothers had the financial means to support themselves while in the United States.

In late 2000, al-Shehri traveled to the United Arab Emirates, where he purchased traveler&#x27;s checks, presumed to have been paid for by Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi. Five other hijackers passed through the United Arab Emirates and purchased traveler&#x27;s checks, including Majed Moqed, Saeed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Haznawi and Ahmed al-Nami. The 9/11 Commission believes that in mid-November 2000, three of the future muscle hijackers, including the al-Shehri brothers, traveled in a group from Saudi Arabia to Beirut and then onward to Iran where they could travel through to Afghanistan without getting their passports stamped. An associate of a senior Hezbollah operative is thought to have been on the same flight, although this may have been a coincidence.

Wail al-Shehri appeared together with hijackers Ahmed al-Nami, Hamza al-Ghamdi, and Ahmed al-Ghamdi on a video recorded in March 2001, and aired on Al Jazeera in September 2002. Al-Shehri was seen studying maps and flight manuals, but he did not speak in the video; it also included a segment of Abdulaziz al-Omari reading his last will and testament. While in Afghanistan, another video was recorded that showed al-Shehri reading his last will and testament. This video was released on September 7, 2006.

== United States ==
On June 5, 2001, Wail al-Shehri obtained an International Driving Permit, which was issued in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates. Al-Shehri arrived together with fellow al-Qaeda member Ahmed al-Haznawi at Miami International Airport, via London, from Dubai on June 8. Both were admitted as tourists for six months. Al-Shehri opened a bank account at SunTrust Bank in Florida on June 18, with a deposit of $8,000 that came from American Express traveler&#x27;s cheques purchased on June 7 in the United Arab Emirates.

Al-Shehri moved into the Homing Inn, a budget motel in Boynton Beach, on June 21, 2001, sharing a room with his brother Waleed, and Satam al-Suqami. Wail al-Shehri and al-Suqami both used this hotel as their address when they received Florida state non-driver identifications on July 3. Al-Shehri checked into the Panther Motel &amp; Apartments, in Deerfield Beach, with his brother and al-Suqami on August 2, staying there until August 10. While in Florida, al-Shehri was a member of the World Gym in Boynton Beach, where he trained with Waleed and al-Suqami. During the summer of 2001, al-Shehri regularly used computers at the Delray Beach Public Library.

On August 28, 2001, Wail and Waleed al-Shehri made reservations on American Airlines Flight 11, using the Mail Boxes Etc. in Hollywood, Florida, as their address. The al-Shehri brothers contacted American Airlines on September 3 by telephone to change their first-class seat assignments for American Airlines Flight 11, selecting seats on the side of the aircraft that offered a direct view of the cockpit. Wail and Waleed al-Shehri left Florida for Boston on September 5, traveling together on Delta Air Lines Flight 2462.

Wail al-Shehri checked in together with Waleed at the Park Inn Hotel in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, on September 5, 2001, staying in room 432. While staying at the Park Inn, the brothers may have called a prostitute. Wail al-Shehri accompanied his brother on September 9 to the Travelex at Logan International Airport, where Waleed attempted to wire $5,000 to the United Arab Emirates. Waleed had insufficient documentation, so the brothers returned the next day to complete the transaction. Mustafa Muhammad Ahmad received the funds on September 11 at Al-Ansari Exchange in Sharjah. Hijacker Abdulaziz al-Omari possibly spent a night at the Park Inn before leaving with Mohamed Atta for Portland, Maine, on September 10. When Wail and Waleed al-Shehri checked out on September 11, they left a sheet of instructions for flying a jet behind in their hotel room.

== Attacks ==

Wail al-Shehri, his brother Waleed, and Satam al-Suqami arrived together at Logan Airport at 06:45 on September 11, 2001. Upon check-in, all three men were selected by the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS) for further screening of their checked baggage. As the CAPPS was only for luggage, the three hijackers did not undergo any extra scrutiny at the passenger security checkpoint.

By 07:40, all five hijackers were aboard the flight, which was scheduled to depart at 07:45. Wail and Waleed al-Shehri sat together in first class in seats 2A and 2B respectively. The aircraft taxied away from Gate 26, and departed Logan International Airport at 07:59, following a 14-minute delay. Flight 11 was hijacked at approximately 08:14, which is when the pilot stopped responding to air traffic control. It is suspected that the brothers stabbed two flight attendants in the hijacking. At 08:46:40, Mohamed Atta, who was flying the plane, deliberately crashed Flight 11 into the northern facade of the North Tower (Tower 1) of the World Trade Center between floors 93 and 99. The immediate damage destroyed any means of escape from above the impact zone, trapping 1,344 people. The North Tower collapsed at 10:28, after burning for 102 minutes.

== Aftermath ==
Waleed al-Shehri was reported to have been found alive by a BBC News article on September 23, 2001, and other news reports in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Reports said that the al-Shehri brothers were the sons of a Saudi diplomat stationed in New Delhi, Ahmed al-Shehri. The diplomat&#x27;s son was trained as a pilot at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida, and was working as a pilot for Saudi Arabian Airlines. At the time of the attacks, he was in Morocco for a training program. There were also reports that Wail al-Shehri was a trained pilot. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, Saudi officials suggested that Wail and Waleed al-Shehri were victims of identity theft, but the diplomat&#x27;s son was the victim of mistaken identity.

Jamal Khashoggi, of &quot;Al Watan&quot; and &quot;Arab News&quot; in Saudi Arabia, spoke with Muhammad Ali al-Shehri in Khamis Mushait, who said his sons Wail and Waleed had been missing for months. He denied reports that Wail had an aeronautics degree, as some news reports said, &quot;My son Wail was 25 years old and had a BA in physical education from the Abha Teacher’s College. He was mentally ill and had gone to numerous clerics for assistance in overcoming this instability. He had asked the school, where he taught, for a 6-month leave to go to Madinah.&quot; His father also told reporters that he dreaded having to believe that his sons were involved in the September 11 attacks, &quot;If that turns out to be the truth, then I&#x27;ll never, never accept it from them. I&#x27;ll never forgive them for that.&quot; Family members said that Wail and Waleed became very religious in the months before they disappeared, had expressed interest in going to Chechnya, and hoped for martyrdom. In a report entitled &quot;A Saudi Apology&quot; for &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; aired on August 25, 2002, John Hockenberry traveled to Asir, where he interviewed another al-Shehri brother, Salah, who agreed that Wail and Waleed were deceased. Salah described them as not very religious, and suggested they had been brainwashed.

Saudi officials later stated that the names of the hijackers were in fact correct, and that 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi. In response to 9/11 conspiracy theories surrounding its original news story suggesting hijackers were still alive, the BBC stated in 2006 that later reports on the hijackers superseded the original story. The BBC also explained that confusion arose with the Arabic names that were common.

<text>Linné is a small lunar impact crater located in the western Mare Serenitatis. It was named after Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus. The mare around this feature is virtually devoid of other features of interest. The nearest named crater is Banting to the east-southeast.
The estimated age of this copernican crater is only a few tens of millions of years. It was earlier believed to have a bowl shape, but data from the LRO showed that it has a shape of a flattened, inverted cone. The crater is surrounded by a blanket of ejecta formed during the original impact. This ejecta has a relatively high albedo, making the feature appear bright.

In 1824 Wilhelm Lohrmann (1786-1840) of Dresden had drawn Linné as an 8 km diameter crater in his acclaimed lunar atlas, and in 1837 Wilhelm Beer and Johann Heinrich Mädler had described Linne in &quot;Der Mond&quot; as a 10 km crater. In 1866, the experienced lunar observer and mapmaker Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt made the surprising claim that Linné had changed its appearance. Instead of a normal, somewhat deep crater it had become a mere white patch. A controversy arose that continued for many decades. However, this crater size tests the limit of visual perception of Earth-based telescopes. In conditions of poor visibility this feature can appear to vanish from sight (see also transient lunar phenomenon).
==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Linné.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.

* Linné E — &quot;See&quot; Banting (crater).

<text>Ghost Nation is the sixth studio album by Australian rock band, Hunters &amp; Collectors. It was co-produced by the band with Clive Martin and issued on White/Mushroom Records on 27 November 1989. It reached No. 10 on the ARIA Albums Chart, No. 29 in New Zealand and No. 31 in Sweden.

The album helped Hunters &amp; Collectors win the award of Australian Band of the Year (1990) by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Australia. The band were nominated for six awards at the Fourth Annual ARIA Music Awards in 1990, but they won just one category – Best Cover Art for &quot;Ghost Nation&quot; by Robert Miles.

== Background ==

Hunters &amp; Collectors line up in 1987 was John Archer on bass guitar, Doug Falconer on drums, Jack Howard on trumpet, Robert Miles on live sound, Mark Seymour on lead vocals and guitar, Jeremy Smith on French horn, and Michael Waters on keyboards and trombone. Early in 1988 Barry Palmer (also a member of Harem Scarem, ex-Stephen Cummings Band) joined the group on guitar. &quot;Ghost Nation&quot;, their sixth studio album, was co-produced by the band with Clive Martin. It was released in November 1989 on White Label/Mushroom in Australia and New Zealand and Atlantic in Europe and North America, and was their second Australian Top Ten appearance on the ARIA Albums Chart, peaking at No 10 in February 1990. In New Zealand it reached the top 30 and also charted in Sweden reaching No. 31 on the Sverigetopplistan. It provided four singles, beginning with &quot;When the River Runs Dry&quot;, appearing in September and peaking at No. 23 in Australia in December and No. 5 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks in 1990. The album also includes a cover version of Eric Gradman: Man and Machine&#x27;s 1979 single, &quot;Crime of Passion&quot;.

The album was remastered and re-issued by Liberation Records on 7 July 2003.

== Reception ==
Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, enthused &quot;[it] was perhaps the band&#x27;s finest album to date&quot;. However Allmusic&#x27;s Mike DeGagne declared that it was &quot;one of this Australian band&#x27;s weakest attempts, [it] suffers greatly from bland lyrics and gray instrumental work through the entirety of the album&quot;. Ed St John in &quot;Rolling Stone Australia&quot; states &quot;The first thing that strikes me about &quot;Ghost Nation&quot; is its sound. The band plays with impressive spirit, the grooves flowing with a spontaneous grace that far surpasses much of their earlier work. Moreover the music is beautifully recorded and intelligently, thoughtfully mixed.&quot;

The album helped Hunters &amp; Collectors win the award of Australian Band of the Year (1990) by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Australia. The band were nominated for six awards at the ARIA Music Awards of 1990, but won just one category – Best Cover Art for &quot;Ghost Nation&quot; by Miles.

<text>Banyo railway station is located on the Shorncliffe line in the suburb of Banyo in the City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. 

==History==
The station was built in 1882 on the Sandgate railway line (now the Shorncliffe line). At that time, it was expected that this station would be the junction for the future North Coast railway line and was named Clapham Junction railway station. However it was later decided that junction would be at Northgate railway station and in 1897 it was renamed Banyo railway station.

===2012 truck collision===

On 14 September 2012, a loaded semi-trailer was stuck on the level crossing at the station, when a northbound train collided with the vehicle, which caused it to be thrown into a southbound service. 
Rail services on the Shorncliffe railway line were disrupted for the rest of the day while the rail safety regulator investigated the collision.

===2024 station upgrade===

Banyo station temporarily closed on 22 January 2024 for an accessibility upgrade, which will include a new footbridge with lift access and full-length, high-level platforms. It is expected to reopen in early 2025. During the accessibility upgrade, services do not stop at the station.

==Services==
Banyo station is served by all stops Shorncliffe line services from Shorncliffe to Roma Street, Cannon Hill, Manly and Cleveland.

<doc id="855488" wikidata="Q11349350" url="?curid=855488" title="Reynolds v. Sims">
<text>Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that the electoral districts of state legislative chambers must be roughly equal in population. Along with &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot; (1962) and &quot;Wesberry v. Sanders&quot; (1964), it was part of a series of Warren Court cases that applied the principle of &quot;one person, one vote&quot; to U.S. legislative bodies.

Prior to the case, numerous state legislative chambers had districts containing unequal populations; for example, in the Nevada Senate, the smallest district had 568 people, while the largest had approximately 127,000 people. Some states refused to engage in regular redistricting, while others enshrined county by county representation (like the U.S. constitution does with state by state representation) in their constitutions. The case of &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; arose after voters in Birmingham, Alabama, challenged the apportionment of the Alabama Legislature; the Constitution of Alabama provided for one state senator per county regardless of population differences.

In a majority opinion joined by five other justices, Chief Justice Earl Warren ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Equal Protection Clause requires states to establish state legislative electoral districts roughly equal in population. Warren held that &quot;legislators represent people, not trees or acres. Legislators are elected by voters, not farms or cities or economic interests.&quot; In his dissenting opinion, Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan II argued that the Equal Protection Clause was not designed to apply to voting rights. The decision had a major impact on state legislatures, as many states had to change their system of representation.

==Historical background==
Before the industrialization and urbanization of the United States, a state senate in most states was understood to represent rural counties as a counterbalance to towns and cities. Of the forty-eight states then in the Union, only seven twice redistricted even one chamber of their legislature following both the 1930 and the 1940 Censuses. Illinois did not redistrict between 1910 and 1955, while Alabama and Tennessee had at the time of &quot;Reynolds&quot; not redistricted since 1901. In Connecticut, Vermont, Mississippi, and Delaware, apportionment was fixed by the states&#x27; constitutions, which, when written in the late eighteenth or nineteenth centuries, did not foresee the possibility of rural depopulation as was to occur during the first half of the century. In New Hampshire the state constitutions, since January 1776, had always called for the state senate to be apportioned based on taxes paid, rather than on population.

Having already overturned its ruling that redistricting was a purely political question in &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot;, 369 U.S. 186 (1962), the Court ruled to correct what it considered egregious examples of malapportionment; these were serious enough to undermine the premises underlying republican government. Before &quot;Reynolds&quot;, urban counties nationwide often had total representations similar to rural counties, and in Florida, there was a limit to three representatives even for the most populous counties.

==The case==
Voters from Jefferson County, Alabama, home to the state&#x27;s largest city of Birmingham, challenged the apportionment of the Alabama Legislature. The Alabama Constitution provided that there be only one state senator per county. Ratio variances as great as 41 to 1 from one senatorial district to another existed in the Alabama Senate (i.e., the number of eligible voters voting for one senator was in one case 41 times the number of voters in another). The case was named for M. O. Sims, one of the voters who brought the suit, and B. A. Reynolds, a probate judge in Dallas County, one of the named defendants in the original suit. Reynolds was named (along with three other probate judges) as a symbolic representative of all probate judges in the state of Alabama.

Among the more extreme pre-&quot;Reynolds&quot; disparities claimed by Morris K. Udall:

* In the Connecticut General Assembly, one House district had 191 people.
* In the New Hampshire General Court, the Town of Ellsworth with a population of three people had a Representative in the lower house; this was the same representation given to Bedford, with a population of 3,636.
* In the Utah State Legislature, the smallest district had 165 people, the largest 32,380.
* In the Vermont General Assembly, the smallest district had 36 people, the largest 35,000.
* In the Idaho Senate, the smallest district had 969 people; the largest, 93,400.
* In the Nevada Senate, seventeen members represented as many as 127,000 or as few as 568 people.

===Decision===
The eight justices who struck down state senate inequality based their decision on the principle of &quot;one person, one vote.&quot; In his majority decision, Chief Justice Earl Warren said &quot;Legislators represent people, not trees or acres. Legislators are elected by voters, not farms or cities or economic interests.&quot; In addition, the majority simply denied the argument that states were permitted to base their apportionment structures upon the Constitution itself, which requires two senators from each state despite substantially unequal populations among the states.

Justice Tom C. Clark wrote a concurring opinion. Justice Potter Stewart also issued a concurring opinion, in which he argued that while many of the schemes of representation before the court in the case were egregiously undemocratic and clearly violative of equal protection, it was not for the Court to provide any guideline beyond general reasonableness for apportionment of districts.

In dissent, Justice John Marshall Harlan II wrote that the majority had chosen to ignore the language, history, and original intent of the Equal Protection Clause, which did not extend to voting rights. The dissent strongly accused the Court of repeatedly amending the Constitution through its opinions, rather than waiting for the lawful amendment process: &quot;the Court&#x27;s action now bringing them (state legislative apportionments) within the purview of the Fourteenth Amendment amounts to nothing less than an exercise of the amending power by this Court.&quot; The Court had already extended &quot;one person, one vote&quot; to all U.S. congressional districts in &quot;Wesberry v. Sanders&quot; (1964) a month before, but not to the Senate.

===Aftermath===
Since the ruling applied different representation rules to the states than was applicable to the federal government, &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; set off a legislative firestorm across the country. Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois led a fight to pass a constitutional amendment allowing legislative districts based on land area, similar to the United States Senate. He warned that:

Numerous states had to change their system of representation in the state legislature. For instance, South Carolina had historically elected one state senator from each county. It devised a reapportionment plan and passed an amendment providing for home rule to counties. While allegations of state senates being redundant arose in the decision&#x27;s aftermath, all states affected retained their state senates, with state senators being elected from single-member districts. This contrasted with the options of abolishing the upper houses, as had been done in Nebraska in 1936 (as well as the provinces of Canada), or electing state senators via proportional representation from either several large multi-member districts or from one statewide at-large district, as was done in Australia.

===Reactions===
In a 2015 &quot;Time&quot; Magazine survey of over 50 law professors, both Erwin Chemerinsky (Dean, UC Berkeley School of Law) and Richard Pildes (NYU School of Law) named &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; the &quot;best Supreme Court decision since 1960&quot;, with Chemerinsky noting that in his opinion, the decision made American government &quot;far more democratic and representative.&quot;

<doc id="855491" wikidata="Q2159676" url="?curid=855491" title="Bernardo Reyes">
<text>Bernardo Doroteo Reyes Ogazón (30 August 1850 – 9 February 1913) was a Mexican general and politician who fought in the Second French intervention in Mexico and served as the appointed Governor of Nuevo León for more than two decades during the Porfiriato. During Reyes&#x27;s administration as Governor, the state made important economic, industrial and social advances, and he was one of the closest and most faithful allies of President of Mexico Porfirio Díaz. He was killed during a failed coup d&#x27;état (known as the Ten Tragic Days) against President Francisco I. Madero in the first stage of the Mexican Revolution.

Born in a prominent liberal family in the western state of Jalisco, he served in the army, rising to the rank of general. Like his political patron, General Porfirio Díaz, Reyes was a military man who became an able administrator. He helped in the modernization of that state, enabling local industrialization, improving public education and health, and supporting improvements in the lives of workers. While governor of Nuevo León, Reyes approved a workers compensation law. 

In 1900, Díaz named Reyes the Secretary of War and Navy. He expanded the military, establishing the Second Reserve. However, he resigned from office after two years amid political conflict with the Cientificos, a circle of technocratic advisors to Diaz who saw the Second Reserve as a private army loyal to Reyes, and returned to Nuevo León, where his popularity grew. The Second Reserve was disbanded, but Reyes was considered a political counterweight to the Cientificos and a likely successor to Díaz. &quot;Reyista&quot; clubs supporting him for the presidency were formed, but he declined to challenge Díaz in the election of 1910.

After being forced from office in 1909, he embarked on a European tour and did not return until after Diaz was deposed in 1910 by Francisco I. Madero.

== Early life and family ==
Bernardo Doroteo Reyes Ogazón was born on August 20, 1849, at 121 López Cotilla Street in Guadalajara, Jalisco to a prominent military and political family active in Liberal Party politics. 

His father was Colonel Domingo Reyes Rovira, originally from Managua, Nicaragua. His mother Juana Ogazón Velázquez-Delgado was the younger sister of the colonel&#x27;s first wife, Guadalupe. He was the eldest of his mother&#x27;s four children and had two half-siblings from his father&#x27;s first marriage. His maternal cousins Pedro Ogazón and Ignacio Vallarta both served as Governors of Jalisco between 1858 and 1875.

Reyes studied law in the public schools in Guadalajara before beginning his military career at age fourteen, when he enlisted to fight against the Second French Empire in the 1861 French intervention in Mexico.

== Military career ==
In 1866, Reyes fought at Zacatecas and Calvillo as an ensign in the Centro Guías de Jalisco in the forces of General Trinidad García de la Cadena. The following year, at age seventeen, he joined the Jalisco &quot;lanceros&quot; and participated in the Siege of Querétaro, where he was wounded twice. He attended the execution of Emperor Maximilian I. 

After the intervention was expelled, Reyes participated in the suppression of rebellions by regional caudillos and rose swiftly through the ranks. At the Battle of La Mojonera in Zapopan, he fought with Ramón Corona against the &quot;caudillo&quot; Manuel Lozada, and single-handedly returned valuable information from behind enemy lines, evading a surprise attack. Following the battle, he was made &quot;comandante&quot;. He worked briefly in 1873 as a secretary to General Francisco Tolentino before returning to wage active campaigns against Lozada&#x27;s supporters. In September 1875, Reyes received a bullet wound to his neck while suppressing a mutiny of his own troops with twenty loyal soldiers. He successfully evicted the mutineers from the barracks and was made a lieutenant colonel.

In July 1880, Reyes defeated the rebel Ramírez Terrón at the Battle of Villa Unión in Sinaloa. Though outnumbered three-to-one, Reyes repelled Terrón&#x27;s initial attack and returned the charge with only a few soldiers, delivering fictitious orders to give the illusion of a larger force. Though he was presumed dead, Reyes survived with three wounds, including permanent damage to his right wrist, which was nearly amputated. Believing his forces were surrounded, Terrón committed suicide during the battle, leaving word to Reyes to care for Terrón&#x27;s family. Reyes did so, providing a monthly pension for his daughters and a job for his widow. In recognition of his victory at Villa Unión, President Porfirio Díaz personally awarded Reyes a rare double promotion directly to the rank of brigadier general. As brigadier general, Reyes led all Mexican forces in Sinaloa, Sonora, and Baja California from August 13, 1880 to March 11, 1883. From March 12, 1883 to October 1885, he was in charge of the Sixth Military District, headquartered in San Luis Potosí.

== Political career and administration ==
The center of Reyes&#x27;s political power was in his home state of Jalisco; Díaz&#x27;s supporters closed Reyes clubs and jailed their leaders. His main support came from the middle class, many of whom had connections to the now disbanded Second Reserve. Reyes was seen as a reformer, anti-Científico, pro-business, with a strong following among professionals such as doctors and lawyers, and a viable candidate of the old order with both military and political experience who could manage a presidential transition. He was not an outsider or radical agitator.

Together with José Yves Limantour, he was considered one of the potential successors of Porfirio Díaz. With Francisco Madero&#x27;s latter challenge to the dictator in the 1910 elections and, afterwards, initiation of the Mexican Revolution, previous notions of who should succeed Díaz were discarded.

== Mexican Revolution and death ==
For a time Reyes was a supporter of Madero, but he later led the first rebellion against Madero. After this rebellion failed, Reyes was imprisoned in the Mexico City prison of Santiago Tlatelolco. General Félix Díaz was imprisoned at another Mexico City jail for rebellion, but the two were able to easily communicate despite that and plot a joint coup against Madero. They tried to get General Victoriano Huerta to join the plot, but he declined, despite Huerta&#x27;s being a protégé of Reyes&#x27;s. General Manuel Mondragón sent forces to free Reyes from jail on 9 February 1913, who freed Reyes from prison. Then, they marched on to the National Palace in the beginning of the &quot;Ten Tragic Days&quot;. Reyes was killed on day 1 of the coup, in an assault on the palace. He had expected to enter the National Palace and declare Madero ousted. Before he could enter the building, Reyes was shot dead along with 400 others, among them civilians.

== Personal life ==
On November 4, 1872, Reyes married Aurelia de Ochoa y Sapién, the daughter of an aristocratic family from Zapotlán el Grande. They had twelve children, seven of whom survived to adulthood:

* Bernardo Reyes Ochoa (b. August 20, 1873), civil engineer who constructed the Temple of San Luis Gonzaga in Monterrey
* Rodolfo Reyes Ochoa (b. May 16, 1878), attorney who participated in the overthrow of Francisco I. Madero
* Maria Reyes Ochoa (b. 1880), wife of attorney Rafael Dávila Caballero, son of Governor of Nuevo Leon Narciso Dávila
* Amalia Reyes Ochoa, wife of attorney Fermín Sada
* Otilia Reyes Ochoa (b. 1888), wife of investor Ramón López León
* Alfonso Reyes Ochoa (b. May 17, 1889), internationally renowned writer
* Alejandro Reyes Ochoa

Five children died before reaching adulthood: Roberto, Aurelia, Eloísa, Guadalupe and Eva. 

He was the grandfather of the painter Aurora Reyes.

<text>is a junction passenger railway station located in the city of Tachikawa, Tokyo, Japan, operated by the East Japan Railway Company (JR East).

== Lines ==
Tachikawa Station is served by the Chūō Main Line, and is located 37.1 kilometers from the starting point of the line at Tokyo Station. It is also a terminus for both the Ōme Line and Nambu Lines. Although the Itsukaichi Line does not reach Tachikawa, a few trains on that line continue along the Ome Line tracks to serve this station.

== Station layout ==
This station consists of four ground-level island platforms serving eight tracks, with an elevated station building located above the platforms. The station has a &quot;Midori no Madoguchi&quot; staffed ticket office. Tachikawa-Minami Station and Tachikawa-Kita Station on the Tama Toshi Monorail Line flank Tachikawa Station, and are connected to it by decks. The Lumine department store occupies the upper floors of the station building.

===Platforms===



===Track layout===
==History==
The Kōbu Railway, which later became the Chūō Main Line, opened the station on April 11, 1889. The Ōme Railway (presently the Ōme Line) and the Nambu Railway (presently the Nambu Line) were connected to the station on November 19, 1894, and December 11, 1929, respectively.

The Itsukaichi Line was also connected to the station from July 13, 1930, to October 11, 1944, via a separate track between Tachikawa and Haijima, which was closed following the integration of the operation of the Ōme and Itsukaichi lines under the Japanese Government Railways in April 1944.

With the privatization of Japanese National Railways (JNR) on April 1, 1987, the station came under the control of JR East.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2019, the station was used by an average of 166,636 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), making it the 16th busiest station in the JR East network. The passenger figures for previous years are as shown below.

<doc id="855509" wikidata="Q1138062" url="?curid=855509" title="Coventry Victor">
<text>Coventry Victor was a British motorcycle and car manufacturer. Originally Morton &amp; Weaver, a proprietary engine manufacturer in Hillfields, Coventry, founded in 1904, the company changed its name to Coventry Victor Motors in 1911. The company closed in 1971.

==Morton &amp; Weaver==
Thomas Morton and William Arthur Weaver formed Morton &amp; Weaver Limited in Coventry in 1904 as engineers and toolmakers. In 1911, they formed a new company, the Coventry Victor Motor Company, to continue their interest in motor engineering while the original company continued as tool makers.

==Coventry Victor aero engines==
Weaver was a pioneer in designing and building aircraft, and by 1905 Weaver was designing and building his first ornithoplane (monoplane) utilising a nine-horsepower engine built by Johnson, Hurley and Martin Ltd. Although it was claimed it flew at Hampton-in-Arden in July 1906, it was just &quot;short hops&quot;, and it was reported that &quot;the machine more or less failed due to lack of engine power&quot;. 

The Weaver Ornithoplane No 2 was built from No 1 but with a more powerful engine and was towed on its own wheels behind a motor car to Hampton-in-Arden (the wings being strapped to the sides of the car), and was assembled and flown on 17 May 1910. In a series of four tests the Ornithoplane achieved a steady flight for a quarter of a mile, becoming the first monoplane to fly in Britain. The construction was of aluminium and bamboo, with an aluminium propeller driven by a 20 hp engine, and a wing span of about 45 feet. The four cylinder engine was also made by Johnson, Hurley and Martin at their Alpha Engine Works in Gosford Street, Coventry.

In 1955, Weaver, then managing director of the company, converted one of the company&#x27;s air-cooled flat four industrial engines for aircraft use and a Piper Cub fitted with the engine completed 50 hours flight trials at Southend in July 1955. The engine, referred to as the &#x27;Flying Neptune&#x27;, was found to be a little heavy and a little low on power, but otherwise performed admirably.

==Coventry Victor motorcycles==
In 1919 Coventry-Victor, using their 688 cc flat-twin engine, started making motorcycle and sidecar combinations, many of which were used as commercial outfits and became one of England&#x27;s leading producers of horizontally opposed twins. They also had a factory in Brussels, and in 1922 they sold one of their motorcycles to &quot;H.M. King of the Belgians&quot;, with all parts being made in Coventry and assembled in Brussels. The 1927 Coventry-Victor Silent Six has today become a sought after classic motorcycle. Motorcycle production ended in 1936. 

The company supplied engines to many motorcycle and cyclecar makers. Examples include the Victoria Motor &amp; Cycle Co, who launched their 688 cc Victor-engined motorcycle in 1919, and Grahame-White cyclecars.

==Coventry Victor cars==
By 1926, the company launched a two-seat, three-wheeled car with the single wheel at the rear as the Coventry Victor Midget. There were many versions including, the Standard, the Sports, the Super Sports, the De-luxe, and the Parcelcar; prices started at £75. The cars used variants of their own horizontally-opposed twin-cylinder engines of 688 cc at first, later enlarged to 749 cc, 850 cc and finally 998 cc. These engines included side-valve and overhead valve air cooled versions of the engine (fan assisted), and water cooled versions. Drive was to the rear wheel via a two speed gearbox and chain drive. Early cars had a foot brake operating on the transmission, but later sports model had twin front brakes as well as electric start and reverse gear. There was an update in 1932 with styling by C F Beauvais and called the Luxury Sports with three-speed gearbox and costing from £110. The previous models remained available. Car production survived until 1938. 

After the Second World War, a prototype codenamed Venus was made with flat-four 747 cc engine never reached production. There were six reported Venus prototypes all of which were ordered to be destroyed but one still exists at the Coventry Transport Museum. Little is known about the vehicle but it was found and recovered from a farm in the West Country in the 1980s

==Other products==
Maintaining their preference for the opposed twin cylinder design, Coventry Victor Motor Co built a twin cylinder diesel in the early 1930s known as the Cub. The design of the engine was illustrated in a GB patent by W.A. Weaver, M. Hamilton-Fletcher, and Victor Oil Engine Co in 1933. Bristol Tractor pictured a Cub-engined version of their tractor in 1933, though they fitted several different engines and it&#x27;s not clear how many tractors were produced with the Cub engine. In 1935 the Coventry Victor Cub engine was available as the 19.5 hp Cub and 22 hp Cub Senior (10HP and 12HP nominal rating), and was described as originally having been designed for marine work.

The Victor Cub was promoted in Australia as having been used for cars and marine work and as a stationary power unit. The 1000 cc air-cooled twin-cylinder horizontally opposed engine was rated at 10 hp and gave a peak output of 20 hp at 2800 rpm. It could run at up to 4000 rpm without danger though normally governed to between 2000 and 2800 rpm. The light alloy combined crankcase and water jackets enclosed cast iron wet liner cylinder bores. The horizontally opposed shape of the engine made it particularly suitable to fit Jowett vehicles. It also suited boats of more than 15 tons displacement and an overall length of 34 feet or 10 metres.

In 1938 Bristol Tractor re-introduced the Bristol 10 tractor with the Coventry Victor Cub diesel engine in the model &quot;D&quot;, with production continuing to 1942.

The two Cub engines were in production in 1942 though the company advert states the company making them had recently changed its name from Victor Oil Engines (Coventry) Ltd to Oil Engines (Coventry) Ltd, with the works being Atlantic Works, Harefield Rd, Coventry whereas in 1935 the Cubs were listed as made by Coventry Victor Motor Co Ltd of Cox Street, Coventry. Victor Oil Engines (Coventry) Ltd was a subsidiary of Coventry Victor Motor Co Ltd formed in 1933. By 1949 the production of the Cub engine has changed again, to Cub Oil Engines Ltd, Atlantic Works, Wishaw, Scotland. The Cox Street address still appeared in later adverts for Coventry Victor Motor Co Ltd.

In 1946 &quot;The Engineer&quot; magazine reported that Coventry Victor had added two new small flat twin petrol engines to their range, of 285 cc and 340 cc, known as the &quot;Midget&quot; - the two models only differing in the cylinder bore (55 mm and 60 mm respectively). The crankcases, cylinder heads, and pistons were all of aluminium alloy. The camshaft and crankshaft ran in ball bearings. These were available air-cooled (with added fan and cowling for stationary use), and as water cooled units for marine use which included outboard motors.

After the war, Coventry Victor Motor Co produced a range of petrol and diesel engines for marine and industrial use. The diesel engines included air and water cooled vertical single cylinder units (AD1, AD2, AD3 and WD1, WD2, WD3 models respectively), twin cylinder air-cooled HDA model, and water-cooled HDW models (also known as the Vixen). The petrol engines included twin cylinder air-cooled MA2 and AN4 models, and twin cylinder water-cooled MW2 and WN4 models. The AN4 was used in the 1950s by Thomas Green &amp; Son on their Griffin models PRR and PRY motorised rollers. Coventry Victor also produced a flat-four air-cooled petrol engine (the AC4 or &#x27;Neptune&#x27;), one use of which was in aircraft pressure test trolleys made by Sir George Godfrey &amp; Partners. Major W.A. Weaver (managing director of the Coventry Victor Motor Co) converted one of these in 1955 for use in a Piper Cub aircraft, naming it the &#x27;Flying Neptune&#x27;. Coventry Victor engines were also used in airfield pumping sets and to operate hydraulic ramps such as the Hylo Mk II mobile lifter made by Aviation Traders (Engineering) Ltd in the 1960s.

==Present day==
The Coventry Victor Motor Company Ltd was wound up voluntarily in January 1971. A.N. Weaver (Coventry Victor) Ltd. was formed in July 1971 to provide spares and offer a service to maintain existing engines.

<doc id="855510" wikidata="Q4999164" url="?curid=855510" title="Burling Hull">
<text>Burling Hull (September 9, 1889 – November 1982) was an inventive magician, self-styled &quot;the Edison of magic,&quot; specializing in mentalism and sleight of hand effects. During the greater part of his life he lived in DeLand, Florida. His aliases and stage names included: &quot;Volta the Great&quot;, &quot;The Man with the Radar Mind&quot;, &quot;The White Wizard,&quot; and &quot;Gideon (&#x27;Gid&#x27;) Dayn.&quot;

==Career==
Hull claimed to be — and is generally credited as — the inventor of the Svengali deck of cards, which he patented in 1909. He claimed to have invented more than 500 magical effects and he was a prolific writer, with 52 published books to his name, including &quot;Sealed Mysteries and Sleights&quot;, &quot;The Encyclopedia of Stage Illusions&quot;, &quot;Sealed Mysteries&quot;, and &quot;How to Answer Questions for Crystal Gazing and Mind Reading Acts&quot;. He wrote on a wide variety of magical subjects, including card tricks, mentalism, escapes, razor blade swallowing, sightless vision, billiard ball manipulation, silk magic, second sight acts, publicity, and showmanship.

Hull not only produced many titles about magical effects, he also performed and taught magic for more than 80 years. In his earlier &quot;White Wizard&quot; years, he performed an act dressed entirely in white in which he made billiard balls and silks vanish, multiply, and reappear. In later years he gave talks to magic conventions on business methods for entertainers.

Hull was active in the movement to recognize that there are intellectual rights to magic methods and he was a strong advocate for the protection of magic trade secrets by both patents on the gimmicks and copyright on the texts, as applicable. However, he undercut his own ethical stance against plagiarism by publishing secret material from other magicians who had stolen ideas from him, in order to get revenge for having been plagiarized.

In the late 1950s, Hull published a newsletter, &quot;The G_d D__n Truth About Magic&quot;, mainly for the purpose of criticizing the equally famous mentalist Robert A. Nelson, known on stage as &quot;Korda RaMayne.&quot; Hull used the pseudonym Gideon (&quot;Gid&quot;) Dayn to expose Nelson&#x27;s effects under the pretense of &quot;reviewing&quot; them.

Hull&#x27;s weighty three-volume &quot;Encyclopedic Dictionary of Mentalism&quot;, published in 1961, was the largest compilation of mentalism sleights, gimmicks, effects, patter, and illusions in one collection up to that date. This work was also notable as the venue in which Hull continued to carry out his excoriating feud with Robert Nelson, whom Hull accused in print of teaching mentalism to gamblers and racketeers in order that they might commit what Hull called &quot;thievery of the public.&quot; He also criticised Nelson for selling hoodoo folk magic curios that Hull said were used in rituals of &quot;black magic and Devil worship&quot;.

In his final years, Hull lost his eyesight, a loss he never learned to accept. He died at the age of 93 in a nursing home. Hull&#x27;s life and his impact upon the world of stage magic were described in a 1977 biography, &quot;The Edison of Magic and His Incredible Creations&quot;, written by Samuel Patrick Smith. Both his Svengali Deck of 1909 and his &quot;33 Rope Ties and Chain Releases,&quot; written in 1915, are still popular today. While living in DeLand, the same town as Herbert L Becker, Burling and Becker worked together on illusions for Becker’s tour with Alice Cooper

==Correspondence with Harry Houdini==
Hull was the author of &quot;33 Rope Ties and Chain Releases&quot; (1915). It was alleged that the magician Harry Houdini had borrowed information for his own &quot;Magical Rope Ties and Escapes&quot; (1921). However, a 1947 edition of Hull&#x27;s book has an introduction titled &quot;Houdini Did Not Steal This Book&quot;. According to Hull:

&quot;It is true that a book DID appear with the name of Houdini listed as the &#x27;author&#x27;, which did steal the entire contents of my original book. It purloined the original &#x27;Patter&quot; and the original presentations for the tricks and even reproduced exactly several of the illustrations. In addition this counterfeit book deliberately changed the names of the original tricks bearing my name and avoided giving any credit to the original author and inventor ... But Houdini explained away the matter [and] paid me a fair but moderate sum ... I accepted his explanation as plausible and ... we remained good friends.&quot;

Similar to Houdini, exposing the tricks of spiritualist mediums interested Hull. His writings on this subject were collected and published in 1977 under the title &quot;The Billion Dollar Bait&quot;.

<text>In music history, the Venetian School was the body and work of composers working in Venice from about 1550 to around 1610, many working in the Venetian polychoral style. The Venetian polychoral compositions of the late sixteenth century were among the most famous musical works in Europe, and their influence on musical practice in other countries was enormous. The innovations introduced by the Venetian school, along with the contemporary development of monody and opera in Florence, together define the end of the musical Renaissance and the beginning of the musical Baroque.

==History==
Several major factors came together to create the Venetian School. The first was political: after the death of Pope Leo X in 1521 and the Sack of Rome in 1527, the long dominant musical establishment in Rome was eclipsed: many musicians either moved elsewhere or chose not to go to Rome, and Venice was one of several places to have an environment conducive to creativity.

Another factor, possibly the most important, was the existence of the splendid St Mark&#x27;s Basilica, with its unique interior with opposing choir lofts. Because of the spacious architecture of this basilica, it was necessary to develop a musical style which exploited the sound-delay to advantage, rather than fight against it: thus the Venetian polychoral style was developed, the grand antiphonal style in which groups of singers and instruments played sometimes in opposition, and sometimes together, united by the sound of the organ. The first composer to make this effect famous was Adrian Willaert, who became &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; of St. Mark&#x27;s in 1527, and remained in the position until his death in 1562. Gioseffo Zarlino, one of the most influential writers on music of the age, called Willaert &quot;the new Pythagoras&quot;, and Willaert&#x27;s influence was profound, not only as a composer but as a teacher, since most of the Venetians who followed studied with him.

Yet another factor which promoted the rich period of musical creativity was printing. In the early 16th century, Venice, prosperous and stable, had become an important center of music publishing; composers came from all parts of Europe to benefit from the new technology, which then was only a few decades old. Composers from northern Europe—especially Flanders and France—were already renowned as the most skilled composers in Europe, and many of them came to Venice. The international flavor of musical society in the city was to linger into the 17th century.

In the 1560s, two distinct groups developed within the Venetian school: a progressive group led by Baldassare Donato, and a conservative group led by Zarlino, who was then &quot;maestro di cappella&quot;. Friction between the two groups came to a head in 1569 with a dramatic, public conflict between Donato and Zarlino during the Feast of Saint Mark. Members of the conservative branch tended to follow the style of Franco-Flemish polyphony, and included Cipriano de Rore, Zarlino, and Claudio Merulo; members of the progressive group included Donato, Giovanni Croce, and later Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli. An additional point of contention between the two groups was whether or not Venetians—or at least Italians—should be given the top job of &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at St. Mark&#x27;s. Eventually the group favoring local talent prevailed, ending the dominance of foreign musicians in Venice; in 1603, Giovanni Croce was appointed to the job, followed by Giulio Cesare Martinengo in 1609.

The peak of development of the Venetian School was in the 1580s, when Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli composed enormous works for multiple choirs, groups of brass, string instruments and organ. These works are the first to include dynamics, and are among the first to include specific instructions for ensemble instrumentation. Organists working at the same time included Claudio Merulo and Girolamo Diruta; they began to define an instrumental style and technique which moved to northern Europe in the succeeding generations, culminating in the works of Sweelinck, Buxtehude, and eventually J.S. Bach.

The term Venetian School is sometimes used to distinguish it from the contemporary, and usually more musically conservative, Roman School. Other important centers of musical activity in Italy at the same time included Florence (the birthplace of opera), Ferrara, Naples, Padua, Mantua, and Milan.

<doc id="855539" wikidata="Q1323839" url="?curid=855539" title="Itsukaichi Line">
<text>The is a railway line operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) in Tokyo, Japan. It links Musashi-Itsukaichi Station in the city of Akiruno with Haijima Station in the city of Akishima. From there, some trains travel through to Tachikawa Station via the Ōme Line, and select weekend/holiday services (branded as Holiday Rapid Akigawa) continue from Tachikawa along the Chūō Line to Tokyo Station. This line can only accommodate trains of 4- or 6-car lengths.

== Services ==
=== Itsukaichi Line Local ===
Local trains stop at all stations between Musashi-Itsukaichi and Haijima.

=== Through services ===
The Itsukaichi Line, at times, runs through services along the Ōme Line . All through services into the Itsukaichi Line stop at every station on this line.

* Ōme - Itsukaichi Line through service: Some Itsukaichi Line operate through service to the Ōme Line via Haijima. They operate between Musashi-Itsukaichi and Tachikawa.

==== Former through services ====
*Chūō - Ōme - Itsukaichi Line through service: At rush hours, a few Chūō Line trains ran through services between Tokyo and the Itsukaichi Line via Haijima. These services were always joined with another through service train, which coupled / decoupled at Haijima. During morning rush, some trains from Musashi-Itsukaichi on the Itsukaichi Line, and another train from Ōme on the Ōme Line, or from Hakonegasaki / Komagawa on the Hachiko Line, coupled at Haijima, and headed for Tokyo. During evening rush, the reverse occurred. These trains operated until 11 March 2022.

=== &quot;Holiday Rapid Akigawa&quot; ===
Until 18 March 2023, &quot;Holiday Rapid&quot; &quot;Akigawa&quot; services ran on weekends on this line. See the article for more information.

==Stations==
All stations are located in Tokyo, and all services stop at every station.
An extension, via a switchback, formerly operated to Musashi-Iwai Station. It closed to passenger traffic in 1971 and to freight in 1982.

==History==

The Itsukaichi Line was built by the Itsukaichi Railway in 1925. In 1930, all sections (Tachikawa - Haijima - Musashi-Itsukaichi - Musashi-Iwai) were opened. There were two competing railways between Tachikawa and Haijima: the Ōme Electric Railway (now the Ōme Line) and the Itsukaichi Railway. In 1940, the Itsukaichi Railway was taken over by the Nambu Railway, becoming the Nambu Railway Itsukaichi Line. In 1944, Nambu Railway was nationalized and this line became the JGR Itsukaichi Line. At the same time, the section of the line between Tachikawa and Haijima was deemed non-essential and closed. However, the Tachikawa - Musashi-Uenohara and Musahi-Uenohara - Nishi-Tachikawa sections of the former Nambu Railway are still used by Chūō Main Line and Nambu Line trains traveling to and from the southern area of Tachikawa Station.

===Chronology===
*24 April 1925: Itsukaichi Railway opens between Haijima (temporary) and Itsukaichi stations (). Haijima (temporary), Higashi-Akiru, Nishi-Akiru, Masuko, and Itsukaichi stations open.
*15 May 1925: Extension from Haijima (temporary) Station to Haijima Station opens; Haijima (temporary) Station closes.

<text>In music, the Phrygian dominant scale (or the Phrygian ♮3 scale) is the actual fifth mode of the harmonic minor scale, the fifth being the dominant. It is also called the harmonic dominant, altered Phrygian scale, dominant flat 2 flat 6 (in jazz), or Freygish scale (also spelled Fraigish). It resembles the Phrygian mode but with a major third, rather than a minor third. The augmented second between its second and third scale degrees gives it an &quot;Arabic&quot; or Middle Eastern feeling to Western listeners.

In the Berklee method, it is known as the Mixolydian 9 13 chord scale, a Mixolydian scale with a lowered 9th (2nd) and lowered 13th (6th), used in secondary dominant chord scales for V7/III and V7/VI.

== Construction ==
Built on C, the scale is as follows.
: &lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; {
 \clef treble \time 7/4
 c4^\markup { Phrygian dominant scale on C } des e f g aes bes c2
&lt;/score&gt;
When related to the scale degrees of the major scale, it reads:
:1 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 5 – 6 – 7 – 1
The sequence of steps forming the Phrygian dominant scale is:
*half – augmented second – half – whole – half – whole – whole

==Traditional use==
This scale occurs in Indian, Middle Eastern, Balkan, Eastern European, Central Asian, and flamenco music. It is also present in Arabic and Egyptian music, in which it is called &quot;Hijaz-Nahawand&quot; or &quot;Hijaz maqam&quot;, but is not so frequent. The scale is used in Hebrew prayers and Klezmer music as well, where it is known as &quot;Ahava Rabbah&quot;, &quot;Freygish&quot; or just the &quot;Jewish scale&quot;, and is called &quot;Dastgāh-e Homāyoun&quot; in Iran. It is the most common scale in North Indian classical raga &quot;Hijaz Bhairav (Basant Mukhari)&quot; and South Indian raga &quot;Vakulabharanam&quot;.

It is sometimes called the &quot;Spanish Phrygian scale&quot;, &quot;Spanish Gypsy scale&quot; (see: gypsy scale) or &quot;Phrygian major scale&quot; (see: phrygian mode and major scale) and is common in flamenco music. It can also be found in traditional Spanish songs outside flamenco, everywhere in Spain to varying amounts, but especially in southern and central areas of the country, often being also known as &quot;escala andaluza&quot; (&quot;Andalusian scale&quot;) in Spanish. Related scales in Spanish traditional music with chromatic notes in the second degree, varying between a semitone and a tone, are also known as &quot;gama española&quot; (&quot;Spanish gamut&quot;) or &quot;gama de Castilla y León&quot; (gamut of Castile and León) and, though found all over Spain, are particularly common in Castilian and Leonese traditional songs.

The flatted second and the augmented second between the second and third scale degrees of the scale create its distinctive sound. Examples include some versions of &quot;Hava Nagila&quot;, &quot;Sha Shtil&quot; and &quot;Misirlou&quot;, while other versions of those melodies use the closely related &quot;double harmonic scale&quot;. The main chords derived from this scale are I, II, iv, and vii.

When the Freygish scale is used in Klezmer music, the sixth degree may be left unflatted if it is melodically approached and left from above, or the seventh degree may be raised as well.

The Phrygian dominant scale is often used in jazz composition and improvisation over secondary dominants of minor chords in a major key, such as the VI7 chord in a VI7-ii7-V7-I progression. Some modal jazz compositions, such as &quot;Nardis&quot; by Miles Davis, are composed in the Phrygian dominant mode.

<doc id="855544" wikidata="Q4879598" url="?curid=855544" title="Beech River">
<text>The Beech River is a stream draining the east-central portion of West Tennessee in the United States. The Beech rises about northwest of Lexington, Tennessee. In the same area are the headwaters of two other West Tennessee rivers, the Big Sandy River and the Middle Fork of the Forked Deer River. The Big Sandy, like the Beech, is part of the Tennessee River system, whereas the Forked Deer system drains into the Mississippi River.

The Beech River was named for the beech timber along its course.

==Hydrography==

The Beech flows southeast into the town of Lexington and then primarily eastward. As is typical of most major streams in West Tennessee, much of the lower course was the subject of a channelization project in the mid-20th century conducted largely for agricultural purposes; this has resulted in a considerable loss of wetland. The stream crosses into Decatur County, flowing in between Parsons and Decaturville. The large embayment formed at the mouth of the Beech is the result of the backwaters of the Kentucky Dam project many miles downstream on the Tennessee; the embayment reaches the outskirts of both towns.

==Dams==

The Beech River system is somewhat unusual in that it and all of its major tributaries (a total of eight) are impounded, one of them twice, primarily by dams built in the mid 20th century as part of the Tennessee Valley Authority&#x27;s Beech River Project—Beech, Cedar, Dogwood, Lost Creek (which has no permanent reservoir), Pin Oak, Pine, Redbud, and Sycamore. The dams are purely for purposes of flood control and recreation, though it is possible that the relatively small volume of water they store could result in some minimal aid to navigation on the Tennessee under some conditions. Unlike most other TVA dams, none of the Beech River dams are used for hydropower, since the small size of the streams impounded and their relative lack of fall would make power generation impractical. Some of the lakes created are located in Natchez Trace State Park, the largest of the Tennessee state parks; though located many miles west of both the Natchez Trace Parkway and the historic Natchez Trace, this area is named for a branch of the historic Trace that bore that name in the area.

<text>Hugh Amos Robson (September 9, 1871July 9, 1945) was a politician and judge in Manitoba. He briefly served as leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party in the 1920s.

==Career==
Hugh Amos Robson was born in Barrow-in-Furness, England, on September 9, 1871. The son of Robert Robson, he came to Canada with his family in 1882, studied law in Regina, was called to the bar for the Northwest Territories in 1892 and practised in the Northwest Territories, moving to Winnipeg in 1899. Robson married Fannie Laidlaw in 1897. He was named to the Court of King&#x27;s Bench on June 23, 1910, and then served as head of the Manitoba public utilities commission from 1911 to 1914.

The Manitoba Liberals were in government between 1915 and 1922, but lost much of their support to the United Farmers of Manitoba (later called the Progressives) in the early 1920s. Despite Premier Tobias Norris&#x27;s personal popularity, the Liberals were reduced to only eight seats in the province&#x27;s 55-member legislature following the election of 1922.

Norris remained party leader until 1927, but stepped down shortly before that year&#x27;s election. He was replaced by Robson, who seems to have been chosen because of his status as a &quot;respected outsider&quot;, and because he was regarded (incorrectly) as favouring cooperation with the Progressives. He had no experience as a provincial politician, but was a leading figure in the province&#x27;s legal system.

Robson was elected a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba on June 28, 1927, during the 1927 Manitoba general election. He led the Liberal ticket in Winnipeg, and placed second on the city&#x27;s multi-member ballot (Winnipeg elections were determined by a form of proportional representation at the time). He was only able to elect one other Liberal in the city, however, and his party won only seven seats throughout the province. Robson left the Legislative Assembly in January 1930, becoming a judge of the Manitoba Court of Appeal that month. He served on the court until March 1944, later becoming a chief justice of Manitoba.

Robson died on July 9, 1945, at the Winnipeg General Hospital, aged 74.

Robson Hall at the University of Manitoba is named in his honour.

<text>Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are synthetic organic compounds that contain fluorine and hydrogen atoms, and are the most common type of organofluorine compounds. Most are gases at room temperature and pressure. They are frequently used in air conditioning and as refrigerants; R-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane) is one of the most commonly used HFC refrigerants. In order to aid the recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer, HFCs were adopted to replace the more potent chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were phased out from use by the Montreal Protocol, and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) which are presently being phased out. HFCs replaced older chlorofluorocarbons such as R-12 and hydrochlorofluorocarbons such as R-21. HFCs are also used in insulating foams, aerosol propellants, as solvents and for fire protection.

They may not harm the ozone layer as much as the compounds they replace, but they still contribute to global warming --- with some like trifluoromethane having 11,700 times the warming potential of carbon dioxide. Their atmospheric concentrations and contribution to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are rapidly increasing --- consumption rose from near zero in 1990 to 1.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2010 --- causing international concern about their radiative forcing.

==Chemistry==

Fluorocarbons with few C–F bonds behave similarly to the parent hydrocarbons, but their reactivity can be altered significantly. For example, both uracil and 5-fluorouracil are colourless, high-melting crystalline solids, but the latter is a potent anti-cancer drug. The use of the C-F bond in pharmaceuticals is predicated on this altered reactivity. Several drugs and agrochemicals contain only one fluorine center or one trifluoromethyl group.

==Environmental regulation==

Unlike other greenhouse gases in the Paris Agreement, hydrofluorocarbons are included in other international negotiations.

In September 2016, the New York Declaration on Forests urged a global reduction in the use of HFCs. On 15 October 2016, due to these chemicals&#x27; contribution to climate change, negotiators from 197 nations meeting at a summit of the United Nations Environment Programme in Kigali, Rwanda reached a legally-binding accord (the Kigali Amendment) to phase down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in an amendment to the Montreal Protocol. As of February 2020, 16 U.S. states ban or are phasing down HFCs.

COVID-19 relief legislation, which included a measure that would require chemical manufacturers to phase down the production and use of HFCs, was passed by the United States House of Representatives and United States Senate on December 21, 2020. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency signed a final rule phasing down HFCs on 23 September 2021.

<doc id="855563" wikidata="Q7443488" url="?curid=855563" title="Second Schweinfurt raid">
<text>The second Schweinfurt raid, also called Black Thursday, was a World War II air battle that took place on 14 October 1943, over Nazi Germany between forces of the United States 8th Air Force and German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; fighter arm (&quot;Jagdwaffe&quot;). The American bombers conducted a strategic bombing raid on ball bearing factories to reduce production of these vital parts used in all manner of war machines. This was the second attack on the factories at Schweinfurt. American wartime intelligence claimed the first Schweinfurt–Regensburg mission in August had reduced bearing production by 34 percent but had cost many bombers. A planned follow-up raid had to be postponed to rebuild American forces.

As the squadrons rebuilt, plans for the return mission were modified based on the lessons learned. Planners added additional fighter escorts to cover the outward and return legs of the operation and sent the entire force against Schweinfurt alone, instead of splitting the force. Despite these changes, a series of minor mishaps combined with the ever-increasing efficiency of the German anti-aircraft effort proved to be devastating. Of the 291 B-17 Flying Fortresses sent on the mission, 60 were lost, another 17 damaged so heavily that they had to be scrapped and another 121 had varying degrees of battle damage. Losses represented over 26 percent of the attacking force and losses in aircrew were equally severe, with 650 men lost of 2,900, 22 percent of the bomber crews. The American Official History of the Army Air Forces in the Second World War acknowledged losses had been so great that the USAAF would not return to the target for four months, &quot;The fact was that the Eighth Air Force had for the time being lost air superiority over Germany&quot;.

The operation was a failure. The bomber formations were left exposed to attacks by German fighters and the faulty preparations for the creation of reserves in the summer of 1943 meant that such costly operations could not be sustained. An escort of 24 squadrons of Spitfires equipped with drop tanks was provided on the first and last leg of the mission.

The strategy of the Allied air forces was flawed. Arthur Harris, Air Officer Commanding RAF Bomber Command questioned the intelligence that claimed ball bearings to be vital to the German war economy. Harris refused to cooperate with the Americans, believing ball bearing targets to be a &quot;panacea&quot;. Post-war analysis has shown Harris&#x27;s objections to be correct. The Germans had built up enormous reserves of ball bearings and were receiving supplies from all over Europe, particularly Italy, Sweden and Switzerland. The operation against these industries would, even if successful, have achieved little. By 1945, the Germans had assembled more reserves than ever.

==Background==

Factories in and around Schweinfurt accounted for a significant amount of German ball bearing production. The Kugelfischer plant produced 22 percent, the &quot;Vereinigte Kugellagerfabriken&quot; I and II produced 20 percent, and another one percent came from the Fichtel &amp; Sachs factory. After the supposed German ball bearing &quot;bottleneck&quot; had been identified in 1942 and ball bearings had been named the second-most-vital Pointblank industry for the Combined Bomber Offensive in March 1943, Schweinfurt&#x27;s ball bearing plants were selected for a second air raid after being bombed during the August Schweinfurt–Regensburg mission.

==Mission==
Each of the three bomber wings was to be escorted by fighters from a group with several squadrons of P-47 Thunderbolts. The fighters were inexplicably not employing drop tanks which limited their escort range. One fighter outfit was diverted to escort a squadron of 29 B-24s that switched to a spoof mission to Emden because of the bad weather forecast. Some 229 of 291 B-17s hit the city area and ball bearing plants at Schweinfurt in two groups: the first group bombed at 14:39–14:45 hours, the second group at 14:51–14:57 hours. They claimed 186 Luftwaffe aircraft - more than four times the Germans&#x27; actual losses of 35–38 aircraft. Sixty B-17s were lost, two damaged beyond repair and 13 damaged; casualties amounted to five KIA, 40 WIA and 594 MIA.
The bomber formations were spread out and vulnerable because of bad weather. The Luftwaffe military intelligence officers had suspected a deep penetration air raid because of the substantial amount of bombers. Jagdgeschwader 3 &quot;Udet&quot; intercepted the bombers as they crossed the coast but P-47s shot down seven Bf 109s while losing just one P-47. A P-47 was also lost when it crashed at Herongate and another during a one-wheel landing at base. Over the Netherlands elements of two more &quot;named&quot; Luftwaffe fighter wings, JG 1 &quot;Oesau&quot; and JG 26 &quot;Schlageter&quot; made repeated attacks. The 305th Bomb Group lost 13 of its 16 B-17s in minutes. The B-17s were attacked after bombing by fighters that had refueled and rearmed (JG 11 shot down 18 B-17s).

Sixty bombers were shot down by German fighters and flak and 12 bombers were damaged so badly that they crashed upon return or had to be scrapped. Another 121 bombers returned with moderate damage. Of 2,900 crew, about 254 did not return (65 survived as prisoners-of-war), while five killed-in-action and 43 wounded were in the damaged aircraft that returned (594 were listed as missing-in-action). Among the most seriously affected American units was the 306th Bomb Group. It lost 100 men, 35 killed on the mission or died of wounds and 65 were captured. The 305th Bomb Group lost 130 men (87%), with 36 killed.

The defensive efforts of both JG 1 and JG 11 during the &quot;Black Thursday&quot; raid are said to have included substantial use of the BR 21 unguided stand-off rockets against the USAAF combat boxes, as both Luftwaffe fighter wings had been using the rockets for about six months.

==Aftermath==

Although the Schweinfurt factories were badly hit, the mission failed to achieve any lasting effect. The production of ball bearings in the factories was halted for only 6 weeks and Germany&#x27;s war industry could easily rely on its substantial inventory of ball bearings as well as a large production surplus. In addition, the ball bearing facilities were dispersed to reduce their bombing risk. Despite General Henry H. Arnold&#x27;s claim that the Black Thursday &quot;&quot;loss of 60 &quot;[downed/ditched]&quot; American bombers in the Schweinfurt raid was incidental&quot;&quot;, unescorted daylight bomber raids deep into Germany were suspended until the February 1944 Big Week missions with P-51B Mustang escorts that included additional Schweinfurt day/night USAAF/RAF bombing on 24 February.

Another example of the strategy of using heavy bombers against a particular wartime resource, the Oil Campaign of World War II was essentially started by RAF Bomber Command in August 1941 – two months after Hitler&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union, and six months before the United States entered the war. It went forward relentlessly from that time with the USAAF joining in on the efforts by late June 1943 during daylight. The Oil Campaign had its priority diminished from time to time with important events, such as the lead-up to Operation Overlord, which by June 1944 demanded heavy bomber support for a time, but soon thereafter the relentless attacks by day and night resumed, starving the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; of fuel and lubricants from the autumn of 1944.

<doc id="855564" wikidata="Q63707" url="?curid=855564" title="How the Steel Was Tempered">
<text>How the Steel Was Tempered () or The Making of a Hero, is a socialist realist novel written by Nikolai Ostrovsky (1904–1936). With 36.4 million copies sold, it is one of the best-selling books of all time and the best-selling book in the Russian language.

== Summary ==
The story follows the life of Pavel Korchagin, including his fighting in and aftermath of the Russian Civil War when he fought for the Bolsheviks during the war and was injured. The novel examines how Korchagin heals from his wounds and thus becomes as strong as steel.

The novel begins when Korchagin is 12, living in the town of Shepetovka in Ukraine. He gets kicked out of school for putting tobacco in some bread dough and must go to work as a dishwasher. As a dishwasher he is beaten by a coworker, but his brother Artyom defends him. The novel jumps forward to age 16 when he is working in a power plant. He meets a Bolshevik named Zhukhrai after a run-in with the Tsarist secret police. Zhukrai tells him about the Bolsheviks and Lenin. He also meets Tonia Toumanova, his first of many love interests. Again the novel jumps, to 1917 as the German army invades Shepetovka. Korchagin witnesses the town change hands several times in the chaos of the following months, with a pogrom against the town&#x27;s Jewish population occurring during its occupation by soldiers loyal to Symon Petliura. Korchagin eventually joins the Bolsheviks and fights in the Civil War and Polish-Soviet War. He receives an injury in his spine, which slowly saps his strength for the remainder of the novel. After the war he works as a railway mechanic and advances as a Komsomol member in Kyiv. He develops many social connections there but loses touch with many of his friends after he is presumed dead during work to build an emergency railway line to provide Shepetovka with firewood. As his health worsens due to his life of hardship and wartime injuries, he spends time in Sanatoria on the Black Sea coast, where he eventually meets and marries the young daughter of a friend of his mother&#x27;s. Eventually, having lost his eyesight and almost totally paralyzed, Pavel moves to Moscow to consult medical specialists, but his condition is hopeless and he ends up staying there to write a novel about his cavalry division from the Civil War.

==Analysis==

The story is a fictionalized autobiography of its author, Nikolai Ostrovsky. In real life, Ostrovsky&#x27;s father died, and his mother worked as a cook. As he joined the war with the Red Army, he lost his right eye from artillery fire during the war.

In 2016, Russia&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Russia Beyond The Headlines&quot; analyzed the story as part of the Soviet narrative of Communism forging uncivilized men into ideal men, like iron into steel. The protagonist fits the mold of pre-Khrushchev literature: an immaculate, ideally communistic individual.

==Characters==

* Pavel Korchagin – The novel&#x27;s protagonist. He is fighting on the Bolsheviks&#x27; side in the Civil War (1917–1922). He is a quintessential positive hero of socialist realism.
* Tonia Toumanova – Pavel&#x27;s teenage love. Tonia and Pavel became good friends after their first encounter, which later develops into an intimate relationship. Though born of a wealthy and influential family, Tonia treated everyone equally unlike her friends, who only interact with other children of well-reputed families. However, this changed as she grew up, as she became more aware of her appearance and social status of others.

==Publication history==
The first part of &quot;How the Steel was Tempered&quot; was published serially in 1932 in the magazine &quot;Young Guard&quot;. The second part of the novel appeared in the same magazine from January to May, 1934. The novel was published in 1936 in book form in a heavily edited version that conformed to the rules of socialist realism. In the serial version Ostrovsky had described the tense atmosphere of Pavel&#x27;s home, his suffering when he became an invalid, the deterioration of his relationship with his wife, and their separation. All of this disappeared in the 1936 publication and in later editions of the novel.

A Japanese translation of the novel was made by .

==Adaptations==
In the Soviet Union, three films were produced based on this novel:
*&quot;How the Steel Was Tempered&quot; (1942)
*&quot;Pavel Korchagin&quot; (1956, Korchagin was played by Vasily Lanovoy)
* &quot;How the Steel Was Tempered&quot;, 1973 (TV series of 6 episodes; Korchagin was played by Vladimir Konkin)

In China, the novel was adapted into a television series of the same title in 2000; all the members of the cast were from Ukraine.

==In other media==
* The third studio album of Russian experimental group Shortparis is titled &quot;Tak zakalyalas stal&quot; (Russian: Так закалялась сталь, lit. &#x27;Thus the Steel Was Tempered&#x27;) (2019).

<text>The Cosmic Rough Riders are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland. They were originally formed in 1998 by Daniel Wylie and Stephen Fleming, and later they were joined by Mark Brown, James Clifford, Gary Cuthbert and Paul Docherty. To date they have recorded five albums, and had four singles in the UK top 40.

==Recording history==
They self-released the albums &quot;Deliverance&quot; (1999) and &quot;Panorama&quot; (2000), both having been recorded in a community funded recording studio located in Glasgow&#x27;s Castlemilk housing scheme. Both albums were named in Virgin&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopaedia of the Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

Cosmic Rough Riders signed a one album license deal with Poptones Records, the newly formed label of ex-Creation Records boss Alan McGee, who released the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Enjoy the Melodic Sunshine&quot; in November 2000, actually a compilation of songs from &quot;Panorama&quot; and &quot;Deliverance&quot;. 

Single releases in 2001 earned them increasing numbers of fans in the press. Their single &quot;Revolution (In the Summertime?)&quot; was released and went into the UK Singles Chart, scoring them their first Top 40 hit and debut on BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. This was immediately followed into the chart by &quot;The Pain Inside&quot;, giving them back-to-back Top 40 hit single success.

By the end of 2001, the album &quot;Enjoy the Melodic Sunshine&quot; had achieved silver status (sales of 60,000) in the UK and it was named by &quot;Q&quot; magazine as one of the 50 best albums of the year.

In March 2002, founder member of Cosmic Rough Riders, Stephen Fleming added lead vocals to his duties when original singer, Daniel Wylie, left to pursue a solo career. The release in September 2002 of the rarities and b-sides album, &quot;Pure Escapism&quot;, was the closing of one chapter in the band&#x27;s story. 

June 2003 saw the release of &quot;Because You&quot;. It entered the UK Singles Chart at number 34 – becoming the band&#x27;s third successive Top 40 hit and their highest entry yet. 

The self-written and self-produced album, &quot;Too Close to See Far&quot; was released by Measured Records in July 2003. The entire album was play-listed by BBC Radio 2 and on its release, entered the UK&#x27;s official independent chart at number 7. A second single from the album was released in September 2003, and &quot;Justify the Rain&quot; entered the UK Singles Chart, giving the band four Top 40 hits in a row. 2003 ended with Cosmic Rough Riders being the recipients of the best newcomer award at the Tartan Clef Awards ceremony, an event that raised over £100,000 for the charity, Nordoff Robbins Music Therapy. The band were presented with their award by Scotland&#x27;s First Minister, Jack McConnell.

During 2005 the band wrote and recorded a new album, &quot;The Stars Look Different from Down Here&quot;, in southern Spain. The album was released in May 2006.

==Touring history==

The Cosmic Rough Riders have performed at major UK music festivals including Carling Weekend, Glasgow Green and T In The Park. The band have played at the Norwegian festival Quart; plus two Japanese festivals, Summersonic and Fuji Rock. They have appeared as guests of several other touring artists, including the Black Crowes, Ocean Colour Scene, Stereophonics, Paul Weller, Robert Plant, Lenny Kravitz, and were twice invited to appear as special guests of U2 when they performed in Scotland. When they made a special appearance at Glasgow Barrowlands as part of a show paying tribute to the Scottish singer-songwriter Frankie Miller, they were joined onstage by Joe Walsh (Eagles). He played guitar on the track &quot;When I&#x27;m Away From You&quot;, recorded by Cosmic Rough Riders, and released on a Frankie Miller tribute album.

<text>Nagios is an event monitoring system that offers monitoring and alerting services for servers, switches, applications and services. It alerts users when things go wrong and alerts them a second time when the problem has been resolved. 

Ethan Galstad and a group of developers originally wrote Nagios as &quot;NetSaint&quot;. , they actively maintain both the official and unofficial plugins. Nagios is a recursive acronym: &quot;Nagios Ain&#x27;t Gonna Insist On Sainthood&quot; – &quot;sainthood&quot; makes reference to the original name &quot;NetSaint&quot;, which changed in response to a legal challenge by owners of a similar trademark. &quot;Agios&quot; (or &quot;hagios&quot;) also transliterates the Greek word &quot;άγιος&quot;, which means &quot;saint&quot;.

Nagios was originally designed to run under Linux, but it also runs on other Unix variants. It is free software licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 as published by the Free Software Foundation.

== History ==

On 16 January 2014, Nagios Enterprises redirected the nagios-plugins.org domain to a web server controlled by Nagios Enterprises without explicitly notifying the Nagios Plugins community team the consequences of their actions. Nagios Enterprises replaced the nagios-plugins team with a group of new, different members. The community team members who were replaced continued their work under the name Monitoring Plugins along with a different website with the new domain of monitoring-plugins.org.

== Design ==

Nagios agents include:

; NRPE: Nagios Remote Plugin Executor (NRPE) is a Nagios agent that allows remote system monitoring using scripts that are hosted on the remote systems. It allows for monitoring of resources such as disk usage, system load or the number of users currently logged in. Nagios periodically polls the agent on remote system using the codice_1 plugin. NRPE allows you to remotely execute Nagios plugins on other Linux/Unix machines. This would allow you to monitor remote machine metrics (disk usage, CPU load, etc.). NRPE can also communicate with some Windows agent add-ons, so you can execute scripts and check metrics on remote Windows machines, as well. As of 28 Jan 2020, NRPE 4.0.1 has been deprecated.
; NRDP: Nagios Remote Data Processor (NRDP) is a Nagios agent with a flexible data transport mechanism and processor. It is designed with an architecture that allows it to be easily extended and customized. NRDP uses standard ports and protocols (HTTP and XML) and can be implemented as a replacement for Nagios Service Check Acceptor (NSCA).
; NSClient++: This program is mainly used to monitor Windows machines. Being installed on a remote system, NSClient++ listens to port TCP 12489. The Nagios plugin that is used to collect information from this addon is called codice_2. As NRPE, NSClient++ allows to monitor the so-called &#x27;private services&#x27; (memory usage, CPU load, disk usage, running processes, etc.) Nagios is a host and service monitor that is designed to inform you of network problems.
; NCPA: The Nagios Cross Platform Agent is an open source project maintained by Nagios Enterprises. NCPA installs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. Created as a scale-able API that allows flexibility and simplicity in monitoring hosts. NCPA allows multiple checks such as memory usage, CPU usage, disk usage, processes, services, and network usage. Active checks are queried through the API of the &quot;NCPA Listener&quot; service while passive checks are sent via the &quot;NCPA Passive&quot; service.

==Nagios XI==

Nagios XI is a proprietary interface using Nagios Core as the back-end, written and maintained by the original author, Ethan Galstad, and Nagios Enterprises. CentOS and RHEL are the currently supported operating systems. It combines Nagios Core with other technologies. Its main database and the ndoutils module that is used alongside Nagios Core use MySQL. While the front-end of Nagios Core is mainly CGI with some PHP, most of the Nagios XI front-end and back-end are written in PHP including the subsystem, event handlers, and notifications, and Python is used to create capacity planning reports and other reports. RRDtool and Highcharts are included to create customizable graphs that can be displayed in dashboards.

<doc id="855574" wikidata="Q1262246" url="?curid=855574" title="Svengali">
<text>Svengali () is a character in the novel &quot;Trilby&quot; which was first published in 1894 by George du Maurier. Svengali is a Jewish man who seduces, dominates and exploits Trilby, a young half-Irish girl, and makes her into a famous singer.

== Definition ==
After the book&#x27;s publication in 1894, the word &quot;&quot; has come to refer to a person who, with evil intent, dominates, manipulates and controls another.

In court, the &quot;Svengali defence&quot; is a legal tactic that portrays the defendant as a pawn in the scheme of a greater, and more influential, criminal mastermind.

==Novel==
Svengali is a stereotypical antisemitic portrayal of an Ashkenazic (Eastern European) Jew, complete with &quot;bold, black, beady Jew&#x27;s eyes&quot; and a &quot;hoarse, rasping, nasal, throaty rook&#x27;s caw, his big yellow teeth baring themselves in a mongrel canine snarl&quot;. He is continually filthy and yet still &quot;clean enough to suit (his own) kind&quot;. George Orwell wrote that Svengali, who while cleverer than the Englishmen, is evil, effeminate, and physically repugnant, was &quot;a sinister caricature of the traditional type&quot; and an example of &quot;the prevailing form of antisemitism.&quot;

In the novel, Svengali transforms Trilby into a great singer by using hypnosis. Unable to perform without Svengali&#x27;s help, Trilby becomes entranced.

==Portrayals==
Svengali was almost immediately stripped of his Jewishness in portrayals. Svengali was first portrayed by the English actor Herbert Beerbohm Tree in London and by the actor Wilton Lackaye in the United States in the stage play of 1895, &quot;Trilby&quot;. The story has also been used in several movies.

The character was portrayed in the following films which were all titled &quot;Svengali&quot;: first by Ferdinand Bonn in the silent film of 1914, then by Paul Wegener in the silent film of 1927, by John Barrymore in 1931, by Donald Wolfit in 1954 (in Technicolor), and by Peter O&#x27;Toole in the film of 1983, which was a modernised version made for television and co-starred Jodie Foster. In the movie of March 1983 however, the names of the characters were changed.

The character &quot;Levi Svengali&quot; was portrayed by actor and director Ash Avildsen in the television series &quot;Paradise City&quot; released by Amazon Prime Video in March 2021.

<doc id="855580" wikidata="Q331474" url="?curid=855580" title="Joe Cahill">
<text>Joe Cahill (; 19 May 1920 – 23 July 2004) was a prominent figure in the Irish republican movement in Northern Ireland and former chief of staff of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). He joined a junior-republican movement, Na Fianna Eireann, in 1937 and the following year, joined the Irish Republican Army. In 1969, Cahill was a key figure in the founding of the Provisional Irish Republican Army. During his time in the Provisional IRA, Cahill helped import weapons and raise financial support. He served as the chief of staff in 1972, but was arrested the following year when a ship importing weapons was intercepted.

After his release, he continued to serve on the IRA Army Council and lead all financial dealings for Sinn Féin. In the 1990s, the IRA and Sinn Féin began to work on seeking peace. Cahill served on the council that called a cessation on 21 July 1997. Cahill attended several of the talks that finally led to the Good Friday Agreement on 10 April 1998. Shortly after the agreement was made, Cahill resigned as treasurer of Sinn Féin. To honour his service, he was made honorary Sinn Féin vice-president for life. Cahill served the republican movement in Ireland all his life, as one of the longest-serving political activists in Ireland of any political party.

== Background ==
Cahill was born above his father&#x27;s small printing shop at 60 Divis Street on 19 May 1920 in West Belfast.

Cahill was the first child of eleven siblings born to Joseph and Josephine Cahill. Both of his parents supported republicanism. Cahill spoke of his family&#x27;s interest in Irish culture and history: &quot;I was always taught to attend to things that were Irish. For instance, do Irish dancing. Do Irish things, a lot. In the house there would be lots of Irish history books. You wouldn&#x27;t be forced to read them, but because they were in the house you would naturally read them. I suppose from that point of view there was a certain amount of indoctrination.&quot; His father was involved with the Irish National Volunteers and would print republican material at his print shop. Joseph Senior applied to be a part of the Irish Republican Army but was asked to remain in the print business as his way of assisting the republican movement. He was arrested in 1932 for printing illegal material, but was acquitted for any crimes. Cahill&#x27;s childhood was marked by hardship and his family was very poor. Cahill&#x27;s grandparents were neighbours of the Scottish-born Irish socialist and Easter Rising leader James Connolly, who co-founded the Irish Citizens Army.

Cahill was educated at St. Mary&#x27;s Christian Brothers&#x27; School, then located on Barrack Street. At age 14 he left school to assist in the print shop. Soon after, he joined the Catholic Young Men&#x27;s Society, which campaigned on social issues with a focus on eradicating moneylenders from working-class areas of Belfast, as they often charged usurious interest rates. At the age of seventeen, Cahill then joined Na Fianna Eireann, a republican-orientated Scouting movement. Na Fianna Eireann was regarded as the &quot;Junior Irish Republican Army&quot;.

==Early paramilitary career==
The following year, 1938, at the age of 18, Cahill joined the local Clonard-based &#x27;C&#x27; Company of the Belfast Brigade of the Irish Republican Army. By 1942, Cahill was serving as second in command. That year, during an anniversary march by the IRA for the Easter Rising, Cahill got into a shootout with five other IRA men against four Royal Ulster Constabulary Officers. Several men were wounded and Constable Patrick Murphy was killed. Cahill and four of the other men spent time in prison in Belfast, where they were interrogated daily. Tom Williams, the sixth IRA man to be charged, spent time in the Royal Victoria Hospital due to his injuries. It was there that he made a statement taking full responsibility for killing Constable Patrick Murphy. All six men were found guilty and sentenced to death in August 1942. The men&#x27;s legal team managed to suspend the execution date after the verdict. An appeal campaign began and 207,000 signatures were collected. The United States State Department and the Vatican also supported the campaign. As a result, the men&#x27;s sentences were changed to life in prison, except for Tom Williams who was executed.

The IRA declared a formal ceasefire in 1945. Afterwards, republican prisoners began to be released. Cahill, Perry, Oliver, Cordner and Simpson, who had all been sentenced to life in prison, became free men in October 1949. Following his release from prison, Cahill got a job at the Harland and Wolff shipyards in Belfast. It was at the shipyards where he was said to have contracted the disease asbestosis, one of the causes of his death many years later.

In 1953, Cahill had an accident on the job when he was hit on the head by scaffolding. He subsequently spent time recovering in a convalescent home. After he recovered, he travelled to Leixlip near Dublin to visit his aunt. It was there that he met Annie Magee. Joe and Annie were married on 2 April 1956 in St John&#x27;s Church on the Falls Road in Belfast. Together they had seven children. Annie was said to be his best friend.

The IRA launched a new campaign in 1956. The IRA border campaign attacked ten targets in Northern Ireland, damaging bridges, courthouses and border roads. By 1957, three RUC officers and seven republicans had been killed during the campaign. Cahill was arrested and interned in January 1957 with several other republicans. In the same year, Cahill&#x27;s first son was born and was named Thomas, after Tom Williams. Cahill was released from internment in April 1961.

==Founding the Provisional IRA==
Following his release from prison, Cahill was disappointed at the direction of the IRA. They had given up armed struggle, and desired seats in elections. Failed campaigns led to the IRA becoming weak and disorganised. Cahill resigned from the IRA around 1962.

In August 1969, intense rioting broke out in Northern Ireland, the most violent being in Belfast. In the 1969 Northern Ireland riots, Cahill, along with Billy McKee, tried to defend the Catholic Clonard area from attack, but was unable to prevent Bombay Street being burned by Ulster Protestant rioters. When he subsequently tried to organise the defence of the Ballymurphy area, he was initially chased away by its Catholic residents. The 1969 Northern Ireland riots displaced 1,800 families from their homes. It was a humiliation for the IRA and made evident that they could not protect their people. The slogan &#x27;IRA: I Ran Away&#x27; was painted on walls all over Belfast. The riots were said to be the beginning of &quot;the Troubles&quot; in Northern Ireland.

Later that year, Cahill was a key figure in founding the Provisional Irish Republican Army. Angry at the failure of the IRA (led in Belfast by Billy McMillen) to defend Catholic areas during the communal rioting, Cahill and McKee stated in September 1969 that they would no longer be taking orders from the IRA leadership in Dublin, or from McMillen. In December 1969, they declared their allegiance to the Provisional IRA, which had split away from the leadership. This action took 9 out of the 13 units of the IRA in Belfast into the Provisional IRA. The remnants of the pre-split IRA became known as the Official IRA. The Provisional IRA was created and an executive council of 12 men was elected. Of the executive members, seven, one of whom was Joe Cahill. were elected to serve as the Provisional Army Council. Cahill also served as the second-in-command to Billy McKee, OC of the Belfast Battalion.

==Provisional IRA activities==
In April 1971, after the arrest and imprisonment of Billy McKee, Cahill became the commander of the Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade. He held this post until the introduction of internment in August of that year. It was during this period that the Provisional IRA campaign got off the ground in the city. Cahill authorised the beginning of the IRA&#x27;s bombing campaign as well as attacks on British troops and the RUC. He based himself in a house in Andersonstown and toured the city, co-ordinating IRA activity. The day after the British Army mounted Operation Demetrius, designed to arrest the IRA&#x27;s leaders, Cahill held a press conference in a school in Ballymurphy and stated that the operation had been a failure. He said, &quot;we have lost one brigade officer, one battalion officer and the rest are volunteers, or as they say in the British Army, privates&quot;. To avoid the propaganda defeat that his capture would then have entailed, Cahill fled to the Republic of Ireland, temporarily relinquishing his command of the Belfast Brigade.

In March 1972, Cahill was part of an IRA delegation that held direct talks with the British Labour Party leader Harold Wilson. However, although the IRA called a three-day ceasefire for the talks, no permanent end to violence was agreed upon. Upon his return to Ireland, Cahill was arrested in Dublin by Gardaí and charged with IRA membership. He went on hunger strike for twenty-three days and was subsequently released due to lack of evidence. In November 1972, Cahill became the IRA&#x27;s chief of staff and held this position until his arrest the following year.

Cahill was then put in charge of importing arms for the IRA. He liaised with the NORAID group in America and with the Libyan dictatorship of Muammar Gaddafi to this end. On March 29, 1973 he was arrested by the Irish Navy in Waterford, aboard the &quot;Claudia&quot;, a ship from Libya loaded with five tons of weapons. Cahill was sentenced to three years imprisonment by the Irish Special Criminal Court. Cahill stated at his trial that, &quot;If I am guilty of any crime, it is that I did not succeed in getting the contents of the &quot;Claudia&quot; into the hands of the freedom fighters in this country&quot;.

Upon his release, Cahill again was put in charge of arms importation and to this end went to the United States. He was deported from the United States in 1984 for illegal entry (see Provisional IRA arms importation). He served on the IRA Army Council as late as the 1990s. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, he argued against proposals for Sinn Féin to stand in elections. However, in 1985, he spoke at the party&#x27;s Ard Fheis in favour of republicans contesting elections and taking seats in the Dublin parliament, the Dáil.

==Peace process==
In his later years as honorary life vice-president of Sinn Féin, Cahill was a strong supporter of Gerry Adams and the Good Friday Agreement. In 1994, a controversial but central aspect of the IRA&#x27;s ceasefire was the granting of a limited visa by then United States President Bill Clinton to Cahill, in the face of opposition by John Major&#x27;s government, for the purpose of trying to win support for the new Sinn Féin peace strategy from Irish American IRA supporters.

In 1998 he stood in North Antrim in the elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly, but was unsuccessful, coming tenth with 4.07% of the people&#x27;s votes.

==Death==
Cahill died at age 84 in Belfast. He had been diagnosed with asbestosis, which he probably developed while working at the Harland &amp; Wolff shipyards in his twenties. He and several other former shipyard workers later sued the company for their exposure to the dangerous substances but only won minimal compensation. An Irish republican flute band in Glasgow is named after Cahill.

<doc id="855587" wikidata="Q618552" url="?curid=855587" title="Channa">
<text>Channa is a genus of predatory fish in the family Channidae, commonly known as snakeheads, native to freshwater habitats in Asia. This genus contains about 50 scientifically described species. The genus has a wide natural distribution extending from Iraq in the west, to Indonesia and China in the east, and parts of Siberia in the Far East. A particularly high richness of species exists in Myanmar (Burma) and northeastern India, and many &quot;Channa&quot; species live nowhere else. In contrast, a few widespread species have been introduced to several regions outside their natural range, where they often become invasive. The large and medium-sized &quot;Channa&quot; species are among the most common staple food fish in several Asian countries, and they are extensively cultured. Apart from their importance as a food fish, snakeheads are consumed in some regions as a traditional medicine for wound healing and reducing postoperative pain and discomfort, and collected for the international aquarium pet trade.

All snakeheads are highly predatory, and the diets of the various species of &quot;Channa&quot; include fish, amphibians (like frogs), snakes, rodents, birds, and invertebrates (insects and crustaceans). They have a labyrinth organ, which allows them to breathe air for short periods, and they use this adaptation to travel across land in the event that their habitat becomes inhospitable. They are mostly solitary or live in monogamous pairs that are highly aggressive towards outsiders of their own species, but &quot;C. pleurophthalma&quot; often occurs in small groups. Larger species are mostly nestbrooding (making a nest of vegetation at the water surface), and the dwarfs mostly paternal mouthbrooding, but exceptions occur; the large &quot;C. barca&quot; is a paternal mouthbrooder and the dwarf &quot;C. bleheri&quot; is a free-spawner (the eggs float to the surface where the parents take care of them, but they do not mouthbrood or built a nest).

==Taxonomy==
The taxonomy of the genus &quot;Channa&quot; is incomplete, and a comprehensive revision of the family has not been performed. A phylogenetic study in 2010 has indicated the likelihood of the existence of undescribed species of channids in Southeast Asia, and a more comprehensive phylogenetic study in 2017 indicated that several undescribed species exist in Asia (as well as an undescribed &quot;Parachanna&quot; in Africa). In 2011, the Malabar snakehead &quot;Channa diplogramma&quot; from peninsular India was shown to be a distinct species, 146 years after its initial description and 134 years after it was synonymised with &quot;C. micropeltes&quot;, establishing it is an endemic species of peninsular India. The study also suggested that the species shared a most recent common ancestor with &quot;C. micropeltes&quot;, around 9.52 to 21.76 MYA.

<text>Horace Hayman Wilson (26 September 1786 – 8 May 1860) was an English orientalist who was elected the first Boden Professor of Sanskrit at Oxford University.

==Life==
He studied medicine at St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital, and went out to India in 1808 as assistant-surgeon on the Bengal establishment of the British East India Company. His knowledge of metallurgy caused him to be attached to the mint at Calcutta, where he was for a time associated with John Leyden.

He acted for many years as secretary to the committee of public instruction, and superintended the studies of the Sanskrit College in Calcutta. He was one of the staunchest opponents of the proposal that English should be made the sole medium of instruction in native schools, and became for a time the object of bitter attacks.

In 1832 Oxford University selected Wilson to be the first occupant of the newly founded Boden chair of Sanskrit: he had placed a column length advertisement in &quot;The Times&quot; on 6 March 1832 p. 3, giving a list of his achievements and intended activities, along with testimonials, including one from a rival candidate, as to his suitability for the post. In 1836 he was appointed librarian to the East India Company. He also taught at the East India Company College. On 10 April 1834 he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of London.

On the recommendation of Henry Thomas Colebrooke, Wilson was in 1811 appointed secretary to the Asiatic Society of Bengal. He was a member of the Medical and Physical Society of Calcutta and was an original member of the Royal Asiatic Society, of which he was director from 1837 up to the time of his death.

He married Frances Siddons, a grand-daughter of the famous actress Sarah Siddons through her son George.

Wilson died on 8 May 1860 and is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.

==Works==
Wilson became deeply interested in the ancient language and literature of India, and was the first person to translate the Rigveda into English. In 1813 he published the Sanskrit text with a free translation in English rhymed verse of Kalidasa&#x27;s lyrical poem, the &quot;Meghadūta&quot;, or Cloud-Messenger.
He prepared the first &quot;Sanskrit–English Dictionary&quot; (1819) from materials compiled by native scholars, supplemented by his own researches. This work was only superseded by the &quot;Sanskritwörterbuch&quot; (1853–1876) of Rudolf Roth and Otto von Böhtlingk, who expressed their obligations to Wilson in the preface to their great work.

He was interested in Ayurveda and traditional Indian medical and surgical practices. He compiled the local practices observed for cholera and leprosy in his publications in the Medical and Physical Society of Calcutta.

In 1827 Wilson published &quot;Select Specimens of the Theatre of the Hindus&quot;, which contained a very full survey of the Indian drama, translations of six complete plays and short accounts of twenty-three others.
His &quot;Mackenzie Collection&quot; (1828) is a descriptive catalogue of the extensive collection of Oriental, especially South Indian, manuscripts and antiquities made by Colonel Colin Mackenzie, then deposited partly in the India Office, London (now part of the Oriental and India Office Collections of the British Library) and partly at Madras (Chennai).
He also wrote a &quot;Historical Sketch of the First Burmese War, with Documents, Political and Geographical&quot; (1827),
a &quot;Review of the External Commerce of Bengal from 1813 to 1828&quot; (1830),
a translation of &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; (1840), and
a &quot;History of British India from 1805 to 1835&quot;, (1844–1848) in continuation of James Mill&#x27;s 1818 &quot;The History of British India&quot;.

Until 1980, a countback system was used to determine the winner in the event of a tie. In 1930, Judkins was awarded the medal as he had played in the fewest games; and from 1931 to 1980, the winner was the player with the most three-vote games. In 1980, the countback system was removed, and in the event of a tie, players have been considered joint winners. In 1989, the countback was retroactively removed from all previous counts, and all players who had previously lost on countback were considered joint winners.


Notes:
As a mark of respect to soldiers fighting overseas in World War II, the medal was not awarded during 1942–1945.

==Ineligible players who polled the most votes==
A player guilty of an offence deemed worthy of a suspension by the AFL&#x27;s disciplinary tribunal for serious on-field offences is ineligible to win the Brownlow Medal. Suspended players have tallied the highest number of votes for the award on three occasions. In the third of those cases, Jobe Watson, who won in 2012, was later found guilty of breaching WADA&#x27;s anti-doping code in the 2012 season, and was retrospectively ruled ineligible by the AFL Commission in November 2016.

<text>James Washington Breakey (December 25, 1865 in Port Hope, Canada West (now Ontario) – February 27, 1952), was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was briefly the leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party, and was subsequently a supporter of the province&#x27;s Liberal-Progressive coalition government. He also invented the paint-roller 

== Biography ==
James Breakey was born in Millbrook, Canada West on December 25, 1865, the son of James Breakey and Susan McCormick. He was educated in Ontario and then moved to Manitoba, settling on a &quot;Dominion Lands Act&quot; homestead in Melita from 1882 to 1886. He then was partner in a mercantile business in Souris from 1886 to 1896. In 1892, Breakey married Jennie Hopkins. He served as secretary-treasurer for Souris and for the Rural Municipality of Glenwood. After working as a financial agent, Breakey was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in 1914, winning Glenwood for the Liberal Party. He was re-elected in the Liberal landslide victory of 1915. The following year, he co-sponsored Fred Dixon&#x27;s Workmen&#x27;s Compensation Act, a version of which was subsequently enacted as law.

Breakey lost to Independent Farmer William Robson in 1920. He recaptured his seat in 1922 (despite the Liberals losing most of their rural seats to the United Farmers of Manitoba), and was re-elected in 1927.

The Manitoba Liberals were a marginal political force following the election of 1922, having won only eight seats in a 55-member legislature. They fell to seven seats in 1927, causing some senior figures in the party to advocate a merger with the governing Progressives.

Hugh Robson resigned as Liberal leader in January 1930, and Breakey was chosen to lead the Liberal parliamentary group later in the month. In this capacity, he actively promoted a Liberal-Progressive union: he declined to speak in opposition to the government&#x27;s 1930 throne speech, and generally attempted to ensure friendly relations between the Liberal and Progressive caucuses.

Breakey stepped down as party leader in 1931, and was replaced by Murdoch Mackay. The Liberals and Progressives were merged into a single party shortly thereafter, and Breakey ran for re-election as a supporter of the government. He easily defeated his Conservative opponent, and was re-elected in 1936 and 1941.

Despite his long service in the legislature, Breakey was never appointed to cabinet. He retired from politics in 1945, at age 79.

He died in Souris on February 27, 1952.

<doc id="855604" wikidata="Q5321723" url="?curid=855604" title="E. Arnot Robertson">
<text>Eileen Arbuthnot Robertson (10 January 1903 at Moor Lodge, South Holmwood, Surrey – 21 September 1961 in Hampstead, London) was an English novelist, critic and broadcaster. Her 1931 novel &quot;Four Frightened People&quot; gave rise to a film of the same name in 1934.

==Family==
Robertson was the daughter of Dr George Arbuthnot Robertson (1860–1942), physician and surgeon, and his wife Elsie Margaret (née Brune). She was baptised on 18 March 1903 at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Holmwood. Her one sister, Mary Arbuthnot, was born in 1899. Robertson was educated at Sherborne School for Girls, which she strongly disliked. The family moved to London in 1917. She later described the atmosphere in the family as &quot;stultifying&quot;. She continued her education for two years in France and Switzerland.

Robertson took her first job, on the London-based magazine &quot;Answers&quot;, at the age of 19. In that year she also sat anonymously for the painting &quot;A Red Haired Girl&quot; by James McBey. On 26 February 1927 she was married in Kensington to H. E. (from 1951 Sir Henry) Turner (1891–1961), secretary-general of the Empire Press Union, later the Commonwealth Press Union. They adopted a son, Gordon Turner, in the late 1930s. The Turners moved to Heath Street, Hampstead, in 1946. They were passionate sailors, as the sailing background of &quot;Ordinary Families&quot; shows. Turner&#x27;s death in a boating accident precipitated Robertson&#x27;s suicide five months later.

==Writing==
By her mid-twenties E. Arnot Robertson, as she chose to be called in print, was on her way to becoming a popular &quot;middlebrow&quot; novelist with a large following, especially for her first five novels.

&quot;Four Frightened People&quot; (1931), set in a Malaya that she never actually visited, became Volume 15 on the Penguin list in 1935. A film, directed by Cecil B. DeMille, was released in 1934. Equally celebrated was &quot;Ordinary Families&quot; (1933), the story of a young girl growing up with her family in Pin Mill, Suffolk. Both titles were repeatedly reprinted into the 1980s in the Virago paperback series, as was her first novel, &quot;Cullum&quot;, in 1989.

However, her later novels added little to the reputation the earlier ones had given her, although she had &quot;seemed at one time likely to develop into a novelist of considerable comic substance and power.&quot;

Robertson also wrote astringent film criticism. Reviewing the young Bette Davis in &quot;Dangerous&quot; for the &quot;Picture Post&quot; in 1935, she said, &quot;I think Bette Davis would probably have been burned as a witch if she had lived two or three hundred years ago. She gives the curious feeling of being charged with power which can find no ordinary outlet.&quot; She was involved in 1946 in protracted litigation with MGM over what the corporation perceived as unfairly negative reviews of their films. This contributed to her losing a job at the BBC, but her eventual legal costs of £8,000 were paid from the proceeds of a fundraising appeal made by the Critics&#x27; Circle.

Robertson was a contestant on the BBC panel game My Word! from 1957 to 1961, partnering Frank Muir.

<text>Firefighting is a profession aimed at controlling and extinguishing fire. A person who engages in firefighting is known as a firefighter or fireman. Firefighters typically undergo a high degree of technical training. This involves structural firefighting and wildland firefighting. Specialized training includes aircraft firefighting, shipboard firefighting, aerial firefighting, maritime firefighting, and proximity firefighting.

Firefighting is a dangerous profession due to the toxic environment created by combustible materials, with major risks being smoke, oxygen deficiency, elevated temperatures, poisonous atmospheres, and violent air flows. To combat some of these risks, firefighters carry self-contained breathing apparatus. Additional hazards include falls – a constant peril while navigating unfamiliar layouts or confined spaces amid shifting debris under limited visibility – and structural collapse that can exacerbate the problems encountered in a toxic environment.

The first step in a firefighting operation is reconnaissance to search for the origin of the fire and to identify the specific risks. Fires can be extinguished by water, fuel or oxidant removal, or chemical flame inhibition; though, because fires are classified depending on the elements involved, such as grease, paper, electrical, etcetera, a specific type of fire extinguisher may be required. The classification is based on the type of fires that the extinguisher is more suitable for. In the United States, the types of fire are described by the National Fire Protection Association.

==History==

The earliest known firefighters were in the city of Rome. In 60 A.D., emperor Nero established a Corps of Vigils (&quot;Vigiles&quot;) to protect Rome after a disastrous fire. It consisted of 7,000 people equipped with buckets and axes who fought fires and served as police.

===Historic tactics and tools===
In the 3rd century B.C., an Alexandrian Greek named Ctesibius made a double force pump called a &quot;siphona&quot;. As water rose in the chamber, it compressed the air inside, which forced the water to eject in a steady stream through a pipe and nozzle.

In the 16th century, syringes were also used as firefighting tools, the larger ones being mounted on wheels. Another traditional firefighting method that survived was the bucket brigade, involving two lines of people formed between the water source and the fire. Typically, men in one of the lines would pass along the full buckets of water toward the fire while in the other line women and children would pass back the empty buckets to be refilled.

In the 17th century the first &quot;fire engines&quot; were made, notably in Amsterdam. In 1721, the English inventor Richard Newsham made a popular fire engine that was essentially a rectangular box on wheels filled using a bucket brigade to provide a reservoir while hand-powered pumps supplied sufficient water pressure to douse fires at a distance.

===Ancient Rome===
Ancient Rome did not have municipal firefighters. Instead, private individuals relied on their slaves or supporters to take action. They would not only form bucket brigades or attempt to smother smaller fires, but would also demolish or raze nearby buildings to slow the spread of the fire. However, there is no mention of fires being extinguished, rather they were contained and burned themselves out. Ancient Rome did not have an organized firefighting force until the &quot;Vigiles&quot; were formed during the reign of Augustus.

The first ever Roman fire brigade was created by Marcus Licinius Crassus. Fires were almost a daily occurrence in Rome, and Crassus took advantage of the fact that Rome had no fire department, by creating his own brigade—500 men strong—which rushed to burning buildings at the first cry of alarm. Upon arriving at the scene, however, the firefighters did nothing while Crassus offered to buy the burning building from the distressed property owner, at a miserable price. If the owner agreed to sell the property, his men would put out the fire; if the owner refused, then they would simply let the structure burn to the ground. After buying many properties this way, he rebuilt them, and often leased the properties to their original owners or new tenants.

===United Kingdom===
Prior to the Great Fire of London in 1666, some parishes in the UK had begun to organize rudimentary firefighting crews. After the Great Fire, Nicholas Barbon introduced the first fire insurance. In order to reduce insurance costs, Barbon also formed his own fire brigade, and other companies followed suit.

By the start of the 1800s, insured buildings were identified with a badge or mark indicating that they were eligible for a company&#x27;s firefighting services. It is a common belief that buildings not insured with a particular company were left by its firefighters to burn, unless they happened to be adjacent to an insured building, in which case it was often in the company&#x27;s interest to prevent the fire from spreading. This is a common misconception. In 1833 fire insurance companies in London merged to form The London Fire Company Establishment.

Steam-powered apparatuses were first introduced in the 1850s, allowing a greater quantity of water to be directed onto a fire; in the early 1930s they were superseded by versions powered by an internal combustion engine.

In World War II the Auxiliary Fire Service, and later the National Fire Service, were established to supplement local fire services. Before 1938, there was no countrywide standard for firefighting terms, procedures, ranks, or equipment (such as hose couplings). In the month of August in 1939 with war looking very possible the Fire Service&#x27;s act of 1938 came into effect. This unified Great Britain&#x27;s fire service and prepared them for the German war machine. During the London Blitz, 700 fire men and 20 fire women, as known during the time period died as a result of heavy bombing, 91 of these perished at the same time defending London. By the end of the London Blitz, 327 firefighters had lost their lives.

===United States===
In January 1608, a fire destroyed many colonists&#x27; provisions and lodgings in Jamestown, Virginia. By the mid-1600s, Boston, New Amsterdam (later New York City), and Philadelphia were all plagued by fires, and volunteer fire brigades began to form.

In 1736, Benjamin Franklin founded the Union Fire Company in Philadelphia, which became the standard for volunteer fire organizations. These firefighters had two critical tools: salvage bags and so-called bed keys. Salvage bags were used to quickly collect and save valuables, and bed keys were used to separate the wooden frame of a bed (often the most valuable item in a home at the time) into pieces for safe and rapid removal from the fire.

The first American attempt at fire insurance failed after a large fire in Charlestown, Massachusetts in 1736. Later in 1740, Benjamin Franklin organized the Philadelphia Contributionship to provide fire insurance, which was more successful. The Contributionship adopted &quot;fire marks&quot; to easily identify insured buildings. Firefighting started to become formalized with rules for providing buckets, ladders, and hooks, and with the formation of volunteer companies. A chain of command was also established.

==Firefighter duties==

A firefighter&#x27;s goals are to save lives, protect property, and protect the environment. A fire can rapidly spread and endanger many lives, but with modern firefighting techniques, catastrophe can often be avoided. To prevent fires from starting, a firefighter&#x27;s duties may include public education about fire safety and conducting fire inspections of locations to verify their adherence to local fire codes.

=== Firefighter skills ===

Firefighting requires technical proficiency of operational tactics, equipment, and scene awareness. Firefighters must also have, or be able to acquire, knowledge of department organizations, operations, and procedures, and the district or city street system they will have to negotiate in order to perform their duties.

They must meet minimum physical fitness standards and learn various firefighting duties within a reasonable period

Examples are:
* Building construction
*Fire behavior
*Firefighting PPE
*Fire extinguishers
*Ropes and knots
*Ground ladders
*Forcible entry
*Search and rescue
*Ventilation
*Fire hose and streams
*Fire suppression
*Salvage and overhaul
*Vehicle extrication and technical rescue
*Hazardous materials response

=== Specialized skills ===

Specialized areas of operations may require subject-specific training.
Examples are:
*Fire apparatus driver/operator - trained to drive fire apparatus to and from fires and other emergencies, operate fire-apparatus pumps and aerial devices, and maintain apparatus.
*Hazardous materials technician - certified to mitigate hazardous materials emergencies.
*Rescue technician - certified to perform complex technical rescues.
*Airport firefighter - trained in ARFF.
*Wildland firefighter - trained to extinguish fires in outdoor vegetation, including the wildland/urban interface.

=== Shift hours ===
Full-time career firefighters typically follow a 24-hour shift schedule, although some fire departments work 8- or 12-hour shifts. Australian firefighters work a 10/14 shift, in which the day shift works ten hours and the night shift works 14 hours. Firefighting personnel are split up into alternating shifts. Usually, the 24-hour shifts are followed by two days off. The shift personnel arrive for roll call at a specified time, ready to complete a regular tour of duty. While on shift, the firefighter remains at the fire station unless relieved or assigned other duties.

===Fire wardens===

In fire fighting, there are also people designated as fire wardens, also known as chief officers. Their duties vary, some may ensure evacuation of that part of the building for which they are responsible; others may be responsible for fire control in a particular area, direct a crew in the suppression of forest fires, or function as fire patrolmen in a logging area.

The chief officer is in charge of their firefighters during fires or emergencies, and is expected to command and control the overall situation while effectively combating a fire or other emergency. Chief officers must be able to evaluate their firefighters, use sound judgement when deciding when it is time to withdraw firefighters from a fire, and react calmly in emergency situations. The chief officer must direct the activities of a fire department and supervise all firefighting activities, requiring extensive knowledge of city layouts, the location of streets, fire hydrants and fire alarm boxes, and the principal buildings. A chief officer must be familiar with sources of fires, including explosives, hazardous chemicals, and the combustion qualities of materials in buildings, homes, and industrial plants.

In certain jurisdictions, civilians can get certified to be a Fire Warden, and some cities require certain types of buildings, such as high rises, to have a certain number of Fire Wardens. For example, the city of Houston in the United States requires every tenant in a high-rise to have at least one Fire Warden for every 7500 sq. ft. occupied, and a minimum of two Fire Wardens per floor. In this example, their duties include investigating any fire alarms (see if there really is a fire and if so, its nature), ensuring the fire department is contacted, directing the evacuation of the facility, activating or delaying activation of fire suppression equipment such as halon and sprinklers (delayed in case of a false alarm), meeting the fire department and taking them to the location of the alarm or to the fire past any security or locked doors, and, if necessary, fighting the fire until the fire department arrives.

=== Firefighter safety zone guidelines ===
The U.S. Forest Service publishes guidelines for the minimum distance a firefighter should be from a flame. As stated in the National Wildfire Coordinating Group&#x27;s Incident Response Pocket Guide: &quot;A safety zone is an area where a firefighter can survive without a fire shelter&quot; and should be &quot;...at least four times the maximum continuous flame height.&quot; However this figure only takes into account the effects of radiant heat and does not consider topography nor wind.

Safety Zones can be natural features such as rock screes, meadows, and river bars; or human-made features such as parking lots or areas that have been cleared of vegetation through mechanical means.

==Hazards caused by fires==

=== During a fire ===

One of the major hazards associated with firefighting operations is the toxic environment created by combusting materials. The four major hazards are:
*Smoke, which is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the increased variety and amount of synthetic household materials
*Oxygen deficient atmosphere (21% O2 is normal and 19.5% O2 is considered oxygen deficient)
*Elevated temperatures
*Toxic atmospheres

To deal with such hazards, firefighters carry a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA; an open-circuit positive pressure system) to prevent smoke inhalation. These are not oxygen tanks (oxygen as a powerful fire accelerant would represent a grave risk when combined with virtually anything combustible in the presence of fire) but use compressed air in a similar manner to SCUBA diving gear. A firefighter&#x27;s SCBA usually hold 30 to 45 minutes of air, depending on the size of the tank and the rate of consumption during strenuous activities. While this gear helps to eliminate the risks, firefighters are still exposed to smoke, toxic dust, fumes and radiation that have contributed to firefighters being 14% more likely to develop cancer.

Obvious risks associated with the immense heat generated by a fire, even without direct contact with the flames (direct flame impingement), such as conductive heat and radiant heat, can cause serious burns even from great distances. There are a number of comparably serious heat-related risks, such as burns from hot gases (e.g., air), steam, and hot and/or toxic smoke. Prolonged, intense exertion in hot environments also increases firefighters&#x27; risk for heat-related illnesses, such as rhabdomyolysis. Accordingly, firefighters are equipped with personal protective equipment (PPE) that includes fire-resistant clothing such as Nomex or polybenzimidazole fiber (PBI) and helmets that limit the transmission of heat towards the body. No PPE, however, can completely protect the user from the effects of all possible fire conditions.

Heat can cause flammable liquid contained in tanks to explode violently, producing what is called a BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion). Some chemical products such as ammonium nitrate fertilizers can also explode, potentially causing physical trauma from blast or shrapnel injuries. Sufficient heat causes human flesh to burn as fuel, or the water within to boil, leading to potentially severe medical problems.

Furthers risks include the occurrences of backdrafts. Backdrafts occur when there is a large amount of oxygen introduced to an oxygen-depleted fire. If a fire is compartmentalized and most or all of the oxygen has been burned up, there is a high risk of backdraft if something such as a window or door is opened. Introducing oxygen to a low burning fire can be devastating as it will ignite all of the oxygen along the way. It can also be heard from miles away as it has a concussive blast that adds to the effect. Firefighters need to have extreme communication at all times on the fire ground as one broken window at the wrong time could seriously harm anyone operating on the building.

Depending on the heat of the fire, burns can occur in a fraction of a second.

Additional risks of fire are the obscuring of vision due to
smoke, potentially causing a fall or disorientation; becoming trapped in a fire; and structural collapse.

&quot;Three hours of fighting a fire stiffens arteries and impairs cardiac function in firefighters&quot; according to a study by Bo Fernhall, a professor in the department of kinesiology and community health in the College of Applied Health Sciences, and Gavin Horn, director of research at the Illinois Fire Service Institute. The conditions (observed in healthy male firefighters) are &quot;also apparent found in weightlifters and endurance athletes...&quot;

=== During debris cleanup ===
Once extinguished, fire debris cleanup poses several safety and health risks for workers.

Many hazardous substances are commonly found in fire debris. Silica can be found in concrete, roofing tiles, or it may be a naturally occurring element. Occupational exposures to silica dust can cause silicosis, lung cancer, pulmonary tuberculosis, airway diseases, and some additional non-respiratory diseases. Inhalation of asbestos can result in various diseases including asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma. Sources of metals exposure include burnt or melted electronics, cars, refrigerators, stoves, etc. Fire debris cleanup workers may be exposed to these metals or their combustion products in the air or on their skin. These metals may include beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead, manganese, nickel, and many more. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), some of which are carcinogenic, come from the incomplete combustion of organic materials and are often found as a result of structural and wildland fires.

Safety hazards of fire cleanup include the risk of reignition of smoldering debris, electrocution from downed or exposed electrical lines or in instances where water has come into contact with electrical equipment. Structures that have been burned may be unstable and at risk of sudden collapse.

Standard personal protective equipment for fire cleanup include hard hats, goggles or safety glasses, heavy work gloves, earplugs or other hearing protection, steel-toe boots, and fall protection devices. Hazard controls for electrical injury include assuming all power lines are energized until confirmation they are de-energized, and grounding power lines to guard against electrical feedback, and using appropriate personal protective equipment. Proper respiratory protection can protect against hazardous substances. Proper ventilation of an area is an engineering control that can be used to avoid or minimize exposure to hazardous substances. When ventilation is insufficient or dust cannot be avoided, personal protective equipment such as N95 respirators can be used.

==Reconnaissance and &quot;reading&quot; the fire==
The first step in a firefighting operation is reconnaissance to search for the origin of the fire (which may not be obvious for an indoor fire, especially if there are no witnesses), to identify any specific risks, and to detect possible casualties. An outdoor fire may not require reconnaissance, but a fire in a cellar or an underground car park with only a few centimeters of visibility may require long reconnaissance to identify the source of the fire.

The &quot;reading&quot; of a fire is the analysis by firefighters of indications of thermal events such as flashover, backdraft or smoke explosion. It is performed during reconnaissance and fire suppression maneuvers.

The main signs are:
* Hot zones, which can be detected with a gloved hand, for example by touching a door before opening it;
* Soot on windows, which usually means that combustion is incomplete, and thus, a lack of air in the room;
* Smoke pulsing in and out around a door frame, as if the fire were breathing, which usually also means a lack of air to support combustion.

Spraying water on the ceiling in short pulses of a diffused spray (e.g., a cone with an opening angle of 60°) can be undertaken to test the heat of smoke: If the temperature is moderate, the water falls down in drops with a sound like rain; if the temperature is high, the water vaporizes with a hiss—the sign of a potentially extremely dangerous impending flashover.

Ideally, part of reconnaissance is consulting a plan for the building that provides information about structures, firefighter hazards, and in some cases the most appropriate strategies and tactics for fighting a fire in that context.
== Science of extinguishment ==

There are four elements needed to start and sustain a fire and/or flame: temperature, a fuel, an oxidizing agent (oxygen), and a chemical reaction. A fire can be extinguished by taking away any of the four components.

The fuel is the substance being oxidized or burned in the combustion process. The most common fuels contain carbon along with combinations of hydrogen and oxygen. Heat is the energy component of a fire. When it comes into contact with a fuel, it provides the energy necessary for ignition, causes the continuous production and ignition of fuel vapors or gases so that the combustion reaction can continue, and causes the vaporization of solid and liquid fuels. The resulting self-sustained chemical chain reaction is complex and requires fuel, an oxidizer, and heat energy to come together in a very specific way. An oxidizing agent is a material or substance that will release gases, including oxygen, when the proper conditions exist. It is crucial to the sustainment of a flame or fire.

Using water is one common method to extinguish a fire. Water extinguishes a fire by cooling, which removes heat because of water’s ability to absorb massive amounts of heat as it converts to water vapor. Without heat, the fuel cannot keep the oxidizer from reducing the fuel in order to sustain the fire. Water also extinguishes a fire by smothering it. When water is heated to its boiling point, it converts to water vapor. When this conversion takes place, it dilutes the oxygen in the air above the fire, thus removing one of the elements that the fire requires to burn. This can also be done with foam.

Another way to extinguish a fire is fuel removal. This can be accomplished by stopping the flow of liquid or gaseous fuel, by removing solid fuel in the path of a fire, or by allowing the fire to burn until all the fuel is consumed, at which point the fire will self-extinguish.

One final extinguishing method is chemical flame inhibition. This can be accomplished by applying dry chemical or halogenated agents that interrupt the chemical chain reaction and stop flaming. This method is effective on gas and liquid fuel because they must have flame to burn.

Sound waves have been successfully used in a device fabricated by two George Mason University senior engineering students, Viet Tran and Seth Robertson, but the procedure is still awaiting a patent (2015).

==Use of water==

One common way to extinguish a fire is to spray it with water. The water has two roles: It vaporizes when it comes in contact with fire, and this vapor displaces the oxygen (the volume of water vapor is 1,700 times greater than liquid water, at it expands over 4,000 times). This leaves the fire without enough of the combustive agent, and it dies out. The vaporization of water also absorbs heat; it thereby cools the smoke, air, walls, and objects that could act as further fuel, and thus prevents one of the means by which fires grow, which is by &quot;jumping&quot; to nearby heat/fuel sources to start new fires, which then combine. Water extinguishment is thus a combination of &quot;asphyxia&quot; (cutting off the oxygen supply) and cooling. The flame itself is suppressed by asphyxia, but the cooling is the most important element in mastering a fire in a closed area.

Water may be accessed from a pressurized fire hydrant, pumped from water sources such as lakes or rivers, delivered by tanker truck, or dropped from water bombers, which are aircraft adapted as tankers for fighting forest fires. An armored vehicle (firefighting tank) may be used where access to the area is difficult.

=== Open air fire ===
For outdoor fires, the seat of the fire is sprayed with a straight spray: the cooling effect immediately follows the &quot;asphyxia&quot; caused by vaporization and reduces the further amount of water required. This is because water droplets, upon forming in to water mist, increase their surface area by a large magnitude, greatly increasing the endothermic cooling effect and robbing the fire of oxygen. A straight spray is used so the water arrives massively to the seat of the fire before it vaporizes. A strong spray may also have a mechanical effect; it can disperse the combustible product and thus prevent the fire from starting again. Spray is always aimed at a surface or an object. For this reason, the strategy is sometimes called a two-dimensional or 2D attack.

An outdoor fire is always fed with air, and the risk to people is limited as they can move away from it, except in the case of wildfires or bushfires where they risk being easily surrounded by the flames. It might, however, be necessary to protect specific objects like houses or gas tanks against infrared radiation, and thus to use a diffused spray between the fire and the object. Breathing apparatus is often required as there is still the risk of inhaling smoke or poisonous gases.

=== Closed volume fire ===

Until the 1970s, fires were usually attacked while they declined, using the same strategy as for open air fires. Now fires are attacked in their development phase because firefighters arrive sooner at the site of a fire and because of changes in building construction. The increasing use of thermal insulation confines the heat, and modern materials, especially polymers, produce much more heat than do traditional materials like wood, plaster, stone, and bricks. Under these conditions, there is a greater risk of backdraft and flashover.

Directly spraying the seat of the fire in enclosed areas can have unfortunate consequences: the force of water pushes air in front of it, which supplies the fire with extra oxygen before the water. The most important issue is not combating the flames, but controlling the fire; for example, cooling the smoke so that it cannot spread and start fires further away, and endanger the lives of people, including the firefighters.

When a fire spreads beyond the building of its origin and spreads throughout the neighborhood, it is called a “conflagration.” Today, a conflagration is a large fire that is beyond the capability of the fire service to contain.

The volume of the fire must be cooled before its seat is attacked. This strategy, originally of Swedish origin (Mats Rosander &amp; Krister Giselsson), was adapted by London Fire Officer Paul Grimwood following a decade of operational use in the busy West End of London between 1984 and 1994 and termed the three-dimensional or 3D attack.

Use of a diffuse spray was first proposed by Chief Lloyd Layman of the Parkersburg Fire Department, at the 1950 Fire Department Instructors Conference (FDIC) held in Memphis. Using Grimwood&#x27;s modified 3D attack strategy, the ceiling is first sprayed with short pulses of a diffuse spray. This 
cools the smoke which is then less likely to start a fire when it moves away. As gas cools it becomes denser (Charles&#x27;s law); thus, it also reduces the mobility of the smoke and avoids a &quot;backfire&quot; of water vapor. Also, the diffuse spray creates an inert &quot;water vapor sky&quot;, which prevents &quot;roll-over&quot; (rolls of flames on the ceiling created by hot burning gases).

Only short pulses of water need to be sprayed, otherwise the spraying modifies the equilibrium, and the gases mix instead of remaining stratified: the hot gases (initially at the ceiling) move around the room, and the temperature rises at the ground, which is dangerous for firefighters.

An alternative is to cool all the atmosphere by spraying the whole atmosphere as if drawing letters in the air (&quot;penciling&quot;).

Modern methods for extinguishing an urban fire dictate the use of a massive initial water flow, e.g. 500 L/min for each fire hose. The aim is to absorb as much heat as possible at the beginning to stop the expansion of the fire and to reduce the smoke. If the flow is too low, the cooling is insufficient, and the steam that is produced can burn firefighters (the drop of pressure is too small and the vapor is pushed back in their direction).

Although it may seem paradoxical, the use of a strong flow with an efficient fire hose and an efficient strategy (diffuse spray, small droplets) requires a smaller amount of water. This is because once the temperature is lowered, only a limited amount of water is necessary to suppress the fire seat with a straight spray. For a living room of , the required amount of water is estimated as 60 L (15 gal).

French firefighters used an alternative method in the 1970s: spraying water on the hot walls to create a water vapor atmosphere and asphyxiate the fire. This method is no longer used because it turned out to be risky; the pressure created pushed the hot gases and vapor towards the firefighters, causing severe burns, and pushed the hot gases into other rooms where they could start other fires.

==Asphyxiating a fire==

In some cases, the use of water is undesirable. This is because some chemical products react with water to produce poisonous gases, or they may even burn when they come into contact with water (e.g., sodium), see water-reactive substances. Another problem is that some products float on water, such as hydrocarbons (gasoline, oil, and alcohol, etc.); a burning layer can then be spread by the fire. If
a pressurized fuel tank is endangered by fire it is necessary to avoid heat shocks that may damage the tank if it is sprayed with cooling water; the resulting decompression might produce a BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion).

Electrical fires cannot be extinguished with water since the water could act as a conductor.

In such cases, it is necessary to asphyxiate the fire. This can be done in a variety of ways. Chemical products which react with the fuel can be used to stop the combustion. A layer of water-based fire retardant foam can be applied by the fire hose in order to separate the oxygen in the air from the fuel. carbon dioxide, halon, or sodium bicarbonate can be used. In the case of very small fires and in the absence of other extinguishing agents, covering the flame with a fire blanket can eliminate oxygen flow to the fire. A simple and usually effective way to put out a fire in a stove-top pan is to put a lid on the pan and leave it there.

==Tactical ventilation or isolation of the fire==
One of the main risks of a fire is the smoke; because, it carries heat and poisonous gases, and obscures vision. In the case of a fire in a closed location (building), the following two different strategies may be used: isolation of the fire or ventilation.

Paul Grimwood introduced the concept of tactical ventilation in the 1980s to encourage a better thought-out approach to this aspect of firefighting. Following work with Warrington Fire Research Consultants (FRDG 6/94) his terminology and concepts were adopted officially by the UK fire services, and are now referred to throughout revised Home Office training manuals (1996–97). Grimwood&#x27;s original definition of his 1991 unified strategy stated that, &quot;&quot;tactical ventilation&quot; is either the venting, or containment (isolation) actions by on-scene firefighters, used to take control from the outset of a fire&#x27;s burning regime, in an effort to gain tactical advantage during interior structural firefighting operations.&quot;

When properly used, ventilation improves life safety, fire extinguishment, and property conservation by &#x27;pulling&#x27; fire away from trapped occupants and objects.

In most cases of structural firefighting, windows are broken or removed from the outside of the building to provide efficient horizontal ventilation. A 4x4 foot opening may also be cut into the roof directly over the fire room. This allows hot smoke and gases to escape through the opening, returning the conditions inside the room to normal. It is important to coordinate the ventilation with an interior fire attack since the opening of a ventilation hole supplies more air, and thus oxygen, to the fire. Ventilation may also &quot;limit fire spread by channeling fire toward nearby openings and allows fire fighters to safely attack the fire&quot; as well as limit smoke, heat, and water damage.

Positive pressure ventilation (PPV) consists of using a fan to create excess pressure in a part of the building. This pressure pushes the smoke and heat out of the building, and thus facilitates rescue and fire fighting operations. It is necessary to have an exit for the smoke, to know the building layout well to predict where the smoke will go, and to ensure that the doors ensuring the ventilation remain open by wedging or propping them. The main risk of this method is that it may accelerate the fire, or even create a flash-over; for example, if the smoke and the heat accumulate in a dead end.

Hydraulic ventilation is the process of directing a stream of water from the inside of a structure out the window using a fog pattern. This will effectively pull smoke out of room. Smoke ejectors may also be used for this purpose.

==Categorizing fires==
===United States===

In the US, fires are sometimes categorized as &quot;one alarm&quot;, &quot;all hands&quot;, &quot;two alarm&quot;, &quot;three alarm&quot; (or higher) fires. There is no standard definition for what this means quantifiably; though, it always refers to the level of response by the local authorities. In some cities, the numeric rating refers to the number of fire stations that have been summoned to the fire. In others, it reflects the number of &quot;dispatches&quot; requesting additional personnel and equipment.

Alarms levels are generally used to define the tiers of the response as to what resources are to be used. For example, a structure fire response draws the following equipment: four engine/pumper companies, one truck/ladder/aerial/quint company, and one battalion chief unit. This is referred to as an Initial Alarm or Box Alarm. A working fire request (for the same incident) would call for air/light units and 
chief officers/fireground commanders (if not provided in the original dispatch). This summarizes the response to a First Alarm fire. Second and subsequent alarms call for two engine companies and one truck company.

The reason behind the &quot;Alarm&quot; designation is so the Incident Commander does not have to list each apparatus required. He can simply say, &quot;Give me a second alarm here&quot;, instead of &quot;Give me a truck company and two engine companies&quot; along with requesting where they should come from. Categorization of fires varies among fire departments. A single alarm for one department may be a second alarm for another. Response always depends on the size of the fire and the department.

===United Kingdom===
In the fire services in the United Kingdom, the scale of a fire is measured by the number of &quot;pumps&quot; (ordinary fire engines) that were present. For example, a fire which was attended by 4 engines would be recorded as a &quot;4-pump fire&quot;.

<text>Liu Di (Traditional Chinese: 劉荻; Simplified Chinese: 刘荻; Pinyin: Liú Dí; born October 9, 1981), writing under the screen name &quot;Stainless Steel Rat&quot; (不锈钢老鼠), named after the assertive Harry Harrison science fiction character, became a symbol for democracy and free speech in China since her detention in November 2002. Her screen-name is often translated as Stainless Steel Mouse.

==Biography==
Liu Di graduated as a psychology major from Beijing Normal University.

Liu&#x27;s case comes during a crackdown on Internet content as the government struggles to gain control over a new and popular medium.

The reasons for Liu&#x27;s detention were satirizing the CCP online and calling for the release of other &quot;cyber-dissidents.&quot;

She was freed from Beijing&#x27;s Qincheng prison on Friday, November 28, 2003. Two other &quot;cyber-dissidents&quot;, Wu Yiran, and Li Yibin, were also freed from a jail for political detainees.

==== Sales Figures ====

Source:

==Competition==

NetApp competes in the computer data storage hardware industry. In 2009, NetApp ranked second in market capitalization in its industry behind EMC Corporation, now Dell EMC, and ahead of Seagate Technology, Western Digital, Brocade, Imation, and Quantum. In total revenue of 2009, NetApp ranked behind EMC, Seagate, Western Digital, and ahead of Imation, Brocade, Xyratex, and Hutchinson Technology. According to a 2014 IDC report, NetApp ranked second in the network storage industry &quot;Big 5&#x27;s list&quot;, behind EMC (Dell), and ahead of IBM, HP and Hitachi.

== Partnerships ==
On March 1, 2021, a partnership with the Aston Martin F1 Team was announced. NetApp is currently responsible for data provision and cloud services for the racing team. Similar partnerships have been in place with the MotoGP team Ducati Corse since 2018, and the TAG Heuer Porsche Formula E Team since July 2022.

==Products==
===Hardware Appliances===

NetApp&#x27;s FAS (Fabric-Attached Storage), AFF (All-Flash FAS), and ASA (All SAN Array) storage systems are the company&#x27;s flagship products. Such products are made up of storage controllers, and one or more enclosures of hard disks, known as shelves.

In the early 1990s, NetApp&#x27;s storage systems initially offered NFS and SMB protocols based on standard local area networks (LANs), whereas block storage consolidation required storage area networks (SANs) implemented with the Fibre Channel (FC) protocol.

In 2002, in an attempt to increase market share, NetApp added block-storage access as well, supporting the Fibre Channel and iSCSI protocols. NetApp systems support Fibre Channel, iSCSI, Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) and the FC-NVMe protocol.

===ONTAP===

Many of NetApp&#x27;s products use the company&#x27;s proprietary ONTAP data management operating system, under continuous development since 1992, which includes code from Berkeley Net/2 BSD Unix, Spinnaker Networks technology and other operating systems. There are three ONTAP platforms: FAS/AFF systems, software on commodity servers (ONTAP Select) as virtual machine or in the cloud (Cloud Volumes ONTAP). All ONTAP systems use WAFL file systems which provide basis for snapshots and other snapshot-based and data protection technologies. Key IP from ONTAP is also used in NetApp Astra, a newer data management-as-a-service system built for Kubernetes.

===Cloud Backup===
Previously known as Riverbed SteelStor before its acquisition by NetApp, this product was later renamed to AltaVault and then to Cloud Backup. Cloud Backup was initially available in three forms: as a hardware appliance, virtual appliance, and cloud appliance. Later, NetApp announced the end of sale for hardware and virtual appliances. Data placed on NAS share on Cloud Backup deduplicated, compressed, encrypted and transferred to object storage systems like Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage or StorageGRID; thus Cloud Backup appears as a transparent gateway for archiving data to a private or public cloud.

===NetApp HCI===

NetApp Hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) or sometimes referred by NetApp as Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure, NetApp HCI is based on commodity blade and rack servers, NetApp Element software and VMware vSphere. NetApp HCI includes the NetApp Deployment Engine (NDE) for configuring vCenter, IP addresses, login and password, and storage nodes.

====2U HCI Chassis with four half-width blade servers====

Each storage node drive set consists of six SSD drives directly connected to a dedicated storage node and installed in front of the blade chassis. Each storage and compute blade nodes have 25 Gigabit Ethernet ports which could be used as 10 Gbit/s ports as well as dedicated 1 Gb ports for management purposes. Network switches were not included, and in NetApp HCI with Element software release 11 NetApp announced H-Series Switch as part of HCI, so all hardware components must be bought from NetApp. ONTAP Select available as SDS on NetApp HCI for customers interested in NAS protocols. The self-service portal allows automating common provisioning and management tasks.

====SolidFire====
SolidFire storage system uses an OS called NetApp Element Software (formally SolidFire Element OS) based on Linux and designed for SSDs and scale-out architecture with the ability to expand up to 100 nodes and provide access to data through SAN protocols iSCSI natively and Fiber Channel with two gateway nodes. Element OS provides a REST-based API for storage automation, configuration, management, and consumption. Element SW version 11 will not support FC. SolidFire uses iSCSI login redirection to distribute reads and writes across the cluster using helix algorithm. Each node has pre-installed SSD drives, which must all be of the same type and capacity. Each SolidFire cluster can have a mix of different node models and generations.

===StorageGRID===

StorageGRID is a software-defined storage system which provides access to data via object IP-based protocols like S3 and OpenStack Swift. It is available in the form of hardware or as software.

===E-Series===

Previously known as LSI Engenio RDAC after NetApp acquisition the product renamed to NetApp E-Series. It is a general-purpose enterprise storage system with two controllers for SAN protocols such as Fibre Channel, iSCSI, SAS and InfiniBand (includes SRP, iSER, and NVMe over Fabrics protocol). NetApp E-Series platform uses proprietary OS SANtricity and proprietary RAID called Dynamic Disk Pool (DDP) alongside traditional RAIDs like RAID 10, RAID 6, RAID 5, etc. In DDP pool each D-Stripe works similar to traditional RAID-4 and RAID-6 but on block level instead of entire disk level, therefore, have no dedicated parity drives. DDP compare to traditional RAID groups restores data from lost disk drive to multiple drives which provide a few times faster reconstruction time while traditional RAIDs restores lost disk drive to a dedicated parity drive. Starting with SANtricity 11.50 E-Series systems EF570 and E5700 support NVMe over Ethernet (RoCEv2) with 100 Gbit/s Ethernet ports and NVMe over InfiniBand.

<text>Antonia Forest (26 May 1915 – 28 November 2003) was the pseudonym of Patricia Giulia Caulfield Kate Rubinstein, an English writer. She wrote 13 books for children, published between 1948 and 1982. Her 10 best-known works concern the doings of the fictional Marlow family. Forest also wrote two historical novels about the Marlows&#x27; Elizabethan ancestors.

==Life==
Forest was born to part Russian-Jewish and Irish parents on 26 May 1915. She grew up in Hampstead, London, and was educated at South Hampstead High School and University College, London, where she studied journalism. During World War II, she worked at an Army Pay Office.

From 1938 until her death in 2003, Forest lived in Bournemouth and Dorset.

Although she was brought up Reform Jewish, her views became increasingly influenced by Christianity. In 1946, she converted to Roman Catholicism.

Forest frequently corresponded with her readers and literary figures such as GB Stern. She never married, and supported herself by renting out part of her house in Bournemouth.

==Marlow series==

Forest is known for the Marlow series of novels featuring one contemporary generation of the Marlows, an ancient, landed family whose patriarch is a Royal Navy commander (later captain). Among eight children, all six daughters go to Kingscote, a boarding school where the four books named after school &quot;Terms&quot; are set. 

The Marlows&#x27; world is richly described, with the school stories featuring the protagonists&#x27; wide-ranging interests and the strengths and weaknesses of members of their circle. &quot;The Attic Term&quot; is notable for its use of the teenage character Patrick Merrick to express Forest&#x27;s opposition to changes in Roman Catholicism after the Second Vatican Council.

Forest also wrote &quot;The Player&#x27;s Boy&quot; (1970) and &quot;The Players and the Rebels&quot; (1971), about the Marlows&#x27; ancestors in Shakespeare&#x27;s time.

:‡ &quot;Twins&#x27; Form&quot; refers to the school stages of twins Nicola and Lawrie.

The Marlow books have been noted for their &#x27;floating timeline&#x27;; the same characters who experienced the London Blitz as children go on to watch &quot;Up Pompeii!&quot; and make themselves up as punks only a few years later.

Although Forest indicated that she was working on a successor to &quot;Run Away Home&quot;, no manuscript was found among her papers after her death in 2003. In 2011, Girls Gone By published the book &quot;Spring Term&quot; by Sally Hayward as a continuation of the Marlow series, which received positive reviews.

==Reception==

&quot;The Thursday Kidnapping&quot; (1963) was Forest&#x27;s only book not about the Marlows, and the only one published in the U.S. It was a commended runner-up for the Library Association&#x27;s Carnegie Medal, for the year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book by a British subject. Two Marlow books were also commended runners-up for the medal: &quot;Falconer&#x27;s Lure&quot; and &quot;Peter&#x27;s Room,&quot; for 1957 and 1961 respectively.

Forest&#x27;s books have received critical praise from Victor Watson, who called her &quot;the Jane Austen of children&#x27;s literature&quot;, and from Alison Shell, who has studied Forest&#x27;s theme of recusant Catholicism.

The Marlow books also featured in Lucy Mangan&#x27;s 2012 memoir of favourite childhood reading. Mangan chose the first Marlow book as one of her top picks for a children&#x27;s library, saying of the series: &#x27;they are dense and complex books, but among the most fulfilling reads I think a child can have. When I first came across C.S. Lewis&#x27;s adage, &quot;I read to know that I am not alone&quot;, it was the Marlows I thought of&#x27;.

==Reissues==

All of Forest&#x27;s books, initially published by Faber, went out of print for several decades. This situation was condemned as &quot;outrageous&quot; by &quot;The Cambridge Guide to Children&#x27;s Books in English&quot; (2001), which mentions Forest first in its section on neglected works, citing her as &quot;one of the best children&#x27;s writers of the 20th century&quot; and noting that her work is marked by &quot;extraordinary richness and complexity of characterisation, sensitive treatment of difficult situations, and a deep love of history and literature&quot;.

Years after Forest&#x27;s books went out of print, they gradually returned to the public eye with a Faber reprint of &quot;Autumn Term&quot; in 2000. It was followed by Girls Gone By Publishers&#x27; reprints of &quot;Falconer&#x27;s Lure&quot;, &quot;Run Away Home&quot;, &quot;The Marlows and the Traitor&quot;, &quot;The Ready-Made Family&quot;, &quot;Peter&#x27;s Room&quot;, and &quot;The Thuggery Affair&quot;. Girls Gone By reprinted &quot;The Player&#x27;s Boy&quot; in 2006, &quot;The Players and the Rebels&quot; in 2008, and &quot;The Thursday Kidnapping&quot; in 2009. Since reacquiring the copyright of all Forest&#x27;s books apart from &quot;Autumn Term&quot;, Girls Gone By also published new editions of &quot;End of Term&quot; (2017) and &quot;The Cricket Term&quot; (2020). They also reprinted &quot;The Marlows and the Traitor&quot; (2015), &quot;Falconer&#x27;s Lure&quot; (2016), &quot;Peter&#x27;s Room&quot; (2018), and &quot;The Thuggery Affair&quot; (2019).

&quot;The Marlows and Their Maker: A Companion to the Series by Antonia Forest&quot; was published in 2007.

<doc id="855639" wikidata="Q3401272" url="?curid=855639" title="Dancing baby">
<text>The &quot;Dancing Baby&quot;, also called &quot;Baby Cha-Cha&quot; or &quot;the Oogachacka Baby&quot;, is an internet meme of a 3D-rendered animation of a baby performing a cha-cha type dance. It quickly became a media phenomenon in the United States and one of the first viral videos in the mid-late 1990s.

== Origin ==
Michael Girard, who has worked on &quot;Rugrats&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, travelled from Holland, Netherlands, to California, United States, in 1993 with his wife Susan Amkraut. There, the couple started the company Unreal Pictures Inc. and the team began the &quot;Biped&quot; animation project by developing sample 3D animated files. The samples would be released in Character Studio, a plug-in for the Autodesk 3ds Max application (known as &quot;3D Studio Max&quot; at the time) from a division of Autodesk, Kinetix.

Robert Lurye, who was animating at Rhythm and Hues Studios, was hired by the company and was told to make more samples. Lurye started changing the choreography of a dancing adult skeleton that had been made by the team (the &quot;chacha.bip&quot; file). He added more dance moves, such as making it &quot;play air guitar for a second and bend over and shake its shoulders.&quot; For the visuals, Unreal Pictures Inc. had multiple renderings of creatures that could be animated, including an alien, a dinosaur and a baby. The baby, made by modeler Tony Morrill, had been bought from a Viewpoint DataLabs listing. Team member John Chadwick, by using the Physique software, made the baby model perform the skeleton&#x27;s dance. He stated that it was his idea to load the dancing animation on the baby. &quot;Vulture&quot;, a pop culture website owned by &quot;New York&quot; magazine, reports that the animation was also developed by Paul Bloemink, John Hutchinson and Adam Felt.

The result was a file with the name &quot;sk_baby.max&quot;. Kinetix exhibited a demo of the Dancing Baby in the 1995 SIGGRAPH computer graphics conference. Character Studio was released in August 1996. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Girard had discarded the Dancing Baby, opining it was &quot;disturbing&quot; for its realistic nature, in contrast to Disney animations at the time.

== Spread ==

LucasArts animator and Autodesk customer Ron Lussier recovered the Dancing Baby by recombining the chacha.bip file with the baby model (which was commercially available), made some minor changes and posted it on a CompuServe Internet forum as an .avi format. He also reportedly sent the Dancing Baby to his colleagues by e-mail. Although Girard credits Lussier as being responsible for the meme&#x27;s spread, news website &quot;Vox&quot; reports that the meme became viral after it was converted and posted as an animated GIF by developer John Woodell.

Users and animators were able to render their own video clips of the &#x27;original&#x27; animated dancing baby (sk_baby.max) and circulate these via the Compuserve (Internet) forums, World Wide Web (commercial and private websites), and in print ads and unrestricted e-mail. Such activity proliferated most significantly from mainstream (Windows users) royalty-free access to and user renderings of the 3D dancing baby source file for use on the Internet and in broadcast television via several news editorials, advertisements, and even comic programming in local, national (U.S.), and various international markets. Woodell&#x27;s animated GIF then proliferated to numerous other websites, and later proceeded to show up in a broad array of mainstream media, including television dramas (such as &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;), commercial advertisements, and music videos between 1997 and 1998.

=== Modifications ===
Variations to the original animation were later produced by numerous animators by modifying the sk_baby.max sample file&#x27;s animation or the baby model itself, including a &quot;drunken baby&quot;, a &quot;rasta baby&quot;, a &quot;samurai baby&quot;, and others. However, none of these became as popular on the Internet as the original file, and most popular uses of Dancing Baby are virtually unchanged from the original character mesh and animation.

== Legacy ==
In February 2020, Twitter user @JArmstrongArty not only rediscovered the original Dancing Baby file, but also converted the original animation into high definition.

<doc id="855653" wikidata="Q560872" url="?curid=855653" title="Benedetto Castelli">
<text>Benedetto Castelli (1578 – 9 April 1643), born Antonio Castelli, was an Italian mathematician. Benedetto was his name in religion on entering the Benedictine Order in 1595.

==Life==
Born in Brescia, Castelli studied at the University of Padua and later became an abbot at the Benedictine monastery in Monte Cassino.

He was a long-time friend and supporter of his teacher, Galileo Galilei, and in turn, he was a teacher to Galileo&#x27;s son. He assisted Galileo&#x27;s study of sunspots and participated in the examination of the theories of Nicolaus Copernicus. Castelli was interested in mathematics and hydraulics. He was appointed as a mathematician to the University of Pisa, replacing Galileo, and later at the University of Rome La Sapienza. Castelli introduced Bonaventura Cavalieri to Galileo, leading to extensive correspondence between the latter; Galileo was instrumental in procuring a position for Cavalieri at the University of Bologna in 1629.

Castelli was involved in the discovery of the phases of Venus:

In December 1610, Galileo received a letter from Castelli, asking if the phases of Venus were observable through Galileo&#x27;s new telescope. Days later, Galileo wrote in a letter to Johannes Kepler saying that he&#x27;d observed Venus going through phases, but took complete credit for himself. It is unclear, lacking copies of any earlier correspondence, whether Castelli was telling Galileo of it for the first time, or responding to Galileo having previously informed him of it.

Castelli died in Rome. His students included Giovanni Alfonso Borelli, Raffaello Magiotti, Antonio Nardi, and Evangelista Torricelli, the inventor of the barometer and an early proponent of the air pump. He recommended Gasparo Berti for a chair of mathematics at Sapienza. Berti was to be his successor at the university, but he died before he could take the post.

==Works==

He published &quot;Mensuration of Running Water&quot;, an important work on fluids in motion, and then his &quot;Geometrical Demonstrations of the Measure of Running Waters&quot; in which the publishing notes described him as Abbot of San Benedetto Aloysio and Mathematician to Pope Urban VIII, once a supporter of his mentor, Galileo.

He dedicated both publications to &quot;the most Illustrious, and most Excellent Prince&quot; Taddeo Barberini, a nephew of Pope Urban VIII.

<text>The New York weevil (&quot;Ithycerus noveboracensis&quot;) is a species of primitive weevil; large for weevils (12–18 mm), it is covered with fine bristles and has a regular pattern of light and dark spots. It occurs in the eastern United States and southern Canada.

The rostrum (snout) is broad and stout, while the antennae are straight and thin, with the final three antennomeres making a small club.

This weevil is found in association with various plants of Fagaceae, Betulaceae, and Juglandaceae, in particular white oak and American beech. Adults feed on new growth and other soft parts, such as leaf petioles and buds. They lay their eggs in the ground, and the grubs then eat the roots of the same plants.

Though it was originally placed in Curculionidae, coleopterists have long agreed that &quot;Ithycerus&quot; belongs in a different family, as it does not have geniculate (elbowed) antennae, a characteristic of true weevils. It has been traditionally considered as the only species in its own family, Ithyceridae, but more recent classifications place it as the sole member of the subfamily Ithycerinae in the family Brentidae.

<text>The 2nd Chapter of Acts was a Jesus music and early contemporary Christian music group composed of sisters Annie Herring and Nelly Greisen and brother Matthew Ward. They began performing in 1972 and enjoyed their period of greatest success during the 1970s. The group disbanded in 1988.

With beautiful sibling harmonies, the trio was probably influenced by CS&amp;N and AMERICA, with their unique blending of voices. It’s also possible that the harmony of the early Beatles is a backdrop for the group. The cuts that lean more toward Rock may reach a bit, although the Jesus Movement of the early 70s certainly had a say in their sound. 

== History ==

The 2nd Chapter of Acts began as a result of the trio singing at home together as Annie played the piano. Following the death of their parents (Elizabeth in 1968 and Walter Ward in 1970), Nelly and Matthew, still minors, moved in with their older sister, Annie, and her husband, recording engineer and producer, Buck Herring. Annie was a self-taught singer and songwriter who composed and played her songs around the family piano. Her brother and sister would often join in as she played, and eventually they developed extremely tight and intricate harmonies.

They started singing for local coffee houses and small gatherings, then gained the notice of Pat Boone who arranged a contract to record and release two singles with MGM, &quot;Jesus Is&quot; (1972) and &quot;I&#x27;m So Happy&quot; (1973). The fledgling trio also came to the attention of 1960s folk singer Barry McGuire, who had recently become a Christian and was preparing to record his first Christian music album, produced by Buck Herring. The siblings provided background vocals for &quot;Seeds&quot; and McGuire&#x27;s 1974 follow-up &quot;Lighten Up&quot;.

The trio released their debut album, &quot;With Footnotes&quot;, in 1974. This album featured &quot;Easter Song&quot; which would become a signature piece for the group and has been recorded by many other artists since. This was followed up with &quot;In the Volume of the Book&quot; in 1975, the year that also saw the release of a live album with Barry McGuire, &quot;To the Bride&quot;, which included &quot;a band called David&quot;, who supported 2nd Chapter of Acts on tour. 2nd Chapter of Acts&#x27; first three releases were issued by Myrrh Records, and the group toured with McGuire intermittently for three years.

The group went on a touring hiatus in 1976. Annie released her first solo record on the Sparrow Records label founded that year by the executive who had signed them to the Myrrh label, Billy Ray Hearn. For the summer of 1977, they were joined on an 18-city tour by Phil Keaggy and the result was the live triple album, &quot;How the West Was One&quot;. Their contract with Myrrh fulfilled, they moved as a group to Sparrow.

Their Sparrow debut, &quot;Mansion Builder&quot; (1978) was followed up with &quot;The Roar of Love&quot; (1980) (a concept album inspired by C. S. Lewis&#x27; &quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot;), &quot;Rejoice&quot; (1981), &quot;Singer Sower&quot; (1983), and &quot;Together Live&quot; (1983) (with Michael and Stormie Omartian). 2nd Chapter moved to their own Live Oak label with the release of &quot;Night Light&quot; in 1985, and their final recording of original material, &quot;Faraway Places&quot; in 1987.

Their voices can be heard among other Christian artists on two benefit singles in 1985. &quot;Do Something Now!&quot; credited to &quot;The Cause&quot; on Sparrow Records to aid famine relief in Africa and &quot;Fight the Fight, Rescue the Unborn&quot; which featured over 100 Christian artists, to benefit the Christian Pro-Life Movement, released on Live Oak.

2nd Chapter of Acts broadened their appeal with the release of Hymns and Hymns 2, reaching audiences with more traditional music. &quot;Hymns&quot; proved to be their best-selling release, receiving a Dove Award for &quot;Best Praise and Worship Album of the Year&quot; in 1987.

Except for two sabbatical years in 1976 and 1983, 2nd Chapter of Acts continued to tour until 1988. Their final concert was in Houston, Texas on August 12 of that year.

2nd Chapter was recognized by the Gospel Music Association in 1999 by their induction into its Gospel Music Hall of Fame.

Annie and Matthew also recorded several solo projects during the 2nd Chapter of Acts years. Both have continued to release new material and perform concerts as of 2011.

== Roles of group members ==

Annie was the main songwriter of the group and the only one who played an instrument (piano). Her admittedly unschooled compositional style, with its frequent irregular rhythms, sometimes added almost progressive rock-like elements to what was otherwise an easy listening or soft-rock sound. Matthew and Nelly initially made the occasional small contribution to the lyrics, and Matthew developed as a songwriter for the group as his solo career grew.

Annie and Matthew sang most of the solo parts. Nelly — whose voice could be hard to distinguish from Annie&#x27;s — most commonly sang lead only on songs where each member took a verse. Other songs where she sang lead were &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Go Home,&quot; &quot;Make My Life a Prayer to You,&quot; &quot;Mountain Tops,&quot; &quot;My Jesus I Love Thee&quot; and &quot;Sing Over Me.&quot; Some of the group&#x27;s albums, such as &quot;The Roar of Love&quot; and &quot;Night Light&quot;, do not have any lead vocals by her.

<text>USS &quot;Hughes&quot; (DD-410) was a World War II-era in the service of the United States Navy.

==Namesake==

Edward Merritt Hughes was born on 28 January 1850 in Lockbourne, Ohio, the son of merchant Abram A. Hughes. He was appointed to the United States Naval Academy in 1866 and graduated on 7 June 1870. He passed through the grades of Ensign, Master, Lieutenant, Lieutenant Commander, and, on 3 March 1901, was commissioned Commander.

After service on a number of ships and stations ashore, he reached the high point in his career during the Spanish–American War. He was Executive Officer of during the Battle of Manila Bay. Immediately after the action, he commanded a small boat which boarded and set fire to five Spanish ships lying in Cavite Harbor, despite reports that fuses had been set to their magazines and in the face of a large and excited armed force on shore nearby. He was advanced five numbers in rank for eminent and conspicuous conduct on this occasion. His commanding officer later wrote, &quot;The action of Lieutenant Hughes in setting fire to the enemy&#x27;s sunken ships in the face of a well armed superior, but demoralized force, was the one act of conspicuous gallantry which the battle that day afforded.&quot;

Commander Hughes died in the U.S. Naval Hospital in Yokohama, Japan on 28 September 1903.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Hughes&quot; was laid down on 15 September 1937 by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine; launched on 17 June 1939; sponsored by Mrs. Edward M. Hughes, widow of Commander Hughes; and commissioned at Boston Navy Yard, on 21 September 1939, Lieutenant Commander Donald J. Ramsey in command.

She departed San Diego on 12 January 1942 as an escort for ships bringing reinforcements to Samoa. &quot;Hughes&quot; then sailed from Samoa as part of a carrier striking force built around carrier &quot;Yorktown&quot;. She screened the carrier in strikes on Jaluit, Makin, Mili, and Canton Islands, then supported the combined –&quot;Yorktown&quot; Task Force 17 (TF17), as it attacked Japanese bases at Lae and Salamaua on 10 March 1942. Missing the Battle of the Coral Sea while escorting a tanker carrying fuel to Nouméa, &quot;Hughes&quot; reached Pearl Harbor in time to participate in the Battle of Midway.

&quot;Hughes&quot;, while protecting &quot;Yorktown&quot; during this action, shot down two torpedo planes and assisted in shooting down two others. After &quot;Yorktown&quot; was hit on 4 June, &quot;Hughes&quot; continued an all-night vigil to prevent her capture. When the carrier was torpedoed by a submarine on 6 June, &quot;Hughes&quot; helped damage the attacker with depth charges, and rescued the survivors when &quot;Yorktown&quot; sank the next day.

After a brief time as convoy escort, she joined American Forces at Guadalcanal, where she screened throughout the campaign. During the Battle of Santa Cruz. &quot;Hughes&quot; splashed one Japanese plane and assisted in downing two more. Despite her valiant efforts, &quot;Hornet&quot; was hit and sunk on 27 October 1942. Joining TF 16 on 10 November 1942, &quot;Hughes&quot; participated in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal by screening . &quot;Hughes&quot; continued screening operations until the end of February 1943.

Following a refit and brief convoy duty, &quot;Hughes&quot; was detached from the South Pacific and sailed to Pearl Harbor, departing on 18 April 1943 for the Aleutian Islands, where she arrived on 24 April. Bombardments of Kiska from 6–22 July were high points of her months in northern waters. After Kiska was occupied, &quot;Hughes&quot; departed the Aleutians for overhaul on 25 August in San Francisco, California.

Following overhaul, &quot;Hughes&quot; sailed for Pearl Harbor on 26 October 1943 to prepare for the invasion of the Gilbert Islands. She sailed on 10 November as part of the screen for the escort carriers covering the invasion of Makin Atoll. When was sunk on 24 November, &quot;Hughes&quot; rescued 152 of the survivors. She began screening the transport group on 27 November, and 2 days later departed for Pearl Harbor, and arrived there on 7 December 1943. On 13 January 1944, &quot;Hughes&quot; joined TF 53 for the invasion of the Marshall Islands. She joined in the preinvasion from 3–11 February 1944. The destroyer continued to support the escort carriers during the strikes against Palaus on 31 March 1944.

&quot;Hughes&quot; took part in the invasion of Hollandia, New Guinea on 23 April 1944, acting as a screen for the escort carrier group which provided air cover for the landings at Aitape and Tanahmerah Bay. &quot;Hughes&quot; remained off New Guinea as a convoy escort and fire-support ship of the 7th Fleet until 25 September, when she departed for the invasion of the Philippines. During this time, &quot;Hughes&quot; participated in the invasions of Biak, Noemfoor, Cape Sensapor, and Morotai, serving as flagship of Rear Admiral William M. Fechteler during the latter campaign.

During the invasion of Leyte, &quot;Hughes&quot; was the flagship of Rear Admiral Arthur Dewey Struble commanding the tiny task group detailed to capture the small islands of Dinigat and Homohon guarding the entrance to Leyte Gulf. Following the successful conclusion of this operation, &quot;Hughes&quot; screened Philippine bound convoys, making frequent trips to and from New Guinea until 6 December 1944, when she reembarked Admiral Struble and departed for the invasion of Ormoc Bay, Leyte. Following this operation, &quot;Hughes&quot; was serving as a picket destroyer off the southern tip of Leyte when she was hit by a kamikaze on 10 December 1944. Her dead and wounded totaled twenty three. Badly damaged with one engine room demolished and much of her other machinery destroyed, &quot;Hughes&quot; was towed to San Pedro Bay, Leyte, where, after temporary repairs, she departed for Humboldt Bay, New Guinea on 19 December en route to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 23 January 1945. Following more repairs, she sailed for San Francisco, arriving San Francisco Naval Shipyard on 2 February. &quot;Hughes&quot; remained there for the next 3 months undergoing extensive overhaul.

After a long testing period, &quot;Hughes&quot; was declared combat ready and departed for Adak Island in the Aleutians on 4 June 1945. Assigned to the Northern Pacific Force, she remained in the Aleutians until the end of the war, harassing enemy shipping and bombarding Japanese bases. &quot;Hughes&quot; then served as part of the patrol force off Northern Honshū until relieved on 20 October. She sailed for the United States 10 days later with Destroyer Squadron 2. She was decommissioned on 28 August 1946, and was used as a target ship in the Operation Crossroads atomic bomb test. Following the test she was towed to sea and sunk off Kwajalein on 16 October 1948, and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 26 November 1948.

<text>Del Amitri are a Scottish alternative rock band formed in Glasgow in 1980. 
Best known for their 1990 single &quot;Nothing Ever Happens&quot; which reached No. 11 in the UK and the 1995 single &quot;Roll to Me&quot;, which was a top 10 hit in Canada and the United States, they have released seven studio albums, five of which have reached the UK top 10. The group sold over six million albums worldwide.

== History ==
===Band name===
Del Amitri&#x27;s founding member and main songwriter, Justin Currie, explained in 2010 that the band&#x27;s name &quot;was invented to be meaningless – basically a corruption of the Greek name &#x27;Dimitri&#x27;.&quot; In 2018, Currie clarified that &#x27;Del Amitri&#x27; is a bastardisation of the name of a film producer who appeared in the closing credits of a film he saw in 1979: &quot;probably Dimitri-something, but we couldn&#x27;t remember... so eventually through osmosis or maybe Chinese Whispers &#x27;Dimitri&#x27; became &#x27;Del Amitri&#x27;.&quot; Many sources have repeated a claim that the name was chosen because it is Greek for &quot;from the womb&quot;, but this is untrue.

===Formation and early years (1980-1984)===
Del Amitri grew out of Justin Currie&#x27;s Jordanhill College School band whose original members were Currie (bass and vocals), James Scobbie (guitars), Donald Bentley (guitars) and Paul Tyagi (drums).

=== &quot;Del Amitri&quot; (1985) ===
In 1984, Del Amitri signed a recording contract with Chrysalis Records, which released their eponymous debut studio album in 1985.

=== &quot;Waking Hours&quot; (1989) ===

As recording started for what would become Del Amitri&#x27;s second studio album, the line-up changed. Currie and Harvie invited keyboard player Andy Alston to join the band and fired both guitarist Bryan Tolland and drummer Paul Tyagi. Tolland was replaced in the studio by Mick Slaven and Tyagi by the Commotions&#x27; Stephen Irvine. However, Slaven and Irvine chose not to join the band full-time and were replaced by David Cummings and Brian McDermott, respectively.

Released in 1989, &quot;Waking Hours&quot; reached No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart and gave the band their most successful UK single, &quot;Nothing Ever Happens&quot;, which peaked at No. 11. They also gained some mainstream exposure abroad for the first time, as &quot;Waking Hours&quot; was a success in several territories with the single &quot;Kiss This Thing Goodbye&quot; flirting with the lower reaches of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100&#x27;s Top 40. In between &quot;Waking Hours&quot; and their next album, the band released the single &quot;Spit in the Rain&quot;, which reached No. 21 in the UK.

===&quot;Change Everything&quot; (1992)===
The line-up of Currie, Harvie, Alston, Cummings and McDermott proved to be stable and successful. They stayed together to record the follow-up album &quot;Change Everything&quot;, which was released in 1992 and became the band&#x27;s biggest chart success, reaching No. 2 in the UK, being held off top spot only by Lionel Richie&#x27;s best-of collection, &quot;Back to Front&quot;. The single &quot;Always the Last to Know&quot; peaked at No. 13 in the UK, and again provided them with an entry into Top 40 in the US. The video for the song was directed by Oil Factory&#x27;s Pedro Romhanyi. Their increasing success in the US led to appearances on the television show &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; and the Woodstock &#x27;94 anniversary festival.

=== &quot;Twisted&quot; (1995) ===
&quot;Twisted&quot; was released in 1995 and peaked at No. 3 in the UK. Ash Soan joined the band as a permanent member after touring with them on drums starting in 1994; although on the album, drums were played by Chris Sharrock.

The single &quot;Roll to Me&quot;, only a moderate hit in the UK where it reached No. 22, reached the Top 10 in the US charts; this was a noteworthy achievement during an era when British acts were finding success in the US difficult.

=== &quot;Some Other Sucker&#x27;s Parade&quot; (1997) ===
Del Amitri&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Some Other Sucker&#x27;s Parade&quot;, was released in 1997 and reached No. 6 in the UK chart.

The band found it harder to capitalise on their previous successes in the US, however, and lost out on more airplay at home when their record company took the decision to withdraw the album&#x27;s planned third single &quot;Medicine&quot; in September 1997, putting out a false press story that the lyrics could be interpreted as a critique of the then recently deceased Diana, Princess of Wales.

Five years passed before Del Amitri released another album. In 1998, however, they recorded the official anthem for the Scottish World Cup squad, &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Home Too Soon&quot;. It reached No. 15 on the charts, becoming their third biggest UK hit and their last Top 20 entry to date. They also released a best of album, &quot;Hatful of Rain: The Best of Del Amitri&quot;, which was a No. 5 success in the UK Albums Chart and was accompanied by a new track, &quot;Cry to Be Found&quot;, which reached No. 40.

===&quot;Can You Do Me Good?&quot; (2002)===
The album &quot;Can You Do Me Good?&quot; was released in the spring of 2002. Both the album and the single &quot;Just Before You Leave&quot;, reached the Top 40. The band then went on hiatus.

=== Reunion tours (2014, 2018) ===
On 18 August 2013, during an interview with Terry Wogan on his BBC Radio 2 programme, Currie hinted at a Del Amitri reunion. A UK tour was subsequently announced. As part of the tour, the band played to 8,000 people in the SSE Hydro, Glasgow on 24 January 2014. A live album, called &quot;Into the Mirror&quot;, was released following the tour.

Del Amitri reformed again in July 2018, playing eight dates in seven UK cities. Their live set included a new song, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Go Back&quot;, and a cover of Twenty One Pilots&#x27; hit song, &quot;Heathens&quot;. In July 2018, Currie said that a new group album and further activity was possible.

=== &quot;Fatal Mistakes&quot; (2021) ===
On 2 March 2020, drummer Ash Soan revealed that work on Del Amitri&#x27;s seventh studio album had begun at Vada Studios in Cookhill, Worcestershire. On 8 April, Justin Currie confirmed that the band finished recording the album &quot;the night before the UK-wide lockdown&quot; began on 24 March, and that they expected to tour in January 2021, following a one-off free show in December 2020 for NHS Scotland workers. On 5 May via a short video clip, the band announced that they had signed to Cooking Vinyl.

In November 2020, the band announced new single &quot;Close Your Eyes and Think of England&quot; and released the album title &quot;Fatal Mistakes.&quot; The album was released by Cooking Vinyl on 28 May 2021 alongside bonus album &quot;Outtakes &amp; B-side&quot; (the latter of which is available for a limited period with the parent album). In its first week of release, &quot;Fatal Mistakes&quot; landed at No. 5 on the UK Album Chart, marking the band&#x27;s sixth album to reach the UK Top 10.

Del Amitri announced a tour in support of &quot;Fatal Mistakes&quot; will begin in September 2021&quot;,&quot; concluding with a hometown show at Glasgow on 20 December 2021.

Del Amitri announced through their Instagram that a new documentary on the band had been made entitled &quot;You Can&#x27;t Go Back&quot;. The film is set to premiere on British TV channel Sky Arts on September 4.

=== &quot;Every Night Has a Dawn&quot; (2022) ===
On 12 December 2022, Justin Currie and Ian Harvie appeared at the launch of the Blu-ray &quot;Disc Every Night Has a Dawn&quot; at the Glasgow Film Theatre where they took part in a Q&amp;A session following the showing of excerpts of the film which was recorded live at the Barrowland Ballroom in Glasgow on the third night of a tour finale on 11 June 2022.

=== Simple Minds Tour (2024) ===
The band joined the Simple Minds 2024 World Tour, for the UK and European legs, with dates between 15 March in Leeds to 29 March in Glasgow plus European shows in Luxembourg, Holland, Denmark, Germany, France and Italy.

<text>USS &quot;Collett&quot; (DD-730) was a World War II-era in the service of the United States Navy.

==Namesake==
John Austin Collett was born on 31 March 1908 in Omaha, Nebraska. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1929. He was killed in action during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October 1942, while commanding Torpedo Squadron 10 on the .

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Collett&quot; was launched 5 March 1944 by Bath Iron Works Corp., Bath, Maine; sponsored by Mrs. C. C. Baughman as proxy for Mrs. J. D. Collett; and commissioned at the Boston Navy Yard on 16 May 1944, with Commander James D. Collett, the brother of LCdr Collett, in command.

==U.S. service history==
===World War II===
Assigned to the Pacific Fleet, &quot;Collett&quot; reached Pearl Harbor 16 October 1944 and Ulithi 3 November. From this base, she screened the Fast Carrier Task Force (variously designated TF 38 and TF 58) for the remainder of the war. She first saw action in the air raids on Luzon and Formosa, which accompanied the advance of ground forces on Leyte, and prepared for the invasion at Lingayen from November 1944 into January 1945.

On 14 November 1944, while acting as a picket for TF 38, she was attacked by four Mitsubishi G4M &quot;Betty&quot; bombers. The ship is credited with shooting down two Betty bombers and dodging two torpedoes on this day.

In January the carriers she screened continued to launch air attacks on Taiwan, the China coast, and the Nansei Shoto, and on 16 and 17 February sailed daringly close to the Japanese coast to strike targets on Honshū before giving air cover to the invasion of Iwo Jima from 20 to 22 February.

&quot;Collett&quot; returned to Empire waters with the carrier task force to screen during air raids on Honshū 25 February 1945, joined in the bombardment of Okino Daito Shima 2 March, and returned to screening during the air strikes on Kyūshū and southern Honshū of 18 to 20 March. From 23 March to 24 April, the force concentrated its strikes on Okinawa, invaded on 1 April. On 18 April &quot;Collett&quot; joined with four other destroyers and carrier aircraft to sink Japanese submarine at .

After replenishing at Ulithi, &quot;Collett&quot; rejoined TF 58 11 May 1945 for its final month of air strikes supporting the Okinawa operation, and from 10 July to 15 August sailed with the carriers as they flew their final series of heavy air attacks on the Japanese home islands. With her squadron, she swept through the Sagami Nada on 22 and 23 July, aiding in the sinking of several Japanese merchantmen. After patrol duty off Japan, and guarding the carriers as they flew air cover for the landing of occupation troops, &quot;Collett&quot; entered Tokyo Bay 14 September 1945, and 4 days later sailed for a west coast overhaul.

===Korean War===
Remaining on active duty with the Pacific Fleet from World War II into 1960, &quot;Collett&quot; alternated local operations and cruises along the west coast with tours of duty in the Far East, the first of which came in 1946–1947. She was in the Far East upon the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, and after patrolling off Pusan from her base at Sasebo, and escorting cargo ships laden with military supplies to Korea, she sailed up the difficult channel to Inchon on 13 September to begin the preinvasion bombardment. She carried out her mission, although hit four times by counterfire which wounded five of her men, and on the 15th, returned with the invasion force, to whom she provided gunfire support once the landings had been made, as well as protective cover at sea. Her outstanding accomplishment in the invasion of Inchon was recognized with the awarding of the Navy Unit Commendation. After taking part in the Wonsan landings on 26 October, she returned to San Diego, California 18 November 1950.

Her second tour of duty in the Korean war, from 18 June 1951 to 17 February 1952, found her screening TF 77 as it conducted air strikes on the Korean east coast, training with an antisubmarine group off Okinawa, patrolling in the Taiwan Straits, and conducting shore bombardments along the coast of Korea. Similar duty, aside from bombardment, was her assignment during her third tour, from 29 August 1952 to 9 April 1953.

From the close of the Korean war, &quot;Collett&quot; served in the Far East in between 1953 and 1959. Early in 1960 she began an extensive modernization, which continued until July 1960. On 19 July 1960, &quot;Collett&quot; collided with the destroyer off Newport Beach, California, killing 11 and injuring 20, all members of &quot;Ammen&quot;″s crew. USCGC &quot;Heather&quot; rendered assistance after the collision. Despite a badly smashed bow, &quot;Collett&quot; made port under her own power, entering the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for extensive repairs. Her bow was removed and replaced with that of , an incomplete destroyer in the Reserve Fleet. On 5 November 1960, &quot;Collett&quot; departed Long Beach for coastal operations, which continued intermittently for the remainder of the year.

=== Vietnam War ===
Following repairs in 1961, &quot;Collett&quot; was home ported in Yokosuka, Japan, 1962-1964 for Seventh Fleet assignments that included participating in fleet exercises, patrolling the Taiwan Straits and the Gulf of Tonkin.

In the autumn of 1964, a Variable Depth Sonar (VDS) was installed at the Yokosuka Naval Shipyard. &quot;Collett&quot; returned to Long Beach via Australia but returned to the Seventh Fleet in 1965 for duty from May to August. Because &quot;Collett&quot; provided naval gunfire support while in the Mekong River on 19 August 1965, personnel on board that day may be eligible for VA benefits related to Agent Orange exposure according to the website benefits.va.gov.

According to the &quot;Command History USS Collett, DD 730 Westpac deployment 1966-1968&quot; document, the weapons delivery systems of the &quot;Collett&quot; during this time were three 5 inch/38 twin mounts, two fixed and trainable torpedo tubes, two hedgehog mounts, and DASH (Drone Anti-Submarine Helicopter). The ship was again home-ported in Yokosuka, Japan, 1966–1968, and performed a variety of combat missions in the Gulf of Tonkin. Her assignments included Search and Rescue (SAR), Naval Gunfire Support (NGFS), Operation Sea Dragon, and plane guarding for carriers. During her deployment, &quot;Collett&quot; was taken under fire by North Vietnamese shore batteries on five separate occasions. The ship was one of the few American vessels to serve with both HMAS Perth (D 38) and HMAS Hobart (D 39) of the Royal Australian Navy.

Per the &quot;Cruise Summary for 1969-1970&quot;, in September 1969, &quot;Collett&quot; left for a six-month deployment with the Seventh Fleet and served at Yankee Station on 27 October to 14 November. A second tour at Yankee Station from 21 December 1969 to 20 January 1970 was followed by a third tour in February when &quot;Collett&quot;&#x27;s motor whaleboat was used to rescue 7 survivors of a Navy helicopter. Later in February, &quot;Collett&quot; provided 4 days of shore bombardment in support of Operation Dung Son 3/70. On 27 February 1970, &quot;Collett&quot; arrived in Subic Bay for the journey home.

According to the website www.history.navy.mil, awards and citations presented to various personnel aboard the &quot;Collett&quot; from 1958 to 1970 include: Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal; CINCPACFLT Letter of commendation; Combat Action; Naval Unit Commendation; Navy and Marine Corps Medal; Navy Achievement Medal with Combat &quot;V&quot;; Navy Commendation Medal; Republic of Vietnam Meritorious Citation – Gallantry; Seventh Fleet Letter of Commendation; and the Vietnam Service Medal.

== Argentine service ==


In 1974, &quot;Collett&quot; and were purchased by Argentina as a supply of spare parts for other ships, and towed from San Diego to Puerto Belgrano. However, &quot;Collett&quot; was found to be in good enough condition to be worth rehabilitating.

On 17 May 1977, she was commissioned in the Argentine Navy as ARA &quot;Piedrabuena&quot; (D-29), the fourth ship in Argentine service with that name.

=== Falklands War ===
During the Falklands War, on 2 May 1982, &quot;Piedrabuena&quot; was steaming in company with the cruiser when the cruiser was sunk by the British attack submarine .
In author Michael Rossiters&#x27; &#x27;Sink the Belgrano&#x27;, (Random House, London, 2009), it says &quot;Belgrano&quot; was unable to send any Mayday signal because of electrical failure; this and poor visibility meant the two escorting destroyers, the other being , (both also ex-United States Navy vessels), were unaware of the sinking until some hours later. A total of 323 men were killed.

=== Decommissioning and fate ===
On 18 February 1985, &quot;Piedrabuena&quot; was decommissioned from and stricken from the ships&#x27; register. In November 1988, ex-&quot;Piedrabuena&quot; was sunk in a naval missile exercise, by an MM38 missile fired by the newly commissioned corvette .

== Awards ==
&quot;Collett&quot; received six battle stars for World War II service, and in addition to the Navy Unit Commendation, six battle stars for the Korean War and two battle stars for the Vietnam War.

<doc id="855707" wikidata="Q7643256" url="?curid=855707" title="Superdrag">
<text>Superdrag is an American alternative rock band from Knoxville, Tennessee, United States. They had a hit single in 1996, &quot;Sucked Out&quot;, from their album &quot;Regretfully Yours&quot;. The original lineup reunited in 2007, releasing a full-length album in 2009: &quot;Industry Giants&quot;. The same lineup reunited again in 2021.

==Career==
===Early years (1992–1995)===
Superdrag had its roots in the early 1990s when Knoxville guitar player Brandon Fisher began dating the cousin of John Davis. Davis began playing the drums in Brandon&#x27;s band, The Used (not to be confused with the Utah-based band), along with Tom Pappas.

Don Coffey Jr. joined and began playing drums with the band. Pappas switched from his guitarist role to become the band&#x27;s bass player, Fisher resumed on the lead guitar, and Superdrag was born. Davis and Coffey Jr. also played with fellow Knoxvillian Mike Smithers in 30 Amp Fuse, but left that band when Superdrag became successful.

===Elektra years (1996–1999)===
The band released three vinyl singles and their first CD EP, &quot;The Fabulous 8-Track Sound of Superdrag&quot; in 1995, and after having one of their A-sides (&quot;Señorita&quot;) on a CMJ comp, soon released their first proper full-length, &quot;Regretfully Yours&quot; in 1996 after attracting the attention of Elektra Records. Their first single, &quot;Sucked Out,&quot; was played frequently on MTV and the radio, but it would be their only mainstream hit; as a result, they were soon classified as a one-hit wonder. The video clip to the single &quot;Destination Ursa Major&quot; on the same album was Superdrag&#x27;s second and last video to make it to television.

They were given more financial support from Elektra to record their next album. The product was 1998&#x27;s &quot;Head Trip in Every Key&quot;, which included Davis playing theremin, piano, sitar, organ. It was co-produced with the band by Jerry Finn.

Elektra dropped the band from their label before they finished recording their third full-length album. Pappas left the band to pursue his own career, and the band moved east to sign with Arena Rock Recording Co., the New York-based label that had put out their &quot;N.A. Kicker&quot; 7-inch single before Elektra signed them.

===Arena Rock Recording Company years (2000–2003)===
By 2000, they had taken on a new bassist, Sam Powers, and released their third full-length album, &quot;In the Valley of Dying Stars&quot;, as produced by long-time friend Nick Raskulinecz with help from Don Coffey Jr, who was beginning to show a keen interest in life on the other side of the glass. &quot;In the Valley of Dying Stars&quot; is by far the most emotional and raw of all of their albums; and, musically, in stark contrast to &quot;Head Trip&quot;&#x27;s diverse instrumentation, &quot;Dying Stars&quot; kept to the standard rock format: guitar, drums, bass. The emotional core of &quot;Dying Stars&quot; emanates from the death of Davis&#x27;s grandfather (his namesake), to whom John had been very close and had admired dearly. Davis&#x27; feelings on the record industry also emerged in songs such as &quot;Keep it Close to Me&quot;:

I want rock and roll, but I don&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle. I know what I know, but I don&#x27;t want to feel like an asshole.

With the absence of a major label or producer to influence their sound—although Raskulinecz was originally committed to the project, he had just signed on to produce an album for Foo Fighters in Los Angeles—Superdrag continued to evolve at their own pace, and in 2002 &quot;Last Call for Vitriol&quot; once again redefined the band&#x27;s sound. Some of the songs moved toward a heavier, more alternative sound, while others were of pure Americana influence. Brandon Fisher had left the band prior to the release of &quot;In the Valley of Dying Stars&quot;, and Mic Harrison had eventually taken his place, adding a much more Americana feel to the guitar style. Prior to Harrison&#x27;s arrival, guitarist William Tyler toured with the band.

===Breakup===
Davis had turned heavily to alcohol in prior years and many of his songs were about that very topic. One night, before the release of their last album, while driving to his parents&#x27; house, Davis pulled his truck over to pray, feeling that he had finally hit rock-bottom. He described the experience as life-changing, as he stated he felt a definite answer to his prayer. He was able to get away from alcohol, but felt that Superdrag was a mouth-piece for the life he had left behind, and simply didn&#x27;t feel his heart behind it anymore. Upon completion of touring for &quot;Last Call,&quot; the band disbanded, playing one last show for Boston&#x27;s NEMO music industry conference at The Paradise Rock Club on September 5, 2003; the show was documented with a Clear Channel-produced two-disc release&quot; &quot;Instant Live: The Paradise&quot;.

===Solo projects===
Coffey is presently pursuing a career in recording and producing, operating Independent Recorders in Knoxville, Tennessee and organizing an annual multi-day rock festival, Hottfest, &quot;Donnie Hott&quot; being an inner-circle nickname for the drummer. Powers joined Guided By Voices as a fill-in bassist for their final European tour, returning to his pre-Superdrag job at Sony Music Publishing in Nashville and starting a family; a solo album is in the works from Powers. Harrison remains in Knoxville as a solo artist, with former bandmate Coffey in his backing band, often playing live shows with Knoxville rockers The High Score. Pappas plays bass and shares lead vocal duties in the Nashville rock group WHIP!.

Davis released a gospel-influenced, spiritually-centered album titled &quot;John Davis&quot; in 2005, then switched gears with an aggressive rock album, 2007&#x27;s &quot;Arigato!&quot;. He has also become a session musician, playing with Allison Moorer, which led to European touring and an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. He also plays guitar for The Astronaut Pushers, who released their debut album in 2005.

===Reunion (2007–2010)===
In July 2007, 6 reunion shows were announced, scheduled for October and November 2007. These shows featured the original lineup of Davis, Coffey, Fisher, and Pappas playing mostly from the first two Superdrag LPs, as well as one track from Davis&#x27; latest solo album.

In December 2007, two new demo tracks were posted on Superdrag&#x27;s MySpace page, hinting at a new album in the future.

On January 8, 2008, John Davis announced on the Superdrag news section that the band is reunited indefinitely, stating that &quot;Superdrag&#x27;s original line-up will reconvene in the recording studio in February to begin work on our first new recording project together since 1998&#x27;s &quot;Head Trip in Every Key&quot;.&quot;

On March 8, 2008, Superdrag visited Lake Fever Productions in Nashville and recorded four songs for an upcoming album with Jason Bullock and Joe Colvert. On March 17, 2009, the band released &quot;Industry Giants&quot;. A U.S. tour started in the spring of 2009, and after a performance on May 22, 2010 in tribute to the recently deceased Big Star frontman Alex Chilton, Superdrag again became inactive. Earlier that month, Davis joined the surviving members of Big Star during a show at the Levitt Shell in Memphis; two of the songs performed, &quot;In The Street&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Lie To Me&quot;, were later released as a 7-inch single. Pappas continues with Flesh Vehicle, Rock City Birdhouse, and Senator Pappas &amp; The Assassins; Davis, Pappas, and Sam Powers played in Warthog, a Ramones tribute band; and Davis has played with the punk band Epic Ditch.

In late 2012, bass player Tom Pappas released his first solo record: &quot;20 years of the Senator&quot;. He has been performing live as The Tom Pappas Collection with Andy Herrin of the band Cavo and *repeat repeat on drums.

In 2013, Davis, Fisher and Epic Ditch drummer Nick Slack formed a shoegaze act, The Lees of Memory, who released their debut single on the Pittsburgh label Velocity of Sound. Superdrag&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Regretfully Yours&quot;, was given its first ever vinyl issue by SideOneDummy Records that February. In a fall 2013 interview with the blog &quot;BrightestYoungThings&quot; to promote The Lees of Memory&#x27;s first single, Davis said that a vinyl issue of &quot;Head Trip in Every Key&quot; was planned. In the same interview, Davis confirmed that Superdrag had disbanded permanently.

In July 2014, SideOneDummy announced the vinyl release of &quot;Head Trip in Every Key&quot; along with &quot;Jokers W/ Tracers&quot;, a set of demos and rarities, which were released in August 2014. The label also signed The Lees of Memory for their debut album, &quot;Sisyphus Says&quot;, which was released in September 2014. The Lees have since formed a live lineup including Powers on bass, and will play the 2015 South by Southwest festival.

Starting in August 2014, Davis has posted several albums of demos on a Bandcamp account called &quot;High Bias!!! A Cassette-Based Operation ™.&quot; These include the demos Davis made for &quot;Head Trip in Every Key&quot; through &quot;Industry Giants&quot;, as well as those for his solo albums and The Lees of Memory.

Davis and Fisher have since released additional recordings as part of The Lees of Memory, including 2016&#x27;s &quot;Unnecessarily Evil&quot; 2017&#x27;s double-album &quot;The Blinding White Of Nothing At All&quot; and 2020&#x27;s &quot;Moon Shot&quot;. Davis released a one-off collaboration, &quot;We Are In the Wild and We Are Home&quot;, with Matthew Caws.

===Second reunion (2021–2023, 2024-present)===
In late 2021, the band began posting regularly on social media; among their posts included recent photos of the original lineup of Davis, Fisher, Pappas, and Coffey. The band performed at the Second Bell Festival in Knoxville on September 30, 2022. In March 2023, they were featured in an episode of the Youtube documentary series &quot;WUTK:40 Years of the Rock.&quot; In January 2022, the band confirmed that they are working on new music and that November entered the studio with Raskulinecz. Despite posting photos on social media of multiple recording sessions throughout the Winter and Spring at Rock Falcon in Nashville with Raskulinecz, and of demo sessions in Knoxville involving Davis, Coffey and Fisher, on May 30, 2023 Davis posted on the Lees Of Memory Instagram profile that the planned album, tentatively titled &quot;JINX,&quot; would instead be a solo album, and confirmed in a comment that there would be no new Superdrag album.

In late 2023, the band resumed posts on social media, changing their biography from &quot;1993-2023&quot; to &quot;Est. 1993&quot;, but did not directly announce a resumption of activities until April 2024, when they announced their first Chicago show since 2009.

<doc id="855708" wikidata="Q1180767" url="?curid=855708" title="Deacon Blue">
<text>Deacon Blue are a Scottish pop rock band formed in Glasgow during 1985. The line-up of the band consists of vocalists Ricky Ross and Lorraine McIntosh, keyboard player James Prime, drummer Dougie Vipond, guitarist Gregor Philp and bassist Lewis Gordon. In 2013, their estimated album sales stood at six million, and by 2020 were estimated to have risen to in excess of seven million, with twelve UK top 40 singles, along with two number one albums in both the United Kingdom and their native Scotland.

The band released their debut album, &quot;Raintown&quot; (1987) to critical and commercial success, with their second album, &quot;When the World Knows Your Name&quot; (1989), topping the UK Albums Chart for two weeks. The single &quot;Real Gone Kid&quot; became their first top ten single in the UK Singles Chart and reached number one in Spain. Deacon Blue followed up the success of their first two albums with &quot;Fellow Hoodlums&quot; (1991) and &quot;Whatever You Say, Say Nothing&quot; (1993). The band split in 1994 until five years later, holding a reunion gig which led on to a new album, &quot;Walking Back Home&quot; (1999). The band released another album, &quot;Homesick&quot; (2001), the last to feature guitarist Graeme Kelling following his death from pancreatic cancer in 2004. In 2006, the band recorded three new songs for a &quot;Singles&quot; album – including the single &quot;Bigger than Dynamite&quot;. 

Deacon Blue returned after a period of absence to release &quot;The Hipsters&quot; (2012), their first studio album since &quot;Homesick&quot; in 2001. The band released a further four albums following their reunion – &quot;A New House&quot;, (2014), &quot;Believers&quot; (2016), &quot;City of Love&quot; (2020) and &quot;Riding on the Tide of Love&quot; (2021) to commercial success. In 2024, they released &quot;Late 88&quot; as the lead single from their forthcoming eleventh studio album &quot;The Great Western Road&quot; (2025).

==Career==
===1985–1987: Formation and early years===
Taking their name from the 1977 Steely Dan song &quot;Deacon Blues&quot;, Deacon Blue were formed in 1985 following Ricky Ross&#x27;s move from Dundee to Glasgow. Along with Ross, the group originally consisted of Lorraine McIntosh, James Prime, Dougie Vipond, Ewen Vernal and Graeme Kelling.

Ross, a former school teacher originally from Dundee, was the group&#x27;s frontman, penning the majority of Deacon Blue&#x27;s songs. He married vocalist Lorraine McIntosh in 1990. In 1986, the band contributed a track (&quot;Take the Saints Away&quot;) to a compilation cassette entitled &quot;Honey at the Core&quot;, featuring then up-and-coming Glasgow bands, including Wet Wet Wet, The Bluebells, Kevin McDermott (singer-songwriter), The Big Dish, and Hue and Cry.

===1987–1991: &quot;Raintown&quot; and &quot;When The World Knows Your Name&quot;===
The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Raintown&quot;, produced by Jon Kelly was released in 1987. It spawned the singles &quot;Dignity&quot;, &quot;Chocolate Girl&quot; and &quot;Loaded&quot;. The city that the album&#x27;s title refers to is Glasgow and the cover art of the album is a photograph (by the Scottish-Italian photographer Oscar Marzaroli) of the River Clyde&#x27;s docks taken from Kelvingrove Park. It proved a commercial success and has to date sold around a million copies, peaking in the UK Albums Chart at no. 14 and remaining in the charts for a year and a half. On 27 February 2006, &quot;Raintown&quot; was reissued as part of Columbia&#x27;s Legacy Edition series. The reissue was expanded to two CDs, the first of which featured the original 11 track album. The second CD featured alternate cuts of all 11 album tracks, as well as the two original CD bonus tracks &quot;Riches&quot; and &quot;Kings of the Western World&quot;. The new edition did not include the varied bonus cuts (remixes and b-sides) that were found on the singles from the album.

The second album, 1989&#x27;s &quot;When the World Knows Your Name&quot;, was the band&#x27;s most commercially successful, reaching No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart and generating five UK top 30 hits, including &quot;Real Gone Kid&quot;, &quot;Wages Day&quot;, and &quot;Fergus Sings the Blues&quot; (all five singles from the album were top 10 hits in Ireland). The following year saw the band play in front of an estimated 250,000 fans at the free concert on Glasgow Green, &quot;The Big Day&quot;, which was held to celebrate Glasgow being named that year&#x27;s European City of Culture. The band also played Glastonbury and the Roskilde festivals that summer, as well as released &quot;Ooh Las Vegas&quot;, a double album of B-sides, extra tracks, film tracks, and sessions which reached No. 3 in the UK Albums Chart.

===1991–1994: Continued success and split===

Jon Kelly returned to the producer&#x27;s chair in 1991 for the album &quot;Fellow Hoodlums&quot;. The album was met with more critical approval and peaked at No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart. &quot;Fellow Hoodlums&quot; was followed up by 1993&#x27;s &quot;Whatever You Say, Say Nothing&quot;, a much more experimental album. The album was not as commercially successful as the previous two albums, peaking at No. 4 on the UK Albums Chart. Changing from producer Jon Kelly to the team of Steve Osborne and Paul Oakenfold, this album presented a change in musical style for Deacon Blue. While the band&#x27;s songwriting remained based in rock and blues, many of the tracks moved into alternative rock territory in their presentation.

The band embarked on another sold out UK tour in 1994, after recording new material for their greatest hits compilation album, &quot;Our Town&quot;. This saw the band return to No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart and was one of the year&#x27;s top sellers, while &quot;I Was Right and You Were Wrong&quot; and a re-release of &quot;Dignity&quot; saw the band re-enter the Top 20 of the UK Singles Chart. The album contained the previous singles from the band, minus &quot;Closing Time&quot; and &quot;Hang Your Head&quot;. The album also contained three new tracks. &quot;I Was Right and You Were Wrong&quot;, the first single from this album, was an alternative rock track that continued and expanded the musical direction the band had taken with &quot;Whatever You Say, Say Nothing&quot;. &quot;Bound to Love&quot; and &quot;Still in the Mood&quot; were pop songs in the tradition of Deacon Blue&#x27;s earlier albums. The vinyl LP version of the album contained a fourth new track, &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot;. &quot;Dignity&quot; was released, now for the third time, as the second single from the album.

With Vipond&#x27;s decision to quit the group in favour of a career in television, Deacon Blue split up in 1994.

===1999–2012: Re–union and &quot;Walking Back Home&quot;===
Five years later, the band held a reunion gig in 1999, and this led on to a new album, &quot;Walking Back Home&quot;, with the band now working on a part-time basis. The &quot;Walking Back Home&quot; album combined eight songs that were brand new compositions, previously unreleased tracks, or released only with limited availability, with nine previously released Deacon Blue songs. This was followed by another album, &quot;Homesick&quot;, in 2001. Graeme Kelling died from pancreatic cancer in 2004, but the band continued and recorded three new tracks for a &quot;Singles&quot; album – including the track &quot;Bigger than Dynamite&quot; in 2006.

The band performed at Manchester United&#x27;s Old Trafford stadium, as the pre-match entertainment for the Rugby league Super League Grand Final on 14 October 2006, and continued on to a full UK tour in November. They were also due to open Stirling&#x27;s New Year party in 2006, but this was cancelled at the last minute due to extreme weather. A further tour followed in November 2007 and the band then provided support for Simple Minds in 2008. They also appeared at Stirling&#x27;s Hogmanay in 2008.

Deacon Blue appeared at The Homecoming Live Final Fling Show, at Glasgow&#x27;s SECC on 28 November 2009, and headlined Glasgow&#x27;s Hogmanay on 31 December 2009. The band performed several gigs, including Glastonbury, and the Liverpool Echo Arena on 29 July 2011. Ross, who had released a solo album before the formation of Deacon Blue, released two solo albums during the time between Deacon Blue&#x27;s breakup in 1994 and reformation in 1999. Due to Deacon Blue&#x27;s part-time status after reformation, Ross released additional solo albums in 2002 and 2005 and has written for and with other recording artists. In 2009, Ross and McIntosh recorded an album together under the name &#x27;McIntosh Ross&#x27;.

===2012–2018: New record label and subsequent releases===

Deacon Blue last released a studio album in 2001, which was &quot;Homesick&quot; and in 2006, they released a compilation album, &quot;Singles&quot;. In 2012, it was announced Deacon Blue had new management, Paul Loasby and Tom O&#x27;Rourke, and had signed a recording contract and would release a new album that year.

To promote the upcoming release of their new album, the group released a single, &quot;The Hipsters&quot;. The single was released in the United Kingdom on 23 September 2012. The album &quot;The Hipsters&quot; was released on 24 September 2012 and was produced by Paul Savage. A 25th anniversary tour, starting in October 2012, followed. The band performed with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra at the Grand Hall in Glasgow to promote the release of the album. All of the band&#x27;s studio albums were reissued as deluxe editions by Edsel Records in October 2012, as well as a new compilation entitled &quot;The Rest&quot;. Deacon Blue arranged dates in 2014 for a comeback tour. It was announced in April 2014 that their seventh studio album, &quot;A New House&quot;, would be released on 8 September that year. Deacon Blue also performed at the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games closing ceremony on 3 August 2014, performing their hit, &quot;Dignity&quot;.

A new studio album, &quot;Believers&quot;, was released on 30 September 2016. Three promo singles, the title track, &quot;This Is A Love Song&quot; and &quot;Gone&quot; have been released. A tour was undertaken to promote the album, culminating in a return to the Glasgow Barrowlands on 4 December 2016, which was recorded for a live album as well as video. This was released on 31 March 2017 on vinyl, CD, DVD, Blu-Ray as well as digital download of both audio and video versions. A special screening event was held, the day before, at the Glasgow Film Theatre.

Between February and March 2018, Deacon Blue embarked on a tour of Spain, marking the first time that the band has played a series of live shows in Spain. The band described the shows as &quot;an incredible experience for us all&quot;, and later confirmed that Deacon Blue will be returning to Spain in 2019 for another series of live shows, stating that &quot;Spain has a very special place in our hearts&quot;.

===2018–2025: &quot;City of Love&quot; and &quot;Riding on the Tide of Love&quot;===

The band released their ninth studio album entitled &quot;City of Love&quot; on 6 March 2020, to critical acclaim. The album received positive reviews and achieved commercial success. The album charted at number one in their native Scotland, number four in the United Kingdom and peaked at number fifty in Spain.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the band recorded and released their tenth studio album entitled &quot;Riding on the Tide of Love&quot; which was released in February 2021. The album failed to reach the same level of commercial success in the United Kingdom that the band experienced with their previous album, &quot;City of Love&quot;, with the album debuting at number 23 on the charts, spending only one week before dropping out of the UK Top 100 album charts. In their native Scotland, the album performed better, debuting at number two and spending additional weeks within the Scottish Top 40 albums charts.

To promote the release of the album, the band announced the &quot;Riding on the Tide of Love&quot; tour which is scheduled to begin in June 2021 in Brighton and concludes on 19 December 2021 at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow. In September 2023, they released the compilation album &quot;All The Old 45s – The Very Best of Deacon Blue&quot; via Cooking Vinyl. It debuted at number two on the official Scottish Albums Charts on 8 September, behind only &quot;Back To The Water Below&quot; by Royal Blood. It would go onto spend eight weeks within the Top 100 of the Scottish Albums Charts. In the United Kingdom, it was a moderate success, debuting at number forty-two on the official UK Albums Charts, spending one week within the Top 100. The band embarked on a tour of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, beginning in September 2023, to promote the release of &quot;All the Old 45s&quot;.

===2025–present: &quot;The Great Western Road&quot; and arena tour===

The bands eleventh studio album, &quot;The Great Western Road&quot;, is scheduled to be released on 21 March 2025. During the same month, they are set to embark on an arena tour across the United Kingdom and Ireland which includes their first date at the Wembley Arena in London since 1990. The tour will conclude with two shows at the OVO Hydro in their native Glasgow. The album is said to be a reflection of the bands journey since they first began performing during the 1980s, with lead single &quot;Late 88&quot; being said to be a &quot;fondly reminder of the care-free excitement of those early days&quot; for the band. The album was recorded at Rockfield Studios.

<doc id="855711" wikidata="Q2632762" url="?curid=855711" title="Arab Strap">
<text>Arab Strap are a Scottish indie rock band whose core members are Aidan Moffat and Malcolm Middleton. The band were signed to independent record label Chemikal Underground, split in 2006 and reformed in 2016. The band signed to Rock Action Records in 2020.

==History==
Vocalist and drummer Aidan Moffat and multi-instrumentalist Malcolm Middleton grew up in Falkirk, Scotland, and bonded over their mutual love for Drag City recording artists such as Will Oldham (who at the time recorded under the name Palace Brothers) and Smog. They began collaborating in 1995, and their debut album, &quot;The Week Never Starts Round Here&quot;, was released the following year. At this point Gary Miller and David Gow joined the band and became the rhythm section, creating a more dynamic live experience when the band started touring.

Over the course of their ten-year existence, Arab Strap worked with numerous musicians, including Jenny Reeve and Stacey Sievewright, as well as Adele Bethel, who went on to form Sons and Daughters. Stuart Murdoch of Belle &amp; Sebastian featured on the album &quot;Philophobia&quot;, but the Belle &amp; Sebastian album/song &quot;The Boy with the Arab Strap&quot; would later create something of a feud between Moffat and Murdoch.

Arab Strap&#x27;s marked characteristics include sordid, personal, yet honest, lyrics – described by the &quot;NME&quot; as &quot;fly on the duvet vignettes&quot;. Like fellow Scottish band The Proclaimers, their lyrics are sung in their native Scots tongue. At first essentially an electro-acoustic band with a brooding, spare sound, later albums and gigs saw them develop a fuller sound that drew deeply on both indie and dance music.

Arab Strap&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;The Week Never Starts Around Here&quot; (1996) and &quot;Philophobia&quot; (1998), depicted the desperate decadence of post-Thatcherite Britain. The former album&#x27;s &quot;The First Big Weekend&quot;, a five-minute piece of drunken mayhem that end with a joyous singalong, &quot;Went out for a weekend, lasted forever/Got high with our friends, it&#x27;s officially summer,&quot; which was later also used as the chorus to &quot;Hey!Fever,&quot; one of the tracks on the EP &quot;The Girls of Summer&quot; the following year. The 1999 live album, &quot;Mad for Sadness&quot;, demonstrated how the sometimes spare recorded sound of their early music could lift into a celebration of a sexually empty, drug- and alcohol-dependent life. After these albums, Arab Strap&#x27;s music became much more musically polished, but continued to focus on drink, drugs, and existentially bereft versions of sexuality. 

In keeping with the theme of sexual allusion, Moffat records as a solo artist under the name Lucky Pierre (later changed to L Pierre) – slang for the man in the middle of a gay threesome. This work is also characterised by a brooding, spare sound, but is instrumental in nature. Middleton also has a solo career under his own name, releasing two albums with Chemikal Underground and three more via Full Time Hobby Records.

On 9 September 2006, the band announced on their website that they were to split up. They celebrated the ten years since their first studio album with the release of a compilation record, &quot;Ten Years of Tears&quot;. They went on tour in Europe for the last time at the end of the year, and played their final show at the end of a secret tour of Japan at Shibuya O-Nest on 17 December 2006.

===Post-breakup and 2016 reunion===
In a 2008 interview, Middleton stated: &quot;It was a good time to call it a day. Unless there&#x27;s a definite need and desire for us to play, I don&#x27;t think we should ever get back together. We always said we would [collaborate again] when we split up, but I think maybe it&#x27;s still too soon. Maybe in a few years when we&#x27;ve got time, we&#x27;ll maybe try something for a laugh. Who knows?&quot;

In December 2009, &quot;Monday at the Hug &amp; Pint&quot;, &quot;The Red Thread&quot; and &quot;The Last Romance&quot; entered &quot;The Skinny&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Scottish Albums of the Decade&quot; list at no. 7, 12 and 25 respectively.

In April 2010, the &quot;Scenes of a Sexual Nature&quot; box-set was released, featuring early albums, live recordings, and a newly recorded track. The following year Moffat and Middleton released a cover version of Slow Club&#x27;s new single, &quot;Two Cousins&quot;, under the name &quot;Two Cousins 1999&quot;. Moffat noted, &quot;It&#x27;s not an Arab Strap performance as such, rather it&#x27;s the two guys who used to be Arab Strap recording their own, informed pastiche&quot;. On 17 November 2011, the band reformed for a one-off show as part of Glasgow venue Nice N Sleazy&#x27;s 20th birthday celebrations.

In an interview in April 2013, Middleton said that he would be open to the idea of future gigs, but cast doubt on any more Arab Strap records: &quot;I think, with Arab Strap, it was good at the time. But we could only write songs of that ilk at a certain age. So I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll ever record again but it might be good to do a gig&quot;.

On 11 June 2016, a new website for the band was revealed with a countdown and a lone statement, &quot;Hello Again&quot;, teasing a reformation. Arab Strap confirmed on 15 June that they had reformed for three shows at London&#x27;s Electric Brixton, Manchester&#x27;s O2 Ritz and Glasgow&#x27;s Barrowland Ballroom, all scheduled for October 2016, marking the band&#x27;s 20th anniversary. With this announcement, the band released a new version of their debut single, titled &quot;The First Big Weekend of 2016&quot;, as remixed by Miaoux Miaoux. They later added a second date in Glasgow (after the first one sold out in under half an hour) and a warm-up date in Newcastle. A string of festival dates in 2017 followed.

===Return to full-time band===
In August 2019, ahead of the release of his third studio album, &quot;Human Don&#x27;t Be Angry&quot;, Middleton&#x27;s website updated to state that they &quot;[were] currently working on a new album for release in 2020&quot;. On 1 September 2020, the band issued their first new material in 15 years, with the release of the single &quot;The Turning of Our Bones&quot;, which was reported to be the A-side of an upcoming 7&quot;, with the B-side of the single being &quot;The Jumper&quot;.

On 24 November 2020, the band announced their seventh album, &quot;As Days Get Dark&quot; – their first in 16 years – would be released on Rock Action.

In February 2021, Arab Strap released the music video for &quot;Here Comes Comus!&quot;. The controversial music video was directed by Bryan M. Ferguson.

&quot;As Days Get Dark&quot; was released on 5 March 2021. They have continued to gig since, both as a full band and as an acoustic duo featuring Moffat and Midddleton. Middleton also started a new band with musician Joel Harries called Lichen Slow, who released their debut album in March 2023.

In September 2022, the song &quot;The Turning of Our Bones&quot; was used over the opening credits for the TV series &quot;Karen Pirie&quot;.

In March 2023, Arab Strap announced a string of acoustic gigs to mark the 25th anniversary of &quot;Philophobia&quot;, touring in late 2023 until January 2024.

In January 2024, the band announced their eighth studio album, &quot;I&#x27;m Totally Fine with It Don&#x27;t Give a Fuck Anymore&quot;, with the first single &quot;Bliss&quot;. The album was released on Rock Action on 10 May 2024.

<doc id="855712" wikidata="Q409888" url="?curid=855712" title="Aishiteruze Baby">
<text>is a Japanese romance manga series written and illustrated by Yoko Maki. It was serialized by Shueisha in &quot;Ribon&quot; from April 2002 and January 2005 and collected in seven bound volumes. It was adapted as a 26-episode anime television series produced by TMS Entertainment and Animax, broadcast in Japan on Animax from April to October 2004. The series is about a teenage boy, Kippei, who becomes the caretaker of his five-year-old cousin, Yuzuyu, after her mother abandons her. Both the manga and anime have been praised for successfully mixing serious issues with a light-hearted tone.

==Plot==
&quot;Aishiteruze Baby&quot; is a series that revolves around the life of Kippei, a popular high-school playboy who flirts with any girl he sees, without thinking about their feelings. His life is turned upside down when one day his aunt abandons his five-year-old cousin Yuzuyu at his house. Kippei is assigned the task of taking care of Yuzuyu for the time being, and he must learn how to become the &quot;mother&quot; she needs. As Kippei learns how to care for Yuzuyu, he also learns to care for Kokoro, a quiet girl at his school, who helps him out.

In Japanese, is a casual, masculine way of saying &quot;I love you&quot; (see &quot;Gender differences in spoken Japanese&quot;).

==Characters==
:
:Kippei is a 17-year-old promiscuous high school student, well known for his playboy habits. However, due to his friendly personality, he is very popular at school. One day, his 5-year-old cousin, Yuzuyu, is suddenly placed in his care. At first, Kippei is unsure of how to take care of his cousin. When he realizes that taking care of Yuzuyu is a full-time job, he drops his promiscuous ways. As the story progresses, Kippei matures quickly into a responsible &quot;parent,&quot; making sure Yuzuyu is his top priority. Not only does Kippei wake up early every day to make Yuzuyu lunch, but he also walks her to and from her preschool. In addition, he cares for Yuzuyu&#x27;s psychological well-being in the absence of her mother. Meanwhile, Kippei also pursues his love interest, Kokoro Tokunaga, whom he finds to be a great woman. Eventually, Kippei, realizing how lonely Kokoro is living by herself, asks his family to let her move in with them, which they quickly agree to. Near the end of the manga, Yuzuyu&#x27;s mother returns to take Yuzuyu back but Kippei&#x27;s mother refuses until her sister can prove to her that she is ready. Despite this, and his attachment to Yuzuyu, Kippei understands that she needs her mother and insists on letting Yuzuyu leave with her mother. At the end of volume seven, about 10 years have passed. Yuzuyu appears to be a happy teen and Kokoro is still living with Kippei, presumably they have married (which now makes her Kokoro Katakura). The manga ends with Yuzuyu&#x27;s letter to Kippei, thanking him for taking care of her when she was young.
:
:Yuzuyu (&quot;Yuzu&quot; for short) is a bubbly little 5-year-old girl. Having been abandoned by her mother, Yuzuyu begins to adapt to her new life with Kippei as her guardian. As the story progresses, Yuzuyu grows very attached to Kippei. When Yuzuyu meets Kokoro, she is scared Kokoro will take Kippei away from her. However, she eventually warms up to Kokoro and they become friends. Throughout the series, Yuzuyu struggles with the absence of her mother and is often seen crying herself to sleep. Yuzuyu tries her best in hopes that her mother will one day come back for her which conflicts with her wish to stay with Kippei. At the end of volume seven, Yuzuyu is a happy teenager who has reunited with her childhood friend, Shouta. She starts most of her sentences with &quot;yuzu&quot;-(ゆず).
:
:Kokoro is a pretty classmate of Kippei. Because she lost her mother at a young age, she has a quiet personality. Her father quickly remarried and left Kokoro to fend for herself in a luxurious apartment, believing that because she was quiet, she would prefer to live alone. This is not the case, however, and she feels extremely lonely living by herself with no one else to rely on. Kokoro initially despises Kippei for his promiscuous ways. However, after seeing how gentle he is and how much he cares for Yuzuyu, Kokoro begins to fall in love with him. Kokoro sympathizes with Yuzuyu and understands Kippei&#x27;s responsibility for Yuzuyu. As such, she lets him get away with a lot of idiotic behavior. At the end of volume six, for a brief time, Kokoro believes she&#x27;s pregnant, only to find out that it was a false alarm. However, she admits to Kippei that she had hoped she was pregnant, despite the problems that would arise, because it would mean that she would be able to spend more time with him. Soon after, Kokoro moves in with Kippei&#x27;s family. At the end of the manga, Kokoro and Kippei are living with his parents and it is implied that they are married (which now makes her Kokoro Katakura).
:
:Misako is Kippei&#x27;s mother who is a school crossing guard, among other things. She teaches Kippei how to cook, starting with &quot;onigiri&quot; (rice balls) because they are Yuzu&#x27;s favorite food. She is the older sister of Aunt Miyako (Yuzu&#x27;s biological mother).
:
:Better known as &quot;Nee-chan&quot; (or &quot;Sis&quot; in the English version), Reiko is Kippei&#x27;s bold and controlling older sister. She is a cosmetologist and everyone in Kippei&#x27;s family follows her orders. She is known for her stylish outfits and nails. She has a secret which she reveals to Kippei late in the series that she cannot have any children. This greatly influences how she feels about Aunt Miyako for abandoning Yuzuyu.
:
:Miyako is the younger sister of Misako and the biological mother of Yuzuyu. She found that taking care of Yuzuyu by herself after her husband had died was more than she could handle. She later admits to Kippei that she once struck Yuzuyu and it is inferred that her fear of doing so again is the main reason why she left Yuzuyu with his family. She intends to come back once she can be a proper mother to Yuzuyu. At the end of the manga, she returns and takes Yuzuyu back. Years later, Yuzuyu is shown to be a healthy and happy teen.
:
:Satsuki is Kippei&#x27;s 12-year-old brother. He is very intelligent and mature for his age, so much so that he seems emotionless. Although he doesn&#x27;t like children in general, he gets along with Yuzuyu very well. Near the end of the story it is assumed that Ayumi and Satsuki are in a relationship.

; and 
:&quot;Voiced by:&quot; Maki Saitō (Aki) and Fuyuka Oura (Mai)
:Kokoro&#x27;s friends. They, and especially Aki, don&#x27;t approve much of Kokoro and Kippei&#x27;s relationship, given his past actions and reputation. Rather than being busybodies, they really just want what is best for Kokoro. Aki is in love with Shin.
:
:One of Yuzuyu&#x27;s best friends and her first love. Kippei is unhappy that Yuzuyu has a crush on him. When Shouta first meets Yuzuyu, the two become instant friends and begin to do everything together. Shouta loves his family dearly, however, he has been abused by his mother for some time. When Yuzuyu witnessed Shouta being hit, she began to cry and scream, and the entire preschool, as well as the parents, found out about him and his mother. Kippei is greatly affected by Shouta&#x27;s being abused and tries to help by talking to the child&#x27;s mother. Shouta later gets a concussion from a fall, precipitated by his mother, which results in a trip to the hospital. The doctors notice the signs of previous injuries and on their recommendation his parents decide to go into family counseling and move in with Shouta&#x27;s grandparents for more support. When he leaves, he promises Yuzuyu that he will always be her friend. While separated, they remain in contact with each other. Eventually, he and Yuzuyu meet again as teenagers.
:
:Miki is Yuzuyu&#x27;s 14-year-old cousin on her father&#x27;s side. Volume 4 of the manga is mostly Miki&#x27;s story. In the manga, she carries a knife, which was changed to a bike chain in the anime. Miki attended a prestigious school where she witnessed a teacher beating a fellow classmate. When she confronted her teacher, everything backfired. She was harassed by her peers and teacher, but refused to tell her parents. Kippei notices the burns and scars on her wrists, indicating that Miki engaged in self-harm. She tries to take Yuzuyu away from the Katakura residence so that her parents will have a substitute for her when she attempts suicide, which Kippei prevents. (In the anime, she intends to jump from a building, in the manga she uses a knife.) In the end, the issues between her and her parents are resolved. She appears again in Volume 6.

; and 
:&quot;Voiced by:&quot; Aoi Yūki as Aoi Yabusaki (Marika) and Yūtarō Honjō (Ken)
: Yuzuyu&#x27;s friends from preschool. While Marika can be quite stuck-up for a five-year-old, Ken is kind and strong. Marika develops a crush on Kippei-onii-chan (as Yuzuyu calls Kippei) after he catches her when she trips – to the point that when her mother arrives to pick her up, she demands that her mother provide her with an onii-chan of her own. She is also jealous of the girls with whom he shows up at the pre-school (usually Kokoro). Marika is Yuzuyu&#x27;s best friend.
:
:Kippei&#x27;s friend and classmate. He and Aki have feelings for each other.
:
:Called &quot;Nattsu&quot; for short, she is Kippei&#x27;s former &quot;girlfriend&quot; (more of a &quot;friend with benefits&quot; since it is implied that they have had sexual intercourse in the past). Since Yuzuyu&#x27;s arrival, Nattsu misses hanging out with Kippei the way they used to. Although she enjoyed spending time with him, Nattsu had no interest in having a serious relationship with Kippei. The distance enforced by Kippei&#x27;s responsibilities towards Yuzuyu have made Nattsu realize that she really cares for him (and has had feelings for him for some time). Unfortunately for her, her previous indifference means that she has lost her chance at Kippei since he is now serious about Kokoro.
:
:Ayumi is Satsuki&#x27;s classmate and works part-time as a model. She is four centimeters taller than Satsuki and secretly in love with him. Ayumi&#x27;s friends decide to twit her about her feelings for Satsuki by making up rumors about Satsuki&#x27;s preferences in girls which are the exact opposite of her appearance. Undaunted, she builds up the nerve to confess to him and is pleasantly surprised when Satsuki tells her that he does not mind any of her traits. She is later seen eating dinner at the Katakura house and is presumed to be Satsuki&#x27;s girlfriend.

; and 
:Akari is Kippei&#x27;s classmate and her sister, Aya, goes to Yuzuyu&#x27;s daycare where they are friends. Their situation is similar to that of Kippei and Yuzuyu in that Akari must take care of her sister because her parents are always working. Akari confides in Kippei which, among other things, results in trouble. They only appear in the manga.
:Itagaki is a boy from Kippei&#x27;s school who has a crush on Kokoro. He confesses to her and even forces a kiss on her, scaring Kokoro and making her afraid of being touched, even by Kippei. Everything is resolved during a school trip when Kippei warns Itagaki that he will kill him if he does anything to Kokoro. After this, Itagaki no longer appears in the manga.

==Media==
===Manga===
The manga &quot;Aishiteruze Baby&quot; was written and illustrated by Yoko Maki. It was serialized by in &quot;Ribon&quot; magazine from April 2002 to January 2005 by Shueisha. The serial chapters were collected in seven &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes under the Ribon Mascot Comics imprint. It is licensed in North America by Viz Media, which has released all seven volumes in English starting in April 2006. It is also licensed in France by Génération Comics, in Italy by Panini Comics, in Germany by Tokyopop Germany, and in South Korea by Seoul Media Group.



===Anime===
&quot;Aishiteruze Baby&quot; was adapted into an anime television series by TMS and Animax. It was directed by Masaharu Okuwaki, with music by Miki Kasamatsu and character designs by Junko Yamanaka and Masatomo Sudo. The opening theme was &quot;Sunny Side Up&quot; performed by Yo Hitoto, and the ending theme was performed by Yo Hitoto.

The series was initially broadcast in 26 episodes across Japan on Animax from 3 April 2004 to 9 October 2004. It is licensed in France by Taifu Video.

==Reception==
According to the German manga journal &quot;MangasZene&quot;, &quot;Aishiteruze Baby&quot; is drawn in a style of manga, with non-uniform panel layouts and frequent use of screentones. The reviewer praised the clean use of backgrounds, well-differentiated character designs, and Maki&#x27;s handling of delicate issues such as the rival, Miki, and parental abandonment, while still keeping a comic tone. The same article described anime adaption as one of the anime highlights of 2004. The reviewer criticized the art of the anime adaptation as not as successful as the manga, being done in a simpler style, but praised the Japanese voice actors as well as mood-setting of the opening song, &quot;Sunny Side Up.&quot;

A reviewer at &quot;THEM Anime Reviews&quot; praised the anime as &quot;a touching and heartfelt drama,&quot; giving it 5 out of 5 stars. The reviewer cited the character of Yuzuyu as part of the success, as &quot;a kid who actually acts like a kid and not like a little adult.&quot; The reviewer noted that the animation was &quot;somewhat low-budget,&quot; and that the character designs only somewhat resemble the Maki&#x27;s designs in the original manga.

<text>Glenfield is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Glenfield is located 36 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Campbelltown and is part of the Macarthur region.

==History==
Glenfield was named after the property founded by early colonial surgeon and explorer, Charles Throsby. According to local authorities and Campbelltown City Library, the property was named after the Glenfield in Leicestershire, England, where Throsby was born and brought up. Many of the streets in the suburb have links to British names, such as Canterbury Road, Cambridge Avenue and Trafalgar Street.

The name was first used when Glenfield railway station was built in 1869 although a village didn&#x27;t begin to develop until 1881 when the first subdivision of the paddocks were marketed. A public school opened in a tent the following year and a local post office was established in 1899. Hurlstone Agricultural High School also moved to Glenfield in the 1920s. However, the suburb did not really develop until the 1950s and 1960s.

===1968 Siege===
Glenfield gained notoriety in 1968 as the site of a hostage siege which ended in bizarre circumstances with the NSW Commissioner of Police Norm Allen acting as witness to the wedding of gunman Wally Mellish and hostage Beryl Muddle. The incident was made into the movie &quot;Mr Reliable&quot; starring Colin Friels and Jacqueline McKenzie.

==Climate==
==Population==
According to the , Glenfield had a population of 10,536 people with higher than average numbers of couples with children (57.1%). 46.0% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were India 9.3%, Nepal 4.7%, Bangladesh 4.4%, Philippines 3.6% and China 3.1%. 40.4% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Bengali 5.9%, Nepali 5.8%, Arabic 3.7%, Hindi 3.6% and Mandarin 3.3%. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 18.5%, No Religion 17.4%, Hinduism 16.0%, Islam 11.9% and Not stated 8.1%. Most occupied private houses in the area are separate houses (69.2%) with a substantial number of townhouses (28.1%).

==Housing==

A number of new residential subdivisions have been developed in the north-western corner of Glenfield in the area bounded by Campbelltown Road and Glenfield Road. These developments are called Panorama, Vista at Panorama, Glenfield Circuit &amp; Parkside Glenfield and are mixed density housing comprising duplex and freestanding housing.

Panorama, Vista at Panorama estates are community titled with amenities such as pool, tennis courts, security patrols and barbecues that are available for exclusive use of residents. Community activities such as cocktails nights, family fun days and street Christmas parties are also organized by a third-party company to encourage a close knit community atmosphere.

==Transport==
Glenfield railway station is a major interchange station for South-West Sydney. It is the junction for the East Hills railway line and the South West Rail Link and the Main Southern railway line. The station received a major upgrade as part of the South West Rail Link, including construction of an overhead concourse, multi-storey car park, new, fourth platform and conversion of a terminating platform to a through platform. The new railway line west to Leppington opened on 8 February 2015, meaning trains now serve Glenfield from the north, south, east and west.

The M5 South Western Motorway and Hume Highway sit on the western border of Glenfield. Additionally, the Westlink M7 is also close to its western border.

<doc id="855717" wikidata="Q47535995" url="?curid=855717" title="Alcoholic ketoacidosis">
<text>Alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) is a specific group of symptoms and metabolic state related to alcohol use. Symptoms often include abdominal pain, vomiting, agitation, a fast respiratory rate, and a specific &quot;fruity&quot; smell. Consciousness is generally normal. Complications may include sudden death.
AKA most commonly occurs in long term alcoholics and less commonly in those who binge drink. Onset is generally after a decreased ability to eat for a few days. Diagnosis is generally based on symptoms. Blood sugar levels are often normal or only mildly increased. Other conditions that may present similarly include other causes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis including diabetic ketoacidosis.
Treatment is generally with intravenous normal saline and intravenous sugar solution. Thiamine and measures to prevent alcohol withdrawal are also recommended. Treatment of low blood potassium may also be required. Those who are affected are most frequently between the ages of 20 and 60. The condition was initially recognized in 1940 and named in 1971.

==Signs and symptoms==
Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are commonly present and people may also have tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension. In contrast to diabetic ketoacidosis, people with alcoholic ketoacidosis are usually alert and lucid despite the severity of the acidosis.

==Causes==
Alcoholic ketoacidosis is caused by complex physiology that is the result of prolonged and heavy alcohol intake, usually in the setting of poor nutrition. Chronic alcohol use can cause depleted hepatic glycogen stores and ethanol metabolism further impairs gluconeogenesis. This can reduce glucose availability and lead to hypoglycemia and increased reliance on fatty acid and ketone metabolism. An additional stressor such as vomiting or dehydration can cause an increase in counterregulatory hormones such as glucagon, cortisol and growth hormone which may further increase free fatty acid release and ketone production. Ethanol metabolism can also increase blood lactic acid levels (lactic acidosis), due to pseudohypoxia, which may also contribute to a metabolic acidosis.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is generally based on symptoms. An elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis and ketosis is the classic present. However, a mixed acid-base disorder may be present especially if vomiting is contributing to a hypochloremic alkalosis. The ketone which is present is mostly beta-hydroxybutyrate rather than acetoacetate resulting in only a weakly positive nitroprusside test. People usually do not present with high blood sugar or sugar in the urine. This can cause false negative results when testing urine ketones as they only measure acetoacetate. Ethanol level are often low or negative despite a chronic alcohol use history. Electrolyte disturbances may include hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia may also be present.

===Differential diagnosis===
Other conditions that may present similarly include other causes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis such as diabetic ketoacidosis, toxic alcohol ingestion, and starvation ketosis. Toxic alcohol ingestion includes methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning. Pancreatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, and gastritis may also result in similar symptoms. The ratio of beta-hydroxybutryate to acetoacetate is usually higher in AKA (8:1) in contrast to diabetic ketoacidosis (3:1).

==Management==
Treatment includes administration of intravenous saline to rehydrate and 5% dextrose to turn off gluconeogenesis. Electrolyte imbalances, specifically hypokalaemia, should be corrected. Thiamine supplementation is often included to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy. Insulin is generally not used due to risk of hypoglycemia. Other potential causes of the symptoms should be ruled out.

== Prognosis ==
Outcomes are generally favorable with treatment but up to 10% may develop cardiac arrest. It is proposed that alcoholic ketoacidosis is a significant cause of death among people with chronic alcoholism although the true prevalence is unknown. Estimation of prevalence and outcomes of this population is limited by difficulty in diagnosing the condition and the presence of multiple disorders at presentation.

==History==
In 1940, Edward S. Dillon, W. Wallace, and Leon S. Smelo, first described alcoholic ketoacidosis as a distinct syndrome. They stated that &quot;because of the many and complex factors, both physiologic and pathologic, which influence the acid-base balance of the body, a multitude of processes may bring about the state of acidosis as an end result&quot;.

In 1971, David W. Jenkins and colleagues described cases of three non-diabetic people with a history of chronic heavy alcohol misuse and recurrent episodes of ketoacidosis. This group also proposed a possible underlying mechanism for this metabolic disturbance, naming it alcoholic ketoacidosis.

<doc id="855719" wikidata="Q1284871" url="?curid=855719" title="Dutugamunu">
<text>Dutugamunu (, ), also known as Duṭṭhagāmaṇī Abhaya, was a king of the Anuradhapura Kingdom who reigned from 161 BC to 137 BC. He is renowned for first uniting the whole island of Sri Lanka by defeating and overthrowing Elara, a Tamil king from the Chola Kingdom, who had invaded the Anuradhapura kingdom in 205 BC. Dutugamunu also expanded and beautified the city of Anuradhapura and projected the power of the Rajarata kingdom across the island of Sri Lanka.

Due to his significance as one of the most potent symbols of Sinhalese historical power, Dutugamunu&#x27;s story is swathed in myth and legend. However, many aspects of the accounts of his life have been verified by contemporary inscriptions, and the basic account of his life is generally accepted as accurate.

== Etymology ==

Dutugamunu (, ) is also known in Pali as Duṭṭhagāmaṇī Abhaya. The Mahavamsa describes how as a youth he mocked his father Kavantissa, king of Ruhuna, for refusing to wage war against the powerful King Elara who ruled Sri Lanka for 45 years and known and venerated by the Sinhalese as a Just King or Dharmista Elara*, He ruled what was then known as the island of Ratnadiva from Anuradhapura. Duttagamni, the prefix Dutta means terror-inspiring, rustic or rowdy2* stated that &quot;If [his] father were a man he would not speak thus&quot; and sent him a piece of women&#x27;s jewellery. The resulting fury of the king caused many of his friends to flee to Malaya region and the prince himself being dubbed &quot;Dutthagamani&quot;, meaning &quot;disobedient&quot;. After his death, he was referred to as &quot;Dharma Gamini&quot; (&quot;righteous Gamini&quot;), but it is as Duttha Gamini or Dutugemunu that he is known to posterity.

== Ancestry and family ==
The Mahavamsa constitutes the major source of Dutugemunu&#x27;s reign and dedicates some six chapters (out of 35) to his tale. In chapter 22 he is described as being descended from the ancient royal family of Rajarata through Devanampiyatissa&#x27;s brother Mahanaga. At the time of his birth, Dutugemunu&#x27;s father was Kavantissa, king of Ruhuna, a small kingdom in south-east Sri Lanka outside of the influence of Rajarata in the north; the border between the two polities was the Mahaganga, or &#x27;Great River&#x27;, possibly the modern Menik Ganga. Kavantissa is portrayed in the Mahamvamsa as &#x27;devoutly believing in the three gems, [and] he provided the brotherhood continually with...needful things&#x27;.

Dutugemunu&#x27;s mother was Viharamahadevi, daughter of Tissa, king of Kalyani. Legend has it that as punishment for Tissa slaying a Buddhist monk, Kalyani had been subject to a series of deluges from the sea. To placate it Tissa placed his daughter Devi in a golden boat with the words &#x27;A King&#x27;s Daughter&#x27; written on the side and set her out to sea. Miraculously the princess washed ashore, alive and well, in Ruhuna, and married Kavantissa.

During her pregnancy with Dutugemunu, Viharamahadevi had a series of peculiar cravings, including the urge to sleep on a pillow made of honeycombs. In particular, her urge to drink the water used to wash a sword that had cleaved the head of a warrior of Elara, whilst standing on that same head, raised the interest of the soothsayers at court, who predicted that &#x27;The queen&#x27;s son, when he has vanquished the Damilas (Tamil) and built up a united kingdom, will make the doctrine to shine forth brightly&#x27;. Viharamahadevi gave birth to a son named Gamani Abhaya sometime later, and after that to another child, a boy named Tissa.

Around the time of Gamani&#x27;s birth, &#x27;an elephant of the six-tusked race brought his young one thither and left him here and went his way&#x27;. Named Kandula, he went on to become Gamani&#x27;s mount and accompanied him through much of the prince&#x27;s adventures.

Dutugemunu&#x27;s sister

&quot;Recent archaeological studies have found evidence proving that King Kavantissa had a daughter who was a sister to King Dutu Gemunu&quot;.
New evidence to this appeared in The Island of March 27, 2017.

== The battle in the palace and early reign ==

By the age of sixteen Gamani was &#x27;vigorous, renowned, intelligent and a hero in majesty and might&#x27;, if a little wayward. Determined to expel the invading king of Rajarata, Gamani levied an army from around Rohana and declared his intention to regain the north to his father. The king forbade this stating that &#x27;the land on this side of the river is enough&#x27;; the resulting exchange between father and son saw Gamani being dubbed &#x27;Duttha Gamani&#x27;, his friends fleeing to Malaya, and he himself being incarcerated in a royal prison.

Kavantissa is known as a brilliant strategist who recognized early that he needed to make his kingdom powerful before waging war against the invaders. He assembled armies and made his kingdom prosperous in &quot;rice and betel leaf&quot; - this meant that the people had a lot of agricultural surplus. The legendary ten &quot;great giants&quot; - men who had great strength – are brought into the army at this time. Kavantissa repeatedly makes Dutugemunu and Tissa swear that they would never fight one another and that they would always respect and listen to the advice of the priests. He also makes the ten giants swear never to pick sides in a war between the brothers.

Upon Kavantissa&#x27;s death, Dutugemunu found himself having to defend his crown against his younger brother Tissa, who had seized possession of not only the elephant Kandula but the dowager queen Viharamahadevi as well. The war between the two began with a defeat for Dutugemunu at Culanganiyapitthi, where &#x27;many thousands of the king&#x27;s (Dutugemunu&#x27;s) men&#x27; perished. Dutugemunu was forced to flee back to Mahagama where he levied another army and engaged Tissa in yet another battle in the vicinity of the city. Legend has it that as Tissa, fought his brother riding the royal elephant &quot;Kandula&quot; against Dutugemunu who rode a mare. Dutugemunu at one point made the mare jump over the elephant causing the elephant to recognize its master and attempt to kill Tissa who hastily dismounted via a tree. Dutugemunu was victorious and Tissa was smuggled off the battlefield disguised as the corpse of a monk. It is said that Dutugemunu recognized the ploy and called out to his brother &quot;Are you not ashamed to be carried on the back of these priests?&quot; Some time afterwards, however, Dutugemunu and Tissa were reconciled through the efforts of Viharamahadevi and the monks, and Tissa became one of the king&#x27;s foremost generals.

== Gaining of Rajarata ==
Having secured his throne, he then planned his operations to conquer the north, which included not only Rajarata but numerous smaller semi-independent polities. The king&#x27;s army consisted of &#x27;chariots, troops and beasts for riders&#x27;, soldiers and a number of war elephants, as well as a number of monks (to advise the King) and a relic placed in his spear for luck and blessings. In addition he was accompanied by the famed Ten Giant Warriors who had been recruited from all over the island by his father Kavantissa – Nandhimitra, Suranimala, Mahasona, Theraputtabhya, Gotaimbara, Bharana, Vasabha, Khanjadeva, Velusamanna, and Phussadeva.

The campaign saw Dutugemunu subduing a number of usurping Tamil rulers in the north (as many as 32, according to the Mahavamsa). Of particular interest is the four-month siege of Vijitanagara, where the defending Tamil troops are said to have used &#x27;red-hot iron and molten pitch&#x27; to panic Dutugemunu&#x27;s elephants. During this time he also married Ran Etana, the daughter of a chieftain who continued to pay homage to Elara of Anuradhapura. On at least two occasions victory is attributed to the king&#x27;s &#x27;cunning&#x27; and the bravery of Kandhula. The campaign reached a climax at the eastern gate of Anuradhapura, where Dutugemunu, riding Kandhula, finally confronted the aged usurped king Elara, on his own elephant Mahäpabbata, and slew him with a spear; the encounter is one of the most famous in Sri Lankan history.

Dutugemunu&#x27;s victory at Anuradhapura put him in the unprecedented position of ruling nearly the entire island of (Sri) Lanka. Despite this, however, his position was far from problem-free. Elara, despite being an invading Tamil from the Chola empire of south India, was renowned as having been a just and righteous leader, and Dutugemunu went out of his way to ensure the memory of the old king was revered as he cremated Elara and built a tomb for his ashes and made rules for travellers to get off and pay their respects to his tomb. Furthermore, &#x27;looking back upon his glorious victory, great though it was, [he] knew no joy, remembering that thereby was wrought the destruction of thousands of both enemies and his soldiers&#x27; but the casualties mentioned in Mahavamsa is greatly exaggerated. This is attested to by the sheer number of religious foundations attributed to him by the chronicles (between 68 and 99), which include magnificent stupas, monasteries, and shrines.

== Reign and construction work ==

Aside from his many construction projects Dutugemunu&#x27;s reign is memorable for his estrangement from his son, Saliya or Salirajakumara. The Prince fell in love with a girl called Agokamaladevi or Asokamala; unfortunately for all concerned she was of the Scavenger caste, one of the lowest castes in Sinhalese society. Saliya refused to give her up and rejected the throne. Though the Mahavamsa mentions no reconciliation, folk stories have the young couple eventually restored to the king&#x27;s good graces.

The king&#x27;s reign also saw extensive contact between Sri Lanka and traders from the west, including Arabs, Persians, and possibly Romans

Following the consolidation of his position Dutugemunu began a series of huge construction projects, many of which still survive in Anuradhapura today. As with nearly everything in Dutugemunu&#x27;s life, each foundation comes with its own legend, many of which reveal the preoccupations and inclinations of ancient Sinhalese society.

The first foundation mentioned in the Mahavamsa is the Maricavatti vihara, the modern Mirisavetiya. Legend has it that traveling to the shore of the Tank of Tissa with the &#x27;women of the harem&#x27; for a water-festival, Dutugemunu planted his spear (which contained a sacred relic) in the soft ground. When preparing to return to the palace, he found that neither he nor anyone in his presence could pull it out. Taking this as a sign he ordered the construction of a stupa over the spear.

Dutugemunu also ordered the construction of the Lohapasada, or Brazen Palace, a nine-story chapter house for monks, which derived its name from its bright copper-tiled roof. Again, legend has it that the design for the palace was based on a building seen in one of the heavens by a group of monks, who drew the design with &#x27;red arsenic on linen&#x27; and dispatched it to the king.

Perhaps his most famous creation was the Ruwanweliseya, also known as the Great Stupa or Swarnamalee Chetiya, to house the begging bowl of the Buddha. The construction was started on the full moon day of the month of Vesak (traditionally the date of the birth, enlightenment, and passing away of the Buddha) with the creation of a foundation of crushed rock. To hammer the stones into place elephants were used with their feet bound in leather. Dutugemunu is said to have overseen the work personally, being present at the construction of the relic chamber and the interring of the bowl itself. The dedication of a stupa is described in Chap. 29 of the Mahavamsa, which lists the visit of delegations from various parts of India, as well as a delegation of 30,000 monks from Alexandria of the Caucasus, led by the Indo-Greek monk Mahadharmaraksita.

Other notable works include the construction of a stupa in Mundeshiwari, current day Bihar, India.

== Spiritual relationship with god &quot;Kataragama&quot; ==

Stories relating to some of the king&#x27;s constructions reflect a spiritual relationship with the Kataragama deviyo. Two such sites are &quot;Henakaduwa Purana Raja Maha Viharaya&quot; at Tangalle and &quot;Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Devalaya&quot;.

During the period of preparations for war with Elara, the Kataragama deity appeared in front of King Dutugemunu and gave him a sword for him to use in the war at the present-day site of &quot;Henakaduwa&quot; temple (&quot;hena&quot; and &quot;Kaduna&quot;, meaning thunder and sword respectively in Sinhalese).

After defeating Elara in single combat in the Battle of Vijithapura and subsequently regaining power in the country, the Kataragama deity appeared yet again before Dutugemunu while the latter was in meditation at &quot;Kiri Vehera,&quot; Kataragama. The victorious king asked the deity what should be done in return for the deity&#x27;s help in winning the battle. The god replied by shooting an arrow in the direction of &quot;Wedihiti Kanda&quot; from &quot;Kiri Vehera&quot; and instructed Dutugemunu to build a shrine where the arrow lands.

== Death and succession ==
King Dutugemunu did not live to see his beloved Ruwanweliseya completed, dying before the plaster work was finished. The Mahavamsa dedicates an entire chapter to his death, which contains a poignant scene where the dying king is taken by palanquin to the vicinity of the incomplete stupa. There he also encounters his old colleague Theraputtbhya, now a monk. After some discussion of the mortality of men, the aged monarch passes away and is immediately reborn in the heavenly realm of Tusita.

A common folk tale surrounding the death of King Dutugemunu is that as he was dying he was told that Ruwanweliseya was completed in order to keep him happy. The well-intentioned plan went awry, however, when Dutugemunu asked to be shown the finished building. His brother Tissa had the entire building draped in white cloth to present the illusion of whitewash, and due to his failing eyesight Dutugemunu did not spot the difference, dying convinced that the building was finished.

Following his death Dutugemunu was succeeded by his brother Saddhatissa, rather than his disinherited son Saliya.

== In popular culture ==
*2015 film Maharaja Gemunu emphasized the life of Dutugamunu until his fight with King Elara. Uddika Premarathna stars as Dutugamunu in the film. The film was directed by Jayantha Chandrasiri.
*The teledrama &quot;Gemunu Maharaja&quot; was telecasted on Hiru TV. Character was portrayed by Malinda Perera.
*The 1982 novel &quot;Winds of Sinhala&quot; is a fictionalized take on Dutugemunu&#x27;s campaign to defeat King Elara

<text>Staropramen Brewery (Pivovary Staropramen s.r.o.) in the Smíchov district of Prague is the second largest brewery in the Czech Republic. It was founded in 1869 and the brand name Staropramen, literally meaning “old spring”, was registered in 1911. It is owned by Molson Coors and its products are exported to 37 countries, mostly in Europe and North America.

==History==
Staropramen Brewery&#x27;s history begins in 1869 when shares for a &quot;Joint Stock Brewery in Smíchov&quot; were offered for sale. The brewery building was completed and beer first brewed in 1871. The Ostravar Brewery opened in 1898 followed a year later by the Braník brewery; these two breweries would later merge with Staropramen. 

Due to competition from other Prague breweries, the brand name Staropramen, which translates as &quot;old spring&quot; (water source), was registered in 1911. After the First World War, all three breweries saw a period of sustained growth, and by the 1930s Staropramen was the largest brewery in Czechoslovakia. Under communist rule after the Second World War, all Czechoslovakian breweries were nationalised, including Staropramen. After communism ended in 1989, the brewery, along with the Braník and Měšťan breweries, became in 1992 part of the Prague Breweries group (Pražské Pivovary), which by 1996 came under control of the Bass company. Bass brought Ostravar into the group in 1997, then in 2000 sold its brewing operations to Interbrew, which merged with AmBev in 2004 to form Inbev. Staropramen has seen steady growth and is currently the Czech Republic&#x27;s second largest beer producer with a 15.3% share of the domestic market.

In mid October 2009, private equity fund CVC Capital Partners bought all of Anheuser–Busch InBev&#x27;s holdings in Central Europe (including Staropramen) for €2.23 billion. They renamed the operations StarBev. In April 2012, Molson Coors bought StarBev.

In May 2023, it was announced that English actor Orlando Bloom is the new brand ambassador for Staropramen beer.

<doc id="855728" wikidata="Q7304577" url="?curid=855728" title="Red McCombs">
<text>Billy Joe &quot;Red&quot; McCombs (October 19, 1927 – February 19, 2023) was an American businessman. He was the founder of the Red McCombs Automotive Group in San Antonio, Texas, a co-founder of Clear Channel Communications, a past chairman of Constellis Group, a onetime owner of the San Antonio Spurs, San Antonio Force, Denver Nuggets, the Minnesota Vikings, and the namesake of the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin.

In 2022, &quot;Forbes&quot; placed the value of McCombs&#x27; fortune at $1.7 billion.

==Early life==
McCombs was born in rural Spur in Dickens County in West Texas, United States. His nickname &quot;Red&quot; came from his hair color. His father was a mechanic who earned $25 per week but tithed through the First Baptist Church of Spur each week. McCombs recalled having seen his parents &quot;share with those who had less, and the joy of giving never ceased to amaze me.&quot;

== Business career ==

In 1958, McCombs and his fellow salesman, Austin Hemphill, moved to San Antonio to create Hemphill-McCombs Ford, which was the foundation for what ultimately became the Red McCombs Automotive Group. McCombs served as chairman of the trustees at Southwestern University and chairman of the University of Texas&#x27;s M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. His particular interest in M.D. Anderson was accentuated in 1986, when he visited a dying friend undergoing treatment there. He expressed how he was overcome by the kindness of every employee he met at the hospital. The workers, he found, had been trained to offer compassion and solace to all who come through the doors. He joined the Anderson board and in 2005 donated $30 million to the hospital. The business school at the University of Texas at Austin was renamed the Red McCombs School of Business in recognition of his $50 million donation to the institution. The $50 million actually yielded $100 million in matching funds for new faculty positions, fellowships, and scholarships.

He was the board chairman of Academi.

In 2017, McCombs filed a $1 million civil suit against seven of his former executives who he alleged took &quot;trade secrets&quot; from McCombs&#x27; company to begin a competing firm in Houston, F4 Resources. Defendants in the suit include William &quot;Bill&quot; Forney Jr., who worked with McCombs for forty-four years, former chief financial officer Ricky Halkin, vice president of operations Larry Wyont, vice president of land Charles Forney, and the vice president of geology, Philip Forney. McCombs had established McCombs Energy in Houston in 1998 by merging his 50 percent interest in his partnership with William Forney with other assets purchased from Forney. McCombs claimed that his former associates, however, lowered the proper payout that he was due from his investments. McCombs said that the former executives shattered personal relationships of some four decades.

==Sports ownership==
McCombs attributed the construction of the HemisFair Arena as the essential development to the success of the San Antonio Spurs. He contacted Lee Iacocca, then president of the Ford Motor Company, to seek funding for the arena to correspond with the 1968 World&#x27;s Fair. At first, Iacocca offered only $250,000 for the purchase of an art object, and he scolded McCombs and ridiculed San Antonio as &quot;that little old dusty ass town of yours down there [with] no political or economic significance to the Ford Motor Company.&quot; McCombs persisted and asked U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson to contact Henry Ford II, and in a continued heated exchange even told Iacocca that Ford needed to improve the quality of its 1968 vehicles. McCombs located other investors, and the Dallas Chaparrals came to San Antonio five years later in 1973. McCombs realized the importance of television to sports events and saw the opportunity to bring San Antonio to a national stage. Under the McCombs administration, the Spurs had their first superstar in George Gervin, called &quot;The Iceman&quot;, who was recruited from the Virginia Squires.

Two years after taking the Spurs into the NBA, McCombs sold off his stake in the Spurs and bought another former ABA team, the Denver Nuggets. He held onto the team from 1978 until 1985, when he sold it to Sidney Shlenker. He then bought the Spurs in 1989 and ran them until he sold them in 1993. In 1998, McCombs bought the Minnesota Vikings for US$250 million. After an unsuccessful attempt to replace the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, McCombs sold the team to new (and current) owner Zygi Wilf before the 2005 NFL season. McCombs was also actively involved in thoroughbred racing and breeding for many years as a major partner in Walmac Farm, a leading American breeding farm, in Lexington, Kentucky.

McCombs was one of the first investors of the Circuit of the Americas. In December 2020 he got his &#x27;own&#x27; corner called &#x27;Big Red&#x27;.

==Controversy==
McCombs owned a piece of property surrounded by National Forest near Wolf Creek ski area, a resort in southern Colorado owned by the Pitcher family. McCombs had long wanted to develop a resort community on his property, a plan that has drawn opposition and lawsuits from environmentalists and surrounding communities. McCombs had been unsuccessful in his attempts to convince the court to remove a key roadblock preventing his proposed development. McCombs then attempted to build a casino resort at Navajo Canyon on Lake Powell. The local Navajo Nation chapters, local government officials, all unanimously rejected the casino proposal and any projects by McCombs.

In 2013, McCombs was found by the United States Supreme Court to have engaged in a sham tax avoidance transaction and was therefore liable for a valuation misstatement penalty.

McCombs severely criticized the 2014 University of Texas hire of Charlie Strong as football coach. He described Strong as &quot;great position coach ... not on a par with other candidates.&quot; Three days later he apologized and pledged &quot;total support&quot; for Strong.

== Personal life and death ==
McCombs was a reformed alcoholic, who could &quot;handle his social drinking&quot; until the age of 48, when overcome with convulsions he went into a five-day coma at a medical facility in Houston. McCombs said in a Christmas 2016 interview, &quot;God was good to me and for whatever reason wanted me to live, because I was really dead when I left in 1975 to go to Houston on that medical plane. They told Charline, &#x27;Go ahead and start making arrangements because we are losing him.&#x27;&quot; McCombs said that he recovered and never again had a desire for alcohol. 

The McCombs Foundation has donated more than $118 million to charity. It is operated by his daughters, who work to keep overhead at a minimum. The foundation makes small donations too, such as $1,000 to Mothers Against Drunk Driving, which are rarely publicized. McCombs had said that he was a large donor to charitable causes because &quot;it makes me feel so good about doing it.&quot;

McCombs contributed $40,000 to Donald Trump&#x27;s 2020 presidential campaign.

McCombs was married to Charline Hamblin from 1950 until her death on December 12, 2019. McCombs died at his home in San Antonio on February 19, 2023, at the age of 95.

<doc id="855730" wikidata="Q3475167" url="?curid=855730" title="Lincoln Acres, California">
<text>Lincoln Acres is an unincorporated community of San Diego County located wholly within the boundaries of the incorporated city of National City. It has a population of approximately 2,100 residents, and residents may keep livestock. Lincoln Acres has a fire station and library. The community relies on the San Diego County Sheriff&#x27;s Office to provide police protection. Sheriff Deputies from the Imperial Beach station police the neighborhood. The United States Postal Service once listed the zip code 91947 as being located within Lincoln Acres for P.O. Box use, however the post office has since closed and residents receive mail under the zip code 91950. The community is in area code 619.

==History==
Lincoln Acres was first settled during the Great Depression, mainly by farmers from the Midwest, to have small farms. It was named after Abraham Lincoln. Over time the farms became residential homes, and the population became mostly Mexican Americans. During World War II, there was one combat casualty from Lincoln Acres, Jerry Lee O&#x27;Hagen. In 1967, there was an unsuccessful attempt to annex Lincoln Acres into National City for zoning and sewer system purposes. In 1981, the community was considered as a potential location for adult businesses displaced by redevelopment of downtown National City to relocate. By 1975, the community had largely expanded to its limits, and only saw an 11% growth of population from 1975 to 1995. In 2019, a county commissioned approved the annexation of a quarter acre, adjacent to the Interstate 805 and California State Route 54 interchange, of Lincoln Acres into the City of National City.

==Significant organizations and properties==
===La Vista Cemetery===
The largest plot of land in Lincoln Acres is filled by the La Vista Cemetery. The cemetery has a large section that is considered an endowed cemetery, meaning money is set aside for regular maintenance and upkeep, and a non-endowed side, known as Rest Haven, where no money is set aside for maintenance, and therefore the families of those buried there are responsible for maintaining their grave sites. This means that in the Rest Haven side, there are tilted headstones and old, off-kilter wooden crosses marking the graves. People construct their own headstones for the inexpensive plots, creating a personal, individual experience for family and friends of those interred there.

===Library===
The first library in the community began in 1940. Lincoln Acres is served by a branch of the San Diego County Library system, and the previous building was originally built in 1945. It was purchased from the Civil Conservation Corps in Vista, and moved to its final location in 1961. At the beginning of construction of the new library building, the branch was the smallest in the County Library system. On August 6, 2010, ground was broken for a new library which would be more than three times larger than the old location. It opened in 2013, and tripled the size of the branch from its 854 square feet original size. It includes a reading room named for a late volunteer of the library, who was killed in Chula Vista in 2007; a scholarship is also awarded in his name yearly to a child within the community. After it was completed, Chicano Park muralist Sal Barajas worked with members of the community to create a mural on the new building.

===Lower Sweetwater Fire Protection District===
While Lincoln Acres relies on the County of San Diego for governmental services, there is one elected body that is exclusive to Lincoln Acres; the Lower Sweetwater Fire Protection District. In 1945 the fire district was formed, and a firehouse was erected next to the site of the library. , the fire district owns no fire trucks nor has any firefighters on its payroll. This special district has a board of three members who have the sole task of administering a $155,473-a-year contract with the National City Fire Department, which provides fire protection to the community. The contract is paid for by Lincoln Acres landowners&#x27; property taxes.

After the November 2006 elections, only one person was currently serving on the fire district board: Butch Fimpel. On January 9, 2007, the County Board of Supervisors appointed Mary Martinez to the board. Martinez had been previously serving on the board, but did not run for re-election in November 2006. The third remaining seat on the board remains vacant. The board meets monthly and the positions are unpaid, though in the past the board members were paid $20 per meeting.

In 2002 there was an attempt to dissolve the Lower Sweetwater Fire Protection District, &quot;Proposition R,&quot; but the measure failed when 156 Lincoln Acres residents voted against dissolution, defeating the measure by 62%. Only 29% of the community&#x27;s 882 registered voters went to the polls that day, but many of those who did vote feared dissolution of the fire district would lead to the community&#x27;s annexation to National City.

<text>The  () is an ancient legal injunction of restraint employed by a person who believes they are being wronged by another at that moment. It survives as a fully enforceable law to this day in the legal systems of Jersey and Guernsey, and is used, albeit infrequently, for matters affecting land.

==History==
The &quot; was used by landowner Asselin FitzArthur to object to the burial of William the Conqueror. According to Asselin, the church where the king was to be buried was built on land unlawfully seized from his family.

==Procedure==
The procedure is performed on one&#x27;s knees before at least two witnesses, in the presence of the wrong-doer, and in the location of the offence. The &quot; with his hand in the air must call out —

Following this, the &quot; must recite the Lord&#x27;s Prayer in French.

On hearing this, the alleged wrong-doer must cease his challenged activities until the matter is adjudicated in court. Failure to stop will lead to the imposition of a fine, regardless of which party is in the right. If the &#x27; is found to have called &#x27; without a valid reason, he in turn must pay a penalty.

The &quot; in Guernsey requires that a grace be said after the Lord&#x27;s Prayer:

Furthermore, the grievance must be put in writing and lodged at the within 24 hours.

==Limitations==
&quot;&quot; can be overruled. For instance, in 1778 the States of Guernsey decided to erect 15 loophole towers at various points on the coast to impede any French incursion on the island. Although most of the towers were built on the commons, or on public land above the high-water mark, three towers were to be built on private land. The States were of the opinion that the project was of such importance that if necessary they would exercise eminent domain, &quot;notwithstanding any or any opposition whatsoever&quot;.

A &#x27; can also be denied by a court. In 2010, Guernsey&#x27;s Deputy Bailiff denied a couple&#x27;s attempt to invoke the &#x27;, in a potential eviction action by a bank that had lent the couple money to build a home.

==Recent uses==
The &#x27; was raised in Guernsey in December 2016 to block the forcible removal of a derelict Kia Sportage from private land. Earlier that same year, a threat to use the &#x27; was issued, in an effort to stop the redevelopment of a garden and war memorial in Guernsey.

On 14 August 2018 local resident Rosie Henderson attempted to use the &quot; to stop the narrowing of the South Esplanade in Saint Peter Port, Guernsey, which she said would be a danger to both pedestrians and motorists. The court refused to register her clameur, because she does not own the land in question.

In 2021, it was used in Jersey as an attempt to prevent an eviction. The &quot; was ruled as having been raised incorrectly in court on the grounds that the person raising it had lost legal title to the property and it could not be used to block court officials carrying out a court order.

In 2023, a Jersey woman invoked the &quot;&quot; to halt a parish worker from trimming trees overhanging a road which ran through her property. She contended that the road had been illegally widened and therefore, the trees belonged to her, not the parish. When the matter was adjudicated, the Royal Court found that the procedure had been raised incorrectly and fined the litigant £1000. Meanwhile, legal costs to the parish were estimated to amount to £70,000.

In 2023, a Devon man invoked the &quot;clameur&quot; in Guernsey over the wrongful sale of his family home by a private interest who should have required his consent.

Their first two studio albums, &quot;Songs for Polarbears&quot; (1998) and &quot;When It&#x27;s All Over We Still Have to Clear Up&quot; (2001), released by independent record label Jeepster Records, were commercially unsuccessful. The band signed to Polydor Records, in 2002 and Connolly joined as lead guitarist.

Their major-label debut album, &quot;Final Straw&quot;, was released the following year. &quot;Run&quot;, the record&#x27;s biggest hit, saw the band rise to national fame as part of the post-Britpop movement. The album was certified 5× platinum in the UK. In 2005, McClelland left the band and was replaced by Paul Wilson. Their next studio album, &quot;Eyes Open&quot; (2006), and its hit single &quot;Chasing Cars&quot;—reported in 2019 to be the most-played song of the 21st century on UK radio—propelled the band to greater international fame. The album topped the UK Albums Chart and was the best-selling British record of the year. Snow Patrol released their fifth studio album, &quot;A Hundred Million Suns,&quot; in 2008; their sixth, &quot;Fallen Empires&quot;, in 2011; their seventh, &quot;Wildness&quot;, in 2018; and their eighth, &quot;The Forest Is the Path&quot;, in 2024. Quinn and Wilson left the group in 2023.

During the course of their career, Snow Patrol have won seven Meteor Ireland Music Awards and been nominated for six Brit Awards and one Grammy. &quot;Final Straw&quot;, &quot;Eyes Open&quot;, and &quot;A Hundred Million Suns&quot; have sold ten million copies worldwide, combined.

==History==
===Early years (1994–1997)===
Snow Patrol were formed in early 1994 by University of Dundee students Gary Lightbody, Mark McClelland, and Michael Morrison under the name Shrug. The band started by performing gigs at the university and local pubs such as Lucifer&#x27;s Mill. Their first EP was entitled &quot;The Yogurt vs. Yoghurt Debate&quot;. In 1996, they changed their name to Polarbear to avoid clashing with any American bands that were also named Shrug. Shortly afterwards, drummer Michael Morrison left the group after suffering a breakdown and returned to Northern Ireland. In mid-1997, Polarbear released a three-track EP, &quot;Starfighter Pilot&quot;, on the Electric Honey label. The band was renamed Snow Patrol in 1997, because of a naming conflict with a band named Polar Bear, fronted by ex-Jane&#x27;s Addiction bassist Eric Avery.

===&quot;Songs for Polarbears&quot; and &quot;When It&#x27;s All Over We Still Have to Clear Up&quot; (1997–2001)===
Snow Patrol joined independent label Jeepster in 1997. Jeepster had the same plan for Snow Patrol as the approach they had used with Belle &amp; Sebastian, who became popular by word of mouth without heavy promotion. The band were happy to be associated with an indie label, because they felt it gave them greater independence. They were quoted as saying that Jeepster would not expect them to have a strict work ethic or to focus too much on promotional efforts.

Snow Patrol&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Songs for Polarbears&quot;, was released in 1998 after the band had moved to Glasgow, where Lightbody was working at the Nice n Sleazy&#x27;s Bar in Sauchiehall Street. The album was a critical success but did not make a commercial impact. The same year, the band came close to being featured in a worldwide advertisement for Philips, but Gomez was ultimately signed. In 1999, Snow Patrol won the &quot;Phil Lynott Award for Best New Band&quot; given by Irish music magazine &quot;Hot Press&quot;. In 2001, while still living in Glasgow, the trio released their next album, &quot;When It&#x27;s All Over We Still Have to Clear Up&quot;. Like its predecessor, the album was praised by critics but did not sell.

The band began to work harder and tour more. They slept on fans&#x27; floors after concerts and pretended to be members of Belle &amp; Sebastian to get into nightclubs. They owed rent to their landlords and received regular visits and letters from them while on tour. After the failure of the second album, Snow Patrol began to realise that the label&#x27;s relaxed attitude towards management and record promotion, which had initially attracted them, was perhaps holding them back. The band&#x27;s manager at the time, Danny McIntosh, who was described by Lightbody as &quot;the angriest man in pop: great, great man&quot;, has said that he loved the band &quot;with every atom in his body&quot; and was never angry towards them. He owned a gold-coloured splitter bus, in which the band travelled to concerts. Lightbody has credited McIntosh with keeping the band together in those years.

Jeepster dropped Snow Patrol in 2001, a decision that was criticised by &quot;Hot Press&quot; magazine as brainless. By July 2001, major labels had started showing interest in the band, who were cash-strapped and had no record deal. Lightbody sold a major part of his record collection to raise money to keep the band going. The singer said this time was &quot;miserable&quot;, but he was confident that they would get signed to another label. The music scene in the United Kingdom had turned its attention to American bands, however, and British bands were not being signed. The group spent this time writing songs. Lightbody assembled The Reindeer Section, a Scottish supergroup, and found a record label to release the project&#x27;s recordings. Quinn said that although the time was hard for everyone involved except Nathan, the question of splitting never arose. It was during this time that the band wrote &quot;Run&quot; (which had been around since 2000) on an acoustic guitar, and it later became the band&#x27;s breakthrough single. The band&#x27;s &quot;low point&quot; came when they played a concert to eighteen people at a strip club in High Wycombe. The show took place in a shoddy VIP area, and the management had to unscrew poles used by pole dancers to make space for the band to play, something that Gary would later joke about whilst performing at a sold-out Wembley Arena. Quinn says the show was &quot;horrendous&quot;. Desperate for attention, the band raised £200 to nominate themselves for a Mercury Prize but failed to get shortlisted.

===&quot;Final Straw&quot; (2002–2005)===
In 2002, Snow Patrol began to be managed and published by Jazz Summers of Big Life.

Guitarist Nathan Connolly, previously a member of the band File Under Easy Listening, was working in an HMV store room in Belfast, and the band were introduced to him by a mutual friend. Connolly moved to Glasgow to join Snow Patrol in the spring of 2002.

During Lightbody and McClelland&#x27;s years at the University of Dundee, they had been noticed by Richard Smernicki, a senior student, and his brother Paul. Richard Smernicki graduated in 1996, two years before Lightbody and McClelland, and become Polydor&#x27;s Scottish A&amp;R representative. Paul Smernicki became Polydor&#x27;s Press and Artist Development Manager and Fiction&#x27;s label manager. Jim Chancellor, an A&amp;R executive for Fiction, and fellow talent scout Alex Close, approached Snow Patrol in Glasgow, listened to their demos, and judged them on &quot;the quality of the songs&quot;, according to Lightbody. Chancellor introduced them to producer Jacknife Lee, who despite having been a guitarist in 1990s punk rock band Compulsion, had no rock production experience at that point, being known instead for his work with Basement Jaxx and Eminem.

&quot;Final Straw&quot; was released on 4 August 2003 under Black Lion, a subsidiary of Polydor Records. Its music was the same as on the band&#x27;s first two albums, and no attempt was made to change the sound to something more radio-friendly. &quot;Final Straw&quot; came out in the US in 2004 and sold more than 250,000 copies. It became the 26th most popular album in the UK that year and was eventually certified five-times platinum. In 2005, on a tour to support the album, the band were an opening act for U2 on the Vertigo Tour in Europe. Snow Patrol played a short set in London that summer at the worldwide benefit concert Live 8. After a two-year tour of &quot;Final Straw&quot;, the band took time off and began writing and recording songs for a new album. Snow Patrol&#x27;s version of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Isolation&quot; was released on 10 December 2005 as part of the Amnesty International campaign Make Some Noise. The song was issued on the 2007 John Lennon tribute album, &quot;Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur.&quot;

===&quot;Eyes Open&quot; and worldwide success (2005–2007)===
Bassist Mark McClelland left the band in March 2005. Lightbody said that &quot;new and unexpected pressures&quot; had &quot;taken their toll on working relationships within the band&quot;, and it was felt that &quot;the band could not move forward with Mark as a member&quot;. At the end of March 2005, former Terra Diablo member Paul Wilson was announced as replacement for McClelland. Snow Patrol also declared longtime touring keyboardist Tom Simpson an official member of the band.

Snow Patrol completed the recording of &quot;Eyes Open&quot; in December 2005, with Jacknife Lee returning as producer. The album was released on 28 April 2006 in Ireland and 1 May 2006 in the UK, with the first UK single, &quot;You&#x27;re All I Have&quot;, issued on 24 April 2006. The record was released in North America on 9 May. &quot;Hands Open&quot; was the first American single, but &quot;Chasing Cars&quot; reached the download and pop charts after it was heard during an emotional scene in the second-season finale of the American medical drama &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; on 15 May 2006. On 23 July 2006, &quot;Chasing Cars&quot; was the last song performed live on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. The song peaked at number 6 on the UK Singles Chart and number 5 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

On 26 November 2006, &quot;Eyes Open&quot; became the best-selling album of 2006 in the UK after selling 1.5 million copies. It was also the 15th best-selling album of the 2000s and one of the best-selling albums in UK chart history.

At the 2007 Grammy Awards, &quot;Chasing Cars&quot; was nominated for Best Rock Song. At the 2007 Brit Awards, it was nominated for Best British Single. On 1 September 2007, Snow Patrol headlined a &quot;homecoming&quot; mini-festival in Lightbody and Jonny Quinn&#x27;s home town of Bangor, County Down. Around 30,000 people came to see the band.

===&quot;A Hundred Million Suns&quot; (2008–2009)===
Recording for the follow-up album to &quot;Eyes Open&quot; began in late 2006, with Jacknife Lee returning a third time for production. 

The band launched their Taking Back the Cities Tour on 26 October 2008. Singer Miriam Kaufmann toured with the band and sang backing vocals, most notably on &quot;Set the Fire to the Third Bar&quot;, which had originally featured Martha Wainwright. The UK &amp; Ireland Arena Tour ended on 23 March 2009, and the final show was played at the Odyssey in Belfast to a 9,000-strong crowd that included family and friends and the Northern Irish football squad. It was reported that the band had played to an estimated 200,000 fans during the tour.

Snow Patrol visited South Africa to play dates at the Coca-Cola Zero Festival, supporting Oasis, before beginning a European leg of the tour. In June they supported Coldplay for a month on the Viva la Vida Tour.

In November 2009, the band released a compilation album featuring tracks from their fifteen-year history, titled &quot;Up to Now.&quot; The album contained thirty tracks on two CDs, three of which were new songs. &quot;Just Say Yes&quot;, a track written by Lightbody and earlier recorded by Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger and X Factor star Diana Vickers, was released as the lead single on 2 November. The record also contained covers and rarities, including songs from the band&#x27;s side project, The Reindeer Section. Snow Patrol spoke of making a tour documentary in the future, along the lines of U2&#x27;s &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot;.

In December 2009, the PPL announced that &quot;Chasing Cars&quot; was the most-played song of the decade in the UK. In a UK poll conducted by Channel 4, it was voted the nation&#x27;s favourite &quot;song of the noughties&quot;. In January 2010, the band were nominated in three categories in the annual Meteor Awards. They played at the awards event on 19 February 2010, at the RDS.

===&quot;Fallen Empires&quot; (2010–2012)===
In 2009, Snow Patrol took a new musical direction and said they would enter their &quot;next phase&quot; with the release of their sixth album. Connolly advised fans to keep an open mind regarding the new material. On 12 January 2011, Lightbody launched a blog to give details about the progress of the band&#x27;s next release.

Snow Patrol released the single &quot;Called Out in the Dark&quot; (remixed by Fatboy Slim) for radio airplay on 21 July 2011 on Zane Lowe&#x27;s show on BBC Radio 1. Official sources said the single would be issued independently, and later as part of an EP. The UK release date was to be 4 September. More details on the EP were announced on 3 August, when the group&#x27;s website revealed the artwork and track list contents. Along with the new single, the release contained three new tracks, titled &quot;My Brothers&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Ready&quot;, and &quot;Fallen Empires&quot;. It was stated that the EP was intended to be a digital release limited to the UK and Ireland.

After the premiere of the new lead single, the band&#x27;s official website confirmed that the name of the new album would be &quot;Fallen Empires&quot;. &quot;Fallen Empires&quot; was released on 14 November 2011 in the UK and was launched at O2 Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire. Singer-songwriter Johnny McDaid, who had worked on the album as a guest musician and songwriter, joined the band on the subsequent tour and eventually become a full member of Snow Patrol. The second single from &quot;Fallen Empires&quot; was &quot;This Isn&#x27;t Everything You Are&quot;, released on 13 November 2011.

===&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (2013–2018)===
The band released a compilation album entitled &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; on 14 May 2013.

In August 2013, Snow Patrol headlined the Tennent&#x27;s Vital festival and performed a warm-up show in London before the festival. After the show, they announced that keyboard player Tom Simpson would be leaving the band.

===&quot;Wildness&quot; and Quinn and Wilson&#x27;s departure (2018–2023)===
The follow-up album to &quot;Fallen Empires&quot; was due for release in 2016, but Lightbody told &quot;NME&quot; that he had had to overcome writer&#x27;s block, and that the songs written for the new album had been scrapped and replaced by new &quot;mind-boggling&quot; material. The band&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Wildness&quot;, was published on 25 May 2018.

In November 2018, the EP &quot;What If This Is All the Love You Ever Get?&quot; came out, featuring remixes of the track from &quot;Wildness&quot;. The band released their third compilation album, &quot;Reworked&quot;, on 8 November 2019, and followed it with a tour.

On 1 September 2023, Lightbody stated on the band&#x27;s Instagram account that Quinn and Wilson had decided to leave the band. He announced a new album for some time in 2024 and said that Snow Patrol would continue as a trio of himself, Connolly, and McDaid. Wilson&#x27;s decision to depart from Snow Patrol was said to have been due to his diminishing creative role and the feeling that his heart was no longer in the project.

===&quot;The Forest Is the Path&quot; (2024–present)===
On 29 May 2024, Snow Patrol unveiled &quot;The Beginning&quot;, the first single from their Fraser T. Smith-produced album, &quot;The Forest Is the Path&quot;, which was released on 13 September.

==Contributions==
In 2009, Snow Patrol curated the 22nd album in the &quot;Late Night Tales&quot; series of mix albums and covered the INXS song &quot;New Sensation&quot;. Lightbody spoke of plans to release songs from the Listen... Tanks! project with Snow Patrol producer Jacknife Lee and Tired Pony, a country group. In 2014, the band contributed a new song, &quot;I Won&#x27;t Let You Go&quot;, to the soundtrack of the film &quot;Divergent&quot;.

==Appearances==
On 30 July 2006, Snow Patrol appeared on the finale of the long-running weekly BBC music show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, performing &quot;Chasing Cars&quot;. The band were the last act to appear on the show.

On 7 July 2007, they performed at the UK leg of Live Earth at Wembley Stadium, London. After their performance, Simpson was arrested at RAF Northolt for missing a court date in Glasgow, having been charged with possession of cocaine.

==Other ventures==
Snow Patrol founded Polar Music, a publishing company run through Kobalt Music. The venture was independent from the band&#x27;s publishing deal with Universal Music. Polar Music was planned to sign artists regardless of their genre, as drummer Jonny Quinn explained: &quot;There is no agenda—if it&#x27;s good enough and we believe in it 110%, we will sign it.&quot; Quinn and his fellow band members Connolly and Lightbody acted as A&amp;R. The company&#x27;s first signing was Johnny McDaid, previously of the Northern Irish band Vega4. Quinn said that they wished to sign artists to a one-album deal and did not want to put pressure on the artists with bigger, multi-year contracts. Polar Music had its initial chart hit in the first week of October 2009.

Gary Lightbody and Tom Simpson are both fans of the football club Dundee F.C. In 2008, they met the club&#x27;s board of directors to find ways to help the struggling club financially. The band also owned a stake in the Houndstooth Pub in New York City.

===Philanthropy===
On 25 November 2007, Snow Patrol performed an acoustic session for the charity Mencap at Union Chapel, Islington. They were one of several bands to take part in the project, called &quot;Little Noise Sessions&quot;, which was curated by Jo Whiley.

In 2009, Lightbody and Connolly donated plectrums and certificates to raise funds for the Music Beats Mines project, which aims to clear unexploded mines/landmines from conflict zones. The items were auctioned on eBay.

==Recognition==
Other musicians, such as Ozzy Osbourne, Bono, Michael Stipe, and Nikki Sixx, have expressed admiration for Snow Patrol. Terri Hooley, founder of the Good Vibrations label and a lifelong supporter of local Northern Irish music, has expressed pride in bands like Snow Patrol.

==Awards and nominations==
&quot;Chasing Cars&quot; was voted Song of the Decade on Channel 4&#x27;s programme &quot;The Song of the Decade&quot;, which was broadcast on 28 December 2009. On 30 December 2009, Phonographic Performance Limited announced &quot;Chasing Cars&quot; was the most-played song of the decade in the UK. Ten years later in 2019, it was reportedly still the most played song of the 21st century in the UK.

In June 2010, the band were commemorated with a Heritage Award by PRS for Music. A plaque was erected on the Duke of York pub in Belfast, where Snow Patrol performed their first gig. The band were the sixth to receive the award, with all its members turning out. They later performed a live set to a small crowd of around thirty people.

<text>Bhai Randhir Singh Narangwal (7 July 1878 – 13 April 1961) was a Sikh leader who started the Gurdwara Sudhaar Movement and founded the Akhand Kirtani Jatha.

==Early life==

Randhir Singh was born as Basant Singh in Narangwal, Ludhiana district, Punjab on July 7, 1878 in a Grewal Jat Sikh family to father Natha Singh and mother Punjab Kaur. His father, Natha Singh, worked as a District Inspector of Schools and as a Judge in the High Court of the State of Nabha. His mother, Punjab Kaur, was a direct descendant in the seventh generation of Bhai Bhagtu, a distinguished Sikh of the congregation of Guru Arjan. He completed his schooling in Nabha and higher education from Government and Foreman Christian Colleges at Lahore. 

== Religious career ==
Singh wrote various books on Sikh theology, philosophy, and the Sikh way of life.

=== Gurdwara Rakabganj wall restoration ===
He was the leader of Sikhs who took part in a strong resistance movement, when in 1914 the British Government of India felled a portion of the Rakabganj Gurdwara wall under the beautification plan of the Government secretarial buildings in New Delhi area presently known as south block rakab gunj. Ultimately the government had to yield against the demand of the Sikhs and the wall was restored. 

The whole movement was linked with freedom fighters of the ghadar movement 1914-15 and the Lahore Conspiracy Case II.

But Bhai Randhir Singh was charged in 1914 with waging war against the British Crown and had to undergo life-imprisonment from 1914 to 1931.

== Death ==
He died on Vaisakhi, April 13, 1961 and his cremation took place at the lake between Gujjrawal and Narangwal.

<text>WSM-FM (95.5 MHz) is a radio station in Nashville, Tennessee. It broadcasts a country music format, with an emphasis on recordings released since the 1990s.

From 1967 until it was sold to Cumulus Media in 2003, WSM-FM was the sister of the clear-channel WSM (650 AM). Following the expiration of a subsequent five-year joint sales agreement with WSM in 2008, the two stations have had no further relationship. WSM-FM was also the sister to WSM-TV until the latter was sold in 1981 and became WSMV-TV. WSM-FM&#x27;s transmitter remains at the WSMV-TV site in West Nashville; its studios are located in Nashville&#x27;s Music Row district.

==History==
WSM-FM began broadcasting on November 1, 1962, as WLWM, owned by C. Webber Parrish (d/b/a Barlane Broadcasting Corporation), a local Nashville businessman.

In late 1967 ownership of the station was transferred to WSM, Inc., a subsidiary of The National Life and Accident Insurance Company, owners of WSM (AM), and the station&#x27;s call letters were officially changed to WSM-FM on November 6, 1968. This marked the return of the WSM-FM call sign after an absence of 17 years. In 1941, National Life had established the first fully licensed commercial FM station in the United States. Initially known as W47NV. This original WSM-FM was shut down in 1951 and its license returned to the FCC.

After a short period of simulcasting the AM station, beginning in 1969 WSM-FM returned to the easy listening format previously aired by WLWM.

===&quot;SM95&quot; (1976–1983)===
In 1976, National Life changed WSM-FM to a soft rock playlist, branding the station &quot;SM95&quot;.

===Country music format (1983–present)===

The ratings of SM95 began to decline—and thus its advertiser appeal—as its audience began aging in the early 1980s. By 1983, some four years after the conversion of the AM to a full-time country format, management decided to bring the FM in line with the AM, and flipped the format to country (with an emphasis on current hits, instead of the AM&#x27;s emphasis on oldies).

After the sale of WSM, Inc. to Gaylord Broadcasting, the new owner moved the studios of both AM and FM to an outlying building at the Opryland Hotel complex at that time, from their 1970s home on Knob Road in west Nashville, where former sister TV station WSMV-TV still operates today. In the 1990s, WSM-FM operated from a studio inside the now-defunct Opryland USA theme park, which visitors could view through a glass window. Following the theme park&#x27;s demolition, the station moved into a renovated guestroom at Gaylord Opryland Resort &amp; Convention Center. The station had an auxiliary studio at the Wildhorse Saloon downtown, and later at Opry Mills.

For most of the 1980s and 1990s, 95.5 FM was a highly competitive, yet usually No. 2 (behind rival WSIX-FM), country station. For much of the 1980s and 1990s, the station was branded as &quot;Nashville 95&quot;. However, upon the arrival of a fourth country station in the market in 1999 (WKDF, which had played rock music since the 1970s), WSM-FM fell to a distant third place, and sometimes fell to fourth behind then-sister WSM.

In 2001, WSM-FM attempted to differentiate itself from the other FM country outlets by shifting to a format consisting mostly of live performances provided by the artists&#x27; labels or those within the WSM archives (such as &quot;Opry&quot; performances and in-studio appearances). The station was known during this era as &quot;Live 95&quot;, and also simulcast the &quot;Opry&quot; live every Friday and Saturday night. After abandoning this approach to return to a traditional approach to programming, and until the end of the Gaylord era, the station was branded &quot;Back to Back Country 95.5 WSM-FM&quot;.

In 2003, WSM-FM (along with sister news/talk/sports station WWTN) was sold to Cumulus Media. The lineup at the time consisted of Katie and Carp in the mornings, Frank Series in middays, David Hughes in afternoons (best known for his &quot;Church day&quot; antics on Wednesdays) and Su-Anna in evenings. The station continued to broadcast from a first-floor hotel room in the Gaylord hotel until mid-2004 under the direction of program director Lee Logan. The studios and offices were eventually moved to Cumulus&#x27; existing property on Music Circle East, in Nashville&#x27;s Music Row district.

In September 2004, with new program director Jon Sebastian, the station adopted a revised country format (branded as &quot;95.5 The Wolf&quot;) that included some Southern rock music. After some initial ratings success, the station fell to a consistent third place behind WKDF and WSIX, and a more traditional country approach was once again employed. New program director Buddy Van Aresdale took the helm. The ratings steadily increased before Van Aresdale left for greener pastures. Another program director, Kevin King, took charge, this time with &quot;consultant&quot; Jan Jeffries, a long-time friend of the Dickey family.

On December 16, 2010, while rival station WSIX-FM was in the midst of a reboot and stunting with nonstop Christmas music, WSM-FM itself relaunched, dropping &quot;The Wolf&quot; moniker. The station returned to using its heritage call letters, while offering a mainstream country playlist that included the top country hits of the day, as well as a heavy reliance on familiar hits dating back to the early 1990s.

In 2012, due to the bankruptcy of Citadel Broadcasting and subsequent acquisition by Cumulus, WSM-FM and rival WKDF became sister stations, operating from the same building, yet still competing for the same mainstream country audience. Their operations were streamlined in January 2014 with the hiring of a common program director. WKDF adopted Cumulus&#x27; &quot;Nash FM&quot; moniker and format in February 2014, six months ahead of a similar change to come on WSM-FM.

On August 15, 2014, the station rebranded as &quot;95.5 Nash Icon&quot;, thus serving as the nominal flagship station of Cumulus&#x27; new Nash Icon brand, a spin-off of Nash FM that focuses on more familiar traditional country titles ranging back to the 1980s, as well as a focus on new music by more traditional-sounding artists. The format minimizes the amount of talking by the air personalities and places a heavier emphasis on the variety and amount of music. The Nash Icon radio format is a by-product of a joint venture between Cumulus and Big Machine Records to launch and operate the Nash Icon Records label.

In January 2015, WSM-FM became syndicated nationally on Westwood One&#x27;s offering of the Nash Icon format, which is distributed to several Cumulus Nash Icon-branded stations, as well as some non-Cumulus-owned subscribing stations. The personalities provide a generic non-live or local presence on the radio dial.

===&quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; schedule conflicts===
In past years, when WSM had the rights to broadcast Vanderbilt Commodore football and basketball games and Atlanta Braves baseball, it had WSM-FM air them whenever they took place on Friday or Saturday nights, in order not to preempt the live &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; shows on AM 650. Until the end of the 2003–08 Cumulus operating agreement, WSM-FM also aired NASCAR broadcasts under the same circumstances.

<text>Centropomus is a genus of predominantly marine fish comprising the family Centropomidae. The type species is &quot;Centropomus undecimalis&quot;, the common snook. Commonly known as snooks or róbalos, the &quot;Centropomus&quot; species are native to tropical and subtropical waters of the western Atlantic and eastern Pacific Oceans.

Prior to 2004, the subfamily Latinae, which contained three genera, was placed within the Centropomidae; this has since been raised to the family level and renamed Latidae because a cladistic analysis showed the old Centropomidae to be paraphyletic. This has left &quot;Centropomus&quot; as the only remaining genus in this family. These are popular game and food fish.

Dating from the upper Cretaceous, the centropomids are of typical percoid shape, distinguished by having two-part dorsal fins, a lateral line that extends onto the tail, and frequently, a concave shape to the head. They range from in length and are found in tropical and subtropical waters.
The snook species range in maximum length from about , with maximum recorded weights of 1.0 – 26 kg (2.2 – 57 lb).

Occurring in a variety of habitats ranging from coral reefs to estuaries and mangrove swamps, the snooks are carnivorous, feeding primarily on crustaceans and other fishes.

Many of the snooks are important as commercial food fish and as game fish.

The generic name &quot;Centropomus&quot; derives from the Greek κέντρον (centre, in this sense &quot;sting&quot;) and πώμα (cover, plug, operculum).

&quot;Róbalo&quot; or snook are world-renowned game fish of the family Centropomidae and genus &quot;Centropomus&quot; that are much sought after by fly-fishing enthusiasts and sportfishing charters. Six Atlantic and six Pacific Ocean species are currently recognized as scientifically valid. All are known to inhabit Central America and all are excellent gamefish. No evidence has been found of the individual species crossing from the Atlantic to the Pacific or vice versa through the Panama Canal. All snook species are capable of inhabiting both fresh and saltwater and are known to seasonally occupy Gatun Lake, which forms a water bridge connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as an integral part of the Panama Canal. Of the 12 species, only four are known to reach sizes in excess of 10 lb – two Atlantic species (&quot;C. undecimalis&quot; and &quot;C. poeyi&quot;) and two Pacific species (&quot;C. viridis&quot; and &quot;C. nigrescens&quot;). The eight species of smaller snooks usually grow to less than 6 lb and can be readily distinguished by from the four larger species by their noticeably longer anal spine, anal fin configuration, and body shape. The four large species are immediately recognizable by their more streamlined appearance given by their longer, narrower body shape. Many individual species bear a close resemblance to one another, although they may be from the same or different oceans; identification is better left up to experts. The two Atlantic large species (&quot;C. undecimalis&quot; and &quot;C. poeyi&quot;) are virtually identical in appearance. They can usually only be distinguished by the number of gill rakers each possesses. The &quot;robalo&quot; or common snook (&quot;C. undecimalis&quot;) commonly has 11 to 13 non-rudimentary gill rakers and the Mexican snook (&quot;C. poeyi&quot;) is most often found to possess 15 to 18 non-rudimentary gill rakers. The Pacific &quot;robalo nato&quot; or white snook (&quot;C. viridis&quot;) is also a dead ringer for the common snook. The distinguishing feature is also the non-rudimentary gill raker count with 13 to 15 for the white snook. They act, breed, grow, and fight virtually the same. Curiously, laboratory-reared specimens of the common snook showed meristic variations in vertebrae, fin ray, and gill raker numbers not observed in specimens from the wild. These variations are suspected to be due to diet and growth rates. Large &quot;robalo&quot; caught in Lake Gatun invariably cause a wealth of confusion. The IGFA requires verification of the species by a designated authority for world-record claims. The two Pacific species of large &quot;robalo&quot; are somewhat easier to distinguish.

The &quot;robalo redondo&quot; or black snook (&quot;C. nigrescens&quot;) can be differentiated by three visually apparent characteristics when compared to the &quot;C. viridis&quot;
# The body of &quot;C. nigrescens&quot;, while similarly elongated, is rounder and heavier in general appearance, being thicker through the middle than &quot;C. viridis&quot;.
# The head of &quot;C. nigrescens&quot; is bigger and the undershot jaw, characteristic of all &quot;róbalo&quot;, is far less pronounced than in &quot;C. viridis&quot;.
# Most importantly, the fourth dorsal spine of &quot;C. nigrescens&quot; is taller than the third. In both species, the first two dorsal spines are hardly noticeable. In large specimens, these first two spines are only a quarter of an inch long, while the third spine is over two inches in length. Therefore, if the first long dorsal spine is longer than all the others, it is a &quot;C. viridis&quot;, but if the first long dorsal spine is shorter than the second long dorsal spine it is a &quot;C. nigrescens&quot;.

<doc id="855760" wikidata="Q2556417" url="?curid=855760" title="Observer-expectancy effect">
<text>The observer-expectancy effect is a form of reactivity in which a researcher&#x27;s cognitive bias causes them to subconsciously influence the participants of an experiment. Confirmation bias can lead to the experimenter interpreting results incorrectly because of the tendency to look for information that conforms to their hypothesis, and overlook information that argues against it. It is a significant threat to a study&#x27;s internal validity, and is therefore typically controlled using a double-blind experimental design.

It may include conscious or unconscious influences on subject behavior including creation of demand characteristics that influence subjects, and altered or selective recording of experimental results themselves.

== Overview ==
The experimenter may introduce cognitive bias into a study in several in the observer-expectancy effect, the experimenter may subtly communicate their expectations for the outcome of the study to the participants, causing them to alter their behavior to conform to those expectations. Such observer bias effects are near-universal in human data interpretation under expectation and in the presence of imperfect cultural and methodological norms that promote or enforce objectivity.

The classic example of experimenter bias is that of &quot;Clever Hans&quot;, an Orlov Trotter horse claimed by his owner von Osten to be able to do arithmetic and other tasks. As a result of the large public interest in Clever Hans, philosopher and psychologist Carl Stumpf, along with his assistant Oskar Pfungst, investigated these claims. Ruling out simple fraud, Pfungst determined that the horse could answer correctly even when von Osten did not ask the questions. However, the horse was unable to answer correctly when either it could not see the questioner, or if the questioner themselves was unaware of the correct answer: When von Osten knew the answers to the questions, Hans answered correctly 89% of the time. However, when von Osten did not know the answers, Hans guessed only 6% of questions correctly. Pfungst then proceeded to examine the behaviour of the questioner in detail, and showed that as the horse&#x27;s taps approached the right answer, the questioner&#x27;s posture and facial expression changed in ways that were consistent with an increase in tension, which was released when the horse made the final, correct tap. This provided a cue that the horse had learned to use as a reinforced cue to stop tapping.

Experimenter-bias also influences human subjects. As an example, researchers compared performance of two groups given the same task (rating portrait pictures and estimating how successful each individual was on a scale of −10 to 10), but with different experimenter expectations. In one group, (&quot;Group A&quot;), experimenters were told to expect positive ratings while in another group, (&quot;Group B&quot;), experimenters were told to expect negative ratings. Data collected from Group A was a significant and substantially more optimistic appraisal than the data collected from Group B. The researchers suggested that experimenters gave subtle but clear cues with which the subjects complied.

==Prevention==

Double blind techniques may be employed to combat bias by causing the experimenter and subject to be ignorant of which condition data flows from.

It might be thought that, due to the central limit theorem of statistics, collecting more independent measurements will improve the precision of estimates, thus decreasing bias. However, this assumes that the measurements are statistically independent. In the case of experimenter bias, the measures share correlated bias: simply averaging such data will not lead to a better statistic but may merely reflect the correlations among the individual measurements and their non-independent nature.

<text>William Benedict Hamilton-Dalrymple (born 20 March 1965) is an India-based Scottish historian and art historian, as well as a curator, broadcaster and critic. He is also one of the co-founders and co-directors of the world&#x27;s largest writers&#x27; festival, the annual Jaipur Literature Festival. 

Dalrymple&#x27;s books have won numerous awards and prizes, including the Wolfson Prize for History, the Duff Cooper Memorial Prize, the Hemingway, the Kapuściński, the Arthur Ross Medal of the US Council on Foreign Relations, the Thomas Cook Travel Book Award and the Sunday Times Young British Writer of the Year Award. He has been five times longlisted and once shortlisted for the Baillie Gifford Prize for non-fiction and was a Finalist for the Cundill Prize for History. The BBC television documentary on his pilgrimage to the source of the river Ganges, &quot;Shiva&#x27;s Matted Locks&quot;, one of three episodes of his &quot;Indian Journeys&quot; series, which Dalrymple wrote and presented, won him the Grierson Award for Best Documentary Series at BAFTA in 2002.

In 2012, Dalrymple was appointed a Whitney J. Oates Visiting Fellow in the Humanities by Princeton University. In 2015, he was appointed the OP Jindal Distinguished Lecturer at Brown University. In 2018, he was awarded the President&#x27;s Medal of the British Academy, the academy&#x27;s highest honour in its suite of prizes and medals awarded for &quot;outstanding service to the cause of the humanities and social sciences.&quot; He is also since 2021 an Honorary Fellow of the Bodleian Library. He served as a Visiting Fellow at All Souls College, Oxford for an academic term in 2024.

He was named in the 2020 &quot;Prospect&quot; list of the top 50 thinkers for the COVID-19 era.

Dalrymple was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2023 Birthday Honours for services to literature and the arts.

==Personal life==
Dalrymple is a son of Sir Hew Hamilton-Dalrymple, 10th Baronet of North Berwick and Lady Anne-Louise Keppel, a daughter of Walter Keppel, 9th Earl of Albemarle; through this line of descent, he is the third cousin of Queen Camilla, both being great-great-grandchildren of William Keppel, 7th Earl of Albemarle. He is a great nephew of Virginia Woolf. His brother, Jock, was a first-class cricketer. He was educated at Ampleforth College and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was first a history exhibitioner and then a senior history scholar.

Dalrymple, the youngest of four brothers, grew up in North Berwick on the shores of the Firth of Forth. He describes his childhood as being idyllic and old-fashioned, almost Edwardian. Amongst his forebears is a Mughal princess who married a Dalrymple ancestor.

Dalrymple first went to Delhi on 26 January 1984, and has lived in India on and off since 1989 and spends most of the year at his Mehrauli farmhouse in the outskirts of Delhi, but summers in London and Edinburgh. His wife, Olivia, is an artist and comes from a family with long-standing connections to India. The couple have three children. His wife is related to Scottish actress Rose Leslie.

One of his sons, Sam Dalrymple, is a historian and a cofounder of a peace initiative called Project Dastaan.

The English journalist and author Alice Albinia is his cousin.

== Curation ==
Dalrymple was the curator of &quot;Princes and Painters in Mughal Delhi 1707–1857&quot;, a major show of the late Mughal painting for the &quot;Asia Society&quot; in New York, which ran from February to May 2012. A catalogue of this exhibit co-edited by Dalrymple with Yuthika Sharma was published by Yale University Press, then later in India by Penguin, in 2012 under the same name. More recently he curated the exhibition of Company style painting, &quot;Forgotten Masters: Indian Painting for the East India Company&quot;, at the Wallace Collection in London.

=== Authorship ===

Dalrymple&#x27;s interests include the history and art of India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, the Middle East, Hinduism, Buddhism, the Jains and early Eastern Christianity. Every one of his ten books has won literary prizes. His first three were travel books based on his journeys in the Middle East, India and Central Asia. His early influences included travel writers such as Robert Byron, Eric Newby, and Bruce Chatwin.

Dalrymple published a book of essays about current affairs in the Indian subcontinent, and four award-winning histories of the interaction between the East India Company and the peoples of India and Afghanistan between the eighteenth and mid-nineteenth century, his &quot;Company Quartet&quot;. His books have been translated into more than 40 languages.

He is a regular contributor to &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. He has also written many articles for &quot;Time&quot; magazine. He was the Indian Subcontinent correspondent of the &quot;New Statesman&quot; from 2004 to 2014.

He attended the inaugural Palestine Festival of Literature in 2008, giving readings and taking workshops in Jerusalem, Ramallah and Bethlehem.

His 2009 book, &quot;Nine Lives: In Search of the Sacred in Modern India&quot;, a study of some of the more esoteric forms of modern Indian, and especially Hindu spirituality, was published by Bloomsbury, and like all his others, went to the number one slot on the Indian non-fiction best-seller list. After its publication he toured the UK, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Australia, Holland and the US with a band consisting of some of the people featured in his book including Sufis, Fakirs, Bauls, Tevaram hymn singers as well as a prison warder and part-time Theyyam dancer widely believed to incarnate the god Vishnu.

&quot;Return of a King: The Battle for Afghanistan&quot;, a history of the First Afghan War 1839–42, was published in India in December 2012, in the UK in February 2013, and in the US in April 2013. Dalrymple&#x27;s great-great-granduncle Colin Mackenzie fought in the war and was briefly detained by the Afghans. Following the publication of the book Dalrymple was called to brief both the Afghan President Hamid Karzai and the White House on the lessons to be learned from Afghan history.

In 2019, he published &quot;The Anarchy&quot;, a history of the Indian subcontinent during the period from 1739 to 1803, which saw the collapse of the Mughal imperial system, rise of the Maratha imperial confederacy, and the militarisation and rise to power of the East India Company. It was long listed for the Baillie Gifford Prize 2019, and short listed for the Duke of Wellington medal for Military History, the Tata Book of the Year (Non-fiction) and the Historical Writers Association Book Award 2020. It was a Finalist for the Cundill Prize for History and won the 2020 Arthur Ross Bronze Medal from the US Council on Foreign Relations.

As of 2020, he was writing a book that is &quot;a sweeping look at India’s ideological colonisation of Asia, China and Europe during the short period between 250 BC to about 800 AD.&quot; This book was published in September 2024 and is titled &quot;The Golden Road: How Ancient India Transformed the World&quot;.

==TV, radio and podcasts==
Dalrymple has written and presented the six-part television series &quot;Stones of the Raj&quot; (Channel 4, August 1997), the three-part &quot;Indian Journeys&quot; (BBC, August 2002) and &quot;Sufi Soul&quot; (Channel 4, Nov 2005).

The six-part &quot;Stones of the Raj&quot; documents the stories behind some of British India&#x27;s colonial architecture starting with &quot;Lahore&quot; (16 August 1997), &quot;Calcutta&quot; (23 August 1997), &quot;The French Connection&quot; (30 August 1997), &quot;The Fatal Friendship&quot; (6 September 1997), &quot;Surrey in Tibet&quot; (13 September 1997), and concluded with &quot;The Magnificent Ruin&quot; (20 September 1997).

The trilogy of &quot;Indian Journeys&quot; consists of three one-hour episodes starting with &quot;Shiva’s Matted Locks&quot; which, while tracing the source of the Ganga, takes Dalrymple on a journey to the Himalayas; the second part, &quot;City of Djinns&quot;, is based on his travel book of the same name, and takes a look at Delhi&#x27;s history; lastly, &quot;Doubting Thomas&quot; takes Dalrymple to the Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, with which St Thomas, the Apostle of Jesus is closely associated.

He has done a six-part history series &quot;The Long Search&quot; for Radio 4. In this series Dalrymple searches to discover the spiritual roots of the British Isles. Dalrymple says &quot;In the course of my travels I often came across the assumption that intense spirituality was somehow the preserve of what many call &#x27;the mystic East&#x27;... it&#x27;s a misconception that has always irritated me as I&#x27;ve always regarded our own indigenous British traditions of spirituality as especially rich.&quot;

The BBC broadcast a documentary on 3 September 2015 entitled &quot;Love and Betrayal in India: The White Mughal&quot;, based on Dalrymple&#x27;s book &quot;White Mughals&quot;.

Dalrymple was the historical consultant to ITV&#x27;s 2019 series &quot;Beecham House&quot;.

In 2022, Dalrymple and journalist Anita Anand created the podcast &quot;Empire&quot;, the first series of which examines the British East India Company and British involvement and influence on India. The pair had previously collaborated on the book &quot;Koh-i-Noor: The History of the World&#x27;s Most Infamous Diamond&quot;. The Empire podcast went straight to No.1 in the UK Apple Podcast charts, had over five million downloads in its first six months and was twice nominated for UK Podcast of the Year in the Broadcasting Press Guild Audio Awards.

<text>The elongate glassy perchlet (&quot;Chanda nama&quot;) is a species of freshwater fish in the Asiatic glassfish family Ambassidae, the only species in the genus Chanda. It is native to an area of south Asia from Pakistan to Burma, in the Indomalayan realm.

The elongate glassy perchlet reaches a maximum total length of .
The species inhabits canals, ponds, streams, and flooded rice paddies, in both fresh and brackish water, and is found in particular abundance during the rainy season. The species feeds on mosquito larvae and worms and also eats the scales of other fishes (lepidophagy), the species may have potential use in controlling malaria and parasites.

The fish are harvested and sold for food in local markets.

Several other species of family Ambassidae were formerly classified in genus &quot;Chanda,&quot; including the well-known Indian glassy fish, &quot;Parambassis ranga&quot;, the &quot;glassfish&quot; of the aquarium trade; and the high-finned glass perchlet, &quot;Parambassis lala&quot;, once considered the type species of the genus.

The elongate glassy perchlet is known by a variety of names locally, including &quot;perchlet&quot; and several variations on its generic name (&quot;chanda&quot;, &quot;channa&quot;, etc.); internationally it is also known as the elongated glassfish.

<text>Robert B. Rowling (born 1953) is an American billionaire businessman, and the Founder of TRT Holdings, the holding company of Omni Hotels.

==Early life==
A native of Corpus Christi, Texas, Rowling has an undergraduate degree from the University of Texas at Austin and a doctorate in jurisprudence from Southern Methodist University.

==Career==
In 1972, Rowling began working for Tana Oil and Gas, which was owned by his father, Reese Rowling, and William E Colson. In 1989 Texaco acquired Tana for $476 million, thereby providing money that was used to form TRT Holdings. Five years later, TRT Holdings sold Corpus Christi National Bank to NationsBank for $131 million. TRT Holdings would later purchase Omni Hotels for $500 million and Gold&#x27;s Gym for $180 million. In August 2010, Rowling made the winning bid to acquire the bankrupt Amelia Island Plantation Resort for $67.1 million. In July 2013, Rowling purchased six resorts from KSL Resorts including The Homestead 1766 in Hot Springs, Virginia.

Rowling served as a regent to the University of Texas System until February 2009 when he resigned over a controversy regarding bonuses paid to the UTIMCO investment staff. Governor Rick Perry and Texas state senators had sought to go back on compensation agreements with the staff. Unwilling to break the contracts and disgusted by their grandstanding, Rowling quit during a Texas Senate Finance Committee meeting and followed it up a day later with a formal letter of resignation 

As of July 2024, he is worth US$9.5 billion. He is the 82nd richest person in the United States.

==Political activities==
He is a conservative Republican and a major donor to the party. He is also one of four billionaire backers of the conservative political action group American Crossroads. According to an article published in &quot;Forbes&quot;, four San Francisco Gold&#x27;s Gym franchises split off from the brand after Rowling made a $2 million donation to Karl Rove&#x27;s American Crossroads PAC, sparking protest from gay rights advocates. TRT Holdings has also given an additional $2.5 million from the company treasury this election cycle, according to public filings. He commented to Fox News, explaining that his donation to American Crossroads had nothing to do with social policies that could spark crossfire. &quot;I&#x27;ve never heard one discussion of a social issue. This is all about fiscal sanity.&quot;

In April 2020, Governor Greg Abbott named Rowling to the Strike Force to Open Texas – a group &quot;tasked with finding safe and effective ways to slowly reopen the state&quot; amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Personal life==
He is married to Terry Hennersdorf Rowling, they have two children, and live in Dallas, Texas. They met when they were both studying for their bachelor&#x27;s degrees in business at the University of Texas at Austin.

<doc id="855774" wikidata="Q787185" url="?curid=855774" title="Lates">
<text>Lates is a genus of freshwater and euryhaline lates perches belonging to the family Latidae. The generic name is also used as a common name, lates, for many of the species.

All species are predatory, and the Nile perch (&quot;L. niloticus&quot;), in particular, has become infamous as an invasive species introduced into the East African Lake Victoria, where many native Haplochromines were driven extinct. In contrast to the widespread Barramundi and Nile perch (though the fish does face threats from human activity), several members of the genus &quot;Lates&quot; with relatively restricted African or Asian distributions are themselves considered threatened.

==Etymology==
The generic name &quot;Lates&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;latēre&quot; (to be hidden).

==Description==
These fishes range in size from less than in maximum overall length, the largest species reaching weights up to . They all have the characteristic centropomid shape, with the two-part dorsal fin and general percoid form.

All species are carnivorous, preying on aquatic invertebrates and other fish in a wide variety of habitats.

==Distribution and habitat==

These fishes are native to freshwater and marine waters of Africa, Asia, the Indian Ocean, and the western Pacific Ocean. Several species are endemic to the Rift Valley lakes in Africa.

==Taxonomy==

=== Extant species ===
Currently, 11 recognized species are placed in this genus:
* &quot;Lates angustifrons&quot; (Tanganyika lates)
* &quot;Lates calcarifer&quot; (barramundi)
* &quot;Lates japonicus&quot; (Japanese lates) (Japanese barramundi)
* &quot;Lates lakdiva&quot; 
* &quot;Lates longispinis&quot; (Rudolf lates)
* &quot;Lates macrophthalmus&quot; (Albert lates)
* &quot;Lates mariae&quot; (bigeye lates)
* &quot;Lates microlepis&quot; (forktail lates)
* &quot;Lates niloticus&quot; (Nile perch)
* &quot;Lates stappersii&quot; (sleek lates)
* &quot;Lates uwisara&quot; 

=== Extinct species ===
Extinct species within this genus include:
* &quot;Lates arambourgi&quot; - Pliocene/Pleistocene of Ethiopia
* &quot;Lates bispinosus&quot; - Neogene of Turkey
* ?&quot;Lates croaticus&quot; - Miocene of Croatia
* ?&quot;Lates gregarius&quot; - late Miocene of Moldova
* ?&quot;Lates macropterus&quot; - Oligocene of Italy
* ?&quot;Lates karungae&quot; - Miocene of Kenya
* &quot;Lates odessanus&quot; - latest Miocene of Ukraine
* &quot;Lates partschi&quot; - mid-Miocene of Austria
* &quot;Lates qatraniensis&quot; - Early Oligocene of Egypt
Extinct species within this genus lived from the early Oligocene epoch to the present. Fossils have been found in Africa (Libya, Egypt, Kenya, Tunisia, Chad, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Niger, and Sudan), Saudi Arabia, and Slovakia. Earlier specimens from the Eocene are now placed in their own genus, &quot;Eolates&quot;.

Prehistoric &quot;Lates&quot; appear to have had significant species diversity in the marine basins of the Mediterranean and Paratethys, but appear to have been significantly affected by salinity fluctuations, leading to their eventual extinction. In the present day, the only surviving &quot;Lates&quot; in this region are &quot;L. niloticus&quot; in estuarine habitats in North Africa.

<doc id="855776" wikidata="Q239224" url="?curid=855776" title="Einstein–Hilbert action">
<text>The Einstein–Hilbert action in general relativity is the action that yields the Einstein field equations through the stationary-action principle. With the metric signature, the gravitational part of the action is given as

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the determinant of the metric tensor matrix, formula_3 is the Ricci scalar, and formula_4 is the Einstein gravitational constant (formula_5 is the gravitational constant and formula_6 is the speed of light in vacuum). If it converges, the integral is taken over the whole spacetime. If it does not converge, formula_7 is no longer well-defined, but a modified definition where one integrates over arbitrarily large, relatively compact domains, still yields the Einstein equation as the Euler–Lagrange equation of the Einstein–Hilbert action. The action was proposed by David Hilbert in 1915 as part of his application of the variational principle to a combination of gravity and electromagnetism.

== Discussion ==
Deriving equations of motion from an action has several advantages. First, it allows for easy unification of general relativity with other classical field theories (such as Maxwell theory), which are also formulated in terms of an action. In the process, the derivation identifies a natural candidate for the source term coupling the metric to matter fields. Moreover, symmetries of the action allow for easy identification of conserved quantities through Noether&#x27;s theorem.

In general relativity, the action is usually assumed to be a functional of the metric (and matter fields), and the connection is given by the Levi-Civita connection. The Palatini formulation of general relativity assumes the metric and connection to be independent, and varies with respect to both independently, which makes it possible to include fermionic matter fields with non-integer spin.

The Einstein equations in the presence of matter are given by adding the matter action to the Einstein–Hilbert action.

==Derivation of Einstein field equations==
Suppose that the full action of the theory is given by the Einstein–Hilbert term plus a term formula_8 describing any matter fields appearing in the theory.

The stationary-action principle then tells us that to recover a physical law, we must demand that the variation of this action with respect to the inverse metric be zero, yielding

:formula_9.

Since this equation should hold for any variation formula_10, it implies that

 + \frac{R}{\sqrt{-g}} \frac{\delta \sqrt{-g}}{\delta g^{\mu\nu}} = -2\kappa \frac{1}{\sqrt{-g}} \frac{\delta (\sqrt{-g} \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{M})}{\delta g^{\mu\nu}}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

is the equation of motion for the metric field. The right hand side of this equation is (by definition) proportional to the stress–energy tensor,

:formula_11.

To calculate the left hand side of the equation we need the variations of the Ricci scalar formula_3 and the determinant of the metric. These can be obtained by standard textbook calculations such as the one given below, which is strongly based on the one given in Carroll (2004).

===Variation of the Ricci scalar===
The variation of the Ricci scalar follows from varying the Riemann curvature tensor, and then the Ricci curvature tensor.

The first step is captured by the Palatini identity

:formula_13.

Using the product rule, the variation of the Ricci scalar formula_14 then becomes

:formula_15

where we also used the metric compatibility formula_16, and renamed the summation indices formula_17 in the last term.

When multiplied by formula_18, the term formula_19 becomes a total derivative, since for any vector formula_20 and any tensor density formula_21, we have 
:formula_22 or formula_23.

By Stokes&#x27; theorem, this only yields a boundary term when integrated. The boundary term is in general non-zero, because the integrand depends not only on formula_24 but also on its partial derivatives formula_25; see the article Gibbons–Hawking–York boundary term for details. However, when the variation of the metric formula_10 vanishes in a neighbourhood of the boundary or when there is no boundary, this term does not contribute to the variation of the action. Thus, we can forget about this term and simply obtain

 = R_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;.|}}

at events not in the closure of the boundary.

===Variation of the determinant===
Jacobi&#x27;s formula, the rule for differentiating a determinant, gives:

:formula_27,

or one could transform to a coordinate system where formula_28 is diagonal and then apply the product rule to differentiate the product of factors on the main diagonal. Using this we get

:formula_29

In the last equality we used the fact that

:formula_30

which follows from the rule for differentiating the inverse of a matrix

:formula_31.

Thus we conclude that

 \frac{\delta \sqrt{-g}}{\delta g^{\mu\nu} } = -\frac{1}{2} g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;.|}}

===Equation of motion===
Now that we have all the necessary variations at our disposal, we can insert () and () into the equation of motion () for the metric field to obtain

which is the Einstein field equations, and

:formula_32

has been chosen such that the non-relativistic limit yields the usual form of Newton&#x27;s gravity law, where formula_5 is the gravitational constant (see here for details).

== Cosmological constant ==
When a cosmological constant Λ is included in the Lagrangian, the action:

:formula_34

Taking variations with respect to the inverse metric:

:formula_35

Using the action principle: 
:formula_36

Combining this expression with the results obtained before:

:formula_37

We can obtain:

:formula_38

With formula_39, the expression becomes the field equations with a cosmological constant:

:formula_40

<doc id="855780" wikidata="Q7380013" url="?curid=855780" title="Running crew">
<text>In theatre, the running crew (also run crew) are members of the technical crew who supervise and operate (&quot;run&quot;) the various technical aspects of the production during a performance. While the &quot;technical crew&quot; includes all persons other than performers involved with the production, such as those who build and take down the sets and place the lighting, the term &quot;running crew&quot; is generally limited to those who work during an actual performance.

The term is typically not applied to crew or department heads, although there are exceptions. The running crew may include performers if they also function in technical capacities while offstage.

==Crew positions==
A typical running crew will include any or all of the following positions, depending on the nature and size of the production, and the complexity of the technical requirements. Each position is organized by the most common title; depending on the country, type of production, and producing organization, different titles may be used for the same position. (This also depends on what the director classifies it all as.)

===Stage management===
* Assistant stage manager: Assists the stage manager in their duties. Generally, one assistant stage manager is in charge of running backstage operations during a show.
* Props Master: Responsible for maintenance and placement of hand props before scenes as well as their subsequent retrieval after the scene. Additionally, props masters run the properties department and work to ensure that all props exist within the theater and are easily locatable, should they not already be where they need to be (i.e. maintaining a prop table).
* Assistant Props Master: Assists the prop master in their duties usually taking one side of the stage during a performance.
* Call boy: responsible for alerting actors and actresses of their entrances in time for them to appear on stage, on cue.

===Lighting===
* Light board operator: operates the lighting control system by activating lighting cues at the direction of the stage manager. Sometimes this is integrated with the show control system.
* Deck Electrician: responsible for placing, connecting, and/or operating stage lighting units, such as stage lights. Sometimes, they are necessary to have during scene changes, in the case of moving set pieces with lighting equipment inside. Typically, more than one will be backstage.
* Master Electrician: responsible for the maintenance and operation of dimming &amp; power distribution systems during a performance, including &quot;hot&quot; or &quot;live&quot; patching. Occasionally, some of these duties could also be delegated to the run crew&#x27;s deck electricians.
* Spotlight Operator (or follow spot operator/dome operator): operates a type of lighting instrument called a follow spot, which allows a performer to be lit evenly no matter where on stage they may go. It can typically be found in the lighting booth, along with the light board op. Also, some theaters have followed spots located above a false ceiling, on the catwalk.

===Sound===
* Sound operator (A1): operates the sound board and/or audio control system specified by the sound designer, computerized or otherwise. Sometimes this is integrated with the show control system. There can be multiple soundboard ops. Alternative names/technical labels for the position include: A1.
* Mic wrangler (A2): manages microphones and maintains headsets as a show runs. Usually, there are several mic wranglers located backstage, in the wings, with the running crew. Alternative names/technical labels for the position include: A2, A3, Audio Technician.

===Stage===
* Flymen (or fly crew/rail crew): operate the fly system, a system of ropes or wires, pulleys, and counterweights by means of which scenery is &quot;flown&quot; in and out (down and up, respectively) during scene changes.
* Stagehand: A technician responsible for moving scenery at the stage level, by manually carrying or rolling set pieces (e.g., scenery wagons) between the stage and the wings. This can include carrying on and off furniture, props, or scenery.

===Costumes===
* Wardrobe: In charge of facilitating the use of costumes during shows. Often referred to as running wardrobe, wardrobe manager, and wardrobe assistants. They have assistants, dressers, who help with fittings and quick changes (when an actor needs to change costume very quickly, often backstage).
* Makeup: responsible for applying or assisting in the application of face and body paints, wigs and hairpieces, etc.
* Dresser: A member of the running crew present in the wings of the stage. Their main responsibilities including, helping the actors get dressed during pre-show, choreographing quick changes, executing quick changes from hidden spaces on-stage, and making emergency repairs throughout the duration of the show.

<text>Vivian &quot;Viv&quot; Nicholson (&quot;née&quot; Asprey; 3 April 1936 – 11 April 2015) was a British woman who became famous when she told the media that she would &quot;spend, spend, spend&quot; after her husband Keith won £152,319 () on the football pools in 1961. Nicholson became the subject of tabloid news stories for many years because of the couple&#x27;s subsequent rapid spending of their fortune and her later chaotic life.

==Early life==
Nicholson was born Vivian Asprey on 3 April 1936 in Castleford near Wakefield. Her father was a coal miner, but suffered from epilepsy, and was often unable to work. Her mother was asthmatic. As the oldest child, Asprey was expected to mind her younger brothers and sisters and scavenge for coal. Growing up in extreme poverty, she was not allowed to take up a scholarship that she had won to an art school. Having left school at age 14, she took work at the local liquorice factory making Pontefract cakes.

She became pregnant at age 16 and married Matthew Johnson, but left him to marry her neighbour, Keith Nicholson, two years later. By 1961, she had four children.

==Wealth==
Keith Nicholson won the football pools on 23 September 1961. His and his wife&#x27;s lavish spending sprees (including purchases of expensive sportscars, fur coats, clothing, home appliances, jewellery and holiday trips) over the next few years quickly depleted their fortune. By her own admission, Viv faced difficulty in coping with the psychological effects of the money that Keith had won. Having no concept of how to manage and save money, she admitted that her spending was akin to a narcotics addiction. She came to feel distanced from the people among whom she had lived, who in turn could no longer relate to her, and she developed an ever greater longing for a much more affluent lifestyle.

After Keith died after crashing his Jaguar on 30 October 1965, Viv&#x27;s fortune rapidly dwindled to nothing; banks and tax creditors deemed her bankrupt and declared that all the money, and everything that she had acquired with it, belonged not to her but to Keith&#x27;s estate.

In 1968, Nicholson won a three-year legal battle to gain £34,000 from her husband&#x27;s estate, but rapidly lost it all by more uncontrolled spending, as well as by taxes, legal fees, unpaid bills and bad investments.

==Difficulties==
In 1970, Nicholson moved to Malta, but the following year, after she was arrested for assaulting a policeman, the Maltese authorities deported her, and she returned to Britain. She remarried, but her new husband Brian Wright was later also killed in a car crash. She entered a mental home to escape from her next husband Graham Ellison, who abused her during the four days in which they lived together; the marriage lasted 13 weeks. Her fifth and final husband, Gary Shaw, died of a drug overdose.

Nicholson&#x27;s alcoholism became serious during her wealthy years but continued for many years after she had lost all of her money. She eventually achieved sobriety.

She made many unsuccessful attempts to regain both her public profile and her lost wealth, such as recording a song (titled &quot;Spend Spend Spend&quot;, written by her brother) and appearing in a strip club singing &quot;Big Spender.&quot; After opening a short-lived boutique, she ended up penniless, and by 1976 claimed that she could not even afford to bury her fourth husband (they had broken up three years earlier) when he died.

In 1978, Nicholson co-wrote an autobiography with Stephen Smith titled &quot;Spend, Spend, Spend&quot; that was dramatised for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Play for Today&quot; series by Jack Rosenthal. &quot;Spend, Spend, Spend&quot; (1977) was directed by John Goldschmidt (who won a BAFTA award for the filmed play) and stars Susan Littler and John Duttine.

Nicholson died at Pinderfields Hospital, Wakefield at age 79 on 11 April 2015 after having a stroke and suffering from dementia.

==In culture==
A photograph of Nicholson was used on the sleeve of the Smiths&#x27; single &quot;Heaven Knows I&#x27;m Miserable Now.&quot; Morrissey had previously borrowed a line from Nicholson&#x27;s autobiography for the song &quot;Still Ill&quot; (&quot;Under the iron bridge we kissed, and although I ended up with sore lips...&quot;). Another picture of Nicholson taken at Wheldale Colliery, Castleford, West Yorkshire was used on the German release of &quot;Barbarism Begins at Home&quot; and on the programme for the Meat Is Murder tour. A photo of Nicholson painting at an easel was used for the cover of a 1988 re-release of &quot;The Headmaster Ritual.&quot; However, as she had become a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness in 1979, Nicholson objected to the use of her image for the single&#x27;s cover because of an expletive in the song&#x27;s lyrics (&quot;Spineless bastards all...&quot;).

In her autobiography, guitarist Viv Albertine of The Slits says that their song &quot;Spend, Spend, Spend&quot; by was inspired by Viv Nicholson.

A successful musical based on Nicholson&#x27;s life called &quot;Spend Spend Spend&quot; debuted in 1998 and subsequently ran in the West End.

<text>The Waigieu seaperch (Psammoperca waigiensis), or Waigeo barramundi, is a species of marine fish in family Latidae of order Carangiformes. The only species of genus Psammoperca, it is native to tropical coastal waters from the Bay of Bengal in the South through Indonesia to northern Australia and north through the Philippines and the South China Sea to Japan.

Reaching a maximum overall length of 47 cm (19 in), &quot;P. waigiensis&quot; is of brownish to steel-grey colouration, sometimes with white vertical bars along the body. With its typical centropomid body shape, it can be distinguished from the barramundi (&quot;Lates calcarifer&quot;) from the same waters by its widely set nostrils and shorter maxilla which does not reach back further than the eye (which is reddish).

The Waigeo &quot;sea perch&quot; occurs primarily among rocks and in coral reefs, preferring vegetated waters. It is a nocturnal predator, feeding primarily on crustaceans and other fishes and hiding during the day.

The species is named for Waigeo, an island in Indonesia; the common name is also spelled Waigeo or Weigeu seaperch. It is also known as the sand bass, sand perch, or glasseye perch. The generic name &quot;Psammoperca&quot; derives from the Greek &quot;ψάμμος&quot; (sand) and &quot;πέρκη&quot; (perch).

<text>Color field painting is a style of abstract painting that emerged in New York City during the 1940s and 1950s. It was inspired by European modernism and closely related to abstract expressionism, while many of its notable early proponents were among the pioneering abstract expressionists. Color field is characterized primarily by large fields of flat, solid color spread across or stained into the canvas creating areas of unbroken surface and a flat picture plane. The movement places less emphasis on gesture, brushstrokes and action in favor of an overall consistency of form and process. In color field painting &quot;color is freed from objective context and becomes the subject in itself.&quot;

During the late 1950s and 1960s, color field painters emerged in parts of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the United States, particularly New York, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere, using formats of stripes, targets, simple geometric patterns and references to landscape imagery and to nature.

== Historical roots ==

The focus of attention in the world of contemporary art began to shift from Paris to New York after World War II and the development of American abstract expressionism. During the late 1940s and early 1950s Clement Greenberg was the first art critic to suggest and identify a dichotomy between differing tendencies within the abstract expressionist canon. Taking issue with Harold Rosenberg (another important champion of abstract expressionism), who wrote of the virtues of action painting in his article &quot;American Action Painters&quot; published in the December 1952 issue of &quot;ARTnews&quot;, Greenberg observed another tendency toward all-over color or color field in the works of several of the so-called &quot;first generation&quot; abstract expressionists.

Mark Rothko was one of the painters that Greenberg referred to as a color field painter exemplified by &quot;Magenta, Black, Green on Orange&quot;, although Rothko himself refused to adhere to any label. For Rothko, color was &quot;merely an instrument&quot;. In a sense, his best known works – the &quot;multiforms&quot; and his other signature paintings – are, in essence, the same expression, albeit one of purer (or less concrete or definable, depending on the interpretation) means, which is that of the same &quot;basic human emotions&quot;, as his earlier surrealistic mythological paintings. What is common among these stylistic innovations is a concern for &quot;tragedy, ecstasy and doom&quot;. By 1958, whatever spiritual expression Rothko meant to portray on canvas, it was growing increasingly darker. His bright reds, yellows and oranges of the early 1950s subtly transformed into dark blues, greens, grays and blacks. His final series of paintings from the mid-1960s were gray, and black with white borders, seemingly abstract landscapes of an endless bleak, tundra-like, unknown country.

Rothko, during the mid-1940s, was in the middle of a crucial period of transition, and he had been impressed by Clyfford Still&#x27;s abstract fields of color, which were influenced in part by the landscapes of Still&#x27;s native North Dakota. In 1947, during a subsequent semester teaching at the California School of Fine Art (known today as the San Francisco Art Institute), Rothko and Still flirted with the idea of founding their own curriculum or school. Still was considered one of the foremost color field painters – his non-figurative paintings are largely concerned with the juxtaposition of different colors and surfaces. His jagged flashes of color give the impression that one layer of color has been &quot;torn&quot; off the painting, revealing the colors underneath, reminiscent of stalactites and primordial caverns. Still&#x27;s arrangements are irregular, jagged, and pitted with heavy texture and sharp surface contrast as seen above in &quot;1957D1&quot;.

Another artist whose best known works relate to both abstract expressionism and to color field painting is Robert Motherwell. Motherwell&#x27;s style of abstract expressionism, characterized by loose opened fields of painterly surfaces accompanied by loosely drawn and measured lines and shapes, was influenced by both Joan Miró and by Henri Matisse. Motherwell&#x27;s &quot;Elegy to the Spanish Republic No. 110&quot; (1971) is a pioneering work of both abstract expressionism and color field painting. While the &quot;Elegy&quot; series embodies both tendencies, his &quot;Open Series&quot; of the late 1960s, 1970s and 1980s places him firmly within the color field camp. In 1970 Motherwell said, &quot;Throughout my life, the 20th-century painter whom I&#x27;ve admired the most has been Matisse&quot;, alluding to several of his own series of paintings that reflect Matisse&#x27;s influence, most notably his &quot;Open Series&quot; that come closest to classic color field painting.

Barnett Newman is considered one of the major figures in abstract expressionism and one of the foremost of the color field painters. Newman&#x27;s mature work is characterized by areas of color pure and flat separated by thin vertical lines, or &quot;zips&quot; as Newman called them, exemplified by &quot;Vir Heroicus Sublimis&quot; in the collection of MoMA. Newman himself thought that he reached his fully mature style with the &quot;Onement&quot; series (from 1948) seen here. The zips define the spatial structure of the painting while simultaneously dividing and uniting the composition. Although Newman&#x27;s paintings appear to be purely abstract, and many of them were originally untitled, the names he later gave them hinted at specific subjects being addressed, often with a Jewish theme. Two paintings from the early 1950s, for example, are called &quot;Adam&quot; and &quot;Eve&quot; (see Adam and Eve), and there are also &quot;Uriel&quot; (1954) and &quot;Abraham&quot; (1949), a very dark painting, which, in addition to being the name of a biblical patriarch, was also the name of Newman&#x27;s father, who had died in 1947. Newman&#x27;s late works, such as the &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue&quot; series, use vibrant, pure colors, often on very large canvases.

Jackson Pollock, Adolph Gottlieb, Hans Hofmann, Barnett Newman, Clyfford Still, Mark Rothko, Robert Motherwell, Ad Reinhardt and Arshile Gorky (in his last works) were among the prominent abstract expressionist painters that Greenberg identified as being connected to color field painting in the 1950s and 1960s.

Although Pollock is closely associated with action painting because of his style, technique, and his painterly &#x27;touch&#x27; and his physical application of paint, art critics have likened Pollock to both action painting and color field painting. Another critical view advanced by Clement Greenberg connects Pollock&#x27;s allover canvases to the large-scale &quot;Water Lilies&quot; of Claude Monet done during the 1920s. Greenberg, art critic Michael Fried, and others have observed that the overall feeling in Pollock&#x27;s most famous works – his &quot;drip&quot; paintings – read as vast fields of built-up linear elements often reading as vast complexes of similar valued paint skeins that read as all over fields of color and drawing, and are related to the mural-sized late Monets that are constructed of many passages of close valued brushed and scumbled marks that also read as close valued fields of color and drawing that Monet used in building his picture surfaces. Pollock&#x27;s use of all-over composition lend a philosophical and a physical connection to the way the color field painters like Newman, Rothko and Still construct their unbroken and in Still&#x27;s case broken surfaces. In several paintings that Pollock painted after his classic &quot;drip&quot; painting period of 1947–1950, he used the technique of staining fluid oil paint and house paint into raw canvas. During 1951 he produced a series of semi-figurative black stain paintings, and in 1952 he produced stain paintings using color. In his November 1952 exhibition at the Sidney Janis Gallery in New York City Pollock showed &quot;Number 12, 1952&quot;, a large, masterful stain painting that resembles a brightly colored stained landscape (with an overlay of broadly dripped dark paint); the painting was acquired from the exhibition by Nelson Rockefeller for his personal collection. In 1960 the painting was severely damaged by fire in the Governors Mansion in Albany that also severely damaged an Arshile Gorky painting and several other works in the Rockefeller collection. However, by 1999 it had been restored and was installed in Empire State Plaza.

While Arshile Gorky is considered to be one of the founding fathers of abstract expressionism and a surrealist, he was also one of the first painters of the New York School who used the technique of &quot;staining&quot;. Gorky created broad fields of vivid, open, unbroken color that he used in his many of his paintings as &quot;grounds&quot;. In Gorky&#x27;s most effective and accomplished paintings between the years 1941 and 1948, he consistently used intense stained fields of color, often letting the paint run and drip, under and around his familiar lexicon of organic and biomorphic shapes and delicate lines. Another abstract expressionist whose works in the 1940s call to mind the stain paintings of the 1960s and the 1970s is James Brooks. Brooks frequently used stain as a technique in his paintings from the late 1940s. Brooks began diluting his oil paint in order to have fluid colors with which to pour and drip and stain into the mostly raw canvas that he used. These works often combined calligraphy and abstract shapes. During the final three decades of his career, Sam Francis&#x27; style of large-scale bright abstract expressionism was closely associated with color field painting. His paintings straddled both camps within the abstract expressionist rubric, action painting and color field painting.

Having seen Pollock&#x27;s 1951 paintings of thinned black oil paint stained into raw canvas, Helen Frankenthaler began to produce &quot;stain paintings&quot; in varied oil colors on raw canvas in 1952. Her most famous painting from that period is &quot;Mountains and Sea&quot; (as seen below). She is one of the originators of the color field movement that emerged in the late 1950s. Frankenthaler also studied with Hans Hofmann. Hofmann&#x27;s paintings are a symphony of color as seen in &quot;The Gate&quot;, 1959–1960. Hofmann was renowned not only as an artist but also as a teacher of art, both in his native Germany and later in the U.S. Hofmann, who came to the United States from Germany in the early 1930s, brought with him the legacy of Modernism. Hofmann was a young artist working in Paris who painted there before World War I. Hofmann worked in Paris with Robert Delaunay, and he knew firsthand the innovative work of both Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse. Matisse&#x27;s work had an enormous influence on him, and on his understanding of the expressive language of color and the potentiality of abstraction. Hofmann was one of the first theorists of color field painting, and his theories were influential to artists and to critics, particularly to Clement Greenberg, as well as to others during the 1930s and 1940s. In 1953 Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland were both profoundly influenced by Frankenthaler&#x27;s stain paintings after visiting her studio in New York City. Returning to Washington, DC., they began to produce the major works that created the color field movement in the late 1950s.

In 1972 then Metropolitan Museum of Art curator Henry Geldzahler said:
Clement Greenberg included the work of both Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland in a show that he did at the Kootz Gallery in the early 1950s. Clem was the first to see their potential. He invited them up to New York in 1953, I think it was, to Helen&#x27;s studio to see a painting that she had just done called Mountains and Sea, a very, very beautiful painting, which was in a sense, out of Pollock and out of Gorky. It also was one of the first stain pictures, one of the first large field pictures in which the stain technique was used, perhaps the first one. Louis and Noland saw the picture unrolled on the floor of her studio and went back to Washington, DC., and worked together for a while, working at the implications of this kind of painting.

Morris Louis&#x27;s painting &quot;Where&quot; 1960, was a major innovation that moved abstract expressionist painting forward in a new direction toward color field and minimalism. Among Louis&#x27;s major works are his various series of color field paintings. Some of his best known series are the &quot;Unfurleds&quot;, the &quot;Veils&quot;, the &quot;Florals&quot; and the &quot;Stripes&quot; or &quot;Pillars&quot;. From 1929 to 1933, Louis studied at the Maryland Institute of Fine and Applied Arts (now Maryland Institute College of Art). He worked at various odd jobs to support himself while painting and in 1935 was president of the Baltimore Artists&#x27; Association. From 1936 to 1940, he lived in New York and worked in the easel division of the Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project. During this period, he knew Arshile Gorky, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Jack Tworkov, returning to Baltimore in 1940. In 1948, he started to use Magna – oil-based acrylic paints. In 1952, Louis moved to Washington, D.C., living there somewhat apart from the New York scene and working almost in isolation. He and a group of artists that included Kenneth Noland were central to the development of color field painting. The basic point about Louis&#x27;s work and that of other color field painters, sometimes known as the Washington Color School in contrast to most of the other new approaches of the late 1950s and early 1960s, is that they greatly simplified the idea of what constitutes the look of a finished painting.

Noland, working in Washington, DC., was also a pioneer of the color field movement in the late 1950s who used series as important formats for his paintings. Some of Noland&#x27;s major series were called &quot;Targets&quot;, &quot;Chevrons&quot; and &quot;Stripes&quot;. Noland attended the experimental Black Mountain College and studied art in his home state of North Carolina. Noland studied with professor Ilya Bolotowsky who introduced him to neo-plasticism and the work of Piet Mondrian. There he also studied Bauhaus theory and color with Josef Albers and he became interested in Paul Klee, specifically his sensitivity to color. In 1948 and 1949 he worked with Ossip Zadkine in Paris, and in the early 1950s met Morris Louis in Washington, DC.

In 1970 art critic Clement Greenberg said:

I&#x27;d place Pollock along with Hofmann and Morris Louis in this country among the very greatest painters of this generation. I actually don&#x27;t think there was anyone in the same generation in Europe quite to match them. Pollock didn&#x27;t like Hofmann&#x27;s paintings. He couldn&#x27;t make them out. He didn&#x27;t take the trouble to. And Hofmann didn&#x27;t like Pollock&#x27;s allover paintings, nor could most of Pollock&#x27;s artist friends make head or tail out of them, the things he did from 1947 to &#x27;50. But Pollock&#x27;s paintings live or die in the same context as Rembrandt&#x27;s or Titian&#x27;s or Velázquez&#x27;s or Goya&#x27;s or David&#x27;s or ... or Manet&#x27;s or Ruben&#x27;s or Michelangelo&#x27;s paintings. There&#x27;s no interruption, there&#x27;s no mutation here. Pollock asked to be tested by the same eye that could see how good Raphael was when he was good or Piero when he was good.

== Color field movement ==
By the late 1950s and early 1960s young artists began to break away stylistically from abstract expressionism; experimenting with new ways of making pictures; and new ways of handling paint and color. In the early 1960s, several and various new movements in abstract painting were closely related to each other, and superficially were categorized together; although they turned out to be profoundly different in the long run. Some of the new styles and movements that appeared in the early 1960s as responses to abstract expressionism were called: Washington Color School, hard-edge painting, geometric abstraction, minimalism, and color field.

Gene Davis also was a painter known especially for paintings of vertical stripes of color, like &quot;Black Grey Beat&quot; (1964) and he also was a member of the group of abstract painters in Washington, D.C. during the 1960s known as the Washington Color School. The Washington painters were among the most prominent of the mid-century color field painters.

The artists associated with the color field movement during the 1960s were moving away from gesture and angst in favor of clear surfaces and . During the early to mid-1960s, color field painting was the term for the work of artists like Anne Truitt, John McLaughlin, Sam Francis, Sam Gilliam, Thomas Downing, Ellsworth Kelly, Paul Feeley, Friedel Dzubas, Jack Bush, Howard Mehring, Gene Davis, Mary Pinchot Meyer, Jules Olitski, Kenneth Noland, Helen Frankenthaler, Robert Goodnough, Ray Parker, Al Held, Emerson Woelffer, David Simpson, Vasa Velizar Mihich and others whose works were formerly related to second generation abstract expressionism; and also to younger artists like Larry Poons, Ronald Davis, Larry Zox, John Hoyland, Walter Darby Bannard and Frank Stella. All were moving in a new direction away from the violence and anxiety of action painting toward a new and seemingly calmer &quot;language&quot; of color.

Although color field is associated with Clement Greenberg, Greenberg actually preferred to use the term &quot;post-painterly abstraction.&quot; In 1964, Clement Greenberg curated an influential exhibition that traveled the country called &quot;Post-Painterly Abstraction&quot;. The exhibition expanded the definition of color field painting. Color field painting clearly pointed toward a new direction in American painting, away from abstract expressionism. In 2007, Karen Wilkin curated an exhibition called &quot;Color As Field: American Painting 1950–1975&quot; that traveled to several museums throughout the United States. The exhibition showcased several artists representing two generations of color field painters.

In 1970 painter Jules Olitski said:

I don&#x27;t know what Color Field painting means. I think it was probably invented by some critic, which is okay, but I don&#x27;t think the phrase means anything. Color Field painting? I mean, what is color? Painting has to do with a lot of things. Color is among the things it has to do with. It has to do with surface. It has to do with shape, It has to do with feelings which are more difficult to get at.

Jack Bush was a Canadian abstract expressionist painter, born in Toronto, Ontario in 1909. He was a member of Painters Eleven, the group founded by William Ronald in 1954 to promote abstract painting in Canada, and was soon encouraged in his art by the American art critic Clement Greenberg. With encouragement from Greenberg, Bush became closely tied to two movements that grew out of the efforts of the abstract expressionists: color field painting and lyrical abstraction. His painting &quot;Big A&quot; is an example of his color field paintings of the late 1960s.

During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Frank Stella was a significant figure in the emergence of minimalism, post-painterly abstraction and color field painting. His shaped canvases of the 1960s like &quot;Harran II&quot; (1967) revolutionized abstract painting. One of the most important characteristics of Stella&#x27;s paintings is his use of repetition. His black pinstripe paintings of 1959 shocked an art world that was unused to seeing monochromatic and repetitive images, painted flat, with almost no inflection. During the early 1960s, Stella made several series of notched &quot;Aluminum Paintings&quot; and shaped &quot;Copper Paintings&quot; before making multicolored and asymmetrical shaped canvases of the late 1960s. Frank Stella&#x27;s approach and relationship to color field painting was not permanent or central to his creative output; as his work became more and more three-dimensional after 1980.

In the late 1960s, Richard Diebenkorn began his &quot;Ocean Park&quot; series, created during the final 25 years of his career. They are important examples of color field painting. The &quot;Ocean Park&quot; series, exemplified by &quot;Ocean Park No.129&quot;, connects his earlier abstract expressionist works with color field painting. During the early 1950s, Richard Diebenkorn was known as an abstract expressionist, and his gestural abstractions were close to the New York School in sensibility but firmly based in the San Francisco abstract expressionist sensibility; a place where Clyfford Still has a considerable influence on younger artists by virtue of his teaching at the San Francisco Art Institute.

By the mid-1950s, Richard Diebenkorn along with David Park, Elmer Bischoff and several others formed the Bay Area Figurative School with a return to Figurative painting. Between the fall of 1964 and the spring of 1965, Diebenkorn traveled throughout Europe; he was granted a cultural visa to visit and view Henri Matisse paintings in important Soviet museums. These works were rarely seen by people outside of the Soviet Union. When he returned to painting in the Bay Area in mid-1965, his resulting works summed up all that he had learned from his more than a decade as a leading figurative painter. When he returned to abstraction in 1967, his works were parallel to movements like the color field movement and lyrical abstraction, but he remained independent of both.

During the late 1960s, Larry Poons, whose earlier &quot;Dot&quot; paintings were associated with Op Art, began to produce looser and more free formed paintings that were referred to as his &quot;Lozenge Ellipse&quot; paintings of 1967–1968. Along with John Hoyland, Walter Darby Bannard, Larry Zox, Ronald Davis, Ronnie Landfield, John Seery, Pat Lipsky, Dan Christensen and several other young painters a new movement that related to color field painting began to form. It was eventually known as lyrical abstraction. The late 1960s saw painters turning to surface inflection, deep space depiction, painterly touch and paint handling merging with the &quot;language&quot; of color. Among a new generation of abstract painters who emerged combining color field painting with expressionism, the older generation also began infusing new elements of complex space and surface into their works. By the 1970s Poons created thick-skinned, cracked and heavy paintings referred to as &quot;Elephant Skin&quot; paintings; Christensen sprayed loops, colored webs of lines and calligraphy across multicolored fields of delicate grounds; Ronnie Landfield&#x27;s stained band paintings are reflections of both Chinese landscape painting and the color field idiom, and John Seery produced his stained paintings, as exemplified by &quot;East, 1973&quot;, from the National Gallery of Australia. Poons, Christensen, Davis, Landfield, Seery, Lipsky, Zox and several others created paintings that bridge color field painting with lyrical abstraction and underscore a re-emphasis on landscape, gesture and &quot;touch&quot;.

== Overview ==

Color field painting is related to post-painterly abstraction, suprematism, abstract expressionism, hard-edge painting and lyrical abstraction. It initially referred to a particular type of abstract expressionism, especially the work of Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Robert Motherwell, Adolph Gottlieb and several series of paintings by Joan Miró. Art critic Clement Greenberg perceived color field painting as related to but different from action painting.

An important distinction that made color field painting different from abstract expression was the paint handling. The most basic fundamental defining technique of painting is application of paint and the color field painters revolutionized the way paint could be effectively applied.

Color field painting sought to rid art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Adolph Gottlieb, Morris Louis, Jules Olitski, Kenneth Noland, Friedel Dzubas, and Frank Stella, and others often used greatly reduced formats, with drawing essentially simplified to repetitive and regulated systems, basic references to nature, and a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated overt recognizable imagery in favor of abstraction. Certain artists quoted references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of modern art, these artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image often within series&#x27; of related types.

In distinction to the emotional energy and gestural surface marks and paint handling of abstract expressionists such as Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning, color field painting initially appeared to be cool and austere. Color field painters efface the individual mark in favor of large, flat, stained and soaked areas of color, considered to be the essential nature of visual abstraction along with the actual shape of the canvas, which Frank Stella in particular achieved in unusual ways with combinations of curved and straight edges. However, color field painting has proven to be both sensual and deeply expressive albeit in a different way from gestural abstract expressionism. Denying connection to abstract expressionism or any other Art Movement Mark Rothko spoke clearly about his paintings in 1956:
I am not an abstractionist ... I am not interested in the relationship of color or form or anything else. ... I&#x27;m interested only in expressing basic human emotions — tragedy, ecstasy, doom and so on — and the fact that a lot of people break down and cry when confronted with my pictures show that I communicate those basic human emotions. ... The people who weep before my pictures are having the same religious experience I had when I painted them. And if you, as you say, are moved only by their color relationships, then you miss the point!

=== Stain painting ===

Joan Miró was one of the first and most successful stain painters. Although staining in oil was considered dangerous to cotton canvas in the long run, Miró&#x27;s example during the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s was an inspiration and an influence on the younger generation. One of the reasons for the success of the color field movement was the technique of staining. Artists would mix and dilute their paint in buckets or coffee cans making a fluid liquid and then they would pour it into raw unprimed canvas, generally cotton duck. The paint could also be brushed on or rolled on or thrown on or poured on or sprayed on, and would spread into the fabric of the canvas. Generally artists would draw shapes and areas as they stained. Many different artists employed staining as the technique of choice to use in making their paintings. James Brooks, Jackson Pollock, Helen Frankenthaler, Morris Louis, Paul Jenkins, and dozens of other painters found that pouring and staining opened the door to innovations and revolutionary methods of drawing and expressing meaning in new ways. The number of artists who stained in the 1960s greatly increased with the availability of acrylic paint. Staining acrylic paint into the fabric of cotton duck canvas was more benign and less damaging to the fabric of the canvas than the use of oil paint.
In 1970 artist Helen Frankenthaler commented about her use of staining:
When I first started doing the stain paintings, I left large areas of canvas unpainted, I think, because the canvas itself acted as forcefully and as positively as paint or line or color. In other words, the very ground was part of the medium, so that instead of thinking of it as background or negative space or an empty spot, that area did not need paint because it had paint next to it. The thing was to decide where to leave it and where to fill it and where to say this doesn&#x27;t need another line or another pail of colors. It&#x27;s saying it in space.

=== Spray painting ===

Few artists used the spray gun technique to create large expanses and fields of color sprayed across their canvases during the 1960s and 1970s. Some painters who effectively used spray painting techniques include Jules Olitski, who was a pioneer in his spray technique that covered his large paintings with layer after layer of different colors, often gradually changing hue and value in subtle progression. Another important innovation was Dan Christensen&#x27;s use of a spray technique to great effect in loops and ribbons of bright color; sprayed in clear, calligraphic marks across his large-scale paintings. William Pettet, Richard Saba, and Albert Stadler, used the technique to create large-scale fields of multi-colors; while Kenneth Showell sprayed over crumpled canvases and created an illusion of abstract still-life interiors. Most of the spray painters were active especially during the late 1960s and 1970s.

=== Stripes ===

Stripes were one of the most popular vehicles for color used by several different color field painters in a variety of different formats. Barnett Newman, Morris Louis, Jack Bush, Gene Davis, Kenneth Noland and David Simpson, all made important Series&#x27; of stripe paintings. Although he did not call them stripes but &quot;zips&quot; Barnett Newman&#x27;s stripes were mostly vertical, of varying widths and sparingly used. In Simpson and Noland&#x27;s case their stripe paintings were all mostly horizontal, while Gene Davis painted vertical stripe paintings and Morris Louis mostly painted vertical stripe paintings sometimes called &quot;Pillars&quot;. Jack Bush tended to do both horizontal and vertical stripe paintings as well as angular ones.

=== Magna paint ===

Magna, a special &quot;artist use&quot; acrylic paint was developed by Leonard Bocour and Sam Golden in 1947 and reformulated in 1960, specifically for Morris Louis and other stain painters of the color field movement. In Magna pigments are ground in an acrylic resin with alcohol-based solvents. Unlike modern water-based acrylics, Magna is miscible with turpentine or mineral spirits and dries rapidly to a matte or glossy finish. It was used extensively by Morris Louis, and Friedel Dzubas and also by Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein. Magna colors are more vivid and intense than regular acrylic water-based paints. Louis used Magna to great effect in his &quot;Stripe Series&quot;, where the colors are used undiluted and are poured unmixed directly from the can.

=== Acrylic paint ===

In 1972, former Metropolitan Museum of Art curator Henry Geldzahler said:
Color field, curiously enough or perhaps not, became a viable way of painting at exactly the time that acrylic paint, the new plastic paint, came into being. It was as if the new paint demanded a new possibility in painting, and the painters arrived at it. Oil paint, which has a medium that is quite different, which isn&#x27;t water-based, always leaves a slick of oil, or puddle of oil, around the edge of the color. Acrylic paint stops at its own edge. Color field painting came in at the same time as the invention of this new paint.

Acrylics were first made commercially available in the 1950s as mineral spirit-based paints called Magna offered by Leonard Bocour. Water-based acrylic paints were subsequently sold as &quot;latex&quot; house paints, although acrylic dispersion uses no latex derived from a rubber tree. Interior &quot;latex&quot; house paints tend to be a combination of binder (sometimes acrylic, vinyl, pva and others), filler, pigment and water. Exterior &quot;latex&quot; house paints may also be a &quot;co-polymer&quot; blend, but the very best exterior water-based paints are 100% acrylic.

Soon after the water-based acrylic binders were introduced as house paints, both artists – the first of whom were Mexican muralists – and companies began to explore the potential of the new binders. Acrylic artist paints can be thinned with water and used as washes in the manner of watercolor paints, although the washes are fast and permanent once dry. Water-soluble artist-quality acrylic paints became commercially available in the early 1960s, offered by Liquitex and Bocour under the trade name of &quot;Aquatec&quot;. Water-soluble Liquitex and Aquatec proved to be ideally suited for stain painting. The staining technique with water-soluble acrylics made diluted colors sink and hold fast into raw canvas. Painters such as Kenneth Noland, Helen Frankenthaler, Dan Christensen, Sam Francis, Larry Zox, Ronnie Landfield, Larry Poons, Sherron Francis, Jules Olitski, Gene Davis, Ronald Davis, Georg Karl Pfahler, Sam Gilliam and others successfully used water-based acrylics for their new stain, color field paintings.

=== Legacy: influences and influenced ===

The &quot;painterly&quot; legacy of 20th-century painting is a long and intertwined mainstream of influences and complex interrelationships. The use of large opened fields of expressive color applied in generous painterly portions, accompanied by loose drawing (vague linear spots and/or figurative outline) can first be seen in the early 20th-century works of both Henri Matisse and Joan Miró. Matisse and Miró, as well as Pablo Picasso, Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky, and Piet Mondrian directly influenced the abstract expressionists, the color field painters of post-painterly abstraction and the lyrical abstractionists. Late 19th-century Americans like Augustus Vincent Tack and Albert Pinkham Ryder, along with early American Modernists like Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, Stuart Davis, Arthur Dove, and Milton Avery&#x27;s landscapes also provided important precedents and were influences on the abstract expressionists, the color field painters, and the lyrical abstractionists. Matisse paintings &quot;French Window at Collioure&quot;, and &quot;View of Notre-Dame&quot; both from 1914 exerted tremendous influence on American color field painters in general, (including Robert Motherwell&#x27;s &quot;Open Series&quot;), and on Richard Diebenkorn&#x27;s &quot;Ocean Park&quot; paintings specifically. According to art historian Jane Livingston, Diebenkorn saw both Matisse paintings in an exhibition in Los Angeles in 1966, and they had an enormous impact on him and his work. Jane Livingston says about the January 1966 Matisse exhibition that Diebenkorn saw in Los Angeles:
It is difficult not to ascribe enormous weight to this experience for the direction his work took from that time on. Two pictures he saw there reverberate in almost every &quot;Ocean Park&quot; canvas. View of Notre Dame and French Window at Collioure, both painted in 1914, were on view for the first time in the US.

Livingston goes on to say &quot;Diebenkorn must have experienced French Window at Collioure, as an epiphany.&quot;

Miró was one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. He pioneered the technique of staining; creating blurry, multi-colored cloudy backgrounds in thinned oil paint throughout the 1920s and 1930s; on top of which he added his calligraphy, characters and abundant lexicon of words, and imagery. Arshile Gorky openly admired Miró&#x27;s work and painted Miró-like paintings, before finally discovering his own originality in the early 1940s. During the 1960s Miró painted large (abstract expressionist scale) radiant fields of vigorously brushed paint in blue, in white, and other monochromatic fields of colors; with blurry black orbs and calligraphic stone-like shapes, floating at random. These works resembled the color field paintings of the younger generation. Biographer Jacques Dupin said this about Miró&#x27;s work of the early 1960s:
 These canvases disclose affinities – Miró does not in the least attempt to deny this – with the researches of a new generation of painters. Many of these, Jackson Pollock for one, have acknowledged their debt to Miró. Miró in turn displays lively interest in their work and never misses an opportunity to encourage and support them. Nor does he consider it beneath his dignity to use their discoveries on some occasions. 

Taking its example from other European modernists like Miró, the color field movement encompasses several decades from the mid 20th century through the early 21st century. Color field painting actually encompasses three separate but related generations of painters. Commonly used terms to refer to the three separate but related groups are abstract expressionism, post-painterly abstraction, and lyrical abstraction. Some of the artists made works in all three eras, that relate to all of the three styles. Color field pioneers such as Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, John Ferren, Adolph Gottlieb, and Robert Motherwell are primarily thought of as abstract expressionists. Artists like Helen Frankenthaler, Sam Francis, Richard Diebenkorn, Jules Olitski, and Kenneth Noland were of a slightly younger generation, or in the case of Morris Louis aesthetically aligned with that generation&#x27;s point of view; that started out as abstract expressionists but quickly moved to post-painterly abstraction. While younger artists like Frank Stella, Ronald Davis, Larry Zox, Larry Poons, Walter Darby Bannard, Ronnie Landfield, Dan Christensen, began with post-painterly abstraction and eventually moved forward towards a new type of expressionism, referred to as lyrical abstraction. Many of the artists mentioned, as well as many others, have practiced all three modes at one phase of their careers or another. During the later phases of color field painting; as reflections of the zeitgeist of the late 1960s (in which everything began to &quot;hang loose&quot;) and the angst of the age (with all of the uncertainties of the time) merged with the gestalt of post-painterly abstraction, producing lyrical abstraction which combined precision of the color field idiom with the &quot;malerische&quot; of the abstract expressionists. During the same period of the late 1960s, and early 1970s in Europe, Gerhard Richter, Anselm Kiefer and several other painters also began producing works of intense expression, merging abstraction with images, incorporating landscape imagery, and figuration that by the late 1970s was referred to as Neo-expressionism.

<doc id="855797" wikidata="Q219442" url="?curid=855797" title="A Walk to Remember">
<text>A Walk to Remember is a 2002 American coming-of-age romantic drama film directed by Adam Shankman and written by Karen Janszen, based on Nicholas Sparks&#x27; 1999 novel of the same name. It stars Shane West, Mandy Moore, Peter Coyote and Daryl Hannah, and was produced by Denise Di Novi and Hunt Lowry for Warner Bros. Pictures.

The novel&#x27;s 1950s setting was changed from the late 1990s to early 2000s for the film, as the producers were concerned it might not appeal to teenage audiences. This film was shot from April to May of 2001 for nearly 40 days in Wilmington, North Carolina, with many of the sets borrowed from the television series &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;. The film, like the book, is dedicated to the memory of Sparks&#x27;s sister, Danielle, whose cancer-afflicted life inspired the story.

&quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; was theatrically released on January 25, 2002, and grossed $47.5 million worldwide on an $11.8 million budget. Rotten Tomatoes called the film &quot;wholesome&quot; but at the same time &quot;bland and oppressively syrupy&quot;.

==Plot==
In North Carolina, popular and rebellious teenager Landon Carter and his friends leave evidence of underage drinking on school grounds and severely injure another student as the result of a prank. The principal gives him the choice of being expelled or helping the janitorial staff after school as well as tutoring fellow disadvantaged students at their sister school and finally participating in the school play. During these functions, Landon notices Jamie Sullivan, a girl he has known since kindergarten who is the local minister&#x27;s daughter. Since he&#x27;s one of the in-crowd, he has seldom paid attention to Jamie, who wears modest dresses and owns only one sweater. She makes no attempt to wear make-up or otherwise improve her looks or attract attention to herself.

Landon has trouble learning his lines for the play. Jamie, who is also in the play, agrees to help him on one condition: she warns Landon not to fall in love with her. Landon and Jamie begin practicing at her house after school, and a spark of affection arises between them. However, when he blows her off in front of his friends, she decides she wants nothing to do with him. Feeling guilty, he starts taking independent initiative to tutor and to rehearse.

On the opening night of the play, Jamie astounds Landon and the audience with her beauty and voice. Onstage at the ending to the play, Jamie sings. When she finishes, Landon kisses her, which is not part of the play. Jamie continues to avoid him until he gives her a new sweater as a peace offering, and Landon defends her after his friends play a cruel prank on her by photoshopping her head onto the body of a prostitute. Landon asks Jamie on a date, but she says her father doesn&#x27;t allow her to date. Landon asks her father if he may date his daughter. Reluctant at first, he gives in.

On their first date, Landon helps Jamie fulfill her list of things she wants to achieve, such as being in two places at once and getting a tattoo. After that, they go to the docks. Jamie tells Landon about how she experiences belief and how it&#x27;s like the wind. Landon kisses Jamie and confesses his love for her. Landon&#x27;s mother discovers a private list of his aspirations, including going to medical school, to which Landon reveals that Jamie inspires him to be better. On another date, Landon asks Jamie her plans for the future. She then confesses that she isn&#x27;t making any because she has leukemia and hasn&#x27;t been responding to treatment. A desperate Landon asks for his father&#x27;s help in curing her but is disappointed by his reply.

After coming to terms with Jamie&#x27;s condition, Landon promises to be by her side until the end. One day, Jamie collapses and ends up in the hospital. While there, Jamie gives Landon a book that belonged to her mother. She states that maybe God sent Landon to her to help her through the rough times, and that Landon is her angel. Jamie is given private home care by Landon&#x27;s estranged father, relieving her father&#x27;s financial burden. Landon visits his dad, tearfully thanking him for his help. They embrace and are reunited.

Landon is building a telescope for Jamie to be able to see a one-time comet in the springtime. Jamie&#x27;s father helps him get it finished in time. The telescope is brought to her on the balcony, and she gets a beautiful view of the comet. It is then that Landon asks her to marry him. Jamie tearfully accepts, and they get married in the church in which her deceased mother got married. They spend the summer together, and Jamie dies when summer ends.

Four years later, Landon has finished college and been accepted into medical school. He visits Reverend Sullivan to return Jamie’s mother’s book. Landon apologizes that Jamie did not witness a miracle (an ambition she expressed in the class yearbook). The reverend disagrees, saying that she did and that her miracle was Landon.

Landon visits the docks contemplating the belief that although Jamie is dead, she is with him. It is then that he understands that love is like the wind; you can&#x27;t see it, but you can feel it.

==Cast==
==Production==

===Development===
The inspiration for the 1999 novel &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; was Nicholas Sparks&#x27; sister, Danielle Sparks Lewis, who died of breast cancer in 2000. In a speech he gave after her death in Berlin, the author admits that &quot;In many ways, Jamie Sullivan was my younger sister&quot;. The plot was inspired by her life; Danielle met a man who wanted to marry her, &quot;even when he knew she was sick, even when he knew that she might not make it&quot;. Both the book and film are dedicated to Danielle Sparks Lewis.

It was filmed in Wilmington, North Carolina in the spring of 2001, at the same time that &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot; (2002) and the television show &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; were being filmed there. Many of the sets were from &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; (1998)—particularly the school, hospital and Landon&#x27;s home. The total shooting time was originally 50 days, despite Moore being able to only work 10 hours a day because she was a minor. Daryl Hannah, who wore a brown wig as her character, had received a collagen injection in her lips, which went awry and caused noticeable swelling. By the end of filming, however, the symptoms were less obvious.

===Casting===
Director Adam Shankman wanted the lead characters to be portrayed by young actors: &quot;I wanted young actors with whom teenagers could connect&quot;, he said. Shankman arranged a meeting with Shane West after he saw him in a magazine. He was looking for someone who could transition from being very dark to very light. He described his choice as &quot;an instinct&quot; he had about West, who would appear in almost every scene and had &quot;to be either incredibly angry and self-hating or madly in love and heroic.&quot; West said: &quot;I don&#x27;t generally read love stories, but after reading the screenplay, I knew I couldn&#x27;t wait to read the book so I could truly understand Nicholas Sparks&#x27;s story and how he envisioned the character of Landon. It&#x27;s a beautiful story and the characters are very believable, which is what attracted me to the project.

Shankman said of Mandy Moore that she &quot;has the voice and the face of an angel&quot; and added that she is luminous. Moore explained that she was moved by the book: &quot;I had such a visceral reaction to it that I remember not being able to read because I was almost hyperventilating while I was crying.&quot; Commenting on the film, she said: &quot;It was my first movie and I know people say it may be cliché and it&#x27;s a tearjerker or it&#x27;s cheesy, but for me, it&#x27;s the thing I&#x27;m most proud of.&quot;

==Comparisons to novel==
While there are many similarities to the novel by Nicholas Sparks, many changes were made. On his personal website, Sparks explains the decisions behind the differences. For example, he and the producer decided to update the setting from the 1950s to the 1990s, worrying that a film set in the 50s would fail to draw teens. &quot;To interest them,&quot; he writes, &quot;we had to make the story more contemporary.&quot; To make the update believable, Landon&#x27;s pranks and behavior are worse than they are in the novel; as Sparks notes, &quot;the things that teen boys did in the 1950s to be considered a little &#x27;rough&#x27; are different than what teen boys in the 1990s do to be considered &#x27;rough.&#x27;&quot;

Sparks and the producer also changed the play in which Landon and Jamie appear. In the novel, Hegbert Sullivan wrote a Christmas play that illustrated how he once struggled as a father. Due to time constraints, the sub-plot showing how he overcame his struggles could not be included in the film. Sparks was concerned that &quot;people who hadn&#x27;t read the book would question whether Hegbert was a good father&quot;, adding that &quot;because he is a good father and we didn&#x27;t want that question to linger, we changed the play.&quot;

A significant difference is that at the end of the novel, unlike the film, it is ambiguous whether Jamie died. Sparks says that he had written the book knowing she would die, yet had &quot;grown to love Jamie Sullivan&quot;, and so opted for &quot;the solution that best described the exact feeling I had with regard to my sister at that point: namely, that I hoped she would live.&quot;

==Soundtrack==

The film&#x27;s soundtrack was released by Moore&#x27;s first label Epic Records and Sony Music Soundtrax on January 15, 2002. It features six songs by Moore and others by acts Switchfoot, Rachael Lampa and many more.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; grossed $41,281,092 in North America and $6,213,824 in other territories for a worldwide total of $47,494,916.

In its opening weekend, the film grossed $12,177,488, finishing third at the box office behind &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; ($17,012,268) and &quot;Snow Dogs&quot; ($13,079,373).

===Critical reception ===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 30% based on reviews from 105 critics, with an average rating of 4.2/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus says: &quot;Though wholesome, the Mandy Moore vehicle &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; is also bland and oppressively syrupy.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 35 out of 100, based on 26 reviews, which indicates &quot;generally unfavorable&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A on scale of A to F.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; retitled the film &quot;A Walk to Forget&quot;. Michael O&#x27;Sullivan of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;If you can&#x27;t see everything in this film coming from a mile away, then you really need to get out more.&quot; Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com wrote: &quot;A vehicle for teen singing sensation Mandy Moore. As vehicles go, it&#x27;s an Edsel.&quot; In 2010, &quot;Time&quot; named it one of the ten worst chick flicks ever made.

Other reviews were more positive. Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;As Carter, Shane West makes an appealingly persuasive transition from embittered cynic to earnest romantic. Moore, looking a bit like Phoebe Cates&#x27; kid sister, does a fine job of conveying Jamie&#x27;s strong religious convictions as one of many admirable elements in young woman&#x27;s personality. [...] As lead characters discuss their faith—or, in Carter&#x27;s case, the lack thereof—actors are able to make those conversations sound perfectly natural, enabling pic to avoid any trace of overt preachiness.&quot; &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;″ film critic Roger Ebert praised Moore and West for their &quot;quietly convincing&quot; acting performances. The &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; felt that the story &quot;has a fair amount of nuance and charm&quot;. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reviewer Octavio Roca found the film &quot;entertaining&quot; and wrote: &quot;The picture is shamelessly manipulative, but in the best melodramatic sense.&quot; S. Williams of &quot;Momzone&quot; magazine felt that the movie was &quot;everything a chick flick should be&quot; and praised Shankman&#x27;s direction. &quot;Us Weekly&quot; deemed it one of the 30 most romantic movies of all time. In a positive review for &quot;Christianity Today&quot;, Jeffrey Overstreet appreciated how &quot;[t]he main character is portrayed as a Christian without being psychopathic or holier-than-thou&quot;.

==Accolades==

<doc id="855798" wikidata="Q715193" url="?curid=855798" title="Hajime no Ippo">
<text>is a Japanese boxing-themed manga series written and illustrated by George Morikawa. It has been serialized by Kodansha in the manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot; since October 1989, with its chapters collected in 142 volumes as of December 2024. It follows the story of high school student Ippo Makunouchi, as he begins his career in boxing and over time obtains many titles and defeats various opponents.

A 76-episode anime adaptation produced by Madhouse aired on Nippon TV from October 2000 to March 2002. A television film and an original video animation (OVA) were released in 2003. A second series titled &quot;Hajime no Ippo: New Challenger&quot; aired from January to June 2009. A third series &quot;Hajime no Ippo: Rising&quot; aired from October 2013 to March 2014.

In North America, the first series, including the television film, was licensed by Geneon in 2003, which released it under the name Fighting Spirit. It was re-licensed by Discotek Media in 2020, including the television film and the OVA.

By July 2023, the manga had over 100 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. In 1991, &quot;Hajime no Ippo&quot; won the 15th Kodansha Manga Award in the category.

== Plot ==

Ippo Makunouchi is an extremely shy high school student, unable to make friends due to always being busy helping his mother run their family fishing charter business. Because he kept to himself, a group of bullies led by Umezawa got into the habit of picking on him. One day, when these bullies gave him a rather serious beating, a middleweight professional boxer who was passing by stopped them and took the injured Ippo to the , owned by retired boxer Genji Kamogawa, to treat his wounds. After Ippo awoke to the sounds of boxers training, the boxer who saved him, Mamoru Takamura, tried to cheer Ippo up by letting him vent his frustrations on a sandbag. It was then that they had their first glimpse into Ippo&#x27;s talent for boxing. After that incident, Ippo gave the situation a lot of thought and decided that he would like to begin a career as a professional boxer. When he conveys this message to Mamoru Takamura, he gets verbally reprimanded: Takamura thought Ippo was taking professional boxing too lightly. However, Takamura felt that he couldn&#x27;t outright refuse Ippo, especially since his feat of punching the sandbag much harder than anybody else in the gym (except for Takamura). Therefore, he challenges Ippo to catch 10 falling leaves from a tree simultaneously after a week of training, fully convinced that Ippo would fail, Takamura jogs away as he continues his roadwork.

However, after a week of tough training, involving nightly hours, Ippo manages the technique in the nick of time. He waits for the jogging Takamura to come by his usual path and surprises him by catching all 10 of the falling leaves and only doing so with his left hand. This impresses Takamura greatly, and he informs Ippo that the action required to catch all 10 leaves is called a boxing jab. Takamura invites Ippo back to the boxing gym for introductions.

When they got back to the gym, the coach, Genji Kamogawa, was not at all impressed by Makunouchi&#x27;s lack of fighting spirit, and therefore, was challenged by Takamura to have a practice spar against a member of the gym. However, Kamogawa decides to give Ippo a severe challenge and tells him to spar with Miyata, who is 16, the same age as Ippo. Miyata is known as a boxing prodigy and is one of Kamogawa gym&#x27;s future hopes. Takamura gets extremely worried with this prospect, as Miyata skill is way above the four-rounder pro boxer. As expected, Ippo loses by KO, but not until Miyata struggles dodging his punches and finally ends the match with his trump card: &quot;The Counter&quot;. Coach Kamogawa decides that he has great fighting sense and spirit and decides to train him to eventually become the Japanese champion with a world ranking while Miyata became the OPBF (Oriental Pacific Boxing Federation) Champion. Both are expected to hit high in the rankings and, eventually, fight each other for the world champion&#x27;s belt.

The story focuses heavily on character development—even during the matches something is learned about both fighters. Ippo has a habit of running into his opponents before matches, giving him a chance to learn more about their backgrounds and even sympathize with them. Ippo is an extremely timid and modest person who never assumes that he is strong enough. He instead draws courage from seeing the strength of his opponent and realizing that he is able to stand up to it. Ippo and his friendly rivalry with Miyata is the main draw in the early part of the series. That later changes to Ippo&#x27;s path toward the Japanese Featherweight Championship and eventually the world championship. Along the way the audience is given glimpses into the other characters&#x27; pasts, motivations, relationships to others, and current boxing trials. A colorful cast of supporting characters and opponents as well as side stories concerning their paths in the boxing world rounds out the series.

<doc id="855800" wikidata="Q575795" url="?curid=855800" title="Martin Mull">
<text>Martin Eugene Mull (August 18, 1943 – June 27, 2024) was an American comic actor whose career included contributions as a musician and painter. He became known on &quot;Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman,&quot; its spin-off &quot;Fernwood 2 Night,&quot; and &quot;America 2 Night.&quot; Other notable roles included Colonel Mustard in the 1985 film &quot;Clue&quot;, Leon Carp on &quot;Roseanne&quot;, Willard Kraft on &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;, Vlad Masters / Vlad Plasmius on &quot;Danny Phantom&quot;, and Gene Parmesan on &quot;Arrested Development&quot;. He had a recurring role on &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; as Russell, a drug-using, humorous pharmacist.

==Early life and education==
Mull was born in Chicago, the son of Betty Mull, an actress and director, and Harold Mull, an acoustics engineer. He moved with his family to North Ridgeville, Ohio, when he was two years old. They lived there until he was 15 years old when his family moved to New Canaan, Connecticut. He attended and graduated from New Canaan High School. Mull studied painting and graduated in 1965 from the Rhode Island School of Design with a Bachelor of Fine Arts; in 1967, he earned a Master of Fine Arts in painting, also from RISD.

==Career==
===Music===
Mull broke into show business as a songwriter, penning Jane Morgan&#x27;s 1970 country single, &quot;A Girl Named Johnny Cash&quot;, which peaked at No. 61 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s country charts. Shortly thereafter, he began his own recording career.
Throughout the 1970s, and especially in the first half of the decade, Mull was best known as a musical comedian, performing satirical and humorous songs both live and in studio recordings. Rather than use the stage trappings of most musical acts, Mull decorated his stage with comfortable thrift store furniture. Notable live gigs included opening for Randy Newman and Sandy Denny at Boston Symphony Hall in 1973, Frank Zappa at Austin&#x27;s Armadillo World Headquarters in 1973, Billy Joel in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania in 1974; and for Bruce Springsteen at the Shady Grove Music Fair in Gaithersburg, Maryland in October 1974. His self-titled debut album, released by Capricorn in 1972, featured many noteworthy musicians including Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliott, Levon Helm from The Band, Keith Spring of NRBQ, Jack Bone, and Libby Titus.

Elvis Costello and Gary Sperrazza attribute the remark &quot;Writing about music is like dancing about architecture&quot; to Martin Mull.

===Acting===
Mull&#x27;s first well-known acting role was as Garth Gimble in the 1976 television nighttime absurdist soap opera &quot;Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman&quot;. That led to work in the spin-off talk show parodies &quot;Fernwood 2 Night&quot; (1977) and &quot;America 2 Night&quot; (1978), in which he played talk show host Barth Gimble (Garth&#x27;s twin brother), opposite Fred Willard, as sidekick and announcer Jerry Hubbard. Mull appeared as the neurotic, libidinous disc jockey Eric Swan in the 1978 movie &quot;FM&quot;, his feature film debut. In 1979, Mull appeared in the &quot;Taxi&quot; episode &quot;Hollywood Calling&quot;. He created, wrote, and starred in the short-lived 1984 CBS sitcom &quot;Domestic Life&quot;, with Megan Follows playing his teenaged daughter. 

During the 1980s, Mull played supporting roles in the films &quot;Mr. Mom&quot; (1983) and &quot;Clue&quot; (1985), and had a rare lead role in &quot;Serial&quot; (1980). In 1985, he co-created and starred in &quot;The History of White People in America&quot;—the Associated Press said the mockumentary was &quot;what many thought was his best work&quot;. He also starred in a series of commercials for Michelob and Pizza Hut, and in a series of television and radio commercials for Red Roof Inn with Willard. He appeared in the 1986 Pecos Bill episode of the Shelley Duvall TV series &quot;Tall Tales &amp; Legends&quot;. In a 1990 episode of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, he played a hippie who was afraid of the outside world.

Mull had a long-running role from 1991 to 1997 as Leon Carp, Roseanne Conner&#x27;s gay boss (and later business partner) on the TV series &quot;Roseanne&quot;. From 1997 to 2000, he played Willard Kraft on the show &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;; he was Sabrina Spellman&#x27;s high school&#x27;s vice-principal in seasons 2 and 3 and her high school&#x27;s principal in season 4. Mull appeared as a guest star on the game show &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, appearing as the center square in the show&#x27;s final season, from 2003 to 2004. He did the voice of Vlad Masters / Vlad Plasmius, the main villain in &quot;Danny Phantom&quot; from 2004 to 2007. 

In late 2004 and in 2013&#x27;s Netflix-produced Season 4 of &quot;Arrested Development,&quot; Mull portrayed Gene Parmesan, a private investigator. From 2008 to 2013, he had a recurring role on the show &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; as Russell, a humorous drug-using and drug-selling pharmacist. During 2008 and 2009, Mull guest starred in two episodes of the television series &quot;Gary Unmarried&quot;, as Allison&#x27;s father. In 2015, he appeared in two episodes of the TV series &quot;Community&quot; as George Perry, the father of Britta Perry. He also starred in the Fox television sitcoms &quot;Dads&quot; (2013-14) and &quot;The Cool Kids&quot; (2018-19), the latter with David Alan Grier, Vicki Lawrence, and Leslie Jordan. In 2016, Mull appeared as guest star in the satirical TV series &quot;Veep&quot;, a role that earned him an Emmy nomination. His later credits included &quot;The Ranch&quot;, &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot;, and &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot;.

===Art===
Mull began painting in the 1970s, and his work has appeared in group and solo exhibits. He participated in the June 15, 1971 exhibit &quot;Flush with the Walls&quot; in the men&#x27;s room of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts to protest the lack of contemporary and local art in the museum. His first serious one-person exhibition was held in 1980 at the Molly Barnes Gallery in Los Angeles and was credited by artist Mark Kostabi as instrumental in launching his own career because of &quot;Mull&#x27;s simultaneous embrace of humor and gravitas in visual art.&quot; His work often combined photorealist painting, and the pop art and collage styles. He published a book of some of his paintings, titled &quot;Paintings Drawings and Words&quot;, in 1995. One of his paintings was used on the cover for the 2008 Joyce Carol Oates novel &quot;My Sister, My Love&quot;. Another one of his paintings, titled &quot;After Dinner Drinks&quot; (2008), which is owned by Steve Martin, was used for the cover of &quot;Love Has Come for You&quot;, an album by Martin and Edie Brickell.

==Personal life and death==
Mull was divorced twice and then married singer Wendy Haas. Mull and Haas had a daughter, Maggie, who as of 2021 is a co-executive producer for &quot;Family Guy.&quot; In a 2010 interview on &quot;The Green Room with Paul Provenza&quot;, Mull said that he was agnostic: 

Mull died from a long illness at his Los Angeles home on June 27, 2024, at the age of 80, 2 months before his 81st birthday.

<text>The Caboolture railway line refers to the section of Queensland&#x27;s North Coast Line that has a regular suburban railway service, extending north of Brisbane, the state capital of Queensland, Australia. The line commences at Roma Street railway station, travelling through the city and extends through Brisbane&#x27;s northern suburbs to Caboolture, which the line continues north to Sunshine Coast and connects with the Ipswich line south-west of Brisbane. The line distance from Brisbane Central railway station is .

Lines that branch from it are the Ferny Grove line at Bowen Hills, the Doomben and Airport lines at Eagle Junction, the Shorncliffe line at Northgate and the Redcliffe Peninsula line at Petrie.

==History==
The first section of the line, to Northgate (and onto Sandgate) opened in 1882. In 1883 the Queensland government decided to link Gladstone to Brisbane by railway, and eventually decided upon Northgate as the junction for the new line.

The alignment from Roma St to Bowen Hills was via Normanby (today known as the Exhibition line), and this remained the case until the dual track line via Central opened in 1890.

The Queensland Government called tenders for construction of the new line in 1886, with the contractor undertaking works &quot;energetically&quot;, and despite delays due to the late arrival of bridge beams, the line was unofficially opened on 11 June 1888, with the official opening on 16 June 1888. The next section of the North Coast line to Landsborough opened in 1890.

The section from Bowen Hills to Eagle Junction was duplicated in 1886, with the section to Northgate duplicated in 1890, and on to Caboolture by 1917.

The section from Roma St to Bowen Hills was electrified in 1979, to Northgate in 1982, to Petrie in 1983 and to Caboolture in 1986.

The growth in patronage as a result of electrification resulted in the quadruplication of the Roma St-Northgate section in 1996, including 2 pairs of single track tunnels and the realisation of the use of the Bowen Hills tunnel widened 20 years earlier. Some of the roadbed and bridge abutments had been built in the 1950s before the original quadruplication scheme was abandoned. A third line has been added as far as Lawnton, which has been extended to Petrie as part of the Redcliffe Peninsula line, which opened on 4 October 2016. Following the opening of the Redcliffe Peninsula line, a decision was made that all services on the Caboolture line would run express between Petrie and Bowen Hills, stopping only at Northgate and Eagle Junction. Stations between Petrie and Northgate would be serviced by the new Redcliffe Peninsula services while stations between Northgate and Bowen Hills would continue to be serviced by other existing services.

==Line guide and services==
All trains run express between Petrie and Bowen Hills, stopping only at Northgate and Eagle Junction. The typical travel time between Caboolture and Brisbane City is approximately 51 minutes (to Central). A few services that originate or continue to Gympie North on the Sunshine Coast line skips stations between Caboolture and Bowen Hills stopping only at Petrie and Northgate (45 minutes)

During the off-peak, services generally continue to Ipswich railway station on the Ipswich and Rosewood line.

Passengers for/from the Sunshine Coast line change at Petrie or Northgate, Redcliffe Peninsula line at Petrie, Shorncliffe line at Northgate, Airport and Doomben lines at Eagle Junction, Ferny Grove line change at Bowen Hills, and all other lines at Central.

<text>A Torah ark (also known as the hekhal, , or aron qodesh, ) is an ornamental chamber in the synagogue that houses the Torah scrolls.

==History==

The ark is also known as the &quot;ark of law&quot;, or in Hebrew the &quot;Aron Kodesh&quot; () or &quot;aron ha-Kodesh&quot; (&#x27;holy ark&#x27;) in Ashkenazi communities and as the &quot;Hekhal&quot; (&#x27;sanctuary&#x27;) among Sefardi communities. The name &quot;Aron Kodesh&quot; is a reference to the Ark of the Covenant, which was stored in the Holy of Holies in the inner sanctuaries of both the ancient Tabernacle and the Temple in Jerusalem. Similarly, &quot;Hekhál&quot; ( &#x27;palace&#x27;; also written &quot;hechal&quot;, &quot;echal&quot;, &quot;heichal&quot; or &quot;Echal Kodesh&quot;—mainly among Balkan Sephardim) was used in the same time period to refer to the inner sanctuary. The &quot;hekhal&quot; contained the Menorah, Altar of Incense and Table of the Showbread.

==Customs and location==
In some ancient synagogues, such as the fifth-century synagogue in Susya, the Torah scroll was not placed inside the synagogue at all, but in a room adjacent to it, signifying that the sacredness of the synagogue does not come from the ark but from its being a house of prayer. The Torah was brought into the synagogue for reading purposes.

In synagogues outside of Jerusalem, the ark is placed in a chamber that is in a recess in the wall, facing Jerusalem, and worshipers face this direction when reciting prayers of the service such as the Amidah.

The ark is often closed with a &quot;parochet&quot; (&quot;curtain&quot;) placed either outside the doors of the Holy Ark (Ashkenazi and Mizrachi custom) or inside the doors of the ark (Spanish and Portuguese and Moroccan or Sephardic custom). The parochet is an ornate cloth that resembles the same cloth that was once on the golden Ark. Both the aron kodesh and parochet are usually inscribed with verses from Judaic holy scripture. These inscriptions generally display the purity of the synagogue or the celebrated uniqueness of the scrolls placed within.

Jewish law states the ark is the second holiest part of a synagogue after the Torah scrolls themselves. Customs call for the congregation when reciting key prayers (such as Avinu Malkeinu – &quot;Our Father Our King&quot;, in many communities), to stand and face the ark, on fasting days, the Ten Days of Repentance between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur (also called the High Holidays), and for many piyyutim (poems, songs, etc.) recited during High Holy Day services. Many who partake in these customs consider it respectful to stand as long as the ark is open and the Torah is being moved to the reading table (or podium). However, there is no actual obligation (law) to remain standing when the ark is open, but it is a universally accepted custom. In addition to this custom is the custom to never turn ones back towards the ark even when leaving the sanctuary. Instead one must back out until they have left the vicinity of the ark, and only then can they turn their back (by the Kotel which is considered as a synagogue itself, this custom also exists).

== Evolution ==

Originally, the scrolls were placed in moveable containers that were risen up. The more permanent placement of the ark was designed as the tribes settled and built temples. As early as 245 C.E. in the synagogue of Dura-Europos a slit within the holy wall (or wall facing Jerusalem) was created for the ark. In ancient times, the cloth wrapped scrolls are believed to have been placed flat within a low wooden box. Historical records or discoveries point to a variety of exterior designs becoming popular within the Jewish culture of the time. Archeologists found early Torah arks within the Jewish catacombs in Rome decorated with Pompeian frescoes, paintings, and graffiti.

Throughout Europe, in the Middle Ages, designs favored taller arks. In the 14th and 15th centuries, Spanish and German Jewish Hebrew texts depict a new design. These texts placed the scrolls inside the ark standing upright, decorated, and wrapped with the appropriate cloth and covers. A Sephardic synagogue based in Amsterdam (c.1675) contains a baroque style ark, which takes up the entire width of the central hub of the building. The Sephardic synagogue based as far north as London (c. 1701) adopted the design as mainstream. In this period, most synagogues in Europe were designed with the reading table (or podium) in the center of the building. The ark was placed on the Eastern wall, so the congregation would be facing Jerusalem when praying.

During the 18th century, German synagogues incorporated a baroque style design. Decorative features such as pilasters, columns, and vases became a standard practice. Wood and stone carvers in Eastern Europe began to employ unique local craft designs in synagogue architecture. Folk art and animals were popular design features added to arks created during this period. Early designs in the United States featured built-in arks in synagogues, such as the 1763 Touro Synagogue in Newport, Rhode Island, which was inspired by a trend of grandeur in architectural design. The United States Jewish community continued to favor the grand or classical design style until around 1840. In the mid-1800s the Moorish style synagogues influenced by the Oriental style became the latest fashion in synagogue design. The Oriental ark design included sliding doors and a curved forepart. The most notable features of this era included domes and arches that contained geometrical polychrome designs. Many synagogue styles from the 16th to the 19th century can be seen across American and throughout Europe. However, after World War II, the ark design evolved into an art form. New experimental forms and materials were employed in the making of modern arks based on the unique interests of the community commissioning the ark.

<text>Beijing was first connected to outside areas by the Jingshi Expressway in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Now, many expressways connect Beijing with plans for future development.

==History==
When the Airport Expressway and the Jingjintang Expressway opened, Beijing was already gripped by &#x27;expressway fever&#x27;. In the far eastern part of the town, the less popular Jingha Expressway existed until the construction of the Jingtong Expressway in the mid-1990s, which brought more recognition to the Jingha Expressway. However, it is still too far from central Beijing to be considered a key expressway.

By the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s 50th anniversary, more expressways were being built in Beijing. The Badaling Expressway, Jingshen Expressway, and in 2000, the Jingkai Expressway were constructed. Beijing then had eight expressways.

In 2001, the Jingcheng Expressway was built. The northeastern and southeastern parts were ready to accommodate two more expressways (the Jingping/Jingji and Northern Jingji Expressways, respectively).

In 2004, the municipal government publicly announced a plan to complete up to of expressways ( by 2006). By 2006, the 6th Ring Road would be completed, and in the same year, a major batch of expressways would also be finished.

Currently, there are a total of 15 main expressways around Beijing including the Jingping/Jingji, Northern Jingjin, Southern Jingjin, 2nd Airport Expressway, Northern Airport Expressway, Litian Expressway, and the nine existing expressways. Out of these, 11 radiate from the city centre of Beijing, as the majority of residents tend to live farther away from the city centre.

===2005 plan===
In early January 2005, mainland authorities revealed a plan for seven national expressways originating from Beijing. One of these included an expressway that led straight to Taiwan.

The expressways include:
* Beijing - Shanghai (Jinghu Expressway)
* Beijing - Taipei
* Beijing - Kunming
* Beijing - Hong Kong/Macau
* Beijing - Lhasa
* Beijing - Urumqi
* Beijing - Harbin

After the &#x27;Three Links&#x27; came into effect, the projected of mainland expressways will have a connection, possibly by tunnel, to Taiwan and all expressways on the island.

<text>French India, formally the  (), was a French colony comprising five geographically separated enclaves on the Indian subcontinent that had initially been factories of the French East India Company. They were &quot;de facto&quot; incorporated into the Republic of India in 1950 and 1954. The enclaves were , Karikal, Yanam on the Coromandel Coast, Mahé on the Malabar Coast and Chandernagor in Bengal. The French also possessed several (&#x27;lodges&#x27;, tiny subsidiary trading stations) inside other towns, but after 1816, the British denied all French claims to these, which were not reoccupied.

By 1950, the total area measured , of which belonged to the territory of . In 1936, the population of the colony totalled 298,851 inhabitants, of which 63% (187,870) lived in the territory of Pondichéry.

== Background ==



France was the last of the major European maritime powers of the 17th century to enter the East India trade. Six decades after the foundation of the English and Dutch East India companies (in 1600 and 1602 respectively), and at a time when both companies were multiplying factories (trading posts) on the shores of India, the French still did not have a viable trading company or a single permanent establishment in the East.

Seeking to explain France&#x27;s late entrance in the East India trade, historians cite geopolitical circumstances such as the inland position of the French capital, France&#x27;s numerous internal customs barriers, and parochial perspectives of merchants on France&#x27;s Atlantic coast, who had little appetite for the large-scale investment required to develop a viable trading enterprise with the distant East Indies.

== History ==
=== Initial marine voyages to India (16th century) ===
The first French commercial venture to India is believed to have taken place in the first half of the 16th century, in the reign of King Francis I, when two ships were fitted out by some merchants of Rouen to trade in eastern seas; they sailed from Le Havre and were never heard of again. In 1604, a company was granted letters patent by King Henry IV, but the project failed. Fresh letters patent were issued in 1615, and two ships went to India, only one returning.

&quot;La Compagnie française des Indes orientales&quot; (French East India Company) was formed under the auspices of Cardinal Richelieu (1642) and reconstructed under Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1664) when he sent an expedition to Madagascar.

=== First factory in India (1668) ===
In 1667, the French India Company sent out another expedition, under the command of François Caron (who was accompanied by a Persian named Marcara), which reached Surat in 1668 and established the first French factory in India.

=== French expansion in India (1669-1672) ===
In 1669, Marcara succeeded in establishing another French factory at Masulipatam. In 1672, the French captured Fort Saint Thomas, but they were driven out by the Dutch after a long and costly siege. Chandernagore (present-day Chandannagar) was established in 1692, with the permission of Nawab Shaista Khan, the Mughal governor of Bengal. In 1673, the French acquired the area of Pondicherry from the qiladar of Valikondapuram under the Sultan of Bijapur, and thus the foundation of Pondichéry was laid. By 1720, the French had lost their factories at Surat, Masulipatam and Bantam to the British East India Company.

=== Establishment of colony at Pondichéry (1673) ===
On 4 February 1673, Bellanger de l&#x27;Espinay, a French officer, took up residence in the Danish Lodge in Pondichéry, thereby commencing the French administration of Pondichéry. In 1674, François Martin, the first Governor, initiated ambitious projects to transform Pondichéry from a small fishing village into a flourishing port-town. However, the French found themselves in continual conflict with the Dutch and the English. In 1693, the Dutch captured Pondichéry and augmented the fortifications. The French regained the town in 1699 through the Treaty of Ryswick, signed on 20 September 1697.

=== Establishment of colonies at Yanon (1723) and Karaikal (1739) ===
From their arrival until 1741, the objectives of the French, like those of the British, were purely commercial. During this period, the French East India Company peacefully acquired Yanam (about north-east of Pondichéry on Andhra Coast) in 1723, Mahe on Malabar Coast in 1725 and Karaikal (about south of Pondichéry) in 1739. In the early 18th century, the town of Pondichéry was laid out on a grid pattern and grew considerably. Able governors like Pierre Christophe Le Noir (1726–1735) and Pierre Benoît Dumas (1735–1741) expanded the Pondichéry area and made it a large and rich town.

=== Ambition of establishment of French territorial empire in India and defeat (1741–1754) ===
Soon after his arrival in 1741, the most famous governor of French India, Joseph François Dupleix, began to hold the ambition of a French territorial empire in India in spite of the pronounced uninterested attitude of his distant superiors and of the French government, which didn&#x27;t want to provoke the British. Dupleix&#x27;s ambition clashed with British interests in India and a period of military skirmishes and political intrigues began and continued even in rare periods when France and Great Britain were officially at peace. Under the command of the Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau, Dupleix&#x27;s army successfully controlled the area between Hyderabad and Cape Comorin. However, Robert Clive, a British officer, arrived in India in 1744, and dashed the hopes of Dupleix to create a French empire in India. 

After a defeat and failed peace talks, Dupleix was summarily dismissed and recalled to France in 1754.

=== French vs British intrigues (1754–1871) ===
In spite of a treaty between the British and French agreeing not to interfere in regional Indian affairs, their colonial intrigues continued. The French expanded their influence at the court of the Nawab of Bengal and increased their trading activity in Bengal. In 1756, the French encouraged the Nawab (Siraj ud-Daulah) to attack and take the British Fort William in Calcutta. This led to the Battle of Plassey in 1757, where the British decisively defeated the Nawab and his French allies, resulting in the extension of British power over the entire province of Bengal.

Subsequently, France sent Lally-Tollendal to recover the lost French possessions and drive the British out of India. Lally arrived in Pondichéry in 1758, had some initial success and razed Fort St. David in Cuddalore District to the ground in 1758, but strategic mistakes by Lally led to the loss of the Hyderabad region, the Battle of Wandiwash and the siege of Pondicherry in 1760. In 1761, the British razed Pondichéry to the ground in revenge for the French depredations; it lay in ruins for four years. The French had lost their hold now in South India too.

In 1765, Pondichéry was returned to France in accordance with a 1763 peace treaty with Britain. Governor Jean Law de Lauriston set to rebuild the town on its former layout and after five months 200 European and 2000 Tamil houses had been erected. In 1769, the French East India Company, unable to support itself financially, was abolished by the French Crown, which assumed administration of the French possessions in India. During the next 50 years, Pondichéry changed hands between France and Britain with the regularity of their wars and peace treaties.

In 1816, after the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars, the five establishments of Pondichéry, Chandernagore, Karaikal, Mahe and Yanam and the lodges at Machilipatnam, Kozhikode and Surat were returned to France. Pondichéry had lost much of its former glory, and Chandernagore dwindled into an insignificant outpost to the north of the rapidly growing British metropolis of Calcutta. Successive governors tried, with mixed results, to improve infrastructure, industry, law and education over the next 138 years.

By a decree of 25 January 1871, French India was to have an elective general council (&quot;conseil général&quot;) and elective local councils (&quot;conseil local&quot;). The results of this measure were not very satisfactory, and the qualifications for and the classes of the franchise were modified. The governor resided at Pondichéry and was assisted by a council. There were two &quot;Tribunaux d&#x27;instance&quot; (Tribunals of first instance) (at Pondichéry and Karikal) one &quot;Cour d&#x27;appel&quot; (Court of Appeal) (at Pondichéry) and five &quot;Juges de paix&quot; (Justices of the Peace). Agricultural production consisted of rice, peanuts, tobacco, betel nuts and vegetables.

=== Independence movement (18th–20th century) and merger with India (1954) ===
The Independence of India on 15 August 1947 gave impetus to the union of France&#x27;s Indian possessions with former British India. The lodges in Machilipatnam, Kozhikode and Surat were ceded to India on 6 October 1947. An agreement between France and India in 1948 agreed to an election in France&#x27;s remaining Indian possessions to choose their political future. Governance of Chandernagore was ceded to India on 2 May 1950; it was then merged with West Bengal state on 2 October 1954. On 1 November 1954, the four enclaves of Pondichéry, Yanam, Mahe– and Karikal were &quot;de facto&quot; transferred to the Indian Union and became the Union Territory of Puducherry. The &quot;de jure&quot; union of French India with India did not take place until 1962 when the French Parliament in Paris ratified the treaty with India.

===The myth of &quot;our immense empire in India&quot;===
From the mid-19th century onward there developed in France the belief that the five tiny settlements recovered from Britain after the Napoleonic Wars were remnants of the &quot;immense empire&quot; acquired by Dupleix in the 18th century. &quot;Our immense empire of India was reduced to five settlements&quot; wrote French economist and colonial expansion promoter Pierre Paul Leroy-Beaulieu in 1886. An atlas published in the 1930s described those five settlements as &quot;remnants of the great colonial empire that France had created in India in the 18th century&quot;. More recently, a historian of French India post-1816 described them as &quot;debris of an empire&quot; and the &quot;last remnants of an immense empire forever lost&quot;. However, France never held much more than the five settlements recovered in 1816. The historian of French India and archivist Alfred Martineau, who was also governor of French India, pointed out that the authority granted to Dupleix over the Carnatic in 1750 should not be construed as a transfer of sovereignty, as wrote most historians, given that Dupleix only became so to speak the lieutenant of the Indian subah, who could withdraw his power delegation at his convenience. Philippe Haudrère, historian of the French East India Company, also wrote that Dupleix controlled those territories through a complex system of treaties and alliances, a system almost feudal in nature, territories guarded by garrisons with French commanders, but neither annexed nor transformed into protectorates.

== List of French settlements in India ==
 French establishments in the Indian peninsula as of 1839 were:

# On the Coramandel coast,
#* Pondichéry and its territory comprising districts of Pondichéry, Villenour and Bahour;
#* Karikal and its dependent &quot;maganams&quot;, or districts.
# On the coast of Andhra Pradesh,
#* Yanaon and its territory comprising dependent aldées or villages;
#* The Masulipatam lodge and a garden named Francepeth.
# On the Malabar coast,
#* Mahé and its territory;
#* The Calicut lodge.
# In Bengal,
#* Chandernagore and its territory;
#* The five lodges of Cassimbazar, Jougdia, Dacca, Balasore and Patna.
# In Gujarat, 
#* Surat factory.

Under the French East India Company&#x27;s regime, the name &#x27;lodge&#x27; was given to factories or insulated establishments consisting of a home and adjacent ground where France had the right to fly its flag and establish trading posts.

<text>Doomben railway station is the terminal station of the Doomben line in Queensland, Australia. It serves the Brisbane suburb of Ascot adjacent to Doomben Racecourse.

==History==
The Pinkenba line opened on 1 April 1897 to Pinkenba. A station for Doomben Racecourse was opened in 1909 alongside the Nudgee Road level crossing, and in 1976 a new station named Whinstanes-Doomben opened slightly further east. Whinstanes was the name of the industrial branch line that crosses Kingsford Smith Drive to the Hamilton Cold Stores. The original Doomben station was closed.

The new station was renamed Doomben when the line was electrified on 6 February 1988. All passenger services on the line were suspended on 27 September 1993 as part of a statewide rationalisation of the rail network with the closing or suspending of under-utilised or unprofitable rail lines. Trains continued to serve Doomben when major race events were held.

Passenger services resumed on 27 January 1998. Doomben became the terminal station with bus connections to the other abandoned stations.

==Services==
Doomben is the terminus for all stops services to and from Roma Street, Park Road and Cleveland.

==Services by platform==
==Transport links==
Transport for Brisbane operate two bus routes from Doomben station:
*301 Toombul to Cultural Centre
*303: to Myrtletown via Pinkenba

<text>Joanny-Philippe Lagrula (1870–1941) was a French astronomer. He was sometimes referred to as Philippe Lagrula.

In 1901, he wrote his thesis at the University of Lyon. At the time, occultations of the Pleiades by the Moon were important for measuring the correspondence of the Moon&#x27;s actual position with that predicted by theory.

He worked at the Observatory of Lyon, France. On August 1, 1906, he became director of the Quito Astronomical Observatory for a few years. He then worked at Nice Observatory until 1924, when he joined the staff of Algiers Observatory. He was director of Algiers Observatory from 1931 to 1938, replacing François Gonnessiat who retired. His career path mirrored that of Gonnessiat, who had also worked at Lyon, and at the observatories in Quito and Algiers.

At Algiers, one of the staff members working with him was Jean-Louis Lagrula; this may have been his son.

He discovered one asteroid. The asteroid 1412 Lagrula is named after him.

<doc id="855830" wikidata="Q2909301" url="?curid=855830" title="Cottage Life (TV channel)">
<text>Cottage Life is a Canadian English language discretionary specialty channel owned by Blue Ant Media. Operated as a brand extension spin-off of the magazine of the same name, the network originally aired a variety of programming focusing on the cottage and rural lifestyle genre within the core themes of DIY and design, food and entertaining, real estate, and outdoor living. It now primarily airs a limited slate of reality and engineering-focused programming.

The network originally launched in 2001 as Country Canada, which primarily focused on programming of interest to rural Canadians, including news and lifestyle programming. After the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation bought out Corus Entertainment&#x27;s stake in Country Canada, the network began to transition towards marketing itself as a companion to CBC Television, reduced the amount of rural-themed programming it aired in favour of entertainment programs and CBC Sports overflow, and eventually re-branded itself as Bold in 2008. In the midst of budget cuts at the CBC, Bold was sold to its current owners, Blue Ant Media, in April 2012; on September 4, 2013, Bold was re-launched by Blue Ant Media as Cottage Life.

==History==

In November 2000, a joint venture between Corus Entertainment (70%) and the CBC (30%) was granted a television broadcasting licence by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to launch a channel called &quot;Land and Sea&quot;, presumably the name taken from the CBC original series Land and Sea. The newly licensed channel was described as &quot;a national English-language Category 1 specialty television service for rural Canadian families, with a focus on adults 25-54. The service will provide information, interaction and entertainment from a rural perspective.&quot;

The channel was launched on September 4, 2001 as Country Canada; based on the CBC Television series &quot;Country Canada&quot;. The channel held true to its CRTC-mandated nature of service by focusing on rural news, information, lifestyle, and entertainment programming suitable for the whole family. Such programs that were broadcast on the channel included &quot;CountryLine&quot;, a call-in talk show discussing various topics of interest to rural Canadians; &quot;CBC News: CountryWide,&quot; a national news program with both a morning and evening edition focusing on national news stories;&quot; Northern Exposure&quot;; &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;; and the television rendition of Harrowsmith Country Life. 

In July 2002, the CBC announced it would purchase Corus&#x27; interest in the service, which was approved by the CRTC on October 24 of that year. The CBC took control of the service on November 1, 2002 and rebranded the service with a new logo and name, CBC Country Canada.
After the change in ownership, the CBC initially relied heavily on CBC Television programming to fill the channel&#x27;s schedule, with a particular focus on news programs. This transition was the first step in the channel moving away from its mandate to focus solely on rural programming, instead, shifting towards a focus on general interest Canadian programming. New programming added to the schedule included all 14 30-minute regional editions of Canada Now, Venture, CBC News: Politics, amateur sports programming from CBC Sports, CBC News: Saturday Report, and Cross Country Checkup.

After the initial change in programming after the rebranding, news, although still present on the channel, became less significant as the channel began to air more lifestyle, entertainment, and documentary programming such as Food Chain, an original program discussing various aspects of food; Greatdocs.ca, a series of various Canadian-made documentaries; Johnny Canuck Cinema, a series of various Canadian films; An American in Canada; and London&#x27;s Burning.

Eventually, beginning in 2005, with the change in programming to focus more on general Canadian programming rather than solely rural-programming, the channel began to continuously promoted itself and its programs as a channel, according to its website, dedicated to &quot;celebrating Canada, its land, people, regions and passions&quot;. This shift included an increase in dramatic television series from Canada and Britain that had little to no relation to the rural lifestyle, and an increase in amateur sports coverage including alpine skiing, curling, snowboarding, Toronto FC, and Canada national team soccer, among others. In further continuation with this shift, in early 2007, CBC Country Canada began to no longer promote itself as a rural lifestyle service, rather as a secondary general entertainment service to the CBC, touting, according to its website &quot;the new home of exclusive dramas and world championship sports, from home and around the world. From provocative documentaries to a new series of investigative thrillers, CBC Country Canada has something for everyone.&quot; Programs at this point in time included such series as Vincent, Sensitive Skin, Monkey Dust, This Is Wonderland, and 72 Hours: True Crime.

On March 27, 2008 at 12:01 a.m. EST, CBC Country Canada was rebranded as Bold to better reflect the programming direction CBC Country Canada was moving in, and to focus its programming on drama, comedy, the arts, and sports rather than an informational and lifestyle service for rural Canadians.

In time for its companion coverage of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, a high-definition feed launched on June 3, 2010.

===Nature of service dispute===
Prior to rebranding the service as Bold, the CBC informed the CRTC in October 2007 of its intentions and new programming directive for the service. Following this correspondence, the CBC and the CRTC exchanged correspondence back and forth in an effort to clarify how the change in programming for Bold met the nature of service Bold was intended to meet when it was originally licensed in 2000. The CRTC ultimately was not satisfied with the CBC&#x27;s argument and called a public hearing into the matter in June 2009.

Prior to the hearing, the CBC contacted the CRTC to inform them that they did not contest the CRTC&#x27;s view that the service did not meet the requirements of its nature of service and informed the CRTC that it would like to file an application to modify Bold&#x27;s nature of service to state it is &quot;a national English-language Category 1 specialty television service for rural Canadians. The service will provide information, interaction and entertainment.&quot;

During the separate hearing for the application to modify Bold&#x27;s nature of service at a later date, the CRTC examined the request and found several issues with the change in nature of service, primarily being that it would allow the service to morph into a general interest service instead of a niche service for rural Canadians, since it would not require the channel to be from &quot;a rural perspective&quot;, implying a service defined as &quot;for rural Canadians&quot; would be too broad in nature. Subsequently, the CRTC denied its application and required the CBC to inform the CRTC within 30 days of a new programming proposal to ensure its meets the channel&#x27;s nature of service.

In response to this decision, the CBC filed yet another application to amend Bold&#x27;s nature of service, this time reading as &quot;a national English-language Category A specialty television service with a focus on adults 25-54. The service will provide information, interaction and entertainment programming dedicated to reflecting Canada&#x27;s various regions, including Canada&#x27;s rural and non-urban regions, to national and regional audiences. The mandate of the service will be to reflect in its programming the unique tapestry of Canada&#x27;s regions, including programming that reflects the living realities of rural Canadians.&quot; Within this application, the CBC also requested to define rural Canadians using Statistics Canada definition, reading as &quot;individuals from rural non-metro adjacent areas, rural metro adjacent areas and rural northern areas.&quot;

Although the CRTC raised some concerns over the proposed schedule the CBC submitted as part of this application, the CRTC ultimately approved the application and was satisfied with the changes, stating that the new definition of rural Canadians was more appropriate since it reflected their geographical location, rather than their occupations as the previous nature of service defined; and to ensure the programming reflected Canada&#x27;s various regions, as per the new nature of service, the CRTC added a definition of such programming.

===Blue Ant Media purchase===
On April 4, 2012, the CBC announced, in the wake of a $115 million government funding budget cut to be phased in over the next 3 years, that it would sell Bold as a measure to cope with the budget shortfall since the service&#x27;s licence conditions no longer fit the CBC&#x27;s strategy nor complement the other programming streams. On August 17, 2012, Blue Ant Media announced that it would purchase the channel for an undisclosed amount, later revealed at $10 million. As a federal crown corporation asset owned by the CBC, the deal also required approval from the Governor-in-Council, which was approved in February 2013. On November 17, 2012, the CRTC approved the sale of Bold to Blue Ant Media. As a condition of the acquisition, Blue Ant stated that it would fund the production of programming that reflects Canada&#x27;s rural and non-urban regions.

====Rebranding as Cottage Life====
In July 2011, Blue Ant Media purchased a 15% interest in Quarto Communications, with its intentions of launching several television channels based upon Quarto&#x27;s magazine brands, in particular, Cottage Life. Later, in November 2011, Quarto was granted a license for a Category B service known as Cottage Life Television, which would be focused on programming dealing with cottage communities and lifestyles. Four months after it announced its intentions to purchase Bold, Blue Ant would later purchase the remaining shares in Quarto Communication and rename the company Cottage Life Media.

In April 2013, Blue Ant announced it would launch Cottage Life in the fall of 2013; it was speculated that the company would re-launch Bold as a Cottage Life channel, primarily because the rural-based nature of service complimented the subject matter that Cottage Life covered and Bold had existing carriage deals on the majority of all digital television service providers in Canada due to its Category A status. However, Blue Ant did not confirm any rumours or its intentions for the channel.

Although still with no public announcement of the channel&#x27;s re-branding from Blue Ant Media, it was indirectly confirmed through various television service providers (i.e., announcements on the respective TV provider&#x27;s websites, statements confirming Cottage Life&#x27;s television placement on the dial would be that of Bold&#x27;s, etc.) that Bold would be re-branded as Cottage Life on September 4, 2013. It was confirmed on August 22, 2013 by Blue Ant Media that Bold would be rebranded on September 4 via a press release.
