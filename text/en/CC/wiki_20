<text>Royal Air Force Tangmere or more simply RAF Tangmere is a former Royal Air Force station located in Tangmere, England, famous for its role in the Battle of Britain. 

It was one of several stations near Chichester, West Sussex. The Second World War aces Wing Commander Douglas Bader, and the then inexperienced Johnnie Johnson were stationed at Tangmere in 1941.

==History==

===First World War===
The aerodrome was founded in 1917 for use by the Royal Flying Corps as a training base. In August 1918 it was sold to the US Government and turned over to the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps (USSC) as a training ground for US-built Handley-Page O/400, although almost none were completed by the time of the Armistice. The Aviation Section of the American Expeditionary Forces (ASAEF) agreed to improve the airfield and constructed further hangars. Tangmere continued to host the 92d Aero Squadron until the end of the Great War in November 1918, after which the airfield was put up for sale at the end of 1919.

===Inter-War Years===
Responsibility for the Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB) passed from the War Department to the Air Ministry, and Tangmere, in its finished state, was one of the first airfields to be re-activated. By the end of 1923 it was re-purchased by the Crown and in 1925 the station re-opened to serve the RAF&#x27;s new fighter capability. It went operational in late 1926 with No. 43 Squadron from RAF Henlow equipped with biplane Gloster Gamecocks. They were joined by a nucleus of officers from 1 Squadron and a friendly rivalry grew up between the two squadrons., who later flew Armstrong Whitworth Siskins.

As war threatened in the late 1930s, the fighter aircraft based at Tangmere became faster, with Hawker Furies, Gloster Gladiators, and Hawker Hurricanes all being used.

In 1934, Squadron Leader C W Hill, a famous First World War prisoner-of-war escaper, commanded No. 1 Fighter Squadron at RAF Tangmere. Two years later, as a Wing Commander, he became the station commander.

Additional units:
* Coastal Area Storage Unit (1925-28)
* 1 Squadron between 1927-39
* 43 Squadron between 1926-39

===Second World War===

In a memoir, Peter Townsend (noted Battle of Britain pilot and, post-war, romantically linked with Princess Margaret), recounts the arrival of 605 Squadron at Tangmere, just before the outbreak of war. Townsend says that

Things hummed at Tangmere Cottage, just opposite the guard room, where [605&#x27;s commanding officer John Willoughby de Broke and his wife Rachel] kept open house. There we spent wild evenings, drinking, singing, dancing to romantic tunes . . . we danced blithely, relentlessly towards catastrophe. . . . With one chance in five of survival - not counting the burnt and the wounded - only a handful of us would come through.

In 1939 the airfield was enlarged to defend the south coast against attack by the Luftwaffe, with Tangmere&#x27;s only hotel and some houses being demolished in the process. The RAF commandeered the majority of houses in the centre of the village, with only six to eight families being allowed to stay. The village would not resume its status as a civilian community until 1966.

In August 1940 the first squadron (No. 602 Squadron RAF) of Supermarine Spitfires was based at the satellite airfield at nearby Westhampnett, as the Battle of Britain began. By now the villagers had mainly been evacuated, and extensive ranges of RAF buildings had sprung up.

The first, and worst, enemy raid on the station came on 16 August 1940 when hundreds of Junkers Ju 87 (Stuka) dive bombers and fighters crossed the English coast and attacked Tangmere. There was extensive damage to buildings and aircraft on the ground and 14 ground staff and six civilians were killed. However the station was kept in service and brought back into full operation.

Throughout the war, the station was used by the Royal Air Force Special Duty Service when 161 (Special Duty) Squadron&#x27;s Westland Lysander flight came down to do their insertion and pick-up operations into occupied Europe. The SOE used Tangmere Cottage, opposite the main entrance to the base to house and receive their agents. Today the cottage sports a commemorative plaque to its former secret life.

Later in the war, as the RAF turned from defence to attack, Group Captain Douglas Bader, the legless fighter ace, commanded the Tangmere wing of Fighter Command. Today he is commemorated by a plaque outside the former &quot;Bader Arms&quot; public house, now a Co-operative Food outlet in the village. 616 Squadron, which included Johnnie Johnson and Hugh Dundas, arrived at Tangmere in late February 1941. Johnson went on to become the highest scoring Western Allied fighter ace against the Luftwaffe.

For D-Day, the RAF created Airfield Headquarters units which transformed into wings to control multiple similar squadrons for offensive actions for eventual use in mainland Europe.

Many of those killed at the base, from both sides in conflict, are buried in the cemetery at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Tangmere, today tended by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. American RAF pilot Billy Fiske who died at Tangmere in 1940 was one of the first American aviators to die during the Second World War.

===Postwar===

Towards the end of the war, the Central Fighter Establishment arrived from RAF Wittering on 27 February 1945 with the station being renamed as CFE Tangmere. The RAF High Speed Flight was re-formed here on 14 June 1946 and in September 1946, a world air speed record of 616 mph (991 km/h) was set by Group Captain Edward &quot;Teddy&quot; Mortlock Donaldson in a Gloster Meteor F.4; after his death in 1992, he was buried in St Andrew&#x27;s Church. In September 1953, Squadron Leader Neville Duke became holder of the world air speed record when he flew a modified Hawker Hunter prototype at 727.63 mph (1,170 km/h) – the 50th anniversary of this event was commemorated in 2003. 

A number of units associated with the CFE also arrived including:
* Day Fighter Leaders School (1945) part of CFE
* Enemy Aircraft Flight RAF (1945) part of CFE
* Fighter Interception Development Squadron RAF (1945) part of CFE
* Night Fighter Development Wing RAF (1945) part of CFE
* Night Fighter Training Squadron RAF (1945) part of CFE
* 787 Naval Air Squadron, Fleet Air Arm (1945) connection to CFE

The unit moved to RAF West Raynham on 1 October 1945, while No. 85 Squadron RAF arrived on 11 October 1945 with the de Havilland Mosquito XXX. It upgraded to the Mosquito NF.36 from January 1946. The unit deployed to RAF Lubeck and RAF Acklington for varying periods of time, until finally leaving Tangmere on 16 April 1947, for RAF West Malling. No. 1 Squadron RAF returned on 30 April 1946 from their previous base of RAF Hutton Cranswick with the Supermarine Spitfire F.21; the unit deployed to Acklington and Lubeck at various times. From October 1946 the Gloster Meteor F.3 was introduced but was replaced by the Harvard T.2b and Oxford T.2 from August 1947, in preparation for conversion to the Meteor F.4 which arrived during June 1948. This was replaced by the F.8 during August 1950 and this in turn was replaced by the Hawker Hunter F.5 in September 1958. The squadron was disbanded on 1 July 1958. No. 222 (Natal) Squadron RAF arrived on 2 October 1946 from RAF Weston Zoyland. They were already operating the Meteor F.3 and converted to the newer F.4 during the first few months of 1948, before moving to RAF Lubeck on 1 May 1948.

On 1 June 1950, a Gloster Meteor flying eastwards over Portsmouth reported a UFO at 20,000 ft. It was also seen by the radar at RAF Wartling, and was described as &quot;Britain&#x27;s first flying saucer&quot;, and led to the Flying Saucer Working Party later that year.

No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF arrived on 16 April 1947 from RAF Wattisham with the Meteor F.3, replacing No. 85 Squadron RAF. No. 266 Squadron upgraded to the Meteor F.4 from February 1948, with the squadron deploying to Lubeck and Acklington during its stay. 266 was disbanded on 11 February 1949 and renumbered as No. 43 Squadron RAF The Meteor F.8 was introduced from September 1950 and the squadron moved to RAF Leuchars on 11 November 1950. On 25 November 1950 No. 29 Squadron RAF arrived from RAF West Malling with the Mosquito NF.30, converting to the Meteor NF.11 from July 1951. The squadron moved to RAF Acklington on 14 January 1957 where it eventually re-equipped with the Gloster Javelin FAW.6. On 1 August 1954 No. 34 Squadron RAF was re-formed here with the Meteor F.8, upgrading to the Hunter F.5 from October 1955 before being disbanded on 15 January 1958. On 30 September 1957 No. 25 Squadron RAF arrived from RAF West Malling, flying the Meteor NF.12 &amp; NF.14 until 1 July 1958 when the squadron was disbanded.

No. 164 (Argentine–British) Squadron RAF arrived from RAF Turnhouse on 25 March 1946 with the Spitfire IX, staying until 26 April 1946 when the squadron moved to RAF Middle Wallop. No. 587 Squadron RAF arrived from RAF Weston Zoyland on 1 June 1946 with the Spitfire XVI, for two weeks before being disbanded. No. 69 Squadron RAF arrived on 19 April 1947 from RAF Wahn during a break from West Germany. It used the Mosquito B.16 until 16 May 1947 when it moved back to Wahn. On 1 July 1950 No. 74 (Trinidad) Squadron RAF, with its Meteor F.4s, arrived Jefford|1988|p=48}}from RAF Horsham St Faith {{sfn|, on deployment for 8 days.

In the late 1950s flying was reduced to ground radar calibration under RAF Signals Command, upon the arrival of No. 115 Squadron RAF on 25 August 1958 from RAF Watton, with the Varsity T.1. The Valetta C.1 was introduced from August 1963 but the squadron moved back to Watton on 1 October 1963.{{sfn|Jefford|1988|p=57}} No. 245 Squadron RAF arrived on 25 August 1958 from Watton. The squadron was equipped with the Canberra B.2 but was disbanded on 19 April 1963, to become No. 98 Squadron.{{sfn|Jefford|1988|p=77}} No. 98 Squadron RAF used the Canberra B.2 until 1 October 1963 when it moved to RAF Watton.{{sfn|Jefford|1988|p=53}} Between January and March 1958 a detachment of No. 208 Squadron RAF operated here, training crews on the new Hunter F.6.{{sfn|Jefford|1988|p=69}}

The Joint Services Language School moved here and in 1960 the station was granted the &quot;freedom of the City of Chichester&quot;, the event being marked by a march through the town and service in the Cathedral.

No. 38 Group Tactical Communications Wing RAF and 244 Signal Squadron (Air Support) were the last units to leave the base, relocating to RAF Benson.

Some of the last flying units to be based at the station included:

In 1963-64 the last flying units left. However the station continued to be used for several years and, in 1968, Prince Charles took his first flying lesson at Tangmere. The station finally closed on 16 October 1970; a single Spitfire flew over the airfield as the RAF ensign was lowered for the last time.

== Present use ==
Following the closure of the RAF station, some of the land around the runways was returned to farming. Tangmere Airfield Nurseries have built large glasshouses for the cultivation of peppers and aubergines.

Until 1983 {{convert|37|acre|m2}} of barracks, admin blocks and repair workshops remained derelict until bought by Seawards Properties Ltd. Housing soon spread around the airfield, and most RAF buildings were demolished. Officers&#x27; quarters have been retained as homes and two original RAF buildings remain, the Grade II listed Control Tower, and one of the &#x27;H Block&#x27; accommodation buildings.

The majority of the airfield is now farmed, and since 1979 the runways have slowly been removed thus returning the whole airfield back to large scale farming once again. In 2016 the final piece of apron and the three T.2 hangars were removed, with houses built in their place on a street called Hangar Drive.

The derelict control tower forms part of the farm but is now bricked up and partly overgrown. It became a Grade II listed building in 2011 and was placed on the Heritage at Risk Register in 2015. A campaign is currently underway to restore the control tower which has received local and national press coverage. This is being led by Tangmere Tower Community Interest Company, who restaged &#x27;The Eisenhower Dinner&#x27; at the Chichester Harbour Hotel in 2019 to mark the 75th anniversary of General Eisenhower&#x27;s original meal in 1944. The CIC are working with the local Aviation Museum, the University of Chichester and Sussex Police and with their architect have submitted a planning application for phase one of the project.

===Tangmere Military Aviation Museum===
{{Main|Tangmere Military Aviation Museum}}
Tangmere Military Aviation Museum was founded by a group of enthusiastic veterans. It has a replica Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane as well as many original aircraft, including Neville Duke&#x27;s speed record Hawker Hunter. On display is the &#x27;Star&#x27; Meteor flown by Teddy Donaldson when he set the World Air Speed Record in September 1946, breaking the 1,000 km/h barrier.

==34067 locomotive==
A number of Oliver Bulleid&#x27;s light pacific locomotives were named after Battle of Britain squadrons, stations, or commanders. One such locomotive that is preserved and still in main line operation is named &quot;Tangmere&quot; (no 34067).{{Citation needed|date=April 2023}}

<doc id="850253" wikidata="Q839030" url="?curid=850253" title="Hawaiian sovereignty movement">
<text>The Hawaiian sovereignty movement () is a grassroots political and cultural campaign to reestablish an autonomous or independent nation or kingdom of Hawaii out of a desire for sovereignty, self-determination, and self-governance. 

Some groups also advocate some form of redress from the United States for its 1893 overthrow of Queen Liliʻuokalani, and for what is described as a prolonged military occupation beginning with the 1898 annexation. The movement generally views both the overthrow and annexation as illegal. 

Palmyra Atoll and Sikaiana were annexed by the Kingdom in the 1860s, and the movement regards them as under illegal occupation along with the Hawaiian Islands. 

The Apology Resolution the United States Congress passed in 1993 acknowledged that the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom was an illegal act.

Sovereignty advocates have attributed problems plaguing native communities including homelessness, poverty, economic marginalization, and the erosion of native traditions to the lack of native governance and political self-determination. 

The forced depopulation of Kaho&#x27;olawe and its subsequent bombing, the construction of the Mauna Kea Observatories, and the Red Hill water crisis caused by the US Navy&#x27;s mismanagement are some of the contemporary matters relevant to the sovereignty movement. 

It has pursued its agenda through educational initiatives and legislative actions. Along with protests throughout the islands, at the capital (Honolulu) itself and other locations sacred to Hawaiian culture, sovereignty activists have challenged U.S. forces and law.

== History ==
Coinciding with other 1960s and 1970s indigenous activist movements, the Hawaiian sovereignty movement was spearheaded by Native Hawaiian activist organizations and individuals who were critical of issues affecting modern Hawaii, including the islands&#x27; urbanization and commercial development, corruption in the Hawaiian Homelands program, and appropriation of native burial grounds and other sacred spaces. In the 1980s, the movement gained cultural and political traction and native resistance grew in response to urbanization and native disenfranchisement. Local and federal legislation provided some protection for native communities but did little to quell expanding commercial development.

In 1993, a joint congressional resolution apologized for the 1893 overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy, and said that the overthrow was illegal. In 2000, the Akaka Bill was proposed, which provided a process for federal recognition of Native Hawaiians, and gave ethnic Hawaiians some control over land and natural resource negotiations. But sovereignty groups opposed the bill because of its provisions that legitimized illegal land transfers, and it was criticized by a 2006 U.S. Commission on Civil Rights report (which was later reversed in 2018) for the effect it would have on non-ethnic Hawaiian populations. A 2005 Grassroot Institute poll found that most Hawaiian residents opposed the Akaka Bill.

== Background ==
Native Hawaiians&#x27; ancestors may have arrived in the Hawaiian Islands around 350CE, from other areas of Polynesia. By the time Captain Cook arrived, Hawaii had a well-established culture, with a population estimated between 400,000 and 900,000. Starting in 1795 and completed by 1810, Kamehameha I conquered the entire archipelago and formed the unified Kingdom of Hawaii. In the first 100 years of contact with Western civilization, due to disease and war, the Hawaiian population dropped by 90%, to only 53,900 in 1876. American missionaries arrived in 1820 and assumed great power and influence. Despite formal recognition of the Kingdom of Hawaii by the United States and other world powers, the kingdom was overthrown beginning January 17, 1893, with a coup d&#x27;état orchestrated mostly by Americans within the kingdom&#x27;s legislature, supported by armed sailors landed by the USS Boston.

The &quot;Blount Report&quot; is the popular name given to the part of the 1893 United States House of Representatives Foreign Relations Committee Report about the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. U.S. Commissioner James H. Blount, appointed by President Grover Cleveland to investigate the events surrounding the January 1893 coup, conducted the report. It provides the first evidence that officially identifies U.S. complicity in the overthrow of the government of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Blount concluded that U.S. Minister to Hawaii John L. Stevens had carried out unauthorized partisan activities, including the landing of U.S. Marines under a false or exaggerated pretext to support anti-royalist conspirators; the report also found that these actions were instrumental to the revolution&#x27;s success and that the revolution was carried out against the wishes of a majority of the population of the Hawaiian Kingdom and/or its royalty.
 On December 14, 1893, Albert Willis arrived unannounced in Honolulu aboard the USRC &quot;Corwin&quot;, bringing with him an anticipation of an American invasion in order to restore the monarchy, which became known as the &quot;Black Week&quot;. Willis was Blount&#x27;s successor as United States Minister to Hawaii. With the hysteria of a military assault, he staged a mock invasion with the USS &quot;Adams&quot; and USS &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, directing their guns toward the capital. He also ordered Rear Admiral John Irwin to organize a landing operation using troops on the two American ships, which were joined by the Japanese &quot;Naniwa&quot; and the British HMS &quot;Champion&quot;. On January 11, 1894, Willis revealed the invasion to be a hoax. After the arrival of the &quot;Corwin&quot;, the provisional government and citizens of Hawaii were ready to rush to arms if necessary, but it was widely believed that Willis&#x27;s threat of force was a bluff.

On December 16, the British Minister to Hawaii was given permission to land marines from HMS &quot;Champion&quot; for the protection of British interests; the ship&#x27;s captain predicted that the U.S. military would restore the Queen and Sovereign ruler (Lili&#x27;uokalani). In a November 1893 meeting with Willis, Lili&#x27;uokalani said she wanted the revolutionaries punished and their property confiscated, despite Willis&#x27;s desire for her to grant them amnesty. In a December 19, 1893, meeting with the leaders of the provisional government, Willis presented a letter by Liliuokalani in which she agreed to grant the revolutionaries amnesty if she were restored as queen. During the conference, Willis told the provisional government to surrender to Liliuokalani and allow Hawaii to return to its previous condition, but the leader of the provisional government, President Sanford Dole, refused, claiming that he was not subject to the authority of the United States.

The Blount Report was followed in 1894 by the Morgan Report, which contradicted Blount&#x27;s report by concluding that all participants except for Queen Lili&#x27;uokalani were &quot;not guilty&quot;. On January 10, 1894, U.S. Secretary of State Walter Q. Gresham announced that the settlement of the situation in Hawaii would be up to Congress, following Willis&#x27;s unsatisfactory progress. Cleveland said that Willis had carried out the letter of his directions rather than their spirit. Domestic response to Willis&#x27;s and Cleveland&#x27;s efforts was largely negative. The &quot;New York Herald&quot; wrote, &quot;If Minister Willis has not already been ordered to quit meddling in Hawaiian affairs and mind his own business, no time should be lost in giving him emphatic instructions to that effect.&quot; The &quot;New York World&quot; wrote: &quot;Is it not high time to stop the business of interference with the domestic affairs of foreign nations? Hawaii is 2000 miles from our nearest coast. Let it alone.&quot; The &quot;New York Sun&quot; said: &quot;Mr. Cleveland lacks ... the first essential qualification of a referee or arbitrator.&quot; The &quot;New York Tribune&quot; called Willis&#x27;s trip a &quot;forlorn and humiliating failure to carry out Mr. Cleveland&#x27;s outrageous project.&quot; The &quot;New York Recorder&quot; wrote, &quot;The idea of sending out a minister accredited to the President of a new republic, having him present his credentials to that President and address him as &#x27;Great and Good Friend,&#x27; and then deliberately set to work to organize a conspiracy to overthrow his Government and re-establish the authority of the deposed Queen, is repugnant to every man who holds American honor and justice in any sort of respect.&quot; The &quot;New York Times&quot; was one of the few New York newspapers to defend Cleveland&#x27;s decisions, writing, &quot;Mr. Willis discharged his duty as he understood it.&quot;

After the overthrow, the Provisional Government of Hawaii became the Republic of Hawaii in 1894, and in 1898 the U.S. annexed the Republic of Hawaii in the Newlands Resolution, making it the Territory of Hawaii. The territory was then given a territorial government in an Organic Act in 1900. While there was much opposition to the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii and many attempts to restore it, Hawaii became a U.S. territory in 1898 without any input from Native Hawaiians. It became a U.S. state on March 18, 1959, following a referendum in which at least 93% of voters approved of statehood. By then, most voters were not Native Hawaiian. The 1959 referendum did not have an option for independence from the United States. After Hawaii&#x27;s admission as a state, the United Nations removed Hawaii from its list of non-self-governing territories (a list of territories subject to the decolonization process).

The U.S. constitution recognizes Native American tribes as domestic, dependent nations with inherent rights of self-determination through the U.S. government as a trust responsibility, which was extended to include Eskimos, Aleuts and Native Alaskans with the passing of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Through enactment of 183 federal laws over 90 years, the U.S. has entered into an implicit—rather than explicit—trust relationship that does not formally recognize a sovereign people with the right of self-determination. Without an explicit law, Native Hawaiians may not be eligible for entitlements, funds and benefits afforded to other U.S. indigenous peoples. Native Hawaiians are recognized by the U.S. government through legislation with a unique status. Proposals have been made to treat Native Hawaiians as a tribe similar to Native Americans; opponents to the tribal approach argue that it is not a legitimate path to nationhood.

=== Historical groups ===
====Royal Order of Kamehameha I====

The Royal Order of Kamehameha I is a Knightly Order established by His Majesty, Kamehameha V (&quot;Lot Kapuaiwa Kalanikapuapaikalaninui Ali&#x27;iolani Kalanimakua&quot;) in 1865, to promote and defend the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi&#x27;s sovereignty. Established by the 1864 Constitution, the Order of Kamehameha I is the first order of its kind in Hawaii. After Lot Kapuāiwa took the throne as King Kamehameha V, he established, by special decree, the Order of Kamehameha I on April 11, 1865, named to honor his grandfather Kamehameha I, founder of the Kingdom of Hawaii and the House of Kamehameha. Its purpose is to promote and defend the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Until the reign of Kalakaua, this was the only Order instituted.

The Royal Order of Kamehameha I continues its work in observance and preservation of some native Hawaiian rituals and customs established by the leaders of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi. It is often consulted by the U.S. government, the state of Hawaiʻi, and Hawaiʻi&#x27;s county governments in native Hawaiian-sensitive rites performed at state functions.

====Hui Kālai&#x27;āina====

This organization existed before the overthrow to support a new constitution and was based in Honolulu.

====Hui Aloha &#x27;Āina====
A highly organized group formed in 1883 from the various islands with a name that reflected Hawaiian cultural beliefs.

====Liberal Patriotic Association====
The Liberal Patriotic Association was a rebel group formed by Robert William Wilcox to overturn the Bayonet Constitution. The faction was financed by Chinese businessmen who lost rights under the 1887 Constitution. The movement initiated what became known as the Wilcox Rebellion of 1889, ending in failure with seven dead and 70 captured.

====Home Rule Party of Hawaii====

After Hawaii&#x27;s annexation, Wilcox formed the Home Rule Party of Hawaii on June 6, 1900. The party was generally more radical than the Democratic Party of Hawaii. It dominated the Territorial Legislature between 1900 and 1902. But due to its radical and extreme philosophy of Hawaiian nationalism, infighting was prominent. This, in addition to its refusal to work with other parties, meant that it was unable to pass any legislation. After the 1902 election it steadily declined until disbanding in 1912.

====Democratic Party of Hawaii====

On April 30, 1900, John H. Wilson, John S. McGrew, Charles J. McCarthy, David Kawānanakoa, and Delbert Metzger established the Democratic Party of Hawaii. The party was generally more pragmatic than the Home Rule Party, and gained sponsorship from the American Democratic Party. It attempted to bring representation to Native Hawaiians in the territorial government and effectively lobbied to set aside under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920 for Hawaiians.

== Sovereignty and cultural rights organizations ==

=== ALOHA ===
The Aboriginal Lands of Hawaiian Ancestry (ALOHA) and the Principality of Aloha were organized sometime in the late 1960s or 1970s when Native Alaskan and American Indian activism was beginning. Native Hawaiians began organizing groups based on their own national interests such as ceded lands, free education, reparations payments, free housing, reform of the Hawaiian Homelands Act and development within the islands. According to Budnick, Louisa Rice established the group in 1969. Charles Kauluwehi Maxwell claims that it was organized in 1972.

ALOHA sought reparations for Native Hawaiians by hiring a former U.S. representative to write a bill that, while not ratified, did spawn a congressional study. The study was allowed only six months and was accused of relying on biased information from a historian hired by the territorial government that overthrew the kingdom as well as from U.S. Navy historians. The commission assigned to the study recommended against reparations.

=== Ka Lāhui ===
Ka Lāhui Hawaiʻi was formed in 1987 as a local grassroots initiative for Hawaiian sovereignty. Mililani Trask was its first leader. Trask was elected the first kia&#x27;aina (governor) of Ka Lahui. The organization has a constitution, elected offices and representatives for each island. The group supports federal recognition, independence from the United States, and inclusion of Native Hawaiians in federal Indian policy. It is considered the largest sovereignty movement group, reporting a membership of 21,000 in 1997. One of its goals is to reclaim ceded lands. In 1993, the group led 10,000 people on a march to the Iolani Palace on the 100th anniversary of the overthrow of Queen Liliuokalani.

Ka Lāhui and many sovereignty groups oppose the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2009 (known as the &quot;Akaka Bill&quot;) proposed by Senator Daniel Akaka, which begins the process of federal recognition of a Native Hawaiian government, with which the U.S. State Department would have government-to-government relations. The group believes that there are problems with the process and version of the bill. Still, Trask supported the original Akaka Bill and was a member of a group that crafted it. Trask has been critical of the bill&#x27;s 20-year limitation on all claims against the U.S., saying: &quot;We would not be able to address the illegal overthrow, address the breach of trust issues&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re looking at a terrible history... That history needs to be remedied.&quot; The organization was a part of UNPO from 1993 through 2012.

=== Ka Pākaukau ===

Ka Pākaukau leader Kekuni Blaisdell is a medical doctor and founding chair of the Department of Medicine at the University of Hawai&#x27;i John Burns School of Medicine who advocates for Hawaiian independence. The group began in the late 1980s as the Pā Kaukau coalition with the aim to supply information that could support the sovereignty and independence movement.

Blaisdell and the 12 groups that comprise the Ka Pākaukau believe in a &quot;nation-within-a-nation&quot; concept as a start to independence and are willing to negotiate with the President of the United States as &quot;representatives of our nation as co-equals&quot;.

In 1993, Blaisdell convened Ka Ho&#x27;okolokolonui Kanaka Maoli, the &quot;People&#x27;s International Tribunal&quot;, which brought indigenous leaders from around the world to Hawaii to put the U.S. government on trial for the theft of Hawaii&#x27;s sovereignty and other related violations of international law. The tribunal found the U.S. guilty, and published its findings in a lengthy document filed with the U.N. Committees on Human Rights and Indigenous Affairs.

=== Nation of Hawaiʻi ===

The Nation of Hawaiʻi is the oldest Hawaiian independence organization. Dennis Puʻuhonua &quot;Bumpy&quot; Kanahele is the group&#x27;s spokesperson and head of state. In contrast to other independence organizations that lean to the restoration of the monarchy, it advocates a republican government.

In 1989, the group occupied the area surrounding the Makapuʻu lighthouse on Oʻahu. In 1993, its members occupied Kaupo Beach, near Makapuʻu. Kanahele was a primary leader of the occupation. He is a descendant of Kamehameha I, 7 generations removed. The group ceased its occupation in exchange for the return of ceded lands in the adjacent community of Waimānalo, where it established a village, cultural center, and puʻuhonua (place of refuge).

Kanahele made headlines again in 1995 when his group gave sanctuary to Nathan Brown, a Native Hawaiian activist who had refused to pay federal taxes in protest against the U.S. presence in Hawaii. Kanahele was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to eight months in federal prison, along with a probation period in which he was barred from the puʻuhonua and participation in his sovereignty efforts.

In 2015, Kanahele portrayed himself in the movie &quot;Aloha&quot; filmed on location in Hawaii at Puʻuhonua o Waimanalo. This was followed by a 2017 episode of &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; titled &quot;Ka Laina Ma Ke One (Line in the Sand)&quot;.

=== Mauna Kea Anaina Hou ===
Kealoha Pisciotta is a former systems specialist for the joint British-Dutch-Canadian telescope who became concerned that a stone family shrine she had built for her grandmother and family was removed and found at a dump. She is one of several people who sued to stop the construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope and is the director of Mauna Kea Anaina Hou. Mauna Kea Anaina Hou (&quot;People who pray for the mountain&quot;,) and its sister group, Mauna Kea Hui, are indigenous Native Hawaiian cultural groups with environmental concerns in Hawaii. The group is described as a &quot;Native Hawaiian organization cultural and lineal descendants, and traditional, spiritual and religious practitioners of the sacred traditions of Mauna Kea.&quot;

The issue of cultural rights on the mountain was the focus of the documentary &quot;Mauna Kea—Temple Under Siege&quot;, which aired on PBS in 2006 and featured Pisciotta. The Hawaii State Constitution guarantees Native Hawaiians&#x27; religious and cultural rights. Many of Hawaii&#x27;s laws can be traced to Kingdom of Hawaii law. Hawaiʻi Revised Statute § 1-1 codifies Hawaiian custom and gives deference to native traditions. In the early 1970s, managers of Mauna Kea did not seem to pay much attention to Native Hawaiians&#x27; complaints about the mountain&#x27;s sacredness. Mauna Kea Anaina Hou, the Royal Order of Kamehameha I, and the Sierra Club united in opposition to the Keck&#x27;s proposal to add six outrigger telescopes.

=== Poka Laenui ===
Hayden Burgess, an attorney who goes by the Hawaiian name Poka Laenui, heads the Institute for the Advancement of Hawaiian Affairs. Laenui argues that because of the four international treaties with the U.S. government (1826, 1849, 1875, and 1883), the &quot;U.S. armed invasion and overthrow&quot; of the Hawaiian monarchy, a &quot;friendly government&quot;, was illegal in both American and international jurisprudence.

=== Protect Kahoolawe Ohana (PKO) ===

In 1976, Walter Ritte and the group &quot;Protect Kahoolawe Ohana&quot; (PKO) filed suit in U.S. federal court to stop the Navy&#x27;s use of Kahoolawe for bombardment training, to require compliance with a number of new environmental laws, and to ensure protection of cultural resources on the island. In 1977, the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii allowed the Navy&#x27;s use of this island to continue, but directed the Navy to prepare an environmental impact statement and complete an inventory of historic sites on the island.

The effort to regain Kahoʻolawe from the U.S. Navy inspired new political awareness and activism in the Hawaiian community. Charles Maxwell and other community leaders began to plan a coordinated effort to land on the island, which was still under Navy control. The effort for the &quot;first landing&quot; began in Waikapu (Maui) on January 5, 1976. Over 50 people from across the Hawaiian islands, including a range of cultural leaders, gathered on Maui with the goal of &quot;invading&quot; Kahoolawe on January 6, 1976. The date was selected because of its association with the U.S. bicentennial.

As the larger group headed toward the island, it was intercepted by military crafts. &quot;The Kahoʻolawe Nine&quot; continued and landed on the island. They were Ritte, Emmett Aluli, George Helm, Gail Kawaipuna Prejean, Stephen K. Morse, Kimo Aluli, Aunty Ellen Miles, Ian Lind, and Karla Villalba of the Puyallup/Muckleshoot tribe (Washington State). The effort to retake Kahoʻolawe eventually claimed the lives of Helm and Kimo Mitchell. Helm and Mitchell (who were accompanied by Billy Mitchell, no relation) ran into severe weather and were unable to reach Kahoʻolawe. Despite extensive rescue and recovery efforts, they were never recovered. Ritte became a leader in the Hawaiian community, coordinating community efforts including for water rights, opposition to land development, and the protection of marine animals and ocean resources. He now leads the effort to create state legislation requiring the labeling of genetically modified organisms in Hawaiʻi.

=== Hawaiian Kingdom ===
David Keanu Sai and Kamana Beamer are two Hawaiian scholars whose works use international law to argue for the rights of a Hawaiian Kingdom existing today and call for an end to U.S. occupation of the islands. Trained as a U.S. military officer, Sai uses the title of chairman of the Acting Council of Regency of the &quot;Hawaiian Kingdom&quot; organization. He has done extensive historical research, especially on the treaties between Hawaii and other nations, and on military occupation and the laws of war. Sai teaches Hawaiian studies at Windward Community College.

Sai claimed to represent the Hawaiian Kingdom in &quot;Larsen v. Hawaiian Kingdom&quot;, a case brought before the World Court&#x27;s Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague in 2000. Although Sai and Lance Paul Larsen agreed to the arbitration, with Larsen suing Sai for not protecting his rights as a Hawaiian Kingdom subject, his actual goal was to have U.S. rule in Hawaii declared a breach of mutual treaty obligations and international law. The case&#x27;s arbiters affirmed that there was no dispute they could decide, because the U.S. was not a party to the arbitration. As stated in the award from the arbitration panel, &quot;in the absence of the United States of America, the Tribunal can neither decide that Hawaii is not part of the USA, nor proceed on the assumption that it is not. To take either course would be to disregard a principle which goes to heart of the arbitral function in international law.&quot;

In a 2000 arbitration hearing before the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the Hawaiian flag was raised at the same height at and alongside other countries. But the court accepts arbitration from private entities, and a hearing before it does not mean international recognition.

=== Hawaiian Kingdom Government ===
About 70 members of one separatist group, the &quot;Hawaiian Kingdom Government&quot;, which claimed about 1,000 members in 2008, chained the gates and blocked the entrance to Iolani Palace for about two hours, disrupting tours on April 30, 2008. The incident ended without violence or arrests. Led by Mahealani Kahau, who has taken the title of queen, and Jessica Wright, who has taken the title of princess, it has been meeting daily to conduct &quot;government business&quot; and demand sovereignty for Hawaii and restoration of the monarchy. It negotiated rights to be on the lawn of the grounds during regular hours normally open to the public by applying for a public-assembly permit. Kahau said that &quot;protest&quot; and &quot;sovereignty group&quot; mischaracterize the group, but that it is a seat of government.

== Reaction ==
In 1993, the State of Hawaiʻi adopted Act 359 &quot;to acknowledge and recognize the unique status the native Hawaiian people bear to the State of Hawaii and to the United States and to facilitate the efforts of native Hawaiians to be governed by an indigenous sovereign nation of their own choosing.&quot; The act created the Hawaiian Sovereignty Advisory Committee to provide guidance with &quot;(1) Conducting special elections related to this Act; (2) Apportioning voting districts; (3) Establishing the eligibility of convention delegates; (4) Conducting educational activities for Hawaiian voters, a voter registration drive, and research activities in preparation for the convention; (5) Establishing the size and composition of the convention delegation; and (6) Establishing the dates for the special election. Act 200 amended Act 359 establishing the Hawaiʻi Sovereignty Elections Council&quot;.

Those involved with the Advisory Committee forums believed that the question of the political status for Native Hawaiians has become difficult. But in 2000, a panel of the committee stated that Native Hawaiians have maintained a unique community. Federal and state programs have been designated to improve Native Hawaiians&#x27; conditions, including health, education, employment and training, children&#x27;s services, conservation programs, fish and wildlife protection, agricultural programs, and native language immersion programs. Congress created the Hawaiian Homes Commission (HHC) in 1921. The Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) was the result of a 1978 amendment to the Hawaiʻi State Constitution and controls over $1 billion from the Ceded Lands Trust, spending millions to address Native Hawaiians&#x27; needs. Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation Executive Director Mahealani Kamauʻu has said that only in the last 25 years have Native Hawaiians &quot;had a modicum of political empowerment and been able to exercise direct responsibility for their own affairs, that progress has been made in so many areas&quot;. These programs have opposition and critics who believe they are ineffective and badly managed.

=== The Apology Bill and the Akaka Bill ===

Native Hawaiians&#x27; growing frustration over Hawaiian homelands and the 100th anniversary of the overthrow pushed the Hawaiian sovereignty movement to the forefront of politics in Hawaii. In 1993, President Bill Clinton signed United States Public Law 103-150, known as the &quot;Apology Bill&quot;, for U.S. involvement in the 1893 overthrow. The bill makes a commitment to reconciliation.

U.S. census information shows approximately 401,162 Native Hawaiians living in the U.S. in 2000. Sixty percent live in the continental U.S. and forty percent in Hawaii. Between 1990 and 2000, people identifying as Native Hawaiian had grown by 90,000, while those identifying as pure Hawaiian had declined to under 10,000.

In 2009, Senator Daniel Akaka sponsored The Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2009 (S1011/HR2314), a bill to create the legal framework to establish a Hawaiian government. President Barack Obama supported the bill. The bill is considered a reconciliation process, but it has not had that effect, instead being the subject of much controversy and political fighting in many arenas. American opponents argue that Congress is disregarding U.S. citizens for special interests and sovereignty activists believe this will further erode their rights, as the 1921 blood quantum rule of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act did. In 2011, a governor-appointed committee began to gather and verify Native Hawaiians&#x27; names for the purpose of voting on a Native Hawaiian nation.

In June 2014, the US Department of the Interior announced plans to hold hearings to establish the possibility of federal recognition of Native Hawaiians as an Indian tribe.

=== Opposition ===
There has also been opposition to the concept of ancestry-based sovereignty, which critics maintain is tantamount to racial exclusion. In 1996, in &quot;Rice v. Cayetano&quot;, one Big Island rancher sued to win the right to vote in OHA elections, asserting that every Hawaiian citizen regardless of racial background should be able to vote for state offices, and that limiting the vote to Native Hawaiians is racist. In 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in his favor, and OHA elections are now open to all registered voters. In its decision, the court wrote: &quot;the ancestral inquiry mandated by the State is forbidden by the Fifteenth Amendment for the further reason that the use of racial classifications is corruptive of the whole legal order democratic elections seek to preserve...Distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality&quot;.

=== Proposed United States federal recognition of Native Hawaiians ===
The year of hearings found most speakers with strong opposition to the U.S. government&#x27;s involvement in Hawaiian sovereignty, with opponents arguing that tribal recognition of Native Hawaiians is not a legitimate path to Hawaiian nationhood and that the U.S. government should not be involved in reestablishing Hawaiian sovereignty.

On September 29, 2015, the United States Department of the Interior announced a procedure to recognize a Native Hawaiian government. The Native Hawaiian Roll Commission was created to find and register Native Hawaiians. The nine-member commission has prepared a roll of registered individuals of Hawaiian heritage.

The nonprofit organization &quot;Naʻi Aupuni&quot; will organize the constitutional convention and election of delegates using the roll, which began collecting names in 2011. Grassroot Institute of Hawaii CEO Kelii Akina filed suit to see the names on the roll, won, and found serious flaws. The Native Hawaiian Roll Commission has since purged the list of names of deceased persons as well as those whose mailing or email addresses could not be verified.

Akina again filed suit to stop the election because funding of the project comes from a grant from the Office of Hawaiian Affairs and because of a Supreme Court decision prohibiting states from conducting race-based elections. In October 2015, a federal judge declined to stop the process. The case was appealed with a formal emergency request to stop the voting until the appeal was heard; the request was denied. On November 24, the emergency request was made again to Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. On November 27, Kennedy stopped the election tallying and naming of delegates. The decision did not stop the voting itself, and a spokesman for the Naʻi Aupuni continued to encourage those eligible to vote before the November 30, 2015, deadline.

The election was expected to cost about $150,000, and voting was carried out by Elections America, a firm based in Washington, D.C. The constitutional convention has an estimated cost of $2.6 million.

<text>David Andrew McCarty (November 23, 1969 – April 19, 2024) was an American first baseman and outfielder in Major League Baseball. From 1993 through 2005, McCarty played with the Minnesota Twins (1993–1995), San Francisco Giants (1995–1996), Seattle Mariners (1998), Kansas City Royals (2000–2002), Tampa Bay Devil Rays (2002), Oakland Athletics (2003) and Boston Red Sox (2003–2005). He batted right-handed and threw left-handed.

==Career==
Born in Houston, Texas, McCarty graduated from Sharpstown High School in 1988. He attended Stanford University to play college baseball for the Stanford Cardinal. In 1989, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League.

The Minnesota Twins of Major League Baseball (MLB) selected McCarty in the first round, with the third overall selection, of the 1991 MLB draft. He made his MLB debut on May 17, 1993. In 1995, the Twins traded McCarty to the Cincinnati Reds for John Courtright.

On July 21, 1995, the Reds traded McCarty, Deion Sanders, Ricky Pickett, John Roper, and Scott Service to the San Francisco Giants for Dave Burba, Darren Lewis, and Mark Portugal. Before the 1998 season, the Seattle Mariners acquired McCarty from the Giants for Jalal Leach and Scott Smith.

On August 4, 2003, McCarty was claimed off waivers by the Boston Red Sox from the Oakland Athletics.

===2004 highlights===
On May 11, 2004, in the bottom of the eighth inning, original pinch-hitter Brian Daubach was called back to the bench after the Indians made a pitching change and decided to go to lefty Scott Stewart. McCarty, due to hitting well against lefties, was sent up to hit by manager Terry Francona. On an 0-1 pitch, McCarty lined a two-run triple to right field that gave the Red Sox a 5-3 lead. They went on to win by that score.
On May 30, 2004, McCarty, who had entered the game in the eighth inning, hit a walk-off two-run home run against Mariners pitcher J. J. Putz in the bottom of the twelfth inning to give the Red Sox a 9-7 victory.

McCarty also made three pitching appearances in 2004. The first one was in the home opener on April 9 vs the Blue Jays, the second one was on June 12 vs the Dodgers, in which he struck out Jayson Werth and the final one was in the final game of the regular season against the Orioles, in which he struck out Rafael Palmeiro, Larry Bigbie and David Newhan.

==Release and retirement==
The Red Sox released McCarty in May 2005 after the team signed first baseman John Olerud. He retired and was a Red Sox analyst on NESN from July 1, 2005, until the end of the 2008 season.

==Personal life and death==
McCarty lived in Piedmont, California, with his wife, novelist Monica McCarty, and their two children.

McCarty died following a cardiac event in Oakland, California, on April 19, 2024, at the age of 54.

<text>Count Boris Petrovich Sheremetev (; – ) was a Russian diplomat and general field marshal during the Great Northern War. He became the first Russian count in 1706. His children included Pyotr Sheremetev and Natalia Sheremeteva.

==Early life==
In his youth, Sheremetyev was a page to Tsar Alexis I before starting his military career. From 1671 he served at the imperial court. In 1681 he was a leader at Tambov, commanding the armies fighting the Crimean Khanate, and from 1682 he was a boyar. From 1685 to 1687 he participated in negotiations and the conclusion of the &quot;Eternal Peace of 1686&quot; with Poland and the allied treaty with Austria. From the end of 1687 he commanded the armies in Belgorod defending Russia&#x27;s southern border, and participated in the Crimean campaigns. 
After Peter I gained power in 1689, he joined him as a fellow campaigner. He participated along with Mazepa in the war against Turkey during the 1690s. During the Azov campaigns in 1695–96 he commanded armies on the Dnieper River in actions against the Crimean Tatars. In 1697–99 he carried out diplomatic assignments in Poland, Austria, Italy and Malta. In 1698, czar Peter sent a delegation to Malta under Sheremetyev to observe the training and abilities of the Knights of Malta and their fleet. Sheremetyev also investigated the possibility of future joint ventures with the Knights, including action against the Turks and the possibility of a future Russian naval base.

==Great Northern War==

During the Great Northern War (1700–1721) Sheremetev proved a capable but cautious and sluggish military leader. For much of the war he served as the commander-in-chief and most senior officer in the Russian army. Sheremetev was very cautious in his movements but proved more effective than the younger Prince Menshikov, the second-in-command, whose impulsiveness did not always lead to success.

In 1700 he joined the Russian army in its attack on Narva at the outbreak of the Great Northern War, but King Charles XII of Sweden drove him back from his position in Estonia. He then became commander of the Russian forces fighting the Swedish armies in the Baltic provinces. Colonel W. A. Schlippenbach defeated Sheremetev at Rauge in September 1701, but the Russians turned the tables on Schlippenbach (now a Major-General) at Erastfer in December 1701. This victory won Sheremetev the title of field marshal, and another Russian victory ensued at the battle of Hummelshof in July 1702. Sheremetev&#x27;s army&#x27;s attack on Marienburg (August 1702) led to Martha Skavronskaya coming to the tsar&#x27;s court, where she eventually became Empress Catherine I (reigned 1725–1727).

Sheremetev took the Swedish Ingrian fortresses of Nöteborg (October 1702) and Nyenskans (1 May 1703) (allowing the foundation of the city of Saint Petersburg later in May 1703)) and the important Baltic cities Dorpat and Narva in 1704. In 1705 Peter I sent him to Astrakhan, where he forcefully and successfully repressed the of 1705–1706.

In the course of the Great Northern War, Sheremetev clashed with the Swedish general Lewenhaupt, who beat him at Gemäuerthof in July 1705, and Charles XII, who defeated him at Holowczyn (July 1708). Sheremetev&#x27;s revenge came at the Battle of Poltava in 1709, where he functioned as the senior Russian commander of the forces which soundly defeated the Swedish army. Armies under his command conquered Riga in 1710. Sheremetev then led the main forces of the army against the Ottomans in the Prut campaign of 1710–1711. Fighting against Turkey in 1711, he suffered encirclement at the Battle of Stănileşti on the Prut (July 1711). In 1715–17 Sheremetev commanded armies in Pomerania and in Mecklenburg.

Although sympathetic to Peter I&#x27;s policy of Westernising Russia, Sheremetev never became close to the tsar. He died in 1719 in Moscow; Peter I had him buried in the Lazarevskoe Cemetery in St. Petersburg.

<doc id="850264" wikidata="Q2906981" url="?curid=850264" title="Bloodaxe (character)">
<text>Bloodaxe (Jackie Lukus) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is usually depicted as a foe of Thor and Thunderstrike. This character first appeared in &quot;Thor&quot; #449, though she did not adopt her name and appearance until #450. The name also applies to the axe used by this character.

Bloodaxe&#x27;s identity was initially a mystery; all early panels of the character&#x27;s alter ego were depicted as being concealed by shadow or as a silhouette. Due to the sheer muscular mass of Bloodaxe (a direct result of the Asgardian magic within the axe), it was also impossible to determine whether the mortal alias was even male or female. Many supporting cast members of Thunderstrike were hinted at being Bloodaxe but many of those clues would later turn out to be red herrings to conceal &#x27;his&#x27; true identity. It was only after Bloodaxe was defeated that the mortal alias was revealed to be Jackie Lukus, a confidant and love interest of Thunderstrike&#x27;s alias Eric Masterson.

==Fictional character biography==
A figure in shadow found the axe once wielded by Skurge the Executioner, and in picking it up was transformed by its magic into a superhuman being. This new being then went into action as Bloodaxe, battling the police and slaying drug dealers.

Bloodaxe first fought Thor when the mortal Eric Masterson was using the identity of Thor. Bloodaxe then battled Doctor Strange, and encountered Susan Austin. He then fought and Earth Force.

When the real Thor returned, Masterson became Thunderstrike and fought Bloodaxe again. Bloodaxe first encountered Thunderstrike when she arrived to kill a low-level villain called Carjack and his gang. Thunderstrike thwarted Bloodaxe and took custody of the axe.

Thunderstrike later defeated Bloodaxe and succumbed to the axe&#x27;s will in an attempt to obtain more power to defeat an even more powerful villain, Set the Serpent God of Death. After Set was destroyed, Thunderstrike was possessed by the axe&#x27;s murderous curse. As no-one was able to stop his rampage, Masterson chose to sacrifice himself in order to destroy the Bloodaxe forever.

The axe was then re-introduced during Dan Jurgens&#x27; Thor run, where it was used by Thor in conjunction with Mjolnir. Thor later destroyed it with the Odinforce after he felt the curse beginning to work on him.

==Powers and abilities==
By wielding the Executioner&#x27;s enchanted Asgardian axe, its wielder is transformed into the superhuman Bloodaxe, increasing the wielder&#x27;s size and mass while flooding the body with magical energy. Bloodaxe was endowed with superhuman strength, speed, durability, reflexes, and endurance by enchantments on the axe. The evil that remained within the axe also takes partial possession of the wielder&#x27;s mind, warping its personality and making it murderously aggressive, overpowering its rationality with a lust for combat, vengeance, and bloodshed. Bloodaxe was invulnerable to conventional firearms, and incendiary or ballistic devices.

Bloodaxe&#x27;s double-bladed axe was mystically enchanted and virtually indestructible, and can be used to deflect bullets. Thanks to enchantments from the Enchantress, the axe had the magical ability to create dimensional rifts. It could be used to teleport to places the wielder has previously been, project fire or ice energy, concussive bolts of Asgardian mystical force, and hurricane winds. However, if the user was separated from the axe for more than 60 seconds, they would lose their enchanted form and revert to their original mortal identity, much like the enchantment once placed on Mjolnir by Odin.

==Other versions==

===Bloodaxe 2099===
Bloodaxe was also a name taken by a minor &quot;Spider-Man 2099&quot; villain, who also called himself Bloodmace, Bloodsword and Bloodhammer, depending on what kind of weapon he was holding at the time.

<text>The Ford CD3 platform (for &quot;C/D-class&quot;) is a Ford midsize car automobile platform. It was designed by Mazda. The platform is designed for either front, all-wheel drive or Ford&#x27;s hybrid powertrain.

The platform is based on a unitized welded steel body (monocoque) with an independent short long arms (SLA) double wishbone front suspension with stabilizer bar and an independent multi-link twist blade rear suspension with stabilizer bar.

Ford Motor Company uses the CD3 platform design from the Mazda partnership as its first fully &quot;digital&quot; car, allowing the company to cut months of development time, saving money and bringing the vehicles to market more quickly. Engineers were able to virtually build an entire car prior to initiating construction, thereby improving vehicle fit and finish, tool clearances and production line ergonomics.

<text>Raghad Saddam Hussein (; born 2 September 1968) is an Iraqi exiled politician and the eldest daughter of former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein.

== Biography ==
Raghad Hussein was married in 1983 to Hussein Kamel al-Majid, her cousin who later defected in 1995 and shared government weapons secrets with UNSCOM, the CIA and MI6. Hussein Kamel was killed in 1996 along with his brother Saddam Kamel, allegedly by fellow clan members who declared them traitors. Saddam Hussein had allegedly made it clear that although he had pardoned both Hussein Kamel and his brother, they would lose all status, and would not receive any protection.

Raghad Hussein had five children with Hussein Kamel: three sons, Ali, Saddam and Wahej; and two daughters, Hareer and Banan.

In 2003, Raghad and many prominent Iraqi Baathists fled to Jordan where King Abdullah II gave her personal protection.

On July 2, 2006, the Iraqi government&#x27;s national security advisor Muwaffaq al-Rubaie declared that Raghad and her mother were wanted because they supported the insurgency in Iraq. The Jordanian Prime Minister, Marouf al-Bakhit, made a statement that &quot;Raghad was under the royal family&#x27;s protection,&quot; and &quot;the presence of Mrs. Raghad Saddam Hussein and her children in Jordan is motivated by humanitarian considerations. She is the guest of the Hashemite royal family (of King Abdullah II), and under its protection as a seeker of asylum in accordance with Arab tradition&quot;. Her exact location, however, has not been disclosed.

On December 30, 2006, Saddam Hussein was executed in Iraq. Prior to the execution, Raghad Hussein asked for her father&#x27;s body to be temporarily buried in Yemen, until coalition forces are expelled from Iraq.

In February 2021, she appeared in a six-part televised interview on &quot;Al Arabiya&quot; in her first media appearance in years. She discussed her memories, family matters, and her willingness to eventually return to Iraq and play a political role, which created some diplomatic tensions in the region and controversy amongst public opinion in Iraq.

As of 2023, Raghad Hussein still lives in Jordan since leaving Iraq in 2003.

==Arrest warrant==
In August 2007, the international police agency Interpol announced that it had circulated an arrest warrant for Hussein, on suspicions that she and her aides had been assisting the insurgency in Iraq. These suspicions were reflected in an August 2014 article in &quot;Spiegel Online&quot;, which proposed the title &quot;Terror Godmother&quot;. The article reports that, while living in opulence in Jordan, Hussein&#x27;s fortune in the double-digit millions is used to support the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), with the ultimate goal of returning to regain power in Baghdad. Earlier in June, Fox News Channel had quoted such an intention expressed by Hussein in an interview she had given.

Hussein is listed on Iraq&#x27;s most wanted list of individuals alongside 59 others. It also features 28 ISIL fighters, 12 from Al-Qaeda and 20 from the Baath party, giving details of the roles they play in their organisations, the crimes of which they are suspected, and, in most cases, photographs. , she was still living in Amman, but wished to return to Iraq.

On 22 October 2023, a court in Baghdad sentenced her in absentia to seven years in prison for promoting activities of the outlawed Baath party during her television interviews in 2021.

<doc id="850278" wikidata="Q339065" url="?curid=850278" title="Beggars Banquet">
<text>Beggars Banquet is the seventh British and ninth American studio album by English rock band the Rolling Stones, released on 6 December 1968 by Decca Records in the United Kingdom and by London Records in the United States. It was the first Rolling Stones album produced by Jimmy Miller, whose production work formed a key aspect of the group&#x27;s sound throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Brian Jones, the band&#x27;s co-founder and early leader, had become increasingly unreliable in the studio due to his drug use, and it was the last Rolling Stones album to be released during his lifetime, though he also contributed to two songs on their next album &quot;Let It Bleed&quot;, which was released after his death (Jones also contributed to the group&#x27;s hit song &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot;, which was part of the same sessions, and released in May 1968). Nearly all rhythm and lead guitar parts were recorded by Keith Richards, the Rolling Stones&#x27; other guitarist and the primary songwriting partner of their lead singer Mick Jagger; together the two wrote all but one of the tracks on the album. Rounding out the instrumentation were bassist Bill Wyman and drummer Charlie Watts, though all members contributed on a variety of instruments. As with most albums of the period, frequent collaborator Nicky Hopkins played piano on many of the tracks.

&quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; marked a change in direction for the band following the psychedelic pop of their previous two albums, &quot;Between the Buttons&quot; and &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;. Styles such as roots rock and a return to the blues rock sound that had marked early Stones recordings dominate the record, and the album is among the most instrumentally experimental of the band&#x27;s career, as they use Latin beats and instruments like the claves alongside South Asian sounds from the tanpura, tabla and shehnai, and African music-influenced conga rhythms.

&quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; was a top-ten album in many markets, including a number 5 position in the US—where it has been certified platinum—and a number 3 position in the band&#x27;s native UK. It received a highly favourable response from music critics, who deemed it a return to form. While the album lacked a major hit single at the time of its release, songs such as &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; and &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; (U.S. Billboard number 48) became rock radio staples for decades to come. The album has appeared on many lists of the greatest albums of all time, including by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999.

==Recording and production==
Glyn Johns, the album&#x27;s recording engineer and a longtime collaborator of the band, said that &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; signalled &quot;the Rolling Stones&#x27; coming of age. ... I think that the material was far better than anything they&#x27;d ever done before. The whole mood of the record was far stronger to me musically.&quot; Producer Jimmy Miller described guitarist Keith Richards as &quot;a real workhorse&quot; while recording the album, mostly due to the infrequent presence of Brian Jones. When he did show up at the sessions, Jones behaved erratically due to his drug use and emotional problems. Miller said that Jones would &quot;show up occasionally when he was in the mood to play, and he could never really be relied on:

Jones contributed to eight tracks on the album, playing sitar and tanpura on &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot;, slide guitar on &quot;No Expectations&quot;, harmonica on &quot;Parachute Woman&quot;, &quot;Dear Doctor&quot; and &quot;Prodigal Son&quot;, acoustic guitar and backing vocals on &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;, and Mellotron on &quot;Jigsaw Puzzle&quot; and &quot;Stray Cat Blues&quot;. In a television interview, Mick Jagger recalled that Jones&#x27; slide guitar performance on &quot;No Expectations&quot; was the last time he contributed something &quot;of significance&quot; to the band. Other than Jones, the principal band members appeared extensively, with Richards providing nearly all of the lead and rhythm guitar work, as well as playing bass on two others, in the place of Bill Wyman, who appears on the rest. Drummer Charlie Watts plays the drum kit on all but two tracks, as well as other percussion on the tracks that do not feature a full drum kit. Additional parts were played by keyboardist and frequent Rolling Stones collaborator Nicky Hopkins and percussionist Rocky Dijon, among others.

The basic track of &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; was recorded on an early Philips cassette deck at London&#x27;s Olympic Sound Studios, where Richards played a Gibson Hummingbird acoustic guitar, and Watts played on an antique, portable practice drum kit. &quot;Prodigal Son&quot;, a cover of Robert Wilkins&#x27;s Biblical blues song, was originally credited as a Jagger/Richards composition on initial pressings of the album, but was subsequently corrected on later pressings.

Celebrating the completion of the album, Jagger held a party at Vesuvio&#x27;s nightclub in Central London. Paul McCartney attended with an acetate copy of &quot;Hey Jude&quot;. The song upstaged &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; and, in author John Winn&#x27;s description, &quot;reportedly ruin[ed]&quot; the party.

== Packaging ==
According to Keith Richards, the album&#x27;s title was thought up by British art dealer Christopher Gibbs. The album&#x27;s original front and back cover art, photographs by Barry Feinstein depicting a bathroom wall covered with graffiti, was rejected by the band&#x27;s record company, which delayed the album&#x27;s release for months. Feinstein&#x27;s photographs were later featured though on most vinyl, compact disc and cassette tape reissues of the album. On 7 June 1968, a photoshoot for the album&#x27;s gatefold, with photographer Michael Joseph, was held at Sarum Chase, a mansion in Hampstead, London. Previously unseen images from the shoot were exhibited at the Blink Gallery in London in November and December 2008.

== Release and promotion ==
&quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; was first released in the United Kingdom by Decca Records on 6 December 1968, and in the United States by London Records the following day. Like the band&#x27;s previous album, it reached number three on the UK Albums Chart, but remained on the chart for fewer weeks. The album peaked at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

On 11–12 December 1968 the band filmed a television extravaganza titled &quot;The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus&quot; featuring John Lennon, Keith Richards, Eric Clapton, The Who, Jethro Tull and Marianne Faithfull among the musical guests. One of the original aims of the project was to promote &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;, but the film was shelved by the Rolling Stones until 1996, when their former manager, Allen Klein, gave it an official release.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; received a highly favourable response from music critics, who considered it a return to form for the Stones. Author Stephen Davis writes of its impact: &quot;[The album was] a sharp reflection of the convulsive psychic currents coursing through the Western world. Nothing else captured the youthful spirit of Europe in 1968 like &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;.&quot;

According to music journalist Anthony DeCurtis, the &quot;political correctness&quot; of &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot;, particularly the lyrics &quot;What can a poor boy do/&#x27;Cept sing in a rock and roll band&quot;, sparked intense debate in the underground media. In the description of author and critic Ian MacDonald, French director Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s filming of the sessions for &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; contributed to the band&#x27;s image as &quot;Left Bank heroes of the European Maoist underground&quot;, with the song&#x27;s &quot;Luciferian iconoclasm&quot; interpreted as a political message.

&quot;Time&quot; described the Stones as &quot;England&#x27;s most subversive roisterers since Fagin&#x27;s gang in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;&quot; and added: &quot;In keeping with a widespread mood in the pop world, &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; turns back to the raw vitality of Negro R&amp;B and the authentic simplicity of country music.&quot; Jann Wenner of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; considered that the band&#x27;s regeneration marked the return of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll, while the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; declared: &quot;The Stones have unleashed their rawest, rudest, most arrogant, most savage record yet. And it&#x27;s beautiful.&quot;

Less impressed, the writer of &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s initial review dismissed &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; as &quot;mediocre&quot; and said that, since &quot;The Stones are Mick Jagger&quot;, it was only the singer&#x27;s &quot;remarkable recording presence that makes this LP&quot;. Geoffrey Cannon of &quot;The Guardian&quot; found that the album &quot;demonstrates [the group&#x27;s] primal power at its greatest strength&quot; and wrote admiringly of Jagger&#x27;s ability to fully engage the listener on &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;, saying: &quot;We feel horror because, at full volume, he makes us ride his carrier wave with him, experience his sensations, and awaken us to ours.&quot; In his ballot for &quot;Jazz &amp; Pop&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual critics poll, Robert Christgau ranked it as the third-best album of the year, and &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; the best pop song of the year. In April 1969, for &quot;Esquire&quot;, he wrote that &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; is &quot;unflawed and lacking something&quot;, in contrast to the Beatles&#x27; latest, &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, which &quot;is flawed and great anyway.&quot;

=== Reappraisal ===

In a retrospective review for &quot;Wondering Sound&quot;, Ben Fong-Torres called &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; &quot;an album flush with masterful and growling instant classics&quot;, and said that it &quot;responds more to the chaos of &#x27;68 and to themselves than to any fellow artists ... the mood is one of dissolution and resignation, in the guise of a voice of an ambivalent authority.&quot; Colin Larkin, in his &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; (2006), viewed the album as &quot;a return to strength&quot; which included &quot;the socio-political &#x27;Street Fighting Man&#x27; and the brilliantly macabre &#x27;Sympathy for the Devil&#x27;, in which Jagger&#x27;s seductive vocal was backed by hypnotic Afro-rhythms and dervish yelps&quot;. Writing for MusicHound in 1999, Greg Kot opined that the same two songs were the &quot;weakest cuts&quot;, adding: &quot;Otherwise, the disc is a tour de force of acoustic-tinged savagery and slumming sexuality, particularly the gleefully flippant &#x27;Stray Cat Blues.&#x27;&quot; Larry Katz from the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; called &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; &quot;both a return to basics and leap forward&quot;.

In his 1997 review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, DeCurtis said the album was &quot;filled with distinctive and original touches&quot;, and remarked on its legacy: &quot;For the album, the Stones had gone to great lengths to toughen their sound and banish the haze of psychedelia, and in doing so, they launched a five-year period in which they would produce their very greatest records.&quot; Author Martin C. Strong similarly considers &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; to be the first album in the band&#x27;s &quot;staggering burst of creativity&quot; over 1968–72 that ultimately comprised four of the best rock albums of all time. Writing in 2007, Daryl Easlea of BBC Music said that, although in places it fails to maintain the quality of its opening song, &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; represented the Rolling Stones at their sharpest.

&quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; has appeared on professional listings of the greatest albums. It was included in the &quot;Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981). In 2000, it was voted number 282 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2003, it was ranked at number 57 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, ranked at number 58 in a 2012 revised list, and ranked at number 185 in a 2020 revised list. Also in 2003, the TV network VH1 named &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; the 67th greatest album of all time. The album is also featured in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 1999, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Reissues==
In August 2002, ABKCO Records reissued &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; as a newly remastered LP and SACD/CD hybrid disk. This release corrected a flaw in the original album by restoring each song to its proper, slightly faster speed. Due to an error in the mastering, &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; was heard for over thirty years at a slower speed than it was recorded. This had the effect of altering not only the tempo of each song, but the song&#x27;s key as well. These differences were subtle but important, and the remastered version is about 30 seconds shorter than the original release. 
Also in 2002 the Russian label CD-Maximum unofficially released the limited edition &quot;Beggars Banquet + 7 Bonus&quot;, which was also bootlegged on a German counterfeit-DECCA label as &quot;Beggars Banquet (the Mono Beggars)&quot;.
It was released once again in 2010 by Universal Music Enterprises in a Japanese-only SHM-SACDversion and on 24 November 2010 ABKCO Records released a SHM-CD version.

On 28 May 2013 ABKCO Records reissued the LP on vinyl.

In 2018, the album was reissued for its 50th anniversary.

&quot;Record Store Day Edition&quot; appeared on the British market on Saturday, 22 April 2023.

<text>Polyhedron (formerly Polyhedron Newszine) was a magazine targeting consumers of role-playing games, and originally the official publication of the RPGA (Role Playing Gamers Association).

==1981 to 2002==
Publication of the Role Playing Gamers Association magazine began in the year 1981, targeting players of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; roleplaying game. Articles were written by gamers for other gamers in the style of the &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine, and information was included on RPGA membership and events. The magazine was nominally quarterly from May, 1981 through February, 1982; bimonthly from April, 1983 through May, 1991; and monthly from June, 1991 through November, 1996; publication then ceased until October, 1997, and thereafter was bi-monthly (with some irregularity) through May, 2003; finally it was again monthly from June, 2003 until the final issue in August, 2004. For several years it was available only to RPGA members; for some, joining the RPGA essentially amounted to a subscription to &quot;Polyhedron&quot;. &quot;Polyhedron&quot; was produced by members of the RPGA, including some professionals working in the game industry, and was intended for RPGA members.

The magazine was initially referred to as the &quot;RPGA Newsletter&quot; (or RPGA News) inside the cover of the initial 4 issues and the title read &quot;TSR RPGA&quot; on the cover. Starting with Issue 4 (p3) the new title &quot;The Polyhedron&quot; would be used. From issue 5 through 9 the covers were titled with &quot;The Polyhedron&quot; and from issue 10 onward as &quot;Polyhedron Newszine&quot;.

The masthead lists several formal publishers (occasionally omitting this information) including E. Gary Gygax (Issues 1-11); Kim Eastland (12-15); Mike Cook (irregularly 32-50); Jack Beuttell (51-68); Rick Behling (69-76 and 91-111); James Ward (77-90); TSR (112-141); Wizards of the Coast (irregularly 142-149); and Paizo (153 onward). Notable editors include Frank Mentzer (1-4); Mary Kirchoff (5-21); Penny Petticord (22-31); Skip Williams (33, 34, 37, 39); Jean Rabe (36, 38, 40-103); Dave Gross (104-107); Duane Maxwell (107-118); Jeff Quick (122-134); and Erik Mona (138 onward). Two special issues were also published—an Introductory Issue (Jean Rabe, 1989) that was sent thereafter to new RPGA members, and a Gen Con Issue (Sean Glenn, 1999) that was distributed only at that year&#x27;s Gen Con. The magazine&#x27;s publication was fairly erratic and the contents very uneven until Jean Rabe&#x27;s period as editor where the magazine was put on a regular schedule and contents were developed into recurring topical columns and monthly themed materials. Rabe also strengthened the quality of content and applied more rigorous editing to articles which had previously tended to be somewhat amateurish and personal. During this time also, cover art improved markedly and, notably, focused on strongly presented (and fully clothed) female adventurers. Rabe also converted the magazine from bi-monthly to monthly.

Pagination of &quot;Polyhedron&quot; is problematic, because often (but not always) the mailing wrapper (generally containing printed matter) was counted in the pagination, and often (but not always) the cover was counted in the pagination as well. Given this, the magazine generally was 16-20 pages in length for issues 1-8; 32-36 pages in length for issues 9-128; and 32-48 pages in length for issues 131-143 (at this point, the magazine started to carry advertisements). From issue 144 onwards page counts became fairly variable but generally ran near to either 60 or 40 pages. Polyhedron featured several notable cover styles, including black and white art on issues 1-39; a single-colored left-hand stripe with hexes on issues 40-51; a single colored cover (retaining the hex stripe) from issues 52-74; single color cover with a cluster of hexes in the top-left corner on issues 78-119; increasingly variable covers on 120-143; and full-glossy covers from 144 onwards. Collectors should note that the magazine was serially issued but also published in volumes and numbers for issues 1-148 and then again for issue 161. However, the volume and numbers printed in the magazine frequently were wrong (at least fifteen errors are known during the 148 issues); the issue number should be taken as authoritative.

==2002 to 2004==
In September, 2002, Paizo Publishing acquired publishing rights and merged the &quot;Polyhedron&quot; magazine with the sister publication &quot;Dungeon&quot; to form a single magazine (issue 90 of &quot;Dungeon&quot; and issue 149 of &quot;Polyhedron&quot; were one and the same magazine, and this dual numbering continued throughout this period). This ended the association of &quot;Polyhedron&quot; with the RPGA. It also marked a major change in the magazine&#x27;s focus, from a primarily &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;-oriented magazine similar to &quot;Dragon&quot; to a general d20 system magazine that often featured entirely new, simple role-playing games based on this system, along with support for non-D&amp;D d20 games such as d20 Modern. Eventually another formerly separate magazine, the &quot;Living Greyhawk Journal&quot;, briefly became a section in &quot;Polyhedron&quot; as well.

Though this version of &quot;Polyhedron&quot; had many vocal supporters, sales were poor, a situation many blamed on putting two magazines with distinct target audiences together in one somewhat higher-priced package. The &quot;Polyhedron&quot; section was removed from &quot;Dungeon&quot; as part of a major revamp of the latter magazine in 2004 and &quot;Polyhedron&quot; is no longer published in any form.

==2005==
From March to November, 2005, Wizards of the Coast used the name &quot;Polyhedron&quot; for a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; email newsletter with links pointing to content on their website. The newsletter typically contained product reviews and announcements and a cartoon.

==Reception==
&quot;Polyhedron&quot; was awarded the Origins Award for &quot;Best Amateur Adventure Gaming Magazine of 1987&quot;.

&quot;Dungeon/Polyhedron Magazine&quot; won the 2002 Gold Ennie Award for &quot;Best Aid or Accessory&quot;.

<doc id="850281" wikidata="Q1070640" url="?curid=850281" title="Chessie System">
<text>Chessie System, Inc. was a holding company that owned the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O), the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O), the Western Maryland Railway (WM), and Baltimore and Ohio Chicago Terminal Railroad (B&amp;OCT). Trains operated under the Chessie name from 1973 to 1987. 

Headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, the Chessie System was the creation of Cyrus S. Eaton and his protégé Hays T. Watkins, then president and chief executive officer of the C&amp;O. A chief source of revenue for the Chessie System was coal mined in West Virginia. Another was the transport of auto parts and finished motor vehicles.

&quot;Chessie&quot; had been a popular nickname for the C&amp;O since the 1930s, cemented with an advertising campaign that featured a sleeping kitten named Chessie. The 1970s holding company developed the &quot;Ches-C&quot; emblem: a kitten outline imposed on a circle, creating a rough letter C. This emblem was emblazoned on the front of all Chessie System locomotives, and also served as the &quot;C&quot; in &quot;Chessie System&quot; on the locomotive&#x27;s flanks, and on other rolling stock.

== History ==
The beginnings of the Chessie System came from cooperation between the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O). An announcement from the New York Central (NYC) and Pennsylvania (PRR) railroads in November 1957 that they were considering combining prompted the B&amp;O and C&amp;O to consider a similar move. Ultimately, the financially stronger C&amp;O took control of the B&amp;O in December 1962, though the two railroads kept their separate identities. 

The combined C&amp;O/B&amp;O purchased stock in the Western Maryland Railway until it was able to take full control in February 1967, bringing a third railroad into the combined entity, which in 1973 became formally known as the Chessie System after the C&amp;O&#x27;s historic cat mascot Chessie. 

Chessie System was incorporated in Virginia on February 26, 1973, and it acquired the railroads on June 15. 

On November 1, 1980, Chessie System merged with Seaboard Coast Line Industries to form CSX Corporation. Initially, the three Chessie System railroads continued to operate separately, even after Seaboard&#x27;s six Family Lines System railroads were merged into the Seaboard System Railroad on December 29, 1982. That began to change in 1983, when the WM was merged into the B&amp;O. The Chessie image continued to be applied to new and re-painted equipment until July 1, 1986, when CSXT introduced its own paint scheme. In April 1987, the B&amp;O was merged into the C&amp;O. In August 1987, C&amp;O merged into CSX Transportation, a 1986 renaming of the Seaboard System Railroad, and the Chessie System name was retired. 

==List of railroad subsidiaries==

Its subsidiaries included:

*Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad
*Baltimore &amp; Ohio Chicago Terminal Railroad
*Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway
*Covington &amp; Cincinnati Elevated Railroad &amp; Transfer &amp; Bridge Company
*Staten Island Railroad
*Toledo Ore RR Company
*Western Maryland Railway

== Notable locomotives ==
The Chessie System company itself directly owned no locomotives or other rolling stock. Instead, equipment was placed on the roster of one of the three component railroads and ownership denoted by the reporting marks C&amp;O, B&amp;O, and WM. All three companies shared a common paint scheme of yellow, vermillion, and blue.

Notable Chessie System locomotives include:
*B&amp;O #1977 (EMD GP40-2) was meant to celebrate the B&amp;O&#x27;s 150th anniversary. For a short time, there were two B&amp;O locomotives numbered 1977; this GP40 was later renumbered B&amp;O 4100 and B&amp;O 4163. 
*B&amp;O #GM50 (EMD GP40-2) was painted gold to celebrate GM-EMD&#x27;s 50th anniversary as a diesel locomotive manufacturer. In 1984, it was repainted and renumbered B&amp;O 4164.
*B&amp;O #3802 (EMD GP38) was named the &quot;All American Locomotive&quot; by &quot;Trains&quot; in 1982. It has been restored and is on display at the B&amp;O Railroad Museum in Baltimore.
*B&amp;O #4444 (EMD GP40-2) pulled Ronald Reagan&#x27;s 1984 presidential train through Ohio. It was the third-to-last GP40-2 owned by Chessie; the last was B&amp;O 4447.

The former Reading Company #2101 (T-1-class 4-8-4) was one of three locomotives that pulled the American Freedom Train in 1975 and 1976. As part of B&amp;O&#x27;s 150th anniversary celebration in 1977, the Chessie System sent #2101 on a national tour as the &quot;Chessie Steam Special&quot;. Painted in the Chessie System motif, the train consisted of the locomotive, two tenders, and 18 to 20 passenger and baggage cars. In March 1979, the locomotive was severely damaged in a fire while stored in a Chessie System roundhouse in Silver Grove, Kentucky. It has since been cosmetically restored to its American Freedom Train paint scheme, and is on static display at the B&amp;O Railroad Museum, although has been exposed to the elements for most of its time there. In October 2023, the locomotive was moved into the museum&#x27;s shops to undergo a cosmetic restoration.

In 2017, the Lake Shore Railway Historical Society acquired C&amp;O 8272, a GE B30-7. It has been restored in the Chessie System paint scheme and currently resides at the Lake Shore Railway Museum in North East, Pennsylvania, and most recently, an EMD GP15T (C&amp;O 1507) was donated to the B&amp;O Railroad Museum.

==Heritage units==

In 2015, CSX used decals to decorate two of its locomotives in the livery of predecessor railroads. CSX AC4400CW 366 bears the &quot;Chess-C&quot; and C40-8W 7765 has the &quot;B&amp;O&quot; logo. 366&#x27;s decal was later damaged by fire and removed.

In June 2023, GE ES44AH unit #1973 entered service, being repaired and painted at CSX shops in Waycross, GA with a CSX blue and yellow color scheme on the front (nose) and cab of the locomotive and throughout the rest of the locomotive, the classic yellow and red Chessie System scheme. It was numbered #1973 in homage to the year the Chessie System was created.

<text>The 1999 [[Wigan (UK Parliament constituency)|Wigan]] [[by-election]] of 23 September 1999 was held after the death of the incumbent Labour MP, Roger Stott.

The by-election was contested by nine candidates in total, with Labour selecting Neil Turner, who had been a local councillor for 27 years, to defend the seat. Meanwhile, the Conservatives chose Tom Peet, who was an active Trade Unionist and had worked at a nearby coal mine.

The result was a hold for the Labour Party, with Turner gaining 59.6% of the vote, in spite of a 5% swing to the Conservative Party.

<doc id="850286" wikidata="Q4115039" url="?curid=850286" title="Aortic sinus">
<text>An aortic sinus, also known as a sinus of Valsalva, is one of the anatomic dilations of the ascending aorta, which occurs just above the aortic valve. These widenings are between the wall of the aorta and each of the three cusps of the aortic valve.

The aortic sinuses cause eddies which prevent the valve cusps from touching the internal surface of the aorta and obstructing the openings of the coronary arteries.

== Structure ==
There are generally three aortic sinuses, one anterior and two posterior sinuses. These give rise to coronary arteries:
* The left aortic or left posterior aortic sinus gives rise to the left coronary artery;
* The right aortic or anterior aortic sinus gives rise to the right coronary artery;
* The posterior aortic or right posterior aortic sinus usually gives rise to no vessels. It is often known as the &quot;non-coronary&quot; sinus.
The aortic sinuses are typically more prominent than the pulmonary sinuses.

== Clinical significance ==
If the coronary arteries arise from the wrong aortic sinuses, this can put the heart&#x27;s ventricles at risk of ischaemia. This is often only discovered when a heart attack has already occurred, usually before the age of 20 and during exercise.

== Names ==
Each aortic sinus can also be referred to as the sinus of Valsalva, the sinus of Morgagni, the sinus of Mehta, the sinus of Otto, or Petit&#x27;s sinus.

<doc id="850289" wikidata="Q1836478" url="?curid=850289" title="Ford D3 platform">
<text>The Ford D3 platform is an automotive platform used by Ford Motor Company for model years 2005-2019, as the fifteenth generation of full-size North American cars. 

The platform used unibody chassis construction with a transverse V6 engine and either front -or all-wheel drive. The platform derived from the 1998-2016 Volvo P2 architecture, relating to a period when Ford owned Volvo as part of its Premier Automotive Group. From model year 2008 on, the related D4 platform served as a basis for crossover SUVs.

While the vehicles of the D3 platform were officially introduced as the replacement for the 1999-2007 D186 platform (Ford Taurus), in terms of market position and interior volume, they effectively superseded the Ford and Mercury vehicles of the 1978-2012 Panther platform.

Between 2004 and 2019. D3 vehicles have been assembled at Chicago Assembly in Chicago, Illinois along with the D4 Ford Explorer. The D4 Ford Flex and Lincoln MKT were assembled at Oakville Assembly in Oakville, Ontario, Canada.

==Overview==
To achieve a more cost-effective design, the D3 platform rendered certain elements in steel, as with for example the suspension arms in stamped steel vs. cast aluminum.

Ford adopted a common 112.9 wheelbase for its D3 variants, three inches longer than Volvo&#x27;s platform. Notably, where the Volvo platform used inline five or six cylinder engines, Ford adopted its transverse Duratec V6 engines to the platform — including later Duratec engines compressing their design (e.g., embedding the water pump deeper in the engine) to accommodate the platform. As with the front-drive P2 platform, a Haldex all-wheel drive (shared with the S80/XC90) was optional.

As the first front-wheel drive full-size car platform used by Ford, the D3 platform is also the first full-size Ford car produced with fully independent suspension, with a multi-link rear axle, coilover shocks and MacPherson front struts. The D3 is fitted with four-wheel disc brakes.

===D4===
The D4 platform is a revision of D3 unibody platform used since 2008. Developed to underpin crossover SUVs (including the Ford Flex, Lincoln MKT, and the MY 2011-2019 Ford Explorer), the variant is adaptable to multiple wheelbases; the suspension is also upgraded for off-road driving and towing.

Two variants of the D4 were developed as replacements for Panther-platform vehicles: the Ford Police Interceptor Utility (a police-use version of the Ford Explorer) served as a replacement for the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor; Lincoln introduced limousine, and livery variants of the MKT, replacing similar conversions of the Lincoln Town Car.

==Vehicles==
Between the 2005 and 2019 model years, the Ford D3 platform has been used by Ford, Lincoln, and the (now-defunct) Mercury brands. Introduced as the Ford Five Hundred and Mercury Montego, which were subsequently re-branded as the fifth-generation Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable for 2008.

For model year 2009 and 2010 respectively, Ford also marketed a Lincoln D3 variant, the MKS and the D3-based sixth-generation Ford Taurus.

After discontinuation of the Mercury brand, the Mercury Sable ended production after the 2009 model year. For 2017, Lincoln replaced the MKS with the revived Lincoln Continental, based on the CD4 architecture. 
===Concept cars===
* 2005 Mercury Meta One diesel-electric hybrid crossover SUV 
* 2008 Lincoln MKT luxury crossover SUV not to be confused with the production car of the same name that is on a modified version of the D3 platform known as D4.

<doc id="850294" wikidata="Q390372" url="?curid=850294" title="Hasil Adkins">
<text>Hasil Adkins (April 29, 1937 – April 26, 2005) was an American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. His genres include rock and roll, country, blues and more commonly rockabilly, and because of his unusual playing and singing style, he is often cited as an example of outsider music. He generally performed as a one-man band, playing guitar and drums at the same time.

Adkins was born during the Great Depression and grew up in poverty. His spirited, unusual lifestyle is reflected in his music. His songs, which he began recording and distributing locally in the mid-1950s, explored an affinity for chicken, sexual intercourse, and decapitation, and were obscure outside of West Virginia until the 1980s. The newfound popularity secured him a cult following, spawned the Norton Records label, and helped usher in the genre known as psychobilly.

==Personal life==
Adkins was born in Boone County, West Virginia on April 29, 1937, where he spent his entire life. He was the youngest of ten children of Wid Adkins, a coal miner, and Alice Hale, raised in a tarpaper shack on property rented from a local coal company. Born at the time of the Great Depression, Adkins&#x27; early life was stricken by poverty. His parents were unable to provide him shoes until he was four or five years old. Some reports say he attended school for a very brief time, as few as two days of first grade.

Adkins&#x27; given name, Hasil, pronounced &quot;Hassel&quot;, was often mispronounced. One of his brothers was named Basil, similarly pronounced &quot;Bassel&quot;. Hasil dated a girl named Hazel, and was later given the nickname &quot;The Haze&quot;. As he explained it, the nickname came about &quot;&#x27;cause Starlight records wanted something catchy and I didn&#x27;t have no middle name.&quot;

Hasil Adkins loved to eat meat, specifically poultry, the subject of many of his songs. Following the release of 2000&#x27;s &quot;Poultry in Motion&quot;, Adkins toured with &quot;dancing go-go chicken&quot; dancers. His diet also reportedly consisted of as much as two gallons of coffee a day, and copious amounts of liquor and cigarettes.

Aside from his fondness for meat, Adkins claimed to have but three loves in life, &quot;girls, guitars, and cars. All three of [which] got me into trouble over the years.&quot; One such incident occurred in 1957 when he and three friends drove a car off a mountain. A local newspaper reported the car tumbled 70 feet into nearby Pond Fork. While the driver died at the scene, Adkins survived, although he sustained a permanent back injury.

In the 1980s Adkins again found himself in trouble with the law. In 1983 he was living with his girlfriend who was still a minor. Her mother reported to police that she had been raped, and Adkins was subsequently charged with third-degree sexual assault, or statutory rape of a minor less than 16 years old. In October the same year, another relationship ended with jail time, when a shootout occurred between Adkins and a jealous husband. No one was hurt, but Adkins was charged with felony illegal possession of a shotgun and spent five months in jail.

Adkins was said to have manic depression and insomnia among other mental illnesses. He never married.

On April 15, 2005, Adkins was run over in his front yard by a teenager riding an ATV. Eleven days later, on April 26, Adkins was found dead in his home, three days before his 68th birthday.

==Career==
Nicknamed &quot;The Haze&quot;, Adkins career began in the mid-1950s in an improvised studio in his home near Madison, West Virginia. There he put his vibrant Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis influences to work by recording scores of songs, beginning with the track &quot;I&#x27;m Happy&quot;. In a later interview he exclaimed &quot;I couldn&#x27;t afford no drums so I just stomped my feet.&quot; He eventually learned to use percussive instruments to accompany his guitar and vocals, which would become his hallmark sound.

In 1961 Adkins headed to California in search of fame, auditioning with talent agencies in and around Los Angeles. With little to go on, he returned to West Virginia, though claimed he missed a callback from an agency a single day after departing for his home. Back at home, Adkins began performing at local nightclubs, behind a store-bought sign that read &quot;One of the Greatest Shows on Earth, the One Man Band Haze Adkins and his Happy Guitar&quot;.

The mid-1960s brought Adkins first official release through a local micro-label, with the 45 record &quot;Chicken Walk / She&#x27;s Mine&quot;. What followed were the releases of some of his most notable songs, though at the time they received little attention outside of Madison. &quot;She Said&quot; revealed his imaginative tone in writing, in which he compared the woman of a one-night stand he had to &quot;a dying can of that commodity meat.&quot; &quot;No More Hot Dogs&quot; was a song about decapitating a girlfriend and keeping her head as a wall mount.

Adkins began to transition from his rockabilly roots to country music by the 1970s, producing several self-released records. It was a tradition of his to mail a copy of each single he released to the sitting President of the United States. In 1970 Richard Nixon wrote back, saying &quot;I am very pleased by your thoughtfulness in bringing these particular selections to my attention.&quot;

The early 1980s saw a resurgence in Adkins&#x27; fan base when the American punk rock band The Cramps did a remake of Adkins&#x27; &quot;She Said&quot;. The Cramps having picked up the song from the bootleg compilation &quot;Rockabilly Bash&quot; during a UK tour&quot;.&quot; In 1984 UK label Big Beat Records included Hasil&#x27;s original on the psychobilly compilation &quot;Rockabilly Psychosis and the Garage Disease&quot;. Having made contact with Big Beat Records, Hasil proceeded to provide them with some of his home recorded tapes, which resulted in the album &quot;She Said&quot; being released in 1985.

Also in 1985, he was approached by former Cramps drummer Miriam Linna and her husband Billy Miller about releasing some of Adkins&#x27; work. Resultantly they created the independent record label Norton Records and released the compilation album &quot;Out to Hunch&quot; in 1986, which became an underground success. Billy Miller soon was appointed as Adkins&#x27; manager, and together with Linna they headed to New York City for Adkins&#x27; first professional recording session, yielding 1987&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Man&quot;. Upon release, the album was featured as &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;Rock Album of the Week&quot;.

By the 1990s Adkins had gained a cult following and began touring regularly, receiving offers from more record labels. In 1994 Miles Copeland III of I.R.S. Records purchased the rights to Adkins&#x27; recordings, and although an album was planned for release, it never materialized. Frustrated, Adkins soon gained back rights to some of his songs after a deal with Mississippi blues label Fat Possum, who recorded and released 1999&#x27;s &quot;What The Hell Was I Thinking?&quot; and booked him a tour alongside T-Model Ford and Elmo Williams.

In 2000 Norton released a compilation of new and previous recordings about Adkins&#x27; devotion to chicken, entitled &quot;Poultry in Motion&quot; that included such songs as &quot;Chicken Run,&quot; &quot;Chicken Hop,&quot; &quot;Chicken Flop,&quot; &quot;Chicken Wobble,&quot; and &quot;Chicken on the Bone.&quot; In total, Adkins claimed nearly 7,000 songs to his repertoire.

While music was his true passion, Adkins enjoyed a career in the film and television industry. He played himself as a street musician in 2004&#x27;s &quot;The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things&quot;, partially narrated &quot;The Red&#x27;s Breakfast Experience&quot; and starred in a comedic horror film entitled &quot;Die You Zombie Bastards!&quot;. As a composer he helped score &quot;Hair High&quot; in 2004. Adkins was also the subject of the Julien Nitzberg documentary &quot;The Wild World of Hasil Adkins&quot;, distributed by Appalshop.

Adkins was inducted into the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame in 2018.

==Legacy==
Adkins is often cited as an important precursor to the psychobilly genre. The Cramps attribute many of their punk-psychobilly traits to Adkins; they covered &quot;She Said&quot; live, and released a studio version as the b-side of &quot;Goo Goo Muck&quot; (1981), which later appeared on their compilation album &quot;Bad Music for Bad People&quot; (1984). This helped usher Adkins into cult status as an underground musician, and inspired Cramps&#x27; drummer Miriam Linna and her husband Billy Miller to found the Norton Records label. North Carolina psychobilly group Flat Duo Jets also covered Adkins with &quot;Let Me Come In&quot; on the 1993 lo-fi compilation &quot;Safari&quot;, which was released on Norton Records.

==Musical style==
Frenetic in progression and explicit in lyrical content, Adkins was known for having an unconventional take on traditional rockabilly. His unpolished sound was a praised by-product of the makeshift studio equipment used for the majority of his career. &quot;I didn&#x27;t try to be primitive, I just had bad microphones&quot;, he wrote. His lyrics explored topics such as eating peanut butter on the moon and the suggestive strut of a chicken. Recurring themes in Adkins&#x27; catalogue included sex, heartbreak, decapitation, aliens, hot dogs and poultry. Together with country and honky-tonk, Adkins&#x27; assortment of styles helped delineate a genre known as psychobilly.

Adkins performed as a one-man band, using foot pedals to play the drums, or simply stomped his feet on the floor to an often detuned guitar. He once vowed that he would play &quot;twelve to twenty&quot; instruments simultaneously, including playing the piano and organ with his elbows. He noted in interviews that his primary heroes and influences were Hank Williams, Jimmie Rodgers, Little Richard, and Col. Harland Sanders, the inventor of Kentucky Fried Chicken. Adkins attributed his desire to perform as a one-man band to these artists, stating that when he was a child, he assumed the only credited musician in the band must have played all the instruments in the recordings. The first time he saw a guitarist in action, he built a guitar of his own.

Many of Adkins&#x27; songs were accompanied by a dance of the same name. &quot;The Hunch&quot; was understood to be a dry humping dance craze, although Adkins failed to define it in interviews. He used the term to describe anything of sexual relation, even naming his car the &quot;Hunchin&#x27; Wagon&quot;. &quot;The Slop&quot; was a song and dance Adkins pioneered for &quot;the drunks&quot;, which he made so &quot;you could just go left or right or fall down or anything you ran into&quot;. 2000&#x27;s &quot;Poultry in Motion&quot; introduced a slew of chicken dances. &quot;The Chicken Walk&quot; involved &quot;quiver[ing] yourself from head to toe&quot; to mimic that of a chicken, while &quot;The Chicken Flop&quot; was simply &quot;flopping all over the place&quot;.

Adkins primarily recorded and performed his own songs, although &quot;Peanut Butter Rock and Roll&quot; included covers of Carl Perkins&#x27; &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; and Harry Belafonte&#x27;s &quot;Day-O&quot;. Additionally, &quot;Achy Breaky Ha Ha Ha&quot;, a country album, included covers of songs by Bill Monroe, Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Carter Stanley, and A. P. Carter.

<doc id="850295" wikidata="Q2979100" url="?curid=850295" title="Clifford Sifton">
<text>Sir Clifford Sifton, (March 10, 1861 – April 17, 1929), was a Canadian lawyer and a long-time Liberal politician, best known for being Minister of the Interior under Sir Wilfrid Laurier. He was responsible for encouraging the massive amount of immigration to Canada which occurred during the first decade of the 20th century. In 1905, he broke with Laurier and resigned from cabinet over the issue of publicly funded religious education in the new provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.

==Early life==
Sifton was born in Middlesex County, Canada West (now Ontario). Sifton&#x27;s father, John Wright Sifton, was a contractor and businessman who moved with his family to Manitoba when Sifton was a boy.

Sifton trained as a lawyer and graduated from Victoria University in the University of Toronto, where he was the founding manager of &quot;Acta Victoriana&quot;.

== Political career ==

=== Manitoba provincial politics: Attorney General for Manitoba ===
Sifton worked on his father&#x27;s political campaigns before being himself elected to the legislative assembly of Manitoba in 1888. Sifton served in the cabinet of Thomas Greenway from 1891 to 1896 as attorney general and Provincial Lands Commissioner. He played a role in negotiating the Laurier-Greenway Compromise, which temporarily resolved the Manitoba Schools Question.

=== Federal politics: Minister of the Interior ===
In 1896, Sifton was first elected a Member of Parliament after being acclaimed in a by-election in Brandon. He was re-elected in the 1900 Canadian federal election against a strong challenge from former Manitoba premier Hugh John Macdonald. Sifton would be re-elected two more times, in 1904 and 1908.

Sifton was appointed Minister of the Interior under Laurier and implemented a vigorous immigration policy called &quot;The Last Best West&quot; to encourage people to settle and populate the West. Sifton established colonial offices in Europe and the United States. He enticed people to come to western Canada. While many of the immigrants came from Britain and the United States, there was also, to Canada, a large influx of Ukrainians, Scandinavians, Doukhobors, and other groups from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He famously defended the &quot;stalwart peasants in sheep-skin coats&quot; who were turning some of the most difficult parts of the western plains into productive farms.

Between 1891 and 1914, more than three million people came to Canada, largely from continental Europe, following the path of the newly constructed transcontinental railway. In the same period, mining industries were begun in the Klondike and the Canadian Shield.

After presiding over the creation of Alberta and Saskatchewan in 1905, Sifton resigned from cabinet following a dispute with Laurier over religious education.

Especially later in his life, Sifton battled increasing deafness, which precluded any further potential political advances.

==Later life==
Sifton retired from politics in 1911 but crusaded against the government policy of reciprocity, because he believed that increased economic integration between Canada and the United States would result in Canada being taken over by the Americans.

A sometimes repeated assertion on immigration policy, that &quot;a stalwart peasant in a sheep-skin coat, born on the soil,[...]is good quality,&quot; was made in a 1922 article he wrote.

Sifton died in 1929 in New York City, where he had been visiting a heart specialist. He left a fortune estimated at $3.2 million, equivalent to about $ in present-day terminology. Sifton is buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto.

==Family==

Sifton, then a young lawyer, was married in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on August 18, 1884, to Elizabeth Armanella Burrows (1862-1925). She was the daughter of Henry James Burrows and his wife, Sarah Sparks. Elizabeth was born in Ottawa, Ontario, and educated at the Ottawa Ladies&#x27; College. She founded and presided over the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in Brandon, Manitoba.

The couple had five sons. 
* John Wright Sifton (1886–1932)
* Winfield Burrows Sifton (1890–1928)
* Henry Arthur &quot;Harry&quot; Sifton (1891–1934)
* Wilfred Victor Sifton (1897–1961)

His brother-in-law Theodore Arthur Burrows would also serve as a Liberal MP in the Laurier government, and he was later appointed the tenth Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba.

His brother Arthur Sifton served as the second Premier of Alberta.

==In popular culture==
Brad Austin portrays Sifton in episode 15 of season 13 &quot;The Trial of Terrence Meyers&quot; (February 10, 2020) of the Canadian television period detective series Murdoch Mysteries.

== Archives ==
There is a Clifford Sifton fonds at Library and Archives Canada.

<text>Abadal is a Spanish automobile company founded by the famous early 20th century racing driver Don Francisco Serramelera Abadal, better known as Paco Abadal, in Barcelona in 1912.

==Don Francisco Serramelera Abadal==

Abadal was born on 27 July 1875 in Manresa and by the end of the century was a notable cyclist in Barcelona. His first motor vehicle was a 1.75-hp Clément tricycle which he raced. In 1902 Abadal began selling cars, motorbikes, cycles and accessories from the Auto-Garage Central in Barcelona.

He won a won a couple of hill climbs at Rabassade near Barcelona. The first in February 1904 was in a Clement 16 hp and the second in January 1905 was in a Hispano-Suiza T20. Also in 1905, he sold a Hispano-Suiza to King Alfonso XIII. His business grew and by 1908 he had branches in Calle Sepúlveda, Plaza Letamendi and Carretera de Sarriá. In In October 1912 Abadal married Mercedes Durán, daughter of the wealthy Catalan businessman and industrialist, Joaquim Durán Albert. In 1913 Hispano-Suiza cancelled its contract with Abadal so he decided to make his own vehicles under the make Abadal.

Soon after the inception of the Abadal line in 1913 Abadal visited the Belgian company Impéria. They negotiated an agreement whereby Impéria began building Abadals under license as Impéria-Abadal, With the outbreak of World War One and the invasion of Belgium by Germany this arrangement came to a temporary end.

In 1916 Abadal acquired the Buick agency, and Barcelona-built Abadals after that year had Buick power units and featured custom coachwork. These cars were called Abadal-Buick. In 1919 M A Van Roggen (formerly of Springuel) took over Impéria and built around 170 more Impéria-Abadals. Among the models produced were a 2992cc 16-valve four-cylinder OHC sports model and three prototype 5630 cc straight-eights.

Abadel passed away on 17 December 1939.

==Automobiles==
=== Abadal 18HP, 23HP and 45HP ===
The first models were released simultaneously in 1913 under the direction of Francisco. &quot;Abadal 18HP&quot; and &quot;Abadal 25HP&quot; had a four-cylinder engine with a volume of 3.6 liters with a piston stroke of 180 millimeters and a cylinder diameter of 80 millimeters, as well as a four-speed manual gearbox. The five-seater open-top car was equipped with a suspension on semi-elliptical springs and traditional at that time drum brakes. The models were assembled on a spar frame and generally had technical similarities with other similar cars of that time, in particular with &quot;Hispano-Suiza&quot;, but differed in design, for example, a wedge-shaped radiator. The maximum speed that the cars could reach was 112 kilometers per hour. A 1914 version of the 25HP is held at the Caramulo Museum in Portugal.

Abadal 45HP had all the same characteristics, but unlike the previous models, it stood out with a six-cylinder engine. These cars were more reliable than their predecessors.

=== Abadal 15.9HP ===
The model was first presented at the Paris Motor Show in 1913. Despite the classic appearance of the cars of that time, the &quot;Abadal 15.9HP&quot; was a new racing model of the company and differed from other sports models by its completely wooden body, which was designed and recreated by the French coachbuilder Jean Henri-Labourdette.

=== Abadal Buick 1923 ===
Buick engines had been used under licence in Abadal&#x27;s since 1916. The first cooperative car of the two company&#x27;s was released in 1923 under a joint name. The rear-wheel drive roadster was equipped with a six-cylinder engine with 60 horsepower, which contributed to acceleration of 140 kilometers per hour. The car was intended for track racing and weighed 1030 kilograms. One of these is held at Collecio D&#x27;automobils Salvador Claret near Barcelona.

There is a note of a Abadal Buick driven by José Rubio Márques winning a hillclimb at Reina near Malaga. This was followed by Pascual Sogas winning a hillclimb at Ordal near Barcelona on 29 December 1918 and again at Perdeces near Madrid on 7 June 1919. These are likely Buick engined Abadal&#x27;s as the joint name did not appear till later. A Abadal-Buick driven by Leon Derny won a hillclimb at Porta-Coeli near Valencia on 23 June 1923.

===Impéria-Abadal===

Another racing car rolled off the assembly line in 1921 under another joint name, &quot;Abadal Imperial&quot;. This was the last joint project, developed in the year the partnership agreement expired. The model turned out to be the fastest version of all those previously released in alliance with &quot;Impéria&quot;. It had an 8-cylinder engine with a total volume of 5.6 liters and was capable of accelerating to a maximum speed of 145 kilometers per hour. On 12 August 1922 this car won the 40 lap (about 603 km) &quot;Le Grand Prix pour voitures de tourisme&quot; at Spa-Francorchamps. It was driven by Baron Raymond de Tornaco and Barthélémy.

=== Abadal Continental 1930 ===
The last car of this brand was a prototype of a luxury sedan with a 3.5-liter engine from the German company Continental AG, on which Francisco had placed great hopes, but they were not destined to come true, because nothing followed beyond the idea and the initial sample.

==Demise==
The company ceased automobile production in 1923. Abadal became an agent of General Motors in Spain. General Motors&#x27; plans in 1930 related to a prototype named the Abadal Continental never materialised.

== Gallery ==
==Abadal Y-12 aero-engine==
Abadal also produced the Abadal Y-12 aero-engine, a multiple bank in-line engine with twelve cylinders in three banks of four arranged in a Y. It was produced during World War One as an experimental aircraft engine. It was rated at 350 hp.

==Postage stamps==
An Abadal featured on a 1977 Spanish postage stamp and a 1984 postage stamp from Nicaragua.

<text>James Mark Borgman (born February 24, 1954) is an American cartoonist. He is known for his political cartoons and his nationally syndicated comic strip &quot;Zits&quot;. He was the editorial cartoonist at &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; from 1976 to 2008.

==Biography==
Borgman was born in Cincinnati, Ohio to James and Marian Borgman, where he began his career in journalism as a student at Elder High School. He then attended Ohio&#x27;s Kenyon College where he started as an English major, then switched to being an art major. He graduated in 1976 with Phi Beta Kappa honors.

Borgman met his first wife Lynn Goodwin during his senior year of college at a class called Jesus and the Gospels. They had two children named Dylan and Chelsea. Lynn died in 1999 from a blood clot following surgery to ease chronic neck and shoulder pain. In 2003 he married Suzanne Soled, an educational psychologist and professor at Northern Kentucky University.

==Career==
At Kenyon College, Borgman drew editorial cartoons for the &quot;Kenyon Collegian&quot;.

He became &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;″s editorial cartoonist in 1976. Since 1980, his editorial cartoons have been nationally syndicated, at first by King Features Syndicate. In 2007, Universal Press Syndicate took over the distribution of his editorial cartoons. In 2008, he took a voluntary buyout offered by &quot;Enquirer&quot; parent Gannett Company but continued to work on &quot;Zits&quot; after leaving the paper.

==Comic strip series==

===Wonk City===
His body of work has included the weekly comic strip &quot;Wonk City&quot;, which ran from 1994 to 1996 on the editorial pages of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. A surreal send-up of inside-the-beltway mores during the administration of Bill Clinton, many of the cartoons featured a cat involved in behind-the-scenes political skullduggery.

===Zits===

While on vacation in Sedona, Arizona, Borgman met up with fellow cartoonist Jerry Scott. Scott pitched the idea of a cartoon about a teenager and thus the comic strip &quot;Zits&quot; was born, debuting in July, 1997, with Borgman drawing and Scott writing.

&quot;Zits&quot; is syndicated in over 1500 newspapers around the world and has been translated into nine languages, including German, Chinese, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese, Finnish and Polish.

==Awards==
In 1991, when Borgman was 37 years old, he won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning. He has also won the National Cartoonist Society Editorial Cartoon Award for 1986, 1987, 1988, 1994, and 2006, their Newspaper Comic Strip for 1997, their Newspaper Comic Strip (with Jerry Scott) in 1998 and 1999 for &quot;Zits&quot;, and their Reuben Award in 1993.

Borgman also won the Reuben Award for editorial cartooning in 2006, and has achieved a great deal of recognition for his work.

<doc id="850303" wikidata="Q3623314" url="?curid=850303" title="Chidiock Tichborne">
<text>Chidiock Tichborne (after 24 August 1562 – 20 September 1586), erroneously referred to as Charles, was an English conspirator and poet.

==Life==

Tichborne was born in Southampton sometime after 24 August 1562 to Roman Catholic parents, Peter Tichborne and his wife Elizabeth (née Middleton). His birth date has been given as circa 1558 in many sources, though unverified, and thus his age given as 28 at his execution. It is unlikely that he was born before his parents&#x27; marriage, so he could have been no more than 23 years old when he died.

Chidiock Tichborne descended from Sir Roger de Tichborne, who owned land at Tichborne, near Winchester, in the twelfth century. Chidiock&#x27;s second cousin and contemporary was Sir Benjamin Tichborne who lived at Tichborne Park and was created a Baronet by King James I in 1621. In Chidiock&#x27;s reported oration from the scaffold before his execution he allegedly stated: &quot;I am descended from a house, from two hundred years before the Conquest, never stained till this my misfortune&quot;.

Chidiock&#x27;s father Peter appears to have been the youngest son of Henry Tichborne (born circa 1474) and Anne Mervin (or Marvin) but the records are unclear. Peter was clerk of the Crowne at the trial of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton in 1554 and was an ardent Catholic supporter. Being the youngest son of a youngest son he was of little means and required to make his own way. He secured an education and the patronage of his distant kinsman, Lord Chidiock Paulet (1521–1574, son of the 1st Marquess of Winchester), after whom he named his son. In later life he spent many years imprisoned unable to pay recusancy fines. Chidiock&#x27;s mother was Elizabeth Middleton, daughter of William Middleton (grandson of Sir Thomas Middleton of Belso) and Elizabeth Potter (daughter of John Potter of Westram). William had been servant to John Islip, Abbot of Westminster, and a banner bearer at Islip&#x27;s funeral 1532, and later bought lands in Kent.

The name &quot;Chidiock&quot;, pronounced ‘chidik’, as derived from his father&#x27;s patron, Chidiock Paulet, originates from a Paulet ancestor, Sir John de Chideock, who owned land at Chideock, a village in Dorset. Chidiock Tichborne was never called Charles – this is an error that has grown from a misprint in the AQA GCSE English Literature syllabus which has included the Elegy in its early poetry section for several years. Unfortunately, this error persists in much of the educational literature supporting the syllabus.

At least two of Chidiock&#x27;s sisters are recorded by name: Dorothy, first wife of Thomas Muttelbury of Jurdens, Somerset; and Mary, second wife of Sir William Kirkham of Blagdon in the parish of Paignton in Devon. At his execution Chidiock mentions his wife Agnes, one child, and his six sisters. In his letter to his wife, written the night before his execution he mentions his sisters – and also &#x27;my little sister Babb&#x27;. Another sister is implied in a secret intelligence note to Francis Walsingham, dated 18 September 1586, in which the writer has had conference with &quot;Jennings of Portsmouth&quot; who reports that Mr Bruyn of Dorset and Mr Kyrkham of Devon are persons to be suspect as they had married Tychbourn&#x27;s sisters.

==History==

After the succession of Elizabeth I to the throne following the death of Mary I, Chidiock was allowed to practise Catholicism for part of his early life. However, in 1570 the Queen was excommunicated by the Pope for her own Protestantism and support of Protestant causes, most notably the Dutch Rebellion against Spain; in retaliation she ended her relative toleration of the Catholic Church. Catholicism was made illegal, and Roman Catholics were once more banned by law from practising their religion and Roman Catholic priests risked death for performing their functions.
In 1583, Tichborne and his father, Peter, were arrested and questioned concerning the use of &quot;popish relics&quot;, religious objects Tichborne had brought back from a visit he had made abroad without informing the authorities of an intention to travel. Though released without charge, records suggest that this was not the last time they were to be questioned by the authorities over their religion. In June 1586 accusations of &quot;popish practices&quot; were laid against his family.

In June 1586, Tichborne agreed to take part in the Babington Plot to murder Queen Elizabeth and replace her with the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, who was next in line to the throne. The plot was foiled by Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth&#x27;s spymaster, using double agents, most notably Robert Poley who was later witness to the murder of Christopher Marlowe, and though most of the conspirators fled, Tichborne had an injured leg and was forced to remain in London. On 14 August he was arrested and he was later tried and sentenced to death in Westminster Hall.

While in custody in the Tower of London on 19 September (the eve of his execution), Tichborne wrote a letter to his wife. She is named as Agnes, even though the State Papers recording his interrogation clearly identify her as Jane Martyn of Athelhampton. But in Tudor times, Agnes was often used as a nickname or term of endearment for very devout women; and it was pronounced in a way that made it sound similar to Jane. So Agnes was most probably a private name that the young husband used for his wife.

The letter contained three stanzas of poetry that is his best known piece of work, &quot;Tichborne&#x27;s Elegy&quot;, also known by its first line &quot;My Prime of Youth is but a Frost of Cares&quot;. The poem is a dark look at a life cut short and is a favourite of many scholars to this day. Two other poems are known by him, &quot;To His Friend&quot; and &quot;The Housedove&quot;.

On 20 September 1586, Tichborne was executed with Anthony Babington, John Ballard, and four other conspirators. They were eviscerated, hanged, drawn and quartered, the mandatory punishment for treason, in St Giles Field. However, when Elizabeth was informed that these gruesome executions were arousing sympathy for the condemned, she ordered that the remaining seven conspirators were to be hanged until &#x27;quite dead&#x27; before being eviscerated.

==Tichborne&#x27;s poetry==

===Elegy and others===

====Elegy====

&lt;poem&gt;My prime of youth is but a frost of cares,
My feast of joy is but a dish of pain,
My crop of corn is but a field of tares,
And all my good is but vain hope of gain;
The day is past, and yet I saw no sun,
And now I live, and now my life is done.

My tale was heard and yet it was not told,
My fruit is fallen, and yet my leaves are green,
My youth is spent and yet I am not old,
I saw the world and yet I was not seen;
My thread is cut and yet it is not spun,
And now I live, and now my life is done.

I sought my death and found it in my womb,
I looked for life and saw it was a shade,
I trod the earth and knew it was my tomb,
And now I die, and now I was but made;
My glass is full, and now my glass is run,
And now I live, and now my life is done.&lt;/poem&gt;

This is the first printed version from &quot;Verses of Prayse and Joye&quot; (1586). The original text differs slightly: along with other minor differences, the first line of the second verse reads &quot;The spring is past, and yet it hath not sprung,&quot; and the third line reads &quot;My youth is gone, and yet I am but young.&quot;

The last word in the third line, &quot;tares,&quot; refers to a harmful &quot;weed&quot; that resembles corn when young, and is a reference to Matt. 13:24–30.

====To His Friend (assumed to be Anthony Babington)====

&lt;poem&gt;Good sorrow cease, false hope be gone, misfortune once farewell;
Come, solemn muse, the sad discourse of our adventures tell.
A friend I had whose special part made mine affection his;
We ruled tides and streams ourselves, no want was in our bliss.
Six years we sailed, sea-room enough, by many happy lands,
Till at the length, a stream us took and cast us on the sands.
There lodged we were in a gulf of woe, despairing what to do,
Till at the length, from shore unknown, a Pilot to us drew,
Whose help did sound our grounded ship from out Caribda&#x27;s mouth,
But unadvised, on Scylla drives; the wind which from the South
Did blustering blow the fatal blast of our unhappy fall,
Where driving, leaves my friend and I to fortune ever thrall;
Where we be worse beset with sands and rocks on every side,
Where we be quite bereft of aid, of men, of winds, of tide.
Where vain it is to hail for help so far from any shore,
So far from Pilot&#x27;s course; despair shall we, therefore?
No! God from out his heap of helps on us will some bestow,
And send such mighty surge of seas, or else such blasts to blow
As shall remove our grounded ship far from this dangerous place,
And we shall joy each others&#x27; chance through God&#x27;s almighty grace,
And keep ourselves on land secure, our sail on safer seas.
Sweet friend, till then content thy self, and pray for our release.&lt;/poem&gt;

====The Housedove====

&lt;poem&gt;A silly housedove happed to fall
amongst a flock of crows,
Which fed and filled her harmless craw
amongst her fatal foes.
The crafty fowler drew his net –
all his that he could catch –
The crows lament their hellish chance,
the dove repents her match.
But too, too late! it was her chance
the fowler did her spy,
And so did take her for a crow –
which thing caused her to die.&lt;/poem&gt;

The only known manuscript versions of &quot;To His Friend&quot; and The Housedove&quot; are from Edinburgh Library MS Laing, II, 69/24. However, twenty-eight different manuscript versions of the &quot;Elegy&quot; (or &quot;Lament&quot;) are known and there are many variations of the text.

===Comment===
Tichborne&#x27;s authorship of the Elegy has been disputed, with attributions to others including Sir Walter Raleigh. However it was printed soon after the Babington plot in a volume called &quot;Verses of Praise and Joy&quot; in 1586, published by John Wolfe of London to celebrate the Queen&#x27;s survival and to attack the plotters. In the same volume an answer poem entitled &quot;Hendecasyllabon T. K. in Cygneam Cantionem Chideochi Tychborne&quot; (&quot;T. K.&#x27;s Hendecasyllabon Against Chidiock Tichborne&#x27;s Swan Song&quot;) is most likely by the poet and dramatist Thomas Kyd, author of &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot;.

====Hendecasyllabon T. K. in Cygneam Cantionem Chideochi Tychborne==== 

&lt;poem&gt;Thy prime of youth is frozen with thy faults,
Thy feast of joy is finisht with thy fall;
Thy crop of corn is tares availing naughts,
Thy good God knows thy hope, thy hap and all.
Short were thy days, and shadowed was thy sun,
T&#x27;obscure thy light unluckily begun.

Time trieth truth, and truth hath treason tripped;
Thy faith bare fruit as thou hadst faithless been:
Thy ill spent youth thine after years hath nipt;
And God that saw thee hath preserved our Queen.
Her thread still holds, thine perished though unspun,
And she shall live when traitors lives are done.

Thou soughtst thy death, and found it in desert,
Thou look&#x27;dst for life, yet lewdly forc&#x27;d it fade:
Thou trodst the earth, and now on earth thou art,
As men may wish thou never hadst been made.
Thy glory, and thy glass are timeless run;
And this, O Tychborne, hath thy treason done.&lt;/poem&gt;

===Critical appreciation===

====Elegy====
Tichborne&#x27;s &quot;Elegy&quot; (his rhyming, final soliloquy poem), uses two favourite Renaissance figures of speech – antithesis and paradox – to crystallise the tragedy of the poet&#x27;s situation. Antithesis means setting opposites against each other: prime of youth / frost of cares (from the first line). This is typical of Renaissance poetry, as for example in Wyatt&#x27;s &quot;I find no peace, and all my war is done&quot;, with the lover freezing/burning. It also appears in the poem by Elizabeth I &quot;I grieve and dare not show my discontent&quot;, e.g., &quot;I am and not, I freeze and yet am burned.&quot; A paradox is a statement which seems self-contradictory, yet is true, e.g., &quot;My tale is heard, and yet it was not told&quot;, or &quot;My glass is full, and now my glass is run.&quot; Often a Renaissance poem will begin with antithesis to establish circumstances and reveal its themes through paradox.

The &quot;Elegy&quot; is remarkable for being written almost entirely in monosyllables: Every word in the poem is of one syllable, with ten words in each line, monostich style), with the possible exception of the word &quot;fallen&quot;. However, in early editions it was written as &quot;fall&#x27;n&quot; which is monosyllabic.

The &quot;Elegy&quot; has inspired many &quot;homages&quot; and &quot;answers&quot; including those by Jonathon Robin at allpoetry.com ; a rap version by David A More at www.marlovian.com ; &quot;After Reading Tichborne&#x27;s Elegy&quot; by Dick Allen (2003) and Tichborne&#x27;s Lexicon by Nick Montfort.

The &quot;Elegy&quot; has also been set to music many times from the Elizabethan era to the present day by, among others, Michael East, Richard Alison (fl1580-1610, in &quot;An Hour&#x27;s Recreation in musicke&quot;, 1606), John Mundy (1592) and Charles-François Gounod (1873) and more recently Norman Dello Joio (1949) and Jim Clark (see Tichborne&#x27;s Elegy Poem Animation) and Taylor Momsen. 

====The Housedove====

&quot;The Housedove&quot; exploits a popular image from the period: Tichborne sees himself as an innocent dove caught among his fellow conspirators, (see Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; 1.5.48). The &quot;crafty fowler&quot; is probably Sir Francis Walsingham, the spymaster who manipulated the Babington plot.

<text>The Abbey was a short-lived friction drive car assembled by the Abbey Auto Engineering Co. Ltd in Westminster, England. It used a 10.8 hp 1498 cc Coventry-Simplex engine. It was built in 1922 only and cost £315. It also had Marles steering gear and friction drive. The two-seater model sold for £315.

Very few seem to have been made.

After 1922 the car may have been sold as the Lewis.

<doc id="850309" wikidata="Q477756" url="?curid=850309" title="Chick lit">
<text>Chick lit is a term used to describe a type of popular fiction targeted at women. Widely used in the 1990s and 2000s, the term has fallen out of fashion with publishers, while writers and critics have rejected its inherent sexism. Novels identified as chick lit typically address romantic relationships, female friendships, and workplace struggles in humorous and lighthearted ways. Typical protagonists are urban, heterosexual women in their late twenties and early thirties: the 1990s chick lit heroine represented an evolution of the traditional romantic heroine in her assertiveness, financial independence and enthusiasm for conspicuous consumption.

The format developed through the early 1990s on both sides of the Atlantic with books such as Terry McMillan&#x27;s &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot; (1992, US) and Catherine Alliott&#x27;s &quot;The Old Girl Network&quot; (1994, UK). Helen Fielding&#x27;s &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; (1996, UK), wildly popular globally, is the &quot;&quot; of chick lit, while Candace Bushnell&#x27;s (US) 1997 novel &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, adapted to a well-known television program, has huge ongoing cultural influence. By the late 1990s, chick lit titles regularly topped bestseller lists, and many imprints were created devoted entirely to it. By the mid-2000s, commentators noted that its market was increasingly saturated, and by the early 2010s, publishers had largely abandoned the category. Nonetheless, the term &quot;chick lit&quot; persists as a popular category of fiction for both readers and amateur writers on the internet.

While the concept of &quot;chick lit&quot; has become outdated in developed-world English language literature, the term, and regional derivations of it, continue to be widely used to describe and analyse popular women&#x27;s literature in other languages and other parts of the world.

==Origins and derivations of the term==
 
In 1992, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Carolyn See was probably the first to spot that a new style of popular women&#x27;s fiction was emerging. Though she didn&#x27;t use the term chick lit, in a review of Terry McMillan&#x27;s &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot;, the critic noted that McMillan&#x27;s book was not &quot;lofty&quot; or &quot;luminous&quot; but was likely to be highly commercially successful. Carolyn See wrote, &quot;McMillan&#x27;s new work is part of another genre entirely, so new it doesn&#x27;t really have a name yet. This genre has to do with women, triumph, revenge, comradeship.&quot;

Chick lit did not become an established term for a style of novel until the second half of the 1990s. &quot;Chick&quot; is American slang for a young woman, and &quot;lit&quot; is a shortened form of the word &quot;literature.&quot; There was probably no single origin of the term: Princeton University students were reported in 1988 to use chick lit as slang for a course on the Female Literary Tradition and, in the UK, &quot;Oxford Reference&quot; report that the term arose as a &quot;flippant counterpart&quot; to the term &quot;lad lit&quot;. The parallel term used for movies, chick flick, enjoyed slightly earlier uptake. In what was probably one of its first major outings, the term chick lit was deployed ironically: &quot;Chick Lit: Postfeminist Fiction&quot; was a 1995 anthology of 22 short stories written in response to editors Cris Mazza&#x27;s and Jeffrey DeShell&#x27;s call for &quot;postfeminist writing.&quot; Early use of the term was heavily associated with journalism (both &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; and &quot;Sex in the City&quot; began as newspaper columns) and James Wolcott&#x27;s 1996 article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Hear Me Purr,&quot; co-opted the term chick lit to proscribe what he called the trend of &quot;girlishness&quot; evident in the writing of female newspaper columnists at that time.

In the early years, there was some variation on the exact term used: in 2000, the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported the birth of a &quot;publishing phenomenon&quot; that can be called &quot;chick fiction.&quot;

At the peak of the term&#x27;s popularity, a slew of related sub-genres were proposed with similar names chick lit jr (for young readers), mommy lit, and chick lit in corsets (historical fiction, and a term only found in one academic paper published in the Journal of Popular Romance Studies). The relationship with the term lad lit is more complicated: lad lit arose in the UK separately from, and possibly before, chick lit. Later, the term lad lit was adopted in the US for a male-oriented subgenre of chick lit (see lad lit). Of these parallel terms, mommy lit, and lad lit are the only terms to have enjoyed any significant uptake - and that a tiny fraction of the use of the primary term chick lit.

Other derivations of the term chick lit have been used to describe varieties of popular women&#x27;s literature in different regions, or targeted at specific ethnic communities. In the US this has included &quot;Sistah lit&quot; targeted at black readers and &quot;Chica lit&quot; for Latina readers. In India the term &quot;Ladki Lit&quot; has been used (see below). In Turkey, &quot; literature&quot; is a category (&quot;çıtır&quot; literally means &#x27;crispy&#x27;, but is colloquialy used to refer to attractive young women)

==Writers and critics==
Controversy over chick lit focused at first on the literary value of books identified or promoted as part of the genre. Over time, controversy has focused more on the term itself, and whether the concept of a chick lit genre is inherently sexist.

In 1998, reviewer Alex Kuczynski, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, condemned Helen Fielding&#x27;s &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot;, writing: &quot;Bridget is such a sorry spectacle, wallowing in her man-crazed helplessness, that her foolishness cannot be excused.&quot; In 2001, writer Doris Lessing deemed the genre &quot;instantly forgettable&quot; while Beryl Bainbridge called chick lit &quot;a froth sort of thing&quot;. Author Jenny Colgan immediately fired back at Lessing and Bainbridge, explaining why, for a new generation of women, chick lit was an important development:

Two years later Colgan had turned strongly against the term chick lit, being the first to state what is now a mainstream position among writers of women&#x27;s popular fiction: she rejected the term &quot;chick lit&quot; while defending the cultural value of her work. She observed, &quot;Chick-lit is a deliberately condescending term they use to rubbish us all. If they called it slut-lit it couldn&#x27;t be any more insulting.&quot; Much of the debate at this time was between different generations of women writers: for example, Maureen Dowd (b.1952) described the younger women&#x27;s work as &quot;all chick and no lit,&quot; while Colgan (b.1972) derided the older, female critics of chick lit as &quot;hairy-leggers.&quot; There was a &quot;troubling&quot; lack of solidarity.

In 2005, debate continued with the publication of editor Elizabeth Merrick&#x27;s anthology of women&#x27;s fiction, &quot;This Is Not Chick Lit&quot; (2005), where Merrick argued in her introduction that &quot;Chick lit&#x27;s formula numbs our senses.&quot; In response, self-identifying chick-lit author Lauren Baratz-Logsted published her own anthology of stories &quot;This Is Chick Lit&quot; whose project was &quot;born out of anger&quot; and aimed to prove that chick lit was not all &quot;Manolos and cosmos, and cookie-cutter books about women juggling relationships and careers in the new millennium,&quot; but rather that the genre deals with &quot;friendship and laughter, love and death - i.e. the stuff of life.&quot;

In 2007, Diane Shipley came to the genre&#x27;s defence, arguing that chick lit books increasingly covered serious topics but, anyway, &quot;I just don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s morally or intellectually wrong with reading a book you enjoy and relate to, that might not draw deep conclusions about the future of humanity but might cheer you up after a bad day, or see you through your own health problems.&quot;

However, in general through the late 2000s and 2010s writers of women&#x27;s popular fiction increasingly distanced themselves from the term chick lit, while arguing that blanket critical dismissals of their work were rooted in sexism. For example, in a 2010 &quot;Guardian&quot; article, humor writer DJ Connell leads with changing her writing name from Diane to DJ to avoid the chick lit label. Sophie Kinsella and Marian Keyes, two authors who have enjoyed huge success through and beyond the chick lit era, both now reject the term. Kinsella refers to her own work as &quot;romantic comedy&quot;. Keyes said of the term in 2014,
== Publishers ==
In 2000, &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; described the &quot;publishing phenomenon&quot; of what it called &quot;chicfic,&quot; books with &quot;Covers [that] are candy-bright, heavy in pink and fluorescence. The titles are also candy-bright, hinting at easy digestion and a good laugh... ...Such books are positioned in a marketplace as hybrids of the magazine article, fictional or fictionalised, television...and comfort food digestible over a single night at home.&quot;

Through the 2000s publishers continued to push the subgenre because sales continued to be high. In 2003, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; reported on numerous new chick lit imprints, such as, &quot;Kensington&#x27;s &quot;Strapless&quot;, which launched in April 2003 and has one book a month scheduled through the end of 2004. Kensington editorial director John Scognamiglio explained that the imprint was created in response to requests from salespeople for a chick lit brand.&quot; Nonetheless, the same &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; article was already looking back enviously at the massive sales achieved by &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; in 1998 and commenting on the challenges for chick lit publishers in a now-overcrowded market. Already, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; suggested, chick lit was - if not in decline - at least at a turning point.

In 2008, editor Sara Nelson stated that the definition of what&#x27;s considered to be within the genre of chick lit has become more accomplished and &quot;grown up&quot;.

By 2012 news sources were reporting the death of chick lit. Salon.com reported that &quot;Because chick lit (whatever it is - or was) provoked so many ideologically fraught arguments about the values placed on women&#x27;s vs. men&#x27;s tastes, high- vs. lowbrow culture, comedy vs. drama and so on, it&#x27;s tempting to read particular significance into its decline,&quot; but went on to argue that the decline was due to a normal process of changing fashion and taste in genre fiction.

==Chick lit online==
The development and decline of chick lit as a publishing phenomenon coincided with an explosion in internet usage in the developed world. The academic Sandra Folie argues that &quot;Fans and their websites or blogs, online presences of newspapers, magazines, or publishing houses, and also the free encyclopedia Wikipedia&quot; played a key part in defining and shaping the concept of a chick lit genre. Folie discusses the British site &quot;chicklit.co.uk&quot; which was online from 2002 to 2014 and included information not just on books and authors but also lifestyle issues for young women. The American &quot;Chicklitbooks.com&quot; was online from 2003 to 2013 discussing, &quot;Hip, bright literature for today&#x27;s modern woman.&quot; As chick lit declined as a publishing category fans online created their own response: in 2012 a website called &quot;chicklitisnotdead.com&quot; was reported to have 25,000 users. In 2022 an active chick lit community group on the goodreads.com site had 4,756 members.

==Chick lit globally==
Though chick lit originated in the UK and U.S., it rapidly became a global publishing phenomenon - and indeed may have been one of the first truly global publishing trends.

===Saudi Arabia===

In a book published in 2011, and in an article in Le Monde Diplomatique, academic Madawi Al-Rasheed discussed the emergence of Saudi &quot;chick lit&quot; over the preceding decade. Highlighting books from Saudi women authors including Raja Alsanea (Girls of Riyadh) and Samar al-Muqrin, Al-Rasheed characterises the books - which were first published in the more liberal Lebanon - as &quot;novels that deal with women as active sexual agents.. ..rather than submissive victims of patriarchal society.&quot; 

&quot;Girls of Riyadh&quot; has been published in English and is still in print in 2023; Publishers Weekly summarises the book as describing, &quot;Four upper-class Saudi Arabian women [who] negotiate the clash between tradition and the encroaching West in this debut novel by 25-year-old Saudi Alsanea. Though timid by American chick lit standards, it was banned in Saudi Arabia for its scandalous portrayal of secular life.&quot; The book is widely distributed, being sold in stores from U.S. to Europe. In the reader&#x27;s guide to novel, Alsanea notes that she wants to enable her Western readers to connect with Saudi culture, seeing that the girls in the novel had the &#x27;same dreams, emotions, and goals&#x27; as them.

===India===

In India, Rajashree&#x27;s &quot;Trust Me&quot; was the biggest-selling Indian chick lit novel. The popularity of novels like &quot;Trust Me&quot;, Swati Kaushal&#x27;s &quot;Piece of Cake&quot; can be seen in the context of the rise of regional varieties of chick lit. In an interview with the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Helen Fielding said, &quot;I think it had far more to do with zeitgeist than imitation.&quot; If the chick lit explosion has &quot;led to great new female writers emerging from Eastern Europe and India, then it&#x27;s worth any number of feeble bandwagon jumpers.&quot; Sunaina Kumar wrote in the &quot;Indian Express&quot;, &quot;Ten years after the publication of &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot;, the genre of fiction most recognisable for its pink cover art of stilettos, martini glasses and lipsticks, is now being colourfully infused with bindis, saris, and bangles.&quot; Indian chick lit is sometimes referred to as &#x27;ladki-lit&#x27;.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, chick lit in translation is categorised as &quot;Literatura de mulherzinha.&quot; &quot;-inha&quot; is the Portuguese diminutive form, so this means, literally, &quot;little-women&#x27;s literature.&quot; One Brazilian commentator notes, &quot;The diminutive is not by accident. Just as its not by accident that the covers of books by women writers are usually, stereotypically feminine. With covers that suggest a light and romantic, commercial plot.. ...books by female authors arrive to the a reader with a series of biases which ensure that these authors remain on the cultural bottom rung.&quot;

<text>Royal Air Force Manston or more simply RAF Manston is a former Royal Air Force station located in the north-east of Kent, at on the Isle of Thanet from 1916 until 1996. The site was split between a commercial airport Kent International Airport (KIA), since closed, and a continuing military use by the Defence Fire Training and Development Centre (DFTDC), following on from a long-standing training facility for RAF firefighters at the RAF Manston base.

==History==

===First World War===
At the outset of the First World War, the Isle of Thanet was equipped with a small and precarious landing strip for aircraft at St Mildreds Bay, Westgate, on top of the chalk cliffs, at the foot of which was a promenade which had been used for seaplane operations.

The landing grounds atop the cliff soon became the scene of several accidents, with at least one plane seen to fail to stop before the end of the cliffs and tumble into the sea which, fortunately for the pilot, had been on its inward tide.

In the winter of 1915–1916 these early aircraft first began to use the open farmlands at Manston as a site for emergency landings. Thus was soon established the Admiralty Aerodrome at Manston. It was not long after this that the training school, set up originally to instruct pilots in the use of the new Handley-Page O/400 bombers, was established, and so by the close of 1916 there were already two distinct units stationed at Manston, the Operational War Flight Command and the Handley Page Training School.

Its location near the Kent coast gave Manston some advantages over the other previously established aerodromes and regular additions in men and machinery were soon made, particularly, in these early days, from Detling. By 1917 the Royal Flying Corps was well established and taking an active part in the defence of England.

At a time when Zeppelin raids were bringing the war directly to English civilians, daylight bombing raids by German &#x27;Gotha&#x27; Bombers, a twin engined biplane, would have been considerably more effective were it not for the RFC&#x27;s presence at Manston.

The German air raids had lasted for thirteen weeks, the last being on 22 August 1917. On this occasion, of the 15 bombers that set out for England five did not reach the Kent coast, and the &#x27;spirited&#x27; intervention from Manston-based fighters prevented those remaining from flying further west, three being destroyed outright and the remaining seven returning to Germany with dead and wounded on board.

Shortly after such formation raids and in consequence the Cabinet recommended the creation of a separate Air Ministry. The RAF was officially formed on 1 April 1918.

===Second World War===
At the start of the Second World War, Manston hosted a School of Air Navigation but this was quickly moved out. On 10 September 1939, No. 3 Squadron RAF flew in equipped with Hawker Hurricanes and Manston was put under the command of No. 11 Group Fighter Command. No. 235 and No. 253 Squadron RAF both arrived on 30 October 1939 and stayed until October 1940. No. 79 Squadron arrived on 12 November 1939.

During an eventful Battle of Britain, Manston was heavily bombed; at its height (August 1940) diary entries recorded a steady stream of damage to aircraft and buildings. The station was also littered with unexploded bombs. This caused many staff to move to nearby woods for at least a week. Others were dispersed to surrounding housing. For example, WAAFs (members of the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force) stationed at Manston were billeted at the nearby Ursuline Convent in Westgate-on-Sea.

In May 1943, Manston was used in the testing of Barnes Wallis&#x27; prototype bouncing bomb. Pilots from No. 617 Squadron flew to Manston to have inert mines loaded into their Lancaster bombers, which they then dropped at Reculver to prepare for the Dambusters raid; the first tests were carried out on 11 May, with further tests across the following days. A prototype is on public display at the RAF Manston History Museum.

Hawker Typhoon attack aircraft were based at Manston later in the war, and also No. 616 Squadron RAF, the first Meteor jet squadron, arriving 21 July 1944 and staying until 21 January 1945. Manston was used as one of the departure points for military gliders of the Glider Pilot Regiment to transport troops and equipment in Operation Market Garden. It was one of the few airfields installed with the Fog, Intensive, Dispersal Of (FIDO) system designed to remove fog from airfields by burning it off with petrol.

Along with RAF Carnaby and RAF Woodbridge, Manston was developed as a east coast emergency landing ground for bomber crews. These airfields were intended for use by returning bombers suffering from low-fuel and/or suspected damage to their pneumatic (wheel brake) and/or hydraulic (undercarriage) systems. All three airfields were equipped with a single runway, (long and wide. There was a further clear area of at each end of the runway. At each of the three airfields, the runway was divided into three lanes. The northern and central lanes were allocated by flying control, while the southern lane was the emergency lane on which any aircraft could land without first making contact with the airfield.

The hilltop site was chosen as it was usually fog-free and had no approach obstructions. Being close to the front line, the airfield became something of a magnet for badly damaged aircraft that had suffered from ground fire, collisions, or air attack but retained a degree of airworthiness. The airfield became something of a &quot;graveyard&quot; for heavy bombers. The museums on site display some startling aerial views dating from this era and the post-war years. After the war, the runway was reconfigured, being reduced to in width with a full-length parallel taxiway, both within the original paved width.

=== USAF use ===

During the Cold War of the 1950s the United States Air Force used RAF Manston as a Strategic Air Command base for its bomber, fighter and fighter-bomber units.

In the early 1950s, SAC&#x27;s backbone bombers were the Convair B-36 Peacemaker and Boeing B-47 Stratojet. To support this strategy, the SAC 7th Air Division was established in May 1951. At the time, Manston had only partially recovered from the ravages of the Second World War. There were still makeshift bomb shelters, i.e. trenches with tin roofs, and many large circles of lush green grass where Luftwaffe bombs had cratered the runway. The RAF control tower overlooked a bizarre hilltop runway, which was an extraordinary wide and long. The 7th AD expanded Manston by building concrete bunkers suitable for nuclear weapons and upgrading the support facilities for long-term use.

By the summer of 1953, the 7th AD began a series of temporary deployments of B-47 and B-36 wings from the United States to the United Kingdom. These deployments generally involved about 45 aircraft, together with about 20 Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighters which were maintained at the English bases for 90 days. At the end of the Temporary Duty (TDY), they were relieved by another SAC wing that was generally stationed at a different airfield. These deployments continued until 1955 when SAC shifted its rotational deployments to RAF Fairford and Manston was turned over to the United States Air Forces in Europe.

In July 1951 SAC deployed the 12th Fighter-Escort Wing to Manston to provide fighter escort for its rotational bombardment wings. The 12th, however, only remained at Manston until 30 November when it was replaced by the 123rd Fighter-Bomber Wing, with the 12th being transferred to Japan for combat duty during the Korean War.

The 123rd was an umbrella wing that was formed from several Air National Guard squadrons activated for federal service during the Korean War. This wing was activated at Manston with three ANG fighter squadrons:

* 156th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (North Carolina ANG)
* 165th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (Kentucky ANG)
* 167th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (West Virginia ANG)

The 123d utilized the F-84E &quot;Thunderjets&quot; left behind by the 12th FEW and continued the same mission of fighter escort of SAC&#x27;s bombers.

In July 1952 the Air National Guard squadrons were returned to State control, and USAFE assumed the fighter escort role. In its place, the 406th Fighter-Bomber Wing was activated in place at Manston with the following squadrons assigned:

* 512th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (Yellow Stripe)
* 513th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (Red Stripe)
* 514th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (Dark Blue Stripe)

Initially, the 406th utilized the existing F-84Es, however in August 1953, the F-86F &quot;Sabre&quot; began to arrive to replace them.
A change of mission for the 406th in April 1954 from fighter-bomber to fighter-interceptor came with a change of equipment. The F-86D Sabre interceptor began to arrive and the F-86F&#x27;s were transferred to other USAFE squadrons and NATO countries. In addition, the 512th FBS was transferred to Soesterberg Air Base, Netherlands with their F-86Fs.

In June F-86D&#x27;s arrived from CONUS to equip the 87th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron which was transferred to the 406th from the 81st FBW assigned to RAF Shepherds Grove. The 87th FIS, however, physically remained at Shepherds Grove, but was under the organisational command of the 406th at Manston. In September 1955, the 87th was redesignated the 512th FIS.

On 15 May 1958 the 406th was inactivated, with its three air defence squadrons being assigned to continental Europe under the 86th Air Division (Defense) at Ramstein Air Base West Germany. The squadrons were transferred to the following bases:

* 512th FIS to Sembach Air Base, West Germany
* 513th FIS to Phalsbourg-Bourscheid Air Base France
* 514th FIS to Ramstein Air Base, West Germany

The F-86D&#x27;s were eventually withdrawn from Europe in 1961, and the 512th, 513th and 514th were inactivated.

After the transfer of the USAFE interceptors at Manston the base was returned to the RAF control.

=== Return to RAF use ===
With the USAF&#x27;s withdrawal from Manston, the airfield became a joint civilian and RAF airport from 1960 and was thence employed for occasional package tour and cargo flights, alongside its continuing role as an RAF base. The Air Cadets used the northern side of the airfield as a gliding site, and No. 1 Air Experience Flight RAF flying de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunks was also based there. Thanks to its long runway, Manston was designated as one of the UK&#x27;s MEDAs (Military Emergency Diversion Airfields) for emergency military and civilian landings. Others included RAF Greenham Common, RAF Aldergrove and RAF Machrihanish.

For a number of years, the base operated as a Master Diversion Airfield, open 24 hours every day. Manston, uniquely in the UK, also had a &#x27;foam carpet&#x27; crash landing system, where two tractors would pull tankers laying a metre thick layer of foam over a strip of runway, for aircraft with landing gear problems.

===Search and rescue base===

RAF Manston was home to a helicopter search and rescue (SAR) flight from No. 22 Squadron RAF from 1961, operating Westland Whirlwind aircraft. The flight was withdrawn in 1969, but the outcry led to the RAF contracting Bristow Helicopters from 1971 to 1974 to provide a continued service (also using MK3 Whirlwhinds). In 1972, the Bristow crew was awarded the &quot;Wreck Shield&quot; for &quot;Most Meritorious Rescue in 1972&quot; by the Department of Trade and Industry.

In 1974, the RAF SAR teams returned, with No. 72 Squadron RAF operating two Westland Wessex HC2 aircraft to replace the Bristow cover. The flight was transferred back to No. 22 Squadron in June 1976. In 1988 No. 202 Squadron RAF moved to Manston with their Westland Sea King HAR.3, with the Wessex aircraft moving to RAF Coltishall. The Sea Kings remained at Manston until July 1994, when SAR activity at the base was halted, and SAR cover for the channel relocated to RAF Wattisham.

===Units===

The following units were here at some point:
==Civilian use==
For some years two commercial airlines operated out of Manston, Invicta Airways and Air Ferry. Many thousands of holiday passengers started their journeys from Manston.

From 1989 Manston became styled as Kent International Airport, and a new terminal was officially opened that year by the Duchess of York.

==Closure==

In 1996, Manston&#x27;s satellite station RAF Ash, was closed, and in 1999, it was decided to close the RAF Manston base. The &#x27;airside&#x27; portion of the base was signed over to the commercial operator of Kent International Airport.

The MoD decided to keep the central fire training school (CTE) facility open, and almost the entirety of the &#x27;domestic&#x27; side of the base became FSCTE Manston (Fire Service Central Training Establishment). In 2007 the Army took over responsibility for firefighting across the armed services (except the Royal Navy whose Aircraft Handling Branch are the fire fighters at Naval Air Stations and are trained at RNAS Culdrose at the School of Flight Deck Operations) and the school became the Defence Fire Training and Development Centre (DFTDC). The site is set to be closed in 2025.

==Accidents==
* On 18 September 1948, an RAF de Havilland Mosquito crashed during an air show at RAF Manston, killing both crew and ten members of the public.
* On 27 April 1952, an American Republic F-84E Thunderjet (Serial Number 49-2111), of 165 Fighter Bomber Squadron, 1323 Fighter Bomber Group, United States Air Force, that was based at Manston crashed at nearby St Peter&#x27;s, Kent as a result of an engine fire. The pilot, Captain Clifford Vincent Fogarty, was killed, as were three residents of St Peter&#x27;s.
* As a Master Diversion Airfield, RAF Manston witnessed numerous emergency landings both civil and military. Any aircraft reporting undercarriage problems would be diverted to Manston. All aircraft landed successfully on the foam carpet with reduced or no undercarriage, and no injuries or fatalities were ever reported by the Civil Aviation Authority.

== Museums ==

There are currently two museums on the former RAF Manston site, in a cluster on the north side :
* The RAF Manston History Museum
* The Spitfire and Hurricane Memorial Museum

A third museum in the cluster, the Manston Fire Museum within the DFTDC site, is now closed.

==Air show==
RAF Manston and the Spitfire and Hurricane museums used to host an air show, which was most recently in 2011.

==Popular culture==

===Film and TV===

RAF Manston was used as the effects of what will happen in the surrounding towns of Canterbury and Rochester if a nuclear strike by the Soviet Union happened in the Oscar winning 1965 film &quot;The War Game&quot;.

===Video games===
In the vehicular combat multiplayer video game &quot;War Thunder&quot;, the &#x27;Britain&#x27; map centers around RAF Manston. The map itself is based on the southeast coast of England, depicting just under half of the county of Kent, the Strait of Dover, and a small part of France (in the southeast corner of the map, usually well outside the playable area). Although the details of the map are not completely accurate in some areas, dimensionally the map, as well as RAF Manston, and other landmarks such as Dover Castle and the Port of Dover, are a 1:1 scale.

<text>Gerald Peter Remy (November 8, 1952 – October 30, 2021) was an American professional baseball player and sports broadcaster. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a second baseman for ten seasons—three with the California Angels (1975–1977) and seven with the Boston Red Sox (1978–1984). After retiring from professional play, Remy was a color commentator for televised Red Sox games for 33 years until his death.

Remy began commentating with the TV channel New England Sports Network (NESN) in 1988, and later expanded to over-the-air television in 1995. A native of Somerset, Massachusetts, Remy was a popular local figure, known for his exuberance, humorous non-sequitur game commentary, and thick New England accent that endeared him with Red Sox fans. He was given the nickname &quot;RemDawg&quot; and was elected &quot;President&quot; of Red Sox Nation in 2007. Remy also owned restaurants in the Boston area, and wrote books about baseball.

==Early life==
Gerald Peter Remy was born in Fall River, Massachusetts, on November 8, 1952, and grew up in nearby Somerset. He attended Somerset High School and Roger Williams University in Bristol, Rhode Island. He was of French Canadian descent.

==Playing career==
Remy was selected by the Washington Senators in the 19th round of the 1970 MLB draft, but he did not sign. He was then selected in the 8th round of the January supplemental phase of the 1971 MLB draft (129th overall) by the California Angels, and signed with the team.

===Minor leagues (1971–1974)===
Remy played four seasons in the Angels&#x27; farm system: 1971 with the rookie league Magic Valley Cowboys, 1972 with the Class A Stockton Ports, 1973 with the Class A Quad City Angels (.335, 4 home runs and 36 RBI in 117 games), and 1974 with Double-A El Paso Diablos and the Triple-A Salt Lake City Angels, where he hit a combined .323 with 4 home runs and 67 RBI. Overall, Remy appeared in 421 games in Minor League Baseball, batting .275 with 12 home runs and 152 RBIs.

===California Angels (1975–1977)===
Remy made his major league debut with the Angels on April 7, 1975. He hit a single off of Steve Busby of the Kansas City Royals in his first at bat and was subsequently picked off. With the 1975 Angels, Remy played 147 games (145 starts) as the Angels&#x27; second baseman, batting .258 with one home run and 46 RBIs. He had 34 stolen bases, but was caught stealing a league-leading 21 times. The following year, his average rose slightly to .263, although with no home runs and 28 RBIs. In 1977, he had a career-high four home runs, along with a .252 average and 44 RBIs; he was named team captain of the Angels in June, becoming only the second captain in the team&#x27;s history.

Overall, in three seasons with the Angels, Remy played in 444 games, batting .258 with five home runs, 118 RBIs, and 110 stolen bases. On December 8, 1977, he was traded to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for pitcher Don Aase and cash considerations.
===Boston Red Sox (1978–1984)===
Remy was the Red Sox&#x27;s starting second baseman in 1978 and was selected for the MLB All-Star Game, although he did not play in the game. Overall, with the 1978 Red Sox, he batted .278 with 44 RBIs and 30 stolen bases in 148 games. He also had two home runs, the last ones of his career. In the 1978 American League East tie-breaker game against the New York Yankees, Remy was on base in the ninth inning when Carl Yastrzemski made the final out; it was the closest Remy came to the postseason in his MLB career.

Remy continued as Boston&#x27;s starting second baseman for the next six seasons, although he was often hampered by injuries. In 1979, he played in 80 games and batted .297. In 1980, he batted a career-high .313 but was limited to 63 games; he also appeared in the outfield for the only time in his career, playing the ninth inning in right field during a May loss to the Cleveland Indians. In 1981, Remy played in 88 games while batting .307. On September 3–4, 1981, he accomplished the rare feat of collecting six hits in a game, going 6-for-10 in a 20-inning game against the Seattle Mariners.

In 1982, Remy appeared in a career-high 155 games while batting .280; in 1983, he batted .275 while playing in 146 games. In 1984, a knee injury limited him to 30 games for the season, during which he batted .250; he made his final start at second base on May 5, and his final MLB appearance on May 18 when he flied out as a pinch hitter. Remy was released by the Red Sox on December 10, 1985, and he retired during spring training in 1986. Overall, in seven seasons with the Red Sox, Remy played in 710 games, batting .286 with two home runs, 211 RBIs, and 98 stolen bases.

During his ten-year MLB career, Remy batted .275 with seven home runs, 329 RBIs, and 208 stolen bases in 1154 games. Defensively, he had a .981 fielding percentage. Bill James, in his &quot;Historical Abstract&quot;, rated Remy as the 100th greatest second baseman of all time as of 2001.

==Post-playing career==

===Broadcaster===

After 1988, Remy found success in broadcasting, working for the New England Sports Network (NESN), as the regular color commentator for NESN&#x27;s Red Sox broadcasts. Initially paired with Ned Martin through 1992 and Bob Kurtz from 1993–2000, from 2001 through the end of the 2015 season, he teamed with play-by-play announcer Don Orsillo; starting with the 2016 season, Remy worked with Dave O&#x27;Brien. Beginning in 1995, he also replaced former color commentator Bob Montgomery on the over-the-air Red Sox broadcasting team, paired with Sean McDonough for those broadcasts through 2004, when Orsillo took over for McDonough on the over-the-air games as well. He also ran a website, The Remy Report, which covered Boston Red Sox news and information.

===Restaurateur===

Remy owned a hot dog stand, RemDawg&#x27;s, a nod to the nickname he held amongst Red Sox fans, located just outside Fenway Park, as well as Jerry Remy&#x27;s Sports Bar &amp; Grill in Terminal C of Logan International Airport. There were three other Bar &amp; Grill locations: one behind Fenway Park on Boylston Street that opened March 9, 2010, which was reported closed in March 2015, and subsequently became a Tony C’s Sports Bar &amp; Grill (named after another former Red Sox player, Tony Conigliaro); a second in the Seaport District of South Boston, which in December 2016 also became a Tony C’s Sports Bar &amp; Grill; and a third in Remy&#x27;s birthplace of Fall River that opened in October 2012, which in March 2018, &quot;The Herald News&quot; of Fall River reported would be closed.

===Author===
Remy wrote three books about baseball, and several children&#x27;s books about Red Sox mascot Wally the Green Monster, which began as an idea based on Remy&#x27;s storytelling while broadcasting Red Sox games.

;Wally the Green Monster series

* 

In 2012, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Fenway Park, then-Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia authored a sixth book in the series, &quot;Wally The Green Monster&#x27;s Journey Through Time&quot;.

==Charity work==
Remy worked extensively with The Jimmy Fund, a charity that supports the Dana–Farber Cancer Institute. He was known to invite cancer patients in the broadcast booth, visit with patients in hospitals, and participated in their annual telethon.

==Health==
In November 2008, Remy had surgery to remove a &quot;very small, low-grade cancerous area&quot; from his lung, most likely a result of years of smoking cigarettes. During his recovery from the surgery, he suffered from an infection as well as a bout of pneumonia. Due to fatigue and depression, Remy took an indefinite leave of absence from his broadcast duties for NESN, starting April 30, 2009.

On August 12, 2009, Remy went to Fenway Park and attended Red Sox manager Terry Francona&#x27;s pre-game press conference. He told both NESN and &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; that he had every intention of returning to broadcasting Red Sox games during the remainder of the 2009 season. He entered the NESN&#x27;s broadcast booth during the top of the second inning during the night&#x27;s game to speak with broadcasters Don Orsillo and Dennis Eckersley. It was the first time he had been in the booth since he took his leave of absence in April. In between the top and the bottom of the second inning, Remy, still in the booth, was shown on Fenway&#x27;s center field scoreboard display, to which he received a standing ovation from the crowd attending the game. He revealed during the visit that he had suffered from depression following his physical problems of 2008 and that he was receiving therapy. On August 19, 2009, Remy released a statement announcing his return to commentating on August 21, 2009, against the New York Yankees. He stated that he would likely skip some road trips. He returned full-time for the 2010 baseball season. In April 2013, he announced that he had suffered a relapse that offseason when cancer was found in a different spot on his lungs during his regular six-month CT scan that January.

Remy took time off starting May 28, 2013, due to a bout of pneumonia. He returned to the booth on June 25, 2013. On August 16, 2013, he announced that he would be taking an indefinite leave of absence after his son was arrested for murder; Remy did not return to the broadcast booth until the beginning of the 2014 season. He had another leave during the 2016–17 off-season, missing most of the 2017 spring training.

On June 12, 2017, Remy announced that his lung cancer had returned. In January 2018, he announced via Twitter that he had completed treatments at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). A fourth diagnosis of cancer was announced on August 7, 2018. After undergoing treatments, Remy announced in early November 2018 that he was cancer-free.

On June 11, 2021, Remy left Fenway Park during the third inning of a game he was commentating on, due to shortness of breath, and was admitted to MGH. He was released from the hospital five days later, and returned to broadcasting on June 20. On August 4, Remy announced that he would be stepping away from NESN for lung cancer treatment. On October 5, he appeared at Fenway Park to throw out the ceremonial first pitch before the AL Wild Card Game, in what ended up being his final public appearance.

Remy died of lung cancer on October 30, 2021, aged 68. A public wake was held in Waltham, Massachusetts, on November 4.

==Legacy==

Remy and broadcast partner Don Orsillo won four New England Emmy awards, and Remy was voted Massachusetts&#x27; favorite sports announcer in 2004 by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. Remy was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2006, and elected honorary President of Red Sox Nation in 2007. NESN and the Red Sox celebrated Jerry Remy Day at Fenway Park on June 24, 2008, in honor of Remy&#x27;s 20 years of service for the network. He was inducted into the Massachusetts Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 2017.

After his death, Joe Buck, veteran sports broadcaster, called Remy&#x27;s sports broadcasting career &quot;legendary&quot; and called him a &quot;force in the booth&quot;, noting &quot;If Red Sox Nation had an emperor, the ‘RemDawg,’ it would be him.&quot; Broadcaster Sean McDonough, who of his own accord has worked with at least 160 different broadcast partners, said of his time with Remy: &quot;nothing felt as special as the nine years I spent with Jerry&quot;.

On April 15, 2022, the date of the home opener for the season, the team issued a Tweet showing that the NESN broadcasting booth at Fenway Park was now named the Jerry Remy Booth, in his memory. The booth has also been adorned with a memorial plaque honoring Remy. The team held a ceremony to honor Remy prior to their home game of April 20, including appearances from former teammates Dennis Eckersley, Carl Yastrzemski, Rick Burleson, Dwight Evans, Fred Lynn, Jim Rice, and Bob Stanley.

==Family==
Remy and his wife Phoebe had three children, Jared, Jordan, and Jenna.

Jordan was selected by the Red Sox in the 49th round of the 1999 MLB draft, but he did not play professionally.

Jared worked for the Red Sox as a security guard, but was fired in 2008 after another guard told the State Police that Jared had sold him steroids. On August 16, 2013, Jared was arrested in the fatal stabbing of his girlfriend, Jennifer Martel, a charge he pleaded guilty to on May 27, 2014. Jared Remy was sentenced to life in state prison without the possibility of parole.

<doc id="850320" wikidata="Q7760940" url="?curid=850320" title="Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer">
<text>The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer () is a private ritual, authored by Rudyard Kipling, in which students about to graduate from an engineering program at a university in Canada are permitted to participate. Participation may also be permitted for Canadian professional engineers or have otherwise qualified academically for registration as a professional engineer (such as through technical examinations). The ritual is administered by a body called The Corporation of the Seven Wardens. As part of the ritual each participant is conferred the Iron Ring.

==History==

The ritual traces its origins to professor H. E. T. Haultain of the University of Toronto, who believed and persuaded other members of the Engineering Institute of Canada that there needed to be a ceremony and standard of ethics developed for graduating engineers. This was in response to the Quebec Bridge Disaster in which 75 workmen died due to faulty engineering calculations and miscommunication. The ritual was created in 1922 by Rudyard Kipling at the request of Haultain, representing seven past-presidents of the Engineering Institute of Canada. The seven past-presidents were the original seven wardens of the corporation.

An inaugural ceremony was held in the evening of 25 April 1925, at the University Club of Montreal, when the obligation was taken by six engineers, some of whom were involved with Kipling in its development. On 1 May 1925, three of these newly obligated engineers met at the University of Toronto with a number of the officers of the Engineering Alumni Association and obligated 14 of them in the Senate Chamber of the university becoming the first local chapter (referred to as a camp) to do so. Fairbairn met with Harry F. McLean, president of Dominion Construction and Kipling in Montreal at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel to discuss the details of the ritual. Fairbairn later visited McLean at his home in Merrickville, Ontario, to secure a sizeable donation from McLean, philanthropist, on behalf of the Corporation of the Seven Wardens, the custodian and administrator of the ritual, to ensure its survival.

The Ritual and the conferring of the Iron Ring continues to be administered by The Corporation of the Seven Wardens Inc./&quot;Société des Sept Gardiens inc.&quot; through camps associated with the universities granting degrees in engineering in Canada.

==Ritual==
The ritual takes place separately at individual Camps across Canada usually situated near an engineering university. The ceremonies are separate, organised by one of 28 camps of the Corporation of the Seven Wardens for administrative purposes.

The Obligation, which is not an oath but a solemn expression of intention, is subscribed to at the ceremony. The Obligation essentially states the duties and responsibilities of the engineer. Following the Obligation, the Iron Ring is placed on the little finger of the working hand, and is worn by the engineer as a symbol and a reminder. As originally conceived, the engineer&#x27;s iron ring rubs against the drawings and paper upon which the Engineer writes and even in modern times, serves as a reminder when working on a computer.

Previously, a biblical passage was quoted: 2 Esdras, Chapter 4, Verses 5–10. More generally today, Kipling&#x27;s poem the &quot;Hymn of Breaking Strain&quot; is recited.

The Obligation is private, though not necessarily secret. However, it is customary for those who have gone through it to not discuss the details of the Calling with others, even engineers from other countries. The ceremony is open only to candidates, those who have already undergone the ritual and at some sites, guests invited by candidates.

As part of the preparation for the ritual, candidates are instructed not to discuss the details of the ritual with the media. A reminder of this is provided at the end of the ceremony in the form of a written instruction that states: &quot;&quot;The Rule of Governance provides that there shall be no publicity in connection with the Ritual.&quot; &quot;

Commemorating the 75th anniversary, the Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer domestic-rate stamp was issued on 25 April 2000. Designer Darrell Freeman&#x27;s &quot;head-to-foot&quot; layout incorporates the symbolic iron ring that is presented as part of the ceremony. The ring also visually links the four engineering achievements featured on this stamp.

The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer has a very simple purpose: To direct the newly qualified engineer toward a consciousness of the profession and its social significance and indicating to the more experienced engineer their responsibilities in welcoming and supporting the newer engineers when they are ready to enter the profession.

The ring symbolizes the pride which engineers have in their profession, while simultaneously reminding them of their humility. The ring serves as a reminder to the engineer and others of the engineer&#x27;s obligation to live by a high standard of professional conduct.

==Iron Ring==
The Iron Ring may be made from either iron or stainless steel. Presently, only Camp One of the Corporation in Toronto continues to confer rings made from iron; stainless steel rings are conferred at all other locations across Canada. The Iron Ring does not certify a person as a Professional Engineer, which requires registration with a relevant professional organisation followed by examination and practical experience.

==Management==
The Corporation of the Seven Wardens (French: &quot;Société des Sept Gardiens&quot;) is the body that holds the rights and the duty to carry out The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer. It is organised into 28 regional branches, called &quot;camps&quot;, numbered by order of establishment. The term &quot;camp&quot; is used to describe these regional branches because it conveys a smaller, close-knit sense of community.

<doc id="850321" wikidata="Q26865" url="?curid=850321" title="Abbott-Detroit">
<text>The Abbott-Detroit was an American luxury automobile manufactured between 1909 and 1919. It was designed by John G. Utz, designer of the Chalmers, who had previously worked for Olds Motor Works and the Autocar Company. Considered powerful and well-designed, the Abbott sported a Continental engine. The cars were guaranteed for life by 1913, when electric lighting and starting had been standardized.

Total production for the 1911 model year was expected to be 3000 cars. By 1916, production of these cars had reached 15 to 20 units a day, so the company moved from Detroit to a larger facility in Cleveland. This proved too stressful on the company&#x27;s finances, and they declared bankruptcy in April 1918.

==Dealerships==
The company opened a dealership in Kansas City, Missouri around June 1910. The newly constructed building was located at 321 Admiral Boulevard, on the southeast corner of Admiral Boulevard and McGee Street. H. F. Worth was the sales manager at the time. His goal was to &quot;place five hundred cars in Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma.&quot;

==Models==
Models that Abbott-Detroit offered included:

*34/45 hp (25/30 kW) Fore Door Roadster
*Limousine (1913 model)
*44/40 hp (33/37 kW) Battleship Roadster
*34 hp (25 kW) Model F
*31 hp (24 kW) Model L
*22 hp (20 kW) Model K
*30 hp Fore Door Roadster ($1500 in 1910)
*30 hp Fore Door Demi Tonneau ($1650 in 1910)

Prices ranged from US$1700 for the Fore Door to US$3050 for the Limousine.

<doc id="850322" wikidata="Q5589739" url="?curid=850322" title="Governor of the Administrative Arrondissement Brussels-Capital">
<text>Until 2014, the governor of the [[Administrative Arrondissement of Brussels-Capital]] (; ) had the responsibility to enforce laws concerned with public order in the Brussels-Capital Region, one of the three regions of Belgium. The governor&#x27;s powers were actually quite limited. Just as the governors of the provinces of Belgium, he headed the coordination of all necessary actions and emergency services during the provincial phase of a disaster on the territory of the Brussels-Capital Region.

The governor of Brussels-Capital should not be confused with either the Minister-President of the Brussels-Capital Region nor with the mayor of the City of Brussels, which is one of the 19 municipalities of Brussels. The governor was appointed by the government of the Brussels-Capital Region on the unanimous advice of the Federal Council of Ministers. The regional government also appointed the vice-governor, who was required to have a considerable knowledge of both French and Dutch and who had a duty to ensure that the legislation regarding the use of languages was observed in the Brussels Region.

The agreement following the 2011 state reform included the removal of this post and it was abolished in 2014. Instead, there is a high official appointed by the Brussels Government.

==List of governors==
*André Degroeve, 1 January 1995 – 30 April 1998
*Raymonde Dury, May 1998 – 13 November 1998
*Véronique Paulus de Châtelet, 22 December 1998 – 1 January 2009

<text>The People&#x27;s Revolutionary Youth Union of Kampuchea was the youth organization of the Khmer People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (which governed Kampuchea/Cambodia during the 1980s). The organization was internationally known by its French name, &quot;Union de la Jeunesse Populaire Révolutionnaire du Kampuchéa&quot; (UJPRK). UJPRK was a member of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. 

UJPRK was a member of the Kampuchean United Front for National Construction and Defense, the front of Kampuchean mass organizations. The role of KUFNCD and UJPRK was established in the Constitution.

UJPRK organized youth between the ages of 15 and 26. It functioned as a school for future members of the KPRP. At the time of the 2nd Congress of the UJPRK in 1987, the organization had more than 50,000 members. A significant portion of the members were within the armed forces.</text><links>

<doc id="850326" wikidata="Q1951190" url="?curid=850326" title="Movement for Democracy (Cape Verde)">
<text>The Movement for Democracy (, MpD) is a Christian democratic and liberal party in Cape Verde. Established in 1990, it was the ruling party from 1991 to 2001 and returned to power in the 2016 parliamentary election. Its members are nicknamed &quot;&quot; (the wind fans) in Portuguese, a reference to the party&#x27;s logo.

==History==
The MpD was established on 14 March 1990 by Carlos Veiga after Prime Minister Pedro Pires of the African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde (PAICV, formerly the sole legal party) allowed its creation. The party was publicly launched in May 1990 and its first convention was held in November 1990.

In the January 1991 parliamentary elections, the first multi-party elections in the country&#x27;s history, the MpD won 56 of the 79 seats in the National Assembly. In the presidential elections the following month, MpD candidate António Mascarenhas Monteiro defeated the incumbent PAICV President Aristides Pereira.

Following the MpD&#x27;s second convention in January 1993, splits developed within the party, with two groups, List A and List B, emerging. A split in 1994 led to the creation of the Democratic Convergence Party. Despite losing six seats, the party retained its parliamentary majority in the 1995 elections, whilst Monteiro was re-elected unopposed in the presidential elections the following year.

The January 2001 parliamentary elections saw the party lose another 20 seats, as it was defeated by the PAICV. In the February 2001 presidential elections the MpD nominated Veiga, but he was defeated by the PAICV&#x27;s Pires by just 12 votes in the second round of voting.

In the 2006 parliamentary elections party lost another seat and was reduced to 29 MPs. Veiga was again defeated by Pires in the presidential elections later in the year.

Despite gaining three seats in the 2011 parliamentary elections, the MpD remained in opposition. However, in the presidential elections in the same year, MpD candidate Jorge Carlos Fonseca defeated the PAICV&#x27;s Manuel Inocêncio Sousa by 54–46%.

In July 2013, Ulisses Correia e Silva, the mayor of the capital, Praia, became party&#x27;s new chairman, following Carlos Veiga, who stepped down after five years.

Fonseca was re-elected as president in the 2016 presidential election. The MpD also won a majority in the National Assembly during the 2016 parliamentary elections, ending fifteen years of PAICV majorities in that body and electing its leader Ulisses Correia e Silva as Prime Minister of Cape Verde.

<text>This List of Ford platforms features automobile platforms developed by Ford Motor Company, its present-day subsidiaries, as well as those shared from subsidiaries from the past (Mazda, Mercury, Volvo, Jaguar, and Land Rover).

Ford announced in 2014 plans to reduce its vehicle platforms from sixteen to nine. In 2014, Ford vehicles were built on fifteen distinct platforms. This only applies to Ford and Lincoln and not to any brands that were previously held by the company (such as Mazda and Volvo), and is expected to cut costs by 20%.

As of there are five global platforms and four regional platforms. The regional platforms are only sold in some continents and not others.

<doc id="850337" wikidata="Q1549779" url="?curid=850337" title="Radical Party of Chile (2018)">
<text>The Radical Party of Chile (), is a classical radical political party in Chile. The party has also been referred to as liberal, social-liberal, and social-democratic.

The party is a member of Socialist International and participant in the Permanent Conference of Political Parties of Latin America and the Caribbean.

== History ==
The party was founded as the Social Democrat Radical Party () on 18 August 1994 out of a union between the Radical Party and the Social Democracy Party, both of which had received poor results in the parliamentary elections. The party re-adopted its historic name in 2018.

The party supported Ricardo Lagos in the 1999–2000 presidential elections, who won 48.0% in the first round and was elected with 51.3% in the second round. At the 2001 legislative elections, the party won as part of the Concertación six out of 120 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and no seats in the Senate. This changed at the 2005 legislative elections to seven and one, respectively. In 2009, it won five congress seats and one senate seat.

== Executive board ==
The current party executive assumed in August 2018.
== Leaders of the PR (1994–present) ==
== Election results ==
Due to its membership in the Concert of Parties for Democracy, the party has endorsed the candidates of other parties on several occasions. Presidential elections in Chile are held using a two-round system, the results of which are displayed below.

<text>ABC was an American high wheeler automobile built by Albert Bledsoe Cole in St. Louis, Missouri, USA, from 1905 to 1910.

Known as the &quot;Autobuggy&quot; from 1906 to 1908, it was sold as &quot;the cheapest high-grade car in America&quot;, and was available with two-cylinder and four-cylinder engines, friction drive, and pneumatic or solid tires. The drive system used a cone and two bevel wheels, one for forward and the other for reverse. This allowed it to reach its top speed in either direction. A larger engine was fitted in 1908, and the wheelbase grew from to . Its high ground clearance made it popular in rural areas.

Later models were more conventional with two- or four-cylinder engines, but the market for high wheelers was disappearing and the company folded in 1910.

<doc id="850347" wikidata="Q16967841" url="?curid=850347" title="Wonkette">
<text>Wonkette is an American online magazine of topical and political gossip, established in 2004 by Gawker Media and founding editor Ana Marie Cox. The editor since 2012 is Rebecca Schoenkopf, formerly of &quot;OC Weekly&quot;. &quot;Wonkette&quot; covers U.S. politics in a satirical manner.

==Launch and history==
&quot;Wonkette&quot; was established in January 2004 as part of the Gawker Media network. Its founding editor was Ana Marie Cox, a former editor at suck.com.

Cox rapidly established a large reading audience and media notice for the site. The blog gained further national media attention after Cox publicized the story of Jessica Cutler aka &quot;Washingtonienne&quot;, a former Hill staffer who blogged about her affair with a member of former Senator Mike DeWine&#x27;s staff.

Cox announced her resignation as &quot;Wonkette&quot;&#x27;s editor on January 5, 2006, in order to promote her book, &quot;Dog Days&quot;, and was succeeded by David Lat, the author of Underneath Their Robes, a blog about the federal judiciary, and Alex Pareene, a young New York University student and &quot;Gawker&quot; intern/guest editor in New York who moved to D.C. for the &quot;Wonkette&quot; position. (In late 2007, Pareene moved to the flagship &quot;Gawker&quot; site and, in April 2010, to Salon.)

In June 2006, Lat announced his decision to leave &quot;Wonkette&quot;. His slot was to be filled by guest editors until August 2006, when longtime political blogger Ken Layne joined as editor. &quot;Wonkette&quot; reached its largest pre-2008 audience during the 2006 midterm elections due to scandal coverage of Mark Foley and other incumbents involved in corruption, sex-abuse and bribery scandals.

After Pareene and Layne&#x27;s departure in October 2007, a team of new editors including John Clarke, Jr. and Megan Carpentier was installed by Gawker management. Gawker publisher Nick Denton brought Layne back as sole editor two months later; Layne put in place the team of Jim Newell of IvyGate, videographer Liz Glover, former Gawker blogger Sara K. Smith, Columbia literary magazine &quot;The Blue and White&quot; editor Juli Weiner, and longtime contributors Princess Sparkle Pony (Peter Huestis) and Josh Fruhlinger, the Comics Curmudgeon.

&quot;Wonkette&quot; teams covered both the Denver DNC and St. Paul RNC conventions. Newell and columnist Josh Fruhlinger covered Barack Obama&#x27;s inauguration in Washington. As with many political websites, readership hit new records between the November 2008 election and January 2009 inauguration.

Past and current guest editors and contributors include &quot;Reason Magazine&quot; editor Nick Gillespie, &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter David Weigel, DCeiver editor and &quot;Huffington Post&quot; writer Jason Linkins, Gawker editor and The Awl founder Choire Sicha, New York comedian and author Sara Benincasa, Chicago artist and journalist Lauri Apple, &quot;Boston Globe&quot; political blogger Garrett Quinn, cartoonist Benjamin Frisch, and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; online writer Juli Weiner.

In April 2011, &quot;Wonkette&quot; came under criticism after blogger Jack Stuef wrote a post that was interpreted as mocking Trig Palin for his having Down syndrome. The post suggested that Trig was possibly the result of incest between Todd Palin and Bristol Palin. In response, at least 14 advertisers, including major companies such as Ford, Toyota, Verizon, Nordstrom, and Papa John&#x27;s, announced that they would exclude their network remnant advertising from Wonkette. Editor Ken Layne announced that Stuef was placed on probation and Stuef apologized for the post.

The name of the site is a play on the slang word &quot;wonk&quot;, meaning a &quot;zealous student of political policy&quot;, adding the feminine ending to best describe founding editor Cox and as a play on the word &quot;gazette.&quot;

===Separation from Gawker Media===
On April 14, 2008, Gawker Media announced that it was selling &quot;Wonkette&quot; and that Layne would remain managing editor and part owner. Gawker Media head Nick Denton attributed the sale to &quot;hunkering down&quot; before another dot com downturn and the Internet bubble bursts: &quot;And, even if not, better safe than sorry; and better too early than too late...&quot; Gawker&#x27;s Silicon Valley gossip site, Valleywag, was merged with the flagship Gawker.com site, its popular music site, Idolator, was sold to Buzznet, and The Consumerist was sold to Consumers Union as part of the same divestiture effort.

Wonkette Media also launched Wonkabout, a D.C. culture guide, which ran from February 12, 2009 until April 28, 2011, and was edited by Arielle Fleisher.

In February, 2017, &quot;Wonkette&quot; went ad-free, and it is now supported by reader donations.

=== Move to Substack ===
In July 2023, Schoenkopf moved &quot;Wonkette&quot; to Substack, retaining its existing URL. She projected that the move would lower the site&#x27;s hosting costs and possibly attract new readers.

== Reception ==
The Bloggies at SXSW selected &quot;Wonkette&quot; as Best Political Blog in 2005, 2006 and 2007. &quot;Wonkette&quot; was chosen as a top political blog by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and &quot;Real Simple&quot; in 2008. &quot;Wonkette&quot; won the Best Liberal Blog category in the 2008 Weblog Awards and is nominated in the humor, politics and group-blog categories in the 2009 and 2010 Bloggies. Items are frequently picked up by national broadcasts including &quot;Colbert Report&quot;, &quot;Wait, Wait Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; and CNN.

Alex Nichols, writing in &quot;The Outline&quot; in 2017, described &quot;Wonkette&quot;, saying, &quot;This is why I love Wonkette, the gossip blog that refuses to die. Wonkette is Bush-era liberalism frozen in amber, motionless and immortal, forced to passively observe a changing world until the end of time. Why does it still exist? Hard to say. But as long as it is here, we must celebrate its inanity.&quot; He wrote, &quot;The site isn&#x27;t an indictment of centrists, the Democratic Party, or neoliberalism. It doesn&#x27;t prove a point about anything, and it isn&#x27;t an example of any trend or political tendency, which makes it all the more baffling ... Wonkette simply exists, and it might outlast us all.&quot;

<text>The Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania (, LDDP) was a political party in Lithuania. It was the successor of the Soviet-era Communist Party of Lithuania. The youth organization of LDDP was called Lithuanian Labourist Youth Union ().

== History ==
The party traced its roots to December 1989, when the majority of the Communist Party of Lithuania broke away from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. CPL (independent) (as it became known after formation of (CPL (CPSU)) took part in the 1990 Lithuanian Supreme Soviet election, in which the party came in second place. Amid this position, CPL (independent) joined the national unity government, which included almost all parties and organisations in the Supreme Council except the CPL (CPSU), Lithuanian Democratic Party (LDP) and the Association of Poles in Lithuania (ZPL). Algirdas Brazauskas became Deputy Prime Minister of Lithuania in the Prunskienė Cabinet.

By the autumn of 1990, there were several new names proposed for the party (etc. &quot;Lietuvos socialistų partija&quot; (Socialist Party of Lithuania), &quot;Lietuvos socialinės pažangos partija&quot; (Social Advancement Party of Lithuania), &quot;Lietuvos komunistų partija&quot; (Communist Party of Lithuania), &quot;Lietuvos demokratinė darbo partija&quot; (Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania)). In December 1990, the main body of the CPL reorganized as the DLPL.

By the late winter of 1992, the party overtook Sąjūdis as the most supported political party in Lithuania. The LDDP won the 1992 parliamentary election, gaining 43% of the vote giving it 73 seats in the Seimas. It is the best results for any political party in Lithuanian parliamentary election up to this date. LDDP was led by Algirdas Brazauskas. Because Brazauskas was elected as the first president in 1993, he was required to stop his activities in any parties. Adolfas Šleževičius became the party leader and the Prime Minister. After Šleževičius was charged with corruption in 1996, he was replaced by Česlovas Juršėnas.

In the 1996 parliamentary election, LDDP got about 9.5% of the votes and won 10 seats in the parliament. In next few years the party&#x27;s support remained relatively steady. The party remained the main opposition party in Seimas, although its member and former Prime Minister Laurynas Mindaugas Stankevičius was Minister of Heath in the Vagnorius Cabinet between 1998 and 1999. Prior to the 2000 parliamentary election, the LDDP formed a coalition with the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, the New Democracy Party and the Union of the Russians of Lithuania. The electoral coalition was named after Algirdas Brazauskas and it won a majority of the votes. In this coalition, parties formed a joint list in the nationwide constituency, but in single-member constituencies the coalition stood only one candidate per constituency to avoid vote splitting. In the elections the LDDP won 26 seats (the largest number of seats among the coalition&#x27;s parties and third largest number of seats in the parliament).

In 2001, LDDP merged with the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania. The merged party took the Social Democratic name, but was dominated by former LDDP members. LDDP&#x27;s name and logo were registered as a trademark, what prevented establishment of party with the same name and logo. Attempts of reviving the LDDP, like the &quot;Democratic Labour and Unity Party&quot; (DDVP) of Brazauskas&#x27; widow or the Social Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania (LSDDP) only had limited success.

== Popular support ==

In the first half of 1990s, LDDP had around twenty per cent support nationally. This support was not uniform – mainly the party had the largest support in large cities with large factories and Russian speaking communities (e. g. Klaipėda). The only exception of large cities was Kaunas, where Sąjūdis (and later the Homeland Union) had greater support. In rural areas, the party&#x27;s support came from districts with developed industry (e. g. Kelmė district).

As Lithuania became a service economy in the late 1990s, the party&#x27;s support declined to around 10%. The other loss of voters came from parties representing Russian speakers (e. g. Union of the Russians of Lithuania). Also, the LDDP lost support to the New Union (Social Liberals).

<doc id="850349" wikidata="Q2163904" url="?curid=850349" title="Wild Style">
<text>Wild Style is a 1983 American hip hop film directed and produced by Charlie Ahearn. Regarded as the first hip hop motion picture, it includes appearances by seminal figures such as Adam Horowitz Fab Five Freddy, Lee Quiñones, Lady Pink, The Rock Steady Crew, The Cold Crush Brothers, Rammellzee with Shockdell, Queen Lisa Lee of Zulu Nation, Grandmaster Flash, and ZEPHYR.

&quot;Wild Style&quot; was shot in 1981, completed in 1982, and released theatrically in 1983. The film was later released on home video by Rhino Home Video in 1997. In 2007, it was released on DVD for the 25th anniversary. A 30th anniversary collector&#x27;s edition was released on Blu-ray in 2012.

==Background==
Fab Five Freddy (Fred Brathwaite) approached Ahearn about making a film focusing on what would become known as hip-hop culture and they began working together in late 1981. The idea was a hybrid of narrative musical and documentary, having hip-hop pioneers play themselves in a loosely scripted story shot entirely in the South Bronx, the Lower East Side, and MTA subway yards. Freddy eventually stepped back from co-writing and co-directing with Ahearn (&quot;Freddy didn’t have the focus at that particular time to write or direct,&quot; Ahearn said), but he helped Chris Stein produce the soundtrack. 
An early version of the &quot;Wild Style&quot; logo appeared in 1981 when Ahearn hired graffiti writer Dondi to paint the &quot;window down&quot; subway car piece that appears in the film. The Dondi piece was the inspiration for the animated title sequence designed by the artist, Zephyr and animated by Joey Ahlbum in 1982. The &quot;Wild Style&quot; mural was painted by Zephyr, Revolt and Sharp in 1983.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Wild Style&quot; centers around a Bronx teenager named Raymond (Lee Quiñones), who under the pseudonym &quot;Zoro&quot; is a celebrated but anonymous graffiti artist. Raymond scorns a group of graffiti artists, known as the Union Crew, who have turned their talents to legitimate, commissioned murals on the walls of playgrounds and business establishments. Their graffiti murals attracted the attention of Virginia (Patti Astor), a journalist, who brings the uptown hip-hop culture to the downtown art world. There are a series of encounters with graffiti artists, rappers and breakers, leading up to a giant rap-break concert in a Lower East Side band shell decorated by Raymond.

== Cast ==

* Lee Quiñones (Lee) as Raymond Zoro
* Frederick Brathwaite (Fab 5 Freddy) as Phade
* Sandra Fabara (Lady Pink) as Rose Lady bug
* Patti Astor as Virginia
* Andrew Witten (Zephyr) as Zroc 
* Carlos Morales as Raymond&#x27;s Brother
* Alfredo Valez as Boy with Broom 
* Niva Kislac as Art Patron 
* Bill Rice as TV Producer
* Joe Lewis as Community Art Organizer
* Glenn O&#x27;Brien as Art Dealer

== Release ==
&quot;Wild Style&quot; premiered as part of the New Directors/New Films Festival at the 57th Street Playhouse in New York on March 18, 1983. Interestingly, the film was shown in theaters in Tokyo the month before it opened at Embassy 46th Street Theatre on Broadway in November 1983. By early 1984, it was being shown in other major cities.

==Reception==
Film critic Vincent Canby wrote for The New York Times that &quot;Wild Style&quot; &quot;never discovers a cinematic rhythm that accurately reflects and then celebrates the rare energy and wit of the artists within the film.&quot; However, he noted that the &quot;subjects are appealing, especially Mr. Quinones, a graffiti artist in real life, and Frederick Brathwaite as a very cool artist promotor.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 90% based on 20 reviews. Phelim O&#x27;Neill of The Guardian noted that despite the low production values, &quot;nothing else comes close to capturing the atmosphere of the early days of hip-hop and spraycan art...&quot; Reviewing the film for BBC, David Mattin wrote that &quot;&quot;Wild Style&quot; is a cult classic - indisputably the most important hip hop movie, ever.&quot;

== Historical value and impact ==
The plot of &quot;Wild Style&quot; is fairly loose and the film is more notable for featuring several prominent figures from early hip hop culture such as Busy Bee Starski, Fab Five Freddy, The Cold Crush Brothers and Grandmaster Flash. Throughout the movie, there are scenes depicting activities common in the early days of hip hop. These include MCing, turntablism, graffiti and b-boying. The film demonstrates the interconnections between music, dance and art in the development of hip hop culture.

The film has received a large cult following over the years after its initial release. Highly regarded hip hop albums such as &quot;Illmatic&quot; by Nas, &quot;Midnight Marauders&quot; by A Tribe Called Quest, &quot;Black Sunday&quot; by Cypress Hill, &quot;Resurrection&quot; by Common, &quot;Big Shots&quot; by Charizma, &quot;Mm..Food&quot; by MF Doom, &quot;Check Your Head&quot; by Beastie Boys, &quot;Beat Konducta&quot; by Madlib, &quot;Jay Stay Paid&quot; by J Dilla and &quot;Quality Control&quot; by Jurassic 5 have used samples from the film.

In 2007, the VH1 Hip Hop Honors paid tribute to &quot;Wild Style&quot; in recognition of its influence upon the culture. The film was also voted as one of the top ten rock and roll films of all time by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2012, &quot;Wild Style&quot; was ranked No. 1 on Billboard&#x27;s list of the Top 10 Best Hip-Hop Movies Ever. The film was exhibited as part of a 1980s art retrospective at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago and the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston in 2012. In 2021, it was shown at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston to celebrate the closing weekend of the exhibition &quot;Writing the Future: Basquiat and the Hip-Hop Generation.&quot;

== Soundtrack ==

Chris Stein of Blondie worked on the soundtrack and score of &quot;Wild Style&quot;. The original 1983 soundtrack was released by Animal Records. It consisted of 13 tracks recorded by various artists included in the film. A 25th anniversary edition expanded this to 17 tracks, plus a bonus disc of remixes, instrumentals and DJ tools. The album has been described by Allmusic as &quot;one of the key records of early 1980s hip-hop&quot;.

<text>The ABC was an English car manufactured between 1920 and 1929 by ABC Motors.

It was a light car (305 kg), powered by a 1203 cc flat-twin, air-cooled engine designed by Granville Bradshaw (the man who was also responsible for the ABC Motorcycle). The engine however was difficult to start, loud, inefficiently lubricated, and prone to breakages, particularly the quite long, exposed push rods. Over time quality improved dramatically. Combined with the vehicle&#x27;s light weight, the powerplant made the car quite fast for its size, capable of speeds approaching , and boasting quite good acceleration. ABC was originally part of the Harper Bean combine, and was based in Hersham, Surrey and Harper Bean supplied castings, stampings, and forgings utilized on the first ABCs. The car was expensive; in 1920 it sold for £414 but came down to £265 for a four seater in 1923.

The &quot;radiator&quot; cap was actually the fuel tank filler, which led to problems when mechanics unfamiliar with air-cooled cars topped off the fuel tank with water.

In 1925 a more refined version came featuring stronger valve gear, a better system of lubrication, and enclosed pushrods. Front-wheel brakes became an option.

The company introduced a Super Sports model in 1925 with a 1320 cc engine. This was the only model offered for the last four years of ABC&#x27;s production.

Today the ABC is fairly rare and can be seen at shows and events around England.

<text>Dronryp () is a village in the Dutch municipality of Waadhoeke. On 1 January 2017, it had 3,281 inhabitants.

==History and architecture==
Before 2018, the village was part of the Menameradiel municipality. A few centuries BC, a settlement developed around where the street Tsjerkebuorren is now (Stenvert et al., 2000). Another settlement came into existence nearby when a canal between Leeuwarden and Harlingen was completed in 1507. (Part of it was filled up in 1940.) Between roughly 1850 and 1950, these two gradually merged.

The oldest known reference to the village dates from 1132, when it was called Denningrip, meaning a &quot;rip&quot; (narrow stretch of land) where a family called Drenninga lived.

Of the old mansions in the area only the early 18th century Schatzenburg remains.

==Miscellaneous information==
The van Harinxmakanaal, completed in 1953, runs along the south side of the town. The A31 runs along the north side. Dronryp also has a railway station.

Painter Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema was born in the house at Dûbelestreek 2, Eise Eisinga, famous for his planetarium, at Tsjerkebuorren 13.

<doc id="850355" wikidata="Q3441480" url="?curid=850355" title="Rona Ambrose">
<text>Ronalee Ambrose Veitch ( , née Chapchuk; born March 15, 1969) is a former Canadian politician who was the interim leader of the Conservative Party and the leader of the Opposition between 2015 and 2017. She was the Conservative Party member of the House of Commons for Sturgeon River—Parkland between 2015 and 2017 and had previously represented Edmonton—Spruce Grove from 2004 to 2015.

She was the Conservative Party&#x27;s Intergovernmental Affairs critic in her first term as an Opposition MP. Ambrose also served as vice-chair of the Treasury Board and has held multiple cabinet positions as Canada&#x27;s Minister of Health, Minister of the Environment, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Minister of Western Economic Diversification, Minister of Labour, Minister of Public Works and Government Services, and Minister of Status of Women. She was President of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada. She is also a former communication and public policy consultant for the Alberta government.

In May 2017, she announced her retirement from federal politics to take effect during the summer. The next day, she was named a visiting fellow by the Canada Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. She retired in July 2017, stating that she hoped she was &quot;able to inspire women to consider public service.&quot;

In August 2017, Justin Trudeau&#x27;s Liberal government appointed Ambrose to a 13-member NAFTA advisory council that would provide opinion and feedback on the negotiations with the United States and Mexico.

==Early life and education==
Ambrose was born Ronalee Chapchuk in Valleyview, Alberta, as the daughter of Colleen (née Clark) and James Chapchuk. She grew up in both Brazil and Parkland County, Alberta. In addition to English, she also speaks Portuguese and Spanish. Ambrose has a Bachelor of Arts in women&#x27;s and gender studies from the University of Victoria and a Master of Arts in political science from the University of Alberta.

==Political views==
Ambrose is a feminist. Before her work in Canadian federal politics, Ambrose&#x27;s community service included involvement with organizations working to end violence against women, including the Status of Women Action Group, the Victoria Sexual Assault and Sexual Abuse Crisis Centre, and the Edmonton Women&#x27;s Shelter.

Ambrose also calls herself a libertarian and enjoys Ayn Rand&#x27;s novels, such as &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; and &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;. She was a member of the Trilateral Commission, an organization dedicated to closer cooperation between Europe, North America, and Japan.

==Political career==
Ambrose was first elected to Parliament in the 2004 federal election for the newly created riding of Edmonton-Spruce Grove in west Edmonton.

On February 16, 2005, she made headlines after making a remark in Parliament directed at Liberal Social Development Minister Ken Dryden about the Liberal national child care plan: &quot;Working women want to make their own choices; we don&#x27;t need old white guys telling us what to do.&quot;

=== Environment Minister ===
In the 2006 elections, Ambrose successfully defended her seat in Edmonton–Spruce Grove with 66.8% of the vote in the riding. She was then appointed Environment Minister in Prime Minister Stephen Harper&#x27;s minority government. Ambrose&#x27;s appointment to the cabinet made her the youngest woman appointed to the cabinet at the time.

On April 7, 2006, Ambrose announced that Canada could not meet its targets under the Kyoto Protocol and must set more realistic goals for cutting greenhouse gases. &quot;My departmental officials and the department officials from natural resources have indicated that Canada can&#x27;t reach its Kyoto target. And let me be clear. I have been engaging with our international counterparts over the past month, and we are not the only country finding itself in this situation&quot;, said Ambrose.

On April 13, 2006, Ambrose stopped an Environment Canada scientist, Mark Tushingham, from speaking at the launch of his science fiction novel &quot;Hotter than Hell,&quot; set in a dystopian future caused by global warming. Tushingham&#x27;s publisher and environmentalists believed this was because the book was not in line with the government&#x27;s views on climate change. Still, Ambrose&#x27;s spokesperson said the speech was billed as coming from an Environment Canada scientist speaking in an official capacity and thus out of the process.

On April 25, 2006, Ambrose expressed her support of the (now defunct) Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate as an alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, because it includes China and India. These two large polluting nations are not bound by the latter agreement. The APP had voluntary emissions reduction targets and focused on developing technological solutions to climate change.

In May 2006, Ambrose criticized the previous Liberal government&#x27;s failure to meet the high targets that they had negotiated at Kyoto, saying, &quot;We would have to pull every truck and car off the street, shut down every train and ground every plane to reach the Kyoto target the Liberals negotiated for Canada.&quot;

In June 2006, opposition discontent over Ambrose&#x27;s actions as environment minister prompted the NDP and the Bloc Québécois to try to table a motion in the Commons environmental committee calling for her resignation. The motion was blocked with the help of the Liberals after the Conservatives said that the motion would be a confidence motion, that if passed would trigger an election in the Fall of 2006.

In August 2006, she stated, &quot;I welcome the commitment from British Columbia to preserve and increase the population of Northern Spotted Owls ... It is my opinion that, given the measures they are taking, such as stopping logging in areas currently occupied by the owls, there is no imminent threat to the survival or recovery of the Northern Spotted Owl at this time.&quot;

On October 19, 2006, Ambrose introduced a Clean Air Act that aimed to reduce greenhouse emissions starting in 2020, cutting them to about half of the 2003 levels by 2050. She also introduced other regulations to industries and vehicles and possible cooperation between the federal government and the provinces to create a system that would report air emissions. In an interview with the media, Ambrose denied that the Conservative government had withdrawn from the Kyoto Protocol despite its previous opposition. However, industries will have until 2010 before they are expected to reduce emissions, and the government will not have final (and voluntary) targets ready until 2020. Oil companies will have to reduce emissions on a per-barrel basis, a reduction proportional to production basis.

Ambrose attended the November 2006 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Nairobi, Kenya.

A few weeks before Ambrose was shuffled out from the environment portfolio, she told a parliamentary committee that Canada had paid its debts under the Kyoto Protocol only to have an Environment Canada official point out that the bill was still unpaid.

=== Western Economic Diversification and Intergovernmental Affairs ===
News stories of a possible Cabinet shuffle began to appear in late 2006 that included shifting Ambrose from her environment portfolio. As part of the January 4, 2007, cabinet shuffle, Ambrose was replaced as Environment Minister by John Baird and became Minister of Western Economic Diversification, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, and President of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada.

=== Minister of Labour and Minister of Public Works and Government Services ===
After winning reelection in the 2008 election, Ambrose was appointed Labour Minister on October 30, 2008. On January 19, 2010, Ambrose succeeded Christian Paradis and was appointed as the new Minister of Public Works and Government Services, where she introduced a major project to improve the way the government administers its pay and pension systems and &quot;which will modernize service, introduce efficiencies, and improve our stewardship responsibilities in those areas.&quot; That system was to be the Phoenix Pay System.

=== Minister responsible for the Status of Women ===
On April 9, 2010, Ambrose was named Minister responsible for the Status of Women after Helena Guergis was dismissed from Cabinet.

The International Day of the Girl Child was formally proposed by Canada in the United Nations General Assembly as a resolution. Rona Ambrose, Canada&#x27;s Minister for the Status of Women, sponsored the resolution; a delegation of women and girls made presentations supporting the initiative at the 55th United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. On December 19, 2011, the United Nations General Assembly voted to pass a resolution adopting October 11, 2012, as the inaugural International Day of the Girl Child.

On September 26, 2012, Ambrose voted in favour of Motion 312, a motion by Conservative MP Stephen Woodworth that would have directed a Commons committee to revisit the section of the Criminal Code defining at what point human life begins. Viewing the motion as an attempt to re-open the debate on abortion laws, Canadian pro-choice groups and Commons opposition parties considered her vote inconsistent with her ministerial role and prompted a call for her resignation. The motion was eventually voted down. Ambrose responded to her critics, stating her concern about discrimination against girls that is made possible by sex-selection abortion. Pro-Life groups praised Ambrose for supporting the Motion.

=== Minister of Health ===

In July 2013, Stephen Harper appointed Rona Ambrose as Minister of Health and kept her as Minister of Western Economic Diversification.

While she was an MP, Ambrose worked closely with Nadia Murad, a Yazidi refugee and Nobel Peace Prize winner, in pushing the House of Commons to label the persecution of Yazidis a genocide. She also led the fight for a Canadian refugee program to bring Yazidi women and girls who have been sexually enslaved by ISIS to safety in Canada, which resulted in the rescue of over 1000 women and girls.

On June 11, 2015, she made headlines for being &quot;outraged&quot; that (in a unanimous decision) the Supreme Court of Canada expanded the definition of what constituted medical marijuana to include oils, teas, brownies, etc., from its previous limitation to dried leaves, arguing &quot;Marijuana has never gone through the regulatory approval process at Health Canada, which requires rigorous safety reviews and clinical trials with scientific evidence.&quot;

When asked why the testing has not been done when people are taking medical marijuana every day, she responded, &quot;It is not my job as Minister. If there is clinical evidence and a company decides ... to submit it to the regulatory approval process, it would be looked at. That has never happened.&quot;

=== Leader of the Opposition ===
Stephen Harper resigned as Conservative party leader after Liberals defeated the party in the 2015 election. Ambrose, who was elected in the new riding of Sturgeon River-Parkland—essentially the suburban portion of her old riding–announced that she would run for the interim leadership of the Conservative Party. She was elected to that post on November 5, 2015—becoming the third woman to hold the post.

Ambrose was the third female leader of Canada&#x27;s major centre-right party. The first was former Prime Minister Kim Campbell, who led Canada&#x27;s now-defunct Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, and the second was Deborah Grey, of the former Canadian Alliance. She is also the third woman to be Opposition Leader, after Grey and the NDP&#x27;s Nycole Turmel. All three of them served in an interim capacity. Under the party constitution, as interim leader, she was not eligible to run for leadership at the subsequent Conservative Party of Canada leadership election.

On November 13, 2015, Ambrose responded to the terrorist attacks in Paris committed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Ambrose stated, &quot;The fight against ISIS (ISIL) requires a strong humanitarian response, but also a military response ... It&#x27;s important that we remain resolute and support our allies.&quot;

Ambrose supports an inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women.

In February 2017, while still a sitting MP, Ambrose introduced Private Member&#x27;s Bill C-337, &quot;An Act to amend the Judges Act and the Criminal Code,&quot; also known as the JUST Act. If passed, this bill would require judges in Canada to undergo training on sexual assault law, involving education on rape myths, stereotypes about victims, and the impact of trauma on memory. The JUST Act gained widespread support from experts and victim advocacy groups and was subsequently passed unanimously by the House of Commons. However, the bill did not pass a third reading in the Senate, as the Senate rose for Summer 2019 without voting on the JUST Act, resulting in the expiration of the order paper, as the order paper is wiped clean for the October 2019 federal election.

=== Resignation from Parliament ===
In May 2017, Ambrose announced to her caucus that she would leave federal politics at the end of the spring session of Parliament, in June 2017, several weeks after her successor as Conservative leader was chosen. Her seat was held for the Conservatives by Dane Lloyd, who won the by-election.

=== Post resignation ===
Ambrose has stated that though she supports the merger of the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta and the Wildrose Party, she will not be a candidate for the leadership of the proposed new United Conservative Party of Alberta.

She joined the Canada Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a Washington, D.C.–based think tank, as a visiting fellow focused on Canadian–American trade and to lead the organization&#x27;s campaign to educate officials in both countries about the benefits of an integrated North American economy.

She was also appointed a member of the NAFTA advisory council set up by the Trudeau Liberal government in August 2017.

In 2018, Rona Ambrose and Laureen Harper, wife of former Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper, launched the She Leads Foundation. She Leads is a non-profit organization based in Alberta that encourages women to run for office and participate in public life. Alongside UN Women, Ambrose assisted in the launch of SHEInnovates Alberta, a campaign providing tools necessary to encourage women to seek leadership positions and innovation.

In May 2020, it was announced that Rona Ambrose had joined the board of directors of the e-cigarette company Juul.

Following Andrew Scheer&#x27;s resignation after the Conservative loss in the 2019 Canadian federal election, Ambrose faced pressure from many prominent Conservatives to run for party leader in the 2020 leadership race. Ambrose announced she would not run for party leader in January 2020, during a Facebook livestream in the Alberta mountains.

<text>Jack Whittingham (2 August 1910 – 3 July 1972) was a British playwright and screenwriter.

==Early life==
Whittingham was born in Heaton, West Yorkshire, England, and educated at Charterhouse between 1924 and 1929. He then went up Lincoln College, Oxford to read law. During the early 1930s he was briefly engaged to the Wrigley heiress, Ada Elizabeth Offield. Between 1932 and 1937, Whittingham worked for a number of newspapers and in 1937 joined Alexander Korda as a contract screenwriter. During the Second World War, he was based on Iceland with an artillery regiment.

==Film career==
Beginning with the film &quot;Q Planes&quot; in 1938, Whittingham was a prolific screenwriter. Between 1937 and 1948, he wrote 14 screenplays for companies including RKO, Associated British Picture Corporation, British National and Ealing Studios.

===Ealing Studios===
In 1948 he was a contracted screenwriter for Ealing Studios. He wrote the original story and screenplay for &quot;Cage of Gold&quot; (1950), &quot;Pool of London&quot; (1951), &quot;Hunted&quot; (1952), &quot;The Divided Heart&quot; (1954) and the screenplay for &quot;I Believe in You&quot; (1954), &quot;Mandy&quot; (1952) and &quot;West of Zanzibar&quot; (1954).

===British Lion===
In 1956 he joined British Lion Films where he wrote &quot;The Birthday Present&quot; (1957).

===&quot;Thunderball&quot;===

Whittingham collaborated with Ian Fleming and producer Kevin McClory on a screenplay for a James Bond film. However, when Fleming developed cold feet about McClory as producer of this first James Bond screenplay, he novelised the work into his ninth official novel, &quot;Thunderball&quot;; however, the novel only credited Fleming.

McClory and Whittingham then sued Fleming, which led to a settlement in 1963 that gave McClory the film rights to the novel. During the lawsuit, Whittingham stepped down as &#x27;co-plaintiff&#x27; and stood by McClory as &#x27;principal witness&#x27;, having previously signed away all his rights &quot;of whatsoever nature&quot; entirely when the screenplay was presumed finished. As a result of the settlement, future versions of the novel were forced to credit, &quot;based on the screen treatment by Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham, and Ian Fleming&quot; (in that order). Two adaptations of &quot;Thunderball&quot; were subsequently made, the first being &quot;Thunderball&quot; in 1965 as part of the series of films from Eon Productions. The second adaptation was the film &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; in 1983. Further adaptations had been planned at one point or another by McClory, but were scrapped due to lawsuits from MGM and United Artists.

In the film &quot;Thunderball&quot;, credits are somewhat complex. Like a good number of James Bond films, it was promoted as being &quot;Ian Fleming&#x27;s&quot;. The screenplay was credited to Richard Maibaum and John Hopkins. However, it was also credited as having been &quot;based on an original screenplay by Jack Whittingham,&quot; which also was credited as being &quot;based on the original story by Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham, and Ian Fleming&quot;. Whittingham&#x27;s sole original screenplay credit has been omitted from posters and other promotional materials.

===Post-&quot;Thunderball&quot;===
In his late fifties, Whittigham decided to take up sailing. He went to the Boat Show at Olympia and bought a boat; six books on how to sail, and spent a couple of weekends on his old friend Tom Farmiloe&#x27;s boat before setting off for France!

In July 1965, his daughter, Sylvan, launched his new boat, &quot;Domani&quot;, a 38-foot Atlantic Ketch, and, later that year Whittingham and his wife, Margo, his son Jonathan and one other crew member Christopher Smith.
left the UK and set sail for Malta where they had built a villa overlooking the harbour at Marsaxlokk. During the six week voyage, they endured mechanical problems and a hurricane-force storm during the crossing of the Bay of Biscay. The ship&#x27;s company were forced to heave to under bare poles for three days which fortunately pushed the vessel North East back out into the Atlantic rather than towards the coastline.

They put into Gibraltar for repairs where Christopher left the boat to return to England. Maltese authorities were concerned when the arrival of the boat was overdue and search parties made attempts to locate them. He finally limped into Valletta harbour, and, whilst retired and living in Malta, worked on screenplays about the lives of Ian Fleming (&quot;The Life of Ian Fleming&quot;) and Oleg Penkovsky.

==Personal life==
In 1942 he married Margot Isobel Gough and they had a daughter, Suilven (Sylvan) born 2 December 1943, and boy, Jonathan, born 5 June 1946. Sylvan became a singer and photographer.

==Death==
Whittingham died of a heart attack in Valletta, Malta, on 3 July 1972.

<text>Tony Harris (born 1969) is an American comic book artist, known for his work on series such as &quot;Starman&quot;, &quot;Iron Man&quot;, and &quot;Ex Machina&quot;. He has been nominated for nineteen Eisner Awards and has won two.

==Career==
Harris began his comics career in 1989. Initially, he flitted from assignment to assignment and worked on T-shirts and ads to pay the bills during dry spells in his comics work. He rose to prominence in 1994 with the publication of DC comics&#x27; &quot;Starman&quot;. Summarizing his career up to this point, he remarked &quot;When you jump around as a freelancer, it&#x27;s easy to have your attention span dwindle down to that of a gnat. When I got &quot;Starman&quot;, I had to buckle down and just get serious about the work.&quot; Co-created with James Robinson, &quot;Starman&quot; led the two to critical acclaim and eventually an Eisner Award for the &quot;Sand and Stars&quot; story arc.

After four and a half years on &quot;Starman&quot;, Harris left to pursue other projects but remained the cover artist on for another year and a half. During this time he was also one of the original members of Atlanta&#x27;s Gaijin Studios.

He pencilled the series &quot;Ex Machina&quot; with Brian K. Vaughan, published by Wildstorm from 2004 to 2010, and &quot;War Heroes&quot; with Mark Millar, published by Image Comics, which has only had three issues published as of 2013. In April 2010, Following the completion of &quot;Ex Machina&quot;, Harris announced that he and B. Clay Moore would produce a series called &quot;The Further Adventures of the Whistling Skull&quot;, this was later turned into JSA Liberty Files: The Whistling Skull, tying it into the earlier JSA Liberty Files stories he did, and the first issue saw print in December 2012. Concurrently with this, he launched a new series with Steve Niles, &quot;Chin Music&quot;, in April 2013, then a new creator-owned series, &quot;Roundeye: For Love&quot;.

In the late 1990s he moved on to form Jolly Roger Studio, in Macon, Georgia.

Other works include keyframe animation and storyboards for Chevrolet commercial, illustration for Cartoon Network, product design and illustration for Universal&#x27;s &quot;The Mummy&quot;.

==Controversy==
In November 2012, Harris posted a controversial essay about female cosplayers on his Facebook page, which drew congratulations from some of his fans, but criticism from others for being sexist.

In April of 2013, Harris was paid by Comic Book Store Owner Mike McDaniel of Heroes and Villains in Warner Robins, Georgia, for a commission to honor Bert Christman, a Golden Age comic book creator who died in World War II. Despite repeated inquires by McDaniel on the status of the commission, Harris has not completed the work and McDaniel remains not refunded. 
McDaniel went public on his store&#x27;s Facebook page in June of 2019 with the issue. 

In October 2019, Harris had failed to deliver a $1200 commission to fan Seth Talley. Talley had paid for the commission seven years prior. Talley had reached out to Harris&#x27;s agent, who reported that Harris had not worked on them. Comic news website &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot; reached out to Harris, who provided visual evidence of the commission, but then reported he would be destroying the piece rather than finishing it. After Bleeding Cool ran an article on the matter, Talley was repaid via the CashApp. 

==Technique==
Harris makes extensive use of models and photo reference in his work, and composes panels featuring multiple characters with models he uses to represent specific characters. &quot;Ex Machina: The First Hundred Days&quot;, the first collected trade paperback of that series, featured a &quot;Cast of Characters&quot; page showing the 12 models that starred as the characters in that storyline, followed by a gallery showing how several excerpted pages from that story progressed from photo to pencil art to inks to colors.

==Awards==
*1997 Eisner Award for Best Penciller/Inker or Penciller/Inker Team (with Wade Von Grawbadger, for &quot;Starman&quot;)
*2005 Eisner Award for New Series (with Brian K Vaughan and Tom Fesiter, for &quot;Ex Machina)&quot;

<text>Todd Klein (born January 28, 1951) is an American comic book letterer, logo designer, and occasional writer, primarily for DC Comics.

==Biography==

=== Early career===
Todd Klein broke into comics in the summer of 1977, hired by DC Comics as a staff production worker. This job entailed pasting together text pages (such as letter columns), putting logos, display lettering, and type on covers, and doing art and lettering corrections on comics pages. Other staffers included colorists Bob LeRose and Anthony Tollin, writer Bob Rozakis, inker Steve Mitchell, and letterer John Workman. Over the next months and years, Klein tried his hand at all those things, but found lettering suited him best. Workman helped Klein get started with the basic tools and techniques, and Klein studied the work of Gaspar Saladino, Workman, Ben Oda, and John Costanza; as well as Marvel Comics letterers Tom Orzechowski, Jim Novak, and Joe Rosen. Klein landed his first freelance lettering job in the fall of 1977, and by late 1977 was entrusted with an entire issue: &quot;Firestorm&quot; #1.

===Freelancer===
In the 1980s, Klein mainly worked for DC, where in addition to lettering many of their titles, he also designed logos and title headers for various letter pages. As DC emerged from a late 1970s/early 1980s slump, new opportunities opened up for freelancers. Klein got more work as a letterer (and also a fair amount as a writer), keeping him very busy. Books he worked on during this period included Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Detective Comics&quot;; as well as his own scripts for &quot;Omega Men&quot;. As a freelancer, Klein also performed production work on such works as Moore and Dave Gibbons&#x27; &quot;Watchmen&quot;, Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;Ronin&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

In the 1990s, despite being a freelancer, Klein worked for long periods on a number of comics titles, including the entire runs of &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (1987–1992), &quot;Sandman&quot; (1989–1996), &quot;The Spectre&quot; (1992–1998), &quot;The Dreaming&quot; (1996–2001), and &quot;The Invisibles&quot; (1997–2000) for DC/Vertigo; and &quot;Deathblow&quot; (1994–1996) for Image Comics). He also has long stints on DC&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; (1990–1992 and 1996–1999); &quot;The Demon&quot; (1990–1994); &quot;Shade, the Changing Man&quot; (1990–1994); and &quot;&quot; (1992–1994); as well as Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Captain America&quot; (1998–2002) and &quot;Earth X&quot; (1999–2000).

In the 2000s, Klein lettered all the Alan Moore America&#x27;s Best Comics titles, including &quot;Promethea&quot;, &quot;Tom Strong&quot;, and &quot;Top 10&quot;. He also lettered the entire runs of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Universe X&quot; (2000–2001); DC/Vertigo&#x27;s &quot;Fables&quot; (2002–2015), &quot;Books of Magick: Life During Wartime&quot; (2005–2006), &quot;Justice&quot; (2005–2007), &quot;Jack of Fables&quot; (2006–2011), and &quot;Simon Dark&quot; (2007–2009). Klein has also spent long periods on DC&#x27;s &quot;Detective Comics&quot; (2000–2003); &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (2003–2006) and Vertigo&#x27;s &quot;Testament&quot; (2006–2008).

=== &quot;Sandman&quot; ===
Klein is most known for his work on Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Sandman&quot;, where he developed very distinctive dialogue balloons and lettering for various characters, especially Dream and his siblings. Klein discussed the process by which he came up with these distinctive styles on his website: &quot;Each of them needed some sort of special lettering style, . . .to show that they are all equals in their iconic power. Destiny&#x27;s speech was simply italic (really just slanted) [...] Neil had a specific idea about Delirium&#x27;s style, that it represent a sort of mad variety, getting louder and softer, like something going in and out of focus. This was fun to do in small amounts, but tedious in large ones. Despair just had a rough balloon edge to denote a ragged, rough voice. (Destruction, when we finally met him, had an extra bold border to denote a loud, booming voice.)&quot;

== Technique ==
To read about Klein&#x27;s technique one need look no further than &quot;The DC Comics Guide to Coloring and Lettering Comics&quot;, published by Watson-Guptill Publications. In this guide, Klein gives a thorough review of how he mentally approaches a page and then goes about doing the actual lettering, either by hand (pen and ink), or by use of the computer (Adobe Illustrator).

=== Computer lettering ===
Klein saw the growing prevalence of computerized lettering in the early 1990s and quickly realized it was the wave of the future. He had met Comicraft owners Richard Starkings and John Gaushell at the 1993 San Diego Comic-Con, and in 1994, he asked them to help him get started with computer lettering by creating a few fonts based on Klein&#x27;s hand lettering. Klein bought his first Macintosh computer in late 1994 and started learning how to make fonts himself. Since 1995, Klein has created a library of over 100 of his own fonts.

The first book that Klein fully computer lettered was Image Comics&#x27; &quot;Deathblow&quot; #20.

== Logos ==
Klein began creating logos for DC when he started there in 1977. Most of his logos were for DC until he became a full-time freelancer in 1987, when he began creating logos for other companies as well. Some of the notable logos he created during the period 1977–1995 include the &quot;Batman&quot; logo used for the &quot;&quot; storyline, &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; (including character logos for team members Nightwing, Starfire, Raven, Cyborg, Changeling, and Jericho), &quot;Amethyst: Princess of Gemworld&quot;, &quot;Camelot 3000&quot;, &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;, &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, and &quot;Magneto&quot;.

From 1995 to the present, most of Klein&#x27;s logos have been done on the computer (although many began as hand-drawn sketches that were scanned and traced in Adobe Illustrator). Notable logos from this period include &quot;Challengers of the Unknown&quot;, &quot;Silver Surfer&quot;, &quot;Legionnaires&quot;, &quot;Iron Man&quot;, the &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot;, &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot;, &quot;Albion&quot;, &quot;Witchblade&quot;, &quot;Terra Obscura&quot;, and &quot;Tom Strong&quot;.

=== Writing ===
In addition to being the main writer for &quot;The Omega Men&quot; from May 1985 to May 1986 (issue #s 26–38), Klein also penned a number of entries about the Omega Men and the Green Lantern Corps for &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in the DC Universe&quot;, as well as its &#x27;87 update. In addition, from 1978 to 1988, Klein wrote a number of (mostly) short pieces for other DC titles:

<doc id="850370" wikidata="Q4811002" url="?curid=850370" title="Aston Martin VH platform">
<text>The British carmaker Aston Martin developed the vertical–horizontal (VH) vehicle platform to serve as the basis of most of the mass-produced vehicles in its lineup manufactured between 2003 and 2016, comprising the DB9, followed by the Vantage, DBS, Rapide and Vanquish. The limited-production Virage, DB10 and Lagonda Taraf also used this platform.

Ulrich Bez was appointed chief executive officer and chairman of Aston Martin in July 2000. At that time, the company had made significant investments in the V12 Vanquish&#x27;s structural platform and determined that developing a separate platform for a single model would not be a prudent use of resources. In 2001, Bez initiated the development of a new versatile architecture intended to accompany automobiles of various sizes; most of the developments were done within that year. Aston Martin implemented modifications to enhance assembly efficiency, aiming for thirty minutes per unit, compared to the four hours required for the V12 Vanquish. The VH platform was developed to be flexible. Every vehicle that uses it incorporates bonded and riveted aluminium to reduce weight. The term &quot;vertical&quot; indicates that the platform can accommodate various applications and can be adjusted in size to meet the requirements of future models. The term &quot;horizontal&quot; signifies that components of the platform can be used across different models within the Aston Martin lineup.

The first vehicle to use the VH platform was the DB9, which constituted the platform&#x27;s first generation. The Vantage, introduced in 2005, used the second generation of the platform, along with the DBS and DB10, introduced in 2007 and 2014, respectively. The third generation of the platform was used by the Virage in 2011, the 2012 facelift of the DB9 and the 2012 Vanquish. The Rapide and Lagonda Taraf used the fourth generation, an extended version of the platform. The cars have since been discontinued. The Virage and DBS both ended production in 2012, followed by the DB10 in 2015. The DB9 and Taraf were discontinued in 2016, while the Vantage and Vanquish ended production in 2018. Production of the Rapide ended in 2020.

<text>The Coast Guard Medal is a decoration of the United States military that is awarded to any service member who, while serving in any capacity with the United States Coast Guard, distinguishes themselves by heroism not involving actual conflict with an enemy. For the decoration to be awarded, an individual must have performed a voluntary act of heroism in the face of great personal danger or of such a magnitude that it stands out distinctly above normal expectations.

The Coast Guard Medal was first authorized by on 4 August 1949, but it was not until 1958 that the medal was actually bestowed. The first recipients of the Coast Guard Medal were FN Earl H. Leyda and BM3 Albert Raymond Johnson who were awarded the decoration in March 1958. The citation for the Coast Guard Medal was for actions performed in August 1957 while attempting to rescue trapped workers from the Oswego Water Works Tunnel, under Lake Ontario, in Oswego, New York.

Additional awards of the Coast Guard Medal are annotated by inch gold stars. The Coast Guard Medal is the equivalent to the Army&#x27;s Soldier&#x27;s Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, and the Air and Space Forces&#x27; Airman&#x27;s Medal.

<doc id="850374" wikidata="Q8476" url="?curid=850374" title="AS Reggina 1914">
<text>Associazione Sportiva Reggina 1914, commonly referred to as Reggina, is an Italian football club based in Reggio Calabria. They play their home matches at the 27,763 seater Stadio Oreste Granillo and are currently playing in the Serie D league.

They are nicknamed the &quot;Amaranto&quot; (amaranth) after their official dark red colours. The club was formerly known as Reggina Calcio before declaring bankruptcy in 2015, as well as A.S.D. Reggio Calabria in the 2015–16 season, Urbs Reggina 1914 from 2016 to 2019, Reggina 1914 from 2019 to 2023, and LFA Reggio Calabria in the 2023–24 season.

In its previous guise, the club played in the Serie A for nine seasons between 1999 and 2009, including a seven-year consecutive spell starting in 2002. During these years, the club narrowly avoided relegation in most seasons and never finished in the top half. After failing to make a return in the first few years, the club fell into financial and sporting difficulties, culminating in falling into the lower tiers of Italian football before returning to Serie B in 2020.

==Names==
The club was founded on 11 January 1914 as Unione Sportiva Reggio Calabria. It changed name many times (Società Calcistica Reggio, Reggio Foot Ball Club, Associazione Sportiva Reggina, Società Sportiva La Dominante), finally assuming the denomination Reggina Calcio in 1986.

After the 2015 bankruptcy, the club had used A.S.D. Reggio Calabria as the new name of the new legal person, and then the club changed to the denomination Urbs Reggina 1914 S.r.l. in 2016, and, between 2019 and 2023, Reggina 1914 S.r.l..

Following the most recent club exclusion in 2023, the club was refounded as LFA Reggio Calabria.

==History==
The club was founded on 11 January 1914.

In 1986 Pasquale Foti became managing director of the newly re-formed and renamed Reggina Calcio. In 1991, he became president.

===Serie A (1999–2009)===
From the late 1990s to the 2000s, Reggina has been alternating between the top two levels of the Italian league system. They reached the Italian top division Serie A for the first time in 1999. Two years later, they lost a relegation playout to Verona, being consequently relegated to 2001–02 Serie B. Reggina finished third in Serie B in 2002, earning a return to Serie A. In 2003, Reggina survived a relegation playout against Atalanta. They would spend the next 7 years maintaining their Serie A status until their eventual relegation in the 2008–09 season.

In August 2006, they were indicted as part of the second wave of &quot;Calciopoli&quot; investigations. Originally punished with a 15-point deduction for the 2006–07 Serie A, then reduced to 11 points following appeal. Despite the heavy deduction of points, Reggina managed to save themselves from relegation, defeating newly crowned UEFA Champions League winners Milan on the final matchday and ending the season with 40 points (including the deduction), just one single point above the third relegation spot, occupied by Chievo. They poorly started the Serie A 2007-08, causing head coach Massimo Ficcadenti to be sacked and replaced by Renzo Ulivieri. A third managerial change, with Ulivieri fired and replacing with team scout Nevio Orlandi, proved to be successful as Reggina improved their results and performances, escaping relegation with key wins at Catania, and home to Empoli. Orlandi was subsequently confirmed at the helm of the &quot;amaranto&quot; for the Serie A 2008–09.

===Serie B (2009–2014)===
Since their relegation in the 2008–09 season, Reggina has become slightly inconsistent in their attempts to return to Italy&#x27;s top flight. The 2009–10 season would see three coaches at the helm: Walter Novellino, Ivo Iaconi, Roberto Breda. Despite possessing Bonazzoli, Carmona, Tedesco, Brienza and homegrown star Missiroli, they were unable to gain a better position than 13th. Disappointing for a team just relegated from the top division. Top goal scorer for the campaign was Brienza with 12.

The 2010–11 season was regarded as one of the Amaranto&#x27;s best in Serie B. Shockingly they would conduct their usual coaching merry-go-round, as Gianluca Atzori would lead them to a 6th-place finish and playoffs to Serie A. they would stumble at the last hurdle losing to Novara in a two-legged playoff. Top players include Acerbi, Missiroli, Tedesco, Brienza, Bonazzoli (C) and Milan Loanee Adiyiah. Top goal scorer: Bonazzoli with 19 goals

The 2011–12 season was another disappointing season for the Amaranto, with a 12th-placed finish. Two coaches took charge of Reggina this season; Roberto Breda initially, before being sacked and replaced by Angelo Gregucci, only to be replaced by Breda again towards the end of the season. Unlike the previous season, they did not make the play-offs. Top players in this season&#x27;s squad include: Adejo, Emerson, (Ramos Borges Emerson), Missiroli, Bonazzoli (C), and Ceravolo. Top scorer was Ceravolo with 11.

The 2012–13 season would be marred with yet another controversy similar to that of 2006. Reggina were penalized for the latest match-fixing scandal that hit Italian shores and was given a −4 penalty as a result. After appeal it was reduced to −2 instead. They were in contention for playoff places right until the last few rounds, where poor form saw them end the season in 11th place.

The 2013–14 season ended in disaster, as Reggina won just six out of 42 games and finished second bottom, resulting in relegation to Lega Pro. The season also marked Foti&#x27;s retirement from his role as president, who was handed over to Giuseppe Ranieri.

===Lega Pro===

For the club&#x27;s 2014–15 Lega Pro campaign, Reggina began the season with former captain Francesco Cozza as head coach. After a difficult start to the season and two coaching changes, youth team coach and former player Giacomo Tedesco was hired as head coach for the final three weeks of the season. Despite winning two of the final three matches, Reggina finished last in the league and would have to rely on an appeal of their point penalty to lift them out of the relegation zone. The appeal was successful, and 2 points were returned to move them out of last place. Tedesco guided the team to survival in the playout over rivals Messina.

===Serie D one-year stint===

Despite avoiding relegation in the 2014–15 season, Reggina failed to meet the deadline to register for Lega Pro and the club declared bankruptcy. A new legal person of the club, &quot;A.S.D. Reggio Calabria&quot;, was formed to play in Serie D for the 2015–16 season, Reggio Calabria ended the season in 4th place, losing in the first round of playoffs against Cavese. During the season the club also re-incorporated from &quot;associazione sportiva dilettantistica&quot; to &quot;società sportiva dilettantistica a responsabilità limitata&quot; legal form.

Reggio Calabria was owned by Mimmo Praticò, former regional president of CONI.

===Back to Serie C===

In June 2016, it was reported that the club was renamed from &quot;S.S.D. Reggio Calabria a r.l.&quot; to &quot;S.S.D. Urbs Sportiva Reggina 1914 a r.l.&quot;. The club was then renamed as Urbs Reggina 1914 S.r.l.

Despite finishing as the losing side in the first round of the promotion playoffs of 2015–16 Serie D, the club filed for Lega Pro (later renamed Serie C) repechage to fill one of the vacancies for the 2016–17 season and was successfully admitted. Reggina ended the season in 13th place.

In January 2019, facing a crisis with a potential player strike due to non-payment of salaries, the club was sold to Italian entrepreneur Luca Gallo.

On 1 July 2019, the club announced to change the name to &quot;Reggina 1914 S.r.l.&quot;.

===Serie B return===
Reggina won its Serie C group in 2020, earning a promotion back to the Serie B for the upcoming season. The team upon its Serie B return included experienced players from higher levels including Jérémy Ménez and Germán Denis.

In the 2022-23 season under the guidance of manager Filippo Inzaghi, Reggina finished in a playoff position, despite suffering a five point deduction for failing to pay taxes and player salaries on time. The deduction was initially seven points, but was reduced to five following an appeal.

===2023 exclusion and restart===
On 1 July 2023, Reggina was excluded from Serie B for the 2023-24 season after Covisoc rejected their application due to financial irregularities. On appeal, the Federal Council confirmed Reggina&#x27;s exclusion. The following level of appeal, the &quot;Collegio di Garanzia&quot; of the Italian Olympic Committee, withheld the decision. On 3 August, the Administrative Court of Rome again rejected Reggina&#x27;s request for readmission. On 30 August, Reggina was again rejected at the final level of appeals, the Council of State. Brescia was readmitted to the league after Reggina&#x27;s confirmed exclusion.

On 1 September 2023, acting mayor of the Metropolitan City of Reggio Calabria, Paolo Brunetti, received approval from the Italian Football Federation to enroll a club in Serie D for the 2023–24 season. The club was successively handed over to a Catania-based consortium led by Antonino Ballarino, named La Fenice Amaranto (The amaranth phoenix), which submitted a league application and will take part to the season under the new denomination of LFA Reggio Calabria, as the new club was forbidden to use the Reggina 1914 name or logo for the upcoming season.

On 29 May 2024, Ballarino and LFA Reggio Calabria acquired the rights to the name and history of Reggina; the club was formally renamed to AS Reggina 1914 on 18 July 2024.

==Rivalries==
Reggina are fierce rivals with neighbours Messina, who are just a twenty-minute ferry ride apart from each other. Twice every season, they clash in the &quot;Derby dello Stretto&quot; (Strait of Messina Derby). In the 2014–15 season, Reggina defeated Messina in both legs of the playout to send Messina down to Serie D. There is also a major Calabrian derby between Reggina and Crotone, but both teams have not played in the same league in for two years. Reggina also has a derby with fellow Calabrian team Catanzaro, which is currently in Serie B.

==Colours and badges==

Reggina used a logo with a letter R and a football on it. Some variant of the logo, had 1986, the year of foundation of Reggina Calcio on it. Due to 2015 bankruptcy, the new owner introduced a new logo as the old design was tied to the old legal person of the club. Due to 2016 renaming, some modification was introduced, which a letter R was re-introduced in the logo. However, the design of the ball on the 2016 logo was different from the historical logo, which the 2016 logo used a leather ball. In 2019, the club reverted to use the historical design of the logo.

<doc id="850375" wikidata="Q319525" url="?curid=850375" title="Strachan and Brown">
<text>Strachan and Brown were an English coach building partnership and then a limited liability company from 1894 to 1974. The firm was originally founded in 1894 by Walter Ernest Brown as a sole trader. In 1896 S A Hughes joined and it became a partnership known as Brown and Hughes. In 1908 James Marshall Strachan joined the partnership with it being renamed Brown, Hughes and Strachan. In the partnership was put into liquidation in 1915. A new partnership with Strachan and Brown was formed that same year and lasted until 1928.
==Coach building==

The partnership was first involved with the repair and construction of horse drawn coaches. In 1903 the partnership built bodies for Milnes-Daimler buses. Their work included the first fully enclosed double-decker bus in the United Kingdom in 1909. The partnership also made bodies for various coach built car brands such as those from Lanchester Motor Company and Delaunay-Belleville. It continued its coach building until 1928 using Albion Motors chassis.

==Aberdonia==

From 1911 to 1915 Strachen made a mid-engined car under the Aberdonia Cars Limited called the Park Royal. The prototype was displayed at the 1911 London Motor Show. It was forward-control with the driver seated ahead of the engine. The car was manufactured in Park Royal, London from 1911 to 1915 by the coachbuilders Brown, Hughes and Strachan. It was powered by a 3160 cc, 4-cylinder, side valve unit rated at 20 hp for taxation purposes. It cost £500 with seven-seated touring coachwork, or £700 with &quot;special landau body&quot;. One was made in 1913 for an Indian Maharajah. Aberdonia also made a two seat cabriolet.
A prototype stretcher carrier, using the Aberdonia chassis, was made in September 1914 with the outbreak of World War One. Production then moved to primarily making ambulances. It also made vehicles with mobile washing and bathing facilities and field kitchens. In order to meet the war time demand Brown, Hughes &amp; Strachan left its traditional facilities in Kensington at the end of 1914 and moved into a new 12,000 m² (3 acres ) site in the London district of Park Royal.

==Fire==
In April 1915, the new facilities were completely destroyed by fire. Brown, Hughes &amp; Strachan was then forced to cease operations and was liquidated in 1916. A fresh partnership was set up by Strachan and Brown after the fire to continue the business at their old premises in Holland Gate, Kensington, London.

==Aircraft==
The company built aircraft at some point during and after the war.

==Patents==
Strachen is noted as having patented a window that could be removed from the body work without disturbing it, an all weather roof for open top buses, and sprung bodywork to dampen vibrations from the chassis.

==Strachan and Brown==
In 1923 the partnership moved to Wales Farm Road, Acton, London. They continued to supply bodies for luxury saloons, and bodies designed by Frank Hopper and Sons of Glasgow for combined passenger, mail, and goods vehicles that used a W&amp;G chassis. These were able to carry 14 passengers and were targeted at rural communities. Bodies were also built for BET companies, the Barnsley and District Traction Co Ltd, and Sheppey Motor Transport Company. In 1925 they made a 26 coach body on a Lancia Pentajota chassis for A E Strachan of Ballater. In 1928 the partnership was dissolved on 17 October 1928 with Strachan passing away the following year on 10 June 1929.

==Strachans (Acton) Limited==
On 2 October 1929 a new company was registered to take over the business of Strachan and Brown. This company continued coachbuilding. In June 1931 John Thornycroft and Co sent five of its new XC double decker chassis to Strachans for bodying. These were for the Eastern National Omnibus Company and were 51 seaters. These were followed by the Gilford Zeus double decker which also were 51 seaters.

==Strachans (Successors) Limited==
The company was reorganised and renamed in 1934 but continued coachbuilding made four bodies on Lion chassis for the Metropolitan Omnibus Company of Perth, Australia. During World War 2 Strachans made a mobile kitchen for the National Fire Service and a Guy Arab chassised utility bus body.

Following the war, in conjunction with S Grahame Ross Ltd, Strachans developed a less complicated way of fabrication enabling interchangeability of panels by lower skilled workers. This construction was used on 15 lowbridge Leyland double deckers for the Western SMT Company. In 1951 they made a reversible design coach Jackson&#x27;s Cleveland Coaches of Guisborough. An unpopular design on four more were made for Valiant Coaches of London. This was followed in 1952 by a body for the 41 seater Dennis Lancet.

That same year Strachans introduced the 41 seater &quot;Srathrae&quot; body, which was first used on a AEC Regal IV chassis. Two years later they introduced the &quot;Everest&quot;. Two were displayed at the 1954 Commercial Motor Show. One used a Maudslay chassis and the other an AEC Reliance chassis. Both were 41 seaters. 

Through this time Strachans also produced other types of commercial and specialist vehicles included bulk egg transporters and milk tankers.

==Strachans (Coachbuilders) Limited==
By 1962 the amount of business had reduced and the company was acquired by Giltspur Investment Group. They changed its name to Strachans (Coachbuilders) Limited and reorganised it. Production was moved to new facilities in Hamble on 1 October 1963. The new company made bodies for five Leyland Leopard for West Harlepool Corporation Transport and four double-deckers on AEC Regent V (3) and Leyland PD2 (1) chassis for Ayrshire Bus Owners Group. The Pacesetter and Pacesaver bodies were introduced in 1964. The smaller Pacetraveller, Pacemaker, and Pacerider models were introduced in later years. Strachans also built a variety of other specialised bodies including battery electric milk floats, personnel carriers for UNICEF, platform wagons for British Road Services, and double decker racing car carrier.

==Superior Coach Corporation==
In 1969 Strachans obtained the rights from the Superior Coach Company of Lima, Ohio to manufacture, assemble, and distribute Superior bus bodies in Europe. Strachans were also given exclusive global rights to modify the bus bodies from eight foot wide to seven foot six inches. This resulted in them receiving an order of 100 CKD bodies from Ghana and a later order from the Bahrain Petroleum Company.

==Demise==
In the early 70&#x27;s sales had fallen and this, coupled with a strike in 1973, led to the parent company closing the factory down in mid 1974.

<text>Michael Mignola (; born September 16, 1960) is an American comic book writer best known for creating &quot;Hellboy&quot; for Dark Horse Comics, part of a shared universe of titles including &quot;B.P.R.D.&quot;, &quot;Abe Sapien&quot;, &quot;Lobster Johnson&quot;, and various spin-offs. He has also created other supernatural and paranormal themed titles for Dark Horse including &quot;Baltimore&quot;, &quot;Joe Golem&quot;, and &quot;The Amazing Screw-On Head&quot;.

==Early life==
Mike Mignola was born September 16, 1960. He was raised Catholic.

==Career==
===Marvel and DC===
Mignola was born in Berkeley, California. He began his career in 1980 by illustrating spots in &quot;The Comic Reader&quot;. His first published piece was in &quot;The Comic Reader&quot; #183, a spot illustration of Red Sonja (pg. 9). His first published front cover was &quot;The Comic Reader&quot; #196 in November 1981. In 1982 he graduated from the California College of the Arts with a BFA in Illustration.

In 1983 he worked as an inker at Marvel Comics on &quot;Daredevil&quot; and &quot;Power Man and Iron Fist&quot; and later became the penciler on titles such as &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;Alpha Flight&quot;, and the &quot;Rocket Raccoon&quot; limited series.

In 1987, he began working for DC Comics as well. He drew the &quot;Phantom Stranger&quot; and &quot;World of Krypton&quot; limited series. With writer Jim Starlin, Mignola produced the &quot;Cosmic Odyssey&quot; miniseries in 1988. Mignola drew covers for several Batman stories, including &quot;&quot; and &quot;Dark Knight, Dark City&quot;. Writer Brian Augustyn and Mignola crafted the &quot;Gotham by Gaslight&quot; one-shot in 1989.
In an early 2000s interview, Mignola was asked if his 1988 cover art and cover text for &quot;Batman&quot; #428 anticipated the telephone vote for the death of the second Robin (Jason Todd). Mignola responded:

&quot;It&#x27;s so amazing to me that people are still talking about that damn thing. I didn&#x27;t know if he was going to live or die, because I did the cover ahead of time. So the idea was: I&#x27;ll draw him dead, and if he lives, then it&#x27;s just a cover of him being badly hurt. I&#x27;ve gotta say---I don&#x27;t think I was giving it a lot of thought. I never imagined I&#x27;d be talking about it all these years later.&quot;

When asked if fans continued to question him about that cover, he replied, &quot;You know, it does crop up. When people talk about my career, that is one of the covers that a lot of people kind of go back to. I wish I had something profound to say about it. But at the time, it was just another job.&quot; In contrast, Mignola did not address his cover illustration of the Joker, and the accompanying cover text, for &quot;Batman&quot; #429. His visual depiction of the Joker anticipated prospective advertisements for his work in &quot;Gotham by Gaslight&quot;, yet the cover text still adhered to the &quot;Death in the Family&quot; storyline. This Elseworlds Joker is only briefly discussed in &quot;Gotham by Gaslight&quot; as a man who married ten wealthy widows, poisoned all ten with strychnine, and then ingested the poison himself when police attempted an arrest, resulting in partial facial paralysis. Mignola included a black-and-white police sketch in &quot;Gotham by Gaslight&quot; that did not replicate his &quot;Batman&quot; #429 cover art, choosing instead to root that Elseworlds incarnation of the Joker in Conrad Veidt&#x27;s 1928 portrayal of Gwynplaine for &quot;The Man Who Laughs&quot;. A scene from Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot;, released in June 1989 (United States), additionally featured Jack Nicholson&#x27;s Joker in a top hat, but without a monocle. Two years later, Jack Shaheen published an assessment of Islamophobia pervasive in Jim Starlin&#x27;s plot and Jim Aparo&#x27;s interior pencils for &quot;Death in the Family,&quot; particularly &quot;Batman&quot; #429, which prompted debates over Mignola&#x27;s intentions.

Through the early 1990s Mignola worked on covers and backup features for various DC and Marvel Comics. He collaborated twice with writer Howard Chaykin. In 1990–1991, they produced the &quot;Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser&quot; limited series for Epic Comics, with inker Al Williamson. This was followed with the &quot;Ironwolf: Fires of the Revolution&quot; graphic novel in 1992.

===&quot;Hellboy&quot; and related spinoffs===
====&quot;Hellboy&quot;====
Prior to 1994 Mignola&#x27;s career had been spent doing work-for-hire illustration for corporate publishers. That year, Dark Horse Comics released &quot;&quot;, Mignola&#x27;s creator-owned project. Though he wrote the story himself, it was scripted by John Byrne. The next &quot;Hellboy&quot; story, &quot;&quot;, was completely written and drawn by Mignola. Since then all &quot;Hellboy&quot; stories have been written solely by Mignola with the exception of &quot;&quot;, which was co-written by Joshua Dysart.

&quot;&quot; (2006) was the first &quot;Hellboy&quot; story not drawn by Mignola, featuring the art of Richard Corben. Corben would return to draw many flashback stories for the series. Other artists have also had a hand in drawing flashback stories including Jason Shawn Alexander, Kevin Nowlan and Scott Hampton. In 2007, following after 2005&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, British artist Duncan Fegredo took over art duties on the ongoing story arc of &quot;Hellboy&quot; from &quot;&quot; onwards.

Mike Mignola returned as the full-time artist for &quot;Hellboy&quot; in 2012 for the series&#x27; conclusion, &quot;Hellboy in Hell&quot;.

====&quot;Abe Sapien&quot;====
In 1998 the first &quot;Hellboy&quot; spinoff, &quot;Abe Sapien&quot;, was launched. It was not written by Mike Mignola, but it did feature his &quot;Hellboy&quot; short story &quot;&quot; as a back-up. &quot;Abe Sapien&quot; did not take off properly until a decade later in 2008&#x27;s &quot;The Drowning&quot;. Since then it has had several short stories and beginning in 2013 it became an ongoing series with Scott Allie as the lead writer with Mignola.

====&quot;Lobster Johnson&quot;====
&quot;Lobster Johnson&quot; was the next spinoff, debuting as a back-up feature in 1999&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. The series got its own title later in 2007&#x27;s &quot;Lobster Johnson: The Iron Prometheus&quot;. It returned again with the miniseries &quot;The Burning Hand&quot; in 2012, followed by various short stories.

====&quot;B.P.R.D.&quot;====
&quot;B.P.R.D.&quot; was the third spinoff, but it was the first one which was conceived to be more than just a one-off side story, but rather a series of stories. It began with 2002&#x27;s &quot;Hollow Earth&quot;, which continued on from &quot;&quot;. Beyond that followed a series of short stories designed to explore what the B.P.R.D. series could be. 2004&#x27;s &quot;Plague of Frogs&quot; was the story that solidified what the series was, and would set the direction for future books to come, so much so that the first major story cycle is collected in omnibus editions titled &quot;B.P.R.D.: Plague of Frogs&quot;. A vast majority of the stories in this era were co-written with John Arcudi and drawn by Guy Davis.

&quot;B.P.R.D.: Hell on Earth&quot; is the main series continuing after the catastrophic events at the conclusion of the &quot;Plague of Frogs&quot; cycle. Guy Davis left the series in 2011 with the conclusion of &quot;Hell on Earth: Gods&quot;. Tyler Crook became the new ongoing artist beginning with &quot;Hell on Earth: Monsters&quot;, but he is joined by several regular artists, most notably James Harren and Laurence Campbell.

Continuing where &quot;Hell on Earth&quot; left off, &quot;The Devil You Know&quot; is written by Mike Mignola and Scott Allie with Laurence Campbell serving as the regular artist.

====&quot;Sir Edward Grey, Witchfinder&quot;====
&quot;Sir Edward Grey, Witchfinder&quot; (more commonly known simply as &quot;Witchfinder&quot;) began with a teaser story in 2008&#x27;s &quot;MySpace Dark Horse Presents&quot; #16, followed by a full miniseries in 2009. It follows the stories of the occult investigator, Sir Edward, agent of Queen Victoria.

====&quot;Frankenstein&quot;====
The &quot;Frankenstein&quot; began with &quot;Frankenstein Underground&quot; in 2015. Set in 1956, this miniseries follows Frankenstein (in the Hellboy Universe, the Frankenstein monster takes his father&#x27;s name) as he ventures into the Pellucidar-like Hollow Earth. This also canonized Mary Shelley&#x27;s novel &quot;Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus&quot;. The series was further expanded in 2020 with &quot;Frankenstein Undone&quot;, a direct sequel to Shelley&#x27;s novel.

====Spinoff miniseries====
Numerous spinoffs have been published that are set in the Hellboy universe:
* &quot;Sledgehammer 44&quot;: Set in World War II, this series is about the Epimetheus Vril Energy Suit created by Doctor Helena Gallargas.
* &quot;Frankenstein Underground&quot;: Set in 1956, this series follows the Frankenstein monster as he ventures into the Pellucidar-like Hollow Earth.
* &quot;Rise of the Black Flame&quot;: Set in 1923, this series explores how Raimund Diestel became the Black Flame.
* &quot;The Visitor: How &amp; Why He Stayed&quot;: This series follows the life of an alien visitor set to kill the infant Hellboy in 1944.
* &quot;Rasputin: The Voice of the Dragon&quot;: Set in 1941, this series follows Trevor Bruttenholm as he becomes an agent for the allied forces in World war II.
* &quot;Koshchei the Deathless&quot;: Hellboy and Koshchei sit in a pub in Hell and chat.

===The Outerverse===
&quot;Baltimore&quot; began with a 2007 illustrated novel, and continued as a comic book series. It was created by Mike Mignola and Christopher Golden.

Like &quot;Baltimore&quot;, &quot;Joe Golem: Occult Detective&quot; began as an illustrated prose novel (2012&#x27;s &quot;Joe Golem and the Drowning City&quot;) and later continued as a comic book series. It was created by Mike Mignola and Christopher Golden and exists in a shared universe with &quot;Baltimore&quot; called &quot;The Outerverse&quot;.

==Style==
Alan Moore has described Mignola&#x27;s style as &quot;German expressionism meets Jack Kirby&quot;. His style has also been likened to an amalgamation of Hal Foster and Alex Toth.

==Film and television==
Mignola worked as an illustrator for Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s 1992 movie &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;. He was also the production designer for the Disney feature film &quot;&quot; in 2001 and a concept artist for 2002&#x27;s &quot;Blade II&quot; and Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Brave&quot;.

Mignola was hired by Bruce Timm to provide character designs for &quot;&quot; in 1991. His redesign of Mr. Freeze was used for the series.

Mignola&#x27;s design of the 1880s Batman costume from the comic &quot;Batman: Gotham by Gaslight&quot; appeared in &quot;&quot;.

&quot;Hellboy&quot; was made into a feature film in 2004 by director Guillermo del Toro. Mignola was closely involved with the movie&#x27;s production, and a sequel was released in 2008. &quot;Hellboy&quot; has been made into two direct-to-video animated films, &quot;&quot; in 2006 and &quot;&quot; in 2007.

Mignola&#x27;s &quot;The Amazing Screw-On Head&quot; debuted in 2006 on the Sci-Fi Channel, starring the voices of Paul Giamatti and David Hyde Pierce.

Mignola worked on the script for the R-rated &quot;Hellboy&quot; reboot film (2019), that was directed by Neil Marshall, and starred David Harbour as Hellboy. Mignola also co-wrote the screenplay for a 2024 reboot film titled &quot;&quot; alongside Chris Golden.

In 2022, Mignola&#x27;s career was highlighted in the documentary &quot;Mike Mignola: Drawing Monsters&quot;. Directed by Kevin Konrad Hanna and Jim Demonakos, this documentary film explores Mignola&#x27;s journey in creating the &quot;Hellboy&quot; series and features interviews with industry figures like Guillermo del Toro and Neil Gaiman. The documentary has been noted for its comprehensive portrayal of Mignola&#x27;s impact on the worlds of comics and film.

==Personal life==
As of 2014, Mignola resides in Los Angeles with his wife and daughter.

Regarding the influence of his religious upbringing on his artwork, Mignola explained in a 2014 interview, &quot;No, I don&#x27;t believe in anything, really. Not on a conscious level. That is the beauty of it. I was raised Catholic. I was taught a bunch of stuff. I find religion fascinating, but at no time does any of that tie my hands. I get to play with stuff without getting too reverential. There&#x27;s some Miltonian stuff to the geography of my Hell, the Hell I&#x27;m doing is much closer to the world I created in &quot;The Amazing Screw-On Head&quot;. It&#x27;s this pile, this jumble of old buildings for the most part. It&#x27;s entirely made out of everything I want to draw.&quot;

<doc id="850383" wikidata="Q240021" url="?curid=850383" title="Their Satanic Majesties Request">
<text>Their Satanic Majesties Request is the sixth studio album by the English rock band the Rolling Stones, released in December 1967 by Decca Records in the UK and by London Records in the United States. It was the first Rolling Stones album released in identical versions in both countries. The title is a play on the &quot;Her Britannic Majesty requests and requires&quot; text that appeared inside a British passport.

The band experimented with a psychedelic sound, incorporating unconventional elements such as Mellotron, sound effects, string arrangements, and African rhythms. The band members produced the album themselves as their manager/producer Andrew Loog Oldham had departed. The prolonged recording process was marked by drug use, court appearances, and jail terms by members of the band. The original LP cover features a lenticular image by the photographer Michael Cooper.

&quot;Satanic Majesties&quot; initially received mixed reviews. It was criticised as being derivative of the contemporaneous work of the Beatles, particularly their June 1967 release &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, with the similarities extending to the LP&#x27;s cover. In subsequent decades, however, it has gradually risen in critical reputation. Following the release, the Rolling Stones abandoned their psychedelic style for a stripped-down return to their roots in blues music.

==Recording==
Recording of &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot; began just after the release of &quot;Between the Buttons&quot; on 20 January 1967.
Because of court appearances and jail terms, the entire band was seldom present in the studio at one time, making recording of the album lengthy and disjointed. Band members frequently arrived with guests in tow, further interfering with productivity. One of the more level-headed members of the band during this time, Bill Wyman, wary of psychedelic drugs, wrote the song &quot;In Another Land&quot; to parody the Stones&#x27; current goings-on. In his 2002 book &quot;Rolling with the Stones&quot;, Wyman describes the situations in the studio:


The Stones experimented with many new instruments and sound effects during the sessions, including Mellotron, theremin, short wave radio static, and string arrangements by then-future Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones. Their producer and manager Andrew Loog Oldham, already fed up with the band&#x27;s lack of focus, distanced himself from them following their drug bust and finally quit, leaving them without a producer. As a result, &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot; would be the Stones&#x27; first self-produced album. Mick Jagger later opined this was not for the best, while expressing disdain for some of the tracks.

In another interview, Brian Jones stated:
Some of the album&#x27;s songs were recorded under various working titles, some appearing radically different from the final titles. These working titles include: &quot;Acid in the Grass&quot; (&quot;In Another Land&quot;), &quot;I Want People to Know&quot; (&quot;2000 Man&quot;), &quot;Flowers in Your Bonnet&quot; (&quot;She&#x27;s a Rainbow&quot;), &quot;Fly My Kite&quot; (&quot;The Lantern&quot;), &quot;Toffee Apple&quot; (&quot;2000 Light Years from Home&quot;), and &quot;Surprise Me&quot; (&quot;On with the Show&quot;). In 1998, a bootleg box set of eight CDs with outtakes from the &quot;Satanic&quot; sessions was released, and it shows the band developing the songs over multiple takes as well as the experimentation that went into the recording of the album.

==Title and packaging==

The working title of the album was &quot;Cosmic Christmas&quot;, or &quot;The Rolling Stones&#x27; Cosmic Christmas&quot; – in the hidden coda titled &quot;Cosmic Christmas&quot; (following &quot;Sing This All Together (See What Happens)&quot;), a slowed-down version of the tune &quot;We Wish You a Merry Christmas&quot; is played on an oscillator. The album was released in South Africa and the Philippines as &quot;The Stones Are Rolling&quot; because of the word &quot;Satanic&quot; in the title.

One proposed cover, a photograph of Jagger naked on a cross, was scrapped by the record company for being &quot;in bad taste&quot;. The initial LP of the album featured a three-dimensional picture of the band on the cover by photographer Michael Cooper. When viewed in a certain way, the lenticular image shows the band members&#x27; faces turning towards each other, with the exception of Jagger, whose hands appear crossed in front of him. Looking closely at its cover, one can see the faces of each of the four Beatles, reportedly a response to the Beatles&#x27; inclusion of a Shirley Temple doll wearing a &quot;Welcome the Rolling Stones&quot; sweater on the cover of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. Later editions replaced the glued-on three-dimensional image with a photograph due to high production costs. A limited edition LP version in the 1980s reprinted the original 3D cover design; immediately following the reissue, it was claimed that the master materials for reprinting the 3D cover were intentionally destroyed, implying that faithful recreations of the cover would no longer be possible, but this has since been proven false by numerous re-issues. The lenticular album cover was featured, although shrunk down, for a (Japanese) SHM-CD release in 2008.

The original cover design called for the lenticular image to take up the entire front cover, but finding this to be prohibitively expensive it was decided to reduce the size of the photo and surround it with the blue-and-white graphic design.

The entire cover design is elaborate, with a dense photo collage filling most of the inside cover (along with a maze) designed by Michael Cooper, and a painting by Tony Meeuwissen on the back cover depicting the four elements (Earth, Water, Fire, and Air). In some editions, the blue-and-white wisps on the front cover are used in a red-and-white version on the paper inner sleeve. The inner-cover collage has dozens of images, taken from reproductions of old master paintings (Ingres, Poussin, da Vinci, among others), Indian mandalas and portraits, astronomy (including a large image of the planet Saturn), flowers, world maps, etc. The maze on the inside cover of the UK and US releases cannot be completed: a wall at about a half radius in from the lower left corner means one can never arrive at the goal labelled &quot;It&#x27;s Here&quot; in the centre of the maze.

It was the first of four Stones albums to feature a novelty cover; the others were the zipper on &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; (1971), the cut-out faces on &quot;Some Girls&quot; (1978), and the stickers on &quot;Undercover&quot; (1983).

At some point around 1997, rumors were first heard that the album existed as a promo version, including a silk padding. A pink padded version was presented by photo accompanied by a letter from the Decca Copyright Department, but it was shown that the letter does not match the album it was intended to authenticate making it almost entirely certain that this was a forgery.

==Release and reception==

Released in December 1967, &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot; reached No. 3 in the UK and No. 2 in the US (easily going gold), but its commercial performance declined rapidly. It was soon viewed as a pretentious, poorly conceived attempt to outdo the Beatles and &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (released in May 1967), often explained by drug trials and excesses in contemporary musical fashion, although John Lennon and Paul McCartney did provide backing vocals (uncredited) on &quot;We Love You&quot; (recorded during the &quot;Satanic Majesties Request&quot; sessions, but released as a single a few months before the album). The Wyman-composed &quot;In Another Land&quot; was released as a single, with the artist credit listed as Bill Wyman, rather than the Rolling Stones (the B-Side, &quot;The Lantern&quot;, was credited to the Rolling Stones).

The production, in particular, came in for harsh criticism from Jon Landau in the fifth issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and Jimmy Miller (recommended by the album&#x27;s engineer, Glyn Johns) was asked to produce the Stones&#x27; subsequent albums, on which they would return to the hard-driving blues that earned them fame early in their career. In an April 1968 album review, Richard Corliss of the &quot;New York Times&quot; was also critical of the production value stating &quot;... their imagination seems to have dried up when it comes to some of the arrangements. While still better than their previous ones, the arrangements are often ragged, fashionably monotonous and off-key.&quot; Despite this he gave the album an overall positive review, going as far as calling it a better concept album than &quot;Of Cabbages and Kings&quot; (1967, by Chad &amp; Jeremy), &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot; (1968, by Vanilla Fudge) and even &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1967, by the Beatles). In a 1970 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Lennon commented on the album: &quot;&quot;Satanic Majesties&quot; is &quot;Pepper&quot;. &#x27;We Love You&#x27;... that&#x27;s &#x27;All You Need Is Love&#x27;.&quot;

== Legacy and reappraisal ==

Keith Richards himself has been critical of the album in later years. While he likes some of the songs (&quot;2000 Light Years from Home&quot;, &quot;Citadel&quot;, and &quot;She&#x27;s a Rainbow&quot;), he stated, &quot;the album was a load of crap.&quot; Mick Jagger disavowed the album in 1995, saying: &quot;it&#x27;s not very good. It had interesting things on it, but I don&#x27;t think any of the songs are very good. There&#x27;s two good songs on it. The rest of them are nonsense.&quot; There are only two songs from the album which the Stones performed live, &quot;2000 Light Years from Home&quot; (1989–90 world tour, 2013 Glastonbury Festival), and &quot;She&#x27;s a Rainbow&quot; (1997–98 Bridges to Babylon Tour and occasionally on concert tours in the late 2010s.)

&quot;Satanic Majesties&quot; has been reassessed positively by critics. In a retrospective 1977 review, Robert Christgau of the &quot;Village Voice&quot; stated that the album &quot;no doubt contains several great songs&quot; despite negative reception from some. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that &quot;Perhaps psychedelia wasn&#x27;t a natural fit for the earthbound Stones, but the dissonance between their gritty rhythms and ornate, precocious arrangements is enthralling, not in the least because there&#x27;s no other record—by the Stones or anybody else—that sounds quite like this.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s Bob Eder called the mono mix of the album a distinct improvement over the stereo version, describing it as transforming the maligned album into &quot;superb, punky psychedelia.&quot; Richie Unterberger of AllMusic writes:

In August 2002, &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot; was reissued in a new remastered CD, LP and DSD by ABKCO Records. In 2008, the album was released in SHM-CD for Japan using the same 2002 remastered, and in December of that year it was reissued (also as a SHM-CD Japanese only release) with the original lenticular cover for the first time in that format. In May 2011, the album was reissued on SHM-SACD. In 2017, a set containing two LPs (mono/stereo) as well as two SACDs (mono/stereo) was released, with another new remastered for the stereo version. In 2018, the album was reissued as part of the Record Store Day. The release contained the 2017 remastered stereo version of the album pressed on transparent coloured vinyl (180g) and also featured the 3D-style sleeve.

<doc id="850385" wikidata="Q286270" url="?curid=850385" title="Judo at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>[[Judo]] at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] took place in the Ano Liossia Olympic Hall and featured 368 judoka competing for 14 gold medals with seven different weight categories in both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s competitions. Japan dominated the event by taking 8 gold and 2 silver medals.

Gold and silver medals in each weight class were determined by a single-elimination bracket. There was a repechage for those who are eliminated by one of the eventual semifinalists. Since there are four semifinalists, this means that four of the losers of the round of 32 (i.e., 25%) faced four of the losers from the round of 16 (50%). The winners of these matches faced the four judokas who have lost in the quarterfinals. The winners, then, of these four matches faced each other to narrow the repechage field down to two judokas. Until this stage, the repechage has been segregated into two distinct halves, with each successive competitor facing another one from the same half of the original bracket; but each of the two judokas who emerge from the repechage challenged the loser of the &quot;other&quot; bracket&#x27;s semifinal. (Since these two always come from opposite halves of the original bracket, they could not have faced each other already.) The winners of these two matches were each awarded a bronze medal, making judo unusual among Olympic events in not determining a single third-place finisher.

There was controversy in the men&#x27;s competition, when Iranian competitor and two-times world champion Arash Miresmaeili weighed in overweight and was disqualified before a match in which he would have faced Israeli judoka Ehud Vaks. Miresmaeili&#x27;s comments strongly suggested that he had intentionally disqualified himself so as not to compete against an Israeli.

== Qualification ==
Together with 366 directly qualified athletes, there were 18 invitational places, making up a total athlete quota of 386 athletes—229 men, 157 women.

An NOC may enter up to one athlete per weight category. The qualifying places were allocated as follows:

 If the host nation qualified athletes directly through the world championships or European continental qualification system, the reserved entry places were reallocated as part of the European continental qualification.

Continental qualification places is allocated through the ranking system based on the major tournaments on the continent (continental championships, qualification tournaments). More important tournaments and tournaments closer to the Olympics carried more points.

<doc id="850387" wikidata="Q4933852" url="?curid=850387" title="Bob Ryan">
<text>Robert P. Ryan (born February 21, 1946) is an American sportswriter, formerly with &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, and author. He has been described as &quot;the quintessential American sportswriter&quot; and a basketball guru, and is well known for his coverage of the sport including his famous stories covering the Boston Celtics in the 1970s. After graduating from Boston College, Ryan started as a sports intern for the &quot;Globe&quot; on the same day as Peter Gammons, and later worked with other notable &quot;Globe&quot; sportswriters Will McDonough and Leigh Montville. In early 2012, Ryan announced his retirement from sports writing after 44 years, effective at the conclusion of the 2012 Summer Olympics. His final column in the &quot;Globe&quot; was published August 12, 2012.

==Biography and career==
Born in Trenton, New Jersey, Ryan grew up in a house &quot;that revolved around going to games,&quot; and went to high school at the Lawrenceville School from 1960 to 1964. He graduated from Boston College as a history major in 1968.

===Celtics beat writer===
In the fall of 1969, a vacancy on the Celtics beat of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; was created, and Ryan got the job. Ryan was hired by the paper&#x27;s morning sports editor Francis Rosa. While covering the Celtics, Ryan developed a close relationship with the Celtics organization. Ryan would even go out to dinner with the team. Ryan sat at the press table eight seats from the Celtics&#x27; bench, where colleagues referred to him as the &quot;Commissioner&quot;, not unlike Peter Gammons&#x27;s nickname. Boston Sports Media critic Bruce Allen has said, &quot;His passion is not faked.&quot;

One night Hue Hollins, the referee, went to the press table to explain a call to Ryan during a time-out even though he was not obligated to. Another time Ryan wrote a column about the Washington Bullets&#x27; Rick Mahorn and how he played dirty under the hoop. When Mahorn was called for a foul Gene Shue, the Bullets&#x27; coach, turned around and said, &quot;That&#x27;s your fault, Bob Ryan, your fault!&quot; Dennis Johnson was often annoyed with Ryan and would go up to the press table and say, &quot;Hey, Bob, keep it down. We got a game going on here&quot; when Ryan sideline coached. From Ryan&#x27;s first column on Larry Bird headlined &quot;Celtics draft Bird for oh what a future&quot; to his last &quot;Larry! Larry! Larry!&quot; Ryan was always a fan of his and eventually co-authored a book with him.

In Tom Heinsohn&#x27;s book &quot;Give &#x27;em the Hook&quot;, Heinsohn is negative towards Ryan. Ryan, who began writing for the &quot;Globe&quot; in Heinsohn&#x27;s rookie season as a coach, would make friends with the players and vent their feelings towards Heinsohn, their fans, and their teammates, claims Heinsohn. Heinsohn didn&#x27;t like how he didn&#x27;t feel in control of his team. Heinsohn believes that Ryan started to &quot;think of himself as another member of the family&quot; and that he even started coaching the team through his beat stories. Heinsohn goes on to talk about Ryan&#x27;s bloated ego and the fact that he was then thinking of himself as a basketball guru. Heinsohn also says while noting disapproval of Ryan that at the time anyone who lived in Boston and even remotely followed basketball read Ryan&#x27;s columns. In recent years Ryan has been less critical of Celtics coaches, including Doc Rivers, of whom he said, &quot;I&#x27;m a Doc guy.&quot;

=== General sports columnist ===

In 1982, Ryan would hand the torch of the &quot;Globe&quot; Celtics beat to the not-yet well-known Dan Shaughnessy, and later Jackie MacMullan. He did this in order to go to Boston television station WCVB for a couple of years. Ryan ended up hating it and moved back to the Celtics beat in 1984 for two more seasons, before getting promoted to general sports columnist in 1989.

Ryan would cover 20 NBA finals, 20 Final Fours, nine World Series, five Super Bowls, the last seven Olympics and many other events. Later, Ryan became less basketball-oriented and more general sports-oriented. He continues to write for &quot;Basketball Times&quot;. Ryan is a voter for the Baseball Hall of Fame.

=== Retirement ===

At 60, Ryan wanted his retirement from the job to be graceful: &quot;I&#x27;m not bitter. I enjoy my job and I still think I do it well, but they are chipping away, chipping away and they are making it far less pleasurable. I want to get out when I feel like getting out. If you stay around too long, there is no way you can dictate your terms,&quot; he said. Ryan also asked, &quot;How do you explain to Stephen A. Smith that he has no idea of the game and how much fun it was? He thinks he knows everything, but he will never know what I know about the Celtics.&quot;

On February 14, 2012, during a podcast with Bill Simmons on Grantland.com, Ryan announced that he would retire after the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Said Ryan, &quot;I really and truly believe that my time has come and gone; that the dynamics of the business, of what it takes, what it means to be involved in the sports business with all the Tweeting and the blogging and all the stuff, and an audience with a different taste - it&#x27;s not me anymore. I&#x27;m not comfortable.&quot; Ryan indicated that he would stay involved with sports in a part-time capacity after retirement, but is not interested in continuing at the pace he does now. Ryan&#x27;s last day as a Red Sox reporter was July 16, 2012.

Ryan&#x27;s final column in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; was published August 12, 2012. He continues writing on a part-time basis as a columnist emeritus. He also remains a regular on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Around The Horn&quot; and occasionally guest hosts &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot; with Michael Wilbon or Tony Kornheiser.

In March 2017, Ryan launched his own podcast, &quot;Bob Ryan&#x27;s Boston Podcast&quot;. He has hosted many well-known former Boston athletes such as Larry Bird, Steve Grogan, Danny Ainge, Troy Brown, and Dave Cowens. Other well-known sports figures such as former NBA commissioner David Stern have also been guests.

After retiring, Ryan became the Sports Reporter in Residence at High Point University.

==Controversies==

===Joumana Kidd comments===
In May 2003, Ryan appeared on &quot;Sports Final&quot;, a local sports talk show airing on WBZ-TV. At that time, Ryan said that Joumana Kidd, then-wife of then-New Jersey Nets guard Jason Kidd needed someone to &quot;smack&quot; her for taking her son T.J., then four years old, to NBA playoff night games where they could be taunted. He accused Joumana of being an exhibitionist and using the child as a prop to get television time. The show&#x27;s host, Bob Lobel, asked Ryan to retract his statement immediately:

* Lobel: &quot;You just don&#x27;t want to smack her. You don&#x27;t mean to say that.&quot;
* Ryan: &quot;Alright.&quot;
* Lobel: &quot;I mean. Do you? Really, do you? Tell me you don&#x27;t.&quot;
* Ryan: &quot;Why should I say anything different here than I said all last playoffs last year?&quot;

The comments struck a chord because in 2001, Joumana Kidd had been the victim of domestic violence by then-husband Jason. 
Ryan returned to Boston to meet with executives at the &quot;Globe&quot;. Ryan publicly apologized, but the &quot;Globe&quot; still suspended him and barred him from television for one month. &quot;Four weeks took my breath away. But I&#x27;ll abide by it,&quot; he later said. Then Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney chastised Ryan for his comments.

===Theo Epstein confrontation===
Ryan had a run-in with Red Sox general manager Theo Epstein. In November 2006, he had a small unfriendly exchange with Epstein saying &quot;on behalf of an eager constituency, I hope the rumor (of a J. D. Drew deal) isn&#x27;t true.&quot;

==Personal life==
Ryan and his wife Elaine, who have been married since 1969, have a daughter Jessica and a son Keith, who died in 2008. They are grandparents of triplets. The dedication page in &quot;Forty Eight Minutes&quot;, one of Ryan&#x27;s books, reads: &quot;To Elaine Ryan: In the next life, maybe you&#x27;ll get a nine-to-five man who makes seven figures.&quot; Ryan has also done humanitarian fundraisers for years to help inner-city teenagers with their educations. Ryan lives in Hingham, Massachusetts.

=== Son&#x27;s death ===
On January 28, 2008, Ryan&#x27;s 37-year-old son Keith was found dead in his home in Islamabad, Pakistan. Initial reports indicated that his death was an apparent suicide; however, reports in the Pakistani newspapers Dawn and The News International indicated that Ryan&#x27;s death could be investigated as a murder. A State Department spokesperson would only say that the death was under investigation. Bob Ryan released the following statement: &quot;Everyone is devastated. I am well aware of these reports and we are very concerned about that. (But) we have no reason at this time to doubt the official version&quot;.

Keith had been working in Pakistan since December 2006 as an attache for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Keith was a graduate of Hingham High School (1988), Trinity College, the London School of Economics and Boston College Law School. He had previously worked for the U.S. Border Patrol, LAPD and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, where he was assigned to the violent gang task force. Keith was married to Kate and had three children, Conor, John, and Amelia, who live in Silver Spring, Maryland.

<text>The Ford CDW27 platform is a former automobile platform produced by Ford in worldwide markets from 1993 to 2007. Used for midsize cars, the CDW27 architecture was a &quot;world car&quot; (co-designed by Ford and Mazda), becoming the second Ford world car (after the 1980 Ford Escort). 

The CDW architecture was developed over six years, costing $6 billion at the time of its 1993 launch; the shared development saved approximately 25% over developing separate vehicles for Ford and Ford of Europe. The Global and the American versions were to have about 75 percent parts commonality.

Derived from the Mazda GE platform (used by the Mazda Cronos/626 and the Mazda MX-6/Ford Probe), the platform replaced the DE-1 platform (Ford Sierra) and the CE14 platform (Ford Tempo/Mercury Topaz) under a single product range. First used for the 1993 Ford Mondeo, North America began usage of the CDW27 for 1995 with the Ford Contour.

During the 2000s, the architecture was phased out in favor of two midsize platforms developed separately; the CD3 architecture (developed with Mazda) was used in North America and the EUCD architecture (shared with Volvo) was used by Ford of Europe. 

== Models ==

=== CDW27 (first generation) ===

* Ford Mondeo Mk I (1993–1996)

<text>The Democratic Solidarity Party (&quot;Partido Solidaridad Democrática&quot;) was a political liberal party in Cuba. Although changes to the Cuban constitution in 1992 decriminalized the right to form political parties other than the Communist Party of Cuba, these parties are not permitted to campaign or engage in any public political activities on the island. The Democratic Solidarity party described itself as &quot;an organization from within Cuba promoting democracy and the respect for human rights by the peaceful route.&quot; The last President of the party was Fernando Sánchez López. The party was a full member of Liberal International.

<text>The Abingdon was an English assembled car built in small numbers in 1922 and 1923 in a factory in Tyseley, Birmingham. It used an 11-9hp 1490 cc 4-cylinder Dorman engine and a 3-speed gearbox. Only 12 were made. Production was hampered by financial difficulties for the Wrigley company, who supplied key components such as the steering gear and three-speed gearbox.

The company also produced Abingdon Motorcycles until 1925. In 1905 and 1906, it had produced the 5 hp (4 kW) AKD tricar.

<text>The Liberal Party of Cuba (), was one of the major political parties in Cuba from 1910 until the Cuban Revolution in the late 1950s, when it was exiled.

==History==
===Liberal governments===
Founded as the Autonomist Liberal Party (, PLA), in 1878 and renamed in 1898, the party first contested elections in 1910, when it won 23 of the 41 seats in mid-term elections. They lost the 1912 elections to the Conjunción Patriótica alliance, and went on to finish second in elections in 1914, 1916 (in which they won the same number of seats in the House of Representatives as the National Conservative Party, but won fewer seats in the Senate) and 1918.

In the 1920 elections, the Liberal Party&#x27;s Alfredo Zayas y Alfonso won the presidential election, although the party lost the parliamentary elections to the National League. They went on to win the mid-term elections in 1922. For the 1924 elections the party formed an alliance with the Cuban Popular Party. The alliance&#x27;s Gerardo Machado won the presidential election, whilst it also won both the Senate and House elections.

In 1928 elections for a Constitutional Assembly were held, in which the party won 29 of the 55 seats. The party also won the mid-term elections in 1930 and 1932. For the 1936 general election the party was part of the Tripartite Coalition, alongside the Nationalist Union and Republican Action, which won both the presidential election (with Miguel Mariano Gómez as its candidate) and the parliamentary elections. The Liberal Party went on to win the 1938 mid-term elections.

===Liberal Party&#x27;s fall===
In the 1940 general elections the party was again part of an alliance, the People&#x27;s Socialist Coalition, alongside the Communist Revolutionary Union, Progressive Action, the Democratic National Association and the Republican Democratic Party. The alliance&#x27;s Fulgencio Batista won the presidential election, whilst the Liberal Party finished second in the House of Representatives elections. The party won 21 seats in the 1942 mid-term elections, matched by the Democratic Party.

The 1944 general election saw the party finish second in the House of Representative elections, with a similar performance in the 1946 mid-term elections. For the 1948 general election the party put forward a joint candidate with the Democratic Party, but lost to the Auténtico-Republican&#x27;s Carlos Prío Socarrás. The party also finished second in the parliamentary elections.

An alliance with the Democratic Party and the Partido Auténtico won the 1950 mid-term elections. However, for the 1954 elections the party allied against the Partido Auténtico alongside Progressive Action, the Radical Union and the Republican Democratic Party, putting forward the victorious Batista as their presidential candidate. The Liberal Party finished second in the House elections behind Progressive Action.

==Successor==
The modern party, named National Liberal Party of Cuba, was founded in 2004. It is a member of Liberal International.

<doc id="850405" wikidata="Q594438" url="?curid=850405" title="Mark Waid">
<text>Mark Waid (; born March 21, 1962) is an American comic book writer best known for his work on DC Comics titles &quot;The Flash&quot;, &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; and &quot;&quot; as well as his work on &quot;Captain America&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; and &quot;Daredevil&quot; for Marvel. Other comics publishers he has done work for include Fantagraphics, Event, Top Cow, Dynamite, and Archie Comics.

From August 2007 to December 2010, Waid served as Editor-in-Chief and later Chief Creative Officer of Boom! Studios, where he also published his creator-owned series &quot;Irredeemable&quot; and &quot;Incorruptible&quot;.

In October 2018, Waid joined Humanoids Publishing as Director of Creative Development before being promoted to Publisher in February 2020.

==Early life==
Waid was born in Hueytown, Alabama. He has stated that his comics work was heavily influenced by &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #369–370 (1968), the two-part &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; story by Jim Shooter and Mort Weisinger that introduced the villain Mordru. Waid has stated that the story is &quot;a blueprint for everything I write.&quot;

==Career==
===1980s–1990s===
Waid entered the comics field during the mid-1980s as an editor and writer on Fantagraphics Books&#x27; comic book fan magazine, &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot;. Waid&#x27;s first comic book story &quot;The Puzzle of the Purloined Fortress&quot;, an eight-page Superman story, was published in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #572 (Oct. 1985).

In 1987, Waid was hired as an editor for DC Comics where he worked on such titles as &quot;Action Comics&quot;, &quot;Doom Patrol&quot;, &quot;Infinity, Inc.&quot;, &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot;, &quot;Secret Origins&quot;, and &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, as well as various one-shots including &quot;Batman: Gotham by Gaslight&quot;. With &quot;Gotham by Gaslight&quot;, and in tandem with writer Brian Augustyn, Waid co-created DC&#x27;s Elseworlds imprint.

In 1989 Waid left editorial work for freelance writing assignments. He worked for DC&#x27;s short-lived Impact Comics line where he wrote &quot;The Comet&quot; and scripted dialogue for &quot;Legend of the Shield&quot;.

In 1992 Waid began the assignment which would bring him to wider recognition in the comics industry, when he was hired to write &quot;The Flash&quot; by editor Brian Augustyn. Waid stayed on the title for an eight-year run. He wrote a Metamorpho limited series in 1993 and created the character known as Impulse in &quot;The Flash&quot; (vol. 2) #92 (July 1994). Impulse was launched into his own series in April 1995 by Waid and artist Humberto Ramos. In November of that same year, Waid and Howard Porter collaborated on the &quot;Underworld Unleashed&quot; limited series, which served as the center of a company-wide crossover storyline.

His first major project for Marvel Comics was as one of the writers of the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; crossover. He later co-created the Onslaught character for the &quot;X-Men&quot; line.

Marvel editors Ralph Macchio and Mark Gruenwald hired him as Gruenwald&#x27;s successor as writer of &quot;Captain America&quot;, during which Waid was paired with artist Ron Garney. Waid and Garney garnered critical praise for their run on the title, remaining on it until the title was relaunched with a different creative team as part of the 1996–1997 &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; storyline. Rob Liefeld offered Waid the opportunity to script &quot;Captain America&quot; over plots and artwork by his studio, but Waid declined. That storyline ran a full year, after which Waid and Garney returned to the title for another relaunched series, &quot;Captain America&quot; volume 3, issues #1–23. Waid also wrote the short-lived spin-off series &quot;Captain America: Sentinel of Liberty&quot; from 1998 to 1999, having written 10 of the 12 issues (skipping issues #7 and 10).

In 1996, Waid and artist Alex Ross produced the graphic novel &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;. This story, set in the future of the DC Universe, depicted the fate of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and other heroes as the world around them changed. It was written in reaction to the &quot;grim and gritty&quot; comics of the 1980s and 1990s. DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed that &quot;Waid&#x27;s deep knowledge of the heroes&#x27; pasts served them well, and Ross&#x27; unique painted art style made a powerful statement about the reality of the world they built.&quot; Many of the ideas introduced in &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; were later integrated into the present-day DC Universe, and Waid himself wrote a follow-up to the series, &quot;The Kingdom&quot;.
Waid and writer Grant Morrison collaborated on a number of projects that would successfully reestablish DC&#x27;s Justice League to prominence. Waid&#x27;s contributions included &quot;JLA: Year One&quot;, as well as work on the ongoing series. The two writers developed the concept of Hypertime to explain problems with continuity in the DC Universe, which was first introduced in &quot;The Kingdom&quot;.

===2000s===

Waid collaborated with artists Bryan Hitch and Paul Neary on &quot;JLA&quot; and the &quot;JLA: Heaven&#x27;s Ladder&quot; (Oct. 2000) one-shot.

In 2000, Waid co-wrote a series named &quot;Empire&quot; with Barry Kitson, whose protagonist was a Doctor Doom-like supervillain named Golgoth who had defeated all superheroes and conquered the world. The series was originally published by Gorilla Comics, a company formed by Waid, Kurt Busiek and several others, but the company folded after only two issues were published. &quot;Empire&quot; was completed under the DC Comics label in 2003 and 2004. Waid wrote the first year of Crossgen&#x27;s &quot;Ruse&quot; series.

Waid began an acclaimed run as writer of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; in 2002 with his former &quot;Flash&quot; artist Mike Wieringo, with Marvel releasing their debut issue, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; vol. 3 #60 (Oct. 2002) at the promotional price of 9 cents U.S. By June 2003, Marvel publisher Bill Jemas tried to convince Waid to abandon his &quot;high-adventure&quot; approach to the series, and making the book into, in Waid&#x27;s words, &quot;a wacky suburban dramedy where Reed&#x27;s a nutty professor who creates amazing but impractical inventions, Sue&#x27;s the office-temp breadwinner, the cranky neighbor is their new &#x27;arch-enemy,&#x27; etc.&quot; Waid, who felt that this was too much of a departure from what he had been hired to write, initially declined. After some discussion with editor Tom Brevoort, Waid found a way to make the requested changes, but by then, the decision had been made to fire Waid and Wieringo from the series. The resulting fan backlash led to Waid and Wieringo&#x27;s reinstatement on the title by that September. Waid and Wieringo completed their run on &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; with issue #524 (May 2005), by which time the previously relaunched series had returned to its original numbering.

In 2003 Waid wrote the origin of the &quot;modern&quot; Superman with &quot;&quot;, a twelve-part limited series which was meant to be the new official origin story of the Man of Steel. &quot;Birthright&quot; contained several characters and elements from the Silver and Modern Age Superman comic books and homages to &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot; and the &quot;Smallville&quot; television series.

Waid returned to writing &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; in December 2004, teaming again with Barry Kitson. He finished his run on the series with issue #30 (July 2007). In 2005, Waid signed a two-year exclusive contract with DC Comics. He co-wrote the &quot;52&quot; limited series with Grant Morrison, Geoff Johns, Greg Rucka, and Keith Giffen that lasted for one year and covered the events that take place during the year in the DC Universe following &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;. Another project for DC was a new launch of &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; with artist George Pérez, and a brief return to &quot;The Flash&quot;.

On July 27, 2007, at San Diego Comic-Con, Boom! Studios announced that Waid would join Boom! as Editor-in-Chief the following month. As his non-creator assignments at DC lapsed, he stated that all his future creator-owned work will be with Boom!.

Waid was promoted to Chief Creative Officer of BOOM! Studios in August 2010. That December, Waid announced he would be leaving that role, and return to freelance work, though he would continue writing for the publisher.

In the late 2000s Waid worked on the Spider-Man creative team, writing several issues of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, including a meeting between Spider-Man and Stephen Colbert in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #573 (Dec. 2008).

===2010s===

Waid scripted the opening of &quot;The Gauntlet&quot; storyline in issue #612 (Jan. 2010). Waid wrote the Doctor Strange mini-series &quot;Strange&quot;, and several series for Boom! Studios, notably &quot;Irredeemable&quot; with artist Peter Krause and its spinoff &quot;Incorruptible&quot;. In July 2011 Marvel relaunched a monthly &quot;Daredevil&quot; series with Waid on writing duties. Waid and artist Paolo Rivera garnered positive reviews for their work on the title, and earned multiple 2012 Eisner Awards, including Best Continuing Series and Best Single Issue for issue #7. In addition, Waid won Best Writer for his work on &quot;Daredevil&quot;, as well as his work on &quot;Irredeemable&quot;, and &quot;Incorruptible&quot;. Waid received a &quot;Best Writer&quot; Harvey Award as well for his &quot;Daredevil&quot; work. In November 2012, Waid and artist Leinil Francis Yu launched &quot;The Indestructible Hulk&quot; series for Marvel.

In 2011, Waid established a free digital comics website Thrillbent, launching the site with the title &quot;Insufferable&quot;. An essay posted on October 2, 2013, by Waid, titled &quot;An Open Letter To Young Freelancers&quot;, generated attention within the comics industry with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; describing it as &quot;an important commentary on business practices that are in a state of flux at publishers both large and small.&quot;
In 2014, Waid launched new series for &quot;Daredevil&quot; and &quot;The Hulk&quot; with artists Chris Samnee and Mark Bagley respectively. In December 2014, Waid&#x27;s &quot;S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; title began and it introduced several characters from the television series &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; into the Marvel comics universe. He later wrote &quot;All-New, All-Different Avengers&quot;, &quot;Black Widow&quot;, and &quot;The Avengers&quot;.

Waid and artist J. G. Jones produced &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; for Boom! Studios in July 2015.

In 2016, Waid and artist Humberto Ramos co-created &quot;The Champions&quot; for Marvel. The following year, Waid returned to the &quot;Captain America&quot; series beginning with issue #695 working with artist Chris Samnee. A new &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; series was launched by Waid and Jesus Saiz in 2018. Waid also launched with artist Javier Garrón a &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp&quot; miniseries to tie into the release of the 2019 film of the same name.

At the 2018 New York Comic Con, Humanoids Publishing announced it was creating an imprint called H1 whose contributing creators included Waid.

On April 9, 2019, Marvel announced that Waid would write a five-issue miniseries featuring the Invisible Woman, her first solo series since her debut in 1961.

===2020s===
In December 2021, it was announced that Waid would be writing a new ongoing for DC entitled &quot;Batman/Superman: World&#x27;s Finest&quot;, with Dan Mora serving as artist and beginning publication in March 2022. The events of &quot;World&#x27;s Finest&quot; would later set up the events of &quot;Batman vs Robin&quot; and &quot;Lazarus Planet&quot;, also written by Waid.

In April 2022, Waid was reported among the more than three dozen comics creators who contributed to Operation USA&#x27;s benefit anthology book, &quot;Comics for Ukraine: Sunflower Seeds&quot;, a project spearheaded by IDW Publishing Special Projects Editor Scott Dunbier, whose profits would be donated to relief efforts for Ukrainian refugees resulting from the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Waid teamed up with artist Gabriel Rodriguez (artist) to produce an original story with new characters created specifically for the anthology.

In November 2022, it was announced that Waid and Mora would be working on a new ongoing &quot;Shazam!&quot; series, beginning publication in May 2023. Mora departed from interior work with issue 6, while Waid left writing duties with issue 9.

In April 2023, it was announced that Waid would be writing two new projects for DC set to launch in July 2023. The first is a three-issue DC Black Label miniseries entitled &quot;Superman: The Last Days of Lex Luthor&quot;, illustrated by Bryan Hitch. It is a spiritual successor to &quot;Birthright&quot;. The second is a six-issue miniseries entitled &quot;World&#x27;s Finest: Teen Titans,&quot; illustrated by Emanuela Lupacchino.

In February 2024, it was announced that Waid would be writing &quot;Absolute Power&quot;, a 4-issue event miniseries that would conclude the Dawn of DC publishing initiative and lead directly into the DC All-In initiative. The series reunites Waid with artist Dan Mora and follows Amanda Waller, having teamed up with Failsafe and the Brainiac Queen, as she seek to put an end to the metahuman population of the DC Universe, once and for all. 

In July 2024, it was announced Waid would be reuniting with Chris Samnee for &quot;Batman and Robin: Year One&quot;, a 12-issue series set to begin publication in October 2024.

==Legal issues==
In September 2018 writer Richard Meyer, the creator of the YouTube channel Diversity &amp; Comics, filed a civil lawsuit in Texas against Waid, claiming defamation and tortious interference on Waid&#x27;s part. Meyer accused Waid of convincing Antarctic Press not to publish Meyer&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Jawbreakers&quot;. Waid launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to fight the suit, and denied having anything to do with Antarctic Press&#x27; decision, a statement verified in deposition by the publisher of Antarctic Press. Waid&#x27;s fellow comics creators Neil Gaiman, Kurt Busiek, Dan Slott and Yanick Paquette contributed to his campaign, while artist Ethan Van Sciver began a similar campaign for Meyer which quickly surpassed Waid&#x27;s in funding. Waid filed for the case to be dismissed. In December 2020, Meyer voluntarily withdrew the lawsuit and reached a confidential agreement.

==Personal life==
As of 2019, Waid lives in California.

<doc id="850416" wikidata="Q7283229" url="?curid=850416" title="Rags Morales">
<text>Ralph &quot;Rags&quot; Morales () is an American comic book artist known for his work on various books for DC Comics, including &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;, &quot;Countdown to Infinite Crisis&quot;, &quot;Batman Confidential&quot;, and The New 52 reboot of then Superman-centric &quot;Action Comics&quot;.

Morales is the co-creator, along with Brian Augustyn, of the 1990s version of &quot;Black Condor&quot;.

==Early life==
Rags Morales was born in New York. He is of Puerto Rican descent, and grew up in a predominantly white suburb of Landing NJ. Morales attended a number of vocational art classes, including The Kubert School in Dover, New Jersey.

==Career==
Morales&#x27; first professional work was penciling 19 issues of &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; with writer Jeff Grubb as part of the TSR line of books. Following &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;, Morales co-created and pencilled &quot;Black Condor&quot;.

Morales left DC Comics to do work for Valiant Comics, including &quot;Turok&quot;, &quot;Archer &amp; Armstrong&quot; and &quot;Geomancer&quot;. He also did some licensed work on a &quot;Sliders&quot; comic book, and work for Wizards of the Coast. After Valiant closed, Morales returned to his TSR roots, doing work for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; magazines and novella work for HarperCollins, such as Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Robotics&quot; and pen and ink work for Margaret Weis&#x27; &quot;Testament of the Dragon&quot;. He also taught anatomical illustration at a vo-tech school.

In 1999, Morales was made the penciler on DC&#x27;s on &quot;Hourman&quot;, penciling 20 of that series 25 issues before it was canceled in 2001. Over the course of the following year, he drew nine intermittent issues of &quot;JSA&quot; between issue #9 and issue #34, before moving onto &quot;Hawkman&quot; with writer Geoff Johns. It was also on &quot;Hawkman&quot; that he first worked with inker Michael Bair, with whom he has worked on most of his projects since. At the time Morales said &quot;when I saw the magic that Michael Bair added to my work, I knew I had to stick with this dude&quot;.

After &quot;Hawkman&quot;, Morales illustrated Brad Meltzer&#x27;s limited series &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;. Because of the importance of &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; to DC&#x27;s ongoing company-wide storyline, and because of the number of characters in it, including minor ones that had barely been seen in years, Morales used copious amounts of reference materials for character studies, including the use of famous actors&#x27; faces to give the characters unique facial features, and sometimes updating their costumes in the process. The series was eventually selected by The Young Adult Library Services Association (YALSA)&#x27;s 2007 recommended list of Great Graphic Novels For Teens.

Morales and Bair worked on &quot;Nightwing&quot; during Peter Tomasi&#x27;s run as writer on that title. He later worked on &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; #53 - 56, which were among the seven issues collected in to the &quot;Finest Worlds&quot; hardcover in 2009, and in trade paperback form in 2010.

In 2009 he contributed to the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; storyline with the three issues miniseries, &quot;Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps&quot;.

In June 2011, as part of DC Comics&#x27; massive relaunch of their entire superhero line, Morales was announced as the artist on the new Action Comics #1, teaming with writer Grant Morrison.

In September 2018, Morales was named Inkwell Awards Special Ambassador.

==Art style==
Regarding his figure work, Morales finds stock, poster-like standing poses difficult, preferring the more communicative movement seen among characters in narrative sequences, a forte he feels helped him attain the &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; assignment.

<doc id="850426" wikidata="Q7089862" url="?curid=850426" title="Omar al-Bayoumi">
<text>Omar al-Bayoumi (); is a Saudi national with alleged links to two of the 9/11 hijackers in the United States. Files of the U.S. FBI, dating to before the attacks, demonstrate that he was a Saudi Arabian intelligence agent. An FBI report, declassified in September 2021, lays out evidence that al-Bayoumi had links to known terrorists, provided significant support to 9/11 hijackers Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar upon their arrival in the U.S., and communicated with a key logistics facilitator for Osama bin Laden, each time immediately following significant logistics support to al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar. 

An FBI report, declassified in March 2022, states that &quot;there is a 50/50 chance [al-Bayoumi] had advanced knowledge the 9/11 attacks were to occur.&quot; Al-Bayoumi had befriended and assisted hijackers al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar find housing in San Diego.

Saudi Arabia claims that al-Bayoumi is not its agent. According to previously-classified memoranda released by the National Archives in May 2016, as of 6 June 2003, the FBI &quot;believes it is possible that he was an agent of the Saudi Government and that he may have been reporting on the local [Saudi] community to the Saudi Government officials. In addition, during its investigation, the FBI discovered that al-Bayoumi has ties to terrorist elements as well.&quot;

==Income==
Declassified FBI files describe him as being from an Egyptian family that migrated to Saudi Arabia. Until 1994, he lived in Saudi Arabia, working for the Saudi Ministry of Defense and Aviation, a department headed by Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz.

In August 1994, al-Bayoumi moved to the United States and settled in San Diego, California, where he became involved in the local Muslim community. He was perceived as being very inquisitive, and was known to always carry around a video camera. According to several sources, al-Bayoumi was strongly suspected by many residents to be a Saudi government spy. The man the FBI considered their &quot;best source&quot; in San Diego said that al-Bayoumi &quot;must be an intelligence officer for Saudi Arabia or another foreign power,&quot; according to &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine.

During this time, al-Bayoumi was purportedly a San Diego State University student learning remedial English in the United States as part of a Saudi work-study program. In fact, he only attended the fall, 1994 semester. The Saudi General Authority of Civil Aviation paid al-Bayoumi&#x27;s salary through a government contractor. When the contractor proposed terminating its relationship with al-Bayoumi in 1999, a Saudi government official replied with a letter marked &quot;extremely urgent&quot; that the government wanted al-Bayoumi&#x27;s contract renewed &quot;as quickly as possible.&quot; As a result, Al-Bayoumi&#x27;s employment with the project continued.

When interviewed by the FBI in 2003, al-Bayoumi stated he worked for Saudi aviation company Dallah AVCO. Witnesses at Dallah AVCO describe al-Bayoumi as one of 50 &quot;ghost employees&quot; who were paid by the company despite never showing up for work. One witness described al-Bayoumi accruing such outrageous expenses that at one point AVCO refused to pay him.

Al-Bayoumi came to the FBI’s attention in 1998 when his apartment manager reported him receiving packages from the Middle East containing exposed wiring and hosting large gatherings of Middle Eastern men at his residence.

Some time in late 1999 or early 2000, al-Bayoumi began receiving another monthly payment; this one from Princess Haifa bint Faisal, the wife of Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to the U.S. Cheques for between $2,000 and $3,000 were sent monthly from the princess, through two or three intermediaries, to al-Bayoumi. The payments continued for several years, totalling between $50,000 and $75,000. According to the documents of the 2002 congressional inquiry into the September 11 attacks, al-Bayoumi was not the direct recipient of the checks; Osama Bassnan&#x27;s wife was. Bassnan was a close associate of al-Bayoumi, and commented to an FBI source &quot;that he did more for the hijackers than al-Bayoumi did.&quot; The report further states that, although the money was ostensibly meant for Bassnan, al-Bayoumi&#x27;s wife had attempted to deposit three of the cheques into her own account.

==Al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar==
On 15 January 2000, after attending the 2000 Al Qaeda Summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, future 9/11 hijackers Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar flew from Bangkok, Thailand to Los Angeles, California. Al-Bayoumi reportedly helped these two hijackers to settle in the United States, eventually finding them housing in the neighborhood where he resided. During the period that he did so, his salary greatly increased.

The final 9/11 Commission Report noted:

:&quot;Hazmi and Mihdhar were ill-prepared for a mission in the United States. ... Neither had spent any substantial time in the West, and neither spoke much, if any, English. It would therefore be plausible that they or [Khalid Sheikh Mohammed] would have tried to identify, in advance, a friendly contact for them in the United States. ... We believe it unlikely that Hazmi and Mihdhar ... would have come to the United States without arranging to receive assistance from one or more individuals informed in advance of their arrival.&quot;&quot;

After they landed, Al-Bayoumi met them at a restaurant. He invited them to move to San Diego with him, where he found them an apartment, co-signed the lease, and advanced them $1,500 to help pay for their rent. (The 9/11 Commission, however, concluded that &quot;[n]either then nor later did Bayoumi give money to either Hazmi or Mihdhar.&quot;) Al-Bayoumi also helped them obtain driver&#x27;s licenses, rides to the Social Security office, and information on flight schools. While they lived across the street from al-Bayoumi, they had no furniture, they constantly played flight simulator games, and limousines picked them up for short rides in the middle of the night. Their neighbors later said they perceived them as strange. They later moved into the house of Abdussattar Shaikh, a friend of al-Bayoumi&#x27;s, who was secretly working as an FBI informant at the time.

An October 2012 FBI report (declassified several years after it was written) named Fahad al-Thumairy, a Saudi Islamic Affairs official and King Fahd Mosque imam, as having worked with al-Bayoumi. The report also named a third man, Mussaed Ahmed al-Jarrah, who allegedly had ordered al-Bayoumi and al-Thumairy to assist the hijackers; this man&#x27;s name was not declassified, but was accidentally revealed when the FBI neglected to redact his name from a document filed in April 2020.

Al-Bayoumi claims he met them by happenstance, was being kind to fellow Muslims in need, and had no idea of their plans. Some FBI officials concluded that al-Bayoumi was an unwitting accomplice of the hijackers. As one explained: &quot;We could not find any contact between him and terrorists, any involvement (with al-Qaeda). There was nothing to indicate he&#x27;s any different from any of the hundreds of people who had contact with the hijackers, who were unwitting to the fact that they were going to be hijackers. It just wasn&#x27;t there.&quot; But one former top FBI official told &quot;Newsweek&quot;: &quot;We firmly believed that he had knowledge [of the 9/11 plot] and that his meeting with them that day was more than coincidence.&quot;

According to an FBI report from 2016, declassified by President Biden on September 12, 2021, the FBI says al-Thumairy &quot;tasked&quot; al-Bayoumi with providing assistance to the two hijackers. al-Thumairy also told al-Bayoumi that Al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar were, &quot;two very significant people,&quot; more than a year before the attacks. The report goes on to state that despite al-Bayoumi&#x27;s characterization of the meeting with the two hijackers as coincidental, &quot;Caisin Bin Don&quot;, a US citizen formerly known as Clayton Morgan, reported al-Bayoumi waiting by the window for the hijackers to arrive, and had a lengthy conversation with them in Arabic. Another witness reports al-Bayoumi was often saying the Islamic community needs to &quot;take action&quot; and that the community was &quot;at jihad.&quot;

In June 2024, a federal court unsealed video footage dated between June and July 1999 and recorded over several days by al-Bayoumi in Washington D.C., showing various landmarks, notably the U.S. Capitol. In the video al-Bayoumi, who was allegedly accompanied by two Saudi diplomats, can be heard mentioning some &quot;plan&quot; and promising to someone &quot;I will report you in detail what is there&quot;.

==Arrest and release==
In July 2001, Omar al-Bayoumi moved to England to pursue a PhD at Aston University. Ten days after the September 11 attacks he was arrested by British authorities working with the FBI. He was held on an immigration charge while the FBI and Scotland Yard investigated him. According to an FBI report from 2016, declassified in 2021, they found phone numbers linked to a known Tier 1 Terrorist Support Entity as well as numbers associated with the spiritual advisor to Osama bin Laden and Abu Zubaydah. Most directly, the phone number of Mutaib A Al-Sudairy, roommate of a key bin Laden logistics facilitator, Ziyad Khaleel, was found in his phone. Bayoumi called this number 5 times, each call coinciding with significant logistic support of the hijackers. Specifically, on January 24–30, 2000 in the days before he first met the hijackers, the day immediately after Bayoumi met the hijackers in February 2000, and on February 7, 2000 immediately after Hazmi and Midhar&#x27;s apartment lease and living arrangements had been finalized and funds fronted by Bayoumi. Within two months, Sudairy is recorded at an address in Falls Church, Virginia, the same area where Hazmi, Midhar, Aulaqi, and Hani Hanjour established residence later in the evolution of the 9/11 plot. After his release from custody, he returned to Aston University in Birmingham before returning to Saudi Arabia. his current whereabouts are unknown.

==Followup investigations and new evidence==

On August 18, 2003, interrogators asked Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, whether he knew al-Bayoumi, and KSM said that he did not.

The issue was reopened when the potential links between al-Bayoumi and the Saudi Embassy were reported in the press. Under pressure from Congress, the FBI re-examined the case of &quot;somewhat suspicious meeting with the hijackers,&quot; but concluded that the allegations were &quot;without merit,&quot; and they &quot;abandoned further investigation.&quot; However, contemporary news accounts reported that &quot;countless intelligence leads that might help solve [the case] appear to have been under investigated or completely overlooked by the FBI.&quot;

The final 9/11 Commission reports stated &quot;we have seen no credible evidence that he believed in violent extremism, or knowingly aided extremist groups.&quot; Despite this, the FBI reached a much different conclusion in 2016 during Operation Encore. In a report, declassified on September 12, 2021, FBI agents stated that Fahad al-Thumairy &quot;tasked&quot; al-Bayoumi with assisting the two hijackers upon their arrival in Los Angeles, and said they were, &quot;two very significant people,&quot; more than a year before the attacks. Rather than the chance meeting al-Bayoumi previously described to investigators, in which al-Bayoumi was seen with al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar at a restaurant, a witness told the FBI that al-Bayoumi had been waiting at the window for their arrival, and had a lengthy conversation with them. The report says a woman told investigators that al-Bayoumi was often saying the Islamic community needs to &quot;take action,&quot; and that the community was, &quot;at jihad.&quot; This directly contradicts the findings of the 9/11 Commission Report and its conclusion he did not knowingly aid extremist groups.

Per previously-classified memoranda released by the National Archives in 2016, the FBI believed it is possible that he was an agent of the Saudi Government and that he may have been reporting on the local community to the Saudi Government officials.

In March 2022, the FBI declassified a 510-page report about 9/11 that it produced in 2017. The report found that &quot;there is a 50/50 chance [al-Bayoumi] had advanced knowledge the 9/11 attacks were to occur&quot; from the two Islamists he befriended that were involved in plotting 9/11. al-Bayoumi also helped the Islamists find housing in San Diego. In response, 9/11 Commission chairman and former New Jersey governor Tom Kean said that &quot;If that&#x27;s true I&#x27;d be upset by it&quot;, adding &quot;The FBI said it wasn&#x27;t withholding anything and we believed them.&quot;

Evidence collected in 2001 by British authorities, which came from al-Bayoumi&#x27;s home in Birmingham, England, was made public in August of 2024, in connection with a lawsuit that has been brought against the Saudi kingdom&#x27;s government by some of the surviving families of the 9/11 attacks. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;None of the new evidence from Mr. al-Bayoumi&#x27;s home conclusively proves that the Saudi government enabled the attacks, but it adds to a growing circumstantial case.&quot;

<text>Dick Clark Productions (DCP, stylized in lowercase as dick clark productions or dcp) is an American multinational television production company founded by radio and TV host Dick Clark.

The studio primarily produces award shows and other music entertainment programs, including the Golden Globe Awards (owned outright by DCP since 2023), Academy of Country Music Awards, the DCP-created American Music Awards, the Billboard Music Awards (presented by co-owned music magazine &quot;Billboard&quot;), &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve&quot;, and &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot; (with 19 Entertainment). Some of its earlier productions, such as &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, &quot;New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve&quot;, and &quot;TV&#x27;s Bloopers &amp; Practical Jokes&quot; (initially with Carson Entertainment), were hosted by Clark himself.

The company was sold to a group led by Daniel Snyder in 2007 for $150 million. In September 2012, it was sold again to Guggenheim Partners, Mandalay Entertainment and Mosaic Media Investment Partners for $350 million. Guggenheim&#x27;s stake was later spun out to former president Todd Boehly. In 2016, Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group announced its intent to acquire DCP, but the deal was thrown out in early 2017 due to regulatory issues. The company then became a part of MRC (initially Valence Media) after Boehly&#x27;s entertainment and media assets merged with the studio.

Valence as a whole rebranded as MRC in 2020, with DCP being part of the MRC Live &amp; Alternative division. In September 2021, MRC discontinued the Dick Clark Productions branding, and folded all of its productions under the MRC Live &amp; Alternative branding going forward. In August 2022, the merger was unwound, with Eldridge re-gaining control of the studio and reinstating the Dick Clark Productions name. In January 2023, DCP was subsequently acquired by a joint venture of Penske Media Corporation and Eldridge Industries known as Penske Media Eldridge.

==History==
The Dick Clark radio show began syndication in the late 1950s as part of MARS Broadcasting. The name and lower-case stylization of Dick Clark Productions dates back to, at latest, 1964, when Dick Clark&#x27;s public relations manager, Henry Rogers of Rogers &amp; Cowan, suggested naming his production company after himself, so he could be more visible following &quot;American Bandstand&quot;″s move to Hollywood. Later, Clark rented a building on the Sunset Strip, in an area among visible, legendary clubs and landmarks. As Clark recounted in his 1976 book, &quot;Rock, Roll and Remember&quot;: &quot;I hung up a very modest sign in lowercase print — &quot;dick clark productions&quot; — and started producing.&quot;

In the 1970s, it operated a subsidiary Dick Clark Teleshows, to produce, most notably, the first &quot;American Music Awards&quot;, &quot;Sorority &#x27;62&quot;, and the 90-minute special &quot;200 Years of American Music&quot;. Between the 1970s and 1980s, Dick Clark Productions owned a cinema production company, Dick Clark Cinema Productions, to produce telemovies and feature films. In 1983, Daniel Paulson was appointed vice president of the division.

In 1983, a company owned by Clark and his wife were among multiple applicants to acquire WRKS-FM in New York City. Also, in 1985, Clark operated a home video division, Dick Clark Video, to handle videocassettes, with Vestron Video handling distribution of the titles, most notably &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. In 1987, Dick Clark Productions had signed a five-year deal with the Golden Globe Awards to produce the telecasts from the next five years.

Dick Clark Productions went public on NASDAQ in 1986. It was taken private in 2002 by an investment group that included Mosaic Media Group and the Caisse. Mandalay Entertainment bought DCP&#x27;s stake in 2004.

On June 19, 2007, Dick Clark Productions was sold to Daniel Snyder, then the owner of Washington, D.C.&#x27;s NFL team, and former chairman of Six Flags, for $175 million. After Clark&#x27;s death on April 18, 2012, Snyder commented that he was proud when he purchased Dick Clark Productions, adding that Clark was &quot;in every sense of the word, a giant&quot;. Until 2012, Dick Clark Productions was majority owned by Red Zone Capital Management, a Daniel Snyder-controlled private equity firm, with a 40 percent stake held by Six Flags. The week of June 13, 2012, Red Zone confirmed a possible sale of the company, and that investment bank Raine Group had been tapped to determine possible suitors.

Rumored suitors included CORE Media Group, whose 19 Entertainment produced &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot; with DCP, and Ryan Seacrest Productions, whose namesake founder worked with and was mentored by Dick Clark. On September 4, 2012, Red Zone Capital Management reached an agreement to sell Dick Clark Productions to a group partnership headed by Guggenheim Partners, Mandalay Entertainment, and Mosaic Media Investment Partners for approximately $350 million.

In December 2012, reports by several baseball insiders indicated that the Los Angeles Dodgers (also owned by Guggenheim Partners) were in talks with Dick Clark Productions to potentially form a regional sports network for the team once its contract with Fox Sports West concluded. The Dodgers instead partnered with Time Warner Cable to launch Time Warner Cable SportsNet LA.

On October 2, 2013, Dick Clark Productions teamed up with Keshet International to start out a joint venture to bring Keshet&#x27;s unscripted properties to the North American market, entitled Keshet-DCP.

In 2014, DCP took over production of the Billboard Music Awards, an awards show presented by Guggengeim-owned &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine. In July 2014, DCP settled a lawsuit with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association over its contracts with NBC to broadcast the Golden Globe Awards.

On December 17, 2015, in response to losses across Guggenheim Partners, the company announced that it would spin out its media properties, including Dick Clark Productions, to a group led by its former president Todd Boehly. &quot;Variety&quot; reported that CEO Allen Shapiro was &quot;likely to be a key player in the spinoff, given his experience in running entertainment firms&quot;. Boehly&#x27;s stake is represented by Eldridge Industries.

In September 2016, it was reported that the Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group (which owns AMC Theatres and Legendary Entertainment) was in talks to acquire Dick Clark Productions. This was confirmed on November 4, 2016, when Wanda Group announced the purchase for $1 billion. On February 20, 2017, &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; reported that the sale was facing regulatory issues in China. On March 10, 2017, an Eldridge Industries spokesperson stated that the sale had been scrapped. DCP received $50 million from Wanda Group in breakup and extension fees. The studio later sold Chinese rights to the Golden Globes and &quot;New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve&quot; to STX Entertainment.

On February 1, 2018, DCP merged with Billboard-Hollywood Reporter Media Group and Media Rights Capital to form Valence Media. Mike Mahan was appointed CEO of DCP. In November 2019, the company&#x27;s COO and CFO Amy Thurlow became president of Dick Clark Productions, with Mike Mahan expected to become a vice chairman in 2020. In July 2020, Valence was rebranded as MRC, with Dick Clark Productions operating as a label of its non-scripted division MRC Live &amp; Alternative.

Thurlow stepped down from DCP in June 2021. In September 2021, the Dick Clark Productions name was discontinued, with all of its productions now falling under the MRC Live &amp; Alternative banner.

In August 2022, Eldridge and MRC&#x27;s co-CEOs Modi Wiczyk and Asif Satchu agreed to divide the company&#x27;s assets, effectively undoing the 2018 deal that created Valence Media. Among other assets, Eldridge re-acquired the MRC Live &amp; Alternative division and announced it would restore the Dick Clark Productions name to the unit. In January 2023, DCP was subsequently acquired by a joint venture of Penske Media Corporation and Eldridge Industries known as Penske Media Eldridge: Adam Stotsky stepped down as president of the company following the transaction, and at least 16 employees were laid off. The deal expands on an existing relationship between the companies, under which PMC operates &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;.

On June 12, 2023, DCP acquired the assets and intellectual property of the Golden Globe Awards from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, as part of a transition to a for-profit entity undertaken by Boehly.

<doc id="850429" wikidata="Q5645147" url="?curid=850429" title="1999 Hamilton South by-election">
<text>On 4 August 1999, NATO announced that the Member of Parliament for the constituency of [[Hamilton South (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton South]], in Scotland, George Robertson, had been chosen as their new Secretary-General. This meant that Robertson was required to resign from his seat which he had won at the 1997 general election. The seat had fallen vacant in a Parliamentary recess, and the law does not permit a by-election to be called during a recess if the sitting member resigns by taking the Chiltern Hundreds.

Robertson was elevated to the House of Lords as Baron Robertson of Port Ellen on 24 August 1999, instantly vacating his seat. The writ for the by-election was moved immediately. The Labour Party selected Bill Tynan, a locally based trade union official, to defend the seat. The Scottish National Party, which was likely to provide the main challenge, chose Annabelle Ewing. Ewing was the daughter of Winnie Ewing; who had famously defeated Labour to win the Hamilton by-election of 1967. The Scottish Socialist Party fought a strong campaign for the seat, and Stephen Mungall was nominated by a local group protesting against the ownership of the local football team, Hamilton Academical F.C.

Twelve candidates stood, which was at the time, the most at any Scottish by-election. This figure was surpassed, when thirteen candidates stood at the 2009 by-election in Glasgow North East.

Polling day for the by-election was on 23 September. The Labour Party narrowly held on to the seat, after a recount; the Liberal Democrats polled poorly, their sixth place was the worst placing at a by-election by any major party since the Conservative candidate in the 1990 Upper Bann by-election also came sixth; in by-elections in seats in Great Britain; it was the lowest since the Liberal candidate in the 1948 Glasgow Camlachie by-election also came sixth. The Scottish Socialist Party outperformed the Conservatives.

==Result==






Mungall used the description &quot;Hamilton Accies Home, Watson Away&quot;, referring to demands by some fans that Hamilton Academical should play their home matches locally and that Watson, a prominent shareholder, should go.

<doc id="850430" wikidata="Q335022" url="?curid=850430" title="David Teniers the Younger">
<text>David Teniers the Younger or David Teniers II (bapt. 15 December 1610 – 25 April 1690) was a Flemish Baroque painter, printmaker, draughtsman, miniaturist painter, staffage painter, copyist and art curator. He was an extremely versatile artist known for his prolific output. He was an innovator in a wide range of genres such as history painting, genre painting, landscape painting, portrait and still life. He is now best remembered as the leading Flemish genre painter of his day. Teniers is particularly known for developing the peasant genre, the tavern scene, pictures of collections and scenes with alchemists and physicians.

He was court painter and the curator of the collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm, the art-loving Governor General of the Habsburg Netherlands. He created a printed catalogue of the collections of the Archduke. He was the founder of the Antwerp Academy, where young artists were trained to draw and sculpt in the hope of reviving Flemish art after its decline following the death of the leading Flemish artists Rubens and Anthony van Dyck in the early 1640s. He influenced the next generation of Northern genre painters as well as French Rococo painters such as Antoine Watteau.

==Life==
===Initial career in Antwerp===

David Teniers the Younger was born in Antwerp as the son of David Teniers the Elder and Dymphna de Wilde. His father was a painter of altarpieces and small-scale cabinet paintings. David was baptised at St. James&#x27; Church on 15 December 1610. Three of his brothers also became painters: Juliaan III (1616–1679), Theodoor (1619–1697) and Abraham (1629–1670). The work of his two oldest brothers is virtually unknown. The work of his youngest brother Abraham was very close to David&#x27;s own.
From 1626, David the younger studied under his father. A collaborator of his father early on in his career, the father and son pair created together a series of twelve panels recounting stories from Torquato Tasso&#x27;s epic &quot;Gerusalemme Liberata&quot; (Museo del Prado, Madrid). His father was frequently in financial straits and his debts landed him occasionally in jail. David the younger had to make copies of old masters in order to support the family. In 1632–33, he was registered as &#x27;wijnmeester&#x27; (i.e. the son of a master) in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke.

A David Teniers is recorded in the Antwerp records as having been issued in 1635 a passport to visit Paris. The artist likely also travelled to England as on 29 December 1635 of the same year he signed in Dover a contract with the Antwerp art dealer Chrisostomos van Immerseel, then resident in England. 
Rubens received in 1636 a commission from the Spanish king Philip IV of Spain to create a series of mythological paintings to decorate the Torre de la Parada, a hunting lodge of the king near Madrid. The mythological scenes depicted in the series were largely based on the Metamorphoses of Ovid. Rubens realized this important commission with the assistance of a large number of Antwerp painters such as Jacob Jordaens, Cornelis de Vos, Jan Cossiers, Peter Snayers, Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert, Theodoor van Thulden, Jan Boeckhorst, Peeter Symons, Jacob Peter Gowy and others, who worked after Rubens&#x27; modellos. Teniers was also invited to participate in this project and make a picture after Rubens&#x27; design. That painting is considered lost.

Teniers married into the famous Brueghel artist family when Anna Brueghel, daughter of Jan Brueghel the Elder, became his wife on 22 July 1637. Rubens, who had been the guardian of Anna Brueghel after her father&#x27;s death, was a witness at the wedding. Through his marriage Teniers was able to cement a close relationship with Rubens who had been a good friend and frequent collaborator with his wife&#x27;s father. This is borne out by the fact that at the baptism of the first of the couple&#x27;s seven children David Teniers III, Rubens&#x27; second wife, Hélène Fourment, was the godmother. Around this time Teniers started to gain a reputation as an artist and he received many commissions. The Guild of St George (Oude Voetboog Guild), a local militia in Antwerp, commissioned a group portrait in 1643 (Hermitage Museum).
Teniers was a dean of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1644–1645. When Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria became the Governor General of the Southern Netherlands in 1647, the Archduke soon became an important patron of Teniers. The success went to the artist&#x27;s head. He claimed that his grandfather Julian Taisnier, who had moved from Ath (now located in the Walloon province of Hainaut) to Antwerp in the 16th century had been from a family that had been entitled to bear a coat of arms. Teniers started to use this coat of arms consisting of a croaching bear on a field of gold encircled by three green acorns. His brother-in-law Jan Baptist Borrekens reported him and Teniers was prohibited from using the coat of arms.

===Court painter in Brussels===
Around 1650, Teniers moved to Brussels to formally enter into the service of the Archduke as a &quot;pintor de cámara&quot; (court painter). The Archduke asked him to be the keeper of the art gallery he had set up in his palace in Brussels. In that position he succeeded the Antwerp painter Jan van den Hoecke who had earlier worked in Vienna for the Archduke. One of Teniers&#x27;s key tasks in this position was to look after and enlarge the Archducal collection. Teniers put together a collection for the art gallery which included his own work and that of other artists, which he selected. He was involved in the purchase of a large number of Italian, and especially Venetian, masterpieces from the confiscated collections of Charles I of England and his Jacobite supporters. One of his most important successes was the acquisition of the major part (about 400 paintings) of the collection owned by James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton, who had been a close associate and favorite of the English King and was, like the King, executed in 1649. The Conde de Fuensaldaña, then acting as Leopold Wilhelm&#x27;s lieutenant in the Southern Netherlands, also sent Teniers to England in 1651 to purchase paintings at the Pembroke and presumably other sales. The collection of the Archduke grew to incorporate about 1,300 works, mainly of leading Italian artists such as Raphael, Giorgione, Veronese and Titian (15 works by this artist alone) as well as of famous Northern artists such as Hans Holbein the Younger, Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Jan van Eyck. The collection became the foundation and nucleus of the collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.
The Archduke also promoted Teniers&#x27;s art by giving his compositions to other European rulers as presents. As a result, many of these rulers also became patrons of the artist. The bishop of Ghent Anthonius Triest, the Stadtholder Prince Frederik Hendrik of Orange, Christina, Queen of Sweden, William II, Prince of Orange and Philip IV of Spain were among his patrons. Only king Louis XIV of France does not seem to have liked Teniers&#x27;s work. According to a story, when presented with a peasant scene by Teniers the French king asked for the &#x27;magots&#x27; (baboons) to be removed from his sight as soon as possible.

Teniers bought a house close to the Brussels court and was promoted in 1655 to &#x27;camerdiender&#x27; or &#x27;ayuda de cámara&#x27; (chamberlain) by the Archduke. It was most unusual for a painter to serve as chamberlain at the Spanish court. In fact, there was only one other case, which dates from the same time: that of Velázquez, whose aim was also to be elevated to the nobility. Not long after the Archduke resigned from his position as Governor General of the Spanish Netherlands and returned to Vienna with his large art collection. A Flemish priest, who was also a gifted still life painter, Jan Anton van der Baren, moved with Leopold Wilhelm from Brussels to Vienna where he was the successor of Teniers as the director of the archducal gallery in Vienna. The new Governor General of the Spanish Netherlands, Don Juan of Austria continued the support for the artist that he had enjoyed from his predecessor the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm. The early Flemish biographer Cornelis de Bie reports in his &quot;Het Gulden Cabinet&quot; published in 1662 that Don Juan was an amateur artist who regularly asked Teniers to give him instructions in art. Don Juan was so taken by Teniers that he even drew a portrait of Teniers son.
Teniers&#x27;s wife died on 11 May 1656. On 21 October of the same year, the artist remarried. His second wife was Isabella de Fren, the 32-year-old daughter of Andries de Fren, secretary of the Council of Brabant. It has been suggested that Teniers&#x27;s main motive for marrying the &#x27;spinster&#x27; was her rather elevated position in society. His second wife also brought him a large dowry. The couple had four children, two sons and two daughters. His second wife&#x27;s attitude to Teniers&#x27;s children from his first marriage would later divide the family in legal battles. Teniers petitioned the king of Spain to be admitted to the aristocracy but gave up when the condition imposed was that he should give up painting for money.

In 1660, Teniers&#x27;s &quot;Theatrum Pictorium&quot; was published in Brussels. When Don Juan of Austria ended his term as Governor General of the Southern Netherlands in January 1659, Teniers appears to have withdrawn from active court duty. He purchased from the husband of Hélène Fourment, the widow of Rubens, a country estate called the &#x27;Drij Toren&#x27; (&#x27;Three towers&#x27;) located in Perk, in the environs of Brussels and Vilvoorde. Teniers did not cut his links with Antwerp while living and working in Brussels. Teniers maintained close contacts with artists as well as the influential art dealers in Antwerp. In particular; the firm of Matthijs Musson was instrumental in building Teniers&#x27;s international reputation.
At the behest of his Antwerp colleagues of the Guild of Saint Luke, Teniers became the driving force behind the foundation of the academy in Antwerp, only the second of such type of institution in Europe after the one in Paris. The artist used his connections and sent his son David to Madrid to assist in the negotiation to successfully obtain the required licence from the Spanish King. This involved Teniers&#x27;s son presenting a very expensive golden watch to one of the courtiers who could influence the Spanish King&#x27;s decision on the matter. As soon as he received the royal charter creating the Antwerp Royal Academy of Fine Arts, Teniers travelled with it from Brussels to Antwerp and celebrated the accomplishment with a big banquet in the Schilderskamer of the Guild of St. Luke. When in 1674 the existence of the academy was threatened, he again used his influence at the Spanish court to save the institution.

As a court painter, Teniers was not required to become member of a local guild. Nevertheless, he became a member of the Brussels Guild of Saint Luke in 1675. In his later years, Teniers was also active as an art dealer and he organised art auctions. This brought him into conflict with his fellow artists who started proceedings to prohibit him from holding an auction in 1683. Teniers argued that he needed the proceeds of the auction because his children were suing him for their mother&#x27;s part of her estate. The matter was finally settled between the parties themselves. In his final years, he lost his second wife and was involved in further lawsuits over her estate with the two surviving children of his second wife. There is evidence that in these years he suffered a decline in his prosperity and that his output was diminished.

On 25 April 1690, David Teniers died in Brussels.

His pupils included his son David, Ferdinand Apshoven the Younger, Thomas van Apshoven, Jan de Froey, Aert Maes, Abraham Teniers, and Aert van Waes. Gillis van Tilborgh is also presumed to have studied under Teniers.

==Work==
===Subjects===
Teniers was known as a hard worker who was extremely prolific. About two thousand paintings are thought to have been painted by the artist. He was extremely versatile and tried his hand at all the genres then practised in Flanders including history, genre, landscape, portrait and still life.

Teniers is particularly known for developing the peasant genre, the tavern scene and scenes with alchemists and physicians. He also painted many religious scenes among which stand out his many compositions treating the subjects of the &quot;Temptation of St Anthony&quot; and hermit saints in grottoes or deserts.

===Evolution===
Teniers&#x27;s early works show the influence of Elsheimer. This influence was transmitted to him through his father, who had studied under Elsheimer in Rome and is regarded as a follower of Elsheimer. Elsheimer was mainly known for his small cabinet paintings characterised by their innovative treatment of landscape and light effects.

Another major influence on David Teniers the Younger&#x27;s early work was the work of the Flemish painter Adriaen Brouwer. Adriaen Brouwer was working in Antwerp from the mid-1620s to the mid-1630s after an extended residence in Haarlem. He was an important innovator of genre painting through his vivid depictions of peasants, soldiers and other &#x27;lower class&#x27; individuals, whom he showed engaged in drinking, smoking, card or dice playing, fighting, music making etc. usually in taverns or rustic settings. Brouwer also contributed to the development of the genre of tronies, i.e. head or facial studies, which investigate varieties of expression. Teniers&#x27;s early work up to the end of the thirties was very close to that of Brouwer in terms of subject matter, technique, color and composition. He took from Brouwer the gross types, placed in the characteristic smoky, dimly lit taverns. He also treated these subjects with the same monochrome tonality as Brouwer.
The personal style of Teniers was visible from the outset. An important distinction was that unlike Brouwer who placed these genre scenes mainly indoors, Teniers gradually moved his scenes into the open air and started to give the landscape a major place in his work from the 1640s. This was a common development in Flemish painting at the time. The smoky and monochrome tonality of the interiors from the 1630s was replaced by a luminous, silvery atmosphere, in which the peasants sit at their ease, conversing or playing cards. These paintings show a radical move towards a more positive attitude towards country life and the peasantry than was reflected in his earlier satirical pieces influenced by Brouwer.

Teniers&#x27;s later works such as his &quot;Flemish kermesse&quot; (1652, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels) breathe an idyllic Arcadian spirit. The peasant characters have lost their ungainly appearance and people from the higher social classes are now mixed in with the common people. The artist&#x27;s new status as court painter of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm from 1651 may have contributed to this &#x27;gentrification&#x27; of his work. This type of rural scene became very popular. In many of Teniers&#x27;s late paintings, the excitement of his earlier peasant feasts is gradually replaced by tranquil scenes populated with only a few human figures. In this later period Teniers also adopted a more painterly and looser style.
Teniers&#x27;s scenes with peasants were so well known that compositions with this subject came to be called &#x27;tenierkens&#x27; (&#x27;small teniers&#x27;) and tapestries with peasant scenes were referred to as &#x27;Teniers tapestries&#x27;. Teniers did not design any Teniers tapestries himself. Only a few of these tapestries can be directly linked to works by Teniers. Teniers tapestries were particularly popular from the last third of the 17th century and well into the 18th century. The Teniers tapestries were woven by many Brussels weavers and also in other centers such as Lille, Oudenaarde, Beauvais and Madrid.

===Country and pastoral landscapes===
In the early 1640s Teniers began to paint more landscape paintings and in these he developed his own pictorial language. He started to focus on the Flemish countryside as a subject in itself rather than solely as a backdrop to his outdoor peasant scenes. In his landscapes he paid particular attention to the variegated light of the Flemish countryside in different weather conditions. In his &quot;River landscape with rainbow&quot; he included thin, dark clouds, with streaking sun rays piercing through rain and a rainbow in the left background. Along with Rubens, Teniers was among the first Flemish 17th-century artists to include rainbows in his compositions, not for their religious or allegorical meaning, but rather as another means by which to showcase his careful study of nature. Other examples of this include other works from the mid-1640s such as &quot;The Reaping&quot; (Hermitage Museum). Teniers depicted real as well as imaginary landscapes. Although he did not intend these works to be topographically accurate, he spent a lot of time sketching in the countryside. This explains why certain motifs recur in his landscape oeuvre.
In the 1660s Teniers started to paint pastoral scenes. It is likely that the increased prominence of rural life and nature in his work of that period was connected to his 1662 purchase of Drij Toren, a country house in Perk in which he maintained a studio. In contrast to the sophisticated compositions he painted as a court painter, the landscapes he painted at Perk stand out by their simplicity. They expressed an Arcadian view of life in the countryside and eulogized the advantages of a peaceful existence on the land. He presented the rural life as happy and carefree. The landscapes themselves were a combination of fantasy and reality. The Arcadian spirit was conveyed through stock motifs such as cattle and sheep, bridges and classical ruins on a hill as well as through the general tonality and style of these works.

Teniers&#x27;s interest in pastoral paintings has been linked to his ambition to be elevated to the nobility. Agriculture and animal husbandry were regarded as proper occupations of the nobility. An estate in the countryside was therefore a necessary part of the status of nobles of that time. Teniers had himself acquired the country estate Drij Toren in Perk near Rubens&#x27; country estate &quot;Het Steen&quot;. Teniers painted his own country estate several times. In the &quot;View of Drij Toren at Perk, with David Teniers&#x27; family&quot; (c. 1660, Boughton House) Teniers placed his estate in the center of the composition and included a portrait of his family, servants and tenant farmers at the harvest. He paid homage to Rubens by including Rubens&#x27; nearby estate called &quot;Het Steen&quot; in the far distance. He depicted himself in the picture as a country &quot;gentleman&quot;, who through his graceful bearing and costly clothing sets himself apart from the servants and toiling peasants in the picture. Teniers also made many paintings of other chateaux and estates. Only a few of the chateaux and estates he represented in these paintings are of known estates. It is believed that they are imaginary creations intended to present a generic view of what a country estate should look like: large, stately and dominating the countryside around it. These paintings often include depictions of the tenant farmers who pay deference to their masters. They thus give expression to the prevalent worldview of the ruling class of his day, of which Teniers aspired to be a part, which was that the good and humble peasant would always show reverence to his noble lord.

===Gallery paintings===
Teniers painted 10 paintings representing the collection of the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in Brussels. Of these only three are dated. Nine are painted on canvas and one on copper. The paintings are believed to depict a fictitious space rather than the actual location of the Archduke&#x27;s collection in his Brussels palace. The paintings shown in them, however, are known to have formed part of the Archducal collection.
Teniers&#x27;s paintings of the Archduke&#x27;s collection fall into a genre referred to as &#x27;gallery paintings&#x27; or &#x27;pictures of collections&#x27;. Gallery paintings typically depict large rooms in which many paintings and other precious items are displayed in elegant surroundings. Antwerp artists Jan Brueghel the Elder and Frans Francken the Younger were the first to create paintings of art and curiosity collections in the 1620s. The genre was further developed by Hieronymus Francken the Younger, Willem van Haecht and Hendrik Staben. The genre became immediately popular in Antwerp where many artists practised it in Teniers&#x27;s time: they included artists such as Jan Brueghel the Younger, Cornelis de Baellieur, Hans Jordaens, Gonzales Coques, Jan van Kessel the Elder and Hieronymus Janssens. Later practitioners included Teniers&#x27;s presumed pupil Gillis van Tilborgh as well as Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg, Jacob de Formentrou and Balthasar van den Bossche.

Teniers played an important role in the development of the genre of gallery paintings and his mid-17th-century gallery paintings of the collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm are among the most famous examples of the genre. The earliest works in this genre depicted art objects together with other items such as scientific instruments or peculiar natural specimens. These paintings expressed the Early Modern culture of curiosity, in which art works and scientific instruments were mixed together in so-called &quot;cabinets of curiosities&quot;. The persons populating the galleries in these early works are &#x27;virtuosi&#x27; who appear as keen to discuss scientific instruments as to admire an artwork. Teniers transformed the genre in the mid 17th century by moving away from the depiction of &quot;cabinets of curiosities&quot; to depicting art galleries, and in particular the collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm. In the final, &#x27;late&#x27; phase of the genre from c. 1660 to 1690, artists such as Teniers&#x27;s pupil Gillis van Tilborgh went further in removing non-art objects from the gallery and introduced figures in the gallery setting who claimed elite status by virtue of their knowledge of (and, as in some cases artists are present, ability to produce) art.

Teniers first depicted Archduke Leopold Wilhelm with his collection in two pictures dated 1651 (one in Petworth House and the other in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium). The only other dated gallery painting by Teniers is dated 1653. The fact that the other gallery paintings of Teniers are not dated has made it difficult to establish a chronology and evolution of his work in this genre. Two of the ten known gallery paintings with Archduke Leopold Wilhelm have similar compositions and include the same paintings: the large, undated canvas in the Kunsthistorisches Museum likely followed the equally large painting dated 1651 in Petworth House. The others are all independently composed and display different works or when the same works are included they are hung in a different order. Although Teniers&#x27;s gallery paintings depict pictures known to have been part of the Archduke&#x27;s collection, the precise arrangements in which he depicted those pictures is believed to be fictional. Teniers strove in these paintings to arrive at a visual survey of the collection. Some of the paintings show the Archduke visiting the collection accompanied by courtiers and other art collectors. Teniers included in some a portrait of himself apparently in the act of providing his patron some explanation on a particular work of art in the collection. In the &quot;Archduke Leopold Willem in his gallery at Brussels&quot; (c. 1650, Kunsthistorisches Museum) Teniers included a portrait of Jan Anton van der Baren (the third man from the right) who later followed the Archduke upon his return to Vienna where he took over Teniers&#x27;s role as director and cataloger of the Archduke&#x27;s collection.
It is likely that these gallery paintings of the Archduke&#x27;s collection were painted to memorialize and eulogize it and anyone associated with it. The gallery painting with Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in Peftord House was made on copper. This was unusual for a picture of such a large size and was presumably done so that the Archduke could send it as a present to Philip IV of Spain. By sending this work to Philip IV, the Archduke may have intended to pay homage to his uncle as a prominent connoisseur of Italian painting known for his large collection at the Royal Alcazar of Madrid. His secondary intention may have been to demonstrate to the King that his collection in Brussels could emulate the King&#x27;s collection in Madrid. As in the 17th century the power of a prince was no longer judged solely based on his military success, but even more so on his taste in, and appreciation of, art, the Archduke thus wanted to show that he could hold his own against the King.

Teniers also painted a few gallery paintings showing artists at work or cognoscenti inspecting a collection. An example is &quot;A picture gallery with two men examining a seal and a red chalk drawing, and a monkey present&quot; (At Sotheby&#x27;s New York, 24 January 2002, lot 169). These gallery paintings are heavy with symbolism and allegory and are a reflection of the intellectual preoccupations of the age, including the cultivation of personal virtue and the importance of connoisseurship. They accentuate the notion that the powers of discernment associated with connoisseurship are socially superior to or more desirable than other forms of knowing. Teniers also created an allegorical or satirical interpretation of a gallery painting in the drawing &quot;Monkeys&#x27; Masquerade: The Painter’s Studio, an Artist Seated&quot; (British Museum). The drawing is clearly a pun on the popular &#x27;art as the ape of nature&#x27; present in many pictures of collections through the inclusion of a monkey among the art lovers.

===&quot;Theatrum pictorium&quot;===

During his tenure as keeper of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm&#x27;s collection, Teniers undertook the preparation and publication of the first ever illustrated catalog of old master paintings. His brother Abraham Teniers was involved in organizing the publication of the work. The first official publication of the work in bound book format was published by Hendrick Aertssens in Brussels in 1660 (although the title page states the date as 1658). The title page of the book refers to it as &#x27;Hoc Amphiteatrum Picturarum&#x27; (&#x27;This amphitheatre of pictures&#x27;). The publication is now often referred to as &quot;Theatrum pictorium&quot; (&#x27;Theatre of Paintings&#x27;). The cover of the &quot;Theatrum pictorium&quot; contained a bust portrait of the Archduke with a dedication to the Archduke as well as introductions in Latin, French, Spanish and Dutch. The title page clarifies that Teniers funded the publication project out of his own pocket. The Theatrum pictorium was published in four languages (Latin, French, Dutch, and Spanish) and further editions appeared in 1673 and 1688 and in the 18th century. The last edition was published in 1755.

The publication comprised 246 engravings of important Italian paintings in the art collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm. While the project was initially planned to include the entire collection of the Archduke, the Archduke returned to Vienna before the project was completed. As a result, ultimately only a series of 246 plates was produced, of which 243 depicted about half of the Italian paintings then owned by the Archduke).

In the preparation of this project, Teniers first painted reduced &quot;modelli&quot; after the original works on panels of roughly 17 by 25 in dimensions. These were then engraved on the same scale by a pool of 12 engravers. Teniers used full colour in the modelli, rather than grisaille. This could mean that he intended these reproductions to function as independent records of some of these Italian paintings in the Archduke&#x27;s collection. From the many modelli, which have been preserved, it is obvious that Teniers&#x27;s copies constitute a true record of the originals even while he left out details and painted them in his typical fluid and transparent manner. The engraving of the catalog by engravers who worked after the modelli, not the originals, was started by 1656. In the 17th century there existed no efficient method for inverting images. As a result, most of the prints in the catalog are reverse images of the originals. Each print gives the name of the author of the original work on the left hand side (indicated by the letter &#x27;p&#x27; for &#x27;pinxit&#x27;, Latin for &#x27;painted by&#x27;) and the engraver of the print on the right hand side (indicated by the letter &#x27;s&#x27; for &#x27;sculpsit&#x27;, Latin for &#x27;engraved by&#x27;). Some editions also indicated the original dimensions of the paintings.

Teniers&#x27;s modelli and the &quot;Theatrum pictorium&quot; serve as a record for some important paintings the whereabouts of which are currently unknown. For instance, the modelli in the Metropolitan Museum of Art of the &quot;Old Age in Search of Youth&quot; attributed by Teniers to Correggio and the &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; after Padovanino are the most important records of these lost paintings.

The &quot;Theatrum Pictorium&quot; had an important impact on the manner in which collections were organised, appreciated and published and continued to be used as a reference book during the 18th century.

===Singeries===
Teniers contributed to the spread of the genre of the &#x27;monkey scene&#x27;, also called &#x27;singerie&#x27; (which in French means a &#x27;comical grimace, behaviour or trick&#x27; and is derived from &#x27;singe&#x27;, the French word for monkey). Comical scenes with monkeys appearing in human attire and a human environment are a pictorial genre that was initiated in Flemish painting in the 16th century and was subsequently further developed in the 17th century. Monkeys were regarded as shameless and impish creatures and excellent imitators of human behaviour. These depictions of monkeys enacting various human roles were a playful metaphor for all the folly in the world. In 16th century visual and literary sources, the image of the monkey was typically used to symbolise the unreasonable and foolish aspect of human nature. It is this quality that Teniers refers to in his &quot;Allegory of Vanitas&quot; (1633, private collection) in which he included a chained monkey in fool&#x27;s clothes who is looking through a telescope from the wrong end. In addition, monkeys were associated with the Antichrist and the Devil and regarded as the opposite of god. In Dürer&#x27;s print &quot;Madonna with a monkey&quot; the Virgin, who represents holiness, is contrasted with the monkey chained at her feet who symbolizes evil.
The Flemish engraver Pieter van der Borcht introduced the singerie as an independent theme around 1575 in a series of prints, which were strongly embedded in the artistic tradition of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. These prints were widely disseminated and the theme was then picked up by other Flemish artists. The first one to do so was the Antwerp artist Frans Francken the Younger, who was quickly followed by Jan Brueghel the Elder, the Younger and Sebastiaen Vrancx. David Teniers the Younger, following in the footsteps of his father-in-law Jan Brueghel the Elder, became the principal practitioner of the genre and developed it further with his younger brother Abraham Teniers. The two brothers were able to cater to the prevailing taste in the art market and were thus instrumental in spreading the genre outside Flanders. Later in the 17th century Nicolaes van Verendael started to paint these &#x27;monkey scenes&#x27; as well.

Teniers painted singeries in two distinctive periods. During the first period in the early 1630s he was still working in Antwerp. He returned to the subject in the 1660s when he was working in Brussels as the court painter of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm. In the early period Teniers&#x27;s singeries typically depicted monkeys as soldiers. From this period dates his &quot;Festival of monkeys&quot; (1633, private collection). Monkey soldiers are shown enjoying themselves in front of a tent set up on what is likely a town square with a landscape in the distance. Food and wine are in abundant supply. On the tent is pinned an image of an owl with spectacles. The owl recalls the Flemish proverb &#x27;wat baten kaars en bril als de uil niet zien en lezen wil&#x27; (&#x27;what good are candle and spectacles if the owl does not want to see and read&#x27;). The &quot;Festival of monkeys&quot; can be regarded as a criticism of the role of &#x27;fools in high places&#x27;. Teniers evidently identified close with the singerie genre in this early period of his career as two monkey scenes – the &quot;Guardroom with monkeys&quot; and the &quot;Festival of monkeys&quot; – are reproduced in his self-portrait of 1635, known as &quot;The Artist in his studio&quot; (private collection, a workshop copy was sold at Sotheby&#x27;s New York sale of 27 May 2004 as lot 16). The artist is shown sitting in front of an easel holding his brush and palette. In an exceptions combination of the genre of artist studio and gallery painting, some young connoisseurs are visiting the artist&#x27;s studio and are examining some of his works.

===Guardroom scenes===
Teniers painted several guardroom scenes or &quot;corps de garde&quot; such as &quot;The Sentinel&quot; (1642). A guardroom scene is a type of genre scene that became popular in the mid-17th century, particularly in the Dutch Republic. In Flanders Teniers was one of the principal practitioners of the genre together with his brother Abraham, Anton Goubau, Cornelis Mahu and Jan Baptist Tijssens the Younger.

A guardroom scene typically depicts an interior scene with officers and soldiers engaged in merrymaking. Guardroom scenes often included mercenaries and prostitutes dividing booty, harassing captives or indulging in other forms of reprehensible activities. Many of Tenier&#x27;s guardroom interiors date to the mid-1640s and are painted on copper. The subject of the guardroom and its contents such as armor, colorful flags and banners, saddles, drums, pistols allowed Teniers to showcase his brilliance as a still life painter. Teniers also used the subject to demonstrate his ability to use light to achieve a perfect representation of the quality of painted objects.
The armour depicted in the guardroom pictures was already out of date at the time it was painted since metal armours, breast plates and helmets fell out of use from the 1620s. It is possible that in line with the moralizing intent of the genre, the armour is a reference to the vanitas motif of the transience of power and fame.

In one of his guardroom interiors referred to as &quot;A guardroom with a self-portrait of the artist&quot; (At Sotheby&#x27;s London sale of 7 July 2010, lot 12) Teniers included his own portrait at about 36 years of age. The artist has dossed himself out as an officer wearing an exotic fur-trimmed coat and a fur hat with plume. This self-portrait within this picture may have been intended as a tronie, which often depicted a stock character in an exotic costume. Teniers combined the genres of singerie and guardroom scene in the composition &quot;Guardroom with monkeys&quot; (Private collection). At a first glance, the Guardroom with Monkeys is no different from other guardroom scenes. It is clear from the round moon above the door that the scene is set late at night. The off-duty monkeys have removed their armor, stowed their pikes and rolled up their company flag and placed it against the far wall. Like their human counterparts, the monkey soldiers are loitering about, some of them are drinking and smoking, others are playing games. At the door a cat wearing respectable civilian clothes is led into the room by two monkeys who restrain it. The contrast between the properly dressed cat and the bizarre outfit of the monkey soldiers, one of which is wearing a funnel on his head while another has an upturned pot on his head, raises doubt as to the legitimacy of the monkeys&#x27; authority. As was customary in singeries, the dress and behaviour of the monkeys highlight the foolishness of human undertakings. Teniers may also have intended to criticize the bloated military in the Southern Netherlands in the 1630s.

===Physicians and alchemists===

The theme of physicians and alchemists was popular in 17th century Flemish and Dutch genre painting. Teniers was the principal contributor to this genre and its iconography in Flanders. The view of the public towards practitioners of either craft was ambivalent. Physicians and alchemists were regarded either as quacks or charlatans using deception to seek material gain or as persons seriously committed to the pursuit of knowledge. The ambivalence of this attitude was reflected in the artistic representations of physicians and alchemists. The first approach was to satirise the alchemist and turn him into a symbol of human folly. The artists would stress that the alchemist&#x27;s research into creating gold from base metals was solely driven by a sinful pursuit of personal gain. Symbolism was used to show that alchemists were wasting precious time and money, and in the process sacrificed the well-being of their families. In his famous drawing of an alchemist dated to 1558 (Kupferstichkabinett Berlin) Pieter Brueghel the Elder depicted the alchemist as recklessly extravagant and wasteful in the use of resources. This drawing set the standard for the imagery of alchemists that was adopted by 17th century artists such as Jan Steen, David Rijckaert III and Adriaen van Ostade. In the 1640s Teniers created the second imagery of the alchemist. Teniers portrayed the alchemist as a learned and humble scientist diligently pursuing his research in his laboratory crowded with instruments. In the laboratory one or two assistants typically assist the alchemist with the performance of an experiment. Teniers&#x27;s &quot;Alchemist&quot; (between circa 1640 and circa 1650, Mauritshuis) is an example of one of his alchemist laboratory scenes, which is devoid of the symbols of self-deception and consequent misery that Breughel had associated with alchemy, such as empty purses or tearful families. Teniers&#x27;s new way of depicting alchemists was followed by contemporary artists such as Thomas Wijck, Frans van Mieris the Elder, Jacob Toorenvliet and Cornelis Bega. 
While alchemists were mainly concerned with transmutation of base metals into more noble ones, their endeavors were wider and also involved the use of their techniques to diagnose or cure people (the so-called &#x27;iatrochemistry&#x27;, which aimed to provide chemical solutions to diseases and medical ailments). There was therefore an overlap with the role of physicians. One of the popular methods of medical diagnosis was the so-called &#x27;uroscopy&#x27;, the analysis of the urine of a patient. Whereas this was considered a valid diagnostic method in the Middle Ages its validity had come under attack by more modern-minded physicians in the 17th century. The practice of uroscopy and the questions surrounding its use by medical practitioners were the impetus for genre paintings on the theme of the &#x27;piskijker&#x27; (&#x27;pee examiner&#x27;). They typically showed the inspection by a physician or a quack of a flask of urine provided by a young woman. If the inspection revealed the image of a fetus this was proof that the woman was pregnant. It is assumed that the genre was started by Adriaen Brouwer and that a now lost work of Brouwer inspired Teniers and Gerard ter Borch to paint works in this genre.
An example of Teniers&#x27;s contribution to the genre is the composition &quot;Village doctor looking at a urine sample&quot; (1640s, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium), which shows a man examining a urine flask for the purpose of medical diagnosis while an anxious peasant woman is looking on. Teniers also depicted physicians performing various operations such as foot and back operations.

===Still lifes===

Teniers is not generally known as a still life painter. Nevertheless, many of his interiors include elaborate still lifes, some of them painted by specialist still life painters, others painted by Teniers himself. The subject of the guardroom and all its trappings such as armor, colorful flags and banners, saddles, drums and pistols gave Teniers ample opportunity to showcase his capabilities as a still life painter. This can be seen in the &quot;Guardroom with the Deliverance of Saint Peter&quot; (c. 1645–47, Metropolitan Museum of Art).

A few independent still life paintings have also been attributed to Teniers. One of the most accomplished ones of these is the &quot;Still-life with overturned jug&quot; (At Sotheby&#x27;s on 5 December 2007, lot 5).The work is dated to the mid-1630s on stylistic grounds. This work seems to show the influence of the Dutch monochrome still life painters. In particular, its simplicity and studied informality and the use of subtle muted colours bring to mind the work of contemporary artists from Leiden and Haarlem. However, is not clear whether Teniers was in fact directly influenced by these artists, and if so how. No similar still life paintings are known in Antwerp at this early date. At the time Teniers created this still life painting, the principal influence on him was Adriaen Brouwer, who had returned from Haarlem to Antwerp around 1631–2. To date Brouwer is not known to have been active as a painter of still lifes. While Teniers&#x27;s early work also reveals his knowledge of Dutch artists in Rotterdam such as Pieter de Bloot and the Saftleven brothers, none of these artists were still life painters. The still life may possibly reflect the influence of the important Dutch still life painter Jan Davidsz. de Heem, who had arrived in Antwerp in 1635, the year this picture was made.

===Collaborations===
Collaboration between artists specialized in distinctive genres was a defining feature of artistic practice in 17th-century Antwerp. Teniers was likewise a frequent collaborator with fellow artists. His collaborators included Lucas van Uden, Jan Davidsz. de Heem, Adriaen van Utrecht, Jacques d&#x27;Arthois, his nephew Jan van Kessel the Younger and Gualterus Gysaerts.

An example of such a collaboration is the &quot;Kitchen still life with a vase of flowers, dead birds, a fish and a cat&quot;, which depicts a kitchen in which two men appear to be roasting meat and fish. The left foreground of the painting is dominated by a bouquet of flowers and a still life of game; which were painted by Antwerp still life specialists Nicolaes van Verendael and Carstian Luyckx.

Teniers collaborated on a series of twenty copper panels commissioned by two members of the Moncada family, a noble Catalan family. The panels illustrate the deeds of Guillermo Ramón Moncada and Antonio Moncada, two brothers from the Moncada House who lived at the end of the 14th and beginning of the 15th century in Sicily. Five prominent Flemish artists collaborated on the panels. Of 12 scenes devoted to Guillermo Ramón Moncada, Willem van Herp painted six, Luigi Primo five and Adam Frans van der Meulen one. Teniers was responsible for all eight panels describing the deeds of Antonio Moncada. He painted them not long after the first part of the series had been finished. Jan van Kessel the Elder, a nephew of Teniers and a still life specialist, realised the decorative borders framing each episode.

===Garland paintings===

Another example of a collaborative painting made by Teniers is the composition &quot;The Soap Bubbles&quot; (c. 1660–1670, Louvre). In this work Teniers collaborated again with his nephew Jan van Kessel the Elder who painted a decorative garland representing the four elements around a cartouche showing a young man blowing soap bubbles, which was painted by Teniers. The young man blowing bubbles and the elements in the garland surrounding him such as the flowers, the dead fish and the armor and flags are all references to the theme of vanitas, i.e. the transience of life and the worthless nature of all earthly goods and pursuits.

This type of painting belongs to the genre of the &#x27;garland painting&#x27;, which was invented and developed by Teniers&#x27;s father-in-law Jan Brueghel the Elder in the first two decades of the 17th century. Garland paintings typically show a flower garland around a devotional image or portrait. Other artists involved in the early development of the genre included Hendrick van Balen, Andries Danielsz., Peter Paul Rubens and Daniel Seghers. The genre was initially connected to the visual imagery of the Counter-Reformation movement. The genre was further inspired by the cult of veneration and devotion to Mary prevalent at the Habsburg court (then the rulers over the Southern Netherlands) and in Antwerp generally. The earliest specimens of the genre often include a devotional image of Mary in the cartouche but in later examples the image in the cartouche could be religious as well as secular as is the case of Teniers&#x27;s &quot;The Soap Bubbles&quot;.

In 1676 Teniers collaborated with his nephew or cousin Gualterus Gysaerts, a still life painter, on a series of 19 garland paintings depicting the martyrs of Gorkum. The series was made for the Minorite Church in Mechelen following the beatification of the martyrs on 9 July 1676. Teniers painted the monochrome bust portrait of each martyr in a cartouche while Gysaerts painted the cartouche and the flower garland surrounding it. Of these paintings, eight are known still to exist, one of which, depicting the martyr Hieronymus van Weert, is in the Rijksmuseum. Both Gysaerts and Teniers signed the painting in the Rijksmuseum.

==Influence==
Teniers&#x27;s genre paintings were influential on northern painters of the 17th century. His work was easily accessible to other artists as he was one of the most reproduced artists of his time and prints after his work were produced in large quantities. In Flanders he influenced his pupil Gillis van Tilborgh and David Rijckaert III. In the Dutch Republic Thomas Wijck, Frans van Mieris the Elder, Jacob Toorenvliet and Cornelis Bega were influenced by his scenes of alchemists.

In the 18th century, Parisian collectors eagerly competed to lay their hands on Teniers&#x27;s works. They knew the artist chiefly for his idealized scenes of rural life, paintings of village feasts, interiors with peasants and guardroom scenes. Teniers&#x27;s work was very much admired by French painters of that time, particularly Antoine Watteau. Without Teniers&#x27;s influence it is unlikely that Watteau would have developed his typical style and subjects. In particular the village feasts of Teniers had shown the way for Watteau in the development of his &quot;fêtes galantes&quot;, which featured figures in ball dress or masquerade costumes disporting themselves amorously in parkland settings. In the 18th century, Watteau was commonly described as the &#x27;French Teniers&#x27;, thus showing that the comparison between the two artists contributed to Watteau&#x27;s success. Other French painters of this time who were influenced by Teniers include Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin, Étienne Jeaurat and Jean-Baptiste Greuze. Some art historians see a direct link between Teniers&#x27;s &quot;A cobbler in his workshop&quot; and Chardin&#x27;s &quot;Canary&quot; based on thematic as well as compositional similarities.

<doc id="850433" wikidata="Q5144968" url="?curid=850433" title="Colin Cant">
<text>Colin Cant is a British television director, producer and scenic designer, best known for his work for the children&#x27;s department of BBC Television from the 1970s to the 1990s. After beginning his career as a designer, he moved to directing and worked on many BBC children&#x27;s series. He was involved for several years as both a director and producer on the long-running school-based drama series &quot;Grange Hill&quot;. He remained active in television into the 21st century, directing for the ITV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in 2005.

==Career==

Cant initially trained as an architect, but switched to working in television design after watching a documentary programme about it, and realising how much more quickly his work could be realised in that area as opposed to the longer construction time of architecture. He began his career in television in the 1960s, earning his earliest credits as a scenic designer on programmes such as the BBC Scotland series &quot;This Man Craig&quot;. He was encouraged by one of his colleagues there, future film director Ridley Scott, to make the move into directing. His first directing work came on &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in 1971; he had written an on-spec letter to the soap opera&#x27;s production team pitching for directing work, which happened to coincide with new directors being needed for the programme.

Cant was the first ever director on &quot;Grange Hill&quot; in 1978, and was responsible for much of the original casting for the programme. Cant&#x27;s work on &quot;Grange Hill&quot; saw him awarded - jointly with Anna Home - a British Academy Television Award (BAFTA) in 1979. He also received two further BAFTA nominations for his work on the series, in 1981 and 1982.

Cant also directed several stand-alone children&#x27;s drama serials and literary adaptations, including &quot;Moonfleet&quot; (1984), &quot;Moondial&quot; (1988), &quot;Dark Season&quot; (1991) and &quot;Century Falls&quot; (1993). The latter pair of serials were two of the earliest works from the writer Russell T Davies, who went on to have a distinguished career in British television drama. Cant had specifically asked Davies for a new serial after having been impressed with his work on &quot;Dark Season&quot;, as he had been commissioned to direct a serial by another writer with whom he was not impressed, and asked if Davies could come up with something better instead. In &quot;Dark Season&quot;, Cant had cast future Academy Award winner Kate Winslet in one of her first leading roles on screen.

Cant also worked in adult television, including three stints as a director on &quot;Coronation Street&quot;; in 1971–72, 1995–96 and 2000–05. He also directed episodes of the police drama &quot;Juliet Bravo&quot;, legal drama &quot;Crown Court&quot; and another ITV soap opera, &quot;Emmerdale&quot;.

<text>The United Democrats (, &quot;Enomenoi Dimokrates&quot; (EDI)) is a liberal political party in Cyprus. The party was founded by former President of Cyprus George Vasiliou in 1993 as &quot;Kinima Eleftheron Dimokraton&quot; (&quot;Movement of Free Democrats&quot;). The party later merged with ADISOK (a group of former AKEL members, including Andreas Fantis, Andreas Ziartides and Pavlos Diglis) to form United Democrats.
The party is a full member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and an observer member of the Liberal International.

==History==
At the legislative elections, on 27 May 2001, the party won 2.6% of the popular vote and 1 out of 56 seats.

During the 2004 Annan Plan Referendum, the party supported the Annan Plan for Cyprus.

<text>The Star-Spangled Kid is the name of several superheroes in the DC Comics&#x27; main shared universe.

==Fictional character history==
===Sylvester Pemberton===

The original Star-Spangled Kid was Sylvester Pemberton, a Golden Age character, created by Superman co-creator Jerry Siegel. He adopted the identity to battle Nazism during World War II, and was unique in being a child with an adult sidekick, Stripesy a.k.a. Pat Dugan. Both he and Dugan were superb acrobats along with having sufficient training in hand-to-hand combat, but the pair regularly bickered about which of them should get top billing.

Decades later, he changed his name to Skyman and led Infinity Inc. He was later killed by Mister Bones&#x27;s cyanide touch.

===Courtney Whitmore===

Courtney is Pat Dugan&#x27;s stepdaughter, who found Pemberton&#x27;s gear in his belongings and donned the Cosmic Converter Belt, with a costume of her own design. She begins her career as the second Star-Spangled Kid to annoy Dugan as partial revenge for him marrying her mother and supposedly forcing the family to move from Los Angeles to Blue Valley, Nebraska. Dugan, a skilled mechanic, designs and builds S.T.R.I.P.E., a mecha which he rides in to accompany and protect her. Eventually, she joins the JSA and, after being given Jack Knight&#x27;s cosmic rod, changes her identity to Stargirl.

===Miss Martian===

A third Star-Spangled Kid appears in &quot;Terror Titans&quot; #1 and is subsequently captured by the Terror Titans team for the Dark Side Club. The Star-Spangled Kid is forced to fight in a tournament against other meta-humans, going on to win the tournament. During the course of the storyline he appears to have a much stronger resistance to brainwashing than the other fighters, although he does eventually succumb. Later, it is revealed that he is the shape-shifting Miss Martian, who is immune to the brainwashing and gradually frees the other combatants.

==Other versions==
* An African-American child based on the Star-Spangled Kid, simply named Stars, appears in &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;. This version wears a leather jacket, an American flag bandana, a T-shirt with an inverted American flag, and a cosmic belt in addition to wielding the Cosmic Staff. Additionally, he is accompanied by a muscular older man called &quot;Stripes&quot;.
* The Star-Spangled Kid appears in &quot;Tiny Titans&quot; #38.

==In other media==

* The Sylvester Pemberton incarnation of the Star-Spangled Kid appears in the &quot;Smallville&quot; two-part episode &quot;Absolute Justice&quot;, portrayed by Jim Shield.
* The Sylvester Pemberton incarnation of the Star-Spangled Kid appears in a photograph depicted in the &quot;Stargirl&quot; episode &quot;Brainwave&quot;.

<text>The Academy was an English dual-control car built by West of Coventry between 1906 and 1908. The cars had a 14 hp 4-cylinder engine by White and Poppe.

It was mainly sold to The Motor Academy in London, an early driving school which was probably the first to offer dual control (having additional set of driving controls), but it was also available to the general public.

<doc id="850443" wikidata="Q1648940" url="?curid=850443" title="Pat Dugan">
<text>Patrick &quot;Pat&quot; Dugan is a superhero in the DC Comics Universe. The former adult sidekick to teenage superhero Sylvester Pemberton, the Star-Spangled Kid, Dugan is a gifted mechanic known for inventions such as the Star Rocket Racer. Originally called &quot;Stripesy&quot; while working with the Seven Soldiers of Victory and the All-Star Squadron before building a powered suit of armor dubbed S.T.R.I.P.E. (Special Tactics Robotic Integrated Power Enhancer). Dugan as Stripesy was created by Jerry Siegel and Hal Sherman and first appeared in &quot;Star Spangled Comics&quot; #1 (October 1941).

Pat Dugan appeared on The CW show &quot;Stargirl&quot;, played by Luke Wilson.

==Fictional character biography==
Patrick &quot;Pat&quot; Dugan was the chauffeur of young rich-kid Sylvester Pemberton. He got involved in superheroics after aiding Pemberton against enemy spies. The two team up as embodiments of the American flag, Sylvester as the Star-Spangled Kid and Pat as Stripesy, to track down and stop the spies.

When the Soldiers are lost in time during the late forties after battling the Nebula Man, they are rescued by the Justice League of America and returned to the present day. Batman, Hourman and Starman retrieve Stripesy from ancient Egypt. Upon his return, Dugan marries a woman named Maggie, who leaves him later to raise their son Michael on her own. Compounding his problems is the fact that Sylvester Pemberton&#x27;s black sheep relative Arthur had stolen Dugan&#x27;s patents during their disappearance. Upon hearing about this, Sylvester returns the patents to Pat, and the two reconcile. Dugan is later involved with Infinity, Inc. and their battle against the Injustice Society. The group&#x27;s first victim is Sylvester Pemberton. The villains Harlequin, the Dummy, and Hazard focus their attention on Dugan just days later. Their plan is to kill him at Stellar Studios, the headquarters of Infinity, Inc. When Pat&#x27;s son becomes involved, Hazard experiences a change of heart and uses her powers to save their lives. Dummy uses the two as bait, but Hazard throws the battle, and the group is defeated. Hazard willingly gives herself up to the police.


The character has been updated for a new audience: In the &quot;Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.&quot; series Dugan had gotten married (for the second time) and settled in Blue Valley. His stepdaughter, Courtney Whitmore, became the second Star-Spangled Kid, partly to annoy him. This led Dugan to develop a robotic suit of power armor and assume the identity of S.T.R.I.P.E. so as to accompany and protect her.

Dugan has gone on missions without Courtney. During the Day of Judgement incident, he travels into space with Captain Marvel and Starfire. Their goal was to retrieve the Spear of Destiny to use against the fallen angel Asmodel, who had led a demonic invasion of Earth. The trio of heroes battle reanimated corpses of abandoned Russian cosmonauts and the corrupting influence of the Spear itself. Dugan is forced to subdue Starfire and the Spear is brought back to Earth and successfully used.

Following the events of the series, Dugan and his family moved to Metropolis, where he has assisted Superman&#x27;s comrade Steel. Since then, they have moved back to Blue Valley. Dugan and his wife had a daughter, Patricia, who will one day become Starwoman and continue the Starman legacy (Patricia&#x27;s existence was mentioned off-handedly in a &quot;Starman&quot; story arc before the character or even Courtney Whitmore were created).

Like the rest of the Seven Soldiers, Dugan is younger than he should be, owing to time travel. For a time, Dugan would become even younger, aged to pre-adolescence with many other heroes due to Klarion the Witch Boy. He joins in on at least one battle while armorless (presumably because his armor is now too big), tackling a mystically created monster with his bare hands. Pat, along with most everyone affected, turns back to normal when Klarion is blackmailed into reversing the effects.

Pat worked with the Justice Society of America for a short time, mostly in a supporting role. He retooled one of Ted Knight&#x27;s old designs and created the Steel Eagle, a new aircraft for the team. He also completely re-engineered S.T.R.I.P.E., changing its entire appearance.

Later, Pat and his family were almost slain by The Fourth Reich, a Nazi organization who tried to wipe out heroic legacies. Right before this, Pat was encouraging his son, Mike, not to create S.T.R.I.P.E. parts in shop class. Pat and his family were saved by the Justice Society. Later, Pat hosted Courtney&#x27;s birthday party at his house, inviting the whole Justice Society.

A while later, when Courtney was missing, Pat offered to Power Girl that he could get S.T.R.I.P.E. out and help find her, to which Power Girl stated was not necessary.

In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC&#x27;s continuity. Pat Dugan is the boyfriend of Barbara Whitmore. Courtney was cleaning out the office of Barbara Whitmore&#x27;s boyfriend Pat Dugan when she found a staff, a belt, and a shirt with a star on it. While trying them on, she became Stargirl and caught the perpetrator of a fire she spotted. The heroic actions went viral. Courtney was informed by Pat that the person who originally wielded the equipment has died. Though Pat agreed to train her, Courtney had to respond to the criminal activity caused by Shadow Thief who was taking hostages to draw out a superhero.

In the &quot;Watchmen&quot; sequel &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, S.T.R.I.P.E. returns alongside many other superheroes to the DC Universe when Doctor Manhattan, inspired by Superman, undoes the changes that he made to the timeline that erased the Justice Society and the Legion of Super-Heroes.

In the pages of &quot;The New Golden Age&quot;, Pat took Courtney to Myrtle Beach at the time when the Seven Soldiers of Victory were reassembled by the Jill Carlyle version of Crimson Avenger. Pat operated S.T.R.I.P.E. when they were fighting Clock King. Pat would later mention to Courtney that Wing is buried in his grave when she brought up what Crimson Avenger said to her before being sent back to his own time. He mentions to Courtney that Cyclone and Jakeem Thunder are still her friends.

==Powers and abilities==
Pat Dugan has no superpowers, but is a gifted mechanic, having built Sylvester Pemberton&#x27;s Star-Rocket Racer, the JSA&#x27;s Steel Eagle. Being a superb hand-to-hand combatant he can take on anyone, even enemies bigger than him. Thanks to his power armor he can fly and has great physical strength and stamina.

===Equipment===
Pat also operated an armor suit named &quot;S.T.R.I.P.E.&quot; equipped with a range of ballistic weapons and utilities, and that also gave him enhanced strength and flight ability. Its circuitry was vulnerable to water.

==Other versions==
In &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, Alex Ross portrays Stripesy as a black adult, renamed &quot;Stripes&quot;, and is equipped with various military accoutrements such as automatic weaponry, knives, and kevlar padding.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Pat Dugan as S.T.R.I.P.E. appears in &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, voiced by an uncredited Phil LaMarr. This version is a member of the Justice League.
* Pat Dugan appears in &quot;Stargirl&quot;, portrayed by Luke Wilson. This version is largely based on his appearance in the &quot;Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.&quot; comic, being a former member of the Seven Soldiers of Victory and Justice Society of America (JSA) as well as the sidekick of Sylvester Pemberton / Starman. When his stepdaughter Courtney Whitmore decides to become Stargirl, Dugan assists her in a mechanized battle suit he built years earlier, but never used until then. Despite his reluctance to become a superhero again, Courtney anoints him as her partner and changes his original codename, &quot;Stripesy&quot;, to S.T.R.I.P.E. based on an acronym she coined for his armor. When the family moves to Blue Valley, he opens and runs a garage called the Pit Stop. Initially disliked by Courtney owing to her hoping that her birth father Sam Kurtis would return to her life, Dugan eventually wins her over after she learns of his past, devotion to his family, and brilliance in mechanical engineering; becoming a surrogate father figure and reluctant mentor to her and later her iteration of the JSA. While S.T.R.I.P.E. is primarily portrayed by CGI, Legacy Effects created a practical S.T.R.I.P.E. to be used during filming.
** Ahead of the series premiere, S.T.R.I.P.E. appeared in the Arrowverse crossover &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; via archive footage from the &quot;Stargirl&quot; episode &quot;The Justice Society&quot;.

===Film===
An alternate universe incarnation of Pat Dugan appears in &quot;Justice League: Gods and Monsters&quot;, voiced by Dan Gilvezan. This version is a scientist and member of Lex Luthor&#x27;s &quot;Project Fair Play&quot;, a contingency program meant to destroy their universe&#x27;s Justice League if necessary. After three of their number are killed, Dugan and the remaining scientists attempt to regroup, but are killed by the Metal Men.

===Miscellaneous===
Pat Dugan as S.T.R.I.P.E. appears in the &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; tie-in comic book.

<text>Nimrod is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #191 (March 1985), and was created by writer Chris Claremont and artist John Romita Jr.

Hailing from the &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; timeline, Nimrod is a powerful, virtually indestructible descendant of the robotic mutant-hunting Sentinels. His name is derived from the biblical figure described in Genesis as a &quot;mighty hunter&quot;.

==Publication history==
The character was created by writer Chris Claremont and artist John Romita Jr., and first appeared in &quot;X-Men&quot; #191 (March 1985). Nimrod made subsequent appearances in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #193-194 (May–June 1985), #197 (September 1985), #208-209 (August–September 1986), #246-247 (July–August 1989), &quot;X-Force&quot; #35 (June 1994), &quot;Cable &amp; Machine Man&quot; Annual #1 (Annual 1998), &quot;Mutant X&quot; #10 (July 1999), &quot;Weapon X: Days of Future Now&quot; #1 (September 2005), #4 (December 2005), &quot;New X-Men&quot; vol. 2 #22 (March 2006), #25-31 (June–December 2006), #36 (May 2007), &quot;New Warriors&quot; vol. 4 #3 (October 2007), &quot;X-Factor&quot; vol. 3 #23 (November 2007), &quot;X-Force&quot; vol. 3 #1-2 (April–May 2008), and &quot;Powers of X&quot; #1-3 (July–August 2019).

Originally, Claremont intended to use Captain Britain villain Fury, but Alan Moore had ownership of the Marvel UK character and the possibility of litigation caused Claremont to create the similar character of Nimrod instead. 

Nimrod received an entry in &quot;The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition&quot; #9.

==Fictional character biography==
Nimrod is a mutant-hunting Sentinel from an alternative future and was created by the Sentinels ruling that timeline. Rachel Summers travels backwards in time to the present, but Nimrod follows. Although not capable of time travel by himself, he was transported back in time by Doctor Strange and Magik using their powers to change time to prevent Kulan Gath&#x27;s occupation of New York. Nimrod saves the life of construction worker Jaime Rodriguez by slaying a mugger (Kulan Gath&#x27;s destined host) who would have otherwise killed Rodriguez. In gratitude Rodriguez offers Nimrod a job and a home with his family, not realizing who or what the shape-shifting Sentinel truly is.
After gathering information about the timeline in which he finds himself, Nimrod eventually changes his prime directive from the extermination of all mutants, having determined that such widespread destruction is not necessary in this era, to only the extermination of mutants who were regarded as outlaws by the government, such as the X-Men. He fights the Juggernaut. He hunts Summers and the X-Men, but is defeated by Rogue when Rogue absorbs the mutant powers of Nightcrawler, Kitty Pryde, and Colossus. Based on a plan that Kitty conceives before losing consciousness, Rogue uses Nightcrawler&#x27;s teleportation to teleport part of Nimrod&#x27;s body away, with Rogue&#x27;s and Colossus&#x27;s combined invulnerability protecting Rogue from the resulting physical strain in a manner that Nightcrawler could not have handled.

Some time after this, Nimrod garners a reputation with the public of New York City as a heroic vigilante, assuming he is simply a man in powered armor. He also adopts the cover alias Nicholas Hunter, a more human personality as a construction worker.

Nimrod later faces the combined forces of the X-Men and the Hellfire Club and proves himself as a powerful threat, killing Black Rook Friedrich Von Roehm, causing Harry Leland&#x27;s fatal heart attack, nearly killing Nightcrawler and badly injuring Rogue and Sebastian Shaw.

Nimrod comes across a piece of the gigantic Sentinel Master Mold while working on a construction site. His programming is immediately co-opted; Master Mold merges with Nimrod, using its systems to rebuild Nimrod in its own image. The X-Men are initially hard pressed to defeat the reborn Master Mold, but Nimrod comes to the aid, claiming he has evolved as well and no longer views the X-Men or mutants as a threat. Nimrod asserts enough control over Master Mold to render immobile, and even convinces it that it has become a mutant as well. To fulfill its prime directive to exterminate mutants, it must self-destruct. The remains of both robots are pushed through the Siege Perilous, a mystical gateway that causes all who passed through it to be reborn with new bodies. Nimrod and Master Mold are merged into the being Bastion, a man who had absolutely no memory of his former existence.

In &quot;X-Force&quot;, a modern-day version of Nimrod appears. Created by an offshoot of Project Wideawake, this version is based on the technology derived from the version from the future. In truth, between the time of Nimrod&#x27;s first arrival and its apparent destruction when it merged with Master Mold and had traveled through the Siege Perilous, it had taken precautionary measures to ensure its survival. By downloading a self-awareness program into the base&#x27;s military computer cybernet, the program served as a sleeper virus that awaited the opportunity to access a Sentinel development program so it could use it to re-create Nimrod itself. Nimrod&#x27;s detection of the invading X-Force had caused it to act before it had originally intended to fulfill its imperative. It deactivates itself when Cable convinces Nimrod that its earlier creation in the timeline would cause a paradox and incalculable damage to the timestream.

Reverend William Stryker later found Nimrod&#x27;s damaged remains after entering the Marvel timeline from an alternate one. Immobilized, Stryker secretly uses Nimrod&#x27;s memories of future events to give him the appearance of precognition to his followers and to help plan an attack on the X-Men and other mutants, but Nimrod alters its memories to facilitate its own escape, and Stryker is defeated. During the &quot;New X-Men&quot; story arc &quot;Nimrod&quot;, it searches for Forge, whom it believes is its creator. Nimrod believes Forge can repair its damaged body, but Forge instead transfers Nimrod&#x27;s programming into a new chassis which Forge can control. Believing Forge to be in danger, the New X-Men travel to his workshop to help him. This eventually leads to Nimrod gaining control over his body and attacking Forge and the New X-Men. Nimrod is defeated when Surge overloads Nimrod&#x27;s temporal unit, blasting Nimrod out of the timestream. Nimrod survives and travels back in time to March 1985, where the events involving Jaime Rodriguez and Kulan Gath&#x27;s amulet play out exactly as they had originally with its memory corrupted, resulting in its existence in the &#x27;true&#x27; timeline — with Rachel&#x27;s history erased — becoming a temporal paradox.

The series &quot;X-Force&quot; reveals that the Purifiers held on to most of Nimrod&#x27;s original body and fuse with Bastion&#x27;s head to reform Bastion. He then, using the Technarch transmode virus, revives numerous villains that have destroyed many mutants.

During the events of Second Coming, Bastion personally confronts Hope Summers, Rogue and Nightcrawler, leading to the death of the latter. Bastion appears to be reverting more and more to fully being Nimrod. Some time later, Bastion unleashes an endless horde of Nimrods from an unknown future to destroy the X-Men. However, X-Force, Cypher and Cable go to that future and destroy the controlling Master Mold behind them. Ultimately, the original Nimrod (Bastion) takes his original form, but is destroyed by Hope. Nimrod&#x27;s chest and head are later shown to be exhibited in X-Force Headquarters. Deathlok identifies it as version 32.1 and the possibility for its future to come to be is 1.34%.

During a brief glimpse three months into the future seen in &quot;Uncanny Avengers&quot;, Havok, Scarlet Witch and Sunfire are shown fleeing from a new model of Sentinel. Havok refers to the machines as Nimrod units.

===Dawn of X===
In this new X-Men timeline of &quot;Dawn of X&quot;, &quot;Nimrod the Lesser&quot; is seen 90 years in the future, along with &quot;Nimrod the Greater&quot; seen 990 years in the future. It was soon revealed that a human coalition of scientists and espionage agents from various secret agencies have joined forces to form Orchis, the ultimate mutant-fighting organization. Along with the former X-Man Omega Sentinel and built on the remains of Sol&#x27;s Hammer, they have created the Orchis Forge solar orbiting space station which serves as a construction platform for Mother Mold, a Master Mold capable of creating other Master Mold Sentinels. After intel provided by Moira MacTaggart suggests that this event is the probable origin of the Nimrod Sentinels, a team of X-Men invade the Orchis Forge and successfully decouple the giant Sentinel before it fully awakens, sending it plummeting into the sun.

Later on the Orchis Forge, it is discovered by Mystique during an infiltration mission that Director Killian Devo has completed work on an unknown component that Dr. Alia Gregor installs inside the torso of a Nimrod unit that is in the initial stages of construction.

At the behest of Xavier and Magneto, Mystique returns for a final desperate mission in the Orchis Forge to detonate a mini-black hole bomb designed by Forge capable of annihilating the entire station. Her mission coincides with Dr. Gregor preparing to resurrect her husband, Captain Erasmus Mendel, who was killed in the original Orchis raid, into the chassis of her newly constructed Sentinel prototype. The activation succeeds and the crystalline memory transfer is successful, but the Erasmus persona prototype immediately detects the disguised Mystique as a Mutant and sacrifices itself to save the Orchis base by teleporting into space with the bomb she has triggered, leaving two emotionless duplicates without Erasmus&#x27; memory core yet uploaded to subdue Mystique before she can escape the station, and to protect Dr. Gregor. Executing Mystique through the entrance of her Krakoa escape portal, the fearsome Sentinel announces his existence as &quot;Nimrod, The Hunter&quot; to the X-Men, who have failed once again in their attempt to destroy Orchis, vowing to hunt down and kill all Mutants.

Aware of Nimrod&#x27;s creation by Orchis, Bishop, who refers to the prototype as &quot;Nimrod 2.0&quot;, advises the X-Men, the Hellfire Club and X-Force about the formation of a highly specialized strike team that has experience fighting Nimrod Sentinels in the past and to create unorthodox weapons and strategies to deal with Orchis&#x27; new threat.

Having failed on all sixteen attempts to destroy the Orchis Forge, at the cost of numerous deaths and resurrections of nearly every X-Man involved in the attacks, Nimrod, who Dr. Alia Gregor laments is no longer carrying the Erasmus persona, has proven to be unstoppable. Moira MacTaggart warns Xavier and Magneto that it will only be a few years before Nimrod evolves beyond Orchis&#x27; control.

==Powers and abilities==
Nimrod is the most advanced form of Sentinel robot. Nimrod can convert his outward appearance to resemble that of an ordinary human being. Nimrod can also reconstruct himself so as to make improvements in his robotic form and internal systems that will make him a more formidable opponent. Even when smashed to pieces, Nimrod can reintegrate the portions of his body to become whole again. Apparently Nimrod&#x27;s electronic consciousness can somehow exist independently of his physical body, at least temporarily. Physically Nimrod is categorized in the &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot; as possessing &quot;Class 100&quot; strength because Nimrod could engage the Juggernaut in hand-to-hand combat.

Nimrod contains highly advanced computer systems as well as scanning devices that make it possible for him to determine whether a human being is a superhuman or not; if they are, he can determine the nature of their superhuman abilities. Like present day Sentinels, Nimrod can draw upon devices and systems within his robotic body to cope with or neutralize an opponent&#x27;s superhuman power once he has determined the nature of that power.

Nimrod is capable of projecting energy blasts, magnetic energy to levitate material, create force fields, and can teleport. Nimrod has a weakness for elemental attacks such as lightning or extreme cold.

==Other versions==
The &quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot; reality featured Nimrod-esque Sentinels as a new type of Sentinels developed by the US government after the Ultimatum Wave. One such model chases and successfully takes down Rogue until rescued by Kitty Pryde. They are eventually infused with the brain-patterns of William Stryker, Jr. when manifesting mutant powers for the first time in years. The Nimrod Sentinels later build a base for their operations based for Master Mold.

<text>Acadian is a make of automobile produced by General Motors of Canada from 1962 to 1971. The Acadian was introduced so Canadian Pontiac-Buick dealers would have a compact model to sell, since the Pontiac Tempest was unavailable in Canada. Plans originally called for the Acadian to be based on the Chevrolet Corvair, which was produced at GM&#x27;s Oshawa plant; however, the concept was moved to the Chevy II platform to be introduced for 1962. The brand was also offered in Chile, with models built in Arica.

== History ==
=== Acadian brand (1962–1971) ===
To promote automobile manufacturing in Canada, the APTA (also known as the &quot;Auto Pact&quot;) in the 1960s had provisions prohibiting sales of certain United States-made cars. General Motors responded by offering certain makes of cars manufactured in Canada primarily for the Canadian market such as Acadian, and Beaumont, which started as an offering in the Acadian line, but later became its own brand in 1966. Initially, Acadians were retrimmed Chevy IIs, offered as a base model, mid-priced Invader and top-line Beaumont. The car used Pontiac styling cues, such as a split grille, but was marketed as a separate make, never as a Pontiac. As with the concurrent Chevy II, Acadians were offered with four-cylinder, six-cylinder, and V8 engines. No Mark IV (big block) Acadians were ever produced in any year, unlike the sister car Chevrolet Nova SS. The choice of transmission depended upon the model and engine installed, three- and four-speed manual gearboxes or the two-speed Powerglide automatic. During its early years, the top-line Beaumont offered more brightwork than the equivalent Chevy II Nova. For 1963, a new mid-range series Acadian was introduced as the Canso, priced in between the Beaumont and Invader. It was available as two- or four-door sedan.

For 1964 and 1965, the Beaumont name was moved to a retrimmed version of the intermediate Chevrolet Chevelle, while the Canso was moved upmarket to the top-line compact model, equivalent of the Nova. &quot;Invader&quot; became the series name for the base model. Data for the 1966 Acadian were: engines available were six-cylinder (194 cid, 8.5 compression ratio, 120 bhp rated), V8 (283 cid, 9.25 compression ratio, 195 bhp), or the L79 (327 cid, 11.00 compression ratio, 350 bhp rated), overall length of 15.25 feet (4.65 m); overall width of 5.94 ft (1.81 m); height of 4.48 ft (1.37 m); turning circle of 38.4 ft (11.7 m); front track of 4.73 ft (1.44 m), and rear track of 4.69 ft (1.43 m). Its fuel tank held 13.5 imperial gallons.

From 1966, Beaumont was designated as a separate make, without the Acadian name; 1966-67 Beaumonts continued to use the Chevrolet Chevelle body with minor styling revisions, including different taillights and a Pontiac-style split grille. The interior used the instrument panel from the American Pontiac Tempest/LeMans/GTO series. Drivetrains were the same as the contemporary Chevelle with the exception of the 396 with 375 rated bhp, as were model offerings. The one exception to Chevelle/Beaumont availability was a base-model Beaumont convertible. Such a model was never available in the Chevelle line in the USA, although it was in Canada. All Acadians and Beaumonts used Chevrolet engines and drivelines. The Beaumont was discontinued after 1969, after which Canadian dealers sold the Pontiac LeMans. The Acadian continued using the Chevy II/Nova body through mid-1971, after which it was replaced by the Pontiac Ventura II. GM would not market another Canadian-exclusive brand until the launch of Passport starting for the 1988 model year.

=== Sport Deluxe ===
During the muscle-car craze in the late 1960s, Chevrolet offered the Chevelle Super Sport and SS 396 models that featured high performance, bucket seats, and sport stripes. In Canada, Beaumont offered an equivalent model, the Sport Deluxe (SD). For 1966, the SD was combined with the Chevrolet 230 cid six- cylinder, 283 or 327 cid small-block V8, or 396 cid Mark IV big-block V8, along with the same optional bucket seats/console package as the Chevelle SS 396, along with unique trim and emblems. Up until approximately the start of December 1966 the Beaumont Sport Deluxe package was an option available on a Beaumont Custom, option A51. After the start of December 1966 the Sport Deluxe became a unique model, not just an option on a Custom. When the SD became a separate model, Strato bucket seats and the floor console became an option, whereas earlier the A51 option package included those items. Many collectors consider the Beaumont SD396 even more desirable than the Chevelle SS 396, since it is far more rare. Many Acadians and Beaumonts succumbed to rough Canadian winters, suffering from rust and mechanical wear and tear, leaving very few original specimens left, in addition to much lower production than equivalent Chevy models.

An equivalent Acadian, the Canso Sport Deluxe, was offered as similar package equivalent to the Chevy II Super Sport, which included the same Strato-bucket seats, console, and floor shift, along with unique SD trim and emblems. Top performance option for any Acadian including the Canso SD was Chevrolet&#x27;s 350-bhp 327 cid L79 small-block V8 (in 1966 only), along with a three- or four-speed manual transmission.

During the late 1960s, the Beaumont was also available in Puerto Rico. A Beaumont Cafeteria actually was co-located with the local Beaumont dealer in San Juan.

== Pontiac Acadian (1976–1987) ==
From 1976 to 1987, the Pontiac Acadian was a version of the Chevrolet Chevette sold by Canadian Pontiac-Buick dealers, initially identical to the Chevette except for badging, but picking up the distinctly &quot;Pontiac&quot; design cues of the U.S. market Pontiac T1000 after that model&#x27;s 1981 introduction. As well, Canadian Pontiac dealers received the T1000 model (which was the name of the U.S. T-car) in 1981. In 1983, the car was simply renamed 1000, until its end in 1985 in Canada. So, for 5 years, Pontiac Canada had two versions of the T-car to sell: the Acadian, and the T1000 / or 1000. Canada lost the 1000 after 1985, but it carried on until 1987 in the U.S.

<text>The [[modern pentathlon]] at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] was held from 26 to 27 August 2004, at the Olympic Modern Pentathlon Centre at the Goudi Olympic Complex. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s events each involved 32 athletes, an increase of eight from the previous games.

The Eastern European nations continued to dominate in the men&#x27;s event as Andrey Moiseev won the gold medal, followed by Lithuania&#x27;s Andrejus Zadneprovskis and Libor Capalini of the Czech Republic, who each obtained the silver and bronze medals, respectively. Zsuzsanna Vörös of Hungary, on the other hand, won the gold medal in the women&#x27;s event, while Latvia&#x27;s Jeļena Rubļevska, who finished eighth in Sydney, took the silver. Georgina Harland of Great Britain won the nation&#x27;s third overall Olympic medal in the women&#x27;s event, as she claimed the bronze.

==Format==
Modern pentathlon contained five events; pistol shooting, épée fencing, 200 m freestyle swimming, show jumping, and a 3 km cross-country run. They were held in that order, with each segment awarding points to competitors based on their performance in the segment. The points from each of the events were summed to give a final ranking; in addition, the running segment at the end of the day used a staggered start designed so that the order in which runners finished would be the same as their ranking by total points.

==Qualification==
Qualification for the modern pentathlon event was run by the International Modern Pentathlon Union (UIPM). 32 men and 32 women qualified, with a limit of 2 competitors per gender for each National Olympic Committee. As a minimum, men were required to have earned 5,100 points either on 1 June 2004 UIPM ranking list or at a continental qualifying competition. Women needed 4,800 points. The pentathlete must have also earned one of 30 qualifying places at a tournament or one of 2 invitational places.

Qualification tournaments were:
* 2002 World Cup Final - first place
* 2003 World Championships - top three places
* 2003 World Cup Final - top two places
* 2003-04 Continental championships:
** Africa - first place
** Asia - top two places
** Oceania - first place
** North America - first place
** South America - first place
** Europe - top three places
* 2004 World Championships - top nine places
* 2004 World Cups - top two places in each of the three competitions

In addition, the host nation was guaranteed at least one competitor in each gender if none qualified as above, and the Tripartite Commission allocated one invitational place. If more than one of the qualification places was won by a single competitor or more than two were won by a single NOC, the field was brought up to 32 competitors by selecting the highest-rated pentathlete on the UIPM ranking list of 1 June 2004.

<doc id="850450" wikidata="Q1773836" url="?curid=850450" title="Sandy Hawkins">
<text>Sanderson &quot;Sandy&quot; Hawkins, formerly known as Sandy the Golden Boy, Sands, Sand and currently known as [[Sandman (DC Comics)|Sandman]], is a character appearing in comics published by DC Comics. He was created by writer Mort Weisinger and artist Paul Norris, he first appeared in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #69. After being unutilized for several years, he was reintroduced by writers David S. Goyer and Geoff Johns in the comic &quot;JSA&quot; in the late 1990s and with a greatly expanded set of powers and responsibilities. He eventually took on the name of Sandman, succeeding his former mentor.

==Publication history==
===Golden Age===
The character of &quot;Sandy the Golden Boy&quot; was created as a sidekick to the Sandman. Created by Mort Weisinger and Paul Norris, the nephew of The Sandman&#x27;s girlfriend Dian Belmont, the character debuted as a tights-wearing youth (in the same vein as Robin the Boy Wonder) in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #69 (Dec 1941). This same issue also showcased a new yellow-and-purple costume for The Sandman.

===Silver Age===
The flourish of mystery-men comic books came to an end in the late 1940s. About ten years later, DC Comics reintroduced some of the mystery-men characters in new books, but reimagined them as super-heroes, characters such as Green Lantern and Hawkman. September 1961 saw the publication of &quot;Flash of Two Worlds&quot; in &quot;The Flash&quot; #123. This was the first new story using an original mystery-man character, namely, the Flash (Jay Garrick). The concept of an Earth-1 and Earth-2 began to be developed and soon other 1940s characters were being used in modern stories. Sandy the Golden Boy was reintroduced to the public by writer Len Wein in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #113 in 1974.

Len Wein wrote of his inspiration in the compilation book &quot;Crisis on Multiple Earths Volume 3&quot; (2004): &quot;I had always been a fan of the Golden Age Sandman, and had always wondered why he&#x27;d been put back into his double-breasted Man of Mystery Gas-Mask outfit when he was revived, instead of the more traditional purple-and-yellow super-hero costume he&#x27;d worn in the latter days of the 1940s. This would make the perfect place to find out. Thus was born &quot;The Creature in the Velvet Cage&quot;&quot;.

In this story, it was revealed that, in the 1940s, Sandy had been transformed into a huge, sand-like creature when an experimental weapon Sandman was testing exploded. Wracked with guilt, Sandman stopped wearing the costume he&#x27;d worn as Sandy&#x27;s partner and went back to his original outfit. The transformed Sandy had been kept in a glass cage for decades. In a later story (&quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #47, July 1982), Sandy was finally turned back into his human self and found that he hadn&#x27;t aged in all that time; physically, he was still a teenager.

===The 1980s and 1990s===
The 1980s saw writer Roy Thomas&#x27; World War II era series &quot;The All-Star Squadron&quot; (pre-Crisis) and the &quot;Young All-Stars&quot; (post-Crisis). Sandy was brought into the Squadron storyline during the &quot;Crisis&quot; crossover, beginning with issue #51 (Nov 1985). That book soon ceased printing and was replaced by the &quot;Young All-Stars&quot; (June 1987) where Sandy played a role in issues 2 through 8. This series states that Sandy is fourteen going on fifteen in the spring of 1942.

Also written by Roy Thomas, the one-issue special &quot;Last Days of the JSA&quot; published in 1986 depicts the departure of the JSA characters. Although taking place in the modern era (within weeks of the Crisis), Sandy is still depicted as a teenager wearing his World War II uniform of yellow-and-red. The story relates how he and other JSA members are taken into Ragnarok where they must fight forever. Published in 1992, the &quot;Armageddon Inferno&quot; miniseries written by John Ostrander takes the JSA members out of Ragnarok and brings them back to Earth, allowing writers to use them in future stories. Sandy is one of these characters.

The 1999 series &quot;JSA&quot; was preceded by a &quot;JSA Secret Files&quot; special. The special and the series reintroduced Sandy, but now as a young man calling himself Sand. This new and further development of the character was written by James Robinson and David S. Goyer. Issue 18 of the series, written by David Goyer and Geoff Johns, introduced retconned history for the character including his &quot;killing&quot; of Johnny Sorrow in 1944 (Sandy shot Sorrow&#x27;s dimension-shifting equipment and the damage trapped Sorrow in another dimension). The JSA–JSA storyline has Sand time travel to 1951 and interact with The Sandman; writer Geoff Johns states the present-day age of the character as being &quot;biologically 25&quot;, but his birth year is changed to 1926 (Roy Thomas had given the character an age of 14 in 1942 making the birth year 1928). The &quot;Velvet Cage&quot; story from the 1970s is also referenced and rewritten to an extent and the year of the silicoid accident is changed from 1947 to 1945. Issue #83 (2006) is part of the One Year Later of the DC comics line; in this issue written by Paul Levitz, Sand is no longer shown as a member of the JSA. Sand makes no more appearances in the series which ended with issue #87 (2006).

This book debuted in February 2007, written by Geoff Johns. The cover of this book shows the round table of the JSA surrounded by 17 heroes including Sanderson Hawkins, now wearing a black cape and fedora reminiscent of the original Sandman, but also gloves and a mask unlike any other incarnation of Sand or The Sandman- it appears to be a cross between the masks of Hawkins &amp; Dodds, and mixed with designs borrowed from the Helm of Dream of the Endless. According to Geoff Johns&#x27; interview in &quot;Wizard&quot; #180 (October 2006) Sand would become the JSA&#x27;s &quot;Recon Man&quot; doing more detective work in the process. He was brought in on issue #3, appearing in a cloud of smoke and speaking of nightmares, attributes more recognizable of Wesley Dodds than for Sanderson Hawkins. Issue #5 shows this version of Hawkins as more sober and serious than previous incarnations. For about a year the character was not used in the series, nor were his face and name shown in the JSA roll call found framing the main story pages. He was not seen again until issue #14 (2008) where Johns portrayed him as tormented by perverse and horror-filled nightmares. He was briefly freed of these dreams by the powerful Gog, as part of a series of gifts Gog gave to those who confronted him, but Sand came to reject this gift as he felt it made him a less effective investigator, discovering a dead child that he was sure he could have saved if he still had his dreams. When the JSA discovered that Gog was forming a parasitical bond to Earth that would make it impossible for him to leave without destroying the planet if he wasn&#x27;t driven off now, Gog took back his gifts in a fit of pique.

In the &quot;Watchmen&quot; sequel &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Hawkins returns alongside many other superheroes to the DC Universe when Doctor Manhattan, inspired by Superman, undoes the changes that he made to the timeline that erased the Justice Society and the Legion of Super-Heroes.

===The New Golden Age===
In the pages of &quot;The New Golden Age&quot;, Sandy&#x27;s history of being Dian&#x27;s nephew is still intact. Following the death of Wheeler Vanderlyle, Dian brings him to an almost-rebuilt Dodds Mansion where she introduces him to Wesley Dodds.

==Powers and abilities==
Like his mentor, Hawkins developed prophetic dreams. He later gained a silicon-based body that is elastic, highly durable, and able to transform into sand.

===Equipment===
Hawkins is proficient with many handgun-based weapons such as gas guns and wirepoon guns.

==In other media==
* Sandy Hawkins / Sand makes non-speaking cameo appearances in &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; as a member of the Justice League.
* Sandy Hawkins / Sand received an action figure in Mattel&#x27;s &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; toyline.

<doc id="850454" wikidata="Q904168" url="?curid=850454" title="Bruce Ames">
<text>Bruce Nathan Ames (December 16, 1928 – October 5, 2024) was an American biochemist who was a professor of biochemistry and Molecular Biology Emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, and was a senior scientist at Children&#x27;s Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI). Ames made contributions to understanding the mechanisms of mutagenesis and DNA repair. He invented the Ames test, a widely used assay for easily and cheaply evaluating the mutagenicity of compounds. The test revolutionized the field of toxicology and has played a crucial role in identifying numerous environmental and industrial carcinogens.

==Biography==
Ames, raised in New York City, was a graduate of the Bronx High School of Science. His undergraduate studies were at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and his graduate studies were completed at the California Institute of Technology.

Ames was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1970. He is a recipient of the Bolton S. Corson Medal in 1980, Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement in 1985, the Japan Prize in 1997, the National Medal of Science in 1998 and the Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal in 2004, among many others.

Ames&#x27; research focuses on cancer and aging and he has authored over 550 scientific publications. He is among the few hundred most-cited scientists in all fields.

Ames&#x27; later research included identifying agents that delay the mitochondrial decay of aging, understanding the role of mitochondrial decay in aging, particularly in the brain, optimizing micronutrient intakes in the population to prevent disease, malnutrition, and obesity. He was also interested in mutagens as they relate to cancer prevention and aging.

Ames received more than $650,000 in support from the National Foundation for Cancer Research between 1998 and 2007.

He was married to Giovanna Ferro-Luzzi Ames, who was also a professor of biochemistry at the University of California, Berkeley.

Ames died of complications from a fall on October 5, 2024 at a hospital in Berkeley, California at the age of 95.

==Ames on synthetic carcinogens==
In the 1970s, Ames developed the Ames test which is a cheap and convenient assay for mutagens and therefore potential carcinogens. Previous carcinogenic testing used live animals, and the procedures are expensive and time-consuming. This made animal testing impractical for use in screening on a wide scale, and reduced the number of compounds that could be tested. The Ames test on the other hand uses the bacteria &quot;Salmonella typhimurium&quot; to test for mutagens, and is considerably cheaper and faster. The Ames test became widely used as an initial screen for possible carcinogens and has been used to identify potential carcinogens previously used in commercial products. Their identification led to some of those formulations, such as chemicals used in hair dye, being withdrawn from commercial use. The ease with which Ames test allows widely used chemicals to be identified as possible carcinogens made him an early hero of environmentalism.

Subsequent work in Ames&#x27; lab involved looking at an overview of what was mutagenic or carcinogenic, and to what degree. Previously, scientists tended to only look for positive or negative results without considering the magnitude of the effect, which meant that as more and more items were shown to be potentially mutagenic, there was no system for evaluating the relative dangers. He also continued to test various natural and man-made compounds, and discovered that, despite what he and others had assumed, naturally occurring compounds were not turning out to be benign as compared to man-made ones. His continued work eventually led to his falling out of favor with many environmentalists. As natural chemicals turned out to also be frequently mutagenic, he argued that environmental exposure to manufactured chemicals may be of limited relevance to human cancer, even when such chemicals are mutagenic in an Ames test and carcinogenic in rodent assays. He contended that most human genetic damage arises from essential micronutrients lacking in poor diets and the oxidation of DNA during normal metabolism, and that the most important environmental carcinogens may include some whose chief effect is to cause the chronic division of stem cells whereby the normal protective mechanisms of a cell become less effective.

He argued against the banning of synthetic pesticides and other chemicals such as Alar which have been shown to be carcinogenic. Ames published results showing that many ordinary food products would be found carcinogenic according to the same criteria. Ames was concerned that overzealous attention to the relatively minor health effects of trace quantities of carcinogens may divert scarce financial resources away from major health risks, and cause public confusion about the relative importance of different hazards. Ames considered himself a leading “contrarian in the hysteria over tiny traces of chemicals that may or may not cause cancer&quot;, and said that &quot;if you have thousands of hypothetical risks that you are supposed to pay attention to, that completely drives out the major risks you should be aware of.&quot;

<text>The Accles-Turrell was an English automobile built between 1899 and 1901 in Perry Bar, Birmingham, England and from 1901 to 1902 in Ashton-under-Lyne.

The company began in 1899 when the British pioneer motorist Charles McRobie Turrell, who had helped organise the 1896 London-Brighton Emancipation Run, joined Accles Ltd, a Birmingham engineering company. The car was a 3 hp two-seater light carriage equipped with a single-cylinder engine of Accles manufacture and a body by Arthur Mulliner of Northampton. The engine drove the rear wheels by a belt to the 3-speed gearbox and chain to the wheels. The top speed was claimed to be .

In 1901 a larger four-seat 10/15 hp car was made and the rights to this &quot;vibrationless, very simple, quiet and efficient&quot; &quot;New Turrell&quot; car were acquired by Pollock Ltd. of Ashton-under-Lyne. The car had a flat twin 10/15 hp engine under the front seat driving the rear wheels through a two-speed constant mesh gearbox. The car was later made by the Autocar Construction Company and sold as the Hermes.

Accles and Pollock soon joined forces to become the tube-making company Accles &amp; Pollock. The Accles &amp; Pollock tube brand is currently owned by Tyco.

<doc id="850460" wikidata="Q60146" url="?curid=850460" title="Abomination (character)">
<text>The Abomination (Emil Blonsky) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Gil Kane, the character first appeared in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; #90 (April 1967). He is one of the main enemies of the superhero Hulk, and possesses powers similar to his after also being exposed to gamma rays.

Debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books, the character has been featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as arcade and video games, television series, and merchandise such as action figures and trading cards. Tim Roth portrays Emil Blonsky / Abomination in the live-action Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (2008) and &quot;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&quot; (2021), as well as the Disney+ series &quot;She-Hulk: Attorney at Law&quot; (2022).

==Publication history==
Stan Lee chose the name &quot;the Abomination&quot;, which he realized belonged to no other character, before conceiving the character&#x27;s background and appearance. Lee recalled that he simply told the artist Gil Kane to &quot;make him bigger and stronger than the Hulk and we&#x27;ll have a lot of fun with him&quot;.

Emil Blonsky first appeared in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot;, and was introduced as a KGB agent and spy who became the Abomination after deliberately exposing himself to a greater quantity of the same gamma radiation that transformed Bruce Banner into his alter ego the Hulk, using a machine Banner was planning on using to commit suicide. In his first appearance, Blonsky became a large scaly humanoid even stronger than the Hulk. In accordance with Lee&#x27;s wishes, the character defeated the Hulk in their first battle.

The character has been featured in a number of Marvel titles, gradually shifting from unthinking, savage brute, to master schemer, to tortured soul, and finally repentant villain and occasional defender of the weak, before being killed in battle by the Red Hulk.

==Fictional character biography==
Emil Blonsky was born in Zagreb (then part of Yugoslavia, now the capital and largest city of Croatia) and became a KGB agent who infiltrated an Air Force base in New Mexico where Dr. Bruce Banner was attempting to kill the Hulk through overexposure to gamma rays. Blonsky triggers Banner turning into the Hulk, subsequently becoming a hideous lizard-like creature himself.

The Abomination reappears when summoned by a coven of witches to briefly battle the cosmic hero the Silver Surfer and uses a Stranger&#x27;s technology to summon Thor and escape the Stranger&#x27;s laboratory world. Thor frees the Abomination and the other captives, but, on discovering they are all evil, uses his mystic hammer Mjolnir to time travel several hours into the past to undo his mistake. After defeating the Abomination and placing the Abomination in prison, Thor departs. When the Hulk is defeated by the alien Xeron the Star Slayer and brought aboard a space vessel, the Abomination is revealed to be First Mate of the alien crew. When the captain of the vessel directs Xeron and the crew to battle a creature in space, the Hulk and the Abomination are thrown from the vessel and battle until the pair are drawn into Earth&#x27;s orbit and separated.

It is revealed in flashback that the Abomination entered into a coma-like state upon impacting with Earth and is buried for two years. Revived by an off-course missile fired from Hulkbuster Base (under Ross&#x27;s jurisdiction), the Abomination joins forces with General Ross to defeat the Hulk, but is battered into submission by an angered Hulk. The Abomination reappears with fellow Hulk foe the Rhino, and the pair activates a gamma bomb at the Hulkbuster base in an attempt to destroy the Hulk. The Hulk&#x27;s companion of the time, Jim Wilson, deactivates the bomb and the Hulk tricks the villains during combat, forcing them to collide and knock each other unconscious. A comatose Abomination is eventually found by soldiers at Ross&#x27;s direction and has a miniature bomb implanted in his skull, being told to fight and defeat the Hulk or be killed. The Abomination tricks the Hulk into an alliance and betrays Ross by attempting to ransom the captured Kennedy Space Center. The plan fails when the Hulk turns on the Abomination and the pair fight, with the Abomination being caught on a rocket when it explodes.

An illusion of the Abomination also appears with illusions of other Hulk foes when the Hulk (at the time possessing the intelligence of Banner, thanks to a device called the Encephalo-Helmet) enters Glenn Talbot&#x27;s brain at microscopic size to excise a mental block placed in Talbot&#x27;s mind by the Gremlin.

The Abomination eventually reappears as a servant of the alien entity the Galaxy Master, having been empowered with even greater strength. After another extended battle with the Hulk, the Hulk attacks and destroys the Galaxy Master, causing the Abomination to weaken and apparently become lost in space. When MODOK invades Hulkbuster Base, he colludes with General Ross to revive the Abomination, who was found in a block of ice above Earth and kept in cryogenic storage for further study. MODOK intends to use the Abomination against his superiors at A.I.M., while Ross wants to use him to destroy the Hulk. The Abomination, however, has become afraid of the Hulk as a result of their past battles and has to be mentally forced by MODOK to even &quot;fight&quot; the Hulk. MODOK, however, is ousted by A.I.M., and a hesitant Abomination is beaten by the Hulk when he intervenes to save Banner&#x27;s laboratory assistant. The Abomination refuses to rejoin the fight, and is disintegrated by MODOK.

During the &quot;Secret Wars II&quot; storyline, the Abomination is restored by the demon-lord Mephisto, who directs the Abomination and other villains against the cosmic entity the Beyonder as a member of the Legion Accursed.

The restoration is temporary, as a still-disembodied Abomination&#x27;s atoms mingle with the disembodied atoms of the villain Tyrannus, who reintegrates the Abomination&#x27;s body and places it under his mind&#x27;s control. Tyrannus, as the Abomination, then comes into conflict with the Gray Hulk, and quickly defeats the weaker version of their foe. When the Hulk reverts to Banner, Tyrannus forces him to create a procedure that will remove Blonsky&#x27;s mind, who is mentally fighting Tyrannus&#x27; mind for control of the Abomination&#x27;s body. The process is successful and Blonksy is restored to his human form, free of Tyrannus, whose mind is still occupying the form of the Abomination. An enraged Gray Hulk defeats Tyrannus, who is placed into custody by the organization S.H.I.E.L.D.

After encounters against Avengers Wonder Man and Hawkeye, the Tyrannus-controlled Abomination reappears during the &quot;Atlantis Attacks&quot; storyline with the Deviant Ghaur freeing Tyrannus from the body of the Abomination by restoring Tyrannus&#x27; mind to a duplicate of his own body and placing Blonsky&#x27;s mind within the Abomination&#x27;s body once more. The process drives Blonksy insane, and he battles heroes Spider-Man and the She-Hulk, managing to knock both unconscious. The Abomination is eventually driven off when set on fire by the She-Hulk. The Abomination&#x27;s mental faculties eventually return and the Abomination reappears in the &quot;Countdown&quot; storyline as a pawn of another Hulk foe, the Leader. The Abomination is sent to a toxic waste site to collect samples and encounters the gray version of the Hulk again, who is outmatched and also weak due to being poisoned. The Hulk, however, throws the Abomination into toxic waste that partially dissolves and horribly scars the Abomination.

The Abomination temporarily teams with villains Titania and Gargantua and finds and stalks his former wife, Nadia (a famous ballet dancer). The Abomination captures her and after taking her into the New York City sewers, reveals his true identity. After a brief skirmish, the Hulk persuades the Abomination to free his wife.

The Abomination is also captured by the robot Sentinels, but is eventually freed by the X-Men.

After befriending a woman who finds her way into the sewers, the Abomination battles Namor the Sub-Mariner during an attempt to save his kidnapped former wife. The Abomination retaliates against the NYPD when the Police Commissioner orders the sewers be cleared of all homeless, who the Abomination has placed under his protection. After killing several police officers, he is eventually driven away when confronted by the Hulk. The Abomination battles the mutant Nate Grey (who is searching the sewers for his lover and fellow mutant Threnody, who had been one of the homeless followers of the Abomination), who uses his mental abilities to trick the Abomination in thinking that he defeated Grey. He battles a delusional Hulk before encountering the Angel when the mutant visits the sewers in which he was once captured and maimed during the &quot;Fall of the Mutants&quot; storyline.

When Betty Ross dies in the title &quot;Hulk&quot;, Banner mistakenly thinks her proximity to the Hulk has induced a fatal case of radiation poisoning. Using a gamma device, a vindictive General Ross tracks what he believes to be the Hulk to a destroyed town, where the Abomination reveals he was the true culprit. Despite baiting a newly arrived Hulk, the Abomination is unable to force the Hulk to fight and departs.

The circumstances of Betty&#x27;s death are eventually revealed: Blonksy&#x27;s transformation into the Abomination apparently alienates his former wife Nadia, driving his hatred of Banner; Blonsky, deciding to deprive Banner of Betty in return, secretly poisons her with his radioactive blood. After hearing the Abomination&#x27;s admission, Banner eventually discovers the truth and the Hulk defeats the Abomination in a battle. Taken into custody by the military, Blonsky is forced to watch old home movies of him and his wife together (prior to his transformation) as punishment. Operatives from a secret organization &quot;Home Base&quot; eventually release the Abomination to battle the Hulk, and although able to taunt the Hulk about Betty&#x27;s murder, he is defeated once again. This encounter is later revealed to be a dream generated by Nightmare in an effort to torture the Hulk.

Blonsky had a humorous encounter with the demigod Hercules, in which he was chosen as an adversary for the hero while he completes the modern version of the 12 Labours of Hercules. The Abomination is also a conflicted opponent for the heroine the She-Hulk (currently employed by the spy organization S.H.I.E.L.D.). The Abomination has a subtle but significant role in the &quot;World War Hulk&quot; storyline, being the source of gamma-irradiated DNA that allows the creation of an anti-Hulk response team.

The Abomination reappears after the events of &quot;World War Hulk&quot;, encountering a new foe called the Red Hulk. This new opponent savagely beats, shoots, and kills the Abomination. Later on, it is revealed that the Abomination&#x27;s killer, the Red Hulk, is actually General Ross&#x27;s gamma-powered alter ego; he killed Blonsky as an act of revenge for his deliberate gamma poisoning (and later death) of Ross&#x27;s daughter Betty.

During the &quot;Dark Reign&quot; storyline, the Abomination is among the dead characters present at Zeus&#x27;s trial. Abomination reappears in the court of Pluto, attacking the Olympian god when he loses power over the dead.

During the &quot;Chaos War&quot; storyline, the Abomination is among the dead characters in the Underworld that Pluto liberated to help defend the Underworld from Amatsu-Mikaboshi. The Abomination fights the Hulk and his allies until Marlo Chandler taps into the Death essence within her to destroy his undead body.

A shadow organization (later revealed to be the Order of the Shield) bent on gaining control of the Hulk harvests biological material from a mortally wounded Bruce Banner. After Banner regains consciousness following the experiment and escapes as the Hulk, the organization uses this material to resurrect the Abomination under their control, leaving him &quot;free of a mind or a conscience&quot; and with an ability to seek out Banner/the Hulk for retrieval. The Hulk defeats the Abomination yet again with the aid of the Avengers. Iron Man uses technology taken from the Order of the Shield agents to teleport the Abomination into interplanetary space estimated to be &quot;somewhere in the vicinity of Jupiter&quot;.

Tissue samples of the Abomination were later used by the U.S. Hulk Operations to graft to the corpse of Rick Jones that revives him as an Abomination/A-Bomb-like creature that Dr. Charlene McGowan calls Subject B. After ripping Rick Jones from Subject B&#x27;s body in a brutal battle, Hulk Operations Commanding Officer General Reginald Fortean teleports to Gamma Flight Headquarters in space, killing Sasquatch and temporarily killing Doc Samson to retrieve the Subject B husk. Fortean then willingly fuses himself with the body.

After returning to Earth, Abomination started his own company called Green Spring which makes gamma mutates. After finding a depowered Skaar, Abomination had him repowered and sent him to retrieve Stockpile. After Skaar&#x27;s mission led to his encounter with Gamma Flight and the U.S. Hulkbuster Force, Abomination and Dr. Aliana Alba were shown to have watched the fight and commented on the powers of the gamma mutates that was shown off.

During the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Reign&quot; storyline, Abomination appears as a member of the Thunderbolts and shows up to stop Jessica Jones and the Champions from interfering in the Thunderbolts&#x27; apprehension of most of the Purple Children. As Jessica notes that Abomination would not normally be someone to work for Mayor Wilson Fisk, Abomination states that Mayor Fisk has the information that he seeks. The recruitment of Abomination was the result of Rhino leaving the group as he crossed the line of hunting children.

==Powers and abilities==
The Abomination is similar to the Hulk in terms of strength, stamina, speed, and durability, including his healing factor. In contrast with the Hulk, he retains his intellect after transforming and cannot change back into human form. He also possesses gills, enabling him to breathe underwater, and can enter suspended animation at will. Unlike the Hulk, his strength does not increase/decrease in proportion to level of rage.

After being empowered by Amatsu-Mikaboshi, Abomination becomes undead and gains the ability to generate hellfire. Additionally, he can manipulate his gamma energy to poison others.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;IGN&quot; ranked Abomination 54th in their &quot;Top 100 Comic Book Villains&quot; list, writing, &quot;When you have a character built up to be as incredibly (forgive the term) strong as the Hulk, it becomes nearly impossible to give him a credible threat. Enter the Abomination - created, for all intents and purposes, as the evil version of the Hulk,&quot; and ranked him 24th in their &quot;Top 25 Marvel Villains&quot; list. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; included Abomination in their &quot;15 Most Powerful She-Hulk Villains&quot; list, and in their &quot;10 Most Powerful Wonder Man Villains In Marvel Comics&quot; list, and ranked him 3rd in their &quot;Hulk&#x27;s Main Comic Book Villains, Ranked Lamest To Coolest&quot; list, 4th in their &quot;10 Most Powerful Hulk Villains In Marvel Comics&quot; list. &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Abomination 2nd in their &quot; Definitive Ranking Of The Hulk&#x27;s 20 Most Powerful Enemies&quot; list, 3rd in their &quot;Hulk&#x27;s 10 Most Powerful Villains&quot; list, 6th in their &quot;10 Most Violent Marvel Villains&quot; list, and 19th in their &quot;Marvel&#x27;s 20 Strongest Villains&quot; list.

Wanting to relive his glory days, Blonsky volunteers to be injected with a sample of an imperfect Super Soldier Serum. While it increases his physical capabilities to superhuman levels, it leaves Blonsky power-hungry and eventually drives him to seek out Dr. Samuel Sterns and be injected with some of Bruce Banner&#x27;s blood. Blonsky is mutated into a monstrous &quot;abomination&quot;, according to Sterns, and runs amok, destroying Harlem before he is defeated by the Hulk and handed over to General Ross.
* Blonsky appears in the Marvel One-Shot short film &quot;The Consultant&quot; via archive footage. S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Phil Coulson and Jasper Sitwell meet to discuss their director, Nick Fury, disagreeing with the World Security Council&#x27;s attempts to exonerate Blonsky and put him on the Avengers Initiative and formulate a plan to help Fury.

He becomes a client and friend of Jennifer Walters, who agrees to defend him in court after hearing his plea and receiving Banner&#x27;s blessing. Despite footage of his fight with Wong being leaked, Blonsky is successfully paroled on the condition that he wear an inhibitor to negate his transformations. He later opens a spiritual retreat called Summer Twilights and violates his parole to attend an Intelligencia event as a motivational speaker.

<text>The Starjammers are a fictional team of space pirates appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The Starjammers have often appeared in pages of the &quot;X-Men&quot; comic books. The Starjammers first appeared in &quot;X-Men&quot; #104 (April 1977) and were created by Dave Cockrum. The name &quot;Starjammers&quot; was created on the basis of the type of sailing ship known as &quot;Windjammer&quot;.

==Concept and creation==
Dave Cockrum created the Starjammers with the intent of having them star in their own series. However, when he submitted the concept for Marvel&#x27;s two try-out series, &quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot; and &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot;, he was repeatedly informed that these series were booked for two years solid. Cockrum showed the Starjammers to &quot;X-Men&quot; writer Chris Claremont and convinced him to use the characters for this series. In order to provide a plausible excuse for the Starjammers to make repeat appearances in &quot;X-Men&quot;, they decided to make Corsair, the leader of the Starjammers, be the father of Cyclops, the leader of the X-Men.

==History==

===Origin===
The story of the Starjammers began with Christopher Summers, a military pilot returning with his family from a trip to Alaska. Without warning their plane was attacked. Chris&#x27;s wife, Katherine, strapped their two sons (Scott Summers and Alexander Summers, who later became the X-Men Cyclops and Havok) to their only parachute and pushed them out of the plane, saving their lives. The husband and wife were then teleported from their plane to the ship of an advanced alien race called the Shi&#x27;ar. This had been a zoological scouting mission to bring in a human specimen. They were brought before D&#x27;Ken, the then ruler of the Shi&#x27;ar Empire, who was immediately smitten with Katherine, making her his and sending her husband to the slave pits. Eventually, Christopher escaped and reached D&#x27;Ken&#x27;s private quarters to try to assassinate him. However, he was caught and punished by having his wife murdered before his eyes, and his unborn son cut out of her womb. His spirit broken, he was sent to a mining camp on another planet.
===Formation of the team===
While working in the mining camp, Christopher witnessed the guards mercilessly beating a feline-like female. He stepped in, trying to get them to stop, but was then beaten himself. The woman was taken to the holding cells and Christopher huddled up in a corner, ashamed of himself. A little while later, Raza and Ch&#x27;od passed by and asked Christopher for the whereabouts of their comrade Hepzibah. Christopher was too afraid to answer. After they had left, he felt guilty and went to the guards&#x27; quarters, starting a fight after killing one of them. Raza and Ch&#x27;od jumped in, and together they got past the guards, freed the cat-woman, and sneaked on board a Shi&#x27;ar starship. Christopher used his pilot call-sign, Corsair. Naming Christopher their captain, they became the Starjammers, a group of space pirates rebelling against D&#x27;Ken&#x27;s tyranny.

===Further adventures===
The Starjammers have had many adventures across the universe, many of them on Earth with the X-Men, during which Christopher Summers finally met his long lost sons, now X-Men. At times, the group ran with Professor X and even his consort, the Shi&#x27;ar ruler, Lilandra. The group participated in the defeat of the cosmic threat Magus, assisted by Professor X and the New Mutants. When the Skrulls made an incursion into Shi&#x27;ar territory, the Starjammers were overwhelmed, kidnapped and duplicated. They were later rescued from their imprisonment by the X-Men.

The Hulk and Silver Surfer recruited the Starjammers to assist in a raid on Troyjan held space, to rescue several friends of the Hulk. A violent fight broke out, with the Starjammers slaying several enemies. It was ended with an alien bureaucrat offered the option of the Starjammers and allies simply asking to see the person they wished to confront. The group was also temporary allies of the Avengers. For some time, they were prisoners of the Collector, a cosmic being interested in preserving unique specimens of life. They became trapped in a conflict between the Collector, Galactus and the well-meaning but dangerous efforts of Wolverine of the X-Men.

A recent &quot;Starjammers&quot; series introduced a new member of the Starjammers. Although some readers believed it was out of Marvel Universe continuity, the events of the series were referenced in a recent entry in the &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot; series, confirming its canonical status.

===The Rise and Fall of the Shi&#x27;ar Empire===

The Starjammers figured significantly in the &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; story arc &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Shi&#x27;ar Empire&quot;, a 12-issue story arc following on the events of &quot;X-Men: Deadly Genesis&quot;.

Within this story arc, the long-lost third son of Corsair, Gabriel Summers, now the powerful mutant known as Vulcan, travels from Earth to Shi&#x27;ar space seeking revenge against the mad emperor D&#x27;Ken and the Shi&#x27;ar empire for the death of his mother and his own mistreatment by the Shi&#x27;ar. Through the course of the story, Vulcan allies himself with Deathbird to depose her brother the emperor, but later seems to side himself with D&#x27;Ken against the X-Men and the Starjammers, who seek to stop his plans for revenge. Vulcan soon turns on and kills D&#x27;Ken, and by marrying his ally (and sister of D&#x27;Ken) Deathbird, assumes the throne of the Shi&#x27;ar empire himself. In the course of the finale, Corsair, Vulcan&#x27;s father, is seemingly killed. Hepzibah is returned to Earth with the X-Men, while Havok, Polaris and Marvel Girl remain behind. Havok decides to assume his father&#x27;s position as leader of the Starjammers. Polaris opts to stay with him. Marvel Girl remains behind as well, having developed an intimate relationship with Korvus, a Shi&#x27;ar warrior whose ancestor was once a host of the Phoenix force (like Marvel Girl); his giant sword allows him to access the force to a degree as well. The Starjammers&#x27; new mission is to defeat Havok&#x27;s brother and return Lilandra to the throne of the Sh&#x27;iar Empire.

Hepzibah expresses no wish to return to the Starjammers following Corsair&#x27;s death, and has decided to stay on Earth and become an X-Man. The Starjammers are now: Havok, Polaris, Ch&#x27;od, Marvel Girl, Raza, Korvus, Sikorsky, and Cr&#x27;eee.

The further adventures of the Starjammers are continued in the series: &quot;X-Men: Emperor Vulcan&quot;, this miniseries (5 issues) is written by Chris Yost and pencilled by Paco Diaz. Havok and the Starjammers attack Shi&#x27;ar space. Vulcan appears with an armada to kill them, and a new alien race gets involved. The new race&#x27;s name translates to &quot;Death to the Shi&#x27;ar&quot;, and they destroyed the Shi&#x27;ar flagship. In the aftermath of the miniseries, most of the Starjammers were captured and subsequently imprisoned by Vulcan. Lilandra, Korvus, and Rachel Summers escaped and remain free.

===&quot;X-Men: Kingbreaker&quot; and &quot;War of Kings&quot;===

Marvel has announced that the Starjammers will play a large role in the upcoming sequel to &quot;Emperor Vulcan&quot; called &quot;X-Men: Kingbreaker&quot;. They will also be seen prominently in the &quot;War of Kings&quot; storyline, which also features Vulcan, the Inhumans, Nova, and the Guardians of the Galaxy.

=== Poison X ===
When Chris was talking to Cyclops from the past, the Starjammers are attacked by mercenaries with symbiotes. The mercenaries wanted them so they could go to steal with the help of their navigator. The X-Men Blue team, with the help of a reluctant Venom, went to space so they could save the Starjammers. When the symbiotes bonded with the Starjammers, the X-Men went to the mercenaries&#x27; ship and Cyclops freed the team. While the symbiotes were battling amongst themselves, the Poisons arrived, consumed the mercenaries, and began attacking the X-Men since they themselves were now bonded to symbiotes. They survived and after escaping the Poisons and the X-Men gave their symbiotes to the Starjammers to return them to Klyntar.

=== Death of Thanos ===
In the aftermath of the &quot;Infinity Wars&quot; storyline, the Starjammers were present at Thanos&#x27; funeral. Starfox shows all the guests a recording of Thanos stating that he uploaded his consciousness in a new body before his death. The funeral is attacked by the Black Order, who steals Thanos&#x27;s body and rip open a black hole in space, sending everyone into the rip. Though Silver Surfer was able to rescue the Starjammers with the cost of his own wellbeing, everyone else were still trapped. Everyone is saved by the arrival of Gladiator and the Shi&#x27;ar Empire.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
In this reality, the formation of the Starjammers is essentially the same as in the main reality. They consisted of slaves that broke free during the reign of Emperor D&#x27;Ken. They included Earthman Christopher Summers, Ch&#x27;od, Hepzibah, and Raza Longknife. Early on in their time together, Chris was infected with a Brood embryo and would return to Earth leaving the Starjammers without a leader; however, the circumstances behind this would be unrevealed.

The Starjammers would eventually find someone who could lead them in the form of Deathbird, the former ruler of the Shi&#x27;ar Empire, who had been removed from the throne by her evil brother D&#x27;Ken. When the X-Ternals arrived in the Shi&#x27;ar galaxy, they were saved by the Starjammers from the crystallization wave caused by the destabilized M&#x27;Kraan Crystal.

The group took the X-Ternals to the planet where the Crystal was kept so that they could collect a shard of it to save the universe. Only Deathbird would accompany the X-Ternals to the planets surface where their mission would be a success. It would also see D&#x27;Ken left in a paralyzed state, trapped within the crystal.

===Mutant X===
In this reality, the Starjammers consist of Cyclops, Binary, Lockheed, Nova, and Silver Surfer.

==In other media==

===Television===
The Starjammers appeared in the &quot;X-Men&quot; episodes &quot;The Phoenix Saga&quot; and &quot;Orphan&#x27;s End&quot;.

<text>Shelter is a registered charity that campaigns for housing justice in England and Scotland. It gives advice, information, and advocacy to people and campaigns, and lobbies government and local authorities for new laws and policies. It works in partnership with Shelter Cymru in Wales and the Housing Rights Service in Northern Ireland. The charity was founded in 1966 and raised 75.2 million pounds in 2022/23.

Shelter helps people in housing need by providing advice and practical assistance, and campaigns for better investment in housing and for laws and policies to improve the lives of homeless and badly housed people.

==History==
Shelter was launched on 1 December 1966, evolving out of the work on behalf of homeless people then being carried on in Notting Hill in London. The launch of Shelter hugely benefited from the coincidental screening, in November 1966, of the BBC television play &quot;Cathy Come Home&quot; ten days before Shelter&#x27;s launch. It was written by Jeremy Sandford and directed by Ken Loach – and highlighted the plight of the homeless in Britain. Shelter was set up by the Rev Bruce Kenrick after forming the Notting Hill Housing Trust in 1963. The social campaigner Des Wilson, having seen &quot;Cathy Come Home&quot;, became pivotal in the development of Shelter. Bishop Eamon Casey was also a founder of Shelter while chaplain to Irish diaspora in London.

In 2008, Shelter saw strike action by its staff in response to changes being made to their terms and conditions. Another dispute, this time over pay, occurred in 2022 prompting a two-week strike.

==Financial information==
For the year ended March 2017 (England) 
*Total incoming resources: £60,902,000
*Total expenditure: £62,874,000
*Fundraising costs: £18,852,000
*Total cost of charitable activities: £44,022,000

===Sources of funding===
*Donations and legacies 54%
*Housing advice and support services 29%
*Shelter shops 14%
*Training and publications 2%
*Other 1%
An annual charity fundraising event called Vertical Rush takes place inside London&#x27;s Tower 42. It is a vertical run of 932 steps to the top of the tower. The 2024 event, raising money for Shelter, took place on 28 February.

<text>Death-Stalker is the name of two fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

==Philip Sterling==

===Publication history===
The first Death-Stalker was Philip Wallace Sterling. An enemy of Daredevil, he first appeared as the Exterminator in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #39 (April 1968); he first appeared as Death-Stalker in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #113 (September 1974).

===Fictional character biography===
Philip Wallace Sterling was born in Riverdale, Bronx, New York. He was a wealthy man prior to embarking on a career as a professional criminal. When he first appeared as the Exterminator, he recruited the Unholy Three. He constructed a &quot;time displacer ray&quot; (&quot;t-ray&quot;) which could teleport its target into another dimension (possibly the Limbo from which Immortus hails). The Exterminator led the Unholy Three in a series of criminal activities and battled Daredevil. When Daredevil defeated the Exterminator and his agents, he also destroyed the t-ray, accidentally bombarding the Exterminator with its strange energy and seemingly killing him.

Sterling found himself trapped between two dimensions, able to return to Earth at will but only for a few hours at a time; furthermore, the mutation caused his skin to become chalk-white. He stole a pair of gloves from AIM that gave him a &quot;death-grip,&quot; and began calling himself &quot;Death-Stalker.&quot; He tried several times to kill Daredevil and build a new t-ray machine, but most of his battles with Daredevil ended in a draw.

He was allied with Gladiator against Daredevil. Death-Stalker traveled to the Florida Everglades in search of papers relating to Ted Sallis&#x27; experiments and encountered the Man-Thing. He later stole a set of ancient Lemurian mirror lenses from various museums and used them to create a powerful gun in order to destroy Daredevil. However, Daredevil destroyed the gun, and in the midst of their battle, Death-Stalker was mysteriously discorporated by the Sky-Walker. He reappeared in a third costumed guise as the second Death&#x27;s-Head, gifting an enforcer called Smasher with superhuman strength and kidnapping Karen Page in order to force her to give him the original Death&#x27;s Head&#x27;s research. He was defeated by Daredevil and the Ghost Rider, killing Smasher with his touch during the battle.

Sterling resumed the Death-Stalker identity and assembled a large gathering of criminals to take part in an undisclosed theft, presumably of t-ray components. Daredevil found out about the gathering and in the resulting confrontation Death-Stalker touched (and thus killed) one of his underlings, frightening the others away. Seeing no point in battling Daredevil at this time, he teleported away. Angered at this latest interference with his plans, he created another Smasher and sent him to kill Daredevil. The new Smasher failed and Daredevil refused to imprison him, knowing that Death-Stalker would have entered the prison and killed him for his failure. Turning to a new plan, he stole a newly developed scientific apparatus from Stark International.

Death-Stalker attempted to kill Daredevil while the crime-fighter was hospitalized, but was stopped by the Avengers. He created a new Unholy Three and had them kidnap Matt Murdock, whose secret identity as Daredevil he had learned by observation from between dimensions. Daredevil was taken to St. Stephens Cemetery, where Death-Stalker killed two of the Unholy Three and attacked Daredevil. Unable to overcome Death-Stalker&#x27;s superior abilities, Daredevil knocked out the nearby street light, thus enclosing the cemetery in darkness. Fighting blindly, Death-Stalker rematerialized while his body was phasing through a tombstone, which killed him instantly.

Death-Stalker was, for a brief time, survived by his mother, Elizabeth Dawes Sterling. Lying on her deathbed, and in her hatred for Daredevil for the death of her son, she had her house converted into a deathtrap and built childlike androids fitted with self-destruct devices constructed to lure him to his demise. However, Daredevil just barely managed to escape her deadly revenge.

===Powers and abilities===
Accidental exposure to an overdose of &quot;t-radiation&quot; altered Sterling&#x27;s physiology, making it so that he normally existed in a dimension congruent to Earth. While in this realm, he could watch and listen to events on Earth without being observed from Earth by any means. By willing himself to do so, he could shift into the Earth dimension to varying degrees. He could become visible but intangible, or visible and tangible as he desired. He could shift from one state to the other instantaneously. Also, while completely in his interdimensional state, he could cover distances more rapidly, enabling him to disappear from one Earth location and reappear at another far sooner than if he had traversed that same distance on Earth. Death-Stalker could not continuously manifest in the dimension of Earth for more than several hours at a time. His &quot;cybernetic death-grip&quot; device, stolen from AIM, was worn in his gloves, which emitted a dose of microwave radiation when activated by mental command, crippling or killing (depending on the duration of contact) any living creature who came into contact with it. This self-described &quot;touch of death&quot; energy has been described as microwaves, but seems to have properties of both lightning and truly intense cold. Death-Stalker, however, had to materialize tangibly, and in full, on Earth for the device to be effective—a &quot;lone weakness&quot; which Daredevil learned he could exploit to attack Sterling. All in all, Philip Wallace Sterling was a brilliant criminal mastermind—running a global &quot;espionage syndicate&quot;—in addition to being an accomplished inventor and scientist with extensive knowledge of advanced scientific apparatus.

==Death-Stalker (Villains for Hire)==
===Fictional character biography===
A new Death-Stalker appeared in the first issue of &quot;Villains for Hire&quot; (the villain counterpart of Heroes for Hire). This Death-Stalker&#x27;s true identity is unknown. She is among the villains hired by Purple Man to help him start his new criminal empire. Death-Stalker was almost shot in the head by Crossfire and shrugs to him by stating &quot;you can&#x27;t kill what is already dead.&quot; Death-Stalker later survives the explosion of the boat she was on.

===Powers and abilities===
The second Death-Stalker can teleport and has a microwave &quot;death grip.&quot;

<text>The Ace was an American-assembled car made in Ypsilanti, Michigan by the Apex Motor Car Company, which was reorganized as the Apex Motor Corporation in 1921. The initial batch of cars assembled was sent to Seattle, Washington dealer F. E. Earnest, who had the idea for the Ace after he was unable to secure a steady supply of new cars for his dealership.

The most interesting feature of the Ace was the Guy Disc-Valve motor, created by engineer Fred M. Guy, and Otto W. Heinz. Initially, it was prepared as a four-cylinder engine for production in the Hackett, but the company folded before it was ready.

In April, 1921, Guy and Heinz left the Apex Motor Corporation, with the support of Apex, to found the Guy Disc Valve Motor Co. in Ypsilanti. In mid-1921, a Model H tourer with a conventional Herschell-Spillman straight-6 was added, with a selling price of $2,000. The man at the helm at Apex was by now Harry T. Hanover. In 1922, the Guy engine was gone. The Model F Pup was added to the range, fitted with a conventional 4-cylinder Gray-Bell engine, and priced at $1295. It was sold beside the Model L Scout with a smaller than previous Hershell-Spillmann straight-six engine, and the new top-of-the-line Model C Combat with a 340 c.i. Continental Six engine. The sixes ranged in price from $2260 to $3150.

Most Ace cars were tourings, with a few roadsters, and a 4/5 passenger coupe-sedan with a custom-built look. The Combat line also included an attractive speedster in the Kissel Gold Bug pattern.

Apex was initially involved in the Diamond Cab project, which also included Gray Motor Corp., and Guy Disc Valve Motor Co. Within a few months, these plans became obsolete as Diamond Cab got new owners, resulting in the cab built by Elcar, and another cab built by the Driggs Ordnance &amp; Manufacturing Corp.

Ace automobile production ended with the 1922 model year. Total production was 256 cars.
Apex Corp. was sold to the American Motor Truck Company in Newark, Ohio, in 1922. For a short time, Apex built bus bodies here, but soon closed forever.

== Ace model overview ==

The 1921 Model L and 1922 35-70 are mentioned by a single source. While the L appears a smaller companion to the Model H, the 35-70 possibly was nothing more than a renamed 1920 Model H Coupe-Sedan.

There is no existing Ace automobile known, however the Ypsilanti Automotive Heritage Museum offered a $5000 reward for evidence that directs to such a car. Although the museum continues to search for a surviving Ace, the reward expired in 2003 with the death of museum co-founder Skip Ungrodt.

<doc id="850485" wikidata="Q6024180" url="?curid=850485" title="Indians of Canada Pavilion">
<text>The Indians of Canada Pavilion was a pavilion at the 1967 International and Universal Exposition in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

The Pavilion, constructed as a temporary structure for public exhibition at Expo 67, contained works of Indigenous art and culture alongside historical and political commentary concerning the past and present issues facing the Indigenous Peoples in Canada. Organizers consulted with Indigenous leaders and advisors to create the narrative and content exhibited within the pavilion, content which proved to be unexpectedly provocative and controversial by both the Government of Canada and the general public. The exhibits emphasized an Indigenous view of history, which stressed the role the non-Indigenous Canadians and the Canadian Government played in the suppression of Indigenous culture and values, the assimilation of Indigenous children in government funded residential schools, and the history of colonialism and the impact of the doctrine of discovery on the lives Indigenous people from contact to the present day.

== Exhibits and central theme ==
The Contents of the Exhibits were intended to reflect the Indigenous people&#x27;s answer to the question: &quot;What do you want to tell the people of Canada and the World when they come to Expo in 1967?&quot;. Their answer can be found in the central theme of the pavilion, which was &quot;the struggle of the Indian to accept a modern technological society with its mass culture while preserving his identity, his personal integrity, and the moral and spiritual values of his fathers&quot;.

One of the methods by which this theme was expressed was through an ever present display of narrative text that led visitors through a variety of themed sections. Examples include &quot;When the White Man Came We Welcomed Him With Love&quot; and &quot;The great explorers of Canada traveled in Indian canoes, wore Indian snow-shoes, ate Indian food, lived in Indian houses. They could not have lived or moved without Indian friends&quot;. Both messages were present in the Pavilion&#x27;s reception area.

Visitors were led past examples of Indigenous art and artifacts such a very large exterior Totem Pole, birch bark canoes, rawhide snowshoes, sculpture, murals and drawings by Indigenous artists such as Alex Janvier, Noel Wuttunee and Norval Morrisseau, and traditional clothing and beadwork, as well as images of pertinent documents such as the Royal Proclamation of 1763, and several crown Treaties.

A section near the end of the pathway through the pavilion contained photographs of indigenous people in modern occupations such as tradesman, craftsmen and farmers, markedly more upbeat than previous exhibits. This section was designed by a branch of Indian Affairs.

The final section contained a large space with a central imitation fire pit that invited visitors to sit and reflect upon the future of Indigenous people of Canada.

The experience of visitors was managed by thirteen Indigenous women, hired from a selection of 220 applicants by Expo organizers, to act as hostesses to guide and interpret the exhibits for those unfamiliar with Indigenous culture. The Indigenous women represented the Siksika, Haisla, Haida, Mi&#x27;kmaq, Ojibwa, Mohawk, Innu, and Nlaka&#x27;pamux First Nations, among others.

One of principal organizers of the Indian Pavilion was Noel Wuttunee, a Cree artist from Red Pheasant Cree Nation who worked with lawyer and national president William Wuttunee of the National Indian Council to ensure that a different story of Canada was told.

== Response and media reaction ==
Reactions to the exhibits present in the Pavilion from the government, the public and the press ranged from outrage and shock to acceptance and accolade.

Many mainstream journalists critical of the pavilion reacted to the threat the message of the pavilion posed to Canadian Nationalism by criticizing the government for allowing itself to be humiliated. An article in the Toronto Star described the exhibits as an &quot;embarrassment to the Government of Canada.&quot;. The Globe and Mail and other newspapers complained that &quot;Ottawa footed the bill&quot; to embarrass itself. An article in the Montreal Star suggest that &quot;the pavilion may raise some hackles in government circles&quot;. Other journalists took a different tack, claiming that the Pavilion was a &quot;dig at the white man&quot;.

Positive reaction by the mainstream press was more commonplace. Some outlets considered the pavilion thought provoking, While others congratulated the Indigenous people for letting &quot;the Indians to tell their own story in their own way,&quot; while reflecting that the &quot;bitterness with the past is justified&quot;. A report from the Guelph Mercury summarizes the positive response by the mainstream media well:&quot;…it is encouraging that the Indians themselves have used this opportunity in this way to dramatize their condition. It is an indication of a new spirit of determination and independence that has for too long been missing. The Indian pavilion at Expo ought to challenge the conscience of every white Canadian who sees it.&quot;Reaction by Indigenous peoples was nuanced. One Indigenous leader thought the pavilion was a &quot;True reflection of the Indian&#x27;s spirit of dignity&quot;. While the then director of the National Congress of American Indians was impressed with the fact that &quot;Canadian Indians may be 50 to 75 years behind [American Indians] in our relations with the federal government&quot;.
