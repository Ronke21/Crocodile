<text>The Magars, also spelled Mangar and Mongar, are a Tibeto-Burman ethnic group native to Nepal and Northeast India, representing 6.9% of Nepal&#x27;s total population according to the 2021 Nepal census. They are one of the main Gurkha tribes.

The first home of the Magars was to the west of the Gandaki River and, roughly speaking, consisted of that portion of Nepal which lies between and around about Gulmi, Arghakhanchi, and Palpa.
This part of the country was divided into twelve districts known as &quot;Bahra Magarat&quot; (Confederation of Twelve Magar villages), which included the following regions of that period: Argha, Khanchi, Bhirkot, Dhor, Garhung, Ghiring, Gulmi, Isma, Musikot, Rising, Satung, and Pyung.
During the medieval period, the whole area from Palpa to Rukum Rolpa was called the Magarat, a place settled and inhabited by Magars.
Another confederation of eighteen Magar kingdoms, known as &quot;Athara Magarat&quot;, also existed and was originally inhabited by Kham Magars.

=== India, United Kingdom and other countries ===
Magars are scattered throughout the cities of India in Darjeeling, Sikkim, Assam and many others. The Gurkha recruitment in the Indian Gorkha Regiment, British Gurkha Regiment and the Gurkha Contingent of Singapore Police gave a huge opportunity to the hard working Magars of the hills to work and live abroad in countries like the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, India and Myanmar. A significant number of Magar population can also be found in countries like the United Arab Emirates, Japan, Australia, Saudi Arabia, the United States of America and South Korea.

==Origin==
There are several mythical stories describing the origins of the Magars.

The Magar of the Bahra Magarat east of the Kali Gandaki River are said to have originated in the land of Seem. Two brothers, Seem Magar and Chintoo Magar, fought, and one remained in Seem, while the other left, ending up in Kangwachen, southern Sikkim. The Bhutia people lived at the northern end of this region. Over time, the Magars became very powerful and made the northern Bhutia their vassals. Sintoo Sati Sheng ruled in a very despotic manner, and the Bhutia conspired to assassinate him. Sheng&#x27;s queen took revenge and poisoned 1,000 Bhutia people at a place now called Tong Song Fong, meaning &quot;where a thousand were murdered&quot;. The Bhutia later drove the Magars out, forcing them to again migrate further south. As part of this migration, one group migrated to Simrongadh, one group moved towards the Okhaldhunga region, and another group seems to have returned to the east. No dates are given.

The origins of the Kaike Magars end up with the mystical tales told and retold by local people. According to one of these stories, the Kaike Magars were the sons of a woman who had fled from an unspecified village of Kalyal kingdom. She subsequently gave birth to her child, a son. The boy, when he grew up, captured an angel while she was bathing with her friends. As time went by, the son and his angel bride had three sons. These sons were the ancestors of the Buddha, Roka, and Gharti clans. The origin of the fourth major clan is different. One of the three sons was a shepherd who kept losing the same female goat every day, so one day he followed her when she wandered away from the rest of the herd. He discovered that she was giving her milk to a baby boy living in the hollow part of a bamboo tree. He brought the baby home. This boy grew up and became the ancestor of the Jhankri clan. The language was called &quot;Kaike,&quot; meaning &quot;language of the Gods.&quot;

==History==
The first written history about the Magar people dates as far back as 1100 CE. The Magars are one of the oldest known tribes in Nepal. Their ancient homeland was known as &quot;Magwar Bisaya&quot;, later called Magarat.

Magarat bordered from Marsyangdi river to the Pyuthan area during that time. The Magars prospered at such a level during that period that this part of the country was divided into twelve kingdoms/thams (&quot;Barah&quot; &quot;Magarant or twelve magarat)&quot;—each under its own ruler—the members of each supposedly being of common extraction in the male line. Some records show these twelve areas as being Arghak, Khachi, Gulmi, Isma, Musikot, Ghiring, Rising, Bhirkot, Payung, Garhung, Dhor and Satung. Among them, the most powerful kings were those of Gulmi, Argha, Khachi. Broadly speaking, the twelve Magarat consisted of present-day Argha, Khanchi, Gulmi, Isma, Musikot, Ghiring, Baldengadhi, Rudrapurgadhi, Deuchuli, Tanahang/Tanu-hyula (Tanahu), Kanhu, Ligligkot, Gorkhakot, (Bahakot), Targhakot (Takukot), and Makawanpur areas. Similarly, Athara (eighteen) Magarat consisted of the following regions: Dhurkoi (Gulmi), Gharkoi (Arghakhachi), Paiya (Parbat), Sinkhang (Myagdi), Narikoi (Pyuthan), Balungbang (Pyuthan), Jangkoi (Rolpa), Rukumkoi (Rukum), Chhilikoi (Dang), Bhaba (Dailekh), Borekoi (Jajarkot), Tarakoi (Dolpa), Timarkoi (Jumla), Jural (Doti), Bunkot, Bahrakot, Lu Nanya (Dadeldhura) and Ru-pal (Dadeldhura).

The Magars of the middle and western regions also played an important role in Nepal&#x27;s formative history. Their kingdom was one of the strongest of west Nepal in and around Palpa District during the time of the 22 Baisi Rajya and 24 Chaubisi Rajya &quot; principalities (17th and early 18th centuries)&quot;. In the 16th century, Palpa ruler Mukunda Sen briefly invaded the Kathmandu valley. King Dalsur Ghale Magar (1604-1615 BS) was a king of Liglig-Kot until Dravya Shah captured LigligKot and became the king. Ganga Ram Rana Magar also helped Drabya Shah. Ligligkot is also considered the foundation of the Gorkha Kingdom and the foundation of our nation . After Dravya Shah captured LigligKot from Magar King Dalsur Ghale Magar, he captured Gorkhakot, the last Magarat area, from the Magar King, Mansingh Khadka Magar in BS 1616 Bhadra 25. In the kingdoms of Gorkha and Musikot, the Magars even seem to have taken part in their own initial defeat, revealing both the weakness of their ethnic solidarity at that time and the presence of clan rivalries. As mentioned in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal founded by Sir William Jones in 1784, the city of Gorkha was originally the residence of Chitoria (Chitorey) Magars, and the city was built by them. To this day, large numbers of Chitoria/Chitorey Magars are found in the Gorkha District. Additionally, in the Manakamana Temple located in Gorkha, it is mandatory for a priest to be a Magar; specifically, the priest must be a descendant of Saint Lakhan Thapa Magar, who is described as a spiritual guide for Ram Shah, and he had a very close relationship with the queen, who was considered an incarnation of the Goddess. Interestingly, the main priests of Kalika, the goddess protecting the kingdoms of Lamjung and Gorkha, were also Bohara Magars; it is striking to note how the Magars have been in charge of the religious functions linked to the very source of Thakuri power.

The 18th-century king, Prithvi Narayan Shah, the founder of the modern Kingdom of Nepal announced and loved to call himself &#x27; the King of Magarat&#x27; or &#x27;the King of Magar country&#x27;. According to Marie Lecomte-Tilouine, a senior researcher in Social Anthropology at the French National Center for Scientific Research, Prithvi Narayan Shah narrated in his autobiography about praying to a goddess whom he described as &#x27;the daughter of Rana [Magar]. During the time of King Prithvi Narayan, Rana Magars were one of the six-member courtiers (&quot;Tharghar&quot;). Prithvi Narayan Shah in his memories also recalls his Magar &quot;dada&quot;—the man who looked after him during his childhood.

The Scottish contemporary writer, Francis Buchanan-Hamilton, contends in his journal that the Shah dynasty was derived from the Magar tribe. He argues that: 

 He further contended on Shah family that: 

Many prominent historians of Nepal have claimed that Aramudi, an eighth-century ruler of the Kali Gandaki region, was a Magar King. &quot;Aramudi&quot; derives from the word for &#x27;river&#x27; in the Magar language. &#x27;Ari&#x27; – &#x27;Source of Water&#x27; + &#x27;Modi&#x27;– &#x27;River&#x27; = &#x27;Arimodi&#x27; or &#x27;Aramudi&#x27;, thus the literal meaning of Aramudi is a &quot;source of river&quot;. But due to the lack of historical evidence, there are some conflicting ideas among the historians.

Sen dynasty of Palpa were Magar Kings as per the hand-written treatise &#x27;Naradsmriti&#x27; and history books written in Sikkim. In a palm-leaf manuscript kept in the Kaiser Library, dated 1567 VS (1510), Mukunda Sen is described as a Magar king of Palpa who invaded the Kathmandu Valley in 1581 VS (1524). Thus, in the 17th century, Malla kings of Kathmandu valley were united to fight back the invasion of Magars from Palpa. One of Mukunda Sen&#x27;s wives was also the daughter of the Magar King of Parkogha: Mahadevi Suvarnamala, and she had four sons: Manishya Sen, Imbarsen, Kuvar and Lohang Sen. Similarly, Gajalaxman Singh, Magar King of Makvanpur, whose daughter Kantivati was married to Abhaya Sen (Magar King) of Palpa. From her was born the great king of kings Bhattarajadeva. Around 1700, the ruler of Baldeng (near present-day Butwal) was overthrown by Palpa and other &quot;chaubisi&quot; states, and he was supposedly a Magar king.

==Subdivisions==

Magars are divided into the following Eight tribes &quot;(clans)&quot; listed here in an alphabetical order: Ale, Budha/Budhathoki, Chitorey/Chitaurey, Gharti, Pun, Rana, Roka, Thapa. These tribes all intermarry with each other, have the same customs, and are in every way equal as regards to social standing. Each tribe is subdivided into many sub-clans.

===Ale Magars===

Arghali, Durungchung, Hiski, Hungchen, Limel, Pade, Rakhal, Suyal, Sirpali.

===Budhathoki / Budha Magars===

Gamal, Jugjali, Pahari, Thami, Arkali, Ulange, Karmani, Kosila, Gamal, Chini, Jiyali, Thami, Janjali, Darlasi, Deowal, Namjali, Pare, Pahare, Pojange, Barkabiri, Balkoti, Ramjali, Romkhami, Sinjali/Singjali, Jujali, Lamichhane, Khame, Doyal.

===Chitorey/Chitaurey===

Chitorey, Chitaurey

===Gharti Magars===

Dagami, Galami, Kalikotey, Pahari or Panre, Phagami, Rangu, Rawal, Rajali, Sawangi, Sene, Surai, Sinjapati, Sijapati, Talaji, Tirukia, Wale, Thini, Bhujel.

===Pun Magars===

Birkali, Baijali, Burduja, Paija, sain, Chochangi, Sinjali, Dut, Purja, Garbuja, Ramjali, Tilija, Armaja, Phungali, Sanangi, Sothi, Sutpahare, Khame, Khoroja, Thane, Tirke, Sabangi, Pahare, Gaura, Phagami/Fagami, Balali, Batha, Saureni, Sherpunja.

===Rana Magars===

Aachhami, Aslami, Bangling, Chumi, Gyangmi/Gyami, Kharka/Khadka, Kyapchaki/Kepchaki, Lungeli, Makkim, Maski, Marchu, Palli, Ruchal, Shrees, Surjabansi/Suryabangsi, Limel, Deuka, Jung, Fewali, Basista

===Roka Magars===

Jelbangi, Dununge, Ramjali, Bajhangi, Baijali.

===Thapa Magars===

To name a few – Āthaghare, Bagale, Bakabal, Bakheti, Baraghare, Birkatta, Kala, Kammu, Khapangi, Palunge, Puwar/Punwar, Sunari, Sāthighare, Sinjali/Singjali, Saplangi, Midun, Mugmi, Pulami, Darlami, Salami, Jarga, Dhenga, Taramu, Tarami, Tarangi, Tangnami, Byangnasi, Masrangi

Gaha Thapa consists of Bucha, Gora, khangaha/khanga.

Reshmi Thapa consists of Dangal.

Saru Thapa consists of Jhapurluk, Jhendi/Jhedi, Kala. Besides these, Gurbachan, Purbachhaney, Phounja, Chauhan, Pachabhaiya, Khamcha, Khandaluk, Ghale, Baral, Somai, Pithakote, Jhakote, Rakaskoti/Raskoti, Uchai, Samal.

In former days, any Thapa who had lost three generations of ancestors in battle became a Rana, but with the prefix of his Thapa clan. Thus, a Reshmi Thapa would become a Reshmi Rana. An instance of this is to be found in the 5th Gurkhas, where a &quot;havildar,&quot; Lachman Thapa, and a naik, Shamsher Rana, descended from the two Thapa [Magars] brothers; but three generations of descendants from one of these brothers having been killed in the battle, Shamsher Rana&#x27;s ancestors assumed the title of Rana while Lachman Thapa&#x27;s ancestors not having been killed in battle for three generations remained a Thapa. From this custom many Rana sub clans are said to have sprung up, and this would lead one to believe that the Rana-Magar clan was looked up to amongst the Magars.

The Rana clan of Magar tribes come from the same stock of Thapa, but when they were separated from their original group and lost for three generations, they settled in a place called lamjung and called themselves by the name of &quot;Rana&quot; which means chief in khas tradition and language. Thus, the inhabitants of Rana Magar became the lamjung village. The Matwala Khas are generally the progeny of a Khas of Western Nepal and karnali with a Magar woman of Western Nepal. If the woman happens to belong to the khas mixed Rana clan of the Magar tribe, progeny is then called a Bhat Rana. The &quot;Matwala Khas&quot; doesn&#x27;t wear the sacred thread. They eats pork and drinks alcohol, and in every way assimilates himself with the Magars. He invariably claims to be a matwali khas or pawai khas.

Linguistically, the Magars are divided into three groups. Baraha Magaratis speak Dhut dialect, whereas Athara Magaratis speak Pang and Kaike dialects.

Magar Dhut speakers: Rana, Ale, Thapa

Magar Kham speakers: Budhathoki, Pun, Roka, Gharti

Magar Kaike speakers: Tarali Magar of Dolpa; Budha, Gharti, Roka/Rokaya, Kayat, Jhakri all Magar clans residing in Dolpa and Karnali districts.

==Language and script==

Of the 2,013,498 Magar population in Nepal, about 810,315 speak Magar language as their mother tongue while the rest speak Nepali as their mother tongue. The western inhabitants of Nepal did not speak the language in the past. But recently, almost everyone has started learning the language. The Magar languages are rooted in the Bodic branch of the Tibetan family.

The Magar language, &quot;Magar Kura&quot;, is spoken in two major dialects and a number of sub dialects reflecting the geographic distribution of the group. The Western Magars of Rapti Zone speak Magar Kham language. In Dolpa District, Magars speak Magar Kaike language. Magar Dhut language speakers are all Magar clans residing in Twelve Magarat. Similarly Magar Kham language speakers are all Magar clans from Eighteen Magarat. Magar Kaike language speakers are all Magar clans in Karnali zone.

Magar Akkha or scripts are used in Sikkim as a Magar language script. Many scholars including MS Thapa have been in forefront to implement the Akkha script to write Magar language in Nepal. New generations have been learning it. Akkha script is said to be closely associated with Brahmi script.

==Religion==
As per Nepali census 79% of Magars follow Hinduism though there is high degree of syncretism with Buddhism, Animism and Ancestor Worship. Magars follow Buddhism and Hinduism. The original religions or beliefs of Magar people are Shamanism, Animism, Ancestor worship and northern Nepal&#x27;s Magar follow Shamanism.

Magars are the main priests of the famous Manakamana Temple in Gorkha District, Budha Subba Temple in Dharan and Alamdevi temple (Nepal&#x27;s former Shah Kings&#x27; mother Goddess or family deity) in Syangja District. In Manakamana Temple, specially, the priest must be a descendant of Saint Lakhan Thapa Magar, who is described as a spiritual guide for Ram Shah, and he had a very close relationship with the queen, who was considered an incarnation of the Goddess Durga Bhawani, an incarnation of Parvati. Similarly, Bhirkot, Gahraukot, Khilung, Nuwakot, Satahukot, Sarankot, Dhor, Lamjung, Gorkha Kalika, Salyankot Dhading also have Magar priests from Saru, Baral, Saru, Saru, Pulami, Chumi, Darlami, DudhrRana, Bhusal/Maski, Saru/Rana Magar clan respectively.

The main priests of Kalika, the goddess protecting the kingdoms of Lamjung and Gorkha, were also Bohara Magars. Magars have been in charge of the religious functions linked to the very source of Thakuri power.

Most Magars also follow a form of Tibetan Buddhism, with priests known as Lama Guru, forming the religious hierarchy. Buddhism is an important part of the culture even in the southern districts, where the Magars have developed a syncretic form of religion that combines earlier shamanistic and Buddhist rituals with Hindu traditions.

Animists and shamanism form part of the local belief system; their dhami (the faith healer or a kind of shaman) is called Dangar and their jhankri (another kind of faith healer or shaman) was the traditional spiritual and social leader of the Magars. Magars have an informal cultural institution, called &quot;Bhujel&quot;, who performs religious activities, organizes social and agriculture-related festivities, brings about reforms in traditions and customs, strengthens social and production system, manages resources, settles cases and disputes and systematizes activities for recreation and social solidarity.
== Dress and ornaments ==
Men wear or wrap-on-loincloth, a &quot;bhangra, a bhoto&quot; or a shirt of vest, and the usual Nepali topi. Women wear the &quot;phariya&quot; or &quot;lunghi&quot;, &quot;chaubandhi cholo&quot; or a closed blouse and the heavy &quot;patuka&quot; or waistband, and the or shawl-like garment on the head.

The ornaments are the &quot;madwari&quot; on the ears, &quot;bulaki&quot; on the nose and the &quot;phuli&quot; on the left nostril, the silver coin necklace&quot;[haari]&quot; and the &quot;pote&quot; (yellow and Green beads) with the &quot;tilhari&quot; gold cylinder, [jantar], [dhungri], [naugedi], [phul], &quot;kuntha, and&quot; also &quot;raiya&quot; in the hand. Magar males do not wear many ornaments, but some are seen to have silver earrings, hanging from their earlobes, called &quot;gokkul&quot;. The magar girls wear the amulet or locket necklace, and women of the lower hills and the high-altitude ones wear these made of silver with muga stones embedded in them and &quot;kantha&quot;. The bangles of silver and glass are also worn on their hands along with the &quot;sirbandhi&quot;, &quot;sirphuli&quot; and &quot;chandra&quot; on their heads. These are large pieces of gold beaten in elongated and circular shapes.

== Festivals ==

=== Maghe Sankranti ===

Maghe Sankranti is considered to be one of the most important annual festivals of the indigenous Magar community. In fact, Maghe Sankranti is the government declared national festival of the Magar community as well as the Tharu community (2009 AD). It is celebrated on the first day of Magh (tenth month of the Nepali calendar, in mid-January), a time that marks the transition from winter to spring. According to the Magar terminology, Maghe Sakranti commemorates the end of &quot;udheli&quot; (literally &#x27;down&#x27;), which is a period that lasts for six months starting from mid-July, and the initiation of &quot;ubheli&quot; (&#x27;up&#x27;), the period lasting for another six months starting from the mid-January. The down and up periods probably correspond to the annual cycle of herding livestock up and down from high pastures, a historically important economic activity of the Magars. The occasion is celebrated with a host of gatherings and special invitations to &quot;chelibetis&quot;, one&#x27;s daughters and other female members of the family. Traditional Magar songs and dances are also performed. One of the most prominent food items prepared on this day (or any other celebratory occasion) is known as &quot;batuk&quot; (commonly known as &#x27;bara&#x27;). It is considered to be a traditional food of the Magar people. Shaped like western doughnuts, it is made from black lentils that have been soaked for over twenty-four hours and are grounded to form a thick paste. It is then mixed with salt, pepper and turmeric and fried in oil. A perfect round shape is formed with the help of the palm, and a small distinct hole is made in the center.

=== Bhume Puja ===

Bhume Puja (also known as Bal puja) is one of the festivals celebrated by the Kham Magar people from Lumbini and Karnali provinces of Nepal. The term &quot;Bhume&quot; means &#x27;Earth&#x27; in Nepali language. The Kham people practice a religion that worships the land (&quot;bhumi puja&quot;), water sprouts (&quot;shim&quot;), forests (&quot;ban puja&quot;) and weather, asking for better crop yields and cattle. The Kham people believe that the Earth is God. Earth is considered to be the mother and protector which provides shelter, food and sustenance for everyone. To make the Earth happy, people perform the dance from mid-May through mid-June. The main celebration takes place during the first week of June.

=== Other Major Festivals ===

* Chandi Purnima, Baisakhe Purnima, Mangsir Purnima, Jestha Purnima. 
* Magar people celebrates major festival like &quot;Chhaigo&quot; as Lhosar which is considered as the New Year for Magar community according to the Naagchi Sambat. Magar people also observe festivals like Chaiti, Rungma, Keja, Yacha etc. These festivals are based on the Tibetan Buddhism and the Bon culture.

== Folk songs and dances ==
Magars have contributed phenomenally in Nepali folk songs and dances. Both men and women take part in folk songs and dances.

=== Sorathi ===

One of the most well-known Magar folk-dances is Sorathi or Maruni dance practiced during Tihar festival. In this dance, the main dancer wears a woman&#x27;s dress, has someone to mimic her dance and one person to beat a &quot;Madal&quot; or &quot;Rani Madal.&quot; This dance is believed to be of divine origin and is directly linked with mythology. The role of the person beating the &quot;Madal&quot; is considered to be the most important, and even the one who mimics the main dancer is actually considered to be the protectors of the dancer. He wears a mask, entertains the crowd by his own gestures etc. The wearing of the dress by the dance is given a ritualistic position, as the dancer&#x27;s dress, are elaborately laid along with flowers, rice etc. on a brass plate or a winnower. The dance begins with the worship of &quot;Madal&quot;, the dress, and other ornaments to be used by the dancer, followed by obeisance to all gods and goddesses like Saraswati, Ram, Sita. The dance ends with blessings to the family that has offered alms to the dancing group and brings the end to the dance ritualistically. The dance originated with the Magar community, and later on, people from the various communities started adopting it. Maruni in Western Nepal is different than in other places. Maruni and Sorathi dances were created in Western Nepal by the Magar community, and Magars who migrated to Eastern Nepal started to make small changes as they performed it there too.

=== Kaura ===
Kaura, also known as &quot;Kaanraha&quot; in Magar language, is a folk musical performance indigenous to the hilly regions of Nepal. It is one of the most popular dances in Nepal. Kaura was originated in the Magar community of Rishing Ranipokhari, Tanahun. According to historians, it was originally called &quot;Kaanraha&quot;. It typically involves rhythmic movements accompanied by traditional music, often performed during festivals or cultural celebrations to showcase the community&#x27;s heritage and identity.

=== Hurra ===
Hurra is a dance of the Magar community which is performed during Tihar festival. Hurra Naach was originated in the Magar community of Mudebas Village of Dhankuta. Hurra has been observed from time unknown but it is widely believed that this culture started from 1850 AD. Hurra, now is considered as a broad culture merely than just a cultural dance. After taking permission from the village Mukhiya, Hurra dance culture starts from the porch of Mukhiya&#x27;s house and then the whole village sing songs for Deusi/Bhailo and dance on the tunes of the madal. The dance is widely performed in almost all the parts of eastern Nepal.

=== Bhume Naach ===

Bhume Naach is one of the popular dances practiced by the Kham Magar people from Lumbini and Karnali provinces of Nepal. The term &quot;Bhume&quot; means &#x27;Earth&#x27; and &quot;Naach&quot; means &#x27;dance&#x27; in Nepali language. The main dance of Bhume Naach, requires that the village boys dance in the center of a circle surrounded by dancing girls who wear beautiful clothing, jewellery, and flowers. The Bhume Naach highlights and celebrates the fact that without Earth there is no life.

Salaijo is a popular Nepali folk song originating from the western region of Nepal. The lyrics of Salaijo typically revolve around topics of love and loss, and the song is often used as a way to express emotions.

=== Yanimaya ===
Yanimaya Bhaka is considered to have originated from the Magar community around the villages of Baglung and Myagdi. It is a form of a &quot;ballad&quot; and the song is often used as a way to express emotions.

=== Other Folk-Songs and Dances ===
Ghatu, Jhorra, Sunimaya, Rung, Bon Lama Naach.

==Occupations==
Agriculture and the military are the primary sources of income. Magars constitute the largest number of &quot;Gurkha&quot; soldiers outside Nepal. Kaji Sarbajit Rana Magar became the head of government during the regency of Queen Rajendra Laxmi. Kaji Biraj Thapa Magar winner of limbuwan, Kaji Jayant Rana Magar was a Gorkhali general of the Gorkha Kingdom and the Kingdom of Kantipur, General Abhiman Singh Rana Magar and Kaji Sarbajit Rana Magar headed the Nepal army. Biraj Thapa Magar was the first army chief in Nepal Army&#x27;s history.

Dor Bahadur Bista&#x27;s observation of Magar&#x27;s occupation during the 1960s was:
Toni Hagen, who did his field research in Nepal during the 1950s, observed:
==Military service==

In the 1750s, Prithvi Narayan Shah, the &quot;Father of Modern Nepal&quot;, was consolidating the many petty kingdoms scattered across the land. For this task, he counted heavily upon his Magar soldiers. The outside world, however, came to know of the Magars only after the British began recruiting soldiers in Nepal for Gurkha regiments from 1815. The British quickly came to appreciate the Magars&#x27; qualities and they became an integral part of their Gurkha Regiments.

A number of Magars have distinguished themselves in military service under Nepali, British and Indian military. During Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16), the Magar Unit/Paltan of Nepali Army, Purano Gorakh Battalion, valiantly fought the Battle of Nalapani. Brigadier General Sher Jung Thapa Magar received Mahavir Chakra and Lieutenant Colonel Dhan Singh Thapa Magar won Paramvir Chakra, the highest gallantry award, while serving Indian Army. Similarly, Dipprasad Pun Magar, a Nepalese Sergeant of the Royal Gurkha Rifles (British Army), was the first Nepali winner of the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross for his valor in Afghanistan in 2010. In the two World Wars, a total of 5 Victoria Cross (out of 13 VCs awarded to Gurkhas) were awarded to the Magars:
* First World War:
**VC Rifleman Kulbir Thapa Magar was the first Gurkha to win Victoria Cross in recognition of his valor and bravery. He was from Palpa. He served in 2/3 Gurkha Regiment (GR). He received Victoria Cross in France in 1915.
**VC Rifleman Karanbahadur Rana Magar, Bharse Gulmi was from 2/3 GR. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for valour on 10 Apr 1917 at El Kafr in Palestine.
* Second World War:
**VC Subedar Lalbahadur Thapa Magar, Nepal Tara was from 2nd GR. He was from Sumsa Baglung. He received Victoria Cross in Tunisia in 1943.
**VC Honorary Lieutenant Tul Bahadur Pun Magar, Myagdi was from 6th GR. He received Victoria Cross in Burma in 1944.
**VC Subedar Netrabahadur Thapa Magar, was from 5th GR. He was from Raghu Bhimad, Tanahun. He received Victoria Cross in Burma in 1944.

==Politics==
Magars since the formation of Nepali state had been in a very influential role in the Nepali government until the Kot Massacre. During the time of King Prithvi Narayan Shah and thereafter, Magars were one of the six courtiers of Kings. Nepali military historian Brigadier General (retired) Dr Prem Singh Basnyat also confirm the high government positions held by the Magars notably Biraj Thapa Magar, Kaji Jayant Rana Magar, Kaji Bandhu Rana Magar, Kaji Sarbajit Rana Magar and Abhiman Singh Rana Magar. During the Rana Dynasty, Magars almost had nil representation in any government positions, which can be considered the darkest time.

Under the leadership of minister Giri Prasad Burathoki Magar, the first ever Magar Convention was held in Bharse of Gulmi District, one of the 12 Magarat in 1957. The objective of the conference was to sensitize the Magars to come forward in the national spectrum. Later Magar political and social organisations included Nepal Langhali Pariwar (1972), Nepal Langhali Pariwar Sang, and Langhali Pariwar Sangh.

Nepal Magar Association is an un-biased and non-profit organization of Magar indigenous people. It is a common representative organization of all the Magar indigenous people of Nepal and is committed to the preservation and promotion of Magar language and culture; the upliftment of the social-economic and the overall educational condition of the Magar people.

<text>Relics that are claimed to be the Holy Nails with which Jesus was crucified are objects of veneration among some Christians, particularly Roman Catholics and the Eastern Orthodox. In Christian symbolism and art, they figure among the &quot;Arma Christi&quot; or Instruments of the Passion, the objects associated with the Passion of Jesus. Like the other Instruments, the Holy Nails have become an object of veneration among many Christians and have been pictured in paintings.

The authenticity of these relics is doubtful. The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; wrote: 
Very little reliance can be placed upon the authenticity of the thirty or more holy nails which are still venerated, or which have been venerated until recent times, in such treasuries as that of Santa Croce in Rome, or those of Venice, Aachen, the Escurial, Nuremberg, Prague, etc. Probably the majority began by professing to be facsimiles which had touched or contained filings from some other nail whose claim was more ancient. Without conscious fraud on the part of anyone, it is very easy for imitations in this way to come in a very brief space of time to be reputed originals.

It is not clear whether Jesus was crucified with three or with four nails, and the question has been long debated. The belief that three nails were used is called Triclavianism.

==The bridle and helmet of Constantine ==
Sozomen and Theodoret reported that when Helena, the mother of Constantine the Great, discovered the True Cross in Jerusalem in the fourth century AD, the Holy Nails were recovered too. Helena left all but a few fragments of the cross in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, but returned with the nails to Constantinople. As Theodoret tells it in his &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, chapter xvii:
The fifth-century Church historian Socrates of Constantinople wrote in his &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, which was finished shortly after 439, that after Constantine was proclaimed Caesar and then Emperor, he ordered that all honor be paid to his mother Helena, to make up for the neglect paid her by her former husband, Constantius Chlorus. After her conversion to Christianity, Constantine sent her on a quest to find the cross and nails used to crucify Jesus. A Jew called Judas (in later retellings further called Judas Cyriacus) led her to the place where they were buried. Several miracles were claimed to prove the authenticity of these items, and Helena returned with a piece of the cross and the nails. Socrates wrote that one nail was used to make a bridle and one was used to make the Helmet of Constantine. Two relics exist that have the form of a bridle and are claimed to be the bridle of Constantine: one in the apse of the Cathedral of Milan, and the other in the cathedral treasury of Carpentras Cathedral.

The Iron Crown of Lombardy has been said to contain one of the nails; however, scientific analysis has shown that the crown contains no iron. The band that was supposed to have been formed from a nail is actually 99% silver.

<text>William Adams Richardson (November 2, 1821 – October 19, 1896) was an American lawyer who served as the 29th United States secretary of the treasury from 1873 to 1874. During his tenure, the Panic of 1873 swept the nation and caused a depression that lasted five years. He controversially responded by issuing $26 million in greenbacks, which averted the crisis, although there was debate as to whether he had the authority to do so. His tenure was marred by the Sanborn incident in 1874, which involved favoritism and profiteering in the collection of unpaid taxes. He was later appointed a judge, and subsequently the chief justice, of the United States Court of Claims.

==Education and career==

Born on November 2, 1821, in Tyngsborough, Massachusetts, Richardson studied at Pinkerton Academy and Lawrence Academy at Groton. Richardson received an Artium Baccalaureus degree in 1843, and an Artium Magister degree in 1846, both from Harvard University and a Bachelor of Laws in 1846 from Harvard Law School. He passed the Massachusetts&#x27; bar in July 1846.

Richardson entered private practice in Lowell, Massachusetts in 1846. Richardson entered partnership and practiced law with his older brother Daniel Samuel, who had a large practice in Lowell. As the junior law partner, Richardson was considered to be a painstaking methodical office attorney.

He served in the militia, first as a judge advocate with the rank of major and later as an aide to Governor George N. Briggs with the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was a Justice of the peace for Middlesex County, Massachusetts from 1847 to 1854. He was a bank President in Wamesit, Massachusetts from 1852 to 1853.

He was president of the Common Council of Lowell from 1853 to 1854, and president of the Mechanics&#x27; Association. He was appointed to revise the statutes of Massachusetts in 1855, and subsequently chosen by the legislature to edit the annual supplements of the general statutes, which he continued to do for 22 years. He was a judge of the Middlesex County Probate Court from 1856 to 1858. He was a judge of the Middlesex County Probate and Insolvency Courts from 1858 to 1872. He was an overseer of Harvard from 1863 to 1875.

==Federal executive branch service==

Richardson was a United States Assistant Secretary of the Treasury from 1869 to 1872. He was Acting Attorney General for the United States Department of Justice in 1870. He was United States Secretary of the Treasury from 1873 to 1874, under President Ulysses S. Grant.

===Tenure as Secretary of the Treasury===

During Richardson&#x27;s tenure the Panic of 1873 swept the nation and caused a depression that lasted five years. Richardson responded by controversially releasing $26,000,000 in paper money reserves in an inflationist measure to help alleviate the effects of the general panic. There was debate whether Richardson had the authority to do so, however, Congress had not passed a law to forbid such an action. Richardson secured the $15,000,000 award from the Alabama Claims through the retirement of United States bonds held in Europe. This was to ensure that no gold had to be transferred overseas by ship.

The post-war economy had expanded so quickly that commercial banks became nervous and began calling in their loans. As a result, in the summer of 1873 the money supply tightened drastically, causing the Panic of 1873. Richardson responded by issuing $26 million in greenbacks to meet the demand. The legality of his action was doubtful, but the Congress did not interfere and the crisis was eased. Such cycles of expansion and panic continued for the next thirty years, however, and were the basis for the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913.

Richardson&#x27;s tenure was marred by the Sanborn Incident, which involved favoritism and profiteering in the collection of unpaid taxes. Pressure mounted for Richardson to be removed; he tendered his resignation, which President Grant accepted. As a face-saving gesture, Grant then appointed Richardson as a Judge of the Court of Claims.

==Federal judicial service==

Richardson was nominated by President Ulysses S. Grant on June 1, 1874, to a Judge seat on the Court of Claims (later the United States Court of Claims) vacated by Judge Samuel Milligan. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 2, 1874, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on January 20, 1885, due to his elevation to be Chief Justice of the same court.

Richardson was nominated by President Chester A. Arthur on January 15, 1885, to the Chief Justice seat on the Court of Claims vacated by Chief Justice Charles D. Drake. He was confirmed by the Senate on January 20, 1885, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on October 19, 1896, due to his death in Washington, D.C. He was interred in Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

===Other service===

Concurrent with his federal judicial service, Richardson was the editor of the Supplement to the Revised Statutes of the United States from 1874 to 1891, as well as a professor of law at Georgetown Law from 1879 to 1894. Richardson was also a member of the District of Columbia Society of the Sons of the Revolution.

==Family==

Richardson&#x27;s father was Daniel Richardson who practiced law and was Tyngsborough&#x27;s postmaster, and his mother was Mary Adams of Chelmsford. Richardson was the descendant of Ezekiel Richardson who settled in Massachusetts Bay in 1630. Richardson&#x27;s mother died in 1825 and her sister became his step-mother the next year.

<doc id="848675" wikidata="Q1995951" url="?curid=848675" title="Granitoid">
<text>A granitoid is a broad term referring to a diverse group of coarse-grained igneous rocks that are widely distributed across the globe, covering a significant portion of the Earth&#x27;s exposed surface and constituting a large part of the continental crust. These rocks are primarily composed of quartz, plagioclase, and alkali feldspar. Granitoids range from plagioclase-rich tonalites to alkali-rich syenites and from quartz-poor monzonites to quartz-rich quartzolites. As only two of the three defining mineral groups (quartz, plagioclase, and alkali feldspar) need to be present for the rock to be called a granitoid, foid-bearing rocks, which predominantly contain feldspars but no quartz, are also granitoids. The terms &quot;granite&quot; and &quot;granitic rock&quot; are often used interchangeably for granitoids; however, granite is just one particular type of granitoid.

Granitoids are diverse; no classification system for granitoids can give a complete and unique characterization of the origin, compositional evolution, and geodynamic environment for the genesis of a granitoid. Accordingly, multiple granitoid classification systems have been developed such as those based on: geochemistry, modal content, emplacement depth, and tectonic regime.

== Generalizations ==

There are several generalizations that apply to the majority of granitoids. Typically, granitoids occur where orogeny thickens continental crust either by subduction yielding a continental arc or by convergence yielding continental collisions. Generally, the evolution to granitoid magmas requires a thermal disturbance to ascent though continental crust.  Most granitoids are generated from crustal anatexis, the partial melting of the crust;  however the mantle may contribute both heat and material.  Granitoids can occur coeval with volcanic rocks that have equivalent chemical composition (granite–rhyolite, syenite–trachyte, granodiorite–dacite etc.) however, these extrusive rocks are often eroded so just the plutonic rocks outcrop.  Granitoids can form in all tectonic environments.

There are numerous exceptions to these generalizations.  For example, granitoids can form in anorogenic environments, a granitoid source rock can be from the mantle (for example, at intraplate hotspots) and the melting mechanism can be radiogenic crustal heat.

<doc id="848680" wikidata="Q6333085" url="?curid=848680" title="KLTV">
<text>KLTV (channel 7) is a television station licensed to Tyler, Texas, United States, serving East Texas as an affiliate of ABC and Telemundo. Owned by Gray Media, the station maintains studios on West Ferguson Street in downtown Tyler (between the Smith County and United States courthouses), and its transmitter is located in rural northern Smith County (near the Wood County line).

[[KTRE]] (channel 9) in Lufkin operates as a semi-satellite of KLTV. As such, it simulcasts all network and syndicated programming as provided through KLTV but airs separate commercial inserts, legal identifications, weeknight newscasts and Sunday morning religious programs, and has its own website. KLTV serves the northern half of the Tyler–Longview–Lufkin–Nacogdoches market while KTRE serves the southern portion. The two stations are counted as a single unit for ratings purposes. Although KTRE maintains its own studios on TV Road (near US 69) in the unincorporated community of Pollok, master control and some internal operations are based at KLTV&#x27;s facilities.

==History==
The station first signed on the air on October 14, 1954; it was founded by the locally-based company Buford Television, which was owned by Lucille Buford. KLTV has been an ABC affiliate since its debut; however, it initially carried the network as a secondary service, while it shared primary affiliation with both CBS and NBC; the station also aired programming from the DuMont Television Network on a secondary basis until 1955. The station originally operated from studio facilities on Texas Loop 323 on the east side of Tyler. In 1964, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) collapsed Lufkin and Nacogdoches into the Tyler market. Soon afterward, the Buford family bought KTRE and converted it into a semi-satellite of KLTV.
KLTV lost the CBS affiliation in September 1984, when Longview-based KLMG-TV (channel 51, now Fox affiliate KFXK-TV) signed on. It retained a secondary affiliation with NBC until KETK-TV (channel 56) signed on in March 1987, resulting in channel 7 becoming an exclusive ABC affiliate. Buford Television owned KLTV and KTRE until 1989, when it sold the stations to Jackson, Mississippi–based Civic Communications. In 1996, KLTV relocated its operations from its longtime studios on Texas Loop 323 in eastern Tyler to a new facility downtown, located in a former savings &amp; loan branch and office complex near the Smith County courthouse; the former studio facility was demolished in November 2007. Civic merged with Cosmos Broadcasting, a division of the Liberty Corporation in 2000. That same year, Liberty sold its insurance businesses to the Royal Bank of Canada, resulting in the retirement of the &quot;Cosmos Broadcasting&quot; banner. Liberty sold itself to Raycom Media in 2006.

In October 2004, KLTV celebrated its 50th anniversary.

At approximately 7:30a.m. on February 3, 2006 (one day after Raycom officially took ownership of the station), KLTV&#x27;s broadcast transmitter in Red Springs collapsed taking both its over-the-air analog and digital signals as well as radio station KVNE (89.5 FM) off the air; no one was reported injured as a result. Cox Communications (which sold its East Texas systems to Suddenlink Communications in 2007) continued to carry KLTV&#x27;s standard and high definition feeds via a fiber optic connection; however, DirecTV and Dish Network customers were not able to receive the station. KLTV re-established an analog signal at reduced power from its former studio and transmitter location in eastern Tyler within 13 hours of the collapse. No cause for the collapse has been disclosed to date.

A new Harris transmitter—on a tower slightly less than half the height of the one that collapsed—was installed the following day, allowing resumption of full-power broadcasts from the Tyler site, allowing over-the-air viewers to watch ABC&#x27;s broadcast of Super Bowl XL over its analog signal; the digital signal was restored several days later. KLTV restored its analog over-the-air signal from its original tower while also being restored on DirecTV, Dish Network and other area cable providers. Its analog transmitter equipment was not damaged and was supplemented at the original tower site with a newer transmitter. However, its over-the-air high definition and digital television transmission equipment was a total loss. In March and April 2007, KLTV ran a &quot;Flip the Switch&quot; promotion to promote the completion of the new Red Springs tower. Viewers were urged to submit 30-second videos to show why they should be selected to turn on the tower, with the winner being selected by popular vote on the station&#x27;s website. On April 17, 2007, at approximately 6:58p.m., contest winner Jeff Heimer officially flipped the switch to turn on the new transmitter and tower.

In January 2011, KLTV started &quot;KLTV in Your Community&quot;, a section of its website serving as a branch for citizen journalism, or community blogging; the blog sites are separated into fifteen East Texas communities with Tyler divided into four quadrants by city section. It has since been shut down.

On June 25, 2018, Gray Television announced that it was merging with Raycom, under the Gray name. When the merger was approved by the FCC and the Justice Department, it made KLTV (and KTRE) a sister station to adjacent market stations KXII in Sherman, KBTX in Bryan and KWTX in Waco in addition to the current Raycom sister stations, while separating it from KXXV. The sale was approved on December 20 and was completed on January 2, 2019.

==News operation==
KLTV presently broadcasts hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday and two hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); unlike most ABC affiliates, the stations do not broadcast an early evening newscast on Sundays. Lufkin semi-satellite KTRE simulcasts KLTV&#x27;s weekday morning, midday, 4 p.m., 5 p.m. and weekend morning and evening newscasts. Channel 7 has been the dominant station in the market for most of its history and its newscasts routinely garner several times the number of viewers of its nearest competitor. KLTV and its staff have received several awards including seven Lone Star Emmy Awards.

The station&#x27;s longtime slogan is &quot;Proud of East Texas&quot;, which has been used since 1985. In a June 2006 article, the &quot;Longview News-Journal&quot; reported KLTV continued its dominance in the area with an estimated 70,000 households tuning into its weeknight 10 p.m. broadcast. KETK-TV was second with about 12,000 viewers and KYTX was watched by an estimated 9,000 viewers. The station was nominated in 2008 for eleven Lone Star Emmy Awards including: best morning and evening newscasts, weather, along with several news/sports specials and reporting. On June 21, 2010, KLTV became the third television station in the Tyler–Longview market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. On September 10, 2012, KLTV debuted an hour-long weekday afternoon newscast at 4 p.m.

===Notable former on-air staff===
* Sandra Brown – weather anchor (now a best-selling author)
* Devin Scillian – news anchor (1986–1989); now at WDIV-TV in Detroit, and also a children&#x27;s author and country singer

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The stations&#x27; signals are multiplexed:

On digital subchannel 7.2, the station carries The365 television network; the subchannel is also carried on Suddenlink Communications digital channel 247. The subchannel launched on December 14, 2005, as the &quot;StormTracker 24/7 Weather Channel&quot;, a local weather service consisting of temperatures, weather conditions and a live feed of the station&#x27;s Doppler radar (branded as the &quot;StormTracker 7 Live Doppler Network&quot;) on a rotating schedule; the subchannel affiliated with This TV in December 2009, it later switched to Bounce TV on January 1, 2012. On January 1, 2020, Circle debuted on 7.2, displacing Bounce TV to 7.4. Circle remained until the channel was shut down on December 31, 2023, being replaced by The365. On digital subchannel 7.3, the station carries Telemundo; the subchannel is also carried on Suddenlink channel 22.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
The station installed its digital transmitter tower on September 23, 2005; on December 14, KLTV became the second television station in East Texas to launch a digital signal, broadcasting on VHF channel 10. KLTV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 7, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition VHF channel 10 to channel 7 for post-transition operations.

===Translators===
On July 27, 2021, Gray Television signed K31PR on the air as a full simulcast partner of the main KLTV signal. Both stations air an identical subchannel line-up, with K31PR&#x27;s coverage area encompassed entirely by the larger KLTV signal.

On March 14, 2023, digital translator K21PE-D was tested at its upgraded site on the KLTV tower, with a license to cover the new signal filed the following day. Concurrently, Gray Television filed a silent notification for K31PR-D, as the translator discontinued broadcasting on March 4, 2023, indicating that the company was doing so in preparation for the channel 31 facility to further upgrade through an upcoming filing.

==Availability==
===Cable and satellite===
On cable, KLTV is available on Suddenlink Communications channel 7 and in high definition on digital channel 720. Dish, DirecTV and several smaller cable providers also carry the station.

===Over-the-air===
KLTV is available throughout much of East Texas, such as Tyler, Athens***, Canton***, Carthage*, Gilmer, Henderson, Jacksonville, Jefferson*, Kilgore, Lindale, Longview**, Marshall*, Mineola, Mount Pleasant, Mount Vernon, Palestine***, Pittsburg, Rusk, and Sulphur Springs***.
** 

In other parts of the market, such as Lufkin, Nacogdoches and Crockett, KLTV is unavailable over the air, but viewers can receive sister station KTRE.

<doc id="848684" wikidata="Q3388699" url="?curid=848684" title="Cup product">
<text>In mathematics, specifically in algebraic topology, the cup product is a method of adjoining two cocycles of degree &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; to form a composite cocycle of degree &quot;p&quot; + &quot;q&quot;. This defines an associative (and distributive) graded commutative product operation in cohomology, turning the cohomology of a space &quot;X&quot; into a graded ring, &quot;H&quot;∗(&quot;X&quot;), called the cohomology ring. The cup product was introduced in work of J. W. Alexander, Eduard Čech and Hassler Whitney from 1935–1938, and, in full generality, by Samuel Eilenberg in 1944.

==Definition==
In singular cohomology, the cup product is a construction giving a product on the graded cohomology ring &quot;H&quot;∗(&quot;X&quot;) of a topological space &quot;X&quot;.

The construction starts with a product of cochains: if formula_1 is a &quot;p&quot;-cochain and 
formula_2 is a &quot;q&quot;-cochain, then 
:formula_3
where σ is a singular (&quot;p&quot; + &quot;q&quot;) -simplex and formula_4 
is the canonical embedding of the simplex spanned by S into the formula_5-simplex whose vertices are indexed by formula_6.

Informally, formula_7 is the &quot;p&quot;-th front face and formula_8 is the &quot;q&quot;-th back face of σ, respectively.

The coboundary of the cup product of cochains formula_1 and formula_2 is given by
:formula_11
The cup product of two cocycles is again a cocycle, and the product of a coboundary with a cocycle (in either order) is a coboundary. The cup product operation induces a bilinear operation on cohomology,
: formula_12

==Properties==
The cup product operation in cohomology satisfies the identity
:formula_13
so that the corresponding multiplication is graded-commutative.

The cup product is functorial, in the following sense: if 
:formula_14
is a continuous function, and 
:formula_15
is the induced homomorphism in cohomology, then 
:formula_16
for all classes formula_17 in formula_18. In other words, formula_19 is a (graded) ring homomorphism.

==Interpretation==
It is possible to view the cup product formula_20 as induced from the following composition:formula_21in terms of the chain complexes of formula_22 and formula_23, where the first map is the Künneth map and the second is the map induced by the diagonal formula_24.

This composition passes to the quotient to give a well-defined map in terms of cohomology, this is the cup product. This approach explains the existence of a cup product for cohomology but not for homology: formula_24 induces a map formula_26 but would also induce a map formula_27, which goes the wrong way round to allow us to define a product. This is however of use in defining the cap product.

Bilinearity follows from this presentation of cup product, i.e. formula_28 and formula_29

==Examples==
Cup products may be used to distinguish manifolds from wedges of spaces with identical cohomology groups. The space formula_30 has the same cohomology groups as the torus &quot;T&quot;, but with a different cup product. In the case of &quot;X&quot; the multiplication of the cochains associated to the copies of formula_31 is degenerate, whereas in &quot;T&quot; multiplication in the first cohomology group can be used to decompose the torus as a 2-cell diagram, thus having product equal to Z (more generally &quot;M&quot; where this is the base module).

==Other definitions==

===Cup product and differential forms===
In de Rham cohomology, the cup product of differential forms is induced by the wedge product. In other words, the wedge product of
two closed differential forms belongs to the de Rham class of the cup product of the two original de Rham classes.

===Cup product and geometric intersections===

For oriented manifolds, there is a geometric heuristic that &quot;the cup product is dual to intersections.&quot;

Indeed, let formula_32 be an oriented smooth manifold of dimension formula_33. If two submanifolds formula_34 of codimension formula_35 and formula_36 intersect transversely, then their intersection formula_37 is again a submanifold of codimension formula_38. By taking the images of the fundamental homology classes of these manifolds under inclusion, one can obtain a bilinear product on homology. This product is Poincaré dual to the cup product, in the sense that taking the Poincaré pairings formula_39 then there is the following equality:

:formula_40.

Similarly, the linking number can be defined in terms of intersections, shifting dimensions by 1, or alternatively in terms of a non-vanishing cup product on the complement of a link.

==Massey products==
The cup product is a binary (2-ary) operation; one can define a ternary (3-ary) and higher order operation called the Massey product, which generalizes the cup product. This is a higher order cohomology operation, which is only partly defined (only defined for some triples).

<doc id="848689" wikidata="Q738269" url="?curid=848689" title="Subaru 360">
<text>The Subaru 360 is a rear-engined, two-door city car manufactured and marketed by Subaru from 1958 to 1971. As the company&#x27;s first mass-produced automobile, production reached 392,000 over its 12-year model run.

Noted for its small overall size, curb weight, monocoque construction, swing axle rear suspension, fiberglass roof panel, and rear-hinged doors, the inexpensive car was designed in response to the Japanese government&#x27;s light car or Kei car regulations and its proposal for a larger &quot;national car,&quot; both intended to help motorize the post WWII Japanese population. The 360&#x27;s overall size and engine capacity complied with Japan&#x27;s Kei car regulations.

Nicknamed the &quot;ladybug&quot; in Japan, and ultimately superseded by R-2, the 360 was one of Japan&#x27;s most popular cars and was available in a single generation in two-door, station wagon (&quot;Custom&quot;), &quot;convertible&quot; (a sedan with a roll-back fabric roof) and sporting variants. The two-door sedans&#x27; model code is K111, while the wagon is known as K142. Ten thousand were sold in the United States, imported by Malcolm Bricklin and advertised as &quot;Cheap and Ugly.&quot;

The nameplate &quot;360&quot; derived from its tax-limited engine displacement: 356 cc.

== Design ==
The 360 featured an air-cooled, two-stroke inline 2-cylinder 356 cc engine mounted transversely at the rear, and was introduced March 3, 1958.

As with many other small two-stroke gas-engined cars, oil needed to be premixed with the petrol (gasoline), with the fuel tank lid serving as a measuring cup. In 1964, the &quot;Subarumatic&quot; lubrication system provided automatic mixing via a reservoir in the engine compartment.

Floor-mounted controls located between the driver and passenger seat included choke, heater and fuel cut-off—the latter to accommodate gravity fed fuel which obviated the need for a fuel pump. The initial production featured a full metal dash board and three-speed manual gearbox, while subsequent models featured a partially padded dash with an open glove compartment, pop-out rear quarter windows, split front bench seat, map pockets, a four-speed manual and optional three-speed-based &#x27;Autoclutch&#x27; transmission—the latter which eliminated the clutch pedal and operated the clutch via an electromagnet.

Final assembly included wheel alignment, brake testing, chassis dynometer, headlight testing, and high-pressure water spray testing.

In contrast to the Volkswagen Beetle, the 360 is much smaller, less powerful, and was not nearly as well accepted in the global marketplace. The body was of monocoque construction and used a lightweight fiberglass roof panel. In the post war period, more automobiles would switch to unibody construction, which is now the norm for passenger cars and even many light trucks. Many of the ideas came from engineers from the former Nakajima Aircraft Company, which became Fuji Heavy Industries. The &quot;suicide doors&quot; are hinged at the rear, which Consumer Reports noted resulted in a partially locked door pulling open in the wind during testing.

== Performance ==
Equipped with a three-speed manual transmission, the 360 had a top speed of , and with a curb weight under , the 360 was exempt from compliance with US safety regulations. Consumer Reports recorded a time of about 37 seconds and reported , despite Subaru&#x27;s claimed . When introduced in 1958, the 360&#x27;s engine produced . This later increased to and then . In August 1968, responding to a new crop of more powerful kei cars, power was increased to . An optional twin-carbureted engine also became available for the 360 Young SS in November 1968, achieving 100 PS per liter. The performance and size limitations were largely the result of its having been engineered and designed for Japanese driving conditions. The speed limits in Japan are realistically set at in urban areas, with average driving distances at per day.

== Variants ==
Several variants were produced, including a station wagon (called the Custom), a convertible, and two sport models known as 1) the Subaru Young S, which had a slightly upgraded (EK32 &quot;F&quot;) engine and transmission (4 gears instead of 3), bucket seats and a tachometer along with a black, white striped roof with a dent along the middle to put one&#x27;s surfboard, and 2) the Subaru Young SS, which had all the Young S enhancements, but also the EK32 &quot;S&quot; engine with chromed cylinders and dual BS32 Mikuni Solex carburetors, producing - and 100 brake horsepower per litre. From 1961 onwards, a flat-nosed truck and van called the Sambar were also produced using the 360&#x27;s engine, with arrangements similar to the Volkswagen Transporter in a smaller size. Many small businesses became very successful thanks to the pickup&#x27;s small size for tight streets, quickness, ease to drive and great fuel economy. Available in Japan between November 1960 and 1966, an export version, known as the Subaru 450, increased the engine&#x27;s displacement to 423 cc using the Subaru EK51 series engine. This model was also given the name Subaru Maia. The Maia variant was the sole sedan model imported into Australia (approximately 35 examples) in 1961 - along with approximately 38 Sambar vans and trucks.

== Export ==
A used car dealer in Ballarat, Victoria (Frank O&#x27;Brien) brought approximately 73 Subaru 360 vehicles into Australia in 1961. This was a mix of Maia sedans and Sambar vans and trucks. Unfortunately they suffered from overheating problems and although a solution was eventually found, it came too late, as the associated losses were too great for the dealership to cope with and further importations ceased.

From 1968, approximately 10,000 were exported to the US, with an original price of $1,297 ($ in dollars ). The 360 was imported to the United States by Malcolm Bricklin before he later manufactured his own cars. The Subaru 360 received notoriety in 1969, when &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; magazine branded the automobile &quot;Not Acceptable&quot; because of safety concerns and lack of power. Because the car weighed under 1000 pounds, it was exempt from normal safety standards, but it was reported that it fared badly in a test crash against a large American car with the bumper ending up in the passenger compartment of the Subaru.

Sales soon collapsed, and there were various rumors of Subaru 360s being tossed overboard or being shredded to pieces. It was also reported that many 360s sat on dealers&#x27; lots for two or three years without ever being purchased.

The Subaru 360 was replaced by the less popular but more advanced R-2 which was quickly superseded by the long-lived Subaru Rex model.

<text>The Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Youth () a minister of the Crown and member of the Canadian Cabinet. The position is responsible for the Department for Women and Gender Equality and the youth portfolio is associated with the Department of Canadian Heritage.

== History ==
The position previously existed as Minister of Status of Women, responsible for what was then known as Status of Women Canada. Traditionally, the office that held the Status of Women portfolio under their purview, that minister has been designated the additional honorary title of Minister responsible for the Status of Women. 

The Status of Women portfolio was originally created in 1971 as a product of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women (created in 1967), who completed their report in 1970. The title of Minister for Women and Gender Equality was created in 2018, following the passage of the &quot;Budget Implementation Act, 2018, No. 2&quot; and the creation of the Department fort Women and Gender Equality, separating Status of Women Canada from the Department of Canadian Heritage. Responsibility for youth issues was added to the portfolio in 2021, once again associating the office with the Department of Canadian Heritage.

==List of ministers==
== History ==
The &quot;status of women&quot; portfolio was originally created in 1971 as result of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women (created in 1967), who completed their report in 1970. This new position, originally titled the Office of the Co-ordinator, Status of Women, was initially meant to help implement the recommendations of the Royal Commission.

During the 1993–2003 ministry of Jean Chrétien, the position was titled Secretary of State (Status of Women), as it did not carry full cabinet rank. The first cabinet of Paul Martin also kept this title, as the office&#x27;s responsibilities were delegated from the Minister of Canadian Heritage. However, in July 2004, the title reverted to Minister responsible for the Status of Women with the swearing-in of Liza Frulla, who doubled as Heritage Minister and was thus ultimately responsible for Status of Women Canada.

In 2016, the position was made a member of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada. In 2018, following the passage of the &quot;Budget Implementation Act, 2018, No. 2&quot;, Status of Women Canada became a federal department called the Women and Gender Equality Canada (WAGE). WAGE administers the Governor General&#x27;s Awards in Commemoration of the Persons Case. One of the programs started by the Status of Women Canada was an education/analysis program called gender-based Analysis Plus (GBA+).

<text>Eichstätt () is a town in the federal state of Bavaria, Germany, and capital of the district of Eichstätt. It is located on the Altmühl river and has a population of around 13,000. Eichstätt is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Eichstätt.

==Geography==

===Location===
Eichstätt lies on both sides of the river Altmühl in the district of Eichstätt of the Oberbayern region of Bavaria, in the heart of Altmühl Valley Nature Park.

===Geology===
Eichstätt is located in a valley of the Franconian Jura and is famous for the quarries of Solnhofen Plattenkalk (Jurassic limestone). On the Blumenberg the Berlin specimen of Archaeopteryx was found by Jakob Niemeyer.

==History==
St. Willibald founded the Diocese of Eichstätt on the site of an old Roman station ( or ) in 741. The city was given walls and chartered in 908. It was ruled by a prince-bishop, and in the Holy Roman Empire was the seat of the Bishopric of Eichstätt until secularization in 1802. In 1806, it became a part of the Kingdom of Bavaria. Eichstätt was included as part of the Principality of Eichstätt, which King Maximilian I granted to his son-in-law Eugène de Beauharnais in 1817 and an episcopal see was reestablished in 1821. It reverted to the Bavarian crown in 1855.

In 870, the remains of St. Walpurga were transferred from their original Heidenheim interment to Eichstätt, where in 1035 the newer burial site was enshrined as the Benedictine Abbey of St. Walburga, which continues to this day.

In 1943, the painter Karl Friedrich Lippmann moved to Eichstätt and stayed until 1955.

&quot;Hortus Eystettensis&quot; (&quot;Garden at Eichstätt&quot;) is the name of an important botanical book first published in 1613 and written by Basilius Besler.

==World War II==

Allied prisoners of war were held at Oflag VII-B in Eichstätt during World War II. Activities carried on by the prisoners there included attempted escapes and the production of plays and musical works. These included Hamlet and the Comedy of Errors by William Shakespeare, the premiere of &quot;Post-Mortem&quot; by Noël Coward - featuring Desmond Llewelyn, later best known as Q in the EON Bond movies - and of the &quot;Ballad of Little Musgrave and Lady Barnard&quot; by Benjamin Britten.

<text>Soyuz 30 (, &quot;Union 30&quot;) was a 1978 crewed Soviet space flight to the Salyut 6 space station. It was the sixth mission to and fifth successful docking at the orbiting facility. The Soyuz 30 crew were the first to visit the long-duration Soyuz 29 resident crew.

Soyuz 30 carried Pyotr Klimuk and Mirosław Hermaszewski, the first (and to date, only) Polish cosmonaut, aloft.

==Crew==
===Backup crew===
==Mission parameters==
*Mass: 
*Perigee: 
*Apogee: 
*Inclination: 51.66°
*Period: 88.83 minutes

==Mission highlights==

The second Intercosmos mission was launched 27 June 1978 to the orbiting Salyut 6 space station. The Soyuz docked with the space station on 29 June, and cosmonauts Klimuk and Hermaszewski were greeted by Vladimir Kovalyonok and Aleksandr Ivanchenkov, the resident crew who had been on board for 12 days. For the third time, the Salyut was a four-man orbiting space laboratory.

The activities of the Soyuz 30 crew, however, were severely curtailed so as not to interfere with the Soyuz 29 crew. On the Soyuz 29 crew&#x27;s rest day, the international crew had to stay in their Soyuz to perform their experiments. Nevertheless, Hermaszewski conducted many experiments. One was crystallization experiments which produced 47 grams of cadmium tellurium mercury semiconductors for use by infra-red detectors on board the station. The yield was far greater - 50% compared to 15% - than ground-based experiments.

The Soyuz 30 crew was trained, as all international crews, in the use of the MKF-6M camera. Training in part took place on a Tupolev Tu-134 flying at 10 km to best mimic conditions on the station. Hermaszewski photographed Poland in co-ordination with aircraft taking close-up photos, but bad weather over Poland limited the photo sessions. They additionally filmed the Aurora Borealis.

Hermaszewski participated in medical experiments which measured lung capacity and the heart during exercise and in a pressure suit. One experiment, which all four on board the station participated in, was Smak (the Polish word for taste), a taste experiment which sought answers to why some food was less palatable in weightlessness.

The Soyuz 30 crew packed their experiments into their capsule and returned to Earth 5 July, landing in a Rostov state farm field 300 km west of Tselinograd.

<doc id="848698" wikidata="Q232790" url="?curid=848698" title="Phryne">
<text>Phryne (, before 370 – after 316 BC) was an ancient Greek hetaira (courtesan). Born Mnesarete, she was from Thespiae in Boeotia, but seems to have lived most of her life in Athens. Though she apparently grew up poor, she became one of the wealthiest women in Greece. 

Phryne is best known for her trial for impiety, in which she was defended by the orator Hypereides. According to legend, she was acquitted after baring her breasts to the jury, though the historical accuracy of this episode is doubtful. She also modeled for the artists Apelles and Praxiteles: the Aphrodite of Knidos was said to be based on her. Phryne was largely ignored during the Renaissance, but artistic interest in her began to grow from the end of the eighteenth century. Her trial was famously depicted by Jean-Léon Gérôme in the 1861 painting &quot;Phryne Before the Areopagus&quot;, which influenced many subsequent depictions of her, and according to Laura McClure made her an &quot;international cultural icon&quot;.

==Sources==
The most substantial contemporary source about Phryne&#x27;s life was Hypereides&#x27; defence speech from her trial. In the ancient world this was a major influence on Phryne&#x27;s biographical tradition, but it is now lost, except for a few fragments. The surviving ancient sources about Phryne are mostly from the Roman Empire, based on earlier Greek literature. The most important of these is Athenaeus, who was from Roman Egypt in the second century AD. His &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; (&quot;The Scholars at Dinner&quot;) is the source of the vast majority of extant ancient writings about Phryne. Other authors of the first, second and third centuries AD, including Plutarch, Pausanias, and Diogenes Laertius, also tell anecdotes about Phryne.

Athenaeus&#x27; main source was fourth-century comedy. By the mid-fourth century, Athenian comedy had moved away from the mythological subjects popular in earlier periods, and more often satirised real people. Phryne featured in several of these plays. In Timocles&#x27; &quot;Orestautokleides&quot; and Anaxilas&#x27; &quot;Neottis&quot; she is named in lists of hetairai, Timocles&#x27; &quot;Neaira&quot; makes a joke about her early life, and Posidippus&#x27; &quot;The Ephesian Girl&quot; describes her trial. Two other plays, Antiphanes&#x27; &quot;The Birth of Aphrodite&quot; and Alexis&#x27; &quot;The Woman from Knidos&quot;, might have alluded to her association with the artists Apelles and Praxiteles.

==Life==
Phryne was from Thespiae in Boeotia. She was probably born in the 370s BC, and was the daughter of Epicles. Both Plutarch and Athenaeus say that her real name was Mnesarete. According to Plutarch she was called Phryne because she had a pale complexion like a toad ( in Greek). She may also have been nicknamed Saperdion, Clausigelos, and Sestus. 

Phryne seems to have spent most of her life in Athens. She might have come there with her family following the conquest of Thespiae by Thebes in 373 BC, been born in Athens to Thespian refugees following the Theban conquest, or been brought there as a girl to take part in the sex trade, as was Neaira, another fourth-century hetaira. She apparently grew up poor – comic playwrights portray her picking capers – and became one of the wealthiest women in the Greek world. According to Callistratus, after Alexander razed Thebes in 335, Phryne offered to pay to rebuild the walls. She was also said to have dedicated a statue of herself at Delphi, and a statue of Eros to Thespiae. Phryne probably lived beyond 316 BC, when Thebes was rebuilt; according to Plutarch her fame meant that she could continue to charge high fees to her clients in her old age.

Hetairai had a reputation in ancient literature for their wit and learning. The trope of the witty hetaira derives from the &quot;Memoirs&quot; of Lynceus of Samos, a comic author of the late fourth century, which contained several anecdotes about the wit of the hetaira Gnathaina. Several anecdotes from the &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; relate Phryne&#x27;s witticisms, though the meaning of many of them is unclear.

Very little is known about Phryne&#x27;s life for certain, and much of her biography transmitted in ancient sources may be invented: Helen Morales writes that separating fact from fiction in accounts of Phryne&#x27;s life is impossible.

===Trial===

The most famous event in Phryne&#x27;s life was the prosecution brought against her by Euthias. Little is known of Euthias, except that he was supposedly a former lover of Phryne, and was accused of being a sycophant – a person who habitually brought prosecutions for personal gain. The prosecution speech delivered by Euthias – which, according to Athenaeus, was composed by Anaximenes of Lampsacus on his behalf – does not survive. Phryne was defended by Hypereides, a well-known and wealthy orator who had a reputation for associating with hetairai. Six of the speeches attributed to him relate to hetairai, and in a surviving fragment of his defense of Phryne, he admits to being her lover. Hypereides&#x27; defence speech survives only in fragments, though it was greatly admired in antiquity. The date of the trial is uncertain. If Anaximenes did compose the speech for the prosecution, it must have been before he moved to Macedon, and therefore was perhaps between 350 and 340 BC. Alternatively, Craig Cooper argues that the trial was likely after the Battle of Chaeronea in 338, while Eleanora Cavallini suggests that it was after 335 BC.

Phryne was charged with , a kind of blasphemy. An anonymous treatise on rhetoric, which summarises the case against Phryne, lists three specific accusations against her – that she held a &quot;shameless &quot; or ritual procession, that she introduced a new god, and that she organised unlawful thiasoi or debauched meetings. The charge of introducing a new god had previously been used in the trial of Socrates; that of organising thiasoi is also known from the trial of Ninos. According to Harpocration, the new god introduced by Phryne was called Isodaites; though Harpocration describes him as being &quot;foreign&quot;, the name is Greek and other sources consider it an epithet of Dionysus, Helios, or Pluto.
According to an ancient tradition, Euthias&#x27; case against Phryne was motivated by a personal quarrel rather than Phryne&#x27;s alleged impiety. Craig Cooper suggests that the trial of Phryne was politically motivated. He observes that Aristogeiton, to whom Athenaeus attributes a speech against Phryne, was a political enemy of Hypereides and prosecuted him for illegally introducing a decree after the Battle of Chaeronea in 338. Phryne&#x27;s own provocative behaviour – for instance her offer to restore the walls of Thebes, on the condition that an inscription attributing the rebuilding to &quot;Phryne the hetaira&quot; be displayed – may also have partially motivated the prosecution. Konstantinos Kapparis suggests that the trial might have been seen as a response to &quot;the uppity alien woman who did not know her place&quot;.

Phryne was said to have been acquitted after the jury saw her bare breasts – Quintilian says that she was saved &quot;not by Hypereides&#x27; pleading, but by the sight of her body&quot;. Three different versions of this story survive. In Quintilian&#x27;s account, along with those of Sextus Empiricus and Philodemus, Phryne makes the decision to expose her own breasts; while in Athenaeus&#x27; version Hypereides exposes Phryne as the climax of his speech, and in Plutarch&#x27;s version Hypereides exposes her because he saw that his speech had failed to persuade the jury. Christine Mitchell Havelock notes that there is separate evidence for women being brought into the courtroom to arouse the sympathy of the jury, and that in ancient Greece baring the breasts was a gesture intended to arouse such a compassionate response, so Phryne&#x27;s supposed behaviour in the court is not without parallel in Greek practice. Ioannis Ziogas observes that it particularly recalls Clytemnestra&#x27;s plea to Orestes in Aeschylus&#x27; play &quot;The Libation Bearers&quot;, and the story of Helen appealing to Menelaus for mercy after the fall of Troy.
However, this episode probably never happened. It was not mentioned in Posidippus&#x27; version of the trial in his comedy &quot;Ephesian Woman&quot;, quoted by Athenaeus. &quot;Ephesian Woman&quot; was produced , and the story of Phryne baring her breasts therefore probably postdates this. In Posidippus&#x27; version, Phryne personally pleaded with each of the jurors at her trial for them to save her life, and it was this which secured her acquittal. The story of Phryne baring her breasts may have been invented by the Hellenistic biographer Idomeneus of Lampsacus, who wrote a treatise on Athenian demagogues. Though all of the ancient accounts assume that Phryne was on trial for her life, was not necessarily punished by death; it was an , in which the jury would decide on the punishment if the accused was convicted.

Phryne&#x27;s trial is, along with those of Ninos and Theoris of Lemnos, one of three known from the fourth century in which a metic woman was accused of a religious crime. Due to her wealth and connections, hers was the only one in which the accused was acquitted. A Hellenistic biographer, Hermippus of Smyrna, reports that after Phryne&#x27;s acquittal, Euthias was so furious that he never spoke publicly again. Kapparis suggests that in fact he was disenfranchised, possibly because he failed to gain one fifth of the jurors&#x27; votes and was unable to pay the subsequent fine. The trial of Phryne also supposedly led to two new laws being passed governing courtroom behaviour: one forbade the accused being present while the jury considered their verdict; the other forbade lament in the courtroom.

===Model===

Phryne was the model for two of the great artists of classical Greece, Praxiteles and Apelles. She is most famously associated with Praxiteles&#x27; Aphrodite of Knidos, the first three-dimensional and monumentally sized female nude in ancient Greek art. However, the only source for this association is Athenaeus. The sixth-century rhetorician Choricius of Gaza also says that Praxiteles used her as a model for a statue of Aphrodite, though according to him it was one commissioned by the Spartans. It is not mentioned by other ancient authors who discuss both Phryne and the Aphrodite of Knidos, such as Pliny the Elder, and Clement of Alexandria names the model not as Phryne but Cratina.

Praxiteles also produced a golden or gilt statue of Phryne which was displayed – according to Pausanias dedicated by Phryne; according to Athenaeus by the Thespians – in the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi. This may have been the first female portrait ever dedicated at Delphi; it is the only known statue of a woman alone to be dedicated before the Roman period. One of Praxiteles&#x27; sculptures of Eros was said to have been inspired by his desire for Phryne; this was displayed in Thespiae alongside two other sculptures by Praxiteles, one of Aphrodite and one of Phryne herself. According to Pliny, Phryne was also the model for Praxiteles&#x27; sculpture of a smiling courtesan, which may have originally been displayed in Athens.

Like Praxiteles, Apelles used Phryne as a model for Aphrodite. According to Athenaeus, he was inspired by the sight of Phryne walking naked into the sea at Eleusis to use her as a model for his painting of Aphrodite Anadyomene (Aphrodite rising from the sea). This was displayed at the sanctuary of Asclepius on the Greek island of Kos before being taken to Rome by the emperor Augustus; by the first century AD it appears to have been one of Apelles&#x27; best-known works.

==Reception==

Phryne was largely ignored during the Renaissance, in favour of more heroic female figures such as Lucretia, but interest in depicting her increased in the eighteenth century with the advent of Neoclassicism. Early depictions of her by Angelica Kauffmann and J. M. W. Turner avoid eroticising her. From the eighteenth century French artists focused on portraying Phryne as a courtesan, particularly depicting her public nudity at religious festivals or during her trial; by the mid-nineteenth century artists such as Gustave Boulanger painted Phryne without any reference to the ancient context as an eroticised and Orientalised nude.

The most famous nineteenth century depiction of Phryne was Jean-Léon Gérôme&#x27;s &quot;Phryne Before the Areopagus&quot;. This painting was controversial for showing Phryne covering her face in shame, in the same pose that Gérôme used in several paintings of slaves in Eastern slave-markets. Critics argued that Phryne should be proud rather than ashamed of her beauty, and that Gérôme&#x27;s portrayal of Phryne was anachronistic. Driven by this controversy, Gérôme&#x27;s painting was widely reproduced and caricatured, with engravings by Léopold Flameng, a bronze by Alexandre Falguière, and a painting by Paul Cézanne all modelled after Gérôme&#x27;s Phryne. By the end of the century, Gérôme&#x27;s painting of Phryne and the various works inspired by it had made her an &quot;international cultural icon&quot;.
The story of Phryne bathing at Eleusis, which according to Athenaeus inspired Apelles to paint the Aphrodite Anadyomene, was also a subject for nineteenth century painters. In Britain, Frederic Leighton and Edward Burne-Jones both painted works on this theme in the 1880s, but the most famous nineteenth century painting of the subject was Henryk Siemiradzki&#x27;s &quot;Phryne at the Poseidonia in Eleusis&quot;.

In nineteenth century literature, Phryne appears in the poetry of Charles Baudelaire and Rainer Maria Rilke. In Baudelaire&#x27;s &quot;Lesbos&quot;, from , she is used metonymically to represent courtesans in general. In Rilke&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, the flamingos are compared to Phryne, as they seduce themselves – by folding their wings over their own heads – more effectively than even she could (&quot;they seem to think / themselves seductive; that their charms surpass / a Phryne’s&quot;). Late nineteenth-century depictions of Phryne in other media included a waltz by Antonin d&#x27;Argenton, a shadow-theatre production by Maurice Donnay – where the scene of Phryne&#x27;s trial was modelled on Gérôme&#x27;s painting – and a comic opera by Camille Saint-Saëns.

In the twentieth century, Phryne made the transition to cinema. Alessandro Blasetti&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Trial of Phryne&quot;) adapted the story of Phryne&#x27;s trial with a contemporary setting, based on a short story by Edoardo Scarfoglio. The following year, the peplum film &quot;&quot; (&quot;Phryne, the Oriental Courtesan&quot;) was released. Both films depict Phryne&#x27;s disrobing at her trial with an iconography influenced by Gérôme&#x27;s painting. A third Italian film, (&quot;The Venus of Chaeronea&quot;), focused on the story of the relationship between Phryne and Praxiteles.

<text>The is a kei class automobile manufactured and marketed for model years 1972-1992 by Subaru primarily for the Japanese Domestic Market, although it was also sold in Europe, South America, Australia and the Caribbean — variously as the Ace, Viki, Sherpa, 500/600/700, Mini Jumbo, Mini Subaru or M60/M70/M80. 

The Rex superseded the R-2 as Subaru&#x27;s kei car, and was available in commercial use versions as well as in a passenger car version. It underwent major changes in 1976, in fall 1981, and again in late 1986. The second generation Rex (1981–1986) also formed the basis for the larger Subaru Justy.

The name &quot;Rex&quot; comes from the Latin word for &quot;king&quot;. This was possibly a response to Suzuki, who referred to their LC10 Fronte as the &quot;Queen of the keis&quot; in their period marketing. In some export markets, the Sambar microvan was marketed as the &quot;Rex Combi&quot;.

The &quot;Rex&quot; nameplate has been reused since 2022 as a subcompact crossover SUV based on the A200 series Daihatsu Rocky.


==First generation==

The Rex (K21), introduced 15 July 1972, was the replacement for the Subaru R-2, which was itself the replacement for the long lived, but outdated Subaru 360. Because the R-2 was based largely on the 360, originally including its air-cooled two-stroke engine, it lasted less than three years, where the 360 was marketed for 11 years and the rear-engined Rex for nine.

The Subaru Rex represented a fresh design, sharing little of its appearance with the Subaru 360, although they were mechanically the same and shared a rear-engine layout. The Rex also retained the 360/R-2&#x27;s rear swing axle. The Rex&#x27;s styling resembled Subaru&#x27;s new compact car, the Leone. The Rex originally featured the same water-cooled 356 cc EK34 two-stroke engine as used in the R-2, and was available only as a two-door sedan. Its engine created . In February 1973 a four-door sedan was added. The Van was registerable as a commercial vehicle, allowing for considerable savings in taxes and fees. The EK34 engine came with a single carburetor on the Custom L, Super L, and other trim levels down to Standard, or a double carburetor for the sporty GSR. The TS (Touring Sport) received a iteration. The GSR was also somewhat lower than its counterparts, due to radial tires being fitted.

In October 1973 the two-stroke was replaced by a 358 cc rear-mounted, watercooled, two-cylinder, four-stroke engine called the EK21. This produced at a peaky 8000 rpm and of torque at 6500 rpm, and featured Subaru Exhaust Emissions Control (SEEC). The car also received a minor facelift (with a &quot;frowny&quot; rather than the smiling grille seen on the turquoise four-door in the infobox being the most obvious difference) and a new chassis code: K22. Front disc brakes were also introduced as an option at the same time. The four-stroke Rex could reach a top speed of . The three-door, two-seater &quot;Van&quot; (K42) arrived in February of the next year, when a five-speed version (Custom5) was also added. The Van&#x27;s engine was in a lesser state of tune and produces .

In September 1974, along with a minor facelift consisting of a new grille and bumpers adjusted to allow for the fitment of larger license plates, a &quot;Wagon&quot; version (K26) appeared. This received four permanent seats, but was no longer registerable as a commercial vehicle and had a considerably lower max load. At the same time, a &quot;Super L&quot; version of the Van was added. The Wagon also received a lower tuned four-stroke engine, with at 7500 rpm; but torque increased somewhat to at 5700 rpm. In April 1975 the Van received a higher roof and became a four-seater. This was necessitated by Japanese commercial vehicle regulation which require the floor to be completely flat when the rear seat is folded. Because the Rex&#x27;s engine was mounted in the rear, the cargo floor was rather high, meaning that more head room would be required before a seat could be installed. The Wagon continued in production until the SEEC-T version was introduced in December, but it lost most of its market with the availability of a four-seater Van.

28 PS became the power output of all versions of the Rex for model year 1976 after the SEEC-T (Subaru Exhaust Emission Control - Thermal and Thermodynamic) emissions control system was introduced in December 1975. Torque was down to at 6000 rpm. The equipment levels were also reshuffled, with the B-type replacing the Standard and then rising from the A via the AG and A to the AG on top. The A and AG versions received disc brakes in front, but the five-speed was no longer available.

=== 550 cc era===
In response to new regulations for Kei cars introduced for 1976, Subaru introduced the larger-engined Rex 5 in May of that year. It retained the earlier bodywork (albeit broadened by 10 cm and with a lengthened bonnet for an overall length of ) receiving a 490 cc version of the same engine. The Rex 5 (K23, K43 in the Van version) engine was still of two cylinders and an overhead cam design, and retained the SEEC-T emissions control system. Power increased from the emissions choked late 360s to at 6500 rpm, while torque increased to at 4500 rpm. The AG version was dropped. The Van version received a engine (at 6000 rpm) with the same torque, albeit at 500 rpm lower. Van equipment levels were Standard and Super Deluxe. This version (called the Subaru 500 in the export) was short-lived, replaced by the bigger Rex 550 exactly one year after being introduced.

The Rex 550, introduced in May 1977, featured the SEEC-T equipped watercooled, two-cylinder, four-stroke 544 cc EK23 series engine. Chassis code was K24, It remained rear-mounted, coupled to a four-speed manual gearbox. Max power remained at a slightly lower 6200 rpm and torque was at 3500 rpm. A comparatively well-equipped Custom L version of the Van (K44) was added. As usual, the Vans received a lower powered version of the engine, with at 6000 rpm but the same exact torque figures. The Van could take a max load of only , 100 kg less than most of its competitors. This was counteracted by the comparatively high level of passenger comfort in the Rex Van.

The Rex 550 was called the Subaru 600 in most export markets. Subaru made much of the &quot;Multi-Use Lever&quot;, which combined the headlight, turn signal, and windshield washer functions. This was not installed on the lowest spec versions (Type B, Standard).

In March 1978 the Swingback version was added, a two-door sedan which received a larger, opening rear window. The large rear window necessitated a slightly smaller opening to the engine compartment, but this was more than made up for by allowing for access to the rear luggage compartment from the outside. In March 1979, the Rex underwent a very minor facelift, the most visible results being new rims and slightly differing bumpers and a small spoiler in front. Then, in response to the very low priced Suzuki Alto, a decontented version of the Van called &quot;Family Rex&quot; was added in October 1979. It was priced at a very low ¥480,000 (under US$2,000 at the time). An automatic clutch option was added on several Rex models in March 1980.


==Second generation==

In August 1981, the second-generation Subaru Rex became front-wheel drive, with all-new bodywork and independent suspension all around. At the time, it was stated that the only parts of the rear-engined predecessor to have remained were &quot;two connecting rods and an ashtray&quot;. Power remained at , with a twin-barrel carburettor. Three and five-door hatchback versions were available. Optional on-demand 4WD became available after October 1983, a first for the class. The 4WD system was electrically engaged by depressing an embedded switch on top of the gear shift. The option of a turbo was introduced on the 4WD Rex in December 1983, to counteract the added weight of the drive system. The &quot;Rex Dinos&quot;, a trim level introduced in 1982, was only available by mail order catalog.

In the European markets, this car was originally marketed as the Subaru 600 or Mini Jumbo. In September 1982 it became the Subaru 700, as it received a larger 665 cc version of the two-cylinder, producing (a 35 PS version using lower octane gas was also available). The engine used a single-barrel carburettor. Top speed was , compared to for the domestic version. These cars were 9 cm longer than their domestic counterparts, due to bigger bumpers, and received 12-inch wheels (rather than the ten-inch units used for most models in Japan). Production ended in September 1986, as Subaru was getting ready to introduce the modernized third generation Rex.

The bodyshell of the second generation Rex was also lengthened and widened to become the original Subaru Justy, with a larger 1-litre engine. The Justy remained in production until 1994, outliving the next generation Rex and even the Rex label itself.

===Yunque===

Chinese Yunque (Guizhou Aircraft Industry Corporation) built the second generation Subaru Rex under license as the Yunque GHK 7060 between 1991 and 2005. There were also GHK 7060A &#x27;Free Wind&#x27; and GHK 7071A &#x27;WOW&#x27; iterations, featuring interesting bodykits.


==Third generation==
The third generation (KG/KN) was presented in November 1986 with the commercial spec Rex Combi with either three or five doors (KG1, KG2 with four-wheel drive). The sedan version, intended for private use, was added a month later. The passenger version was called simply &quot;Rex&quot; and was originally only available with five doors; its chassis codes are KN1 (FF) or KN2 (4WD). In addition to an SOHC two-valve engine with , a version with three valves per cylinder (two intake and one exhaust) and was also available. There was no turbo version of the new Rex. A two-speed automatic transmission was also available, as was a part-time 4WD system. &quot;Twin Viscous&quot; full-time 4WD with a limited slip differential for the rear axle was made available in February 1987. From this point on, all four-wheel drives received the more powerful three-valve engine. A CVT transmission was added June 1987, called ECVT.

A supercharged version with an intercooler and electronic fuel injection was added to the options list March 1988 as a response to the success of the Alto Works and Mira TR-XX. The output of the engine increased to . A supercharger meant less lag than for a turbo, although specific output tended to be somewhat lower than the competition. This was available for both the 3- and 5-door versions. May 1988 saw an available electrically deployed canvas top added to the three-door.

June 1989 saw a gentle facelift and the replacement of the EK series engine to the four-cylinder EN05 &quot;Clover 4&quot; with available to the standard engine and from the supercharged engine. This was the first Kei four-cylinder since the Mazda Carol, and was unique to the class. Naturally aspirated models received &quot;cat&#x27;s eye&quot;-shaped headlamps and a reshaped bonnet while the supercharged models retained the earlier rectangular units, albeit with a new four-hole grille. This, the KH1/2 series Rex (KP1/2 for the commercial Rex Combis), remained available in combination with the ECVT transmission and four-wheel-drive versions, but the two-speed automatic was dropped. In July, export versions (M70 in Europe, Sherpa in Australia) received the same changes and switched from the 665 cc two-cylinder to become the M80 in Europe, the Ace in New Zealand and the Fiori in Australia.

The 550 cc four-cylinder iteration was uncommonly short-lived, as in March 1990 another facelift followed, with a 660 cc version of the EN engine (EN07) and an extended, more rounded nose because of new Kei regulations taking effect. These external differences did not appear in the Australian market until August, and in Europe (Mini Jumbo, M80) by early 1991. This, which was to be the last Rex, received chassis codes KH3 (FF sedan), KH4 (4WD sedan), KP3 (FF commercial), and KP4 (4WD commercial).

&quot;Rex&quot; is also a common nickname for the high-performance Subaru Impreza WRX, especially in Australia where the actual Rex was originally marketed as the Sherpa and then as the Fiori. The Fiori derivative (sold as such from summer 1989) was also equipped with pink and blue pinstriping from the factory, and a two-year, 50,000 km warranty was offered when new. Equipped with a different engine, the Fiori had Subaru&#x27;s 758 cc carburetted four-cylinder EN08 powerplant. This engine, producing at 6,000 rpm, was also used in those European markets that received the Rex and in New Zealand&#x27;s Ace. In Europe it was rebadged M80 to reflect the engine displacement. The M80 was available as a three or a five-door, in DX and SDX versions, with the SDX receiving a standard five-speed manual. Top speed was 125 km/h for four-speeds, 130 km/h for five-speeds.

This generation Rex was marketed as the Viki in certain Southeast Asian markets, a name which was also used for a special edition (Rex ViKi) in the Japanese domestic market. The end for the Rex came in March 1992, when it was replaced by the Vivio. A total of 1,902,811 Subaru Rexes were built in its lifetime. Recently the Rex has become somewhat of a cult car in Japan, being popular in front-wheel-drive drift events.

<doc id="848735" wikidata="Q2534421" url="?curid=848735" title="Ormulum">
<text>The Ormulum or Orrmulum is a twelfth-century work of biblical exegesis, written by an Augustinian canon named Orrm (or Orrmin) and consisting of just under 19,000 lines of early Middle English verse. Because of the unique phonemic orthography adopted by its author, the work preserves many details of English pronunciation existing at a time when the language was in flux after the Norman Conquest of England. Consequently, it is invaluable to philologists and historical linguists in tracing the development of the language.

After a preface and dedication, the work consists of homilies explicating the biblical texts set for the mass throughout the liturgical year. It was intended to be consulted as the texts changed, and is agreed to be tedious and repetitive when read straight through. Only about a fifth of the promised material is in the single manuscript of the work to survive, which is in the Bodleian Library in Oxford.

Orrm developed an idiosyncratic spelling system. Modern scholars have noted that the system reflected his concern with priests&#x27; ability to speak the vernacular and may have helped to guide his readers in the pronunciation of the vowels. Many local priests may have been regular speakers of Anglo-Norman French rather than English. Orrm used a strict poetic metre to ensure that readers know which syllables are to be stressed. Modern scholars use these two features to reconstruct Middle English as Orrm spoke it.

==Origins==
Unusually for work of the period, the &quot;Ormulum&quot; is neither anonymous nor untitled. Orrm names himself at the end of the dedication:

At the start of the preface, the author identifies himself again, using a different spelling of his name, and gives the work a title:
The name Orrm derives from Old Norse, meaning &quot;worm&quot;, &quot;serpent&quot; or &quot;dragon&quot;. With the suffix of &quot;myn&quot; for &quot;man&quot; (hence &quot;Orrmin&quot;), it was a common name throughout the Danelaw area of England. The metre probably dictated the choice between each of the two forms of the name. The title of the poem, &quot;Ormulum&quot;, is modeled after the Latin word (&quot;mirror&quot;), so popular in the title of medieval Latin non-fiction works that the term speculum literature is used for the genre.

The Danish name is not unexpected; the language of the &quot;Ormulum&quot;, an East Midlands dialect, is stringently of the Danelaw. It includes numerous Old Norse phrases (particularly doublets, where an English and Old Norse term are co-joined), but there are very few Old French influences on Orrm&#x27;s language. Another—likely previous—East Midlands work, the &quot;Peterborough Chronicle&quot;, shows a great deal of French influence. The linguistic contrast between it and the work of Orrm demonstrates both the sluggishness of the Norman influence in the formerly Danish areas of England and the assimilation of Old Norse features into early Middle English.
According to the work&#x27;s dedication, Orrm wrote it at the behest of Brother Walter, who was his brother both (biologically, &quot;after the flesh&#x27;s kind&quot;) and as a fellow canon of an Augustinian order. With this information, and the evidence of the dialect of the text, it is possible to propose a place of origin with reasonable certainty. While some scholars, among them Henry Bradley, have regarded the likely origin as Elsham Priory in north Lincolnshire, as of the mid-1990s it became widely accepted that Orrm wrote in the Bourne Abbey in Bourne, Lincolnshire. Two additional pieces of evidence support this conjecture: firstly, Arrouaisian canons established the abbey in 1138, and secondly, the work includes dedicatory prayers to Peter and Paul, the patrons of Bourne Abbey. The Arrouaisian rule was largely that of Augustine, so that its houses often are loosely referred to as Augustinian.

Scholars cannot pinpoint the exact date of composition. Orrm wrote his book over a period of decades and the manuscript shows signs of multiple corrections through time. Since it is an autograph, with two of the three hands in the text generally believed by scholars to be Orrm&#x27;s own, the date of the manuscript and the date of composition would have been the same. On the evidence of the third hand (that of a collaborator who entered the pericopes at the head of each homily) it is thought that the manuscript was finished , but Orrm may have begun the work as early as 1150. The text has few topical references to specific events that could be used to identify the period of composition more precisely.

==Manuscript==
Only one copy of the &quot;Ormulum&quot; exists, as Bodleian Library MS Junius 1. In its current state, the manuscript is incomplete: the book&#x27;s table of contents claims that there were 242 homilies, but only 32 remain. It seems likely that the work was never finished on the scale planned when the table of contents was written, but much of the discrepancy was probably caused by the loss of gatherings from the manuscript. There is no doubt that such losses have occurred even in modern times, as the Dutch antiquarian Jan van Vliet, one of its seventeenth-century owners, copied out passages that are not in the present text. The amount of redaction in the text, plus the loss of possible gatherings, led J. A. W. Bennett to comment that &quot;only about one fifth survives, and that in the ugliest of manuscripts&quot;.

The parchment used in the manuscript is of the lowest quality, and the text is written untidily, with an eye to economical use of space; it is laid out in continuous lines like prose, with words and lines close together, and with various additions and corrections, new exegesis, and allegorical readings, crammed into the corners of the margins (as can be seen in the reproduction above). Robert Burchfield argues that these indications &quot;suggest that it was a &#x27;workshop&#x27; draft which the author intended to have recopied by a professional scribe&quot;.

It seems curious that a text so obviously written with the expectation that it would be widely copied should exist in only one manuscript and that, apparently, a draft. Treharne has taken this as suggesting that it is not only modern readers who have found the work tedious. Orrm, however, says in the preface that he wishes Walter to remove any wording that he finds clumsy or incorrect.

The provenance of the manuscript before the seventeenth century is unclear. From a signature on the flyleaf we know that it was in van Vliet&#x27;s collection in 1659. It was auctioned in 1666, after his death, and probably was purchased by Franciscus Junius, from whose library it came to the Bodleian as part of the Junius donation.

==Contents and style==
The &quot;Ormulum&quot; consists of 18,956 lines of metrical verse, explaining Christian teaching on each of the texts used in the mass throughout the church calendar. As such, it is the first new homily cycle in English since the works of Ælfric of Eynsham (). The motivation was to provide an accessible English text for the benefit of the less educated, which might include some clergy who found it difficult to understand the Latin of the Vulgate, and the parishioners who in most cases would not understand spoken Latin at all.

Each homily begins with a paraphrase of a Gospel reading (important when the laity did not understand Latin), followed by exegesis. The theological content is derivative; Orrm closely follows Bede&#x27;s exegesis of Luke, the &quot;Enarrationes in Matthoei&quot;, and the &quot;Glossa Ordinaria&quot; of the Bible. Thus, he reads each verse primarily allegorically rather than literally. Rather than identify individual sources, Orrm refers frequently to &quot;&quot; and to the &quot;holy book&quot;. Bennett has speculated that the &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot;, &quot;Glossa Ordinaria&quot;, and Bede were bound together in a large Vulgate Bible in the abbey so that Orrm truly was getting all of his material from a source that was, to him, a single book.

Although the sermons have been deemed &quot;of little literary or theological value&quot; and though Orrm has been said to possess &quot;only one rhetorical device&quot;, that of repetition, the &quot;Ormulum&quot; never was intended as a book in the modern sense, but rather as a companion to the liturgy. Priests would read, and congregations hear, only a day&#x27;s entry at a time. The tedium that many experience when attempting to read the &quot;Ormulum&quot; today would not exist for persons hearing only a single homily each day. Furthermore, although Orrm&#x27;s poetry is, perhaps, subliterary, the homilies were meant for easy recitation or chanting, not for aesthetic appreciation; everything from the overly strict metre to the orthography might function only to aid oratory.

Although earlier metrical homilies, such as those of Ælfric and Wulfstan, were based on the rules of Old English poetry, they took sufficient liberties with metre to be readable as prose. Orrm does not follow their example. Rather, he adopts a &quot;jog-trot fifteener&quot; for his rhythm, based on the Latin iambic , and writes continuously, neither dividing his work into stanzas nor rhyming his lines, again following Latin poetry. Orrm was humble about his oeuvre: he admits in the preface that he frequently has padded the lines to fill out the metre, &quot;to help those who read it&quot;, and urges his brother Walter to edit the poetry to make it more meet.

A brief sample may help to illustrate the style of the work. This passage explains the background to the Nativity:
==Orthography==
Rather than conspicuous literary merit, the chief scholarly value of the &quot;Ormulum&quot; derives from Orrm&#x27;s idiosyncratic orthographical system. He states that since he dislikes the way that people are mispronouncing English, he will spell words exactly as they are pronounced, and describes a system whereby vowel length and value are indicated unambiguously.

Orrm&#x27;s chief innovation was to employ doubled consonants to show that the preceding vowel is short and single consonants when the vowel is long. For syllables that ended in vowels, he used accent marks to indicate length. In addition to this, he used three distinct letter forms for the letter &quot;g&quot; depending on how they sounded. He used insular &lt;ᵹ&gt; for the palatal approximant , a flat-topped &lt;ꟑ&gt; for the velar stop , and a Carolingian &lt;g&gt; for the palato-alveolar affricate , although in printed editions the last two letters may be left undistinguished. His devotion to precise spelling was meticulous. For example, he originally used &quot;eo&quot; and &quot;e&quot; inconsistently for words such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;,&quot; which had been spelled with &quot;eo&quot; in Old English. At line 13,000 he changed his mind and went back to change all the &quot;eo&quot; spellings in the book, replacing them with &quot;e&quot; alone (&quot;ben&quot; and &quot;knew&quot;), to reflect the pronunciation.

The combination of this system with the rigid metre, and the stress patterns this meter implies, provides enough information to reconstruct his pronunciation with some precision; making the reasonable assumption that Orrm&#x27;s pronunciation was in no way unusual, this permits scholars of the history of English to develop an exceptionally precise snapshot of exactly how Middle English was pronounced in the Midlands in the second half of the twelfth century.

==Significance==
Orrm&#x27;s book has a number of innovations that make it valuable. As Bennett points out, Orrm&#x27;s adaptation of a classical metre with fixed stress patterns anticipates future English poets, who would do much the same when encountering foreign language prosodies. The &quot;Ormulum&quot; is also the only specimen of the homiletic tradition in England between Ælfric and the fourteenth century, as well as the last example of the Old English verse homily. It also demonstrates what would become Received Standard English two centuries before Geoffrey Chaucer. Further, Orrm was concerned with the laity. He sought to make the Gospel comprehensible to the congregation, and he did this perhaps forty years before the Fourth Council of the Lateran of 1215 &quot;spurred the clergy as a whole into action&quot;. At the same time, Orrm&#x27;s idiosyncrasies and attempted orthographic reform make his work vital for understanding Middle English. The &quot;Ormulum&quot; is, with the and the , one of the three crucial texts that have enabled philologists to document the transition from Old English to Middle English.

<doc id="848744" wikidata="Q1070990" url="?curid=848744" title="County-level city">
<text>A county-level municipality (), county-level city or county city, formerly known as prefecture-controlled city (1949–1970: ; 1970–1983: ), is a county-level administrative division of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. County-level cities have judicial but no legislative rights over their own local law and are usually governed by prefecture-level divisions, but a few are governed directly by province-level divisions.

A county-level city is a &quot;city&quot; () and &quot;county&quot; () that have been merged into one unified jurisdiction. As such, it is simultaneously a city, which is a municipal entity, and a county, which is an administrative division of a prefecture. Most county-level cities were created in the 1980s and 1990s by replacing denser populated counties.

County-level cities are not &quot;cities&quot; in the strictest sense of the word, since they usually contain rural areas many times the size of their urban, built-up area. This is because the counties that county-level cities have replaced are themselves large administrative units containing towns, villages and farmland. To distinguish a &quot;county-level city&quot; from its actual urban area (the traditional meaning of the word &quot;city&quot;), the term &quot;&quot; (shìqū) or &quot;urban area&quot;, is used.

==Comparable territorial divisions in other countries==
While the idea of a &quot;city&quot; being a unit consisting of several &quot;towns&quot; is not a common one in English-speaking world, a somewhat similar naming convention is used for local government areas in some parts of Australia.
For example, in New South Wales such a unit may often be called a &quot;city&quot; (rather than a traditional &quot;shire&quot;), and consist of &quot;towns&quot;. E.g. City of Blue Mountains is made of a number of towns (Katoomba, Springwood, etc.).

==List==
As of 3 April 2023, there are 408 county-level cities in total:

==Sub-prefectural cities==
A sub-prefectural city is a county-level city with powers approaching those of prefecture-level cities. Examples include, Xiantao (Hubei), Qianjiang (Hubei), Tianmen (Hubei) and Jiyuan (Henan).

<doc id="848748" wikidata="Q3468347" url="?curid=848748" title="The Worst Witch">
<text>The Worst Witch is a series of children&#x27;s books written and illustrated by English author Jill Murphy. The series are primarily about a girl named Mildred Hubble who attends a witch school and fantasy stories, with eight books published. The first, &quot;The Worst Witch&quot;, was published in 1974 by Allison &amp; Busby, and the most recent, &quot;First Prize for the Worst Witch&quot;, was published in 2018 by Puffin Books, the current publisher of the series. The books have become some of the most successful titles on the Young Puffin paperback list and have sold more than 5 million copies.

In 1986, the first book in the series was made into a television film of the same name. A TV series based on the book aired from 1998 to 2001, and has inspired two spin-offs, &quot;Weirdsister College&quot;, aired in 2001, and &quot;The New Worst Witch&quot;, aired in 2005. Another adaptation premiered in 2017.

==Background==
The author Jill Murphy began writing &quot;The Worst Witch&quot; at the age of 15, while still at school, and based many points of the stories on her own school experiences at Ursuline Convent in Wimbledon, England, with Singing becoming Chanting, Chemistry becoming Potions and so on. Recalling how the story was initially inspired by her own school experiences, she said in an interview: &quot;My two friends and I used to come home in our dark uniforms, looking very scruffy at the end of the day – my dark plaits sprouting tufts, with lost hair ribbons. My Mum used to say &#x27;Look at you all. You look like the three witches!&#x27; and it gave me the idea for a witch&#x27;s school – so that it was exactly like my school, but with a subtle touch of magic. All the characters are based on my school friends (and enemies) and teachers&quot;.

Murphy completed the first book at the age of 18, but it was rejected by many publishers (on the grounds that children would find a book about a school for witches too &quot;scary&quot;), so she &quot;put it in a drawer&quot; and concentrated on other things, including working as a nanny and in a children&#x27;s home, and for a time living in West Africa, where her first husband was studying.

Publication of &quot;The Worst Witch&quot; finally came about, as Jill Murphy recalled, &quot;thanks to a series of coincidences involving me spending time in Ghana, and a friend meeting Margaret Busby (Ghanaian herself, and considering starting a children&#x27;s list for her imprint) at a publishers&#x27; party in London&quot;. &quot;The Worst Witch&quot; was finally published in 1974, when Murphy was 24, by the small independent company Allison and Busby.

==Series overview==
The books in the series all focus on Mildred Hubble, a young witch who attends Miss Cackle&#x27;s Academy for Witches, a school of magic. Although well-intentioned, Mildred&#x27;s clumsy personality leads the girl to disastrous situations, and she is thus considered the worst student in the school. The benevolent headmistress, Miss Cackle, is generally understanding, whereas Mildred&#x27;s form teacher Miss Hardbroom thinks she just is not trying hard enough. Mildred&#x27;s friends include Maud Spellbody, a rotund, sensible girl who is always trying to avoid confusion, and Enid Nightshade, a practical joker who is more likely than Mildred to get them all into trouble. The three girls have a strong rivalry with Ethel Hallow, a high-born, snobbish and vindictive classmate.

Each book covers one term at the school. There are two terms each year: the Winter term, from September to January, and the Summer term, from March to July. In &quot;First Prize for the Worst Witch&quot;, the most recent book, Mildred is in the Summer term of her fourth year.

==Books==
===&quot;The Worst Witch&quot;===
&quot;The Worst Witch&quot; was first published in 1974 by Allison &amp; Busby, and proved to be an immediate success, selling out within two months.

;Plot
The novel begins with Mildred Hubble and the upcoming traditional assembly where all of the first-years are given their own black cats that they will teach to ride on their broomsticks with them. Unlike the other girls, who receive black kittens, Mildred receives a tabby cat, which she simply calls Tabby. The kitten is unable to sit on a broomstick, so Mildred carries Tabby in her bag. Miss Hardbroom disapproves, and Mildred has to stop. Afterwards, another witch called Ethel Hallow teases Mildred about it and dares her to turn her into a frog. Mildred loses her temper and turns Ethel into a pig instead.

In the next chapter, Mildred and Maud inadvertently make an invisibility potion instead of a laughing potion in their class test.

In the following chapter, the girls are practising for a broomstick display for Halloween. Ethel lends Mildred her spare broom, on which she has secretly put a spell. During the Halloween festival, Mildred&#x27;s broom starts bucking, causing all the girls to fall from their broomsticks. The Chief Magician denounces the academy, and Mildred is summoned to a meeting with Miss Cackle and Miss Hardbroom the next morning. Mildred, fearing expulsion, decides to run away with Tabby.

When walking through the forests near the academy, Mildred hears voices through the trees and comes across a group of witches, headed by one who looks like Miss Cackle. After hearing their plot to turn every teacher and student witch in the academy into frogs, Mildred turns the group into snails, packs them into cardboard boxes, and takes them back to the academy. At first, Miss Cackle and Miss Hardbroom refuse to believe her, but when Mildred describes the leader, Miss Cackle realises she sounds like her identical twin sister, Agatha. They turn Agatha and her associates back into humans. Mildred&#x27;s interview is cancelled for saving the school. Later that morning, Ethel is exposed as the cause of Mildred&#x27;s broomstick mishap, and Mildred is vindicated and praised as a hero to the rest of the academy.

===&quot;The Worst Witch Strikes Again&quot;===
&quot;The Worst Witch Strikes Again&quot; was first published in 1980 by Allison &amp; Busby and features a new character, Enid Nightshade.

;Plot
Mildred Hubble returns to Miss Cackle&#x27;s Academy for Witches for the Summer Term of her first year. Miss Cackle has trusted Mildred to look after the new girl, Enid Nightshade, and help her settle in. Since Mildred has to spend a lot of time with Enid, Maud becomes angry and jealous and breaks off their friendship, siding with Ethel in retaliation.

Mildred starts showing Enid around the academy, only to discover that Enid has smuggled a monkey into school with her. During the assembly that follows, Miss Cackle announces her birthday celebration. During a chanting lesson with Miss Bat after assembly, Enid deliberately sings awkwardly and out of tune, causing Mildred to burst into laughter. Mildred is sent to Miss Cackle&#x27;s office. When going up to her room, Mildred checks on Enid&#x27;s monkey, causing it to escape. Mildred chases it down the stairs and bumps into Miss Hardbroom, who sends her to the library to study.

After spotting the monkey on top of one of the castle towers, Mildred jumps onto her broomstick. Miss Hardbroom turns the monkey into its original form, a school regulation black cat. Enid secretly reveals to Mildred that she turned the cat into a monkey for fun.

On Sports Day, Mildred and Enid become partners. Enid places a spell on Mildred&#x27;s pole, so in the pole-vaulting contest, Mildred springs high into the air and lands into Miss Hardbroom&#x27;s study via the window. Moments later, Miss Cackle, Miss Hardbroom, and Miss Drill arrive, and Miss Cackle angrily says that if there is any more bother from Mildred that term, she will be expelled.

Determined to avoid expulsion for the rest of the term, Mildred refuses every daring suggestion Enid makes. Enid decides to skip Miss Cackle&#x27;s boring birthday celebration and hides in a store cupboard, pulling Mildred in with her. Seeing an opportunity to get Mildred expelled, Ethel Hallow spitefully locks the door behind them.

Inside the cupboard, the two girls find an old broomstick that they use to fly out of a slit-window leading into the assembly hall. As luck has it, Maud is on stage, having been chosen to recite the first years&#x27; contribution to the recital. Having long regretted her jealous behaviour, Maud introduces Mildred and Enid as a surprise broomstick display item. The display doesn&#x27;t go especially well, but Miss Cackle decides it is the thought and effort that counts and praises them highly. The three girls become friends and are delighted when the end-of-term bell rings with Mildred still a pupil at the academy.

===&quot;A Bad Spell for the Worst Witch&quot;===
&quot;A Bad Spell for the Worst Witch&quot; () was published in 1982. It features Ethel Hallow&#x27;s little sister, Sybil Hallow, and her friend Clarice Crow.

;Plot
Mildred Hubble returns to Miss Cackle&#x27;s Academy for Witches for her second year, determined to lose her embarrassing reputation as &quot;the worst witch in the school&quot;. After Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade arrive, the three bump into two first-years (one of whom reminds Mildred very strongly of someone, the other with ginger frizzy hair in bunches). The one who seems familiar bursts into tears and clings onto Mildred when she hears that many of the teachers (including Miss Hardbroom) are quite strict. Mildred also accidentally slips a made-up story about Miss Hardbroom turning a student into a frog when she was just two seconds late for a lesson. To the girls&#x27; horror, they also learn that they have Miss Hardbroom for another year.

The next morning, a fire bell rings. Mildred scrambles into her clothes, notices from her window that Miss Hardbroom standing in the playground surrounded by hazy purple smoke. Thinking she is in a state of shock, Mildred tries to douse her in freezing cold water, but the bucket slips off her broomstick and lands with a clang on Miss Hardbroom&#x27;s head. After witnessing the incident, Ethel Hallow confronts Mildred at lunchtime, saying that the girl she told the frog story to was her younger sister, Sybil. After much provocation, Mildred loses her temper and insults Ethel&#x27;s family —&quot;All you Hallows are weeds, weeds, weeds!&quot;

After an unfortunate flying lesson, where Tabby makes another terrified attempt to avoid sitting on the end of the broomstick, Miss Hardbroom sends Mildred to her room to calm down. When sitting in her bed, however, Mildred accidentally falls asleep and does not hear Ethel creeping into her room.

Mildred is awoken by her bedroom door shutting, only to find that everything looks giant-sized, even Tabby. Peeking in the mirror, she finds that somebody has turned her into a frog. When jumping onto her bed, the frog-Mildred notices a tatty handful of weeds on her pillow, no doubt left by Ethel as a reference to her family&#x27;s insult and why she turned her into the frog.

Panicking, Mildred squeezes under the gap under her bedroom door and hops off to a potions lesson, where everyone has noticed her disappearance. Miss Hardbroom, however, discovers her and puts her in a jar. During the lesson, Mildred manages to escape from the jar and hops over to Ethel&#x27;s desk, where she drinks an invisibility potion. Taking advantage of her invisibility, the frog-Mildred hops out of the academy and lands in the lily pond on the castle grounds.

There, Mildred meets another frog who was also a human once called Algernon Rowan-Webb (though he has been a frog for so long he can barely remember his surname). Algernon reveals that, rather like Mildred, he was turned into a frog by a fellow magician after an argument and can only be turned back into a human by another magician. Algernon also reveals that the one thing he craves is to have a &quot;proper tea again, with buttered toast and crumpets with honey&quot;.

Promising to return for him, Mildred hops back up to the academy. Maud and Enid, who have been worrying about their friends&#x27; disappearance, suddenly realise what has happened when Tabby shows affection towards the frog-Mildred, and take her to Ethel, who reluctantly turns her back into a human. Miss Hardbroom comes by, and Ethel tells her that she caught Maud, Enid, and Mildred sneaking around the school. Mildred furiously attempts to tell the truth, and the disbelieving Miss Hardbroom is about to give her a punishment when she notices that Mildred&#x27;s feet are still invisible. Mildred realises that this proves her story and tells Miss Hardbroom what happened in the potion lab. Miss Hardbroom tells Mildred and Ethel to report to her office the next day.

In the morning, Miss Hardbroom reprimands both Mildred and Ethel for their ongoing feud, and they are both punished with lines – Ethel for turning Mildred into a frog and attempting to lie her way out of trouble, and Mildred for upsetting Ethel&#x27;s sister. The two girls are also banned from attending the Halloween ceremonies – the only chance Mildred would have had to find a magician who could turn Algernon back into a human. Mildred feels she has no choice but to kidnap somebody who is going to the Halloween festival. She tricks a third-year witch, Griselda Blackwood, into looking under her bed for an imaginary beetle before tying her up and taking her cat.

Later, Ethel discovers Griselda being held captive in Mildred&#x27;s room, and the two fly off to the festival to turn Mildred in. When exposed, Mildred takes the plunge and strides up to chief magician Mr Hellibore, handing him the box that contains Algernon. As luck would have it, Mr Hellibore was one of Algernon&#x27;s fellow magicians at the time of his transformation, and he immediately turns him old friend back to his human form.

As a last request from Mildred, Mr Hellibore magics up a pot of tea and a plate of toast, crumpets, and butter. Algernon himself then conjures a pot of honey for the crumpets and the three head off to enjoy the supper.

===&quot;The Worst Witch All at Sea&quot;===
&quot;The Worst Witch All at Sea&quot; () was published in 1993. It is the only book in the series not set in Miss Cackle&#x27;s Academy for Witches, but by the sea instead.

;Plot
Mildred Hubble returns to Miss Cackle&#x27;s Academy for Witches for the Summer Term of her second year. Instead of the usual black-and-grey-checked dresses, Miss Hardbroom persuaded Miss Cackle to change them to plain black. After crash-landing in a pile of snow and meeting up with her best friends, Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade, Ethel Hallow appears and tells Mildred that Miss Cackle wants to see her.

Miss Cackle suggests to Mildred that she replaces Tabby. Last term, a third-year witch, Fenella Feverfew, transferred to Miss Pentangle&#x27;s Academy several mountaintops away and left behind her sleek black cat, Ebony, since they have owls at Miss Pentangle&#x27;s instead of black cats. Down in the kitchens, Mildred reluctantly hands over Tabby to Miss Tapioca (to catch mice), who gives her Ebony in return. Mildred is too upset to tell either Maud or Enid about it until after assembly.

Miss Hardbroom announces that Mr Rowan-Webb, the frog-magician whom Mildred saved from the lily pond the previous term, has invited all the second-years to spend a week&#x27;s holiday at his castle, Gloom Castle at Grim Cove.

On the morning of departure, unable to bear the thought of a week without Tabby, Mildred sneaks down into the school kitchens, lets Ebony out of his cage, and instead hides Tabby inside.

When they reach Gloom Castle, they find that it is falling apart: the armchairs have springs and stuffing sticking out and there are no proper beds (apart from one, which Ethel Hallow immediately claims) other than old sleeping-bags, piles of pillows, and what appear to be hospital trolleys. Mildred gets an old sleeping-bag under the window and realises she must divert attention away from Tabby.

Mildred spots a boat attached to a breakwater and decides to hide Tabby in the cabin of the boat. After a wonderful day on the beach, Mildred tries to sneak some kippers to Tabby, but Ethel catches Mildred, who pretends to be looking for some mythical treasure on Cat&#x27;s Head Rock in front of the cove in the boat on the breakwater. As the two head back up the cliff stairs, they witness Miss Hardbroom flying down to the beach on her broomstick with her own black cat, Morgana. Morgana runs to the boat and feeds on the kippers that were meant for Tabby. Miss Hardbroom spots both Tabby in the cabin and Morgana eating the fish. Stepping on board to investigate, she slips on a kipper, hits her head, and falls unconscious.

Sneaking out to feed Tabby again, Mildred is confronted by Ethel, who snidely tells her that she has untied the boat and let it drift out to sea. Mildred uses a broomstick that she finds on the beach (not realising it is Miss Hardbroom&#x27;s) to fly out to the drifting boat, where she discovers not only Tabby but the comatose Miss Hardbroom. Minutes after, they bump into Cat&#x27;s Head Rock. Mildred ties the boat onto an odd-looking chunk of rock and falls asleep.

When she awakens, she finds that Maud and Enid have discovered them. Mildred tells them that there is something strange about the rock the boat is tied to. They pull at it and find that it is the mythical treasure chest.

When they get back, Miss Hardbroom has revived, and her injured head is bandaged. The contents of the treasure chest are used both to repair Gloom Castle and to refurbish Cackle&#x27;s Academy, and Mildred is permitted to keep Tabby again as a reward.

Mildred enjoys the rest of her holiday, feeling like &quot;the luckiest girl in the world instead of the worst witch in the school&quot;.

===&quot;The Worst Witch Saves the Day&quot;===
&quot;The Worst Witch Saves the Day&quot; () was published in 2005. It features Agatha Cackle disguised as new teacher Miss Granite.

;Plot
Mildred Hubble is returning to Miss Cackle&#x27;s Academy for Witches on the first day of her third year. After meeting up with her friends, Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade, Mildred sees that Maud&#x27;s hair is curly (she borrowed a hairstyling brush from her aunt) and they also learn that they will have a new form-teacher this year other than Miss Hardbroom.

They see in assembly that their new form-teacher will be Miss Granite, who was hired by Miss Cackle after Miss Gribble failed to show discipline and against Miss Hardbroom&#x27;s advice. Miss Granite is described as being very strange-looking and having &quot;a huge cloud of orange curls&quot; and also wearing &quot;enormous purple-tinted glasses and a short cape with a collar turned up so high that you couldn&#x27;t see much of her face at all&quot;. Miss Granite speaks in a very high-pitched, squeaky voice that shocks everyone, including Ethel Hallow.

Mildred unravels her pigtails to try out Maud&#x27;s styling brush. Maud and Enid find her with her hair loose, and a chunk of her hair tangled up with the brush in a huge mess. Ethel comes in and volunteers to help. However, the &quot;help&quot; amounts to taking a pair of scissors and chopping off both the styling brush and the messy hair.

Ethel later offers to help Mildred again in her hair predicament. She formulates a potion that she claims will restore Mildred&#x27;s hair to its rightful length. Mildred applies the potion that night, and just when she is dropping off to sleep, her hair starts growing longer and longer by the minute, engulfing the whole school. Miss Hardbroom comes to investigate, states that Mildred is having &quot;a bad hair day&quot;, manages to stop the hair growing and cuts it to its rightful length and vapourises the swathes of hair that had engulfed the whole school.

In a flying lesson, Ethel steals Tabby (who has been suffering a nervous breakdown as a result of the hair incident) and hides him on the roof in front of Miss Granite&#x27;s study&#x27;s window.

That night, when trying to recover Tabby, Mildred is locked in a cupboard by someone who seems to be Miss Cackle but is actually Miss Cackle&#x27;s identical twin Agatha Cackle, who sneaked into the school disguised as Miss Granite. Agatha is trying to turn all the teachers and pupils into snails. Mildred manages to turn herself into an ant, sneaks out of the cupboard, and goes to Maud&#x27;s room, where she tries unsuccessfully to wake her. Fortunately, she is able to attract Maud and Enid&#x27;s attention by using ink-blots to write two notes – &quot;HELP NOT ANT&quot; attracting their attention to her and &quot;FORGOT SPEL&quot; clarifying her dilemma – and Maud and Enid turn her back into a human. Mildred tells them what is going on, and just as Agatha is about to turn Miss Cackle into a snail, Mildred turns her into a snail herself. They also bump into Miss Hardbroom, who had been away.

Miss Hardbroom suggests that Miss Cackle poses as Agatha and invites Agatha&#x27;s rebellious coven in, whereupon Mildred and the others will turn them all into snails, which happens. As Mildred, Maud, and Enid go back to bed, they realise that they miss Miss Hardbroom as their form-teacher. She suddenly appears in front of them and is friendly for a brief moment, admitting she has missed them too, before strictly telling them to get back to bed with no candles on.

===&quot;The Worst Witch to the Rescue&quot;===
&quot;The Worst Witch to the Rescue&quot; () was published in 2007 and features Ethel Hallow&#x27;s only friend, Drusilla Paddock, in a largely increased role since her brief cameo in &quot;The Worst Witch All at Sea&quot;.

;Plot
Ethel Hallow is returning to Miss Cackle&#x27;s Academy for Witches for the Summer Term of her third year. Miss Hardbroom had previously set them a holiday project, but Ethel is doing exactly what Miss Hardbroom told them not to do: trying to think up a project in five minutes flat on the way back to school. Ethel spots Mildred Hubble crash-landed in a tree and manages to help her steady herself. Mildred explains to Ethel her project: a spell that can make animals talk, though it can only work on animals that fit into 25 centimetres and only lasts for two weeks. When helping Mildred out of the tree, Ethel knocks Mildred&#x27;s luggage out of the tree. While Mildred tries to get Tabby, who had scampered up the tree, Ethel scoops up Mildred&#x27;s project folder and art bag and her 30 coloured pencils.

On the way there, Mildred finds her friends Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade. When Mildred tells them about Ethel being nice for a change, Enid suggests she may have taken a &quot;niceness course&quot; during the holidays. Maud and Enid become suspicious when they catch Mildred talking to someone or something in her cat basket.

The girls find that their new form mistress is called Miss Mould, who has a &quot;soft and kindly&quot; voice and &quot;short mousy hair parted in the middle and pulled into a ponytail at her neck&quot;. She is a great relief from the horrifically strict Miss Hardbroom and the extremely weird Miss Granite whom they had had the previous term. Mildred sits next to Drusilla Paddock, who swaps places with Ethel after Miss Mould tells Ethel her coils are too short. Minutes later, a maraca-like noise echoes through the classroom. Mildred finds that her coils have turned into five rattlesnakes. Miss Mould gets the whole class outside while Ethel stays inside and evaporates the rattlesnakes. Just then, Miss Hardbroom appears, and Miss Mould explains what happened. Miss Hardbroom sends Mildred to her room and bans her from art lessons for the rest of the term. Mildred runs to her room, where she figures out it must have been Ethel, who turned her pot and coils into the snakes out of jealousy.
The next day, in a lesson with Miss Hardbroom, the girls are presenting their projects to the class. Ethel goes first, but her project is the same as Mildred&#x27;s. Mildred shouts to Miss Hardbroom that Ethel had stolen her project. Miss Hardbroom opens Mildred&#x27;s project folder but finds only many sheets of paper with smiley faces drawn on them in different colours. Miss Hardbroom &quot;transfers&quot; Mildred to her room.

Later, Mildred finds that the creature inside her cat basket, a tortoise called Speedy whom she had used her spell on, can still speak. She renames him Einstein, and he tells her about overhearing her conversation with Ethel inside the tree. After Mildred runs to tell Maud and Enid the good news, Mildred accidentally leaves her bedroom door open, and Einstein escapes. While plodding along the corridor, he is discovered by Drusilla Paddock, who takes him to Ethel&#x27;s room. While Ethel and Drusilla talk, it is revealed that Ethel did indeed take Mildred&#x27;s project and had also &quot;tried out&quot; a snake spell on Mildred&#x27;s pot and coils in art. Einstein overhears everything.

When they are taking Einstein back to Mildred, Ethel eavesdrops on what Mildred is telling Maud and Enid. After discovering that Einstein can still speak and had overheard the conversation between Ethel and Mildred about the project, and that Einstein only has one more day before the spell wears off and he becomes mute forever, Ethel orders Drusilla to hide Einstein in the hollow pine tree outside the school gates. Einstein is put into a cardboard box that also contains a small green frog called Cyril, the animal whom Ethel had used in her demonstration. Cyril escapes and hops to Mildred&#x27;s room. Cyril tells Mildred that Drusilla hid Einstein in the hollow pine tree outside the school gates and that he overheard several conversations about stealing projects and turning pots into snakes.

After releasing Cyril into the woods, Mildred gets on her broomstick and, during a violent thunderstorm, finds and rescues Einstein. On landing, she is confronted by Miss Hardbroom, who takes Mildred and Einstein inside and, after hearing part of the incidents from Mildred, sets an interview with Mildred and Ethel the next morning.

The next morning, Mildred goes to Miss Cackle&#x27;s office where Einstein, resting in Miss Cackle&#x27;s overflowing in-tray, awakes and tells Miss Cackle and Miss Hardbroom that he overheard the conversation between Ethel and Mildred in the tree. He also says that he heard Ethel telling Drusilla that she had tried out a snake spell on Mildred&#x27;s coils and had taken Mildred&#x27;s project, copied it out in her own writing, and then thrown it in the kitchen bins. Ethel sifts through the rubbish and eventually finds Mildred&#x27;s tea-stained project. Miss Hardbroom makes Ethel apologise to Mildred in assembly in front of the whole year as an alternative to being expelled for cheating as well as for her actions that put herself and Mildred in great danger.

During a broomstick-flying lesson, Mildred reveals to Maud and Enid that Miss Cackle had provided Miss Mould&#x27;s classroom with a proper kiln and craft room and she also got to keep Einstein as a pet. As the clock strikes midday, Mildred sprints into her room and hears Einstein speak for the last time in his raspy little voice (&quot;I&#x27;m glad I belong to you&quot;), before munching on his carrot and going silent forever.

===&quot;The Worst Witch and the Wishing Star&quot;===
&quot;The Worst Witch and the Wishing Star&quot; (Scholastic UK, ; another (?), ) was released by Scholastic UK in 2013.

Returning from the holidays in stormy weather Mildred, Maud and Enid arrive to be told by Miss Drill that there will be a talent-displaying competition between Miss Cackle&#x27;s Academy, Moonridge and Pentangle&#x27;s school to win a swimming-pool as the award for the best talent.

Mildred, much to her disappointment, has been chosen to work lantern monitor along with Drusilla and Ethel. On that first night, Maud spots a shooting star, and Mildred makes a wish, followed by Miss Hardbroom, who does the same reluctantly. On the first lantern monitor shift, Mildred is given a holdall containing safety objects in it. When she reaches the gates to finish the job, Mildred spots a stray dog, who she names Star. She takes him to her bedroom as a secret pet, much to the disapproval of Tabby.

During the weeks that follow Mildred, realising that Star is well behaved and calm on a broomstick, she trains him to do various tricks with her. Maud and Enid, who realise Mildred isn&#x27;t spending much time with them, soon discover about Star and are amazed by the tricks Mildred has taught him. Ethel, suspicious about Mildred hiding something in her holdall, reaches into it to discover Star was hidden in it and the both of them collapse into the lanterns igniting the costumes Form Five have made for the talent competition.

Miss Hardbroom, furious, sends Ethel and Mildred along with Star on a lead to Miss Cackle&#x27;s office for what they had done. Maud and Enid then explain about Star&#x27;s tricks on the broom. Miss Cackle accepts the replacing talent, and the next day, the competition took place with the schools showing their talents. When it&#x27;s Mildred&#x27;s turn, she amazes the judges with Star&#x27;s tricks and wins the competition and the swimming pool. When the pupils go back to their school, Miss Cackle allows Mildred to keep Star as her broomstick companion as a special privilege. Mildred later explains to Miss Hardbroom that she wished for Star on the shooting star at the beginning of term, which doesn&#x27;t annoy her as she wished on the star for them to win the competition. The story concludes with the teachers celebrating their victory and, at the same time, Miss Hardbroom&#x27;s birthday.

=== &quot;First Prize for the Worst Witch&quot; ===
&quot;First Prize for the Worst Witch&quot; () was published in 2018. Its writing was delayed when Murphy underwent cancer treatment.

Heading back to Miss Cackle&#x27;s Academy at the start of the summer term of the fourth year, Mildred is feeling much more confident thanks to her new broomstick companion, Star the dog, new-found flying skill, and recent successes such as winning a swimming pool for the school. She confesses to Maud that she even dreams of being selected as Head Girl for next year at the end-of-term prizegiving, though they both concede it seems incredibly unlikely; even without considering Mildred&#x27;s long career of mishaps, they find it impossible to imagine anyone but Ethel Hallow taking the position. Not only is Ethel academically easily the strongest member of her year, but every member of the Hallow family to attend the school for the past two centuries has held the position of Head Girl.

However, Mildred quickly discovers that her nemesis Ethel Hallow has gotten hold of a flyer from a local circus that suggests that her pet Star is their lost property, and has given it to Miss Cackle and Miss Hardbroom. The teachers tell Mildred that they have no choice but to contact the circus and, if necessary, return the dog. When the circus owners, Mr and Mrs Brilliantine, arrive, they confirm that Star is their missing circus dog Binky, and Mildred is devastated to have to turn her beloved dog over to them, particularly as it is clear that he desperately wants to stay with Mildred.

Losing the talented Star and having to return to using the terrified Tabby as her broom companion ruins Mildred&#x27;s recent flying skills, and with her confidence shattered she also sinks back to her previous position at the bottom of most of her classes. After several months she sneaks out very early one morning along with Enid and Maud to go find Star at the Brilliantines&#x27; circus and see how he is doing. Star&#x27;s excited barking at seeing Mildred wakes the Brilliantines, who understand why Mildred would want to visit her former pet, and give the girls a tour of their circus. As well as Star the circus features a horse and a seal. The Brilliantines concede that the circus life is hard on the animals, but that they can&#x27;t give them up, as without them they would have lost most of their acts.

Mildred makes a second visit on her own with the purpose of casting the animal-speaking spell she previously invented on all three animals, all of whom beg her to take them away from the circus. She promises them that she will, but it is weeks before Enid hits of the idea of offering the Brilliantines a set of enchanted brooms and brushes to use in their acts instead of the animals. The Brilliantines love the magical items, and cheerfully sign the animals over to Mildred, who attempts to teleport the seal to her colony in Grim Cove (though she accidentally teleports it to the school&#x27;s new swimming pool, and Miss Hardbroom has to remedy this later), and takes Star and the horse Merlin back to school.

At school Mildred tries to convince Miss Cackle and Miss Hardbroom to let her keep Star and for the school to adopt Merlin. Ethel complicates matters by telling the teachers about how Mildred and her friends traded enchanted items for them, hoping to get Mildred in trouble both for stealing school property and for &#x27;trivial usage of magic&#x27;. Ultimately, though, Miss Cackle convinces Miss Hardbroom that using magic to find a way to free her pet and other animals from an unpleasant life of servitude could hardly be considered &#x27;trivial&#x27;, and that Mildred&#x27;s inventiveness and determination to solve problems are attributes that should not be overlooked...

At the final day of term&#x27;s prizegiving event for Fourth Years Ethel unsurprisingly sweeps all of the academic awards, though Maud manages to win the prize for Team Spirit, which delights her and the entire school (aside from Ethel). However, when it comes to the award for Head Girl everyone is shocked when Miss Cackle announces that Mildred Hubble will be next year&#x27;s Head Girl. When she finally gets over her amazement Mildred picks Enid to be her deputy. After prizegiving ends and the girls prepare to head home, Mildred, Maud and Enid are shocked once again when Miss Hardbroom congratulates them personally, albeit in her own acerbic manner.

==Setting==
The stories mainly take place within the walls of Miss Cackle&#x27;s Academy for Witches, a girls-only boarding magic school that is described in the books as a stone castle on top of a mountain, surrounded by pine forest.

The school year is divided into two terms: the Winter term (September–January) and the Summer term (March–July), with a month&#x27;s holiday between them. Students start at Cackle&#x27;s at the age of 12 and finish at the age of 17 for a total of five school years. The students arrive at the start of the term by flying broomsticks, except for the new first years, who walk through the walker&#x27;s gate as they can&#x27;t fly yet. Halfway through the first term, the first years are each presented with a black kitten – Mildred receives a grey-and-black tabby cat as they apparently ran out of purely black cats – which they teach to ride the broomstick. The first book postulates that the cats weren&#x27;t for any practical purpose except to keep tradition going, and in &quot;Wishing Star&quot;, a group of elder witches note that there is no restriction on what animal a witch must have as her flight companion, with cats only being traditional as they are discreet and easy to care for, which leads to Mildred being permitted to fly with her dog, Star, after he shows greater broom aptitude than her cat Tabby. At the end of the first year, each pupil receives a copy of &quot;The Popular Book of Spells&quot;, a three-inch thick volume bound in black leather. This was not really to be used, as they already had paperback editions for the classroom, but like the cats, it&#x27;s another piece of tradition. At the end of the fifth and final year, students sit the exams for the W.H.C. (Witches&#x27; Higher Certificate), and most pupils were awarded with the certificate.

The first book says that the school winter uniform is composed of &quot;black gymslips, black stockings, black hob-nailed boots, grey shirts and black-and-grey ties&quot;. The first book also postulates that &quot;the only touches of colour [on the uniforms] were the sashes round their gymslips – a different colour for each house, although the houses are not named – and the school badge, which was a black cat sitting on a yellow moon&quot;. In the summer term, originally the girls wore grey-and-black checked dresses, but this was changed from &quot;Worst Witch All At Sea&quot; onwards to a simple black dress as Ms Hardbroom felt that the original design was too frivolous.

==Characters==
==Adaptations==
===Television film===

In 1986, the first book in the series was converted to a made-for-television film on ITV starring Fairuza Balk, Tim Curry, Diana Rigg, and Charlotte Rae. Though a British film, it also aired in the USA on HBO. The film followed the plot of the first book of the series, portraying the incidents of Mildred turning herself invisible and turning Ethel into a pig, Miss Cackle&#x27;s evil twin sister Agatha plotting to take over the school, and the Grand Wizard viewing the Halloween Broomstick formation (sabotaged by Ethel&#x27;s faulty broom she lent to Mildred). It was shot at St. Michael&#x27;s College in Tenbury Wells. This holiday special later aired on the Disney Channel every year for Halloween until the late 1990s. Its opening song, &quot;Growing Up Isn&#x27;t Easy&quot;, was sung by Bonnie Langford; its music was composed by Charles Strouse and its lyrics were written by Don Black. Their other musical number was &quot;Anything Can Happen on Halloween&quot;, sung by Tim Curry. Denis King composed its incidental music score and also wrote the song &quot;My Little School&quot;.

===Television series (1998–2001)===
&quot;The Worst Witch&quot;, a TV series based on the books, starring Georgina Sherrington and Felicity Jones as Mildred Hubble and Ethel Hallow respectively, was broadcast from 1998 to 2001. It was shot in Montreal, London and Cardiff. The series is mostly shot in studio in London, with some episodes filmed in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The exteriors of Cackle&#x27;s Academy used Castell Coch, a castle located near Cardiff. The courtyard was filmed at Loseley Park, near Guildford. Inside the school (Great Hall, classrooms etc.) was filmed at Twickenham Studios.

====Spin-offs====
When it was no longer realistic that Mildred would still be at school, the series relocated her to a magical university in Cambridge and was retitled &quot;Weirdsister College: The Further Adventures of the Worst Witch&quot; and saw the return of Felicity Jones as a reinvented Ethel Hallow.

In 2004, a new series based on the 1998 series was made, entitled &quot;The New Worst Witch&quot;. It centred on the adventures of Mildred&#x27;s equally bungling cousin, Henrietta &quot;Hettie&quot; Hubble, played by Alice Connor, also set at Cackle&#x27;s Academy.

===Television series (2017–2020)===
A new version of &quot;The Worst Witch&quot; TV series began in 2017 airing on CBBC (later made available on Netflix) and concluded in 2020, this one starring Bella Ramsey as Mildred Hubble (replaced by Lydia Page in the fourth season so that Ramsey could focus on personal issues), Claire Higgins as Miss Cackle, and Raquel Cassidy as Miss Hardbroom.

===Stage adaptation (2018–2019)===
A musical stage production called &quot;The Worst Witch Live&quot;, adapted by Emma Reeves from Murphy&#x27;s original books, was shown at the Royal &amp; Derngate Theatre in Northampton from 27 November to 30 December 2018. In February 2019, the show began to tour the UK across 16 different venues. &quot;The Worst Witch Live&quot; by Kenny Wax Family Entertainment was shown at the Vaudeville Theatre in the West End from 24 July to 8 September 2019. The original cast included Danielle Bird, Polly Lister, Rachel Heaton, Rebecca Killick, Rosie Abraham, Anna Crichlow, Molly-Grace Cutler, Megan Leigh Mason, Emma Lau, and Meg Forgan.

This version is presented as a publicity play written by Mildred and acted out by the students and staff playing themselves, initially recreating Mildred&#x27;s first year at school, although the second half takes on a metafictional angle as Agatha Cackle &quot;infiltrates&quot; the play and attempts to stage a coup of the magical government. The stage production received a 2020 Olivier Award for best family show.

<doc id="848750" wikidata="Q7561785" url="?curid=848750" title="Sonic Animation">
<text>Sonic Animation (stylised as sonicanimation) are an Australian dance and techno musical group which was formed by Adrian Cartwright on keyboards, drums and programming and Rupert Keiller on lead vocals and programming in 1994. The group disbanded in 2006 and then reformed in 2011. Altogether, they have released five studio albums, &quot;Silence Is Deafening&quot; (May 1997), &quot;Orchid for the Afterworld&quot; (October 1999), &quot;Reality by Deception&quot; (2002), &quot;Defective Perspective&quot; (2004) and &quot;Once More from the Bottom&quot; (March 2013).

== History ==
===1994–1998: Formation and &quot;Silence Is Deafening&quot;===
Sonic Animation were formed in Melbourne by Steve Bertschik as a DJ, Adrian Cartwright on drums, keyboards and programming and Canadian-born Rupert Keiller on lead vocals and programming in 1994. Cartwright on drums and Keiller on vocals were both members of Scarlet Garden, a rock group formed in the early 1990s in Geelong. The pair had met as employees at a local graphic design business.

Cartwright recalled &quot;I absolutely hated dance music ... But Rupert took me to a rave, and that was it for me. I&#x27;d always thought that dance music was so minimalist and easy, but when you get into it it&#x27;s actually quite intricate and complex. I loved that. And then when we heard what Underworld were doing with vocals, we wanted to do that, too.&quot; In 1995 Sonic Animation released their debut single, &quot;Time Is an Illusion&quot;, on a self-funded independent label. They followed with &quot;From Sand to Stars&quot;, &quot;Zero Zero Zero Zero One&quot; and &quot;Force Feed&quot;.

Their debut studio album, &quot;Silence Is Deafening&quot;, was issued on Azwan Transmissions in May 1997. All the tracks were written, produced and engineered by Sonic Animation. At that time they were using a 386 computer for programming. In March 2002 Keiller recalled how &quot;people would yell out &#x27;nice one 386!&#x27;, cos you know, we didn&#x27;t really do anything, it was all just the computer. There are still some people that hold that view but we don&#x27;t see it as much because of the kind of shows we play these, days.&quot; Bertschik left the group in 1998 to &quot;pursue his own musical interests.&quot; The band signed with a new label: Global Recordings / Festival / FIIDO.

===1999–2005: Commercial success===
In January 1999 the group issued a single, &quot;Love Lies Bleeding&quot;, which reached the ARIA Singles Chart top 50. Jasper Lee of Oz Music Project felt that it &quot;builds up into full blown dance goodness with no doubt an anthem to club culture with the main vocal&quot;. Its lyrics contain a reference to illegal drugs, &quot;I feel ecstasy&quot;. This initially concerned Keiller &quot;I used to be worried about that sort of stuff — I don&#x27;t know why — but nothing so far has happened.&quot; &quot;Theophilus Thistler&quot; was released as a single in August 1999, which received high rotation on national radio station, Triple J, its popularity was assisted by the track&#x27;s associated music video. The video featured their two mascots, or TechoTubbies, dubbed Robert Roley and Theophilus Thistler. At live performances the mascots&#x27; suits are worn by two fans selected by the band via their web site. &quot;Theophilus Thistler&quot; appeared on the ARIA Singles Chart top 100 and was listed at No. 18 on the Triple J Hottest 100, 1999, in a listeners poll.

The group&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Orchid for the Afterworld&quot;, was issued on 11 October 1999 on Global Records which peaked at No. 42 on the ARIA Albums Chart. In 2005 the album was certified gold for shipment of 35,000 copies by ARIA. Lee attended their gig in April 2000 at Macquarie University, he noticed &quot;a weird mix of a rave and a mosh, with those up the front of the crowd firmly squashed in against the foldback speakers. Nonetheless everyone was having a great time, and enjoyed what Sonic Animation had to offer.&quot;

Sonic Animation&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Reality by Deception&quot;, was released on 4 February 2002, which peaked at No. 22 on the ARIA Albums Chart and No. 6 on the ARIA Dance chart. Lee felt the album &quot;pares back the more commercially-friendly vocals... in favour of more straight trance-light tracks more akin to their clubbing roots... [They] have flowed with a different aim in mind that has seen a decent, although not terribly inspiring release.&quot; It provided the singles, &quot;E-Ville&quot; (October 2001), &quot;I&#x27;m a DJ&quot; (February 2002) and &quot;Super Showbiz Star&quot; (April 2002). &quot;I&#x27;m a DJ&quot; was listed at No. 74 on the Triple J Hottest 100, 2002.

Sonic Animation&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Defective Perspective&quot; was released on 9 February 2004, which provided the singles, &quot;This Is not a Love Poem&quot; and &quot;Get Up&quot;. &quot;This Is not a Love Poem&quot; was based on lyrics by Philip Norton. Leasa de Klerk of &quot;InTheMix&quot; felt that the two CDs provided a &quot;sheer variety of styles and sounds that are on the album. The guys are really showing their flexibility in their offering.&quot;

Sonic Animation announced their break-up in mid-2005 with the release of compilation album, &quot;Eleven&quot; (September 2005), which appeared on the ARIA Dance Albums Chart top 25. It was followed by the Bugger Off tour. They made their last festival appearance at the Big Day Out in 2006 (Australian shows only).

===2011–present: reformation and &quot;Once More from the Bottom&quot;===
In 2011 Cartwright and Keiller revealed a new Sonic Animation remix for world music outfit, Delhi 2 Dublin. They announced that they were back in the studio recording their next album.

In March 2013, after an almost six-year hiatus, Sonic Animation released their fifth studio album, &quot;Once More from the Bottom&quot;. Adam Barbuto of &quot;Reverb&quot; noticed that &quot;you get the feeling the lads from Sonic Animation have thrown their all into these songs and take this comeback super seriously. To somewhat refute any lack of confidence buyers may have had in the naming of the album, &quot;Once More from the Bottom&quot;, I can safely say SonicAnimation are anywhere near it. In fact I’d say they are back on track and heading for those big city lights.&quot; &quot;Rip It Up!&quot;″s Simone Keenan felt that &quot;Although there’s plenty of odd-ball tracks ... there is some quality too like the hip hop/dubstep &#x27;Punk on the Dance Floor&#x27; (which sounds better than the title may suggest) and &#x27;Take It from Me&#x27; which features guest vocals from Canadian songstress Sexton Blake. Dub, techno, funk, house... You’ll find all of it on here.&quot; The album provided the single, &quot;I Will Be Twisted&quot;; its music video was created with fan-submitted footage taken on cell phones at the 2012 Homebake festival.

From 1947, he was Professor for architecture at Technische Hochschule Karlsruhe (today Karlsruhe Institute of Technology).

==Biography==
Eiermann was born in (now part of Babelsberg, Potsdam), the son of Wilhelm Eiermann (1874–1948), a locomotive engineer and his wife Emma Gellhorn (1875–1959). He archived his Abitur at the Althoff-Gymnasium and studied architecture at Technische Universität Berlin. From 1925 to 1928, he was master student of Hans Poelzig. After graduating in 1928, he gained professional experience in the construction departments of Karstadt AG in Hamburg and the Berlin electricity works (). From 1931 to 1945, he was an independent architect in Berlin and initially planned residential buildings. Before World War II he had an office with fellow architect . During the Nazi era, he mainly created industrial architecture. In 1945, he escaped to Buchen in West Germany, the birthplace of the father. From 1946 to 1965, he had a shared office with Robert Hilgers. In 1948, the office was relocated to Karlsruhe. He joined the faculty of the Technische Hochschule Karlsruhe in 1947, working there on developing steel frame construction methods. Students were Oswald Mathias Ungers and . During a study trip to the United States in 1950, he met Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer and Konrad Wachsmann in Boston, and in 1956 also Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. In 1967, Eiermann chaired the jury in the architectural competition for the Olympic Park in Munich.

==Personal life==
In 1940, he married in Berlin interior designer Charlotte, Friedheim (1912–2001) and in 1954 in Berlin architect Brigitte, née Feyerabendt (1924–2019). He had two children: with his first wife Andreas (born 1942), from his second marriage Anna (born 1956).

He died in Baden-Baden, aged 65. He is buried at the Buchen Cemetery.

==Works==
During the years of reconstruction, his steel-frame industrial buildings became exemplary. The buildings are transparent, inviting, democratic, making order visible.

A functionalist, his major works include: the textile mill at Blumberg (1951); the West German pavilion at the Brussels World&#x27;s Fair (with Sep Ruf, 1958); the Embassy of Germany, Washington, D.C. (1958–1964); the highrise &quot;Langer Eugen&quot; for the German Parliament in Bonn (1965–1969); the IBM-Germany Headquarters in Stuttgart (1967–1972); and, the Olivetti building in Frankfurt (1968–1972). By far his most famous work is the new church on the site of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in Berlin (1959–1963).

The sets of the 1926 film &quot;The Pink Diamond&quot; were designed by Eiermann.

<doc id="848778" wikidata="Q705117" url="?curid=848778" title="Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix">
<text>Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix (22 – 62 AD) was one of the lesser known figures of the Julio-Claudian dynasty of ancient Rome.

==Life==
Felix was the son of Domitia Lepida the Younger and the suffect consul of 31, Faustus Cornelius Sulla Lucullus, a descendant of the Dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla. His maternal grandparents were Antonia Major and Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus. His maternal grandmother Antonia Major was a niece of the emperor Augustus and his mother, Domitia Lepida, was a great-niece of Augustus, being a granddaughter of Augustus’ sister Octavia the Younger and the triumvir Mark Antony. Felix was a maternal younger half-brother of the empress Valeria Messalina.

In 47 the emperor Claudius, who was his mother&#x27;s cousin, arranged for Felix to marry his daughter, Claudia Antonia. Antonia bore Felix a son, who was reportedly frail and died before his second birthday. The boy&#x27;s first birthday was celebrated privately. Felix&#x27;s attachment to the imperial family brought him an early consulship in 52.

In 55, the year after the accession of the emperor Nero, the imperial freedman Pallas and the Praetorian prefect Sextus Afranius Burrus were accused of conspiring to have Felix declared emperor. The conspirators were put on trial, but Felix does not appear to have been implicated. Nero, however, began to watch his brother-in-law closely, afraid of his connection to the imperial family.

In 58 another imperial freedman falsely accused Felix of plotting to attack Nero, possibly at the latter&#x27;s instigation. Nero treated Felix as proven guilty, had him exiled in 59 and confined to Massilia (modern Marseille, France). Finally in 62, the palace guardsman Tigellinus sent assassins to kill Felix. Felix was murdered at dinner, five days after Tigellinus gave his orders, and his head transported to the palace. At times, Nero would tease his head, due to his baldness and greyness of his hair. The historian Tacitus described Felix&#x27;s character as &quot;timid and despicable&quot; and also stated that Felix was incapable of plotting against Nero.

Now a widow, Claudia Antonia was sought as a wife by Nero, after the death of his second wife, the Empress Poppaea Sabina. When Claudia Antonia refused, Nero had her charged with attempted rebellion and executed her.

<text>The fourteenth edition of the South American Championship of football was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina from 27 December 1936 to 1 February 1937.

The participating countries were Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay thus making this the first edition in which more than five teams took part of the event.

Bolivia, and Colombia (a new CONMEBOL member) withdrew from the tournament.

Because of the summer heat, most of the matches were played at night, with Estadio Gasómetro being one of the few stadiums in Argentina with artificial lighting at the time, while other games were played during daytime at Estadio Alvear y Tagle.

==Squads==

<text>The Mercer Girls or Mercer Maids were women who chose to move from the east coast of the United States to the Seattle area in the 1860s at the invitation of Asa Mercer. Mercer, an American who lived in Seattle, wanted to &quot;import&quot; women to the Pacific Northwest to balance the gender ratio. The women were drawn by the prospect of moving to a boomtown with a surplus of bachelors. These events formed the basis of the television series &quot;Here Come the Brides&quot;.

==First expedition==
Frontier Seattle attracted numerous men to work in the timber and fishing industries, but very few single women were willing to relocate by themselves to the remote Pacific Northwest. Only one adult out of ten was a woman, and most girls over 15 were already engaged. White men, and women of the Salish tribes, did not always feel mutually attracted. Prostitutes were also scarce, until the arrival of John Pennell and his brothel from San Francisco.

In 1864, Asa Mercer decided to go east to find women willing to relocate to Puget Sound. Mercer first enlisted prominent local married couples to act as hosts for the women once they arrived to assuage Victorian era moral concerns over the propriety of importing single women to the frontier. Mercer also had support from the governor of Washington Territory, but the government could not offer any money.

Mercer proceeded to travel to Boston and later to the textile town of Lowell and recruited eight young women from Lowell and two from the nearby community of Townsend, willing to move to the other side of the country. They traveled back through the Isthmus of Panama, although in San Francisco locals tried to convince the girls to stay there instead. They arrived in Seattle on May 16, 1864, where the community staged a grand welcome on the grounds of the Territorial University.

Only eleven women undertook the journey, well under the fifty initially reported in &quot;The Seattle Gazette&quot;. The Mercer Girls of the first voyage were Annie May Adams, Antoinette Josephine Baker, Sarah Cheney, Aurelia Coffin, Sarah Jane Gallagher, Maria Murphy, Elizabeth Ordway, Georgia Pearson, Josephine Pearson, Catherine Stevens, and Katherine Stickney. Daniel Pearson and Rodolphus Stevens, the fathers of three of the young women, completed the westward party.

All but two of the women were married in short order: Josie Pearson who died unexpectedly a short time after she arrived, and Lizzie Ordway, the oldest of the ladies who was 35 when she arrived in Seattle with Mercer. Mercer was subsequently elected to the Territorial Legislature.
==Second expedition==
Mercer decided to try again on a larger scale in 1865, and again collected donations from willing men. He asked for $300 to bring a suitable wife and received hundreds of applications. However, in the aftermath of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, his next trip east went wrong, until speculator Ben Holladay promised to provide transport for the women. However, the &quot;New York Herald&quot; found out about the project and wrote that all the women were destined to waterfront dives or to be wives of old men. Authorities in Massachusetts were not sympathetic, either.

Due to the bad publicity by the time Mercer was to depart on January 16, 1866, he had fewer than 100 recruits, when he had promised five times that many. His ship, the former Civil War transport S.S. &quot;Continental&quot;, sailed for the West Coast around Cape Horn.

Three months later, the ship stopped in San Francisco, where the captain refused to go any further. Mercer failed to convince him otherwise, and when he telegraphed to Washington governor Pickering to ask for more money, the governor could not afford it. Finally, he convinced crewmen on lumber schooners to transport them for free. Among the financiers of the expedition had been Hiram Burnett, a lumber mill manager for Pope &amp; Talbot, who was bringing out his sister and wanted wives for his employees. A few of the women decided to stay in California instead.

When Mercer returned to Seattle, he had to answer a number of questions about his performance. At a meeting on May 23, public dismay softened, probably because the women were with him.

Mercer ended up marrying one of the women, Annie Stephens, a week later, and most of the others found husbands as well.

<text>The SPHL (formerly the Southern Professional Hockey League) is a professional ice hockey independent minor league based in Huntersville, North Carolina, with teams located primarily in the southeastern United States as well as Illinois and Indiana in the midwestern United States.

Following the 2023–24 season, the Peoria Rivermen are the reigning President&#x27;s Cup champions. , the Knoxville Ice Bears are the most successful team in SPHL history, having won five William B. Coffey Trophies as the regular season champions and four President&#x27;s Cup playoff championships. The Peoria Rivermen have also won five William B. Coffey Trophies, while Pensacola has also won four President&#x27;s Cups.

== History ==
The SPHL&#x27;s history traces back to three other short-lived leagues. The Atlantic Coast Hockey League started play in the 2002–03 season. After its only season, the ACHL dissolved with member teams forming the nucleus for two rival leagues, the South East Hockey League and the World Hockey Association 2. After one season, the SEHL and WHA2 disbanded, with their surviving teams rejoining with two expansion teams to form the SPHL, commencing with the 2004–05 season.

In 2009, the SPHL saw a large expansion with three new franchises, in Biloxi, Mississippi, Lafayette, Louisiana and Pensacola, Florida. In 2010, the league added an expansion team in Augusta, Georgia, another former long time ECHL market. For the 2011–12 season, the league added two-time Central Hockey League champions, the Mississippi RiverKings. For the 2013–14 season, the league lost the Augusta RiverHawks but also expanded northward with two franchises in Illinois: the Bloomington Thunder, a team also moving from the CHL, where they were known as the Bloomington Blaze, and the Peoria Rivermen, who were replacing an American Hockey League team of the same name in their market. In 2015, the Augusta franchise returned and relocated to Macon, Georgia as the Macon Mayhem.

In November 2014, Shannon Szabados became the first female goaltender to win an SPHL game, when the Columbus Cottonmouths defeated the Fayetteville FireAntz 5–4 in overtime. In that same game Erin Blair and Katie Guay became the first female officials to referee an SPHL game.

At the end of the 2015–16 season, the Louisiana IceGators announced a one-year leave of absence for renovations to their arena but never returned. The IceGators&#x27; franchise was sold and reactivated as the Quad City Storm in 2018. Then in 2016, the dormant Mississippi Surge franchise was relocated to Southwest Virginia to become the Roanoke Rail Yard Dawgs. One of the inaugural SPHL teams, the Columbus Cottonmouths, suspended operations in 2017 after failing to find a buyer while an expansion team called the Birmingham Bulls were accepted into the league as the tenth team. Following the 2017–18 season, the Mississippi RiverKings suspended operations while the league searched for new owners. With the acceptance of the Quad City Storm, the league was able to remain at ten teams for the 2018–19 season.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2019–20 season was curtailed and no champion was named. The following season, the league announced it would only play with five of the ten member teams due to pandemic-related capacity restrictions barring fans from attending games. During the season, the league approved of the Vermilion County Bobcats as a 2021–22 expansion team based in Danville, Illinois. The Bobcats folded after only a year and a half.

In 2023, the league rebranded to the orphaned initialism &quot;SPHL&quot; to reflect the fact that the league&#x27;s footprint had expanded beyond the southern United States.

* A mouthpiece is required for all players except the goaltender.
* No curvature of stick limitations as in the NHL, AHL, and ECHL.
* Shootouts are five players. After five different players have made an attempt, teams may reuse anyone including those who have previously attempted in later rounds, even using the same player in consecutive rounds if desired.

===President&#x27;s Cup===
Awarded to the league playoff champion.


===William B. Coffey Trophy===
Originally known as the Commissioner&#x27;s Cup, the regular season championship trophy was renamed in honor of league co-founder Bill Coffey during the 2007–08 season.

<doc id="848805" wikidata="Q1015796" url="?curid=848805" title="Victor Harbor, South Australia">
<text>Victor Harbor is a town in the Australian state of South Australia located within the City of Victor Harbor on the south coast of the Fleurieu Peninsula, about south of the state capital of Adelaide. The town is the largest population centre on the peninsula, with an economy based upon agriculture, fisheries, and tourism. It is a popular tourist destination, with the area&#x27;s population greatly expanded during the summer holidays, usually by Adelaide locals looking to escape the summer heat.

The coast stretching for around from west of Victor Harbor along to Goolwa is often referred to as the South Coast, especially among surfers, as many of the beaches on this stretch are popular surfing spots.

It is a popular destination with South Australian high school graduates for their end of year celebrations, known colloquially as schoolies.

== History ==
Victor Harbor lies in the traditional lands of the Ramindjeri clan of the Ngarrindjeri people.

Matthew Flinders in visited the bay on 8 April 1802, while on the first circumnavigation of the continent, mapping the unsurveyed southern Australian coast from the west. He encountered Nicolas Baudin in &quot;Le Geographe&quot; near the Murray Mouth several kilometres to the east of the present day location of Victor Harbor. Baudin was surveying the coast from the east for Napoleonic France. Although their countries were at war, each captain was given documents by the other nation&#x27;s government, stating that the ships were on scientific missions, and were therefore not to be regarded as ships of war. Together, the ships returned to the bay and sheltered, while the captains compared notes. Flinders named the bay Encounter Bay after the meeting.

In 1837, Captain Richard Crozier who was en route from Sydney to the Swan River Colony in command of , anchored just off Granite Island and named the sheltered waters in the lee of the island &#x27;Victor Harbor&#x27; after his ship. At about the same time, two whaling stations were established, one at Rosetta Head, popularly known as &quot;the Bluff&quot;, and the other near the point opposite Granite Island. Whale oil became South Australia&#x27;s first export. From 1839, the whaling station was managed for a time by Captain John Hart, a later Premier of South Australia. The last whale was caught off Port Victor in 1872.

=== The town, the harbour, and spelling ===
The town of Port Victor was laid out on the shores of Victor Harbor in 1863 when the horse-drawn tramway from Goolwa was extended to the harbour.

The municipality of the town of Victor Harbor was proclaimed on 7 May 1914, with Oliver Alexander Baaner appointed the first mayor.
The township of Victor Harbor was proclaimed in 1914 with the spelling &quot;Harbor&quot;.

The harbour was proclaimed on 27 May 1915 under the &quot;Harbors Act 1913&quot;, and its name established on 15 June 1921 as &quot;Victor Harbor&quot;. The name of the harbour was changed in June 1921 from Port Victor as a result of a near shipwreck blamed on confusion with Port Victoria on the Yorke Peninsula.

The spelling of Victor Harbor, spelled without a &quot;u&quot; is a curiosity as &quot;harbour&quot; normally retains the &quot;u&quot; in Australian English. This spelling is found in several geographical names in South Australia, including Outer Harbor and Blanche Harbor. According to the State Library of South Australia, the lack of the &quot;u&quot; is not influenced by American spelling, but archaic English spelling. The name is not consistently applied. The &quot;Victor Harbor Times&quot; used &quot;Harbour&quot; in its masthead from 1922 to 1978, before reverting to &quot;Harbor&quot;. The Victor Harbour railway station is spelt with the &quot;u&quot;.

===Entertainment===
In 1923, two picture palaces opened in Victor Harbor: the Victor Theatre in Ocean Street on 24 November (still operating today as the Victa Cinema; see below), and the Wonderview near the beachfront, opposite the Soldiers&#x27; Memorial Gardens, on 22 December 1923.

On 26 December 1936, a one-off motor race meeting was held to the east of the town to commemorate the centenary of South Australia – the South Australian Centenary Grand Prix, often referred to as the 1937 Australian Grand Prix. The circuit was made of public roads, measured 12.6 kilometres in length and featured two long straights, two short straights, and several corners, including the banked Nangawooka Hairpin. The winners of the 240-mile Grand Prix, which was held as a handicap, were Les Murphy in an MG P-type, Tim Joshua in another P-type, and Bob Lea-Wright in a Terraplane Special.

===21st century===
The beaches of Victor Harbor and nearby Port Elliot have been facing rising seas, and more has to be done to stop this.

In November 2023, Victor Harbor mayor Moira Jenkins voiced strong opposition, citing risks to the environment, to a proposal for a $350 million marina in the town. The project is promoted by local businessman Mark Taplin, who has stated that he wants to &quot;enhance Victor Harbor.&quot;

==Governance==
Victor Harbor was declared a city in 2000.

As a local government area, the City of Victor Harbor includes the surrounding rural area and the contiguous township of Encounter Bay as well as the town of Victor Harbor itself. Its total area is 34,463 hectares. It shares boundaries with the District Council of Yankalilla and Alexandrina Council. The city is in the state electoral district of Finniss and the federal Division of Mayo.

== Population ==
In the 2021 Australian census, the resident population in the town (locality) of Victor Harbor was 4,520, of whom 53% were female. Over the summer holiday season the population almost triples. The urban population for the built-up coastal area extending from Victor Harbor to Port Elliot and nearby Goolwa was 28,363.

== Attractions ==

===Granite Island===

A popular site for visitors is Granite Island, which is connected to the mainland by a short tram/pedestrian causeway. The tram service is provided by the Victor Harbor Horse Drawn Tram, one of the very few horse-drawn tram routes remaining in public transit service. Granite island is home to a large colony of little penguins which are a popular attraction on the island. These penguins shelter on the island during the night, departing in the morning to hunt for fish before returning at sunset. This colony of penguins has declined sharply, with only seven found in 2012. It is suspected that an increase in long-nosed fur seals in the area may be to blame; however, incidents such as those in 1998 where locals apparently kicked several of them to death have also contributed. A December 2022 survey estimated 22 birds on the island, with a different study putting the number at 26 that year. After 28 birds were counted in mid-2023, researchers were hopeful of a recovery in numbers.

===Cockle Train===
The SteamRanger Heritage Railway runs train services, most notably &quot;The Cockle Train&quot; between Victor Harbor and Goolwa, along the Victor Harbor railway line.

===Whale-watching and visitor centre===
Between June and September, whale spotting is a popular attraction. Southern right whales come to the nearby waters to calve and to mate. In 1990, Ian Milnes, a marine science teacher, established the original Whale Watch Centre, when there were few whales to be seen owing to the history of whaling from the 1830s until the 1980s, when it was banned. In 1990, there were seven sightings and 13 whales. The following winter, 40 whales were spotted. In 1994, the South Australian Whale Centre was established, with the support of the City of Victor Harbor and the South Australian Museum in a renovated goods shed at the terminus of the Cockle Train railway line. The Railway Goods Shed was built in 1864, and used by early European settlers for storing goods and produce transported along the Murray River and then across the first Australian public railway, to be shipped around the world from Victor Harbor. At one stage, the building housed the horse-drawn trams. After several renovations, including one in 2008, the centre hosts a number of interactive exhibits. In December 2022, after more restoration of the goods shed, the building reopened as a combined Visitor Centre and SA Whale Centre, to be known as &quot;Victor Harbor Visitor Centre&quot;, or &quot;VC&quot;. The centre is open daily from 10am to 4pm apart from Christmas Day.

===Surfing===
Victor Harbor is the centre of the surf zone stretching for around from west of Victor Harbor along to Goolwa, known as the &quot;South Coast&quot; to Adelaide and local surfers. Popular surf beaches in the area include Parsons, Waitpinga, Middleton, and Goolwa. The Granite Island breakwater usually shields the town from waves. Victor Harbor offers numerous fishing opportunities, varying from offshore reefs for larger boat based anglers to excellent surf fishing on the beaches closer to the Murray Mouth.

===Other attractions===
The Urimbirra Wildlife Park is a local attraction with a considerable collection of native, and some domestic, animals.

The Soldiers&#x27; Memorial Gardens on the Esplanade include a park and a war memorial within. Both were heritage-listed on the South Australian Heritage Register in 1985.

Greenhills Adventure Park offered activities including waterslides, canoes, rock wall climbing, archery, mini golf, and go-karting; however this attraction has since closed down on 1 May 2016.

=== Festivals and events ===
This town hosts a three-day schoolies festival in late November mainly for South Australian school leavers. Victor Harbor hosts the second largest schoolies festival in Australia after the Gold Coast, centring around official festival activities in Warland Reserve.

These events are managed by the official event organisers and not-for-profit charity, Encounter Youth, and are supported by the local council, SA Police, SA Ambulance and St Johns SA.

The centre of the town is a dry zone (no alcohol) at night as well as during the Christmas Pageant and New Year&#x27;s Eve.

Another notable event is the Art Show run by the Rotary Club of Victor Harbor and exhibits of paintings are shown from all over Australia. The event is held in January, during the summer holidays, and the 40th Art Show was held in January 2019. It has grown to become Australia&#x27;s largest outdoor art exhibition, with more than 10,000 people attending over nine days.

== Media ==
The main newspaper printed locally is the &quot;Times&quot; (1987–). The newspaper was originally published as &quot;The Victor Harbor Times and Encounter Bay and Lower Murray Pilot&quot;, with the first edition published on Friday 23 August 1912. On 16 May 1930, the title was briefly altered to &quot;Times Victor Harbor and Encounter Bay and Lower Murray Pilot&quot;. From 15 April 1932 until 31 December 1986 it was called &quot;Victor Harbor Times&quot;.

Other historical publications included the short-lived &quot;South Coast News&quot; (4- 25 June 1965), printed by A.H. Ambrose, and its &quot;successor&quot;, &quot;South Coast Sports News&quot; (20 June – 4 July 1969), printed by The Ambrose Press.

The Murray Bridge-based Power FM SA &amp; 5MU both broadcast into Victor Harbor and the Fleurieu Peninsula with a repeater transmitter stationed north of Port Elliot. Many of their programmes and station promotions are based in Victor Harbor and along the Fleurieu Peninsula.

At Power FM&#x27;s launch on 98.7 in Murray Bridge, reception in Victor Harbor and along the Fleurieu Peninsula was very poor due to terrain constraints, so Power FM set up its own transmission site for residents of the Fleurieu, north of Port Elliot in 2002. This operates on 99.7 MHz continually as of September 2024.

5MU, initially on 1458 kHz, then on 1125 kHz AM covered the area from their transmission tower on Gifford Hill, near Murray Bridge, however when 5MU converted to FM in 2021, due to terrain constraints with the FM transmission tower (also on Gifford Hill) the repeater transmitter site in Port Elliot became purposed for both 5MU and Power FM SA and operates the 5MU service on 97.1 MHz 

Some community radio stations operate in the area, including Fleurieu FM, Happy FM and others that focus on areas outside of Victor Harbor but have fortuitous coverage in.

==Picture palaces==
===Victor Theatre / Victa Cinema===

The Victor Theatre was built on the site of Ocean Street Garage, owned by D.H. Griffin &amp; Sons, designed by noted cinema architect Chris A. Smith. It opened under the control of Griffin Pictures on 24 November 1923, seating 700 people. It changed hands in October 1926, being sold to National Theatres (aka National Pictures). After National Theatres went into liquidation in January 1928, its lease was taken over by Ozone Theatres, and the building extensively renovated. A dress circle was added, increasing the seating capacity to 1000 seats.

After a fire gutted the building in early 1934, it underwent reconstruction and extension in September of that year, to designs by F. Kenneth Milne. It is thought to be one of the first buildings in South Australia created in the style known as streamlined, a type of Art Deco that became popular in the 1930s. On 21 December 1934 the Victor Theatre reopened as an Ozone cinema. The cinema had a seating capacity of 910 at the time of its takeover by Hoyts in 1951. It operated restricted opening times from 1960 onwards, and from 1963 closed during the winter.

In 1970 it was acquired by independent operator Roy Denison for , who reopened it as the Victa Theatre. Manager Geoff Stock bought the cinema upon Denison&#x27;s retirement in 1995, and it was fully renovated and renamed Victa Cinema. Twin screens were created in August 1998, with the former balcony screen seating 286, and the screen in the former stalls screen seating 297. In 2005 it was bought by David and Carol Stonnill, who upgraded the building further, while retaining the Art Deco character. In October 2020 the City of Victor Harbor purchased the cinema, intending to include it in the town&#x27;s Arts and Culture centre in the future.

The Victa has been state heritage-listed and retains its Art Deco fittings. It was featured in a photographic exhibition called &quot;Now Showing... Cinema Architecture in South Australia&quot; held at the Hawke Centre&#x27;s Kerry Packer Civic Gallery in April/May 2024.

===Wonderview Theatre===

The Wonderview Theatre was located on Flinders Parade, opposite the Soldiers&#x27; Memorial Gardens. The company selected the name &quot;Wonderview&quot; from 87 public submissions in October 1923. The &quot;Wonderview De Luxe Beach Theatre&quot;, like the Victor, was also designed by Chris A. Smith. It was described as being &quot;palatial&quot;; wider than the older long narrow theatres, with a latticework ceiling containing concealed lighting, comfortable seating that included settees. Its equipment was modern and it included a dance floor made of Queensland hoop pine, a soda fountain, and tea room. It was officially opened on 22 December 1923 by the mayor W. F. Connell with great fanfare, and lauded for its ability to attract more visitors to the town. It was announced that the dance floor would be opened for dancing on Monday and Friday nights. It was licensed to accommodate 696 patrons. A week before the official opening, a children&#x27;s fancy dress parade was held in the building, on 15 December 1923.

The Wonderview was co-owned by a number of local shareholders, and operated by National Pictures Limited, which also operated suburban Adelaide cinemas The National at Prospect, National Pictures in North Adelaide, and the Parkside Picture Pavilion at Parkside. Local man E. G. Fairbairn was appointed manager of the Wonderview in November 1923.

In January 1928, after National Theatres went into liquidation, Ozone Theatres acquired freehold ownership of the building. Although the Wonderview was larger, Ozone concentrated its efforts on the Victor, installing a Western Electric sound system there, and the Wonderview went into a decline. It started closing in the winter months from 1928, and from February 1930 was the home of a government high school during the day, doubling as a dance hall at night.

In January 1931, after the Victor Theatre was damaged by fire and it was closed for the rest of that year, the Wonderview started showing films again, possibly using the sound equipment that had been installed in the Victor the previous year. By December 1931, the Wonderview was used mainly as a dance hall, as well as special fundraising events and showings of films on Wednesdays and Saturdays, including &quot;Tarzan and His Mate&quot;, starring Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan, in October 1934. On 19 September 1934, &quot;Victor Harbour Day&quot;, there was a special screening of films at the Wonderview. By the Christmas-New Year season of 1934, the building was known as the Wonderview Palais, with dancing on most nights, including New Year&#x27;s Eve.

From January 1939, the building was put to a variety of uses, including a tanning salon, J. Miller Anderson &amp; Co. sale, church services, and residences. On 26 December 1941, Ozone Theatres held a gala reopening of the venue, and experienced a new lease of life as a picture theatre during World War II owing to the number of service personnel swelling the population of the town.

The Wonderview was demolished in 1991.

==Other historic buildings==
There are many local and state heritage-listed buildings in Victor Harbor, some of which are mentioned above.

===Adare House===

Adare House ( known Adare Conference Centre) was listed on the South Australian Heritage Register in 1999.

The land on which Adare House was built was known to the Ramindjeri people as &quot;mootiparinga&quot;, meaning murky or brackish water. In the first year of colonial settlement, the colony of South Australia&#x27;s first governor, John Hindmarsh, purchased the land. His son John built a small house on the property in the 1860s.

Daniel Henry Cudmore, a pastoralist and businessman, bought the property in 1889. Based on designs by architect Frederick William Dancker (1852–1936), the original house was rebuilt and expanded it to include 19 rooms, a cellar, a tower, a balcony, and three turrets. It was completed in 1893. It is located on the outskirts of the town, next to the Hindmarsh River. Since the second half of the 20th century, Adare House has been used by the Uniting Church for group camps, and the grounds used as a caravan park. Since the 21st century, the building has been used for weddings and other private functions.

Dancker also designed a residence, Attunga, that is now part of Burnside Hospital; the Queen Victoria Hospital, St Paul&#x27;s Lutheran Church at Hahndorf, and the Malvern Uniting Church.

===Others===
Other buildings listed on the South Australian Heritage Register include:
*St Augustine&#x27;s Anglican Church
*Former Victor Harbor Post &amp; Telegraph Office and Postmaster&#x27;s Residence, now an art gallery
*Victor Harbor Town Hall &amp; Library (formerly Institute)
*National Trust Museum (former Victor Harbor Custom House &amp; Station Master&#x27;s Residence)
*Anchorage Guest House (former Aurora House, later Warringa Guest House), 20-23 Flinders Parade
*Grosvenor Hotel, 32-44 Ocean Street
*BankSA (former Savings Bank of South Australia Victor Harbor Branch)
*Second Newland Memorial Uniting (former Congregational) Church, 20-28 Victoria Street
*Victor Harbor Uniting Church Hall (former First Newland Memorial Congregational Church)

==Climate==
Victor Harbor has a warm summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;). Summer average temperatures are significantly lower than most of the state, due largely to the sea breeze moderating temperatures and hot northerlies rarely extending past the hills north of the city.

<text>Brian Keith Bosworth (born March 9, 1965), nicknamed &quot;the Boz&quot;, is an American actor and former professional football linebacker who played in the National Football League (NFL) for three seasons with the Seattle Seahawks. A two-time Dick Butkus Award winner during his college football career at the University of Oklahoma, he also achieved notoriety for his outspoken comments and antics. Bosworth was selected by the Seahawks in the first round of the 1987 NFL supplemental draft, but his professional career was cut short by injury. After retiring as a player, Bosworth pursued an acting career. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2015.

==Early life==
Brian Bosworth was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He attended MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas, where he was a two-time consensus All-American for the football team. He graduated in 1983. He was recruited to play football for the University of Oklahoma.

==College career==
Bosworth played linebacker for the Oklahoma Sooners for three seasons, from 1984 to 1986. He was recognized as a unanimous All-American in both his sophomore and junior years.

Bosworth was barred from playing in the Orange Bowl following his junior year after he tested positive for steroids. He claimed that his use of steroids was medically prescribed by his doctor because of injuries.

A strong-side inside linebacker throughout his college career, Bosworth was known for raising his level of play in big games. He was regarded as a great tackler, although he was occasionally criticized for tackling too high. The winner of the first two Butkus Awards as the nation&#x27;s top college linebacker, he remains the only player ever to have won the accolade more than once. &quot;College Football News&quot; ranked him No. 30 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest College Players of All-Time&quot;. In October 1999, Bosworth was named to the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; NCAA Football All-Century Team as one of only nine linebackers on the squad.

==College controversies==
Bosworth is known for his radical hairstyles, his on-field play, and his criticism of the NCAA. He was particularly focused on the level of control the NCAA exerted over athletes, preventing them from making money during their college careers.

Because of the steroid suspension, Bosworth was not allowed to play in the post-season 1987 Orange Bowl. During the 3rd quarter of that game, Bosworth pulled off his football jersey to reveal a t-shirt that read, &quot;NCAA: National Communists Against Athletes.&quot; Immediately picked up by the television cameras, this led to much consternation among alumni and administrators at Oklahoma. Aware that Bosworth was likely to be entering the NFL draft anyway, the OU coach, Barry Switzer, dismissed Bosworth from the team.

Bosworth was quoted in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1986 fall football issue as saying that at a summer job at GM&#x27;s Oklahoma City plant, co-workers taught him how to insert the bolts in hard-to-reach places so they would rattle. He told the magazine, &quot;If you own a Celebrity or Century made in 1985 in Oklahoma City, that car is (messed up) if I had anything to do with it&quot;. In addition, he claimed that each bolt carried a note that said: &quot;Aha! You found me!&quot; and said, &quot;I love the thought of people going absolutely crazy, saying &quot;Where is that ... rattle coming from?&quot;&#x27; Some of Bosworth&#x27;s former co-workers who read about it disputed the story. Bosworth reportedly retracted the statement, although he later denied the retraction.

In September 1988, Bosworth wrote an autobiography, &quot;The Boz&quot;, with &quot;Sports Illustrated&#x27;s&quot; Rick Reilly. In it, Bosworth said the Sooner football program was laden with drug use, gunplay in the athletic dorm, and other wild behavior. Although many Sooner boosters dismissed it as the rantings of a resentful ex-player, an NCAA report issued three months later confirmed many of Bosworth&#x27;s claims, and ultimately led to Switzer being forced to resign.

===NFL draft===
Bosworth planned his college coursework so that he could graduate a year early, which would allow him the option to enter the NFL draft a year early. In addition, it would give him some leverage over which team drafted him. Knowing he could go back to Oklahoma if he did not get chosen by a preferred NFL team, Bosworth sent letters to various NFL teams stating that, if they drafted him, he wouldn&#x27;t report to their training camp and he wouldn&#x27;t play for them. As a joke, the Tacoma Stars of the Major Indoor Soccer League selected him in the 12th round in their 1987 draft, as their general manager stated, &quot;Because we didn&#x27;t receive a letter from him that he wouldn&#x27;t play for us.&quot; At one point, Bosworth was interviewed by Bryant Gumbel on &quot;The Today Show&quot; and declared his desire to play for the Los Angeles Raiders saying they best fit his personality.

By getting dismissed from the football team after the Orange Bowl t-shirt incident, Bosworth lost his leverage in trying to control where he would play.

==Professional career==
Bosworth was selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the first round of the supplemental draft in June 1987. Seattle was one of the teams to whom he had sent a letter of disinterest. After initially declaring he would stick to his promise that he would not sign, he signed both the biggest contract in team history and the biggest rookie contract in NFL history at the time: ten years for $11 million. After being drafted, Bosworth sued the NFL for the right to wear number 44 (the number he wore in college) and the Seahawks petitioned for a rules change, due to an NFL rule against linebackers wearing jerseys in the 40s, but were unsuccessful. Bosworth ultimately chose to wear number 55. In 2015, long after Bosworth retired, the NFL changed its rules to allow linebackers to wear jerseys in the 40s.

Bosworth signed with a Seahawks team that had failed to reach the playoffs for two seasons (a 10-6 finish in 1986 was only good enough for 3rd in the AFC West as they lost to the Kansas City Chiefs in head-to-head matchup). He appeared in 12 games in his rookie season, playing well for the most part, but became known more for his outspoken personality and appearance than his actual play on the field. Before the first game of the season, versus the Denver Broncos, Bosworth trash talked Denver quarterback John Elway. At the game, 10,000 Denver fans wore $15 T-shirts reading &quot;What&#x27;s a Boz Worth? Nothing&quot;, but they did not know that Bosworth&#x27;s company manufactured the shirts. Later that season, prior to the Seahawks&#x27; second matchup with the Los Angeles Raiders, Bosworth publicly claimed that he was going to &quot;contain&quot; Raiders running back Bo Jackson. During a red zone play, Jackson received a hand-off and powered through Bosworth&#x27;s attempted tackle to score a touchdown. According to Jackson, when he and Bosworth got to their feet after the play was over, he told Bosworth, &quot;Next time, have bus fare,&quot; infuriating Bosworth. The Raiders went on to win that game, 37–14, thanks in part to Jackson&#x27;s 3 touchdowns and 221 rushing yards.

===Injury===
Bosworth was forced to retire in 1989 after only two seasons, having suffered a shoulder injury in the 1988 season. Team Doctor Pierce E. Scranton Jr. explained that, &quot;Brian was a twenty-five-year-old with the shoulders of a sixty-year-old. He flunked my physical.&quot; In 1993 Bosworth prevailed in a $7 million lawsuit against Lloyd&#x27;s of London. Lloyd&#x27;s position was that Bosworth&#x27;s shoulder was injured as a result of degenerative arthritis which was not covered in his policy. Bosworth maintained his injury was sustained during a single hit.

==Legacy==

On January 9, 2015, Bosworth was announced as one of the inductees to the College Football Hall of Fame class of 2015.

In 2004, Bosworth was picked by voters as the third-worst flop (and by an expert panel as the sixth-worst) on the &quot;Biggest Flops of the Last 25 Years&quot; list by ESPN.

==Commentator and acting career==
Following the end of his football career, Bosworth decided to pursue a career as an actor. He starred in the 1991 action film &quot;Stone Cold&quot; and has had an on-again/off-again film career starring in several low budget titles such as &quot;One Man&#x27;s Justice&quot; that went straight to DVD. In 2005, he had a role as one of the prison-guard football players in the Adam Sandler movie remake &quot;The Longest Yard.&quot; He also starred in &quot;Lawless&quot;, a television series for Fox that was cancelled immediately after its premiere.

In 2001, Bosworth joined the XFL as a color commentator for its television broadcasts. He was assigned to the crew which called games that aired Sunday nights on UPN, which consisted of Chris Marlowe on play-by-play and Chris Wragge and Michael Barkann as the sideline reporters.

Two years later, Bosworth was hired by Turner Sports as a college football studio analyst. Bosworth worked on TBS&#x27; Saturday night game coverage, contributing to pregame, halftime, and postgame coverage alongside studio host Ernie Johnson. He left the position after the 2003 season.

Bosworth has been a guest on numerous episodes of &quot;Chopped&quot; as a judge.

He appeared on episode 1, in the 2010 season of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; as a dining guest.

In August 2014, Bosworth appeared in a Dish Network commercial with fellow former players Matt Leinart and Heath Shuler, depicting them pining for a chance to return to their more successful college days.

Bosworth appeared with Bo Jackson in a Tecmo Bowl-style television advertisement for the Kia Sorento in 2016, which parodied Jackson running through him in their 1987 game.

Bosworth has appeared as the sheriff in the &quot;Fansville&quot; series of Dr Pepper commercials since 2018.

==Personal life==
Bosworth married his high school girlfriend, Katherine Nicastro, in September 1993. The couple had three children before divorcing in 2006. He also has two nephews who played football for the UCLA Bruins. They both were signed as undrafted free agents, one by the Jacksonville Jaguars and one by the Detroit Lions. In 2010, Bosworth became a real estate agent for Sotheby&#x27;s International Realty in their Malibu, California brokerage office.

On July 5, 2008, Bosworth assisted with the rescue of a woman who rolled her SUV east of Winnipeg, Manitoba. In 2009, he administered CPR to a fallen man in a parking lot until medical help arrived.

==&quot;Brian and the Boz&quot;==
In 2014, Brian and The Boz premiered as part of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;30 for 30&quot; series, chronicling Brian Bosworth&#x27;s athletic journey. The film explores Bosworth&#x27;s struggle with the persona he created, known as The Boz; which began to dominate his life. Participants include Barry Switzer, Bosworth&#x27;s former coach, teammates like Tony Casillas, critical of Bosworth&#x27;s autobiography, and Rick Reilly, co-writer of &quot;The Boz.&quot; Close friends and family, such as childhood friend John DiPasquale, Bosworth&#x27;s daughter Hayley, and Sooners fan Jim Ross, also contribute.

<text>The Dillinger Escape Plan is the debut EP by American mathcore band The Dillinger Escape Plan, originally released in 1997 and rereleased by Now or Never Records as NoN.02. Some point between the original pressing and the 2000 reissue, it was repressed with different artwork. The repress (likely repressed in 1998) contains an additional keyboard credit for Steve Evetts, as well as correcting the spelling of his name which was misspelled (as Steve Evets) on the original pressing. The original also has the words &quot;It&#x27;s OK. We&#x27;ll Just Kill Her Too&quot; on the cover/spine which does not appear on the repress.

In 2000 Now or Never Records reissued the EP with three additional live tracks and new artwork. On March 25, 2002, Earache released the original EP without the live tracks, but with the new artwork.

<text>Adwa (; ; also spelled Adowa or Aduwa) is a town and separate woreda in Tigray Region, Ethiopia. It is best known as the community closest to the site of the 1896 Battle of Adwa, in which Ethiopian soldiers defeated Italian troops, thus being one of the few African nations to thwart European colonialism. Located in the Central Zone of the Tigray Region, Adwa has a longitude and latitude of , and an elevation of 1907 meters. Adwa is surrounded by Adwa woreda.

Adwa is home to several notable churches: Adwa Enda-Gebri&#x27;el (built by Dejazmach Wolde Gebriel), Adwa Enda-Maryam (built by Ras Anda Haymanot), Adwa Edna-Medhane`Alem (built by Ras Sabagadis), Adwa Nigiste-Saba /Queen of Sheba secondary school, and Adwa Enda-Selasse. Near Adwa is Abba Garima Monastery, founded in the sixth century by one of the Nine Saints and known for its tenth century gospels. Also nearby is the village of Fremona, which had been the base of the 16th century Jesuits sent to convert Ethiopia to Catholicism.

== History ==
===Origins===
According to Richard Pankhurst, Adwa derives its name from &quot;Adi Awa&quot; (or &quot;Wa&quot;), &quot;village of the Awa&quot;. The Awa are a tribe that was mentioned in the anonymous Monumentum Adulitanum that once stood at Adulis. 

Francisco Alvares records that the Portuguese diplomatic mission passed Adwa, which he called &quot;Houses of St. Michael,&quot; in August 1520.

===18th century===
By 1700, it had become the residence for the governor of Tigray province and grew to overshadow Debarwa, the traditional seat of the Bahr Negash, as the most important town in northern Ethiopia. Its market was important enough to need a &quot;Nagadras&quot;. The earliest known person to hold this office was the Greek immigrant Janni of Adwa, a brother of Petros, chamberlain to Emperor Iyoas I. Adwa was home to a small colony of Greek merchants into the 19th century.

Adwa acquired major importance due to the establishment of a permanent capital at Gondar. As the traveler James Bruce noted, Adwa was situated on a piece of &quot;flat ground through which every body must go in their way from Gondar to the Red Sea&quot;. The person who controlled this plain could levy profitable tolls on the caravans which passed through.

===19th century===
Because of its location on this major trade route, it is mentioned in the memoirs of numerous 19th-century Europeans visiting Ethiopia. These include Arnaud and Antoine d&#x27;Abbadie, Henry Salt, Samuel Gobat, Mansfield Parkyns and Théophile Lefebvre. After the defeat and death of Ras Sabagadis in the Battle of Debre Abbay, its inhabitants fled Adwa for safety. The town was briefly held by Emperor Tewodros II in January 1860, who had marched from the south in response to the rebellion of Agew Neguse, who had burned then fled the town.

After the departure of Tewodros, the town was seized in 1865 by another nobleman, Wagshum Gobaze, who soon claimed the title of Emperor under the name Tekle Giyorgis II. He was subsequently defeated by a rival, Yohannes IV, in a battle fought just outside the town in 1871. 

Giacomo Naretti passed through Adwa in March 1879, after it had been devastated by a typhus epidemic. It had been reduced to a shadow of itself, having about 200 inhabitants.

Adwa&#x27;s was most notably the site of the final battle of the First Italo-Ethiopian War, where the Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II fought to defend Ethiopia&#x27;s independence against Italy in 1896. The town and its environs suffered considerable damage during the fighting. After his visit to the town in 1897, the British journalist Augustus B. Wylde relates that &quot;Wandering about Adowa was a sad business, many of the streets were entirely deserted, the Mahomedan quarter was tenantless and the houses with the exception of two or three were unroofed and in ruins.&quot; 

===20th century===
The Asmara-Addis Ababa telegraph line, constructed by the Italians in 1902-1904, passed through Adwa and had an office there. By 1905 it was considered the third-largest town in Tigray. Telephone service reached Adwa by 1935, but no phone numbers are listed for the town in 1954.

On 6 October 1935, Italian forces entered Adwa, after two days of bombardment had shocked Ras Seyoum Mengesha into a hasty retreat, abandoning large stocks of food and other supplies. The Italian Gavinana Division brought with them a stone monument in honor of the Italian soldiers who had fallen in 1896. This monument was erected immediately after their arrival and inaugurated on 15 October in the presence of General Emilio De Bono. The town had passed from Italian hands before 12 June 1941, when the newly arrived 34th Indian State Force Brigade set up a post office there.

During the Woyane rebellion, 600 territorial troops retreated to Adwa on 22 September 1943. By 1958 Adwa was one of 27 places in Ethiopia ranked as First Class Township. During the 1960s the town was not only an educational center but also an early focus for Tigrayan nationalist dissent, indicated by the fact that all three of the leaders of the Tigrayan People&#x27;s Liberation Front (TPLF) over the 22-year period from 1975 to 1997, Aregawi Berhe, Sebhat Nega, and Meles Zenawi, all came from Adwa and attended the town&#x27;s government school.

Adwa was a frequent target of attacks by the TPLF during the Ethiopian Civil War: in 1978 the TPLF attacked Adwa; in 1979 they unsuccessfully tried to rob the bank. The town was seized by the TPLF in March 1988 before being recaptured by the Ethiopian 604th Army Corps in June 1988. After the Battle of Shire, the town would permanently fall under the control of the TPLF by the end of February 1989. On 23 June 1990, Adwa was bombed from the air by the Ethiopian Air Force, one person was wounded but no fatalities were reported.

===21st century===
During the Tigray War, Adwa was seized by the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) on 24 November 2020, it was recaptured by the TPLF in June 2021. The town was captured again by the ENDF on 18 October 2022.

== Demographics ==
Based on the 2007 national census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA), this town has a total population of 40,500, of whom 18,307 are men and 22,193 women. The majority of the inhabitants said they practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, with 90.27% reporting that as their religion, while 9.01% of the population were Muslim.
The 1994 census reported it had a total population of 24,519 of whom 11,062 were males and 13,457 were females.

==Sports==
Almeda Textile Football Club (ALTEX) was promoted to the Ethiopian National Football League after winning the Ethiopian football club championships held in Mekelle. ALTEX beat Meta Beer Football Club 2-1 in the final. ALTEX is the first club from Adwa town to represent the town in Ethiopian association football history.

<doc id="848828" wikidata="Q1353372" url="?curid=848828" title="Fleurieu Peninsula">
<text>The Fleurieu Peninsula () is a peninsula in the Australian state of South Australia located south of the state capital of Adelaide.

==History==
Before British colonisation of South Australia, the western side of the peninsula was occupied by the Kaurna people, while several clans of the Ngarrindjeri lived on the eastern side. The people were sustained by the flora and fauna of the peninsula, for food and bush medicine. The bulrushes, reeds and sedges were used for basket-weaving or making rope, trees provided wood for spears, and stones were fashioned into tools.

The Fleurieu Peninsula was named after Charles Pierre Claret de Fleurieu, the French explorer and hydrographer, by the French explorer Nicolas Baudin as he explored the south coast of Australia in 1802. The name came into official use in 1911 after Fleurieu&#x27;s great-nephew, Count Alphonse de Fleurieu, visited Adelaide and met with the Council of the Royal Geographical Society of South Australia, which recommended to the state government that the unnamed peninsula terminating in Cape Jervis be given the name Fleurieu Peninsula &quot;in honour of one who is worthy to be remembered in the annals of Australian geography&quot;. The government approved the name later that year.

== Extent ==

The Geographical Names Advisory Committee advised in 2001 that the extent of the peninsula is:that portion of land between Gulf St. Vincent and the Southern Ocean &quot;(sic)&quot;, a line from Aldinga &quot;(sic)&quot; (southern end of Aldinga Bay) to Middleton (eastern end) being the cut-off for the peninsula. This boundary has not to be gazetted at present, and is intended to be the extent of the geographic feature only and is not to be applied to any industry or interest group regional identification.

The coast of the peninsula stretches from around from Sellicks Beach in the north to Middleton in the south-east.

== Features ==
Towns on the peninsula include Victor Harbor, Normanville, Yankalilla and Rapid Bay. Districts include Inman Valley and Hindmarsh Valley. A ferry travels between Cape Jervis, at the tip of the peninsula, and Kangaroo Island. There is surfing on both the west and south facing coasts – known locally to Adelaide surfers as the Mid South Coast and the Far South Coast. Surf spots of note include Waitpinga and Middleton on the Far South Coast.

==Flora and fauna==
In the past, there were extensive swamps and woodlands, which provided habitat and food sources for a range of birds, fish, and other animals, included snake-necked turtles, yabbies, rakali, ducks and black swans. Flora included the native orchid (leek orchid), guinea flower and swamp wattle (Wirilda).

==Ecology and conservation==
The swamps of the Fleurieu Peninsula were listed as critically endangered under the EPBC Act in 2003; however, there is no adopted or made recovery plan for this ecological community, only &quot;Approved Conservation Advice&quot; (2013). Less than four percent of the original swampland remain today.

A group that includes Aboriginal elders and scientists are documenting Aboriginal cultural knowledge for the Fleurieu Peninsula swamps at Yundi, which is about south of Adelaide. The Yundi Nature Conservancy, containing about of swamp, is south-east of McLaren Vale, near Mount Compass. There, Ngarrindjeri elders and scientists from various disciplines share their knowledge and plan for rewilding some more of the peninsula. A seed bank has been created to this end.

<doc id="848834" wikidata="Q5033817" url="?curid=848834" title="Cantigny Park">
<text>Cantigny ( ) is a park in Wheaton, Illinois, west of Chicago. It is the former estate of Joseph Medill and his grandson, Colonel Robert R. McCormick, publishers of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. Open to the public from February through December, Cantigny comprises expansive formal and informal gardens, a historic Georgian-style brick house, a military museum, a visitor center with cafe, a picnic grove with pavilion, an outdoor playground, hiking paths and a 27-hole golf course with driving range, pro-shop and restaurant.

Cantigny attracts more than 330,000 people per year. Visitors may watch a short welcome and orientation film inside the visitor center to learn about the park&#x27;s origin, history, people and present-day features. The visitor center also includes an interpretive wall exhibit, an in-ground scaled model of the 500-acre property, the Medill cafe, and Le Jardin, a caterer-ready facility for lectures, events and rentals.

Concerts, lectures, workshops, festivals, and other events are held at Cantigny throughout the year. Among the site&#x27;s signature events are a summertime Jazz and Wine Festival, Fall Fest in late September, and Christmas at Cantigny from late November to early January. Cantigny is a common place for weddings, outdoor photography, and banquets. School field trip excursions and youth group camping are also offered.

==Origins==
The land was acquired by Joseph Medill as a country estate, which he called &quot;Red Oaks&quot;, in the late 1800s. After his death, the estate passed to his grandson, Colonel Robert R. McCormick. McCormick served in World War I and saw action at the Battle of Cantigny in northern France. After returning home, he renamed the estate &quot;Cantigny&quot; in honor of this battle.

McCormick had no children. When he died in 1955, he left his fortune to establish the McCormick Charitable Trust (now the McCormick Foundation). He also directed that Cantigny should be transformed into a park for the use of the general public. Since then, the McCormick Foundation has used the endowment funds bequeathed by McCormick to operate Cantigny as a public facility. 

==Robert R. McCormick House==
In 1896–1897, Joseph Medill built a 35-room mansion on the estate; it was designed by architect Charles Allerton Coolidge. In underwent renovation and restoration, which completed in 2023. Today the mansion is the Robert R. McCormick House, a historic house which is used as offices and event rental space. The mansion is open to the public only on select dates as part of Cantigny&#x27;s special event schedule.

Among the noteworthy rooms on the first floor are Freedom Hall, Art Deco style hidden service bar, the Drawing Room and Dining Room. These rooms feature original McCormick-era artifacts, including paintings, swords, library books and wallpaper. The second floor is an exhibit space.

==First Division Museum==
During World War I, McCormick served with the First Division of the United States Army—also known as the &quot;Big Red One&quot;. McCormick provided an endowment for the First Division Museum, which was designed by architect Andrew Rebori. The museum has exhibits and artifacts chronicling the First Division&#x27;s service history, not only in World War I, but also in World War II and later U.S. wars. 

On display outside the museum is the area&#x27;s largest collection of tanks and artillery pieces, known as &quot;Tank Park&quot;. The collection includes tanks and armored vehicles from the First World War up to the present day. Visitors are allowed to climb on the vehicles.

The museum&#x27;s &quot;Date with History&quot; series features guest speakers on subjects of interest to the general public and military historians in particular. Speakers include historians, authors, filmmakers and veterans. The presentations are generally open to the public and free of charge.

The museum is also home to the McCormick Research Center, for use by authors, scholars, teachers and students. The center&#x27;s archives contain more than 10,000 works on military history, including secondary works on various battles, campaigns and wars. Included in the primary works are the bound battle records of the First Division in World War I, and the 1st Infantry Division&#x27;s World War II battle records on microfilm. The center&#x27;s Reading Room is open to the public.

==Public Gardens==

The Cantigny estate includes ornamental landscapes and gardens covering about 30 acres. Its features include the Rose and White Gardens, Rock and Gravel Gardens, Logarium, Perennial Border, Hawthorn Path and nearby Fountain Garden and the Idea Garden, designed to educate and inspire home gardeners. The original design of the gardens was the work of German-American landscape architect Franz Lipp. Cantigny is renowned for its extravagant annual plant displays from April to October, centered in the Upper and Lower Formal Gardens, Octagon Garden, Idea Garden and in the &#x27;canoe beds&#x27; in the Colonnade outside the visitor center building. 

Located in USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 5b, plants across Cantigny come out of their winter dormancy beginning in late March. Mid- to late April is the peak of spring floral color with magnolias, viburnums and tulips. The peak of summer color from annual plants is August, with cool-season plants such as mums, kale and pansy on display from mid-September to Halloween. Peak fall foliage color is usually around the second to fourth week of October and varies each year depending on the weather regime.

McCormick and his first wife, Amy, are buried on the grounds. The elaborate gravesite, near the mansion, is known as the Exedra and was designed by Chicago architect Andrew Rebori.

==Golf==

Cantigny Golf Club, owned by the Chicago-based Robert R. McCormick Foundation and managed by KemperSports (Northbrook, Ill.), celebrated 25 years in 2014. When it opened in 1989, &quot;Golf Digest&quot; named Cantigny the &quot;Best New Public Course in America&quot;. Cantigny hosted the 2007 U.S. Amateur Public Links Championship, four Illinois State Amateur Championships (most recently in 2014) and the Chicago Open in 2013 and 2014. The 300-acre Cantigny Golf complex includes 27 holes designed by Roger Packard, the year-round Cantigny Golf Academy, the 9-hole Cantigny Youth Links and a clubhouse with dining and banquet facilities. 

==Film==
The McCormick House and adjacent East Lawn Terraces were used for filming a scene in &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; (1992). Two other movies, &quot;Richie Rich&quot; (1994) and &quot;Baby&#x27;s Day Out&quot; (1994), also include scenes from outside the mansion.

==Location==
Cantigny is located in Wheaton, Illinois, at 1s151 Winfield Road, south of Illinois Route 38 (Roosevelt Road). The entrance to Cantigny Golf is 27w270 Mack Road, also in Wheaton.

<text>Community Transit (CT) is the public transit authority of Snohomish County, Washington, United States, in the Seattle metropolitan area. It operates local bus, paratransit and vanpool service within Snohomish County, excluding the city of Everett. CT is publicly funded, financed through sales taxes, federal grants, and farebox revenue, with an annual operating budget of $231.6 million . In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of , placing it fourth among transit agencies in the Puget Sound region. The city of Everett, which serves as the county seat, is served by Everett Transit, a municipal transit system.

The system, officially the Snohomish County Public Transportation Benefit Area Corporation (SCPTBA), operates a fleet of 282 accessible transit buses, 52 paratransit vehicles, and 362 vanpool vans, maintained at two bus bases in Everett. Service is provided year-round at oiver 1,600 stops on 33 routes throughout the county public transportation benefit area (PTBA). These include three Swift Bus Rapid Transit lines, commuter routes that connect with Link light rail, and service to regional Sound Transit facilities. CT also operates several Sound Transit Express routes within Snohomish County and on the Interstate 405 corridor.
CT began operation as SCPTBA Public Transit on October 4, 1976, four months after voters approved a ballot initiative to establish and fund a new transit system—the third such attempt to create a PTBA. Renamed Community Transit in 1979, the agency expanded service in its first decades of existence, later taking over King County Metro commuter routes to Seattle in 1989 and adding several cities into its PTBA in the 1980s and 1990s. The agency operated commuter service directly to destinations in Seattle until September 14, 2024, shortly after Link light rail was extended to Lynnwood City Center station. CT was the first operator of bus rapid transit in Washington state and introduced &quot;Double Tall&quot; double-decker buses on its commuter routes to Seattle in the early 2010s.

== History ==
=== Early years (1970s) ===

Snohomish County established its public transportation benefit area (PTBA), the first in the state, after municipal corporations for public transportation were added to the Revised Code of Washington by the Washington State Legislature in 1975. The PTBA plan for a countywide bus system was approved during a general election on June 1, 1976, funded by a three-tenths increase of the sales tax rate in member cities.

Snohomish County had previously been served by an interurban railway from Everett to Seattle and coach lines operated by private companies under the Puget Sound Power Company, which were later absorbed by Greyhound. Two previous attempts to establish a bus system, under the Snohomish County Transportation Authority (SNOTRAN) in 1974, were rejected by voters from the entirety of Snohomish County. Heavy opposition came from the residents of Everett because of the high sales tax rate and planned absorption of Everett Transit, acquired by the city in 1969, forcing the SCPTBA to exclude Everett in its successful attempt at creating a bus system. SCPTBA Public Transit began operating in the cities of Brier, Edmonds, Lynnwood, Marysville, Mountlake Terrace, Snohomish and Woodway on October 4, 1976, using 18 leased GMC buses on seven routes carrying 6,414 passengers without fares during the first week.

SCPTBA Public Transit, whose service was known colloquially as the &quot;Blue Bus&quot; for its blue livery, carried 951,200 passengers in its first year of service on 15 local routes and 16 commuter express routes to Downtown Seattle and Northgate, contracted through King County Metro as a continuation of service provided by the Metropolitan Transit Corporation to southern Snohomish County before its merger with Seattle Transit System in 1973. The buses ran for 16 hours a day, charging a base fare of 20 cents (equivalent to $ in 2025). Early on, the busiest local line was Route R14, accounting for 21 percent of system ridership in the first three months, running from the Edmonds waterfront to Lynnwood and the Boeing Everett Factory. The agency acquired its first federal funding from the Urban Mass Transportation Administration for the 1978 fiscal year, to be used on the purchase of 18 new buses as well as bus stop amenities, such as stop signs and shelters.

=== Growth and contracted service (1980s) ===
Community Transit was selected as the official name of the agency on June 19, 1979, recommended by Seattle-based public relations firm McConnell Company ahead of the winners of a public contest held by SCPTBA two years prior. CT continued to grow through the end of the decade, annexing the cities of Arlington, Lake Stevens, Monroe, Granite Falls, Mukilteo, Stanwood and Sultan into the PTBA by 1980; the bus system had the largest growth in ridership within the state in 1980, with local routes gaining 68.3 percent more riders and Metro-operated &quot;Cream Buses&quot; to Seattle gaining 21.4 percent more riders. Metro altered their numbering scheme for Snohomish County routes in 1981, creating the 400-series of routes to coincide with the opening of the state&#x27;s largest park and ride in Lynnwood (which would later become Lynnwood Transit Center). The annexations of outlying communities in northern and eastern Snohomish County and the completion of park and rides in Edmonds and Mountlake Terrace saw ridership rise to over 3 million passengers by 1983.

Community Transit launched its longest commuter route, between Seattle and Stanwood, in October 1987. They took over the remaining Metro commuter routes to Seattle in 1989, after commuter service was subcontracted to American Transportation Enterprises in 1986. The move to a private carrier was opposed by both Metro and the Amalgamated Transit Union, but the introduction of 49 air conditioned coaches by ATE led to a 25 percent increase in ridership by January 1987. Commuter express service via Interstate 405 from CT park and rides in South Snohomish County to the Eastside cities of Bellevue and Redmond began in 1988 and 1990, respectively, while Seattle service was expanded with weekend service in 1990. The agency dedicated its own bus base at Kasch Park in 1985, replacing shared operations with the Edmonds School District and Everett Transit, at a cost of $4.8 million (equivalent to $ in 2025) that was mostly funded by the Urban Mass Transportation Administration.

=== 1990s and 2000s ===

==== Fraud investigation ====
CT was involved in a criminal investigation conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the mid-1990s of Ed&#x27;s Transmission, a transmission shop in Everett used by the agency for bus parts. Detectives from the FBI and Snohomish County Sheriff seized records from both parties and began a two-month audit of Community Transit management. The auditors released a report that criticized the management style of Executive Director Ken Graska and his department heads, leading to the former&#x27;s resignation in December 1993 after nine years at his position. Federal prosecutors accused Ralph Woodall, the 50-year-old co-owner of the shop, of 15 counts of mail fraud after intentionally overbilling for transmission repairs. Community Transit Maintenance Director Michael Lynn resigned after confessing that he had accepted gifts from Woodall in exchange for sending all of CT&#x27;s transmissions to Ed&#x27;s Transmissions without going through competitive bidding. A U.S. District Court jury found Woodall guilty of 15 counts of mail fraud in December 1996, with Judge John C. Coughenour sentencing him to 2.5 years in federal prison the following May, along with Ed&#x27;s Transmission being forced to pay a $825,000 settlement after a civil suit was filed.

==== Proposed consolidations with Everett Transit ====

Attempted mergers of Community Transit with Everett Transit have been proposed by the Washington State Legislature and the CT Board since the formation of SNOTRAN in 1974. The relative success of Community Transit in the late 1970s and 1980s prompted the Community Transit Board to propose consolidation with Everett Transit in 1988, though long-term planning under SNOTRAN for both agencies worked under the assumption that there would be no merger by 2000. In 1990, a second proposal was rejected by the Everett City Council after consultants determined that a merger would only save $350,000 per year in deadheading for Community Transit and that both staffs would need to be retained because of the lack of service duplication between the two agencies. Throughout the 1990s, successive legislative bills proposing a merger were passed through the House Transportation Committee, but failed to gain support elsewhere because of successful lobbying from the City of Everett. State voters approved Referendum 49 in November 1998, including state motor-vehicle excise tax revenue for city-run transit in Everett and Yakima. While Everett Transit gained $4.5 million (equivalent to $ in 2025) in new annual funding, CT was set to lose $1 million (equivalent to $ in 2025) over the next five years in addition to the $2 million (equivalent to $ in 2025) used to operate service within Everett annually. The large cuts brought on by the passing of Initiative 695 and subsequent loss of excise tax revenue forced both agencies to consider merging in 2000, with savings of an estimated $1.7 million per year (equivalent to $ in 2025) according to a study commissioned by Community Transit. As a result of the failed mergers, CT proposed truncating its routes at Everett city limits, but ultimately decided to provide limited-stop service on its routes through Everett to the newly constructed Everett Station in 2002. Community Transit and Everett Transit signed their first partnership agreement in 2007, with Everett helping fund Swift bus rapid transit through its service area and allowing CT to operate the route in exchange for the expansion of ET service into unincorporated areas surrounding Everett. The two agencies further collaborated with Sound Transit and the Washington State Department of Transportation in the construction of the South Everett Freeway Station the following year.

==== Fleet expansions and new services ====
In their most recent expansion in 1997, the Snohomish County PTBA annexed the Eastmont and Silver Firs census-designated places between Everett and Mill Creek, as well as the Tulalip Indian Reservation west of Marysville. During the same year, CT awarded its $31.8 million (equivalent to $ in 2025) commuter service contract to Grosvenor Bus Lines, which would later fold into First Transit, replacing their first subcontractor, Ryder/ATE Management. The agency introduced the first low-floor articulated buses in the United States into its fleet in 1999, purchasing 17 buses from New Flyer to improve accessibility for older and disabled riders. Service improvements throughout the 1990s, including raising service hours to over 11 million, led to ridership peaking at 8.8 million by the end of the decade and the agency&#x27;s 100 millionth rider being celebrated in April 2000. The passage of Initiative 695 in 1999, which capped the state motor-vehicle excise tax at $30, forced transit agencies throughout the state to cut service in anticipation of lower revenue. Facing the loss of $18 million (equivalent to $ in 2025), or 30 percent of its annual operating budget, Community Transit eliminated all weekend service and increased fares on its routes in February 2000. With the service cuts, CT began its VanGO program to donate its retired paratransit minibuses to nonprofit organizations in Snohomish County instead of auctioning them off. Saturday service was reinstated in September 2000, using emergency funds approved by the CT Board, while Sunday service returned in 2001 after the passage of a 0.3 percentage-point tax increase by voters in the PTBA. Further restoration of service came in 2003, with increased frequency and the replacement of 50 buses in the agency&#x27;s fleet made possible by a budget surplus and the sales tax increase approved in 2002, and in 2005, with increased fares.

Community Transit introduced its current logo and slogan in 2005, replacing an older one in use since 1986 and retaining its blue-and-white color scheme, as part of the roll-out of the first New Flyer Invero buses in the United States. CT began a three-month pilot project in September 2005 that brought Wi-Fi access to buses on its longest route, Route 422 between Stanwood and Seattle, with hopes of attracting customers and remote workers to its routes. The pilot project was deemed a success and expanded into the &quot;Surf and Ride&quot; program on all Route 422 trips in 2006, as well as select trips on Routes 406 and 441 from Edmonds to Seattle and Overlake on the Eastside, respectively; the Wi-Fi program was canceled in 2010, with the removal of equipment in buses brought on by low customer response, budget constraints and the adoption of improved cellular networks that support mobile browsing on smartphones.

CT and First Transit signed their third and most recent contract in 2007, continuing the latter&#x27;s operation of CT commuter service to Seattle. Community Transit debuted the first double-decker buses in the Puget Sound region during a year-long test in 2007, eventually buying its own fleet of Alexander Dennis Enviro500s for its &quot;Double Tall&quot; fleet to be used on commuter services. A PTBA expansion into the unincorporated areas of Cathcart, Clearview and Maltby was attempted during the 2008 general elections, but failed to gain a majority vote. In November 2009, after three years of planning and a year of construction, Community Transit debuted the first bus rapid transit line in Washington, Swift. The service replaced Route 100 on State Route 99 between Aurora Village in Shoreline and Everett Station, featuring 12-minute headways, off-board fare payment and transit signal priority.

=== Service cuts and restoration (2010s) ===
The Great Recession of the late 2000s and subsequent loss of an estimated $180 million (equivalent to $ in 2025) in sales tax revenue in Snohomish County forced CT to cut service by 15 percent in June 2010, including the elimination of all service on Sundays and major holidays, to save $16 million (equivalent to $ in 2025) until 2012. A second cut, with 20 percent of service eliminated, took place in February 2012; the CT Board rejected a major restructure that would have truncated its northern and eastern express service to Seattle at Lynnwood Transit Center during this cut, instead opting to preserve its commuter service. Despite the decline in service hours, Community Transit and Sound Transit had record ridership for Snohomish County routes during the Super Bowl XLVIII parade in Downtown Seattle in February 2014, carrying a total of 22,500 passengers on 50 extra trips into Seattle. In March, the 2014 Oso mudslide destroyed a portion of State Route 530 and forced CT to re-route its service to Darrington through Skagit County, offering one-seat service to Smokey Point and Everett Station in the interim as Route 231. The partial reopening of State Route 530 in June and full reopening in September restored the original Route 230 on its original route, now extended to Smokey Point.

Community Transit began restoring cut service in September 2014, adding 13 percent of its former bus hours primarily to improve midday service. In June 2015, CT restored its Sunday and holiday service as part of a 27,000-hour expansion, representing 20 percent of the 2010 reduction, funded by recovering sales tax revenue and a 25-cent increase in fares the following month. The agency was given approval from the state legislature in July 2015 to increase sales taxes by an additional 0.3%, dependent on voter approval via a ballot measure during the November 2015 election that was eventually won, to fund a new Swift line as well as local service expansion. The second Swift route, the Green Line, opened on March 24, 2019, and cost $73 million to construct. It connects the Seaway Transit Center, a new facility next to the Boeing Everett Factory, to Mill Creek and Canyon Park in Bothell. Following the opening of Northgate station on October 2, 2021, the University District routes were truncated to the station to allow for increased service.

Construction of a third bus rapid transit corridor, the Swift Orange Line, began in April 2022. It opened in March 2024, ahead of a major network restructuring that is scheduled to follow the completion of the Lynnwood Link Extension later in the year. Several new express routes will connect with light rail stations in Lynnwood and Mountlake Terrace, replacing service to Downtown Seattle.

=== Regional projects with Sound Transit ===
Community Transit and Everett Transit agreed to break away from SNOTRAN, which served as their planning and administrative body in addition to disbursing federal funding, after CT complained of a &quot;lack of communication&quot; between the three agencies. The county agency formally disbanded on December 31, 1994, replaced by the Joint Regional Policy Committee (JRPC) that formed four years prior to coordinate transit planning for the entire Puget Sound region. A regional transit agency was formed in 1993 under the JRPC, organizing a $6.7 billion (equivalent to $ in 2025) plan for regional transit that was put to a vote on March 14, 1995, failing to pass outside of Seattle, Mercer Island and Shoreline. The plan included a commuter rail line on the BNSF Scenic Subdivision between Everett, Mukilteo, Edmonds and King Street Station in Seattle, a light rail line from Lynnwood to Seattle following Interstate 5, and express bus service to light rail stations. The following November, the smaller &quot;Sound Move&quot; plan was approved at a cost of $3.9 billion (equivalent to $ in 2025), including commuter rail from Everett to Seattle and express buses on Interstate 5 from Everett and Lynnwood to Seattle and Bellevue.

The regional transit agency, renamed to Sound Transit the following year, began operating its Sound Transit Express buses under contract with Community Transit in September 1999. The new express buses connected park and rides in southwestern Snohomish County, the only part of Community Transit&#x27;s service area within the Sound Transit taxing district, to Downtown Seattle, including the newly opened, 1,000-stall Ash Way Park &amp; Ride in northern Lynnwood. Sound Transit funded several capital projects to improve bus service on the Interstate 5 corridor, including direct access ramps from HOV lanes to Lynnwood and Ash Way park and rides that opened in 2004 and 2005, respectively. In 2011, the existing Mountlake Terrace park and ride was expanded with an 890-stall parking garage and bus platforms in the median of I-5 connected by a pedestrian bridge.

Commuter rail service to Snohomish County on the Sounder North Line began in December 2003 with a single round-trip connecting Everett and Edmonds to King Street Station in Seattle during rush hour. Service was expanded to a second round-trip in June 2005 and a third round-trip in September 2007, while an infill station opened at Mukilteo in May 2008, also bringing additional service in the form of a fourth round-trip the following September.

An expansion of the Link light rail system in the &quot;Sound Transit 2&quot; package was approved in November 2008, including 54% of southwestern Snohomish County voters, funding the extension of light rail to Lynnwood. The extension opened on August 30, 2024, with stations in Shoreline, Mountlake Terrace, and Lynnwood. On September 14, Community Transit debuted its redeveloped bus network and eliminated all of its Downtown Seattle express service in favor of new commuter routes connecting to Lynnwood and Mountlake Terrace stations. With the passage of Sound Transit 3 in 2016, light rail service to Everett via Paine Field is anticipated to begin service in 2041.

== Administration ==
Community Transit is administered by a nine-member board, composed of two members of the Snohomish County Council, two elected officials from PTBA cities with populations of 30,000 or more, three elected officials from cities with between 10,000 and 30,000, and two elected officials from cities with less than 10,000, that meets monthly at their headquarters in Everett. The board is led by a non-voting chief executive officer, a position held by Ric Ilgenfritz since January 2021. CT adopted an operating budget of $133.2 million for 2015; 65 to 70 percent of revenue is provided by a 0.9 percent sales tax within the PTBA, the maximum authorized for transit agencies under state law, while a combination of fares and federal funding comprise the remainder. The agency employs 579 full-time equivalent persons, divided into eight departments.

CT is headquartered at their Cascade Administration Building at 2312 W Casino Road in the Paine Field industrial area of South Everett, located south of the Boeing Everett Factory. The Merrill Creek operations building opened in 1997 and is the primary bus base for the agency&#x27;s fleet of buses and vans.

== Services ==

Community Transit operates fixed bus routes throughout the Snohomish County PTBA, serving 47 percent of its 542,000 people and 76 percent of its 254,000 jobs. The 46 bus routes serve 1,584 bus stops, of which 257 have a bus shelter—the rest consist of a standalone sign or a sign with a bench. The bus routes are divided into three types of service, numbered according to destination: frequent bus rapid transit on the unnumbered Swift, 24 local routes in the 100s for southern Snohomish County and 200s for northern and eastern Snohomish County, and 22 weekday peak-only commuter express routes from park and rides to the Boeing Everett Factory numbered as the 2X7s, Downtown Seattle in the 400s, and Northgate station (formerly the University of Washington campus) in the 800s. CT and their subcontractor First Transit also operate all-day, all-week Sound Transit Express service to Seattle and Bellevue on six routes numbered in the 500s. Typically, service changes occur in March and September, in response to ridership and requests from the community.

Commuter bus routes to Boeing in Everett, Downtown Seattle and Northgate Station generally originate at one of the 24 Community Transit park and rides and transit centers located throughout Snohomish County, with a total capacity of 8,500 automobiles and 172 bicycles. The largest facilities, primarily located in southwest Snohomish County, include weatherproof bicycle lockers in addition to automobile parking. The majority of park and rides are owned by the Washington State Department of Transportation and maintained by Community Transit and other service providers.

In addition to bus service, CT operates a vanpool program with a fleet of 366 vans originating from the Kasch Park operating base in Everett. The fleet comes in configurations with 7, 12, or 15 seats, with two special vans equipped with wheelchair lifts. Community Transit reports that there are 361 active vanpools using their service, providing 908,488 rides in 2015, the 12th largest vanpool program in the United States that year. CT leases vanpool lots, called &quot;park and pool lots&quot;, from local churches and other private parties at 15 locations with a total capacity of 482 parking stalls.

Dial-a-ride transportation (DART) service is also offered by Community Transit, contracted through Senior Services of Snohomish County since 1981. DART paratransit is available for a fare of $2 for qualifying customers within of local CT routes during regular operating hours. , CT has 4,100 registered DART users that take an average of 700 trips per day. A separate dial-a-ride service, Zip, launched in October 2022 to serve the Alderwood Mall and Lynnwood area. It operates similar to ride-hailing service with fixed fares (including payment via ORCA cards) and is available to all members of the public; trips are requested through an app or phone call. It was originally a one-year pilot until being made a permanent service in October 2023. Similar microtransit services are under consideration for various cities in Snohomish County as part of Community Transit&#x27;s long-range plan.

=== Fares ===
Fares on Community Transit buses are priced into three groups: adult, youth, and reduced. Adult fare is charged for passengers between the ages of 19 and 64, youth fare is charged for passengers 18 years old or younger, and the reduced fare is charged for passengers over the age of 65 or those with disabilities or Medicare card holders. Fares also change based on service level, with local service within Snohomish County costing the least and commuter service to Seattle being more expensive. On July 1, 2019, Community Transit introduced a low-income fare as part of the regional ORCA Lift program. Youth fares were made free with valid ID on September 1, 2022, as part of a state grant program that lasts until 2039.

The regional ORCA card was introduced as an integrated smart card for transit agencies in the Puget Sound region on April 20, 2009, allowing users to load monthly passes and value through an e-purse web interface. The card also allowed free transfers within a two-hour period between transit agencies of equal value, with the difference for higher fare subtracted from the e-purse or prompting for cash. While initially available for no fee, effective March 1, 2010, a $5 cost was added when ordering a standard adult or youth ORCA card. CT removed their paper transfers on January 1, 2010, after the ORCA card made them obsolete.

Community Transit also offers monthly passes through local higher education institutions, including Edmonds College, the University of Washington, Cascadia College, and the Lynnwood Campus of Central Washington University.

Dial-a-ride transportation, a type of paratransit service operated by Community Transit, has a flat fare of $2.50 without discounts or separate categories. ORCA cards are not accepted on DART, replaced by tickets and monthly passes for frequent users.

== Fleet ==

, Community Transit has a fleet of 696 vehicles that are maintained at its operating bases at Kasch Park and Merrill Creek. The fleet of 257 fixed-route buses is generally composed of and vehicles, as well as specialized articulated buses and double-decker buses. Buses typically are powered by diesel engines, with the exception of the 39 hybrid diesel–electric buses used on Swift Bus Rapid Transit and some local routes. Community Transit expects to purchase 55 to 60 new buses by 2027 to support increased transit service and replace older vehicles. The agency began testing several battery electric buses in early 2023 and the region&#x27;s first hydrogen-powered fuel cell bus in 2024.

Since 1995, all Community Transit buses are low-floored and equipped with a hydraulic or pneumatic &quot;kneeling&quot; device in addition to wheelchair lifts for 6-wheeled motorized wheelchairs. CT buses have also featured at least two bicycle racks located in front of the windshield since 1996; Swift bus rapid transit buses have three bicycle racks located inside the vehicle for reduced dwell times.

In addition to its bus fleet, Community Transit maintains 333 vans for its vanpool program and 52 paratransit minibuses equipped with wheelchair lifts for dial-a-ride service. Retired vanpool and DART vehicles are donated to local non-profit organizations through the VanGO program, which has gifted 106 vans since its establishment in 2000.

=== Double Tall ===
Community Transit has a fleet of double-decker buses used on commuter routes from park and rides to Downtown Seattle, named the &quot;Double Tall&quot; in reference to the double tall cup size at Starbucks, a coffee chain founded and headquartered in Seattle. The Alexander Dennis Enviro500 was introduced during a one-year pilot project in 2007, on lease from Alexander Dennis for $15,000 per month. The , Enviro500 seated 77 to 81, with standing room for 20 additional passengers, replacing the capacity of the standard articulated buses used on the commuter routes in a smaller footprint. Prior to the end of the trial in 2008, CT placed an order of 23 Enviro500s, scheduled to be delivered and put into service in 2010; the initial order was not fulfilled until 2011, when manufacturing was moved to an ElDorado plant in Riverside, California to meet federal Buy America Act requirements. A second order of 17 Enviro500s, to replace older articulated buses, was made in 2013 and went into service in late 2015.

Sound Transit introduced five of its own double-decker buses in 2015 for use on their Snohomish County routes under contract with Community Transit. Sound Transit plans to eventually replace its entire Snohomish County fleet with double-deckers in the near-term future, beginning with 32 additional buses in 2018. Community Transit also ordered 17 double-decker buses, with an option to purchase 40 more, as part of the joint procurement with Sound Transit and Kitsap Transit.

The fleet of 45 double-decker buses operated directly by Community Transit is, , the second-largest double-decker fleet of any public transit agency in the United States, behind RTC Transit of Las Vegas, Nevada and ahead of Unitrans of Davis, California and Antelope Valley Transit Authority of Antelope Valley, California. The first fleet of Double Tall buses were retired in 2023 and sold at auctions to sightseeing and cruise companies.

<text>The Night of the Witches aka Night of the Sorcerers () is a 1974 horror film which starred Maria Kosti, Loli Tovar aka Maria Dolores del Loreto Tovar, Barbara King, Kali Hansa aka Marisol Hernandez, Jack Taylor, Simón Andreu, and Joseph Thelman. Written and directed by Amando de Ossorio, the premise of the movie is that a group of African explorers run afoul of a native cult. &quot;Brujo&quot; means a &quot;male witch or warlock&quot;, so the title actually translates as &quot;Night of the Warlocks&quot;, not &quot;Night of the Witches&quot;.

==Plot==
In a 1910 prologue, an unnamed missionary (Barbara King) is kidnapped by native Bokor (sorcerers) to be sacrificed under a full moon. The Bokor tie her between two posts, whip her, then carry her to a stone altar where they decapitate her. The ceremony is interrupted, however, by soldiers who shoot all the participants. Unnoticed in the melee, a Shedim (demon) takes possession of the woman.

Years later, Professor Jonathan Grant (Jack Taylor) commands a safari investigating the disappearance of elephants in West Africa. Amongst the explorers are a &quot;great white hunter,&quot; Rod Carter (Simón Andreu), two blonde women (Elisabeth, Maria Kosti, and Carol, Loli Tovar), and a mulatto woman, Tunika (Kali Hansa). Elizabeth&#x27;s father financed the expedition. They stumble across the clearing where the natives had performed their Vodoun rituals before being wiped out in colonial times. Carol decides to take some photographs of the altar for a magazine article. They decide to camp nearby.

That night, Carol returns to the clearing to take some more atmospheric photographs. The former missionary, now dressed in leopard skins and with feline-like canine teeth/fangs, emerges from the surrounding jungle and subdues her. The long-dead Bokor, resurrected from their burial mounds, recreate the ceremony from the prologue. Carol is whipped and decapitated.

The remaining Europeans search for Carol the next day, but discover only her camera. That night, Carol, now also dressed in leopard skins, joins the other leopard-woman. Together, they sneak into the camp. The brunette kills Professor Grant and destroys the photographs from Carol&#x27;s camera which he had been developing. The distraught Liz had taken sleeping pills when no one could locate her friend, and is groggy when Carol appears in her tent. &quot;Elizabeth, it&#x27;s me, your best friend Carol.&quot; &quot;We thought you&#x27;d been lost in the jungle...&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s just as well. Come!&quot; The two blondes leave the camp and join the other leopard-woman in the jungle. Just as Liz realizes what they are going to do, the two leopard-women plunge their fangs into her neck. In Liz&#x27;s struggles, the original leopard-woman is knocked down and the choker she wears to fasten her neck together splits. Her severed head rolls free and she perishes as blood gushes from her neck.

After another fruitless day of searching, Rod and Tunika make plans to depart. That night Carol is joined by the demon-possessed Elizabeth, also dressed in leopard skins, her new fangs gleaming in the moonlight. They abduct Tunika, take her to the ceremonial clearing, place her on the altar, and use their sharp fingernails and fangs to bloody her. As they place the leopard skins across her shredded flesh, Rod emerges from the jungle and shoots them both. He tosses his ammunition belts into the ceremonial fire, and the random shots kill the resurrected Bokor. In the confusion, he picks up Tunika and carries her to a jeep. They make their escape, and Tunika tells him she’s &quot;feeling much better already&quot; in the breathy voice of the Shedim.

==Release==
The film was titled &quot;Night of the Sorcerers&quot; when it was dubbed into English and released theatrically by Avco-Embassy in 1974.

The film was released on VHS in the United States by Unicorn Video in the 1980s.

The film was released on a special edition DVD in 2007 by Deimos Entertainment, a subdivision of BCI Eclipse.

<text>Slim River is a small town in Muallim District, Perak, Malaysia. It is about 100 km (driving time 45 minutes) from Kuala Lumpur. It is situated in the southern part of Perak and is 20 km north of Tanjung Malim. It is about 100 km (driving time 1 hour) from Ipoh. The town is surrounded by many small villages.

==History==

The town is named after a nearby river, Sungai Slim. The word Sungai means river in Malay. The river was named after an English captain, William Slim, in the 19th century. He accidentally went up the river instead of the Perak River which was the main waterway back then.

Slim River was a military strategic midpoint from North to South of Malaya during World War II. It was the site of a major battle during World War II between the Japanese and British forces which consisted of troops from India, Australia and Great Britain. The British lost the Battle of Slim River to the Japanese forces, who were equipped with tanks. The Japanese also had total air superiority. In their defeat at Slim River, the British suffered heavy casualties and many units were cut off from their line of retreat. The battle effectively ended British hopes of defending Malaya.

==Economy==
The main economic activities are agriculture-based, such as palm oil and rubber plantations. There are some automotive shops selling engine parts and components. This is due to the proximity of the new car manufacturing town, Proton City in Tanjung Malim.

==Demographics==
The population is estimated at 100,000, and consists of Malays, Chinese, Malaysian Indians (mostly Tamil) and Orang Asli, the indigenous people of Peninsular Malaysia.

==Public amenities==
There is a new modern government hospital providing basic medical care for the district. In addition, there is a public library for the locals to visit.

===Schools===
Primary and secondary education are provided by a few schools in Slim River, namely:
*Sekolah Kebangsaan Balun
*Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Dato&#x27; Zulkifli Muhammad
*Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Slim
*Sekolah Kebangsaan Kuala Slim
*Kolej Vokasional Slim River
*Sekolah Kebangsaan Slim River
*Sekolah Kebangsaan Aminuddin Baki
*Sekolah Rendah Jenis Kebangsaan (C) Chin Hua

*Sekolah Kebangsaan Pos Bersih
*Sekolah Kebangsaan Pos Tenau

==Places of interest==

The waterfall at Sungai Bil is famous among the locals for a weekend getaway. Recreation activities and camping is possible, and one can travel from the town by road within 30 minutes. Food stalls selling lunch and fast food are available normally during weekend.

There is also an open wet market every Sunday morning until noon, where one can try a variety of local dishes and delicacies.

At Ulu Slim, about the same distance from Slim River to Sungai Bil, there is a hot spring, and it is expected that the local government will develop the place, into a recreation area, for families. The hot spring water is 104 °C and is reputed to be the 5th hottest hot spring in the world.

Several outdoor extreme sports are available inside Ulu Slim, reservation will be required for these activities such as white water rafting, 4x4 rides, camping, and jungle trekking.

The upcoming Slim River Water Theme Park will also be opened soon.

==Transportation==

It is accessible by road from the capital city, Kuala Lumpur (100 km) or by train (Slim River railway station). The main trunk road to Tanjung Malim was the first ever toll road in Malaysia and was eventually given free access to the public in the mid 1980s.

Before the construction of North–South Expressway, all traffic going to destinations in the northern states of Peninsular Malaysia, such as Kedah, Perlis and Penang would pass through the town of Slim River. With the new North–South Expressway bypassing smaller towns, fewer people, traffic, and tourists pass through Slim River. Currently, the economy of Slim River is improving due to the nearby Proton City, located in Tanjung Malim.

<text>The Eastside of the King County, Washington area in the United States is a collective term for the suburbs of Seattle located on the east side of Lake Washington.

The most common definitions of the Eastside include the cities of Bellevue, Kirkland, Redmond, Sammamish, Issaquah, Newcastle, and Mercer Island.

The towns west of Bellevue, collectively known as the Gold Coast, are usually considered part of the Eastside. These include Beaux Arts Village, Clyde Hill, Hunts Point, Medina, and Yarrow Point.

The Northshore cities of Kenmore, Bothell, and Woodinville may be considered part of the Eastside, as each city contains portions that are east of the lake and south of its northernmost tip. Similarly, on the southeast tip of Lake Washington, Renton may also be included.

The most expansive definitions of the Eastside can include cities in the Snoqualmie Valley, including Duvall, Carnation, Fall City, Snoqualmie, and North Bend.

In politics, the area is sometimes referred to as the &quot;suburban crescent&quot;.

==History==
Several Indigenous peoples have lived on the Eastside for thousands of years prior to American colonization. The various subgroups of the Hachuamish, as well as the Sammamish, had many villages along the eastern coast of Lake Washington and the Sammamish River. Although they were more contained to the southernmost reaches of the Eastside, the modern-day site of Renton was the center of Duwamish society. Farther out in the Snoqualmie Valley, the Snoqualmie were historically one of the most populous tribes in the Puget Sound region. 

The cities on the Eastside mostly began as centers of logging or mining in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Once logged, the land was eventually cleared (primarily by Japanese immigrant labor) to support farming. In the years prior to World War II they became centers of dairy and berry farming.

During the post-war boom, they became bedroom communities for Seattle. This was made possible by the 1940 construction of the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge across Lake Washington, as well as the later construction of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge in 1963; additional traffic later led to the construction of an additional bridge paralleling the Murrow bridge, Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge, as well as the replacement of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge. Currently, the area is growing several edge cities.

==Economy==

Bellevue is the largest city on the Eastside and fifth largest in the state. A major technology center, the Eastside is home to many large high-tech companies, mainly in the software and wireless industries, including Microsoft, T-Mobile US, Nintendo of America, AT&amp;T Mobility (formerly Cingular), the former Western Wireless (now part of Verizon Wireless), Vulcan Ventures, 180 Solutions and InfoSpace. Companies like Paccar, Puget Sound Energy, Symetra Insurance, Boeing, Verizon Wireless, Google, Amazon, Yahoo, Walt Disney, and Fox Sports also have national, major divisional or regional offices in the Eastside. The Eastside is also a hub for biotech and medical companies including Amgen, Icos, and Merck. Many local magnates, including Bill Gates, Steve Ballmer, John Stanton, and Craig McCaw, live in the Eastside&#x27;s cities. The Eastside is also home to many video game and interactive media companies. These include Bungie, Valve, ArenaNet, Sucker Punch, Monolith Productions, Sony Online Entertainment, Warner Brothers Entertainment, Microsoft Game Studios, Epic Games, Unity Technologies and DigiPen Institute of Technology.

Kirkland hosts the annual Junior League Softball World Series. Kirkland Signature is also the own brand of Costco, which founded its first warehouse in Seattle (#1), and operates from its corporate headquarters in the Eastside city of Issaquah.
==Demographics==
For the purposes of population estimates, Eastside includes Bellevue, Kirkland, Redmond, Sammamish, Issaquah, Newcastle, Mercer Island, Woodinville, Kenmore, and Bothell.

==Transportation==

===Air===
There are public and private airfields on the Eastside. Major facilities include:

*Kenmore Air Harbor provides scheduled seaplane service to various points in the Northwest United States and southwest British Columbia.
*Renton Municipal Airport adjacent to the Boeing factory has a runway. 
*Bellevue Airfield was closed in 1983.

There is also a landing zone for paragliding at the base of Tiger Mountain at .

===Rail===

The Woodinville Subdivision is a rail line built in the late 19th century. In 2008, the Wilburton Tunnel was eliminated, severing the line. The right-of-way was purchased the same year by the Port of Seattle. Eastside cities and King County purchased portions of the Port property for conversion to a rail trail called the Eastside Rail Corridor.

===Road===
The Eastside is connected to Seattle by the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge from Medina (State Route 520) and the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge and Third Lake Washington Bridge from Bellevue via Mercer Island (Interstate 90). It is also served by Interstate 405, a loop route of Interstate 5 that runs to the east of Lake Washington from Tukwila to Lynnwood.

<text>USS &quot;Mertz&quot; (DD-691) was a in the service of the United States Navy from 1943 to 1946. She was scrapped in 1972.

==Namesake==
Albert Mertz was born on 26 March 1851 in Richmond, Wisconsin. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in June 1872. Commissioned Ensign on 15 July 1873, he was assigned to the Coast Survey on 26 November 1877 until he returned to regular duty in the Navy on 6 July 1878, serving on the and , among other ships. Following promotion to Commander on 11 April 1902, he took command of his first ship, on 20 July 1903. On 20 December 1909 he reported for duty as commandant, Naval Station Cavite and Olongapo, Philippines. Appointed Rear Admiral 20 October 1910, he departed the Philippines on 3 February 1912 to become Governor of the Naval Home, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 25 March. He retired on 26 March 1913 and died at San Diego, California on 21 July 1936.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Mertz&quot; was laid down by Bath Iron Works Corp., Bath, Maine on 10 May 1943 and launched on 11 September 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Selma M. Allen, daughter of Rear Admiral Mertz The ship was commissioned at Charlestown, Massachusetts on 19 November 1943.

==Service history==
===Arrival in the Pacific===

After shakedown off Bermuda, &quot;Mertz&quot; departed Norfolk, Virginia, 26 January 1944 for the central Pacific, via the Panama Canal and San Diego, California, arriving at Pearl Harbor 5 March. On 9 March, the destroyer got underway for the Marshall Islands as convoy escort, arriving Majuro Atoll 6 days later. &quot;Mertz&quot; sailed on 22 March to join TG 58.2 and on 26 March and act as escort back to Majuro. En route on 31 March, she caught a Japanese maru at 0600 in the glare of her searchlights. The enemy merchant ship maneuvered to get away, only to go down under the hail of projectiles from &quot;Mertz&quot;. The task group reached Majuro 6 April. Five days later &quot;Mertz&quot; steamed for the New Hebrides as a screen for the escort carrier , arriving at Espiritu Santo on 15 April.

In mid-May, the destroyer returned to Pearl Harbor to prepare for the Marianas campaign. She took fire support and patrol station close ashore to Saipan on 14 June, pounding gun emplacements in the daytime and at night maintaining illumination over the enemy lines until 22 June, when she began screening convoys.

===Peleliu and Angaur===

&quot;Mertz&quot; participated in the occupations of Peleliu and of Angaur in the Palau Islands, arriving 10 September. She retired to Manus, Admiralty Islands, on 23 September to prepare for the invasion of Leyte, Philippines.

===Philippines campaign===

On 20 October, D-Day for the Leyte landing forces, &quot;Mertz&quot; escorted landing craft through air attacks to the beach and later in the day patrolled off Dinagat Island at the entrance to Leyte Gulf. Early in the morning of 25 October as the Japanese Southern Force approached Leyte Gulf through the Mindanao Sea, &quot;Mertz&quot; and patrolled between Desolation Point and Homonhon Island, lest the enemy fleet choose to steam north along the east coast of Dinagat Island to attack the Allied beachhead. When the Japanese entered Surigao Strait, Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf’s force met and destroyed the enemy armada in the classic &quot;crossing-of-the-T&quot; maneuver known as the Battle of Surigao Strait, part of the overall Battle of Leyte Gulf. Later that same day &quot;Mertz&quot; splashed a Zero at several hundred yards with heavy machinegun fire.

With the Leyte beachhead established, the destroyer got underway 26 October for Hollandia, New Guinea, anchoring in Humboldt Bay on the 30th to replenish. She got underway for Leyte again 9 November escorting a reinforcement convoy arriving 5 days later. &quot;Mertz&quot; then continued on to Seeadler Harbor, Manus, to join a task unit staging for the daring expedition through the Sulu Sea, controlled by the enemy since early 1942, to capture Mindoro. The American ships had to contend with both a typhoon and heavy air attacks. &quot;Mertz&quot; splashed a Ki-43 (&quot;Oscar&quot;) 15 December and assisted in the destruction of several others. Departing San Pedro Bay 4 January 1945, she made another voyage through the Sulu Sea, to support the invasion of Luzon at Lingayen Gulf on 9 January before returning to San Pedro Bay on 16 January.

===Attacks on Japan===

On 10 February, &quot;Mertz&quot; steamed from Ulithi for three months at sea with the Fast Carrier Task Force. During this time, she played a role in the airstrikes on the Tokyo area 16 February, the landings on Iwo Jima 19 February, and the raids on Okinawa 1 March. While screening the flattops off Kyūshū, Japan, in March, she downed two more enemy planes. While operating off Okinawa &quot;Mertz&quot; helped sink the on 18 April. The destroyer retired to Ulithi 14 May, before returning to Okinawa on 24 May. She next steamed to Okino Daito Jima which she bombarded on 9 June. The next day, she got underway for Leyte Gulf, anchoring at San Pedro Bay 13 June.

As part of Adm. Willam F. Halsey’s 3rd Fleet she cleared San Pedro on 1 July, and nine days later arrived at the launching area off the southeast coast of Tokyo for strike on the Japanese home islands. Beginning with the attacks on Tokyo 10 July, &quot;Mertz&quot; ranged up and down the coasts of Japan until she joined an antishipping sweep in the Kuriles while en route to the Aleutians. The destroyer arrived at Adak 14 August, the day of Japan&#x27;s capitulation.

===End of World War II and fate===

&quot;Mertz&quot;″s first and only peacetime duty came 31 August, when she departed Adak for Japan, arriving Ominato, northern Honshū, on 8 September, to operate with the 3rd Fleet during the occupation of the northern Honshū-Hokkaidō area. On 15 September the destroyer departed Ominato Harbor for the west coast, arriving San Francisco on 30 September.

On 1 December, &quot;Mertz&quot; steamed to San Diego, where she decommissioned 23 April 1946 and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet. She was reassigned to the Long Beach, California, group 1 July 1951 and the Stockton, California, group 1 January 1959. &quot;Mertz&quot; was finally sold for scrap on 16 December 1971.

==Awards==
&quot;Mertz&quot; received 10 battle stars for World War II service.

<doc id="848862" wikidata="Q418533" url="?curid=848862" title="Nucleoside triphosphate">
<text>A nucleoside triphosphate is a nucleoside containing a nitrogenous base bound to a 5-carbon sugar (either ribose or deoxyribose), with three phosphate groups bound to the sugar. They are the molecular precursors of both DNA and RNA, which are chains of nucleotides made through the processes of DNA replication and transcription. Nucleoside triphosphates also serve as a source of energy for cellular reactions and are involved in signalling pathways.

Nucleoside triphosphates cannot easily cross the cell membrane, so they are typically synthesized within the cell. Synthesis pathways differ depending on the specific nucleoside triphosphate being made, but given the many important roles of nucleoside triphosphates, synthesis is tightly regulated in all cases. Nucleoside analogues may also be used to treat viral infections. For example, azidothymidine (AZT) is a nucleoside analogue used to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS.

== Naming ==
The term nucleoside refers to a nitrogenous base linked to a 5-carbon sugar (either ribose or deoxyribose). Nucleotides are nucleosides covalently linked to one or more phosphate groups. To provide information about the number of phosphates, nucleotides may instead be referred to as nucleoside (mono, di, or tri) phosphates. Thus, nucleoside triphosphates are a type of nucleotide.

Nucleotides are commonly abbreviated with 3 letters (4 or 5 in case of deoxy- or dideoxy-nucleotides). The first letter indicates the identity of the nitrogenous base (e.g., A for adenine, G for guanine), the second letter indicates the number of phosphates (mono, di, tri), and the third letter is P, standing for phosphate. Nucleoside triphosphates that contain ribose as the sugar are conventionally abbreviated as NTPs, while nucleoside triphosphates containing deoxyribose as the sugar are abbreviated as dNTPs. For example, dATP stands for deoxyribose adenosine triphosphate. NTPs are the building blocks of RNA, and dNTPs are the building blocks of DNA. 
The carbons of the sugar in a nucleoside triphosphate are numbered around the carbon ring starting from the original carbonyl of the sugar. Conventionally, the carbon numbers in a sugar are followed by the prime symbol (‘) to distinguish them from the carbons of the nitrogenous base. The nitrogenous base is linked to the 1’ carbon through a glycosidic bond, and the phosphate groups are covalently linked to the 5’ carbon. The first phosphate group linked to the sugar is termed the α-phosphate, the second is the β-phosphate, and the third is the γ-phosphate; these are linked to one another by two phosphoanhydride bonds.

== DNA and RNA synthesis ==
The cellular processes of DNA replication and transcription involve DNA and RNA synthesis, respectively. DNA synthesis uses dNTPs as substrates, while RNA synthesis uses rNTPs as substrates. NTPs cannot be converted directly to dNTPs. DNA contains four different nitrogenous bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine. RNA also contains adenine, guanine, and cytosine, but replaces thymine with uracil. Thus, DNA synthesis requires dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP as substrates, while RNA synthesis requires ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP.

Nucleic acid synthesis is catalyzed by either DNA polymerase or RNA polymerase for DNA and RNA synthesis respectively. These enzymes covalently link the free -OH group on the 3’ carbon of a growing chain of nucleotides to the α-phosphate on the 5’ carbon of the next (d)NTP, releasing the β- and γ-phosphate groups as pyrophosphate (PPi). This results in a phosphodiester linkage between the two (d)NTPs. The release of PPi provides the energy necessary for the reaction to occur. Nucleic acid synthesis occurs exclusively in the 5’ to 3’ direction.

== Nucleoside triphosphate metabolism ==
Given their importance in the cell, the synthesis and degradation of nucleoside triphosphates is under tight control. This section focuses on nucleoside triphosphate metabolism in humans, but the process is fairly conserved among species. Nucleoside triphosphates cannot be absorbed well, so all nucleoside triphosphates are typically made &quot;de novo&quot;. The synthesis of ATP and GTP (purines) differs from the synthesis of CTP, TTP, and UTP (pyrimidines). Both purine and pyrimidine synthesis use phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) as a starting molecule.

The conversion of NTPs to dNTPs can only be done in the diphosphate form. Typically a NTP has one phosphate removed to become a NDP, then is converted to a dNDP by an enzyme called ribonucleotide reductase, then a phosphate is added back to give a dNTP.

=== Purine synthesis ===
A nitrogenous base called hypoxanthine is assembled directly onto PRPP. This results in a nucleotide called inosine monophosphate (IMP). IMP is then converted to either a precursor to AMP or GMP. Once AMP or GMP are formed, they can be phosphorylated by ATP to their diphosphate and triphosphate forms.

Purine synthesis is regulated by the allosteric inhibition of IMP formation by the adenine or guanine nucleotides. AMP and GMP also competitively inhibit the formation of their precursors from IMP.

=== Pyrimidine synthesis ===
A nitrogenous base called orotate is synthesized independently of PRPP. After orotate is made it is covalently attached to PRPP. This results in a nucleotide called orotate monophosphate (OMP). OMP is converted to UMP, which can then be phosphorylated by ATP to UDP and UTP. UTP can then be converted to CTP by a deamination reaction. TTP is not a substrate for nucleic acid synthesis, so it is not synthesized in the cell. Instead, dTTP is made indirectly from either dUDP or dCDP after conversion to their respective deoxyribose forms.

Pyrimidine synthesis is regulated by the allosteric inhibition of orotate synthesis by UDP and UTP. PRPP and ATP are also allosteric activators of orotate synthesis.

=== Ribonucleotide reductase ===
Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is the enzyme responsible for converting NTPs to dNTPs. Given that dNTPs are used in DNA replication, the activity of RNR is tightly regulated. RNR can only process NDPs, so NTPs are first dephosphorylated to NDPs before conversion to dNDPs. dNDPs are then typically re-phosphorylated. RNR has 2 subunits and 3 sites: the catalytic site, activity (A) site, and specificity (S) site. The catalytic site is where the NDP to dNDP reaction takes place, the activity site determines whether or not the enzyme is active, and the specificity site determines which reaction takes place in the catalytic site.

The activity site can bind either ATP or dATP. When bound to ATP, RNR is active. When ATP or dATP is bound to the S site, RNR will catalyze synthesis of dCDP and dUDP from CDP and UDP. dCDP and dUDP can go on to indirectly make dTTP. dTTP bound to the S site will catalyze synthesis of dGDP from GDP, and binding of dGDP to the S site will promote synthesis of dADP from ADP. dADP is then phosphorylated to give dATP, which can bind to the A site and turn RNR off.

== Other cellular roles ==

=== ATP as a source of cellular energy ===

ATP is the primary energy currency of the cell. Despite being synthesized through the metabolic pathway described above, it is primarily synthesized during both cellular respiration and photosynthesis by ATP synthase. ATP synthase couples the synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate with an electrochemical gradient generated by the pumping of protons through either the inner mitochondrial membrane (cellular respiration) or the thylakoid membrane (photosynthesis). This electrochemical gradient is necessary because the formation of ATP is energetically unfavourable.

The hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi proceeds as follows:

:&lt;chem&gt;ATP + H2O -&gt; ADP + P_{i}&lt;/chem&gt;

This reaction is energetically favourable and releases 30.5 kJ/mol of energy. In the cell, this reaction is often coupled with unfavourable reactions to provide the energy for them to proceed. GTP is occasionally used for energy-coupling in a similar manner. 

=== GTP signal transduction ===
GTP is essential for signal transduction, especially with G proteins. G proteins are coupled with a cell membrane bound receptor. This whole complex is called a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). G proteins can bind either GDP or GTP. When bound to GDP, G proteins are inactive. When a ligand binds a GPCR, an allosteric change in the G protein is triggered, causing GDP to leave and be replaced by GTP. GTP activates the alpha subunit of the G protein, causing it to dissociate from the G protein and act as a downstream effector.

== Nucleoside analogues ==
Nucleoside analogues can be used to treat viral infections. Nucleoside analogues are nucleosides that are structurally similar (analogous) to the nucleosides used in DNA and RNA synthesis. Once these nucleoside analogues enter a cell, they can become phosphorylated by a viral enzyme. The resulting nucleotides are similar enough to the nucleotides used in DNA or RNA synthesis to be incorporated into growing DNA or RNA strands, but they do not have an available 3&#x27; OH group to attach the next nucleotide, causing chain termination. This can be exploited for therapeutic uses in viral infections because viral DNA polymerase recognizes certain nucleotide analogues more readily than eukaryotic DNA polymerase. For example, azidothymidine is used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. Some less selective nucleoside analogues can be used as chemotherapy agents to treat cancer, such as cytosine arabinose (ara-C) in the treatment of certain forms of leukemia.

Resistance to nucleoside analogues is common, and is frequently due to a mutation in the enzyme that phosphorylates the nucleoside after entry into the cell. This is common in nucleoside analogues used to treat HIV/AIDS.

<text>Blast (stylized as BL&#x27;AST!) is an American punk rock band formed in 1983 in Santa Cruz, California. After breaking up in 1991, they reunited in 2001 and again in 2013. To date, Blast has released three original studio albums (the latest being 1989&#x27;s &quot;Take the Manic Ride&quot;), and they have gone through several lineup changes, leaving vocalist Clifford Dinsmore and guitarist Mike Neider as the only constant members.

== History ==
Blast released their first album, &quot;The Power of Expression&quot;, in 1986. They recorded the album three times before releasing it. They first were signed by Green World Records. Blast caught the attention of SST Records, who signed them for their next release, 1987&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s in My Blood&quot;. That same year, a 7-inch was released, including a cover of Alice Cooper&#x27;s &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot;. They also were releasing new music on Santa Cruz Skateboard videos. SST and Santa Cruz Skateboards began shared videos and merchandise bridged by Blast as Neider had worked for the skateboard company for many years. The band&#x27;s third release for SST was &quot;Take the Manic Ride&quot;, released in 1989.

Blast broke up in 1991 while working on their next album. Neider and Torgerson began Blackout, releasing one 7-inch under that name, and then LAB, who put out a 7-inch EP and a four-song CD and continued into the late 1990s, playing many shows with Fu Manchu. Former Kyuss and Fu Manchu drummer Brant Bjork moved to Santa Cruz to briefly join LAB before joining up with Fu Manchu. In 2001, Blast reunited for shows on the West Coast of the United States.

In September 2013, Southern Lord and Dave Grohl released a remixed and remastered version of &quot;It&#x27;s in My Blood&quot;, titled &quot;Blood!&quot;. Following that release, original vocalist Clifford Dinsmore and guitarist Mike Neider recruited bassist Chuck Dukowski and drummer Dave Grohl to a new Blast EP &quot;For Those Who&#x27;ve Graced The Fire&quot;, which was released on Rise Records. Mike Neider and Clifford Dinsmore have recruited bassist Nick Oliveri and drummer Joey Castillo to a new Blast lineup, with plans to tour and record new material.

<doc id="848880" wikidata="Q5082986" url="?curid=848880" title="Charles Touber">
<text>Charles Touber is an Australian businessman and tour promoter from Hobart, Tasmania. He is best known as the organiser of the Gone South series of festivals in Launceston and Hobart in the early 2000s, as well as the Southern Roots Festival in Hobart in 2007.

Touber was a candidate for the Australian Senate in the 1996 Australian federal election, but did not win a seat.

Touber was formerly a member of a band called The Innocents, who were &quot;one-hit wonders&quot; in the 1970s, and reformed in 2000 to play at the International Pop Overthrow festival in the United States.

In more recent years Touber has acted as a music promoter. In 2004 he was unable to resurrect his Gone South Music Festival, and in 2009 his Southern Roots Festival failed, with Touber blaming rises in the Australian dollar. Also in 2009 a scheduled performance by international 1980s legends Madness was cancelled by its Promoter Touber the morning of the show, with Touber blaming poor ticket sales.

In 2011 Touber was appointed promoter of the cancelled 2012 MSFest, a fundraiser run for the MS Society of Tasmania in 2006, which had previously been funded and operated by promotions company Opcon from 2007 to 2011 delivering sellout events, and which at its peak had attracted an audience of 13,000. After the MS Society Of Tasmania&#x27;s refusal to enter into a reasonable licensing agreement with its operating partner Opcon, Touber took over the event operation while the charity took up the funding and a new festival was established in Hobart under the MSFest brand. Despite best efforts there was no recovery for the event, which struggled to attract a satisfactory lineup along with the success of Opcon&#x27;s rebranded Breath Of Life festival in Launceston. On 28 February 2012 - four days before the event - it was announced the MSFest 2012 was unviable, and was cancelled by the MS Society board with the charity accruing huge financial loses.

<doc id="848881" wikidata="Q23600" url="?curid=848881" title="Atlas II">
<text>Atlas II was a member of the Atlas family of launch vehicles, which evolved from the successful Atlas missile program of the 1950s. The Atlas II was a direct evolution of the Atlas I, featuring longer first-stage tanks, higher-performing engines, and the option for strap-on solid rocket boosters. It was designed to launch payloads into low Earth orbit, geosynchronous transfer orbit or geosynchronous orbit. Sixty-three launches of the Atlas II, IIA and IIAS models were carried out between 1991 and 2004; all sixty-three launches were successes, making the Atlas II a highly reliable space launch system. The Atlas line was continued by the Atlas III, used between 2000 and 2005, and the Atlas V, which is still in use .

== Background ==
In May 1988, the US Air Force chose General Dynamics (now Lockheed Martin) to develop the Atlas II vehicle, primarily to launch Defense Satellite Communications System payloads under the Medium Launch Vehicle II (MLV-II) program. Additional commercial and U.S. Government sales resulted in production increases leading to greater than 60 vehicles being produced and launched.

Atlas II was developed from the Atlas I and featured numerous upgrades over that vehicle.

Atlas II was launched from Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida as well as Space Launch Complex 3E at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. All launches were successful.

== Design ==
Atlas II provided higher performance than the earlier Atlas I by using engines with greater thrust and longer propellant tanks for both stages. The increased thrust, engine efficiency, and propellant capacity enabled the vehicle to lift payloads of 6,100 pounds (2,767 kg) into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), or more on later Atlas II variants.

Atlas II also featured lower-cost electronics, an improved flight computer, and longer propellant tanks than its predecessor, Atlas I.

=== Atlas II first stage ===

The Atlas II first stage was in diameter and long. The stage was powered by 3 RS-56 rocket engines (derived from the RS-27 main engine of the Delta II rocket) burning of RP-1 and liquid oxygen. The two booster engines were the RS-56-OBA variants (the complete assembly of both engines and the aft skirt was referred to as the MA-5A), with high thrust but moderate efficiency. The sustainer (center) engine was the RS-56-OSA variant, featuring much less thrust but higher efficiency at high altitudes than the booster engines.

The vernier engines used on the first stage of the Atlas I (and all previous Atlas models) were replaced by a hydrazine-fueled roll control system on Atlas II. This system, mounted on the interstage between the first and second stages, utilized small thrusters to control the vehicle&#x27;s roll. Compared to Atlas I, the Atlas II first stage was taller.

The Atlas II was the last Atlas rocket to use the &quot;stage-and-a-half&quot; technique, where it ignited all 3 RS-56 engines at liftoff and then jettisoned the 2 RS-56-OBA side engines and their support structure during ascent. The two RS-56-OBA engines were integrated into a single unit called the MA-5A and shared a common gas generator. They burned for approximately 164 seconds before being jettisoned, when acceleration reached approximately 5.0–5.5 &quot;g&quot;. The central sustainer engine on the first stage, an RS-56-OSA, would burn for an additional 125 seconds after their jettison. It featured better efficiency at high altitudes than the RS-56-OBAs.

The first stage also had the option to be fitted with 4 Castor 4A solid rocket boosters as part of the IIAS version, each providing an additional of thrust for 56 seconds. The first two boosters were ignited at liftoff, and the other two were ignited after the first two burnt out. Both pairs of boosters were jettisoned shortly after their respective burns.

=== Centaur II upper stage ===

The second stage of Atlas II, the Centaur II, was the result of over 3 decades of flights and enhancements of the Centaur upper stage. Centaur II featured 2 RL-10A-3-3A engines, burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. It featured propellant tanks 0.9 meters longer than its predecessor, Centaur I, giving the stage more propellant and therefore higher performance. Due to the super cold propellants inside Centaur, foam insulation was installed onto the outer metal skin on the stage to help mitigate propellant boiloff inside the tank. Centaur II&#x27;s foam insulation was permanently attached to the side of the stage, whereas previous versions of the stage (including Centaur I) jettisoned their insulation panels during flight.

The Centaur II upper stage (along with all other Centaur variants) used a pressure-stabilized propellant tank design and cryogenic propellants. The two stainless steel propellant tanks were separated by a common bulkhead, which helped keep mass down. Centaur II was long, carrying almost of fuel. The stage also featured 12 hydrazine thrusters to orient the stage and settle the propellants prior to engine ignition.

For the IIA and IIAS versions, Atlas used the Centaur IIA variant which featured 2 RL-10A-4 engines, providing higher thrust and efficiency over the RL-10A-3-3A. The two engines could be fitted with extendable nozzles, which would provide an increase in efficiency and therefore performance.

Centaur II was further refined to create the Centaur III, which flew on the Atlas III and continues to fly today on the Atlas V. Atlas II was the final Atlas rocket that only had a dual-engine Centaur available, future rockets had the option for one or two RL-10 engines on Centaur. However, the Centaur V flying on the Vulcan rocket will only utilize two RL-10 engines.

=== Integrated Apogee Boost Stage ===

The Integrated Apogee Boost Stage was an optional upper stage, used only as an apogee kick stage when launching Defense Satellite Communications System III satellites (which were designed to be delivered directly to geostationary orbit using the Transtage or Inertial Upper Stage, and so were not capable of performing their own circularization burn at the apogee of their geostationary transfer orbit) on board the Atlas II and, later, the Delta IV. It was powered by two R-4D engines and could operate on-orbit for up to twelve days before deploying its payload, allowing additional flexibility in mission planning. The IABS measured 2.9 m in diameter, and 0.68 m in length, carrying 1303 kg of propellant with a dry mass of 275 kg.

=== Payload fairing ===
Three fairing models were available for the Atlas II:
* Medium, with a diameter of , a height of , and a mass of 
* Large, with a diameter of , a height of , and a mass of 
* Extended, with a diameter of , a height of , and a mass of 

The Medium variant was not commonly used for Atlas II but was often used in earlier Atlas rockets. The Large and Extended fairing options were also later used on the Atlas III and Atlas V rockets. For the Atlas V, these fairings were part of the 400-series of that rocket, and a further extended option (&quot;Extra Extended&quot;) was available. The 4-meter Atlas fairing last flew in 2022.

Atlas II rockets flying with a Medium fairing could move the most payload to orbit, as that fairing was the lightest. Similarly, rockets with Large or Extended fairings suffered slight hits to their payload capacity.

== Versions ==

Atlas II was developed into three versions.

=== Atlas II ===
The original Atlas II was based on the Atlas I and its predecessors. Its lengthened propellant tanks and improved electronics over the Atlas I offered better performance. It was designed to work as part of the US Air Force&#x27;s Medium Launch Vehicle II program. This version flew between 1991 and 1998.

=== Atlas IIA ===
Atlas IIA was a derivative of the Atlas II designed to service the commercial launch market. The main improvement was the switch from the RL10A-4 engine on the Centaur upper stage, increasing the stage&#x27;s performance and the vehicle&#x27;s payload capability. The IIA version flew between 1992 and 2002.

=== Atlas IIAS ===
Atlas IIAS was largely identical to IIA, but added four Castor 4A solid rocket boosters to increase performance. These boosters were ignited in pairs, with one pair igniting on the ground, and the second igniting in the air shortly after the first pair separated. The &quot;half-stage booster section would then drop off as usual. IIAS was used between 1993 and 2004, concurrently with IIA.

<doc id="848897" wikidata="Q7871644" url="?curid=848897" title="USS McCord">
<text>USS &quot;McCord&quot; (DD-534) was a World War II-era built for the United States Navy during World War II.

==Namesake==
Frank C. McCord was born on 2 August 1890 in Vincennes, Indiana. He was appointed Midshipman on 5 July 1907. From 1925 on, his career focused on naval aviation. On 30 June 1932, he was appointed as commanding officer of the rigid airship . Commander McCord was on board when &quot;Akron&quot; encountered severe weather and crashed near Barnegat Light, New Jersey on 4 April 1933. McCord, and 71 others, including Rear Admiral William A. Moffett, were killed.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;McCord&quot; was laid down on 17 March 1942 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, San Francisco, California and launched on 10 January 1943. The ship was commissioned on 19 August 1943.

==Service history==
===World War II===
&quot;McCord&quot;, departing San Diego on 27 November 1943, joined the Pacific Fleet in time for operations in the Marshall Islands and Marianas, and remained in continuous action through the Palau, Philippines, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa campaigns.

She arrived off Kwajalein as a unit of Task Force 51 (TF 51), 30 January 1944. During Operation &quot;Flintlock&quot;, she screened transports and provided rapid close support fire. On 15 February the task force sortied from Kwajalein to Eniwetok Atoll for operation &quot;Catchpole&quot;. &quot;McCord&quot; at first screened the minesweepers as they cleared the passages into the lagoon and then screened the bombardment group as Engebi Island, containing the atoll&#x27;s only airfield, was secured, 17–18 February. On 21 February, she steamed back to the southern end of the lagoon for the bombardment of Eniwetok and Parry Island.

By mid-March &quot;McCord&quot; had rendezvoused with TF 39 in the Bismarck Archipelago and for two weeks she cruised in the Ysabel Channel in support of landings at Emirau Island, 21 March. She next escorted replacement troops from Purvis Bay, Florida Island, to Emirau. Returning to Purvis Bay at the end of April, she departed 1 May to escort tankers to refueling positions in the Solomons area. On 11 June, after 2 weeks of antisubmarine patrols in the area around Bougainville and New Georgia, she arrived off New Ireland to bombard an enemy tank repair installation, resuming escort duties upon its destruction. Interrupting her escort service between the Admiralties and the Solomons on 23 July, she joined TF 52 at Saipan and took part in the shelling of Tinian.

The Palau Islands offensive was next. She arrived off Peleliu on 11 September and remained through 30 September to support the forces landed on the 15th. On her arrival at Manus 4 October, &quot;McCord&quot; joined CarDiv 22, 7th Fleet, as it prepared for operations in the central Philippines. She arrived at her assigned operating area east of the Philippines as landings were made at Suluan and Dinagat, 17 October. On the 25th her task unit, 77.4.1, came under constant air attack as the Battle off Samar raged to the north. Escaping damage, &quot;McCord&quot; protected her unit&#x27;s carriers and rescued their pilots. She returned to Manus 3 November, but was back off Leyte by the 16th to prevent enemy surface forces from attacking Allied forces, installations, and shipping in the central Philippines.

On 6 December, at Ulithi, &quot;McCord&quot; joined the fast carrier force, TF 38. The force sortied from that island on 10 December and steamed to the Philippines to support the Mindoro landings by launching strikes against enemy airfields and harbors in the northern and central islands. Back at Ulithi by 24 December, they sortied again on 30 December. First they struck at Formosa, 3–6 January 1945. Then, in quick succession, they raided enemy installations and shipping in Indochina, southern Formosa, the China coast, the Philippines, eastern Formosa, and Okinawa. Constantly moving and always ready for targets of opportunity, the force&#x27;s strikes were successful. While in the South China Sea on 11–12 January they sank or damaged almost 200,000 tons of enemy shipping.

The force returned to Ulithi 23 January, remaining until 10 February. On 16 February, strikes were launched against Tokyo itself; on 18 February against Chichi Jima; and on 20 February against Iwo Jima in support of the Marine units landed on 19 February. By 24 February, the planes from TF 58 were back over Tokyo and on 25 February they flew against defense installations in the Nagoya-Kobe area.

During March, &quot;McCord&quot; continued to operate in the screen of TG 58.4 as it concentrated its efforts against Okinawa and southern Kyūshū in preparation for the amphibious assault on the former 1 April. She remained in the Ryūkyū area until 12 May when she escorted the battleship to Guam. She returned to Okinawa on 27 May for a final two weeks of combat. TG 58.4 then retired to Leyte Gulf, arriving 13 June.

&quot;McCord&quot; departed four days later for the west coast and a navy yard overhaul. On 8 July she arrived at Puget Sound, where she was docked when the Japanese surrender was announced. On 7 September she steamed to San Diego, reporting on 15 September to the Inactive Fleet.

===Postwar===
Decommissioning 15 January 1947, she remained berthed at San Diego until recommissioning 1 August 1951. Assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, &quot;McCord&quot; departed San Diego 1 November and reported to ComDesRon 28 at Norfolk on 17 November. For the next year she operated along the east coast, cruising as far north as Halifax, Nova Scotia and as far south as the British West Indies.

On 10 January 1953 the destroyer once again got underway for a western Pacific war zone. By 15 February she was off the west coast of Korea operating with carriers in TF 95. She remained in the Yellow Sea combat zone until mid-March when she received a week&#x27;s availability at Sasebo. On 26 March she joined TF 77 as it ranged the east coast of Korea providing shore bombardment and fire support services where needed by the U.N. forces. Departing the battleline 17 April, &quot;McCord&quot;, joined TG 96.7in exercises off Okinawa. She rejoined TF 77, 14 May, and remained in the Sea of Japan operations area until 5 June when her Korean deployment terminated and she got underway for the United States.

Steaming via Subic Bay, Singapore, Aden, Suez, and Gibraltar, she arrived at Norfolk, Virginia 6 August. During the next months she operated off the southern east coast and in the Caribbean. She decommissioned 9 June 1954 and was berthed at Norfolk, where, as a unit of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, she has remained into 1969.

<doc id="848901" wikidata="Q2917166" url="?curid=848901" title="Historian's fallacy">
<text>The historian&#x27;s fallacy is an informal fallacy that occurs when one assumes that decision makers of the past viewed events from the same perspective and having the same information as those subsequently analyzing the decision. It is not to be confused with presentism, a similar but distinct mode of historical analysis in which present-day ideas (such as moral standards) are projected into the past. The idea was first articulated by British literary critic Matthew Arnold in 1880 and later named and defined by American historian David Hackett Fischer in 1970.

==Concept==
The idea that a critic can make erroneous interpretations of past works because of knowledge of subsequent events was first articulated by Matthew Arnold. In his 1880 essay &quot;The Study of Poetry,&quot; he wrote:

The course of development of a nation’s language, thought, and poetry, is profoundly interesting; and by regarding a poet’s work as a stage in this course of development we may easily bring ourselves to make it of more importance as poetry than in itself it really is, we may come to use a language of quite exaggerated praise in criticising it; in short, to overrate it. So arises in our poetic judgments the fallacy caused by the estimate which we may call historic.

The concept of the historian&#x27;s fallacy was named and outlined in 1970 by David Hackett Fischer, who suggested it was analogous to William James&#x27;s psychologist&#x27;s fallacy. Fischer did not suggest that historians should refrain from retrospective analysis in their work, but he reminded historians that their subjects were not able to see into the future. As an example, he cited the well-known argument that Japan&#x27;s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor should have been predictable in the United States because of the many indications that an attack was imminent. What this argument overlooks, says Fischer, citing the work of Roberta Wohlstetter, is that there were innumerable conflicting signs which suggested possibilities other than an attack on Pearl Harbor. Only in retrospect do the warning signs seem obvious; signs that pointed in other directions tend to be forgotten. (See also hindsight bias.)

In the field of military history, historians sometimes use what is known as the &quot;fog of war technique&quot; in hopes of avoiding the historian&#x27;s fallacy. In this approach, the actions and decisions of the historical subject (such as a military commander) are evaluated primarily on the basis of what that person knew at the time, and not on future developments that the person could not have known. According to Fischer, this technique was pioneered by the American historian Douglas Southall Freeman in his influential biographies of Robert E. Lee and George Washington.

<doc id="848904" wikidata="Q1379737" url="?curid=848904" title="Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada">
<text>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada (ELCIC; ) is Canada&#x27;s largest Lutheran denomination, with 95,000 baptized members in 519 congregations, with the second largest, the Lutheran Church–Canada, having 47,607 baptized members. Together with the LCC and the Canadian Association of Lutheran Congregations, it is one of only three all-Canadian Lutheran denominations. It is a member of the Lutheran World Federation, the Canadian Council of Churches, the World Council of Churches, and the Anglican-Lutheran North American grouping Churches Beyond Borders. According to the 2021 Canadian census, a larger number of 328,045 adherents identify as Lutheran.

==History==
The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada came into being in 1986 through the merger of two predecessor bodies the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Canada (started in 1966 by Canadian congregations of the American Lutheran Church) and three synods of the Lutheran Church in America, called the Canada Section. (In 1988 these two U.S. church bodies ceased to exist as they merged into the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the ELCIC&#x27;s sister denomination in the United States.)

==Doctrine==

The Church derives its teachings from the Bible and the Book of Concord which includes the three ecumenical creeds of the Christian Church—that is, the Apostles&#x27; Creed, the Nicene Creed and the Athanasian Creed. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada is in full communion with the Anglican Church of Canada (under the Waterloo Declaration) and the Northern Province of the Moravian Church in North America. Martin Luther University College and Lutheran Theological Seminary, Saskatoon are the seminaries owned by the church.

==Organisation==

The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada is composed of five geography-based synods (similar to a diocese in Anglican polity). The presiding officer and chief pastor of each synod is a bishop.
*The British Columbia Synod
*The Synod of Alberta and the Territories
** Robert Jacobson first bishop (1985–1995)
*The Saskatchewan Synod
*The Manitoba/Northwestern Ontario Synod
*The Eastern Synod

This structure is identical to the synod structure of the ELCA, except that the Canadian synods cover one or more entire provinces, whereas some ELCA synods cover the whole or part of a metro area and some cover several states. Like the ELCA a presiding bishop serves as its head, but in the ELCIC, this bishop is known as the &quot;National Bishop&quot;. Although episcopal in structure, the church does not have cathedrals as such, though the largest parish church in a city may well have that de facto function with respect to major worship services involving the whole Lutheran community.

==National Bishops==

*The Rev. Donald Sjoberg, 1986–1993
*The Rev. Telmor Sartison, 1993–2001
*The Rev. Raymond Schultz, 2001–2007
*The Rev. Canon Susan Johnson, 2007-

==Same-sex unions==

In 2006, the Eastern Synod voted to allow individual pastors and congregations to conduct blessing of same-sex unions, prompting a dispute between the synod and the national church over which body has the authority to make such a decision. The national church had previously voted against blessings, and the ELCIC&#x27;s full communion partner, the Anglican Church of Canada, had voted to defer a decision. On June 23, 2007, at its National Convention, the ELCIC voted, by a 200–181 vote margin, against authorizing the Synods to devise individual mission strategies in regard to ministering to people who live in committed same-sex relationships, including the possibility of blessing such unions. The Eastern Synod Council, while affirming its jurisdiction in the matter, agreed to hold its decision in abeyance pending a decision by the national church.
In July 2011, the National Convention of the ELCIC adopted a new social statement on human sexuality and approved a motion allowing pastors whose conscience permits, in consultation with their congregations, to preside at marriages for same-gender couples. Some have claimed that the adoption of &quot;ELCIC Social Statement on Human Sexuality&quot; openly violates Article 2 of the ELCIC constitution, and have challenged the adoption as a violation of the ELCIC&#x27;s constitution. A challenge was placed before the ELCIC&#x27;s Court of Adjudication. The Court found that the complainant did not have the status required by the Constitution to press the complaint and declined to hear the complaint. As a result of the 2011 vote and the court&#x27;s decision, the ELCIC today permits the blessing of same-sex unions and the ordination of openly gay or lesbian pastors.

<text>Ralph Rainger ( Reichenthal; October 7, 1901 – October 23, 1942) was an American composer of popular music principally for films.

==Biography==
Born Ralph Reichenthal in New York City, United States, Rainger initially embarked on a legal career, having obtained his law degree at Brown University in 1926. He had, however, studied piano from a young age and attended the Institute of Musical Art in New York. Public performances include radio broadcasts from New York and WOR (New Jersey) as early as 1922. These were as soloist, accompanist to singers, and as duo-pianist with Adam Carroll or &quot;Edgar Fairchild&quot; (the name Milton Suskind used for commercial work).

He also prepared piano rolls between 1922 and 1928 for Ampico, Standard, and DeLuxe. Some of these used the &quot;Reichenthal&quot; surname, others the &quot;Rainger&quot; name he was gradually adopting commercially.

Other early musical activities include arranging for bandleader Ray Miller. His own band leading included a 1923 engagement—Ralph Reichenthal Orchestra—at the Asbury Park (NJ) Claredon-Brunswick Hotel.

Rainger&#x27;s first credit on Broadway, 1926&#x27;s &quot;Queen High&quot;, was as duo-pianist in the pit with Fairchild, following the show&#x27;s break-in in Philadelphia. He later played for 1928&#x27;s &quot;Angela&quot; and &quot;Cross my Heart&quot;.

His first hit &quot;Moanin&#x27; Low&quot;, with lyrics by Howard Dietz, was written for Clifton Webb&#x27;s co-star Libby Holman in the 1929 revue &quot;The Little Show&quot;. Webb, tracing the song&#x27;s origin, noted that Rainger was Webb&#x27;s accompanist in vaudeville when Webb was invited to appear in the new show, and that Webb had asked Rainger for a contribution.

With the advent of motion picture sound and the film musical, Rainger and other songwriters found work in Hollywood. He teamed up with lyricist Leo Robin to produce a string of successful film songs, including &quot;I&#x27;ll Take An Option On You&quot;, from the Broadway hit show &quot;Tattle Tales&quot; (1933).

In the years that followed, Rainger wrote or collaborated on such hit songs as &quot;I Wished on the Moon&quot;, &quot;Love in Bloom&quot; (comedian Jack Benny&#x27;s theme song), &quot;Faithful Forever&quot;, &quot;Easy Living&quot;, &quot;June in January&quot;, &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot;, and with Leo Robin on the 1938 Oscar-winning song &quot;Thanks for the Memory&quot;, sung by Bob Hope in the film &quot;The Big Broadcast of 1938&quot;.

Songwriting for Hollywood&#x27;s mass audience had its challenges, as lyricist Leo Robin noted:

On the stage after all, you can aim at a particular audience. You can please just New York, or just a small portion of New York. In pictures you have to please the whole country, and most of the world besides. The songs must have universal appeal, get down to something that every human being feels and can understand. That isn&#x27;t so hard really, once you get the trick of simplicity.
Rainger paid one year&#x27;s tuition fees to the Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg in advance, so that Schoenberg could pay for the transportation of his belongings to Los Angeles from Paris in 1933.

Rainger died in a plane crash near Palm Springs, California, in 1942. He was a passenger aboard American Airlines Flight 28, a DC-3 airliner that was involved in a mid-air collision with a U.S. Army Air Corps bomber. Rainger, then age 41, was survived by his wife, Elizabeth (&quot;Betty&quot;), an eight-year-old son, and two daughters, aged five and one. In the initial 1942 press coverage of the crash, the collision was not acknowledged; Betty Rainger later sued American Airlines and won a substantial judgement late in 1943.

<text>Marcus Junius Silanus (AD 14–54) was a Roman senator.

==Biography==
He was the eldest son of Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus and Aemilia Lepida. His mother was the great-granddaughter of the emperor Augustus. As a member of the imperial family, Silanus could therefore be considered a possible candidate for the succession. Silanus was born the same year his great-great-grandfather, Augustus, died.

Although he was honoured with a consulship by the Emperor Claudius in 46, and served as proconsular governor of Asia, Silanus did not survive the death of that Emperor. Although Tacitus exonerates Nero of Silanus&#x27; death, the &#x27;first crime of the new principate,&#x27; the historian casts Agrippina, Nero&#x27;s mother, as the architect of the murder, on the grounds that she feared that Silanus would avenge his brother&#x27;s death, of which she was the perpetrator. As with Claudius, poison was the means to Silanus&#x27; end; the epitomator of Dio Cassius&#x27; &quot;Roman History&quot; tells us that Agrippina sent Silanus the same poison which she gave her late husband; and Tacitus informs us that the lethal drug was administered by a Roman of the Equestrian class named Publius Celerius, with the aid of a freedman named Helius. The pair committed the crime openly, and the Province of Asia eventually prosecuted Celerius for this deed; moreover, according to Tacitus, Nero saw to it that the prosecution was delayed to such an extent that Celerius died of old age.

Silanus&#x27; son, Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus, whom Tacitus calls a young man of moderation (&quot;modesta iuventa&quot;), was considered a threat on similar grounds as his father had been, and informers soon invented a conspiracy implicating him and his aunt Junia Lepida on charges of magic rites and incest. Upon being exiled to Bari, he was set upon by a centurion and some guards. Young Silanus, however, did not open his veins, when invited to do so; he went down fighting with his fists, and Tacitus notes that the centurion was forced to run him through with his sword; his fatal wound, according to the historian, was in front.

<doc id="848952" wikidata="Q4360103" url="?curid=848952" title="The Sandkings">
<text>&quot;The Sandkings&quot; is a 1995 Canadian-American television film based on the 1979 novella &quot;Sandkings&quot; by George R. R. Martin, and the first episode of the revived 1960s science-fiction television series &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;. It premiered on 26 March 1995 on Showtime and features three generations of the Bridges acting family: Beau, his father Lloyd, and son Dylan. Kim Coates and Helen Shaver also star.

The episode garnered five Gemini Award nominations. One of these was in the category of Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series for Beau Bridges&#x27; leading role as Simon Kress, which also garnered nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series and the CableACE Award for Best Actor in a Dramatic Series.

==Plot==
Dr. Simon Kress&#x27; (Beau Bridges) research for the government on Martian life is aborted because one of his specimens escaped his lab and almost made it to the surface. However, Kress does not agree with the abandonment of the project and decides to continue his experiments in his barn. He steals sand containing Martian eggs from his lab and creates a makeshift incubator to hatch more of the Martian lifeforms, which are dubbed &quot;sandkings.&quot; Kress&#x27; obsession with the project causes his relationship with his wife Cathy (Helen Shaver) to break down. The family dog, Cowboy, is eaten by sandkings after stepping into their territory, having been awoken by their digging.

The sandkings evolve into two distinct groups, a white group and a red group, and they settle on opposite sides of their glass enclosure. Kress comes to believe that he is a god to his sandkings when the white group builds a sand structure that resembles his face. He smashes the sand structure of the red group who did not do the same, one of them getting loose and stinging him. He kills his former supervisor Dave Stockley (Kim Coates) by tossing him into the enclosure, where the sandkings then devour him. Later, he finds himself in the basement with the red sandkings, who have made a nest with the face of Stockley. He breaks a gas pipe to cause an explosion in an attempt to kill all of the sandkings. In the ending of the episode, a colony of sandkings is shown surviving in the wilderness.

==Aftermath==
The Sandkings thrived after their escape from Kress&#x27; home laboratory. Fragments from the episode are included in the final episode of season one, &quot;The Voice of Reason&quot;. There, clips from &quot;The Sandkings&quot; are used to support an argument that the Earth is undergoing a number of different alien invasions. Later in the episode, two alien conspirators acknowledge, in private conversation, that the Sandkings could become a serious problem in about thirty years, assuming that they could survive in a methane-based atmosphere, which the aliens intended to gradually transform from the Earth&#x27;s human-friendly one.

In the sixth-season episode &quot;Final Appeal&quot;, we discover that the Sandkings plague has been eradicated, which took &quot;the better part of a decade&quot; to complete.

==Differences from the original story==
* The action of the original story &quot;Sandkings&quot; by George R. R. Martin takes place in the distant future on a faraway planet colonized by humans.
* The original story does not specify the planet of Sandkings&#x27; origin.
* Simon Kress is possessed by neither scientific interest nor desire to receive the Nobel Prize but simple cruelty (there is a difference between cruelty and aggression), the application of which influences the sandkings.
* There are no Maws that act to control the Sandkings.
* No betting takes place, even though that is a fairly major plot point in the original story.
* The faces don&#x27;t change based on the SandKing&#x27;s perception of their &quot;God&quot;.
* There are only 2 groups, not 4.
* There is no psionics explaining any of the characters&#x27; action.
* There are two murders instead of at least ten.
* There is no real elaboration about the Sandkings.
* Most of the horror elements have been removed; the original story was mostly science fiction with a small bit of horror.
* All of the actions taken to destroy the SandKings are changed.
* The protagonist is a family man, as opposed to a wealthy bachelor in the novelette.
* Without the Maws and their increasing size and intelligence as well as their psionic ability, there is no way to examine the idea of superintelligence or evolution.
* In the original story, at least one alien is involved in importing the Sandkings; in this retelling, humans bring the Kings back themselves.
* The episode examines the themes of hubris and ecological catastrophe rather than the responsibility of a parent (&quot;God&quot;) to a child and how that child will &quot;grow up&quot;.

==Awards and nominations==
* In 1995, for the role of Simon Kress, actor Beau Bridges was nominated for an Emmy Award in the category &quot;Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series&quot;.
* In 1996, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; TV-series was nominated for some Gemini Awards, including Beau Bridges receiving a nomination in the category &quot;Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series&quot;, and the episode &quot;SandKings&quot; was nominated in the category &quot;Best TV Movie or Mini-Series&quot; and &quot;Best Sound in a Dramatic Program or Series&quot;. Also, for this episode, Joseph L. Scanlan was nominated for &quot;Best Direction in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series&quot;, and Peter Outerbridge was nominated for Best Performance by an &quot;Actor in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series&quot;.
* Beau Bridges was nominated for the CableACE Award for Best Actor in a Dramatic Series.

<doc id="848963" wikidata="Q30587601" url="?curid=848963" title="Video game censorship">
<text>In video games, censorship are efforts by an authority to limit access, censor content, or regulate video games or specific video games due to the nature of their content. Some countries will do this to protect younger audiences from inappropriate content using rating systems such as the ESRB rating system. Others will do this to censor any negative outlook on a nation&#x27;s government. 

==Overview==
Support for video game regulation has at times been linked to moral panic. Even so, governments have enacted, or have tried to enact, legislation that regulates distribution of video games through censorship based on content rating systems or banning. In 2005, David Gauntlett claimed that grant funding, news headlines, and professional prestige more commonly go to authors who, in good faith, promote anti-media beliefs. Tom Grimes, James A. Anderson, and Lori Bergen reiterated these claims in a 2008 book examining sociological effects on the production of media effects research.

===Voluntary regulation===
Voluntary rating systems adopted by the video game industry, such as the ESRB rating system in the United States and Canada (established in 1994), and the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) rating system in Europe (established in 2003), are aimed at informing parents about the types of games their children are playing (or are asking to play). Some ratings of controversial games indicate they are not targeted at young children (&quot;Mature&quot; (M) or &quot;Adults Only&quot; (AO) in the US, or 15 or 18 in the UK). The packaging warns such games should not be sold to children. In the US, ESRB ratings are not legally binding, but many retailers take it upon themselves to refuse the sale of these games to minors. In the United Kingdom (UK), the BBFC ratings are legally binding. UK retailers also enforce the PEGI ratings, which are not legally binding.

== Canada ==
The Ontario Film Review Board and the British Columbia Film Classification Office respectively prohibited the sale of &quot;Manhunt&quot; and &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; to customers under the age of 18, notwithstanding their ESRB &quot;Mature&quot; ratings, by legally classifying them as films and giving them a &quot;Restricted&quot; rating. Ontario, as well as several other provinces, have since adopted laws that allow the ESRB ratings system to be enforceable by law, primarily by making it unlawful for retailers to sell &quot;Mature&quot; or &quot;Adults Only&quot; rated games to customers who are not appropriately-aged.

== China ==
Video game consoles were banned in Mainland China in June 2000. This ban was finally lifted in January 2014. However, the Chinese would still police video games which would be &quot;hostile to China or not in conformity with the outlook of China&#x27;s government&quot;. Reported by Bloomberg, metaphorically speaking, Cai Wu, head of China&#x27;s Ministry of Culture, said &quot;We want to open the window a crack to get some fresh air, but we still need a screen to block the flies and mosquitoes.&quot;.

Several video games have been banned in China due to unfavorable views on war, history, and government. In 2004, &quot;Hearts of Iron&quot; was banned as the Ministry of Culture deemed the games portrayal of World War II to be distorted. In 2013, the Chinese Ministry banned &quot;Battlefield 4&quot; as they claimed it misrepresented China and was an attempt to &quot;smears China&#x27;s image&quot;. The character of Winnie-the-Pooh has been heavily censored in China&#x27;s video games, as the characters has been frequently used in mocking comparisons to Xi Jinping.

Display of blood in Chinese game industry is strictly limited, if not banned. Before 2019, blood in many games cannot be red. The new ban prohibits the presence of any blood.

In addition, chat in Chinese video games is subject to similar or even wider restrictions as elsewhere on the Chinese Internet. For example, the chat in the English-language version of &quot;Genshin Impact&quot; censors not only swear words but also words such as Taiwan, Tibet, Hong, Kong, Falun Gong, Stalin, Hitler and Putin. A study of about 200 Chinese games found out that over 180,000 words have been subject to blacklisting.

In most cases, censorship related to China is limited to games developed in China or in Chinese versions of western games. In the 2020s, with increasing worldwide popularity of Chinese-developed games, such as with &quot;Marvel Rivals&quot; or &quot;Black Myth: Wukong&quot;, there has been more awareness of such censorship by the larger player community.

== Germany ==
=== Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle ===
In Germany, the Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle (&quot;Entertainment Software Self-Regulation&quot;) has been responsible for assigning age ratings for video games since 1994. In the past, particularly violent games were often censored by the developer or publisher in order to receive a lower rating and avoid indexing. The USK&#x27;s review of a game is voluntary, but games without approval may only be offered and sold to adults.

One notable example of censorship in Germany is that of &quot;Call of Duty: WWII&quot;. In the German version of the game, swastika symbols are removed and replaced with Iron Crosses. Another censored video game in Germany was &quot;Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus&quot;, where Hitler&#x27;s famous mustache was removed and swastikas were replaced with triangular symbols.

On August 9, 2018, USK announced that the German government will relax this Section § 86a restriction on video games, as long as the imagery included falls within the &quot;social adequacy&quot; allowance. USK will still evaluate how this imagery is used and reject games they believe fail to meet the social adequacy allowance. In November 2019, several sequels from &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; series became uncensored in Germany.

=== Bundeszentrale für Kinder- und Jugendmedienschutz ===
In Germany video games can be &quot;indexed&quot; by the Bundeszentrale für Kinder- und Jugendmedienschutz (&quot;Federal Agency for Child and Youth Protection in the Media&quot;) on the government side. Games that have been added on the &quot;list of media harmful to minors&quot; are subject to strict restrictions and may not be offered or sold to children and young people, this also applies to the advertising of games. Common reasons for indexing were the depiction and glorification of violence, war or National Socialism. Since 2003, games with a USK approval can no longer be indexed, and list entries must also be re-examined after 25 years. Since the mid-2010s, the number of newly indexed games has declined and the number of games being deleted from the list has increased, including many games that were deleted prematurely at the request of the publisher.

A significant turning point was the rejection of an indexing of Mortal Kombat X and the granting of an 18+ rating by the USK. Mortal Kombat X was the first part of the series to receive approval from the USK in Germany; until then, many titles in the series had been indexed or even confiscated.

=== Strafgesetzbuch ===
The German &quot;Strafgesetzbuch&quot; (Criminal Code) in § 86 outlaws the dissemination of propaganda material of unconstitutional and terrorist organisations, § 86a the use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations, § 130 Volksverhetzung (agitation of the people), and § 130a instructions for crimes. In the official lists, these four sections are always bundled, so any game that contains swastika flags and/or any depiction of Adolf Hitler is listed alongside racist propaganda pieces.

§ 131 outlaws representation of excessive violence in media &quot;which describe cruel or otherwise inhuman acts of violence against human or humanoid beings in a manner which expresses a glorification or rendering harmless of such acts of violence or which represents the cruel or inhuman aspects of the event in a manner which injures human dignity.&quot;

== Japan ==
Japan&#x27;s game regulatory system is CERO for home video games and EOCS, JCRC for pornographic games.

== South Korea ==
&quot;Indecent&quot; websites, such as those offering unrated games, any kind of pornography, and gambling, are also blocked. Attempts to access these sites are automatically redirected to the warning page showing &quot;This site is legally blocked by the government regulations.&quot; Search engines are required to verify age for some keywords deemed &quot;inappropriate&quot; for minors.

== Mexico ==
Mexico voluntarily adopted the ESRB rating system for rating video games.

== United States and territories ==
The United States, Puerto Rico, Samoa, Guam, Virgin Islands, and Northern Mariana Islands all voluntarily comply with the ESRB rating system.

=== History ===
The first major controversy over video games in the United States was in the early 1990s, when games such as &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; and &quot;Night Trap&quot; released, which were known for scenes that would be considered too violent or too sexual for kids. The issue regarding video games eventually made it into the United States Congress. After a proposal to have a government commission to establish video game ratings, the Interactive Digital Software Association was established by major video game corporations and presented the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB) to the Congress, which was approved and would become the standard of video game ratings.

Jack Thompson has criticized &quot;violent video games&quot;, claiming that playing violent video games leads to teenagers replicating those behaviors in the real world. He often represented victims or parents of victims in cases regarding shootings, usually blaming the actions on the perpetrator having played violent video games. Thompson also supported a campaign that tried to stop the release of &quot;Bully&quot;.

In 2013, the Entertainment Software Association, the lobbying group for the video games industry, had enlisted over 500,000 members to the &quot;Video Game Voters Network,&quot; a &quot;grassroots&quot; lobbying group to mobilize gamers to act against public policy that may negatively impact the gaming industry. The VGV was launched in 2006 by the ESA, and uses social media sites like Facebook and Twitter to inform members of allies and opponents. In 2013, the ESA spent over US$3.9 Million on lobbying, including but not limited to against VVG legislation. This included opposing a bipartisan federal bill that would direct the National Academy of Sciences to study the effects of all forms of violent media. Such bills themselves had come under criticisms from some scholars for pressuring scientists to find specific outcomes rather than studying the issues neutrally

===US government legislation===
The regulation of video games have been historically supported by politicians such as Joe Lieberman and Hillary Clinton, who have pushed legislation for regulating video games.

No video game console manufacturer has allowed any game marked AO to be published in North America; however, the PC gaming service Steam has allowed AO titles such as &quot;Hatred&quot; to be published on its platform. No major retailers are willing to sell AO-rated games, although the immensely popular PlayStation 2 game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; was briefly rated AO after the presence of the &quot;Hot Coffee&quot; add-on became evident. The add-on was later removed, with the game&#x27;s rating returning to &quot;M&quot;. In the 109th Congress and 110th Congress, the Video Games Enforcement Act was introduced to the US House of Representatives. The act required an identification check for the purchase of M and AO rated games. The bill and others like it did not succeed because of likely First Amendment violations. Although no law mandates identification checking for games with adult content, a 2008 survey by the Federal Trade Commission showed that video game retailers have voluntarily increased ID verification for M- and AO-rated games, and sales of those games to underage potential buyers decreased from 83% in 2000 to 20% in 2008. A further survey in April 2011, found that video game retailers continued to enforce the ratings by allowing only 13% of underage teenage shoppers to buy M-rated video games, a statistically significant decrease from the 20% purchase rate in 2009.

On 7 January 2009, Joe Baca, representative of California&#x27;s 43rd District, introduced H.R. 231, the &quot;Video game health labelling act&quot;. This bill called for a label to be placed in a &quot;clear and conspicuous location on the packaging&quot; on all video games with an ESRB rating of T (Teen) or higher stating,
&quot;WARNING: Excessive exposure to violent video games and other violent media has been linked to aggressive behavior.&quot; The proposed legislation was referred to the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection. On 24 January 2011, Joe Baca reintroduced the &quot;Video game health labelling act&quot; as H.R. 400 of the 112th Congress. The bill was once again passed onto the subcommittee.

On 27 June 2011, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled on &quot;Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association&quot;. Video games were protected speech under the First Amendment. The case centered on a California law that sought to restrict sales of violent video games to minors. The video game industry, led by the Entertainment Merchants Association and the Entertainment Software Association, successfully obtained an injunction on the bill, believing that the definition of violence as stated in the California law was too vague and would not treat video games as protected speech. This opinion was upheld in lower courts, and supported by the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision. The majority of the justices did not consider the studies brought to their attention as convincing evidence of harm, and stated that they could not create a new class of restricted speech that was not applied to other forms of media.
However, Justice Breyer&#x27;s minority decision found the evidence more convincing.

Deana Pollard Sacks, Brad Bushman, and Craig A. Anderson objected to the ruling, claiming that the thirteen experts who authored the Statement on Video Game Violence on the Brown side were considerably more academically merited, and had on average authored over 28 times as many peer-reviewed journal articles about aggression/violence based on original empirical research as the signatories supporting the EMA, whereas the over 100 signatories supporting Brown had on average authored over 14 times as many. Richard Hall, Ryan Hall, and Terri Day replied: &quot;It is not surprising that Anderson and Bushman found their own qualifications and the qualifications of those who agree with them to be superior to the qualifications of those who disagree with them&quot;, and claimed that they might have used methodology which have undercounted contributions of some scholars. On 3 April 2013, Dianne Feinstein, a Californian senator and Democrat, spoke in San Francisco to a group of 500 constituents about gun violence. She said video games have &quot;a very negative role for young people, and the industry ought to take note of that&quot; and that Congress might have to step in if the video games industry did not cease to glorify guns.

<doc id="848976" wikidata="Q1271806" url="?curid=848976" title="Russet-throated puffbird">
<text>The russet-throated puffbird (Hypnelus ruficollis) is a species of near-passerine bird in the family Bucconidae, the puffbirds, nunlets, and nunbirds. It is found in Colombia and Venezuela.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The taxonomy of the russet-throated puffbird is complicated. BirdLife International&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot; (HBW) assigns three subspecies, the nominate &quot;H. r. ruficolis&quot;, &quot;H. r. decolor&quot;, and &quot;H. r. coloratus&quot;. The International Ornithological Committee (IOC) adds &quot;H. r. striaticollis&quot;. Like HBW, the Clements taxonomy does not recognize &quot;striaticollis&quot;; both include it within &quot;decolor&quot;. But Clements adds &quot;H. r. bicinctus&quot; and &quot;H. r. stoicus&quot;, which the other two systems assign to the two-banded puffbird (&quot;H. bicinctus&quot;). The South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society (SACC) recognizes that treating &quot;H. bicinctus&quot; as a species might be valid but has not received a formal proposal for the split.

==Description==

The russet-throated puffbird is long and weighs . The adult of the nominate subspecies has a dark brown crown with pale brown spots, a reddish spot just over the bill, a white patch around the eye and on the cheek, and a black patch below and behind the white one. The nape has a narrow buffy or white collar. The upperparts are dull brown with grayish mottling while the closed wing is dull brown with buffy &quot;scales&quot;. The tail is long and dark brown with thin pale edges to the feathers. The chin is white and the throat and upper breast rich rufous. Under them are a thin white and a wide black band across the chest. The rest of the underparts are reddish buff with black bars or spots on the flanks. The bill is black, the eye yellow to white, and the feet black or dull green.

&quot;H. r. decolor&quot; is paler above than the nominate, its lower breast and belly are whiter, and there is less dark barring on the flanks. &quot;H. r. coloratus&quot; compared to the nominate has blacker cheeks, a deeper orange throat, and underparts that are a richer orange-buff.

==Distribution and habitat==

The four subspecies of russet-throated puffbird recognized by the IOC are distributed thus:

*&quot;H. r. decolor&quot;, extreme northeastern Colombia into western Venezuela
*&quot;H. r. ruficollis&quot;, northern Colombia and western Venezuela
*&quot;H. r. striaticollis&quot;, northwestern Venezuela&#x27;s Zulia and Falcón states
*&quot;H. r. coloratus&quot;, western Venezuela south of Lake Maracaibo

The species inhabits a variety of open to semi-open landscapes including the interior and edges of open deciduous forest, treed savanna, dense secondary forest, and arid scrub with scattered trees. In elevation it has been recorded up to in Venezuela and as high as about in Colombia. It is thought to be a year-round resident throughout its range.

==Behavior==
===Feeding===

The russet-throated puffbird still-hunts from a perch up to above ground. It sallies to capture prey on the ground, in vegetation, or on branches or trunks. Its diet is mostly insects but also includes small vertebrates like lizards and some fruits.

===Breeding===

The russet-throated puffbird has been documented breeding in May in Colombia and in August and September in Venezuela. It usually excavates a burrow in an arboreal termitarium and occasionally uses the oven-shaped nest of pale-legged hornero (&quot;Furnarius leucopus&quot;). The clutch size is three eggs.

===Vocalization===

The russet-throated puffbird&#x27;s song is &quot;repeated rhythmic &#x27;woduk&#x27; notes in crescendo for up to 20 seconds, then diminishing&quot;. It is usually sung at dawn and often by both members of a pair. They also make a &quot;seeeeep&quot; call.

==Status==

The IUCN has assessed the russet-throated puffbird as being of Least Concern. It has a large range, and though its population size has not been determined it is believed to be stable. It occurs in at least one protected area in each of Colombia and Venezuela.

<text>The two-banded puffbird (Hypnelus bicinctus) is a species of near-passerine bird in the family Bucconidae, the puffbirds, nunlets, and nunbirds. It is found in Colombia and Venezuela.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The taxonomy of the two-banded puffbird is unsettled. The International Ornithological Committee (IOC) and BirdLife International&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot; (HBW) consider it a species. They assign two subspecies, the nominate &quot;H. b. bicinctus&quot; and &quot;H. b. stoicus&quot;. However, the Clements taxonomy treats the two as subspecies of the russet-throated puffbird (&quot;H. ruficollis&quot;). The South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society (SACC) recognizes that treating &quot;H. bicinctus&quot; as a species might be valid but has not received a formal proposal for the split.

==Description==

The adult of the nominate subspecies of two-banded puffbird has a dark brown crown with pale brown spots, a buffy patch from the bill to the eye, a whitish patch on the cheek, and a black patch below and behind the white one. The nape has a narrow whitish collar. The upperparts are dull brown with whitish mottling while the closed wing is dull brown with whitish scallops. The tail is long and dark brown with thin pale edges to the feathers. The chin is whitish and the throat and upper breast reddish buff. Under them are two black bands across the chest. The rest of the belly is reddish buff with black spots on its upper edge and the flanks are whitish with large black spots. &quot;H. b. stoicus&quot; is similar but slightly browner and paler above, has a less dramatically marked face, and has buff tips to the feathers of the upper breastband.

==Distribution and habitat==

The nominate subspecies of two-banded puffbird is found in the llanos of northeastern Colombia and into northern Venezuela almost to Lake Maracaibo on the west, east to near the Guyana border, and south slightly into Amazonas and Bolívar states. &quot;H. b. stoicus&quot; is found only on Margarita Island off the central Venezuelan coast. On the mainland it inhabits open and near open landscapes including the llanos savanna, thickets, abandoned farms, and the edges of deciduous woodland. It occurs almost exclusively below of elevation. On Margarita it inhabits bushland and woods from plains into the foothills. No seasonal movements have been documented, though its habitat undergoes seasonal changes. It sometimes is common in an area and then vacates it for several years.

==Behavior==
===Feeding===

The two-banded puffbird still-hunts from a high open perch or a lower shaded one. It sallies to capture its prey; its diet has not been fully documented but is known to include insects.

===Breeding===

The two-banded puffbird&#x27;s breeding season appears to include May and June, though details are lacking. It excavates a burrow in an arboreal termitarium. Its clutch size has not been determined, but that of its former conspecific russet-throated puffbird is three eggs.
===Vocalization===

The two-banded puffbird&#x27;s song is &quot;a rhythmic repeated &#x27;tak-ta-tóoo&#x27;&quot; and its call &quot;a croaking note, surpisingly loud&quot; that is sometimes given in flight.

==Status==

The IUCN has assessed the two-banded puffbird as being of Least Concern. It has a large range, and though its population size has not been determined it is believed to be stable. It is generally common throughout its mainland range, and &quot;human land uses do not appear to pose any immediate threats.&quot; Its status on Margarita Island isn&#x27;t known.

<doc id="848985" wikidata="Q276690" url="?curid=848985" title="That Girl">
<text>That Girl is an American television sitcom that ran on ABC from September 8, 1966, to March 19, 1971. It starred Marlo Thomas as the title character, Ann Marie, an aspiring (but only sporadically employed) actress who moves from her hometown of Brewster, New York, to try to make it big in New York City. Ann has to take a number of offbeat temp jobs to support herself in between her various auditions and bit parts.

It was one of the first sitcoms to focus on an unmarried woman who was not a domestic or living with her parents, a forerunner of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;.

Ted Bessell played her boyfriend Donald Hollinger, a writer for &quot;Newsview Magazine&quot;. Lew Parker and Rosemary DeCamp played Lew Marie and Helen Marie, her concerned parents. Bernie Kopell and Ruth Buzzi played Ann and Donald&#x27;s friends. &quot;That Girl&quot; was developed by writers Bill Persky and Sam Denoff, who had served as head writers on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; (which Thomas&#x27; father, Danny Thomas, co-produced) earlier in the 1960s.

==Premise==
The show reflected the changing roles of American women in feminist-era America. Thomas&#x27; goofy charm, together with Bessell&#x27;s dry wit, made &quot;That Girl&quot; a solid performer on the ABC Television Network, although the series never made the top thirty during its entire five-year run.

At the end of the 1969–1970 season, &quot;That Girl&quot; was still doing moderately well in the ratings, but after four years Thomas had grown tired of the series and wanted to move on. ABC convinced her to do one more year. In the beginning of the fifth season, Don and Ann became engaged, but they never actually married. The decision to leave the couple engaged at the end of the run was largely the idea of Thomas. She did not want to send a message to young women that marriage was the ultimate goal for them, and she worried that it would have undercut the somewhat feminist message of the show.

==Intro==
Every episode started with a small cold open; the dialogue would always turn to Ann, as one of the characters would make an assertive reference to her as &quot;that girl&quot;; the camera would freeze frame on a surprised Ann. This was followed by the opening credits and theme music (written by Earle Hagen). During the first four seasons, the theme song was instrumental only; in the fifth and final season, lyrics (written by Denoff) were added.

==Production notes==
According to Marlo Thomas, she was approached by ABC executive Edgar Scherick, who saw her in a screen test for a failed pilot, but still wanted to feature her in a project. Scherick gave Thomas several scripts to read, none of which she liked, as they all focused on a woman who was either a traditional girlfriend, wife or secretary to someone else; Thomas wanted a show in which the main character was a young, modern woman focused on her dreams and aspirations.

Although never officially credited as such (Persky and Denoff were the series&#x27; creators and official executive producers), Thomas was also a &quot;de facto&quot; executive producer of the series through her Daisy Productions, which she formed specifically for the series; it was credited on-screen as the production company. She originally wanted to name the sitcom &quot;Miss Independence&quot;, the nickname given to her by her parents.

Manhattan exterior shots were filmed in several days. Initially, the apartment was located off the East River on the Upper East Side, in the former East End Hotel (originally known as the Junior League Hotel for Working Women) at 78th Street and the FDR Drive, as seen in several first-season episodes, including &quot;What&#x27;s in a Name&quot; where Ann can be seen exiting a taxicab. In the episode entitled &quot;That Señorita&quot;, Ann lists her address as 627 East 54th Street. In the second season - with a new exterior - in the episode &quot;Nothing to Be Afreud of but Freud Himself&quot;, Donald gives out her address as 344 West 78th Street, Apartment D. Ann&#x27;s acting school was modeled after the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre on East 54th Street between First and Second Avenues. &quot;That Girl&quot; was filmed at Desilu-Cahuenga Studios (for many years called Ren-Mar Studios and now called Red Studios Hollywood), located at 846 North Cahuenga Boulevard in Hollywood.

==Episodes==
Five complete seasons of &quot;That Girl&quot; aired, with the series finale airing on March 19, 1971. Over the five seasons, a total of 136 episodes aired. Thomas&#x27; sister Terre, her brother Tony, and father Danny Thomas all appeared in a 1969 episode
called &quot;My Sister&#x27;s Keeper&quot;.

===Pilot===
The only episode never shown during the series&#x27; original network run was the pilot produced in 1965. The major differences were evident in its opening credits. Bessell&#x27;s character was Don Blue Sky, Ann&#x27;s talent agent who was part Cherokee, and Harold Gould and Penny Santon played her parents. By the time the series aired on ABC, Thomas and Bessell were the only actors to receive top billing.

The pilot episode centered on Ann&#x27;s attempt to adopt a stage name based on her agent&#x27;s suggestion. After her use of &quot;Marie Brewster&quot; (the names of her family and hometown combined) was met with disapproval from her parents, she decided to not make the change in the end. This storyline and numerous scenes were recycled into the 11th episode of Season 1 titled &quot;What&#x27;s in a Name?&quot; from November 17, 1966.

The pilot was included in the 5-disc set of &quot;That Girl&quot;: Season One, which was released by Shout! Factory in 2006. It has since been added to the series&#x27; broadcast syndication package; it led off a New Year&#x27;s Day marathon on MeTV at the start of 2012.

===Syndication and home media===
ABC aired reruns of the show on its daytime schedule from June 1969 to March 1972. Reruns have aired on TV Land from the network&#x27;s launch in 1996 to 1998. On January 1, 2012, &quot;That Girl&quot; reruns returned to national television on MeTV with episodes shown on weekday mornings and Sunday afternoons until September 1, 2013. On September 1, 2014, the show returned to MeTV. The series is currently distributed by Paul Brownstein Productions. From January 2, 2020, to December 31, 2023, the show aired on Antenna TV. Starting September 2, 2024, it currently airs on Catchy Comedy. The series is currently available on Tubi and Amazon Prime.

Shout! Factory has released all five seasons on DVD in Region 1. Each release contains extensive bonus features including episodic promos, featurettes, commentary tracks and the original pilot episode.

In Region 4, Madman Entertainment has released all five seasons on DVD in Australia/New Zealand. On April 21, 2010, Madman released &quot;That Girl: The Complete Series&quot;, a 21-disc box set that features all 136 episodes, as well as extensive bonus features.

==Novel==
* Paul W. Fairman, &quot;That Girl&quot;, New York: Popular Library, 1971. 125 pp.
:Newly engaged Ann travels to Maine to take the role of Cathy in a production of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; but finds herself embroiled in a real-life gothic.

==Spin-offs==
In 1973, Rankin/Bass produced &quot;That Girl in Wonderland&quot;, an animated television special in which Marlo Thomas reprised the role of Ann. It aired as an episode of &quot;The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie&quot; on January 13, 1973. The special also featured the voices of Patricia Bright, Dick Hehmeyer, Rhoda Mann, and Ted Schwartz.

==Popular culture==

The series&#x27; theme song and opening visuals have been parodied in pop culture several times. They appeared as a series of T-shirts, then as a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; skit featuring Danitra Vance in an African American remake &quot;That Black Girl&quot;, and as a sequence on episodes of &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Clarissa Explains It All&quot;, &quot;Arthur&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Roseanne&quot;.

The 2011 advertising campaign for the launch of Fox&#x27;s sitcom &quot;New Girl&quot; featured posters of that sitcom&#x27;s star, Zooey Deschanel, in the make-up, pose and graphic look of Marlo Thomas from the original &quot;That Girl&quot; series.

<doc id="848986" wikidata="Q11165895" url="?curid=848986" title="Geheimrat">
<text> was the title of the highest advising officials at the imperial, royal, or princely courts of the Holy Roman Empire, who jointly formed the &quot;Geheimer Rat&quot; reporting to the ruler. The term remained in use during subsequent monarchic reigns in German-speaking areas of Europe until the end of the First World War. At its origin the literal meaning of the word in German was &#x27;trusted advisor&#x27;; the word &quot;geheim&quot; (secret) implies that such an advisor could be trusted with the Monarch&#x27;s secrets (similar to &quot;secretary&quot; in English being linguistically related to &quot;secret&quot;). The English-language equivalent is Privy Councillor.

The office contributing to the state&#x27;s politics and legislation had its roots in the age of absolutism from the 17th century onward, when a governmental administration by a dependent bureaucracy was established similar to the French . A precursor was the &quot;Reichshofrat&quot;, a judicial body established by Emperor Maximilian I of Habsburg. In Austria, the professional title of Hofrat (also Hofrath, Court Councillor) has remained in use as an official title for deserved civil servants up to today.

With the Empire&#x27;s dissolution and the rise of Constitutionalism in the aftermath of the French Revolution, the office of a became an honorific title conferred by the German states upon high officials, accompanied by the address &quot;Exzellenz&quot;. During that period related titles no longer affiliated with an office arose, like , an award for outstanding contributions in the field of commerce and industry, or &quot;&quot;, an award for outstanding contributions to medicine. The term is also used in combination with the word &quot;Ecke&quot; – , colloquially describing male pattern baldness at the &#x27;edges&#x27; of the forehead (i.e. the upper &#x27;corners&#x27; of the face).

In the Republic of Austria the title was officially abolished in 1919. In Germany, the title largely disappeared after the fall of the German Empire in 1918, when the various princely states of Germany were replaced by the constituent states of the Weimar Republic, although &quot;Geheimräte&quot; continued to be appointed by the Free State of Bavaria. However, many honorees continued to use it, and the title , its abbreviation and related abbreviations (, and even ) appear in captions until the 1930s, such as used by the German Federal Archives.

<doc id="848989" wikidata="Q449727" url="?curid=848989" title="Alweg">
<text>Alweg was a transportation company based in Germany known for pioneering straddle-beam monorails.

==History==
Alweg was founded by Swedish industrial magnate Dr. Axel Lennart Wenner-Gren in January 1953 as Alweg-Forschung, GmbH (Alweg Research Corporation), based in Fühlingen, a suburb of Cologne, Germany. The company was an outgrowth of the Verkehrsbahn-Studiengesellschaft (Transit Railway Study Group), which had already presented its first monorail designs and prototypes in the previous year. The Alweg name is an acronym derived from Dr. Wenner-Gren&#x27;s full name.

Alweg is best remembered for their role in building the original Disneyland Monorail System at Disneyland, which opened in 1959, and the Seattle Center Monorail, which opened for the 1962 Century 21 Exposition. Both systems remain operational, with the Seattle Center Monorail still using the original Alweg trains which have traveled over one million miles. A third system, built in Turin for the Italia 61 exposition remained unused a few months after the exposition closed and was destroyed by a fire in the late 1970s, most probably set by vandals. The remnants of the system were scrapped in 1981, with the north station repurposed as an office building.

In 1963, Alweg put forward a proposal to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors for a monorail system that would be designed, built, operated and maintained within Los Angeles County, California by Alweg. Alweg promised to take all financial risk for the construction with the cost of the system to be recovered through fares collected. The supervisors voted down the proposal, mostly due to political pressures from Standard Oil of California and General Motors, which were strong advocates for automobile dependency. This move was greatly resented by famed author Ray Bradbury who supported the monorail project and resented the later move to build a subway in Los Angeles.

Alweg&#x27;s technology was licensed in 1960 by Hitachi Monorail, which continues to construct monorails based on Alweg technology around the world. What was for decades the world&#x27;s busiest monorail line, the Tokyo Monorail, was completed in 1964 by what was then the Hitachi-Alweg division of Hitachi, and today&#x27;s busiest monorail system, Chongqing Rail Transit, is also based on Alweg and Hitachi technology.

After Alweg ran into financial difficulties, Alweg&#x27;s German operations were taken over by Krupp. Krupp wound up all Alweg operations by 1964.

In the 1960s there was a plan to build an Alweg monorail in the High Tatras in Slovakia.

<doc id="848998" wikidata="Q3748058" url="?curid=848998" title="Forever People">
<text>Forever People are a group of extraterrestrial superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. They first appeared in &quot;Forever People&quot; #1 (cover-dated February-March 1971), and were created by Jack Kirby as part of his &quot;Fourth World&quot; epic.

==Publication history==
The protagonists of the series are a group of young New Gods from New Genesis who were on a mission to oppose Darkseid on Earth, and talked, dressed, and acted much like the flower children of the 1960s. In addition to the individual abilities and equipment of the members, the group can join together using the technology of a Mother Box to summon the powerful hero known as the Infinity-Man. The group travels by use of their Super-Cycle. The first issue of their title also introduced the Boom Tube, a type of portal used by the New Gods.

Their own title, &quot;The Forever People&quot;, debuted in 1971 and lasted 11 issues. They mainly fought Darkseid&#x27;s forces, such as Glorious Godfrey in issue #3. Issues #9 and 10 guest-starred Deadman; according to writer/artist Jack Kirby&#x27;s assistant Mark Evanier: &quot;We were ordered to put Deadman into &quot;New Gods&quot;, but we slipped him into &quot;Forever People&quot; instead, where he was a little less obtrusive. Jack didn&#x27;t like the character and didn&#x27;t want to do it. He didn&#x27;t feel he should be doing someone else&#x27;s character. ... He doesn&#x27;t want to trample on someone else&#x27;s vision. Carmine said the character hadn&#x27;t sold and he wanted the Kirby touch on it.&quot; The series ended on a cliffhanger, with the Forever People stranded on Adon.

In a 1986 interview Kirby recalled that &quot;the Forever People were the wonderful people of the &#x27;60s, who I loved. If you&#x27;ll watch the actions of the Forever People, you&#x27;ll see the reflection of the &#x27;60s in their attitudes,
in the backgrounds, in their clothes. You&#x27;ll see the &#x27;60s. I felt I would leave a record of the &#x27;60s in their adventures.&quot;

In 1988, a six-issue &quot;Forever People&quot; limited series by writer J. M. DeMatteis and artist Paris Cullins was published, showing what happens to the Forever People on Adon. This series reveals that the Forever People were originally humans who were saved from death and brought to New Genesis. They returned to Earth to oppose &quot;the Darkness&quot;, a sentient but disembodied force of hopelessness. They were aided by a mysterious being, Maya, who is ultimately revealed to be the consciousness of their Mother Box.

In &quot;Death of the New Gods&quot;, the origin of the Forever People was retconned, and it is hinted that the five were to have been the first of the next evolution of the New Gods — godlings becoming more than the sum of their parts. Furthermore, the group are killed by Infinity-Man.

In the &quot;Final Crisis Sketchbook&quot;, the Forever People (along with other members of the New Gods) are given updated looks, which Grant Morrison calls &quot;more gothic art school student than flower power&quot;. In the event itself, Japan&#x27;s pop culture team, the Super Young Team, are revealed to be the Fifth World incarnation of the Forever People.

The Forever People appear in &quot;The New 52&quot; series &quot;Infinity Man and the Forever People&quot;. Serifan is depicted as female and Vykin&#x27;s sister.

==Original members==
===Beautiful Dreamer===
During the original Kirby run, Beautiful Dreamer had been linked romantically to Mark Moonrider, although outside of hand-holding, the exact nature of their relationship was never directly specified. In the 1988 miniseries, it was established that Dreamer had been married to Big Bear, and together they had a child, named Maya after the spirit of their old Mother Box. Since then, their marriage and daughter has been voided by a retcon during John Byrne&#x27;s &quot;Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World&quot; series. When last shown, Dreamer was romantically involved with Takion.

In &quot;Superman &amp; Batman: Generations 3&quot;, she marries Superman, and has his children, Lar-El and Vara. All three are killed by Darkseid.

====Powers and abilities====
Like all the children of New Genesis, Beautiful Dreamer possesses the advanced physiology of a New God; she is extremely long-lived, has a limited degree of superhuman strength, resistance and reflexes. She is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant. She has psionic powers that allow her to create illusions and to scan people&#x27;s minds to produce familiar images. In addition, she has been able to feel the fluctuations within the Source.

===Big Bear===
Big Bear had been married to Beautiful Dreamer, and she had been pregnant with their daughter. A shift in time resulted in the marriage never happening and the child never having existed. This traumatized Beautiful Dreamer for a time. In &quot;Forever People&quot; #7, he was shown to have been responsible for the historical event that led to the legend of King Arthur.

====Powers and abilities====
Bear possesses superhuman strength that is further enhanced by a flow of high-density atoms. He is also the pilot of the Super-Cycle and an avid Earth history buff.

===Mark Moonrider===
During the original Kirby run, Beautiful Dreamer had been linked romantically to Mark Moonrider, although outside of hand-holding, the exact nature of their relationship was never specified. In the 1988 miniseries set on Adon, Mark was shown to have fallen in love with, and later married, one of the natives, Mina. They had three children (Merry, Wendy and Starbright), but when the shift in time caused by the Darkness&#x27; actions undid the events which &#x27;evolved&#x27; the natives, this marriage never occurred, leaving Mark with only his friends.

====Powers and abilities====
In addition to being extremely long-lived, Mark has superhuman strength and reflexes and is resistant to conventional injury. Also, he has a keen mind with good leadership skills and he is well-trained in hand-to-hand combat. He possesses a Megaton Touch that enables him to generate lethal bolts of electricity.

===Serifan===
Serifan is the youngest member of the group, as well as the most vulnerable. The Dark saw this and possessed Serifan, using him to conquer Forevertown and plague the Forever People. After the Dark was defeated he returned to his normal self.

====Powers and abilities====
Serifan possesses limited telepathic powers, and wields &quot;cosmic cartridges&quot; that serve various purposes when wielded. For example, the cartridges can link Serifan to the Source, create force fields, drain energy, manipulate gravity, modify atomic density, generate intense heat, power vehicles, and stun others. His &quot;Blue Cartridge&quot; can manipulate life force and was used to help Deadman merge with a &quot;Follower&quot;, an organic machine designed to act as his physical body.

===Vykin===
Throughout the Kirby run, Vykin was referred to as &quot;Vykin the Black&quot;. He was the second black superhero to appear in a DC comic book, preceding Kirby&#x27;s Black Racer by several months. When the Forever People were stranded on Adon, Mark Moonrider thought it would be advantageous to civilize the people of the planet. When Vykin used their Mother Box to do so, it overloaded and was destroyed, killing Vykin in the process, but managing to create Forevertown. When the Dark overtook and reversed the effects of the Mother Box, Vykin was brought back to life. Recently he was reunited on New Genesis with his mother, Valkyra the Commander, who rode a robotic pegasus. Later on, she sacrificed her life to save her lover Orion.

====Powers and abilities====
Like all New Gods, Vykin is functionally immortal and all his physical attributes are superhuman. He can manipulate magnetism and is skilled in working with complicated machinery. Vykin has a keen mind and is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant. It is Vykin who carries the Forever People&#x27;s Mother Box, a kind of sentient computer, and is attuned to her frequencies. He is also a language major.

===Infinity-Man===
Infinity-Man is Drax, the older brother of Uxas, who would later become Darkseid of Apokolips, and became the Infinity-Man after treachery at the hands of Uxas while attempting to harness the Omega Force for himself. No explanation was given as to why he was involved with the Forever People other than Big Bear&#x27;s offhanded comment that they have an arrangement with him. The Infinity-Man&#x27;s powers were never fully cataloged other than having some direct link to the Source, and the suggestion that since he originated from outside our universe, he was not bound by its physical laws. He was shown capable of flight, super-strength, enhanced vision powers, infini-beams, the ability to negate gravity and convert it into a repulsive force, restructuring atoms to pass through solid matter, and redirecting the flight path of bullets.

==Fifth World==

The Super Young Team are the contemporary Fifth World incarnations of the Forever People. Created by writer Grant Morrison in the early &quot;52&quot; stages of their DC Universe &quot;Final Crisis&quot; storyline, they are influenced by American super-heroes and Japanese pop culture, and were first mentioned in &quot;52&quot; #6. This group recruits Sonny Sumo, a powerful fighter who assisted the original Forever People in the first series.

==Other versions==
The Un-People, a fusion of the Forever People and Marvel Comics group the Inhumans, appear in the Amalgam Comics one-shot &quot;Challengers of the Fantastic&quot;.

<text>Alan Morton McCulloch is the leader of the small One New Zealand political party in New Zealand, and previously served as president of the party. He was mayor of East Coast Bays from 1974 to 1983, and has also served in a number of roles in North Shore, such as president of Grey Power, and stood as a candidate for the office of mayor of North Shore City.

In 1977, McCulloch was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal.

He claims that New Zealand is currently heading towards racial separatism, and strongly opposes what he sees as special treatment for New Zealand&#x27;s Māori ethnic minority.

McCulloch was a speculated candidate for the National Party nomination at the 1980 East Coast Bays by-election. However he did not make the candidate shortlist which was won by economist Don Brash. In the 2002 elections, he was ranked third on the One New Zealand list. He also contested the East Coast Bays electorate, coming sixth with 1.7% of the vote.

After the One New Zealand party disbanded, McCulloch later ran for the Auckland mayoralty in 2010 as an independent.

<doc id="849015" wikidata="Q935114" url="?curid=849015" title="Isoquant">
<text>An isoquant (derived from &quot;quantity&quot; and the Greek word &quot;&quot;, , meaning &quot;equal&quot;), in microeconomics, is a contour line drawn through the set of points at which the same quantity of output is produced while changing the quantities of two or more inputs. The x and y axis on an isoquant represent two relevant inputs, which are usually a factor of production such as labour, capital, land, or organisation. An isoquant may also be known as an &quot;iso-product curve&quot;, or an &quot;equal product curve&quot;.

== Vs. indifference curves ==
While an indifference curve mapping helps to solve the utility-maximizing problem of consumers, the isoquant mapping deals with the cost-minimization and profit and output maximisation problem of producers. Indifference curves further differ to isoquants, in that they cannot offer a precise measurement of utility, only how it is relevant to a baseline. Whereas, from an isoquant, the product can be measured accurately in physical units, and it is known by exactly how much isoquant 1 exceeds isoquant 2.

== Nature and practical uses ==
In managerial economics, isoquants are typically drawn along with isocost curves in capital-labor graphs, showing the technological tradeoff between capital and labor in the production function, and the decreasing marginal returns of both inputs. In managerial economics, the unit of isoquant is commonly the net of capital cost. As such, isoquants by nature are downward sloping due to operation of diminishing marginal rates of technical substitution (MRTS). The slope of an isoquant represents the rate at which input x can be substituted for input y. This concept is the MRTS, so MRTS=slope of the isoquant. Thus, the steeper the isoquant, the higher the MRTS. Since MRTS must diminish, isoquants must be convex to their origin. Adding one input while holding the other constant eventually leads to decreasing marginal output.

The contour line of an isoquant represents every combination of two inputs which fully maximise a firm&#x27;s use of resources (such as budget, or time). Full maximisation of resources is usually considered &#x27;efficient&#x27;. Efficient allocation of factors of production occur only when two isoquants are tangent to one another. If a firm produces to the left of the contour line, then the firm is considered to be operating inefficiently, because they are not maximising use of their available resources. A firm cannot produce to the right of the contour line unless they exceed their constraints.

A family of isoquants can be represented by an isoquant map, a graph combining a number of isoquants, each representing a different quantity of output.An isoquant map can indicate decreasing or increasing returns to scale based on increasing or decreasing distances between the isoquant pairs of fixed output increment, as output increases. If the distance between those isoquants increases as output increases, the firm&#x27;s production function is exhibiting decreasing returns to scale; doubling both inputs will result in placement on an isoquant with less than double the output of the previous isoquant. Conversely, if the distance is decreasing as output increases, the firm is experiencing increasing returns to scale; doubling both inputs results in placement on an isoquant with more than twice the output of the original isoquant. A firm can choose to utilise the information an isoquant gives on returns to scale, by using it as insight how to allocate resources. 

Knowing how to allocate resources is a concept pertinent to managerial economics. Isoquants can be useful to graphically represent this issue of scarcity. They show the extent to which the firm in question has the ability to substitute between two different inputs (x and y in the graph) at will in order to produce the same level of output (see: Graph C)). They also represent different quantity combinations of two goods which adhere to a budget constraint. Thus, they can be used as a tool to help management make better informed decisions regarding production and profit dilemmas, such as cost or waste minimization, and revenue and output maximization.

A firm can determine the &quot;least cost combination&quot; of inputs to produce a given output, by combining isocost curves and isoquants, and adhering to first order conditions. The least cost combination is where the ratio of marginal products is equal to the ratio of factor prices. At this point, the slope of the isoquant, and the slope of the isocost, will be equal (see intersection of graph D). A firm has incentive to produce at the least cost combination because it is at this point, the related costs of desired production are minimised.

As with indifference curves, two isoquants can never cross. Also, every possible combination of inputs is on an isoquant. Finally, any combination of inputs above or to the right of an isoquant results represents a higher level of output, and vice versa. Although the marginal product of an input decreases as you increase the quantity of the input while holding all other inputs constant, the marginal product is never negative in the empirically observed range since a rational firm would never increase an input to decrease output.

==Shapes==
If the two inputs are perfect substitutes, the resulting isoquant map generated is represented in fig. A; with a given level of production Q3, input X can be replaced by input Y at an unchanging rate. The perfect substitute inputs do not experience decreasing marginal rates of return when they are substituted for each other in the production function.

If the two inputs are perfect complements, the isoquant map takes the form of fig. B; with a level of production Q3, input X and input Y can only be combined efficiently in the certain ratio occurring at the kink in the isoquant. The firm will combine the two inputs in the required ratio to maximize profit.

Isoquants are typically combined with isocost lines in order to solve a cost-minimization problem for given level of output. In the typical case shown in the top figure, with smoothly curved isoquants, a firm with fixed unit costs of the inputs will have isocost curves that are linear and downward sloped; any point of tangency between an isoquant and an isocost curve represents the cost-minimizing input combination for producing the output level associated with that isoquant. A line joining tangency points of isoquants and isocosts (with input prices held constant) is called the expansion path.

==Non-convexity==
Under the assumption of declining marginal rate of technical substitution, and hence a positive and finite elasticity of substitution, the isoquant is convex to the origin. A locally nonconvex isoquant can occur if there are sufficiently strong returns to scale in one of the inputs. In this case, there is a negative elasticity of substitution – as the ratio of input A to input B increases, the marginal product of A relative to B &quot;increases&quot; rather than decreases.

A nonconvex isoquant is prone to produce large and discontinuous changes in the price minimizing input mix in response to price changes. Consider for example the case where the isoquant is globally nonconvex, and the isocost curve is linear. In this case the minimum cost mix of inputs will be a corner solution, and include only one input (for example either input A or input B). The choice of which input to use will depend on the relative prices. At some critical price ratio, the optimum input mix will shift from all input A to all input B and vice versa in response to a small change in relative prices.

<text>Thomas Arthur (1835 – 2 March 1902) was a British Army soldier and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Victoria Cross action==
Arthur was approximately 20 years old, and a gunner and driver in the Royal Regiment of Artillery during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 7 June 1855 at Sebastopol, Crimea, Gunner Arthur was in charge of the magazine in one of the left advanced batteries of the right attack, when the Quarries were taken. On his own initiative he carried barrels of infantry ammunition for the 7th Fusiliers several times during the evening, across the open. He volunteered for and formed one of the spiking party of artillery at the assault on the Redan on 18 June 1855 and on numerous occasions left the trenches to bring in wounded officers and men.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Artillery Museum, Woolwich, London.

<text>Peter John Badcoe, (11 January 1934 – 7 April 1967) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in battle that could be awarded at that time to a member of the Australian armed forces. Badcoe, born Peter Badcock, joined the Australian Army in 1950 and graduated from the Officer Cadet School, Portsea, in 1952 as a second lieutenant in the Royal Australian Artillery. A series of regimental postings followed, including a tour in the Federation of Malaya in 1962, during which he spent a week in South Vietnam observing the fighting. During the previous year, Badcock had changed his surname to Badcoe. After another regimental posting, he transferred to the Royal Australian Infantry Corps, and was promoted to major.

In August 1966, Badcoe arrived in South Vietnam as a member of the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam. He was initially a sub-sector adviser, but in December became the operations adviser for Thừa Thiên-Huế Province. In this role, between February and April 1967, he displayed conspicuous gallantry and leadership on three occasions while on operations with South Vietnamese Regional Force units. In the final battle, he was killed by machine-gun fire. He was highly respected by both his South Vietnamese and United States allies, and was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions. He was also awarded the United States Silver Star and several South Vietnamese medals. He was buried at Terendak Garrison Cemetery in Malaysia.

In 2008, Badcoe&#x27;s medal set was auctioned for A$488,000 to Kerry Stokes in collaboration with the Government of South Australia. After going on display at the South Australian Museum and touring regional South Australia, it is now displayed in the Hall of Valour at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. Buildings and awards have been named after Badcoe, including the rest and recreation centre in South Vietnam, an assembly room and library at Portsea, the main lecture theatre at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, and a perpetual medal for an Australian Football League match held on Anzac Day; as well as the electoral district of Badcoe in the South Australian House of Assembly.

== Early life and career ==
Badcoe was born Peter John Badcock on 11 January 1934 in the Adelaide suburb of Malvern, South Australia. His father was Leslie Allen Badcock, a public servant, and his mother was Gladys Mary Ann May Overton. He was educated at Adelaide Technical High School, before gaining employment as a clerk with the South Australian Public Service in 1950. Despite his father&#x27;s opposition, Badcock held ambitions to join the Australian Army; and enlisted in the Regular Army on 10 June 1950.

After a brief posting to the 16th National Service Battalion in early 1952, Badcock entered the Officer Cadet School, Portsea, on 12 July 1952, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Australian Artillery on 13 December that year. This was followed by a short posting to the 14th National Service Training Battalion, then a posting to the 1st Field Regiment in 1953. He returned to train national servicemen at Puckapunyal, Victoria, in 1955–1957. On 26 May 1956, he married Denise Maureen MacMahon in the Methodist Church at Manly, New South Wales. The couple had three daughters – Carey, Kim and Susanne. Badcock was posted back to the 1st Field Regiment in 1957–1958.

A junior staff officer in the Directorate of Military Operations and Plans at Australian Army Headquarters from 1958 until 1961, he was promoted to temporary captain in 1958, and substantive captain in June 1960. On 6 February 1961, he was posted to the 4th Field Regiment, and the same year changed his surname to Badcoe. The couple decided to change their surname after their third daughter was born in order to make it easier for them.

On training exercises, Badcoe was aggressive and energetic. He was also a quiet, gentle and retiring man who confided mainly in his wife and had a dry wit. His colleagues found him inscrutable. He avoided boisterous mess activities and preferred reading military history. Short and stocky, a teetotaller who did not smoke, he wore horn-rimmed spectacles and regaled his colleagues on military matters when off-duty.

In June 1961, Badcoe was posted to the 103rd Field Battery as battery captain, and served a tour with them in the Federation of Malaya, attached to a British unit, in the aftermath of the Malayan Emergency. He was detached from Malaya to South Vietnam over the period 7–14 November 1962, and observed how that country was combating the Viet Cong (VC) and North Vietnamese insurgency. During his visit, Badcoe sought opportunities to experience combat. He spent five days with an Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) battalion on operations in Quảng Ngãi Province, during which the unit had contacts with the enemy, including a pitched battle. During what was supposed to be a rest period, he arranged a helicopter flight to visit a Montagnard base in the Central Highlands. When his return to Malaya was delayed by an aircraft engine breakdown, he managed to join a heliborne operation of the 7th ARVN Division in the Mekong Delta. He returned to the 1st Field Regiment in November 1962 and remained with the unit until August 1965. At this point, Badcoe transferred from the artillery to the Royal Australian Infantry Corps, and on promotion to temporary major on 10 August 1965, was posted to the Infantry Centre at Ingleburn, New South Wales. Badcoe successfully applied for a posting with the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV), and attended adviser courses at the Intelligence Centre at Mosman, New South Wales, and Jungle Training Centre in Canungra, Queensland. He was promoted to provisional major in June 1966.

== Vietnam War ==
Badcoe arrived in South Vietnam on 6 August 1966 as a member of the AATTV. He was posted as a sub-sector adviser in the Nam Hóa District of Thừa Thiên Province. Sub-sector advisers worked at the district level with two elements of the Territorial Forces, the Regional Force (RF) and Popular Force (PF), which were both forms of full-time provincial militia under control of the provincial chief, who was also the military sector chief. Each sector corresponded with a province, and each sub-sector with a district. The sector and sub-sector advisers had several responsibilities: to accompany the RF/PF, colloquially known as &quot;Ruff-Puffs&quot;, on operations; to provide on-the-job training to the RF/PF; to oversee security in the hamlets; and to liaise with the ARVN troops operating in the sector or sub-sector.

In his first week at Nam Hóa, Badcoe was advising an RF company on a clearing operation when it came under fire from VC irregulars in a treeline. As the company pressed forward, it came under fire from a bunker. Badcoe unsuccessfully tried to silence the bunker using his rifle and hand grenades, at which point the company commander suggested calling in close air support. Badcoe responded that air support was not necessary. He collected two jerrycans of petrol from a jeep following the company and then, circling around using cover, approached the bunker from outside its arc of fire. He poured both jerrycans over the bunker, backed off some distance and ignited it with a white phosphorus grenade, destroying the VC position and allowing the company to advance.

Easily identified by the maroon paratroop beret he wore, Badcoe led from the front and gave the impression he believed himself invincible. According to the former AATTV adviser and military historian Ian McNeill, enthusiasm, courage and audacity were Badcoe&#x27;s hallmarks, and those around him were often infected by his optimism. Badcoe was so fearless he appeared reckless, and was often cautioned by colleagues in this respect. Jim Pashen, a warrant officer serving with the AATTV, recalled Badcoe driving alone in a jeep from Huế to Quảng Trị, and being shot at by snipers as he passed by. Badcoe was also very interested in Vietnam, its people and their customs, and was particularly fascinated by Huế, the ancient royal city. He traded alcohol and souvenirs from the AATTV&#x27;s canteen with US Marines to acquire equipment for RF units, and also donated food and supplies to an orphanage.

In December 1966, Badcoe became the sector operations adviser at the provincial headquarters in Huế. This role generally involved planning, liaison and staff work, but Badcoe interpreted his duty statement flexibly and led local forces into combat whenever he got the chance. According to a fellow AATTV officer, Captain Barry Rissel, he was a &quot;veritable tiger&quot; in combat, a characteristic that led his US allies to dub him &quot;The Galloping Major&quot;. At his first meeting with Badcoe, Corporal Chris Black described the scene:
On 23 February 1967, Badcoe and his United States Marine Corps deputy, Captain James Custar, were advising an RF company operation in the Phu Thu District. About on their flank was a PF platoon accompanied by two United States Army advisers, Captain Clement and Sergeant Thomas. Badcoe and Custar began to hear intermittent rifle fire, coming from the direction of the flanking platoon. Custar was monitoring radio transmissions when he heard that Clement had been wounded and Thomas was in danger. Badcoe ran across the intervening fire-swept ground to reach the PF platoon, with the enemy fire intensifying as he approached. He discovered that Clement was lying ahead of the platoon, and had been mortally wounded while going to assist a wounded PF soldier. Thomas had tried to reach Clement and had in turn been wounded and was lying in the open between Clement and the platoon, which had pulled back. Badcoe observed that the enemy were dug in along a small rise, and appeared to be in about company-strength and readying for an attack. He gathered the PF platoon and led a frontal assault on the enemy position, firing as he went. Dodging automatic fire, he charged a machine-gun position and shot the crew with his rifle. Led by Badcoe, the PF platoon inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. Once the PF platoon had consolidated its position, Badcoe went back, still under fire, to lift Clement and carry him out of the danger area. He then returned and assisted Thomas to a position from which he could be safely evacuated. The operation concluded successfully.

Two weeks later, the sector RF reaction company was tasked to the Quảng Điền District sub-sector on 7 March in response to an attack on its district headquarters by a VC force of about two battalions. Quảng Điền District headquarters was in the eponymous village, about northwest of Huế. Badcoe was travelling in a vehicle convoy with his deputy and another US officer, when their vehicle veered off the road into a ditch. His deputy was killed and Badcoe left the vehicle and joined the company commander as they drove towards the village. By the time Badcoe and the company arrived, the village was occupied by the VC, and they were attacking the district headquarters from three sides. Badcoe quickly formed the company up into platoons, then led them through enemy fire to a position which flanked the VC. Forming them into an extended line, he then led them in an assault across open ground against the main VC force. In the face of this attack, the VC withdrew in disarray and the garrison of the district headquarters was saved. Badcoe&#x27;s intervention prevented serious losses and the capture of the district headquarters.

Badcoe became disillusioned with the war during his service in South Vietnam. He was particularly affected by an incident in February 1967 in which the ARVN regiment he was working with called in a napalm strike on a VC-occupied village, whose population was strongly supportive of the government, instead of attempting to attack and dislodge the VC. Badcoe and other advisers attempted to stop the use of napalm, but the ARVN divisional headquarters overruled them. A total of 40 civilians were killed or wounded, and Badcoe spent the next day-and-a-half arranging the removal of bodies and new accommodation for the survivors. He eventually concluded that the conflict was an &quot;unwinnable war&quot;. On 7 April, Badcoe, who wrote frankly to his wife and children, penned a letter to them expressing his &quot;unease and cynicism&quot; about the conduct of the war and indicating that he wished to come home. At this time Badcoe was planning to take a short break on the Japanese island of Okinawa starting the following day, with an Australian Army friend who had been visiting him, observing operations.

When he returned from the field early in the morning of 7 April, Badcoe was told that he was required to act as sector headquarters duty officer due to the illness of another adviser. He saw his friend off to Da Nang and returned to Huế where he commenced duty, planning to join his friend once he had completed his shift. He soon became aware that an operation was going badly for an ARVN force at the hamlet of An Thuan in Hương Trà District, about north of Huế. The operation involved the elite &quot;Hac Bao&quot; (Black Panther) divisional reaction company of the 1st ARVN Division, along with a squadron of armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and two RF companies. They were attempting to eliminate a VC force of about two companies which was holding well-entrenched positions at An Thuan. The ARVN force had been met with intense fire and had suffered heavy casualties. Badcoe realised that the force did not have any advisers, because one of the &quot;Hac Bao&quot; advisers was ill, and advisers were required to work in pairs. Without any advisers, the ARVN were unable to access close air support to dislodge the VC.

Badcoe decided that he needed to go out to the ARVN force and assist them. He arranged for relief as the sector duty officer, grabbed his weapons and equipment, and collected Sergeant Alberto Alvarado, his US Army deputy adviser and radio operator. They sped in their jeep towards An Thuan. Upon arrival, they found the ARVN force preparing for another assault, which was to consist of the APCs followed by the &quot;Hac Bao&quot; company. Badcoe and his deputy climbed aboard an APC and joined the attack. About from An Thuan, the force was moving through the hamlet&#x27;s cemetery and hostile fire increased markedly, from recoilless rifles, mortars, machine guns and small arms. The APCs drove through the cemetery and deployed to suppress the enemy fire. The &quot;Hac Bao&quot; company pressed forward through the cemetery, at which time Badcoe and Alvarado dismounted and joined them. During the last stages of the attack, the two advisers were leading the infantry when the enemy fire became so heavy that both the APCs and infantry began falling back through the cemetery.

Badcoe began rallying the ARVN soldiers to renew the assault, and artillery was called in on the enemy positions. After this, Badcoe and Alvarado again pushed forward, attempting to encourage the ARVN troops to press home the attack. The final stages of the line of assault crossed dry, open rice paddy fields with no cover. Enemy fire converged on Badcoe, Alvarado and the ARVN troops, who again went to ground. On this occasion, Badcoe refused to fall back. He headed straight for an enemy machine-gun position that was causing devastation among the ARVN force. Forced to ground by the intense fire, Badcoe was soon joined by Alvarado. Badcoe lifted himself up to throw a hand grenade, but was pulled down by Alvarado as bullets cracked overhead. When he rose to throw again, he was cut down by machine-gun fire and killed instantly. Alvarado attempted to recover his body, but was shot in the leg. He then used his radio to call in close air support and more artillery to suppress the enemy fire. The &quot;Hac Bao&quot; company, supported by the APCs, then moved forward and captured the objective.

A military funeral for Badcoe was held in Huế, the largest for any Allied soldier until that date. Badcoe was buried in the Terendak Garrison Cemetery in Malacca, Malaysia. The epitaph on his gravestone reads: &quot;He lived and died a soldier&quot;. According to McNeill, Badcoe was highly respected by both South Vietnamese and US allies, and was an inspirational leader who had saved the lives of his comrades and turned defeat into victory on many occasions.

== Post-script ==
For his courage and leadership on 23 February, 7 March, and 7 April 1967, Badcoe was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in battle that could be awarded at that time to a member of the Australian armed forces. The full citation for the award appeared in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 17 October 1967. It read, in part:

Denise Badcoe received her husband&#x27;s Victoria Cross from the Governor-General, Lord Casey, at Government House, Canberra, on 5 April 1968. Badcoe was awarded the United States Silver Star with bronze oak leaf cluster, Air Medal and Purple Heart, and was made a Knight of the National Order of Vietnam. South Vietnam also awarded him the Cross of Gallantry with Palm, Gold Star, and Silver Star, the Armed Forces Honor Medal, First Class, Vietnam Campaign Medal and Wound Medal, and he posthumously received the Vietnam Medal and Australian Defence Medal from Australia. &quot;The Official History of Australia&#x27;s Involvement in Southeast Asian Conflicts 1948–1975&quot; judged that Badcoe was &quot;a dedicated career soldier&quot; who &quot;quickly acquired an understanding of the Vietnamese people and their customs along with an affectionate respect for the Vietnamese territorials he trained and led&quot;.

Members of the AATTV received many decorations, and the unit gained the distinction of being &quot;probably the mostly highly decorated unit for its size in the Australian Army&quot;. Only four Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross in Vietnam; all went to members of the AATTV, two of them posthumously.

The soldiers&#x27; club at the 1st Australian Support Compound in Vung Tau was named the Peter Badcoe Club in his honour in November 1967. At Portsea, the assembly room and library was named after him, complete with a portrait and bronze plaque. After Portsea closed in 1985, the main lecture theatre in the Military Instruction Block at Royal Military College, Duntroon in Canberra was named after him. In 1998–1999, a rest area in Badcoe&#x27;s honour was established near Lake George on the Remembrance Driveway between Canberra and Sydney. In 1999, the Ex-Military Rehabilitation Centre moved to the &quot;Peter Badcoe VC Complex&quot; at Edinburgh, South Australia.

Badcoe&#x27;s medal group and personal memoirs were offered for sale by auction in Sydney on 20 May 2008 and were sold for A$488,000 to the media magnate and philanthropist Kerry Stokes in collaboration with the Government of South Australia. Badcoe&#x27;s Victoria Cross and associated medals were displayed at the South Australian Museum in Adelaide, prior to being toured to 17 regional towns in South Australia between 21 March and 20 June 2009, before being displayed permanently at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra from 2016. His VC was the 71st of the 100 VCs awarded to Australians to be placed on public display there. Since 2004, the award for the player displaying the most courage, skill, self-sacrifice and teamwork in the Australian Football League match in Adelaide on Anzac Day each year has been called the Peter Badcoe VC Medal. The medal has been won by three times by Travis Boak of the Port Adelaide Football Club, and twice by Joel Selwood of the Geelong Football Club.

In 2015, the Australian government repatriated the remains of 22 Australian soldiers buried at Terendak, but the Badcoe family asked that he remain buried there, in accordance with his express wishes. In 2016, the South Australian electoral district of Ashford was renamed Badcoe in his honour. In 2020, a 60-bed residential aged care facility named Peter Badcoe VC House was completed in Newcastle, New South Wales, by the Returned and Services League of Australia (New South Wales Branch) aged care arm, RSL LifeCare.

<text>Michael Palmer (born May 11, 1943) is an American poet and translator. He attended Harvard University, where he earned a BA in French and an MA in Comparative Literature. He has worked extensively with Contemporary dance since the 1970s and has collaborated with many composers and visual artists. Palmer has lived in San Francisco since 1969.

Palmer is the 2006 recipient of the Wallace Stevens Award from the Academy of American Poets. This award recognizes outstanding and proven mastery in the art of poetry.

==Beginnings==
Michael Palmer began actively pursuing a career in poetry during the 1960s. Two events in the early sixties seem decisive to his development as a poet.

First, Palmer attended the Vancouver Poetry Conference in 1963. This July–August 1963 Poetry Conference in Vancouver, British Columbia spanned three weeks and involved about sixty people who had registered for a program of discussions, workshops, lectures, and readings designed by Warren Tallman and Robert Creeley as a summer course at the University of B.C. There Palmer met writers and artists who would leave a mark on his own developing sense of a poetics, especially Robert Duncan, Robert Creeley, and Clark Coolidge, with whom he formed lifelong friendships. It was a landmark moment as Robert Creeley observed:

“The Vancouver Poetry Conference brought together for the first time, a decisive company of then disregarded poets such as Denise Levertov, Charles Olson, Allen Ginsberg, Robert Duncan, Margaret Avison, Philip Whalen... together with as yet unrecognised younger poets of that time, Michael Palmer, Clark Coolidge and many more.”
The second decisive event in Palmer’s early career as a poet began with the editing of the journal &quot;Joglars&quot; alongside fellow poet Clark Coolidge. &quot;Joglars&quot; (Providence, Rhode Island) numbered just three issues in all, published between 1964 and 1966, but it extended Palmer’s correspondence with fellow poets begun in Vancouver. The first issue appeared in Spring 1964 and included poems by Gary Snyder, Michael McClure, Fielding Dawson, Jonathan Williams, Lorine Niedecker, Robert Kelly, and Louis Zukofsky. Palmer published five of his own poems in the second number of &quot;Joglars&quot;, an issue that included work by Larry Eigner, Stan Brakhage, Russell Edson, and Jackson Mac Low.

For those who attended the Vancouver Conference or learned about it later on, it was apparent that second-generation modernist poet Charles Olson was exerting a significant influence on the emerging generation of artists and poets (the so-called third-generation modernists) who came to prominence in the 1950s and 1960s, and included the New American poets. The latter poets, such as Robert Creeley, Robert Duncan, and Denise Levertov would have an impact on the new generation of artists emerging in the 1970s, which included Palmer. Says Palmer:

==Work and recognition==
Palmer is the author of fourteen full-length books of poetry, beginning in 1972 with &quot;Blake&#x27;s Newton&quot; and most recently in 2021 with &quot;Little Elegies for Sister Satan&quot;. Other notable collections include &quot;Company of Moths&quot; (2005) (shortlisted for the 2006 Canadian Griffin Poetry Prize), &quot;The Promises of Glass&quot; (2000), &quot;At Passages&quot; (1996), &quot;Sun&quot; (1988), and &quot;Notes for Echo Lake&quot; (1981). 

A prose work, &quot;The Danish Notebook,&quot; was published in 1999. In the spring of 2007, a chapbook, &quot;The Counter-Sky&quot; (with translations by Koichiro Yamauchi), was published by Meltemia Press of Japan, to coincide with the Tokyo Poetry and Dance Festival. Palmer’s work has appeared in literary magazines such as &quot;Boundary 2, Berkeley Poetry Review, Sulfur, Conjunctions, Grand Street&quot; and &quot;O-blek&quot;.

Besides the 2006 Wallace Stevens Award, Michael Palmer&#x27;s honors include two grants from the Literature Program of the National Endowment for the Arts. In 1989-90 he was a Guggenheim Fellow. During the years 1992–1994 he held a Lila Wallace-Reader&#x27;s Digest Fund Writer&#x27;s Award. From 1999 to 2004, he served as a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets. In the spring of 2001 he received the Shelly Memorial Prize Prize from the Poetry Society of America.

Since he seems to explore the nature of language and its relation to human consciousness and perception, Palmer is often associated with the Language poets. Of this particular association, Palmer comments in an interview:
==Themes and writing style==
Introducing Palmer for a reading in 1996, Brighde Mullins noted that his poetics is both “situated yet active.” Likewise, Palmer himself speaks of the poem on the page as signaling a &quot;site of passages&quot;: 

Elsewhere, Palmer observes that &quot;in our reading we have to rediscover the radical nature of the poem&quot; and search for &quot;the essential place of lyric poetry&quot; as we delve &quot;beneath it to its relationship with language&quot;. Here Palmer confronts not only the problem of subjectivity and public address, but the specific agency of poetry and its relationship with the political: 
If poetry and literature is, as Ezra Pound observed, &quot;news that stays news,&quot; in his own work Palmer also wants to account for a subterranean or “counter-tradition”. He invokes the latter as a way to “think against” the prevailing doxa, and to have access to an &#x27;alternative tradition&#x27; that slips under the radar of the Academy but exerts an underground influence. 

Palmer has repeatedly stated, in interviews and talks over the years, that the situation for the poet and/or the poem is parodoxical: a seeing which is blind, a &quot;nothing you can see&quot;, an &quot;active waiting&quot;, &quot;purposive, &quot;sometimes&quot; a music&quot;, or a &quot;nowhere&quot; that is &quot;now / here&quot;.
For Palmer, poetry can &quot;interrogate the radical and violent instability of our moment, asking where is the location of culture,
where the site of self, selves, among others&quot; (as Palmer has characterized the poetry of Myung Mi Kim).

==Critical reception==
Michael Palmer&#x27;s poetry has been described variously as abstract, intimate, elegant, hermetic, allusive, personal, political, speculative, and inaccessible.

While some reviewers or readers may value Palmer&#x27;s work as an &quot;extension of modernism&quot;, some criticize Palmer&#x27;s work as discordant: an &quot;interruption of our composure&quot; (to invoke Robert Duncan&#x27;s phrase). 

As for the modernist project, its legacy is something Palmer both resists and embraces. Palmer is candid about the towering figures of early modernism, the great inventors of the period, those who MAKE IT NEW (i.e., Yeats, Eliot and Pound). But Palmer clearly states that there remains “something quite harrowing inscribed at the heart of modernism.”

Palmer’s concern is “to maintain or at least continue the search for an ethics of the I/Thou.&quot; The poet must suffer &#x27;loss&#x27;, embrace disturbance and paradox, agonizing over what cannot be accounted for. Palmer will admit into his work that &quot;essential errancy of discovery in the poem&quot; that would not be a “unified narrative explanation of the self,” but would allow for “cloaked meaning and necessary semantic indirection.”

==Collaborations==
Perhaps similar to Olson&#x27;s and Duncan’s impact on their generation, Palmer&#x27;s influence remains singular and palpable, if difficult to measure. For many decades now, Palmer has worked collaboratively in the fields of dance, translation, teaching, and the visual arts.

Palmer has published translations from French, Russian, and Brazilian Portuguese. He edited and helped translate &quot;Nothing The Sun Could Not Explain: Twenty Contemporary Brazilian Poets&quot;. With Michael Molnar and John High, Palmer helped edit and translate a volume of poetry by the Russian poet Alexei Parshchikov, &quot;Blue Vitriol&quot; (Avec Books, 1994). And he translated &quot;Theory of Tables&quot; (1994), a book written by Emmanuel Hocquard, a project that grew out of Hocquard&#x27;s translations of Palmer&#x27;s &quot;Baudelaire Series&quot; into French. Palmer has written many radio plays and works of criticism.

He has participated in multiple collaborations with a wide range of painters. These include the German painter Gerhard Richter, Italian painter Sandro Chia and French painter Micaëla Henich. 
===Dance===
Since the 1970s, Palmer has collaborated on over a dozen dance works with Margaret Jenkins and her Dance Company. Early dance scenarios in which Palmer participated include &quot;Interferences&quot;, 1975; &quot;Equal Time&quot;, 1976; &quot;No One but Whitington&quot;, 1978; &quot;Red, Yellow, Blue&quot;, 1980, &quot;Straight Words&quot;, 1980; &quot;Versions by Turns&quot;, 1980; &quot;Cortland Set&quot;, 1982; and &quot;First Figure&quot;, 1984. A noteworthy example of a Jenkins/Palmer collaboration might be &quot;The Gates (Far Away Near)&quot;, an evening-length dance work in which Palmer worked with not only Ms. Jenkins, but also Paul Dresher and Rinde Eckert. This was performed in September 1993 in the San Francisco Bay Area and in July 1994 at New York&#x27;s Lincoln Center. 

Another recent collaboration with Jenkins resulted in &quot;Danger Orange&quot;, a 45-minute outdoor site-specific performance, presented in October 2004 before the presidential elections. The color orange metaphorically references the national alert systems that are in place that evoke the sense of danger.[see also:Homeland Security Advisory System]

===Painters and visual artists===
Similar to his friendship with Robert Duncan and the painter Jess Collins, Palmer&#x27;s work with painter Irving Petlin is important. 

Palmer has also worked with painter and visual artist Augusta Talbot, and curated her exhibition at the CUE Art Foundation (March 17 -April 23, 2005) Talbot, in turn, provided the cover art for Palmer’s collection &quot;The Company of Moths&quot; (2005) and for &quot;Thread&quot; (2006). When asked how collaboration has pushed or shaped the boundaries of his work, Palmer responded:

These are not one-off collaborations for Palmer: they are on-going. It may be that friendship via collaboration becomes part of what Jack Spicer terms a &quot;composition of the real.” And that might articulate a place for, and even spaces where, both the &quot;poetic imaginary&quot; is constituted and a possible social space is envisioned.

<text>Agesiles or Arseiles (Greek: ΑΡϹΕΙΛΗϹ &quot;Arseilēs&quot;), who reigned around 20BC-1BC, is, with Sapadbizes, one of the first identified kings of the northern Indo-European Yuezhi tribes, that had invaded the Greco-Bactrian kingdom in the region of Bactria (modern-day northern Afghanistan) from around 125 BC. This king is known only from his coins, which are very rare. His name could be derived from the Tocharian word Arsal, &quot;snake&quot; or &quot;viper&quot;.

<text>Decimus Junius Silanus Torquatus (c. 16 AD64 AD) was a Roman senator who lived during the 1st century.

==Life==
He served as an ordinary consul in 53 with Quintus Haterius Antoninus as his colleague. Decimus was the second son born to Aemilia Lepida and Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus, a member of the Junii Silani, a family of Ancient Rome.

Through his maternal grandparents, the princess Julia the Younger and Lucius Aemilius Paullus, consul AD 1, Decimus was related to Emperor Augustus, his second wife, Scribonia, the statesman Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and the consul Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus (brother of the triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus). 

Decimus married Julia Africana in 54 AD. Julia was the daughter of the consul Marcus Julius Africanus. They had one daughter named Junia Silana Torquata (b. 55).

Decimus allegedly boasted of his descent from Augustus, and as a result, Emperor Nero forced him to commit suicide.

<text>The Organization of Solidarity of the Peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America (), abbreviated as OSPAAAL, was a Cuban political movement with the stated purpose of fighting globalisation, imperialism, neoliberalism, and defending human rights. The OSPAAAL was founded in Havana in January 1966, after the Tricontinental Conference, a meeting of over 500 delegates and 200 observers from over 82 countries.

Acting as the &quot;key bridge&quot; to unite liberation struggles and movements in the three continents, OSPAAAL&#x27;s main objective is the promotion of anti-imperialism. The Organization of American States (OAS) called OSPAAAL &quot;the most dangerous threat that international communism has yet made against the inter-American system&quot;.

OSPAAAL&#x27;s motto was &quot;This great humanity has said: enough! And has started to move forward&quot;.

Until 2019, it published the magazine &quot;Tricontinental&quot; as their main transnational communication tool. After the closing of OSPAAAL by the Cuban Government, the Tricontinental Institute for Social Research seeks to continue the heritage of the Tricontinental conference and the organization. They &quot;stand, in the words of Franz Fanon, with the wretched of the earth to create a world of human beings.&quot;

== History and context ==
The OSPAAAL was born out of the Tricontinental Conference in Havana, which Mehdi Ben Barka was preparing before his October 1965 assassination. OSPAA gathered for the first time in Cairo, Egypt in 1957. 500 delegates from 35 countries represented their national liberation movements and parties rather than states. It was led by Ismaël Touré, the brother of Ahmed Sékou Touré, president of Guinea. Ismaël Touré presided the board responsible of the solidarity funds, assisted by two vice-chairmen: Mehdi Ben Barka of Morocco and Chu Tzu-chi of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. At that time, AAPSO (Afro-Asian People&#x27;s Solidarity Organisation) was debating the inclusion of Cuba and the rest of the Caribbean and Latin America to the group, a question posed again in Cairo in June 1961 by the new commission, the Commission on Neocolonialism, which was presided by Ben Barka.

While the Casablanca Group, founded in 1961, gathered &quot;progressive states&quot; (Egypt, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Libya, and Morocco), the OSPAAL was an organization of movements, which aimed at creating national economic development plans for the newly independent states and to break national isolation through internationalism. In exile, Ben Barka resided there six months in 1964. Amílcar Cabral, Malcolm X, and Che Guevara lived in the city around that time. Henri Curiel was there organizing &quot;solidarity networks,&quot; which trained African National Congress activists. (The ANC had been prohibited in 1960, and Curiel would be murdered in 1978). Ben Barka was going to create an anti-colonialist magazine titled &quot;The African Review&quot;, but he decided to enlarge the union to Latin America.

After the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion in 1961, Fidel Castro moved even closer to the Soviet Union. In February 1962, Cuba was expelled from the Organization of American States (OAS). On October 3, 1965, Ben Barka declared in a press conference prior to the Havana conference that the &quot;two currents of the world revolution would be represented there: the current born with the October Revolution and the national liberation revolutions&#x27; currents.&quot;

The fourth congress of the OSPAA, in Accra from May 6 to May 9, 1965, finally agreed on including Latin America and to take in account the founding January 1966 conference in Havana. In July, Medhi Ben Barka, who was presiding the preparatory council, assured the support of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Soviet Union, and defined the objectives of the new organization, summed up as &quot;total liberation:&quot; aid to national liberation movements (in particular to the Palestinian movement), intensification of violent and peaceful struggles on all three continents, support to the Cuban Revolution, suppression of foreign military bases, support of the nuclear disarmament option, and opposition to apartheid and racial segregation. In September, Ben Barka went to Havana to prepare the opening up of the conference on January 3, 1966. However, on October 29, 1965, he was disappeared in Paris, allegedly abducted by Moroccan secret agents. The Havana Conference thus took place without him, and the OSPAAAL was officially founded.

== Activities ==
OSPAAAL cultivated relationships with international trade unions and solidarity groups around the world. OSPAAAL had a working relationship with the Movement for Colonial Freedom (MCF) a London-based transnational solidarity group. Their communication with Barbara Haq, General Secretary of MCF, included sending posters and published materials in exchange for annual reports and publications from MCF.

As part of the campaign efforts of OSPAAAL the Executive Secretariat released official declarations about international anti-colonial struggles. Their strong opposition to US President Nixon’s military actions during the Vietnam War, such as the total blockade of the ports of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Operation Pocket Money, lead to them to denounce him as ‘the unscrupulous assassin of millions of Vietnamese; he is as dangerous as the fascist Hitler of World War II’. Following on from the critique of US military action in Vietnam OSPAAAL also called for greater solidarity between countries around the world following victories against US forces in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.

Beyond solidarity with anti-colonial struggles on a nation-state level, OSPAAAL campaigned for individuals involved in independence and anti-imperialist activities. OSPAAAL on behalf of a member organization, the Puerto Rican Socialist Party, called for support for Puerto Rican independence fighter Humberto Pagán. Following his arrest in Canada, OSPAAAL called for ‘all revolutionary and progressive countries, parties and organisations to declare solidarity with Humberto Pagán militantly in every way possible’. Their aim was to highlight the perceived injustice of the court proceedings and to prevent the extradition of Pagán in fear for his safety were he to return to Puerto Rico. After refusing to grant an extradition order, and upon appeal to the Canadian Supreme Court, Humberto Pagán was cleared of all charges and the extradition request was denied.

== Posters ==
From its foundation until the mid-1980s, OSPAAAL produced brightly coloured propaganda posters promoting their cause. Financial difficulty and ink shortages due to the US embargo against Cuba pushed the artists and printers to find ingenious solutions with unorthodox outcomes, although it ultimately forced the organization to stop producing these posters. However, these posters began to be printed again in 2000.

These posters, as they intended to be internationalist, usually had their message written in Spanish, English, French, and Arabic. As opposed to being put up on walls around Cuba, these posters were instead folded up and stapled into copies of &quot;Tricontinental&quot;, so that they could be distributed internationally. This allowed OSPAAAL to send its message to its subscribers around the world.

All OSPAAAL-Posters from the beginning until 2003 are documented and indexed in the book &quot;The Tricontinental Solidarity Poster&quot;. One American, Jane Norling, is among the artists who designed posters for OSPAAAL, and is one of eight women who contributed designs for 22 of the approximately 326 OSPAAAL posters.

<text>Sergeant Joseph Harcourt Tombs VC (23 March 1887 − 28 June 1966), born Frederick Griffith Tombs, who under the name Joseph Tombs, was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award of the British (Imperial) honours system. The VC is awarded for ‘most conspicuous bravery … in the presence of the enemy’.

==VC action==
Tombs was born in Birmingham and was a 28-year-old Lance-Corporal in the 1st Battalion, The King&#x27;s (Liverpool Regiment), British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.
On 16 May 1915 near Rue du Bois, France, Lance-Corporal Tombs, on his own initiative, crawled out repeatedly under very heavy shell and machine-gun fire to bring in wounded men who were lying about 100 yards in front of our trenches. He rescued four men, one of whom he dragged back by means of a rifle sling placed round his own neck and the man&#x27;s body.

==Later life==
He was promoted Corporal in the field (24 May 1915) and after the war, emigrated to Canada where he spent the rest of his life. On 25 May 1920, Tombs enlisted in the Canadian Army in Montréal, and served as a Private in The Royal Canadian Regiment. His attestation papers are held in The Royal Canadian Regiment Museum, Wolseley Barracks, London, Ontario). During the Second World War Tombs enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force and served at the Flying School in Trenton, Ontario, Canada. A 1952 operation to remove some of the shrapnel still embedded in his stomach was not completely successful, and in 1964 he suffered a stroke.
His Victoria Cross is held by the Royal Regiment of Canada Foundation, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

<text>Pantologia is an English encyclopedia, published in 12 volumes, 8vo in 1813, with 370 plates (some coloured). Its full title page was &quot;A New Cyclopedia, comprehending a complete series of Essays, Treatises and Systems, alphabetically arranged, with a general dictionary of Arts, Sciences and Words: the whole representing a distinct Survey of Human Genius, Learning and Industry, illustrated with elegant engravings; those on Natural History being from original drawings by Edwards and others, and beautifully coloured after nature ...&quot;


==History and editorship==
The editors were John Mason Good, Olinthus Gregory, and Newton Bosworth, as well as other anonymous writers. Work had begun in 1802, by Gregory and Bosworth and an anonymous writer, who gave up after about a year. They were later joined by Good. The preface lists the subjects for which each editor was responsible. The appearance of rival works held up publication for some years. The work was published serially, and the dates on the plates indicate the first sections were published in 1808.

191 of the plates related to natural history, and the balance to miscellaneous subjects. A number of the latter, dealing with manufacture and inventions, were drawn by John Farey, Jr., and engraved by Wilson Lowry. The natural history drawings were mainly by Sydenham Edwards. A feature of the plates relating to engineering and manufacture was the use by Farey of the drawings of John Smeaton as the basis for his work.

==Seven advantages over rivals==
The editors claimed in the preface [ix] that the work had seven advantages over its rivals:
*It explained English words as well as those of the arts and sciences, so avoiding the need to have a separate dictionary.
*It appended English names to the Linneian ones in the natural history section, so helping non-scientific readers.
*It had a more up to date arrangement of mineralogy, reflecting modern concepts of the field.
*References were given at the ends of the more important articles.
*The natural history plates were coloured.
*To permit the greatest amount of text to be included, longer articles were in small print.
*It included accounts of sports, games, recreations and pastimes, including the rules by which they were conducted.

<text>The AD Navyplane was designed by the British Admiralty&#x27;s Air Department as a reconnaissance aircraft for use during World War I. Performance of the prototype was so disappointing that plans to produce it were cancelled almost immediately.

The Navyplane was designed by the Admiralty&#x27;s Harold Bolas with the assistance of R.J. Mitchell of Supermarine. It was a pusher floatplane biplane with the pilot and observer being seated ahead of the wings in a streamlined lightweight nacelle mounted in the gap between the upper and lower sets of wings. A Smith Static radial engine and a pusher propeller were installed behind them.

Two examples were ordered in 1916 for the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). Serial numbers were allocated for seven Navyplanes (9095-&#x27;96, N.1070-&#x27;74) but just one prototype (9095) was completed. Tests of this Supermarine-built prototype commenced in August 1916 (flown by Lieutenant-Commander John Seddon) but proved seriously underpowered and unsatisfactory. The engine was replaced with an AR.1 rotary engine (which was later redesignated the BR.1 for Bentley Rotary 1) and retested in May 1917. However, even without a military load and observer, the Navyplane&#x27;s performance still proved to be poor, and the design was abandoned on 27 August 1917, with no second prototype being produced.

Supermarine attempted to design an improved version to replace the Short 184, the design, the Supermarine Patrol Seaplane, being powered by a 200 hp (149 kW) Sunbeam engine. While contracts for six aircraft were placed, work was abandoned before a prototype was built, the Short 184 proving adequate in the patrol role.

<text>The AD Scout (also known as the Sparrow) was designed by Harris Booth of the British Admiralty&#x27;s Air Department as a fighter aircraft to defend Britain from Zeppelin bombers during World War I.

==Design and development==
The Scout was a very unconventional aircraft – a biplane with a fuselage pod mounted on the &quot;upper&quot; wing. A twin-rudder tail was attached by four booms, and it was provided with an extremely narrow-track undercarriage. The primary armament was intended to be a 2-pounder recoilless Davis Gun, but this was never fitted. Four prototypes were ordered in 1915, and two each were built by Hewlett &amp; Blondeau and the Blackburn Aeroplane &amp; Motor Company.

==Operational history==
Trials flown by pilots of the Royal Naval Air Service at Chingford proved the aircraft to be seriously overweight, fragile, sluggish, and difficult to handle, even on the ground. The project was abandoned, and all four prototypes were scrapped.

<text>The AD Seaplane Type 1000 also known as the Admiralty Type 1000 and the AD.1 (from Air Department) was a British seaplane of the First World War designed to attack German warships. When it first flew, it was the largest British aircraft yet to take to the air.

==Development==
The design of the AD.1 was by Harris Booth of the Admiralty&#x27;s Air Department just prior to World War I. It was the world&#x27;s first aircraft designed from scratch as a torpedo bomber, one of the three planned versions of the design. The other two were a bomber and an aircraft armed with a recoilless Davis 12-pounder gun (approximately 76 mm calibre).

The aircraft was a float-equipped biplane of pod-and-boom design, with engines mounted at the front of both booms, as well as at the rear of the crew pod. Development began in 1915; it was completed and flown for the first time during the summer of 1916. It was found that the Davis gun would project a blast rearwards so the weapon was changed for a conventional 12-pounder &#x27;Naval Landing Gun&#x27; though in practice a gun was never installed in the AD.1.

==Service==
Seven aircraft were ordered from J. Samuel White, but when the first one delivered was tested, it was found that its weight was higher than expected, its performance was unexpectedly poor and its undercarriage was not robust enough: based on these findings, the contract for the remaining six aircraft was cancelled. The sole example is known to have survived until 1916, probably at the Royal Naval Air Service&#x27;s Seaplane Experimental Station, Felixstowe base.

<text>Olinthus Gilbert Gregory (29 January 17742 February 1841) was an English mathematician, author, and editor.

==Biography==
He was born on 29 January 1774 at Yaxley in Huntingdonshire, the son of Robert, a shoemaker, and Ann, who also had three younger daughters: Harriet Euphrasia, Sophia (who died in 1783) and Marianna.

Having been educated by Richard Weston, a Leicester botanist, Olinthus published a treatise, &quot;Lessons, Astronomical and Philosophical&quot; in 1793. After moving to Cambridge in 1796, Gregory first acted as sub-editor on the &quot;Cambridge Intelligencer&quot;, and then opened a booksellers shop.

In 1802 he obtained an appointment as mathematical master at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich through the influence of Charles Hutton, to whose notice he had been brought by a manuscript on the Use of the Sliding Rule; and when Hutton resigned in 1807 Gregory succeeded him in the professorship.

Gregory combined his love of mathematics with an interest in music, but not in the melodious sense: music should be subject to rational principles. He proposed &quot;the substitution of proper characters to denote the different kinds of musical time, instead of those vague indefinite ones, which are now in use.&quot; No more 3/2 time, or &quot;Adagio&quot; and &quot;Allegro&quot;; rather, some absolute rate, based on the swing of a precisely-calibrated pendulum. Each composition should be played at its pre-defined speed, no matter who was conducting. In discussing Gregory&#x27;s ideas, Werrett draws attention to the environment at Woolwich in which he developed them, and the use of the metronome to maintain a consistent rhythm in military music.

Gregory favoured the establishment of a secular university in London. By the end of 1825 he was on a ten-man committee interviewing and selecting the teaching staff. His name was inscribed on the foundation stone of the new university, laid in Gower Street on 30 April 1827.

Failing health obliged him to retire in 1838, and he died at his home at Queen&#x27;s Terrace, Woolwich on 2 February 1841. Gregory&#x27;s library was sold on 17 &amp; 18 March 1842 by Southgate &amp; Son of 22 Fleet Street.

The esteem in which Dr Gregory was held can be judged from the following letter in 1841:

:&quot;To the Editor of the Morning Chronicle.&quot;
:Sir - I see by your paper of the 11th inst., that Doctor Olinthus Gregory, late Professor Mathematics, &amp;c. &amp;c.,
:Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, has left his widow and family in any thing but affluent circumstances.
:Now, I do trust, that out of the number of people who have experienced his exertions, as a Professor at
:the Royal Military Academy, and also have benefitted by him as highly scientific individual, there may be
:found some who will subscribe to the benefit of the widow and family of that excellent man.
:I remain, sir,
:C. D., M.P.,
:One of Dr. O. G.&#x27;s pupils at the R.M.Ac., Woolwich
:Edinburgh, Feb. 13.

In 1802 Gregory was appointed editor of the &quot;Gentlemen&#x27;s Diary&quot;, and from 1819 to 1840 editor of the &quot;Lady&#x27;s Diary&quot;. From 1817, &quot;he had the whole of the general superintendence of the almanacks published by the Stationers’ Company.&quot;

===Family===
Gregory married, first, Rebecca Marshall on 4 March 1798 in Yaxley, with whom he had a son James and a daughter Eliza; Rebecca died in June 1807. His second marriage was to Anne Beddome on 20 December 1809 at St Mary, Newington, with whom he had two sons and a daughter. Their elder son, Boswell Robert was accidentally drowned in the Thames at Woolwich in the summer of 1834, aged 21. Letitia Elizabeth Landon includes a poetical illustration, to a portrait by Richard Evans, commiserating with this event in Fisher&#x27;s &quot;Drawing Room Scrap Book&quot;, 1835. Their second son, Charles Hutton Gregory, who later became president of the Institution of Civil Engineers, was named after Charles Hutton, Gregory&#x27;s patron.

Anne died in Paddington in 1855, aged 65, and was buried at St Nicholas, Plumstead.

<text>Soyuz 31 (, &quot;Union 31&quot;) was a 1978 Soviet crewed space flight to the Salyut 6 space station. It was the seventh mission to and sixth successful docking at the orbiting facility. The Soyuz 31 crew were the second to visit the long-duration Soyuz 29 resident crew.

Soyuz 31 carried Valery Bykovsky and Sigmund Jähn, the first German cosmonaut, into space. They swapped Soyuz craft with the long-duration crew and returned to Earth in Soyuz 29, the resident crew returned to Earth in Soyuz 31.

==Mission parameters==

*Inclination: 51.64°
*Period: 88.81 minutes

==Mission highlights==

Soyuz 31, the third Intercosmos flight, was launched 26 August 1978. Cosmonauts Bykovsky and Jähn were greeted by resident crew Vladimir Kovalyonok and Aleksandr Ivanchenkov when they docked at the aft port of the Salyut 6 space station the next day. The visitors brought with them fresh onions, garlic, lemons, apples and other food for the long-duration crew, then in space for more than two months.

The presence of the East German cosmonaut was seen as significant because of the presence of the MKF-6M camera on the space station, built by the Carl Zeiss works at Jena. Medical and biological experiments were carried out, including an audio experiment which tested sound and noise perception limits. An experiment called Berolina used the Splav furnace to process an ampoule of bismuth and antimonide with the material between two plates in the ampoule. The tree structure which resulted was four to six times larger than what had been produced on the ground. Another experiment tested using different photographic films on the station&#x27;s interior.

The Soyuz 31 crew swapped craft with the Soyuz 29 crew so as to supply the long-duration crew with a fresh craft. On September 2, the engines of Soyuz 29 were tested, 25 experiment containers with 100 experimental results were transferred, along with exposed film, and seat liners and centering weights were exchanged. The Soyuz 31 crew left in Soyuz 29 the next day and landed 140 km southeast of Dzhezkazgan.

The standard recovery procedure was changed with this flight, observers noted. In the past, the recovery of a civilian Salyut crew had been made on the orbit following the one which provided a nominal launch opportunity to Salyut. With this and subsequent flights, the landing occurred during the orbit which provided the nominal launch opportunity. The effect of this change was to have a landing window open some two to three days earlier than otherwise.

The crew on the station subsequently boarded the Soyuz 31 vehicle and redocked it to the forward port, thus freeing the aft port for a forthcoming Progress supply ship. They returned to Earth 2 November in the craft after setting a new space-endurance record of 139 days.

<text>Amigo Supermarkets () is a chain of supermarkets located in Puerto Rico and owned by Pueblo.

==History==
In the 1920s, &quot;Supermercados Amigo&quot; was opened by Jose Marti Fuentes. During the company&#x27;s formative years, it operated small supermarkets across the island; these would be located at small strip malls. Many towns in Puerto Rico had multiple &quot;Supermercados Amigo&quot; locations.

===The transformation===
After the Grand Union and Coop Supermarkets companies ceased operations in Puerto Rico, &quot;Amigo&quot; began plans to become a major player in Puerto Rico&#x27;s supermarket industry. In 1989, they opened their first major store, located at Plaza del Carmen Mall, in Caguas. Subsequently, many other major stores were opened across Puerto Rico. A massive television campaign began, and their slogan, &quot;Amigo, lo mejor al mejor precio&quot; (&quot;Amigo, the best at the best prices&quot;) became a household phrase in Puerto Rico.

===Economic problems===
Amigo ran into serious economic problems in the 1990s, most of them having to do with employee salary. As a consequence, the company began losing money. There were several strikes, and these received wide media attention.

===Walmart acquisition===
In July 2002, American retail giant Walmart purchased Supermercados Amigo, in what became a controversial business move. Claims of unfair competition and monopoly were instantly made by smaller supermarkets, because Amigo would be backed by the strong assets of Walmart. As part of the agreement made in order for the purchase to take place, various supermarket locations had to be closed (specifically if there was a Walmart or Sam&#x27;s Club nearby). The closed Amigos became part of a new (at the time) supermarkets company known as &quot;SuperMax&quot; and &quot;Pitusa Markets&quot;.

The structure of the supermarkets themselves was not changed because of the purchase, the only exception being that now customers may pay for their purchases with their respective Sam&#x27;s Club or Walmart Credit Cards.

In January 2016, Walmart announced it would close four Amigo stores (plus all three Super Ahorros stores) located throughout the island, as part of a larger wave of store closures.

===2019 renovations===
On November 5, 2019, Amigo Supermarkets announced a renovation plan on its stores nationwide that would cost $7.8 million US dollars.

===Supermercados Pueblo acquisition===
In July 2022, Walmart announced that it would sell the Amigo chain to Pueblo.

In June 2022, the closing of the last Amigo supermarket by Walmart was announced, this was located in Dorado and the sale of the remaining 11 Amigo Supermarkets to Pueblo Supermarkets was announced, the brand name would remain and the 1,100 employees would keep their jobs. On August 26, 2022, the Amigo supermarkets closed their doors at 6pm to begin the transition of Matrix companies from Walmart to Pueblo, the reopening of Amigo scheduled for September 1.

As of December 2023, when one Amigo supermarket at Las Catalinas Mall in Caguas was affected by a minor fire, Amigo supermarkets remained open.

<doc id="849157" wikidata="Q2133814" url="?curid=849157" title="St Nicholas-at-Wade">
<text>St Nicholas-at-Wade (or St Nicholas) is both a village and a civil parish in the Thanet District of Kent, England. The parish had a recorded population of 782 at the 2001 Census, increasing to 852 at the 2011 census. The village of Sarre is part of the civil parish.

The village is best known locally for the local custom of Hoodening, a type of mumming, as well as for its prolific potato production. The village continues to play host to several folk groups, including Offcumduns Border Morris Dancers.

==History==
The name derives from its location on the western border of the Isle of Thanet (originally separated from the Kent mainland). Before the channels of the River Wantsum and River Stour silted up, one would have been able to &#x27;&#x27; at this point, over a ford. In Roman times the channel was navigable and the site likely very busy with the Saxon Shore forts of Regulbium (Reculver) and Rutupiae (Richborough) both close by. Remains of Roman shipbuilding yards are said to have been found between St. Nicholas-at-Wade and the nearby village of Sarre

==Village==

The village can be entered from either the A299 (Thanet Way) or the A28 (Canterbury Road). These approaches to the village stand out with their colourful planters welcoming visitors. St John&#x27;s Green at the A28 entry point displays several items including a 1919 restored cultivator in its original makers colours.

There are two public houses, &#x27;The Bell&#x27; and &#x27;The Sun&#x27;. There is also a post office, an antiques shop and a farm marketing office. One of the main potato suppliers in the country used to have its headquarters near St Nicholas Court in the northwest of the village, but the site closed in late 2015. Hedgend Industrial Estate is on the northern outskirts. There is the local St Nicholas CE Primary School.

The village hall (dating from 1930) houses weekly events including various dance classes, keep fit, Art groups and senior citizens coffee mornings and is also used as a polling station. There is a static caravan park at Frost Farm and a camping site at Streete Farm.

A sports field in Bell Meadow plays host to football and cricket matches, the cricket pavilion was constructed in the 1980s with the aid of Thanet District Council.

==Churches==
The 13th-century parish church of St Nicholas, after which the village and parish are named, was a chapel of ease for St Mary&#x27;s Church at Reculver. The first rector is recorded as Adam de Brancestre in 1294. Built in flint, the church houses some fine 16th-century brasses, a carved oak pulpit dated 1615, and a coat of arms of King George III. The parish has twice been enlarged, firstly in medieval times, when it was separated from the parish of Reculver and joined with the little-known chapelry of All Saints, Shuart in 1310, and again in the mid-16th century, when it was joined with the parish of St Giles, Sarre. The church is currently part of the Wantsum Benefice.

St Nicholas Court has a fine example of a medieval underground chapel; however, little is known about the origins or past use of this building. The chapel is on private land but has been opened to visitors on some important local occasions.

<text>The Tamiami Trail () is the southernmost of U.S. Highway 41 (US 41) from State Road 60 (SR 60) in Tampa to US 1 in Miami. A portion of the road also has the hidden designation of State Road 90 (SR 90).

The north–south section (hidden SR 45) extends to Naples, whereupon it becomes an east–west road (hidden SR 90) crossing the Everglades (and forming part of the northern border of Everglades National Park). It becomes Southwest 8th Street in Miami-Dade County, famous as Calle Ocho in the Little Havana section of Miami (and site of the eponymous annual festival), before ending east of Miami Avenue as Southeast 8th Street at Brickell Avenue in Brickell, Downtown Miami.

==History==

===Construction and early designations===
The idea for a trans-peninsula highway that connected the west and east coasts of Florida originated in April 1915 at an informal meeting in Tallahassee between Francis W. Perry, then president of the Fort Myers Chamber of Commerce, and James F. Jaudon of Miami, after which they returned to their respective cities and began advocating for the construction of what was originally called the Miami to Marco Highway. At a subsequent meeting in Orlando, on June 10, 1915, of what became the Central Florida Highway Association, Perry introduced a resolution which was seconded by Tampa&#x27;s E. P. Dickie, for the construction of the &quot;Tamiami Trail&quot;, which was to run from Tampa through Riverview, Bradenton, Sarasota, Arcadia, Punta Gorda, Fort Myers, Estero, Bonita Springs, Naples, Marco, then east directly across the state to Miami. Perry traced the route of the proposed Tamiami Trail on a map and accorded the credit for coining the word &quot;Tamiami&quot; to Dickie, although D. C. Gillett, who was president of the Tampa Board of Trade, later claimed to have originally suggested the name.

On August 3, 1915, the Board of Commissioners of Dade County agreed to fund part of the survey for the road by providing their county engineer. Two days later a team surveyed the first , and the work on the Tamiami Trail had officially begun. The team consisted of Hobart Crabtree (county engineer), James F. Jaudon, L. T. Highleyman, Van Cleve Hallowes, Wallace Culbertson, Walter Ludlam, J. T. Albritton, A. W. Frederick and one helper.

At the time, Lee County was a much larger county (Collier and Hendry Counties were created out of Lee County in 1923). In 1919, for financial reasons, Lee County was unable to complete its portion of the Tamiami Trail. Jaudon had already purchased of land, mostly in Monroe County. His company, the Chevelier Corporation, came to the rescue and offered to build a link of the highway through its holdings in Monroe County if Dade and Lee counties would agree to re-route the Tamiami Trail through Monroe County. The proposal was accepted; the Chevelier Corporation began laying out a new route for the road and in 1921 began construction on the new segment of the Tamiami Trail. This segment is today known as Loop Road (located in Big Cypress National Preserve).

In 1922, the State of Florida ran out of construction funds for the east–west portion. The following year, Barron Collier, an advertising mogul who had recently diversified his holdings by investing in various types of businesses and millions of acres of southwest Florida wilderness, pledged that he would bankroll the completion of the Tamiami Trail; in return, the State legislature would establish a new county and name it after him.

So in 1923, Collier County was created out of the southern portion of Lee County. Almost immediately contention arose over the change of the route. The sponsors of the new county advocated for the original route, which was completely inside the boundaries of Collier County, and the State Road Department agreed with Collier County. Even so, the Board of County Commissioners of Dade County supported the Chevelier segment, since so much money had already been invested, and only a few miles of road were left to be completed.

Despite this protest, the State Road Department reinstated the original route of the Tamiami Trail to be completed, and the already completed portion of roadway in Monroe County was accepted as a &quot;South Loop&quot; of the Tamiami Trail. As construction of the north–south section resumed, Collier hired A. R. Richardson to be the head engineer of the Naples-to-Miami section. A few months later, A. W. Frederick replaced Richardson, who returned to the Everglades Drainage District.

The Tamiami Trail Blazers would launch an expedition leaving out of Fort Myers on April 4, 1923, with the goal of reaching Miami. The Blazers wanted to do this as a publicity stunt to try and get national attention. It would consist of a motorcade of 10 vehicles, a commissary truck, 7 Ford Model T&#x27;s, an Elcar and a tractor, conveying 29 people (25 men and 4 women). The party consisted of members of Florida county boards, the road department, as well as several native guides, most likely Seminoles. When the expedition did not arrive on time, it was speculated they had become lost and likely died which drew national attention to the expedition. Planes were sent to try and find them and parties to rescue them would be dispatched from both coasts. The expedition did end up making it to Miami. The first 11 would come to Miami 19 days after it started and the rest would come a few days later, but the expedition did lose three of their vehicles. Construction started on the east–west stretch later that year, thanks to funding from Barron Collier.

In 1926, both the north–south section and the east–west stretch were designated U.S. highways. Although the Trail was intended to be one road, the two sections received two different numbers: as each section was completed, the north–south portion received US 41 signs, and the east–west stretch was designated US 94 upon completion (to comply with the route-numbering guidelines of AASHTO). In addition, both sections south of Fort Myers received the State Road 27 designation.

North of Fort Myers, it was designated State Road 5.

While a 1927 Rand McNally map indicated the southern terminus at Fort Myers, US 41 signs had already been erected on the completed segment (south to Naples) in late 1926; US 94 signs made their appearances when the final section was completed in April 1928. The Tamiami Trail took 13 years, cost $8 million (equivalent to $ in ), and used 2.6 million sticks of dynamite in its construction. The Tamiami Trail officially opened on April 26, 1928. To celebrate, a convoy of over 500 cars would leave out of Tampa on the morning of April 25 and arrive in Miami during the late part of the next day.

===US 94===
Upon the completion of the Tamiami Trail, U.S. Highway 94 (US 94) extended from the intersection of Ninth Street South and Fifth Avenue South in Naples (the southern terminus of US 41) to the intersection of South Eighth Street and Brickell Avenue (US 1) in Miami. At the time it was considered a major achievement of engineering that was the only route from Naples (and, by extension, from Tampa) to the southeastern coast of Florida.

In 1945, a restructuring of Florida&#x27;s State Road system resulted in the removal of the SR 27 signs from US 94 and the assignment of the hidden Florida Department of Transportation designation State Road 90, which continues to be applied to the east–west stretch of highway to this day. The north-south section was assigned the designation State Road 45.

In 1949, the US 94 signage was replaced with US 41 signs, over a decade after AASHO modified its guidelines to discourage short (under ) U.S. Highways that are entirely within one state.

===After US 94===


In the 1950s, the newly configured US 41 was extended eastward and northward, first to downtown Miami along US 1 in 1950, then to Miami Beach along US 1 and SR A1A in 1953. In 1965, US 41 was rerouted as a bypass along unsigned SR 45A around Venice Gardens, while Business US 41 signs grace the former alignment (which is still named Tamiami Trail).

This configuration of US 41 south of Tampa remained intact until the U.S. Highway was truncated to US 1 and Southwest Eighth Street in Miami in 2001—the historic eastern terminus of US 94, former SR 27, and current SR 90 (westbound US 41 and SR 90 now begin one block to the north, on Southwest Seventh Street, as the easternmost of the U.S. Highway now lie along a one-way pair).

While US 41 and SR 90 have not significantly changed since the 1960s (aside from the widening to the east of SR 997 in Miami-Dade County in the 1970s and in 2002-2005), its importance to motorists of southeastern Florida has changed since the opening of Alligator Alley (I-75) to the north in 1968. Since then, traffic on the Tamiami Trail across the Everglades has lessened significantly, while urban sections of the road are now often congested.

In 1968, the Dade County Port Authority began construction on what was to become the world&#x27;s largest airport. The Miami Jetport was located west of Miami, just across the Collier County line. It was to be a six-runway supersonic airport. The project would also transform the Tamiami Trail into a multi-lane expressway. Conservationists were worried about the impact an airport that size would have on the environment of the Everglades and Big Cypress. After several court hearings, a ban was placed upon further development. The widening of Tamiami Trail as a part of the Jetport had been stopped. One runway had already been completed; so the runway was allowed to be used as a flight training center. The runway remains today as a part of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport.
Also in 1968, construction of an extension of Interstate 75 (I-75) south from Tampa to Miami was started, with an eye toward routing the freeway along an upgraded Tamiami Trail from Naples to a soon-to-be completed SR 836 whereupon it would continue on the east–west highway to its intended terminus at an interchange with I-95. However, planners made the decision in 1973 to shift I-75&#x27;s proposed route to instead cross the Everglades along Alligator Alley over environmental concerns related to upgrading the Tamiami Trail, which runs along the northern border of Everglades National Park. Additionally, Alligator Alley itself needed upgrading, as the then-narrow toll road was dangerous to both motorists and wildlife (most notably the Florida panther) alike, and SR 836, with its left exits and narrow lanes, was not being built to Interstate Highway standards, with the costs to upgrade it being too expensive. As a result, construction for a rerouted I-75 in southern Florida began in 1974, now with I-75 using Alligator Alley instead of US 41 to cross the peninsula. The configured Interstate would not be completed for another 19 years.

Since then, the Tamiami Trail has been designated a National Scenic Byway by the United States Department of Transportation for its unique scenery in the Everglades and the Big Cypress National Preserve.

==Future==

===Plans===

In 1928, the Tamiami Trail was considered a feat of engineering, although there appears to have been minimal consideration of the potential damage to the Everglades by the roadway and the Tamiami Canal. Both have acted as a dam to block water flow from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay at the southern tip of the peninsula. As a result, the Everglades—the &quot;River of Grass&quot;—has had its water flow greatly diminished over the years, resulting in a devastating effect on the ecology of the region. In the 1990s, a few canals were filled and additional culverts were constructed under US 41 to help regulate water flow.

Yet, according to the United States Army Corps of Engineers, this was only a partial solution to the problems of the Everglades and the Tamiami Trail. In 2003, after considering a variety of plans involving the rebuilding of US 41/SR 90, the Corps recommended that a causeway be built near the Northeast Shark Slough northeast of Everglades National Park, all road fill removed that would otherwise be adjacent to the bridge, the 57 culverts that are already in place maintained, and the appropriate water flow rate maintained under the non-causeway portions of the Tamiami Trail crossing the Everglades. The proposed causeway is being called the Everglades Skyway by the Sierra Club, Audubon Society, World Wildlife Fund, and other organizations in an Internet-based effort to lobby Florida and United States government officials for project construction money. In December 2009, construction began on a project to lift a portion of the road to allow the more natural water flow into the southern Everglades. At the Everglades Foundation&#x27;s America&#x27;s Everglades Summit held in mid-May 2010, Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of Interior, Thomas Strickland, revealed that the Interior Department&#x27;s National Park Service released a draft Environmental Impact Statement recommending an additional of bridging the Tamiami Trail. The Everglades Foundation is a group that supports the Tamiami Trail bridging and dedicated to Everglades restoration.

In 2013, Florida announced a $90 million commitment to elevate of the road to allow natural drainage into the Everglades and Everglades National Park.

In June 2019, a $60 million grant was announced by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to Everglades National Park through the Nationally Significant Federal Lands and Tribal Projects program to complete the Tamiami Trail Next Steps project, intended to allow more north-to-south water flow into the Everglades. This grant matches a $43.5 million commitment by the State of Florida for the raising and reconstruction of the remaining of the eastern Tamiami Trail roadway.

As of September 2020, the plan to complete and finish the Tamiami Trail has been approved for the final steps of the project. Through the Trump Administration, The Florida Department of Transportation, and Everglades National Park, they have been able to finalize these plans. This will help improve water flow within the wetlands and to restore many parts of the Tamiami Trail and the Everglades National Park as a whole. These plans to begin the final steps will start November 2020 and should be finished by the end of 2024.

<text>Ugly Man Records is a British independent record label based in Rhos on Sea, Wales, originally in Manchester. It released debut singles for many Manchester bands, including Elbow, the Man From Delmonte and I Am Kloot. It was set up in Bootle, Merseyside in 1986 with the release of &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; by the Liverpool-based singer Black, which reached number 72 in the UK Singles Chart, before going on to greater success when reissued by major label A&amp;M.

<doc id="849170" wikidata="Q3459144" url="?curid=849170" title="SAFEGE">
<text>SAFEGE is an acronym for the French consortium &quot;Société Anonyme Française d&#x27;Etude de Gestion et d&#x27;Entreprises&quot; () and is pronounced in English.

==Company==
The consortium, consisting of 25 companies, including the tire-maker Michelin and the Renault automotive company, is a consulting and engineering bureau. It was formed in 1919 as &quot;Société Auxiliaire Française d&#x27;Électricité, Gaz et Eau&quot;, a holding company with interests in private water, gas, and electricity production and distribution. When in 1947, these public utilities were nationalised, the company became the engineering and consulting office which it is today, taking the name &quot;Société Anonyme Française d&#x27;Études, de Gestion et d&#x27;Entreprises&quot;.

Today the company is a subsidiary of Suez Environnement and specialises as a consultancy in water and environmental engineering, but not only (bought IDC, etc.) Its main market is France, with 60% of the turnover. It also is a leader in several consortias beneficiaries of lots from the EC FWCs (6, 11 and coleading the 2).

==SAFEGE type monorail==

SAFEGE gained international recognition for its design of a suspended monorail in the 1960s. The design team was headed by Lucien Chadenson.

===Design concept===

The design of the system entails suspending passenger cars beneath rubber-tired wheel carriages of the type used more conventionally in the Paris Metro. The carriages are enclosed and supported by a box-like track or beam, with an opening in the bottom. The rubber wheels of the train run inside the track, supported by flanges on the bottom of the beam.

Unlike previous suspended monorails like the Schwebebahn in Wuppertal, Germany, the tracks are not exposed to inclement weather, and do not need any cleaning or ice-removal systems. This advantage enables them to run in cities where ice and other conditions would impair the reliability of the system.

===Test installation===
The test track built in France by SAFEGE in 1959, was a monorail line that featured prominently in the 1966 movie adaptation of &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, directed by François Truffaut. Although the track was dismantled not long thereafter, the original car survived longer.

===Market position===

SAFEGE systems are the leading type of suspended railway in transit use, though this consists of just four installations of two different systems. Its chief and more numerous competitor in modern monorail applications are variations of the German-designed ALWEG system, in which the vehicles run on top of, and straddle, a solid beam.

===SAFEGE-type monorails in the world===
====Mitsubishi Heavy Industries====
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan has developed a working system of SAFEGE-type suspended railways, and have made three such installations, two of which remain in operation today.

*From early 1964 to December 1974, a single-line ran between Higashiyama Zoo and the nearby Botanical Gardens in Nagoya, Japan. While initially popular, it also suffered from mechanical problems and after the first two years of operation, the novelty wore off and it began making a loss. Plans to expand the zoo and gardens hastened its demise, although the car and a section of track is preserved at one of the stations. While it was initially marketed as a ride, rather than a means of transport, a fare was charged, making it the first revenue-earning SAFEGE/Mitsubishi-type monorail.
*In 1970 the Shonan Monorail opened. It runs from Ōfuna Station in Kamakura to Shōnan-Enoshima Station in Fujisawa. 
*In 1988, the first stage of the Chiba Urban Monorail system opened, in Chiba. With a route length, it is the longest suspended monorail in the world.

====Siemens====
*Two Siemens SIPEM lines exist in Germany, one on the Dortmund University campus, the other at the Düsseldorf airport. Siemens no longer actively markets this system, but does still deliver the software for the automatic operation of a SIPEM network and vehicles.

====Unfulfilled proposals====
In 1966, a proposal was considered to construct a SAFEGE-type monorail in the City of Manchester. The line was planned to link Manchester Airport with the city and suburbs, with a tunnel under the city centre, but the scheme, along with the later Picc-Vic tunnel (which would be a conventional rapid transit line) was abandoned due to cost. The city eventually developed its own light rail network, Manchester Metrolink, of which one of its lines, opened in 2014, now links Manchester Airport to the city centre.

In November 1967, General Electric proposed to construct a SAFEGE monorail from downtown San Francisco to San Francisco International Airport. The City of San Francisco studied the proposal, along with an extension of the Southern Pacific Railroad&#x27;s Peninsula Commute commuter rail line and an extension of the BART rapid transit system. The proposal&#x27;s incompatibility with other rail transit lines, the urban design concerns of an elevated guideway, and potential competitive impact on parallel rapid transit lines led to its dismissal in favor of a BART extension. Ultimately SFO was connected to downtown San Francisco via BART in 2003.

<text>The Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP) was the United States&#x27; general plan for nuclear war from 1961 to 2003. The SIOP gave the President of the United States a range of targeting options, and described launch procedures and target sets against which nuclear weapons would be launched. The plan integrated the capabilities of the nuclear triad of strategic bombers, land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), and sea-based submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM). The SIOP was a highly classified document, and was one of the most secret and sensitive issues in U.S. national security policy.

The first SIOP, titled SIOP-62, was finished on 14 December 1960 and implemented on 1 July 1961 (the start of fiscal year 1962). The SIOP was updated annually until February 2003, when it was replaced by Operations Plan (OPLAN) 8044. Since July 2012, the US nuclear war plan has been OPLAN 8010-12, &quot;Strategic Deterrence and Force Employment&quot;.

==Planning process==
While much of the United States&#x27; nuclear war planning process remains classified, some information on the former SIOP planning process has been made public. The planning process began with the President issuing a presidential directive establishing the concepts, goal, and guidelines that provided guidance to the nuclear planners. The Secretary of Defense then used the President&#x27;s guidance to produce the Nuclear Weapons Employment Policy (NUWEP) that specified basic planning assumptions, attack options, targeting objectives, types of targets, targeting constraints, and coordination with combatant commanders. The NUWEP was then used by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) to create the &quot;Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP), Annex C (Nuclear).&quot; This document established a more detailed and elaborate set of goals and conditions that included targeting and damage criteria for the use of nuclear weapons. The final stage in the planning process occurred when the Strategic Air Command (SAC) (from 1961 to 1992) or the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) (from 1992 to 2003) took the guidance from the JSCP and created the actual nuclear war plan that becomes the SIOP. Detailed planning was carried out by the Joint Strategic Target Planning Staff (JSTPS) co-located with SAC Headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska.

As part of SIOP planning, Strategic Air Command (SAC, later USSTRATCOM) developed a set of plans and a series of options based on a target set known as the National Target Base (NTB). The number of targets in the NTB varied over time, from 16,000 in 1985 to 12,500 at the end of the Cold War in 1991, to 2,500 by 2001. The SIOP was primarily directed against targets in the Soviet Union (later Russia) but targets in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which had been part of the SIOP until the 1970s, were added back into the plan in 1997. In 1999, the NTB reportedly included targets in Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Libya.

==History==
SIOP, and its renamed successors, is most importantly an &quot;integrated&quot; plan that uses both Air Force and Navy delivery systems; it is &quot;single&quot; only in the sense that it comes out of one planning group. The &quot;plan&quot; actually contains multiple &quot;attack options&quot; that are themselves complex plans.

===Early targeting after the Second World War===

====Truman====

There is no evidence that the Soviet Union&#x27;s contingency plans from the end of World War II to 1950 were anything but routine and defensive, and the substantial postwar demobilization of the Soviet military supports the view that the USSR did not view a new war in Europe as likely. Although Soviet doctrine incorporated an assumption of innate hostility of the capitalist powers to Communism, Soviet leader Josef Stalin apparently believed that neither the USSR nor the West could afford to fight another world war, and was skeptical of the Western ability to raise an army large enough to occupy Soviet territory. Soviet planning thus emphasized defenses against nuclear bombing, and attacks on Western European bomber bases. Plans in 1946 and 1948 assumed that during war with an unspecified enemy, Soviet forces in Germany would assume defensive positions within the Soviet occupation zone and wait for reinforcements before counterattacking.

Soviet conventional forces greatly outnumbered the West&#x27;s, however, and United States strategic nuclear strike plans were developed accordingly. While the United States was the only nation with the atomic bomb, in 1946 it had only 17 Silverplate B-29 bombers and 11 atomic bombs. Many early American war plans were based on using hundreds of nonexisting weapons; for example, an autumn 1945 plan envisioned using 196 atomic bombs on Soviet industrial targets, but SAC could not deliver such quantities until 1952. The bombs were of the Mark 3 type, weighing five tons and requiring 39 men two days to assemble. The press reported that &quot;atomic-capable&quot; B-29s were deployed to Britain in mid-1948 during the Berlin Blockade, by which time the US possessed about 50 atomic weapons. The Soviets likely knew through espionage, however, that none of the aircraft was a Silverplate; rather, they would have been used as part of plan DOUBLEQUICK, involving World War II-like sustained conventional bombing raids on Soviet air bases in Eastern Europe. Other than increasing its anti-aircraft defenses, the Soviets did not change its military preparations in any way during the blockade, unlike the reaction in the West. Although the Soviets launched an intensive public relations effort in 1949, aided by sympathetic Western European fellow travelers, to oppose the formation of NATO, the new alliance&#x27;s military strength was so weak that the Politburo did not bother to discuss it for six months after its formation.

Strategic bombing during World War II of key transportation and energy sites was more effective than attacking cities, and early postwar non-nuclear war plans envisioned focusing on the Soviet petroleum industry. US war planners lacked updated maps of the USSR, however, and had to use pre-World War II maps—some older than the Russian Revolution—or perhaps German aerial photos from the war. Due in part to the lack of updated intelligence, nuclear planning increasingly focused on urban areas, which were easier to target and offered the potential for &quot;bonus damage&quot;. The early Plan Totality targeted 20 cities with the 30 nuclear bombs then available. Plan BROILER (November 1947) envisioned 34 bombs on 24 Soviet cities. It and later plans such as HALFMOON (May 1948; 50 bombs on 20 cities) and OFFTACKLE (December 1949; 104 urban targets, 220 bombs, 72 more reserved for follow-up attacks) envisioned Western forces in Europe slowly retreating while the United Kingdom was reinforced as an air base for atomic attacks on the Soviet Union. President Harry S. Truman hoped for an international ban on atomic weapons and believed that the American people would not support their use for &quot;aggressive purposes&quot;, and ordered JCS to devise a plan for conventional war; however, Secretary of Defense James Forrestal in July 1948 ordered it to stop and resume atomic war planning due to the Berlin crisis.

Officials were pessimistic about the effectiveness of the atomic plans, however. Britain&#x27;s December 1948 SPEEDWAY plan assumed that the Soviets would not have atomic weapons, but nonetheless forecast that the West could not &quot;withstand a Russian advance in Western Europe, even with the full defence co-operation of the Western Powers&quot;, including 560 American and British atomic-capable bombers. The American TROJAN (December 1948) envisioned 133 bombs (although only 50 existed) hitting 70 cities. A committee led by General Hubert R. Harmon reported in May 1949 that even if all precisely hit their targets, the USSR would not surrender, its leadership would not be seriously weakened, and its military could still operate in Western Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. The attacks would reduce Soviet industrial capacity by 30 to 40%, but only temporarily without follow-up attacks. The Harmon report had three immediate results: 1) It supported those within the United States Navy and elsewhere who criticized the centrality of atomic bombs and mass attacks on cities in American war planning. 2) It led to a substantial rise in nuclear-weapons production. 3) It caused the Joint Chiefs of Staff to, in the fall of 1949, assign SAC with the duty of slowing a Soviet invasion of Western Europe as part of NATO. Erroneous US and British intelligence reports led to exaggerated NATO estimates of Soviet conventional forces. One 1951 estimate foresaw 175 combat divisions allegedly prepared to simultaneously attack Western Europe, the United Kingdom, the Balkans, the Middle East, and North America. The perceived imbalance in forces was so great that American planners feared that even Britain would have to be abandoned during the invasion, a possibility they did not discuss with their British counterparts.

Stalin did consider the possibility of war in Asia, as opposed to Europe. In January 1950, he approved Kim Il Sung&#x27;s proposal to conquer South Korea in what became the Korean War that summer, believing that victory there would discredit NATO. The gambit backfired, however; despite their initial optimism the Communists were unable to defeat the US-led forces in Korea, and the war greatly increased Western military spending, for the first time making NATO a significant threat against the Soviets in Europe. By late 1950, the USSR notified its Eastern European satellites to prepare for war by the end of 1952, a date matching Western estimates. In early 1951, based on an alleged NATO plan to launch a European war that year from Western proxy Yugoslavia during the Informbiro period as a response to its defeat in Korea, he ordered a massive increase in Eastern European forces that hurt the weaker Communist economies. Based on the Korean precedent, the Soviets apparently expected that the West would not use atomic weapons in a European war. During Stalin&#x27;s lifetime, Soviet doctrine foresaw the next war as a more destructive version of World War II similarly decided by giant armies supported by massive home fronts, a type of conflict which benefited from the Soviet Union&#x27;s innate strengths.

The Soviet Union tested its first atomic weapon in 1949, but Stalin seems to have viewed possessing it as a political rather than military benefit, and he did not integrate atomic weapons into the Soviet military&#x27;s equipment. A 1951 Warsaw Pact war plan for Poland was, Vojtech Mastny wrote, &quot;unequivocally defensive&quot; even while &quot;NATO was haunted by the nightmare of armed communist hordes sweeping all but unopposed through Europe&quot;. The Soviets assumed that Western forces were ready to invade and that Eastern Europeans would see them as liberators; as in the West, the Soviets overestimated their enemies&#x27; strength.

By this time, Truman was pessimistic about international arms control and told his advisors &quot;Since we can&#x27;t obtain international control we must be strongest in atomic weapons.&quot; He approved the Harmon report&#x27;s recommendation for increased weapons production, and approved another increase soon after the start of the Korean War. JCS decided to emphasize &quot;the destruction of known targets affecting the Soviet capability to deliver atomic bombs&quot;, with refineries, chemical and power plants, and shipyards as secondary and tertiary targets. The three categories were codenamed BRAVO (blunting), ROMEO (retardation), and DELTA (disruption/destruction) of the Soviet ability to fight, and formed the basis of American nuclear targeting for almost a decade.

When military theorist Bernard Brodie studied the resulting target list, however, he strongly criticized the planners&#x27; ignorance of actual Soviet military capacity and the resulting failure to estimate what effect the attacks would have. Brodie later recalled that &quot;There was no calculated strategy for destroying Soviet capability to make war. The planners &quot;simply expected the Soviet Union &#x27;to collapse&#x27; as a result of the bombing campaign... People kept talking about the &#x27;Sunday punch&#x27;.&quot; He recommended that targets be chosen based on analysis of the results of their destruction, and that &quot;city-avoidance&quot; strategies be studied. Brodie presented his report in April 1951, but JCS found SAC head General Curtis LeMay more persuasive. LeMay objected to the list because of the difficulty of attacking isolated targets and the requirement for pre-attack reconnaissance for many of them. He preferred attacking industrial targets in urban areas so that even if a bomb missed, &quot;a bonus will be derived from the use of the bomb&quot;. The target panel agreed to have SAC review future target lists before sending them to JCS.

====Eisenhower====

By the end of 1953, SAC would have 1,000 nuclear-capable bombers and was deploying the B-47 jet bomber. In January 1953, Dwight D. Eisenhower inherited the Truman administration&#x27;s large defense budget. The new president believed such expenditures threatened the economy, and cut $5 billion in defense spending that spring. Based on extensive experience with nuclear strategy and targeting from his terms as Chief of Staff of the United States Army and NATO Supreme Allied Commander, the Eisenhower administration&#x27;s NSC 162/2 of October 1953 chose a less expensive, defensive-oriented direction for the military that emphasized &quot;massive retaliation&quot;, still primarily delivered by USAF, to deter war.

The document formalized efforts begun under Truman to deploy newly developed tactical nuclear weapons small enough for most Air Force and Navy planes. The administration believed that they would be useful both during a general war and to deter a local one in Europe, and Eisenhower said of tactical weapons that &quot;on strictly military targets and for strictly military purposes, I see no reason why they shouldn&#x27;t be used just exactly as you would use a bullet or anything else&quot;.

The doctrine of massive retaliation meant that, for the first time, atomic weapons became the basis of NATO strategy rather than an option of last resort. Similarly, the Soviet doctrine of non-atomic warfare began to change after Stalin&#x27;s death in March 1953. In September that year a general proposed in a military journal that new weaponry might end a war quickly unlike World War II, and in October the Soviet Army held its first military exercise based on the enemy using atomic weapons. In 1954 Soviet forces in Europe received their first tactical atomic weapons, by which time Soviet officers publicly debated in the journal the merits of preemptive war.

====Prevention versus preemption====

Many in the West also seriously discussed the idea of preventive and preemptive war. Truman rejected preventive war, stating that &quot;[s]tarting an atomic war is totally unthinkable for rational men&quot;, but Attlee stated in 1945 that &quot;twice is he armed who gets in the first blow&quot;. JCS proposed in 1947 that the president be authorized to use atomic bombs to prevent a nuclear attack. NSC 68 of April 1950 opposed &quot;a military attack not provoked by a military attack on us or on our allies&quot;, but acknowledged &quot;if possible&quot; the benefits of preemptively &quot;landing the first blow&quot; before the Soviet Union did so. In August 1950 Secretary of the Navy Francis Matthews publicly advocated a preventive war, but NSC 68 forecast that even after a massive preventive attack the USSR would likely not surrender and its forces could still &quot;dominate most or all of Eurasia.&quot;

A committee led by retired general Jimmy Doolittle suggested in spring 1953 that the administration study the possibility of giving the Soviets two years to cooperate, with the threat of possible war otherwise, and an Air Force study in August warned of &quot;The Coming National Crisis&quot; due to having to negotiate with a country run by &quot;the whims of a small group of proven barbarians&quot;. Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles discussed that month their fears that, once the Soviets acquired fusion weapons, the resulting situation might force the United States into either war or dictatorship. The president disagreed with the Doolittle committee. His administration in 1954 issued a Basic National Security Policy statement: &quot;The United States and its allies must reject the concept of preventive war or acts intended to provoke war&quot;.

While Eisenhower and other civilian and military leaders doubted the morality or legality of preventive war, preemptive war was much less problematic given that NSC 5410/1 March 1954 acknowledged that &quot;the survival of the United States&quot; was at risk. The Central Intelligence Agency believed that it could warn of a surprise Soviet attack days or even weeks ahead of time because of the necessary preparation time, and that up to 30 days would be needed to deliver all Soviet weapons. The BRAVO-ROMEO-DELTA targeting strategy continued, with tactical weapons to be used in Europe while SAC delivered strategic weapons to the USSR.

LeMay disagreed with the JCS strategy of SAC making three separate attacks during a Soviet war: The first against airfields, the second on advancing troops, the third on cities and government centers. He continued to favor the &quot;Sunday Punch&quot; approach, in which his more than one thousand bomber crews could deliver 750 bombs in a few hours, while the USSR might need one month to deliver its 150 bombs. Weapons Systems Evaluation Group calculated that the 750 bombs would cause 17 million Soviet-bloc deaths and 60 million casualties. SAC obtained almost independent target selection by 1955. The Air Force often used target lists to justify greater weapons production, then greater spending on delivery systems for the additional weapons. Although other services opposed such &quot;bootstrapping&quot;, they did not have the IBM 704 computer that SAC used to analyze target priorities so could not offer competing selection lists. Its Basic War Plan of March 1954 planned for up to 735 bombers to simultaneously and massively attack all targets, military and urban, in the USSR. Eisenhower preferred to avoid civilian targets, and by 1954 several Air Force planners advocated a &quot;no-cities&quot; strategy.

Other planners and USAF leadership believed that the Soviet Union could support its &quot;&quot;immense&quot; armed forces for at least two years of intensive warfare&quot; if industrial and government centers were not attacked. The possibility existed, they believed, that SAC could in fact deliver a &quot;decisive&quot; attack on the USSR, a tempting idea given the power of the 15-megaton hydrogen bombs being tested. In a 1956 speech to the National War College, LeMay said that if SAC was ordered to use its full nuclear arsenal against the USSR, &quot;Between sunset tonight and sunrise tomorrow morning the Soviet Union would likely cease to be a major military power or even a major nation&quot;, while the USSR could not yet do the same to the US but was building the necessary arsenal. He stated in a 1988 interview that

Because of the prohibition of the US starting a preventive war, LeMay may have been trying to provoke the Soviets to raise their alert level high enough to justify a preemptive war. Two studies soon concluded that the opportunity to easily win such a war either no longer existed or would soon disappear. Weapons Systems Evaluation Group stated in February 1955 that destroying all known Soviet bases would require twice as large a force as the United States expected to field. A National Security Council study found that by mid-1958 the only defense against a devastating Soviet attack would be to attack first after being warned, which Eisenhower believed was impossible. Given the apparent impracticality of massive retaliation strategy, Army Chiefs of Staff Matthew Ridgway and his successor Maxwell Taylor argued within JCS that deterrence, instead of the &quot;worst case&quot; scenario of a full-scale nuclear war, should be the focus.

More conventional forces were needed to prevent limited wars from leading to larger nuclear ones; similarly, tactical nuclear weapons should be avoided in local wars to prevent escalation. Eisenhower, however, believed that tactical weapons should be viewed similarly to very large conventional &quot;blockbusters&quot;, and did not want American forces stalled within small wars. Massive retaliation remained the basis of American war planning; the Killian Committee reported in 1955 that &quot;We have an offensive advantage but are vulnerable to surprise attack&quot; (emphasis in original), and NATO estimated after the Hungarian revolution of 1956 that during wartime Western forces would retreat to the Rhine River within 48 hours.

By the 1950s, around 5,500 targets were listed to receive SAC bomber strikes; these targets consisted primarily of industrial sites but included counterforce targets. These plans, primarily by the Air Force, tended to be based on selecting targets in order to use up the available weapons, rather than considering the desired effects or strategic outcomes. From a 1957 letter from John H. Moore, former director of nuclear planning, air operations branch, United States European Command, Air Force target planning methodology can be inferred &quot;blast damage frame,&quot; with such references as &quot;damage to concrete structures&quot; and the requirement for a &quot;high probability of cratering runways.&quot; He cited the &quot;destructive and disruptive nature of nuclear weapons&quot; with megaton yields: &quot;the cumulative or ancillary effects may be as great or greater than primary damage.&quot; Specifically, he considered delayed radiation but not thermal effects, but called attention to the idea of &quot;bonus&quot; effects, in which the totality of weapons effects would allow lower-yield weapons to achieve the &quot;desired destruction.&quot; In the letter to the head of the Atomic Energy Commission, Lewis Strauss, Moore noted that the Pentagon &quot;rigorously suppressed&quot; this study and destroyed all copies.

Prior to the development of SIOP and survivable command and control, Eisenhower predelegated nuclear release authority to certain senior commanders. In April 1956, for example, he authorized Air Defense Command to use Genie air-to-air and Nike Hercules surface-to-air missiles during a surprise attack. There have continued to be Continuity of Nuclear Operations Plans (COOP), which designated enough subordinates who, in the event of the National Command Authority and immediate successors being killed in a &quot;decapitation&quot; attack, could still retaliate. While the details have never been made public, Eisenhower&#x27;s predelegation, and a Federation of American Scientists summary, give a framework. 

===Presidential involvement and the start of civilian policy direction===
In 1958, George Kistiakowsky, a key Manhattan Project scientist and Science Advisor in the Eisenhower Administration, suggested to the President that inspection of foreign military facilities was not sufficient to control their nuclear weapons. Kistiakowsky was particularly concerned with the difficulty of verifying the number, type, and deployment of nuclear-armed missiles on missile submarines, and proposed that the arms control strategy focus on disarmament rather than inspections. He was also concerned with the short warning times available from intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launches, which took away the lengthy decision time available when the nuclear threat came exclusively from manned bombers.

Eisenhower sent Kistiakowsky to Strategic Air Command headquarters where he was, at first, rebuffed. At the same time as the early nuclear arms control work, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Nathan F. Twining, USAF, sent a memorandum in August 1959, to the Secretary of Defense, Neil McElroy, which suggested that the Strategic Air Command be formally assigned responsibility to prepare the national nuclear target list, and a single plan for nuclear operations. Up to that point, the Army, Navy, and Air Force had done their own target planning. That had led to individual targets being multiply targeted by the different services. The separate service plans were not mutually supporting, as, for example, by the Navy destroying an air defense facility on the route of an Air Force bomber going to a target deeper inland. While Twining had sent the memo to McElroy, the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff disagreed on the policy during early 1960. Thomas Gates, who succeeded McElroy, asked President Dwight D. Eisenhower to decide the policy.

Eisenhower said he would not &quot;leave his successor with the monstrosity&quot; of the uncoordinated and non-integrated forces that then existed. When Kistiakowsky was not given access, Eisenhower sent him back with a much stronger set of orders giving SAC officers the choice to cooperate with Kistiakowsky, or resign.

Kistiakowsky&#x27;s report, presented on 29 November, described uncoordinated plans with huge numbers of targets, many of which would be attacked by multiple forces, resulting in overkill. Eisenhower was shocked by the plans, and focused not just on the creation of the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP), but on the entire process of picking targets, generating requirements, and planning for nuclear war operations. Separate operational plans from the Air Force and the Navy were combined to form the foundation of the SIOP.

===The first SIOP===
The first plan, following the White House policy guidance, was developed in 1960, consisting of a list of targets (the National Strategic Target List, or NSTL) and the assets to be used against each target. The targets themselves were pulled from the Bombing Encyclopedia, which listed over 80,000 targets of interest. This first SIOP was extensively revised by a team at the RAND Corporation to become SIOP-62, describing a massive strike with the entire US arsenal of 3,200 warheads, totaling 7,847 megatons, against the USSR, China, and Soviet-aligned states with urban and other targets being hit simultaneously. Nine weapons were to be &quot;laid down&quot; on four targets in Leningrad, 23 weapons on six target complexes in Moscow, 18 on seven target areas in Kaliningrad, etc.

Weapon scientist, George Rathjens, looked through SAC&#x27;s atlas of Soviet cities, searching for the town that most closely resembled Hiroshima in size and industrial concentration. When he found one that roughly matched, he asked how many bombs the SIOP &quot;laid down&quot; on that city. The reply: one 4.5 megaton bomb and three more 1.1 megaton weapons in case the big bomb was a dud (the Hiroshima bomb was 12.5 kilotons). The execution of SIOP-62 was estimated to result in 285 million dead and 40 million casualties in the Soviet Union and China. Presented with all the facts and figures, Thomas D. White of the Air Force found the Plan &quot;splendid.&quot; Disregarding the human aspect, SIOP-62 represented an outstanding technological achievement:

The first SIOP, based on the massive retaliation doctrine, had little flexibility, treating all Communist countries as a uniform bloc. Document JCS 2056/220 expressed the concerns of U.S. Marine Commandant David Shoup that the 1961 draft was inconsistent with a 1959 NSC policy guidance paper approved by Eisenhower. Shoup was especially concerned with language in the draft SIOP that said

The National Security Archive commentary reports that Shoup asked USAF/SAC Commander Thomas Power &quot;...what would happen if Beijing was not fighting; was there an option to leave Chinese targets out of the attack plan?&quot; Power was reported to have said that he hoped no one would think of that &quot;because it would really screw up the plan&quot;—that is, the plan was supposed to be executed as a whole. Apparently, Shoup then observed that &quot;any plan that kills millions of Chinese when it isn&#x27;t even their war is not a good plan. This is not the American way.&quot;

SIOP-62 included the virtual obliteration of the tiny country of Albania because within its borders sat huge Soviet air-defense radar, which had to be taken out with high assurance. Power smiled at Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and said with a mock straight face: &quot;Well, Mr. Secretary, I hope you don&#x27;t have any friends or relations in Albania, because we are just going to have to wipe it out.&quot; McNamara was left with a &quot;macabre, shallow, and horrifying&quot; impression.

====SIOP-63====
During 1961–1962, the Kennedy administration revised this plan as supervised by McNamara. He aimed to change the doctrine from massive retaliation to flexible response. SIOP-63 took effect in July 1962 and remained mostly unchanged for more than ten years. Instead of one &quot;spasm&quot; attack, it proposed five escalating attack options:

# Soviet nuclear missile sites, bomber airfields, and submarine tenders.
# Other military sites away from cities, such as air defenses.
# Military sites near cities.
# Command-and-control centers.
# Full-scale &quot;spasm&quot; attack.

Many smaller target options were also created for possible use. The plan contemplated the possibility that options 1 and 2 be used to prevent an &quot;impending major Sino-Soviet Bloc attack upon the U.S. or its allies&quot;. By 1963, however, McNamara concluded that such plans were useless, because the situations for which nuclear weapons might be used were so unpredictable that advanced planning was impossible.

The five attack options did not address each target category (much less any subsets) separately. Rather, the options were cumulative, each adding a target category to the previous one. All required the expenditure of thousands of nuclear weapons and were subsequently criticized as &quot;five options for massive retaliation.&quot;

By the mid-1960s both sides had much more accurate understanding of the opposition&#x27;s forces. While the Soviets were catching up to the Americans&#x27; strategic nuclear weapons, NATO was catching up to the Warsaw Pact&#x27;s conventional forces, in part with tactical nuclear weapons. This increased both sides&#x27; confidence; a 1964 Warsaw Pact plan for Czechoslovakia written as a result of the Berlin Crisis of 1961 assumed that the East could capture Lyon within two weeks after the start of hostilities, while contemporary NATO plans expected that it could stop the Warsaw Pact near the eastern border of West Germany, in contrast to the earlier fears of the English Channel if at all. The Warsaw Pact plan did not consider the possibility that American strategic weapons might have crippled the Soviet Union, assuming that superior Soviet air defenses would have stopped most enemy missiles while invading NATO troops would have, the plan stated, &quot;suffered enormous losses from [Soviet] nuclear strikes&quot;.

The Czechoslovakia plan was approved on 14 October 1964, the day Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev was overthrown, and after the Prague Spring in 1968 the Soviets had to completely remove the Czech military from its plans. By the late 1960s they moved to a war strategy that lessened the dependence on nuclear weapons, resembling the West&#x27;s flexible response. Warsaw Pact plans continued to assume, however, that NATO would make a surprise attack which it would repulse into the west; the East Germans even prepared occupation currency and new street signs.

===Counterforce migrates to deterrence and warfighting===

Studies began in 1972–1973 to provide more flexibility for the use of American nuclear weapons. In January 1974 President Richard M. Nixon approved NSDM-242, intended to add more &quot;limited employment options&quot; to help manage escalation, to SIOP-63. The related Nuclear Weapons Employment Policy (NUWEP) of April 1974 provided targets to achieve various goals; for example, the document stated that the United States nuclear forces must possess the ability to destroy 70% of the industrial capacity the Soviet Union needed to recover after a war. These documents formed the basis of SIOP-5 (January 1976), sometimes called the Schlesinger Doctrine after Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger. The ever-expanding target lists were split into classes of targets, with a wider range of plans matching strikes to political intentions from counterforce to countervalue, or any mix/withhold strategy to control escalation. Schlesinger described the doctrine as having three main aspects:
:#The National Command Authority or its successors should have many choices about the use of weapons, always having an option to escalate.
:#Targeting should make it very explicit that the first requisite is selective retaliation against the enemy&#x27;s military (i.e., tailored counterforce).
:#Some targets and target classes should not be struck, at least at first, to give the opponent a rational reason to terminate the conflict. Reduced collateral damage was another benefit of this &quot;withhold&quot; method.

The SIOP policy was further modified during the Carter presidency under Presidential Directive 59, a key section of which stated

The employment of nuclear forces must be effectively related to operations of our general purpose forces. Our doctrines for the use of forces in nuclear conflict must insure that we can pursue specific policy objectives selected by the National Command Authorities at that time, from general guidelines established in advance. (S)

PD59 explored a &quot;warfighting&quot; doctrine that suggested that nuclear plans might change during a war, and that nuclear weapons were to be used in combination with conventional weapons. Carter&#x27;s Secretary of Defense, Harold Brown, emphasized selective counterforce, but also explicitly threatened the Soviet leadership themselves. Major improvements in U.S. command, control, communications and intelligence (C3I), including making elements survivable during a nuclear war, were instituted to make the PD-59 doctrine feasible. Although secret NATO guidelines reportedly limited the size of nuclear weapons that the alliance could use on its territory to 10 kilotons, and prohibited their use in urban NATO areas, by 1982 SIOP-5 contained more than 40,000 possible targets in four categories:

# Soviet nuclear forces. Examples: ICBM launch centers and control facilities, bomber airfields, ballistic-missile submarine bases.
# Conventional forces. Examples: Supply depots, conventional airfields, ammunition storage, tank storage yards.
# Military and political centers. Examples: Command posts, communications facilities.
# Economic and industrial centers. Examples: Factories for ammunition and tanks, refineries, steel and aluminum plants, power plants.

Whether Soviet military doctrine recognized the difference between counterforce and a general attack was unknown. A 1982 analysis stated, however, that the technically inferior Soviet attack-assessment system would likely have difficulty in differentiating between such attacks. In any case, given that the majority of Soviet nuclear airfields and missile sites were located west of the Ural mountains, many in major population centers, the analysis concluded that the American plans for flexible use of force were meaningless. The author was also skeptical of whether communications to manage escalation—whether on the Moscow–Washington hotline, or between command authorities and their deployed nuclear submarines and bombers—could be maintained, and observed that use of nuclear weapons &quot;are not suited to signalling any precise and unambiguous message&quot;.

===Return to counterforce, with strategic defense===

During the Reagan administration, there was a return to a strong counterforce strategy through NSDD-13. This included development of strategic weapons systems that were more accurate, more survivable, or both. Some of these systems eventually took the role of bargaining chips in arms control negotiations, although some, such as the B-2 &quot;stealth&quot; bomber remained highly classified as potential surprises in war. The B-2 was also seen as a counter to Soviet deployment of mobile missiles, which only a manned bomber could find and attack.

In 1983, President Reagan gave a speech proposing, at the least, research and development into non-nuclear defense systems against nuclear-armed missiles. The idea of effective Strategic Defense Initiative was a potential disruption to the existing balance of Mutual assured destruction, even with its &quot;warfighting&quot; refinements.

===Renaming and refocusing===
On 1 March 2003, the SIOP was renamed &quot;OPLAN 8022&quot;, and later CONPLAN (contingency plan) 8022. It went into deployment in July 2004, but it was reported cancelled in July 2007. It may have been superseded by an expanded CONPLAN 8044.

Another set of &quot;Global Strike&quot; plans include a jointly coordinated a nuclear option, intended for other than the general nuclear war situations, principally with Russia but possibly also with China, postulated in OPLAN 8022. Global Strike plans are codified in CONPLAN 8044.

The President, as a member of the National Command Authority, (NCA) may order the use of nuclear weapons. Subsequent to the President&#x27;s decision, the release of nuclear weapons is governed by the two-man rule at all times. All military personnel that participate in loading, arming, or firing weapons, as well as transmitting launch orders, are subject to the Personnel Reliability Program (PRP). 

If the NCA decides that the United States must launch nuclear weapons, the decision is communicated to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) and through him to the National Military Command Center (often called the &quot;war room&quot;) via the Presidential Emergency Satchel, informally referred to as the &quot;football.&quot; Inside the football is a black book listing a menu of strike options and &quot;The Biscuit,&quot; a 3-by-5-inch card with authentication codes for the president to confirm his identity. The menu of strike options include Major Attack Options (MAOs), Selected Attack Options (SAOs), and Limited Attack Options (LAOs). Individual countries or regions can be included in or withheld from nuclear attacks depending on circumstances.

To communicate the order, the CJCS, or, in his absence, the senior officer in the NMCC verifies the President&#x27;s identity with a &quot;challenge code&quot; and the President responds with the corresponding authentication code from the biscuit. Additionally, the message will go to the Alternate National Military Command Center (ANMCC), located in Raven Rock Mountain, Pennsylvania, and also to an airborne command post, either the presidential National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) or the military E-6 Mercury Looking Glass. If the NMCC is destroyed by a first strike, either the ANMCC, NAOC or Looking Glass can issue the orders to execute the SIOP.

The senior NMCC officer directs preparation of the launch order in the form of an Emergency War Order (EWO) – a message that contains the chosen war plan, time to launch, authentication codes and codes needed to unlock the missiles before firing them. A second officer will validate that order. The order is then broadcast to each worldwide command and directly to launch crews by releasing an Emergency Action Message (EAM) which is an encoded and encrypted message about 150 characters long.

As the orders go down the chain of command, always subject to the two-man rule, intermediate headquarters, and eventually the nuclear delivery platforms themselves, will receive Emergency Action Messages (EAM) to arm or launch weapons. For most modern weapons, the EAM will also include codes for Permissive Action Links (PAL). At a minimum, a PAL code will actually arm a weapon for release. The circuitry controlling the PAL is deliberately positioned inside the warhead such that it cannot be reached without disabling the weapon, at a minimum, to a level that would require a full factory-level rebuild. There may be separate PAL codes for arming and launch. Some weapons have &quot;dial-a-yield&quot; functions that allow the power of the nuclear explosion to be adjusted from minimum to maximum yield. Most weapons have additional arming circuitry that, even if a valid launch code is entered, will not arm the warhead unless the weapon senses that it has been released on an expected delivery path. For example, the first steps of the final arming process for a ballistic missile depend on physical characteristics of the weapon release, such as the acceleration of a rocket launch, zero-gravity coasting, and various physical aspects of hypersonic reentry into the atmosphere. A gravity bomb dropped from an aircraft will detect the altitude of release and the decreasing altitude as it falls.

Journalist Ron Rosenbaum has pointed out that the SIOP is entirely concerned with the identity of the commanding officer and the authenticity of the order, and there are no safeguards to verify that the person issuing the order is actually sane. &quot;The president has supreme authority to decide whether to use America&#x27;s nuclear weapons. Period. Full stop,&quot; says the Arms Control Association&#x27;s Kingston Reif. A president could only be stopped by mutiny, he explained, and more than one person would have to disobey the president&#x27;s orders. Notably, Major Harold Hering was eventually forced out of the Air Force for asking during his missile training course how he could know that an order to launch his missiles was &quot;lawful,&quot; that it came from a sane president, one who wasn&#x27;t &quot;imbalance[d]&quot; or &quot;berserk.&quot;

==United Kingdom participation==
Although after World War II the formal military alliance between the United States and United Kingdom no longer existed, American postwar war plans required using British air bases until the United States developed ICBMs and long-range bombers. American General Carl Spaatz and Chief of the Air Staff Lord Tedder informally agreed in 1946 to US aircraft using British bases. The discussions, and the subsequent actions such as extending runways, were so secret that it is unclear whether Prime Minister Clement Attlee was aware of them. By 1948, the year of the Berlin Blockade, British leaders expected that &quot;in a future world conflict, US and British forces will find themselves fighting side by side&quot; although the alliance had not been formally renewed. The two countries began coordinating their plans for a Soviet attack in Europe after the Czechoslovak coup d&#x27;état of 1948, and later that year LeMay, as head of SAC, asked Tedder to allow the basing of American atomic weapons in Britain. By the end of 1948, several British bases were atomic-capable or were close to being so, but the ability to fight an atomic war from Britain did not exist until April 1949 when Silverplate B-29 bombers began rotating through the bases, and no American atomic weapons were present in Britain until 1952.

Aware that with or without bombs, the bases made Britain what Winston Churchill called a &quot;bull&#x27;s-eye&quot; for Soviet attack, he and other British leaders made repeated unsuccessful attempts to learn details of American war plans, and not until 1951 did the United States formally, if vaguely, agree to consult with Britain before using atomic weapons based there. As Tedder complained during the Berlin crisis, when war at any moment seemed possible, the defense of the West relied &quot;on the use of a weapon about which we in fact know very little&quot;. British plans such as SPEEDWAY, which discussed American-British-Canadian joint planning for the early part of a war over the next 18 months, likely incorporated some information informally sent by the United States, including projections on future bomb production and targets. The Chiefs of Staff Committee was dissatisfied, however, writing that &quot;We are at a disadvantage in that ... we do not know the details of the number of [American] atomic weapons to be used and so cannot assess with any accuracy the results that can be achieved.&quot;

The United States preferred that Britain not develop atomic weapons at all. Because of the American fear of the USSR obtaining British atomic technology after conquering the country, in February 1949 Eisenhower offered to General William Duthie Morgan American atomic weapons if the British nuclear weapons program ended. Britain would have used the weapons in its own aircraft for its own targets, but refused the offer, and the United States decided that partnership was preferable to losing influence with the United Kingdom. The British sought an independent, domestic nuclear deterrent that by itself could persuade the USSR to not attack, in part because they feared that America might not be willing to defend Europe with its nuclear missiles once the USSR could attack the United States itself, or during wartime not prioritize targets that threatened the United Kingdom. In 1950 RAF Bomber Command asked for, and received, 70 B-29s from the United States after offering to place them under the control of SAC during wartime. The bombers were becoming obsolete, however. The British never made them nuclear-capable, and the RAF refused the US&#x27;s request for SAC&#x27;s complete targeting control over the sophisticated British-built V bombers which began deploying in 1955. Britain&#x27;s goal of an independent deterrent aimed at Soviet cities was so important that, when it offered to place the V Bombers under SACEUR authority in 1953 in exchange for American financial aid to purchase new fighters, it refused to agree to them being used in a tactical role against Soviet targets in Europe. The agreement permitted Britain to commit only nominal forces to SACEUR, and presaged future technology and targeting cooperation.

As the USAF began in 1955 helping the RAF to convert V bombers to carry American atomic weapons under Project E and hydrogen weapons under Project X, cooperation increased and the United States began sharing some war plan details. Although both nations remained reluctant to fully share their plans—as late as 1956, Britain did not have targeting information even for SAC aircraft it hosted—redundancies were eliminated by one side asking the other whether it planned to attack various targets. In February 1959, the USAF agreed to target 150 Soviet bases that threatened Britain with nuclear weapons, while V bombers would use nuclear weapons to attack Soviet air defenses before SAC arrived. The RAF retained a separate plan to attack 30 Soviet cities with hydrogen bombs. The agreement formed the basis for the ongoing nuclear-targeting cooperation between the two countries, and the different target types resembled the two nations&#x27; different priorities during the Combined Bomber Offensive of World War II. The Anglo-American dispute during the 1956 Suez Crisis only briefly disrupted the partnership, and the desire to restore relations to their former level, and the Sputnik crisis, increased American willingness to help Britain improve its atomic weaponry. In March 1957 the United States agreed to sell 60 Thor IRBMs, in 1958 American hydrogen-weapon designs, in 1960 the Skybolt ALBM, and after its cancellation the Polaris SLBM in 1962 as replacement. Polaris was especially notable; British officials initially refused to believe the Americans&#x27; offer of state-of-the-art submarine missiles at a moderate price, and one scholar later called it &quot;amazing&quot;.

While its contribution to SIOP was minor compared to the enormous SAC arsenal of 1,600 bombers and 800 missiles, as RAF officers who worked with the Americans rose to leadership positions their experience benefited later partnerships between the two countries. The joint targeting plan changed over time; the 1962 list for the RAF included 48 cities, six air-defense sites, and three bomber bases, and the 1963 list had 16 cities, 44 airfields and other offensive sites, 10 air-defense sites, and 28 IRBM sites. The degree of cooperation was such by the Cuban Missile Crisis that RAF officers visiting SAC headquarters in Nebraska reported being &quot;treated just like Americans. We went all through their briefings, computers, top secret rooms and so forth&quot;. While some British officers emphasized the continuing importance of maintaining the ability to act alone with an independent deterrent if necessary, by 1962 the independent list was essentially the RAF portion of the joint plan and no active training was done. The British emphasis on retaining an independent capability, however, continued over several decades and changes in government. As the Defence Council stated in 1980,

While current United Kingdom&#x27;s nuclear forces—four Trident s—are strictly under UK national control, they had two distinct roles under the SIOP. The first was part of a UK-only retaliatory response to a nuclear attack, whether a full strategic strike, or a limited tactical strike. The second role was one in which the Royal Navy participated in the SIOP, in effect becoming an extension of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Trident submarines. This role was to be part of a NATO response to a Soviet nuclear strike. The Royal Navy&#x27;s contribution to the SIOP was small. The four &quot;Vanguard&quot; submarines could strike a maximum of 512 separate targets; equivalent to 7% of the total U.S. nuclear strike capacity.

==SIOP in fiction==
* In Dale Brown&#x27;s novel &quot;Plan of Attack&quot;, it is revealed that Patrick McLanahan is one of the most highly valued personnel in the U.S. military because of his involvement in classified projects and knowledge of the American SIOP. However, because of McLanahan&#x27;s involvement in controversial highly classified military actions, President Thorn largely ignores this fact and the warning of an imminent Russian attack until Russia launches a nuclear campaign against the US.
* In Eric L. Harry&#x27;s novel &quot;Arc Light&quot;, the President decides to execute &quot;SIOP 6-C&quot; in a counterforce strike against Russia after a Russian general gained control of the nuclear codes and launched a massive attack against the US. In the book, &quot;SIOP 6-C&quot; had six thousand nuclear warheads assigned to be used, some of which were held in reserve.
* In William Prochnau&#x27;s novel &quot;Trinity&#x27;s Child&quot;, a Soviet nuclear sneak attack triggers US retaliation. There is discussion of SIOP among the unnamed US President, the military commander codenamed Alice on board the SAC Looking Glass aircraft who is advising the President, who has just been sworn in aboard Air Force One, and the President&#x27;s primary military advisor. After the destruction of cities on both sides, Alice and the original President battle those on board Air Force One for control of the American missile submarine fleet. At stake is the expectation that launch of the Tridents as well as Soviet retaliation will raise the total death toll into the billions.
* In &quot;What Ifs? of American History&quot;, edited by Robert Cowley, one essay (&quot;The Cuban Missile Crisis: Second Holocaust&quot;, by Robert L. O&#x27;Connell) outlines a scenario where the Cuban Missile Crisis leads, via miscalculations, incompetence, and trigger-happiness on both sides, to a two-day thermonuclear war, with horrific results in terms of both overkill and long-term effects on the world.
* In Tom Clancy&#x27;s novel &quot;Without Remorse&quot;, the US intelligence community learns that US Air Force Colonel Robin Zacharias, shot down over Vietnam and reported killed in action by the Vietnamese, is in fact alive and being held in a prisoner-of-war camp. He is being debriefed by a Russian military intelligence officer and there is particular concern because Zacharias has been involved in strategic war plans and has knowledge of the SIOP.
* In Tom Clancy&#x27;s novel &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot;, is sailing in the Mediterranean when a nuclear bomb explodes in Denver. In response, the President orders DEFCON-2 for strategic forces and DEFCON-3 for the conventional ones. The crew&#x27;s response to various perceived Soviet threats that arise after the alert is quite severe because supposedly by virtue of their geographic location they are now &quot;part of SIOP&quot; and so different, more aggressive rules of engagement apply (DEFCON-2 instead of DEFCON-3).
* In Eric Swedin&#x27;s work &quot;When Angels Wept&quot;, the Cuban Missile Crisis turns into a war and after the death of President Kennedy, President Johnson orders the execution of SIOP-63, resulting in the destruction of the Communist Bloc (Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China).
* The movie &quot;WarGames&quot; involves eliminating the SIOP and placing the decision into the hands of a supercomputer, after a surprise drill sees one member of the two-man crew in a Minuteman ICBM Launch Control Facility refuses to follow orders to &quot;launch&quot; missiles. The computer is later led into a launch sequence, but since it is not given the proper launch codes, it begins a brute-force attack to determine the missile codes. After going to DEFCON 1, the computer realizes that war is futile, and ceases to follow its own attack.
