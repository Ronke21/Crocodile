<text>The 29th Infantry Division (29th ID), also known as the &quot;Blue and Gray Division&quot;, is an infantry division of the United States Army based at Fort Belvoir in Fairfax County, Virginia. The division is currently a formation of the Army National Guard and includes units from Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, and West Virginia.

Formed in 1917, the division deployed to France as a part of the American Expeditionary Force during World War I. It was called up for service again during World War II. The division&#x27;s 116th Regiment, attached to the First Infantry Division, was the first wave of troops ashore during Operation Overlord, the landings in Normandy, France. It supported a special Ranger unit tasked with clearing strong points at Omaha Beach. The rest of the 29th ID came ashore later, then advanced to Saint-Lô, and eventually through France and into Germany.

Following the end of World War II, the division saw frequent reorganizations and deactivations. The 29th did not see combat through most of the five decades, but it participated in numerous training exercises throughout the world.

In the 1990s, it was deployed to Bosnia (SFOR10) and Kosovo (KFOR) as command elements and units of the division continue to deploy to locations such as Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and to the War in Afghanistan as a part of the Global War on Terrorism&#x27;s Operation Enduring Freedom, and to the Iraq War as a part of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn. The division has continued answering the call supporting Operation Spartan Shield in forward deployed locations.

In 2016, two separate elements of the 29th deployed overseas. In July 2016, over 80 soldiers deployed in support of Operation Inherent Resolve, a U.S. government military campaign against Islamic State militants.

In October 2019, over 450 29th soldiers deployed in support of Operation Spartan Shield.

The division most recently deployed to Kuwait for its second Task Force Spartan rotation in 2021. From Kuwait, staff officers from 29ID Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion coordinated the rescue of approximately 11,000 refugees from Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover of the nation.

==History==
===World War I===
The 29th Division was constituted on paper on 18 July 1917, three months after the American entry into World War I, in the National Guard. Troops came from Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.

As the division was composed of men from states that had units that fought for both the North and South during the American Civil War, it was nicknamed the &quot;Blue and Gray&quot; division, after the blue uniforms of the Union and the gray uniforms of the Confederate armies. The division was organized as a unit on 25 August 1917 at Camp McClellan, Alabama. In January 1918, the Delaware units were relieved from assignment to the division.
The division, commanded throughout its existence by Major General Charles G. Morton, departed for the Western Front in June 1918 to join the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF). The division&#x27;s advance detachment reached Brest, France on 8 June. In late September, the 29th received orders to join the U.S. First Army&#x27;s Meuse–Argonne offensive as part of the French XVII Corps.

During its 21 days in combat, the 29th Division advanced seven kilometers, captured 2,148 prisoners, and knocked out over 250 machine guns or artillery pieces. Thirty percent of the division were casualties in the war, including 170 officers and 5,691 enlisted men were killed or wounded. Shortly thereafter the Armistice with Germany was signed on 11 November 1918, ending hostilities between the Central Powers and the Allied Powers. The division returned to the United States in May 1919. It demobilized on 30 May at Camp Dix, New Jersey,

===Interwar period===

In accordance with the National Defense Act of 1920, the division was allotted to the states of Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, and assigned to the III Corps in 1921. The division headquarters was reorganized and federally recognized on 31 July 1923 at Washington, D.C. The designated mobilization training center for the “Blue and Gray” Division was Fort Eustis, Virginia. Units from New Jersey that were part of the 29th Division in World War I were assigned to the new 44th Division, which encompassed troops from New Jersey and New York. As a result, the 57th Infantry Brigade and 104th Engineer Regiment went to the 44th Division, while the newly constituted 91st Infantry Brigade and 121st Engineer Regiment were assigned the 29th Division. When 155 mm howitzers were returned to infantry divisions beginning in 1929, a formerly non-divisional unit from Pennsylvania was assigned to the division.

From 1922 to 1936, the division&#x27;s subordinate units held separate summer camps at locations within their respective states: Camp Albert C. Ritchie, near Cascade, Maryland, for Maryland and District of Columbia units, the Virginia Beach State Military Reservation at Virginia Beach, Virginia, for Virginia units, and the target range in Monroe and Wayne Counties, Pennsylvania, near Tobyhanna, for the artillery units. The division staff, composed of personnel from all four states, came together to conduct joint training most summers before World War II. The division staff&#x27;s summer training periods were conducted most years at Camp Ritchie, Virginia Beach, or Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. The headquarters also participated in several corps area and army-level command post exercises (CPXs) during the interwar years. However, the first time the majority of the division&#x27;s subordinate units had the chance to operate together came in June 1935 during the portion of the First Army maneuvers held at Indiantown Gap Military Reservation, Pennsylvania.

Unfortunately, the 91st Infantry Brigade and the 121st Engineers did not attend the maneuver. The poliomyelitis epidemic which had developed in Virginia that summer prompted the governor of Pennsylvania to refuse the brigade&#x27;s entry into the state. The next opportunity to train as one unit came in August 1939 when the entire division was assembled at Manassas, Virginia, for the Third Corps Area concentration of the First Army maneuvers. In that maneuver, the “Blue and Gray” Division operated as part of the provisional III Corps. For the additional week&#x27;s training directed by the War Department for all National Guard units that winter, the Virginia elements of the 29th Division assembled 12–18 November 1939 at Virginia Beach, while the Maryland and District of Columbia elements assembled at Camp Ritchie. The final division training event before induction came in August 1940 when the 29th Division participated in the First Army maneuvers near Canton, New York. The division again operated as part of the III Corps against the provisional I Corps. The division was relieved from the III Corps on 30 December 1940 and assigned to the II Corps.

===World War II===
At the outbreak of World War II, the U.S. Army began the buildup and reorganization of its fighting forces. The division was called into active service on 3 February 1941. Elements of the division were then sent to Fort Meade, Maryland for training. The 58th and 88th Infantry Brigades were inactivated as part of an army-wide removal of brigades from divisions. Instead, the core units of the division were its three infantry regiments, along with supporting units. On 12 March 1942, over three months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent American entrance into World War II, with this reorganization complete the division was redesignated as the 29th Infantry Division and began preparing for overseas deployment to Europe.

In May 1942, the 37th Infantry Division had been alerted for movement to England, and sent its 112th Engineer Combat Battalion ahead as part of the advance party. Orders were changed, and the 37th was diverted for service in the Pacific Theater. There was no time to recall the 112th, or to find and assign a new battalion. The War Department instead ordered the 121st Engineer Combat Battalion, less five officers and 120 men, moved from Fort Meade to Fort Indiantown Gap, and the unit was redesignated the 117th Engineer Combat Battalion and assigned to the 37th Infantry Division. Around the cadre of five officers and 120 men, in addition to Selective Service fillers sent from Fort Hayes, Ohio, and Fort Devens, Massachusetts, a new 121st Engineer Combat Battalion was organized.

The 29th Infantry Division, under the command of Major General Leonard Gerow, was sent to England on 5 October 1942 on . It was based throughout England and Scotland, where it immediately began training for an invasion of northern Europe across the English Channel. In May 1943 the division moved to the Devon–Cornwall peninsula and started conducting simulated attacks against fortified positions. At this time the division was assigned to V Corps of the U.S. First Army. In July the divisional commander, Major General Gerow, was promoted to command V Corps and Major General Charles Hunter Gerhardt assumed command of the division, remaining in this post for the rest of the war.

====Operation Overlord====
D-Day of Operation Neptune, the cross-channel invasion of Normandy, finally came on 6 June 1944. Neptune was the assault phase of the larger Operation Overlord, codename for the Allied campaign to liberate France from the Germans. The 29th Infantry Division sent the 116th Infantry to support the western flank of the veteran 1st Infantry Division&#x27;s 16th Infantry at Omaha Beach.

Omaha was known to be the most difficult of the five landing beaches, due to its rough terrain and bluffs overlooking the beach, which had been well fortified by its German defenders of the 352nd Infantry Division. The 116th Infantry was assigned four sectors of the beach; Easy Green, Dog Red, Dog White, and Dog Green. Soldiers of the 29th Infantry Division boarded a large number of attack transports for the D-Day invasion, among them landing craft, landing ship, tank, and landing ship, infantry ships and other vessels such as the , , and USS &quot;Buncombe County&quot;.
As the ships were traveling to the beach, the heavy seas, combined with the chaos of the fighting caused most of the landing force to be thrown off-course and most of the 116th Infantry missed its landing spots. Most of the regiment&#x27;s tank support, launched from too far off-shore, foundered and sank in the channel. The soldiers of the 116th Infantry were the first to hit the beach at 0630, coming under heavy fire from German fortifications. Company A, from the Virginia National Guard in Bedford, was annihilated by overwhelming fire as it landed on the 116th&#x27;s westernmost section of the beach, along with half of Company A, B, and C of the 2nd Ranger Battalion and the 5th Rangers Battalion which was landing to the west of the 116th. The catastrophic losses suffered by this small Virginia community led to it being selected for the site of the National D-Day Memorial. The 1st Infantry Division&#x27;s forces ran into similar fortifications on the eastern half of the beach, suffering massive casualties coming ashore. By 0830, the landings were called off for lack of space on the beach, as the Americans on Omaha Beach were unable to overcome German fortifications guarding the beach exits.

Lieutenant General Omar Bradley, commanding the American First Army, considered evacuating the survivors and landing the rest of the divisions elsewhere. However, by noon, elements of the American forces had been able to organize and advance off the beach, and the landings resumed. By nightfall, the division headquarters landed on the beach with about 60 percent of the division&#x27;s total strength and began organizing the push inland. On 7 June, a second wave of 20,000 reinforcements from both the 1st and 29th Divisions was sent ashore. By the end of D-Day, 2,400 men from the two divisions had become casualties on Omaha Beach. Added to casualties at other beaches and air-drops made the total casualties for the Normandy landings 6,500 Americans and 3,000 British and Canadians, lighter numbers than expected.
The entire division had landed in Normandy by 7 June. By 9 June, Omaha Beach was secure and the division occupied Isigny. On 14 July, the division was reassigned to XIX Corps, part of the First Army, itself part of the 12th Army Group.

====Breakout====

The division cut across the Elle River and advanced slowly toward Saint-Lô, fighting bitterly in the Normandy hedgerow country. German reserves formed a new defensive front outside the town, and American forces fought a fierce battle with them two miles outside of the town. German forces used the dense bocage foliage to their advantage, mounting fierce resistance in house-to-house fighting in the ravaged Saint-Lô. By the end of the fight, the Germans were relying on artillery support to hold the town following the depletion of the infantry contingent. The 29th Division, which was already undermanned after heavy casualties on D-Day, was even further depleted in the intense fighting for Saint-Lô. Eventually, the 29th was able to capture the city in a direct assault, supported by airstrikes from P-47 Thunderbolts.

====Brittany====
After taking Saint-Lô, on 18 July, the division joined in the battle for Vire, capturing that strongly held city by 7 August. It continued to face stiff German resistance as it advanced to key positions southeast of Saint-Lô It was then reassigned to V Corps, and then again to VIII Corps. Turning west, the 29th took part in the assault on Brest which lasted from 25 August until 18 September.

====Germany====
After a short rest, the division returned to XIX Corps and took part in the Battle of Aachen by moving to defensive positions along the Teveren-Geilenkirchen line supporting the 30th Infantry Division in Germany and maintained those positions through October. On 16 November, the division began its drive to the Roer River, blasting its way through Siersdorf, Setterich, Durboslar, and Bettendorf, and reaching the Roer by the end of the month. Heavy fighting reduced in Jülich Sportplatz and the Hasenfeld Gut on 8 December. The Division did not take part in the Battle of the Bulge as they were held in reserve for equipment refitting and received replacements of fresh troops arriving from England and France after training for weeks.

From 8 December 1944 to 23 February 1945, the division was assigned to XIII Corps and held defensive positions along the Rur and prepared for the next major offensive, Operation Grenade. The division was reassigned to XIX Corps, and the attack jumped off across the Rur on 23 February and carried the division through Jülich, Broich, Immerath, and Titz, to Mönchengladbach by 1 March 1945. The division was out of combat in March. In early April the division was reassigned to XVI Corps, where the 116th Infantry helped mop up in the Ruhr Pocket. On 19 April 1945 the division, assigned to XIII Corps, pushed to the Elbe River and held defensive positions until 4 May and also made contact with Soviet troops. Meanwhile, the 175th Infantry cleared the Klotze Forest. After V-E Day, the division was on military occupation duty in the Bremen enclave. It was assigned to XVI Corps again for this assignment.

====Losses, decorations, demobilization====
*Total battle casualties: 20,620
*Killed in action: 3,887
*Wounded in action: 15,541
*Missing in action: 347
*Prisoner of war: 845

From July 1943, the 29th Infantry Division was commanded by Major General Charles H. Gerhardt. The division suffered the second-most battle casualties of any American division in the European Theater (after the 4th Infantry Division&#x27;s 22,660), and it was said that Gerhardt actually commanded three divisions: one on the field of battle, one in the hospital, and one in the cemetery. The 29th Infantry Division lost 3,887 men killed in action, 15,541 wounded in action (899 of whom died of their wounds), 347 missing in action (315 of whom were returned to military control alive), 845 prisoners of war (six of whom died in captivity), in addition to 8,665 non-combat casualties, during 242 days of combat. This amounted to over 200 percent of the division&#x27;s normal strength. The division, in turn, took 38,912 German prisoners of war.

Soldiers of the 29th Infantry Division were awarded five Medals of Honor, 44 Distinguished Service Crosses, one Distinguished Service Medal, 854 Silver Star Medals, 17 Legion of Merit Medals, 24 Soldier&#x27;s Medals, 6,308 Bronze Star Medals, and 176 Air Medals during the conflict. The division itself was awarded four distinguished unit citations and four campaign streamers for the conflict.

The division remained on occupation duty until the end of 1945. Camp Grohn near Bremen was the division headquarters until January 1946. The 29th Infantry Division returned to the United States in January 1946 and was demobilized and inactivated on 17 January 1946 at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey.

===Reactivation===
On 23 October 1946, the division was reactivated in Norfolk, Virginia. However, its subordinate elements were not fully manned and activated for several years. It resumed its National Guard status, seeing weekend and summer training assignments but no major contingencies over the next few years.

In 1959, the division was reorganized under the Pentomic five battle group division organization. Ewing&#x27;s &quot;29th Infantry Division: A Short History of a Fighting Division&quot; says that several Maryland infantry and engineer companies were reorganized to form 1st Med Tank Bn, 115th Armor; the 29th Aviation Company was established; and the 1st Reconnaissance Squadron, 183rd Armor, was established in Virginia as the division&#x27;s reconnaissance squadron.
In 1963, the division was reorganized in accordance with the Reorganization Objective Army Divisions plan, eliminating its regimental commands in favor of brigades. The division took command of the 1st Brigade, 29th Infantry Division and 2nd Brigade, 29th Infantry Division of the Virginia Army National Guard, as well as the 3rd Brigade, 29th Infantry Division of the Maryland Army National Guard. The division continued its service in the National Guard under this new organization.

In 1968, in the middle of the Vietnam War, the Army inactivated several National Guard and Reserve divisions as part of a realignment of resources. The 29th Infantry Division was one of the divisions inactivated. During that time, the division&#x27;s subordinate units were reassigned to other National Guard divisions. 1st Brigade was inactivated, while 2nd Brigade was redesignated as the 116th Infantry Brigade, and the 3rd Brigade was redesignated as 3rd Brigade, 28th Infantry Division.

On 6 June 1984, 40 years after the landings on Omaha Beach, the Army announced that it would reactivate the 29th Infantry Division, organized as a light infantry division, as part of a reorganization of the National Guard. On 30 September 1985, the division was reactivated at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, with units from the Virginia Army National Guard (VAARNG) and Maryland Army National Guard (MDARNG). The 116th Infantry Brigade was redesignated the 1st Brigade, 29th Division, while the 58th Infantry Brigade became the 3rd Brigade. That year, the division also received its distinctive unit insignia.

==== Organization 1989 ====

At the end of the Cold War the division was a joint Virginia Army National Guard (VAARNG) and Maryland Army National Guard (MDARNG) unit. Virginia provided the division&#x27;s headquarters, the 1st and 2nd Brigade, the Division Artillery (with one MDARNG artillery battalion) and other minor units, while Maryland provided the 3rd Brigade, Aviation Brigade, 29th Infantry Division (with two VAARNG aviation companies), the Division Support Command (with one VAARNG aviation company) and other minor units.

===Post Cold War===

At the end of the Cold War, the U.S. Army saw further drawdowns and reductions in spending. The 29th Infantry Division was retained, however 2nd Brigade was inactivated in favor of assets from the inactivating 26th Infantry Division, which was redesignated the 26th Brigade, 29th Infantry Division.

The largest National Guard training exercise ever held in Virginia took place in July 1998, bringing units from the 29th Infantry Division together for one large infantry exercise. The Division Maneuver Exercise, dubbed Operation Chindit, brought together Guard units from Virginia and Maryland, as well as Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut and the District of Columbia. The exercise began with the insertion of troops from the 29th Infantry Division&#x27;s 1st and 3rd Brigades by UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters into strategic landing zones. NATO-member forces trained with the 29th Infantry Division throughout the exercise. In December 2008, the division also dispatched a task force to Camp Asaka near Tokyo, Japan for exercises with the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force called Yama Sakura 55, a bilateral exercise simulating an invasion of Japan.

===Present day===
In March 1994, during a time of post-Cold War reductions in the size of the Regular Army, the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment was tasked to test a new concept. The Regiment&#x27;s task was to organize, train, certify, and deploy a multi-component battalion-sized task force made up of National Guard, Army Reserve and Regular Army Soldiers to serve as the US Army&#x27;s rotational Infantry Battalion for the Multi-National Force and Observers (MFO) in the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt. The Soldiers selected for the unit reported to Fort Bragg in North Carolina in July 1994 to begin their training for the mission.

The task force was designated as the 4th Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, and carried the lineage of Company D, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, which had served throughout World War II and into the 1950s. Also known as Task Force 4-505 or &quot;The Sinai Battalion,&quot; it was formally activated on 4 November 1994. The battalion was made up of 88% National Guardsmen and Army Reservists from 32 different states, and 12% Regular Army Soldiers, most from the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg. Virginia and Maryland Army National Guardsmen from the 29th Infantry Division (Light) provided the largest contingent for the battalion. All of the National Guard and Army Reserve Soldiers volunteered for a year of active duty in order to serve in the unit. After completing six months of peacekeeping training at Fort Bragg, the 4th Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment deployed to the Sinai from January through June 1995, then redeployed to Fort Bragg. On 15 July 1995, the 4th Battalion was inactivated at Fort Bragg, and its soldiers returned to their parent units.

Hundreds of soldiers from the 29th Infantry Division completed nine days of training on 16 June 2001 at Fort Polk, Louisiana, to prepare for their peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, as the second division headquarters to be deployed as a part of SFOR 10. In all, 2,085 National Guard soldiers from 16 states from Massachusetts to California served with the multinational force that operated in the US sector, MND-N. Their rotation began in October 2001 and lasted six months.

The 29th Infantry Division completed a two-week warfighter exercise at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in late July 2003. Nearly 1,200 soldiers of the division participated in the training, which was overseen by First United States Army. Also engaged in the simulation war was about 150 soldiers of the New York Army National Guard&#x27;s 42nd Infantry Division. The exercises covered a variety of operations, ranging from large-scale contingencies to airborne and civil affairs operations.

In March 2004, the 3rd Battalion 116th Infantry of 500+ soldiers was mobilized for 579 days in support of Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan. Following a 4-month train up, the battalion deployed to Bagram Air Base Afghanistan where the unit split into two operational elements. One element was stationed at Bagram where they were responsible for near-base security and the theater-north Quick Reaction Force. They executed 5, 10, and 20-kilometer ring patrols to increase force security and stayed ready to react at a moment&#x27;s notice to deploy anywhere in Afghanistan to react to &quot;troops in contact&quot; that requested support. The other element moved south with the Bn Commander to control and shape operations in the Wardak and Ghazni provinces. It was here that the 116th would take its first casualties by enemy contact since World War II. SGT Bobby Beasley and SSG Craig Cherry were killed in an IED attack on a patrol in southern Ghazni near Gilan. Within the first three months, the unit would deploy nearly every soldier around Bagram, and throughout the Wardak and Ghazni provinces during the first Afghan elections in which President Hamid Karzai was elected. The unit would be redeployed back to the United States in July 2005 highly decorated for its efforts during its mission following hundreds of successful combat patrols and engagements.

In 2005, 350 veterans, politicians, and soldiers representing the division went to Normandy and Paris, in France for the 60th anniversary of the D-Day landings. The Army National Guard organized a major ceremony for the 60th anniversary, as many of the veterans who participated in the invasion were in their 80s at that time, and the 60th anniversary was seen as the last major anniversary of the landings in which a large number of veterans could take part.

The division underwent a major reorganization in 2006. A special troops battalion was added to the division&#x27;s command structure, and its three brigades were redesignated. It as organized around three brigades; the 30th Heavy Brigade Combat Team of North Carolina, the 116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team of Virginia, and the Combat Aviation Brigade, 29th Infantry Division of Maryland.

In December 2006, the division took command of the Eastern region of Kosovo&#x27;s peacekeeping force, to provide security in the region. The division&#x27;s soldiers were part of a NATO multi-national task force consisting of units from Ukraine, Greece, Poland, Romania, Armenia and Lithuania under the command of U.S. Army Brigadier General Douglas B. Earhart who concurrently served as the 29th&#x27;s Deputy Commanding General. The division returned to Fort Belvoir in November 2007.

After a three-month pre-deployment train-up at Mississippi&#x27;s Camp Shelby, the 116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team deployed to Kuwait and Iraq in September 2007, as part of the Iraq War&#x27;s Operation Iraqi Freedom, returning home in May 2008.

Approximately 72 Virginia and Maryland National Guard soldiers with the 29th ID were deployed to Afghanistan from December 2010 to October 2011. As part of the 29th ID Security Partnering Team, the Soldiers were assigned to NATO&#x27;s International Security Assistance Force Joint Command Security Partnering Team with the mission of assisting with the growth and development of the Afghan National Security Forces where they served as advisers and mentors to senior Afghan leaders. They were part of a NATO Coalition of 49 troop-contributing nations that Security Partnering personnel interacted with daily across Afghanistan.

They were replaced in November 2011 by a new team from the 29th Infantry Division. A team of 65 29th ID soldiers served in Afghanistan as a Security Partnering Team until July 2012.

The 29th ID suffered one casualty during this deployment. Maj. Robert Marchanti of the Maryland Army National Guard was killed on 25 February 2012.

In 2014 the 29th ID twice sent soldiers to the Joint Multinational Readiness Center in Hohenfels, Germany to assist in the training of U.S. and multinational soldiers preparing to head to Kosovo as part of the Kosovo Force mission. The 29th ID soldiers performed as the KFOR staff, serving as subject matter experts, enforcing KFOR orders, systems and procedures, and working with JMRC to help the deploying troops achieve their training objectives.

The 29th ID currently serves as the Domestic All-Hazards Response Team (DART) in FEMA Regions 1 through 5 (states east of the Mississippi). In this role, the 29th ID is prepared to assist the state National Guard in their service to governors and citizens during an incident response. The DART provides defense support of civil authority capabilities in response to a catastrophic event. The DART conducts joint reception, staging, onward movement and Integration of inbound OPCON forces and establishes base support installations and /or forward operating bases for sustaining operations.

On 24 July 2015, Brig. Gen. Blake C. Ortner took command of the 29th Infantry Division from Maj. Gen. Charles W. Whittington.

On 19 December 2016, the 29th Infantry Division assumed command of U.S. Army Central&#x27;s intermediate division headquarters, Task Force Spartan, at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait. This deployment includes 450 Virginia, Maryland and North Carolina Army National Guard soldiers and is the first time the 29th Infantry Division has been a part of the Third Army since 1944, during WWII.

More than 80 members of the 29th deployed to Jordan in August 2016 where they assumed command of the military&#x27;s joint operations center there to support Operation Inherent Resolve. Soldiers of the 29th led engagements and joint training with the Jordan Armed Forces and allied countries before returning in July 2017.

On 5 May 2018, Brig. Gen. John M. Epperly took command of the 29th Infantry Division from Maj. Gen. Blake C. Ortner. On 3 October 2020, Epperly was succeeded by Maj. Gen. John M. Rhodes.

<text>March of Dimes is a United States nonprofit organization that works to improve the health of mothers and babies. The organization was founded by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1938, as the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, to combat polio. The name &quot;March of Dimes&quot; was coined by Eddie Cantor as a pun on the newsreel series &quot;The March of Time&quot;. After funding Jonas Salk&#x27;s polio vaccine, the organization expanded its focus to the prevention of birth defects and infant mortality. In 2005, as preterm birth emerged as the leading cause of death for children worldwide, research and prevention of premature birth became the organization&#x27;s primary focus.

==Organization ==
March of Dimes improves the health of mothers and babies through five programming areas: medical research, education of pregnant women, community programs, government advocacy, and support of pregnant women and mothers. The organization provides women and families with educational resources on baby health, pregnancy, preconception and new motherhood, as well as supplying information and support to families in the NICU who are affected by prematurity, birth defects, or other infant health problems.

The organization began in 1938 as the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. In 1976 it became known as the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation. In 2007, the formal name became the March of Dimes Foundation.

==Anti-polio efforts==

The group was founded by Franklin D. Roosevelt on January 3, 1938, as a response to U.S. epidemics of polio, a condition that can leave people with permanent physical disabilities. Roosevelt was himself diagnosed with polio in 1921. The foundation was an alliance between scientists and volunteers, with volunteers raising money to support research and education efforts.

The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis was a reconstitution of the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation, which Roosevelt and his friend Basil O&#x27;Connor founded with other friends in 1927. O&#x27;Connor became the foundation&#x27;s president, a position he held for more than three decades. His first task was to create a network of local chapters that could raise money and deliver aid; more than 3,100 county chapters were established during his tenure.

The name &quot;March of Dimes&quot; — a play on the contemporary radio and newsreel series, &quot;The March of Time&quot; — was coined by stage, screen and radio star Eddie Cantor. He inspired a nationwide fundraising campaign in the week preceding President Roosevelt&#x27;s birthday on January 30, 1938. Lapel pins were sold for ten cents (a dime) each; special features were produced by the motion picture studios and radio industry; and nightclubs and cabarets held dances and contributed a portion of the proceeds. As Cantor himself stated, &quot;The March of Dimes will enable all persons, even the children, to show our President that they are with him in this battle against this disease. Nearly everyone can send in a dime, or several dimes. However, it takes only ten dimes to make a dollar and if a million people send only one dime, the total will be $100,000.&quot; Cantor&#x27;s appeal collected only few dimes and donations to begin with; just $17.50 had been sent in to the White House in two days, but what followed was a flood: by January 29, over 80,000 letters with dimes, quarters and dollars poured into the White House mail room so that official correspondence to the president was buried in donation letters, with a final count of 2,680,000 dimes or $268,000 donated in what the press called &quot;a silver tide which actually swamped the White House.&quot; Roosevelt went on the air to express his thanks, saying:

Donald Anderson was the very first &quot;poster child&quot; to raise money for the March of Dimes. He was from Oregon and had been diagnosed with polio in 1943. Photos were taken of Donald in an almost-paralyzed state. Another photo was taken seven months later to show how he had improved after receiving treatment funded by the foundation. His story was meant to show how regular, everyday Americans had helped Donald during his time in the polio ward by donating to the March of Dimes.

The March of Dimes was the title used for the foundation&#x27;s annual fundraising event that requested each child donate a dime. At the Christmas season, booths were set up in cities where the children could drop their dime in a slot. These were out on the street and sometimes not even overseen by anyone. Gradually the name became synonymous with that of the organization.

&quot;His genius was in generating large numbers of relatively small contributions for a cause,&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote of O&#x27;Connor. &quot;Over the years he collected and spent more than seven billion dimes — many of them from schoolchildren — with a half-billion dollars of it going to the war on polio.&quot;
Publisher Gerard Piel credited O&#x27;Connor with a &quot;unique social invention: a permanently self-sustaining source of funds for the support of research — the voluntary health organization.&quot; With a centralized administration, state and local chapters and a large corps of volunteers, the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis became the prototype for dozens of similar foundations.

In 1945, a journalist named Elaine Whitelaw created the women&#x27;s division for the March of Dimes. Her main reason for doing so was to empower women, as primary caregivers, to come together to support the foundation&#x27;s cause. The division&#x27;s very first event was a fashion show in the Waldorf Astoria in New York City, which was a great success and had a large turnout.

Following the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt, there was an entirely new challenge to fighting polio: Hollywood studios decided that the March of Dimes would no longer be allowed to collect donations from movie theater audiences, taking away a great portion of the foundation&#x27;s funding. The foundation realized that his connection to the people, and to polio, was what had made Roosevelt effective at raising funds. The foundation sought a new way to make people feel a connection to polio by reminding families that this disease cripples small children and that mothers, especially, should protect those children. Because Franklin D. Roosevelt founded the March of Dimes, a redesign of the dime was chosen to honor him after his death. The Roosevelt dime was issued in 1946, on what would have been the president&#x27;s 64th birthday.

In 1950, a group of Phoenix women, aware of the urgency of funding shortages at the Maricopa County March of Dimes, created the first Mothers&#x27; March on Polio establishing the model that the national foundation would adopt and spread nationwide starting in 1951. Between 1951 and 1955, contributions to March of Dimes doubled to $250 million, which the organization&#x27;s fundraising department attributed to the nationwide introduction of the Mothers&#x27; March on Polio calling the campaign, &quot;the single greatest activity in the entire March of Dimes.&quot;

From 1938 through the approval of the Salk vaccine in 1955, the foundation spent $233 million on polio patient care, which led to more than 80 percent of U.S. polio patients&#x27; receiving significant foundation aid.

=== Sabin vaccine and conflict with the March of Dimes ===
Around the same time, Albert Sabin (also with funding from the March of Dimes) developed a simpler version of the vaccine, which was based on an attenuated live version of the polio virus. Both Salk&#x27;s version and Sabin&#x27;s version had potential safety concerns; Salk&#x27;s vaccine had the risk of a virus which is not completely inactivated, while Sabin&#x27;s vaccine had the risk of reversion to virulence.

In 1955, a batch of Salk&#x27;s vaccine made by Cutter Laboratories in Berkeley, California was inadequately inactivated and, as a result, 11 children died. After this incident, production methods were changed and no further incidents were reported. Sabin became highly critical of O&#x27;Connor and the March of Dimes, who he believed were biased towards Salk&#x27;s vaccine and made statements inconsistent with the scientific research. In the meantime, trials of the vaccine based on Sabin&#x27;s version were carried out in the Soviet Union with important contributions made by Mikhail Chumakov.

In 1958, the Soviet Union organized industrial production of this vaccine and polio was largely eradicated in Eastern Europe and Japan. This success led to trials in the United States as well and the licensing of Sabin&#x27;s vaccine in 1961, over the considerable opposition of the March of Dimes, which supported Salk&#x27;s vaccine. Eventually, Sabin&#x27;s vaccine superseded Salk&#x27;s vaccine based on its advantages, which included a simpler (oral) administration and lifelong immunity.

==Change of mission ==

Following widespread use of the polio vaccine, the organization was faced with disbanding or steering its resources toward a new mission. Basil O&#x27;Connor, then the organization&#x27;s president, directed his staff to identify strengths and weaknesses and reformulate its mission. The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP) shortened its name to the National Foundation (NF) in 1958 and launched its &quot;Expanded Program&quot; against birth defects, arthritis, and virus diseases, seeking to become a &quot;flexible force&quot; in the field of public health.

In the mid-1960s, the organization focused its efforts on prevention of birth defects and infant mortality, which became its mission. At that time, the cause of birth defects was unknown; only the effects were visible. In 1976, the organization changed its name to the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation. Reducing the toll of premature birth was added as a mission objective in 2005.

==Initiatives after polio==

===Rubella===
Rubella, also called German measles, is associated with a disorder called congenital rubella syndrome, which can cause miscarriages and birth defects such as deafness, blindness and intellectual disability. Vaccination is an effective preventive measure. On behalf of the March of Dimes, Virginia Apgar testified to the United States Senate in 1969 about the importance of federal funding of a rubella immunization program, and the organization funded a vaccine, which was licensed in the early 1970s. In 2006, a statement published in &quot;Birth Defects Research Part A&quot; credited the &quot;remarkable success of the immunization program to eliminate rubella is due to joint efforts by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, various state and local health departments, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and the March of Dimes&quot;.

===Maternal and neonatal care===
In 1976, the March of Dimes published a report titled &quot;Toward Improving the Outcome of Pregnancy&quot; (TIOP), and in 1993 they published &quot;Toward Improving the Outcome of Pregnancy: The 90s and Beyond&quot; (TIOP II). TIOP &quot;stratified maternal and neonatal care into 3 levels of complexity and recommended referral of high-risk patients to centers with the personnel and resources needed for their degree of risk and severity of illness.&quot; TIOP was published when &quot;resources for the most complex care were relatively scarce and concentrated in academic medical centers.&quot; TIOP II updated care complexity designations from levels I, II and III to basic, specialty and subspecialty, and the criteria were expanded.

In 2001, the March of Dimes introduced a family support program for those with babies in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The program seeks to educate NICU staff to communicate effectively with patients&#x27; families. The March of Dimes hosted the Symposium on Quality Improvement to Prevent Prematurity in October 2009. In December 2010, the March of Dimes released TIOP III, subtitled &quot;Enhancing Perinatal Health Through Quality, Safety, and Performance Initiatives&quot;.

====Fetal alcohol syndrome====

Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is categorized as a group of birth defects ranging from mental retardation to various growth and behavioral problems. The March of Dimes has provided grant funding for FAS research, and they supported the National Council on Alcoholism in its push for legislation to bring public attention to the dangers of alcohol use by pregnant women. This led to a 1989 law mandating a warning label about the risk of birth defects that alcoholic beverages still carry today.

====Folic acid====
The March of Dimes has campaigned for public education on folic acid, a vitamin which can prevent neural tube defects such as spina bifida and anencephaly if mothers have enough of it in their body. The March of Dimes has funded polls on folic acid from The Gallup Organization. Analysis of some of the results, said that women aged 18–24 years had the least awareness regarding folic acid consumption or knowledge about when it should be taken. On the issue, the organization partnered with the Grain Foods Foundation, an industry group, in public education efforts.

====Prematurity campaign====

Awareness about preterm birth, which is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes, is an organizational goal. According to an editorial in the May 2004 issue of the &quot;Journal of the National Medical Association&quot;, the original goals of the campaign were to raise awareness of the problem from 35 percent to at least 60 percent and to decrease the rate of premature births by at least 15 percent (from 11.9 percent to 10.1 percent). In 2008, the Prematurity Campaign was extended by the Board of Trustees until 2020, and global targets were set for prematurity prevention. In 2008, the March of Dimes started its annual Premature Birth Report Card, which grades the nation and each individual state on preterm birth rates.

====Newborn screening====
March of Dimes states on its website that it supports mandated newborn screening of all babies in all states in the U.S. for at least 30 life-threatening conditions for which effective treatment and reliable testing are available to prevent catastrophic consequences to the child. 
In 2003, the March of Dimes began releasing an annual, state-by-state report card on each state&#x27;s adoption of expanded newborn screening recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics. March of Dimes president Jennifer L. Howse, Ph.D. has stated that this program is intended to inform parents of the tests available in their state, enabling those with affected babies to pursue early treatment.

According to a presentation at the 2005 annual meeting of the American Public Health Association, individual, state-based March of Dimes chapters work with governors, state legislators, health departments, health professionals, and parents to improve state newborn screening programs and to make comprehensive newborn screening programs available to every newborn throughout the country.

In 2005, only 38 percent of infants were born in states that required screening for 21 or more of 29 core conditions recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics; but by 2009, all 50 states and the District of Columbia required screening for 21 or more of these treatable disorders.

NICU Family Support

March of Dimes introduced the NICU Family Support program in 2001 to provide information and comfort to families during the NICU hospitalization of their newborn and to contribute to NICU staff professional development. Today it operates in 68 hospitals in the United States to serve more than 50,000 families annually. In 2018, March of Dimes released the My NICU Baby app that provides families with information while in the NICU and to help them transition home.

===Global Report on Birth Defects===
The March of Dimes published its Global Report on Birth Defects in 2006, which estimated birth defects&#x27; global burden.

===White paper on prematurity===
In 2009, the March of Dimes partnered with the Department of Reproductive Health and Research of the World Health Organization (RHR/WHO) to publish a white paper on the global and regional toll of preterm birth worldwide. This report, which was the first attempt to identify the global scope of premature births and related infant deaths, found that an estimated 13 million infants worldwide are born premature each year and more than one million of them die in their first month of life. Further, premature births account for 9.6 percent of total births and for 28 percent of newborn deaths. The highest rates of premature birth are in Africa, followed by North America (Canada and the United States combined).

===March for Babies===

Established in 1970, the March for Babies, previously called WalkAmerica, is the largest fundraiser of the year for the March of Dimes, as well as the oldest nationwide charitable walking event. In the decades since, many other organizations have used the walkathon format to help raise money. Funds raised by the event support March of Dimes-sponsored research and other programs to prevent premature birth, birth defects and infant mortality.

According to the March of Dimes, March for Babies is held in more than 900 communities across the nation. Every year, 1 million people—including 20,000 company teams, family teams and national sponsors—participate in the event, which has raised more than $1.8 billion since 1970. The March of Dimes states that seventy-six cents of every dollar raised in March for Babies is spent on research and programs to help prevent premature birth, birth defects and infant mortality.

The first person to walk for the March of Dimes was John Harrison Finger, a textile worker in High Point, North Carolina. In 1948, his daughter came home from school and asked for a donation for the polio fund. Finger replied that he did not have the money but that he would raise some. In what is thought to be the first walkathon in March of Dimes history, Finger walked 32 miles — round trip from High Point to Greensboro — and collected a total of $1,700 in a red wagon he pulled behind him. During his lifetime he walked more than 1,000 miles and raised $15,832 to benefit the charity. The March of Dimes formally created its nationwide WalkAmerica drive in 1971, and Finger was named &quot;Mr. WalkAmerica&quot; in 1983.

===Sounds of Pertussis===
Once rare in the United States, cases of pertussis (whooping cough) are appearing across the country with greater frequency. To address this issue, the March of Dimes and Sanofi Pasteur launched a national education campaign in 2010 called &quot;Sounds of Pertussis&quot; to raise awareness about the seriousness of pertussis and the need for adult vaccination to prevent infecting babies. NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon is a national spokesperson for the campaign. The campaign recently sponsored a song-writing contest called Sound Off About Pertussis, which was won by Maria Bennett with her original song, &quot;Give Pertussis a Whooping.&quot;

===Healthy Babies are Worth the Wait===
To combat the state&#x27;s high prematurity levels, in 2007, the March of Dimes, the Johnson &amp; Johnson Pediatric Institute, and the Kentucky Department for Public Health partnered with six Kentucky hospitals to launch &quot;Healthy Babies Are Worth the Wait,&quot; a health promotion and prematurity prevention initiative intended to reduce the rate of preventable preterm births in targeted areas of Kentucky. Kentucky was chosen as a pilot due to an elevated preterm birth rate greater than the national average that had been steadily increasing over the past few years, its predisposition to adjustable risk factors such as smoking and nutrition, and the commitment and dedication of community leaders. In 2007–2009, the trial programs saw a 6.5% reduction in preterm birth rates. The success of the program in the State of Kentucky led to the development of similar initiatives in New Jersey, Texas, New York, Kansas, and Illinois with upcoming sites in Florida and California.

The primary goal of Healthy Babies Are Worth the Wait is a 15 percent reduction in the rate of singleton (one baby) preterm births in these targeted areas through increasing knowledge and education regarding factors that increase the risks of preterm birth, influencing change in health care settings and creating new advancements in preventing preterm and low-birth-weight births. Other strategic goals include improving access to prenatal services and lowering the rate of early elective deliveries done before 39 weeks gestation.

The Healthy Babies are Worth the Wait initiative was developed based on five core concepts: Partnerships and collaborations, Provider initiatives, Patient support, Public engagement, and Progress measurement. The program encourages providers to educate patients on the risk factors and prevention methods for preterm births, inform women of childbearing age of the challenges of delivering prematurely, and distribute public information regarding the costs of prematurity on society ($26 million annually).

Program initiatives and services include progesterone shots given to pregnant women with histories of preterm births, encouraging folic acid usage and stress management during pregnancy, and developing strategies to eliminate cesarean deliveries and inductions before 39 week&#x27;s gestation unless medically necessary. The program was implemented as a Best Practice in the Association of Maternal &amp; Child Health Programs (AMCHP) in 2015.

===Perinatal Data Center===
The March of Dimes Perinatal Data Center includes the PeriStats Web site, which provides free access to U.S., state, county, and city maternal and infant health data.

==Legislation supported==
*PREEMIE Reauthorization Act (S. 252; 113th Congress) – a bill that would reauthorize research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention related to preterm birth and take other actions to improve infant mortality rates.
*Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2013 (H.R. 1281; 113th Congress) – a bill that would amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize grant programs and other initiatives to promote expanded screening of newborns and children for heritable disorders. The March of Dimes described the bill as reauthorizing &quot;critical federal activities that assist states in improving and expanding their newborn screening programs, supporting parents and provider newborns screening education, and ensuring laboratory quality and surveillance.&quot;
*State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program reauthorization – a bill that supported the continuation of the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), a program that provides health insurance to 11 million low-income children and pregnant women. In 2007 and 2009, March of Dimes partnered with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the National Association of Children&#x27;s Hospitals (NACH) on the issue.

==Notable staff==
Virginia Apgar, M.D., the creator of the Apgar Score, joined the March of Dimes in 1959 and eventually served as vice president for medical affairs.

==Criticism and controversy==

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has raised concerns about the March of Dimes funding medical research which involves cruelty to animals.

In his book &quot;Essentials of Sociology: A Down-to-Earth Approach&quot;, sociologist Professor James M. Henslin describes March of Dimes as a bureaucracy that has taken on a life of its own through a classic example of a process called goal displacement. Faced with redundancy after Jonas Salk developed the polio vaccine, it adopted a new mission, &quot;fighting birth defects&quot;, which was recently changed to a vaguer goal of &quot;breakthrough for babies&quot;, rather than disbanding.

 Charity Navigator, an organization that attempts to quantify the effectiveness of charities, has given the organization a rating of three stars (out of four) stating, &quot;This charity&#x27;s score is 85%, earning it a Three-Star rating. If this organization aligns with your passions and values, you can give with confidence.&quot; Historical ratings in the listing for the nonprofit shows that the rating was usually 2 stars out of 4 from 2003 to 2022 (with a few years it being 1 star); however, it also states that, &quot;The historic rating mainly reflects a version of today’s Accountability and Finance score&quot;.

 with respect to CEO salary, and the salaries of top paid employees, Charity Navigator has a listing called &quot;Salary of Key Persons&quot; with CEO Stacey D. Stewart&#x27;s coming in at $607,033. In prior years, Charity Navigator would publish a study of CEO compensation, but appears to no longer do so.

<doc id="859951" wikidata="Q2815847" url="?curid=859951" title="2nd Field Artillery Regiment (Canada)">
<text>The 2nd Field Artillery Regiment, RCA () is a Royal Canadian Artillery reserve regiment. It is located in Montreal and shares its headquarters with The Royal Canadian Hussars (Montreal) at the Côte-des-Neiges Armory.

Although there had been temporary volunteer artillery units formed in Montreal as early as 1828, the regiment has its origin in the 3rd Montreal Battery formed in 1855 as a result of the departure of British regular troops for the Crimean War and the passage of the Militia Act of 1855. Militia forces, including the five field batteries formed, would for the first time be maintained at public expense. In 1856 the Battalion of Montreal Artillery was formed and in 1895 it was renamed the 2nd &quot;Montreal&quot; Regiment, CA.

==War in Europe==
In the First World War several batteries of artillery were raised in Montreal and the 2nd Brigade included the 3rd Montreal Battery amongst its four batteries. During the war, the unit took part in every action of the 1st Canadian Division and later on the Canadian Corps. In a series of reorganizations the battery was renamed the 7th Field Battery, the name it continues to hold. This battery was commanded at the outbreak of the war by Major Andrew McNaughton. Wounded at the 2nd Battle of Ypres, he went on to command the Canadian Corps Heavy Artillery and, in the Second World War, the First Canadian Army. The 2nd Brigade served in the divisional artillery of the 1st Canadian Division for the duration of the war.

In the Second World War the 2nd Field Regiment was once again mobilized in the divisional artillery of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division and consisted of the 7th, the 8th, and 10th Field Batteries RCA. After training in England it served in Italy from July 1943 until January 1945 when it, along with I Canadian Corps, was transferred to Holland.

After the Second World War the regiments of artillery in the post-war Militia were renumbered and the 2nd Field Regiment was removed from the order of battle. Reorganization after the 1964 Suttie Commission and the ensuing Militia unit reductions eventually saw the 2nd Field Regiment reforming in 1966 with initially two and then three batteries. They were the 7th, 50th, and 66th Field Batteries, each perpetuating a different regiment of the post-war artillery in Montreal.

== Twenty-first century ==
On April 29, 2000, the regiment was awarded Freedom of the City of Montreal in recognition of its historical link to the city. Then in 2007 the city of Terrebonne also awarded the regiment the same courtesy.

Today, it is primarily made up of reservists from the city of Montreal as part of the Canadian Army Reserves. After over 50 years of peacetime operations, the regiment fields only a single artillery battery of six 105 mm C3 howitzers. It has sent its members abroad to serve in peacekeeping and anti-terrorist roles and has yearly gunnery exercises.

The regiment is commanded by a Canadian Reserve lieutenant-colonel, with a new commanding officer appointed, on average, every three years. The regiment is officially bilingual and functions in both English and French. The commanding officers of the re-formed 2nd Field Regiment are listed:

*1966–1969 – LCol J.H.E. Day, CD
*1969–1970 – LCol W.L.M. Cloutier, CD
*1970–1973 – LCol J.R.G. Saint-Louis, CD
*1973–1975 – LCol P.B. Fecteau, CD
*1975–1979 – LCol T.K. Stafford, CD
*1979–1985 – LCol S.J. Goldberg, CD
*1985–1988 – LCol J.F. Stirling, CD
*1988–1991 – LCol J.M. Pronkin, CD
*1991–1995 – LCol J.M. Lewis, CD
*1995–1998 – LCol D.A. Patterson, CD
*1998–2001 – LCol J.G.M.B. Lefebvre, CD
*2001–2005 – LCol J.M.N. Bernier, CD
*2005–2008 – LCol M. Bourque, CD 
*2008–2013 – LCol D. Parent, CD
*2013–2015 – LCol R. Garon, CD
*2015–present – LCol S. Pelletier, CD

==Armoury==
During November 1970 the regiment moved to its current location at the Côte des Neiges Armoury, after its Craig Street Armoury was demolished, the regiment had been based there for 75 years.

**I think we were called the RCA 101st(1966–67) and trained Saturday mornings with our six 105 mm howitzers at the Lacombe Armoury, behind the Veterans Hospital on Queen Mary Rd. In the summer we used the Hussars Armoury for training sessions!

Its cover price was 20p, represented by a stylized graphic depiction of a 20p coin. Throughout its run, it billed itself as &quot;Britain&#x27;s bubbling new comic!&quot;, a reference to the title masthead being made up of steam-billowing pipes (hence the title). The comic was the last new humour anthology comic from DC Thomson which mostly featured original characters.

==List of &quot;Hoot&quot; comic strips==
Strips throughout its 53 issue run included. Listed in order of appearance. All numbers refer to issues of Hoot.
==List of Characters featured in &quot;Hoot&quot; mini-strips==
The comic also featured short, four-frame strips featuring pre-existing DC Thomson characters, but few of these strips seemed to have been drawn by their &quot;proper&quot; artists, hence a rather odd-looking Lord Snooty. Below is a list of these four frame strips. These strips were drawn by George Martin and after &quot;Hoot&quot;″s merger with &quot;The Dandy&quot; they reappeared in &quot;The Dandy&quot; (still drawn by George Martin) under the title Comic Cuts and this time featured more &quot;Dandy&quot; characters than in &quot;Hoot&quot;.

Some factories that were the primary producers of military equipment, especially tanks, are also given.

One of the goals of biochip technology is to efficiently screen large numbers of biological analytes, with potential applications ranging from disease diagnosis to detection of bioterrorism agents. For example, digital microfluidic biochips are under investigation for applications in biomedical fields. In a digital microfluidic biochip, a group of (adjacent) cells in the microfluidic array can be configured to work as storage, functional operations, as well as for transporting fluid droplets dynamically.

==History==
The development started with early work on the underlying sensor technology. One of the first portable, chemistry-based sensors was the glass pH electrode, invented in 1922 by Hughes. The basic concept of using exchange sites to create permselective membranes was used to develop other ion sensors in subsequent years. For example, a K+ sensor was produced by incorporating valinomycin into a thin membrane.

In 1953, Watson and Crick announced their discovery of the now familiar double helix structure of DNA molecules and set the stage for genetics research that continues to the present day. The development of sequencing techniques in 1977 by Gilbert and Sanger (working separately) enabled researchers to directly read the genetic codes that provide instructions for protein synthesis. This research showed how hybridization of complementary single oligonucleotide strands could be used as a basis for DNA sensing. Two additional developments enabled the technology used in modern DNA-based. First, in 1983 Kary Mullis invented the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, a method for amplifying DNA concentrations. This discovery made possible the detection of extremely small quantities of DNA in samples. Secondly in 1986 Hood and co-workers devised a method to label DNA molecules with fluorescent tags instead of radiolabels, thus enabling hybridization experiments to be observed optically.
Figure 1 shows the make up of a typical biochip platform. The actual sensing component (or &quot;chip&quot;) is just one piece of a complete analysis system. Transduction must be done to translate the actual sensing event (DNA binding, oxidation/reduction, &quot;etc.&quot;) into a format understandable by a computer (voltage, light intensity, mass, &quot;etc.&quot;), which then enables additional analysis and processing to produce a final, human-readable output. The multiple technologies needed to make a successful biochip—from sensing chemistry, to microarraying, to signal processing—require a true multidisciplinary approach, making the barrier to entry steep. One of the first commercial biochips was introduced by Affymetrix. Their &quot;GeneChip&quot; products contain thousands of individual DNA sensors for use in sensing defects, or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in genes such as p53 (a tumor suppressor) and BRCA1 and BRCA2 (related to breast cancer). The chips are produced by using microlithography techniques traditionally used to fabricate integrated circuits (see below).

==Microarray fabrication==

The microarray—the dense, two-dimensional grid of biosensors—is the critical component of a biochip platform. Typically, the sensors are deposited on a flat substrate, which may either be passive (&quot;e.g.&quot; silicon or glass) or active, the latter
consisting of integrated electronics or micromechanical devices that perform or assist signal transduction. Surface chemistry is used to covalently bind the sensor molecules to the substrate medium. The fabrication of microarrays is non-trivial and is a major economic and technological hurdle that may ultimately decide the success of future biochip platforms. The primary manufacturing challenge is the process of placing each sensor at a specific position (typically on a Cartesian grid) on the substrate. Various means exist to achieve the placement, but typically robotic micro-pipetting or micro-printing systems are used to place tiny spots of sensor material on the chip surface. Because each sensor is unique, only a few spots can be placed at a time. The low-throughput nature of this
process results in high manufacturing costs.

Fodor and colleagues developed a unique fabrication process (later used by Affymetrix) in which a series of microlithography steps is used to combinatorially synthesize hundreds of thousands of unique, single-stranded DNA sensors on a substrate one nucleotide at a time. One lithography step is needed per base type; thus, a total of four steps is required per nucleotide level. Although this technique is very powerful in that many sensors can be created simultaneously, it is currently only feasible for creating short DNA strands (15–25 nucleotides). Reliability and cost factors limit the number of photolithography steps that can be done. Furthermore, light-directed combinatorial synthesis techniques are not currently possible for proteins or other sensing molecules.

As noted above, most microarrays consist of a Cartesian grid of sensors. This approach is used chiefly to map or &quot;encode&quot; the coordinate of each sensor to its function. Sensors in these arrays typically use a universal signalling technique (&quot;e.g.&quot; fluorescence), thus making coordinates their only identifying feature. These arrays must be made using a serial process (&quot;i.e.&quot; requiring multiple, sequential steps) to ensure that each sensor is placed at the correct position.

&quot;Random&quot; fabrication, in which the sensors are placed at arbitrary positions on the chip, is an alternative to the serial method. The tedious and expensive positioning process is
not required, enabling the use of parallelized self-assembly techniques. In this approach, large batches of identical sensors can be produced; sensors from each batch are then combined and assembled into an array. A non-coordinate based encoding scheme must be used to identify each sensor. As the figure shows, such a design was first demonstrated (and later commercialized by Illumina) using functionalized beads placed randomly in the wells of an etched fiber optic cable. Each bead was uniquely encoded with a fluorescent signature. However, this encoding scheme is limited in the number of unique dye combinations that can be used and successfully differentiated.

==Protein biochip array and other microarray technologies==
Microarrays are not limited to DNA analysis; protein microarrays, antibody microarray, chemical compound microarray can also be produced using biochips. Randox Laboratories Ltd. launched Evidence, the first protein Biochip Array Technology analyzer in 2003. In protein Biochip Array Technology, the biochip replaces the ELISA plate or cuvette as the reaction platform. The biochip is used to simultaneously analyze a panel of related tests in a single sample, producing a patient profile. The patient profile can be used in disease screening, diagnosis, monitoring disease progression or monitoring treatment. Performing multiple analyses simultaneously, described as multiplexing, allows a significant reduction in processing time and the amount of patient sample required. Biochip Array Technology is a novel application of a familiar methodology, using sandwich, competitive and antibody-capture immunoassays. The difference from conventional immunoassays is that, the capture ligands are covalently attached to the surface of the biochip in an ordered array rather than in solution.

In sandwich assays an enzyme-labelled antibody is used; in competitive assays an enzyme-labelled antigen is used. On antibody-antigen binding a chemiluminescence reaction produces light. Detection is by a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. The CCD camera is a sensitive and high-resolution sensor able to accurately detect and quantify very low levels of light. The test regions are located using a grid pattern then the chemiluminescence signals are analysed by imaging software to rapidly and simultaneously quantify the individual analytes.

Biochips are also used in the field of microphysiometry e.g. in skin-on-a-chip applications.

== Types of Biotechnology Chips ==
There are several types of biotechnology chips, each designed for specific applications. The primary types include:

=== DNA Microarrays ===
DNA microarrays are perhaps the most widely used biotechnology chips. They consist of a grid of thousands of tiny DNA probes that can bind to specific DNA sequences. Researchers use DNA microarrays to detect gene expression, analyze genetic variation, and explore gene function.

=== Protein Chips ===
Protein chips (also known as &quot;proteomics chips&quot;) are designed to detect and analyze proteins. These chips contain arrays of immobilized proteins or antibodies, which can be used for profiling protein interactions, identification, and quantification.

=== Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) ===
Lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices integrate multiple laboratory functions into a single chip. These chips incorporate sample preparation, reaction, analysis, and detection into one compact platform. LOC devices are used for clinical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and chemical analysis.

=== Cell Chips ===
Cell chips are designed to grow and analyze living cells. They provide a platform for studying cellular behavior, drug interactions, and cell signaling. These chips allow high-throughput screening of potential drugs and treatments for various diseases

=== Microfluidic Chips ===
Microfluidic chips manipulate tiny amounts of liquids and gases in channels with micro-scale dimensions. These chips are used for a variety of biological applications, including PCR amplification, cell sorting, and DNA sequencing

== Applications of Biotechnology Chips ==
Biotechnology chips have a wide range of applications across many fields:

=== Medical Diagnostics ===
Biotechnology chips are widely used in medical diagnostics for detecting diseases such as cancer, infections, and genetic disorders. These chips can rapidly analyze samples of blood, saliva, or tissue to detect genetic mutations, infectious agents, and biomarkers.

=== Drug Development and Personalized Medicine ===
Biotechnology chips play a key role in the development of new drugs. They enable high-throughput screening of potential drug compounds and help identify biomarkers for personalized treatment plans. Additionally, the use of biotechnology chips allows for more efficient testing of drug efficacy and safety.

=== 3Genomics and Proteomics ===
Biotechnology chips are indispensable tools for genomics and proteomics research. DNA microarrays and protein chips enable scientists to analyze large amounts of genetic and protein data simultaneously. These chips facilitate the study of gene expression, genetic variation, and protein interactions, advancing our understanding of complex biological systems.

=== Environmental Monitoring ===
Lab-on-a-chip and microfluidic devices are also used for environmental monitoring. These chips can test water, air, and soil samples for contaminants, pathogens, and toxins. Their portable nature allows for on-site analysis, making them valuable for environmental research and disaster response.

=== Agricultural Biotechnology ===
Biotechnology chips are used in agricultural research to analyze crops, monitor soil health, and study plant pathogens. They enable more efficient and precise breeding programs, improving crop yield, pest resistance, and disease prevention.

<doc id="859990" wikidata="Q5415558" url="?curid=859990" title="Evan Thornley">
<text>Evan William Thornley (born 1964), is an Australian social entrepreneur, philanthropist and impact investor. Thornley is the founder and executive chair of LongView, with a mission to find solutions to Australia&#x27;s housing crisis. Based on his own childhood without secure housing, he is a passionate advocate for renters as well as bridging the affordability gap for Australian&#x27;s who don&#x27;t come from money, and lack the .  LongView has grown to become a recognised industry leader in residential property buying and management and now, through its Shared Equity Fund (a form of equity sharing) is pioneering the development of a funds management to already existing dwelling assets to solve Australia&#x27;s property market&#x27;s affordability crisis by co-investing alongside homebuyers.

Thornley was founding chair of Per Capita and National Secretary of the Australian Fabian Society. He was a board member of the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the Chifley Research Centre, was a founding director of GetUp!. Along with his wife, he founded LookSmart, the first Australian dot-com company listed on the NASDAQ. During the dot-com bubble, his stake in the company was worth almost $1 billion, but its value declined by 99% as the bubble burst. Thornley made an attempt to buy LookSmart&#x27;s search engine competitor Google during its early days but founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin rejected the offer.

Thornley is a co-founder of the Goodstart Consortium - a social enterprise that owns the largest childcare network in the world (formerly called ABC Learning). His vision for Goodstart was to ensure Australia&#x27;s children have the best possible start in life by providing the learning, development and wellbeing outcomes they need. He was formerly the CEO of Better Place Australia and Global CEO of Better Place LLC, which developed electric cars and the charging or switching stations to support them. Thornley served in public office for two years as the Labor member of the Victorian Legislative Council for the Southern Metropolitan Region, and as Parliamentary Secretary to Premiers Bracks and Brumby.

==Background and early career==
Thornley was raised by a single mother under difficult circumstances on the NSW coast. At one stage his mother had 4 children under the age of 7, and survived on welfare and the kindness of the local community. He has 6 sisters.

A gifted student, Thornley attended Scotch College, Melbourne on a full scholarship and is a graduate of the University of Melbourne. He commenced his university studies in 1983 and served in full-time elected student office as President of the Student Representative Council, and then in the National Union of Students in 1987 and 1988. He completed a Bachelor of Commerce and a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1990, and from 1991 to 1995 he was a consultant at McKinsey and Company, a management consultancy firm.

== Political career ==
Elected to the Parliament of Victoria in 2006, he served as Parliamentary Secretary assisting the Premier on the National Reform Agenda and Innovation until his resignation on 31 December 2008. He is a noted donor to various progressive causes, including the Australian Labor Party.

On 28 December 2008, Thornley announced that he would resign from the Victorian Parliament, despite speculation that he would be chosen to serve as a minister in John Brumby&#x27;s government. His resignation had mixed responses in Victorian politics, with some Labor colleagues who thought his decision &quot;insulting&quot; and others acknowledging that for many people like Thornley who move into politics to make a real and personal impact, the reality of the slow pace of change within government can be frustrating and unsuitable.

After his departure he announced he had been appointed as the CEO of Australian operations for Better Place, a company promoting electric cars, which he said he thought was a &quot;once-in-a-generation transformational project&quot;.

A joint sitting of the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council of the Victorian Parliament was required to select a new member to fill the vacancy caused by Thornley&#x27;s resignation. It was the first casual vacancy to occur since the reform of the Legislative Council in 2006. Under the new rules, which mirror those of the Australian Senate, if the vacating MLC had been elected as a member of a political party, the joint sitting must select a person nominated by that political party. On 30 January 2009, it was announced that Melbourne lawyer Jennifer Huppert had been nominated by the ALP to fill the upper house vacancy.

== Post-political career ==
Having served as the Australian head of Better Place since his resignation from parliament, Thornley was elevated to global CEO of the company following the sacking, in October 2012, of its founder and major spokesperson Shai Agassi. However, Thornley severed his connection with Better Place only three months later.

In January 2014, he became executive chair of Same Business Different Outcome (SBDO), a private equity firm. He is now executive chair of LongView, a property management company.

== Connection to Israel, Judaism ==
Thornley first went to Israel on a Young Political Leaders&#x27; Tour while at University and was part of a pro-Israel group humorously dubbed &quot;the Mossad faction&quot;. He led an Australia Israel Chamber of Commerce trade mission to Israel in 2008 and has been a delegate to the Australia Israel Leadership Forum several times. He was Secretary of the Parliamentary Friends of Israel and visited Israel over 30 times during his tenure at Better Place. He was a member of the strategic review panel for the Rabbinical Council of Victoria. Thornley began a formal process of converting to Judaism in 2012 under Rabbi Adam Stein at Kehilat Nitzan, Melbourne&#x27;s only Conservative synagogue. Thornley formally completed the conversion process on 19 August 2014 and adopted the Hebrew name of &quot;Lev Yonatan&quot;.

<text>Smokeless powder is a type of propellant used in firearms and artillery that produces less smoke and less fouling when fired compared to black powder. Because of their similar use, both the original black powder formulation and the smokeless propellant which replaced it are commonly described as gunpowder. The combustion products of smokeless powder are mainly gaseous, compared to around 55% solid products (mostly potassium carbonate, potassium sulfate, and potassium sulfide) for black powder. In addition, smokeless powder does not leave the thick, heavy fouling of hygroscopic material associated with black powder that causes rusting of the barrel.

Despite its name, smokeless powder is not completely free of smoke; while there may be little noticeable smoke from small-arms ammunition, smoke from artillery fire can be substantial.

Invented in 1884 by Paul Vieille, the most common formulations are based on nitrocellulose, but the term was also used to describe various picrate mixtures with nitrate, chlorate, or dichromate oxidizers during the late 19th century, before the advantages of nitrocellulose became evident.

Smokeless powders are typically classified as division 1.3 explosives under the UN &quot;Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods – Model Regulations&quot;, regional regulations (such as ADR) and national regulations. However, they are used as solid propellants; in normal use, they undergo deflagration rather than detonation.

Smokeless powder made autoloading firearms with many moving parts feasible (which would otherwise jam or seize under heavy black powder fouling). Smokeless powder allowed the development of modern semi- and fully automatic firearms and lighter breeches and barrels for artillery.

== History ==
Before the widespread introduction of smokeless powder the use of gunpowder or black powder caused many problems on the battlefield. Military commanders since the Napoleonic Wars reported difficulty with giving orders on a battlefield obscured by the smoke of firing. Visual signals could not be seen through the thick smoke from the gunpowder used by the guns. Unless there was a strong wind, after a few shots, soldiers using gunpowder ammunition would have their view obscured by a huge cloud of smoke, and this problem became worse with increasing rate of fire. In 1884 during the Battle of Tamai Sudanese troops were able to break the square of British infantry armed with Martini–Henries because of that. Sharpshooters firing from concealed positions risked revealing their locations with a cloud of smoke.

Gunpowder burns in a relatively inefficient process that produces lower pressures, making it about one-third as powerful as the same amount of smokeless powder.

A significant portion of the combustion products from gunpowder are solids that are hygroscopic, i.e. they attract moisture from the air and make cleaning mandatory after every use, in order to prevent water accumulation in the barrel that can lead to corrosion and premature failure. These solids are also behind gunpowder&#x27;s tendency to produce severe fouling that causes breech-loading actions to jam and can make reloading difficult.

=== Nitroglycerine and guncotton ===
Nitroglycerine was synthesized by the Italian chemist Ascanio Sobrero in 1847. It was subsequently developed and manufactured by Alfred Nobel as an industrial explosive under the trademark &quot;Dynamite&quot;, but even then it was unsuitable as a propellant: despite its energetic and smokeless qualities, it detonates at supersonic speed, as opposed to deflagrating smoothly at subsonic speeds, making it more liable to shatter a gun barrel rather than propel a projectile out of it. Nitroglycerine is also highly shock-sensitive, making it unfit to be carried in battlefield conditions.

A major step forward was the invention of guncotton, a nitrocellulose-based material, by German chemist Christian Friedrich Schönbein in 1846. He promoted its use as a blasting explosive and sold manufacturing rights to the Austrian Empire. Guncotton was more powerful than gunpowder, but at the same time was once again somewhat more unstable. John Taylor obtained an English patent for guncotton; and John Hall &amp; Sons began manufacture in Faversham.

English interest languished after an explosion destroyed the Faversham factory in 1847. Austrian Baron Wilhelm Lenk von Wolfsberg built two guncotton plants producing artillery propellent, but it too was dangerous under field conditions, and guns that could fire thousands of rounds using black powder would reach the end of their service life after only a few hundred shots with the more powerful guncotton. Small arms could not withstand the pressures generated by guncotton.

After one of the Austrian factories blew up in 1862, Thomas Prentice &amp; Company began manufacturing guncotton in Stowmarket in 1863; and British War Office chemist Sir Frederick Abel began thorough research at Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills leading to a manufacturing process that eliminated the impurities in nitrocellulose making it safer to produce and a stable product safer to handle. Abel patented this process in 1865 when the second Austrian guncotton factory exploded. After the Stowmarket factory exploded in 1871, Waltham Abbey began production of guncotton for torpedo and mine warheads.

=== Improvements ===

In 1863, Prussian artillery captain Johann F. E. Schultze patented a small-arms propellant of nitrated hardwood impregnated with saltpeter or barium nitrate. Prentice received an 1866 patent for a sporting powder of nitrated paper manufactured at Stowmarket, but ballistic uniformity suffered as the paper absorbed atmospheric moisture. In 1871, Frederick Volkmann received an Austrian patent for a colloided version of Schultze powder called &quot;Collodin&quot;, which he manufactured near Vienna for use in sporting firearms. Austrian patents were not published at the time, and the Austrian Empire considered the operation a violation of the government monopoly on explosives manufacture and closed the Volkmann factory in 1875.

In 1882, the Explosives Company at Stowmarket patented an improved formulation of nitrated cotton gelatinised by ether-alcohol with nitrates of potassium and barium. These propellants were suitable for shotguns but not rifles, because rifling results in resistance to a smooth expansion of the gas, which is reduced in smoothbore shotguns.

In 1884, Paul Vieille invented a smokeless powder called Poudre B (short for &quot;poudre blanche&quot;, white powder, as distinguished from black powder) made from 68.2% insoluble nitrocellulose, 29.8% soluble nitrocellulose gelatinized with ether and 2% paraffin. This was adopted for the Lebel rifle chambered in 8×50mmR Lebel. It was passed through rollers to form paper-thin sheets, which were cut into flakes of the desired size. The resulting propellant, known as &quot;pyrocellulose&quot;, contains somewhat less nitrogen than guncotton does, and is less volatile. A particularly good feature of the propellant is that it will not detonate unless it is compressed, making it very safe to handle under normal conditions. Vieille&#x27;s powder revolutionized the effectiveness of small guns because it gave off almost no smoke and was three times more powerful than black powder. Higher muzzle velocity meant a flatter trajectory and less wind drift and bullet drop, making shots practicable. Since less powder was needed to propel a bullet, the cartridge could be made smaller and lighter. This allowed troops to carry more ammunition for the same weight. Also, it would burn even when wet. Black powder ammunition had to be kept dry and was almost always stored and transported in watertight cartridges. Other European countries swiftly followed and started using their own versions of Poudre B, the first being Germany and Austria, which introduced new weapons in 1888. Subsequently, Poudre B was modified several times with various compounds being added and removed. Krupp began adding diphenylamine as a stabilizer in 1888.

Meanwhile, in 1887, Alfred Nobel obtained an English patent for a smokeless gunpowder he called ballistite. In this propellant the fibrous structure of cotton (nitro-cellulose) was destroyed by a nitroglycerine solution instead of a solvent. In England in 1889, a similar powder was patented by Hiram Maxim, and in the United States in 1890 by Hudson Maxim. Ballistite was patented in the United States in 1891. The Germans adopted ballistite for naval use in 1898, calling it WPC/98. The Italians adopted it as &quot;filite&quot;, in cord instead of flake form—but, realising its drawbacks, changed to a formulation with nitroglycerine that they called &quot;solenite&quot;. In 1891 the Russians tasked the chemist Mendeleev with finding a suitable propellant. He created nitrocellulose gelatinised by ether-alcohol, which produced more nitrogen and more uniform colloidal structure than the French use of nitro-cottons in Poudre B. He called it pyrocollodion.

Britain conducted trials on all the various types of propellant brought to its attention, but was dissatisfied with them all and sought something superior to all existing types. In 1889, Sir Frederick Abel, James Dewar and Dr W Kellner patented (Nos 5614 and 11,664 in the names of Abel and Dewar) a new formulation that was manufactured at the Royal Gunpowder Factory at Waltham Abbey. It entered British service in 1891 as Cordite Mark 1. Its main composition was 58% nitroglycerine, 37% guncotton and 3% mineral jelly. A modified version, Cordite MD, entered service in 1901, with the guncotton percentage increased to 65% and nitroglycerine reduced to 30%. This change reduced the combustion temperature and hence erosion and barrel wear. Cordite&#x27;s advantages over gunpowder were reduced maximum pressure in the chamber (hence lighter breeches, etc.) but longer high pressure. Cordite could be made in any desired shape or size. The creation of cordite led to a lengthy court battle between Nobel, Maxim, and another inventor over alleged British patent infringement.

The Anglo-American Explosives Company began manufacturing its shotgun powder in Oakland, New Jersey, in 1890. DuPont began producing guncotton at Carneys Point Township, New Jersey, in 1891. Charles E. Munroe of the Naval Torpedo Station in Newport, Rhode Island, patented a formulation of guncotton colloided with nitrobenzene, called &quot;Indurite&quot;, in 1891. Several United States firms began producing smokeless powder when Winchester Repeating Arms Company started loading sporting cartridges with Explosives Company powder in 1893. California Powder Works began producing a mixture of nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose with ammonium picrate as &quot;Peyton Powder&quot;, Leonard Smokeless Powder Company began producing nitroglycerine–nitrocellulose &quot;Ruby&quot; powders, Laflin &amp; Rand negotiated a license to produce &quot;Ballistite&quot;, and DuPont started producing smokeless shotgun powder. The United States Army evaluated 25 varieties of smokeless powder and selected &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Peyton Powders&quot; as the most suitable for use in the Krag–Jørgensen service rifle. &quot;Ruby&quot; was preferred, because tin-plating was required to protect brass cartridge cases from picric acid in the &quot;Peyton Powder&quot;. Rather than paying the required royalties for &quot;Ballistite&quot;, Laflin &amp; Rand financed Leonard&#x27;s reorganization as the American Smokeless Powder Company. United States Army Lieutenant Whistler assisted American Smokeless Powder Company factory superintendent Aspinwall in formulating an improved powder named W.A. for their efforts. W.A. smokeless powder was the standard for United States military service rifles from 1897 until 1908.

In 1897, United States Navy Lieutenant John Bernadou patented a nitrocellulose powder colloided with ether-alcohol. The Navy licensed or sold patents for this formulation to DuPont and the California Powder Works while retaining manufacturing rights for the Naval Powder Factory, Indian Head, Maryland constructed in 1900. The United States Army adopted the Navy single-base formulation in 1908 and began manufacture at Picatinny Arsenal. By that time Laflin &amp; Rand had taken over the American Powder Company to protect their investment, and Laflin &amp; Rand had been purchased by DuPont in 1902. Upon securing a 99-year lease of the Explosives Company in 1903, DuPont enjoyed use of all significant smokeless powder patents in the United States, and was able to optimize production of smokeless powder. When government anti-trust action forced divestiture in 1912, DuPont retained the nitrocellulose smokeless powder formulations used by the United States military and released the double-base formulations used in sporting ammunition to the reorganized Hercules Powder Company. These newer and more powerful propellants were more stable and thus safer to handle than Poudre B.

== Characteristics ==

The properties of the propellant are greatly influenced by the size and shape of its pieces. The specific surface area of the propellant influences the speed of burning, and the size and shape of the particles determine the specific surface area. By manipulation of the shape it is possible to influence the burning rate and hence the rate at which pressure builds during combustion. Smokeless powder burns only on the surfaces of the pieces. Larger pieces burn more slowly, and the burn rate is further controlled by flame-deterrent coatings that retard burning slightly. The intent is to regulate the burn rate so that a more or less constant pressure is exerted on the propelled projectile as long as it is in the barrel so as to obtain the highest velocity. The perforations stabilize the burn rate because as the outside burns inward (thus shrinking the burning surface area) the inside is burning outward (thus increasing the burning surface area, but faster, so as to fill up the increasing volume of barrel presented by the departing projectile). Fast-burning pistol powders are made by extruding shapes with more area such as flakes or by flattening the spherical granules. Drying is usually performed under a vacuum. The solvents are condensed and recycled. The granules are also coated with graphite to prevent static electricity sparks from causing undesired ignitions.

Smokeless powder does not leave the thick, heavy fouling of hygroscopic material associated with black powder that causes rusting of the barrel (though some primer compounds can leave hygroscopic salts that have a similar effect; non-corrosive primer compounds were introduced in the 1920s).)

Faster-burning propellants generate higher temperatures and higher pressures, however they also increase wear on gun barrels.

Nitrocellulose deteriorates with time, yielding acidic byproducts. Those byproducts catalyze the further deterioration, increasing its rate. The released heat, in case of bulk storage of the powder, or too large blocks of solid propellant, can cause self-ignition of the material. Single-base nitrocellulose propellants are hygroscopic and most susceptible to degradation; double-base and triple-base propellants tend to deteriorate more slowly. To neutralize the decomposition products, which could otherwise cause corrosion of metals of the cartridges and gun barrels, calcium carbonate is added to some formulations.

To prevent buildup of the deterioration products, stabilizers are added. Diphenylamine is one of the most common stabilizers used. Nitrated analogs of diphenylamine formed in the process of stabilizing decomposing powder are sometimes used as stabilizers themselves. The stabilizers are added in the amount of 0.5–2% of the total amount of the formulation; higher amounts tend to degrade its ballistic properties. The amount of the stabilizer is depleted with time with substantial changes of ballistic properties. Propellants in storage should be periodically tested for the amount of stabilizer remaining, as its depletion may lead to auto-ignition of the propellant. Moisture changes the stabilizers consumption over time.

== Composition ==
Propellants using nitrocellulose (detonation velocity , RE factor 1.10) (typically an ether-alcohol colloid of nitrocellulose) as the sole explosive propellant ingredient are described as single-base powder.

Propellants mixtures containing nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin (detonation velocity , RE factor 1.54) as explosive propellant ingredients are known as double-base powder. Alternatively diethylene glycol dinitrate (detonation velocity , RE factor 1.17) can be used as a nitroglycerin replacement when reduced flame temperatures without sacrificing chamber pressure are of importance. Reduction of flame temperature significantly reduces barrel erosion and hence wear.

During the 1930s, triple-base propellants containing nitrocellulose, nitroglycerin or diethylene glycol dinitrate, and a substantial quantity of nitroguanidine (detonation velocity , RE factor 0.95) as explosive propellant ingredients were commercialized. The first triple-base propellant, featuring 20-25% of nitroguanidine and 30-45% nitroglycerine, was developed at the Dynamit Nobel factory at Avigliana by its director Dr. Modesto Abelli (1859-1911) and patented in 1905. These &quot;cold propellant&quot; mixtures have reduced flash and flame temperature without sacrificing chamber pressure compared to single- and double-base propellants, albeit at the cost of more smoke. In practice, triple-base propellants are, due to their higher price, reserved mainly for high-velocity large caliber ammunition such as used in (naval) artillery and tank guns, which suffer from bore erosion the most. During WWII they had some use by British and German artillery, and after the war they became the standard propellants in all British large-caliber ammunition designs except small arms. Most Western nations, except the United States, followed a similar path.

In the late 20th century new propellant formulations started to appear. These are based on nitroguanidine and high explosives of the RDX type (detonation velocity , RE factor 1.60).

Detonation velocities are of limited value in assessing the reaction rates of nitrocellulose propellants formulated to avoid detonation. Although the slower reaction is often described as burning because of similar gaseous end products at elevated temperatures, the decomposition differs from combustion in an oxygen atmosphere. Conversion of nitrocellulose propellants to high-pressure gas proceeds from the exposed surface to the interior of each solid particle in accordance with Piobert&#x27;s law. Studies of solid single- and double-base propellant reactions suggest reaction rate is controlled by heat transfer through the temperature gradient across a series of zones or phases as the reaction proceeds from the surface into the solid. The deepest portion of the solid experiencing heat transfer melts and begins phase transition from solid to gas in a &quot;foam zone&quot;. The gaseous propellant decomposes into simpler molecules in a surrounding &quot;fizz zone&quot;. Energy is released in a luminous outer &quot;flame zone&quot; where the simpler gas molecules react to form conventional combustion products like steam and carbon monoxide. The &quot;foam zone&quot; acts as an insulator slowing the rate of heat transfer from the &quot;flame zone&quot; into the unreacted solid. Reaction rates vary with pressure; because the foam allows less effective heat transfer at low pressure, with greater heat transfer as higher pressures compress the gas volume of that foam. Propellants designed for a minimum heat transfer pressure may fail to sustain the &quot;flame zone&quot; at lower pressures.

The energetic components used in smokeless propellants include nitrocellulose (the most common), nitroglycerin, nitroguanidine, DINA (bis-nitroxyethylnitramine; diethanolamine dinitrate, DEADN; DHE), Fivonite (2,2,5,5-tetramethylol-cyclopentanone tetranitrate, CyP), DGN (diethylene glycol dinitrate), and acetyl cellulose.

Deterrents (or moderants) are used to slow the burning rate. Deterrents include centralites (symmetrical diphenyl urea—primarily diethyl or dimethyl), dibutyl phthalate, dinitrotoluene (toxic and carcinogenic), akardite (asymmetrical diphenyl urea), ortho-Tolyl urethane, and polyester adipate. Camphor was formerly used but is now obsolete.

Stabilizers prevent or slow down self-decomposition. These include diphenylamine, petroleum jelly, calcium carbonate, magnesium oxide, sodium bicarbonate, and beta-Naphthol methyl ether Obsolete stabilizers include amyl alcohol and aniline.

Decoppering additives hinder the buildup of copper residues from the gun barrel rifling. These include tin metal and compounds (e.g., tin dioxide), and bismuth metal and compounds (e.g., bismuth trioxide, bismuth subcarbonate, bismuth nitrate, bismuth antimonide); the bismuth compounds are favored as copper dissolves in molten bismuth, forming brittle and easily removable alloy. Lead foil and lead compounds have been phased out due to toxicity.

Wear reduction materials including wax, talc and titanium dioxide are added to lower the wear of the gun barrel liners. Large guns use polyurethane jackets over the powder bags.

Other additives include ethyl acetate (a solvent for manufacture of spherical powder), rosin (a surfactant to hold the grain shape of spherical powder) and graphite (a lubricant to cover the grains and prevent them from sticking together, and to dissipate static electricity).

=== Flash reduction ===

Flash reducers dim muzzle flash, the light emitted in the vicinity of the muzzle by the hot propellant gases and the chemical reactions that follow as the gases mix with the surrounding air. Before projectiles exit, a slight pre-flash may occur from gases leaking past the projectiles. Following muzzle exit, the heat of gases is usually sufficient to emit visible radiation: the primary flash. The gases expand but as they pass through the Mach disc, they are re-compressed to produce an intermediate flash. Hot, combustible gases (e.g. hydrogen and carbon-monoxide) may follow when they mix with oxygen in the surrounding air to produce the secondary flash, the brightest. The secondary flash does not usually occur with small arms.

Nitrocellulose contains insufficient oxygen to completely oxidize its carbon and hydrogen. The oxygen deficit is increased by addition of graphite and organic stabilizers. Products of combustion within the gun barrel include flammable gasses like hydrogen and carbon monoxide. At high temperature, these flammable gasses will ignite when turbulently mixed with atmospheric oxygen beyond the muzzle of the gun. During night engagements, the flash produced by ignition can reveal the location of the gun to enemy forces and cause temporary night-blindness among the gun crew by photo-bleaching visual purple.

Flash suppressors are commonly used on small arms to reduce the flash signature, but this approach is not practical for artillery. Artillery muzzle flash up to from the muzzle has been observed, and can be reflected off clouds and be visible for distances up to . For artillery, the most effective method is a propellant that produces a large proportion of inert nitrogen at relatively low temperatures that dilutes the combustible gases. Triple-base propellants are used for this because of the nitrogen in the nitroguanidine.

Flash reducers include potassium chloride, potassium nitrate, potassium sulfate, and potassium bitartrate (potassium hydrogen tartrate: a byproduct of wine production formerly used by French artillery). Before the use of triple-base propellants, the usual method of flash reduction was to add inorganic salts like potassium chloride so their specific heat capacity might reduce the temperature of combustion gasses and their finely divided particulate smoke might block visible wavelengths of radiant energy of combustion.

All flash reducers have a disadvantage: the production of smoke.

== Manufacturing ==
Smokeless powder may be corned into small spherical balls or extruded into cylinders or strips with many cross-sectional shapes (strips with various rectangular proportions, single or multi-hole cylinders, slotted cylinders) using solvents such as ether. These extrusions can be cut into short (&quot;flakes&quot;) or long pieces (&quot;cords&quot; many inches long). Cannon powder has the largest pieces.

The United States Navy manufactured single-base tubular powder for naval artillery at Indian Head, Maryland, beginning in 1900. Similar procedures were used for United States Army production at Picatinny Arsenal beginning in 1907 and for manufacture of smaller grained Improved Military Rifle (IMR) powders after 1914. Short-fiber cotton linter was boiled in a solution of sodium hydroxide to remove vegetable waxes, and then dried before conversion to nitrocellulose by mixing with concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids. Nitrocellulose still resembles fibrous cotton at this point in the manufacturing process, and was typically identified as pyrocellulose because it would spontaneously ignite in air until unreacted acid was removed. The term &quot;guncotton&quot; was also used; although some references identify guncotton as a more extensively nitrated and refined product used in torpedo and mine warheads prior to use of TNT.

Unreacted acid was removed from pyrocellulose pulp by a multistage draining and water washing process similar to that used in paper mills during production of chemical woodpulp. Pressurized alcohol removed remaining water from drained pyrocellulose prior to mixing with ether and diphenylamine. The mixture was then fed through a press extruding a long tubular cord form to be cut into grains of the desired length.

Alcohol and ether were then evaporated from &quot;green&quot; powder grains to a remaining solvent concentration between 3 percent for rifle powders and 7 percent for large artillery powder grains. Burning rate is inversely proportional to solvent concentration. Grains were coated with electrically conductive graphite to minimize generation of static electricity during subsequent blending. &quot;Lots&quot; containing more than ten tonnes of powder grains were mixed through a tower arrangement of blending hoppers to minimize ballistic differences. Each blended lot was then subjected to testing to determine the correct loading charge for the desired performance.

Military quantities of old smokeless powder were sometimes reworked into new lots of propellants. Through the 1920s Fred Olsen worked at Picatinny Arsenal experimenting with ways to salvage tons of single-base cannon powder manufactured for World War I. Olsen was employed by Western Cartridge Company in 1929 and developed a process for manufacturing spherical smokeless powder by 1933. Reworked powder or washed pyrocellulose can be dissolved in ethyl acetate containing small quantities of desired stabilizers and other additives. The resultant syrup, combined with water and surfactants, can be heated and agitated in a pressurized container until the syrup forms an emulsion of small spherical globules of the desired size. Ethyl acetate distills off as pressure is slowly reduced to leave small spheres of nitrocellulose and additives. The spheres can be subsequently modified by adding nitroglycerine to increase energy, flattening between rollers to a uniform minimum dimension, coating with phthalate deterrents to slow ignition, and/or glazing with graphite to improve flow characteristics during blending.

Modern smokeless powder is produced in the United States by St. Marks Powder, Inc. owned by General Dynamics.

<text>In-group favoritism, sometimes known as in-group–out-group bias, in-group bias, intergroup bias, or in-group preference, is a pattern of favoring members of one&#x27;s in-group over out-group members. This can be expressed in evaluation of others, in allocation of resources, and in many other ways.

This effect has been researched by many psychologists and linked to many theories related to group conflict and prejudice. The phenomenon is primarily viewed from a social psychology standpoint. Studies have shown that in-group favoritism arises as a result of the formation of cultural groups. These cultural groups can be divided based on seemingly trivial observable traits, but with time, populations grow to associate certain traits with certain behavior, increasing covariation. This then incentivizes in-group bias.

Two prominent theoretical approaches to the phenomenon of in-group favoritism are realistic conflict theory and social identity theory. Realistic conflict theory proposes that intergroup competition, and sometimes intergroup conflict, arises when two groups have opposing claims to scarce resources. In contrast, social identity theory posits a psychological drive for positively distinct social identities as the general root cause of in-group favoring behavior.

== Origins of the research tradition ==
In 1906, the sociologist William Sumner posited that humans are a species that join together in groups by their very nature. However, he also maintained that humans had an innate tendency to favor their own group over others, proclaiming how &quot;each group nourishes its own pride and vanity, boasts itself superior, exists in its own divinities, and looks with contempt on outsiders&quot;. This is seen on the group level with ingroup–outgroup bias. When experienced in larger groups such as tribes, ethnic groups, or nations, it is referred to as ethnocentrism.

== Explanations ==
=== Competition ===
Realistic conflict theory (or realistic group conflict) posits that competition between groups for resources is the cause of in-group bias and the corresponding negative treatment of members of the out-group. Muzafer Sherif&#x27;s Robbers Cave Experiment is the most widely known demonstration of realistic conflict theory. In the experiment, 22 eleven-year-old boys with similar backgrounds were studied in a mock summer camp situation, with researchers posing as camp personnel.

The boys were divided into two equal groups and encouraged to bond, with the aim of fostering an in-group mentality. The researchers then introduced a series of competitive activities which pitted groups against each other for a valuable prize. Hostility and out-group negativity ensued. Lastly, researchers attempted to reverse the hostility by engaging the boys in situations of mutual interdependence, an effort which eventually resulted in relative harmony between the two groups.

Sherif concluded from this experiment that negative attitudes toward out-groups arise when groups compete for limited resources. However, he also theorized that inter-group frictions could be reduced and positive relations created, but only in the presence of an overarching goal, which could only be achieved with the two groups&#x27; cooperation.

=== Self-esteem ===
According to social identity theory, as well as terror management theory, one of the key determinants of group biases is the need to improve self-esteem. The desire to view one&#x27;s self positively is transferred onto the group, creating a tendency to view one&#x27;s own group in a positive light, and by comparison, outside groups in a negative light. That is, individuals will find a reason, no matter how insignificant, to prove to themselves why their own group is superior. This phenomenon was pioneered and studied most extensively by Henri Tajfel, a British social psychologist who looked at the psychological root of in-group/out-group bias. To study this in the lab, Tajfel and colleagues created minimal groups (see minimal group paradigm), which occur when &quot;complete strangers are formed into groups using the most trivial criteria imaginable&quot;. In Tajfel&#x27;s studies, participants were split into groups by flipping a coin, and each group then was told to appreciate a certain style of painting none of the participants were familiar with when the experiment began. What Tajfel and his colleagues discovered was that—regardless of the facts that a) participants did not know each other, b) their groups were completely meaningless, and c) none of the participants had any inclination as to which &quot;style&quot; they like better—participants almost always &quot;liked the members of their own group better and they rated the members of their in-group as more likely to have pleasant personalities&quot;. By having a more positive impression of individuals in the in-group, individuals are able to boost their own self-esteem as members of that group.

Robert Cialdini and his research team looked at the number of university T-shirts being worn on college campuses following either a win or loss at the football game. They found that the Monday after a win, there were more T-shirts being worn, on average, than following a loss.

In another set of studies, done in the 1980s by Jennifer Crocker and colleagues using the minimal group paradigm, individuals with high self-esteem who suffered a threat to the self-concept exhibited greater ingroup biases than did people with low self-esteem who suffered a threat to the self-concept. While some studies have supported this notion of a negative correlation between self-esteem and in-group bias, other researchers have found that individuals with low self-esteem showed more bias toward both in-group and out-group members. Some studies have even shown that high-self-esteem groups showed more bias than did lower self-esteem groups. This research may suggest that there is an alternative explanation and additional reasoning as to the relationship between self-esteem and in-group/out-group biases. Alternatively, it is possible that researchers have used the wrong sort of self-esteem measures to test the link between self-esteem and in-group bias (global personal self-esteem rather than specific social self-esteem).

=== Biological basis as an effect of oxytocin ===

In a meta-analysis and review of the effect of oxytocin on social behavior done by Carsten De Dreu, the research reviewed shows that oxytocin enables the development of trust, specifically towards individuals with similar characteristics—categorized as &#x27;in-group&#x27; members—promoting cooperation with and favoritism towards such individuals. This bias of oxytocin-induced goodwill towards those with features and characteristics perceived to be similar may have evolved as a biological basis for sustaining in-group cooperation and protection, fitting with the Darwinian insight that acts of self-sacrifice and cooperation contribute to the functioning of the group and hence improve the odds of survival for members of said group.

Race can be used as an example of in-group and out-group tendencies because society often categorizes individuals into groups based on race (Caucasian, African American, Latino, etc.). One study that examined race and empathy found that participants receiving nasally administered oxytocin had stronger reactions to pictures of in-group members making pained faces than to pictures of out-group members with the same expression. This shows that oxytocin may be implicated in our ability to empathize with individuals of different races, with individuals of one race potentially biased towards helping individuals of the same race than individuals of another race when they are experiencing pain.

Oxytocin has also been implicated in lying when lying would prove beneficial to other in-group members. In a study where such a relationship was examined, it was found that when individuals were administered oxytocin, rates of dishonesty in the participants&#x27; responses increased for their in-group members when a beneficial outcome for their group was expected. Both of these examples show the tendency to act in ways that benefit in-group members.

=== Self-identity and social identity ===

As noted in two recent theoretical reviews, the theoretical basis for the inclusion of self-identity in the theories of reasoned action and planned behavior has many similarities to social identity theory and its extension, self-categorization theory. According to social identity theory, an important component of the self-concept is derived from memberships in social groups and categories. When people define and evaluate themselves in terms of a self-inclusive social category (e.g., sex, class, team) two processes come into play: (1) categorization, which perceptually accentuates differences between the in-group and out-group, and similarities among in-group members (including the self) on stereotypical dimensions; and (2) self-enhancement which, because the self-concept is defined in terms of group membership, seeks behaviorally and perceptually to favor the in-group over the out-group. Social identities are cognitively represented as group prototypes that describe and prescribe beliefs, attitudes, feelings and behaviors that optimize a balance between minimization of in-group differences and maximization of intergroup differences.

More specifically, according to social identity theory, there is a continuum between personal and social identity shifts along this continuum that determine the extent to which group-related or personal characteristics influence a person&#x27;s feelings and actions. If a particular social identity is a salient basis for self-conception, then the self is assimilated to the perceived in-group prototype which can be thought of as a set of perceived in-group norms such that self-perception, beliefs, attitudes, feelings and behaviors are defined in terms of the group prototype. Thus, social identities should influence behavior through the mediating role of group norms. People will be more likely to engage in a particular behavior if it is in accord with the norms of a behaviorally relevant group membership, particularly if the identity is a salient basis for self-definition. If the group membership is not salient, then people&#x27;s behavior and feelings should be in accord with their own personal and idiosyncratic characteristics rather than group norms.

On the other hand, the self-identity theory poses that the self is often a reflection of expected norms and practices in a person&#x27;s social role. At the center of it is the proposition that the self is made up of multi-faceted and differentiated components that exist in an organized manner for the sake of filling in roles in society. People are able to create an identity for themselves only through talking to others, and often what roles they are taking on differ from one group to another. These differing roles and positions people fill are a result of their interactions with others and are called role identities. Role identities may be self-realized, or may be facts like being a mother, a social worker, or a blood donor. Role identities lead people to act in certain ways due to assumed expectations for the roles. Because there is satisfaction in complying with expectations of the role, there is often distress behind an inability to appear congruent to one&#x27;s identity as defined by societal norms. There is also an existing hierarchy of importance for roles that individuals take on, and according to the hierarchical standing of roles, people become more representative of roles that stand higher hierarchically, according to them.

Identity salience, the likelihood of role identities being invoked in different situations, is the result of role identities being placed hierarchically in different orders from person to person. People who hold the same roles may act differently because some roles are valued over others. For example, a working mother may have less time to spend with her child as opposed to a mother that does not work. Behaviors are reflective of the identities that are held higher hierarchically by people, so people act out in self-worth and self-meaning according to these hierarchies. Someone who holds the identity of being a psychologist higher than the identity of being a linguist will find that while he/she may become competitive when meeting another person that is better at psychology than he/she, he/she will not care when in contact with someone who is much better at being a linguist than he/she. In a similar way, social relationships are influenced by this salience. Self-identity often places individuals in social contexts and a commitment to the role within that context becomes a big part of perpetrating the idea of self. It also finds people relating more to others that hold similar role identities at the top of their hierarchies.

Because people have self-concepts that are derived from a role they define for themselves within the context of a group, when staying within their roles, intergroup similarities are accentuated while intergroup differences are diminished. In an attempt to assimilate oneself according to the tendencies of a group, often people reconfigure their intragroup representations or identities. Certain prototypes form about these groups that reaffirm rules that members of the group are encouraged to follow. Shared information and views are discussed more often than novel and unshared information within a group, therefore a norm is established where the majority views are perpetuated and others silenced. This norm is fluid and changing according to different contexts, but those within the group who want to keep up with the majority views in all matters have to keep an active role in affirming the views of the in-group in contest to out-groups.

=== Neuroscience of social categorization ===
Various neural correlates are impacted by group membership, which can shed light on the development of biases toward in-group members. The brain plays a critical role in how individuals classify themselves and others into groups based on personal attributes, as explained by the social identity theory.

Research shows that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) region displays increased activity when individuals engage in group categorization. This increased activity in this brain region is activated because people tend to focus on the positive qualities of their group. This increased brain activity has been linked to social identity which is a portion of one’s personality that comes from being a member of a specific group. This part of the brain is also activated when we think about personal qualities. People tend to want to feel good about themselves and base their personality on the groups they are part of. People then focus on the positives of their group which leads to people favoring their group and seeing it better than other groups. If people do this, then they will also feel good about themselves because they perceive themselves as being part of a high-status group.

More specifically, the ventral medial prefrontal cortex becomes active when individuals categorize themselves into groups with whom they already share prior experience which can be based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, or gender. This region of the brain is activated due to emotional social reasoning where self-referential processing leads individuals to view the in-group as closer to the self than the out-group. Emotional social reasoning is also significant with groups of prior experience because the categorizations have developed over a longer duration leading to the development of emotions. Alternatively, the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex is activated when individuals categorize themselves into groups with whom they have no prior experience with such as randomly being divided into teams to compete in a task. In this case, individuals must use abstract social reasoning, a part of the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, to form self-guided ideas for categorical identification. It is important to note that with newly formed groups, individuals do not have an emotional component which is why the ventral medial prefrontal cortex is not activated.

== Evolution of in-groups ==
=== Formation of cultural groups ===
Studies have shown that in-group favoritism arises endogenously, through the formation of cultural groups. Symbolic markers in certain conditions can result in trivial groupings developing into cultural groups. The formation of such cultural groups then results in a higher degree of in-group favoritism.

Efferson, Lalive and Fehr published such a study in 2008, utilizing a series of coordination games to mimic cooperation between individuals. The study found that cultural groups were able to form endogenously through creation of a linkage between a payoff-relevant behavior and a payoff-irrelevant marker. Subsequently, in-group favoritism occurred in ensuing social interactions.

Participants were first divided into one of several populations of ten people, and then further divided into subpopulations of five. Each group had different payoff for coordinating on one of two choices, behavior A or behavior B. In group 1, participants were awarded 41 points for coordinating (choosing A themselves and choosing another participant who also chose A) on A and 21 for coordinating on B. The payoffs were switched in the second group. In both groups participants were awarded just 1 point for mis-coordinating. During each turn participants were also allowed to choose a payoff-irrelevant marker (circle or triangle). Players from both subpopulations were mixed to create a coordination problem, and every turn, an unidentified player from each subpopulation would be randomly switched.

The experiment created a situation in which participants were strongly incentivized to develop a sense of expected behaviors in his or her subpopulation, but occasionally would find themselves in a totally new situation in which their behaviors were not in-line with social norms.

The results showed that players generally developed an inclination to pair behavior with a marker, especially if it had resulted in a positive payoff. As linkages at an individual level increase, covariation (of marker and behavior) at an aggregate level also increases. In the experiment, there was a significant increase in participants requesting for partners with the same-shape choice as it progressed, although the initial choice of shape had no effect on payoffs. Toward the end of the experiment, this number stood at a substantial 87%, indicating the presence of in-group favoritism.

Their study supported the hypothesis that the formation of cultural groups alters selective pressure facing individuals, and thus leads to certain behavioral traits being advantageous. Thus, if such selective pressures were present in past civilizations, where membership in a certain group is correlated with a certain behavioral norm, the emergence of in-group biases where it is beneficial to act in differing manners to members of the same group is certainly plausible.

== Racial and ethnic differences ==
In the United States political candidates sharing racial and ethnic background was extremely or very important for 25% of Black Americans, for 17% of Hispanic Americans, 16% of Asian American, and 5% of White Americans according to a 2023 Pew Research Center study.

== Gender differences ==

=== Automatic bias for own gender ===

Rudman and Goodwin conducted research on gender bias that measured gender preferences without directly asking the participants. Subjects at Purdue and Rutgers University participated in computerized tasks that measured automatic attitudes based on how quickly a person categorizes pleasant and unpleasant attributes with each gender. Such a task was done to discover whether people associate pleasant words (good, happy, and sunshine) with women, and unpleasant words (bad, trouble, and pain) with men.

This research found that while both women and men have more favorable views of women, women&#x27;s in-group biases were 4.5 times stronger than those of men and only women (not men) showed cognitive balance among in-group bias, identity, and self-esteem, revealing that men lack a mechanism that bolsters automatic preference for their own gender.

In a 2023 United States study 22% of women and 13% of men found at least somewhat important that political candidates share their gender.

=== Competition ===
Using a public goods game, Van Vugt, De Cremer, and Janssen found that men contributed more to their group in the face of outside competition from another group; there was no distinct difference amongst women&#x27;s contributions.

=== Ethnicity-based favoritism ===
In 2001 Fershtman and Gneezy found that men showed in-group biases in a &quot;trust&quot; game based on ethnicity, whereas this tendency was not present in women. The study aims to identify ethnic discrimination in Israeli Jewish society, and was conducted on 996 Israeli undergraduates. Groups were separated based on whether the participant&#x27;s name was typically ethnically Eastern or Ashkenazic. Similar to a dictator game, subjects were instructed to divide a sum of money (20 NIS) between themselves and another player. Player A was told that any money sent over to Player B would be tripled, and Player B would receive details of the experiment, including the name of Player A and the transferred sum. Subsequently, Player B would have a choice of whether to send any money back.

The experiment found that despite sharing similar average transfer values (10.63 for women and 11.42 for men), women did not display significant in-group biases when it came to recipients with either Ashkenazic or Eastern sounding names. However, a bias against Eastern sounding names was present amongst men.

Furthermore, men showed more bias for Ashkenazic men compared to women, but the opposite was true for Eastern names. This result may seem counter-intuitive, as participants appear to share more in common if they were both male. Thus, we would expect Eastern females to be more marginalized, but is actually consistent with other studies which studied discrimination against Afro-American women.

=== Developmental age ===
In 2008 Fehr, Bernhard, and Rockenbach, in a study conducted on children, found that boys displayed in-group favoritism from ages 3–8, whereas girls did not display such tendencies. The experiment involved usage of an &quot;envy game&quot;, a modified version of the dictator game. A possible explanation posited by researchers relied on an evolutionary basis.

They theorized that parochialism and favoring members of the same group may have been particularly advantageous as it strengthened the individuals group position in intergroup conflicts. As males were the ones who were frequently at the forefront of such conflicts in the past, and thus bore the majority of the costs of conflicts in terms of injury or death, evolution may have favored a greater sensitivity in males in situations which resulted in an advantageous payoff for their in-group. Thus males tended to show in-group biases from a younger age than females, as was evident in the experiment.

== Other examples ==
=== Armenian Genocide denial ===

A 2013 study found that Turks with a stronger in-group bias were less likely to acknowledge the in-group responsibility for the Armenian genocide.

=== 2008 US Presidential elections ===
A study conducted during the 2008 Presidential elections showcased how group identities were dynamic. The study was carried out among 395 Democrats from Cambridge, MA, using an Economics dictator game. Subjects were given $6 to divide between themselves and another person. The recipients remained anonymous, apart from which candidate they supported in the Democratic Primaries.

Data were collected in three separate periods. June 10 to 18 (after Hillary Clinton&#x27;s concession speech on June 7); August 9 to 14, before the Democratic National Convention on the 25; and September 2 to 5, in the buildup to the Presidential elections. The results showed that men displayed significant in-group favoritism from June all the way to the DNC in August. This in-group bias, however, was not present in September. Women displayed no significant in-group favoritism throughout.

The experiment suggested that group identities are flexible and can change over time. Researchers theorized that in-group bias was strong in June, as the competition to be the Democratic nominee in the elections was still recent and thus salient. A lack of actual electoral conflict (against the Republicans) caused perception of salient groupings to remain throughout August. Only in September did the in-group favoritism subside as a superordinate goal shared between groups was now present.

=== Wikipedia ===
Research analyzing articles about 35 inter-group conflicts (e.g., Falklands War) by comparing the corresponding language versions of Wikipedia (e.g., English, Spanish) found evidence for in-group favoritism: While the &quot;in-group&quot; was systematically preferred and presented in a more favorable light, the &quot;out-group&quot; was presented as more immoral and more responsible for the conflict. There were substantial variations between conflicts, however, and additional analyses revealed in-group favoritism to be more pronounced in more recent conflicts and in articles written predominantly by &quot;in-group&quot; members.

== Versus out-group negativity ==

Social psychologists have long made the distinction between ingroup favoritism and outgroup negativity, where outgroup negativity is the act of punishing or placing burdens upon the outgroup. Indeed, a significant body of research exists that attempts to identify the relationship between ingroup favoritism and outgroup negativity, as well as conditions that will lead to outgroup negativity. For example, Struch and Schwartz found support for the predictions of belief congruence theory. The belief congruence theory concerns itself with the degree of similarity in beliefs, attitudes, and values &quot;perceived&quot; to exist between individuals. This theory also states that dissimilarity increases negative orientations towards others. When applied to racial discrimination, the belief congruence theory argues that the perceived dissimilarity of beliefs has more of an impact on racial discrimination than does race itself.

Research finds evidence of in-group bias in police investigations and judicial decisions.

=== Biological relationship ===
Oxytocin is not only correlated with the preferences of individuals to associate with members of their own group, but it is also evident during conflicts between members of different groups. During conflict, individuals receiving nasally administered oxytocin demonstrate more frequent defense-motivated responses toward in-group members than out-group members. Further, oxytocin was correlated with participant desire to protect vulnerable in-group members, despite that individual&#x27;s attachment to the conflict. Similarly, it has been demonstrated that when oxytocin is administered, individuals alter their subjective preferences in order to align with in-group ideals over out-group ideals. These studies demonstrate that oxytocin is associated with intergroup dynamics.

Further, oxytocin influences the responses of individuals in a particular group to those of another group. The in-group bias is evident in smaller groups; however, it can also be extended to groups as large as one&#x27;s entire country leading toward a tendency of strong national zeal. A study done in the Netherlands showed that oxytocin increased the in-group favoritism of their nation while decreasing acceptance of members of other ethnicities and foreigners. People also show more affection for their country&#x27;s flag while remaining indifferent to other cultural objects when exposed to oxytocin. It has thus been hypothesized that this hormone may be a factor in xenophobic tendencies secondary to this effect. Thus, oxytocin appears to affect individuals at an international level where the in-group becomes a specific &quot;home&quot; country and the out-group grows to include all other countries.

== In-group derogation ==
Cross-cultural studies have found that in-group derogation, the tendency to criticize members of one&#x27;s own group or culture more harshly than members of outside groups, is more common among members of disadvantaged and minority groups than among members of the majority or dominant group. According to Ma-Kellams, Spencer-Rodgers and Peng, system justification theory seeks to explain why &quot;minorities sometimes endorse system-justifying views of their group&quot;. They said their research into in-group favoritism and derogation partially supported this theory, but that the theory failed to address all of the nuances.

Ma-Kellams et al. also found that, compared to individualist cultures, people from collectivist cultures, such as East Asian cultures, tended to judge their own group members less favorably than they judged outsiders, whereas people from individualist cultures were inclined to judge members of their own group more favorably than they judged outsiders. Social identity theory and Freudian theorists explain in-group derogation as the result of a negative self-image, which they believe is then extended to the group. Ma-Kellams et al. theorized that &quot;ingroup derogation may be more culturally normative and less troubling for East Asians&quot; as evidenced by the fact that East Asians were also likely to report high levels of positive affect (emotion) towards members of their in-group, demonstrating ambivalence towards the unfavorable characteristics they had acknowledged about their in-group. According to Ma-Kellam et al., culturally-ingrained attitudes and beliefs, rather than low self-esteem, may play a role in collectivist cultures&#x27; in-group derogation, due to their ability to tolerate holding seemingly contradictory views.

<text>Jack Whyte (March 15, 1940February 22, 2021) was a Scottish-Canadian novelist of historical fiction. Born and raised in Scotland, he moved to Canada in 1967. He resided in Kelowna, British Columbia.

==Early life==
Whyte was born in Scotland on March 15, 1940. He resided there until relocating to Canada in 1967. He was employed at a local school for one year, where he taught English. He subsequently worked as an author, musician, and actor. He and his wife, Beverley, initially lived in Alberta before settling in Kelowna in 1996.

==Writings==
Whyte&#x27;s major work was a series of historical novels retelling the story of King Arthur against the backdrop of Roman Britain. This version of the popular legend eschews the use of magic to explain Arthur&#x27;s ascent to power and instead relies on the historical condition (with some artistic licence) of post-Roman Britain to support the theory that Arthur was meant to counter the anarchy left by the Roman departure from Britain in 410 AD and the subsequent colonization and invasion of Britain by various peoples from Northwestern Europe, including the Saxons, Jutes, Franks, and Angles. Whyte incorporates traditional Arthurian names, places and events (albeit in Gaelic or Latin form) as well as the names of various historical figures that have been suggested as being the possible basis for the original King Arthur legend. The tacit implication is that Whyte&#x27;s version of history is the true story that has become distorted over time to become the legend and stories of magic that we know today. The series has been published in different locations under three different titles. In Canada it was titled &quot;A Dream of Eagles&quot;, while in the United States it was retitled &quot;The Camulod Chronicles&quot;. When it was eventually republished in Great Britain with a different reading order, it became &quot;Legends of Camelot&quot;.

Whyte served as the official bard of The Calgary Highlanders and performed several tracks of poetry and song on the 1990 recording by the Regimental Pipes and Drums of The Calgary Highlanders entitled &quot;Eighty Years of Glory: The Regimental Pipes, Drums and Bard of The Calgary Highlanders.&quot;

==&quot;Camulod Chronicles&quot;==
===&quot;A Dream of Eagles&quot; (&quot;Camulod Chronicles&quot; or &quot;Legends of Camelot&quot;)===

<doc id="860018" wikidata="Q7225322" url="?curid=860018" title="Politics of Queensland">
<text>One of the six founding states of Australia, Queensland has been a federated state subject to the Australian Constitution since 1 January 1901. It is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy. The constitution of Queensland sets out the operation of the state&#x27;s government. The state&#x27;s constitution contains several entrenched provisions which cannot be changed in the absence of a referendum. There is also a statutory bill of rights, the &quot;Queensland Human Rights Act 2019&quot;. Queensland&#x27;s system of government is influenced by the Westminster system and Australia&#x27;s federal system of government.

The powers of the state can be classified into three types:
* Legislature: the unicameral Parliament of Queensland, comprising the Legislative Assembly and the Monarch (represented by the Governor);
* Executive: the Queensland Government, consisting of the Executive Council of Queensland, which formalises decisions of the Cabinet of Queensland, which is composed of the Premier and other ministers of state appointed by the Governor on the advice of the premier;
* Judiciary: the Supreme Court and other state courts, whose judges are appointed by the Governor on advice of the attorney-general.

However, unlike the Commonwealth level of government or the United States, there is no legally enforceable separation of powers. The only restriction is that state parliaments may not abolish or impermissably interfere with the institutional integrity of supreme (or other) courts under the Kable doctrine.

==Legislature==

Legislative authority is formally held by the monarch acting with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly (i.e King-in-parliament). These two bodies together form the Parliament of Queensland, which uniquely for Australian states is unicameral, containing only one house, the Legislative Assembly. The Parliament was bicameral until 1922, when the Legislative Council was abolished by the Labor &quot;suicide squad&quot;, so called because they were appointed for the purpose of voting to abolish their own offices. Bills receive royal assent from the governor before being passed into law. The Parliament&#x27;s normally sits at the Parliament House at Gardens Point in Brisbane&#x27;s CBD, however regional sittings also take place. Members of the Legislative Assembly represent 93 electoral districts under fixed four year terms, with elections utilising full preferential voting.

==Executive==

Executive authority is formally exercised by the Governor of Queensland (currently Jeannette Young) as the representative of the monarch (currently King Charles III). However, except for certain reserve powers, the governor only acts in accordance with the advice of the Premier of Queensland. The premier (who is the state&#x27;s head of government) along with the Cabinet of Queensland (whose decisions are given legal force by the Executive Council), exercise executive authority in practice. The premier is appointed by the governor and must have support of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. The premier is in practice a leading member of the Legislative Assembly and parliamentary leader of his or her political party, or coalition of parties, and members of Cabinet will be drawn from the same party or coalition. The current Premier and Deputy Premier are David Crisafulli and Jarrod Bleijie of the Liberal National Party of Queensland respectively. Government House at Paddington in Brisbane is the residence of the Governor, having replaced Old Government House at Gardens Point in Brisbane&#x27;s CBD in the early 20th century.

==Judiciary==

The state&#x27;s judiciary consists of the Supreme Court of Queensland and the District Court of Queensland, established by the Queensland Constitution, as well as the Magistrates Court of Queensland and other courts and tribunals established by legislation. Cases may be appealed to the High Court of Australia. As with all Australian states and territories, Queensland has a common law legal system. The supreme and district courts are headquartered at the Queen Elizabeth II Courts of Law in Brisbane&#x27;s CBD.

The Supreme Court of Queensland, Trial Division, is the highest original jurisdiction, and the Court of Appeal is the highest appellate jurisdiction within Queensland. The current chief justice is Catherine Holmes. The High Court of Australia hears appeals from the court of appeal.

===Magistrates Court===

The Magistrates Court is a lower court of the judicial hierarchy of Queensland. The court&#x27;s criminal jurisdiction covers summary offences, and indictable offences which may be heard summarily, but all criminal proceedings in Queensland begin in the Magistrates Court, even if they are not within this jurisdiction. For charges beyond its jurisdiction, the court conducts committal hearings in which the presiding magistrate decides, based on the strength of the evidence, whether to refer the matter to a higher court or dismiss it. The court&#x27;s civil jurisdiction covers matters in which the amount in dispute is less than or equal to $150,000. Appeals against decisions by the Magistrates Court are heard by the District Court.

===District Court===

The District Court is the middle tier of the judicial hierarchy of Queensland. The court has jurisdiction to hear all appeals from decisions made in the Magistrates Court. Its criminal jurisdiction covers serious indictable offences (such as armed robbery, rape, and dangerous driving). The court&#x27;s civil jurisdiction covers matters in which the amount in dispute is more than $150,000 but less than or equal to $750,000. Appeals against decisions by the District Court are heard by the Court of Appeal, a division of the Supreme Court.

===Supreme Court===

The Supreme Court is the highest tier of the judicial hierarchy in Queensland. The court has two divisions; the Trial Division and the Court of Appeal. The Trial Division&#x27;s jurisdiction covers serious criminal offences (including murder and manslaughter), and civil matters involving claims of more than $750,000. The Court of Appeal&#x27;s jurisdiction allows it to hear cases on appeal from the Trial Division, the District Court, and a number of other judicial tribunals in Queensland. Appeals against decisions by the Court of Appeal are heard by the High Court of Australia.

==Local government==

Local government is the mechanism by which local government areas can manage their own affairs to the extent permitted by the Local Government Act 2009. Queensland is divided into 77 local government areas, which are created by the state government under legislation. Each local government area has a council responsible for providing a range of local services and utilities. Local councils derive their income from both rates and charges on resident ratepayers, and grants and subsidies from the state and federal governments.

==Federal representation==
In the federal Parliament of Australia, Queensland accounts for 30 of the 151 electoral divisions in the House of Representatives (on the basis of population size) and 12 of the 76 seats in the Senate (on the basis of equality between the states).

The current partisan makeup of Queensland&#x27;s House of Representatives delegation is 21 Liberal National, 5 Labor, 3 Greens and 1 Katter&#x27;s Australian Party.

The current partisan makeup of Queensland&#x27;s Senate delegation is 5 Liberal National, 3 Labor, 2 One Nation and 2 Green.

==Idiosyncrasies==
The state&#x27;s politics are traditionally regarded as being conservative relative to other states. Historically, a gerrymander favouring rural electoral districts and the lack of an upper house has meant that Queensland had a long tradition of domination by strong-willed, populist premiers, often accused of authoritarian tendencies, holding office for long periods. This tendency was exemplified by the government of the state&#x27;s longest-serving Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen.

While most Australian states have over 60% of their populations concentrated in the capital cities, Brisbane accounts for about half of Queensland&#x27;s population. This relative decentralisation of the population made the state a stronghold for the National Party. Before the merger of the Queensland branches of the Liberals and Nationals as the Liberal National Party, the National Party had been the senior partner in the non-Labor Coalition since 1924. In other states and federally, the long-standing coalition between the Nationals and Liberals typically has the National Party as the junior partner.

==Recent history==

In the 1989 state election environmental issues like rainforest protection were prominent, especially in Far North Queensland, contributing to the success of the ALP at the time. The dramatic collapse in support for the Goss government resulted in its returning from the 1995 general election with a majority of only one seat. This in turn was subsequently lost after the controversial and closely fought Mundingburra by-election. The Nationals formed minority government after securing the support of independent Liz Cunningham, with Rob Borbidge becoming Premier.

In stark contrast to some of his predecessors, Borbidge&#x27;s government was not markedly domineering. However, controversies such as public service purges, disputes with the Criminal Justice Commission, and other scandals did do some damage to the government.

Events were superseded by the meteoric rise of controversial federal politician Pauline Hanson. Especially popular in her native Queensland, Hanson&#x27;s decision to form her own political party (Pauline Hanson&#x27;s One Nation) was greeted with apprehension by all the other parties, in particular the Nationals striving to maintain their rural conservative heartland. In 1998, a bitter dispute broke out within and between the Liberal and National parties over whether One Nation candidates should be ranked lower on how-to-vote cards than Labor candidates. Eventually, the Nationals decided to place Labor behind One Nation. This move backfired spectacularly in the election, with the urban Liberal vote deserting to Labor and an unexpectedly high One Nation primary vote of just under 23%, giving the party 11 seats in parliament. Labor attained 44 seats, one short of a majority, and achieved government with the support of Cunningham and new independent Peter Wellington.

The new minority government managed to secure itself a majority in a by-election and was dominated overwhelmingly by the self-confessed &quot;media tart&quot; Peter Beattie. A major controversy broke in 2001 on the eve of the election, when a number of very prominent Labor Party figures were implicated in rorting internal preselection and party ballots. The subsequent Shepardson Commission of Inquiry was widely expected to destroy the government. Beattie immediately undertook a purge, taking the opportunity to dispatch several factional enemies, and promised a &quot;cleanskin&quot; approach.

To the surprise of many, Beattie&#x27;s public contrition was overwhelmingly popular, and in contrast to its previous tenuous hold on power, the government won a massive majority of 66 seats, with the Liberal Party reduced to only three seats.

In February 2004, The Beattie Labor team was again returned to government with 63 seats, National Party 15 seats, the Liberal Party five seats, one One Nation and five independents. This election saw the continual decline of the once conspicuous One Nation party from three seats in 2001 and 11 seats in 1998. It also saw the entrenched status of the Queensland ALP with its untouchable majority, despite allegations of bullying by senior Ministers, improper private use of public vehicles, the &quot;Winegate&quot; affair involving first-time Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Liddy Clark, and the government&#x27;s repeated use of freedom of information laws to prevent the publication of potentially damaging information. Some notable outcomes of the 2004 election were the unseating of Labor Minister, Merri Rose, with a two-party swing of 15 points following her involvement in the use of a government vehicle by her son for private purposes, and the victory in former National Party Premier Rob Borbidge&#x27;s seat, Surfers Paradise, by the Liberal Candidate, John-Paul Langbroek. Following the 2004 election, the National and Liberal parties ended their coalition and the Liberal party became a minor party on the back benches.

2005 saw a similar landscape for Queensland politics as 2004: increasing allegations that the Labor government lacked accountability and that the opposition lacked ability to hold the government to account. The once unstoppable National–Liberal coalition remained in tatters as the parties continued their war of words over who held the greatest chance of electoral success in the one-time National Party heartland of the Gold Coast. The Liberal Party was adamant that it had better electoral prospects by distancing itself from the National party despite the National Party holding three times as many seats. The premier instigated an independent inquiry into allegations of medical malpractice at Bundaberg Hospital, and in particular the circumstances behind the engagement of the unqualified doctor, Jayant Patel, more popularly known as &quot;Dr Death&quot;, whose involvement was linked to numerous deaths at the hospital. Opposition parties and community groups protested that the terms of reference were narrow, avoiding investigation into broader allegations of maladministration of Queensland Health and bullying of departmental employees.

The resignations of deputy premier Terry Mackenroth and Speaker Ray Hollis triggered by-elections in the electorates of Chatsworth and Redcliffe on 20 August 2005. Both of the formerly safe Labor seats were lost and Liberal candidates Michael Caltabiano and Terry Rogers were elected as the new members for Chatsworth and Redcliffe respectively.

Following the announcement that Nita Cunningham would be retiring because of cancer, Premier Beattie called a general election for 9 September 2006. The Coalition failed to promote a united team under Lawrence Springborg MP, ready to assume government following a failed attempt to merge to the National Party into the Queensland Liberal Party earlier in the year. With the election due to be called any day, the Liberal Party surprised the public by ejecting long-standing leader, Bob Quinn, and electing Bruce Flegg MP as leader of the Liberal Party.

The election campaign started badly for the Coalition when in the opening days, Flegg was unable to clearly articulate the Coalition position should the Liberals achieve a majority in their party on winning government, and continued with numerous gaffes which were keenly covered by the media. The Coalition found it difficult to gain momentum after these initial blunders and despite a number of real issues to take the government to task over concerning infrastructure, the health system and water, the media remained focused on the personal leadership skills of the Coalition&#x27;s front men. The ALP campaigned on the theme of a solid leadership team and this was overwhelming endorsed at the polls.

A second attempt at merging the Liberal and National parties was successful with the Liberal National Party being formed in 2008 with former Nationals leader Lawrence Springborg elected as its inaugural leader. Despite a swing towards it, the new Liberal National Party was defeated by the Labor Party, now led by Premier Anna Bligh, in 2009. In 2011 the Liberal Nationals elected Brisbane Lord Mayor Campbell Newman as its new leader. This led to an unusual circumstance in Australian politics, as Newman was not a member of the Legislative Assembly and was, therefore, unable to become the Leader of the Opposition. As a result former state Nationals&#x27; leader Jeff Seeney was elected interim opposition leader while Newman headed the party&#x27;s election team from outside the legislature.

The 2012 election saw the Liberal National Party defeat Labor in one of the biggest landslides in Australian history, winning 49.65% of the primary vote and 78 of 89 seats, leaving the ALP with seven seats (26.66% of the primary vote), the newly formed Katter&#x27;s Australian Party winning two seats, and the remaining seats won by independents. Campbell Newman was also successful in entering the Legislative Assembly by defeating Labor incumbent Kate Jones in the seat of Ashgrove.
In 2007, the Queensland Parliament had the highest female parliamentary representation in Australia and the third highest in the world, with 30 out of 89 members having been women. After the 2012 election, Queensland now has the lowest female parliamentary representation in Australia. The LNP government rejected planning policy as a means to address environmental issues. They made the focus of planning throughout Queensland prioritise economic growth only.

Despite its landslide win, the Liberal National Party did not last long in government; it suffered a swing of 14.0% against it at the 2015 state election, while Campbell Newman became the second premier in Queensland history to be defeated in his own seat, by previous incumbent Kate Jones. Coincidentally, this happened almost 100 years after Digby Denham became the first premier to lose his seat when he was defeated in the seat of Oxley by Labor candidate Thomas Llewellyn Jones in 1915. Labor, led by Opposition Leader Annastacia Palaszczuk, won 44 seats and the backing of independent MP Peter Wellington and formed a minority government.

At the 2017 Queensland state election the LNP suffered a 7% swing against it with the Palaszczuk Labor government winning a second term.

The 2020 Queensland state election saw the Palaszczuk Labor government win a third term. Her win meant she will be the longest-serving Australian female head of government as of mid-2021.

<text>The Lincoln Futura is a concept car promoted by Ford&#x27;s Lincoln brand, designed by Ford&#x27;s lead stylists Bill Schmidt and John Najjar, and hand-built by Ghia in Turin, Italy, at a cost of $250,000 (equivalent to $ in 2025).

Displayed on the auto show circuit in 1955, the Futura was modified by George Barris into the Batmobile, for the 1966 TV series &quot;Batman&quot;.

==History==
The idea for the Futura came from designer Bill Schmidt, who got the idea while he was diving, after an encounter with a shark.

The car&#x27;s official public debut was on January 8, 1955, at the Chicago Auto Show; it had been shown to the press at the city&#x27;s Congress Hotel on January 5. While being displayed elsewhere in the U.S. that spring, the Futura was seen by the country&#x27;s television audience on &quot;Today&quot; (&quot;The Today Show&quot;) on March 3, 1955.
The Futura&#x27;s styling was original by 1950s standards, with a double, clear-plastic canopy top, exaggerated hooded headlight pods, and very large, outward-canted tailfins. The Futura had a complete powertrain and was fully operable, in contrast to many show cars. Its original color was a pearlescent white, created by one of the first pearlescent color treatments. To achieve the effect Bill Schmidt wanted, Ghia ground and pulverized the scales of thousands of fish and mixed them into the paint.

The Futura was powered by a 368 cubic inch Lincoln engine and powertrain; the chassis was an early prototype Y-shaped backbone perimeter frame that would go into production on the 1956–1957 Continental Mark II.

The Futura was a success as a show car, garnering favorable publicity for Ford. It was released as a model kit and a toy, and, in a much more subdued form, its headlight and tailfin motifs would appear on production Lincolns for 1956 and 1957, such as the Lincoln Premiere and Lincoln Capri. The concave front grille inspired the grille on the 1960 Mercury Monterey and the 1960 Ford Galaxie.

The styling showed a progression from the Mercury XM-800 introduced in 1954.

==Media appearances==
The Futura played a prominent part in the 1959 movie &quot;It Started with a Kiss,&quot; starring Debbie Reynolds and Glenn Ford. For the movie, it was painted red, as the white pearlescent finish did not photograph well.

The red-painted car is also seen in Ford&#x27;s 1961 promotional film &quot;The Secret Door&quot;. The film&#x27;s look inside Ford&#x27;s Styling Center includes footage of the Futura on the test track and in the wind tunnel.

The concept car was subsequently sold to auto customizer George Barris. Having originally cost $250,000, the Futura was sold to Barris for $1 and &quot;other valuable consideration&quot; by Ford Motor Company. As the car was never titled and was therefore uninsurable, it was parked behind Barris&#x27; shop, sitting idle and deteriorating for several years.

The 1994 NBC TV series &quot;Viper&quot; featured a red replica of the 1955 Lincoln Futura called &quot;The Baxley&quot;. In the episode &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot; (S01E08), the car&#x27;s creator stole it after it was recovered by construction workers. There was quite a bit of film featuring the vehicle, even a chase between the Viper Defender and the Futura. There is a YouTube video available of the chase.

=== Batmobile ===

In 1966, Barris was asked to design a theme car for the &quot;Batman&quot; television series. Originally, the auto stylist Dean Jeffries was contracted to build the car for the show in late 1965, but when the studio wanted the car sooner than he could deliver, the project was given to Barris. With the short notice, Barris thought the Futura might work well, and using Jeffries&#x27;s initial car, decided that its unusual, winged shape would be an ideal starting point for the Batmobile. Barris hired Bill Cushenbery to modify the car&#x27;s metalwork.

Barris went on to build three fiberglass replicas using the frames and running gear from 1966 Ford Galaxie cars for the show circuit. Barris later acquired a fourth replica, a metal car built on a 1958 Ford Thunderbird.

Barris retained ownership of the car after its conversion to the Batmobile, leasing it to the TV studio for filming. After production of the TV series ended, it was displayed in Barris&#x27; own museum in California. It has also been displayed in the Cayman Motor Museum on Grand Cayman Island.

Barris sold the Batmobile to Rick Champagne at the Barrett-Jackson collector car auction on Saturday, January 19, 2013, in Scottsdale, Arizona for US$4.62 million.

As of August 2016, Dave Anderson in Fairfax, Virginia, owns the #1 made from the Futura Concept Car and he also owns the #2 car (the first replica that Barris built).

== Replica ==
In the 1990s, Bob Butts (with George Barris&#x27; consent) made replicas of the Batmobile, using a mold of one of the Barris-built replicas. Based on pictures from when the Futura was shown in the 1950s, he reskinned an existing Batmobile replica back into a Lincoln Futura replica. He only created one copy.

The original fiberglass copy shell of the Futura made by Bob Butts was later found by Gotham Garage owner Mark Towle and his friend and actor Shawn Pilot and rebuilt as an original copy of the Lincoln Futura together with his team (Constance Nunes, Tony Quinones, Michael &quot;Caveman&quot; Pyle) in their shop in Temecula, California, as seen in the Netflix series &quot;Car Masters: Rust to Riches&quot;.

When finished, the replica Futura was eventually sold at the Grand National Roadster Show at the Pomona Fairplex for approximately $90,000.

<doc id="860025" wikidata="Q383051" url="?curid=860025" title="Rogers Pass (British Columbia)">
<text>Rogers Pass is a high mountain pass through the Selkirk Mountains of British Columbia, but the term also includes the approaches used by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and the Trans-Canada Highway. In the heart of Glacier National Park, this National Historic Site has been a tourist destination since 1886.

==Topography==
Rogers Pass is the lowest route between the Sir Donald and Hermit ranges of the Selkirks, providing a shortcut along the southern perimeter of the Big Bend of the Columbia River from Revelstoke on the west to Donald, near Golden, on the east.

The pass is formed by the headwaters of the Illecillewaet River to the west and by the Beaver River to the east. These rivers are tributaries of the Columbia, which arcs to the north.

==Railway==
===Proposal &amp; planning===
During the 1870s, when the transcontinental was being planned, the preferred route through the Canadian Rockies was the northerly Yellowhead Pass. After awarding the contract, the government allowed CP to amend the designated crossing to the Kicking Horse Pass. Although believing the change advantageous, hindsight indicates the Yellowhead and CP&#x27;s 1898 Crowsnest Pass would have provided a more economical and strategic combination. Poor judgement best describes this unfortunate decision that created lasting impediments for both the railway and highway.

===Discovery of the pass===

While the transcontinental advanced across the prairies, the railway sought a way over the unexplored Selkirks. In April 1881, CP offered Major A.B. Rogers naming rights and a $5,000 bonus to locate a pass. Walter Moberly had discovered Eagle Pass just to the west, and based on suggestions in Moberly&#x27;s reports, Rogers started out from what is now Revelstoke, up the Illecillewaet River. On May 28, 1881, the party followed a branch of the river past &quot;Syndicate Peak&quot; (now Mount Sir Donald), discovering a large level opening between the mountains where the waters flowed east and west. (Some secondary sources state that Rogers only saw the pass from a distance, but this is contradicted by first-hand reports.) To get a better view of the landscape, Rogers, his nephew A.L. Rogers and some of their Shuswap guides then climbed to the crest of a nearby mountain ridge, later identified as the ridge between Mount Macdonald and Avalanche Mountain. From here they could see the Beaver River valley on the east side of the Selkirks. Running out of food, the party turned back west. Although they had found a pass, they had been unable to explore its eastern approach, a distance of from the junction of the Beaver and Columbia rivers. Returning in 1882 from the east, Rogers followed the Beaver River and Connaught Creek (formerly Bear Creek), and on July 24, 1882, he reached the same pass, confirming its existence and the feasibility of a railway route. Rogers refused to cash the $5,000 cheque, and instead framed it upon his wall until CP General Manager William Cornelius Van Horne offered him a gold watch as an incentive to cash it. Folklore has generated many later variations of this story.

The discovery was due in part to the efforts of Moberly, his assistant Albert Perry and their First Nations guides, who had explored the Illecillewaet River on the west side of the pass fifteen year earlier. In later life Moberly stated that Perry reached the pass in 1866, but there is no contemporaneous evidence for this.

===Planning &amp; construction===
Rogers blindly believed the pass presented no special engineering difficulties. By May 1883, the westward railhead had only reached Medicine Hat, still leaving time to find an alternative to the equally problematic Kicking Horse Pass. Moberly advocated Howse Pass. During the time it took to determine a practicable Kicking Horse/Selkirks route, the railhead had advanced up the Bow Valley making it too late to use Howse, which required an access from the North Saskatchewan River Valley.

Since the immediate capital costs for the Selkirks and Big Bend options were similar, the additional operating costs expected from the increased mileage eliminated the latter. As a general rule, if the interest payable on a capital investment was less than the expected savings on operating costs, CP made the investment. Decisions were a trade-off between immediate costs and delayed costs. Later traffic revenue enabled upgrades.

The acute capital shortage during 1885, meant months of unpaid payroll, and minor strikes. Captain Steele and his small North-West Mounted Police force protected construction manager Ross from confrontations with workers. When the Riel Rebellion drew Steele away, Ross formed his own 25-man armed police force. To survive the capital crisis, infrastructure costs were reduced to a bare minimum. Not only did untreated wooden trestles provide all bridging, but cuttings were of minimum width, track was not ballasted, and no snow sheds were built. Ballasting only occurred three years later. Although accurately predicting construction costs was difficult, especially in a mountainous region, total overruns were reasonable.

The eastern approach up the Beaver River required some of the largest trestles on the line.

In early February 1885, three avalanches struck. At MacKenzie camp, west of the summit, a worker was buried. At McDermot camp, away, three buried men were never found. At the summit, three occupants escaped through a camp store window. Later that month avalanches totally destroyed the store, and buried six men in the vicinity. These slides, followed by heavy summer rainfall, delayed the work. Abandoning the damaged right-of-way on the western slope, north of the river, CP built the switchback Loops well clear of avalanche paths.

The railhead crossed the summit that August. After the last spike ceremony that November, the line was shut down for the winter. After slide damages were repaired, the line opened to through traffic the following June.

===Route===
 Only the crest and eastern slope of the Connaught Tunnel route is underground.
===Early operation===
CP&#x27;s traffic predictions proved largely correct. Contrary claims that early traffic would be mainly eastbound were unfounded, but became a reality within 20 years. Two pusher locomotives, each needing crews, were adequate for each side. However, pusher gradients were expensive to operate. Most loaded freight trains required a single pusher, because they were longer than 9 cars. Wyes were at the Selkirk pushing extremities of Beavermouth (east) and Albert Canyon (west). At the summit, a roundhouse and rail yard existed. Some days no freight trains passed, but on the arrival of a steamer in Vancouver, there could be a quick succession eastward for several days. Double heading replaced rear pushing from 1907. Local traffic was negligible.

Usually, passenger trains did not need pushers, and until 1902, the 5– to 9–car service was daily. On rare occasions, trains were as long as 12 cars. The 1886 average mountain speed of had increased to by 1902. By 1913, to maintain this speed, the 9-car trains required a pusher. Scheduled stops for breakfast, lunch, and dinner existed at Field, Glacier House, and North Bend. Albert Canyon was a scenic stop. The twice daily summer service from 1908 continued into the winter, instead of reducing to one train, and increased to three trains the following summer.

In 1905, CP installed a water-powered bucket system to fill the coal hopper. The next year, the four-locomotive engine house was enlarged to accommodate six locomotives. In 1907, a track deviation created more yard space to handle increased freight. Housing key staff and extensive equipment, the pass functioned as if it were a divisional point. Assigning the most powerful locomotives, the Selkirk section had 12 in 1898 and 18 in 1908. Pushers increased from 5 in 1908 to 11 in 1914. Oil storage facilities were built for the 1912 conversion to oil-fired locomotives in the mountains, eliminating firemen and fire patrols. Additionally, the constant steam pressure increased the tonnage capacity.

In 1915, seven employees received 25-month sentences for creating ghost employees.

One year after the tunnel opening, the right-of-way over the pass was handed over to the Parks Department for a wagon road, and the snow sheds were removed. Some sections of the abandoned railway eventually became walking rail trails in Glacier National Park.

===Avalanches===
The extent and cost of snow sheds had been grossly underestimated. Snow shed construction continued until 1890, but only in places displaying consistent problems, and only where diversions were not a cheaper option. Sheds were patrolled in winter for avalanche damage, and in summer for fires started by smokestacks. An increased section gang shovelled out both slides and drifts. Wing plows could not disperse the really deep snow. A rotary snowplow was shared with Eagle Pass until a dedicated one arrived in February 1890. However, rotaries cannot handle avalanches containing rocks or timber. These combined measures ensured that blockages from 1889/90 onward were nearly always cleared within hours.

The 31 sheds built had a combined length of . During the first 25 years of the line, 200 people died in avalanches. Single avalanches killed 6 employees in 1887, 7 or 8 in 1899, and about 60 in the 1910 catastrophe. The failure to rebuild snow sheds after the prior track deviation, and the inadequate design strength of an existing shed, proved devastating. On at least four occasions, avalanches struck passenger trains in the pass, seemingly causing no passenger injuries.

During summer months, trains ran on separate tracks outside the sheds. Although the tunnel removed the avalanche danger for that section, the problem persisted along neighbouring segments.

===Community===
In 1886, the features of a transient construction community remained. Drinking and gambling characterized the 15 hotels. A single provincial police officer maintained the peace. Transitioning to respectability, formal dances were held. The hamlet of about 50, included two general stores, two hotels, a butcher, a barber, and CP boarding house.

Storekeeper James M. Carroll was postmaster 1890–1892, his store appearing to have barely outlasted his competitor. In 1893, the Queens Hotel, the only one remaining, was renamed the Dewdrop Inn. William Cator, CP agent, was postmaster 1893–1899. In 1899, the population was 25–30, a community newspaper operated, and a school existed. John Taylor, CP agent, was postmaster 1899–1901.

When the station relocated, the community buildings followed suit. Public functions were initially held in the CP boarding house. Residents built a new boarding house for the manager, after she was terminated for not housing scabs during a strike.

C.D. Morris, who opened a store within a tent in 1901, erected a permanent store, boarding house and hall. Lodge, church, and public gatherings used this hall. In 1904, he added 15 or 16 bedrooms and a bathroom to the boarding house to cater for the big summer demand from workers and tourists. He was postmaster 1901–1903.
His store clerk, John O. Forbes, and brother, William B. Morris, later filled the role. A 1910 fire destroyed this hotel/boarding house. The store was saved, but badly scorched. The 1916 fire that destroyed the Morris store and residence preceded the move to the new community of Glacier near the west portal. The school similarly relocated.

===Superseding tunnels===
Beneath Rogers Pass are the Connaught Tunnel (1916) and the Mount Macdonald Tunnel (1988). The former once held, and the latter still holds, the title of longest railway tunnel in North America. Connaught handles eastbound traffic, and Mount Macdonald westbound.
==Trans-Canada Highway==
===Proposal===
In 1908, a new wagon road was built from Laggan. Two decades later, a proper highway linked Lake Louise and Golden. The selection of a Golden–Revelstoke link via the Big Bend, rather than over the Selkirks, was the snowplowing difficulty. This road finally opened in 1940. A proposal to upgrade to Trans-Canada Highway standards a decade later, determined that the Selkirks route would be cheaper, and not conflict with the Columbia River hydro-electric potential.

===Construction &amp; opening===
Constructed 1956–1962, headquarters of the four camps was from the Glacier station. The former schoolhouse was the dining hall, a former railway house the office, and prefabricated cabins housed the employees. Radio reception was poor. Entertainment, such as movies, or a haircut, required train travel to the nearest towns. Similarly, all supplies came in by train for the workforce of about 500 who built the highway.

West of the summit, much of the original route was used. To the east, excavations uncovered the remnants of the roundhouse destroyed by the 1899 slide. The provincial government held an official opening ceremony in July 1962, whereas the federal one was the following September. This scenic route reduced bus travel time by five hours.

===Avalanche control===
Prior to 1962, snow sheds provided the only control measure. Three concrete sheds exist on the eastern slope. To keep the highway and railway open during the winter, the Royal Canadian Artillery has since used howitzers to knock down unstable snow under controlled circumstances to reduce avalanche hazards. Stopping is prohibited in high-risk locations.

===Facilities===
Camping, cabins, and an information centre make up the Glacier park facilities. The Northlander Motor Hotel, opened in 1964, was renamed Glacier Park Lodge. The teal-roofed lodge, restaurant and gas station were the only services for . After expiring in 2010, the lease continued on a month to month basis. The new owners, who acquired the property in 2008, failed to meet their legal obligations to the previous owners, Parks Canada, and others. Parks Canada terminated the lease in 2012. The gas station and lodge, closed in 2009 and 2012 respectively, were both demolished in 2018.

==Non-avalanche accidents &amp; emergencies==
==Climate==
Rogers Pass has a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;) with an average high in January of about and in July of about . With an average snowfall per year, Rogers Pass is among the snowiest places in Canada. Encompassing 134 individual paths in the steep terrain, avalanches are common in winter.

<text>An emergency vehicle is a vehicle used by emergency services. Emergency vehicles typically have specialized emergency lighting and vehicle equipment that allow emergency services to reach calls for service in a timely manner, transport equipment and resources, or perform their tasks efficiently. Emergency vehicles are usually operated by authorized government agencies, but some may also be operated by private entities where permitted by law.

Emergency vehicles are usually given right of way in traffic, and may be exempted from certain basic road laws to reach their destinations in the fastest possible time, such as driving through a red traffic light or exceeding the speed limit; however, this is almost always done with emergency lights and sirens on, to alert traffic that the emergency vehicle is approaching. In some jurisdictions, the driver of an emergency vehicle can face legal action if the driver shows &quot;reckless disregard for the safety of others&quot;.

==Types==
There are many types of emergency vehicles. Which service operates which vehicle depends on the jurisdiction. Examples of emergency vehicles include:

* Police force
** Police car
** Police van
** Police motorcycle
** Police bicycle
** Police armoured vehicle
** Mobile communications vehicle
** Police bus
** Police aviation
** Police watercraft
* Fire department
** Fire engine
** Airport crash tender
** Wildland fire engine
** Quint
** Fire command vehicle
** Fire motorcycle
** Light and air unit
** Water tender
** Wildland water tender
** Firefighting aircraft
** Fireboat
** Rescue vehicle
* Emergency medical services
** Ambulance
** Ambulance bus
** Bariatric ambulance
** Combination car
** Nontransporting EMS vehicle

==Equipment==
Many emergency response vehicles (especially those of the main police, fire, and medical services) are likely to be fitted with audible and visual warning devices, which are designed to facilitate their movement through traffic to reach their destination, and to provide some protection on the scene.

Depending on local laws, other vehicles on the road—either those in the lanes the emergency vehicle is on, those on the side of the road the emergency vehicle is traveling on, or all vehicles on both sides of the road—may be required to yield the right of way and travel slower, if not fully stop, for emergency vehicles with their warning devices enabled, at least until it has passed through. Exemptions may sometimes be made to this, such as if yielding would cause an accident or if the vehicles are stopped at a red light or stop sign. Even in jurisdictions where no such laws exist, many motorists may allow the emergency vehicle to pass as a matter of courtesy.

==Livery==

Liveries are graphic designs on emergency vehicles that are intended to identify the vehicle&#x27;s respective emergency service, improve visual identification, and differentiate emergency vehicles from regular traffic. Each service&#x27;s design choices reflect different needs, but typically include:
* Identification of the service: Text or logos identifying the emergency service to which the vehicle belongs, and its purpose to the public and other services. Occasionally, the name of the service (&quot;police&quot;, &quot;ambulance&quot;, etc.) may be written in reverse lettering on the front of the vehicle; this lettering is reflected properly in rear-view mirrors.
* Vehicle ID number: A fleet number or unit number, typically printed on the roof, trunk, or fender of the emergency vehicle, simplifying internal identification and fleet maintenance.
* High visibility markings: A design or paint scheme that makes the emergency vehicle distinct or highly visible, and thus easily identifiable as an emergency vehicle from a distance. These can be as simple as unique paint schemes (such as black and white for police, or bright red for fire) or stripes, or as complex as Battenburg markings or intricate images evoking the jurisdiction they serve. Police sometimes partially detract from this, with unmarked police cars that lack markings and resemble civilian traffic, though these rarely make up the majority of a fleet and are almost always paired with marked vehicles.
* Contact information: Appropriate contact information for the emergency service operating the emergency vehicle, or appropriate methods to request their assistance. The most common contact information printed on an emergency vehicle is an emergency telephone number, usually a national uniform number, but also a service&#x27;s respective dedicated emergency number if they have one. The service&#x27;s phone number or website link may also be used, though these are generally less emphasized so as to not confuse people who may be unfamiliar with a jurisdiction&#x27;s emergency contact methods.

<doc id="860030" wikidata="Q1206110" url="?curid=860030" title="Operator (computer programming)">
<text>In computer programming, an operator is a programming language construct that provides functionality that may not be possible to define as a user-defined function (i.e. sizeof in C) or has syntax different than a function (i.e. infix addition as in codice_1). Like other programming language concepts, &quot;operator&quot; has a generally accepted, although debatable meaning among practitioners while at the same time each language gives it specific meaning in that context, and therefore the meaning varies by language. 

Some operators are represented with symbols characters typically not allowed for a function identifier to allow for presentation that is more familiar looking than typical function syntax. For example, a function that tests for greater-than could be named codice_2, but many languages provide an infix symbolic operator so that code looks more familiar. For example, this:
codice_3

Can be:

codice_4

Some languages allow a language-defined operator to be overridden with user-defined behavior and some allow for user-defined operator symbols.

Operators may also differ semantically from functions. For example, short-circuit Boolean operations evaluate later arguments only if earlier ones are not false.

== Differences from functions ==

=== Syntax ===
Many operators differ syntactically from user-defined functions. In most languages, a function is prefix notation with fixed precedence level and associativity and often with compulsory parentheses (e.g. codice_5 or codice_6 in Lisp). In contrast, many operators are infix notation and involve different use of delimiters such as parentheses. 

In general, an operator may be prefix, infix, postfix, matchfix, circumfix or bifix, and the syntax of an expression involving an operator depends on its arity (number of operands), precedence, and (if applicable), associativity. Most programming languages support binary operators and a few unary operators, with a few supporting more operands, such as the ?: operator in C, which is ternary. There are prefix unary operators, such as unary minus codice_7, and postfix unary operators, such as post-increment codice_8; and binary operations are infix, such as codice_9 or codice_10. Infix operations of higher arity require additional symbols, such as the ternary operator ?: in C, written as codice_11 – indeed, since this is the only common example, it is often referred to as &quot;the&quot; ternary operator. Prefix and postfix operations can support any desired arity, however, such as codice_12.

=== Semantics ===
The semantics of an operator may significantly differ from that of a normal function. For reference, addition is evaluated like a normal function. For example, codice_9 can be equivalent to a function codice_14 in that the arguments are evaluated and then the functional behavior is applied. However, assignment is different. For example, given codice_15 the target codice_16 is &quot;not&quot; evaluated. Instead its value is replaced with the value of codice_17. The scope resolution and element access operators (as in codice_18 and codice_19, respectively) operate on identifier names; not values.

In C, for instance, the array indexing operator can be used for both read access as well as assignment. In the following example, the increment operator reads the element value of an array and then assigns the element value.

++a[i];
The C++ codice_20 operator allows for fluent syntax by supporting a sequence of operators that affect a single argument. For example:

cout « &quot;Hello&quot; « &quot; &quot; « &quot;world!&quot; « endl;
== ad hoc polymorphic ==
Some languages provide operators that are ad hoc polymorphic inherently overloaded. For example, in Java the operator sums numbers or concatenates strings. 

== Customization ==
Some languages support user-defined overloading (such as C++). An operator, defined by the language, can be overloaded to behave differently based on the type of input.

Some languages (e.g. C, C++ and PHP) define a fixed set of operators, while others (e.g. Prolog, Seed7, F#, OCaml, Haskell) allow for user-defined operators. Some programming languages restrict operator symbols to special characters like or while others allow names like codice_21 (e.g. Pascal).

Most languages do not support user-defined operators since the feature significantly complicates parsing. Introducing a new operator changes the arity and precedence lexical specification of the language, which affects phrase-level lexical analysis. Custom operators, particularly via runtime definition, often make correct static analysis of a program impossible, since the syntax of the language may be Turing-complete, so even constructing the syntax tree may require solving the halting problem, which is impossible. This occurs for Perl, for example, and some dialects of Lisp.

If a language does allow for defining new operators, the mechanics of doing so may involve meta-programming specifying the operator in a separate language.

== Operand coercion ==

Some languages implicitly convert (aka coerce) operands to be compatible with each other. For example, Perl coercion rules cause codice_22 to evaluate to codice_23. The string literal codice_24 is converted to the numeric value 3.14 before addition is applied. Further, codice_25 is treated as floating point so the result is floating point even though codice_26 is an integer literal. JavaScript follows different rules so that the same expression evaluates to codice_27 since codice_26 is converted to a string which is then concatenated with the second operand.

In general, a programmer must be aware of the specific rules regarding operand coercion in order to avoid unexpected and incorrect behavior.

== Examples ==
;Mathematical operators
* Arithmetic: such as addition, codice_29
* Relational: such as greater than, codice_29
* Logic: such as codice_29 or codice_29
* Assignment: such as codice_29 or codice_29
* Three-way comparison (aka spaceship): codice_35

;Program structure operators
* Record or object field access: such as codice_36
* Scope resolution: such as codice_36 or codice_36

;Conditional operators
* Ternary conditional: codice_39
* Elvis: codice_35
* Null coalesing: codice_35

;Notable C and C++ operators
* Address-of operator: codice_42
* Dereference: codice_43
* Comma: codice_44
;Compound operators
* Compound assignment (aka augmented assignment) in C/C++: codice_45, codice_46, codice_47, codice_48, codice_49, codice_50, codice_51, codice_52, codice_53, codice_54

<text>Agathe Ursula Backer Grøndahl (1 December 1847 – 4 June 1907) was a Norwegian pianist and composer. Her son Fridtjof Backer-Grøndahl (1885–1959) was also a pianist and composer, who promoted his mother&#x27;s compositions in his concerts.

==Biography==
Agathe Ursula Backer was born in Holmestrand in 1847, in a wealthy and art-loving home, as the second youngest of four sisters, all gifted in drawing and music. In 1857, she moved with her family to Christiania, where she studied with Otto Winther-Hjelm, Halfdan Kjerulf and Ludvig Mathias Lindeman. Between 1865 and 1867 she became a pupil of Theodor Kullak and studied composition under Richard Wuerst at the &quot;Akademie der Tonkunst&quot; in Berlin, where she lived together with her sister Harriet Backer. She won fame there with her interpretation of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Emperor&quot; Concerto.

After returning to Norway in 1868, she debuted in Christiania with the Philharmonic Society, playing the &quot;Emperor&quot; Concerto under the direction of Edvard Grieg, then 26 years old. A recommendation from Ole Bull led to further studies with Hans von Bülow in Florence in 1871. Later the same year she played at the Gewandhaus in Leipzig, becoming a pupil of Franz Liszt in Weimar in 1873. In 1874 she married the conductor and singing teacher Olaus Andreas Grøndahl, and was generally known thereafter as Agathe Backer Grøndahl. During the second half of the 1870s she built up an outstanding pianist career with a series of concerts in the Nordic countries, also playing with very great success in London and Paris.

In 1889 and 1890 she gave concerts in London and Birmingham with a wide-ranging program, including Grieg&#x27;s piano concerto. After that she was proclaimed one of the century&#x27;s greatest piano artists by George Bernard Shaw, who also remarked on the sensitiveness, symmetry and artistic economy of her compositions. At the World Exhibition in Paris in 1889, she repeated her success with her brilliant interpretation of Grieg&#x27;s piano concerto. It was then that she began experiencing nerve problems, although she eventually resumed her artistic career as a pianist. Later in the 1890s she became almost completely deaf. She gave her last concerts in Sweden and Finland in the autumn of 1901. Then she retired to teaching.

As a teacher she was markedly successful and influential. Her students included Erika Stang and Bertha Tapper. Her children studied under her and are counted with her gifted pupils. She was the author of many songs and a great deal of music for the piano, and both as pianist and composer stands at the head of modern music in Norway. Agathe Backer Grøndahl died at her home in Ormøya, outside Christiania, at the age of 59. She is today chiefly remembered for her piano pieces and songs.

=== Compositional style ===
Agathe Backer Grøndahl played a major role in the period often called the golden age of Norwegian music history. She composed in total some 400 pieces spanning seventy opus numbers. She was a prominent character on the Norwegian musical scene and a close friend of Edvard Grieg. Her earlier compositions synthesized the predominant pianistic and stylistic ideas of 1850s Europe. In her later years however, her style transformed and anticipated some of the early twentieth century impressionistic ideas, which ultimately led the composer Pauline Hall to call her the first true Norwegian impressionist.

<text>King&#x27;s Highway 427 (pronounced &quot;four twenty-seven&quot;), also known as Highway 427 and colloquially as the 427, is a 400-series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario that runs from the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) and Gardiner Expressway in Toronto to Major Mackenzie Drive (York Regional Road25) in Vaughan. It is Ontario&#x27;s second busiest freeway by volume and the third busiest in North America, behind Highway 401 and Interstate 405 in California.
Like Highway401, a portion of the route is divided into a collector-express system with twelve to fourteen continuous lanes. Notable about Highway427 are its several multi-level interchanges; the junctions with the QEW/Gardiner Expressway and Highway401 are two of the largest interchanges in Ontario and were constructed between 1967 and 1971, while the interchanges with Highway 409 and Highway 407 were completed in 1992 and 1995, respectively.

Highway427 is one of two complete north-south freeways in Toronto, the only other one being Highway404/Don Valley Parkway serving North York and Scarborough. Highway427 serves as a major traffic route for the western portion of Toronto (Etobicoke), the northeastern portion of Mississauga (Malton), the southeastern portion of Brampton (Claireville), and the western portion of Vaughan (Woodbridge). The section of Highway427 between Highway401 and Dundas Street is a heavily traversed transit corridor; the stretch between Burnhamthorpe and Rathburn saw an average of over 400,000 vehicles and over 5,000 buses per day in 2016, including express buses from GO Transit, MiWay, and the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). The freeway is also the main feeder to Toronto Pearson International Airport from the north and south, as a considerable amount of traffic from Highway401 (eastbound), the QEW/Gardiner Expressway, and Highway407 make use of the route for airport access. 

First designated in 1972, Highway427 assumed the recently completed 12-lane collector-express freeway of Highway 27, as well as a short freeway north of Highway401 known as the Airport Expressway. Both routes were upgraded throughout the 1950s and 1960s, eventually becoming intertwined into the present configuration in 1972. The freeway was extended north from Pearson Airport to Highway 7 over the following twenty years. Construction of an extension north to York Regional Road 25 (Major Mackenzie Drive) began in 2017 and was opened on September18, 2021.

== Route description ==

Highway 427 is the second-busiest freeway in Canada with an average of 300,000 vehicles that use it between the QEW and Highway401 per day. The section between Burnhamthorpe Road and Rathburn Road has an annual average daily traffic (AADT) count of 353,100. The route was long from 1991 until 2021, with the latest extension bringing it to approximately 27 km.

At its southern terminus, the route begins at Coules Court, where it continues as Brown&#x27;s Line, once the southernmost stretch of Highway27. Alderwood Plaza, located on the east side of the route, has a parking lot which provides access to the highway; this is the only at-grade access along the length of the route. The four-lane road splits into a divided highway and descends below Evans Avenue. The highway weaves through a complicated interchange, providing northbound access to Evans Avenue and the Gardiner Expressway, and southbound access to The Queensway, QEW/Gardiner Expressway, and Evans Avenue. North of the interchange, the lanes from Brown&#x27;s Line diverge and form the collector lanes of a collector-express system. Flyover ramps to and from the QEW/Gardiner pass over the southbound lanes and converge to form the express lanes. This collector-express system serves to divide local traffic from freeway-to-freeway traffic; the express lanes provide access between the QEW/Gardiner Expressway and Highway401, while the collector lanes provide local access between those interchanges.

After crossing Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) tracks, the freeway interchanges with Dundas Street (former Highway 5). A set of criss-crossing ramps provide access between the collector and express lanes north of this point, referred to as &quot;The Basketweave&quot;, with the northbound express-to-collector transfer also having an offramp to The East Mall and Dundas Street. North of Dundas, the highway has a northbound right-in/right-out (RIRO) interchange with Gibbs Road, the first of several that provide collector lane access to minor streets that mostly connect to The East Mall and The West Mall, which run parallel with the collector-express section of the freeway. The highway passes beneath Bloor Street but has no interchange with it. A full interchange is provided shortly after with Burnhamthorpe Road, southwest of Burnhamthorpe Collegiate Institute. Across from the school, another RIRO provides access from the southbound lanes to Holiday Drive and The West Mall. Following the off-ramp, to the north, is a half-cloverleaf interchange with Rathburn Road, which provides access from the northbound lanes and to the southbound lanes.
Transfers provide a second and final opportunity to cross between the express and collector lanes, or vice versa, south of the complicated Highway401 interchange. A final RIRO provides southbound access to and from Eringate Drive, after which the collector lanes diverge, and the express lanes cross the southbound collectors. The collector lanes cross Eglinton Avenue at a half-cloverleaf interchange and then dives under Highway401 while transitioning into Highway27, while the express lanes interchange with Highway401 and continue the route of Highway427. The Highway 427 express lanes and ramps connecting to Highway 401 are constructed around the Richview Memorial Cemetery.
Highway427 passes through the sprawling Highway 401 interchange and becomes displaced approximately to the west. There are no ramps to provide access from southbound Highway427 to eastbound Highway401 and vice versa, as this connection is handled by Highway 409. Highway 427 crosses Renforth Drive and then curves to the east of Runway24R and 24L of Toronto Pearson International Airport.
Shortly thereafter, it crosses and interchanges with Dixon Road and Airport Road, between which it forms the demarcation line. Several ramps diverge at this point to provide access to Pearson Airport, and the freeway narrows to eight lanes.

From here to just south of Finch Avenue, the freeway follows the boundary line between Toronto and Mississauga. It encounters the third multi-level junction along its length, with Highway409, which provides access to the airport as well as the southbound to eastbound movement that cannot be performed at the interchange with Highway401 to the south. Highway427 continues straight north and narrows again to six lanes. After crossing the Kitchener GO line, it passes west of Woodbine Racetrack and interchanges with Rexdale Boulevard/Derry Road and Finch Avenue. The freeway bends slightly eastward, diverging from the Toronto/Mississauga boundary to briefly run exclusively through Toronto again. It crosses the West Humber River where it drains from the Claireville Reservoir. The highway crosses Steeles Avenue and enters Vaughan, as it approaches a fourth and final sprawling interchange with Highway407.
It then interchanges with Highway 7 (York Regional Road 7), Langstaff Road (Regional Road 72), Rutherford Road (Regional Road 73), and ends at a trumpet interchange with Major MacKenzie Drive(Regional Road 25), with the northbound exit ramp defaulting into Garnet Williams Way, a local side street.

== History ==

=== QEW to Highway 401 (1953–1956) ===

Although Highway427 was not officially designated until 1972, several sections of freeway were already in place prior to that date. The designation was applied following the completion of the interchanges at the QEW and Highway401 as well as the expansion of the section between them into a collector-express system.

Highway27 was designated as a two-lane road travelling north from Highway 2 (Lake Shore Boulevard) towards Barrie. As Toronto grew outwards following the annexation of various municipalities, the Ontario Department of Highways (DHO) began planning for a bypass of the city, aptly named the &quot;Toronto Bypass&quot;. A significant portion of this bypass was designed to be incorporated into the Transprovincial Highway, now Highway401. The remainder was designed to follow the existing right-of-way of Highway27 between the QEW and Richview Sideroad (now Eglinton Avenue).
Construction of the Toronto Bypass began near Yonge Street in 1949 (along present-day Highway401) and on the four-laning of Highway27 in 1953.
The Highway27 work involved the construction of two interchanges: a three-way interchange at Highway401 and a large cloverleaf at the QEW, the latter of which would become one of the worst bottlenecks in the province a decade after its completion, according to Minister of Transportation Charles MacNaughton. By September 1956, it was possible to bypass Toronto entirely on the four lane divided highway composed of Highway401 and Highway27.
Highway401 was extended to the west soon after,
but Highway27 remained a two-lane highway north of it.

=== Airport Expressway (1964–1971) ===

During the early 1960s, Toronto International Airport was expanded with the construction of the Aeroquay One terminal. To serve the expected demand of the airport expansion, the DHO built a new four-lane freeway known as the Toronto Airport Expressway which opened on January 3, 1964. This new route ran north from Highway401 at Renforth Drive to Dixon/Airport Roads (roughly followed the same alignment as today&#x27;s Highway 427) where it tied in with and downgraded into Indian Line. The Airport Expressway featured a connection with the western terminus of Richview Sideroad at the southern end of the interchange with Highway401 as well as an interchange with Renforth Drive. On Highway401 the Airport Expressway interchange was located 1 km (0.62 mi) to the west on the existing interchange with Highway27.

=== Expansion (1963–1971) ===
In 1963, MacNaughton announced that Highway 401 would be widened from a four-lane highway to a collector-express system, modeled after the Dan Ryan Expressway in Chicago. Plans were soon developed to apply this model to the QEW between Highway27 and Royal York Road and to Highway27 between the QEW and Highway401, and were unveiled to Etobicoke council on October13, 1966.
Design work followed and was completed by May 1967. The widening of Highway27 required the demolition and rebuilding of overpasses at Bloor Street, Burnhamthorpe Road, and Rathburn Road constructed just over a decade earlier. The rest of the route was rebuilt by September 1968, the next stage involved the reconstruction of the interchanges with QEW and Highway401 which were reconfigured into complicated multi-level interchanges to permit free-flow movement.

Replacing a cloverleaf, the new interchange with the QEW was built over and required the construction of 19 bridges and the equivalent of of two-lane roadway. The project involved the temporary diversion of QEW traffic to an overpass that would eventually be used for The Queensway. Construction began in September 1968, although preliminary work had been ongoing since 1966;
the interchange opened to traffic on November14, 1969.

The existing Airport Expressway was removed in its entirety, as the DHO deemed it insufficient for future expansion beyond an airport access road, but its replacement in the form of the Highway427 extension (also known as the Airport Expressway until 1980) still followed roughly the same alignment. Like the former Airport Expressway, the extension included direct access to the airport and Dixon/Airport Roads, north of which at a temporary terminus it defaulted to Indian Line. 

Highway401&#x27;s new junction with Highway27 remains the largest interchange in Canada as it sprawls over and required the construction of 28 bridges and the equivalent of of two-lane roadway, being built around the existing Richview Memorial Cemetery. On Highway401 this required the removal of the existing interchange with Highway27 as well as the half-cloverleaf interchange with the Airport Expressway which was 1 km (0.62 mi) to the west as both were originally conceived as separate routes. These two interchanges were replaced with a single large junction, where north of Highway401 the collector lanes would continue the Highway27 routing while the express lanes would shift westward to meet the rebuilt Airport Expressway. The reconstructed interchange also including connections to Eglinton Avenue (ultimately meant for the proposed but never-built municipal Richview Expressway) from all directions except for Highway401 east of that interchange, while Carlingview Drive received ramps to Highway401 east of that interchange.
While the new interchange with the QEW was opened to traffic on November14, 1969, the more complex Highway401 junction required several more years of construction staging, fully opening on December4, 1971 (though portions were opened in the weeks prior to that). On that same date, Highway427 was inaugurated as it assumed the collector-express portion of Highway27 and the new Airport Expressway. North of Highway401, while the existing Highway27 remained a provincial route as it transitioned from an expressway to an arterial road, the parallel section of Highway427 effectively served as a freeway bypass.

=== Extensions beyond Highway 401 (1976–1994) ===
At the recently-opened interchange between Highway401 and Highway427, the off-ramp from westbound Highway401 to Carlingview Drive was temporarily signed as &quot;Airport Expressway&quot;, since Carlingview Drive had a temporary on-ramp to northbound Highway427 near the Renforth Drive underpass but that on-ramp was closed in the early 1970s. Direct access from westbound Highway401 to northbound Highway427 would be restored a few years later once Highway 409 opened, which had greater capacity then the short-lived Carlingview ramps.

Ultimately, it was planned to extend Highway427 north along Indian Line (although a stretch of that road would be retained to maintain access to driveways)
most of the way to the future Highway407, where ramps would direct northbound traffic onto Highway27, although this connection was never built. An extension north of Dixon/Airport Roads began in 1976 as part of the work to build Highway409,
and it included the construction of the interchange between the two freeways. By the beginning of 1980, this work was completed, and construction was progressing on the section north to Rexdale Boulevard, which opened by the end of the year.
In 1982, construction began on the next section of the highway, extending it to south of Albion Road (then Highway 50), with traffic defaulting onto the two-lane Indian Line to reach Albion.
This project included an interchange with a new Finch Avenue extension west from Humberline Drive to Steeles Avenue, which was completed in late 1984.

Highway427 was extended north to Highway7 in Vaughan beginning with the construction of the Parclo interchange between the two in 1988. The extension followed a new alignment since this has sufficient right-of-way for future expansion and a junction with the initial phase of Highway407, as opposed to upgrading Indian Line and incorporating it into the freeway.
The extension opened in late 1991. The bypassed remanent of Indian Line ending at Albion Road was then closed off to regular vehicular traffic, though it is still used for utility vehicle access to a natural gas facility. 

The final at-grade intersections were removed in the early 1990s, the first being the signalized left turn from the southbound lanes with eastbound Highway409 which was replaced by a flyover ramp in 1992, and the second being at Morning Star Drive where an overpass was constructed in 1994 to extend the street across the freeway to Humberwood Boulevard, making Highway427 a fully controlled-access freeway for its entire length.

Work on the interchange with Highway407 proceeded in stages, starting with (as part of the 427 extension project itself) the underpasses for Highway407 as well as the fourth-level flyover ramp from westbound Highway407 to Highway427 southbound prior to 1991, following by the third-level flyover ramp from Highway427 northbound to Highway407 westbound, with the interchange being put into service when Highway407 opened in 1997.

=== Upgrades since 1990s ===
In the late-1990s, at the interchange with Highway401, the underused left-hand exit for Eglinton Avenue was narrowed from two lanes to one lane, in order to provide an additional lane for Highway427 southbound, although this extra lane ends shortly before the underpass with Highway401. 

In 2001-02, modifications were made to the interchange with the QEW and Gardiner Expressway. This included a new loop ramp from the Highway427 southbound collectors to the Gardiner, aimed at relieving the congestion in the express lanes created by the southbound collector-to-express transfer near Bloor Street, as the collector lanes originally lacked direct access to the Toronto-bound QEW (downloaded from the province in 1998 to become the part of the Gardiner). The Gardiner Expressway also received an off-ramp to Sherway Gardens, which necessitated an underpass to be implemented in the directional ramp from the Highway427 southbound express to the Hamilton-bound QEW.

In the late 2000s, the ramp from Highway401 westbound to Highway427 southbound, as well as the ramp for the opposite movement, were restriped from three lanes to two lanes. 

=== Arterial extension and widening (2008–2021)===
 An four-lane arterial road designated as Regional Road 99 was opened in the autumn of 2008 by York Region. This municipal addition ran from Highway427&#x27;s northern terminus at Highway7 to a signalized intersection with Zenway Boulevard, and mainly served to provide improved access to Highway27 and Highway 50. It was constructed as a temporary access road and not intended to be expanded to full freeway standards, with the use of portable jersey barriers as it approached the Highway7 overpass, and its alignment veering on the western side of the right-of-way for the future Highway427 extension. York Regional Road99 was permanently closed on August8, 2020, to make way for the extension of Highway427 northwards to Major MacKenzie Drive (Regional Road 25), which also involved constructing an overpass for Zenway Boulevard to cross the extended freeway.

A section of Highway427 between Campus Road-Fasken Drive and Highway 7 was expanded to four lanes in each direction.
This project included the installation of high-mast lighting, median barriers, and the addition of high-occupancy toll lanes (HOT) in both directions, and was completed in 2021 in conjunction with the Vaughan Extension (see below). One of the challenges during this project was widening the Highway 427 bridges crossing Highway 407 ETR, with the solution being steel box girders added on either side of the existing post-tensioned concrete structures, as opposed to the conventional bridge widening practice of the expansion using a similar construction to the original bridge since post-tensioned concrete additions require falsework which in turn would close down Highway 407 ETR lanes for extended periods. The completed HOT lanes stretch from south of Highway 409 to north of Rutherford Road. In conjunction with the widening work, and in anticipation of the opening of the extension north of Highway 7, exit numbers were added (still ongoing as of late 2021), starting with the northern sections of the highway.

=== Vaughan Extension (2017–2021) ===
An environmental assessment was completed on a northward extension of Highway427 to Major Mackenzie Drive to relieve traffic issues on Regional Road27 and 50, as well as provide improved access to the Canadian Pacific Intermodal Terminal,
with construction beginning in May 2017.
The project included HOT lanes as far north as Rutherford Road, and was scheduled to open in 2021, with the HOT lanes opening the following year.
However, a pending legal dispute between the provincial government and the constructor delayed the opening of the extension in late April 2021.

The extension was built by Link 427, a consortium of six companies that tendered the winning bid to Infrastructure Ontario,
The project was estimated at a cost of $616 million,
and included the design, financing, and construction of the extension, as well as its maintenance for thirty years.
Construction required the periodic closure of eleven roads, as well as the removal of Regional Road99. McGillivray Road was realigned at Rutherford Road, as was the intersection of Huntington Road and Major Mackenzie Drive.
The extension north to Major Mackenzie Drive opened on September18, 2021, after the legal dispute was settled. 
== Future ==
There is a planned extension that would see the freeway pushed north to near Bolton to meet the proposed Highway 413, should that highway be constructed.
On April 30, 2024, the Ontario provincial government confirmed it will start constructing Highway 413 in 2025 after coming to an agreement with the Canadian federal government, and Highway 413 would be the proposed northern terminus of Highway 427. The Highway427 Extension Transportation Needs Assessment Study examined further extensions; connections with the Bradford Bypass freeway, as well as Highway 400 and Highway 11 north of Barrie were considered. In the past decade, there has been little discussion of this highway extension due to concerns with traversing the Oak Ridges Moraine and Minesing Wetlands.

<doc id="860042" wikidata="Q5681137" url="?curid=860042" title="Hatchie River">
<text>The Hatchie River is a river in northern Mississippi and southwestern Tennessee. It is of considerable geographic, cultural, and historic significance. In large measure, this is because it is the only major river of West Tennessee that has never been impounded, channelized, or otherwise modified by human activity to any major degree, although several of its tributaries have. Its environs are indicative of what much of West Tennessee must have resembled prior to the time of European settlement in early 19th century.
The Hatchie rises in the northern part of Union County, Mississippi and travels through Tippah and Alcorn counties before crossing into Hardeman County, Tennessee, near the community of Pocahontas. After a short jog into adjoining McNairy County, Tennessee, the Hatchie flows north, in a serpentine fashion, then turns northwest toward Bolivar. While there is usually a discernible main channel, the Hatchie at this point is largely a zone of wetlands approximately one mile (1.6 km) wide. Supposedly Bolivar was the head of navigation for small, shallow-draught steamboats in the 19th century.

From Bolivar, the Hatchie continues generally northwest, crossing into Haywood County and the southwestern corner of Madison County. It then enters Hatchie National Wildlife Refuge. The rest of the stream course generally trends west. US 51 (Future I-69) crosses the river. There is a &quot;bow&quot; to the north in the final part of the stream course, which forms the line between Tipton County and Lauderdale County. The Hatchie enters the Mississippi River just north of the Hatchie Towhead and just south of the Lower Hatchie National Wildlife Refuge. The Hatchie is designated as a &quot;scenic river&quot; under the Tennessee Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.

The name &quot;Hatchie River&quot; is tautological, as the element &quot;hatchie&quot; means &quot;river&quot; in the Choctaw language.

Variant names of the Hatchie River include Arteguet River and Big Hatchie River.

She deferred her studies at OCC to do some modeling work and eventually dropped out after deciding to go into modeling full-time.

==Career==
Dawber moved to New York City and was initially a fashion model with Wilhelmina Models before switching to acting. She appeared in several television commercials during the 1970s (Fotomat, Noxzema, Neet, Underalls, etc.). 

Dawber screen-tested for the title role in &quot;Tabitha,&quot; a 1977 to 1978 situation comedy spun off from &quot;Bewitched&quot;, but the role instead went to Lisa Hartman. However, ABC executives were impressed enough with her to enroll her in the company&#x27;s &quot;talent development&quot; program, which paid its participants until they could find appropriate roles. Garry Marshall recruited her from this program.

===Breakthrough: &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;===
Dawber&#x27;s professional breakthrough came when Marshall chose her, despite her having relatively little acting experience and not having auditioned for the part, as one of the two title characters of the ABC sitcom &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy,&quot; which ran from 1978 to 1982. She portrayed Mindy McConnell, the comedic foil and eventual love interest for the extraterrestrial Mork from the planet Ork, played by a then-unknown Robin Williams. The show was very popular in its debut season, when it averaged at number three in the Nielsen ratings for the year. The only major difficulty for her on set was that she often found it impossible to maintain the proper composure in character in the face of her co-star&#x27;s comedic talent. Also, pressure came from the ABC network to sexualize her character as the series progressed, which Dawber successfully resisted, with Williams&#x27;s support.

===&quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;===
Dawber sang in a 1980s Los Angeles Civic Light Opera production of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Pirates of Penzance,&quot; based on the Joseph Papp / New York Shakespeare Festival production. Her role, as Mabel, had been played by Linda Ronstadt in the New York run of the show. In mid-1982, Dawber performed the role of Mabel at the Minskoff Theatre in New York.

===&quot;My Sister Sam&quot;===
From 1986 to 1988, Dawber again had a title role in a television series, playing Samantha Russell in the CBS sitcom &quot;My Sister Sam,&quot; co-starring Rebecca Schaeffer. The series was a success in its first season, but it suffered a ratings drop in its second after moving to Saturday night. &quot;My Sister Sam&quot; was canceled in April 1988, with half of the second season&#x27;s episodes never shown on CBS. They were eventually broadcast (along with all previous episodes) on USA Network.

In July 1989, over a year after the show&#x27;s cancellation, Schaeffer was shot and killed in front of her apartment in Los Angeles by Robert John Bardo, an obsessed fan who had stalked her for three years. Dawber was reportedly &quot;devastated&quot; by her former co-star&#x27;s death. Dawber and her other surviving &quot;My Sister Sam&quot; co-starsJoel Brooks, David Naughton and Jenny O&#x27;Haraall participated in a filmed public service announcement about gun violence prevention, and Dawber herself became a gun control advocate.

===Film work===
Although mostly known for her television work, Dawber has starred in several films, including the comedy movie &quot;Stay Tuned&quot; (1992) with John Ritter and the period movie &quot;I&#x27;ll Remember April&quot; (1999), alongside husband Mark Harmon.

===Return to television===
In 1997, Dawber starred in the short-lived sitcom &quot;Life... and Stuff&quot; on CBS.

In 2014, she reunited with Robin Williams on his comedy series &quot;The Crazy Ones&quot; as a love interest of Williams&#x27;s character. The reunion failed to improve ratings, and the series was canceled shortly afterwards. Williams, already suffering from Lewy body disease by this time, died by suicide later that year.

Dawber is a national spokeswoman for Big Brothers Big Sisters of America. Garry K. Marshall, the film-and-television comedy writer–producer–director who enabled Dawber&#x27;s professional breakthrough, died in 2016. That year, Dawber made a guest appearance on &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; in a tribute episode to Marshall, along with other Marshall alumni such as Ron Howard, Garry&#x27;s sister Penny Marshall, Cindy Williams, Anson Williams, Don Most and Marion Ross.

For the first time in her career, she appeared with her husband, fellow actor Mark Harmon, on CBS&#x27;s &quot;NCIS&quot; in 2021 for seven episodes as &#x27;&quot;seasoned investigative journalist&quot; Marcie Warren.

==Personal life==
Dawber married actor Mark Harmon on March 21, 1987, in a private ceremony. They have two sons: one born in 1988 and another in 1992. Dawber is Roman Catholic.

<text>King&#x27;s Highway 409, commonly referred to as Highway 409 and historically as the Belfield Expressway, is a 400-series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario that extends from Highway 401 in Toronto to Pearson International Airport, west of Highway 427, in Mississauga. It is a short freeway used mainly as a spur route for traffic travelling to the airport or Highway 427 northbound from Highway 401 westbound (and vice versa), as these route movements are not accommodated at the complex interchange between Highways 401 and 427.

Planning for Highway 409 took place in the late 1960s amidst considerable controversy around its originally proposed path through the historic town of Malton. Eventually, the route was changed to provide access to the airport instead of northward towards Brampton and was completed through the mid-1970s, opening in 1978. The significance of the route has increased over the years alongside expansion of the airport. In 2000, the Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA) purchased the section of the highway west of Highway 427 in order to modify the ramps leading into the airport.

The speed limit along Highway 409 is east of Highway 427 and west of it. It is patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police east of the Toronto–Peel boundary and by the Peel Regional Police to the west of it. The original name of the freeway was derived from Belfield Road, which runs parallel to and north of the highway in Toronto from Kipling Avenue to Atwell Drive.

== Route description ==

Highway 409 serves as a direct link between Highway 401, Highway 427, and Pearson International Airport. While it is not intended as a commuter route, there are three exits serving industrial areas in Etobicoke centred on the highway. Highway 409 also serves as the only connection between westbound Highway 401 and northbound Highway 427 and between southbound Highway 427 and eastbound Highway 401, as access between these routes is not provided at the 401–427 interchange.

Highway 409 begins at Airport Road as the knotted flyovers from Pearson International Airport converge into the freeway from the various terminals. The highway then turns northeast and encounters Highway 427. Through this section to Highway 427, the highway is maintained by the Greater Toronto Airport Authority (GTAA) and has a posted speed limit of .
As the highway passes under Highway 427, it turns southeast and takes on an east–west orientation. It passes over Carlingview Drive, and begins to descend into a trench, passing beneath Highway 27, two CN railway spurs, and Iron Street before returning to level grade. Around the interchange with Martin Grove Road, the freeway twists slightly to the north and south between factories and warehouses.

At its eastern terminus, the eastbound Highway 409 crosses Kipling Avenue and two of its lanes merge onto each of the Highway 401 express and collector lanes. From Highway 401 westbound, two westbound collector lanes diverge and become the westbound lanes of Highway 409, while the remaining three westbound collector lanes join up with the westbound Highway 401 express lanes to form six lanes west of there. Highway 409 is also accessible from Highway 401 westbound express lanes.

== History ==
Plans for Highway 409, originally known as the Belfield Expressway, were first presented in 1965 to the Peel County (now Peel Region) council. In September 1968, three possible routes were submitted to the council. At the time, the town of Malton, within Peel County, occupied the area of the planned expressway, having not yet been amalgamated with municipalities within Peel County to the south to create the City of Mississauga. The strip of land would require the expropriation and demolition of 50 houses, as well as several businesses, a school, and two community parks. Citizens of the village formed a group to protest the freeway and to demand another route be taken. An above-grade alternative, similar to the Gardiner Expressway was proposed, as well as a tunnel under the airport.

However, at the same time, Toronto was embroiled in heated debate over the fate of its planned urban expressway system. When the Spadina Expressway was cancelled in 1971, the planned Belfield Expressway was completely revised. Instead of continuing northwest from Highway 427 and through Malton&#x27;s four-corners at Derry Road and Airport Road towards Brampton, it would curve southwest and provide access to the developing Toronto International Airport. At the recently-opened interchange between Highway401 and Highway427, the off-ramp from westbound Highway401 to Carlingview Drive was temporarily signed as &quot;Airport Expressway&quot;, since Carlingview Drive had a temporary on-ramp to northbound Highway427 near the Renforth Drive underpass but that on-ramp was closed in the early 1970s. Direct access from westbound Highway401 to northbound Highway427 would be restored a few years later with the Belfield Expressway which had greater capacity then the short-lived Carlingview ramps.

Before plans for the new route were finalized, a flyover was built to provide access from Belfield Road to eastbound Highway 401, opening on October 7, 1968.
Because the lands on which the freeway was to be built were occupied, the province elected to apply to expropriate the right-of-way in April 1972.
Construction was underway by the end of the year, with the first contracts constructing the trench section near Highway 27. Structures, drainage and grading were completed west of Iron Street to Carlingview Avenue in 1974. In June of that year, contracts were awarded for the same work east of Iron Street to Highway 401. When this was completed in 1975, a paving contract was awarded from Carlingview Avenue to Highway 401.

Highway 409 first opened to traffic by 1976, with temporary ramps at Carlingview Avenue acting as the western terminus. That year the final contracts were awarded to construct portions of the Highway 427 interchange and connect Highway 409 with the airport road system.
The entire freeway opened on August 25, 1978.
The flyover ramp, which connects southbound Highway 427 with eastbound Highway 409 was constructed in the early 1990s. Prior to that, an at-grade intersection crossed the northbound lanes of Highway 427, controlled by a traffic signal. This signal had the longest cycle of any traffic light in Toronto during its years of operation.

The portion of Highway 409 west of Highway 427 is owned and operated by the Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA). Despite its private ownership, the section east of Airport Road is still considered a part of Highway 409. The GTAA purchased this section of the highway in 2000 in order to rebuild the approaches to the new Terminal 1 at Toronto Pearson Airport.

Until 2008, Highway 409 remained almost unchanged from its original construction. However, beginning on July 10, 2008, traffic access was restricted to the outermost lanes. The steel &quot;W&quot; guardrail and truss light posts in the median were replaced by an Ontario Tall Wall barrier with a high-mast lighting system. Construction was carried out over several years and was scheduled for completion on September 1, 2011.

<doc id="860056" wikidata="Q7028017" url="?curid=860056" title="Nick Tahou Hots">
<text>Nick Tahou Hots is a restaurant in Rochester, New York, best known for a dish called the Garbage Plate. The restaurant was founded in 1918 by Alex Tahou, the grandfather of the 21st-century owner (also named Alex Tahou), and named for Nick Tahou, the founder&#x27;s son, who operated the establishment until his death in 1997. While there are other Upstate New York variants, Nick Tahou&#x27;s is the originator of the trademarked Garbage Plate.

== Garbage Plate ==
Nick Tahou Hots&#x27;s best known dish is the Garbage Plate, which consists of a selection of home fries, macaroni salad, baked beans and French fries topped with meats of the customer&#x27;s choice. The dish can be garnished with mustard, chopped onions, ketchup and the venue&#x27;s signature hot sauce, and is served with bread and butter. The Garbage Plate is typically mixed together by the diner before being eaten.

Tahou first created the dish as two hamburger patties with a selection of side dishes. The dish has spawned several imitators with similar names in the Greater Rochester area, including Fairport Hots&#x27; &quot;The Hot Plate&quot;, Tom Wahl&#x27;s &quot;55 Junker Plate&quot; and Mark&#x27;s Texas Hots&#x27; &quot;Sloppy Plate&quot;.

== Philanthropy ==
A charitable Garbage Plate Run is sponsored by the University of Rochester&#x27;s Sigma Phi Epsilon. Held annually in the spring, this three-man race begins at the U of R River Campus. The first of the team members run through the city to Nick Tahou&#x27;s. Once they arrive, the second teammate eats a Garbage Plate as quickly as they are able, then the final teammate runs back to campus to complete the race. In a race titled the &quot;Ironman&quot;, one-man teams attempt to complete all three tasks alone. The Mount Hope Family Center is the recipient of all proceeds collected during the event, including sponsor funds and contestant&#x27;s entry fees.

== Other locations ==

In the mid-1950s, Nick Tahou&#x27;s hot dog stand was located in a smaller building just to the east, which is shown in the picture on this page, of its longtime location. From 1979 to 2007, there were two Nick Tahou Hots restaurants in Rochester: one in downtown Rochester in the former Buffalo, Rochester, and Pittsburgh Railway station on West Main Street, to the west of the I-490 overpass and a satellite restaurant on Lyell Avenue (NY Route 31) in Gates. In 2007, Steve Tahou and his sister Joanne Tahou-Demkou, the children of Ike Tahou (Nick&#x27;s brother), assumed full ownership of the Lyell Avenue location and renamed it Steve T. Hots and Potatoes. Steve Tahou returned to using Rochester-based Zweigle&#x27;s hot dogs and Italian sausages, which were used in the original garbage plates at Nick&#x27;s. The original West Main Street location continues to use the trademarked &quot;Nick Tahou&quot; and &quot;Garbage Plate&quot; names, and continues to use the Nick Tahou Hot Dog branded dogs in their plates. While previously open all night, the downtown restaurant began closing at 8 p.m. in 1998 in voluntary compliance with the city&#x27;s effort to reduce troublesome night spots. Steve T.&#x27;s remains open 24 hours a day.

There was also a short-lived Nick Tahou&#x27;s operation in Oswego, New York, that opened in September 1995 adjacent to the SUNY Oswego campus.

On August 3, 2010, a second location opened at 3070 West Henrietta Road (NYS Route 15), in the town of Henrietta, New York. It closed in early 2014.

Nick&#x27;s has been featured on Food Network&#x27;s &quot;Unwrapped&quot; episode titled &quot;Funny Foods&quot; as well as the &quot;City in a Box&quot; Monopoly-based board game showcasing famous Rochester locales. The Garbage Plate was also highlighted in the July 2007 issue of the US Airways inflight magazine.

On the November 16, 2009, episode of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, host Jon Stewart told the people of Rochester to &quot;get their heads out of their Garbage Plates.&quot; On February 23, 2011, the Food Network filmed a segment for the show &quot;The Best Thing I Ever Ate&quot; on the recommendation of pastry chef Johnny Iuzzini. Nick Tahou&#x27;s was also featured on the Travel Channel series &quot;Chowdown Countdown&quot;, where it ranked No. 81 out of 101 locations. In 2011 it was featured on a Rochester episode of the Travel Channel&#x27;s &quot;Man v. Food Nation&quot;, starring Adam Richman.

In the 2012 film &quot;The Place Beyond the Pines&quot;, Garbage Plates are mentioned as a &quot;must have&quot; for Bradley Cooper&#x27;s character Avery when he travels through Rochester, New York.

In 2017, Youtuber Jenna Marbles (who grew up in Rochester) mentioned Garbage Plates as her favorite food and in &quot;My Boyfriend Cooks My Favorite Meal&quot; got her boyfriend, Julien Solomita, to make her a vegan version. Another YouTuber and Rochester native, Andrew Rea of &quot;Binging with Babish&quot;, recreated the Garbage Plate in one of his weekly episodes, inspired by the mention of the dish in &quot;The Place Beyond the Pines&quot;.

In 2020, comedian Jim Gaffigan, while on tour in Rochester, stopped by Nick Tahou Hots and enjoyed a Garbage Plate. He subsequently talked about his experience on &quot;Conan&quot;.

The dish has been featured in numerous publications, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Saveur&quot;, &quot;HuffPost&quot;, and &quot;Food &amp; Wine&quot;.

<doc id="860059" wikidata="Q7852798" url="?curid=860059" title="Tunagate">
<text>Tunagate was a 1985 Canadian political scandal involving large quantities of tuna that had been declared unfit for human consumption that were sold to the public under order of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, John Fraser.

The story broke on September 17 in the CBC program &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot;. Fisheries inspectors had found that StarKist tuna, processed by a New Brunswick plant, had spoiled, and declared that it was “unfit for human consumption.”

A St. Andrews, New Brunswick plant had processed the tuna, and the forced destruction of a million cans of tuna would likely cause the plant to close down. The owners of the plant thus lobbied fisheries minister Fraser. He decided the tuna should be allowed on store shelves. He later defended himself saying he felt the business owners were right that the inspectors were too severe, or that the inspectors could have made a mistake. He also stated that he had two other independent groups test the tuna, but the laboratory that did these tests later revealed that their testing was not complete when Fraser made his decision.

The day after the story broke, both opposition parties attacked Fraser, and on Thursday, a recall of the tuna was announced. The following Monday Fraser resigned, mostly settling the affair. Rules were changed to make it impossible for ministers to overrule the decision of food inspectors.

The main unanswered question was how much Prime Minister Brian Mulroney knew at the time. Fraser at first stated that he had informed the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office. Mulroney originally said so as well. Almost immediately afterwards both recanted and stated that Mulroney had not been informed until the story had broken. Mulroney was also accused of being less than truthful when he told the &quot;New York Times&quot; he had fired Fraser as soon as he had heard of the affair, when in fact it had taken six days.

Despite intense national coverage for many weeks, in the end, the story ended up being mostly forgotten. Today there remains no evidence of any people getting sick from the tuna that was sold. Fraser&#x27;s career recovered and eventually he became Speaker of the House of Commons. The reputations of both StarKist Canada and the Mulroney government were hurt, however. StarKist, which had enjoyed a thirty-nine percent market share, saw it collapse to near zero, and in 1991, it pulled out of Canada. The four hundred employees of the New Brunswick plant were put out of work as one of the largest employers in Charlotte County shut down.

<text>Yorkdale Shopping Centre, Yorkdale Mall, or simply Yorkdale, is a major retail shopping centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Located at the southwest corner of the interchange between Highway 401 and Allen Road, it opened in 1964 as the largest enclosed shopping mall in the world. In the late 2010s, Yorkdale is the third largest shopping mall in Canada by floor space and has the highest sales per unit area of any mall in Canada, with current merchandise sales levels at roughly per square foot ( per square metre). At 18 million annual visitors, it is one of the country&#x27;s busiest malls. Many international retailers have ventured the Canadian market initially at Yorkdale.

Yorkdale is currently owned by a joint venture between the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS) through its subsidiary Oxford Properties Group and the Alberta Investment Management Corporation.

==History==
===Construction and design===

In the 1950s, the department store chain T. Eaton &amp; Co. bought a site at Dufferin Street and Highway 401 for a new massive, suburban location. In 1958, rival department store chain Simpson&#x27;s purchased an site to the east and the plan to build the complex was announced that year. Design of the mall was given to the Seattle firm of John Graham Consultants, except for the Simpson&#x27;s store, designed by John Andrews of John B. Parkin Associates. Howard Lesser was the planning and development consultant. Using Lesser&#x27;s market research, the developers determined how much floor space to give up to each category of retailer, and chose retailers who would appeal to a broad range of shoppers.

The mall opened on February 26, 1964, under the ownership of the Trizec Corporation. Its gross leasable area (GLA) was over , by far the biggest in Canada at the time. It was one of the largest shopping centres in the world. When it opened, Yorkdale was the first Canadian mall to include two major department stores: Simpson&#x27;s and Eaton&#x27;s, under the same roof at a cost of ($ in dollars). The mall had the shape of the letter L and was bordered in its extremities by Simpson&#x27;s and grocery store Dominion, while Eaton&#x27;s was at the junction of the two corridors; the mall also had a small public library. Yorkdale was the first major suburban mall constructed in Toronto. Located at the edge of the urbanized city, the new shopping centre was dependent on the construction of the Spadina Expressway, later renamed Allen Road after Metro chairman William R. Allen, as the developers would not proceed until the freeway was approved for construction.

The mall was constructed with a novel system for its retailers to receive merchandise. While other Canadian shopping centres had their receiving doors located at the backside, Yorkdale was constructed with a one-way, two-lane road for trucks running beneath the centre that leads directly to retailers&#x27; basement storages. The design of the mall included a tall atrium, wide halls and tall ceilings. The corridors still retain this look and feel although renovations in 2006 replaced the ceilings, windows, floors and skylights.

===Expansions and renovations===

In 1984, Yorkdale expanded with 75 new stores bringing an additional to the mall. It expanded again in 1986 to reach , having now more than doubled its number of stores from when it first opened.

In 1991, the Simpson&#x27;s store was converted to a The Bay store after Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company purchased the Simpson&#x27;s chain in 1978. An existing The Bay store, that had joined the mall in November 1988, was sold to Sears Canada in the process.

The &quot;Universal Man&quot; statue in the west parking lot was relocated from the base of the CN Tower—to accommodate the construction of the Rogers Centre (then known as SkyDome) in 1987—to Yorkdale in 1994.

In 1999, Yorkdale completed a major overhaul, adding a Rainforest Café restaurant, a Famous Players SilverCity movie theatre (which has since been taken over by Cineplex Entertainment and rebranded as such), and a two-storey Indigo Books and Music store on the north side of the northeast corner of the mall, facing Highway 401.

In 2005, a expansion on the former site of its Eaton&#x27;s department store increased the size of Yorkdale to , and increased the number of stores from about 210 to 260. A highlight of this expansion was the construction of a high glass atrium running in length, which hangs from an exterior support structure. The expansion added Old Navy, Zara, H&amp;M, and Home Outfitters as sub-anchors. This gave Yorkdale the title of the third-largest shopping mall in Ontario after sister mall Square One Shopping Centre in Mississauga and Cadillac Fairview&#x27;s Toronto Eaton Centre in downtown Toronto, ahead of Scarborough Town Centre in terms of retail floor space.
The renovation project continued into 2006 and 2007. This renovation matched the earlier sections of the mall to the style of the 2005 expansion. Key elements of this project included new public washrooms, the opening of a Moxies Grill &amp; Bar restaurant, and new sliding automatic doors at all entrances. An advertising campaign, branded as &quot;Change It Up!&quot; was launched in conjunction with the renovation and redevelopment, winning a MAXI Award from the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC) in 2007.

Expansion continued in the second half of the decade. In April 2008, Yorkdale opened a Michael Kors store. Later additions included Armani Exchange, Crate &amp; Barrel, BOSS, and a Tiffany &amp; Co.

In January 2011, Yorkdale announced another expansion, adding another , sufficient for 40 storefronts, and 800 underground parking spaces. This new wing took the space of the southwest parking lot. The expansion also relocated and doubled the number of seats at the food court, improved public access, and landscaped portions of the property. The expansion, costing $35 million, was opened in the summer of 2012, and completed in November 2012. The existing food court was relocated to a new location on the second and third levels of the former Eaton&#x27;s department store. The new food court, named &quot;Dine on 3&quot;, covers over two floors and features 18 different eateries, including A&amp;W, KFC, New York Fries, Subway, and the second Ontario location of Chick-fil-A (after the first at One Bloor in downtown Toronto). The second level of the foot court had an Illy café, which will be replaced with a Shake Shack restaurant on February 12, 2025, the third such location in Toronto. The area of the former food court was redeveloped into a new wing, which housed new stores including a Microsoft Store, DavidsTea, and a Tesla showroom, as well as a larger Apple Store. The new parking garage was built below the wing.
In 2012, Holt Renfrew expanded to the west by adding to the existing as part of another increase to the mall floor space.

In April 2013, Yorkdale announced a million expansion, which would add an additional of retail, featuring a three-level Nordstrom store and a Uniqlo store. This project involved the closure of the Rainforest Café (at Yorkdale since 1999), as well as the demolition of the multi-level parking garage at the southeast of the complex bordering Yorkdale Road. The project began in January 2014 and the new wing opened for business in late 2016. Rainforest Café has since been replaced with an expansion of Sport Chek.

In June 2013, Sears Canada announced the closing of their store at Yorkdale. The former Sears space was renovated to house Sporting Life and RH, both of which opened on October 19, 2017. The wing also includes Uncle Tetsu&#x27;s Cheesecake bakery, a CIBC branch, a relocated Starbucks, Landwer Café, a Johnnie Walker-branded Scottish whisky-tasting pop-up bar operated by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO), a Miele appliance showroom, and high-end restaurants. The Rest, which is an upscale mattress store owned by Sleep Country Canada, also opened in this wing.

The Milestones Grill and Bar restaurant, located near Hudson&#x27;s Bay, was closed in 2016. It was then announced that the American restaurant chain The Cheesecake Factory would open its first Canadian location in the mall. The location was renovated and expanded to accommodate the new restaurant and it opened to the public in November 2017. From its opening until the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the restaurant experienced wait times of up to three hours.

In 2017, mall owner Oxford Properties submitted an application to the City of Toronto for a block zoning plan to guide future development of the site. In the first phase, new buildings would be constructed along the Dufferin Street frontage, incorporating a boutique hotel, a cinema and new retail, with future phases being built on the north parking lot, to incorporate residential and office uses. In March 2019, the City launched a study on the re-development of the parking lots and other areas of the mall property to improve traffic as well as mixed-use for the site to include residential and retail use. If approved, the re-development would result in parking being moved underground. However, some residents in the neighbourhood are opposed to the development.

On June 26, 2020, the Microsoft Store closed as part of its parent&#x27;s winding down of the chain. From late 2020 to 2022, Nissan Studio occupied the space that was formerly the Microsoft Store and serves as a showroom for the Japanese automaker&#x27;s vehicles, not a dealership. In 2023, this space is occupied by Alo Yoga.

Most of the stores in the central section of Yorkdale are vacated for renovation since the second half of 2023.

===Incidents===
Two stabbings occurred at the mall in 2008. A security guard was shot in the chest, saved by his kevlar vest, confronting two teenage robbery suspects, intervening in a dispute with the two with another in the parking lot in April 2009. Both suspects were arrested.

In the first half of 2013, two shootings occurred at the mall. The first one took place in the external surface lot late on a Saturday night in March 2013, leaving one man dead and one man injured. In May 2013, a man was injured by shots fired into the Joey restaurant at midnight on a Friday night.

Yorkdale upgraded its security with a new $3.4 million video surveillance system that went into service in March 2014. The new system provides full 360-degree surveillance of the mall and the parking lots. It also includes licence plate recognition technology at parking entrances.

In August 2018, Yorkdale Shopping Centre was shut down after a spate of gun violence erupted at one of three Starbucks locations (since the renovation to Indigo Books and Music during the COVID-19 pandemic, there are two Starbucks locations in Yorkdale). Though nobody was seriously injured, it caused major delays on major Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) routes.

On August 29, 2021, Yorkdale Shopping Centre went into lockdown following a shooting inside the mall. One suspect was arrested.

==Retailers==
===Anchors===

The department stores at the mall are RH, Hudson&#x27;s Bay and Holt Renfrew. Junior anchors include Uniqlo, Muji, Sporting Life, Sport Chek, and Indigo Books and Music.

===Retail mix===

When first opened, Yorkdale had a large number of clothing retailers along with large department stores in the mix of stores. Yorkdale was the first Canadian mall to include two major department stores: Simpson&#x27;s and Eaton&#x27;s, under the same roof. Eaton&#x27;s went bankrupt in 1999 and its space was redeveloped into a new wing that opened in 2005.

Since the late 1990s onward, Yorkdale&#x27;s management has focused on attracting luxury brand retailers, especially those selling clothing and accessories, as well as high-end electronics, a strategy also adopted by Sherway Gardens, owned by rival mall operator Cadillac Fairview. These include Versace, Bulgari, Burberry, Cartier, Chanel, Gucci, Prada, Kate Spade, Tory Burch, Moncler, Jimmy Choo, Apple, and Bose before Bose closed most physical retail operations, including its Yorkdale location. Yorkdale has also attracted American and international retailers seeking to expand to Canada. Yorkdale bought out the lease of Sears in 2014 to reallocate that space for higher-priced department stores.

Yorkdale owner Oxford Properties places a requirement on each tenant to renovate regularly. When each tenant renews its lease with the mall, they are required to renovate their store.

===Canadian firsts===
Yorkdale has been the point of entry into the Canadian market for many widely known international commercial enterprises. Companies that have opened or plan on opening their first Canadian store at Yorkdale include:
* Apple Store — May 2005, relocated to new wing in December 2012.
* Bath &amp; Body Works — September 2008
* Crate &amp; Barrel — Late 2008
* Furla — October 2019
* GEOX — May 2005

* Salvatore Ferragamo Italia S.p.A. — July 2013
* White House Black Market — October 2013
* Tumi — November 2013
* The Cheesecake Factory — November 2017

According to the International Council of Shopping Centers, more than 30 American retailers contacted mall management, wanting to open their first Canadian stores in Yorkdale after Crate &amp; Barrel revealed that their first store outside the United States would open in Yorkdale in 2008.

Yorkdale&#x27;s Nordstrom was the fourth location in Canada, opening after the locations at the Toronto Eaton Centre, Calgary&#x27;s Chinook Centre and Ottawa&#x27;s Rideau Centre. In 2023, Nordstrom announced their exit from the Canadian market, which resulted in the closure of their Yorkdale location. Yorkdale&#x27;s Uniqlo store was the second of its kind in Canada when it opened in late 2016, a month after the first Uniqlo opened at the Toronto Eaton Centre the previous September. Yorkdale&#x27;s Lego Store is the second one in Canada after the first opened at Fairview Mall.

==Temporary exhibits==

From 2019 to mid-2023, Yorkdale used otherwise vacant retail space in the centre of the mall for paid-admission temporary exhibits with gift shops.

<text>Rumspringa (), also spelled &#x27; or &#x27; ( , from Pennsylvania German ; compare Standard German ), is a rite of passage during adolescence, used in some Amish communities. The Amish, a subsect of the Anabaptist Christian movement, intentionally segregate themselves from other communities as a part of their faith. For Amish youth, the Rumspringa normally begins at age 16 and ends when a youth chooses either to be baptized in the Amish church or to leave the community. For Wenger Mennonites, Rumspringa occurs mostly between ages of 17 and 21.

Not all Amish use this term (it does not occur in John A. Hostetler&#x27;s extended discussion of adolescence among the Amish), but in sects that do, Amish elders generally view it as a time for courtship and finding a spouse. A popular view exists by which the period is institutionalized as a rite of passage, and the usual behavioral restrictions are relaxed, so that Amish youth can acquire some experience and knowledge of the non-Amish world.

== Etymology ==
 is a Pennsylvania German noun meaning &#x27;running around&#x27;. It is a cognate of the colloquial German verb . Dialects do not derive from standard languages, but as a cognate, this expression is closely related to the Standard German verb meaning &#x27;to jump around or about&#x27;. The Standard German term is a compound word of the adverb (around, about) and the verb (&#x27;to jump&#x27;). However, in some southern German dialects, ( in Swabian) means &#x27;to run&#x27;. This term/concept also is used as a separable verb, i.e., (&#x27;to jump around&#x27;) / (&#x27;he jumps around&#x27;).

In Pennsylvania German, the prefix is a contraction of – a development which is also all but general to spoken standard German. The infinitive (and gerund) form is standard in Pennsylvania German and other forms of general Upper German.

== Popularized view ==
Amish adolescents may engage in rebellious behavior, resisting or defying parental norms. In many cultures, enforcement may be relaxed, and misbehavior tolerated or overlooked to a degree. A view of has emerged in popular culture that this divergence from custom is an accepted part of adolescence or a rite of passage for Amish youth.

Among the Amish, however, simply refers to adolescence. During that time a certain amount of misbehavior is unsurprising and is not severely condemned (for instance, by or shunning). Adults who have made a permanent and public commitment to the faith would be held to the higher standards of behavior defined in part by the Schleitheim and Dordrecht confessions. In a narrow sense, the young are not bound by the because they have not taken adult membership in the church. Amish adolescents do remain, however, under the strict authority of parents who are bound to , and there is no period when adolescents are formally released from these rules.

It is the period when a young person is considered to have reached maturity and is allowed to attend the Sunday night &quot;singings,&quot; which are central to courtship among the Amish. According to Amish sources, a youth who attends one of these events before the age of 16 might be force-fed warm milk from a spoon, as a good-natured reminder to respect the social boundaries. Members of the local church district often attend the singings and usually bring younger children along.

A minority of Amish youth do diverge from established customs. Some may be found:
* Wearing non-traditional clothing and hair styles (referred to as &quot;dressing English&quot;)
* Driving vehicles other than horse-drawn vehicles (for communities that eschew motor vehicles)
* Not attending home prayer
* Drinking and using other recreational drugs

Not all youth diverge from custom during this period; approximately half in the larger communities and the majority in smaller Amish communities remain within the norms of Amish dress or behavior during adolescence. Almost 90% of Amish teenagers choose to be baptized and join the Amish church.

== Leaving the community ==
Some Amish youth do indeed separate themselves from the community, even going to live among the &quot;English,&quot; or non-Amish Americans, experiencing modern technology. Their behavior during this time does not necessarily prevent them from returning for adult baptism into the Amish church.

Most of them do not wander far from their family&#x27;s homes during this time, and large numbers (85–90%) ultimately choose to join the church. However, this proportion varies from community to community, and within a community between more and less acculturated Amish. For example, Swartzentruber Amish have a lower retention rate than Andy Weaver Amish (90% vs 97%; although most of Swartzentruber Amish do not allow teenagers to leave the community during rumspringa at will). This figure was significantly lower as recently as the 1950s. Leaving the Amish community is not a long-term trend, and was more of a problem during the early colonial years.

== Variations ==

As among the non-Amish, there is variation among communities and individual families as to the best response to adolescent misbehavior. Some Amish communities hold views similar to Old Order Mennonite, and Conservative Mennonites in seeking more productive, spiritual activities for their youth. Some even take up meditation.

In some cases, patience and forbearance prevail, and in others, vigorous discipline. Far from an open separation from parental ways, the misbehavior of young people during the is usually furtive, though often collective (this is especially true in smaller and more isolated populations). They may or may not mingle with non-Amish in these excursions. The age is marked normatively in some Amish communities by allowing the young man to purchase a small &quot;courting buggy&quot;, or – in some communities – by painting the yard-gate blue (traditionally meaning &quot;daughter of marriageable age living here&quot;; the custom is noted by A. M. Aurand in &quot;The Amish&quot; (1938), along with the reasonable caution that sometimes a blue gate is just a blue gate). There is some opinion that adolescent rebellion tends to be more radical, more institutionalized (and therefore in a sense more accepted) in the more restrictive communities.

The nature of the period differs from individual to individual and from community to community. In large Amish communities like those of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, Holmes and Wayne Counties, Ohio, and Elkhart and LaGrange Counties, Indiana, the Amish are numerous enough that an Amish youth subculture exists. During , the Amish youth in these large communities will join one of various groups ranging from the most rebellious to the least. These groups are not necessarily divided across traditional Amish church district boundaries, although they often are. In many smaller communities, Amish youth may have a much more restricted , and likewise may be less likely to partake in strong rebellious behavior, as they lack the anonymity of larger communities.

Wenger Mennonites youth go through a period of starting at age 17 and typically ending at marriage, a few years older than the Amish do. Since most of the youth get baptized when they are ages 16 to 19, they typically do not get into the type of serious offenses of the most &quot;disorderly&quot; of the Amish youth.

== Literature ==
=== Scholarly and documentary works ===
Rumspringa is mentioned in the standard works about the Amish, like Hostettler’s &quot;Amish Society&quot;, the works of Donald Kraybill, &quot;An Amish Paradox&quot; by Hurst and McConell and others, but there is only one scholarly book about it:
* Richard A. Stevick: &quot;Growing up Amish: The Teenage Years&quot;, Baltimore, 2007.

There is also one documentary book:
* Tom Shachtman: &quot;Rumspringa: To Be or Not to Be Amish&quot;, New York, 2006.

====Television and film====
&quot;Devil&#x27;s Playground&quot; (2002) was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Documentary and for three documentary Emmy AwardsBest Documentary, Editing, and Direction. Spin-offs of the film include a book of transcribed interviews, titled &quot;Rumspringa: To Be or Not to Be Amish&quot;, and a UPN reality television series, &quot;Amish in the City&quot;.

===Fiction===
Levi Miller&#x27;s 1989 novel &quot;Ben&#x27;s Wayne&quot; describes the rumspringa of an 18-year-old Amish youth in Holmes County, Ohio, during the fall of 1960. According to Richard A. Stevick, the novel is a realistic portrayal of the rumspringa of that time.

=== Biographies ===
Rumspringa is also mentioned in several biographies of ex-Amish like e.g. Ira Wagler&#x27;s &quot;Growing up Amish&quot;.

=== Other ===
There are several books in the literary genre Amish romance that deal with rumspringa, but mostly with no gain in knowledge about the subject. Levi Miller&#x27;s novel &quot;Ben&#x27;s Wayne&quot; is an exception, since it is a realistic portrayal of rumspringa in 1960.
*Levi Miller: &quot;Ben&#x27;s Wayne&quot;, Intercourse, PA, 1989.

<text>A latke ( &quot;latke&quot;; sometimes romanized &quot;latka&quot;, lit. &quot;pancake&quot;) is a type of potato pancake or fritter in Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine that is traditionally prepared to celebrate Hanukkah. 

==Etymology==
The word comes from the Yiddish &#x27;, itself from the East Slavic &#x27;, a diminutive of &quot;&quot; &#x27;small fried pancake&#x27;, which in turn is from Hellenistic Greek ἐλάδιον &quot;eládion&quot;, &#x27;(olive) oil&#x27;, diminutive of Ancient Greek ἔλαιον &quot;élaion&quot;, &#x27;oil&#x27;.

Its Modern Hebrew name, &#x27; ( &quot;levivá&quot;), plural &quot;levivot&quot;, is a revival of a word used in the Book of Samuel to describe a dumpling made from kneaded dough, part of the story of Amnon and Tamar. Some interpreters have noted that the homonym &#x27; ( &quot;leváv&quot;) means &quot;heart&quot;, and the verbal form of l-v-v ( &quot;l-b-b&quot;) occurs in the Song of Songs as well.

==History==
Some version of latkes goes back to at least the Middle Ages. They were likely made of cheese (probably either ricotta or curd cheese), fried in poppyseed oil or butter, and served with fruit preserves. These cheese latkes were the most common kind of latke in Ashkenazi communities until the 19th century when the potato arrived in eastern Europe. At the time, the cheapest and most readily available cooking fat was schmaltz, rendered poultry fat (usually from a goose or chicken), and due to Jewish dietary laws, which prohibit the mixing of meat and dairy products, alternatives to the cheese latke were introduced. These included buckwheat, rye flour, or root vegetables endemic to the region, such as turnips. As the potato became popular in eastern Europe, it was quickly adopted to the point that today, &quot;latke&quot; is almost synonymous with potatoes.

The latke is traditionally prepared during the Hanukkah holiday to commemorate the miracle of the oil in the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem lasting eight days.

==Variations==
Latkes today are most commonly made with potatoes, although other vegetables are also sometimes used. There are two main varieties: those made with grated potato and those made with puréed or mashed potato. The textures of these two varieties are different.

===Grated potato version===
Latkes made of grated potatoes are popular. They are prepared by grating potatoes and onions with a box grater or food processor; then, excess moisture is squeezed out. The grated potatoes are then mixed with eggs and flour or matzo meal; a vegan version uses chickpea flour and potato starch instead of eggs. The latkes are fried in batches in an oiled pan. The thickness is a matter of personal preference.

===Puréed potato version===
The dough for puréed potato latkes is puréed in a food processor. This form of latke is easier to shape and has a &quot;pudding-like consistency&quot;.

===Other variations===
Before the potato, latkes were and in some places still are, made from a variety of other vegetables, cheeses, legumes, or starches. Modern recipes often call for the addition of onions and carrots. Other versions include zucchini, sweet onion, gruyere (for french onion flavor), and sweet potatoes. Sephardi Jews make latkes with zucchini and garlic (&quot;mücver&quot;), omitting dairy-based toppings (yogurt) when served as a side for roasts or meat. Latkes are often served with either sour cream or applesauce.

<doc id="860080" wikidata="Q3266542" url="?curid=860080" title="Beatmania III">
<text>beatmania III is a rhythm video game created by Konami. Gameplay is essentially the same as in the &quot;beatmania&quot; series, with a few enhancements to the hardware.

The &quot;beatmania III&quot; series was relatively short-lived, spanning only 2 years. It had five releases, the last one being &quot;Beatmania III The Final&quot; in 2002. In 2016, &quot;TCA Regional News&quot; reported that the Beatmania III is a rare find, with only five machines available throughout the United States. 

==Hardware==
===Audio system===
&quot;beatmania III&quot; cabinets feature a total of 10 speakers. There are four mid-range speakers stacked vertically on either side of the screen, and two subwoofers located on the front of the machine. The cabinet also features a pair of headphone jacks, so that both players may use their own headphones to enjoy the game&#x27;s audio. Using headphones does not disable the external speakers.

===Effector system===
Whereas the original Beatmania features simply an &quot;Effector&quot; button, &quot;beatmania III&quot; has an extensive panel for using a number of different effectors. Available effectors vary widely, including Echo, Low Pass, High Pass, Flanger, Phaser, Volume Bass, Lo-Fi, and several others. The chosen effector can be applied to just the background track, just the sounds created by the player, or both, and the intensity of the effect can be adjusted with two parameter knobs. Enabling the effector is achieved by simply pressing the foot pedal.

===Foot pedal===
While the original 5-keys-and-turntable layout remains unchanged, &quot;beatmania III&quot; adds a foot pedal for each player. In normal play, this enables or disables different sound-altering effectors. Some songs have a &quot;foot&quot; version that adds a seventh column with green note bars that is played by using the foot pedal. The game also allows players to set the foot pedal so that it functions as any one of the game&#x27;s 5 keys.

===Floppy drive===
&quot;beatmania III&quot; has a feature unique to the Bemani series: a 3.5-inch floppy disk drive. By inserting any blank Windows-formatted disk before starting, the player can have the game create files on the disk used to record personal best scores. After playing, the disk is then removed from the drive for later repeated use in &quot;beatmania III&quot;, or for looking at scores using one&#x27;s personal computer. The floppy disk was also required to unlock secret songs or game modes on some versions of the game.

==Releases==
The &quot;beatmania III&quot; series was only released as an arcade game. No console releases were ever produced even though both Japanese and North American IIDX controllers have input ports for a bass pedal. Each release added songs from the Beatmania games their titles refer to, including most previous arcade releases.

<doc id="860085" wikidata="Q2931458" url="?curid=860085" title="CHOI-FM">
<text>CHOI-FM is a French-language FM radio station that broadcasts on the frequency 98.1 MHz out of Quebec City, Quebec, Canada, with a talk format. Locally, it is known as &quot;Radio X&quot; (a reference to &quot;Generation X&quot;, as most of CHOI&#x27;s listeners consider themselves). It has been owned by Genex Communications since July 1996. The Bureau of Broadcast Measurement ratings released in December 2004 revealed that CHOI was the most popular radio station in the city with 443,100 listeners, up from 380,500 earlier in the year. The station is well known for airing controversial ideas and populist opinions. The station has become a target of various groups, notably feminists and gay activists, as well as prominent politicians, for some controversial political statements.

Following a ruling by the CRTC, the station&#x27;s licence lapsed, with its renewal application denied, in 2004 for failing &quot;to comply with the Radio Regulations 1986 (the Regulations) as well as CHOI&#x27;s Code of Ethics, adherence to which is required by one of its conditions of licence&quot;. Pending a court challenge, the station was permitted to stay on-air without a licence.

On May 8, 2006, Genex announced it would sell the station to RNC Media. The transaction – strictly speaking, the issuing of a new licence to RNC Media on the same frequency rather than a simple transfer of ownership – was approved by the CRTC on October 20, 2006.

==Main hosts of the station==

Jeff Fillion was the most popular host at the station. He was the morning man, hosting with his staff &quot;Le monde parallèle de Jeff&quot; (Fillion&#x27;s Parallel World) every weekday morning. Over the years, his ideas and opinions made him the city&#x27;s most controversial radio host. He teamed up for a time with longtime morning man André Arthur. Fillion was sued numerous times by many well-known people around the province because of his controversial comments. The station&#x27;s problems with the CRTC are mostly attributed to him and his comments.

In the past, he was well known for his show&#x27;s contests. For example, he created a contest in the late 1990s where a woman would win a breast implants surgery on Good Friday - &quot;Good Friday&quot; being &quot;Vendredi saint&quot; in French, and the words &quot;saint&quot; and &quot;sein&quot; (breast) have the same pronunciation.

On the air, on the morning of March 17, 2005, Fillion announced that he was immediately resigning as host of the morning show. In May 2005, the former host started giving interviews to various Quebec media where he complained about what he says is a lack of respect towards him by the station&#x27;s owners. He says that they have not offered him any severance pay since he left the air. The owners replied that they have offered him various jobs inside their company but he has refused all of them. The station also claimed that Fillion&#x27;s demands for almost $2 million in severance pay were unreasonable. He is apparently also asking to be cleared of all responsibility in current or future lawsuits against him or the station. This would bring the total to $5 million.

Gilles Parent was hired by the station in 2001. He came from CHIK-FM, CHOI&#x27;s rival station, to host the &quot;Le retour de Gilles Parent&quot; every weekday afternoon. His thoughts and opinions are less controversial and are expressed in a much more respectful manner than Fillion&#x27;s.

Denis Gravel (known as &quot;The fucking news guy&quot;, name given by Korn&#x27;s former guitar player) hosted &quot;Le Char de hits&quot; until 2004, when it became the most popular radio program of the area at lunch time. He also did the news segments during Fillion&#x27;s morning show. When Fillion resigned, Gravel replaced him as the host of the morning show. On March 16, 2004, he became well known in the province for inadvertently revealing the name of one of the victims of a highly publicized child prostitution case during Parent&#x27;s afternoon show, while performing a live commentary after a day in court, where popular radioman Robert Gillet of competitor station CJMF-FM had stood in the accused box.

==Dispute with the CRTC==

On July 13, 2004, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission ruled that the radio station would be shut down because it kept airing offensive and insulting remarks even after being put on probation in 2002. This meant that the station would be forced to stop transmitting on the night of August 31, 2004, when its licence expired. This prompted a huge march in the streets of Quebec City on July 22 when 50,000 people walked through the streets of the city to support the station, claiming the right of freedom of speech and opinion. It was the largest march in the capital city of Quebec since the 1960s.

On August 10, 2004, the station staged a protest against the CRTC&#x27;s decision on Parliament Hill in Ottawa where 5,000 Quebec fans of the station went to the country&#x27;s capital to demonstrate their support for the station. CHOI aired their regular afternoon show live from Ottawa.

On August 11, 2004, the station filed an appeal in federal court to extend its licence and to reverse the CRTC&#x27;s decision.

On August 25, 2004, the CRTC and the federal government did not object to the station&#x27;s request to continue its normal operations during the court proceedings. This meant that even though the station&#x27;s licence expired on August 31, 2004, it was permitted to continue transmitting after that date and as long as the court procedures are in progress.

On May 24, 2005, the court started to hear the case. For four days, the station&#x27;s lawyers pleaded to the three judges of the court that the CRTC overstepped its authority in ordering the shutdown of the station. They claimed that it should not be possible for the CRTC to shut down a station based only on the contents of the station&#x27;s shows. The lawyers also pleaded that the CRTC could have used more moderate methods to punish the station, such as imposing a fine. Both the station and the CRTC have said that should they lose, they will appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.

On September 1, 2005, the court ruled against the station, stating in its decision that &quot;freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of speech do not mean freedom of defamation, freedom of oppression and freedom of opprobrium.&quot; This meant that the station would be required shut down within 20 days unless it tried to contest the decision in the Supreme Court. On June 14, 2007, the Supreme Court refused to hear the case. Had the sale to RNC Media not gone through, the decision would have effectively forced CHOI-FM to stop broadcasting at 23:59 the same day. However, RNC Media had already received CRTC approval for its &quot;new&quot; licence for 98.1, making the court decision moot.

The dispute has also had major political implications, as it was the primary reason that Sylvain Légaré was elected in Vanier in a by-election in 2004 for the ADQ. In addition, radio personality André Arthur was elected as an independent in the 2006 federal election in Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier, and most of the other seats in the area went to the Conservative Party of Canada, which had previously been extremely weak in Quebec.

== Later history ==
After RNC Media acquired the station, CHOI shifted to alternative rock, becoming the first French-language alternative rock station in Canada, but continued to report as an active rock station on Mediabase. As of 2010, the station was delisted from Mediabase, and moved to its current talk radio format.

On August 28, 2018, RNC Media announced the sale of CHOI to Leclerc Communication (owner of CJEC-FM and CFEL-FM) for an undisclosed sum, later revealed to be $19 million. As it owns the maximum number of French-language stations it can own on the FM band in Quebec City, the company would have had to divest a station or seek an exemption. The CRTC approved the deal, under the condition that Leclerc divest one of its stations in Quebec City. However, as Leclerc refused to agree to this condition, the company called off the purchase.

<text>Stephen Groombridge FRS (7 January 1755 – 30 March 1832) was a British merchant and astronomer.

==Life==
He was born at Goudhurst in Kent on 7 January 1755. He succeeded when about 21 to the business in West Smithfield of a linen draper named Greenland, to whom he had been apprenticed. Later, and until 1816, he was a successful West India merchant. He lived mainly at Goudhurst, where he built a small observatory; but moved to Blackheath in 1802.

In 1806, using a then new transit circle built by Edward Troughton, he began compiling a star catalogue of stars down to about eighth or ninth magnitude. He spent ten years making observations on the Groombridge Transit Circle and another ten years doing reductions of the data (correcting for refraction, instrument error and clock error). In 1827 he suffered a &quot;severe attack of paralysis&quot; from which he never fully recovered. Others continued the work, continuing with corrections for aberration and nutation among others.

Groombridge died in Blackheath. His &quot;Catalogue of Circumpolar Stars&quot; was published posthumously in 1838 with the help of fellow astronomer George Biddell Airy and others. An earlier edition had been published in 1833 but was found to contain errors and was withdrawn. In 1842, one of the stars in his catalogue, Groombridge 1830, was discovered by Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander to have a very high proper motion. For many decades its proper motion was the highest known; today it still occupies third place.

<doc id="860100" wikidata="Q1291126" url="?curid=860100" title="Loughton tube station">
<text>Loughton() is a London Underground station, serving the suburban town of Loughton in the Epping Forest District of Essex. It is on the Central line between Buckhurst Hill and Debden stations, and is in Travelcard Zone 6. The station is entirely above ground, and platforms are accessed by staircases which rise from ground level.

It is the larger of the two Underground stations in the town of Loughton, with Debden station being the smaller. It acts as a terminus for services from Ealing Broadway at peak hours.

==History==

The original station was opened by the Eastern Counties Railway on 22 August 1856 and formed the terminus of the branch from London. The actual location of the station building was on the site of what is now the garden and emergency exit of 179-181 Loughton High Road (Aura Bar &amp; Grill in 2024) and of No. 9 Station Road, on a continuation of what eventually became the goods sidings, the line running across what are now the houses and gardens on the west side of Station Road. The post-1865 goods and carriage sidings no longer exist and were located where the present car parks are. The pre-1865 station also had sidings and a coal wharf, extending almost to what is now St Mary&#x27;s Church. This station is extensively documented in H. .W Paar and others, &quot;Loughton&#x27;s First Station&quot; 2002 and in Pond, Strugnell and Martin &quot;The Loughton Railway 150 years on&quot;, 2006. There was also an excursion station or platform constructed along the westernmost edge of the goods yard site; this was used for the many thousands of excursionists who arrived at Loughton to visit nearby Epping Forest. The excursion station building, single-storey and brick built, was extant in 1935, but was demolished in the ensuing decade; it was replaced by a parcels and goods station, itself removed in the 1990s.

It was re-sited some 500 yards to the south on 24 April 1865 as part of the extension of the line to Epping and Ongar. A new station was opened on 28 April 1940 in readiness for London Underground trains, which took over the service from British Railways (Eastern Region) on 21 November 1948.

==The station today==
The current station is of notable architectural importance and is a Grade II listed building. Designed by John Murray Easton for the London and North Eastern Railway, on behalf of London Transport, the main structure consists of a high, square block dominated by large arched windows at high level. The main elevation is flanked by symmetrical wings and, to the south, a single storey extension. The whole building, as well as the associated disused signal cabin and sub-station, is finished in carefully bonded, incised, gault bricks. The ticket hall takes the form of a lofty arched hall, from which leads a subway that gives access to the two island platforms. The platforms are dominated by graceful, gull-winged shaped reinforced canopies that were altered during 1980s renovations. Although some original platform furniture has been lost the timber platform benches, with the London Underground roundel forming the seat backs, survive.

The station has four platform faces and three tracks, with the middle bi-directional track usually used for services that terminate at the station. Those eastbound services that terminate at Loughton mostly return to central London, although some go into Loughton sidings (usually after the evening peak and late at night) which can accommodate 10 trains. A traincrew depot (&quot;the Powerhouse&quot;) was converted from the matching electrical substation to the north-east of the station in 2006.

==Services and connections==
===Services===
Loughton station is on the Central line between Buckhurst Hill to the west and Debden to the east. The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:
*9 tph eastbound to Epping
*3 tph terminate here
*9 tph westbound to West Ruislip
*3 tph westbound to Northolt
===Connections===
London Buses routes 20, 167, 397, W14 and school route 677 serve the station.

<text>Buckhurst Hill is a London Underground station, serving the suburban town of Buckhurst Hill in the Epping Forest District of Essex. It is on the Central line between Woodford and Loughton stations, and is in London fare zone 5. It is the larger of the two Underground stations in the town of Buckhurst Hill, with Roding Valley station being the smaller.

==History==

The station opened on 22 August 1856 as part of the Eastern Counties Railway branch from London to Loughton. It originally had staggered platforms, with the main buildings on the down side (tracks heading away from London). The 1856 station house survives to the south of the present platforms, but most of the present station dates from 1892, when the entrance was moved to Victoria Road. The building is similar to that at Billericay. Both were designed by W. N. Ashbee, the chief architect of the Great Eastern Railway, of which the station was a part, which was, from 1923, to become part of the London and North Eastern Railway.

The station was transferred to London Underground ownership as part of the New Works Programme, 1935-1940 scheme that saw the electrification of the branch to form part of the Central line. This occurred on 21 November 1948. The station maintains its late Victorian ambiance to a surprising extent.

When the line was electrified a pedestrian underpass was built in order to connect the two parts of Queens Road previously joined by a level crossing. At the same time a pair of exit/entrances to the south of the station were built giving direct access to Lower Queens Road and Queens Road via the new underpass. These exits were closed in 1982, but reopened in May 2018 in order to provide access to the station for mobility impaired passengers.

For the purposes of fare charging it is in Zone 5. As of 2007 it is the only station on the eastern portion of the Central line in that zone. Passengers travelling from the station leaving in either direction must cross a zone boundary.

<doc id="860103" wikidata="Q1217714" url="?curid=860103" title="In the Time of the Butterflies (film)">
<text>In the Time of the Butterflies is a 2001 feature film, produced for the Showtime television network, directed by Mariano Barroso and based on Julia Álvarez&#x27;s book of the same name. The story is a fictionalized account of the lives of the Mirabal sisters, Dominican revolutionary activists, who opposed the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo and were assassinated on November 25, 1960.

In the film, Salma Hayek played one of the sisters, Minerva, and Edward James Olmos plays Trujillo. Marc Anthony has a minor role as Minerva&#x27;s first love, and the impetus for her later revolutionary activities.

==Plot==
The film begins with pictures and video of the actual victims of Trujillo. During the montage, a title card appears that says:

:&quot;From 1930 to 1961, General Rafael Leónidas Trujillo held absolute control of the Dominican Republic&quot;.
:&quot;His secret alliance with the church, aristocrats, intellectuals and the press were the foundation of his dictatorship&quot;.
:&quot;His formula to remain in power was simple: murder anyone who opposed him&quot;.
:&quot;More than 30,000 people were executed during his regime of terror...&quot;

The scene shifts to a prison cell, where one of his victims, Minerva Mirabal (Salma Hayek), recounts the events of the story.

Minerva and her three sisters, Patria (Lumi Cavazos), Dedé (Pilar Padilla), and María Teresa &quot;Maté&quot; (Mía Maestro), live on a farm in rural Ojo De Agua. Minerva, the outspoken sister, convinces her father, Enrique Mirabal (Fernando Becerril), to send her, Patria, and Maté to a boarding school. The sisters spend five years away at school, during which time Minerva captures the attention of Trujillo (Edward James Olmos), who notices her at a school play.

When school is over, Minerva wishes to study to become a lawyer, but women are not allowed in law school. The sisters return to the farm, and Minerva soon meets and falls in love with Virgilio &quot;Lio&quot; (Marc Anthony), a member of the Dominican resistance, who gives her the nickname &quot;Butterfly&quot;, or Mariposa in Spanish. Lio&#x27;s activities during a college protest are noticed, and he is forced to leave the country out of fear for his life, though he continues to write to Minerva.

Minerva, along with her family, is invited to a formal ball at Trujillo&#x27;s palace, where she dances with him. During their dance, Minerva asks for permission to attend law school, but Trujillo declines. He grabs Minerva inappropriately, and she responds by recoiling and slapping him in the face. Her family quickly rushes to her side, and Trujillo allows them to leave. The next day, the chief of police, Captain Peña (Pedro Armendáriz, Jr.), arrives at the family farm and takes Minerva&#x27;s father away. The sisters spend several weeks dealing with the police bureaucracy, trying to locate their father, before it&#x27;s suggested that there is a way Minerva can get her father out of prison. Minerva goes to the palace, and Trujillo suggests that her father can leave if she stays. Minerva points out that her mother is waiting outside and would &quot;appreciate his hospitality&quot; too. Trujillo decides that they should leave it to chance (a dice roll) to determine if Minerva and her family go free, or if Minerva stays at the palace while her family is released. Minerva accepts, but asks to &quot;up the stakes&quot;—if she wins, she goes free and also gets to attend law school, and if she loses, Trujillo can &quot;have his wish&quot;. She rolls the dice and wins, and Trujillo lets her leave.

Minerva&#x27;s victory is hollow. Her father is released from prison, but has been tortured and soon dies. While attending his funeral, the police chief delivers to Minerva a letter permitting her to attend law school. Minerva&#x27;s hatred of Trujillo is intense, but she decides to accept his &quot;gift&quot; because she views it as her only way to effectively oppose him.

While in law school, Minerva discovers that Lio has been killed by field agents of Trujillo Servicio de Inteligencia Militar on foreign soil. She meets other members of the opposition, who, through Lio, know of her as &quot;Butterfly&quot;. She becomes a member of the resistance, and over time Patria and Maté learn of her activities and become involved too. She falls in love with Manolo Tavárez (Demián Bichir), a fellow law student and member of the resistance, and they are married.

When Minerva graduates from law school, Trujillo is present to pass out the diplomas. All the other students receive diplomas, but he refuses to give Minerva hers, saying he agreed to allow her to attend law school, but not to practice law.

After law school, Minerva has children but continues her opposition activities. After a series of increasingly dangerous events, she, Maté, and many resistance members are arrested and sent to jail. Minerva becomes a symbol. Other prisoners, their guards, and many outsiders secretly voice support for &quot;the Butterflies&quot;.

Eventually, Minerva and Maté are released from jail, but their husbands and Patria&#x27;s are still held captive. The women continue their efforts to locate their husbands. Trujillo stops by to visit Minerva at her home, and she asks for his help to get their husbands released. Trujillo vows to soon help Minerva &quot;end her troubles&quot;.

While returning from a trip to visit their husbands, Minerva, Patria, and Maté are stopped on the road by a large group of Trujillo&#x27;s policemen and soldiers. They are taken some distance off the main road, and the men surround them and beat them to death.

Another title card appears at the end that says:

:&quot;The Death of the Mirabal Sisters was the final blow to the regime of Leónidas Trujillo, who was assassinated six months later&quot;.
:&quot;Several of the children of the Mirabal sisters held important posts in the later democratic governments of the Dominican Republic&quot;.
:&quot;The day of the sisters&#x27; death, November 25th, is observed in many Latin American countries as the International Day Against Violence Towards Women&quot;.

<text>A vision quest is a rite of passage in some Native American cultures. Individual Indigenous cultures have their own names for their rites of passage. &quot;Vision quest&quot; is an English-language umbrella term, and may not always be accurate or used by the cultures in question. 
Among Native American cultures who have this type of rite, it usually consists of a series of ceremonies led by elders and supported by the young person’s community. The process includes a complete fast for four days and nights, alone at a sacred site in nature which is chosen by elders for this purpose. Some communities have used the same sites for many generations. During this time, the young person prays and cries out to the spirits that they may have a vision, one that will help them find their purpose in life, their role in a community, and how they may best serve the People. Dreams or visions may involve natural symbolism – such as animals or forces of nature – that require interpretation by elders. After their passage into adulthood, and guided by this experience, the young person may then become an apprentice or student of an adult who has mastered this role.
When talking to Yellow Wolf, Lucullus Virgil McWhorter came to believe that the person fasts, and stays awake and concentrates on their quest until their mind becomes &quot;comatose.&quot; It was then that their Weyekin (Nez Perce word) revealed itself.

==Use by non-Native Americans==

Non-Native, New Age and &quot;wilderness training&quot; schools offer what they call &quot;vision quests&quot; to the non-Native public. However, despite the name, these experiences may bear little resemblance to the traditional ceremonies beyond fasting and isolation. Such use of the term &quot;vision quest&quot; has been criticized as &quot;cultural appropriation&quot;, with those leading the exercises derided as &quot;plastic shamans&quot;. Such exercises may include New Age versions of a sweat lodge, which has at times led to untrained people causing harm and even death, such as in the James Arthur Ray manslaughter incident, which involved a 36-hour, non-Native idea of a vision quest, for which the participants paid almost $10,000.

Like a number of other Indigenous ceremonies, the vision quest has been mentioned in statements by Indigenous leaders concerned about the protection of ceremonies and other Indigenous intellectual property rights; one of these documents is the 1993 Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality. In 2007 the United Nations adopted the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), which has given further support to Indigenous people&#x27;s rights to protect their cultures and ceremonies, and address restitution when intellectual, religious and spiritual property is taken without their free, prior and informed consent or in violation of their laws, traditions and customs.

<text>Love beads are one of the traditional accessories of hippies. They consist of one or more long strings of beads, frequently handmade, worn around the neck by both sexes. The love bead trend probably evolved from the hippie fascination with non-Western cultures, such as those of Africa, India, and Native America, which make common use of similar beads.

==Quotes==

<text>Duke of Medina Sidonia () is a peerage grandee title of Spain in Medina-Sidonia, holding the oldest dukedom in the kingdom, first awarded by King John I of Castile in 1380. His father, Henry II of Castile (c.1334-1379), had an illegitimate son named Enrique de Castilla y de Sousa with Juana de Sousa, but after being made a Duke by his half-brother in 1380, he died in 1404, without a successor. The title then returned to the Crown.

The title of Duke of Medina Sidonia was awarded a second time on February 1445 by King John II of Castile to Juan Alonso de Guzmán, 3rd Count of Niebla (1410-1468). 
 They were once the most prominent magnate family of the Andalusian region, the best-known of whom, Don Alonso Pérez de Guzmán y Sotomayor, 7th Duke of Medina Sidonia, commanded the Spanish Armada at the end of the 16th century. The defeat at the hands of weather and the English in 1588 brought disgrace to this family. The House of Medina Sidonia traces its descent from Alonso Pérez de Guzmán (1265-1309).

<doc id="860127" wikidata="Q1740208" url="?curid=860127" title="Kevin Lowe">
<text>Kevin Hugh Lowe (born April 15, 1959) is a Canadian professional ice hockey executive, former coach and former player. Lowe was the vice-chairman of Oilers Entertainment Group until his retirement on August 2, 2022 (behind only Glen Sather in terms of Cup wins as Oilers&#x27; GM), having formerly served as head coach and then general manager of the Edmonton Oilers. As a defenceman, he played for the Edmonton Oilers and the New York Rangers from 1979 to 1998.

Over his career, Lowe won the Stanley Cup six times. In 1990, he was awarded the King Clancy Memorial Trophy. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2020 and named to the Order of Hockey in Canada in 2021.

== Background and early career ==
In 1976 Lowe joined the Quebec Remparts of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. An Anglophone, he learned French as the team used it, and in 1978 was named captain, the first English captain in team history. Over 201 games with the Remparts Lowe scored 42 goals and 131 assists for 173 points, along with 245 PIM. At one point he was in negotiations with the Birmingham Bulls of the World Hockey Association (WHA), but was reluctant to join them, and when it was announced the Bulls would not join the NHL the point was moot.

He was drafted in the first round, 21st overall, of the 1979 NHL Entry Draft by the Edmonton Oilers, the franchise&#x27;s first-ever NHL draft selection.

== NHL playing career ==
Lowe played 13 full seasons in his first stint with the Oilers and helped lead them to five Stanley Cup championships. As one of the alternate captains during his first tenure, Lowe was regarded as the third among equals when it came to the leaders of the Oilers&#x27; 1980s dynasty, along with Wayne Gretzky (team captain) and Mark Messier (alternate captain).

During the Oilers&#x27; run to the 1988 Stanley Cup, Lowe played with a broken wrist and a full cast, a potential explanation for his point totals (0-2-2 in 19 games), yet he didn&#x27;t miss a single playoff game. On the night the Oilers won the Cup, Wayne Gretzky informed the media that Lowe was also hiding broken ribs throughout the playoffs.

Lowe became team captain for the 1991–92 season after Mark Messier was traded to the New York Rangers. Leading the Oilers to an ugly 1-5-1 start in early October, the team overcame the change of captaincy to finish with a 36-34-10 record.

The Oilers traded him to the New York Rangers, in December 1992 (Lowe was a restricted free agent). In 1994, he won the Stanley Cup with six other ex-Oilers—Glenn Anderson, Jeff Beukeboom, Adam Graves, Craig MacTavish, Mark Messier, and Esa Tikkanen—bringing his total to six.

In 1996, he re-joined the Oilers as a free agent and played another full season. He started the 1997–98 season with the Oilers as well but only played 7 games before being forced to retire due to an inner-ear virus that affected his balance.

In total, Lowe played in 1254 career regular season games, scoring 84–347–431 with 1498 penalty minutes. He added another 214 playoff games, scoring 10–48–58 and earning 192 penalty minutes.

Lowe played more regular season and playoff games in an Oilers uniform than anyone in franchise history (1037 and 172). He was the team&#x27;s first-ever NHL draft pick and scored their first NHL goal (a power play goal against the Chicago Blackhawks assisted by Wayne Gretzky and Brett Callighen; Gretzky&#x27;s first NHL point). Many, including Gretzky himself, believe the Great One tipped the puck on its way to the net. During his professional hockey career, Lowe did not play a single game in the minor leagues, and his teams only once failed to make the playoffs.

Lowe was named to play in the NHL All-Star Game in 1984, 1985, 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1993. He also won the league&#x27;s King Clancy Memorial Trophy in 1990.

== Post playing career ==
Lowe joined the Oilers staff in 1998 as an assistant coach. In 1999, he took over head coaching duties from Ron Low. He was head coach for just a single season, winning 32 out of 82 games (32-26-16-8), and getting the Oilers to the first round of the playoffs where they fell to the Dallas Stars in five games. He was promoted to general manager of the Oilers in 2000 when long-time GM Glen Sather left for the New York Rangers. He remained the Oilers&#x27; Executive Vice President and General Manager until the 2008–09 season when he was promoted to President of Hockey Operations.

Lowe has also been responsible for assisting Canadian national hockey teams. He was a member of the management team for the Canadian men&#x27;s ice hockey team at the 2002 Winter Olympics that won the gold medal and was also named a manager for the 2004 World Cup of Hockey team. In addition, he has managed Team Canada at World Hockey Championships.

In 2005, the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League created the Kevin Lowe Trophy (Trophée Kevin Lowe), awarded annually to the player in the QMJHL judged to be the best defensive defenceman.

In the 2006–2007 NHL offseason, Lowe offered contracts to restricted free agents Thomas Vanek, which was matched by the Buffalo Sabres, then to Anaheim forward Dustin Penner, which was signed. Following the offer sheet to Penner, Brian Burke, then-GM of the Anaheim Ducks, publicly blamed Lowe for inflation in player salaries, accusing Lowe of &quot;colossal stupidity.&quot; Then head coach Craig MacTavish responded by referring Burke to the Wizard of Oz, &quot;You comb his hair, put a white shirt on, wheel him out in front of the camera and he&#x27;ll say whatever you guys want.&quot; Lowe did not respond to Burke&#x27;s attacks until July 4, 2008, on a local radio show, Total Sports with Bob Stauffer, calling Burke a &quot;moron&quot; and &quot;a media junkie.&quot;

Lowe&#x27;s No. 4 was not retired by the Oilers until 2021; he had been the only player in the Oilers&#x27; NHL history to wear No. 4 until he issued it to Taylor Hall, the Oilers&#x27; first-overall draft pick in 2010. Kris Russell wore No. 4 for the Oilers as well until the beginning of the 2021-2022 season.

In 2021, Lowe was appointed to the board of directors for Play On! Canada. Play On! Canada is the world&#x27;s largest road hockey tournament.

==Personal life==
Lowe was the fourth child of Clifford and Jessie Lowe (after Carol, Nancy, and Ken). The Lowe family operated a dairy in Lachute, Quebec, and were one of the few English Catholic families in the region, with most people being francophones. Clifford was involved in operating a local hockey rink, so his children skated there from an early age, with Lowe starting when he was 3 years old.

His brother Kenneth later worked as the Head Medical Trainer of the Oilers. He is married to Canadian Olympian Karen Percy and is the father of defenceman Keegan Lowe, who was drafted by the Carolina Hurricanes in the third round, 73rd overall of the 2011 NHL Entry Draft. Kevin is an uncle of Melissa Lowe, a Canadian bobsleigh athlete.

== Awards and achievements ==
Lowe was named to the Hockey Hall of Fame as part of the class of 2020. Primarily a defensive defenceman during his playing career, Lowe was the first defensive defenceman named to the Hall since Rod Langway in 2002. Lowe was the final member of the Oilers&#x27; &quot;Group of Seven&quot; to be inducted into the Hall.

On February 26, 2021, Lowe was named to the Order of Hockey in Canada by Hockey Canada, in recognition of his career and contribution to the game in Canada.

<text>U.S. Route 201 (US 201) is part of the nationwide system of United States Numbered Highways. It runs for entirely within the state of Maine and is a spur route of U.S. Route 1. Its southern terminus is in Brunswick at US 1 and Maine State Route 24 Business. Its northern terminus is at the Canada–US border near Jackman (a terminus it shares with Maine State Route 6), where it connects to Quebec Route 173.

Between Solon and its northern terminus, US 201 is known as the Old Canada Road [[National Scenic Byway]].

==Route description==
US 201 begins in Brunswick along SR 24 Business (former SR 24) at an interchange with US 1. It follows the Kennebec River from Gardiner, to The Forks, where it winds away from the river and runs up into the north woods mountains. The highway crosses the Appalachian Trail at Caratunk.

North of The Forks, US 201 climbs in elevation over Johnson Mountain and around Coburn Mountain, near Upper Enchanted and Parlin Pond Townships. Before reaching Jackman, the road peaks at the Attean Pond Lookout, a popular rest area, before descending into town. US 201 intersects the northern end of SR 15 in Jackman and is cosigned with SR 6 for the remaining north to the Canadian border. The road continues through parts of Moose River and Dennistown before reaching the Armstrong–Jackman Border Crossing at Sandy Bay Township. US 201 and SR 6 ends as the highway crosses into Quebec, Canada and becomes Route 173.

A former alignment designated US 201A runs through the towns of Madison and Norridgewock.

==History==

US 201 follows old river trading routes of the Abenaki people. Parts of Benedict Arnold&#x27;s expedition to Quebec took place along the route that today make up US 201. On June 15, 2000, the route was designated a National Scenic Byway.

US 201 used to be New England Interstate Route 20 (NEI 20) in the 1920s. The original 1922 plan had NEI 20 starting in Portland. The southern half was later shifted east to start in Brunswick (the realignment may have been done prior to actual signing of the route.) The southern end of the original NEI 20 is now SR 100 from Portland to Augusta. The Brunswick end of the original NEI 20 intersected with NEI 1 (which is now US 1), which remained the southern terminus of US 201 until the construction of the US 1 freeway, at which point its terminus was moved to its current location on SR 24.

Since its designation in 1926, US 201 has only undergone one major realignment. The original highway used to run through Norridgewock, Anson, and Madison on its way to Solon. In 1954, US 201 was moved to a new eastern alignment which completely bypasses this area and the existing alignment was redesignated US 201A. US 201 has also undergone various other minor route adjustments, but largely maintains its original 1926 routing.

==Major intersections==













== Somerset County Alternate route ==
U.S. Route 201 Alternate (US 201A) is the designation of a former alignment of US 201 in the towns of Skowhegan, Norridgewock, Madison and Anson. The route is long and forms a western loop of US 201, which was rerouted in 1954 to bypass to the east. US 201A runs along the Kennebec River over its entire length.

The southern terminus of US 201A is at US 2, US 201 and State Route 104 in Skowhegan. The northern terminus is at US 201 in Solon, a terminus it shares with State Route 8.

US 201A is also part of the Arnold Highway (named for Benedict Arnold), established in 1931 over the original US 201.

US 201A is completely overlapped with other routes due to various realignments of the routes signed over it.

=== Route description ===
US 201A begins in Skowhegan just south of the Kennebec River, at an intersection with US 2, US 201, and SR 104 (which has its northern terminus here). US 201A begins overlapped with US 2 and the two routes proceed southwest along the southern bank of the river on the way to Norridgewock. Upon reaching town, the highway intersects with SR 8 and SR 139. SR 139 has its western terminus at this intersection while SR 8 northbound joins the concurrency. Just to the west, US 2 splits off to the southwest, while US 201A goes to the northwest with SR 8 in tow. US 201A and SR 8 are cosigned for the remainder of their lengths.

US 201A and SR 8 continue along the riverbank, turning north into Madison and intersecting with SR 43 and SR 148. US 201A and SR 8 then turn west, joining the converging routes to cross the river as a four-route concurrency. On the west side of the bridge lies the town of Anson, where US 201A and SR 8 split to the north off SR 43 and SR 148, which continue west concurrently. The highway turns north along the west bank of the river into the village of North Anson, intersecting the eastern end of SR 234 before meeting SR 16 just to the north. SR 16 joins US 201A and SR 8, proceeding north along the river out of town, and eventually passing into Solon. Nearing the riverbank once more, SR 16 splits to continue north along the river, while US 201A and SR 8 turn northeast to cross the river. Both routes terminate at US 201.

<doc id="860132" wikidata="Q17141634" url="?curid=860132" title="Codification (linguistics)">
<text>In linguistics, codification is the social process of a language&#x27;s natural variation being reduced and features becoming more fixed or subject to prescriptive rules. Codification is a precursor to standardization: the development of a standard variety of a language.

Codifying a language can vary from case to case and depends on the stage of standardization that might have already occurred naturally. It typically means to develop a writing system, set up normative rules for grammar, orthography, pronunciation, and usage of vocabulary as well as publish grammar books, dictionaries and similar guidelines. In cases where several variants exist for a specific aspect, e.g. different ways of spelling a word, decisions on which variant is going to be the standard one have to be made.

In some countries such codification is done by a body constituted by the state, such as the . Codification often happens due to new inventions, changes in values or other cultural influences. After the process of decolonialization, many African states had to decide whether they wanted to keep the colonial language or chose one (or more) of their indigenous language varieties as official languages, which made language planning necessary.

In a well-known model of language planning by Einar Haugen, codification is only the second step. Step one is the selection process, step three is the implementation of the changes in society and step four is the elaboration of vocabulary (especially technical terms). In the process of language planning, two major levels exist: corpus planning and status planning (Heinz Kloss). Codification is part of the corpus planning of a language, because the &quot;body&quot; of the language itself is being planned as opposed to status planning, where the prestige and usage of a language is enhanced:

*Corpus planning: Codification of a language (step 2); elaborating its functions to meet language needs (step 4)
*Status planning: Selection of a language (step 1); implementing its functions by spreading it (step 3)

Whether the codification is successful depends heavily on its acceptance by the population as well as its form of implementation by the government, e.g. promoting its prestige and spread, teaching the codified norm in school and language courses, and so on.

<doc id="860136" wikidata="Q1239133" url="?curid=860136" title="The Honourable Schoolboy">
<text>The Honourable Schoolboy (1977) is a spy novel by John le Carré. George Smiley must reconstruct an intelligence service in order to run a successful offensive espionage operation to save the service from being dismantled by the government. In 1977, the book won the Gold Dagger award for the best crime novel of the year and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. &quot;The Honourable Schoolboy&quot; is the second novel in the omnibus titled either &quot;Smiley Versus Karla&quot; or &quot;The Quest for Karla&quot;.

==Chronology==
This is the sixth le Carré spy novel featuring George Smiley. &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot;, &quot;The Honourable Schoolboy&quot; and &quot;Smiley&#x27;s People&quot; were later published as an omnibus edition titled &quot;Smiley Versus Karla&quot; in 1982.

==Plot==
In 1974 George Smiley, the chief of the British secret intelligence service referred to as The Circus, is repairing the damage done to their operations by double agent Bill Haydon and looking for opportunities to target Karla, the Moscow Centre spymaster. The Circus is operating in a minimal way with most of its overseas facilities closed, its agents withdrawn and its operations under close political supervision. Smiley and analysts Connie Sachs and Doc di Salis look into investigations suppressed by Haydon and find that a historic investigation of a money laundering operation in Laos by Sam Collins could indicate a Moscow intelligence operation.

Through code and contacts already in Southeast Asia, Smiley dispatches Jerry Westerby, a newspaper reporter in Tuscany and occasional Circus operative, to Hong Kong under the guise of a sports journalist. Westerby traces the Soviet money to Drake Ko, a local businessman with links to both the criminal underworld and the British establishment. London establishes that Drake has a brother, Nelson, who is a high-ranking Chinese official and who has been spying on the Chinese for the Soviets.

Westerby, following up leads provided by Smiley in London, interviews Drake&#x27;s English mistress Lizzie Worthington; undercover, Smiley had interviewed both her parents and the husband she had walked out on. Westerby discovers that Drake has been attempting to set up an illicit air route into China. Charlie Marshall and Tiny Ricardo (both pilots and smugglers) were approached by Drake to carry opium into China and return with a package. The flights were never completed, and Smiley surmises that the package was Nelson, who wished to defect from China. The money supplied by Moscow to Drake was intended for Nelson, to be accessed after he left China. Sam Collins, who had previously employed Lizzie in Laos as a minor field agent, is brought back into the Circus. Peter Guillam, Smiley&#x27;s right-hand man, is suspicious of Collins, especially when he discovers Collins has been having extended meetings with Saul Enderby of the Foreign Office and Oliver Lacon, the permanent Cabinet secretary currently overseeing the Circus for the government. It is Enderby and Lacon who are supplying Smiley with the permissions and funds to run Westerby in Asia.

Nelson would be a prime intelligence source on both Soviet and Chinese capabilities, but political maneuverings between London and Washington hamper the investigation. It is finally agreed that the Circus will run the operation to capture Nelson and interrogate him afterwards, with all information shared with the United States. However, the Circus is given a limited time to carry out the operation and if Nelson is not captured by the time limit set, Drake Ko will be arrested and handed over to the US to face drug-related charges.

Smiley instructs Westerby to become more proactive in his investigations, referred to as &quot;shaking the tree,&quot; to force Drake into moving forward more quickly with his plans to extract Nelson. Frost, the banker from whom Westerby had acquired Ko&#x27;s identity, is brutally murdered; Westerby and his Hong Kong colleague Luke are shown the mutilated body. Westerby travels on his own in and out of war-torn Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand searching for Ricardo, who he eventually finds. Ricardo says he had been told Westerby was dead; Westerby ignores this and convinces Ricardo that he knows enough about Drake&#x27;s attempts to bring opium into China to, under his sports writer&#x27;s cover, blackmail Drake with Ricardo&#x27;s help. Ricardo agrees but then tries to kill him with a car bomb as Westerby leaves his compound. On his return to Hong Kong, Westerby finds Luke murdered in his apartment; Drake&#x27;s right-hand man, Tiu, has confused the two Westerners and murdered the wrong journalist. Westerby becomes increasingly stressed, guilty over Luke&#x27;s death, and begins to romantically obsess over Lizzie.

Collins is instructed to blackmail Lizzie into bugging and informing on Drake. The Circus now has enough information to predict Drake&#x27;s plan, which replicates his own escape from China decades earlier via sea. Westerby ignores orders to return to London and contacts Lizzie to profess his love. Smiley, along with Guillam and Circus and CIA operatives, arrive in Hong Kong to oversee the final stages of the operation. Smiley and Guillam catch Westerby at Lizzie&#x27;s apartment, where Smiley has come to question Lizzie personally about Drake&#x27;s plans. Smiley sends Guillam and body-man Fawn with Westerby to force him to board a plane out of Hong Kong, but Westerby assaults them viciously and escapes. He then abducts Lizzie and, through questioning her, realizes Drake&#x27;s plan. He and Lizzie travel to the island where Drake will meet with Nelson, and Westerby sends Lizzie back, arranging a time and place to meet with her that evening to escape the country. Alone and watchful, Westerby reaches the rendezvous point where Drake intends to meet his brother. Westerby almost kills Tiu, and warns Drake of Smiley&#x27;s plans in an effort to make a deal which would protect Lizzie from reprisal. But Nelson is already approaching, and Drake cares about nothing but being reunited with his brother. At their appointed meeting place on the beach, CIA forces seize Nelson and Westerby is killed by Fawn.

In the aftermath, it is revealed that the British government (Lacon, Collins and Enderby) have made a deal behind the scenes where the CIA will interrogate Nelson alone, freezing out Smiley and the Circus. The success of the operation yields top promotions for Enderby, who becomes Chief, and Collins, who becomes Head of Operations. Smiley and Connie Sachs are retired and most of the older generation of Circus personnel are moved on, even as Smiley is revered within the Circus for getting the agency back in the government&#x27;s favor. In the aftermath of the debacle, Guillam contemplates the possibility that Smiley allowed the CIA to gain the upper hand so as to have himself removed as head of the Circus.

==Adaptations==
Jonathan Powell, producer of &quot;Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy&quot; (1979), said the BBC considered producing &quot;The Honourable Schoolboy&quot; but a production in Southeast Asia was considered prohibitively expensive and therefore the BBC instead adapted the third novel of the Karla Trilogy, &quot;Smiley&#x27;s People&quot; (1979), which was broadcast in 1982.

In 1983 the BBC adapted &quot;The Honourable Schoolboy&quot; to radio; Martin Jarvis played Jerry Westerby and Peter Vaughan played George Smiley. A subsequent BBC radio adaptation, first broadcast in 2010 in the Classic Serial slot, featured Simon Russell Beale as George Smiley and Hugh Bonneville as Jerry Westerby, as part of Radio 4&#x27;s year-long project to adapt all eight Smiley novels.

<doc id="860138" wikidata="Q1931224" url="?curid=860138" title="Sesquilinear form">
<text>In mathematics, a sesquilinear form is a generalization of a bilinear form that, in turn, is a generalization of the concept of the dot product of Euclidean space. A bilinear form is linear in each of its arguments, but a sesquilinear form allows one of the arguments to be &quot;twisted&quot; in a semilinear manner, thus the name; which originates from the Latin numerical prefix meaning &quot;one and a half&quot;. The basic concept of the dot product – producing a scalar from a pair of vectors – can be generalized by allowing a broader range of scalar values and, perhaps simultaneously, by widening the definition of a vector.

A motivating special case is a sesquilinear form on a complex vector space, . This is a map that is linear in one argument and &quot;twists&quot; the linearity of the other argument by complex conjugation (referred to as being antilinear in the other argument). This case arises naturally in mathematical physics applications. Another important case allows the scalars to come from any field and the twist is provided by a field automorphism.

An application in projective geometry requires that the scalars come from a division ring (skew field), , and this means that the &quot;vectors&quot; should be replaced by elements of a -module. In a very general setting, sesquilinear forms can be defined over -modules for arbitrary rings .
==Informal introduction==
Sesquilinear forms abstract and generalize the basic notion of a Hermitian form on complex vector space. Hermitian forms are commonly seen in physics, as the inner product on a complex Hilbert space. In such cases, the standard Hermitian form on is given by
:formula_1

where formula_2 denotes the complex conjugate of formula_3 This product may be generalized to situations where one is not working with an orthonormal basis for , or even any basis at all. By inserting an extra factor of formula_4 into the product, one obtains the skew-Hermitian form, defined more precisely, below. There is no particular reason to restrict the definition to the complex numbers; it can be defined for arbitrary rings carrying an antiautomorphism, informally understood to be a generalized concept of &quot;complex conjugation&quot; for the ring.

==Convention==
Conventions differ as to which argument should be linear. In the commutative case, we shall take the first to be linear, as is common in the mathematical literature, except in the section devoted to sesquilinear forms on complex vector spaces. There we use the other convention and take the first argument to be conjugate-linear (i.e. antilinear) and the second to be linear. This is the convention used mostly by physicists and originates in Dirac&#x27;s bra–ket notation in quantum mechanics. It is also consistent with the definition of the usual (Euclidean) product of formula_5 as formula_6.

In the more general noncommutative setting, with right modules we take the second argument to be linear and with left modules we take the first argument to be linear.

== Complex vector spaces ==
:Assumption: In this section, sesquilinear forms are antilinear in their first argument and linear in their second.

Over a complex vector space formula_7 a map formula_8 is sesquilinear if
:formula_9
for all formula_10 and all formula_11 Here, formula_12 is the complex conjugate of a scalar formula_13

A complex sesquilinear form can also be viewed as a complex bilinear map
formula_14
where formula_15 is the complex conjugate vector space to formula_16 By the universal property of tensor products these are in one-to-one correspondence with complex linear maps
formula_17

For a fixed formula_18 the map formula_19 is a linear functional on formula_7 (i.e. an element of the dual space formula_21). Likewise, the map formula_22 is a conjugate-linear functional on formula_16

Given any complex sesquilinear form formula_24 on formula_7 we can define a second complex sesquilinear form formula_26 via the conjugate transpose:
formula_27
In general, formula_26 and formula_24 will be different. If they are the same then formula_24 is said to be . If they are negatives of one another, then formula_24 is said to be . Every sesquilinear form can be written as a sum of a Hermitian form and a skew-Hermitian form.

=== Matrix representation ===

If formula_7 is a finite-dimensional complex vector space, then relative to any basis formula_33 of formula_34 a sesquilinear form is represented by a matrix formula_35 and given by
formula_36
where formula_37 is the conjugate transpose. The components of the matrix formula_38 are given by formula_39

=== Hermitian form ===
:&quot;The term Hermitian form may also refer to a different concept than that explained below: it may refer to a certain differential form on a Hermitian manifold.&quot;

A complex Hermitian form (also called a symmetric sesquilinear form), is a sesquilinear form formula_40 such that
formula_41
The standard Hermitian form on formula_42 is given (again, using the &quot;physics&quot; convention of linearity in the second and conjugate linearity in the first variable) by
formula_43
More generally, the inner product on any complex Hilbert space is a Hermitian form.

A minus sign is introduced in the Hermitian form formula_44 to define the group SU(1,1).

A vector space with a Hermitian form formula_45 is called a Hermitian space.

The matrix representation of a complex Hermitian form is a Hermitian matrix.

A complex Hermitian form applied to a single vector
formula_46
is always a real number. One can show that a complex sesquilinear form is Hermitian if and only if the associated quadratic form is real for all formula_47

=== Skew-Hermitian form ===

A complex skew-Hermitian form (also called an antisymmetric sesquilinear form), is a complex sesquilinear form formula_48 such that
formula_49
Every complex skew-Hermitian form can be written as the imaginary unit formula_50 times a Hermitian form.

The matrix representation of a complex skew-Hermitian form is a skew-Hermitian matrix.

A complex skew-Hermitian form applied to a single vector
formula_51
is always a purely imaginary number.

==Over a division ring==
This section applies unchanged when the division ring is commutative. More specific terminology then also applies: the division ring is a field, the anti-automorphism is also an automorphism, and the right module is a vector space. The following applies to a left module with suitable reordering of expressions.

===Definition===
A -sesquilinear form over a right -module is a bi-additive map with an associated anti-automorphism of a division ring such that, for all in and all in ,
:formula_52

The associated anti-automorphism for any nonzero sesquilinear form is uniquely determined by .

===Orthogonality===
Given a sesquilinear form over a module and a subspace (submodule) of , the orthogonal complement of with respect to is
:formula_53

Similarly, is orthogonal to with respect to , written (or simply if can be inferred from the context), when . This relation need not be symmetric, i.e. does not imply (but see &quot;&quot; below).

===Reflexivity===
A sesquilinear form is reflexive if, for all in ,
:formula_54 implies formula_55
That is, a sesquilinear form is reflexive precisely when the derived orthogonality relation is symmetric.

===Hermitian variations===
A -sesquilinear form is called -Hermitian if there exists in such that, for all in ,
:formula_56
If , the form is called -&quot;Hermitian&quot;, and if , it is called -&quot;anti-Hermitian&quot;. (When is implied, respectively simply &quot;Hermitian&quot; or &quot;anti-Hermitian&quot;.)

For a nonzero -Hermitian form, it follows that for all in ,
:formula_57
:formula_58
It also follows that is a fixed point of the map . The fixed points of this map form a subgroup of the additive group of .

A -Hermitian form is reflexive, and every reflexive -sesquilinear form is -Hermitian for some .

In the special case that is the identity map (i.e., ), is commutative, is a bilinear form and . Then for the bilinear form is called &quot;symmetric&quot;, and for is called &quot;skew-symmetric&quot;.
===Example===
Let be the three dimensional vector space over the finite field , where is a prime power. With respect to the standard basis we can write and and define the map by:
:formula_59
The map is an involutory automorphism of . The map is then a -sesquilinear form. The matrix associated to this form is the identity matrix. This is a Hermitian form.

==In projective geometry==

:Assumption: In this section, sesquilinear forms are antilinear (resp. linear) in their second (resp. first) argument.

In a projective geometry , a permutation of the subspaces that inverts inclusion, i.e.
: for all subspaces , of ,
is called a correlation. A result of Birkhoff and von Neumann (1936) shows that the correlations of desarguesian projective geometries correspond to the nondegenerate sesquilinear forms on the underlying vector space. A sesquilinear form is &quot;nondegenerate&quot; if for all in (if and) only if .

To achieve full generality of this statement, and since every desarguesian projective geometry may be coordinatized by a division ring, Reinhold Baer extended the definition of a sesquilinear form to a division ring, which requires replacing vector spaces by -modules. (In the geometric literature these are still referred to as either left or right vector spaces over skewfields.) 
==Over arbitrary rings==
The specialization of the above section to skewfields was a consequence of the application to projective geometry, and not intrinsic to the nature of sesquilinear forms. Only the minor modifications needed to take into account the non-commutativity of multiplication are required to generalize the arbitrary field version of the definition to arbitrary rings.

Let be a ring, an -module and an antiautomorphism of .

A map is -sesquilinear if
:formula_60
:formula_61
for all in and all in .

An element is orthogonal to another element with respect to the sesquilinear form (written ) if . This relation need not be symmetric, i.e. does not imply .

A sesquilinear form is reflexive (or &quot;orthosymmetric&quot;) if implies for all in .

A sesquilinear form is Hermitian if there exists such that
:formula_62
for all in . A Hermitian form is necessarily reflexive, and if it is nonzero, the associated antiautomorphism is an involution (i.e. of order 2).

Since for an antiautomorphism we have for all in , if , then must be commutative and is a bilinear form. In particular, if, in this case, is a skewfield, then is a field and is a vector space with a bilinear form.

An antiautomorphism can also be viewed as an isomorphism , where is the opposite ring of , which has the same underlying set and the same addition, but whose multiplication operation () is defined by , where the product on the right is the product in . It follows from this that a right (left) -module can be turned into a left (right) -module, . Thus, the sesquilinear form can be viewed as a bilinear form .

<text>The F platform, or F-body, was General Motors&#x27; rear-wheel drive pony car automobile platform from 1967 until 2002. It was based partially on the GM X platform, which was used for compact applications instead of the sporting intent of the F-Body. The only two vehicles to have been built using the F-Body platform are the Chevrolet Camaro and the Pontiac Firebird. The fourth character in the Vehicle Identification Number for an F-body car is &quot;F&quot; on model year 1985 and up vehicles. Earlier Camaros and Firebirds had differing VIN codes, but are now commonly referred to as F-bodies.

==First generation (1967–1969)==
The first F-body cars were produced in 1966 for the 1967 model year, as GM&#x27;s response to the Ford Mustang and later the Mercury Cougar. Originally designed strictly as the platform for the Camaro, Pontiac engineers were given a short amount of time prior to the Camaro&#x27;s release to produce a version that matched their corporate styling as well. The F-Body was available as both a hardtop coupe and a cloth-top convertible. As was GM policy at the time, Chevrolet and Pontiac both installed their own engines; however, the engine lineups were similar. Both cars could be had with either division&#x27;s base inline six-cylinder engine, a V8 engine of approximately 5.3 liters (327 cu in for Chevrolet, 326 cu in for Pontiac), or a larger V8 engine of approximately 6.6 liters (396 cu in for Chevrolet, 400 cu in for Pontiac). Due to delays with the design of the second-generation car, the 1969 models were produced longer than usual.

==Second generation (1970–1981)==

The second generation F-body cars were actually released in February 1970, due to extensive delays in the design and production of the new body style. Both cars grew considerably, with fairly drastic changes in styling to match each brand&#x27;s updated styling across the lineup. Only Pontiac received engine options in the 7.5 L range in the earlier years of the second generation - (454 cu in for Chevrolet is in technical manuals, but was never produced), 455 cu in for Pontiac. However, this engine option would be discontinued as emissions and fuel-economy restrictions made their production costs prohibitive. Performance continued to decline through 1981, as power levels dropped and weight increased.

==Third generation (1982–1992)==

The third generation of the F-Body was introduced for 1982, as a major redesign with a more modern look and a lighter, better-handling car. In a move that would later happen across almost all GM models, the Firebird switched from Pontiac-designed engines to the same Chevrolet engines that powered the Camaro. This was also the first generation of F-Body to be available with a four-cylinder, the Iron Duke. The last Firebird to be built with an engine not available in the Camaro was the 1989 Turbo Trans Am, which had a turbocharged 3.8 L Buick V6, derived from the Buick Regal.

==Fourth generation (1993–2002)==

The fourth and final generation of the F-platform was released in 1993. It was an extensive revision to the third generation car, instead of a clean-sheet design. It was produced until the platform was canceled at the end of the 2002 model year. Unlike most of the prior years, the engine choices were simplified considerably; each year, on both the Camaro and the Firebird, there was only one V6 and one V8 available. For 1993 to 1995, the V6 was the 3.4 L (208 cu in) 60°; 1996–2002 cars received the 3.8L (231 cu in) 3800 Series II V6. 1993–1997 V8 cars shipped with the 5.7L (350 cu in) LT1, while 1998–2002 cars received the 5.7L (346 cu in) LS1. Both engines were available with the 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission. V6 engines with a manual transmission had a five-speed unit; the manual for V8 cars was the T-56 six-speed, manufactured by either Borg-Warner or Tremec. An optional Hurst-supplied shifter was also available on V8 models.

The fifth-generation Camaro was released in 2010 (after a seven-year layoff) as a 2010 model, using the Zeta chassis, with a VIN code of &quot;F&quot;. According to GM, and contrary to rumors of a Firebird companion, no accompanying Pontiac model was planned before the discontinuation of the Pontiac brand in 2009. The sixth generation of the Camaro utilizes the GM Alpha platform shared with the Cadillac ATS and CTS.

<text>The General Motors J platform, or J-body, is an automobile platform that was used by General Motors for compact cars from the 1982 to 2005 model years. The third generation of compact cars designed by GM, the J-body marked the introduction of front-wheel drive for its compact model lines, simultaneously replacing the rear-wheel drive H-body and the European U-body platforms, the latter being a stretched version of the original rear-wheel drive T-body. The J-body was marketed as a world car, with GM brands selling versions of the platform in North America, Europe, Australia, and Japan; in markets outside of North America, the model line was packaged as a mid-size car.

Outside North America, the use of the J platform was phased out after the 1980s in favor of the Opel-based GM2900 platform. In North America, the introduction of the Saturn S-Series would lead to the consolidation of the J-body to the Chevrolet and Pontiac brands.

Following several major revisions, the J platform remained in use into the 21st century; in June 2005, the final example (a Pontiac Sunfire) was produced. Introduced by Saturn for 2003, the GM Delta platform is the fourth generation of compact cars from General Motors.

== Background ==
The design of the J-car began in 1976. Originally, the J-car was only intended for the Chevrolet and Pontiac brands, but soon thereafter Oldsmobile and Buick were added. At the time, GM-controlled divisions in different parts of the world manufactured totally different rear-wheel drive C-segment cars – the Chevrolet Vega in America, the Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Ascona in Europe, the Holden Torana in Australia and the Isuzu Florian in Japan. It was decided that a common replacement would be developed to eliminate duplication of engineering effort and ensure parts interchangeability – a practice known as badge engineering or platform-sharing. In November 1979, subsequent to the second fuel crisis and only 14 months before the cars introduction, it was decided to create a Cadillac derivative as well. Aside from a hefty price tag, the hastily developed Cimarron had little to distinguish it from the other J-car offerings.

In continental Europe, the car was sold as the Opel Ascona. In Britain, it was known as the Vauxhall Cavalier. Irrespective of badging, European production of the J-body occurred in plants in Germany, Belgium, and Britain. It was generally well received but was narrowly beaten to the European Car of the Year accolade by the Renault 9. The Vauxhall Cavalier version was particularly successful in Britain, where it was the second best selling car in 1984 and 1985 and managed around 800,000 sales across a seven-year production run. At the time, it set new standards for performance and economy in this size of car in Europe; for instance, the 1.6 petrol engined Cavalier for the British market had a top speed of 105 mph, compared to the 101 mph top speed of the 2.0 petrol engined Ford Cortina – its key competitor for a year until the Ford Sierra was launched in 1982. Due to the exterior dimensions, and the engines offered being in compliance with Japanese regulations, the platform was classed in the favorable &quot;compact&quot; designation allowing the Isuzu Aska to compete with other Japanese made products sold in the domestic market at the time. Isuzu also supplied kits for Holden&#x27;s J-car version, the Camira., whilst correspondingly - Holden manufactured the GM Family II engines installed in J-body cars manufactured worldwide, and also the station wagon bodywork for the Camira was supplied to Vauxhall in the UK for its estate version of the Cavalier II.

The fourth character in the Vehicle Identification Number for a J-body car is &quot;J&quot;.

==Development==
The platform received two major cosmetic redesigns, in 1988 and a more thorough makeover in 1995, along with major powertrain revisions. The 1995 makeover was only sold in North America, as General Motors subsidiaries in other countries had replaced it (mainly with cars based on the GM2900 platform). This makeover had originally been planned for the 1992 model year when work begain in 1988, but General Motors&#x27; bad finances forced them to postpone it twice.

A variety of convertible versions were developed as well, from fully official to purely aftermarket. In all cases, final assembly of convertibles was subcontracted by General Motors; in North America by American Sunroof Corporation (ASC); in Brazil by Envemo and Sulam, and in Europe by Keinath and . Hammond &amp; Thiede&#x27;s version originated with the Karosseriefabrik Voll, which was taken over by H&amp;T in 1985.

==Models==
Over its 24-year production run, the GM J platform would be sold under 16 different nameplates (five under the Pontiac brand alone). During the 1980s, a version of the J platform would be marketed by every division of General Motors in North America (with the exception of GMC).

Over 5.8 million of the original (pre-1995 facelift) J-cars were sold in North America. Approximately 10,150,000 GM J platform cars were sold across eleven marques on six continents from 1982 through 1997. Consequently, it is the fifth best selling automobile platform in automotive history.

<text>Kannada literature is the corpus of written forms of the Kannada language, which is spoken mainly in the Indian state of Karnataka and written in the Kannada script.

Attestations in literature span one and a half millennia,
with some specific literary works surviving in rich manuscript traditions, extending from the 9th century to the present.
The Kannada language is usually divided into three linguistic phases: Old (450–1200 CE), Middle (1200–1700 CE) and Modern (1700–present);
and its literary characteristics are categorised as Jain, Lingayatism and Vaishnava—recognising the prominence of these three faiths in giving form to, and fostering, classical expression of the language, until the advent of the modern era.
Although much of the literature prior to the 18th century was religious, some secular works were also committed to writing.

Starting with the &quot;Kavirajamarga&quot; (), and until the middle of the 12th century, literature in Kannada was almost exclusively composed by the Jains, who found eager patrons in the Chalukya, Ganga, Rashtrakuta, Hoysala and the Yadava kings.
Although the &quot;Kavirajamarga&quot;, authored during the reign of King Amoghavarsha, is the oldest extant literary work in the language, it has been generally accepted by modern scholars that prose, verse and grammatical traditions must have existed earlier.

The Lingayatism movement of the 12th century created new literature which flourished alongside the Jain works. With the waning of Jain influence during the 14th-century Vijayanagara empire, a new Vaishnava literature grew rapidly in the 15th century; the devotional movement of the itinerant Haridasa saints marked the high point of this era.

After the decline of the Vijayanagara empire in the 16th century, Kannada literature was supported by the various rulers, including the Wodeyars of the Kingdom of Mysore and the Nayakas of Keladi. In the 19th century, some literary forms, such as the prose narrative, the novel, and the short story, were borrowed from English literature. Modern Kannada literature is now widely known and recognised: during the last half century, Kannada language authors have received eight Jnanpith awards, 63 Sahitya Akademi awards and 9 Sahitya Akademi Fellowships in India.
==Content and genre==


In the early period and beginning of the medieval period, between the 9th and 13th centuries, writers were predominantly Jains and Lingayats. Jains were the earliest known cultivators of Kannada literature, which they dominated until the 12th century, although a few works by Lingayats from that period have survived. Jain authors wrote about Tirthankaras and other aspects of religion. The Veerashaiva authors wrote about Shiva, his 25 forms, and the expositions of Shaivism. Lingayat poets belonging to the vachana sahitya tradition advanced the philosophy of Basava from the 12th century.

During the period between the 13th and 15th centuries, there was decline in Jain writings and an increase in the number of works from the Lingayat tradition; there were also contributions from Vaishnava writers. Thereafter, Lingayat and Vaishnava writers dominated Kannada literature. Vaishnava writers focused on the Hindu epics – the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Bhagavata – as well as Vedanta and other subjects from the Puranic traditions. The devotional songs of the Haridasa poets, performed to music, were first noted in the 15th century. Writings on secular subjects remained popular throughout this period.

An important change during the Bhakti &quot;devotion&quot; period starting in the 12th century was the decline of court literature and the rise in popularity of shorter genres such as the &quot;vachana&quot; and &quot;kirthane&quot;, forms that were more accessible to the common man. Writings eulogising kings, commanders and spiritual heroes waned, with a proportional increase in the use of local genres. Kannada literature moved closer to the spoken and sung folk traditions, with musicality being its hallmark, although some poets continued to use the ancient &quot;champu&quot; form of writing as late as the 17th century.

The &quot;champu&quot; Sanskritic metre (poems in verses of various metres interspersed with paragraphs of prose, also known as &quot;champu-kavya&quot;) was the most popular written form from the 9th century onwards, although it started to fall into disuse in the 12th century. Other Sanskritic metres used were the &quot;saptapadi&quot; (seven line verse), the &quot;ashtaka&quot; (eight line verse) and the &quot;shataka&quot; (hundred-line verse). There were numerous translations and adaptations of Sanskrit writings into Kannada and, to a lesser extent, from Kannada into Sanskrit. The medieval period saw the development of literary metres indigenous to the Kannada language. These included the &quot;tripadi&quot; (three-line verse, in use from the 7th century), one of the oldest native metres; the &quot;shatpadi&quot; (six-line verse, first mentioned by Nagavarma I in &quot;Chhandombudhi&quot; of c. 984 and in use from 1165), of which six types exist; the &quot;ragale&quot; (lyrical narrative compositions, in use from 1160); the &quot;sangatya&quot; (compositions meant to be sung with a musical instrument, in use from 1232) and the &quot;akkara&quot; which came to be adopted in some Telugu writings. There were rare interactions with Tamil literature, as well.

Though religious literature was prominent, literary genres including romance, fiction, erotica, satire, folk songs, fables and parables, musical treatises and musical compositions were popular. The topics of Kannada literature included grammar, philosophy, prosody, rhetoric, chronicles, biography, history, drama and cuisine, as well as dictionaries and encyclopedias. According to critic Joseph T. Shipley, over fifty works on scientific subjects including medicine, mathematics and astrology have been written in the Kannada language.

Kannada literature of this period was mainly written on palm leaves. However, more than 30,000 more durable inscriptions on stone (known as &quot;shilashasana&quot;) and copper plates (known as &quot;tamrashasana&quot;) have survived to inform modern students of the historical development of Kannada literature. The Shravanabelagola inscription of Nandisena (7th century), Kappe Arabhatta inscription (c. 700), and the Hummacha and Soraba inscriptions (c. 800) are good examples of poetry in &quot;tripadi&quot; metre, and the Jura (Jabalpur) inscription of King Krishna III (964) is regarded as an epigraphical landmark of classical Kannada composition, containing poetic diction in &quot;kanda&quot; metre, a form consisting of a group of stanzas or chapters.

Elegiac poetry on hundreds of &quot;veeragallu&quot; and &quot;maastigallu&quot; (hero stones) written by unknown poets in the &quot;kanda&quot; and the &quot;vritta&quot; (commentary) metre mourn the death of heroes who sacrificed their lives and the bravery of women who performed &quot;sati&quot;. According to the scholar T. V. Venkatachala Sastry, the book &quot;Karnataka Kavicharitre&quot; compiled by Kannada scholar R. Narasimhachar lists over one thousand anonymous pieces of Kannada literature that cover an array of topics under religious and secular categories. Some fifty &quot;Vachana&quot; poets are known only by the pen names (&quot;ankita&quot;) used in their poems. Most Jain writings included in the list are from the period 1200–1450 CE, while Lingayat and Vaishnava writings are from later periods. Secular topics include mathematics, medicine, science of horses and elephants, architecture, geography and hydrology.

The pace of change towards more modern literary styles gained momentum in the early 19th century. Kannada writers were initially influenced by the modern literature of other languages, especially English. Modern English education and liberal democratic values inspired social changes, intertwined with the desire to retain the best of traditional ways. New genres including short stories, novels, literary criticism, and essays, were embraced as Kannada prose moved toward modernisation.

==Classical period==
===Rashtrakuta court===
The reign of the imperial Rashtrakutas and their powerful feudatory, the Gangas, marks the beginning of the classical period of writings in the Kannada language under royal patronage, and the end of the age of Sanskrit epics.

There was an emphasis on the adoption of Sanskritic models while retaining elements of &quot;deshi&quot; literary traditions, a style that prevailed in Kannada literature throughout the classical period. &quot;Kavirajamarga&quot;, written during this period, is a treatise on the Kannada speaking people, their poetry and their language. A portion of the writing qualifies as a practical grammar. It describes defective and corrective examples (the &quot;do&#x27;s and don&#x27;t&#x27;s&quot;) of versification and native composition styles recognised by earlier poets (&quot;puratana kavis&quot;). These composition meters are the &quot;bedande&quot;, the &quot;chattana&quot; and the &quot;gadyakatha&quot; – compositions written in various interspersed metres. In some contexts, the term &quot;puravcharyar&quot;, which may refer to previous grammarians or rhetoricians, have also been mentioned. Some historians attribute &quot;Kavirajamarga&quot; to the Rashtrakuta king Amoghavarsha I, but others believe that the book may have been inspired by the king and co-authored or authored in full by Srivijaya, a Kannada language theorist and court poet.

The earliest existing prose piece in old Kannada is &quot;Vaddaradhane&quot; (&quot;Worship of Elders&quot;, 9th century) by Shivakotiacharya. It contains 19 lengthy stories, some in the form of fables and parables, such as &quot;The Sage and the Monkey&quot;. Inspired by the earlier Sanskrit writing &quot;Brihatkatha Kosha&quot;, it is about Jain tenets and describes issues of rebirth, karma, the plight of humans on earth, and social issues of the time such as education, trade and commerce, magic, superstition, and the condition of women in society.

The works of Jain writers Adikavi Pampa, Sri Ponna and Ranna, collectively called the &quot;three gems of Kannada literature&quot;, heralded the age of classical Kannada in the 10th century. Pampa, who wrote &quot;Adipurana&quot; in 941, is regarded as one of the greatest Kannada writers. Written in &quot;champu&quot; style, &quot;Adipurana&quot; narrates the life history of the first Jain Thirtankar, Rishabhadeva. In this spiritual saga, Rishabhadeva&#x27;s soul moves through a series of births before attaining emancipation in a quest for the liberation of his soul from the cycle of life and death. Pampa&#x27;s other classic, &quot;Vikramarjuna Vijaya&quot; (or &quot;Pampa Bharata&quot;, 941), is loosely based on the Hindu epic the Mahabharata.

Sri Ponna, patronised by King Krishna III, wrote &quot;Santipurana&quot; (950), a biography of the 16th Jain Tirthankar Shantinatha. He earned the title &quot;Ubhaya Kavichakravathi&quot; (&quot;supreme poet in two languages&quot;) for his command of both Kannada and Sanskrit. Although Sri Ponna borrowed significantly from Kalidasa&#x27;s earlier works, his &quot;Santipurana&quot; is considered an important Jain purana.

===Chalukya court===
From the late 10th century, Kannada literature made considerable progress under the patronage of the new overlords of the Deccan, the Western Chalukyas and their feudatories: the Hoysalas, the southern Kalachuris of Kalyanis, the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri and Silharas of Karad. The skill of Kannada poets was appreciated in distant lands. King Bhoja of Malwa in central India presented Nagavarma I, a writer of prosody and romance classics, with horses as a mark of his admiration.

Ranna was the court poet of the Western Chalukya kings Tailapa II and Satyashraya. He was also patronised by Attimabbe, a devout Jain woman. Ranna&#x27;s poetic writings reached their zenith with &quot;Sahasa Bhima Vijaya&quot; (&quot;Victory of the bold Bhima&quot;, also called &quot;Gada Yudda&quot; or &quot;Battle of Clubs&quot;, 982), which describes the conflict between Bhima and Duryodhana in his version of the Mahabharata epic, one of the earliest poetic elegies in the Kannada language. Unlike Pampa, who glorified Arjuna and Karna in his writing, Ranna eulogised his patron King Satyashraya and favourably compared him to Bhima, whom he crowned at the end of the Mahabharata war. His other well-known writing is the &quot;Ajitha purana&quot; (993), which recounts the life of the second Jain Tirthankar Ajitanatha. Ranna was bestowed the title &quot;Kavi Chakravathi&quot; (&quot;Emperor among poets&quot;) by his patron king.

Among grammarians, Nagavarma-II, &quot;Katakacharya&quot; (poet laureate) of the Chalukya king Jagadhekamalla II made significant contributions with his works in grammar, poetry, prosody, and vocabulary; these are standard authorities and their importance to the study of Kannada language is well acknowledged. Among his other writings, the &quot;Kavyavalokana&quot; on grammar and rhetoric and the &quot;Karnataka Bhashabhushana&quot; (1145) on grammar are historically significant. However, the discovery of &quot;Vardhamana Puranam&quot; (1042), which has been ascribed by some scholars to Nagavarma II, has created uncertainty about his actual lifetime since it suggests that he may have lived a century earlier and been patronised by Jayasimha II.

==Hoysala period==

In the late 12th century, the Hoysalas, a powerful hill tribe from the Malnad region in modern southern Karnataka, exploited the political uncertainty in the Deccan to gain dominance in the region south of the Krishna River in southern India. A new chronological era was adopted, imperial titles were claimed and Kannada literature flourished with such noted scholars as Janna, Harihara, Rudrabhatta, Raghavanka, Keshiraja and others. An important achievement during this period was the establishment of native metres in literature (the &quot;ragale&quot;, the &quot;tripadi&quot;, the &quot;sangatya&quot; and the &quot;shatpadi&quot;).

Two renowned philosophers who lived during this time, Ramanujacharya and Madhvacharya, influenced the culture of the region. The conversion of the Hoysala King Vishnuvardhana in the early 12th century from Jainism to Vaishnavism was to later prove a setback to Jain literature. In the decades to follow, Jain writers faced competition from the Veerashaivas, to which they responded with rebuttals, and from the 15th century, from the writers of the Vaishnava cadre. These events changed the literary landscape of the Kannada-speaking region forever.

One of the earliest Veerashaiva writers who was not part of the &quot;Vachana&quot; literary tradition, poet Harihara (or Harisvara) came from a family of &quot;karnikas&quot; (accountants), and worked under the patronage of King Narasimha I. He wrote &quot;Girijakalyana&quot; in ten sections following the Kalidasa tradition, employing the old Jain &quot;champu&quot; style, with the story leading to the marriage of Shiva and Parvati. In a deviation from the norm, Harihara avoided glorifying saintly mortals. He is credited with more than 100 poems in &quot;ragale&quot; metre, called the &quot;Nambiyanana ragale&quot; (or &quot;Shivaganada ragale&quot;, 1160) praising the saint Nambiyana and Virupaksha (a form of Hindu god Shiva). For his poetic talent, he has earned the honorific &quot;utsava kavi&quot; (&quot;poet of exuberance&quot;).

Harihara&#x27;s nephew, Raghavanka, was the first to introduce the &quot;shatpadi&quot; metre into Kannada literature in his epic &quot;Harishchandra Kavya&quot; (1200), considered a classic despite occasionally violating strict rules of Kannada grammar. Drawing on his skill as a dramatist, Raghavanka&#x27;s story of King Harishchandra vividly describes the clash of personalities between sage Vishvamitra and sage Vashisht and between Harishchandra and Vishvamitra. It is believed that this interpretation of the story of Harishchandra is unique to Indian literature. The writing is an original and does not follow any established epic traditions. In addition to Hoysala patronage, Raghavanka was honoured by Kakatiya king Prataparudra I.

Rudrabhatta, a Smartha Brahmin (believer of monistic philosophy), was the earliest well-known Brahminical writer, under the patronage of Chandramouli, a minister of King Veera Ballala II. Based on the earlier work of &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;, he wrote &quot;Jagannatha Vijaya&quot; (1180) in the &quot;champu&quot; style, relating the life of Lord Krishna leading up to his fight with the demon Banasura.

In 1209, the Jain scholar and army commander Janna wrote &quot;Yashodhara Charite&quot;, a unique set of stories dealing with perversion. In one of the stories, a king intended to perform a ritual sacrifice of two young boys to Mariamma, a local deity. After hearing the boys&#x27; tale, the king is moved to release them and renounce the practice of human sacrifice. In honour of this work, Janna received the title &quot;Kavichakravarthi&quot; (&quot;Emperor among poets&quot;) from King Veera Ballala II. His other classic, &quot;Anathanatha Purana&quot; (1230), deals with the life of the 14th Tirthankar Ananthanatha.

==Vijayanagara period==
The 14th century saw major upheavals in geo-politics of southern India with Muslim empires invading from the north. The Vijayanagara Empire stood as a bulwark against these invasions and created an atmosphere conducive to the development of the fine arts.
In a golden age of Kannada literature, competition between Vaishnava and Veerashaiva writers was fierce and literary disputations between the two sects were common, especially in the court of King Deva Raya II. Acute rivalry led to &quot;organised processions&quot; in honour of the classics written by poets of the respective sects. The king himself was no less a writer, the romantic stories &quot;Sobagina Sone&quot; (&quot;lit&quot; &quot;The Drizzle of Beauty&quot;) and &quot;Amaruka&quot; are assigned to him.

To this period belonged Kumara Vyasa (the pen name of Naranappa), a doyen of medieval epic poets and one of the most influential Vaishnava poets of the time. He was particularly known for his sophisticated use of metaphors and had even earned the title &quot;Rupaka Samrajya Chakravarti&quot; (&quot;Emperor of the land of Metaphors&quot;). In 1430, he wrote the &quot;Gadugina Bharata&quot;, popularly known as &quot;Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari&quot; or &quot;Kumaravyasa Bharata&quot; in the Vyasa tradition. The work is a translation of the first ten chapters of the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and emphasises the divinity and grace of the Lord Krishna, portraying all characters with the exception of Krishna to suffer from human foibles. An interesting aspect of the work is the sense of humour exhibited by the poet and his hero, Krishna. This work marked a transition of Kannada literature to a more modern genre and heralded a new age combining poetic perfection with religious inspiration. The remaining &quot;parvas&quot; (chapters) of &quot;Mahabharata&quot; were translated by Timmanna Kavi (1510) in the court of King Krishnadevaraya. The poet named his work &quot;Krishnaraya Bharata&quot; after his patron king.

Kumara Valmiki (1500) wrote the first complete brahminical adaptation of the epic Ramayana, called &quot;Torave Ramayana&quot;. According to the author, the epic he wrote merely narrated God Shiva&#x27;s conversation with his consort Parvati. This writing has remained popular for centuries and inspired folk theatre such as the &quot;Yakshagana&quot;, which has made use of its verses as a script for enacting episodes from the great epic. In Valmiki&#x27;s version of the epic, King Ravana is depicted as one of the suitors at Sita&#x27;s &quot;Swayamvara&quot; (&quot;lit.&quot; a ceremony of &quot;choice of a husband&quot;). His failure to win the bride&#x27;s hand results in jealousy towards Rama, the eventual bridegroom. As the story progresses, Hanuman, for all his services to Rama, is exalted to the status of &quot;the next creator&quot;. Towards the end of the story, during the war with Rama, Ravana realises that his adversary is none other than the God Vishnu and hastens to die at his hands to achieve salvation.

Chamarasa, a Veerashaiva poet, was a rival of Kumara Vyasa in the court of Devaraya II. His eulogy of the saint Allama Prabhu, titled &quot;Prabhulinga Lile&quot; (1430), was later translated into Telugu and Tamil at the behest of his patron king. In the story, the saint was considered an incarnation of Hindu God Ganapathi while Parvati took the form of a princess of Banavasi.

Interaction between Kannada and Telugu literatures, a trend which had begun in the Hoysala period, increased. Translations of classics from Kannada to Telugu and vice versa became popular. Well-known bilingual poets of this period were Bhima Kavi, Piduparti Somanatha and Nilakanthacharya. In fact, so well versed in Kannada were some Telugu poets, including Dhurjati, that they freely used many Kannada terms in their Telugu writings. It was because of this &quot;familiarity&quot; with Kannada, that the notable writer Srinatha even called his Telugu, &quot;Kannada&quot;. This process of interaction between the two languages continued into the 19th century in the form of translations by bilingual writers.

==Mystic literature==
===Veerashaiva===

In the late 12th century, the Kalachuris successfully rebelled against their overlords, the Western Chalukyas, and annexed the capital Kalyani. During this turbulent period, a new religious faith called Veerashaivism (or Lingayatism) developed as a revolt against the existing social order of Hindu society. Some of the followers of this faith wrote literature called &quot;Vachana Sahitya&quot; (&quot;Vachana literature&quot;) or &quot;Sharana Sahitya&quot; (&quot;literature of the devotees&quot;) consisting of a unique and native form of poetry in free verse called &quot;Vachana&quot;. Basavanna (or Basava, 1134–1196), the prime minister of Kalachuri King Bijjala II, is generally regarded as the inspiration for this movement. Devotees gathered to discuss their mystic experiences at a centre for religious discussion called Anubhava Mantapa (&quot;hall of experience&quot;) in Kalyani. Here, they expressed their devotion to God Shiva in simple &quot;vachana&quot; poems. These poems were spontaneous utterances of rhythmic, epigrammatical, satirical prose emphasising the worthlessness of riches, rituals and book learning, displaying a dramatic quality reminiscent of the dialogues of Plato.

Basavanna, Allama Prabhu, Devara Dasimayya, Channabasava, Siddharama (1150), and Kondaguli Kesiraja are the best known among numerous poets (called &quot;Vachanakaras&quot;) who wrote in this genre. Akka Mahadevi was prominent among the several women poets; in addition to her poetry, she is credited with two short writings, &quot;Mantrogopya&quot; and &quot;Yogangatrividhi&quot;. Siddharama is credited with writings in &quot;tripadi&quot; metre and 1,379 extant poems (though he has claimed authorship of 68,000 poems).

The Veerashaiva movement experienced a setback with the assassination of King Bijjala and eviction of the &quot;sharanas&quot; (devotees) from Kalyani; further growth of &quot;Vachana&quot; poetry was curtailed until the 15th century when another wave of writings began under the patronage of the rulers of Vijayanagara. Chieftain Nijaguna Shivayogi originated a new philosophy called &quot;Kaivalya&quot;, founded on the advaitha (monistic) philosophy of Adi Shankara, synthesised with an offshoot of the Veerashaiva faith. A prolific writer, Shivayogi composed devotional songs collectively known as the &quot;Kaivalya sahitya&quot; (or &quot;Tattva Padagalu&quot;, literally &quot;songs of the pathway to emancipation&quot;). His songs were reflective, philosophical and concerned with Yoga. Shivayogi also wrote a highly respected scientific encyclopaedia called the &quot;Vivekachintamani&quot;; it was translated into Marathi language in 1604 and Sanskrit language in 1652 and again in the 18th century. The encyclopaedia includes entries on 1,500 topics and covers a wide range of subjects including poetics, dance and drama, musicology and erotics.

Other well-known poet saints of the Veerashaiva tradition include Muppina Sadakshari, a contemporary of Shivayogi, whose collection of songs are called the &quot;Subodhasara&quot;, Chidananda Avadhuta of the 17th century and Sarpabhushana Shivayogi of the 18th century. So vast is this body of literature that much of it still needs to be studied.

===Vaishnava===
The Vaishnava Bhakti (devotional) movement involving well-known Haridasas (devotee saints) of that time made an indelible imprint on Kannada literature starting in the 15th century, inspiring a body of work called &quot;Haridasa Sahitya&quot; (&quot;Haridasa literature&quot;). Influenced by the Veerashaivism of the 12th century, this movement touched the lives of millions with its strong current of devotion. The Haridasas conveyed the message of Vedantic philosopher Madhvacharya to the common man through simple Kannada language in the form of &quot;devaranamas&quot; and &quot;kirthanas&quot; (devotional songs in praise of god). The philosophy of Madhvacharya was spread by eminent disciples including Naraharitirtha, Jayatirtha, Vyasatirtha, Sripadaraya, Vadirajatirtha, Purandara Dasa, and Kanaka Dasa. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, a prominent saint from distant Bengal, visited the region in 1510, further stimulating the devotional movement.

Purandara Dasa (1484–1564), a wandering bard, is believed to have composed 475,000 songs in the Kannada and Sanskrit languages, though only about 1,000 songs are known today. Composed in various &quot;ragas&quot;, and often ending with a salutation to the Hindu deity Vittala, his compositions presented the essence of the &quot;Upanishads&quot; and the &quot;Puranas&quot; in simple yet expressive language. He also devised a system by which the common man could learn Carnatic music, and codified the musical composition forms &quot;svaravalis&quot;, &quot;alankaras&quot; (&quot;figure of speech&quot;) and &quot;geethams&quot;. Owing to such contributions, Purandara Dasa earned the honorific &quot;Karnataka Sangeeta Pitamaha&quot; (&quot;Father of Carnatic Music&quot;).

Kanaka Dasa (whose birth name was Thimmappa Nayaka, 1509–1609) of Kaginele (in modern Haveri district) was an ascetic and spiritual seeker who authored important writings such as &quot;Mohanatarangini&quot; (&quot;River of Delight&quot;), the story of the Hindu god Krishna in &quot;sangatya&quot; metre; &quot;Nrisimhastava&quot;, a work dealing with glory of god Narasimha; &quot;Nalacharita&quot;, the story of Nala, noted for its narration; and &quot;Hari Bhaktisara&quot;, a spontaneous writing on devotion in &quot;shatpadi&quot; metre. The latter writing, which deals with &quot;niti&quot; (morals), &quot;bhakti&quot; (devotion) and &quot;vairagya&quot; (renunciation) has become popular as a standard book of learning for children. Kanaka Dasa authored a unique allegorical poem titled &quot;Ramadhanya Charitre&quot; (&quot;Story of Rama&#x27;s Chosen Grain&quot;), which exalts ragi over rice. Apart from these classics, about 240 songs written by the Kanaka Dasa are available today.

The Haridasa movement returned to prominence from the 17th through 19th centuries, producing as many as 300 poets in this genre; well known among them are Vijaya Dasa (1682–1755), Gopala Dasa (1721–1769), Jagannatha Dasa (1728–1809), Mahipathi Dasa (1750), Helavanakatte Giriamma and others. Over time, the movement&#x27;s devotional songs inspired a form of religious and didactic performing art of the Vaishnava people called the Harikatha (&quot;Stories of Hari&quot;). Similar developments were seen among the followers of the Veerashaiva faith who popularised the &quot;Shivakatha&quot; (&quot;Stories of Shiva&quot;).

==Mysore and Keladi period==
With the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire, the Kingdom of Mysore (ಮೈಸೂರು ಸಾಮ್ರಾಜ್ಯ) (1565–1947) and the kingdom of the Keladi Nayakas (1565–1763) rose to power in the southern and western regions of modern Karnataka respectively. Production of literary texts covering various themes flourished in these courts. The Mysore court was adorned by eminent writers who authored encyclopaedias, epics, and religious commentaries, and composers and musicians. The Keladi court is better known for writings on Veerashaiva doctrine. The Mysore kings themselves were accomplished in the fine arts and made important contributions. A unique and native form of poetic literature with dramatic representation called &quot;Yakshagana&quot; gained popularity in the 18th century.

&quot;Geetha Gopala&quot;, a well-known treatise on music, is ascribed to King Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar (1673–1704), the earliest composer of the dynasty, who went by the honorific &quot;Sahitya Vidyanikasha Prastharam&quot; (&quot;Expert in literature&quot;). Inspired by Jayadeva&#x27;s &quot;Geetha Govinda&quot; in Sanskrit, it was written in &quot;saptapadi&quot; metre. This is the first writing to propagate the Vaishnava faith in the Kannada language.

Also writing in this period was Sarvajna (&quot;lit.&quot; &quot;The all knowing&quot;)—a mendicant and drifter Veerashaiva poet who left a deep imprint on Kannada speaking region and its people. His didactic &quot;Vachanas&quot;, penned in the &quot;tripadi&quot; metre, constitute some of Kannada&#x27;s most celebrated works. With the exception of some early poems, his works focus on his spiritual quest as a drifter. The pithy &quot;Vachanas&quot; contain his observations on the art of living, the purpose of life and the ways of the world. He was not patronised by royalty, nor did he write for fame; his main aim was to instruct people about morality.

The writing of Brahmin author Lakshmisa (or Lakshmisha), a well-known story-teller and a dramatist, is dated to the mid-16th or late 17th century. The &quot;Jaimini Bharata&quot;, his version of the epic Mahabharata written in &quot;shatpadi&quot; metre, is one of the most popular poems of the late medieval period. A collection of stories, the poem includes the tale of the &quot;Sita Parityaga&quot; (&quot;Repudiation of Sita&quot;). The author successfully converted a religious story into a very human tale; it remains popular even in modern times.

The period also saw advances in dramatic works. Though there is evidence that theatre was known from the 12th century or earlier, modern Kannada theatre is traced to the rise of &quot;Yakshagana&quot; (a type of field play), which appeared in the 16th century. The golden age of &quot;Yakshagana&quot; compositions was tied to the rule of King Kanteerava Narasaraja Wodeyar II (1704–1714). A polyglot, he authored 14 &quot;Yakshaganas&quot; in various languages, although all are written in the Kannada script. He is credited with the earliest &quot;Yakshaganas&quot; that included &quot;sangeeta&quot; (music), &quot;nataka&quot; (drama) and &quot;natya&quot; (dance).

Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar (1794–1868), the ruler of the princely state of Mysore, was another prolific writer of the era. More than 40 writings are attributed to him, including a poetic romance called &quot;Saugandika Parinaya&quot; written in two versions, &quot;sangatya&quot; and a drama. His reign signalled the shift from classical genres to modern literature which was to be complemented by the influence of colonial period of India.

==Modern period==
The development of modern Kannada literature can be traced to the early 19th century when Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar III and his court poets moved away from the ancient &quot;champu&quot; form of prose toward prose renderings of Sanskrit epics and plays. Kempu Narayana&#x27;s &quot;Mudramanjusha&quot; (&quot;Seal Casket&quot;, 1823) is the first modern novel written in Kannada.

Modern Kannada literature was cross-fertilized by the colonial period in India as well., with translations of Kannada works and dictionaries into European languages as well as other Indian languages, and vice versa, and the establishment of European style newspapers and periodicals in Kannada. In addition, in the 19th century, interaction with European technology, including new printing techniques accelerated the development of modern literature.

The first Kannada newspaper called &quot;Mangalore Samachara&quot; was published by Hermann Mögling in 1843; and the first Kannada periodical, &quot;Mysuru Vrittanta Bodhini&quot; was published by Bhashyam Bhashyacharya in Mysore around the same time. Hermann Mögling translated Kannada classics into a series called &quot;Bibliotheca Carnataca&quot; during 1848–1853., while British officers Benjamin L. Rice and J. H. Fleet edited and published critical editions of literary classics, contemporary folk ballads and inscriptions. Following the rich tradition of dictionaries in Kannada since the 11th century, the first dictionaries expressing meanings of Kannada words in European languages were published in the 19th century, the most prominent of them being Ferdinand Kittel&#x27;s Kannada-English dictionary in 1894.

There was a push towards original works in prose narratives and a standardisation of prose during the late 19th century. Translations of works from English, Sanskrit and other Indian languages like Marathi and Bengali continued and accelerated. Lakshman Gadagkar&#x27;s &quot;Suryakantha&quot; (1892) and Gulvadi Venkata Rao&#x27;s &quot;Indira Bai&quot; (1899) signalled the move away from the highly stylised mores and aesthetics of prior Kannada works to modern prose, establishing the modern novel genre and fundamentally influencing the essay, literary criticism and drama genres.

===Navodaya – A period of modern literature===

At the dawn of the 20th century, B. M. Srikantaiah (&#x27;B. M. Sri&#x27;), regarded as the &quot;Father of modern Kannada literature&quot;, called for a new era of writing original works in modern Kannada while moving away from archaic Kannada forms. This paradigmatic shift spawned an age of prolificacy in Kannada literature and came to be dubbed the &quot;Navodaya&quot; (&quot;lit&quot;. &#x27;A new rise&#x27;) period—a period of awakening. B. M. Sri led the way with his &quot;English Geethagalu&quot; (&quot;English Songs&quot;)—a collection of poems translated from English set the tone for more translations using a standardisation of a modern written idiom. Original and seminal works which drew greatly from native and folk traditions also emerged alongside the translations. Stalwarts like S. G. Narasimhachar, Panje Mangesha Rao and Hattiangadi Narayana Rao also contributed with celebrated efforts. Literary subjects now veered from discussing kings and gods to more humanistic and secular pursuits. Kannada writers experimented with several forms of western literature, the novel and the short story in particular. The novel found an early champion in Shivaram Karanth while another prominent writer, Masti Venkatesh Iyengar (&#x27;Masti&#x27;), laid the foundation for generations of story tellers to follow with his &quot;Kelavu Sanna Kathegalu&quot; (&quot;A few Short Stories&quot;, 1920) and &quot;Sanna Kathegalu&quot; (&quot;Short Stories&quot;, 1924).

The consolidation of modern drama was pioneered by T. P. Kailasam, with his &quot;Tollu Gatti&quot; (&quot;The Hollow and the Solid&quot;, 1918). Kailasam followed this with &quot;Tali Kattoke Cooline&quot; (&quot;Wages for tying the Mangalsutra&quot;), a critique on the dowry system in marriage. His plays mainly focused on problems affecting middle class Brahmin families: the dowry system, religious persecution, woes in the extended family system and exploitation of women. Novels of the early 20th century promoted a nationalist consciousness in keeping with the political developments of the time. While Venkatachar and Galaganath translated Bankim Chandra and Harinarayana Apte respectively, Gulvadi Venkata Rao, Kerur Vasudevachar and M. S. Puttanna initiated the movement toward realistic novels with their works. Aluru Venkatarao&#x27;s &quot;Karnataka Gatha Vaibhava&quot; had a profound influence on the movement for Karnataka&#x27;s unification.

;1925–50 – The Golden harvest

While the first quarter of the 20th century was a period of experiment and innovation, the succeeding quarter was one of creative achievement. This period saw the rise of acclaimed lyricists whose works combined native folk songs and the mystic poetry of the medieval &quot;vachanas&quot; and &quot;kirthanas&quot; with influences from modern English romantics. D. R. Bendre, with his collection of 27 poems including such masterpieces as &quot;Gari&quot; (&quot;Wing&quot;, 1932), &quot;Nadaleele&quot; (1938) and &quot;Sakhigeetha&quot; (1940), was perhaps the most outstanding Kannada lyricist of the period. His poems covered a wide range of themes including patriotism, love of nature, conjugal love, transcendental experiences and sympathy for the poor. Govinda Pai narrated the story of Christ&#x27;s crucifixion in his work &quot;Golgotha&quot; (1931). The success of this work encouraged Pai to follow with three panegyrics in 1947; &quot;Vaishakhi&quot;, &quot;Prabhasa&quot; and &quot;Dehali&quot;, narrated the last days of the Buddha, God Krishna and Gandhi respectively. His &quot;Hebberalu&quot; (&quot;Thumb&quot;, 1946) dramatises the story of Drona and Ekalavya, characters from the epic Mahabharata.

K.V. Puttappa (&#x27;Kuvempu&#x27;), who would subsequently become Kannada&#x27;s first Jnanpith awardee, demonstrated great talent in writing blank verse with his &quot;magnum opus&quot; &quot;Sri Ramayana Darshanam&quot; (1949). This work marks the beginning of modern Kannada epic poetry. The work, through the use of metaphors and similes, focuses on the concept that all living creatures will eventually evolve into perfect beings. Other important works of the period are Masti&#x27;s &quot;Navaratri&quot; and P. T. Narasimhachar&#x27;s &quot;Hanathe&quot;. D. V. Gundappa&#x27;s &quot;Mankuthimmana Kagga&quot; (&quot;Dull Thimma&#x27;s Rigmarole&quot;, 1943) harkened back to the wisdom poems of the late medieval poet Sarvajna. A celebrated writer of conjugal love poems, K. S. Narasimhaswamy won critical acclaim for &quot;Mysore Mallige&quot; (&quot;Mysore Jasmine&quot;, 1942), a description of the bliss of everyday marital life.

Growth in poetic drama was inspired by B.M. Sri&#x27;s &quot;Gadayuddha Natakam&quot; (1925), an adaptation of Ranna&#x27;s medieval epic. While Kuvempu and B.M. Sri were inspired by old Kannada, Masti and later P. T. Narasimhachar (&#x27;Pu. Ti. Na&#x27;) explored modern sensibilities in their &quot;Yashodhara&quot; (1938) and &quot;Ahalye&quot; (1940). The 1930s saw the emergence of Sriranga, who joined forces with Samsa and Kailasam to pen some of the most successful plays in Kannada. Samsa completed his trilogy about Ranadhira Kantirava, a Mysore king of yore, with his &quot;Vijayanarasimha&quot; (1936) and &quot;Mantrashakti&quot; (1938). Kailasam&#x27;s mastery over wit and stage rhetoric come to the fore in his &quot;Home Rule&quot; (1930) and &quot;Vaidyana Vyadi&quot; (&quot;A Doctors Ailment&quot;, 1940) while he explores his serious side in &quot;Bhahishkara&quot; (1929); with &quot;Soole&quot; (&quot;Prostitute&quot;, 1945), he unleashed his contempt for outdated quasi-religious mores. Societal ills were also examined in Bendre&#x27;s &quot;Nageya Hoge&quot; (&quot;Fumes of Laughter&quot;, 1936), and in Karanth&#x27;s &quot;Garbhagudi&quot; (&quot;Sanctum&quot;, 1932), which decried the exploitation of society in the name of religion.

The novel came of age during this period, with Karanth (&quot;Chomana Dudi&quot;, 1933), Masti (&quot;Subbanna&quot;, 1928) and Kuvempu (&quot;Subbamma Heggadathi of Kanur&quot;, 1936) leading the charge. Significantly, writers chose to carry on from where Puttanna, Gulvadi and Kerur had left off around the start of the 20th century rather than continue with popular translations in the style of Venkatachar and Galaganath. Aesthetic concerns replaced the didactic and a sense of form developed. Devudu Narasimha Shastri distinguished himself with his &quot;Antaranga&quot; (1931) and &quot; Mayura&quot; (1928); the former was a much acclaimed work which delved into the psychology of the protagonist, while the latter was a historical novel tracing the emergence of the Kadamba dynasty. Another high point of this period is Karanth&#x27;s &quot;Marali Mannige&quot; (1942), the saga of three generations of a family, reflecting the social, cultural and economic developments of over a hundred years.

Literary criticism, which had its beginnings in the first quarter-century, also made significant progress. B.M. Sri&#x27;s &quot;Kannada Sahitya Charitre&quot; (1947), Gundappa&#x27;s &quot;Sahitya Shakti&quot; (1950), Masti&#x27;s &quot;Adikavi Valmiki&quot; (1935), Bendre&#x27;s &quot;Sahitya Hagu Vimarshe&quot; (&quot;Literature and Criticism&quot;, 1932) and Krishna Shastry&#x27;s &quot;Samskrita Nataka&quot; (1937) are particularly notable. The essay, another form adopted from western literature, was richly served by A N Murthy Rao (&quot;Hagaluganasugalu&quot;, 1937), Gorur Ramaswamy Iyengar&#x27;s (&#x27;Gorur&#x27;) humorous &quot;Halliya Chitragalu&quot; (1930) and Karanth&#x27;s &quot;Hucchu manassina Hattu mukhagalu&quot; (1948).

===Late Navodaya and the rise of the progressives===
As the &quot;Navodaya&quot; period waxed, the &quot;Pragatishila&quot; (progressives) movement led by novelist A. N. Krishna Rao (&#x27;Anakru&#x27;) gained momentum in the early 1940s. This left-leaning school contended that literature must be an instrument of social revolution and considered the &quot;Navodaya&quot; to be the product of aesthetes, too puritanical to be of any social relevance. This movement drew both established and young writers into its fold and, while it produced no poetry or drama of special merit, its contributions to short story and novel forms were appreciable. &quot;Pragatishila&quot; was credited with broadening readers&#x27; horizons; works produced during this period dealt extensively with subjects of everyday life, rural themes and the common man. The language was less inhibited and made generous use of colloquialism and slang. Anakru himself was a prolific writer of novels but the best works of this school are attributed to T. R. Subba Rao (&#x27;Ta Ra Su&#x27;), Basavaraju Kattimani and Niranjana. T. R. Subba Rao initially wrote short stories, although he later turned his talents to novels, which were popular. His early novels, &quot;Purushavatara&quot; and &quot;Munjavininda Munjavu&quot;, told the stories of the underprivileged, the downtrodden and the outcast. Best known among his novels—some of whose plots are centred on his native Chitradurga—are &quot;Masanada Hoovu&quot; (&quot;Flower from a cemetery&quot;), a story about the plight of prostitutes, and historical novel &quot;Hamsa Gite&quot; (&quot;Swan Song&quot;), a story about a dedicated musician of the late 18th century during annexation of Chitradurga by Tipu sultan.

Marked as its influence had been, the &quot;Pragatishila&quot; wave was already in decline by the close of the 1950s. Legendary writers of the previous era continued to produce notable works in the &quot;Navodaya&quot; style. In poetry, Bendre&#x27;s &quot;Naku Tanti&quot; (&quot;Four Strings&quot;, 1964) and Kuvempu&#x27;s &quot;Aniketana&quot; (1964) stand out. V.K. Gokak brought out the innate insufficiencies of the more advanced western cultures in &quot;Indilla Nale&quot; (1965). &quot;Navodaya&quot;-style novels continued to be successful with such noteworthy works as Karanth&#x27;s &quot;Mookajjiya Kanasugalu&quot; (&quot;Mookajji&#x27;s visions&quot;, 1968), where Karanth explored the origins of man&#x27;s faith in the mother goddess and the stages of evolution of civilisation. Kuvempu&#x27;s &quot;Malegallali Madumagalu&quot; (&quot;The Bride of the Hills&quot;, 1967) is about loving relationships that exist in every level of society.

Masti&#x27;s two classic novels of this era were &quot;Channabasavanayaka&quot; (1950), which describe the defeat of Bidanur&#x27;s chief Channabasava Nayaka (on Karnataka&#x27;s coast) by Haider Ali in the late 18th century, and &quot;Chickavirarajendra&quot; (1950), which describes the fall of the tiny kingdom of Coorg (ruled by Chikka Virarajendra) to the British East India Company. The common theme in both works is the despotism and tyranny of the incumbent native rulers resulting in the intervention of a foreign power appearing on the scene to restore order, but with its own imperialistic intentions.

S. L. Bhyrappa, a charismatic young writer, first came to attention in the 1960s with his first novel &quot;Dharmasri&quot;, although it was his &quot;Vamsavriksha&quot; (&quot;Family Tree&quot;, 1966) that put him in the spotlight as one of Kannada&#x27;s most popular novelists. It is a story of a respected scholar, Srinivasa Srotri, his family and their long-held values. The protagonist&#x27;s young and widowed daughter-in-law wishes to remarry, putting his family tradition at risk. Bhyrappa&#x27;s best novel of the period was &quot;Grihabhanga&quot; (&quot;Breaking of a Home&quot;, 1970), a story of a woman surviving under tragic circumstances. The characters in the story are rustic and often use vulgar language. His other important novel is &quot;Parva&quot;, a major work in Kannada fiction acclaimed as an admirable attempt at recreating life on the sub-continent during the time of the epic Mahabharata.

===Navya===

In the 1950s, even as the &quot;Pragatishila&quot; merged back into the &quot;Navodaya&quot; mainstream, a new modernist school of writing called &quot;Navya&quot; emerged. Though formally inaugurated by V. K. Gokak with his &quot;Navya Kavitegalu&quot; (&quot;Modern Poems&quot;, 1950), it was Gopalakrishna Adiga who best exemplified the ethos of the movement. Poetry and, later, the short story became the most effective vehicles of the movement. With the passing of the Gandhian era and its influences, a new era in which to express modern sensibilities had arrived. The &quot;Navya&quot; writers questioned the time-honoured standards of plot of the &quot;Navodaya&quot;; life was seen not as a pursuit of already existing values, but as an introspective search for them, occasionally narrated in stream of consciousness technique. Events and details were increasingly treated metaphorically and the short story grew closer to poetry. Gopalakrishna Adiga is considered the father of this form of expression with his &quot;Nadedu Banda Dari&quot; (&quot;The Path Traversed&quot;, 1952) where he sought inspiration from T. S. Eliot and W. H. Auden. His other well-known poems include &quot;Gondalapura&quot; (&quot;Pandemonium&quot;, 1954) and &quot;Bhoota&quot; (1959).

G. S. Shivarudrappa made his mark in the Navya period with &quot;Mumbai Jataka&quot; (&quot;A Horoscope of Bombay&quot;, 1966), which takes a closer look at urbanised society in Mumbai. A protégé of Kuvempu, Shivarudrappa&#x27;s fame came the peak of popularity of romantic poems with his &quot;Samagma&quot; (&quot;Songs of Equanimity&quot;, 1951), poems distinguished by an idealistic bent. He continued to write poems in the same vein, although in his later poems there is a gradual shift to social issues with a streak of admiration for god&#x27;s creation. His critical essay, &quot;Anuranana&quot; (1980), is about the Vachana poets of the 12th century, their tradition, style and influence on later poets.

K. S. Narasimhaswamy remained prominent through this era, writing such landmark poems as &quot;Silalate&quot; (&quot;The Sculptured Creeper&quot;, 1958) and &quot;Gadiyaradangadiya Munde&quot; (&quot;Before the Clock Shop&quot;). Chandrashekhara Kambar, Chandrashekar Patil, P. Lankesh, and K. S. Nissar Ahmed are among the best-known later generation Navya poets.

Outstanding playwrights from this period are Girish Karnad, P. Lankesh, Chandrashekhara Kambara and Chandrashekar Patil. Karnad&#x27;s &quot;Tughlaq&quot; (1964) portrays violence caused by idealism gone astray. Considered an important creation in Kannada theatre, the play depicts the 14th-century Sultan of Delhi, Mohammad Tughlaq in contrasting styles, a tyrannical and whimsical ruler and at the same time, an idealist who sought the best for his subjects. Most plays written by Karnad have either history or mythology as their theme, with a focus on their relevance to modern society.

The most acclaimed novel of the era was &quot;Samaskara&quot; by U.R.Anantha Murthy (1965). The novel details the search for new values and identity by the protagonist, a Brahmin, who had sexual intercourse with the untouchable mistress of his heretic adversary. Another notable work is the &quot;Swarupa&quot; (1966) by Poornachandra Tejaswi. Anantha Murthy&#x27;s &quot;Prasne&quot; (1963) contains his best collection of short stories including &quot;Ghatashraddha&quot;, which describes the tragedy that befell a young pregnant widow, from the point of view of a boy. His collection &quot;Mouni&quot; (1973) includes the stories &quot;Navilugulu&quot; (&quot;Peacocks&quot;) and &quot;Clip Joint&quot;.

The Navya movement was not without its critics. The doubt, dilemmas and indecision in every turn of the plot resulted in increasingly sophisticated and complex narrations, which some readers found uninteresting. It was derided as an intellectual exercise of the middle class intelligentsia; in its extreme sophistication, it was thought to have lost its touch with realities of life. This led to a gradual waning of the Navya school as it was supplanted by emerging waves of &quot;Navyottara&quot;, &quot;Bandaya&quot; (protest) and &quot;Dalit&quot; schools.

==Post-modern trends==
From the early 1970s, a segment of writers including many &quot;Navya&quot; writers started to write novels and stories that were anti-&quot;Navya&quot;. This genre was called &quot;Navyottara&quot; and sought to fulfil a more socially responsible role. The best-known authors in this form of writing were Poornachandra Tejaswi and Devanur Mahadeva. In his preface to Abachurina Post Office, Tejaswi expressed a path breaking observation towards then prevailing literary movements. Tejaswi won the &quot;most creative novel of the year&quot; for his &quot;Karvalo&quot; in 1980 and &quot;Chidambara Rahasya&quot; in 1985 from the Sahitya Akademi.

Modernisation and westernisation continue to inform sensibilities and spawn new literary techniques and genres. The most striking developments in recent times have been the rise of the prose form to a position of predominance — a position earlier held by poetry — and the prodigious growth in dramatic literature. More recently &quot;Bandaya&quot; (Rebellion) and Dalit literature, in some ways a throwback to the &quot;Pragatishila&quot; (Progressivism) days, have come to the fore. Mahadeva&#x27;s &quot;Marikondavaru&quot; (&quot;Those who sold themselves&quot;) and &quot;Mudala Seemeli Kole Gile Ityadi&quot; (&quot;Murder in the Eastern Region&quot;) are examples of this trend.

Kannada writers have been presented with 8 Jnanpith awards, 63 Sahitya Akademi awards and 9 Sahitya Akademi Fellowships in India, and numerous other national and international awards since India&#x27;s independence.

<text>Edward Troughton (October 1753 – 12 June 1835) was a British instrument maker who was notable for making telescopes and other astronomical instruments.

==Life==

Troughton was born at Corney, Cumberland, the youngest of six children to Francis Troughton, a husbandman on a farm, and his wife, Mary Stable. Originally raised to tend animals, Edward went to London in 1773. He then served an apprenticeship with his uncle, John Troughton (b.c.1716) alongside his elder brother, also John Troughton, and in 1779 he became his business partner and soon established himself as the top maker of navigational, surveying and astronomical instruments in Britain. They were based at 136 Fleet Street in central London. Their shop was called the &quot;Sign of the Orrery&quot;.

In 1795 he delivered what is now known as the Troughton Equatorial telescope to the Armagh Observatory, a 2-inch aperture refractor telescope mounted equatorially, and its first major instrument since its founding in 1790 (It survived into the 21st century also). He created the Groombridge Transit Circle in 1806, which Stephen Groombridge used to compile his star catalogue. He did not merely build instruments, but designed and invented new ones.

Troughton was awarded the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1809. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in March 1810, a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1817, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1822.

In 1826, after John&#x27;s death and in failing health himself, he took on William Simms as a partner and the firm became known as Troughton &amp; Simms.

Troughton was involved in a lawsuit against Sir James South, who was dissatisfied with the quality of an equatorial mounting that Troughton made for him. Troughton sued for payment, and with informal legal counsel provided by Richard Sheepshanks, he prevailed.

Troughton was colour blind.

He died in London on 12 June 1835 and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery in south London. He was unmarried and had no children.

==Honours==
Troughton Rocks in Antarctica are named after Edward Troughton. Troughton Road near to the location of the Charlton Troughton &amp; Simms Mathematical Instrument Works was also named after Edward Troughton.

<text>Richard Dorian Matvichuk (born February 5, 1973) is a Canadian former ice hockey defenceman. He played 14 seasons in the National Hockey League with the Minnesota North Stars/Dallas Stars, and the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League.

==Playing career==
Although he was born in Edmonton, Alberta, Matvichuk was raised in the nearby city of Fort Saskatchewan. Matvichuk was drafted eighth overall in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft by the Minnesota North Stars, and made the transition, along with several other players, including Mike Modano and Derian Hatcher, to the franchise&#x27;s move to Dallas, and played 733 regular season games as a Dallas Star. Matvichuk played 12 years for the Stars, scoring 38 goals and 129 assists, although with a rather low average of penalty minutes compared with his physical style of play.

Matvichuk was also a part of the 1999 Stanley Cup winning team which brought Dallas their first championship trophy. He became a free agent in the 2004 NHL offseason. He was later signed by the New Jersey Devils, making a similar Stars-to-Devils transition as Jamie Langenbrunner and Joe Nieuwendyk. He missed all but the last game of the 2006–07 season after having back surgery. He was released by the Columbus Blue Jackets during the 2008 preseason, when he was there on a tryout basis.

==Coaching==
On May 4, 2012, Matvichuk was announced as the assistant general manager and defensive coach of Central Hockey League&#x27;s Allen Americans. On June 12, 2014, he was named the head coach of the ECHL&#x27;s Missouri Mavericks. On June 2, 2016, Matvichuk was named head coach of the Western Hockey League&#x27;s Prince George Cougars. He was fired as head coach of the Cougars on February 8, 2019, after an overall 85–89–22 record with the team that was on an eleven-game losing streak during the 2018–19 season.

<doc id="860188" wikidata="Q312469" url="?curid=860188" title="Alexander Yakovlev">
<text>Alexander Nikolayevich Yakovlev (; 2 December 1923 – 18 October 2005) was a Soviet and Russian politician, diplomat, and historian. A member of the Politburo and Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union throughout the 1980s, he was termed the &quot;godfather of glasnost&quot;, and was the intellectual force behind Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s reform programme of glasnost and perestroika.

Born into a rural family, Yakovlev served as a platoon commander of a marine brigade during World War II, and became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union following the war. During the rule of Nikita Khrushchev, he became a member of the Central Committee of the CPSU, before resigning to study abroad as part of the Fulbright Programme, returning in 1960. Under Leonid Brezhnev, he became Deputy Head of Agitprop and was placed in charge of a group on creating the 1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union. He was later demoted to ambassador to Canada, in response to his public opposition to ethnic nationalism within the Soviet Union.

In the early 1980s, Yakovlev returned to the Soviet Union, and became a prominent supporter of Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s proposed reforms. In response to his perceived importance in the reforms, he came under attack from hardliners such as Alexander Lebed and Gennady Zyuganov, eventually resigning two days prior to the 1991 Soviet coup d&#x27;état attempt. During the coup attempt, Yakovlev was a supporter of pro-democratic forces, and later became a supporter of Boris Yeltsin before turning against his successor, Vladimir Putin, in response to democratic backsliding which occurred during Putin&#x27;s presidency.

==Early life and education==
The first child of five, Yakovlev was born to a peasant family in a small village called Korolyovo, on the Volga River, near Yaroslavl. He had four sisters, two of whom died in infancy. His father, Nikolai Alekseyevich Yakovlev, only attended school for four years, and his mother, Agafiya Mikhailovna, for three months. Yakovlev was sickly in childhood and suffered from scrofula. His father served in the Red Cavalry during the Russian Civil War and was a devoted communist; he became the first chairman of a local collective farm. Their house was set ablaze while he was seven, and the family moved to Krasnye Tkachi.

=== World War II service ===
Yakovlev graduated from secondary school days before Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union. He was drafted into the Soviet Navy in November 1941, with brief training, and became part of the . He served as a platoon commander of the , on the Volkhov Front during the Siege of Leningrad. On 6 August 1942, he was leading 30 Chuvash soldiers and was ordered to charge German positions in Vinyagolovo near Leningrad and was badly wounded. He was hospitalised until February 1943, and was subsequently demobilised. He became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1944. At this time he regarded the Communist Party as &quot;life&#x27;s truth&quot;, and affirmed he was totally loyal and faithful to Soviet Union, and he was an ardent admirer of Joseph Stalin.

=== Stalin and Khrushchev periods ===
In September 1945, he resumed education at the to study history. On September 8, 1945, he married Nina Ivanovna Smirnova. He graduated the same year and went to Moscow to attend the Higher Party School. In November 1946, he was appointed the instructor of the Department of Propaganda and Agitation in Yaroslavl, a post he held for a year and a half. Shortly after this, he had his first doubts about the regime, when he was shocked to see train after train carrying Soviet ex-prisoners-of-war being sent to labour camps. At the Vspolye train station, he saw weeping women and was dismayed at how they were treated. This memory troubled him deeply and never left him.

In March 1953, shortly after Stalin&#x27;s death, he was assigned to the party&#x27;s Central Committee as an instructor in the department of schools. On 25 February 1956, Khrushchev&#x27;s Secret Speech became the most traumatic event in Yakovlev&#x27;s early Moscow life; he listened to the speech from a balcony in the Grand Kremlin Palace. After the 20th Party Congress, Yakovlev lost his previous enthusiasm for communism and led a double life. He wanted to turn to the original sources on Communism—Marx, Engels, Lenin, German philosophers, French and Italian socialists and British economists. He asked to leave the Central Committee to enroll in the Academy of Social Sciences of the Central Committee. While twice refused, he was finally allowed to study there for two years and became convinced that Marxism-Leninism was hollow, impractical, and inhumane, as well as a prognostic fraud. This healed his internal political conflict following the 20th Party Congress. He began to agree with Khrushchev.

=== Studies at Columbia University ===
Beginning in 1958, he was chosen as a exchange student at Columbia University in the United States for one year, as part of the Fulbright Programme. Of the seventeen Soviet students, fourteen were selected by the KGB. Yakovlev and three others, including Oleg Kalugin, went to Columbia. All other students besides Yakovlev were members of the KGB. He intensively studied the English language, Roosevelt and the New Deal, drawing connections between the United States at that time and the Soviet Union. At the end, in May 1959, the Soviet visitors were taken on a thirty-day tour of the United States, during which he stayed with families from Vermont, Chicago and Iowa. However, his year in America did little to assuage his anti-Americanism because of the greed, racism, and other things that he witnessed. Yakovlev returned to the Central Committee to work on ideology and propaganda, and published several anti-American books. He defended a dissertation dealing with the historiography of US foreign policy, and received the degree of kandidat nauk, the equivalent of a doctorate, in July 1960.

== Early political career and exile ==
In July 1965, he was appointed the first deputy head of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the CPSU by Leonid Brezhnev. In August 1968, Yakovlev was sent to Prague as the representative of Central Committee, and witnessed the entry of tanks into the city. He later spoke out against removing Alexander Dubček. That same year, he was placed in command of a group charged with drafting a new constitution. Yakovlev served as editor of several party publications and rose to the key position of head of the CPSU&#x27;s Department of Ideology and Propaganda from 1969 to 1973. In January 1970, he visited the United States again, meeting then-Governor of California Ronald Reagan, diplomat Henry Kissinger, and actress Jane Fonda, who warned him that Moscow &quot;did not appreciate the full danger of American militarism&quot;. This trip, again, failed to change his unfavourable impression of the United States.

=== Exile to Canada ===
In 1972, he took a bold stand by publishing the article entitled &quot;Against Antihistoricism&quot; in &quot;Literaturnaya Gazeta,&quot; critical of Russian nationalism, and nationalism in the Soviet Union in general. As a result, he was removed from his position. Given the choice of a diplomatic post as a form of exile, he chose to be the ambassador to Canada, remaining at that post for a decade. He arrived in Canada in July 1973. During this time, he and Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau became close friends. Trudeau&#x27;s second son, Alexandre Trudeau, was named after Yakovlev.

From 16 to 23 May 1983, Yakovlev accompanied Mikhail Gorbachev, who at the time was the Soviet official in charge of agriculture, on his tour of Canada. The purpose of the visit was to tour Canadian farms and agricultural institutions, in the hopes of taking lessons that could be applied in the Soviet Union. However, the two also renewed their earlier friendship and, tentatively at first, began to discuss the prospect of liberalisation in the Soviet Union.

In an interview years later, Yakovlev recalled:
At first we kind of sniffed around each other and our conversations didn&#x27;t touch on serious issues. And then, verily, history plays tricks on one, we had a lot of time together as guests of then Liberal Minister of Agriculture Eugene Whelan in Canada who, himself, was too late for the reception because he was stuck with some striking farmers somewhere. So we took a long walk on that Minister&#x27;s farm and, as it often happens, both of us suddenly were just kind of flooded and let go. I somehow, for some reason, threw caution to the wind and started telling him about what I considered to be utter stupidities in the area of foreign affairs, especially about those SS-20 missiles that were being stationed in Europe and a lot of other things. And he did the same thing. We were completely frank. He frankly talked about the problems in the internal situation in Russia. He was saying that under these conditions, the conditions of dictatorship and absence of freedom, the country would simply perish. So it was at that time, during our three-hour conversation, almost as if our heads were knocked together, that we poured it all out and during that three-hour conversation we actually came to agreement on all our main points.

=== Return to the Soviet Union ===
Two weeks after the visit, as a result of Gorbachev&#x27;s interventions, Yakovlev was recalled from Canada by Yuri Andropov and became Director of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union in Moscow on 16 August 1983; he was succeeded by his friend Yevgeny Primakov (himself later Prime Minister of Russia) in 1985.

==Perestroika==

When Gorbachev became General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1985, Yakovlev became a senior advisor, helping to shape Soviet foreign policy by advocating Soviet non-intervention in Eastern Europe, and accompanying Gorbachev on his five summit meetings with President of the United States Ronald Reagan. In the summer of 1985, Yakovlev became head of the propaganda department of the CPSU Central Committee. Domestically, he argued in favour of the reform programmes that became known as glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) and played a key role in executing those policies.

In 1987, the Russian neo-Nazi organization Pamyat sent a letter entitled &quot;Stop Yakovlev!&quot; to the plenum of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, labelling Yakovlev as a Jew and the main instigator of a course of action that would lead to the &#x27;capitulation before the imperialists&#x27;.

For decades, it was the official policy of the Soviet Union to deny the existence of the secret protocol to the Nazi–Soviet Pact. At the behest of Mikhail Gorbachev, Yakovlev headed a commission investigating the existence of such a protocol. In December 1989 Yakovlev concluded that the protocol had existed and revealed his findings to the Soviet Parliament. As a result, the first multi-party elected Congress of Soviets since 1918 &quot;passed the declaration admitting the existence of the secret protocols, condemning and denouncing them&quot;.

== Downfall and later life ==
He was promoted to the Politburo in 1987, but by 1990 he had become the focus of attacks by hardliner communists in the party opposed to liberalisation. At the 28th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in July 1990, a cynical Alexander Lebed caused uproar when he asked Yakovlev: &quot;Alexander Nikolayevich... How many faces have you got?&quot; An embarrassed Yakovlev consulted his colleagues and continued on with the proceedings, but resigned from the Politburo the day after the congress concluded. As the communists opposed to liberalisation gained strength, his position became more tenuous; fiercely attacked by his former protégé Gennady Zyuganov in May 1991, he resigned from the CPSU two days before the August Coup in 1991. During the coup, Yakovlev joined the democratic opposition against it. Following the failed coup attempt, Yakovlev blamed Gorbachev for having been naïve in bringing the plotters into his inner circle, saying Gorbachev was &quot;guilty of forming a team of traitors. Why did he surround himself with people capable of treason?&quot;

In his book &quot;Inside the Stalin Archives&quot; (2008), Jonathan Brent relates that in 1991, when there were Lithuanian crowds demonstrating for independence from the Soviet Union, Gorbachev consulted Yakovlev about the wisdom of an armed repression against them. Gorbachev asked, &quot;Should we shoot?&quot; Yakovlev answered that, &quot;if a single Soviet soldier fired a single bullet on the unarmed crowds, Soviet power would be over.&quot; Despite Yakovlev&#x27;s warnings, the Soviet Union proceeded to invade Lithuania following its declaration of independence, and the Soviet Union collapsed seven months later.Yakovlev led Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s commission for the rehabilitation of victims of Soviet political repression. In the years following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Yakovlev wrote and lectured extensively on history, politics and economics. He acted as the leader of the Russian Party of Social Democracy, which in the mid-1990s fused into the United Democrats, a pro-reform alliance that was later reorganised into the Union of Right Forces. In 2002, acting as head of the Presidential Committee for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Political Repression, he was present at the announcement of the release of a CD detailing names and short biographies of the victims of Soviet purges. In his later life, he founded and led the International Democracy Foundation. He advocated taking responsibility for the past crimes of communism and was critical of President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s restrictions on democracy. 

In 2000, he publicly alleged that Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, who became famous for his role in saving thousands of Hungarian Jews from the Holocaust, was shot and killed in Soviet secret police headquarters in 1947. He was called &quot;God&#x27;s commie&quot; in a 2002 article for investigating crimes of the Soviet state.

<text>This list of animal rights groups consists of groups in the animal rights movement. Such animal rights groups work towards their ideals, which include the viewpoint that animals should have equivalent rights to humans, such as not being &quot;used&quot; in research, food, clothing and entertainment industries, and seek to end the status of animals as property. (Cf. Animal welfare.)

This list contains only groups, organizations and leaderless resistance networks that have articles within Wikipedia.

<doc id="860196" wikidata="Q5513913" url="?curid=860196" title="General Motors Y platform">
<text>The Y platform, or Y body, designation has been used twice by the General Motors Corporation to describe a series of vehicles all built on the same basic body and sharing many parts and characteristics. The first was for a group of entry-level compacts including the conventional front-engine compacts built by GM divisions Buick, Oldsmobile and Pontiac from 1961 to 1963. The second, and current, incarnation is used for a high-end rear-wheel drive sports-car platform (chiefly that of the Chevrolet Corvette) from the 1970s through the 2000s.

==First Y platform (1960–1963)==

The original Y bodies were:

* Buick Special (1961–1963)
* Buick Skylark (1962–1963)
* Oldsmobile F-85 (1961–1963)
* Oldsmobile Cutlass (1961–1963)
* Oldsmobile Jetfire (1962–1963)
* Pontiac Tempest (1961–1963)
* Pontiac Tempest LeMans (1961–1962)
* Pontiac LeMans (1963)

Initially, each of the Y-body compacts from Buick, Olds and Pontiac were only offered as four-door sedans and station wagons when introduced in the fall of 1960 as 1961 models. In mid-1961, each of three divisions introduced pillared two-door models to the line with sportier versions of the Buick and Olds models added including the Special Skylark and F-85 Cutlass, both of which featured bucket seats, custom interior and exterior trim, and more powerful engines. For 1962, convertibles were added to the lineup by each of the divisions, with Pontiac also adding the sportier Tempest LeMans coupe and convertible to its compact lineup.

This all-new platform replaced vehicles GM was importing from Europe, selling the Vauxhall Victor that was made in England.

The rear-engined 1960-69 Chevrolet Corvair Z-body up to 1964 used a variation of the rear swing-axle suspension and a transaxle similar to that found on the 1961-63 Pontiac Tempest. The 1961-62 Corvair station wagons even utilized a roofline similar to that on the 1961-63 Y-body wagons. Chevrolet&#x27;s front-engine compact, introduced as the Chevy II for 1962 had some dimensions similar to the Y-body cars, but had a two-inch shorter wheelbase, was smaller in length and width and utilized a distinct X-body platform which featured semi-unibody construction, single-leaf spring rear suspension and conventional in-line four-, six-cylinder and later small-block V-8 engines.

===First Y platform innovations===
The Y-body family of cars contained more innovative features than all other American products of that decade. Each model contained at least one notable advance:
* Buick Special and Oldsmobile F-85 for all three years shared an aluminum block 215 cubic-inch V8 engine featuring cast-iron liners to prevent overheating and block warpage problems common with aluminum block engines. Although Buick and Olds shared the same basic engine design, both divisions used different cylinder heads, camshafts, carburetors and compression ratios. The 215 V8 was also available on the Pontiac Tempest for 1961 and 1962 and used the Buick version, but very few Tempests were so-equipped.
* For 1962, Buick introduced a new 198 cubic-inch V6 engine for the lower-line Special models in order to allow for a lower base price. That V6 shared many parts and dimensions with the aluminum V8 engine but featured a cast iron block. 
* Oldsmobile introduced a turbocharged version of the 215 V8 in mid-1962 for a special performance version of the F-85/Cutlass called the Jetfire. This engine was among the first production turbocharged engines ever offered in a passenger car, the other being the Chevrolet Corvair&#x27;s turbocharged flat-six engine introduced simultaneously for the Monza Spyder. The Olds Jetfire turbocharged V8 featured a four-barrel, 10.25 to 1 compression and was rated at 215 horsepower - one horsepower per cubic inch.
* The Pontiac Tempest came standard with a 195 cubic-inch slant four-cylinder engine - then the only U.S.-built passenger car with such an engine. The Tempest four was really created from half a 389 cubic inch V8 block used in the standard Pontiacs. This engine, available with one- and four-barrel carburetion offered horsepower ratings ranging from 110 to 166.
* The Tempest also used a rear transmission, or transaxle to permit four wheel independent suspension, a flat floor, eliminating the driveshaft hump, for improved interior space, while the Buick Special and Olds F-85 used a conventional front engine/front transmission drivetrain, albeit, with a two piece driveshaft. 
* The Tempest also used an independent rear swing axle suspension similar to the rear-engine Chevy Corvair while the Buick and Olds compacts featured a conventional rear coil spring suspension.
* For 1963, Pontiac replaced the Buick-sourced 215 aluminum V8 with a Pontiac built 336 cubic-inch V8 as the top power option for the Tempest. No one seems to know why the 326 of 1963 was called a 326, because the true displacement was 336. This 326 was based on the big Pontiac&#x27;s 389 V8 and shared many of the larger engine&#x27;s dimensions and components with horsepower ratings of 260 and 280. The &#x27;63 326 Tempest/LeMans served as a testbed for the 389-powered 1964 GTO that would be based on a larger and more conventionally engineered Tempest introduced the following year.

Motor Trend magazine named the Corvair as its 1960 Car of the Year, Tempest as 1961&#x27;s Car of the Year, and the V6 Special received the award in 1962.

===End of the first Y platform===
Each of the Buick, Olds and Pontiac Y-body senior compacts were replaced by a larger intermediate-sized platform called the A-Body for the 1964 model year, which was shared with the Chevrolet Chevelle. With the switch from a senior compact to an intermediate-sized platform, most of these &quot;innovative&quot; features were discontinued such as the Tempest&#x27;s four-cylinder engine and transaxle, the aluminum block V8 (whose tooling was sold to Rover of England who improved the design enjoying considerable success with it as the Rover V8 in models such as the Rover P5B and Range Rover) and the Olds Jetfire&#x27;s turbocharged version of that V8. Also, the uni-body construction used in the Y-body cars was replaced by conventional body-on-frame construction for the A-body. The Buick V6 was continued and enlarged to 225 cubic inches with the basic engine remaining in production for many years, with a 3.8-liter or 231 cubic-inch displacement. The aluminum V8 was replaced by conventional cast-iron block V8s of 300 cubic inches for the Buick Special/Skylark and 330 inches for the Oldsmobile F-85/Cutlass, while Pontiac carried over its 326 cubic-inch V8 to the &#x27;64 Tempest/LeMans line while switching the base engine from the four-cylinder to a 215 cubic-inch inline six-cylinder.

==Second Y platform (1976–present)==

Y bodies built for 1976-1980 used a GM-standard 13 character Vehicle Identification Number, or VIN, with the second character denoting the series, followed by the body type, engine code, model year and assembly plant.

Y bodies built for 1981-1984 can be identified by the inclusion of the Y as the fifth character in the 17 character VIN. Y bodies built for 1985 and later can be identified by the inclusion of the Y as the fourth character in the VIN. Only two Y-body cars have been produced in this second group:

* 2004–2009 Cadillac XLR
* 1976–2019 Chevrolet Corvette

The Y-Body has a rear-wheel drive, front-engined (through 2019) V8 layout, accommodating either a small block Chevrolet V8 (such as an LT4 or LS1) in the Corvette, or the 32-valve DOHC Northstar V8 in the XLR. The Y-Body also has 4-wheel independent suspension. Like a standard rear-wheel drive, front-engined chassis, the Y-Body&#x27;s V8 engine is longitudinally mounted, but unlike many such cars, the Y-Body incorporates a rear-mounted transmission (1997-present) instead of a transmission mounted directly to the engine. Power is transferred to the transmission via a torque tube. The transmission is offered in both 4/5/6/8-speed automatic versions and 6 and 7-speed manual versions. As of 2015 the Y platform is considered as the sole perimeter frame automobile in production (the perimeter frame has an integrated endoskeleton which serves as a safety cage). 

The front-engine C7 Corvette (2014-2019) used the Y1XX platform. The mid-engine C8 Corvette (2020-present) uses the Y2XX platform. 

GM&#x27;s Kappa platform was inspired by the Y-body. The distinctive feature of both platforms is the backbone central-tunnel design.

<text>William Simms (7 December 1793 – 21 June 1860) was a British scientific instrument maker.

==Early life==
He was born in Birmingham, the second of nine children of William Simms (1763-1828), a toy maker. Soon after William Simm&#x27;s birth the family moved to London so that William Simms Sr. could help his ailing father, James Simms, who had a jewellery business in Whitecross Street. This business was soon converted to the manufacture of optical instruments. William Sr. prospered and in 1804 he was elected a Freeman of the City.

William Simms Jr. was sent in January 1806 to be educated in mathematics by a Mr. Hayward. After two years education in January 1808 he was apprenticed to Thomas Penstone, a member of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths. However William&#x27;s interests lay elsewhere and in 1808 he was apprenticed to his father.

==Career==
He was elected a Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths in 1815 and set up in business for himself, working until 1818 at his father&#x27;s Blackfriars premises. His elder brother James was already establishing his own reputation for navigational instruments.

William Simms&#x27; chief interest was the division of the circle, the accuracy of which was essential to the manufacture of accurate scientific instruments. He became a correspondent of Thomas Jones, who brought him into contact with the instrument maker Edward Troughton and also persuaded him to join the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce. Here he met the engineer Bryan Donkin, and also Colonel Colby of the Ordnance Survey.

In the 1825 Simms was asked to repair and redivide an astronomical circle made by Troughton in 1800. Simms made and replaced parts where required, then redivided the circle. Later Simms wrote a paper for Troughton proposing a new method for dividing circles that was more accurate than an engine and quicker than using a roller. Edward Troughton took on William Simms as a partner in 1826 
On Troughton&#x27;s retirement Simms took over his business, which had a very good reputation in the manufacture of scientific instruments.

Simms specialized in surveying instruments and from 1817 supplied theodolites to the Ordnance Survey and then to the East India Company, including those used by George Everest. On a larger scale he supplied telescopes, mural circles and other astronomical instruments to observatories at Kraków, Madras, Cambridge, Lucknow, Calcutta, Edinburgh, Brussels, Greenwich and other places. By the close of his career he had supplied most of the world&#x27;s leading observatories with equipment.

Simms&#x27; work formed the basis of the treatise on mathematical instruments written by his younger brother Frederick Walter Simms, who went on to become an important writer on civil engineering.

His reputation was enhanced by the improvements he made to graduating instruments and his self-acting circular dividing engine reduced the work involved in manufacture from weeks to hours. He also helped standardize the measures of length the yard and chain for the Admiralty.

Simms was elected an Associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1828. He was a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, which he joined in 1831, and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1852.

Simms died at the family home in Carshalton on 21 June 1860 and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery. His family, most especially his son James Simms carried on his instrument making work.

==Honours==
Simms Rock in Antarctica is named after William Simms.

<doc id="860201" wikidata="Q470352" url="?curid=860201" title="Volmari Iso-Hollo">
<text>Volmari &quot;Vomma&quot; Fritijof Iso-Hollo (5 January 1907 – 23 June 1969) was a Finnish runner. He competed at the 1932 and 1936 Olympics in the 3000 m steeplechase and 10000 m and won two gold, one silver and one bronze medals. Iso-Hollo was one of the last &quot;Flying Finns&quot;, who dominated distance running between the World Wars.
As a youth, Iso-Hollo did skiing, gymnastics and boxing, and took up running when he joined the army. He was successful over distances between 400 m and marathon.

Iso-Hollo won his first Olympic gold medal in the 3000 m steeplechase at the 1932 Summer Olympics. He was denied a chance at the world record because the officials lost count of the number of laps – the lap-counter was looking the wrong way, being absorbed in the decathlon pole vault. When Iso-Hollo went to his last lap, the official failed to ring the bell, and the entire field kept on running, covering the distance of 3460 m. If the distance were 3000 m, Iso-Hollo probably would have broken the world record. He also won the silver in the 10,000 m.

In 1933, Iso-Hollo broke the 3000 m steeplechase world record, running 9.09.4 in Lahti and won the British AAA Championships title in the steeplechase event at the British 1933 AAA Championships. 

He went to the 1936 Summer Olympics as a favourite. He won the steeplechase by three seconds, finishing with a new world record of 9:03.8, and earned a bronze medal over the 10,000 m. After the Olympics, Iso-Hollo fell ill with rheumatism but kept on competing until 1945. He died in 1969 aged 62.

<doc id="860216" wikidata="Q298551" url="?curid=860216" title="Tony Jaa">
<text>Tatchakorn Yeerum (born 1976) (, , ; formerly Phanom Yeerum (, )), better known internationally as Tony Jaa and in Thailand as Jaa Phanom (, , ), is a Thai martial artist, actor, action choreographer, stuntman, and director. Known for his explosive martial arts stunt work, Jaa broke out in 2003 with &quot;Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior&quot;, which earned him international recognition and spawned two sequels. 

Jaa began training in Muay Thai at age 10, and fought professionally as a Muay Thai fighter when he was discovered by filmmaker Panna Rittikrai. Prior to becoming a leading actor, Jaa worked as a stuntman for Muay Thai Stunt for 14 years, appearing in many of Rittikrai&#x27;s films. After the success of &quot;Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior&quot; (2003), which earned him a Star Entertainment Award, Jaa starred in the well-received films &quot;Ong Bak 3&quot; (2010), &quot;Furious 7&quot; (2015), which marked his first English-speaking role, &quot;SPL II: A Time for Consequences&quot; (2015), which marked his Hong Kong debut, &quot;Master Z: Ip Man Legacy&quot; (2018), &quot;Triple Threat&quot; (2019), and &quot;Detective Chinatown 3&quot; (2021). He also starred in &quot;Tom-Yum-Goong&quot; (2005), which earned him a Suphannahong National Film Award, &quot;Ong Bak 2: The Beginning&quot; (2008), which marked his directorial debut, and &quot;Tom Yum Goong 2&quot; (2013). In 2017, he starred in the commercially successful films &quot;&quot; and &quot;Paradox&quot;.

Jaa is credited with helping establish the Thai action genre worldwide, and his martial arts films are credited with helping showcase the Thai combat systems of Muay Thai, Muay Boran, and &quot;Muay Kotchasaan&quot; (a fighting style Jaa and Rittikrai developed in 2005). Jaa is also trained in the styles of Krabi-Krabong and Taekwondo. He is widely considered one of the greatest martial arts stars in the history of cinema.

==Early life==
Tony Jaa was born and raised in a rural area in Surin Province to Rin Saipetch and Thongdee Yeerum. In his youth, he watched films by Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan at temple fairs, which inspired him to learn martial arts. He practiced the techniques in his father&#x27;s rice paddy. &quot;What they [Lee and Chan] did was so beautiful, so heroic that I wanted to do it too,&quot; Jaa told &quot;Time&quot; in a 2004 interview. &quot;I practiced until I could do the move exactly as I had seen the masters do it.&quot; Jaa was also inspired by Jet Li.

Tony Jaa began training in Muay Thai at his local temple at age 10. According to Jaa, he fought professionally as a Muay Thai fighter when filmmaker Panna Rittikrai saw him and asked him if he would like to do stunts in one of his films. Panna had instructed Jaa to attend Maha Sarakham College of Physical Education in Maha Sarakham Province from which he graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree. His early martial arts experience included Taekwondo, Muay Thai, Muay Boran, and Krabi-Krabong, with an emphasis on gymnastics and acrobatics. His films have showcased various other martial arts styles, such as Kung-fu, Silat, and Jiu-Jitsu.

==Career==
===Stunt work===
Tony Jaa initially worked as a stuntman for Muay Thai Stunt for 14 years, appearing in many of Rittikrai&#x27;s films. He doubled for Sammo Hung when the martial-arts movie actor made a commercial for an energy drink that required him to grasp an elephant&#x27;s tusks and somersault onto the elephant&#x27;s back. He was also a stunt double in the Thai television series &quot;Insee Daeng&quot; (&quot;Red Eagle&quot;).

===2003–2008: International success===

Together, Panna and Jaa developed an interest in Muay Boran, the predecessor of muay thai and worked and trained for four years at the art with the intention of developing a film about it. Eventually they were able to put together a short film showing what Jaa could do with the help of instructor Grandmaster Mark Harris. One of the people they showed it to was producer-director Prachya Pinkaew.

This led to &quot;Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior&quot; in 2003, Jaa&#x27;s break-out role as a leading man. Jaa did all the stunts without mechanical assistance or computer-generated effects and it showcased his style of extreme acrobatics and speedy, dance-like moves. Injuries suffered in the filming included a ligament injury and a sprained ankle. One scene in the film involved fighting with another actor while his own trousers were on fire. &quot;I actually got burned,&quot; he said in a 2005 interview. &quot;I really had to concentrate because once my pants were on fire the flames spread upwards very fast and burnt my eyebrows, my eyelashes and my nose. Then we had to do a couple more takes to get it right.&quot;

His second major movie was &quot;Tom-Yum-Goong&quot; (&quot;The Protector&quot; in the US), named after tom yum soup, which included a style of Muay Thai that imitates elephants.

In August 2006, he was in New York to promote the US release of &quot;The Protector&quot;, including an appearance at the Museum of the Moving Image.

By mid 2000s, dubbed versions of Jaa&#x27;s films gained international recognition through theatrical releases, television broadcasts, and on-demand platforms. His films were noted to be innovative productions featuring fast paced martial arts choreography and stunts. It established him as a global action icon.

Sahamongkol Film International advertised that Tony Jaa&#x27;s third film would be called &quot;Sword&quot; or &quot;Daab Atamas&quot;, about the art of Thai two-sword fighting (&quot;daab song mue&quot;), with a script by Prapas Chonsalanont. But due to a falling out between Prachya and Jaa, which neither has publicly commented on, &quot;Sword&quot; was cancelled.

In March 2006, it was reported that there would be a sequel to &quot;Ong Bak&quot; titled &quot;Ong Bak 2&quot;. Directed by and starring Jaa, it was released in December 2008.

Jaa&#x27;s films captured the attention of his hero, Jackie Chan, who asked director Brett Ratner to cast Jaa in &quot;Rush Hour 3&quot;. &quot;I gave the director videos of Jaa because I think he is the most well-rounded of all action stars,&quot; Chan told the Associated Press. &quot;The director liked him a lot,&quot; Chan said. However, Jaa mentioned that he is unable to participate in the film because of scheduling conflicts with &quot;Ong Bak 2&quot;.

While Jaa and Amogelang were working on &quot;Ong Bak 2&quot;, director Prachya Pinkaew and action choreographer Panna Rittikrai were working on &quot;Chocolate&quot;, starring a female martial artist, Nicharee Vismistananda and released 6 February 2008. Jaa had been cast in a small role in a third installment of the &quot;King Naresuan&quot; film series directed by Chatrichalerm Yukol, although the film was ultimately cancelled. &quot;Ong Bak 3&quot; was released in 2010 and provides a conclusion to this franchise trilogy.

===2010–present: Career expansion===

Tony Jaa and Panna Rittikrai co-directed &quot;Ong Bak 3&quot;. 

After leaving the monastery, Jaa accepted a deal with Sahamongkol film company. He filmed &quot;Tom Yum Goong 2&quot; (2013) for them, with &quot;Chocolate&quot; star Jija Yanin in a major role too, the first time Jaa has shared the big screen with another international martial arts star. Director Prachya Pinkaew and choreographer Panna Rittikrai also returned for this film.

In 2013, Jaa teamed up with Dolph Lundgren in the Thai western-comedy &quot;A Man Will Rise&quot; (which remains unfinished) and in 2014 in Lundgren&#x27;s pet project &quot;Skin Trade&quot;. Jaa then co-starred in the blockbuster action film &quot;Furious 7&quot; (2015), produced by and starring Vin Diesel and directed by James Wan. Jaa also teamed up with fellow actors Louis Koo and Wu Jing in Hong Kong-Chinese action film &quot;SPL II: A Time for Consequences&quot; (2015)&quot;.&quot;

Jaa was briefly attached to the remake of &quot;&quot;. However, in November 2014, it was announced that he had exited the project. Jaa&#x27;s most recent project was co-starring with Vin Diesel again in &quot;&quot;, directed by D. J. Caruso and released in January 2017.

In October 2016, Jaa co-starred with Koo again in &quot;Paradox&quot;, the third installment of the .

He was inducted into the Martial Arts History Museum Hall of Fame in 2017.

<doc id="860217" wikidata="Q6825024" url="?curid=860217" title="Metropolitan Building (Minneapolis)">
<text>The Metropolitan Building, originally known as the Northwestern Guaranty Loan Building, is considered to be one of the most architecturally significant structures in the history of Minneapolis, Minnesota. It stood from 1890 until it was torn down starting in 1961 as part of major urban renewal efforts in the city that saw about 40% of the downtown district razed and replaced with new structures. At the time, the pending destruction of the Richardsonian Romanesque building provided a catalyst for historic preservation movements in the city and across the state.

==Early skyscraper==

The building is considered the city&#x27;s first skyscraper, with 12 stories and standing tall. Small observation towers poked up above the corners, and the rooftop had a popular garden. It was built of green New Hampshire granite and red Lake Superior sandstone, with the interiors dressed in antique oak and beautiful ornamental iron and brass work by Crown Iron Works Company of Minneapolis. A large skylight allowed the interior to be safely lit in a time when electric lighting was rare (though the building was eventually wired), and the floors of walkways circling the center court were translucent to allow more light to filter through. Architect E. Townsend Mix designed the building, and it is considered to be his most notable achievement. Many of the city&#x27;s most prestigious companies had offices in the Metropolitan.

When it went up, the building was owned by the Northwestern Guaranty Loan Company. Louis F. Menage, founder, had gained a fortune while speculating on real estate in the Minneapolis area in the 1880s. He spent $1 million on the project. Many hailed the building when it was first completed, although some such as Cass Gilbert did not like the style.

==Downfall==
The Panic of 1893 caused Menage&#x27;s company to collapse, and he fled the country. Thomas Lowry, another major real estate speculator and the owner of the area&#x27;s streetcar network, purchased the building but only held onto it for a little more than a decade before selling it to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in 1905. This is where the building gained its &quot;Metropolitan&quot; name, even though it changed hands a few more times before succumbing to the wrecking ball.
There was little practical reason to tear down the building. Records from the day indicate that it was safe and almost fully occupied at the time it was condemned. The structure came down because it was in the wrong neighborhood—on the edge of the so-called Gateway District, sitting on the southwest corner of Third Street South and Second Avenue South.

==Present day==
Some giant marble stones from the building were found in an old warehouse in Delano, Minnesota in May 2010, and the owner of the building set off a frenzy when he emailed a small group of architects and historical preservationists in Minnesota who now are trying to find money and a way to save the stones.

The Ice House Plaza, which opened in May 2012, includes several blocks of stone salvaged from the Metropolitan Building. The plaza was designed and sculpted by sculptor Zoran Mojsilov, whose piece white angel is the focal point of the plaza. Located at 26th Street and Nicollet Avenue in South Minneapolis, the public square has a fountain and benches made from remnants of the historic structure.

<text>James Simms (1828 – 4 September 1915) was an English instrument maker.

He succeeded his father William Simms (1793 – 1860) at the instrument making firm Troughton &amp; Simms. The firm made instruments of various kinds, including notably astronomical instruments and telescopes.

For about ten years, until 1871, his partner in the firm was his cousin William Simms (1817 – 1907), who was the son of his uncle James, the brother of his father William. After 1871 he was sole proprietor. After his death, he was succeeded in the firm by his sons, who were named William and James.
