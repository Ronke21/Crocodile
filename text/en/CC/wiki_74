<text>Wang Chongyang (11 January 1113 – 22 January 1170; Chinese calendar: 22nd day, 12th month, 2nd year, Zhenghe era in the reign of Emperor Huizong of Song - 4th day, 1st month, 10th year, Dading era in the reign of Emperor Shizong of Jin) was a Chinese philosopher and poet. He was a Taoist master and one of the founders of the Quanzhen School in the 12th century during the Jin dynasty (1115–1234). He was one of the Five Northern Patriarchs of Quanzhen. He also appears as a character in works of &quot;wuxia&quot; fiction.

==Name==
* Family name: Wang ()
* Given names: &quot;Zhongfu&quot; (); &quot;Dewei&quot; (); &quot;Zhe&quot; ()
* Courtesy names: &quot;Yunqing&quot; (); &quot;Shixiong&quot; (); &quot;Zhiming&quot; ()
* Pseudonym: &quot;Chongyangzi&quot; ()

==Life==
Wang was born with his birth name as &quot;Zhongfu&quot; in a wealthy family in 1113. He was educated in Chinese classics and martial arts.

Wang intended to start a rebellion against the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty, which conquered northern China in the Jin–Song Wars. According to tradition, in the summer of 1159 when he was 48, he met three Taoist immortals in a tavern, Zhongli Quan, Lü Dongbin, and Liu Haichan. They trained him in secret forms of Taoism. He changed his name to &quot;Zhe&quot; and adopted the Taoist name &quot;Chongyang&quot;.

In 1160, Wang met one of the immortals again and was provided with a set of written instructions called &quot;Ganshui Xianyuan Lu&quot;. Those written instructions included the names of two men who would later become his disciples (Ma Yu and Tan Chuduan). Wang built a tomb for himself near Mount Zhongnan and called it &quot;Tomb of the Living Dead&quot;. He lived in it for three years.

At the end of the three years, Wang filled the tomb with earth and built a hut on top of it and called it &quot;Complete Perfection Hut&quot;. He spent the next four years in the hut studying Taoism and imparting his knowledge to others. During that time, he met Tan Chuduan, who became his disciple after he cured Tan from illness. Qiu Chuji and Tan traveled around the local towns and villages with Wang and founded five Taoist congregations. Wang&#x27;s teachings were referred to the &quot;Teachings of the Complete Perfection&quot; (after the hut) and his branch of Taoism became known as the Quanzhen School.

In 1167, Wang burnt down the hut and travelled east to Shandong, where he met Ma Yu and Ma&#x27;s wife, Sun Bu&#x27;er. They became his disciples as well. He accepted a total of seven disciples who later became known as &quot;Seven Masters of Quanzhen&quot; or &quot;Seven Elders of Quanzhen&quot;. They are also called the &quot;Seven Immortals&quot; or &quot;Seven Perfected Beings&quot;.

In 1187, Emperor Shizong of Jin summoned Wang&#x27;s disciple Wang Chuyi (and, according to some sources, also Qiu Chuji) to preach in his inner palace. Later, he requested the presence of Wang Chuyi at his deathbed. Shizong&#x27;s successor, Emperor Zhangzong, banned the teaching of Quanzhen Taoism. He considered them as causing heretical and detrimental to society;He converted to Quanzhen&#x27;s teachings later and let Wang Chuyi stay in Yanjing (present-day Beijing) for a year. Shizong&#x27;s grandson Wanyan Shou later wrote a biography for Wang Chongyang.

He was immortalized in the Longmen Grottoes.

==Writings==
Wang was the author of many poems of Taoist instruction. According to legend, Liu Chuxuan became a follower of Wang after reading one of Wang&#x27;s poems.

Wang&#x27;s writings include:
*&quot;An Anthology of Complete Perfection by Chongyang&quot; (&quot;Chongyang Quanzhen Ji&quot;)
*&quot;Chongyang&#x27;s Anthology on Teaching Transformation&quot; (&quot;Chongyang Jiaohua Ji&quot;)
*&quot;Chongyang&#x27;s Anthology of the Ten Transformations by Dividing Pears&quot; (&quot;Chongyang fenli shihua ji&quot;) (The phrase &quot;to divide a pear&quot; is a pun for &quot;to separate,&quot; these were writings intended to convince Ma Yu and Sun Bu&#x27;er to separate in order to better cultivate the Dao.)

==Disciples==
The most notable ones among Wang&#x27;s seven disciples were Sun Bu&#x27;er and Qiu Chuji. Sun&#x27;s husband, Ma Yu, was one of the seven, while she became an important role model for female Taoists. Ma Yu later succeeded Wang as the leader of the Quanzhen School.

Qiu Chuji gained the favour of Genghis Khan and founded the White Cloud Monastery in Beijing. Genghis Khan granted tax-exempt status to all Quanzhen schools and placed Qiu in charge of all religions in China.

Each of the seven disciples founded his or her own lineage of Quanzhen Taoism. They are as follows:
# Ma Yu () founded the Yuxian lineage (Meeting the Immortals)
# Tan Chuduan () founded the Nanwu lineage (Southern Void)
# Liu Chuxuan () founded the Suishan lineage (Mount Sui)
# Qiu Chuji () founded the Longmen lineage (Dragon Gate)
# Wang Chuyi () founded the Yushan lineage (Mount Yu)
# Hao Datong () founded the Huashan lineage (Mount Hua)
# Sun Bu&#x27;er () founded the Qingjing lineage (Clarity and Stillness)

==In fiction==
===Condor Trilogy===
Wang Chongyang is mentioned by name in the wuxia novels &quot;The Legend of the Condor Heroes&quot; and &quot;The Return of the Condor Heroes&quot; by Jin Yong. He is already dead when the events in the first novel take place and the details of his life are revealed by other characters, such as his junior Zhou Botong. Wang Chongyang, who was nicknamed &quot;Central Divine/Divine Apex&quot; (), emerged as one of the top five martial artists in the &quot;jianghu&quot; (martial artists&#x27; community) in his time after a martial arts contest on Mount Hua. He also founded the martial arts school Quanzhen School, which is based on the real-life Quanzhen School. After his death, his seven apprentices succeed him and lead Quanzhen to become one of the major orthodox martial arts schools in the &quot;jianghu&quot;.

In the second novel, the protagonists Yang Guo and Xiaolongnü discover more details about Wang Chongyang&#x27;s life in the Ancient Tomb on Mount Zhongnan, where the Quanzhen School is based. It is revealed that Wang Chongyang had a romantic relationship with Lin Chaoying, the founder of the Ancient Tomb School, which Xiaolongnü and Yang Guo are members of. Wang Chongyang had lost to Lin Chaoying in a contest and had to keep his promise to hand over possession of the tomb and lead a monastic life as a Taoist for the rest of his life.

===Other appearances===
In the manhua series &quot;Oriental Heroes&quot; by Hong Kong artist Wong Yuk-long, Wang Chongyang is noted as the creator of the &#x27;Nine Solar Art&#x27;.

<doc id="865444" wikidata="Q1542518" url="?curid=865444" title="Grand Bend">
<text>Grand Bend is a community located on the shores of Lake Huron in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. It is part of the Municipality of Lambton Shores in Lambton County.

== History ==
In the 1830s a group of English and Scottish settlers bought lots from the Canada Company, a land development firm. One of the original settlers, Benjamin Brewster gave his name to the village, Brewster&#x27;s Mills, after he and his business partner David Smart secured rights to dam the Ausable River and started a sawmill in 1832. The villagers were mainly the families of the millhands and fishermen. Their homesteads were situated on the south side of the present village, but Grand Bend was originally founded and discovered by Frank Salter, who was a very well-known Lake resort owner and country club developer.

For twenty years Brewster existed as an isolated lumbering community. Until the opening of the highway to Goderich in 1850, both people and provisions had to travel by water. Once road connections were complete, the village was no longer solely dependent on the forests for its livelihood and opportunities for new businesses emerged.

Typical of many pioneer communities, the village assumed many different names throughout its history— Brewster&#x27;s Mills, Websterville, and Sommerville are all recorded. Early French Canadian settlers in the area referred to the present location of the village as &quot;Aux Crochets&quot;, &#x27;at the bends&#x27;. Grand Bend survived as a name, perhaps because it was the most appropriate— the tight hairpin turn in the original Ausable River where mills were first established.

==Land ownership controversies==
===&quot;Noble v Alley&quot;===
Improved roads and the arrival of the automobile near the turn of the century had the greatest influence on the growth of Grand Bend. Businesses were established to serve visitors and travellers along the highway, and with the beach, &quot;The Bend&quot; became a summer destination. In the 1940s, however, Grand Bend became the centre of a major controversy in the landmark court case of &quot;Noble v Alley&quot;. Wolf, a London, Ontario merchant, faced court challenges when he purchased property at Beach O&#x27;Pines in contravention of a restrictive covenant that prohibited the ownership of lots or cottages by persons of &quot;Jewish, Hebrew, Semitic, Negro or coloured race or blood&quot;. The case was finally heard by the Supreme Court of Canada which ruled that the restrictive covenant as constituted was invalid.

===&quot;Gibbs v Grand Bend&quot;===
In the late 1980s, a landowner went to the Supreme Court of Ontario seeking a declaration that he was the successor in title to the entire north beach of Grand Bend, amounting to , by virtue of a land grant given to the Canada Company in 1836. Although successful at trial in 1989, it was overturned at the Ontario Court of Appeal in 1995, which held that, while the beach did not constitute lands reserved to the Crown, the owners had lost ownership to it over the years because of implied dedication and acceptance for public recreational use. As he was required to give the public access to the beach, he subsequently charged parking fees to the visitors and personally cleaned up the beach every night. In 1998 he reached agreement with the province and the village of Grand Bend to sell the property. There was a separate continuing ownership dispute relating to the harbour at the mouth of the Ausable River.


==Present day==
Grand Bend is home to a variety of stores and eateries. The main strip is the centre of activity in the town, with shopping during the day and night life venues during the evening drawing crowds. The atmosphere of Grand Bend has given the town a reputation of being Florida north. As well as Main Street, Grand Bend acts as a regional cultural centre, boasting art galleries in the town and the Huron Country Playhouse on the outskirts.

The 2021 population of Grand Bend was 3,031. This increases to about 50,000 in the summer months on holiday weekends. The demographic population of Grand Bend is quite diverse. Families owning vacation homes in the adjacent communities of Oakwood Park, Southcott Pines and Beach O&#x27; Pines, are from Ontario, Michigan and as far as New York, Florida, Texas and the American west coast. Among these are the Romney family.

The town as well serves as the backdrop of the docu-drama MTV Show &quot;Grand Benders&quot;, filmed from 2011 to the present and produced by MDF Productions.

The Pinery Provincial Park and the Lambton Heritage Museum are located seven kilometres south of Grand Bend. Also, in the vicinity one can explore a number of &#x27;Gems of Nature&#x27; accessible by marked and maintained hiking trails.

Grand Bend Motorplex has a dragstrip that hosts an International Hot Rod Association race and the IHRA Canadian Nationals, Canada&#x27;s longest running and largest drag race.

<doc id="865449" wikidata="Q4792955" url="?curid=865449" title="Armed Audio Warfare">
<text>Armed Audio Warfare is the second full-length release and first compilation of electronic music group Meat Beat Manifesto. It was originally scheduled as the group&#x27;s first album for release in May 1988, but the master tapes were damaged in a fire, necessitating the rewriting and recording of the material, which was released as &quot;Storm the Studio&quot;. &quot;Armed Audio Warfare&quot; is actually a compilation of unreleased and rare tracks that give an insight as to how that first album may have sounded had it been released as planned.

== Composition and background ==
The album contains rare tracks from, or related to, various releases of the band from its inception to late 1988. According to the liner notes, &quot;Genocide&quot; is a &quot;burnt&quot; remix of &quot;God O.D.&quot;, recorded in December 1988. The song is composed of part of the lyrics from &quot;God O.D.&quot; but with darker, more industrial instrumentation and a lack of sampling. &quot;Repulsion&quot; is a track previously released on a compilation by Sweatbox, the band&#x27;s first record label, in May 1988. &quot;Mister President&quot; is a previously unreleased, sample-heavy track recorded in February 1988 with a notable clip from the introduction of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Previous Record&quot;. The fourth track, &quot;Reanimator&quot;, contains significant dub influences. It was to be released as part of the &quot;Re-Animator&quot; single in August 1988, but the single never had a commercial release.

Tracks 5, 6, and 7 are part of the band&#x27;s first release, the November 1987 &quot;Suck Hard&quot; EP, as an A-side and two B-sides, respectively. On almost all releases of &quot;Armed Audio Warfare&quot;, there is a misprint that inverts the titles of tracks 6 and 7. &quot;Kneel and Buzz&quot; has a raw, live sound, plus samples from the communications of the Apollo 11 mission. The title itself is a pun on the names of astronauts Neil (Armstrong) and Buzz (Aldrin). &quot;Fear Version&quot; is a very short, yet intense track recorded in January 1988 that was intended to be on the &quot;Suck Hard&quot; CD reissue, but the single was subsequently never released in that format. &quot;Give Your Body Its Freedom&quot; is cited, in the liner notes, as the original version of the track &quot;Strap Down (Roar of the Underground)&quot;, from the June 1988 single &quot;Strap Down&quot;. The lengthy song contains live vocals, heavy sampling and distinct sections, including a rather intense buildup and climax contrasted with a calm final minute.

The tenth track, &quot;Marrs Needs Women&quot;, is the first of two tracks added to the CD reissue of &quot;Armed Audio Warfare&quot;. It is an extended version of the B-side &quot;Mars Needs Women&quot; from the November 1988 &quot;God O.D.&quot; single. It has a funk-oriented sound, along with samples from the films &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; and &quot;Mars Needs Women&quot;. The eleventh and final song, &quot;Cutman&quot;, is a previously unreleased track, with five distinct parts, densely layered samples and soul, jazz and hip-hop influences.

# &quot;Genocide&quot; – 5:17
# &quot;Repulsion&quot; – 3:23
# &quot;Mister President&quot; – 5:58
# &quot;Reanimator&quot; – 4:10

<doc id="865452" wikidata="Q932410" url="?curid=865452" title="Session (computer science)">
<text>In computer science and networking in particular, a session is a time-delimited two-way link, a practical (relatively high) layer in the TCP/IP protocol enabling interactive expression and information exchange between two or more communication devices or ends – be they computers, automated systems, or live active users (see login session). A session is established at a certain point in time, and then ‘torn down’ - brought to an end - at some later point. An established communication session may involve more than one message in each direction. A session is typically stateful, meaning that at least one of the communicating parties needs to hold current state information and save information about the session history to be able to communicate, as opposed to stateless communication, where the communication consists of independent requests with responses.

An established session is the basic requirement to perform a connection-oriented communication. A session also is the basic step to transmit in connectionless communication modes. However, any unidirectional transmission does not define a session.

Communication Transport may be implemented as part of protocols and services at the application layer, at the session layer or at the transport layer in the OSI model.
* Application layer examples:
** HTTP sessions, which allow associating information with individual visitors
** A telnet remote login session
* Session layer example:
** A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based Internet phone call
* Transport layer example:
** A TCP session, which is synonymous to a TCP virtual circuit, a TCP connection, or an established TCP socket.

In the case of transport protocols that do not implement a formal session layer (e.g., UDP) or where sessions at the application layer are generally very short-lived (e.g., HTTP), sessions are maintained by a higher level program using a method defined in the data being exchanged. For example, an HTTP exchange between a browser and a remote host may include an HTTP cookie which identifies state, such as a unique session ID, information about the user&#x27;s preferences or authorization level.

HTTP/1.0 was thought to only allow a single request and response during one Web/HTTP Session. Protocol version HTTP/1.1 improved this by completing the Common Gateway Interface (CGI), making it easier to maintain the Web Session and supporting HTTP cookies and file uploads.

Most client-server sessions are maintained by the transport layer - a single connection for a single session. However each transaction phase of a Web/HTTP session creates a separate connection. Maintaining session continuity between phases requires a session ID. The session ID is embedded within the &lt;A HREF&gt; or &lt;FORM&gt; links of dynamic web pages so that it is passed back to the CGI. CGI then uses the session ID to ensure session continuity between transaction phases. One advantage of one connection-per-phase is that it works well over low bandwidth (modem) connections.

== Software implementation ==
TCP sessions are typically implemented in software using child processes and/or multithreading, where a new process or thread is created when the computer establishes or joins a session. HTTP sessions are typically not implemented using one thread per session, but by means of a database with information about the state of each session. The advantage with multiple processes or threads is relaxed complexity of the software, since each thread is an instance with its own history and encapsulated variables. The disadvantage is large overhead in terms of system resources, and that the session may be interrupted if the system is restarted.

When a client may connect to any server in a cluster of servers, a special problem is encountered in maintaining consistency when the servers must maintain session state. The client must either be directed to the same server for the duration of the session, or the servers must transmit server-side session information via a shared file system or database. Otherwise, the client may reconnect to a different server than the one it started the session with, which will cause problems when the new server does not have access to the stored state of the old one.

== Server-side web sessions ==

Server-side sessions are handy and efficient, but can become difficult to handle in conjunction with load-balancing/high-availability systems and are not usable at all in some embedded systems with no storage. The load-balancing problem can be solved by using shared storage or by applying forced peering between each client and a single server in the cluster, although this can compromise system efficiency and load distribution.

A method of using server-side sessions in systems without mass-storage is to reserve a portion of RAM for storage of session data. This method is applicable for servers with a limited number of clients (e.g. router or access point with infrequent or disallowed access to more than one client at a time).

== Client-side web sessions ==

Client-side sessions use cookies and cryptographic techniques to maintain state without storing as much data on the server. When presenting a dynamic web page, the server sends the current state data to the client (web browser) in the form of a cookie. The client saves the cookie in memory or on disk. With each successive request, the client sends the cookie back to the server, and the server uses the data to &quot;remember&quot; the state of the application for that specific client and generate an appropriate response.

This mechanism may work well in some contexts; however, data stored on the client is vulnerable to tampering by the user or by software that has access to the client computer. To use client-side sessions where confidentiality and integrity are required, the following must be guaranteed:
# Confidentiality: Nothing apart from the server should be able to interpret session data.
# Data integrity: Nothing apart from the server should manipulate session data (accidentally or maliciously).
# Authenticity: Nothing apart from the server should be able to initiate valid sessions.

To accomplish this, the server needs to encrypt the session data before sending it to the client, and modification of such information by any other party should be prevented via cryptographic means.

Transmitting state back and forth with every request is only practical when the size of the cookie is small. In essence, client-side sessions trade server disk space for the extra bandwidth that each web request will require. Moreover, web browsers limit the number and size of cookies that may be stored by a web site. To improve efficiency and allow for more session data, the server may compress the data before creating the cookie, decompressing it later when the cookie is returned by the client.

== HTTP session token ==

A session token is a unique identifier that is generated and sent from a server to a client to identify the current interaction session. The client usually stores and sends the token as an HTTP cookie and/or sends it as a parameter in GET or POST queries. The reason to use session tokens is that the client only has to handle the identifier—all session data is stored on the server (usually in a database, to which the client does not have direct access) linked to that identifier. Examples of the names that some programming languages use when naming their HTTP cookie include JSESSIONID (JSP), PHPSESSID (PHP), CGISESSID (CGI), and ASPSESSIONID (ASP).

== Session management ==

In human–computer interaction, session management is the process of keeping track of a user&#x27;s activity across sessions of interaction with the computer system.

Typical session management tasks in a desktop environment include keeping track of which applications are open and which documents each application has opened, so that the same state can be restored when the user logs out and logs in later. For a website, session management might involve requiring the user to re-login if the session has expired (i.e., a certain time limit has passed without user activity). It is also used to store information on the server-side between HTTP requests.

=== Desktop session management ===

A desktop session manager is a program that can save and restore desktop sessions. A desktop session is all the windows currently running and their current content. Session management on Linux-based systems is provided by X session manager. On Microsoft Windows systems, session management is provided by the Session Manager Subsystem (smss.exe); user session functionality can be extended by third-party applications like twinsplay.

=== Browser session management ===

Session management is particularly useful in a web browser where a user can save all open pages and settings and restore them at a later date or on a different computer (see data portability).

To help recover from a system or application crash, pages and settings can also be restored on next run. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, OmniWeb and Opera are examples of web browsers that support session management. Session management is often managed through the application of cookies.

=== Web server session management ===

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is stateless. Session management is the technique used by the web developer to make the stateless HTTP protocol support session state. For example, once a user has been authenticated to the web server, the user&#x27;s next HTTP request (GET or POST) should not cause the web server to ask for the user&#x27;s account and password again. For a discussion of the methods used to accomplish this see HTTP cookie and Session ID

In situations where multiple web servers must share knowledge of session state (as is typical in a cluster environment) session information must be shared between the cluster nodes that are running web server software. Methods for sharing session state between nodes in a cluster include: multicasting session information to member nodes (see JGroups for one example of this technique), sharing session information with a partner node using distributed shared memory or memory virtualization, sharing session information between nodes using network sockets, storing session information on a shared file system such as a distributed file system or a global file system, or storing the session information outside the cluster in a database.
If session information is considered transient, volatile data that is not required for non-repudiation of transactions and does not contain data that is subject to compliance auditing (in the U.S. for example, see the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Sarbanes–Oxley Act for examples of two laws that necessitate compliance auditing) then any method of storing session information can be used. However, if session information is subject to audit compliance, consideration should be given to the method used for session storage, replication, and clustering.

In a service-oriented architecture, Simple Object Access Protocol or SOAP messages constructed with Extensible Markup Language (XML) messages can be used by consumer applications to cause web servers to create sessions.

=== Session management over SMS ===

Just as HTTP is a stateless protocol, so is SMS. As SMS became interoperable across rival networks in 1999, and text messaging started its ascent towards becoming a ubiquitous global form of communication, various enterprises became interested in using the SMS channel for commercial purposes. Initial services did not require session management since they were only one-way communications (for example, in 2000, the first mobile news service was delivered via SMS in Finland). Today, these applications are referred to as application-to-peer (A2P) messaging as distinct from peer-to-peer (P2P) messaging. The development of interactive enterprise applications required session management, but because SMS is a stateless protocol as defined by the GSM standards, early implementations were controlled client-side by having the end-users enter commands and service identifiers manually.

<doc id="865458" wikidata="Q1147749" url="?curid=865458" title="Kun'yomi">
<text>is the way of reading kanji characters using the native Japanese word that matches the meaning of the Chinese character when it was introduced. This pronunciation is contrasted with &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot;, which is the reading based on the original Chinese pronunciation of the character.

Generally, &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; readings are used for simple, singular words, including most verbs, while &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; readings are used for compound, technical words.

== Characteristics ==
&quot;Kun&#x27;yomi&quot; are characterized by the strict (C)V syllable structure of Japanese words (&quot;yamato kotoba&quot;). Most noun or adjective &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; are two to three syllables long, while verb &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; are usually between one and three syllables in length, not counting trailing hiragana called &quot;okurigana&quot;. &quot;Okurigana&quot; are not considered to be part of the internal reading of the character, although they are part of the reading of the word. A beginner in the language will rarely come across characters with long readings, but readings of three or even four syllables are not uncommon. This contrasts with &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot;, which are only one or two syllables, as they were adapted from Chinese characters, which are almost all monosyllabic.

As with &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot;, there can be multiple &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; for the same kanji, and some kanji have no &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; at all. For instance, the character for east, , has &quot;tō&quot; as its &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot;, from Middle Chinese &quot;&quot;. However, Japanese already had two words for &quot;east&quot;: &quot;higashi&quot; and &quot;azuma&quot;. Thus the kanji had the latter readings added as &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot;. In contrast, the kanji , denoting a Chinese unit of measurement (about 30 mm or 1.2 inch), has no native Japanese equivalent; it only has an &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot;, &quot;sun&quot;, with no native &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot;.

== Usage == 

In a number of cases, multiple kanji were assigned to cover a single Japanese word. Typically when this occurs, the different kanji refer to specific shades of meaning. For instance, the word , &quot;naosu&quot;, when written , means &quot;to heal an illness or sickness&quot;. When written it means &quot;to fix or correct something&quot;. Sometimes the distinction is very clear, although not always. Differences of opinion among reference works are not uncommon; one dictionary may say the kanji are equivalent, while another dictionary may draw distinctions of use. As a result, native speakers of the language may have trouble knowing which kanji to use and resort to personal preference or by writing the word in hiragana. This latter strategy is frequently employed with more complex cases such as もと &quot;moto&quot;, which has at least five different kanji: , and , the first three of which have only very subtle differences. Another notable example is &quot;sakazuki&quot; &quot;sake cup&quot;, which may be spelt as at least five different kanji: , and ; of these, the first two are common—formally is a small cup and a large cup.

Local dialectical readings of kanji are also classified under &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot;, most notably readings for words in Ryukyuan languages. Further, in rare cases gairaigo (borrowed words) have a single character associated with them, in which case this reading is formally classified as a &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot;, because the character is being used for meaning, not sound.

Most &quot;kokuji&quot;, Japanese-created Chinese characters, only have &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot;, although some have back-formed a pseudo-&quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; by analogy with similar characters, such as &quot;dō&quot;, from &quot;dō&quot;, and there are even some, such as &quot;sen&quot; &quot;gland&quot;, that have only an &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot;.

== Examples ==

 &quot;uketamawaru&quot;, &quot;kokorozashi&quot;, and &quot;mikotonori&quot; have five syllables represented by a single kanji, the longest readings in the &quot;jōyō&quot; character set. These unusually long readings are due to a single character representing a compound word:

* is a single character for a compound verb, one component of which has a long reading.
** It has an alternative spelling as &quot;u(ke)-tamawa(ru)&quot;, hence (1+1)+3=5.
** Compare common &quot;u(ke)-tsu(keru)&quot;.
* is a nominalization of the verb which has a long reading &quot;kokoroza(su)&quot;.
** This is due to its being derived from a noun-verb compound, &quot;kokoro-za(su)&quot;.
** The nominalization removes the okurigana, hence increasing the reading by one mora, yielding 4+1=5.
** Compare common &quot;hanashi&quot; 2+1=3, from &quot;hana(su)&quot;.
* is a triple compound.
** It has an alternative spelling &quot;mi-koto-nori&quot;, hence 1+2+2=5.
Further, some Jōyō characters have long non-Jōyō readings (students learn the character, but not the reading), such as &quot;omonpakaru&quot; for .

<text>Batesian mimicry is a form of mimicry where a harmless species has evolved to imitate the warning signals of a harmful species directed at a predator of them both. It is named after the English naturalist Henry Walter Bates, who worked on butterflies in the rainforests of Brazil.

Batesian mimicry is the most commonly known and widely studied of mimicry complexes, such that the word mimicry is often treated as synonymous with Batesian mimicry. There are many other forms however, some very similar in principle, others far separated. It is often contrasted with Müllerian mimicry, a form of mutually beneficial convergence between two or more harmful species. However, because the mimic may have a degree of protection itself, the distinction is not absolute. It can also be contrasted with functionally different forms of mimicry. Perhaps the sharpest contrast here is with aggressive mimicry where a predator or parasite mimics a harmless species, avoiding detection and improving its foraging success.

The imitating species is called the &quot;mimic&quot;, while the imitated species (protected by its toxicity, foul taste or other defenses) is known as the &quot;model&quot;. The predatory species mediating indirect interactions between the mimic and the model is variously known as the &quot;[signal] receiver&quot;, &quot;dupe&quot; or &quot;operator&quot;. By parasitising the honest warning signal of the model, the Batesian mimic gains an advantage, without having to go to the expense of arming itself. The model, on the other hand, is disadvantaged, along with the dupe. If impostors appear in high numbers, positive experiences with the mimic may result in the model being treated as harmless. At higher frequency there is also a stronger selective advantage for the predator to distinguish mimic from model. For this reason, mimics are usually less numerous than models, an instance of frequency-dependent selection. Some mimetic populations have evolved multiple forms (polymorphism), enabling them to mimic several different models and thereby to gain greater protection. Batesian mimicry is not always perfect. A variety of explanations have been proposed for this, including limitations in predators&#x27; cognition.

While visual signals have attracted most study, Batesian mimicry can employ deception of any of the senses; some moths mimic the ultrasound warning signals sent by unpalatable moths to bat predators, constituting auditory Batesian mimicry, while some weakly electric fish appear to mimic the electrolocation signals of strongly electric fish, probably constituting electrical mimicry.

== Historical background ==

Henry Walter Bates (1825–1892) was an English explorer-naturalist who surveyed the Amazon rainforest with Alfred Russel Wallace in 1848. While Wallace returned in 1852, Bates remained for over a decade. Bates&#x27;s field research included collecting almost a hundred species of butterflies from the families Ithomiinae and Heliconiinae, as well as thousands of other insects specimens. In sorting these butterflies into similar groups based on appearance, inconsistencies began to arise. Some appeared superficially similar to others, so much so that even Bates could not tell some species apart based only on wing appearance. However, closer examination of less obvious morphological characters seemed to show that they were not even closely related. Shortly after his return to England, he read a paper on his theory of mimicry at a meeting of the Linnean Society of London on 21 November 1861, which was then published in 1862 as &#x27;Contributions to an Insect Fauna of the Amazon Valley&#x27; in the society&#x27;s &quot;Transactions&quot;. He elaborated on his experiences further in &quot;The Naturalist on the River Amazons&quot;.

Bates put forward the hypothesis that the close resemblance between unrelated species was an antipredator adaptation. He noted that some species showed very striking coloration and flew in a leisurely manner, almost as if taunting predators to eat them. He reasoned that these butterflies were unpalatable to birds and other insectivores, and were thus avoided by them. He extended that logic to forms that closely resembled such protected species and mimicked their warning coloration but not their toxicity.

This naturalistic explanation fitted well with the recent account of evolution by Wallace and Charles Darwin, as outlined in his famous 1859 book &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;. Because the Darwinian explanation required no supernatural forces, it met with considerable criticism from anti-evolutionists, both in academic circles and in the broader social realm.

== Aposematism ==

Most living things have predators and therefore are in a constant evolutionary arms race to develop antipredator adaptations, while the predator adapts to become more efficient at defeating the prey&#x27;s adaptations. Some organisms have evolved to make detection less likely, for example by nocturnality and camouflage. Others have developed chemical defences such as the deadly toxins of certain snakes and wasps, or the noxious scent of the skunk. Such prey often send clear and honest warning signals to their attackers with conspicuous aposematic (warning) patterns. The brightness of such warning signs is correlated with the level of toxicity of the organism.

In Batesian mimicry, the mimic effectively copies the coloration of an aposematic animal, known as the model, to deceive predators into behaving as if it were distasteful. The success of this dishonest display depends on the level of toxicity of the model and the abundance of the model in the geographical area. The more toxic the model is, the more likely it is that the predator will avoid the mimic. The abundance of the model species is also important for the success of the mimic because of frequency-dependent selection. When the model is abundant, mimics with imperfect model patterns or slightly different coloration from the model are still avoided by predators. This is because the predator has a strong incentive to avoid potentially lethal organisms, given the likelihood of encountering one. However, in areas where the model is scarce or locally extinct, mimics are driven to accurate aposematic coloration. This is because predators attack imperfect mimics more readily where there is little chance that they are the model species. Frequency-dependent selection may also have driven Batesian mimics to become polymorphic in rare cases where a single genetic switch controls appearance, as in the swallowtail butterflies (the Papilionidae) such as the pipevine swallowtail, and in the New Zealand stonefly &quot;Zelandoperla fenestrata&quot;.

== Classification and comparisons ==


Batesian mimicry is a case of protective or defensive mimicry, where the mimic does best by avoiding confrontations with the signal receiver. It is a &quot;disjunct&quot; system, which means that all three parties are from different species. An example would be the robber fly &quot;Mallophora bomboides&quot;, which is a Batesian mimic of its bumblebee model and prey, &quot;B. americanorum&quot; (now more commonly known as &quot;Bombus pensylvanicus&quot;), which is noxious to predators due to its sting.

Batesian mimicry stands in contrast to other forms such as aggressive mimicry, where the mimic profits from interactions with the signal receiver. One such case of this is in fireflies, where females of one species mimic the mating signals of another species, deceiving males to come close enough for them to eat. Mimicry sometimes does not involve a predator at all though. Such is the case in &quot;dispersal mimicry&quot;, where the mimic once again benefits from the encounter. For instance, some fungi have their spores dispersed by insects by smelling like carrion. In protective mimicry, the meeting between mimic and dupe is not such a fortuitous occasion for the mimic, and the signals it mimics tend to lower the probability of such an encounter.

A case somewhat similar to Batesian mimicry is that of mimetic weeds, which imitate agricultural crops. In weed or Vavilovian mimicry, the weed survives by having seeds which winnowing machinery identifies as belonging to the crop. Vavilovian mimicry is not Batesian, because humans and crops are not enemies. By contrast, a leaf-mimicking plant, the chameleon vine, employs Batesian mimicry by adapting its leaf shape and colour to match that of its host to deter herbivores from eating its edible leaves.

Another analogous case within a single species has been termed &quot;Browerian mimicry&quot; (after Lincoln P. Brower and Jane Van Zandt Brower). This is a case of automimicry; the model is the same species as its mimic. Equivalent to Batesian mimicry within a single species, it occurs when there is a &quot;palatability spectrum&quot; within a population of harmful prey. For example, monarch (&quot;Danaus plexippus&quot;) caterpillars feed on milkweed species of varying toxicity. Some feed on more toxic plants and store these toxins within themselves. The more palatable caterpillars thus profit from the more toxic members of the same species.

Another important form of protective mimicry is Müllerian mimicry, discovered by and named after the naturalist Fritz Müller. In Müllerian mimicry, both model and mimic are aposematic, so mimicry may be mutual, does not necessarily constitute a bluff or deception and as in the wasps and bees may involve many species in a mimicry ring.

== Imperfect Batesian mimicry ==

In imperfect Batesian mimicry, the mimics do not exactly resemble their models. An example of this is the fly &quot;Spilomyia longicornis&quot;, which mimics vespid wasps. However, it is not a perfect mimic. Wasps have long black antennae and this fly does not. Instead, they wave their front legs above their heads to look like the antennae on the wasps. Many reasons have been suggested for imperfect mimicry.
Imperfect mimics may simply be evolving towards perfection.
They may gain advantage from resembling multiple models at once.
Humans may evaluate mimics differently from actual predators. 
Mimics may confuse predators by resembling both model and nonmimic at the same time (satyric mimicry). 
Kin selection may enforce poor mimicry.
The selective advantage of better mimicry may not outweigh the advantages of other strategies like thermoregulation or camouflage. 
Only certain traits may be required to deceive predators; for example, tests on the sympatry/allopatry border (where the two are in the same area, and where they are not) of the mimic &quot;Lampropeltis elapsoides&quot; and the model &quot;Micrurus fulvius&quot; showed that color proportions in these snakes were important in deceiving predators but that the order of the colored rings was not.

== Plants mimicking ants ==

Batesian mimicry of ants appears to have evolved in certain plants, as a visual anti-herbivory strategy, analogous to a herbivorous insect&#x27;s mimicking a well-defended insect to deter predators. &quot;Passiflora&quot; flowers of at least 22 species, such as &quot;P. incarnata&quot;, have dark dots and stripes on their flowers thought to serve this purpose.

== Acoustic mimicry ==
Predators may identify their prey by sound as well as sight; mimics have accordingly evolved to deceive the hearing of their predators. Bats are nocturnal predators that rely on echolocation to detect their prey. Some potential prey are unpalatable to bats, and produce an ultrasonic aposematic signal, the auditory equivalent of warning coloration. In response to echolocating red bats and big brown bats, tiger moths such as &quot;Cycnia tenera&quot; produce warning sounds. Bats learn to avoid the harmful moths, but similarly avoid other species such as some pyralid moths that produce such warning sounds as well. Acoustic mimicry complexes, both Batesian and Müllerian, may be widespread in the auditory world.

== Electrical mimicry ==

The electric eel, &quot;Electrophorus&quot;, is capable of delivering a powerful electric shock that can stun or kill its prey. Bluntnose knifefishes, &quot;Brachyhypopomus&quot;, create an electric discharge pattern similar to the low voltage electrolocation discharge of the electric eel. This is thought to be Batesian mimicry of the powerfully protected electric eel.

<text>Adam Goldberg (born October 25, 1970) is an American actor. Known for his supporting roles in film and television, Goldberg has appeared in films such as &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; and &quot;Zodiac&quot;. He has also played leading roles in independent films such as &quot;The Hebrew Hammer&quot; and &quot;2 Days in Paris&quot;. His TV appearances include the shows &quot; Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;, &quot; My Name Is Earl&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;Entourage&quot;, &quot;The Jim Gaffigan Show&quot;, &quot;The Unusuals&quot; and his role as hitman Grady Numbers in the first season of &quot;Fargo&quot;. Since 2021 he has starred opposite Queen Latifah on CBS&#x27; &quot;The Equalizer&quot;.

==Early life==
Goldberg is the son of Donna Gable, a psychologist, and Earl Goldberg, a former owner of Goldberg and Solovy Foods, a wholesale food business. His father is Jewish, while his mother is a non-practicing Catholic of German, French, Irish, and a &quot;bit of Mexican&quot; descent.

==Career==

===Film===
Goldberg&#x27;s first major screen role was in the Billy Crystal film &quot;Mr. Saturday Night&quot; (1992). His second major screen role was as Mike Newhouse in Richard Linklater&#x27;s film &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; (1993). His career-making role was arguably that of the tough, wise-cracking infantryman Stanley Mellish in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 1998 film &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. While he played lead characters in &quot;The Hebrew Hammer&quot;, &quot;2 Days in Paris&quot;, and &quot;(Untitled)&quot;, Goldberg is mostly known for his character work in film and television.

Notable roles include Jerry, the undead servant to Christopher Walken&#x27;s Angel Gabriel in the supernatural thriller &quot;The Prophecy&quot;; Sol in &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, opposite Russell Crowe; and Denny in &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;, opposite Denzel Washington. Goldberg has also voice acted in &quot;&quot;, &quot;Homeward Bound II,&quot; and &quot;A Monster in Paris&quot;.

Goldberg appeared extensively in the Flaming Lips documentary &quot;The Fearless Freaks&quot;, and had a supporting role in &quot;Christmas on Mars&quot;, a science fiction film written and directed by Flaming Lips frontman Wayne Coyne. In 1999, he appeared in the Sixpence None The Richer music video &quot;There She Goes&quot;.

Goldberg wrote, produced, directed, and edited the features &quot;Scotch and Milk&quot;, &quot;I Love Your Work&quot;, and &quot;No Way Jose&quot; as well as multiple television projects, notably including the philosophical travelogue &quot;Running with the Bulls&quot; for IFC.

=== Television ===
In 1995, Goldberg appeared in a signature wise-cracking role as delivery boy Leo in the television comedy &quot;Double Rush&quot;. Goldberg then appeared in a three-episode arc in the second season of &quot;Friends&quot; (1996) as Chandler&#x27;s crazy roommate Eddie. He appeared some years later in a nine-episode arc in season two of the &quot;Friends&quot; spinoff show &quot;Joey&quot; as Jimmy, Joey Tribbiani&#x27;s best friend from high school. He also appeared as a main character in the short-lived 2005 Fox series &quot;Head Cases&quot;.

In 1997, he received an exclusive series development deal with ABC.

Goldberg appeared in the short-lived ensemble cop show &quot;The Unusuals&quot;, playing a New York City detective with brain cancer who refuses treatment because of his dislike of doctors. His character was stated as being &quot;sarcastic&quot; and Goldberg had been described as &quot;one of the better reasons to watch.&quot; He subsequently appeared in the short-lived ensemble cop show &quot;NYC 22.&quot;

In 2014, portrayed Mr. Numbers, one half of the hit man team in the first season of FX&#x27;s &quot;Fargo&quot;. This was the second time working with creator Noah Hawley, who had cast Goldberg in 2009&#x27;s &quot;The Unusuals&quot;. He had to learn American Sign Language for the role and began production just a few days after wrapping principal photography on his feature, &quot;No Way Jose.&quot; While shooting &quot;Fargo&quot;, Goldberg was also editing his feature and much of it was assembled in his hotel room in Calgary.

Goldberg played the role of Dave Marks, a struggling comedian and Jim Gaffigan&#x27;s best friend, for two seasons on the TV Land sitcom &quot;The Jim Gaffigan Show&quot;. He shot the pilot during a week off from production on &quot;Fargo&quot;.

In 2017, Goldberg joined the cast of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Taken&quot; as a regular cast member during the show&#x27;s second season. He portrayed Kilroy, an accomplished computer hacker.

In 2019, Goldberg had a supporting role in the cast of CBS&#x27;s &quot;God Friended Me&quot; as technical entrepreneur, Simon Hayes.

In 2020, Goldberg began production on CBS&#x27; &quot;The Equalizer&quot;, a reboot of the original. He played another hacker, this time opposite Queen Latifah.

===Other ventures ===
A multi-instrumentalist and songwriter, Goldberg composed and arranged the music to the film &quot;I Love Your Work&quot; with Steven Drozd of The Flaming Lips as well as scoring his most recent feature, &quot;No Way Jose&quot;, and IFC&#x27;s &quot;Running with the Bulls&quot;. He also provided a song for &quot;The Hebrew Hammer&quot; soundtrack.

Goldberg released his first album, &quot;Eros and Omissions&quot;, under the LANDy moniker. It was released on June 23, 2009. Flaming Lips drummer Steven Drozd, with whom Goldberg collaborated on the score for &quot;I Love Your Work&quot;, performed on the record as well as members of the band The Black Pine. Earlimart&#x27;s Aaron Espinoza is credited as having done the final mix as well as having engineered many of the more recent songs. Goldberg has since changed his musical moniker to The Goldberg Sisters, under which he has made three albums, the last two of which he played every instrument save for strings (provided by his wife Roxanne Daner and musician Merritt Lear) and horns (provided by his engineer and co-producer Andrew Lynch).

On June 7, 2011, Goldberg assembled a live band to perform The Goldberg Sisters single &quot;Shush&quot; on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot;.

Goldberg is also a photographer, shooting primarily on film and expired Polaroid. His first book was co-published by Hat and Beard Press and contained a limited vinyl version of The Goldberg Sisters&#x27; &quot;Home: A Nice Place to Visit&quot;. Subsequent exhibitions of photography from the book also included live performances of Goldberg Sisters songs by Goldberg and Lynch, utilizing several loop and effects pedals. An early adopter of the now-defunct Vine app, Goldberg was known for incorporating many analog film elements into his six-second &quot;films.&quot; He was hired to do forty films for the French cellular company Orange during the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, during which he made a six-second Vine based on each film entered in competition. He is an avid Instagram user; his account consists of much of his photography while also hosting a cinematic narrative of his family life.

==Personal life==
Goldberg has had three children with his wife, artist and designer Roxanne Daner. Their first child together, a son, was stillborn. Their next son was born shortly after, in November 2014. Goldberg and Daner married on Halloween in 2014. They had another son in September 2018.

<doc id="865469" wikidata="Q718498" url="?curid=865469" title="On'yomi">
<text>, or the Sino-Japanese reading, is the reading of a kanji based on the historical Chinese pronunciation of the character. A single kanji might have multiple &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; pronunciations, reflecting the Chinese pronunciations of different periods or regions. &quot;On&#x27;yomi&quot; pronunciations are generally classified into &quot;go-on&quot;, &quot;kan-on&quot;, &quot;tō-on&quot; and &quot;kan&#x27;yō-on&quot;, roughly based on when they were borrowed from China.

Generally, &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; pronunciations are used for technical, compound words, while the native &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; pronunciation is used for singular, simpler words.

== Usage ==
&quot;On&#x27;yomi&quot; primarily occur in , many of which are the result of the adoption, along with the kanji themselves, of Chinese words for concepts that either did not exist in Japanese or could not be articulated as elegantly using native words. This borrowing process is often compared to the English borrowings from Latin, Greek, and Norman French, since Chinese-borrowed terms are often more specialized, or considered to sound more erudite or formal, than their native counterparts (occupying a higher linguistic register). The major exception to this rule is family names, in which the native &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; are usually used (though &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; are found in many personal names, especially men&#x27;s names).

Kanji invented in Japan (kokuji) would not normally be expected to have &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot;, but there are exceptions, such as the character &quot;to work&quot;, which has the &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; &quot;&quot;hatara(ku)&quot; and the &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; &quot;dō&quot;&quot;, and &quot;gland&quot;, which has only the &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; &quot;&quot;sen&quot;—in both cases these come from the &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; of the phonetic component, respectively &quot;dō&quot; and &quot;sen&quot;&quot;.

== Characteristics ==
In Chinese, most characters are associated with a single Chinese sound, though there are distinct literary and colloquial readings. However, some homographs () such as (Mandarin: &#x27; or &#x27;, Japanese: &quot;an, gō, gyō&quot;) have more than one reading in Chinese representing different meanings, which is reflected in the carryover to Japanese as well. Additionally, many Chinese syllables, especially those with an entering tone, did not fit the largely consonant-vowel (CV) phonotactics of classical Japanese. Thus most &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; are composed of two morae (beats), the second of which is either a lengthening of the vowel in the first mora (to &quot;ei&quot;, &quot;ō&quot;, or &quot;ū&quot;), the vowel &quot;i&quot;, or one of the syllables &quot;ku&quot;, &quot;ki&quot;, &quot;tsu&quot;, &quot;chi&quot;, &quot;fu&quot; (historically, later merged into &quot;ō&quot; and &quot;ū&quot;), or moraic &quot;n&quot;, chosen for their approximation to the final consonants of Middle Chinese. It may be that palatalized consonants before vowels other than &quot;i&quot; developed in Japanese as a result of Chinese borrowings, as they are virtually unknown in words of native Japanese origin, but are common in Chinese.

== Classification ==

Generally, &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; are classified into four types according to their region and time of origin:
* readings derive from the pronunciation used in the Northern and Southern dynasties of China during the 5th and 6th centuries, primarily from the speech of the capital Jiankang (today&#x27;s Nanjing). They are related to Wu Chinese and the Shanghainese language.
* readings come from the pronunciation utilized during the Tang dynasty of China in the 7th to 9th centuries, primarily from the standard speech of the capital, Chang&#x27;an (modern Xi&#x27;an). Here, &quot;Kan&quot; refers to Han Chinese people or China proper.
* readings are based on the pronunciations of later dynasties of China, such as the Song and Ming. They cover all readings adopted from the Heian era to the Edo period. This is also known as .
* readings, which are mistaken or changed readings of the kanji that have become accepted into the Japanese language. In some cases, they are the actual readings that accompanied the character&#x27;s introduction to Japan but do not match how the character &quot;should&quot; (is prescribed to) be read according to the rules of character construction and pronunciation.

The most common form of readings is the &quot;kan-on&quot; one, and use of a non-&quot;kan-on&quot; reading in a word where the &quot;kan-on&quot; reading is well known is a common cause of reading mistakes or difficulty, such as in (&quot;go-on&quot;), where is usually instead read as &quot;kai&quot;. The &quot;go-on&quot; readings are especially common in Buddhist terminology such as , as well as in some of the earliest loans, such as the Sino-Japanese numbers. The &quot;tō-on&quot; readings occur in some later words, such as , , and . The &quot;go-on&quot;, &quot;kan-on&quot;, and &quot;tō-on&quot; readings are generally cognate (with rare exceptions of homographs; see below), having a common origin in Old Chinese, and hence form linguistic doublets or triplets, but they can differ significantly from each other and from modern Chinese pronunciation.

<text>Glamaig () is the northernmost of the Red Hills on the Isle of Skye in Scotland. It lies immediately east of Sligachan. It is one of only two Corbetts on Skye.

From many angles the hill resembles a perfect cone of scree, though it is linked to the rest of the Red Hills by way of a bealach, the (Pass of the Scree).

In 1889, a Gurkha named Harkabir Tharpa scaled Glamaig in 37 minutes; his total time for the round trip, starting and finishing at sea level in the bar of the Sligachan Inn was 55 minutes. Legend has it that he ran it in bare feet, and his record stood until the 1980s, despite being attempted by Olympians such as Chris Brasher in the 1950s.

From Sligachan one route of ascent (whether running or hillwalking) is simply to head up the scree aiming for the summit - this climb is very arduous, due to the unrelenting gradient and the slipperiness of the scree. Descent may be made by way of ascent; alternatively one may continue along the Red Cuillin ridge to take in other peaks to the south.

A slightly less arduous (but longer) climb approaches the mountain from its eastern end at Sconser. Climb first to the secondary summit, (The Cockerel), then follow the whaleback ridge to the primary summit, (Mary&#x27;s Peak). Once is reached at , the more-or-less level ridge allows some respite from the gradient, with a gentler ascent of the final to .

From the summit there are excellent views of both the Black Cuillin and the Isle of Raasay.

==Glamaig Hill Race==

Glamaig has been the site of an annual hill race since the 1980s. It begins and finishes at the Sligachan Hotel. While in distance terms a relatively short Category S race covering a distance of 7 km, with 775m of ascent it falls into a Category A climb, and is one of the more challenging races on the Scottish circuit.

<doc id="865479" wikidata="Q715108" url="?curid=865479" title="Dutch book theorems">
<text>In decision theory, economics, and probability theory, the Dutch book arguments are a set of results showing that agents must satisfy the axioms of rational choice to avoid a kind of self-contradiction called a Dutch book. A Dutch book or money pump is a set of bets that ensures a guaranteed loss, i.e. the gambler will lose money no matter what happens. A set of beliefs and preferences is called [[Dutch book theorems|coherent]] if it cannot result in a Dutch book.

The Dutch book arguments are used to explore degrees of certainty in beliefs, and demonstrate that rational agents must be Bayesian; in other words, rationality requires assigning probabilities to events that behave according to the axioms of probability, and having preferences that can be modeled using the von Neumann–Morgenstern axioms.

In economics, they are used to model behavior by ruling out situations where agents &quot;burn money&quot; for no real reward; models based on these assumptions are called rational choice models. These assumptions are weakened in behavioral models of decision-making.

The thought experiment was first proposed by the Italian probabilist Bruno de Finetti in order to justify Bayesian probability, and was more thoroughly explored by Leonard Savage, who developed them into a full model of rational choice.

== Operational subjective probabilities as wagering odds ==
One must set the price of a promise to pay $1 if John Smith wins tomorrow&#x27;s election, and $0 otherwise. One knows that one&#x27;s opponent will be able to choose either to buy such a promise from one at the price one has set, or require one to buy such a promise from them, still at the same price. In other words: Player A sets the odds, but Player B decides which side of the bet to take. The price one sets is the &quot;operational subjective probability&quot; that one assigns to the proposition on which one is betting.

If one decides that John Smith is 12.5% likely to win—an arbitrary valuation—one might then set an odds of 7:1 against. This arbitrary valuation — the &quot;operational subjective probability&quot; — determines the payoff to a successful wager. $1 wagered at these odds will produce either a loss of $1 (if Smith loses) or a win of $7 (if Smith wins). If the $1 is placed in pledge as a condition of the bet, then the $1 will also be returned to the bettor, should the bettor win the bet.

==The arguments==
The standard Dutch book argument concludes that rational agents must have subjective probabilities for random events, and that these probabilities must satisfy the standard axioms of probability. In other words, any rational person must be willing to assign a (quantitative) subjective probability to different events.

Note that the argument does not imply agents are willing to engage in gambling in the traditional sense. The word &quot;bet&quot; as used here refers to any kind of decision under uncertainty. For example, buying an unfamiliar good at a supermarket is a kind of &quot;bet&quot; (the buyer &quot;bets&quot; that the product is good), as is getting into a car (&quot;betting&quot; that the driver will not be involved in an accident). 

=== Establishing willingness to bet ===
The Dutch book argument can be reversed by considering the perspective of the bookmaker. In this case, the Dutch book arguments show that any rational agent must be willing to accept some kinds of risks, i.e. to make uncertain bets, or else they will sometimes refuse &quot;free gifts&quot; or &quot;Czech books&quot;, a series of bets leaving them better-off with 100% certainty. 

=== Unitarity ===
In one example, a bookmaker has offered the following odds and attracted one bet on each horse whose relative sizes make the result irrelevant. The implied probabilities, i.e. probability of each horse winning, add up to a number greater than 1, violating the axiom of unitarity:

Whichever horse wins in this example, the bookmaker will pay out $200 (including returning the winning stake)—but the punter has bet $210, hence making a loss of $10 on the race.

However, if horse 4 was withdrawn and the bookmaker does not adjust the other odds, the implied probabilities would add up to 0.95. In such a case, a gambler could always reap a profit of $10 by betting $100, $50 and $40 on the remaining three horses, respectively, and not having to stake $20 on the withdrawn horse, which now cannot win.

=== Other axioms ===
Other forms of Dutch books can be used to establish the other axioms of probability, sometimes involving more complex bets like forecasting the order in which horses will finish. In Bayesian probability, Frank P. Ramsey and Bruno de Finetti required personal degrees of belief to be coherent so that a Dutch book could not be made against them, whichever way bets were made. Necessary and sufficient conditions for this are that their degrees of belief satisfy all the axioms of probability.

== Dutch books ==
A person who has set prices on an array of wagers, in such a way that he or she will make a net gain regardless of the outcome, is said to have made a &quot;Dutch book&quot;. When one has a Dutch book, one&#x27;s opponent always loses. A person who sets prices in a way that gives his or her opponent a Dutch book is not behaving rationally.

=== A very trivial Dutch book ===
The rules do not forbid a set price higher than $1, but a prudent opponent may sell one a high-priced ticket, such that the opponent comes out ahead regardless of the outcome of the event on which the bet is made. The rules also do not forbid a negative price, but an opponent may extract a paid promise from the bettor to pay him or her later should a certain contingency arise. In either case, the price-setter loses. These lose-lose situations parallel the fact that a probability can neither exceed 1 (certainty) nor be less than 0 (no chance of winning).

=== A more instructive Dutch book ===
Now suppose one sets the price of a promise to pay $1 if the Boston Red Sox win next year&#x27;s World Series, and also the price of a promise to pay $1 if the New York Yankees win, and finally the price of a promise to pay $1 if &quot;either&quot; the Red Sox or the Yankees win. One may set the prices in such a way that

: formula_1

But if one sets the price of the third ticket lower than the sum of the first two tickets, a prudent opponent will buy that ticket and sell the other two tickets to the price-setter. By considering the three possible outcomes (Red Sox, Yankees, some other team), one will note that regardless of which of the three outcomes eventuates, one will lose. An analogous fate awaits if one set the price of the third ticket higher than the sum of the other two prices. This parallels the fact that probabilities of mutually exclusive events are additive (see probability axioms).

== Conditional wagers and conditional probabilities ==
Now imagine a more complicated scenario. One must set the prices of three promises:

* to pay $1 if the Red Sox win tomorrow&#x27;s game: the purchaser of this promise loses their bet if the Red Sox do not win regardless of whether their failure is due to their loss of a completed game or cancellation of the game, and
* to pay $1 if the Red Sox win, and to refund the price of the promise if the game is cancelled, and
* to pay $1 if the game is completed, regardless of who wins.

Three outcomes are possible: The game is cancelled; the game is played and the Red Sox lose; the game is played and the Red Sox win. One may set the prices in such a way that

: formula_2

(where the second price above is that of the bet that includes the refund in case of cancellation). (Note: The prices here are the dimensionless numbers obtained by dividing by $1, which is the payout in all three cases.) A prudent opponent writes three linear inequalities in three variables. The variables are the amounts they will invest in each of the three promises; the value of one of these is negative if they will make the price-setter buy that promise and positive if they will buy it. Each inequality corresponds to one of the three possible outcomes. Each inequality states that your opponent&#x27;s net gain is more than zero. A solution exists if the determinant of the matrix is not zero. That determinant is:

: formula_3

Thus a prudent opponent can make the price setter a sure loser unless one sets one&#x27;s prices in a way that parallels the simplest conventional characterization of conditional probability.

== Another example ==
In the 2015 running of the Kentucky Derby, the favorite (&quot;American Pharaoh&quot;) was set ante-post at 5:2, the second favorite at 3:1, and the third favorite at 8:1. All other horses had odds against of 12:1 or higher. With these odds, a wager of $10 on each of all 18 starters would result in a net loss if either the favorite or the second favorite were to win.

However, if one assumes that no horse quoted 12:1 or higher will win, and one bets $10 on each of the top three, one is guaranteed at least a small win. The favorite (who did win) would result in a payout of $25, plus the returned $10 wager, giving an ending balance of $35 (a $5 net increase). A win by the second favorite would produce a payoff of $30 plus the original $10 wager, for a net $10 increase. A win by the third favorite gives $80 plus the original $10, for a net increase of $60.

This sort of strategy, so far as it concerns just the top three, forms a Dutch Book. However, if one considers all eighteen contenders, then no Dutch Book exists for this race.

==Economics==

In economics, the classic example of a situation in which a consumer X can be Dutch-booked is if they have intransitive preferences. Classical economic theory assumes that preferences are transitive: if someone thinks A is better than B and B is better than C, then they must think A is better than C. Moreover, there cannot be any &quot;cycles&quot; of preferences.

The money pump argument notes that if someone held a set of intransitive preferences, they could be exploited (pumped) for money until being forced to exit the market. Imagine Jane has twenty dollars to buy fruit. She can fill her basket with either oranges or apples. Jane would prefer to have a dollar rather than an apple, an apple rather than an orange, and an orange rather than a dollar. Because Jane would rather have an orange than a dollar, she is willing to buy an orange for just over a dollar (perhaps $1.10). Then, she trades her orange for an apple, because she would rather have an apple than an orange. Finally, she sells her apple for a dollar, because she would rather have a dollar than an apple. At this point, Jane is left with $19.90, and has lost 10¢ and gained nothing in return. This process can be repeated until Jane is left with no money. (Note that, if Jane truly holds these preferences, she would see nothing wrong with this process; at every step, Jane agrees she has been left better off.) After running out of money, Jane must exit the market, and her preferences and actions cease to be economically relevant.

Experiments in behavioral economics show that subjects can violate the requirement for transitive preferences when comparing bets. However, most subjects do not make these choices in within-subject comparisons where the contradiction is made obviously visible (in other words, the subjects do not hold genuinely intransitive preferences, but instead make mistakes when making choices using heuristics).

Economists usually argue that people with preferences like X&#x27;s will have all their wealth taken from them in the market. If this is the case, we won&#x27;t observe preferences with intransitivities or other features that allow people to be Dutch-booked. However, if people are somewhat sophisticated about their intransitivities and/or if competition by arbitrageurs drives epsilon to zero, non-&quot;standard&quot; preferences may still be observable.

== Coherence ==
It can be shown that the set of prices is coherent when they satisfy the probability axioms and related results such as the inclusion–exclusion principle.

<doc id="865481" wikidata="Q199251" url="?curid=865481" title="Spermophilus">
<text>Spermophilus is a genus of ground squirrels in the squirrel family. As traditionally defined the genus was very species-rich, ranging through Europe, Asia and North America, but this arrangement was found to be paraphyletic to the certainly distinct prairie dogs, marmots, and antelope squirrels. As a consequence, all the former &quot;Spermophilus&quot; species of North America have been moved to other genera, leaving the European and Asian species as true &quot;Spermophilus&quot; (the only exceptions are two Asian &quot;Urocitellus&quot;).

Some species are sometimes called susliks (or sousliks). This name comes from Russian суслик, &quot;suslik&quot;. In some languages, a derivative of the name is in common usage, for example &quot;suseł&quot; in Polish. The scientific name of this genus means &quot;seed-lovers&quot; (gr. σπέρμα &quot;sperma&quot;, genitive σπέρματος &quot;spermatos&quot; – seed; φίλος &quot;philos&quot; – friend, lover).

==Habitat and behavior==
As typical ground squirrels, &quot;Spermophilus&quot; live in open habitats like grasslands, meadows, steppe and semideserts, feed on the low plants, and use burrows as nests and refuge. They are diurnal and mostly live in colonies, although some species also can occur singly. They are found in both lowlands to highlands, hibernate during the colder months (up to 8 months each year in some species) and in arid regions they may also aestivate during the summer or fall. The distributions of the various species are mostly separated, often by large rivers, although there are regions inhabited by as many as three species and rarely two species may even form mixed colonies. A few species are known to hybridize where their ranges come into contact.

==Appearance==
&quot;Spermophilus&quot; are overall yellowish, light orangish, light brownish or greyish. Although many are inconspicuously mottled or spotted, or have orange markings on the head, overall they lack strong patterns, except in &quot;S. suslicus&quot;, which commonly has brown upperparts with clear white spotting. Size varies with species and they have a head-and-body length of . Before hibernation the largest &quot;S. fulvus&quot; may weigh up to and the largest &quot;S. major&quot; up to almost , but they always weigh much less earlier in the year and other species are considerably smaller, mostly less than even in peak condition before hibernation. All have a fairly short tail that—depending on exact species—is around 10–45% of the length of the head-and-body.

==Relationship with humans==
Ground squirrels may carry fleas that transmit diseases to humans (see Black Death), and have been destructive in tunneling underneath human habitation.

== Species ==
A generic revision was undertaken in 2007 by means of phylogenetic analyses using the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b. This resulted in the splitting of &quot;Spermophilus&quot; into eight genera, which with the prairie dogs, marmots, and antelope squirrels are each given as numbered clades. The exact relations between the clades are slightly unclear. Among these, the exclusively Palearctic species are retained as the genus &quot;Spermophilus sensu stricto&quot; (in the strictest sense). According to a 2024 genetic study the genus can be divided into four major clades that diverged during the Late Miocene.
* &quot;Spermophilus sensu stricto&quot;, Old World ground squirrels
:East Asian clade
:* Alashan ground squirrel, &quot;Spermophilus alashanicus&quot;
:* Daurian ground squirrel, &quot;Spermophilus dauricus&quot; 
:Asia Minor/European clade
:* European ground squirrel, &quot;Spermophilus citellus&quot;
:* Podolian souslik &quot;(Spermophilus odessanus&quot;)
:* Speckled ground squirrel, &quot;Spermophilus suslicus&quot;
:* Taurus ground squirrel, &quot;Spermophilus taurensis&quot;
:* Asia Minor ground squirrel, &quot;Spermophilus xanthoprymnus&quot; 
:&quot;Pygmaeus&quot;-clade
:* Caucasian Mountain ground squirrel, &quot;Spermophilus musicus&quot;
:* Little ground squirrel, &quot;Spermophilus pygmaeus&quot;
:&quot;Colobotis&quot;-clade
:* Brandt&#x27;s ground squirrel, &quot;Spermophilus brevicauda&quot;
:* Red-cheeked ground squirrel, &quot;Spermophilus erythrogenys&quot;
:* Yellow ground squirrel, &quot;Spermophilus fulvus&quot;
:* Russet ground squirrel, &quot;Spermophilus major&quot;
:* Pallid ground squirrel, &quot;Spermophilus pallidicauda&quot;
:* &quot;Spermophilus ralli&quot;
:* Relict ground squirrel, &quot;Spermophilus relictus&quot;
:* &quot;Spermophilus selevinus&quot;
:* &quot;Spermophilus vorontsovi&quot;

===Prehistoric species===
Discovery and examination of one of the best preserved Eurasian ground squirrel fossils yet recovered allowed the study of many previously unknown aspects of ground squirrel cranial anatomy, and prompted a critical reassessment of their phylogenetic position. As a result, three Pleistocene species previously considered members of the &quot;Urocitellus&quot; genus were moved to &quot;Spermophilus&quot;:

:* †&quot;Spermophilus nogaici&quot;
:* †&quot;Spermophilus polonicus&quot;
:* †&quot;Spermophilus primigenius&quot;
In addition to the recent species, three now-extinct species are known from the Pleistocene of Europe:

&quot;Spermophilus citelloides&quot; is known from the Middle Pleistocene to early Holocene of central Europe. It appears to be most closely related to the living &quot;S. suslicus&quot;.

&quot;Spermophilus severskensis&quot; is known from the late Pleistocene (Weichselian) of the Desna area, Ukraine. It appears to have been a highly specialised grazer and close relative of the living &quot;S. pygmaeus&quot;.

&quot;Spermophilus superciliosus&quot; is known from the Middle Pleistocene to reportedly the early 20th century, with a vast range across much of Europe, from southern England to the Volga and the Ural Mountains. It was similar in size to the recent &quot;S. major&quot;, and a probable ancestor of &quot;S. fulvus&quot;.

<doc id="865486" wikidata="Q756968" url="?curid=865486" title="Alexandre Exquemelin">
<text>Alexandre Olivier Exquemelin (also spelled &quot;Esquemeling&quot;, &quot;Exquemeling&quot;, or &quot;Oexmelin&quot;) (c. 1645–1707) was a French, Dutch, or Flemish writer best known as the author of one of the most important sourcebooks of 17th-century piracy, first published in Dutch as &quot;De Americaensche Zee-Roovers&quot;, in Amsterdam, by Jan ten Hoorn, in 1678.

== Life ==
Born about 1645, it is likely that Exquemelin was a native of Honfleur, France, who on his return from buccaneering settled in Holland, possibly because he was a Huguenot. In 1666 he was engaged by the French West India Company and went to Tortuga, where he worked as an indentured servant for three years. There he enlisted with the buccaneers, in particular with the band of Henry Morgan, whose confidante he was, probably as a barber-surgeon, and remained with them until 1674. Shortly afterwards he returned to Europe and settled in Amsterdam where he qualified professionally as a surgeon, his name appearing on the 1679 register of the Dutch Surgeons&#x27; Guild. However, he was later once again in the Caribbean as his name appears on the muster-roll as a surgeon in the attack on Cartagena in 1697.

The bibliographic legacy of Exquemelin&#x27;s &quot;History of the Buccaneers of America&quot; is complex. It was first published in Dutch (1678), then translated into German (1679), Spanish (1681) and English (1684). The German translation is a faithful translation of the original Dutch. The Spanish translation adds new material quite freely and without acknowledgment, and mistranslates the Dutch frequently, while the English translation appears to be as much a translation of the Spanish edition, including most of its deviations from the Dutch original. The French translation of 1686 is substantially a new work with many additions, including new pirate biographies (Daniel Montbars and Alexandre Bras-de-Fer) and complete rearrangements in some sections incorporating new material of unknown source. Subsequent editions and translations added additional new material and whole biographies.

Following publication of the English translation in 1684, Henry Morgan took steps to discredit the book and successfully brought a libel suit against the book&#x27;s publishers William Crooke and Thomas Malthus. Morgan particularly objected to the description of the capture of the third castle at Portobello in 1668 where the book said he had ordered the construction of ladders wide enough for three men to climb abreast; when they were completed he &quot;commanded all the religious men and women whom he had taken prisoners to fix them against the walls of the castle ... these were forced, at the head of the companies to raise and apply them to the walls ... Thus many of the religious men and nuns were killed&quot;. In Morgan&#x27;s affidavit he stated that he had &quot;against evil deeds, piracies and robberies the greatest abhorrence and distrust&quot;, and that &quot;for the kind of men called buccaneers&quot;, he &quot;always had and still has hatred&quot;. The court found in his favour and the book was retracted; damages of £200 were paid to him. The passage about the use of nuns and monks as a human shield was retracted from subsequent publications in England.

For a comparison of the 1678 Dutch edition and the 1686 French translation, see the 1974 translation and interpretation by the Danish author and historian Erik Kjærsgaard. For a contemporary reprinting, see Esquemeling, Alexander O., &quot;The Buccaneers of America. A true account of the most remarkable assaults committed of late years upon the coasts of West Indies by the Buccaneers of Jamaica and Tortuga&quot; (both English and French), containing also Basil Ringrose’s account of the dangerous voyage and bold assaults of Captain Bartholomew Sharp and others. Peter Benchley, in his book &quot;The Island&quot;, referred to Exquemelin at length, having used his work in his research.

Like a number of other ground squirrels, they are sometimes called prairie dogs or gophers, though the latter name belongs more strictly to the pocket gophers of family Geomyidae, and the former to members of the genus &quot;Cynomys&quot;.

==Taxonomy==

This squirrel was named after the Scottish naturalist Sir John Richardson. North Dakota is nicknamed the Flickertail state after the squirrel. The nickname Dakrat is derived from &quot;Dakota Rat&quot; and is a commonly used name around Minot, North Dakota and on Minot Air Force Base.

==Habitat==
Native to the short grass prairies, Richardson&#x27;s ground squirrel is found mainly in the northern states of the United States, such as North Dakota and Montana, and in western Canada, including central and southern Alberta, southern Saskatchewan, and southern Manitoba. The range of this animal expanded as forests were cleared to create farmland. They are not simply restricted to prairie; sometimes they adapt to suburban environments, causing them to be seen as pests because of the burrows they dig. It is not unusual to find squirrels digging tunnels under the sidewalks and patios of urban homes.

==Description==
Typical adults are about long. Weights vary greatly with time of year and with location: at emergence from hibernation the squirrels weigh between for females and between for males. But by the time they hibernate again, their weight may have risen to nearly . Males are slightly larger and heavier than females on average. They are dark brown on the upper side and tan underneath. The tail is shorter and less bushy than in other ground squirrels, and the external ears are so short as to look more like holes in the animal&#x27;s head. Behavior is more like that of a prairie dog than a typical ground squirrel. The tail is constantly trembling, so the animal is sometimes called the &quot;flickertail&quot;.

Males have an average life expectancy of 3 years, while females average 4 years. However, in captivity some individuals may live for 5 to 7 years.

==Behavior==

Richardson&#x27;s ground squirrels appear to live communally, but they organize their social structure around female kinship. A female Richardson&#x27;s ground squirrel will tolerate the presence of closely related females, but are territorial towards other individuals. Individuals are territorial around their nest sites. The burrows of Richardson&#x27;s ground squirrels are grouped closely together in colonies, and individuals give audible alarm calls when possible predators approach. Recent research has shown that in some cases, ultrasonic alarm calls are given, and are responded to by other members of the colony. Richardson&#x27;s ground squirrels use two audible alarm calls, a high-pitched whistle and a &#x27;chirp&#x27; call. The whistle is given in response to terrestrial predators, while the chirp is given in response to aerial predators such as hawks.

Predators include hawks, owls, snakes, weasels, American badgers and coyotes.

===Feeding===
These animals are omnivores, eating seeds, nuts, grains, grasses and insects (especially crickets, caterpillars and grasshoppers). They stuff their cheek pouches with seeds, which are stored in the burrow and likely eaten in spring. They are also reported to cannibalize ground squirrels killed by road traffic.

===Hibernation===
Adult ground squirrels may hibernate as early as July, though in their first year, the young ground squirrels do not hibernate until September. The males emerge from hibernation in March, and establish territories before the females emerge a couple of weeks later. Abandoned burrows are sometimes taken over by other grassland species such as the burrowing owl.

===Reproduction===
Female Richardson&#x27;s ground squirrels produce one litter per year. Litter size averages 6, though the maximum size recorded is 14. The young are born in April or May. Young ground squirrels remain underground in the burrow until they are approximately 30 days old, emerging from natal burrows late May to mid-June. At emergence, the young weigh 50 to 100 grams.

==Relationship with humans==

Because they will readily eat crop species, Richardson&#x27;s ground squirrels are sometimes considered to be agricultural pests, although this is not their legal status in all jurisdictions. The government of Saskatchewan declared the animals pests in 2010, allowing local governments to employ gopher control measures. In areas with few natural predators, overpopulation and increasing density can drive ground squirrels to expand into suburban neighborhoods.

===Control measures===
Farmers and ranchers have developed a variety of ways to exterminate ground squirrels besides trapping, shooting and poisoning. One such process fills the burrows with a mixture of oxygen and propane and then ignites the gas mixture. This kills the ground squirrels with a concussive force that also collapses the tunnel systems. Even if effective, ground squirrels from outside of the treated areas will eventually spread back into the area.

The Saskatoon Wildlife Federation sponsored a 12-week &quot;gopher derby&quot; in 2002, in an effort to reduce what it considered an overpopulation of the squirrels. Cash prizes were awarded for the most number of animals killed, with the animals&#x27; tails being presented as proof of the kill. The Canadian Humane Society called the contest cruel and barbaric. Despite the criticism, the derby was repeated in 2003. By 2004, the ground squirrel population had dropped and the contest was cancelled.

The Gopher Hole Museum in Torrington, Alberta, Canada, has a large selection of stuffed ground squirrels of many varieties and colors.

===Pet trade===
The Richardson&#x27;s ground squirrel in recent years has become popular in the exotic pet trade.

<doc id="865497" wikidata="Q52734097" url="?curid=865497" title="Blood Gulch">
<text>Blood Gulch is a multiplayer map in the first-person shooter &quot;Halo&quot; video game series. It first appeared in &quot;&quot;, and was remade for &quot;Halo 2&quot; as &quot;Coagulation&quot;, as well as for &quot;&quot; as &quot;Hemorrhage&quot; and &quot;&quot; as &quot;Bloodline&quot;. It also had spiritual successors in &quot;Halo 3&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Valhalla&quot;, in &quot;Halo 4&quot; and &quot;Halo Wars&quot; as &quot;Ragnarok&quot;, and in &quot;Halo 5&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Basin&quot;. Taking place in a canyon on the Halo ringworld that resembles the American Southwest, it was designed for the capture the flag game mode but can also be used for other modes, such as deathmatch. Blood Gulch was one of &quot;Halo&quot;&#x27;s most critically acclaimed and influential multiplayer maps, and played a significant role in the machinima series &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot;.

== Level content ==
Blood Gulch takes place in a box canyon on a Halo ring that is enclosed on all sides by high natural walls. The canyon&#x27;s interior is a &quot;vast expanse of undulating landscape and scattered pieces of natural cover&quot;, with a base on each end for the Red and Blue teams. The map is balanced but asymmetrical in terms of tactical advantage, with the Red team having access to a ridge, while the Blue team is located near a tunnel system in the canyon wall. Each base is conducive to traditional FPS gameplay, with &quot;two entrances, an open ceiling, and sloping paths to the roof&quot;. On top of each base, a teleporter can transport players (from either team) to the midst of the valley&#x27;s no man&#x27;s land, leaving them vulnerable to snipers. Warthog jeeps can easily traverse the landscape, making them ideal for escaping with the flag. In the &quot;Halo 2 &quot;variant of the map, each base has a third, below ground level, in which a Banshee can be found. When playing the gamemode “Rocket Slayer”, the Warthogs are replaced with Scorpion tanks.

== Development ==
Jaime Griesemer, the designer of &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot;, stated that the design of Blood Gulch was responsible for the Scorpion tank remaining in the game, saying that the developers wanted to remove it, as it was not used in the game&#x27;s campaign mode enough, but found it fun enough to drive around Blood Gulch that it was left in the game. He also stated that the game&#x27;s sniper rifle was given a scope due to the distance between Blood Gulch&#x27;s two bases.

== Reception ==
Wes Fenlon from &quot;PC Gamer&quot; opined that &quot;if there&#x27;s anything truly and utterly timeless about Halo, it&#x27;s that voice playing over the warm blue sky and dusty fields of Blood Gulch&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s Ryan McCaffrey consider Coagulation, the &quot;Halo 2&quot; iteration of Blood Gulch, to be the &quot;Halo&quot; series&#x27; arguably most famous map, &quot;the boxed desert canyon that&#x27;s been home to countless CTF matches and &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; episodes&quot;. &quot;Edge&quot; called the map a &quot;showcase&quot; for &quot;Halo&quot;&#x27;s &quot;wonderful ability to segue in and out of tense firefights and moments of ridiculous slapstick&quot;. The publication praised the map for its wide open design and combination of ground combat and third-person vehicles, which, while taken for granted in the modern day, was rare at the time of &quot;Halo&quot;&#x27;s release and required &quot;a different approach to map design&quot;. In &quot;Engadget&#x27;s&quot; coverage of the reveal of the Blood Gulch map returning for &quot;Halo: Reach&quot;, Richard Mitchell remarked that it is &quot;probably the most well-remembered map in &quot;Halo&quot; history&quot;, while the version in &quot;Reach&quot; is &quot;very familiar and very different&quot;, drawing attention to the fact that players can leave the canyon. Good Game called the map &quot;&quot;Halo&quot;&#x27;s most iconic&quot; and said that &quot;teamwork is at the core of the Gulch&quot;, while &quot;the best way to experience the gulch has always been behind the wheel&quot;. GameZone called the map &quot;easily a standout of the franchise&quot;, citing how often it has been remade across games. Ryan McCaffrey of Official Xbox Magazine called Blood Gulch &quot;one of the best multiplayer maps to grace any first-person shooter&quot; and praised the map&#x27;s successor, Hemorrhage, that carries over the map&#x27;s terrain.

Phil Spencer, head of the Xbox brand, called Blood Gulch his favorite &quot;Halo&quot; map, citing its terrain, large amount of vehicle combat and the excitement of coordinating friends to capture the flag.

Blood Gulch was recreated by a fan for the game &quot;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&quot;, with &quot;Kotaku&quot; calling the map &quot;very nicely done&quot;.

== In other media ==
Blood Gulch was popularized in part due to it being the main setting of the first five seasons of &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot;, a web series that first aired in the early 2000s. It was later featured in the battle royale game &quot;Fortnite&quot;. The addition was announced by Ninja and several &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; characters&quot;.&quot;

<text>James Chamberlain Jones (April 20, 1809 – October 29, 1859) was an American politician who served as the tenth governor of Tennessee from 1841 to 1845, and as a United States Senator from Tennessee from 1851 to 1857. A Whig, Jones twice defeated future U.S. President James K. Polk for the governorship, in 1841 and 1843. He was the first native-born Tennessean to be elected governor of the state.

Jones&#x27;s first gubernatorial term was marked by gridlock with the state senate, which was led by a group of Democratic senators known as the &quot;Immortal Thirteen.&quot; His second term was more productive, as his fellow Whigs controlled both houses of the legislature. Though he later joined the Democratic Party, Jones&#x27;s speaking skills and campaign style helped to solidify Tennessee&#x27;s Whigs as one of the strongest Whig movements in the South.

==Early life==
A thin man whose nickname was &quot;Lean Jimmy&quot; (he stood 6&#x27;2&quot; but weighed only 125 pounds), Jones was born in Davidson County, Tennessee, the son of Peter and Catherine Chappell Jones. His parents died when he was still young, and he was raised by an uncle in Wilson County. He occasionally attended public schools. After marrying Sarah Munford in 1829, he purchased a farm near Lebanon, Tennessee.

In 1836, Jones supported the presidential campaign of Hugh Lawson White, a former Democrat who had turned against Andrew Jackson and joined the Whig Party. The following year, Jones was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives, representing Wilson County. He was reelected in 1839. In 1840, Jones was an elector for presidential candidate William Henry Harrison. While in the legislature, Jones studied law, but never practiced.

==Governor==
In 1841, the Tennessee Whigs nominated Jones as their candidate for governor. The Whigs believed that Jones, widely known as an entertaining speaker and storyteller, was their best shot to defeat incumbent governor, James K. Polk. After besting Polk in a series of debates in the Spring of 1841, Jones won the election by just 3,000 votes out of over 100,000 cast.
Following the election of 1841, Whigs controlled the state House of Representatives, but Democrats held onto the state senate by a 13 to 12 margin. One of the first tasks of the new government was to fill the U.S. Senate seats left vacant by the resignations of Alexander O. Anderson and Alfred O. P. Nicholson. Democrats demanded one of the two seats go to a Democrat, a request the Whigs rejected. The 13 Democrats in the state senate, who became known as the &quot;Immortal Thirteen,&quot; refused to allow a joint session of the legislature (where Whigs, who controlled the House, would have a numerical majority) to choose the replacement senators, and Tennessee thus had no representation in the U.S. Senate for most of 1842 and 1843. Though the government was mostly gridlocked by the Immortal Thirteen during Jones&#x27;s first term, it did manage to enact debt reform legislation in 1842.

In the election of 1843, Polk canvassed the state extensively in hopes of taking back the governor&#x27;s office, but he was again unsuccessful. Furthermore, Whigs gained control of the state senate, ending the &quot;Immortal Thirteen&quot; gridlock, and two Whigs were appointed to the state&#x27;s U.S. Senate seats. Jones&#x27;s second term saw the establishment of a state school for the blind in Nashville and a school for the deaf in Knoxville. In 1843, Nashville, which had been serving as the temporary capital of the state for years (as had several other places before it), was officially selected as the state&#x27;s permanent capital. The cornerstone for the Tennessee State Capitol was laid while Jones was still governor.

==U.S. Senate and later life==
Jones did not seek a third term, choosing instead to accept an offer to become president of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad. He was an elector for Zachary Taylor in the U.S. presidential election of 1848.

In 1851, the state legislature chose Jones to replace Hopkins L. Turney in the U.S. Senate. Jones supported Winfield Scott in the presidential election of 1852, but afterward began to drift apart from the Whig Party, which was imploding over the issue of slavery. In 1854, he railed against northern Whigs for refusing to support the Kansas-Nebraska Act. After the collapse of the Whig Party, Jones refused to join the American Party with other southern Whigs, and supported James Buchanan in the 1856 presidential election. He endorsed Stephen Douglas in the election of 1860.

After serving in the United States Senate, Jones retired to his farm near Memphis, where he died. He was interred in the city&#x27;s Elmwood Cemetery.

<text>The Five Colleges of Ohio, Inc. is an American academic and administrative consortium of five private liberal arts colleges in the state of Ohio. It is a nonprofit educational consortium established in 1995 to promote the broad educational and cultural objectives of its member institutions.

==Members==
The members of The Five Colleges of Ohio consortium are:
* Denison University, Granville, Ohio
* Kenyon College, Gambier, Ohio
* Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio
* Ohio Wesleyan University, Delaware, Ohio
* The College of Wooster, Wooster, Ohio

== History ==
The designation &quot;Ohio Five&quot; first appeared in Ohio newspapers in the early twentieth century. The grouping, predating any formal agreement, was immediately adopted by the press as a foreshadowing of an Ohio league of schools with similar academic and athletic reputations, which at the time was a common perception.

Following informal discussions among the five colleges in the early 1990s, the consortium was formalized by the incorporation of the organization on June 30, 1995. A grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, awarded in June 1995, provided for the development of a joint library system, establishment of an administrative structure, and investigation of the benefits and methods for sharing digital images and multimedia resources, establishing The Five Colleges of Ohio, Inc. as a legal entity.

Collaboration among the five colleges occurs in several areas:

*Academic Programs
*Administrative Programs and Technology
*Libraries

== Academic programs ==
The colleges have worked together on grants and long-term projects to support curricular development, faculty collaborations, and opportunities for students. These projects have included:

In language teaching:

* Foreign Language Technology Project (1996-2002) a four-year project funded by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to strengthen foreign language learning through collaborative use of technology 
* Language Enrichment and Postdoctoral Fellowship Program (2015-), a Mellon-funded program which placed thirteen postdoctoral fellows in languages from The Ohio State University for two-year terms and provided opportunities for faculty to collaborate on teaching and scholarship project. In its final phase in 2018-19, the project included a test of three advanced Chinese language courses shared among four of the colleges via distance technology.

In curricular development:

* Teagle Creativity and Critical Thinking Assessment 2005-2006, a multi-year project funded by The Teagle Foundation that developed tools to assess outcomes of a liberal arts education: creativity and critical thinking. 
* Teagle Curricular Coherence Project 2015-2019 supported a comprehensive initiative offering structured ways for students to complete general education requirements and create coherent understanding of their educational pathways.

In student opportunities:

* Ohio Five-OSU Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) offers science students at the Five Colleges of Ohio an opportunity to engage in summer research activities in Ohio State University laboratories. 
* Stanford-Ohio Five structural molecular biology collaboration provides internship opportunities at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL.)

In faculty collaborations:

Ohio Five Dance Workshops support an annual showcase of faculty and student dance performances at member colleges.

==Administrative programs==
In 2012, the Ohio Five resolved to identify and implement a joint e-procurement solution to automate purchasing and contract administration across the colleges and realize related savings through joint purchasing plans and contracts. A $100,000 grant from the Mellon Foundation in 2014 supported system installation and a full-time staff member was hired to supervise the program. Denison University, Kenyon College, Oberlin College and Ohio Wesleyan University moved forward together to develop the program, which realized an estimated $500,000 in contract savings in its first fully implemented year in 2015-16. In 2017-18, more than 4,300 suppliers were active in the e-procurement system representing an annual spend of $4.483 million.

Since 2014, the Five Colleges have also collaborated on a shared online work order system enabling the colleges to optimize workflow in facilities management and maintenance and track expenditures.

Risk management, disaster planning, Title IX training and investigative services and information technologies represent additional areas in which the college work together to support training and cost savings. The Ohio Five also maintains a job site for employment opportunities in faculty, staff, and administration at the Five Colleges

==Libraries==

The libraries of Denison University, Kenyon College, Ohio Wesleyan University, and The College of Wooster share an integrated library system called CONSORT. This multi-college system maximizes the colleges&#x27; abilities to share collection resources and collaborate on collection-related databases and publications. Oberlin College maintains its own integrated library system called OBIS.

Since the founding of the Five Colleges, its libraries have worked together to support the development of the CONSORT system and promote institutional priorities in digital literacy and digital scholarship. Joint library projects have included:

* Information Literacy Web Tutorials (1998) a project funded by the Foundation for Independent Higher Education and A T &amp; T.

The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation provided significant support for three projects focusing on digital scholarship:

* Integrating Informational Literacy into the Liberal Arts Curriculum (1999), a project to support curricular innovations to deepen student capacity in using information resources.
* Next Generation Library and Digital Collections (2009–11), which funded the development of digital collections by faculty and librarians
* Digital Collections: From Projects to Pedagogy and Scholarship (2013-), which created digital resources to enhance faculty and student research, teaching, and learning using emerging aspects of media literacy, scholarly communication, information literacy, information management and digital publishing.

== Governance ==
The Five Colleges of Ohio is governed by its five presidents who form the organization&#x27;s board of trustees. Standing committees led by cabinet officers of each college supervise finance and business operations (chief financial and business officers), academic affairs (provosts and deans), library programs (library directors) and information technology (chief financial officers). The Five Colleges of Ohio is managed by a full-time staff of five who supervise the organization&#x27;s activities from offices located throughout the consortium, with a central office at Oberlin College.

<doc id="865536" wikidata="Q742217" url="?curid=865536" title="Gleb Kotelnikov">
<text>Gleb Yevgenyevich Kotelnikov (), was born on , at the household of a St. Petersburg Institute professor who taught higher mathematics and mechanics. His parents moved to Saint Petersburg from Poltava in 1868. Kotelnikov belonged to a theatre-loving family, which enhanced his desire to perform on stage. Kotelnikov was the Russian-Soviet inventor of the knapsack parachute (first in the hard casing and then in the soft pack), and braking parachute.

==Early life, family and education==
Gleb Kotelnikov had exceptional musical ability at a young age, becoming proficient on the violin, balalaika, and mandolin and even writing his own music. In addition to music, he was interested in electronics and fencing, and he had exceptional aptitude in building complex gadgets. Using only a used lens and hand-crafting the remaining components, such as photographic plates, he constructed a working camera at the age of thirteen. His father fostered his many interests and supported his ability. 

After his father passed away unexpectedly, Kotelnikov had to change his plans to attend a technical institute or conservatory. Financial difficulties forced him to give up his artistic goals and enlist in the army, attending the Kiev Military School. 

In 1894 he graduated with honors. After three years of compulsory service, he went into the reserve - returned to Poltava (where his parents resided since 1889), married there and got a job as an excise official in the provincial excise department. Excise service, simultaneously with the introduction of the wine monopoly, established a curatorial office for national sobriety, which organized public readings, open readings, and folk theaters - which allowed him to indulge in what he loved. 

In 1910 Gleb returned to St Petersburg and became an actor in the troupe of the People&#x27;s House on the Petersburg side (with Glebov-Kotelnikov as his pseudonym ).

==Career ==
Early in the 20th century, Russia&#x27;s first pilots frequently conducted demonstration flights in large towns to demonstrate their proficiency with aircraft control. Kotelnikov developed a fascination with flying. He was a regular visitor to the Commandant airfield, where he watched the aircraft with interest. Kotelnikov was greatly moved by the courage and commitment of Russian pilots who ventured to the skies in shaky, primitive planes, and he realized the enormous possibilities of aerial exploration.

He witnessed the death of a talented Russian pilot Lev Matsivich which was such a shock that he became obsessed with the idea of constructing a parachute, to which he devoted several years of his life as well as all his personal savings.

In 1911 he created his first parachute RK-1 (which stands for Rantseviy (knapsack) or Russian Kotelnikova (by Kotelnikov), 1st model), that was successfully employed in 1914 during World War I.

Later on, Kotelnikov significantly improved the design of his parachute, creating new models, including RK-2 with a softer knapsack, RK-3, and a few cargo parachutes, all of which would be adopted by the Soviet Air Force.

In 1911 he applied for a patent to the Committee on Inventions in France and was granted the patent under the number 438612, in which he summarized the function of his parachute:The working principle of the apparatus is as follows: 
in case of an emergency, a pilot, wearing it on his back, could throw himself out of an aircraft, opening a knapsack by pulling a cord attached to its lock. In case of an unexpected fall the device can work quite automatically. For that purpose the lock of the parapack is connected with a carriage of an aircraft by means of a cord which would open the lock of a parapack being stretched under the weight of a falling man.
At first G.Kotelnikov called his invention a safety apparatus, a knapsack-parachute and later on it got the name of RK-1.

In 1912 on a road near Tsarskoye Selo (now part of St. Petersburg) Kotelnikov successfully demonstrated the braking effects of the parachute by accelerating a Russo-Balt automobile to the top speed, and then opening a parachute attached to the back seat, thus inventing the drogue parachute. In aviation, however, drag chutes were used for the first time only in 1937 by the Soviet airplanes in the Arctic that were providing support for the famous polar expeditions of the era, such as the first drifting ice station North Pole-1, launched the same year. The drag chute allowed to land safely on the ice-floes of smaller size.


Kotelnikov continued to be an important figure in the development of parachutes and parachuting in the Soviet Union. In 1924 Kotelnikov for the first time applied the soft packing of parachute instead of a hard casing. He produced some of the earliest cargo parachutes, and was a contemporary to the start of the parachuting sport in Russia in 1930 and the creation of the Soviet Airborne Troops the same year (the first paratrooping force in history). In his late years, Kotelnikov wrote a book about the invention and subsequent development of parachutes.

==Personal life, demise and legacy==

In addition to his creative endeavors, Kotelnikov was involved in public service, giving lectures on the advancement of rescue gear, teaching novice pilots, and lending his knowledge to aviation groups. Due to his age and blindness he retired in 1926 at the age of fifty-five to concentrate on creating new models, and he kindly gave the Soviet government all of his aircraft rescue technologies. Kotelnikov received the Order of the Red Star in appreciation of his services.

After World War II broke out, Kotelnikov was in the beleaguered city of Leningrad. The gifted innovator passed away on November 22, 1944, in the Russian capital. His grave at Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow became a place of pilgrimage for Russian paratroopers.

The village Saalisi, where he first tested his parachute, was renamed Kotelnikovo in his honor.

<text>Aaron Venable Brown (August 15, 1795 – March 8, 1859) was an American politician. He served as the 11th Governor of Tennessee from 1845 to 1847, and as United States Postmaster General from 1857 until his death in 1859. He also served three terms in the United States House of Representatives, from 1839 to 1845. During the Mexican–American War, Brown&#x27;s statewide call for 2,800 volunteers was answered by over 30,000, helping solidify the state&#x27;s reputation as the &quot;Volunteer State.&quot;

==Early life==
Brown was born in Brunswick County, Virginia, one of eleven children of Aaron and Elizabeth Melton Brown. His father was a Methodist minister. Brown attended Westrayville Academy in Nash County, North Carolina, and graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1814, where he was valedictorian of his class. He studied law with Judge James Trimble in Nashville, Tennessee, and was admitted to the bar in 1817. In 1818, he moved to Giles County, Tennessee, and became the law partner of future president James K. Polk.

==Career==
Brown was a member of the Tennessee Senate from 1821 to 1825 and from 1827 to 1829. He also served two terms in the Tennessee House of Representatives, from 1831 to 1835. In 1839, he defeated incumbent Ebenezer J. Shields for the 10th District congressional seat, and won reelection to this seat in 1841. In 1843, he was redistricted to the 6th District, which he represented in Congress for a single term. As a congressman, he lobbied for the annexation of Texas in 1843.

After his third term in Congress, Brown initially planned to retire and focus on his business affairs, but he accepted the Democratic nomination for governor in 1845. The incumbent, James C. Jones, a popular Whig, was not seeking reelection, and the Whigs instead nominated Senator Ephraim H. Foster. In the general election, Brown lost East Tennessee and West Tennessee, but won enough votes in populous Middle Tennessee to carry the election by 1,400 votes out of 115,000 cast.

When the Mexican–American War began, largely through the actions of his friend and former law partner, Polk, who was now president, Brown issued a call for 2,800 volunteer soldiers for the war effort. Over 30,000 answered the call, solidifying the state&#x27;s reputation as the &quot;Volunteer State,&quot; a reputation that had been gained when Tennesseans answered a similar call during the War of 1812. While initially popular, support for the war gradually declined, and Brown was defeated in his reelection bid by Neill S. Brown (no relation) in 1847.

Brown was a slaveholder. 
In 1850, He was a delegate to the Nashville Convention, which was a gathering of delegates from slave-holding states to consider a course of action should the federal government attempt to ban slavery. Brown and his brother-in-law, Gideon Pillow, coauthored a resolution calling for the support of the Compromise of 1850. This motion was voted down, but the convention did put aside, at least temporarily, the issue of secession.

Brown was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1852 where Franklin Pierce and William R. King were nominated. In 1854, he delivered an address to the University of North Carolina&#x27;s literary societies.

Brown attended the 1856 Democratic National Convention, where he was considered a possible vice-presidential nominee. The following year, newly elected president James Buchanan appointed him Postmaster General, a position in which he served until his death.

Brown died on March 8, 1859, and is interred at Nashville&#x27;s Mount Olivet Cemetery.

==Family==
Brown married his first wife, Sarah Burrus, at an undetermined date, and they had six children. Following her death, he married Cynthia Pillow Sanders, the sister of Gideon Pillow and widow of John W. Sanders, and they had one son. Hill McAlister, a great-grandson of Brown, served as Governor of Tennessee in the 1930s.

==Recognition==
USS Aaron V. Brown, a revenue cutter, was named after him.

<text>Two Guys and a Girl (titled Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place for the first two seasons) is an American television sitcom created by Rick Wiener, Kenny Schwartz, and Danny Jacobson. The series started as a short-run (thirteen episodes) mid-season replacement on March 11, 1998, on ABC. The series ran for four seasons, ending with a planned series finale, its eighty-first episode, on May 16, 2001.

The series starred Ryan Reynolds, Richard Ruccolo, and Traylor Howard as the title characters. The second season saw the arrival of two additional recurring characters: Johnny Donnelly (Nathan Fillion) and Ashley Walker (Suzanne Cryer). In 2000, for the fourth season, ABC moved the sitcom from midweek to a Friday night death slot, leading to a steep drop in ratings. After the show moved back to Wednesday for a two-week trial in an unsuccessful attempt to regain ratings, it was cancelled in May 2001. The series finale was titled &quot;The Internet Show&quot;, an episode in which fans of the show voted on the characters&#x27; outcome online.

==Overview==

Focusing on the lives of twenty-somethings Michael Bergen, Pete Dunville, and Sharon Carter, the show was originally based on the life of its creator. The fictional &quot;Beacon Street Pizza&quot; was based on a real pizza restaurant named Theo&#x27;s Pizza in Teele Square, Somerville, Massachusetts, where show creator Kenny Schwartz worked while attending nearby Tufts University. The show is set in Boston, but was filmed at CBS Studio Center in Studio City, Los Angeles, California.

The series stars Ryan Reynolds as Michael Leslie &quot;Berg&quot; Bergen, Richard Ruccolo as Peter &quot;Pete&quot; Dunville, and Traylor Howard as Sharon Carter (later Carter-Donnelly). In the first two seasons, Berg, a slacker, works at a Boston pizza parlor, Beacon Street Pizza, with Pete. They both attend Tufts University, with Sharon, who after graduation, works as the spokesperson for Immaculate Chemicals.

The format of the initial season varied considerably from subsequent seasons. The first season features Jennifer Westfeldt as Melissa, Pete&#x27;s girlfriend, and David Ogden Stiers as Mr. Bauer, a delusional old man who frequents the pizza place, pretending that experiences from films are his own. The second season abandons these two characters, focusing on the interplay between Pete and Berg and their relationship with Sharon, who lives in the apartment above them. Berg eventually decides to attend medical school and become a doctor, while Pete drops out of architecture classes to become a career counselor. The second season also introduces Johnny Donnelly (Nathan Fillion), a jukebox repairman who starts dating Sharon, and Ashley Walker (Suzanne Cryer), a medical school classmate of Berg&#x27;s who competes with him to be top of the class.

At the start of season three, the pizza place setting is abandoned entirely (hence the change in the show&#x27;s title), and Berg begins his medical residency. Pete becomes a vice president of a cosmetics company, and then a firefighter. Johnny and Sharon marry and become the superintendents of their apartment building. Berg goes on to date Irene (Jillian Bach), the eccentric neighbor across the hall and Pete begins dating a fellow firefighter named Marti (Tiffani Thiessen).

Viewers were left unable to know what Ashley would do with the baby due to the show&#x27;s cancellation.
* Jillian Bach as Irene (1999–2001) – arrives mid-season 2 as Pete&#x27;s stalker. She then forms a sexual relationship with Berg, while maintaining her love for Pete.

Despite his small height, he behaves as if he were tall and muscular, frequently challenging the much more physically intimidating Berg to fights. In the finale, it is revealed that this sense of self-righteousness comes from his status as an army reservist who is trained to snap a man&#x27;s neck with one hand.

==Story progression==

===Season 1===
The series premiered on March 11, 1998, as &quot;Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place&quot;. The episode entitled &quot;The Pilot&quot; was watched by almost 18 million viewers.

The story of season 1 centers around the pizza place. Actors such as Jennifer Westfeldt (Melissa), and Julius Carry (Bill) were credited as secondary cast members to principals Ryan Reynolds, Richard Ruccolo, and Traylor Howard. Mr. Bauer, played by David Ogden Stiers, frequently appeared around the pizza place, telling stories of life events which actually occurred in movies. Pete and Berg share an apartment, on which Pete pays the rent every month, with Berg testing experimental drugs to supplement their income. Pete structures his life around architecture and grad school, while Sharon, their friend upstairs, works for an evil corporation that exploits the Earth&#x27;s natural resources, much to her dislike.

The episodes contained storylines including Pete preparing for a presentation which Berg ruins; Berg stealing the Celtics&#x27; &#x27;81 championship banner; Sharon joining the softball team; and the story of how they all met. Because the episodes aired out of order, the season seems very disjointed---demonstrated by the status of Pete&#x27;s relationship with Melissa: in episode 8 – &quot;Party&quot; Melissa and Pete are still together despite having previously broken up in episode 5 – &quot;Apartment&quot;. On the DVD release, they are episodes 2 and 7.

===Season 2===
Season 2 had a more structured basis for each episode. Two additional primary characters arrived: Ashley Walker (Suzanne Cryer) and Johnny Donnelly (Nathan Fillion), as well as the dismissal of characters Bill, Mr. Bauer, and Pete&#x27;s long-time girlfriend Melissa.

The season starts with Berg&#x27;s realization that someone in his class, Walker, is more clever than he is. It leads to an anticipated romance between Berg and Ashley as they both head down the path of becoming physicians. Jukebox repairman Johnny Donnelly begins a relationship with Sharon. Other secondary characters (Irene, Kamen, Shawn) are introduced throughout the season. Episodes of season 2 include: &quot;Two Guys, a Girl and an Engagement&quot;, &quot;Two Guys, a Girl and a Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot;, and &quot;Two Guys, a Girl and Ashley&#x27;s Return&quot;, all of which mark turning points in the story of the show. Johnny and Sharon break up on Valentine&#x27;s Day due to Sharon&#x27;s jealousy of Shawn, Johnny&#x27;s (female) best friend. Berg and Ashley finally get together in &quot;...And Ashley&#x27;s Return&quot;. Pete confesses his feelings towards Sharon, and Johnny proposes in &quot;...And an Engagement&quot;. The season ends with Sharon not giving Johnny an answer as well as her realizing she may have feelings for Pete. It left the show with a cliffhanger after ABC had renewed it for another season.

===Season 3===
The pizza place is completely abandoned in the third season so that the characters can pursue different dreams. The premiere resolves the season two cliffhanger, with Sharon answering Johnny&#x27;s proposal with &#x27;Yes, in theory,&#x27; although she is still holding out on her feelings for Pete. Evidently, Pete flies to Paris after the night&#x27;s events and returns completely over Sharon, with a new girlfriend who speaks only French and is revealed to be extremely racist. Berg and Ashley continue to build on their relationship and finally become doctors involved in psych rotations. The season portrays their relationship as unsteady and completely built on hate of one another. It leads to Berg breaking up with Ashley during the middle of the season.

Ashley lives with Pete and Berg before moving into her own apartment, which was originally Sharon&#x27;s and Johnny&#x27;s, who move to the basement to become the new supers. She starts dating Boston Red Sox baseball star Nomar Garciaparra, who appears as himself. Pete finds his true calling by becoming a firefighter. He enjoys the experience of being an honorary firefighter until the feisty Marti, played by Tiffani Thiessen, comes along to thwart him at every turn. The two continue to take shots at each other until she starts dating Berg, to Pete&#x27;s dislike. Pete and Berg get into a huge fight concerning Marti and consider not being roommates anymore.

When Pete gets his acceptance letter to Fireman Boot Camp, he goes to Marti with open arms and they become an item. Pete continues to hate Berg throughout the final episodes of the season. Sharon and Johnny bicker at one another until Johnny calls off the wedding. When they get back together, they decide that a quickie wedding is the best idea. Irene, Pete&#x27;s alleged stalker, agrees to throw Sharon and Johnny a wedding on the roof of the building; it results in her inviting Robert Goulet, who conducts the ceremony and brings Pete and Berg back together as friends during the wedding.

At the end of the two-part season finale, Pete and Marti leave to go to Fireman Boot Camp, Sharon, and Johnny go on their honeymoon, and Ashley leaves to sort out a joke that Pete told Nomar, causing his and Ashley&#x27;s break-up. Berg and Irene are left alone at the wedding and start to dance. The series ends with another cliffhanger as the audience is led to believe something will happen between Berg and Irene. The series was renewed for another season due to its 10.2 million average viewers during season 3.

===Season 4===
In 2001, ABC moved the sitcom from mid-week to Friday and the show&#x27;s average viewers dropped from 10.2 to 6.7 million.

Season 4 continues the story arc from the end of Season 3. Johnny and Sharon are married, Pete and Marti are now firefighters, and Berg and Irene are sleeping together. After Berg gets over being on academic probation, he continues to be Irene&#x27;s &quot;sex buddy&quot;. The two start sleeping together secretly, hoping that Pete won&#x27;t know.

Johnny continues to be the superintendent until Sharon makes him an honorary fireman for the day on his birthday. Johnny decides that he wants to be a fireman, much to Sharon&#x27;s dislike. Meanwhile, Berg and Irene become a couple and Pete and Marti break up. Marti leaves Pete for Ashley&#x27;s ex, Nomar. Sharon feels unfulfilled after leaving her evil corporate job and decides that she wants to be a lawyer.

When Berg tells Irene that he loves her and she has no reply, Berg goes out and meets someone else. Katie, the girl he meets, admits she&#x27;s been following him for 8 years. The two kiss and Berg tells Irene. Berg apologizes and Irene breaks up with him for the mailman Roger. In the final episode, Berg assumes that Irene may be pregnant and decides that he must win her back.

==Series finale==
The series finale is titled &quot;The Internet Show&quot;, and was an episode in which fans of the show voted on the outcome online. The episode aired on May 16, 2001. It was written by Donald Beck and Vince Calandra and directed by Michael Lembeck.

In the episode, Sharon thinks she may be pregnant and Ashley realizes she could be too. Ashley goes into denial, despite showing symptoms, but agrees to take a pregnancy test with Sharon. When Berg finds out from a news report that a glow-in-the-dark condom he used was defective he thinks Irene could be pregnant. Not wanting to worry her, he tries to get a urine sample from her without telling her. Pete is still annoyed at Ashley for giving up on their relationship to go to Stanford.

Four different endings were filmed for viewers to decide whether one of the three central female characters (Sharon, Ashley, or Irene) should become pregnant or whether none should be. The plan was to have the pregnant one (which ultimately ended up being Ashley) give birth at the end of the proposed fifth season. However, a fifth season of the show never materialized; by the time the fourth-season finale aired in May 2001, the show had been cancelled due to low ratings.

==Ratings==
The show had strong ratings success during its run, peaking in season 2 with an average of 12.0 million viewers. The series premiere, titled &quot;The Pilot&quot;, was watched by 17.94 million viewers, airing after &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;. The episode got a 15.61 Nielsen rating and won its 18-49 adult demographic. It was ABC&#x27;s biggest opening since &quot;Spin City&quot;. The eleventh episode of season 1, &quot;Two Guys, a Girl and How They Met&quot;, got a 6.7 Nielsen rating, a big drop from the series premiere. The estimated number of viewers was 7.69 million.

The show continued to have success during the first few seasons but never reached the high rating of &quot;The Pilot&quot;. Its key adult 18–49 audience was predominantly female (55%). It was ranked #1 in its time period with Total Viewers, outperforming &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, &quot;The Nanny&quot;, and &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;. It was also #1 in its time slot with key adults 18–49 and with all male demographics. It was the #3 sitcom on ABC with key adults 18–34.

==Production notes==

===Theme song and opening sequences===
The title sequence for the first two seasons consists of a short collection of images of the three main characters, and a few cartoon images of them drinking and eating pizza at the pizza place, which alternated with a logo saying &quot;Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place&quot;. The title screen is accompanied by an instrumental cover of the song &quot;Blister in the Sun&quot; by the Violent Femmes.

The title sequence for Seasons 3 and 4 shows Pete, Berg, and Sharon dancing to a more modern piece of music in front of a plain white backdrop, wearing suits and dresses. The newly adopted logo (the show&#x27;s name having changed) is seen overlaying the footage as the three dance and laugh.

The music for the series was composed by Freddy Curci, Tom Rizzo and Mark Vogel. The music for Seasons 1 and 2 included numerous variations on the title theme, a prime example of which is &quot;Two Guys, a Girl and a Vacation&quot; where the cast members do a short rendition of &quot;Kokomo&quot; by The Beach Boys. Steel drums and Caribbean instruments were used to vary the title theme within the scenes of the episode.

<doc id="865544" wikidata="Q2248732" url="?curid=865544" title="Pac-Man Plus">
<text>Pac-Man Plus is an arcade game that was developed by Namco and released by Bally Midway in 1982. It is part of the &quot;Pac-Man&quot; series of games.

== Gameplay ==

The gameplay in &quot;Pac-Man Plus&quot; is nearly identical to that of the original &quot;Pac-Man&quot;. The player controls Pac-Man and attempts to score as many points as possible by eating all the Pac-Dots in the maze while avoiding the four ghosts that chase him around the maze and will kill him if they catch him. Eating a Power Pellet will cause the ghosts to turn blue and become vulnerable for a short period of time, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for extra points. Once the maze has been cleared, it will be refilled as the gameplay continues.

The most noticeable differences between the original game and &quot;Plus&quot; are various tweaks to the graphics: the maze is green instead of blue, vulnerable ghosts are shorter and have a stem and leaf sticking out of their heads, the fruits have been replaced by new items (including a can of Coca-Cola) and the ghosts&#x27; eyes are now a pixel closer to each other. In addition to these cosmetic changes, &quot;Plus&quot; also changes the gameplay slightly: eating a bonus item will cause the ghosts to turn both vulnerable and invisible, and doubles their point value while they are vulnerable. Eating a Power Pellet also sometimes has unpredictable results, such as turning the maze invisible or turning only three of the four ghosts blue (the latter of which makes it impossible to clear a round by using a pattern). The ghosts are also faster and more aggressive than they were in the original &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, which makes the game seem overall faster-paced and more difficult by comparison.

== Development ==

Midway advertised the game as &quot;the only legal &quot;PAC-MAN&quot; conversion package&quot; and called it &quot;Exciting!&quot; and &quot;New!&quot;. &quot;Pac-Man Plus&quot; was an upgrade kit for Namco &quot;Pac-Man&quot; boards. It consisted of a module which connected via a ribbon cable to the socket originally occupied by the Z-80 microprocessor. The module contained its own Z-80 microprocessor as well as additional components. It was potted with epoxy to prevent easy reverse-engineering. Additionally, the kit also replaced the four &quot;Pac-Man&quot; program roms on the main game board with a new code. Two other roms containing updated data for drawing character and maze were also exchanged. Finally, two relatively tiny supplementary roms containing new color data completed the modification.

==Reception==
&quot;Arcade Express&quot; rated the game eight out of ten, stating that it &quot;features all the graphics, challenge and excitement of the original while eliminating patterned play&quot; with random movement and a few surprises making it &quot;an interesting new twist for Pac-fans.&quot;

== Legacy ==
There were no contemporary home versions. Recent versions include a J2ME mobile version, and ports included in several TV Games from Jakks Pacific and from Bandai.

In addition, there have been efforts by some homebrew game developers to port &quot;Pac-Man Plus&quot; to classic game consoles, such as the ColecoVision Pac-Man Collection by Opcode Games (press 7587 on the #2 controller at the main menu screen when seeing PLUS press the fire button), Atari 2600, and more recently the Atari 5200 and 7800.

In 2018, an arcade cabinet called &quot;Pac-Man&#x27;s Pixel Bash&quot; was released by &quot;Bandai Namco Amusements&quot; with 31 or 32 classic Namco games included, 1 of which is &quot;Pac-Man Plus&quot;.
The arcade cabinet is available in both Coin-Op, and Home versions.

In 2018, Arcade1Up released a new home arcade cabinet that plays both regular &quot;Pac-Man&quot; and &quot;Pac-Man Plus&quot;. In 2020, Arcade 1Up released a &quot;Pac-Man&quot; 40th anniversary home arcade cabinet (Generation 3), which included seven games, of which one was &quot;Pac-Man Plus&quot;.

In 2022, Arcade1Up, in conjunction with Sam&#x27;s Club, released a &quot;Pac-Man Plus&quot; themed cabaret legacy edition with the same game list as 2021&#x27;s Bandai Namco legacy edition and similar releases. Although the cabinet was mistakenly labeled as &quot;Super Pac-Man&quot;, it is currently being corrected.

<doc id="865545" wikidata="Q128106" url="?curid=865545" title="Solar spicule">
<text>In solar physics, a spicule, also known as a fibril or mottle, is a dynamic jet of plasma in the Sun&#x27;s chromosphere about 300 km in diameter. They move upwards with speeds between 15 and 110 km/s from the photosphere and last a few minutes each before falling back to the solar atmosphere. They were discovered in 1877 by Angelo Secchi, but the physical mechanism that generates them is still hotly debated.

==Description==
Spicules last for about 15 minutes; at the solar limb they appear elongated (if seen on the disk, they are known as &quot;mottles&quot; or &quot;fibrils&quot;). They are usually associated with regions of high magnetic flux; their mass flux is about 100 times that of the solar wind. They rise at a rate of 20 km/s (or 72,000 km/h) and can reach several thousand kilometers in height before collapsing and fading away.

==Prevalence==
There are about 3,000,000 active spicules at any one time on the Sun&#x27;s chromosphere. An individual spicule typically reaches 3,000–10,000 km altitude above the photosphere.

==Causes==
Bart De Pontieu (Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory, Palo Alto, California, United States), Robert Erdélyi and Stewart James (both from the University of Sheffield, United Kingdom) hypothesised in 2004 that spicules form as a result of P-mode oscillations in the Sun&#x27;s surface, sound waves with a period of about five minutes that causes the Sun&#x27;s surface to rise and fall at several hundred meters per second (see helioseismology). Magnetic flux tubes that are tilted away from the vertical can focus and guide the rising material up into the solar atmosphere to form a spicule. However, there is still some controversy about the issue in the solar physics community.

<doc id="865552" wikidata="Q1572086" url="?curid=865552" title="Jr. Pac-Man">
<text>Jr. Pac-Man is an arcade video game developed by General Computer Corporation and released by Bally Midway in 1983. It has the same gameplay as prior entries in the series, but the maze in &quot;Jr. Pac-Man&quot; scrolls horizontally and has no escape tunnels. The bonus item which moves around the maze changes dots into a form which slows Jr. Pac-Man as they are being eaten.

==Gameplay==
The core gameplay of &quot;Jr. Pac-Man&quot; is similar to its predecessors. The player controls the eponymous Jr. Pac-Man (who wears an animated propeller beanie), and scores points by eating all of the dots in the maze, while four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Tim, who replaces Clyde) chase him around the maze and attempt to catch him. Eating a power pellet turns the ghosts blue, briefly allowing the player to eat them for extra points. Once the maze is cleared, a new maze is presented and the gameplay continues.

The mazes are now twice the width of the monitor and scroll horizontally. A total of seven mazes appear throughout the game, and five of them have six power pellets instead of four, but none of them have tunnels that wrap around from one side of the screen to the other.

Bonus items (such as tricycles, kites, and balloons) appear in each round, starting above the ghosts&#x27; lair and moving around the maze as in &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot;. As an item encounters dots, it changes them into larger ones that award more points but slow Jr. Pac-Man down while he is eating them. After a certain length of time, the item will move toward one of the remaining power pellets (if any) and explode on contact if not eaten, destroying both itself and the pellet. Contact between Jr. Pac-Man and a non-vulnerable ghost costs the player one life and makes any large dots either disappear or revert to normal ones, depending on how many dots overall are left in the maze.

The between-level intermissions show the developing relationship between Jr. Pac-Man and a small red ghost named Yum-Yum who is apparently the daughter of Blinky.

==Development==
Tim Hoskins worked at General Computer Corporation (GCC) as &quot;Jr. Pac-Man&quot;″s project lead. Hoskins recalled that GCC&#x27;s founder Doug Macrae came up with the idea, referring to the game as &quot;Pac-Baby&quot; in his project notes. Macrae echoed this, adding that &quot;Junior Arriving&quot; had been an intermission scene in &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot;. As &quot;Pac-Man&quot; and &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; were what Macrae described as &quot;huge successes&quot;, the company continued with the series. During this period in arcade development, they had the option to develop the game as a new arcade cabinet or implement a new hardware kit. Macrae had a plan to edit the original &quot;Pac-Man&quot; kits, implementing horizontal scrolling and changing the collectible fruits to toys.

Just like with &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot;, there was no source code available to the team to develop the game, requiring the team to reverse-engineer &quot;Pac-Man&quot; from ROM dumps. Unlike &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot;, which was developed in a few weeks, &quot;Jr. Pac-Man&quot; took months to make. The scrolling play area led to difficulties handling off-screen objects, such as the ghosts. When investigating the &quot;Pac-Man&quot; ROM, the developers found unused elements such as a &quot;fat dot&quot; and another that resembled a flame, inspiring features in the new game. They introduced a fat dot that slowed the player down more than regular dots when Jr. Pac-Man ate them but which was worth more points. For the bouncing toys, they thought of the flame items they discovered and decided to implement an explosion when the fat dot interacted with a power pellet, giving the player urgency to collect the toy item before risking losing a power pellet. Upon the player&#x27;s death, the fat dots would vanish, rewarding skilled players who avoided losing them.

The team also adjusted graphics from the original game, giving Jr. Pac-Man a twirling beanie-cap and giving the game a lower-case font. The group experimented with several ways to show the characters death-sequence, eventually settling on having him shrink down only leaving his beanie-cap. Earlier experiments were coarser, including having Jr. Pac-Man pause then slowly ooze a red substance before the top of his body fell off. The team described creating the new intermissions as difficult, involving creating new graphics and software to drive them.

The game would be the final &quot;Pac-Man&quot; game made by GCC. Hoskins envisioned other ideas to potentially make as a follow-up, such as a &quot;Pac-Man&quot; game from a first-person perspective, but this was never made. 

==Ports==
The Atari 2600 version of the game was programmed in 1984 by Ava Robin-Cohen of GCC. The game was not released until 1986 when the Atari 2600 was experiencing what game historian Brett Weiss described as &quot;a resurgence of sorts&quot; after Nintendo had success in the marketplace with the Nintendo Entertainment System. Atari had just re-released the system as a smaller budget-priced revision in 1986. &quot;Jr. Pac-Man&quot; was released for the Atari 2600 in October 1986.

Ports for the Atari 5200 and the Atari 8-bit computers were finished in 1984, but were scrapped along with &quot;Super Pac-Man&quot; when the home divisions of Atari were sold to Jack Tramiel.

An unofficial port for the Atari 7800 was published in 2009 by AtariAge.

<text>Reginald Tate (13 December 1896 – 23 August 1955) was an English actor and a veteran of many roles on stage, in films and on television. He is remembered best as the first actor to play the television science-fiction character Professor Bernard Quatermass, in the 1953 BBC Television serial &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;.

==Early life==
Reginald Tate was born in Garforth, near Leeds in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and went to school in York. During the First World War he served with the Northamptonshire Regiment and later with the Royal Flying Corps. He left the armed forces after the end of the war and studied acting at Leeds College of Music and Drama. He made his first professional acting appearance at Leeds Art Theatre in 1922, and for the next four years was a resident performer both there and at the city&#x27;s Little Theatre.

In 1926, Tate moved to London, with his first major role being in a production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; at the Strand Theatre. He had particular success with the lead role of Stanhope in R. C. Sherriff&#x27;s play &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;, playing the part in a 1929 tour of Australia and New Zealand and again for a 1934 revival production at the Criterion Theatre in London.

==Film and television career==
Tate made his film debut in 1934 in &quot;Whispering Tongues&quot;, and later in the decade also began to appear in the newer medium of television. On 11 November 1937, Tate appeared as Stanhope again in a production of &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; made by the BBC&#x27;s fledgling television service, one of its earliest major drama productions. His performance was praised by the television critic of &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper, who wrote that: &quot;his performance [was] brilliantly full of fiery disillusionment. It successfully dominated the stage—no easy matter when Osborne is played as well as Mr. Basil Gill played him.&quot;

At the beginning of the Second World War Tate joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. He was given the rank of pilot officer, and by the time his service came to an end in 1944 he had been promoted to squadron leader. He also continued to act during the war, and performed small roles in the well-known films &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; (1943) and &quot;The Way Ahead&quot; (1944). He also had a top supporting role as the intelligence officer, Major Richards, in another classic British war movie, &quot;The Next of Kin&quot; (1942).

After the end of the war Tate continued to perform for theatre and increasingly for television. He met the Austrian television director Rudolph Cartier when Cartier cast him in his BBC production of &quot;It Is Midnight, Dr Schweitzer&quot; in February 1953. Cartier was impressed with Tate&#x27;s performance, and later that year offered him the lead role in &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;, a science-fiction serial he was directing, written by BBC staff scriptwriter Nigel Kneale. Tate was the second choice for the part of Professor Bernard Quatermass; Cartier had previously offered it to his co-star &quot;It Is Midnight, Dr Schweitzer&quot;, André Morell, who declined the role. Morell would later play Quatermass for the third instalment of the series, &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;. Tate however was a success in the part, and in a 1986 interview Nigel Kneale named him as his favourite of all the actors to have played the character. The serial itself was also a success, with the British Film Institute later describing it as &quot;one of the most influential series of the 1950s.&quot; Tate took an increased interest in television, and later in 1953 enrolled on the BBC&#x27;s staff training course to become a television producer. He also began to spend much of his spare time teaching acting classes at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), feeling that he had experience which might be useful to younger actors.

==Death==
When the BBC commissioned a second &quot;Quatermass&quot; serial in 1955, Tate was eager to participate and play the Professor again. Production was due to begin in September, and on 7 August 1955 he produced his first television play, &quot;Night Was Our Friend&quot;. Only sixteen days after this, late at night on 23 August, he collapsed outside his home in London. He had suffered a heart attack, and despite being rushed to hospital in Putney he died soon afterwards.

<doc id="865558" wikidata="Q2990821" url="?curid=865558" title="Rainflow-counting algorithm">
<text>The rainflow-counting algorithm is used in calculating the fatigue life of a component in order to convert a loading sequence of varying stress into a set of constant amplitude stress reversals with equivalent fatigue damage. The method successively extracts the smaller interruption cycles from a sequence, which models the material memory effect seen with stress-strain hysteresis cycles. This simplification allows the number of cycles until failure of a component to be determined for each rainflow cycle using either Miner&#x27;s rule to calculate the &quot;fatigue damage&quot;, or in a crack growth equation to calculate the crack increments. Both methods give an estimate of the &quot;fatigue life&quot; of a component. In cases of multiaxial loading, critical plane analysis can be used together with rainflow counting to identify the uniaxial history associated with the plane that maximizes damage. The algorithm was developed by Tatsuo Endo and M. Matsuishi in 1968.

The rainflow method is compatible with the cycles obtained from examination of the stress-strain hysteresis cycles. When a material is cyclically strained, a plot of stress against strain shows loops forming from the smaller interruption cycles. At the end of the smaller cycle, the material resumes the stress-strain path of the original cycle, as if the interruption had not occurred. The closed loops represent the energy dissipated by the material.


== History ==
The rainflow algorithm was developed by T. Endo and M. Matsuishi (an M.S. student at the time) in 1968 and presented in a Japanese paper. The first English presentation by the authors was in 1974. They communicated the technique to N. E. Dowling and J. Morrow in the U.S. who verified the technique and further popularised its use.

Downing and Socie created one of the more widely referenced and utilized rainflow cycle-counting algorithms in 1982, which was included as one of many cycle-counting algorithms in ASTM E1049-85.

Igor Rychlik gave a mathematical definition for the rainflow counting method, thus enabling closed-form computations from the statistical properties of the load signal.

== Algorithms ==

There are a number of different algorithms for identifying the rainflow cycles within a sequence. They all find the closed cycles and may be left with half closed residual cycles at the end. All methods start with the process of eliminating non turning points from the sequence. A completely closed set of rainflow cycles can be obtained for a repeated load sequence such as used in fatigue testing by starting at the largest peak and continue to the end and wrapping around to the beginning.

=== Four point method ===

This method evaluates each set of 4 adjacent turning points A-B-C-D in turn:

# Any pair of points B-C that lies within or equal to A-D is a rainflow cycle.
# Remove the pair B-C and re-evaluate the sequence from the beginning.
# Continue until no further pairs can be identified.

=== Pagoda roof method ===
This method considers the flow of water down of a series of pagoda roofs. Regions where the water will not flow identify the rainflow cycles which are seen as an interruption to the main cycle.

# Reduce the time history to a sequence of (tensile) peaks and (compressive) valleys.
# Imagine that the time history is a template for a rigid sheet (pagoda roof).
# Turn the sheet clockwise 90° (earliest time to the top).
# Each &quot;tensile peak&quot; is imagined as a source of water that &quot;drips&quot; down the pagoda.
# Count the number of half-cycles by looking for terminations in the flow occurring when either:
#* case (a) It reaches the end of the time history;
#* case (b) It merges with a flow that started at an earlier &quot;tensile peak&quot;; or
#* case (c) An opposite &quot;tensile peak&quot; has greater or equal magnitude.
# Repeat step 5 for &quot;compressive valleys&quot;.
# Assign a magnitude to each half-cycle equal to the stress difference between its start and termination.
# Pair up half-cycles of identical magnitude (but opposite sense) to count the number of complete cycles. Typically, there are some residual half-cycles.

==== Example ====
The stress history in Figure 2 is reduced to tensile peaks in Figure 3 and compressive valleys in Figure 4. From the tensile peaks in Figure 3:
*The first half-cycle starts at tensile peak 1 and terminates opposite a greater tensile stress, peak 3 (case c); its magnitude is 16 MPa (2 - (-14) = 16).
*The half-cycle starting at peak 9 terminates where it is interrupted by a flow from earlier peak 8 (case b); its magnitude is 16 MPa (8 - (-8) = 16).
*The half-cycle starting at peak 11 terminates at the end of the time history (case a); its magnitude is 19 MPa (15 - (-4) = 19).
Similar half-cycles are calculated for compressive stresses (Figure 4) and the half-cycles are then matched.

<text>is a 1984 platform video game developed and published by Namco for arcades. It was distributed in North America by Bally Midway, and in Europe by Atari Games. Controlling Pac-Man, the player must make it to the end of each stage to return a lost fairy back to its home in Fairyland. Pac-Man will need to avoid obstacles, such as falling logs and water-spewing fire hydrants, alongside his enemies, the Ghost Gang. Eating large flashing Power Pellets will cause the ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points.

&quot;Pac-Land&quot; was created by Namco Research and Development 1 programmer Yoshihiro Kishimoto, who was tasked with creating an arcade game based on the American &quot;Pac-Man&quot; cartoon television series by Hanna-Barbera. The backgrounds were made to be vibrant and colorful, and the characters to be detailed and move smoothly to match the show&#x27;s animation style. The control scheme was inspired by Konami&#x27;s &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; (1983), using buttons instead of a traditional joystick to make it stand out among other games at the time. A new Namco Pac-Land arcade system was created to make it easier to develop the game and was used for several later Namco games, including &quot;Baraduke&quot; (1985) and &quot;Metro-Cross&quot; (1985).

&quot;Pac-Land&quot; was a commercial success in arcades, becoming one of the top five highest-grossing arcade games of 1985 in the United States. It was well-received by critics for its colorful graphics, stage designs, and soundtrack, although was often criticized for its difficulty. It is cited as an important and influential game in the platform genre, paving the way for many games to follow such as &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins&quot;, &quot;Alex Kidd&quot; and &quot;Wonder Boy&quot;. It was ported to several home consoles and computers, including the Family Computer, PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16, Commodore 64 and Atari Lynx. It is the first platform game in the &quot;Pac-Man&quot; series, and was followed by &quot;Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures&quot; (1994).

==Gameplay==
Controlling Pac-Man, the player is tasked with reaching the end of each level while avoiding enemies and other obstacles. Stages are known in-game as &quot;trips&quot; and are broken into four sections — the first three have Pac-Man running to return a lost fairy back to &quot;Fairyland&quot;, and the last having Pac-Man return home to his family. Pressing either of the directional buttons will make Pac-Man walk in that direction, and repeatedly tapping either button will make him run. Pac-Man can also jump over pits and obstacles by pressing the jump button.

In each stage, Pac-Man will encounter the four ghosts from the original game — Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde — alongside a purple ghost named Sue, originally a replacement for Clyde in &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot;. Eating large flashing Power Pellets will cause the ghosts to turn blue for a short time, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points. The ghosts are often seen driving vehicles, such as airplanes, buses, cars, pogo-sticks and flying saucers, and will sometimes drop miniature ghost enemies from the air to try and hit Pac-Man. Other types of obstacles are also present in stages, such as water-spewing fire hydrants, springboards, falling logs, quicksand and geysers.

Trips consist of cities, forests, deserts and abandoned castles. Most trip sections end with a large sign saying &quot;BREAK TIME&quot; with a church on a hill in the background, and bonus points are awarded for jumping at certain points at the end of each section. The final section of a trip gives Pac-Man a special pair of boots that will allow him to jump infinitely into the air, and tasks the player with returning home to Pac-Man&#x27;s family. The player can find hidden items by pushing against specific objects in certain stages, including a helmet that protects Pac-Man from falling mini ghosts, an item that makes Pac-Man temporarily invincible and a &quot;Galaxian&quot; flagship that awards the player a large sum of points. Jumping in certain spots will reveal fruit items that can be consumed for points.

The game features the theme song from the &quot;Pac-Man&quot; television series, which plays in a constant loop throughout. The North American version of the game by Midway features the characters being re-designed to more closely resemble the designs found in the show, while the Japanese Namco version has the characters modeled after &quot;Pac-Man&quot; marketing material and cabinet artwork. It&#x27;s currently unknown what version the European version looks like.

==Development and release==
&quot;Pac-Land&quot; was programmed by Yoshihiro Kishimoto of Namco Development Division 1, who would later work on the &quot;Family Stadium&quot; franchise. After seeing the success of Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;Pac-Man&quot; animated series, Namco requested Kishimoto that he create an arcade game based on the show. Kishimoto stated that the hardest part of development were Pac-Man&#x27;s animations. Most arcade games in Japan at the time simply used two or three frames to convey movement, which he found unconvincing. The team wanted the game&#x27;s backgrounds to be vibrant and colorful, and to have the characters move smoothly to replicate the show&#x27;s animation style. Pac-Man himself was given 24 different frame patterns, alongside several facial expressions and clothing swaps.

Kishimoto cited Konami&#x27;s sports video game &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; (1983) as the &quot;number one influence&quot; on &quot;Pac-Land&quot;. The game&#x27;s controls were heavily influenced by &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot;, a game that allowed the player to become faster by constantly tapping the button in succession; Kishimoto thought the idea was interesting and that it would make it stand out among other games. To allow for two-layer scrolling backgrounds, more sprites, and more colors, the team created the Namco Pac-Land arcade board, which was used for several later Namco games including &quot;Baraduke&quot; (1985) and &quot;Metro-Cross&quot; (1985). The game was tested in Yokohama, where Kishimoto recalls the springboards being difficult for new players.

The arcade game was released in Japan in 1984, but there are conflicting release dates. &quot;Arcade TV Game List&quot;, a Japanese-language book of arcade release dates authored by Masumi Akagi and published by the Amusement News Agency in 2006, lists the Japanese release date as August 1984. However, the United States Copyright Office and John Szczepaniak in the second volume of &quot;The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers&quot; (2015), when including biography details taken from Kishimoto&#x27;s resume, lists the release date as October 1984. The game was later released in North America by Bally Midway in December 1984, and in Europe by Atari Games in early 1985.

===Conversions===
The first home port of &quot;Pac-Land&quot; was for Nintendo&#x27;s Family Computer, released in Japan on November 21, 1985. Versions for the Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, MSX, Atari ST and Commodore Amiga were published by British company Grandslam Entertainment in 1988, and developed by Gannon Designs and Mr. Micro (Atari ST and Commodore Amiga versions.) Namco released a PC-Engine version in June 1989, which was later released for the TurboGrafx-16 by NEC in January 1990. Atari Corporation developed and published an Lynx portable version in 1992, and Dempa Softworks released an X68000 conversion in 1994.

&quot;Pac-Land&quot; is in the 1996 compilation &quot;Namco Museum Vol. 4&quot; for the PlayStation alongside five other Namco arcade games from the 1980s, and later in the iOS game &quot;Namco Arcade&quot;. In 2014, it was ported to the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC as part of &quot;Pac-Man Museum&quot;, and the Famicom version was digitally re-released for the Wii U Virtual Console and &quot;Namco Museum Archives Volume 2&quot;. Aside from the &quot;Namco Arcade&quot; version, all home ports of the game are based on the Japanese Namco version. 

On March 31, 2022, it was announced that the arcade version of &quot;Pac-Land&quot; would be released on the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 as part of Hamster Corporation&#x27;s &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; lineup, which was released on April 7, 2022. Though based on the original arcade version, this re-release was modified by Bandai Namco to replace the graphics of Ms. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man, who greet Pac-Man at the end of each trip. In their place are two new characters named &quot;Pac-Mom&quot; and &quot;Pac-Sis&quot;; which were created for the then-upcoming compilation &quot;Pac-Man Museum+&quot;, which also replaced the characters in all the games featured in the collection. Bandai Namco has remained silent on the removal of the characters, though news outlets assumed the character replacements to be related to a dispute between Bandai Namco and AtGames, which is related to &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot;.

The game is included in the &quot;Pac-Man Museum+&quot; game compilation, which released on May 27, 2022. The version in this collection uses the same edited version as seen in the &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; release because of Bandai Namco&#x27;s legal issues with AtGames.

==Reception==
&quot;Pac-Land&quot; was a commercial success in arcades. In Japan, it entered the &quot;Game Machine&quot; arcade charts at number-two on the table arcade cabinet chart in September 1984. In North America, it was in the top 20 &quot;RePlay&quot; upright arcade game charts through November 1985. It ended the year as one of the top five highest-grossing arcade games of 1985 in the United States.

The game well received by critics for its colorful graphics, level structure, and challenge. Mike Roberts gave the arcade game a positive review in the May 1985 issue of &quot;Computer Gamer&quot;. He called it an &quot;interesting game&quot; where Pac-Man is an &quot;animated character that moves along a horizontally scrolling landscape&quot; while praising the &quot;very colouful&quot; graphics and stating it is &quot;easy to play once you&#x27;ve got the hang of it.&quot;

Japanese publication &quot;Famitsu&quot; praised the PC Engine version&#x27;s graphics and overall challenge, awarding it the &quot;Silver Hall of Fame&quot; badge. &quot;Computer + Video Games&quot; called the PC Engine version a &quot;marvelous conversion&quot; for its vibrant visuals, stage layouts, gameplay and accuracy to the coin-op game; they had a similar response for the Atari Lynx version, claiming its accuracy to the original would entice fans of the arcade release. Reviewing the Lynx conversion, &quot;IGN&quot; praised the game&#x27;s colorful graphics, controls and faithfulness to the arcade original. &quot;Raze&quot; echoed a similar response, saying the visuals, stage layouts and soundtrack added replay value to the game.

&quot;Raze&quot; disliked the Lynx port&#x27;s limited amount of lives and lack of continues, saying that the high difficulty would repel younger players. &quot;IGN&quot; stated it provided little replay value for veteran players, adding that it could be easily finished. &quot;AllGame&quot; was particularly critical of the TurboGrafx-16 version, lambasting its poor graphics, bland stage layouts and lack of challenge, jokingly saying it was only recommended to collectors interested in &quot;the most morbidly poor games in existence&quot;. In a retrospective review for the TurboGrafx-16 conversion, &quot;IGN&quot; disliked the game&#x27;s difficulty for lacking any real challenge, and said the game seems to have been made simply to keep &quot;Pac-Man&quot; relevant at the time instead of as a &quot;real deal&quot; game.

==Legacy==
It is considered an important and influential game in the platform genre, paving the way for games such as &quot;Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins&quot;, &quot;Alex Kidd&quot;, and &quot;Wonder Boy&quot;. &quot;Pac-Man&quot; creator Toru Iwatani has since labeled it as his favorite &quot;Pac-Man&quot; sequel for its interesting concept and gameplay. He said Shigeru Miyamoto told him it had a profound influence on the creation of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; Shigeru Miyamoto himself also says that &quot;Pac-Land&quot; had an influence on &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, but to a lesser extent, saying that while he was in Tokyo seeing Namco has developed a platforming game he decided that he should follow suit. The only feature of &quot;Pac-Land&quot; Miyamoto cites as a direct inspiration was the blue background of the game as opposed to the black ones he typically would put in his games.

Shortly after the game&#x27;s release, Namco produced a board game adaptation for its &quot;Fantasy Board Game&quot; series, based on the player reaching the end of the board without losing the &quot;fairy chip&quot;. A Japanese LCD handheld game was released in 1990. Many of Pac-Man&#x27;s moves in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series are directly based on &quot;Pac-Land,&quot; such as his fire hydrant attack. &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Wii U&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; include a stage based on the game, featuring automatic scrolling.

The film spawned the pseudosequel &quot;Life During Wartime&quot;, which premiered at the 2009 Venice Film Festival.

==Plot==
Trish Maplewood, the eldest Jordan sister, is a housewife who lives an upper middle class life. She is married to psychiatrist Bill Maplewood and has three children. Trish is unaware of Bill&#x27;s secret life: he is a homosexual pedophile who is obsessed with 11-year-old Johnny Grasso, a classmate of their son, Billy. When Johnny comes to the Jordan house for a sleepover, Bill drugs and rapes him. Later, Bill learns that another boy, Ronald Farber, is home alone while his parents are away in Europe. Under the guise of attending a PTA meeting, Bill drives to the boy&#x27;s house and rapes him as well. After Johnny is taken to the hospital and found to have been sexually abused, the police arrive at the Maplewood residence to question Bill and his wife. Bill mistakenly asks the officers if this is about Ronald Farber, even though the police only mentioned Johnny&#x27;s name when they arrived, inadvertently implicating himself in an as-yet unknown crime. The next morning the family awakens to the words &quot;serial rapist&quot; and &quot;pervert&quot; spray painted on their house. After school, Billy questions his dad about the things being said at school, and Bill admits that he raped the boys, that he enjoyed it, and that he would do it again. When Billy asks if he would ever rape him, his father tearfully replies, &quot;No... I&#x27;d jerk off, instead.&quot; Trish packs her family into the car the next morning, leaving for her parents&#x27; condo in Florida.

Helen Jordan, the middle sister, is a successful author who is adored and envied by everyone she knows. However, her charmed life leaves her ultimately unfulfilled, she despairs that no one wants her for herself, and that the praise regularly heaped upon her is undeserved. She is fascinated by an unknown man who makes obscene phone calls to her apartment and tries to seek out a relationship with him. She is disappointed, though, when she finds out the man is her neighbor Allen, to whom she is not attracted. Allen, who is coincidentally one of Bill&#x27;s patients, sinks into depression as Helen&#x27;s rejection ruins his fantasies, but he begins a relationship with Kristina, who lives in the same apartment block down the hall. While on a date, Kristina tells him that she killed the apartment doorman after he raped her. Although Kristina repeatedly insists she did not keep the remains of the doorman&#x27;s genitals, Helen reveals that they were discovered by police less than six months later in Kristina&#x27;s freezer.

Joy, the youngest sister, is overly sensitive and lacking direction. She works in telephone sales, but leaves to do something more fulfilling. She gets hired as a scab worker, teaching at an immigrant-education center. Her students do not like her, and she begins to feel empty in that job as well. Joy is also constantly let down in her personal life. After a rejected suitor, Andy, calls Joy shallow at the beginning of the film and then goes on to kill himself, Helen tries to set her up with other men. Expecting to hear from a suitor, she instead gets an obscene call from Allen. Later, one of her Russian students, Vlad, offers her a ride in his taxi, and they end up having sex. She is initially smitten, but she soon realizes Vlad was using her and that he may be married. After being attacked by someone she thinks is his wife at the school, she goes to his apartment to make amends. There she discovers the woman is not his wife after all, even though they live together. In Vlad&#x27;s apartment, Joy sees her missing guitar and CD player. Vlad coerces her into lending him $1000 in exchange for her stolen belongings.

Finally, the sisters&#x27; parents, Mona and Lenny, are separating after 40 years of marriage, but will not get divorced. Lenny is bored with his marriage, but does not want to start another relationship; he simply &quot;wants to be alone.&quot; As Mona copes with being single during her twilight years, Lenny tries to rekindle his enthusiasm for life by having an affair with a neighbor. It is no use, however, as Lenny eventually finds that he has become incapable of feeling. And finally Billy, Trish and Bill&#x27;s son, achieves an orgasm for the first time. He proudly declares this to his family, who respond with confusion.

==Cast==
==Release==
===Controversy===
The film was highly controversial for its heavy subject matter, particularly its portrayal of pedophilia. The Sundance Film Festival refused to screen the film, alleging it to be too disagreeable. October Films was the initial distributor for the film, and helped finance it. However, October Films&#x27; corporate parent Seagram specifically objected to the pedophilia plot line and dropped the film from distribution; Lynn Hirschberg of &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; reported that Ronald Meyer, then the CEO of Universal Pictures, personally blocked October Films from releasing the film, with Solondz later stating that Meyer considered the film &quot;morally objectionable&quot;. Good Machine ended up releasing and distributing the movie on their own. Ironically, Universal ended up owning the rights again, after they bought Good Machine in 2003.

===Rating===
Due to its adult themes, &quot;Happiness&quot; received an NC-17 rating from the MPAA, which caused the film to be limited in distribution; the film also had difficulty in advertising. For that reason, &quot;Happiness&quot; surrendered its NC-17 rating and was instead released unrated.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, and rated it number five in his top 10 films of 1998. In his review, he wrote: &quot;...the depraved are only seeking what we all seek, but with a lack of ordinary moral vision... In a film that looks into the abyss of human despair, there is the horrifying suggestion that these characters may not be grotesque exceptions, but may in fact be part of the mainstream of humanity... It is not a film for most people. It is certainly for adults only. But it shows Todd Solondz as a filmmaker who deserves attention, who hears the unhappiness in the air and seeks its sources.&quot;

In a letter written to playwright Robert Patrick, Quentin Crisp stated, &quot;[&quot;Happiness&quot;] mistook pleasure for happiness and was quite absurd&quot;. In his review in &quot;Time Out New York&quot;, Andrew Johnston observed, &quot;As repulsive as some of the characters are, Solondz makes most of them deeply sympathetic. And every scene works on several levels at once: The film&#x27;s most hilarious moments all have poignant undercurrents, while the saddest--and most disturbing--are frequently sidesplitting at the same time.&quot;

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 85% approval rating based on 52 critic reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;&quot;Happiness&quot; is far from a cheerful viewing experience, but its grimly humorous script and fearless performances produce a perversely moving search for humanity within everyday depravity.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 81 out of 100 based on 30 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

<doc id="865563" wikidata="Q60348" url="?curid=865563" title="Neill S. Brown">
<text>Neill Smith Brown (April 18, 1810January 30, 1886) was an American politician and diplomat who served as the 12th Governor of Tennessee from 1847 to 1849, and as the United States Minister to Russia from 1850 to 1853. He also served several terms in the Tennessee House of Representatives, and was Speaker of the House for the 1855–1857 term. A lifelong Whig, Brown campaigned to keep Tennessee in the Union in the years leading up to the Civil War. However, once the war began, he sided with the Confederacy.

==Early life==
Brown was born in Giles County, Tennessee, the son of Duncan and Margaret Smith Brown. His ancestors were Scots-Irish, and his grandfather, Angus Brown, was a veteran of the American Revolution. His father was an ardent Whig. Brown enrolled in the Manual Labor Academy in Spring Hill, Tennessee, and taught school in Giles County to pay his way. After studying law under Judge James Trimble, he was admitted to the bar in 1834, and briefly practiced in Pulaski, Tennessee.

In 1835, Brown moved to Texas, but quickly grew disillusioned with the lack of organization there, and returned to Tennessee after a few months. In 1836, he fought with the First Tennessee Mounted Volunteers in the Second Seminole War, and eventually rose to the rank of sergeant-major.

==Tennessee politics==

Brown was a founding member of Tennessee&#x27;s Whig Party. He was an elector for Hugh Lawson White in 1836, and campaigned for William Henry Harrison and Henry Clay in the presidential elections of 1840 and 1844, respectively. He was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1837, becoming the legislature&#x27;s youngest member during the 1837-1839 term. In 1843, Brown ran a competitive race against Democratic incumbent Aaron V. Brown (no relation) for the 6th District congressional seat, but was defeated.

In 1847, Brown won the Whig nomination for governor. His opponent was once again Aaron Brown, who had been elected governor in 1845. Aaron Brown, an associate of President James K. Polk, was an ardent supporter of the Mexican–American War, while Neill Brown opposed it. The war was initially popular, but Tennesseans had grown weary of it by 1847, and Neill Brown was able to win the election by a narrow margin. The Whigs also gained control of the state legislature.

During Brown&#x27;s lone term as governor, he oversaw the completion of a state school for the blind in Nashville and a state school for the deaf in Knoxville, both of which were launched during the administration of fellow Whig governor James C. Jones earlier in the decade. Brown also signed a law calling for true public schools to be established throughout the state, but it was left to local governments to implement the provisions of this law, and very little was to come out of it.

The end of the Mexican–American War raised the issue of the expansion of slavery into the newly acquired territory. Brown opposed the Wilmot Proviso, which called for slavery to be banned in all territory acquired as a result of the war, but the division in the national Whig Party on the issue damaged the party&#x27;s image in slave-holding Tennessee. Though Brown fought a competitive campaign in 1849, he was defeated in his bid for reelection by General William Trousdale.

==Minister to Russia==

Following Brown&#x27;s defeat in the Tennessee gubernatorial race of 1849, President Zachary Taylor, at the urging of Tennessee Whig Senator John Bell, appointed Brown U.S. Minister to Russia on May 2, 1850. Brown arrived in St. Petersburg in late July 1850, and was presented to Emperor Nicholas I on August 13, 1850. Unaccustomed to the harsh Russian winter, Brown fell ill just a few months after his arrival, and briefly resigned as minister in January 1851, stating that the Russian climate was &quot;unfitting for the abodes of Man.&quot; Upon his recovery in March 1851, however, he withdrew his resignation.

Brown arrived in Russia at a turbulent time in Russo-American affairs. The Emperor was uneasy about the recent Revolutions of 1848, which consisted largely of democratic revolts against monarchies, and was aware that many Americans sympathized with these revolts. Americans, likewise, were angry over Russia&#x27;s intervention in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and its deposing of pro-democracy leader Lajos Kossuth, and some Americans were calling for intervention on behalf of the revolutionaries. Though Brown personally disapproved of Nicholas&#x27;s actions, he nevertheless warned American leaders that Kossuth was a troublemaker, and argued that American intervention would be disastrous.

Brown had a somewhat pessimistic view of Russian society. He stated that Russians lacked the spirit of invention, and were consistently copying other countries&#x27; innovations in both industry and art. &quot;All they have is borrowed,&quot; he wrote, &quot;except the miserable climate.&quot; While he praised Nicholas&#x27;s work ethic, he thought the emperor micromanaged his various departments. Brown was constantly frustrated by bureaucratic delays, and found Russian censorship of mail and media appalling. He was also puzzled by the rise of slavophilia, which he believed could not compete with western culture.

In spite of his misgivings about Russian society, Brown urged the United States to compete in the vast Russian market. He helped convince the Emperor to abandon an increase in duties on cotton imports, and secured Russian approval of the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty between the U.S. and Britain. In his last weeks in office, Brown expressed concern over the build-up to the Crimean War, and the effect such a conflict might have on U.S. commercial interests.

==Secession crisis, the Civil War and later life==

Upon his return from Russia, Brown resumed his role as a leader of Tennessee&#x27;s Whigs. After the collapse of the national Whig Party, he aligned himself with the American Party (&quot;Know Nothings&quot;), and in 1855 was once again elected to the state House of Representatives, this time representing Davidson County. He was selected as speaker shortly afterward.

In the mid-1850s, Brown campaigned across the state on behalf of presidential candidate Millard Fillmore, but was largely outshone by rising Democratic politician and future Confederate governor Isham Harris, who was campaigning on behalf of James Buchanan. Brown attended the Constitutional Union Party convention in 1860, and helped nominate fellow Tennessean John Bell as the party&#x27;s presidential candidate.

On April 18, 1861, following the attack on Fort Sumter in South Carolina, Brown and several other Whig leaders published a letter reaffirming their pro-Union stance. While they dismissed secession, &quot;both as a constitutional right and as a remedy for existing evils,&quot; they nevertheless stated that Tennessee and other southern states were obliged to defend themselves should federal troops invade.

In May 1861, Oliver Perry Temple, a Whig attorney from Knoxville, met with Brown and several other Whig leaders in Nashville. Temple later recalled that Brown seemed &quot;paralyzed&quot; by the rapid rise of secessionist sentiment in the city, but nevertheless delivered an &quot;eloquent&quot; denunciation of secession. Shortly after this meeting, however, Brown abandoned his support for the Union, and marched with a parade in Nashville in support of the new Confederate States of America. When Union soldiers occupied Nashville in 1862, Brown was jailed and his house was burned.

Following the war, Tennessee&#x27;s radical governor, William Brownlow, ordered the arrest of Isham Harris, and offered a $5,000 reward for his capture. Exiled in England, but longing to return to Tennessee, Harris contacted Brown in 1867, and asked for his help. Brown paid a visit to Brownlow, with whom he had campaigned throughout the 1850s, and appealed for clemency on Harris&#x27;s behalf. Brownlow immediately granted the request and offered Harris immunity, and withdrew the arrest warrant.

Although Brown was not elevated to elective office post-war, his was an influential voice. He served on committees and gave an inspiring, heart-felt speech at the June 1868 Democratic State Convention. Brown also attended the state constitutional convention of 1870, which composed the current Constitution of Tennessee. He also campaigned for his younger brother, John C. Brown, who served as governor of Tennessee from 1871 to 1875.

Brown died on January 30, 1886, and is interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville, Tennessee.

<text>Caprarola is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Viterbo, in the Lazio region of central Italy. The village is situated in a range of volcanic hills known as the Cimini Mounts.

The town is home to the large Renaissance mansion or villa which dominates the surrounding country-side, Villa Farnese (or Villa Caprarola). Not to be confused with the Palazzo Farnese in Rome, it was initially built as a fortress, as the town and the surrounding area was a feud of the House of Farnese, by the cardinal Alessandro Farnese senio in 1530, according to a project of the architect Antonio da Sangallo the Younger. After only four years the project came to a halt when the cardinal was elected pope in 1534 under the name Paul III.

==Filmography==
Villa Farnese was used as film location in many movies and TV series, such as , The Man From Uncle and The Two Popes.

<doc id="865578" wikidata="Q3128275" url="?curid=865578" title="Hatch Act">
<text>The Hatch Act of 1939, An Act to Prevent Pernicious Political Activities, is a United States federal law that prohibits civil-service employees in the executive branch of the federal government, except the president and vice president, from engaging in some forms of political activity. It became law on August 2, 1939. The law was named for Senator Carl Hatch of New Mexico. It was most recently amended in 2012.

==Background==
Widespread allegations that local Democratic Party politicians used employees of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) during the congressional elections of 1938 provided the immediate impetus for the passage of the Hatch Act. Criticism centered on swing states such as Kentucky, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. In Pennsylvania, Republicans and dissident Democrats publicized evidence that Democratic politicians were consulted on the appointment of WPA administrators and case workers and that they used WPA jobs to gain unfair political advantage. In 1938, a series of newspaper articles exposed WPA patronage, and political contributions in return for employment, prompting an investigation by the Senate Campaign Expenditures Committee, headed by Sen. Morris Sheppard, a Texas Democrat.

Despite that investigation&#x27;s inconclusive findings, many in both parties determined to take action against the growing power of the WPA and its chief administrator, Harry Hopkins, an intimate of President Franklin Roosevelt. The Act was sponsored by Senator Carl Hatch, a Democrat from New Mexico. At the time, Roosevelt was struggling to purge the Democratic Party of its more conservative members, who were increasingly aligned with the administration&#x27;s Republican opponents. The president considered vetoing the legislation or allowing it to become law without his signature, but instead signed it on the last day he could do so. His signing message welcomed the legislation as if he had called for it, and emphasized the protection his administration would provide for political expression on the part of public employees.

==Provisions==

The 1939 Act forbids the intimidation or bribery of voters and restricts political campaign activities by federal employees. It prohibits using any public funds designated for relief or public works for electoral purposes. It forbids officials paid with federal funds from using promises of jobs, promotion, financial assistance, contracts, or any other benefit to coerce campaign contributions or political support. It provides that persons below the policy-making level in the executive branch of the federal government must not only refrain from political practices that would be illegal for any citizen, but must abstain from &quot;any active part&quot; in political campaigns, using this language to specify those who are exempt:
* (i) an employee paid from an appropriation for the Executive Office of the President; or
* (ii) an employee appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, whose position is located within the United States, who determines policies to be pursued by the United States in the nationwide administration of Federal laws.

The act also precludes federal employees from membership in &quot;any political organization which advocates the overthrow of our constitutional form of government&quot;, a provision meant to prohibit membership in organizations on the far left and far right, such as the Communist Party USA and the German-American Bund.

An amendment on July 19, 1940, extended the Act to certain employees of state and local governments whose positions are primarily paid for by federal funds. It has been interpreted to bar political activity on the part of employees of state agencies administering federal unemployment insurance programs and appointed local law enforcement agency officials with oversight of federal grant funds. The Hatch Act bars state and local government employees from running for public office if any federal funds support the position, even if the position is funded almost entirely with local funds.

The Merit Systems Protection Board and the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) are responsible for enforcement of the Hatch Act.

==Supreme Court challenges==

The Supreme Court has several times declined to hear challenges to the act and has twice upheld its constitutionality. In a 1947 case brought by the CIO, a divided court found that Congress had properly exercised its authority as long as it had not affected voting rights. Justice William O. Douglas objected to the assertion that &quot;clean politics&quot; required the act&#x27;s restrictions: &quot;it would hardly seem to be imperative to muzzle millions of citizens because some of them, if left to their constitutional freedoms, might corrupt the political process.&quot; In 1973, in a case brought by the National Association of Letter Carriers, a 6 to 3 decision found the act neither too broad nor unclear. The court&#x27;s three most liberal justices, Douglas, William J. Brennan, and Thurgood Marshall, dissented. Douglas wrote: &quot;It is no concern of government what an employee does in his or her spare time, whether religion, recreation, social work or politics is his hobby, unless what he or she does impairs efficiency or other facets of the merits of his job.&quot;

==Amendments==
In 1975, the House passed legislation allowing federal employees to participate in partisan elections and run for office, but the Senate took no action. In 1976, Democrats who controlled Congress had sought to win support by adding protections against the coercion of employees by their superiors and federal employee unions had supported the legislation. It passed the House on a vote of 241 to 164 and the Senate on a vote of 54 to 36. President Ford vetoed the legislation on April 12. He noted that coercion could be too subtle for the law to eliminate and that the Supreme Court had said in 1973 that the Hatch Act had achieved &quot;a delicate balance between fair and effective government and the First Amendment rights of individual employees&quot;. President Carter proposed similar legislation in 1977.

A proposed amendment to permit federal workers to participate in political campaigns passed the House on a 305 to 112 vote in 1987. In 1990, a similar bill passed the House on a vote of 334 to 87 and the Senate on a vote of 67 to 30. President George H. W. Bush vetoed the legislation, which the House voted to override 327 to 93 and the Senate sustained on a vote of 65 to 35, with 55 Democrats and 10 Republicans voting to override and 35 Republicans supporting the president&#x27;s veto.

In 1993 the advocates for removing or modifying restrictions on the political activities of federal employees succeeded in enacting the Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993 (107 Stat. 1001) that removed the prohibition on participation in &quot;political management or political campaigns&quot;. Federal employees are still forbidden to use their authority to affect the results of an election. They are also forbidden to run for office in a partisan election, to solicit or receive political contributions, and to engage in political activities while on duty or on federal property.

President Barack Obama signed the Hatch Act Modernization Act of 2012 on December 28, 2012. It modified penalties under the Hatch Act to allow for disciplinary actions in addition to removal for federal employees; clarified the applicability to the District of Columbia of provisions that cover state and local governments; limited the prohibition on state and local employees running for elective office to employees whose salary is paid completely by federal loans or grants.

==Applicability to U.S. uniformed service personnel==
The Hatch Act does not apply to military members of the uniformed services of the United States, although it does apply to Department of Defense civil servants, as well as Department of Homeland Security civil servants in direct support of the United States Coast Guard. Members of the U.S. Armed Forces are subject to Department of Defense Directive 1344.10 (DoDD 1344.10), &quot;Political Activities by Members of the Armed Forces,&quot; and the spirit and intent of that directive is effectively the same as that of the Hatch Act for Federal civil servants. By agreement between the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security, DoDD 1344.10 also applies to uniformed personnel of the Coast Guard at all times, whether it is operating as a service in the Department of Homeland Security or as part of the Navy under the Department of Defense. As a directive, DoDD 1344.10 is considered to be in the same category as an order or regulation, and military personnel violating its provisions can be considered in violation of Article 92 (Failure to obey order or regulation) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

Members of the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps are subject to specific Health and Human Service regulations found in Title 44, Code of Federal Regulations Part 73 Subpart F. Hatch Act guidelines for NOAA Corps Officers are provided by United States Department of Commerce, Office of the General Counsel, Ethics Law and Program Division. Career members of the Senior Executive Service, administrative law judges, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Corps officers are all subject to Hatch Act restrictions and have additional limitations on their off-duty political activities.

==Recent Hatch Act incidents==
===Bush administration===

* In 2006, the Utah Democratic Party challenged the candidacy of Ogden City Police Chief Jon Greiner for State Senate. The challenge was upheld by the United States Office of Special Counsel (OSC) because the year prior the Ogden City Police Department received a federal grant to help pay for bulletproof vests. Jon Greiner appealed the decision, remained on the ballot, won the election and served one term (2006–2010) as Utah State Senator while the results of the appeal were unknown.
* In January 2007, the OSC announced the results of investigations into whether certain events during the election campaigns of 2004 and 2006 violated the Hatch Act.
** It found no violation when Kennedy Space Center officials allowed Senator John Kerry&#x27;s presidential campaign to use a NASA facility for a 2004 campaign event, because no government employees worked at the facility in question. It found streaming the event to NASA employees and contractors violated the Hatch Act.
** It reviewed a 2006 speech by NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin in which he appeared to endorse Representative Tom DeLay for re-election. It determined that he &quot;should have exercised better judgment&quot; and took no further action.
* In June 2007, the OSC found that Lurita Alexis Doan, Administrator of the General Services Administration, violated the Hatch Act when she took part in a video conference with Karl Rove and other White House officials, and sent letters asking how to help Republican politicians get elected.
* In December 2007, Vigo County Superior Court Judge David Bolk ruled that the mayor-elect of Terre Haute (Indiana) Duke Bennett was covered by the Hatch Act when he was candidate for mayor because he had been director of operations for the Hamilton Center (a medical facility) when he ran for mayor, and the Hamilton Center was receiving federal funding for its Head Start program. Nevertheless, Bennett was allowed to take office, because Judge Bolk ruled that the legal challenge had been brought too late to prevent this. In November 2008 &quot;Indiana Court of Appeals in a 2–1 decision found that the Hatch Act did apply to Bennett and called for a special election to fill the office of Terre Haute mayor.&quot; In June 2009, Indiana Supreme Court ruled that Bennett could remain in office because the challenge had been brought by Bennett&#x27;s opponent after the election, and therefore Bennett was no longer a candidate, but mayor-elect at the time and was no longer in violation of the act.
* On May 6, 2008, FBI agents raided OSC offices and the home office of its director, Scott Bloch. The raids related to an investigation into allegations that Bloch&#x27;s office had attempted to obstruct justice by hiring an outside company to delete computer files beyond recovery in order to prevent authorities from proving Bloch had violated the Hatch Act by retaliating against whistle-blowers in his office, an independent U.S. government agency &quot;charged with protecting the rights of government whistle-blowers&quot;.

===Obama administration===
* On September 13, 2012, the OSC charged Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius with violating the Hatch Act by making a political speech during an official government event. Sebelius later said she had made a mistake and that the error was &quot;technical&quot; in nature.
* On July 18, 2016, the OSC concluded that Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro violated the Hatch Act during an interview with Katie Couric. Castro admitted the violation, but denied any intent to violate the act.
* On October 30, 2016, U.S. Senate Democratic Minority Leader Harry Reid stated that FBI Director James Comey may have violated the Hatch Act by sending a letter to the Congress on October 28, 2016, which stated that the FBI would be reopening its investigation of the Hillary Clinton email controversy. Also on October 30, Richard Painter, a chief White House ethics lawyer for the George W. Bush administration, published an op-ed saying that he had filed a complaint against the FBI with the OSC and with the Office of Government Ethics about the same matter.
* In November 2016, two San Francisco Bay Area federal employees who were elected to school boards were told that they would have to resign their federal positions in order to serve on the boards, as their running for a non-partisan seat that had party political involvement contravened the Hatch Act. Both Jerrold Parsons, President of the John Swett Unified School District, and Mary Ann Nihart, Vice Mayor of Pacifica, chose not to serve in order to retain their federal jobs.

===First Trump administration===
* In June 2017, the OSC issued a warning to White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications Dan Scavino Jr. for an April 2017 tweet that Scavino sent advocating for a primary challenge against U.S. Representative Justin Amash.
* In October 2017, the OSC issued a warning to United States Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley over a June 2017 tweet that she retweeted from President Donald Trump endorsing Republican Congressional candidate Ralph Norman.
* In November 2017, former Office of Government Ethics head Walter Shaub filed a complaint against White House counselor Kellyanne Conway charging that her opposition to Roy Moore opponent Doug Jones during a segment on &quot;Fox and Friends&quot; violated the Hatch Act. In March 2018, the OSC announced that Conway violated the Hatch Act on that occasion and one other.
*In February 2018, FCC Commissioner Michael O&#x27;Rielly, in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, &quot;advocated for the reelection of President Trump in his official capacity as FCC Commissioner&quot;.
* In September 2018, the OSC issued a warning letter to Stephanie Grisham, the Press Secretary and Communications Director for the First Lady of the United States, for violating the act by including Trump&#x27;s campaign slogan in a post on her government Twitter account.
* In November 2018, the OSC ruled that six Trump administration officials violated the Hatch Act in posts to their government Twitter accounts, but declined to take disciplinary action. The OSC warned the officials—Raj Shah, deputy press secretary; Jessica Ditto, deputy director of communications; Madeleine Westerhout, executive assistant to the president; Helen Aguirre Ferré, former director of media affairs; Alyssa Farah, press secretary for the vice president; and Jacob Wood, deputy communications director of the Office of Management and Budget—that future infractions would be interpreted as willful violations subject to further action.
* In June 2019, the OSC sent a letter to President Trump recommending that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway be removed from federal service for repeatedly violating the Hatch Act. This report follows the March 2018 OSC finding that Conway was a &quot;repeat offender&quot; for disparaging Democratic presidential candidates while in her official capacity during televised interviews and on social media. President Trump, when asked at a press conference, stated he thought the provision violated her free speech rights.
*In August 2020, Department of Agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue supported the president&#x27;s re-election while promoting the Farmers to Families Food Box Program; Perdue was fined for violating the Hatch Act.
* In August 2020, President Trump announced that, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, and the move of the 2020 Republican National Convention to a largely online format, he would make his speech accepting the Republican Party nomination for the presidential election from the South Lawn of the White House. In response, the OSC sent a letter to President Trump indicating that, while both the President and Vice President are not covered by the terms of the Hatch Act, White House staffers are, and would therefore not be able to assist with such an address. Moreover, other portions of the Convention included clips recorded at the White House, including an interview with freed hostages, and a naturalization ceremony. While Republicans argued that the South Lawn forms part of the President&#x27;s residence, and therefore should not be classed as part of a federal building, legal experts point out that &quot;[i]t&#x27;s still illegal under the Hatch Act for any White House staffer to participate in executing a campaign photo op/video segment in the White House&quot;. This could also lead to investigations for staffers who may have aided Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (but not Pompeo himself) in his convention activities as he delivered a speech while on official business in Jerusalem.
* As of mid-October 2020, 14 members of the Trump administration had been accused by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington of Hatch Act violations to promote the incumbent&#x27;s re-election. By the beginning of November it was up to 16. Senator Elizabeth Warren&#x27;s staff released a report in which they &quot;counted more than 54 violations of the Hatch Act by 14 administration officials dating back to 2017, as well as nearly 100 additional pending investigations for alleged violations by 22 officials&quot;.
* On November 5, 2020, the United States Office of Special Counsel opened an investigation into the campaign&#x27;s use of the White House for campaign purposes. In January 2021, emails from before the election were reported to feature a &quot;top&quot; Interior department official instructing staff to reference the president&#x27;s account in each post on social media.

===Biden administration===
* In March 2021, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge violated the Hatch Act by signaling support for Democratic candidates for the upcoming 2022 Ohio Senate election. Secretary Fudge received a warning from the Office of Special Counsel for the comments, which said, &quot;If in the future she engages in prohibited political activity we will consider such activity to be a willful and knowing violation of the law that could result in further action.&quot;
* In October 2021, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki was alleged to have violated the Hatch Act by the watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington after she indicated that President Joe Biden supported the candidacy of Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the 2021 Virginia gubernatorial election. The watchdog had previously warned, in a letter to the Biden Administration, that Psaki&#x27;s statement of support in February 2021 for California Governor Gavin Newsom in the 2021 California gubernatorial recall election, while not a Hatch Act violation since the election was not yet certain to occur, was &quot;closer than necessary to the situations the Hatch Act does contemplate&quot;.
* In March 2022, President Biden fired Herschel Walker and Mehmet Oz from their positions on the President&#x27;s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition due to the two being active Republican United States Senate candidates. The terminations were a result of potential Hatch Act violations, as well as a Biden administration policy against allowing federal candidates to serve on presidential boards.
* In October 2022, the Office of Special Counsel found that Ron Klain had violated the Hatch Act and was warned not to do so again. On January 21, 2023, it was reported that Klain would resign as chief of staff in the period following the 2023 State of the Union Address on February 7.
* In November 2022, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre repeatedly used the phrase &quot;MAGA Republicans&quot; during White House press briefings, which the Office of Special Counsel determined was a violation the Hatch Act. The OSC issued a warning letter and did not persue any disciplinary action.
* In July 2023, in response to the 2023 White House cocaine incident during which cocaine was discovered at an entrance area used by visitors, White House staffer Andrew Bates cited the Hatch Act to justify not responding to a question as to whether or not the cocaine belonged to either President Biden or his son, Hunter Biden.
* In September 2024, the OSC found United States Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro violated the Hatch Act after investigating a February 1, 2024 letter in which the Secretary self-reported statements he made about presidential candidates during an official appearance on BBC News Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg aired on January 28, 2024. The OSC also learned that Secretary Del Toro engaged in similar conduct at a separate Q&amp;A session at the Royal United Services Institute that he attended in his official capacity hours before his BBC News Sunday interview.
* in September 2024, Neera Tanden was under investigation for Hatch Act violations for her tweets advocating for partisan political contributions.

==Current restrictions==
===Permitted candidacies===
Federal employees are allowed to be candidates in non-partisan elections, meaning where no candidates are identified by political party. This type of election is used by most municipalities and school boards in the United States.

<doc id="865587" wikidata="Q116428" url="?curid=865587" title="William B. Campbell">
<text>William Bowen Campbell (February 1, 1807 – August 19, 1867) was an American politician and soldier. He served as the 14th governor of Tennessee from 1851 to 1853, and was the state&#x27;s last Whig governor. He also served four terms in the United States House of Representatives, from 1837 to 1843, and from 1866 to 1867.

During the Mexican–American War, Campbell commanded the First Regiment Tennessee Volunteers, known as the &quot;Bloody First&quot; for its high casualty rate. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, Campbell opposed secession, and briefly served as a general in the Union Army.

== Early life ==
Campbell was born on Mansker&#x27;s Creek in Sumner County, Tennessee, to David and Catherine Bowen Campbell. He studied law at Abingdon, Virginia, with his father&#x27;s cousin, Virginia Governor David Campbell, and attended lectures at Winchester Law School. He returned to Tennessee in 1829 in order to establish a law practice at Carthage, in Smith County. He was admitted to the bar in 1830. In 1831, he was appointed attorney general for a state circuit, and moved to Sparta, Tennessee.

== Military and political career ==
In 1835, Campbell moved back to Carthage, and was elected to Smith County&#x27;s seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. He resigned his seat in 1836, however, in order to fight in the Second Seminole War. He served as a captain under Colonel William Trousdale.

In 1837, Campbell successfully ran against Trousdale for the state&#x27;s 6th District seat in the United States House of Representatives. The campaign was &quot;spirited,&quot; though there was no bitterness between the two candidates. In 1839, Campbell ran for reelection, again defeating Trousdale. He ran unopposed in 1841. Near the end of his third term in 1843 he resigned and returned to his law practice in Carthage. That same year, he was appointed major-general of the Tennessee militia.

Upon the outbreak of the Mexican–American War in 1846, Campbell answered Tennessee Governor Aaron V. Brown&#x27;s call for volunteers. He was elected colonel of the First Regiment Tennessee Volunteers on June 3, 1846, and arrived with his regiment in Texas the following month. At the Battle of Monterrey later that year, this company lost one-third of its men in an assault on the town&#x27;s citadel, earning the nickname, the &quot;Bloody First.&quot; Campbell&#x27;s company also saw action at the Siege of Veracruz and the Battle of Cerro Gordo in 1847.

After the war, Campbell was appointed by the legislature to a state circuit court judgeship. In 1851, he received the Whig nomination for governor. His opponent was William Trousdale, his old Seminole War superior, who had been elected in a close election in 1849. Trousdale had endorsed the Nashville Convention of 1850, in which southern states threatened to secede if the federal government attempted to ban slavery in newly acquired territories, and blasted the Compromise of 1850, which admitted California as a free state. He accused Campbell of being &quot;too favorable to northern views.&quot; Campbell on the other hand called the Compromise a &quot;work of wisdom,&quot; and derided the Nashville Convention as treasonous. Running with the campaign slogan, &quot;Boys, follow me!&quot; which he had yelled at the Battle of Monterrey, Campbell edged Trousdale by a vote of 63,333 to 61,673.

As governor, Campbell called for a more rational approach to resolving sectional strife, and demanded an end to the &quot;insane&quot; talk of secession. After his initial term in 1853, he did not run for reelection, instead choosing to accept a position as President of the Bank of Middle Tennessee in Lebanon, Tennessee. The Whigs nominated Gustavus A. Henry, who was defeated by the Democratic candidate Andrew Johnson in the general election.

== Secession and the Civil War ==
Following the collapse of the Whig Party in the mid-1850s, Campbell threw his support behind the American Party (&quot;Know Nothings&quot;), which many Tennessee Whigs had joined. He was again appointed to a circuit court judgeship in 1859, and continued campaigning against secession. In 1860, he supported Constitutional Union Party candidate and fellow Tennessee Whig John Bell for president.

In May 1861, as a wave of pro-secession sentiment swept through Middle Tennessee in the wake of the attack on Fort Sumter, Tennessee&#x27;s ex-Whigs and others opposed to secession convened in Nashville, and nominated Campbell to oppose Isham Harris in the gubernatorial election later that year. Campbell declined this offer, however. Governor Harris offered him a command in the Confederate Army, but he declined this, as well.

In early 1862, after the Union Army occupied Middle Tennessee, Assistant Secretary of War Thomas A. Scott recommended Campbell for military governor, but the appointment went to Andrew Johnson. On May 12, 1862, Campbell chaired a convention of Tennessee Unionists that mapped out a plan to bring the state back into the Union. Shortly afterward, President Abraham Lincoln appointed him brigadier general in the Union Army. He accepted this commission, but resigned in January 1863, in part for health issues, and in part because he did not want to fight against his friends and neighbors.

In 1864, Campbell aligned himself with the Democratic Party, and supported George B. McClellan for the presidency. Though he disagreed with Johnson over several issues, namely election regulations Johnson had installed as military governor, he generally supported the Johnson presidency&#x27;s Reconstruction policies. After the war, Campbell was elected to the state&#x27;s 5th District seat in the House of Representatives, but was prevented by Radical Republicans from taking his seat for several months. Campbell defended Johnson during his impeachment hearings in the House in 1867, and served as an advisor during his trial in the Senate.

== Death ==

Campbell died on August 19, 1867, at his family home of Camp Bell. He is interred at Cedar Grove Cemetery in Lebanon, Tennessee.

== Family ==
William Bowen Campbell was a great-grandson of two early Scots-Irish Virginia pioneers, &quot;Black&quot; David Campbell (b. 1710) and &quot;White&quot; David Campbell (b. 1706). His paternal grandfather, a son of &quot;Black David&quot; known as Captain David Campbell (1753–1832), was an early Knox County pioneer who built Campbell&#x27;s Station, which has evolved into modern Farragut, Tennessee. Captain David Campbell was married to Margaret Campbell, a daughter of &quot;White David.&quot; Her brothers (i.e., William B. Campbell&#x27;s great-uncles) included Colonel Arthur Campbell (1743–1811) and Judge David Campbell (1750–1812), and her nephews included Governor David Campbell (1779–1859) and Colonel John B. Campbell (1777–1814). She was a cousin of General William Campbell of Kings Mountain fame.

Campbell&#x27;s mother, Catherine Bowen, was a granddaughter of General William Russell (1735–1793), who had helped draft the Declaration of Independence. The house built in 1787 by Campbell&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Captain William Bowen (1742–1804), still stands in modern Goodlettsville, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Bowen-Campbell House. A house built by Campbell&#x27;s uncle, John Henry Bowen (1770–1822), still stands in Gallatin, and is listed on the National Register as the Trousdale Place. After his uncle&#x27;s death, the house was, ironically, purchased by William Trousdale, Campbell&#x27;s future gubernatorial opponent.

Campbell married Frances Owen in 1835. They had seven children: Mary, Margaret, Fanny, William, Joseph, John Owen, and Lemuel.

== Honors and awards ==

<doc id="865588" wikidata="Q886210" url="?curid=865588" title="Arthur Chichester, 1st Marquess of Donegall">
<text>Arthur Chichester, 1st Marquess of Donegall (13 June 1739 – 5 January 1799), known as Arthur Chichester until 1757 and as The Earl of Donegall between 1757 and 1791, was an English nobleman and politician in Ireland.

==Early life==

Chichester was born on 13 June 1739. He was the son of Hon. John Chichester and Elizabeth Newdigate (1703–1769), eldest daughter of Sir Richard Newdigate, 3rd Baronet. His paternal grandparents were Arthur Chichester, 3rd Earl of Donegall, and Lady Catherine Forbes (a daughter of the 1st Earl of Granard), in 1726.

He was educated at Westminster School in 1748 and Trinity College, Oxford, matriculating in 1757, before succeeding his uncle in 1757 as fifth Earl of Donegall.

==Career==
After taking his seat in the Irish House of Lords in 1765, Donegall served at Westminster as Member of Parliament for Malmesbury (1768–1774) by his friend Lord Suffolk, first following Suffolk and the Grenville group. Reportedly, he never spoke in the House, and did not stand for reelection in 1774.

As a means of securing his support for the Government in the Irish House of Commons, he was in 1790 created Baron Fisherwick, of Fisherwick in the County of Stafford, in the Peerage of Great Britain. The following year he was also created Earl of Belfast and Marquess of Donegall in the Peerage of Ireland.

==Personal life==

Lord Donegall married three times. On 11 September 1761, he married Lady Anne Hamilton, daughter of James Hamilton, 5th Duke of Hamilton. Before her death on 11 November 1780, they had seven children:

* Lady Charlotte Anne Chichester (b. 1762), who died in infancy.
* Lady Henrietta Chichester (b. 1765), who died in infancy.
* George Chichester, 2nd Marquess of Donegall (1769–1844), who married Anna May, daughter of Sir Edward May, 2nd Baronet, in 1795.
* Hon. Arthur Chichester (1771–1788), who died young.
* Lord Spencer Stanley Chichester (1775–1819), MP for Belfast and Carrickfergus who married Lady Anne Harriet Stewart, daughter of John Stewart, 7th Earl of Galloway, in 1795.
* Lady Elizabeth Juliana Chichester (d. 1787)
* Lady Amelia Chichester, who died in infancy.

On 24 October 1788 he married Charlotte Moore (née Spencer), daughter of Conway Spencer, and widow of Thomas Moore. She died, without issue, on 19 September 1789.

In October 1790, he married Barbara Godfrey, daughter of the Rev. Dr. Luke Godfrey, Rector of Midleton, County Cork.

Lord Donegall held on lease a country residence at Butley Priory, Suffolk. He died on 5 January 1799, aged 59, at his London home in St James&#x27;s Square, Westminster. His widow, the dowager Marchioness of Donegall, died on 28 December 1829.

<text>Cape Morris Jesup () is a headland in Peary Land, Greenland.

==Geography==
Cape Morris Jesup is the northernmost point of mainland Greenland, the northernmost point of any mainland, and the northernmost land point on Earth except for the small island of Kaffeklubben (and perhaps some other formations which may be islands or may just be temporary gravel banks).

The cape is from the geographic North Pole. It is located in Johannes V. Jensen Land, about east of the mouth of Sands Fjord and west of Constable Bay. The cape marks the limit between the Lincoln Sea to the west and the Wandel Sea to the east. About southeast of the cape there is a river forming a small delta that flows from the Mary Peary Peaks, part of the Roosevelt Range to the south.

===Climate===
==History==
Robert Peary reached the cape on 13 May 1900, believing it to be the northernmost point of land in the world, although it was later found to lie slightly to the south of the northernmost tip of Kaffeklubben Island. The cape is named after American philanthropist Morris Ketchum Jesup, president of the Peary Arctic Club, who helped finance Peary&#x27;s expeditions.

==Plants==

Specimens of Arctic poppy and purple saxifrage have been found growing in the thin, rocky soil.
Cape Morris Jesup is practically a polar desert with roughly 30-day summers. Despite these extremely inhospitable conditions, these two tiny flowering plants eke out a meager existence and persist blooming through summer lows near freezing temperatures.

<doc id="865595" wikidata="Q4697919" url="?curid=865595" title="Air and Space Longevity Service Award">
<text>The Air and Space Longevity Service Award (ASLSA) is a military award of the United States Air Force and United States Space Force established as the Air Force Longevity Service Award by Air Force General Order 60, on 25 November 1957 by General Thomas D. White, Air Force Chief of Staff. The award was primarily created as an air force equivalent to the service stripes used by other branches of the United States military to denote years of military service. The award is retroactive to the establishment of the U.S. Air Force as an independent service in September 1947. The ribbon is also retroactive for any service with the U.S. Army Air Forces, U.S. Army Air Corps, or U.S. Army Air Service prior to the creation of the U.S. Air Force as a separate service as long as the serviceman was on active duty on or after 18 September 1947. On 16 November 2020, the Air Force Longevity Service Award was renamed to the Air and Space Longevity Service Award by the Secretary of the Air Force.

==Criteria==
The Air and Space Longevity Service Award is awarded for completing four years of Active, Air Force Reserve, or Air National Guard service. For members of the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard, creditable service must have been in a drilling status with regular attendance of at least minimum monthly weekend drills and annual training. Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard mobilized to full-time active duty continue to accrue eligibility in the same manner as active duty Air Force personnel. Service as a student at a United States service academy, typically the USAF Academy, is also creditable so long as the member graduated. The ribbon is awarded to both officers and enlisted personnel, in contrast to service stripes which are only provided to enlisted members of the military.

==Appearance==
The Air and Space Longevity Service Award is a ribbon-only award. It is ultramarine blue divided by four equal stripes of grotto blue. Oak leaf clusters are worn on the ribbon to indicate subsequent awards of the Air Force Longevity Service Award.

<text>Majorcan Union (; ) was a regional liberal party on the island of Majorca, Spain.
It was founded in October 1982, as a nationalist continuation of the then disintegrating Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD). The main founder was Jeroni Albertí Picornell.

In 1993 it merged with the &quot;Unió Independent de Mallorca&quot; and &quot;Convergència Balear&quot;. Subsequently, it forged alliances with &quot;Independents per Menorca&quot; and &quot;Unió Centristes de Menorca&quot;.

As a centre party, it supported People&#x27;s Party governments (1987) in the Balearic Islands but also the left-wing coalition, led by the socialist Francesc Antich (Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party, PSOE), which replaced the People&#x27;s Party in 1999. UM was once again was the key element in returning the presidency to Francesc Antich after the regional elections to the Balearic Island parliament held in 2007.

&quot;Unió Mallorquina&quot; was a member of Liberal International. The last president was Josep Melià i Ques

Following a number of corruption scandals, the party decided to disband in February 2011 and establish a new party, Convergence for the Isles (Convergència per les Illes).

<doc id="865604" wikidata="Q130715" url="?curid=865604" title="Isham G. Harris">
<text>Isham Green Harris (February 10, 1818July 8, 1897) was an American and Confederate politician who served as the 16th governor of Tennessee from 1857 to 1862, and as a U.S. senator from 1877 until his death. He was the state&#x27;s first governor from West Tennessee. A pivotal figure in the state&#x27;s history, Harris was considered by his contemporaries the person most responsible for leading Tennessee out of the Union and aligning it with the Confederacy during the Civil War.

Harris rose to prominence in state politics in the late 1840s when he campaigned against the anti-slavery initiatives of northern Whigs. He was elected governor amidst rising sectional strife in the late 1850s, and following the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, persistently sought to sever the state&#x27;s ties with the Union. His war-time efforts eventually raised over 100,000 soldiers for the Confederate cause. After the Union Army gained control of Middle and West Tennessee in 1862, Harris spent the remainder of the war on the staffs of various Confederate generals. Following the war, he spent several years in exile in Mexico and England.

After returning to Tennessee, Harris became a leader of the state&#x27;s Bourbon Democrats. During his tenure in the U. S. Senate, he championed states&#x27; rights and currency expansion. As the Senate&#x27;s president pro tempore in the 1890s, Harris led the charge against President Grover Cleveland&#x27;s attempts to repeal the Sherman Silver Purchase Act.

==Early life and career==
Harris was born in Franklin County, Tennessee near Tullahoma. He was the ninth child of Isham Green Harris, a farmer and Methodist minister, and his wife Lucy Davidson Harris. His parents had moved from North Carolina to Middle Tennessee in 1806. He was educated at Carrick Academy in Winchester, Tennessee, until he was fourteen. He moved to Paris, Tennessee, where he joined up with his brother William R. Harris, an attorney, and became a store clerk. In 1838, with funds provided by his brother, Harris established his own business in Ripley, Mississippi, an area that had only been recently opened to settlers after a treaty with the Chickasaw Indians.

While in Ripley, Harris studied law. He sold his successful business three years later for $7,000 and returned to Paris where he continued studying law under Judge Andrew McCampbell. On May 3, 1841, he was admitted to the bar in Henry County and began a lucrative practice in Paris. He was considered one of the leading criminal attorneys in the state.

On July 6, 1843, Harris married Martha Mariah Travis (nicknamed &quot;Crockett&quot;), the daughter of Major Edward Travis, a War of 1812 veteran. The couple had seven sons. By 1850 the family had a farm and a home in Paris. By 1860 their total property was worth $45,000 (~$ in ) and included twenty slaves and a plantation in Shelby County.

In 1847, Henry County Democrats convinced Harris to run for the district&#x27;s Tennessee Senate seat in hopes of countering a strong campaign by local Whig politician William Hubbard. Anti-war comments made in August by the district&#x27;s Whig congressional candidate, William T. Haskell, damaged Hubbard&#x27;s campaign, and he quit the race. Harris easily defeated the last minute Whig replacement, Joseph Roerlhoe. Shortly after taking his seat, he sponsored a resolution condemning the Wilmot Proviso, which would have banned slavery in territories acquired during the Mexican–American War.

In 1848, Harris was an elector for unsuccessful presidential candidate Lewis Cass. In May of that year, he engaged in a six-hour debate in Clarksville with Aaron Goodrich, elector for Zachary Taylor.

Harris was nominated as the Democratic candidate for the state&#x27;s 9th District seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1849. After successfully tying his opponent to unpopular positions of the national Whig Party, Harris won the election easily. He spent much of his term attacking the Compromise of 1850, though he also chaired the House Committee on Invalid Pensions. Harris was re-elected to a second term, but after Whigs gained control of the state legislature in 1851, his district was gerrymandered, and he did not seek a third term.

==Governor of Tennessee==
In 1856, Harris was chosen as the presidential elector for the state&#x27;s at-large district, a position that required him to canvass the state on behalf of Democratic candidate James Buchanan. He largely outshone the district&#x27;s Whig elector, ex-Governor Neill S. Brown. This campaign elevated Harris to statewide prominence.

In 1857, Tennessee&#x27;s Democratic governor, Andrew Johnson, was seriously injured in a train accident and was unable to run for reelection. Harris was nominated as his replacement and embarked on a campaign that included a series of debates with his opponent, Robert H. Hatton. With sectional strife in Congress fueling both campaigns, these debates were often heated, and fights frequently broke out among spectators (and in one instance, between Harris and Hatton). Hatton was unable to distance himself from northern abolitionists, and Harris won the election by a vote of 71,178 to 59,807.

Harris&#x27;s victory was not only the death knell for the state&#x27;s Know Nothings, who had briefly risen to prominence following the collapse of the national Whig Party, but also represented a shift in Tennessee politics toward the Democratic Party. During the previous two decades, Whigs and Democrats had been evenly matched statewide, with Whigs controlling East Tennessee, Democrats controlling Middle Tennessee, and the two parties evenly split in West Tennessee. The nationwide debate over the Kansas–Nebraska Act and the Dred Scott case pushed the issue of slavery to the forefront in the mid-1850s, and the balance in West Tennessee was tipped in favor of the Democrats. Harris&#x27;s 11,000 vote victory was relatively large, considering his predecessor, Johnson, had won by just over 2,000 votes in both 1853 and 1855.

In 1859, Harris ran for reelection against John Netherland, who had been nominated by a hodge-podge group of ex-Whigs, ex-Know Nothings, and disgruntled Democrats, known as the Opposition Party. Harris again campaigned on fears of northern domination, while Netherland argued that the U.S. Constitution provided the best protection for Southern rights, and thus it was in the state&#x27;s interest to remain in the Union. On election day, Harris prevailed by over 8,000 votes. The Opposition Party, however, showed its strength by capturing 7 of the state&#x27;s 10 congressional seats.

==Secession and the Civil War==
Harris endorsed John C. Breckinridge for president in 1860, and warned that the state must consider secession if the &quot;reckless fanatics of the north&quot; should gain control of the federal government. Following Lincoln&#x27;s election in November, Harris convened a special session of the legislature on January 7, 1861, which ordered a statewide referendum on whether or not Tennessee should consider secession. Pro-Union newspapers assailed Harris&#x27;s actions as treasonous. The Huntingdon &quot;Carroll Patriot&quot; wrote that Harris was more deserving of the gallows than Benedict Arnold. William &quot;Parson&quot; Brownlow, editor of the &quot;Knoxville Whig&quot;, particularly despised Harris, calling him &quot;Eye Sham&quot; and &quot;King Harris,&quot; and slammed his actions as autocratic. When the referendum was held in February, Tennesseans rejected secession by a vote of 68,000 to 59,000.

Following the Battle of Fort Sumter in April 1861, President Lincoln ordered Harris to furnish 50,000 soldiers for the suppression of the rebellion. Reading his response to Lincoln before a raucous crowd in Nashville on April 17, Harris said, &quot;Not a single man will be furnished from Tennessee,&quot; and stated he would rather cut off his right arm than sign the order. On April 25, Harris addressed a special session of the state legislature, stating that the Union had been destroyed by the &quot;bloody and tyrannical policies of the Presidential usurper,&quot; and called for an end to the state&#x27;s ties to the United States. Shortly afterward, the legislature authorized Harris to enter into a compact with the new Confederate States of America.

In May 1861, Harris began organizing and raising soldiers for what would become the Army of Tennessee. That same month, a steamboat, the &quot;Hillman&quot;, which was carrying a shipment of lead to Nashville from St. Louis, was seized by the Governor of Illinois. In response, Harris seized $75,000 (~$ in ) from the customs office in Nashville. On June 8, 1861, Tennesseans voted in favor of the Ordinance of Secession, 104,913 to 47,238. A group of pro-Union leaders in East Tennessee, which had rejected the Ordinance, petitioned Harris to allow the region to break away from the state and remain with the Union. Harris rejected this, and sent troops under Felix K. Zollicoffer into East Tennessee. In the gubernatorial election later that year, William H. Polk, brother of former President James K. Polk, ran against Harris on a pro-Union ticket but was defeated 75,300 to 43,495.

The Union Army invaded Tennessee in November 1861 and had gained control of Nashville by February of the following year. Harris and the state legislature moved to Memphis, but after that city fell, Harris joined the staff of General Albert Sidney Johnston. At the Battle of Shiloh on April 6, Harris found Johnston slumping in his saddle and asked if he was wounded, to which Johnston replied &quot;Yes, and I fear seriously.&quot; Harris and other staff officers moved the general to a small ravine and attempted to render aid, but Johnston died within a few minutes. Harris and the others secretly moved his body to Shiloh Church so as not to dampen the morale of Confederate troops.

Harris spent the remainder of the war as an aide-de-camp on the staffs of various Confederate generals, among them Joseph E. Johnston, Braxton Bragg, John B. Hood, and P. G. T. Beauregard. Andrew Johnson was appointed military governor by President Lincoln in March 1862, though Harris was still recognized as governor by the Confederacy. In 1863, Tennessee&#x27;s Confederates elected Robert L. Caruthers as a successor to Harris, but Caruthers never took office. Harris was still issuing edicts as governor as late as November 1864.

After the war, the United States Congress passed a joint resolution allowing the governor of Tennessee to offer a reward for the apprehension of Harris because he was &quot;guilty of treason, perjury and theft&quot;. Brownlow, who had become governor, issued a warrant for the arrest of Harris
and placed a $5,000 bounty on him. Brownlow taunted Harris in the warrant, stating, &quot;His eyes are deep and penetrating—a perfect index to a heart of a traitor—with the scowl and frown of a demon resting upon his brow. His study of mischief and the practice of crime have brought upon him premature baldness and a gray beard.&quot; He further noted that Harris &quot;chews tobacco rapidly and is inordinately fond of liquors.&quot;

Harris fled to Mexico, where he and several other ex-Confederates attempted to rally with Emperor Maximilian. After Maximilian&#x27;s fall in 1867, however, Harris was again forced to flee, this time to England. Later that year, after learning Brownlow would rescind the warrant, Harris returned to Tennessee. Passing through Nashville, he called on Brownlow, who is said to have greeted him with the statement, &quot;While the lamp holds out to burn, the vilest sinner may return.&quot; Afterward, he returned to Memphis to practice law.

==United States Senate==
By 1877, the Tennessee state legislature, which was once again controlled by Democrats, elected Harris to one of the state&#x27;s U.S. Senate seats. One of his earliest assignments, in the 46th Congress (1879–81), was the District of Columbia Committee. Subsequent assignments included the Committee on Epidemic Diseases in the 49th Congress through the 52nd Congress (1885–93) and the Committee on Private Land Claims in the 54th Congress (1895–97).

During his first term in the Senate, Harris became the leader of Tennessee&#x27;s Bourbon Democrats, a wing of the Democratic Party that generally supported laissez-faire capitalism and the gold standard. As such, Harris spent his early Senate career advocating strict constructionism and limited government, states&#x27; rights, and low tariffs. In 1884, he was interviewed by President-elect Grover Cleveland for a cabinet position. In 1887, he gave an impassioned speech in favor of the repeal of the Tenure of Office Act. In 1890, Harris denounced the Lodge Bill, which would have protected voting rights for African-Americans in the South, arguing that it violated states&#x27; rights.

Though a Bourbon Democrat, Harris, representing an agrarian state, was also a &quot;Silver Democrat&quot;, believing pro-silver policies protected farmers. He supported the Bland–Allison Act of 1878, which authorized the federal government to purchase silver to prevent deflation in crop prices. He also supported the act&#x27;s replacement, the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890. In 1893, President Cleveland, concerned that the Sherman Act was depleting the U.S. gold supply, sought its repeal. When the vote came up in the Senate in October, Harris, as president pro tempore, launched a filibuster in hopes of preventing the act&#x27;s repeal, but was unsuccessful. Disgruntled over the repeal of the Sherman Act, Harris campaigned for unsuccessful presidential candidate and gold standard opponent William Jennings Bryan in 1896.

==Death==
Harris died in office on July 8, 1897. His funeral was held in the Senate chamber of the United States Capitol. Congressman Walter P. Brownlow, a nephew of Harris&#x27; old rival Parson Brownlow, was among those who delivered a memorial address in his honor. He is interred at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.

<text>The Quatermass Xperiment (a.k.a. The Creeping Unknown in the United States) is a 1955 British science fiction horror film from Hammer Film Productions, based on the 1953 BBC Television serial &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; written by Nigel Kneale. The film was produced by Anthony Hinds, directed by Val Guest, and stars Brian Donlevy as the titular Professor Bernard Quatermass and Richard Wordsworth as the tormented Carroon. Jack Warner, David King-Wood, and Margia Dean appear in co-starring roles.

The film concerns three astronauts who have been launched into space aboard a single-stage-to-orbit rocket designed by Professor Quatermass. It crashlands with only one of its original crew, Victor Carroon (Richard Wordsworth), still aboard. He begins mutating into an alien organism, which, if it spawns, will engulf the Earth and destroy humanity. After Carroon escapes from custody Quatermass and Inspector Lomax (Jack Warner) of Scotland Yard have just hours to track him/it down and prevent a catastrophe.

Like its source TV serial, the film was a major success in the UK. It also brought public attention to Hammer Film Productions around the world. The film was released in the United States in a double feature with &quot;The Black Sleep&quot;.

==Plot==

The British-American Rocket Group, headed by Professor Bernard Quatermass, launches its first crewed rocket into outer space. All contact is soon lost with the rocket and its three-man crew: Carroon, Reichenheim and Green. The rocket later returns to Earth, crashing into an English country field. Quatermass and his assistant Marsh arrive at the scene. With them are the local emergency services, Carroon&#x27;s wife Judith, Rocket Group physician Dr. Briscoe and Blake, a Ministry official who chides Quatermass for launching the rocket without official permission. When the rocket&#x27;s hatch is opened, Carroon stumbles out in shock, only able to say the words, &quot;Help me&quot;. Inside the rocket, Quatermass and Marsh find only the fastened but empty spacesuits of Reichenheim and Green.

Carroon is taken to Briscoe&#x27;s laboratory facility on the grounds that conventional hospitals would have no idea how to treat Carroon, now suffering from an adverse outer space event. Under Briscoe&#x27;s care, Carroon remains mute, generally immobile, but alert. Briscoe discovers a disfigured area on Carroon&#x27;s shoulder and notices changes in his face, suggesting a mutation of the underlying bone structure. Meanwhile, Scotland Yard Inspector Lomax undertakes investigation of Reichenheim and Green&#x27;s disappearance and, having fingerprinted Carroon as a suspect, alerts Quatermass that the prints are nothing human.

Judith thinks that Briscoe is not helping her husband, so Quatermass agrees to have Carroon transferred to a regular hospital, under guard. Marsh, meanwhile, develops the film from the rocket&#x27;s camera, and Quatermass, Lomax and Briscoe watch it. The crew are seen at their duties, until something seems to buffet the ship. After that, there is a wavering distortion of the cabin&#x27;s atmosphere, and the men react as if something invisible is there with them. One by one they collapse, Carroon being the last.

Something living in outer space entered the spaceship, dissolved Reichenheim and Green in their spacesuits, and entered Carroon, who is being transformed by this entity. Not knowing any of this, Judith hires private investigator Christie to break Carroon out of the hospital. Meanwhile, Carroon smashes a potted cactus in his hospital room, which fuses to his flesh. In the lift, he kills Christie and absorbs the latter&#x27;s life force, leaving a shrivelled husk. Judith discovers what is happening to Carroon, who disappears into the night, leaving her unharmed, but traumatized.

Inspector Lomax initiates a manhunt for Carroon, who goes to a nearby pharmacy and kills its chemist, using his cactus-thorn-riddled hand and arm as a cudgel and leaving a twisted, empty man-husk to be found by the police. Quatermass theorizes that Carroon has taken select chemicals to &quot;speed up a change going on inside of him&quot;. After hiding on a river barge, Carroon encounters a little girl, but leaves her unharmed. That night, he hides in the zoo, now with less of his human form remaining. In the morning, scattered animal carcasses are found, their life forces having been absorbed, with a slime trail leading away from the zoo. Among the bushes, Quatermass and Briscoe find a small but living remnant of Carroon and take it back to their laboratory. Following an examination, Quatermass concludes that some kind of predatory alien life has taken over and will release reproduction spores, endangering the planet.

The remnant, having now grown much larger, breaks out of its glass cage, but dies of starvation on the floor. On a police tip from a vagrant, Lomax and his men track the Carroon mutation to Westminster Abbey, where it crawled high up on a metalwork scaffolding. It is now a gigantic mass of combined animal and plant tissue with eyes, distended nodules, and tentacle-like fronds filled with spores. Quatermass orders London&#x27;s electrical power centres be combined and the generated power diverted to the Abbey. Heavy duty electrical cable is run and attached to the bottom of the metal scaffolding. The creature is incinerated in the electrocution before it can release its spores.

The threat eliminated, Quatermass walks out of the Abbey, ignoring all who ask questions. Marsh eventually approaches and asks &quot;What are you going to do?&quot; Quatermass replies, &quot;I&#x27;m going to start again&quot;. He leaves Marsh behind, walking off into the dark. Later, a second rocketship roars into outer space.

===Development===
&quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; was originally a six-part TV serial broadcast by BBC Television in 1953. Written by Nigel Kneale, it was an enormous success with critics and audiences alike, later described by film historian Robert Simpson as &quot;event television, emptying the streets and pubs&quot;. Among its viewers was Hammer Films producer Anthony Hinds, who was immediately keen to buy the rights for a film version. Incorporated in 1934, Hammer had developed a niche for itself making second features, many of which were adaptations of successful BBC Radio productions. Hammer contacted the BBC on 24 August 1953, two days after the transmission of the final episode, to inquire about the film rights. Nigel Kneale also saw the potential for a film adaptation and, at his urging, the BBC touted the scripts around a number of producers, including the Boulting Brothers and Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat. Kneale met with Sidney Gilliat to discuss the scripts but Gilliat was reluctant to buy the rights as he felt any film adaptation would inevitably receive an &#x27;X&#x27; Certificate from the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC), restricting admission to persons over the age of sixteen. Hammer was not so reticent, deciding from the outset that they would deliberately pursue an &#x27;X&#x27; Certificate. Hammer&#x27;s offer met some resistance within the BBC, with one executive expressing reservations that &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; was not suitable material for the company, but the rights were nevertheless sold for an advance of £500.

Nigel Kneale was a BBC employee at the time, which meant that his scripts were owned entirely by the BBC. He received no extra payment for the sale of the film rights. This became a matter of some resentment on Kneale&#x27;s part, and when his BBC contract came up for renewal he demanded and secured control over any future film rights for his work. Despite this, Kneale remained bitter over the affair until the BBC made an &quot;ex-gratia&quot; payment of £3,000 to him in 1967, in recognition of his creation of Quatermass.

The film was co-produced by Robert L. Lippert, an American film producer and distributor. Hammer had entered into an arrangement with Lippert in 1951 under which Lippert provided finance and supplied American stars for Hammer&#x27;s films and distributed them in the United States. In return Hammer&#x27;s distribution arm, Exclusive Films, distributed Lippert&#x27;s films in the United Kingdom. Quota laws in the UK meant that US films had to have a British supporting feature, so it was in the American studios&#x27; interests to fund these features to recover a greater proportion of the box office receipts.

===Writing===
The first draft of the screenplay was written by Richard Landau, an American provided by Lippert who had worked on six previous Lippert-Hammer productions, including &quot;Spaceways&quot; (1953), one of the company&#x27;s first forays into science fiction. Landau made significant changes in condensing the action to less than half the length of the original teleplay. The opening thirty minutes of the television version are covered in just two minutes in the Hammer film. In the process Landau played up the horror elements of Kneale&#x27;s original teleplay. Aware that the film would be co-funded by American backers, Landau added a transatlantic dimension to the script: Quatermass&#x27;s &quot;British Rocket Group&quot; became the &quot;British-American Rocket Group&quot; and the character of his assistant, Briscoe, was rewritten as a US Air Force flight surgeon. Quatermass himself was demoted to a doctor and written much more as an action hero than the thoughtful scientist created by Nigel Kneale. Some characters from the television version, such as the journalist James Fullalove, are omitted altogether. Judith Carroon&#x27;s role in the film version is reduced to little more than that of the stricken astronaut&#x27;s anxious wife, whereas in the television version she is also a prominent member of Quatermass&#x27;s Rocket Group. A subplot involving an extramarital affair between her and Briscoe is also left out of the film version. Kneale was particularly aggravated by the dropping from his original teleplay the notion that Carroon has absorbed not only the bodies but also the memories and the personalities of his two fellow astronauts. This change leads to the most significant difference between the two versions: in the television version, Quatermass makes a personal appeal to the last vestiges that remain of the three absorbed astronauts to make the creature commit suicide before it can spore, whereas in the film version Quatermass kills the creature by electrocution. Director Val Guest defended this change believing it was &quot;filmically a better end to the story&quot;. He also felt it unlikely that Brian Donlevy&#x27;s gruff interpretation of Quatermass would lend itself to talking the creature into submission.

Having fallen foul of the censors with some of their earlier films, Hammer had an informal agreement to submit scripts in advance of shooting for comment by the BBFC. When the draft script for &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot; was submitted, Board Secretary Arthur Watkins replied: &quot;I must warn you at this stage that, while we accept this story in principle for the &#x27;X&#x27; category, we could not certificate, even in that category, a film treatment in which the horrific element was so exaggerated as to be nauseating and revolting to adult audiences&quot;. The BBFC were particularly concerned with the violence in the scenes where Carroon escapes from hospital and with how graphic the depiction would be of Caroon&#x27;s transformation into the alien creature.

The script was then much revised by director Val Guest, who cut 30 pages from Landau&#x27;s script and enhanced suspense over graphic horror. One of Guest&#x27;s key script contributions was to tailor the dialogue to suit the brusque style of star Brian Donlevy. With an American actor cast as Quatermass, Guest reverted Briscoe to a British character and reinstated Quatermass&#x27;s title of professor. Guest also adapted some sections of the script in response to the concerns of the BBFC. Further stylistic changes were sought by the BBC, who retained a script approval option after the sale of the rights and asked Nigel Kneale to work on their suggested changes, much to his indignation. Kneale was tasked with rewriting any scenes featuring BBC announcers to match the BBC&#x27;s news reporting style.

===Casting===
Irish-American actor Brian Donlevy was brought in by Robert L. Lippert to play the title role of Quatermass to provide an interest for American audiences. Donlevy, in his own words, specialised in &quot;he-men roles – rough, tough and realistic&quot;. Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for &quot;Beau Geste&quot; (1939), he was also known for his appearances in &quot;The Great McGinty&quot; (1940) and &quot;The Glass Key&quot; (1942). At the time he appeared as Quatermass, his career was in decline, however. Donlevy&#x27;s no-nonsense portrayal of Quatermass is very different from that of Reginald Tate in the television version. It was not to Nigel Kneale&#x27;s liking, who said: &quot;I may have picked Quatermass&#x27;s surname out of a phone book, but his first name was carefully chosen: Bernard, after Bernard Lovell, the creator of Jodrell Bank. Pioneer, ultimate questing man. Donlevy played him as a mechanic, a creature with a completely closed mind&quot;. Responding to Kneale&#x27;s criticisms, Val Guest said that &quot;Nigel Kneale was expecting to find Quatermass like he was on television, a sensitive British scientist, not some American stomping around, but to me Donlevy gave it absolute reality&quot;. By this stage in his career, Donlevy was suffering from alcoholism; it was some weeks into the shoot before Guest became aware that the flask of coffee he always carried on set was laced with brandy. Guest found, however, that &quot;Brian was all right, no problem at all once you kept him sober&quot;. He reprised the role of Quatermass in &quot;Quatermass 2&quot; (1957) but was replaced by Andrew Keir in the third film, &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; (1967).

Inspector Lomax was played by Jack Warner, who appeared by arrangement with the J. Arthur Rank Organisation, with whom he was contracted. At the time, he was best known as the star of &quot;Here Come the Huggetts&quot; (1948) and its sequels. Shortly after finishing &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot;, he made his first appearance on television in the role he is most associated with: the title character in &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot; (1955–76). Warner plays Lomax in a lighthearted fashion and there is a running joke in the film involving Lomax&#x27;s futile attempts to find the time to have a shave with his electric razor.

Richard Wordsworth was cast by Val Guest as the hapless Victor Carroon because &quot;he had the right sort of face for the part&quot;. He was best known at the time for his work in the theatre. His performance in &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot; is frequently compared with that of Boris Karloff in &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931). Guest, aware of the risk of an actor going over the top with the part, directed Wordsworth to &quot;hold back just a mite of what you&#x27;re feeling&quot;. Summing up Wordsworth&#x27;s performance, film critic Bill Warren said: &quot;All Carroon&#x27;s anguish and torment are conveyed in one of the best mime performances in horror and science fiction films... A sequence in which he is riding in a car with his wife is uncanny: only the alien is visible for a long moment&quot;. Wordsworth went on to appear in three more Hammer films: &quot;The Camp on Blood Island&quot; (1958), &quot;The Revenge of Frankenstein&quot; (1958), and &quot;The Curse of the Werewolf&quot; (1961). He remained known predominantly as a stage actor, among other things devising and starring in a one-person show dedicated to his great-great-grandfather, the poet William Wordsworth.

Another American star provided by Robert L. Lippert was Margia Dean, who played Judith Carroon. A former beauty queen, Dean was allegedly cast on account of her association with the 20th Century Fox president, Spyros Skouras. According to executive producer Michael Carreras, &quot;Skouras had a girlfriend who was an actress and he wanted her in pictures, but he didn&#x27;t want her in pictures in America, because of the tittle-tattle or whatever, so he set it up through his friend Bob Lippert&quot;. Val Guest recalled that &quot;she was a sweet girl, but she couldn&#x27;t act&quot;. Her American accent was considered out of place in the film, and so her lines were dubbed in post production.

Among the other actors that appear in the film are Thora Hird, Gordon Jackson, David King-Wood, Harold Lang, Lionel Jeffries, and Sam Kydd, many of whom appeared regularly in films directed by Val Guest. &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot; also saw an early role for Jane Asher, who plays the little girl whom Carroon encounters when he is on the run.

===Filming===

Val Guest was hired to direct the film. He began his career co-writing comedies such as &quot;Oh, Mr Porter!&quot; (1937) and &quot;Ask a Policeman&quot; (1939) before moving into directing with &quot;Miss London Ltd.&quot; (1943). His first directing job for Hammer was on &quot;Life with the Lyons&quot; (1954) and he went on to direct their first two colour features: &quot;The Men of Sherwood Forest&quot; (1954) and &quot;Break in the Circle&quot; (1954). Guest had little interest in science fiction and was unenthusiastic about directing the film; he reluctantly took copies of Nigel Kneale&#x27;s television scripts with him on holiday in Tangiers and only began reading them after being teased for his &quot;ethereal&quot; attitude by his wife, Yolande Donlan. Impressed by what he read and pleased to be offered the opportunity to break away from directing comedy films, he took the job. In his approach to directing the film, Guest sought to make &quot;a slightly wild story more believable&quot; by creating a &quot;science fact&quot; film, shot &quot;as though shooting a special programme for the BBC or something&quot;. Influenced by Elia Kazan&#x27;s &quot;Panic in the Streets&quot; (1950), Guest employed a cinéma vérité style, making extensive use of hand-held camera, even on set, an unusual technique for the time which horrified several of the technicians employed on the film. To inject pace and add further realism into the story, Guest directed his actors to deliver their lines rapid-fire and to overlap the dialogue. A meticulous planner, he created storyboards for every shot and mounted them on a blackboard so as to brief the crew for each day&#x27;s scenes. As a consequence, some members of the crew found Guest&#x27;s approach to be too mechanical.

Principal photography began on 12 October 1954 with a night shoot at Chessington Zoo and continued from 18 October into December. The budget was £42,000, low even by the standards of Hammer at the time. Special effects technician Les Bowie recalled: &quot;We did &quot;Quatermass&quot; on a budget so low it wasn&#x27;t a real budget. I did it for wages not as a proper effects man who gets allocated a certain budget for a movie&quot;. The shots of the emergency services rushing to the rocket crash site at the beginning of the movie were filmed in the village of Bray, Berkshire, where Hammer&#x27;s studios were located. The scenes with the crashed rocket were shot in a corn field at Water Oakley, near Bray. It was originally intended to make the crash site look more spectacular by setting fire to the field but bad weather interfered. Guest used a wide-angle lens for these shots to convey a feeling of vastness to the scene. Carroon&#x27;s encounter with the little girl was filmed at the East India Docks in London. A second unit, under cameraman Len Harris, conducted additional location shooting around London for the montage scenes of the police search for Carroon. For the shot of the lights of London going out when the electricity is diverted to Westminster Abbey, an agreement was made with one of the engineers at Battersea Power Station to turn off the lights illuminating the outside of the station; however the engineer misunderstood and briefly cut all the power along the River Thames. Most of the remaining location shooting was done in the Windsor area. The rest of the film was shot at Hammer&#x27;s Bray Studios, with the New Stage there housing the sets for the hospital and the interior of Westminster Abbey. Michael Carreras had written to the Abbey seeking permission to film there but was refused. The rooms of Down Place, the former country house Bray Studios were built around, were used for other scenes such as Inspector Lomax&#x27;s office. Art director James Elder Wills, in his final film for Hammer, made great use of the existing architecture of Down Place to enhance the effectiveness of his sets.

===Makeup and special effects===

The work of makeup artist Phil Leakey in transforming Richard Wordsworth&#x27;s Carroon into the mutating creature was a key contribution to the effectiveness of the film. Val Guest, Anthony Hinds, and Leakey all agreed that the makeup should make Carroon appear pitiful rather than ugly. Leakey placed a light above the actor in the makeup chair and then worked on accentuating the shadows cast by his eyebrows, nose, chin and cheekbones. The makeup was a liquid rubber solution mixed with glycerine to give the impression of sweat. Leakey&#x27;s job was made easier by Wordsworth&#x27;s natural high cheekbones and hollow temples and he also worked closely with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey to ensure the lighting in each shot emphasised Wordsworth&#x27;s features. Leakey also created Carroon&#x27;s mutating arm. The hand was created from a cast of the hand of an arthritis victim, enlarged and exaggerated by Leakey. The rest of the arm was built up using latex and rubber and, inside, had a series of plastic tubes through which fluid was pumped to give the effect of the arm swelling. A large sponge-rubber prosthetic was used for a brief scene in the zoo showing Carroon&#x27;s mutation had advanced further. The shrivelled corpses of Carroon&#x27;s victims, glimpsed from time to time in the film, were also made by Leakey.

Les Bowie provided the special effects: he had made his name perfecting an improved technique for matte painting, called the delineating matte, and formed a company with Vic Margutti that specialised in matte effects. Bowie provided a number of matte paintings to enhance the scale of certain key shots in the film, including the crashed rocket, the Westminster Abbey set, and the shot of Quatermass walking away from the Abbey at the climax of the film. Partly because of the concerns raised by the BBFC and partly on account of the low budget, Val Guest kept the creature largely off-screen for much of the film, feeling that audiences&#x27; imaginations would fill in the blanks more effectively than he and the special effects team could deliver on-screen. For the climactic scenes at Westminster Abbey, Bowie created a monster from tripe and rubber and photographed it against a model of the Abbey. There are also a couple of insert monster-closeup shots using an octopus, apparently fastened down out of water and with a few spikes appended to its sac, which is ultimately set afire. Sparks and fireworks were used for the shots of the creature being electrocuted. Michael Carreras felt something was missing when he viewed the first cut of this scene: &quot;There was this great glob of something hanging about on the scaffolding. And they had put in the best music they could and put the best effects on it, but it meant nothing as far as I was concerned … absolutely nothing at all&quot;. &quot;An eye was added to the model of the monster and a human scream added to the soundtrack&quot; to give the creature some semblance of humanity in its final moments, but this in fact is where the octopus was used. Models were also used for the rocket blasting off in the film&#x27;s final shot.

===Music===

John Hotchkis was originally hired to compose the music but, when he fell ill, Anthony Hinds asked conductor John Hollingsworth to recommend a replacement. Hollingsworth suggested James Bernard, with whom he had worked on a number of BBC radio productions. Bernard sent Hinds a tape of the score of one of these productions, an adaptation of &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;, and was duly hired. Bernard watched the film a number of times, stopping after each reel to make notes and discuss where the music would be needed. Val Guest was not involved in any of the music sessions; Anthony Hinds supervised Bernard and made the final decisions as to where the music should occur. Bernard composed the music at his piano and then worked out the orchestration, which was performed by the Royal Opera House Orchestra. Hollingsworth restricted the arrangement of the score to just the string and percussion sections: Bernard recalled, &quot;I had not written for film before and had only used strings for the BBC scores, so I think that John thought it would be better to see how I got on with these two sections before letting me loose with a full orchestra&quot;. The score runs to 20 minutes and uses a rising and falling three-note semitone throughout. Bernard&#x27;s biographer, David Huckvale, argues that Bernard&#x27;s use of atonal strings to create a sense of menace predates Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s score for &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960), which is usually cited as the first film to employ the technique. Remarking on the effectiveness of the score, the film critic John Brosnan said: &quot;Of prime importance, is the contribution of the soundtrack, in this case supplied by James Bernard who never wrote a more unnerving, jangly score&quot;. Bernard went on to become Hammer&#x27;s most prolific composer, scoring 23 Hammer films between 1955 and 1974. Several cues from &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot; were released on CD in 1999 by GDI Records on a compilation titled &quot;The Quatermass Film Music Collection&quot;.

==Reception==
===Cinema release===

As expected, &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot; received an &#x27;X&#x27; Certificate from the BBFC, restricting admission to persons over the age of sixteen. It was only the twelfth film to receive the certificate since its introduction in 1951. Whereas most other studios were nervous of this new certificate, Hammer, who had noticed the success of the similarly &#x27;X&#x27;-rated &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot; (1955), chose to exploit it by dropping the &quot;E&quot; from &quot;Experiment&quot; in the title of the film. &quot;X is not an unknown quantity&quot; was the tagline Exclusive Films used to sell the picture to cinema managers, urging them to &quot;Xploit the Xcitement&quot; of the film. On subsequent re-releases, the film reverted to the title &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;.

&quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot; premièred on 26 August 1955 at the London Pavilion on Piccadilly Circus. The supporting feature was &quot;The Eric Winstone Band Show&quot;. It performed extremely well during its West End run, taking £3,500 a week at the box office. Timed to coincide with the broadcast of the television sequel, &quot;Quatermass II&quot;, the film went on general release in the United Kingdom on 20 November in a double bill with the French film &quot;Rififi&quot;. This became the most successful double bill release of 1955 in the UK. In some parts of the UK, the Watch Committees of local councils demanded certain scenes, mainly close-up shots of Carroon&#x27;s victims, be removed before allowing the film to be exhibited in their jurisdictions.

In the United States, Robert L. Lippert attempted to interest Columbia Pictures in distributing the film but they felt it would be competition for their own production, &quot;It Came From Beneath The Sea&quot;, which was on release at the time. Because Quatermass was unknown in the US, Lippert had renamed the film &quot;Shock!&quot;. Unable to secure a sale, he retitled it again, this time to &quot;The Creeping Unknown&quot;. United Artists eventually acquired the distribution rights in March 1956 for a fee of $125,000. &quot;The Creeping Unknown&quot; was packaged as the bottom half of a double bill with a Gothic horror movie called &quot;The Black Sleep&quot;, starring Basil Rathbone, Lon Chaney Jr. and Bela Lugosi. Four minutes were trimmed from the runtime of the film, largely from longer shots (e.g., the zookeeper as he pedals away from the monkey house on his bike). It opened in US theatres in June and was so successful that United Artists offered to part-fund a sequel. According to a report in &quot;Variety&quot;, published on 6 November, a nine-year-old boy died of a ruptured artery at a cinema in Oak Park, Illinois during a showing of this double bill. The &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; subsequently recorded the incident as the only known case of an audience member dying of fright while watching a horror film.

===Critical response===
&quot;The Times&quot; newspaper critic gave the film a generally favourable assessment: &quot;Mr. Val Guest, the director, certainly knows his business when it comes to providing the more horrid brand of thrills... The first part of this particular film is well up to standard. Mr. Brian Donlevy, as the American scientist responsible for the experiment, is a little brusque in his treatment of British institutions but he is clearly a man who knows what he is doing. Mr. Jack Warner, representing Scotland Yard, is indeed a comfort to have at hand when Things are on the rampage&quot;. Positive reviews also came from Peter Burnup in the &quot;News of the World&quot;, who found that &quot;with the added benefit of bluff, boisterous Brian Donlevy... all earnest addicts of science fiction will undoubtedly love every minute of it&quot;, while the reviewer in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; praised &quot;a narrative style that quite neatly combines the horrific and the factual&quot;. &quot;Today&#x27;s Cinema&quot; called it &quot;one of the best essays in science fiction to date&quot;. Film historian Bruce G. Hallenbeck notes a degree of national pride in some of the positive reviews. For instance, Paul Dehn in the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; said: &quot;This is the best and nastiest horror film I have seen since the War. How jolly that it is also British&quot;! Similarly, William Whitebait in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, who found the film to be &quot;better than either &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; or &quot;Them!&quot;&quot;, also called for &quot;a couple of cheers for the reassurance that British films can still, once in a while, come quick&quot;.

On a less positive note, Frank Jackson of &quot;Reynolds News&quot; quipped &quot;That TV pseudo-science shocker &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot; has been filmed and quitermess they&#x27;ve made of it too&quot;, before slating the film as &quot;82 minutes of sick-making twaddle&quot;. The horror content of the film was mentioned in several reviews: Patrick Gibbs of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; said the film &quot;gives the impression that it originated in the strip of some horror comic. It remains very horrid and not quite coherent&quot;, while the reviewer in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; found the film to be &quot;a real chiller thriller but not for the kids&quot; and Dilys Powell of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; found the film &quot;exciting but distinctly nauseating&quot;. Another unimpressed critic was François Truffaut, who wrote in &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; that &quot;this one is very, very bad, far from the small pleasure we get, for example, from the innocent science fiction films signed by the American Jack Arnold... The subject could have been turned into a good film, not lacking in spice; with a bit of imagination... None of this is in this sadly English film&quot;.

Upon its release in the United States &quot;Variety&quot; noted &quot;Val Guest&#x27;s direction brings out the maxiumum suspense factors&quot; and found the movie to be &quot;a competently made drama . . . with frightening elements that should satisfy fans who go for the premise&quot;. According to Bruce Hallenbeck, many US critics found Brian Donlevy&#x27;s gruff Quatermass a breath of fresh air from the earnest hero scientists of American science fiction films, such as Gene Barry&#x27;s character in &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;.

Other US trade reviews were mixed. &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; felt that &quot;the story is, of course, quite fantastic but it has enough horrific ingredients to go over with those who enjoy scary doings&quot;. &quot;Film Bulletin&quot; was not impressed: &quot;Its strong point is an eerie atmosphere . . . but fails to build the suspense essential in this kind of film . . . Val Guest&#x27;s direction is heavy with cliches&quot;.

Among the critics and film historians who have reviewed &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot; in the years since its release have been John Baxter who said, in &quot;Science Fiction in the Cinema&quot; (1970): &quot;In its time, &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; was a pioneering sf film... Brian Donlevy was stiff but convincing... Much of the film is saved, however, by Richard Wordsworth... one of the finest such performances since Karloff&#x27;s triumphs of the Thirties&quot;. This view was echoed by John Brosnan in &quot;The Primal Screen&quot; (1991): &quot;One of the best of all alien possession movies&quot;, he wrote, &quot;not since Boris Karloff as Frankenstein&#x27;s monster has an actor managed to create such a memorable, and sympathetic, monster out of mime alone&quot;. Bill Warren in &quot;Keep Watching The Skies!&quot; (1982) found that &quot;the buildup is slightly too long and too careful&quot; but also said that &quot;it&#x27;s an intelligent, taut and well-directed thriller; it showcases Nigel Kneale&#x27;s ideas well; it&#x27;s scary and exciting. It was made by people who cared about what they were doing, who were making entertainment for adults. It is still one of the best alien invasion films&quot;. Steve Chibnall, writing for the British Film Institute&#x27;s Screenonline, describes &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot; as &quot;one of the high points of British SF/horror cinema&quot;. The horror fiction writer Stephen King praised the film in his non-fiction book &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; (1981) as one of his favourite horror movies between 1950 and 1980. The film director John Carpenter, who later collaborated with Nigel Kneale on the film &quot;Halloween III: Season of the Witch&quot; (1982), has claimed that &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot; &quot;had an enormous, enormous impact on me – and it continues to be one of my all-time favourite science-fiction movies&quot;.

==Legacy==
The success of &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot; came at an opportune time for Hammer. By 1955 the deal with Robert L. Lippert had expired and the company produced just one feature film that year, &quot;Women Without Men&quot;. Many of the independent cinemas that provided the market for Hammer&#x27;s films in the UK were struggling in the face of competition from television and faced closure. &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot; gave Hammer a much needed box office hit and was also the first film to bring the company to the attention of a major film distributor, in this case United Artists. From this point onward, Hammer was increasingly able to deal directly with the major distributors and no longer needed intermediaries like Lippert. This ultimately spelt the end for Exclusive Films, Hammer&#x27;s own distribution company, which was wound down in the late 1950s.

Hammer quickly sought to capitalise on its good fortune with a sequel. Staff member Jimmy Sangster pitched a story about a monster emerging from the Earth&#x27;s core. However, when the company asked Nigel Kneale for permission to use the character of Quatermass, he refused, not wanting to lose control of his creation. Nevertheless, the film went ahead, as &quot;X the Unknown&quot; (1956), again capitalising on the &#x27;X&#x27; Certificate in its title and featuring a newly created scientist character, very much in the Quatermass mould, played by Dean Jagger. Quatermass did eventually return to cinema screens in &quot;Quatermass 2&quot; (1957) and &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; (1967), both of which had screenplays written by Nigel Kneale and based on serials originally written by him and presented by BBC Television. Rival British film companies also tried to cash in with science fiction films of their own, including &quot;Satellite in the Sky&quot;, &quot;The Gamma People&quot; and &quot;Fire Maidens from Outer Space&quot; (all 1956).

&quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot; was Hammer&#x27;s first film to be adapted from a television drama. Market research carried out by the company showed that it was the horror aspect of the film, rather than the science fiction, that most appealed to audiences. Three of the four films Hammer made in 1956 were horror films: &quot;X the Unknown&quot;, &quot;Quatermass 2&quot; and &quot;The Curse of Frankenstein&quot;. The enormous success of the latter of these cemented Hammer&#x27;s reputation for horror and the company became synonymous with the genre. Michael Carreras later said: &quot;The film that must take all the credit for the whole Hammer series of horror films was really &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot;&quot;.

==Home media==
&quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot; was released in 2003 by DD Video on Region 2 DVD. It contained a number of extra features including a commentary by director Val Guest and Hammer historian Marcus Hearn, as well as an interview with Val Guest, an original trailer, and a production booklet written by Marcus Hearn and Jonathan Rigby. A Region 1 made-on-demand DVD-R, sourced from a high-definition master, was released in 2011.

The film was adapted into a 16-page comic strip published in two parts in the March/April and June 1977 issues of the magazine &quot;The House of Hammer&quot; (volume 1, issue #&#x27;s 8 and 9, published by General Book Distribution). It was drawn by Brian Lewis from a script by Les Lilley and Ben Aldrich. The cover of issue #9 featured a painting by Lewis of Professor Quatermass.

<doc id="865608" wikidata="Q1386157" url="?curid=865608" title="Kenneth R. Miller">
<text>Kenneth Raymond Miller (born July 14, 1948) is an American cell biologist, molecular biologist, and Professor Emeritus of Biology at Brown University. Miller&#x27;s primary research focus is the structure and function of cell membranes, especially chloroplast thylakoid membranes. Miller is a co-author of a major introductory college and high school biology textbook published by Prentice Hall since 1990. 

Miller, who is Catholic, is opposed to creationism, including the intelligent design (ID) movement. He has written three books on the subject: &quot;Finding Darwin&#x27;s God&quot;, &quot;Only a Theory&quot;, and &quot;The Human Instinct&quot;. Miller has received the Laetare Medal at the University of Notre Dame. In 2017, he received the inaugural St. Albert Award from the Society of Catholic Scientists.

==Biography==
Miller graduated from Rahway High School in Rahway, New Jersey, and then received his Sc.B. in biology in 1970 from Brown University. He earned his Ph.D. in biology from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1974. From 1974 to 1980, he taught at Harvard University.

== Research ==
His research involves problems of structure and function in biological membranes, especially chloroplast thylakoid membranes, often involving electron microscopy.

==Science advocacy==
Miller has voiced his support for what he calls &quot;pro-science&quot; candidates in politics. He has campaigned for school board and education candidates who support the teaching of evolution in Kansas and Ohio. In the science community, he has sought to elevate the understanding of scientists of the roots of the creationist movement, and to encourage the popularization of scientific concepts.

Miller has appeared in court as a witness, and on panels debating the teaching of intelligent design in schools. In 2002, the Ohio State Board of Education held a public debate between two scientists, including Miller, and two proponents of intelligent design.

He testified for the plaintiffs, but only as a fact witness (not as an expert), in &quot;Selman v. Cobb County&quot;, testing the legality of stickers calling evolution a &quot;theory, not a fact&quot; that were placed on the biology textbook Miller authored. In 2005, the judge ruled that the stickers violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. This decision was vacated on appeal because of missing records of the previous trial. The case was remanded for additional evidentiary inquiry and new findings, and a list of factual issues that the court would probably want to address included as item 15 a reference to Miller&#x27;s testimony regarding &quot;the colloquial or popular understanding of the term [theory]&quot; and the suggested question as to whether he has any qualifications to testify as an expert on the popular meaning of the word &quot;theory&quot;. The case was remanded back to the lower court and was eventually settled out of court.

Miller was also the plaintiff&#x27;s lead expert witness in the 2004-2005 &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot; case, challenging the school board&#x27;s mandate to incorporate intelligent design into the curriculum. The judge in that case also ruled decisively in favor of the plaintiffs.

He spoke at the Skeptics Society&#x27;s Origins Conference in October 2008, and at the Veritas Forum on topics such as the relationship between science and religion and the existence of God.

Miller has appeared on the Comedy Central television show &quot;The Colbert Report,&quot; and has made many appearances on C-SPAN debating proponents of creationism and intelligent design. He has debated several supporters of intelligent design including biochemist Michael J. Behe.

He gave a Faraday Institute lecture in April 2009 on &quot;God, Darwin and Design&quot; and appeared on the &quot;Today Programme&quot; arguing, &quot;The issue of God is an issue on which reasonable people may differ, but I certainly think that it&#x27;s an over-statement of our scientific knowledge and understanding to argue that science in general, or evolutionary biology in particular, proves in any way that there is no God.&quot;

== Publications ==

=== General books ===
* &quot;Finding Darwin&#x27;s God: A Scientist&#x27;s Search for Common Ground Between God and Evolution&quot; (2000, Cliff Street Books ) which argues that acceptance of evolution is compatible with a belief in God.
* &quot;Only a Theory : Evolution and the Battle for America&#x27;s Soul&quot; , (2008, Penguin Group, ) which explores Intelligent Design and the &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot; case along with its implications on teaching science in America
* &quot;The Human Instinct: How We Evolved to Have Reason, Consciousness, and Free Will&quot; (Simon and Schuster. 2018 ) which explores how humans evolved to develop reason, consciousness, and free will. it was described by David DiSalvo as &quot;an optimist&#x27;s argument for a refreshed view of human evolution&quot;

===Textbooks===
Miller is the co-author (with Boston College neurobiologist and marine biologist Joseph Levine) of a major introductory college and high school biology textbook published by Prentice Hall since 1990. The current edition was published in 2010 by Savvas (which now owns Prentice Hall). Initially, Prentice Hall approached Joseph Levine to write the textbook after reading an article he wrote in Smithsonian magazine; Levine, who is a former student of Miller&#x27;s, then recruited Miller as a co-author. Miller and Levine have also co-written a college-level textbook published by the former D.C. Heath and Company, first edition in 1991, entitled &quot;Biology: Discovering Life&quot;.
* Miller, K.R. and Levine, J. (2002) &quot;Biology: The Living Science&quot; (various editions of high school textbook)

== Honors ==
2006 Public Service Award from the American Society for Cell Biology .

2006 Dwight H. Terry Lectureship at Yale University, delivering his lecture &quot;Darwin, God, and Dover: What the Collapse of &#x27;Intelligent Design&#x27; Means for Science and for Faith in America.&quot;

2008 American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Award for Public Understanding of Science and Technology.

2010 Elected as a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.

May 2014, Laetare Medal at the University of Notre Dame.

2017, inaugural St. Albert Award from the Society of Catholic Scientists.

Since 2016, Miller has been listed on the board of directors of the National Center for Science Education. In 2017 he became the president.

<doc id="865610" wikidata="Q6388166" url="?curid=865610" title="Ken Miller (Montana politician)">
<text>Ken Miller (born February 1, 1957) is a Montana business owner and former Republican member of the Montana State Senate. He served as Chairman of the Montana Republican Party from 2001–2003 and was a candidate for the Republican nomination for Governor of Montana in the 2012 election.

== Personal life ==
Miller was born in Fort Collins, Colorado, and was raised on a dairy farm in Colorado until 1974, when his family moved to Joliet, Montana. In 1979 he started a construction and roofing business which he ran with his wife until 2001. Currently he and his family operate a furniture store in Laurel, Montana.
In 1980 he married his wife, Peggy. The couple has two children, Max and Kyndall.

== Political career ==
In 1994 Miller was elected to the Montana State Senate in a traditionally democratic district which was previously represented by Chet Blaylock, a respected Montana political veteran and the Democratic nominee for governor in 1996. Miller served in the Senate for 8 years, where he counts among his legislative accomplishments working to privatize state liquor stores and helping reduce the coal severance tax.
Miller also served as chairman of the Montana Republican Party from 2001–2003 and saw significant majorities in both houses of the State Legislature.
In 2004, Miller sought the Republican nomination for governor when Judy Martz announced that she would not seek a second term. In a crowded primary he garnered 22% of the vote in an election ultimately won by Secretary of State Bob Brown.

== Political positions ==
Miller has gained a reputation as a conservative Republican; he is pro-life and an advocate for Second Amendment Rights and lower taxes. He has also taken conservative positions on immigration, entitlements, education, and the federal government&#x27;s involvement in managing the wolf population in Montana. In a 2010 op-ed in the Billings Gazette, Miller called for Montanans to support a ballot initiative that would call for a Montana Constitutional Convention, calling the current document &quot;conflicting and ambiguous.&quot;

<text>Cocaine Nights is a 1996 novel by J. G. Ballard. Like &quot;Super-Cannes&quot; that followed it, it deals with the idea of dystopian resort communities which maintain their seemingly perfect balance via a number of dark secrets.

==Plot summary==

The story&#x27;s protagonist, Charles Prentice, ventures to Estrella de Mar in order to rescue his jailed brother, Frank who has been arrested for instigating an arson attack which killed 5 people. Upon arriving and talking with his sibling, Charles finds to his horror that his brother has confessed to everything, and has no interest in trying to escape his plea. In a matter of days, Charles becomes immersed in the strange world of Estrella de Mar, learning more of its dark secrets, and spending less time worrying about his brother.

Constantly being manipulated while he thinks he is finding the truth, Charles soon finds himself out of control and at the nexus of certain disaster, at which point he finally begins to understand just what happened to his brother.

<doc id="865614" wikidata="Q453722" url="?curid=865614" title="Amanda">
<text>Amanda is a Latin feminine gerundive (i.e. verbal adjective) name meaning, literally, &quot;she who must (or is fit to) be loved&quot;. Other translations, with similar meaning, could be &quot;deserving to be loved,&quot; &quot;worthy of love,&quot; or &quot;loved very much by everyone.&quot; Its diminutive form includes Mandy, Manda and Amy. It is common in countries where Germanic and Romance languages are spoken.

&quot;Amanda&quot; comes from &quot;ama-&quot; (the stem of the Latin verb &quot;amare&quot;, &quot;to love&quot;) plus the feminine nominative singular gerundive ending (&quot;-nda&quot;). Other names, especially female names, were derived from this verb form, such as &quot;Miranda&quot;.

The name &quot;Amanda&quot; occasionally appears in Late Antiquity, such as the Amanda who was the &quot;wife of the ex-advocate and ex-provincial governor Aper (q.v.); she cared for his estates and raised their children after he adopted the monastic life: &#x27;curat illa saeculi curas, ne tu cures (Paul. Nol. Epist. 44.4).

In England the name &quot;Amanda&quot; first appears in 1212 on a birth record from Warwickshire, England, and five centuries later the name was popularized by poets and playwrights. In the United States, &quot;Amanda&quot; slowly became more prominent from the 1930s to the 1960s, ranking among the top 200 baby names.

From 1976 to 1995, &quot;Amanda&quot; ranked in the ten most popular female baby names in the United States. The name was most popular from 1978 to 1992, when it ranked in the top four. At its prime, in 1980, it was the second most popular. In 2009, &quot;Amanda&quot; ranked number 166. It was ranked among the top ten names given to girls born in Puerto Rico in 2009. The name has also recently been popular in Sweden, where it ranked twentieth for girls born in 2009, down five places from the year 2008. It is also popular in Swedish-speaking families in Finland, where it ranked among the top ten names for girls born to this demographic group.

<doc id="865620" wikidata="Q7911915" url="?curid=865620" title="Vallejo (band)">
<text>Vallejo is an American rock band founded by three Vallejo brothers: AJ Vallejo (eldest twin), Alex Vallejo (younger twin) &amp; Omar Vallejo (youngest brother) in Austin, Texas, but born &amp; raised in El Campo, Texas later moving to Alabaster, Alabama, a suburb of Birmingham, Alabama during their pre-teen years. The band has released 12 full-length albums starting back in 1991 with their self-titled debut &#x27;Sins&#x27; on the now-defunct Birmingham, AL indie label, Chapel Lane.

Not long after their move in January 1995 to Austin, TX, the group was signed to a multi-album and exclusive co-publishing deal to Chicago inde, imi Record&#x27;s Bobby Francavillo, with producer Steve Peck signed on as the debut album&#x27;s producer. Gaining an impressive amount of Active Rock radio airplay from their 1997 debut album &quot;1969&quot; featuring singles &quot;Boogieman&quot; and &quot;Just Another Day&quot;, imi signed a major distribution and marketing deal with TVT Records in New York, where the debut album was re-released - gaining more rave reviews, kicking open many doors for Vallejo who went on to tour nationwide becoming a &#x27;dangerous live act&#x27; as described by AustinLive. The followup to &quot;1969&quot;, Beautiful Life, engineered, produced, and mixed by Neiil King, was recorded at The Record Plant in Sausalito, CA, and released in 1998. Now on imi/TVT, the album was received with less enthusiastic radio response resulting in TVT&#x27;s decision to pull back promotion after a timid reaction to the single released by the band with Beastie Boys&#x27; DJ Hurricane. Bittersweet perhaps that this single, &#x27;Snake In The Grass&#x27; would later resurface a decade later on two episodes of HBO&#x27;s hit-series True Blood to much renewed airplay worldwide.

After catching a High End Lighting showcase in Orlando, Florida by Vallejo at the House of Blues, Miami producer Emilio Estefan immediately signs Vallejo releasing &quot;Into the New&quot;, released by Sony in 2000. The album garnered mixed reviews but did well on the Rock Charts getting the band invited on nationwide US tours by Stone Temple Pilots, Linkin Park, Fuel, Disturbed, Blues Traveler, Matchbox Twenty, The Black Crowes. Prior to releasing their second single to national radio, an unfortunate one-two knock out combo of bad luck catches up to Vallejo with a complete label-heads change at Sony and weeks later the world-stopping distraction of 9/11. Sony cuts half of the artist roster with Vallejo on the list halfway into their summer tour. The weary brothers and band honor their remaining dates, head home strung out and drained spending over a year tangled in legal battles.

In 2002, as free agents, Vallejo launches their own label VMG and releases &quot;Stereo&quot;, to overwhelming positive reviews becoming what many know to be as the Vallejo fan favorite. Over the next decade, the band continues releasing a healthy offering of albums to their loyal fanbase: 2004&#x27;s trilogy-archive-releases: &quot;Black Sky&quot;, &quot;Leftovers&quot;, and &quot;Steamboat Live 97&quot;, &quot;Acousta&quot; (2006), &quot;Thicker Than Water&quot; (2008) and &quot;Brothers Brew&quot; (2014). Shortly after the release of Brothers Brew sources of the band mention artistic differences and/or a bit of inevitable burnout from two decades of non-stop touring becoming the main reason for the Vallejo brothers&#x27; gradual transition from touring artists to producers with a seemingly effective presence in the music industry. AJ Vallejo goes on to win Austin Chronicle&#x27;s &quot;Guitar Player of the Year&quot; in 2016 and &quot;Producer of the Year&quot; three years in a row in 2014-2015-2016, launching indie label &quot;10X Music Group&quot; and continues with both Bruce Castleberry on guitar and Alex Geismar on drums as roots-rock group, &quot;Brodie Lane&quot;. Alex Vallejo becomes director of Austin&#x27;s School of Rock facilities, co-producer at EPS and Manager at &quot;Austin Music Foundation&quot;. Omar Vallejo opens &quot;512 Studios&quot; in Austin, TX winning &quot;Austin Chronicle&#x27;s Producer&quot; and &quot;Studio of the Year&quot; in 2018-2019. 

In 2021, after a seven year recording hiatus, Vallejo releases &quot;Amigos&quot; on their VMG label, an album composed of collaborations with Texas staples and Grammy artist including Flaco Jimenez, Ray Benson, Dale Watson, Grupo Fantasma, and Gina Chavez to name a few.

<text>Patricia Phoenix (born Patricia Frederica Manfield; 26 November 1923 – 17 September 1986) was an English actress who became one of the first sex symbols of British television through her role as Elsie Tanner, an original cast member of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, a role which she portrayed from its first episode in 1960 to 1973, and again from 1976 until she quit the role in 1984. In Elsie Tanner, she is credited with creating one of the most famous characters in British soap history.

==Early life==
Phoenix was born at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital in Fallowfield, Lancashire, to Annie (&quot;née&quot; Noonan), originally of County Galway, Ireland, and Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Manfield. Phoenix also claimed that she had been born in Galway, although she later stated that she was merely agreeing with something her elderly mother had already told the press.

When Phoenix was eight years old, her father was involved in a car accident; in court, it was revealed that his marriage was bigamous as he had never divorced his first wife, who was living some miles away and who he had been paying maintenance to for many years. She later described this period in her life as a &quot;nightmare&quot;, saying that &quot;I lost my safe, secure, normal world&quot;. Her mother later married Richard Pilkington.

Phoenix attended Fallowfield Central School. As a child, she nursed early theatrical ambitions, appearing regularly on the radio in &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; at the age of 11, after having submitted a monologue. After leaving school, she worked as a filing clerk for the electricity charging department of Manchester Corporation, performing in amateur dramatics in her spare time. She joined the Arts Theatre in Manchester and other Northern repertory companies.

==Career==
Phoenix&#x27;s big break came in 1948, when she played Sandy Powell&#x27;s wife in the Mancunian Film Studios film &quot;Cup-tie Honeymoon&quot;, followed by a summer season in Blackpool with Thora Hird in the show &quot;Happy Days&quot;. Exposure led to more serious work with Joan Littlewood&#x27;s Theatre Workshop at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East. She also worked as a writer for ventriloquist Terry Hall and comedian Harry Worth. Some undistinguished film work followed in &quot;Blood of the Vampire&quot; (1958) and &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; (1959) and in 1960, she returned to Manchester with her ambition all but spent.

Phoenix&#x27;s fortunes improved when she was given her best known role as Elsie Tanner, the devil-may-care divorcée who lived at No. 11 in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. By this time, she had changed her name from Pilkington to Phoenix, after the mythological bird that rose from the ashes. She featured in the programme from 1960 to 1973 and again from 1976 to 1984. Her character became known for her fiery red hair and was described by Prime Minister James Callaghan as &quot;the sexiest thing on television&quot;. During her periods of absence from the series, she failed in her attempts to find suitable alternative roles. She left the series for the final time in January 1984, having filmed her last scenes during November 1983, her 60th birthday. In the story, her character moved to Portugal to meet up with an old flame until 2004 when the character died in a car crash (off screen).

Phoenix&#x27;s profile gained her a part in the British film &quot;The L-Shaped Room&quot; (1962) in which she played a prostitute and which also featured her future husband Anthony Booth in a small role. She was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1972 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews on the set of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.. After her final departure from &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, she appeared in a one-act television play, &quot;Hidden Talents&quot;, in 1986. At this time, she was suffering from advanced lung cancer; in the play, she played a woman dying of cancer. That same year, she also starred in short-lived sitcom &quot;Constant Hot Water&quot;, playing a Bridlington landlady. In 1985, she was interviewed for a magazine by long-time fan, the singer Morrissey, who also featured her on the cover of one of the Smiths&#x27; singles, &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Sister&quot;.

==Personal life==
Phoenix&#x27;s love life was often fodder for tabloid stories. Her first marriage was to actor Peter Marsh, whom she married in Bradford Cathedral in 1953; the couple divorced in 1961. On 23 December 1972, she married her &quot;Coronation Street&quot; co-star Alan Browning. The marriage lasted just under seven years, as Browning had alcohol-related problems and died from liver failure in September 1979. She later married actor Anthony Booth, the father-in-law of future Prime Minister Tony Blair.

Phoenix wrote two volumes of autobiography; &quot;All My Burning Bridges&quot; (1974) and &quot;Love, Curiosity, Freckles and Doubt&quot; (1983). She was a practising Catholic and a lifelong supporter of the Labour Party, campaigning for Tony Blair at the 1983 general election for him to be elected as the Member of Parliament for Sedgefield where he was returned. Phoenix also campaigned with Booth for former Minister for Technology Tony Benn at the 1984 Chesterfield by-election, which Benn won. She owned the Navigation Inn, a pub in Buxworth, Derbyshire.

==Illness and death==
In March 1986, Phoenix, who smoked 60 cigarettes a day, was diagnosed with lung cancer after collapsing at home. She continued to work following her diagnosis, hiding her illness from most people, including her lover Tony Booth. In the summer of 1986, her condition deteriorated, forcing her to undergo more extensive treatment and confirming mild speculation in the press that she had health problems. It later leaked that she had just weeks to live and had been given the last rites.

Phoenix married Booth in the Alexandra Hospital (Cheadle), on 9 September 1986, attracting much media attention. Eight days later, she died in her sleep, aged 62. At her request, her funeral service at the Holy Name Church in Manchester featured a large brass band; according to &quot;Coronation Street&quot; histories written by show historian Daran Little, she wanted the event that marked her death to be as lively as her life. Booth&#x27;s daughter Cherie was amongst the mourners, alongside her husband, Tony Blair.

==Legacy==
Since her death, Phoenix has been portrayed by Kym Marsh, Denise Black, Debbie Rush, Sue Johnston, Lynda Rooke and Jodie Prenger (who have all also appeared in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as, respectively, Michelle Connor, Denise Osborne, Anna Windass, Gloria Price, Laura Collins/Lucy Woodrow and Glenda Shuttleworth) and Jessie Wallace in various dramas depicting her life, both on stage and television.

As part of the &quot;Coronation Street&quot; 40th anniversary celebrations in 2000, blue plaques were unveiled outside the Granada Studios, the location for most of her work on &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, to four of the soap opera&#x27;s stars, including Phoenix. The other plaques commemorated the lives of Doris Speed, Bryan Mosley and Violet Carson.

<text>John Archer Lejeune ( ; January 10, 1867 – November 20, 1942) was a United States Marine Corps lieutenant general and the 13th Commandant of the Marine Corps. Lejeune served for nearly 40 years in the military, and commanded the U.S. Army&#x27;s 2nd Division during World War I. After his retirement from the Marine Corps he became superintendent of the Virginia Military Institute.

Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in North Carolina was named in his honor during World War II. 

==Biography==
Lejeune was born on January 10, 1867, at the Old Hickory Plantation near Lacour, Louisiana, in Pointe Coupee Parish. He was the son of Confederate army captain Ovide Lejeune (1820–1889) He attended the preparatory program at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge from September 1881 to April 1884, leaving to prepare for the entrance exam for the United States Naval Academy. He secured an appointment as a midshipman at the Academy, from which he graduated in 1888, ranking second academically in his class of thirty-two midshipmen. At the completion of a two-year cruise as a midshipman, he was appointed to Naval Engineering, but was desperate to join the Marine Corps. Exhausting all conventional channels, he contacted his senator and eventually the Secretary of the Navy arranged his appointment to the Marine Corps. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on July 25, 1890. His immediate family was very involved with the Marine Corps, particularly during World War II. His daughter, Eugenia Lejeune, and his grandson, James Blair Glennon Jr., served with the Corps during the war and after. His granddaughter, Jeanne Glennon Hull, served in the Navy&#x27;s WAVES and was married to Lt. Col. William Frederick Harris in 1946.

==U.S. Marine Corps career==

===1890s===
After receiving his Marine Corps commission, Lejeune was assigned to Marine Barracks, New York, on March 31, 1890, for Marine Corps &quot;indoctrination and instruction&quot;. Afterwards, he reported for duty to the Marine Barracks, Norfolk, Virginia, on November 3, 1890. While in Norfolk, he met Ellie Harrison Murdaugh; they were engaged just before he began his first tour of sea duty. From October 1, 1891, to July 28, 1893, Lejeune served on board and was promoted to first lieutenant on February 26, 1892. On August 28, 1893, he was assigned to the Norfolk Marine Barracks, where he served until July 31, 1897. While stationed in Norfolk this second time, he married Murdaugh on October 23, 1895.

On August 2, 1897, Lejeune assumed command of the Marine Guard of the , where he served throughout the Spanish–American War. On the morning of August 9, 1898, he commanded the approximately 30-man landing party at Cape San Juan, Puerto Rico that covered the withdrawal of 35 U.S. Navy bluejackets from and 60 civilian refugees from the town of Fajardo that had been quartered at the Cape San Juan Light that the sailors had defended against a force of approximately 200 Spanish Army troops and civil guard the previous night during the Battle of Fajardo. He was reassigned from &quot;Cincinnati&quot; on February 17, 1899, and on February 18, 1899, joined the to command the Marine Guard on board. He was promoted to captain on March 3, 1899, and left his position on the &quot;Massachusetts&quot; on May 10, 1900.

===1900–1916===
From July 3, 1900, to November 12, 1900, Captain Lejeune was assigned to recruiting duty at Boston, Massachusetts. On November 22, 1900, he reported at the Marine Barracks, Pensacola, Florida, to command a Marine detachment there. From January 12 to January 21, 1903, Captain Lejeune was on duty at the Norfolk Barracks, he was en route to duty at New York City on January 26, 1903. He was promoted to major on March 3, 1903, 
 and was on duty assigned to Headquarters Marine Corps in Washington, D.C., from May 15, 1903, to August 8, 1903.

On August 8, 1903, Major Lejeune was assigned to to command the Marine Battalion on board that vessel, joining the ships company August 16, 1903. On October 23, 1903, the battalion, with Lejeune in command, was transferred to . From December 16 to December 21, 1904, Major Lejeune was on shore duty on the Isthmus of Panama in command of this battalion, leaving there on the latter date on board .

From January 27, 1905, to May 20, 1906, Lejeune served at the Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C. He then returned to Panama in command of a battalion of Marines from May 29 to July 6, 1906, the battalion being transported both ways on board , returning to Washington Marine Barracks. On March 29, 1907, Major Lejeune was detached from command of the Washington Barracks and ordered to the Philippines. His family—his wife and three daughters—accompanied him on this overseas duty.

Arriving in the Philippines on May 2, 1907, Lejeune assumed command of the Marine Barracks and Naval Prison, Navy Yard, Cavite, on May 6, 1907. He assumed command of the First Brigade of Marines on June 15, 1908, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel on May 13, 1909. He was detached on June 8, 1909, and ordered to return to the United States. He then attended the United States Army War College, graduating in 1910.

Lieutenant Colonel Lejeune embarked on board on May 26, 1912, with the Second Regiment, First Provisional Brigade Marines, for Cuba. He disembarked at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on June 8, 1912, and was in command of the District of Santiago from June 9 to July 14, 1912. On July 15, 1912, Lejeune embarked on board and sailed for Colón, Panama. July 18–29, 1912, was spent at Camp Elliott, Panama.

The Marine Corps Association was founded on April 25, 1911, at Guantanamo Bay by the officers of the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, under command of Colonel Littleton W. T. Waller.
Although the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade disbanded shortly after, the MCA remained active. Two years later, again at Guantanamo Bay, officers of the 2d Provisional Marine Brigade, commanded by Colonel Lincoln Karmany, formally organized the Marine Corps Association. Colonel Karmany appointed then-Lt. Colonel John A. Lejeune as its first head of the executive board. After returning to the United States, Lejeune was again called upon for expeditionary duty. He sailed from Philadelphia, February 20, 1913, as second in command of the First Regiment, Second Provisional Brigade Marines, and disembarked February 27, 1913, at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Then-Lt. Colonel Lejeune became the first head of the Marine Corps Association with the goal of professional advancement among Marines. He returned to Philadelphia on board USS &quot;Prairie&quot; on May 2, 1913.

On November 27, 1913, Lejeune sailed from New York with the 2nd Advanced Base Regiment, his ultimate destination Veracruz, Mexico, but returned to the United States to receive his promotion to colonel on February 25, 1914.

Col. Lejeune participated in the Tampico Affair. Colonel Lejeune and his unit eventually landed in Mexico on April 22, 1914, and participated in the United States occupation of Veracruz. He returned home in December 1914, this time to report to Marine Corps Headquarters in Washington, D.C., to become the Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps to Major General George Barnett, Commandant of the Marine Corps. He was promoted to brigadier general on August 29, 1916.

===World War I===
With the American entry into World War I in April 1917, Lejeune assumed command of the newly constructed Marine Barracks, Quantico, Virginia; however, his overseas service was inevitable, and in June 1918, he arrived at Brest, France. He was promoted to major general on July 1, 1918.

Upon reporting to General John J. Pershing, Commander-in-chief (CinC) of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) on the Western Front, he was assigned to succeed Brigadier General Charles R. Boardman in command of the 64th Infantry Brigade of the 32nd Division but later assumed command of the 4th Marine Brigade, part of the 2nd Division, immediately following the attack of the division in the Battle of Soissons. Of note, Earl Hancock Ellis was then serving as the brigade&#x27;s adjutant. On July 28, 1918, Major General Lejeune assumed command of the 2nd Division after its former commander, Major General James Harbord, had been reassigned to command the AEF&#x27;s Services of Supply. He was the second Marine officer to hold an Army divisional command, Brigadier General Charles A. Doyen having previously commanded the division for two weeks. Lejeune commanded the 2nd Division during the victorious action at the battle of St. Mihiel in September. The operation was a success, and Lejeune sent an order of congratulations to the men of his command:

Lejeune emphasized tightly coordinated action that emphasized extensive rehearsal and disciplined artillery gunnery. This discipline enabled infantry elements to follow closely behind barrages that would otherwise be far too risky. This &quot;leaning on the artillery&quot; meant that the enemy faced direct assault while still reverting from the shock of a bombardment.

Lejeune stated his philosophy as &quot;The key to combat effectiveness is unity – an esprit that characterizes itself in complete, irrevocable, mutual trust. Now my infantry trusts my artillery and engineers, and my artillery and engineers know this so they will go through hell itself before they let down the infantry. My infantry believe that with such support they are invincible-and they are.&quot; Marshal Pétain praised Lejeune as &quot;a military genius who could and did do what the other commander said couldn&#x27;t be done.&quot;

During the war, he was recognized by the French government as a strategist and leader, as evidenced by the Legion of Honor, and the Croix de guerre bestowed upon him by France. The C-in-C of the AEF, General Pershing, awarded Lejeune the U.S. Army&#x27;s Distinguished Service Medal. The citation for his Army DSM reads:

The U.S. Navy&#x27;s Distinguished Service Medal was conferred upon him when he returned to the United States following the occupation of Germany. The medal&#x27;s citation states the following:



Lejeune remained in command of the 2nd Division until August 1919, when the division was demobilized 9 months after the end of the war, including leading it in the march into Germany following the Armistice with Germany in November 1918.

In October 1919, he again was appointed commanding general, Marine Barracks, Quantico, Virginia.

===Commandant of the Marine Corps===
Lejeune was appointed as major general and Commandant of the Marine Corps on July 1, 1920. Subsequent to that time, he left his headquarters at Washington several times for tours of inspection in Haiti, Santo Domingo, Cuba, Puerto Rico, to the West Coast and elsewhere. During his service as Major General Commandant, Lejeune presided over what is known as the first enlightenment of the Marine Corps. Lejeune directed intelligence gathering operations in the Pacific in the early 1920s, and drove changes in the organization, training, education, and equipping of Marines, thus transforming them from 19th century colonial naval infantry into a combined arms amphibious force needed to prevail in World War II. Upon the expiration of his second term as commandant, Lejeune indicated his desire not to retire from the Marine Corps, but was relieved as commandant in March 1929.

===United States Marine Corps League founder===
The Marine Corps League is the only Congressionally chartered United States Marine Corps-related veterans organization in the United States. Its Congressional Charter was approved by the 75th U.S. Congress and signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on August 4, 1937. The organization credits its founding – in 1923 – to legendary Marine Corps Commandant John A. Lejeune. General Lejeune was also charter member, in 1926, of American Legion Junius F. Lynch Post 35, in Norfolk, VA.

=== Freemasonry ===
Lejeune was raised to the Sublime Degree of Master Mason in a Lodge in Coblenz, Germany.

==Retirement, VMI, and death==
On November 10, 1929, Lejeune retired from the Marine Corps after thirty-nine years of service in order to accept the position of superintendent of the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in Lexington, Virginia. Lejeune served as the institute&#x27;s 5th superintendent for eight years until October 1937, when he retired for the second and final time.

In 1930 Lejeune was elected as an honorary member of the Virginia Society of the Cincinnati.

In September 1939, when Hitler&#x27;s legions invaded Poland, he wrote to Thomas Holcomb, then the current commandant of the Marine Corps, and volunteered to serve once more given his alarm over the crisis in Europe. The offer was gently declined given his age.

In February 1942, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation permitting several officers who had displayed heroism in World War I to be promoted on the retired list, and Lejeune and John Twiggs Myers were advanced to lieutenant general.

Lejeune died on November 20, 1942, in the Union Memorial Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland, and was interred in the Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors.

==Marine Corps Birthday message==
In the Marine Corps&#x27; annual celebration of the establishment of the Marine Corps on November 10, 1775, at Tun Tavern, the following message from Lejeune is read:

==Honors==

===U.S. Postal service honor===
On November 10, 2005, the United States Postal Service issued the &quot;Distinguished Marines&quot; stamps in which Lejeune was honored.

===Statues and memorials===
On November 10, 2000, a life-sized bronze statue of Lejeune was unveiled on the grounds of the Pointe Coupee Parish Courthouse in New Roads, Louisiana. Patrick F. Taylor, chairman and CEO of Taylor Energy Company, along with the retired Marine Corps Major General Ronald G. Richard (former commanding general of Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune) were in attendance. Taylor, who financed the Lejeune statue project, joined the Marine Corps Officer Training program as a student at Louisiana State University, but a heart problem kept him from receiving his commission. Taylor commissioned sculptor Patrick Dane Miller to fashion it to be historically accurate.

Statues of Lejeune also stand outside the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Virginia, in the center of the traffic circle aboard MCB Camp Lejeune NC, outside of Lejeune Hall at the United States Naval Academy, outside of Lejeune Hall on MCB Quantico, Virginia, and the Louisiana War Memorial in downtown Baton Rouge, Louisiana next to the destroyer .

<text>Amport House is a country house near the village of Amport, Andover, Hampshire, England. It is a Grade II listed building.

The house was built in 1857 by John Paulet, 14th Marquess of Winchester. After being requisitioned during the Second World War, the house had various military uses and was the home of the Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre until March 2020, when it was sold by the Ministry of Defence.

==History==
The current house was built in 1857 in an Elizabethan style near the village of Amport by John Paulet, 14th Marquess of Winchester, replacing two earlier houses which had stood on the site. It has a gatehouse and a pleached avenue of lime trees, now believed to be the longest such avenue in the United Kingdom.

The last of the Paulet family to reside at Amport was Henry Paulet, 16th Marquess of Winchester. Facing high levels of taxation at the end of the First World War, he sold the estate in lots between November 1918 and July 1919. Not long afterwards, the house and grounds were bought by Colonel Sofer Whitburn DSO, who in 1923 engaged Sir Edwin Lutyens and Gertrude Jekyll to redesign the gardens. 

At the start of the Second World War, the house was requisitioned to be used as the headquarters of Royal Air Force Maintenance Command; as well as ceding them use of the house, Sofer Whitburn is reported to have donated his entire wine cellar to the Officers&#x27; Mess as a patriotic gesture. In 1943, with the RAF still in possession, he sold the house; in 1957, the RAF itself bought the property. Later that year, the Royal Air Force Chaplains&#x27; School moved from Dowdeswell Court in Dowdeswell to Amport House. The School included a Royal Navy chaplain staff member, and in 1996, with the closure of the depot of the Royal Army Chaplains&#x27; Department at Bagshot Park, it became the tri-service Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre. 

In 1984, Amport House became a Grade II listed building. 

In September 2016, the Ministry of Defence announced that Amport House would be put up for sale as part of a programme of defence estate rationalisation. &quot;A Better Defence Estate&quot;, published in November 2016, indicated that the Armed Forces Chaplaincy would close by 2020, which it subsequently did, to be relocated to Shrivenham, near Swindon. The licence for the publication of banns of marriage and the solemnisation of such marriages which had been granted to the chapel in January 2000 in accordance with the Marriage Act 1949 was cancelled in July 2020.

A converted stable block at the house was for some years the home of the Royal Army Chaplains&#x27; Museum, which also moved to Shrivenham.

In 2021, plans were announced to convert Amport House into an hotel.

<doc id="865638" wikidata="Q5537862" url="?curid=865638" title="George Chichester, 2nd Marquess of Donegall">
<text>George Augustus Chichester, 2nd Marquess of Donegall (14 August 1769 – 5 October 1844), styled Viscount Chichester until 1791 and Earl of Belfast from 1791 to 1799, was an Anglo-Irish nobleman and politician.

==Biography==
He was born into an Ulster aristocratic family at St James&#x27;s, Westminster, and served for less than a year as a representative in the Irish House of Commons for Carrickfergus before succeeding his father as Marquess of Donegall in 1799 and the proprietor of Belfast..

Lord Donegall was admitted to the Irish Privy Council in 1803 and later served as Lord Lieutenant of County Donegal from 1831 until his death. He was also made a Knight of the Order of St Patrick in 1821 on the occasion of King George IV&#x27;s visit to Ireland

In Belfast, those who had engaged in the reform and patriotic politics of the 1790s remained critical of Donegall&#x27;s role as the town&#x27;s pocket borough master. As they had been in the Dublin parliament, in the new United Kingdom parliament, Belfast&#x27;s two MPs were his exclusive nominees. Yet veterans of both reform and rebellion found in Donegall a patron&#x27;s for their civic initiatives. In 1810, Donegall leased the land, and laid the foundation stone, for William Drennan&#x27;s progressively conceived Belfast Academical Institution. In 1808, he had headed the list of subscribers for the Belfast Harp Society, dedicated to &quot;preserving the national music and national instrument of Ireland&quot; and to promoting interest the country&#x27;s language, history and antiquities.

In 1809, he leased land on the east side of Donegall Street for building the town&#x27;s second Roman Catholic Church, St Patricks.

A lifelong gambler, Lord Donegall married the daughter of Edward May, a moneylender and owner of a gambling house. This may have been an agreement to resolve some debts. In 1818 it came to light that Anna May was illegitimate and had been underage when she married. The result of a 1753 law meant that the marriage was invalid which would have disinherited the children from the titles. Proceedings were put in place to resolve the situation but it was the changing of the marriage act in 1822 which allowed the eldest son to retain his place in the inheritance.

Lord Donegall died heavily in debt in 1844 at his home at Ormeau, County Down (which formed the basis of Ormeau Park), and was buried in St Nicholas&#x27;s Church, Carrickfergus.

<doc id="865641" wikidata="Q485669" url="?curid=865641" title="Telematics">
<text>Telematics is an interdisciplinary field encompassing telecommunications, vehicular technologies (road transport, road safety, etc.), electrical engineering (sensors, instrumentation, wireless communications, etc.), and computer science (multimedia, Internet, etc.). Telematics can involve any of the following:

* The technology of sending, receiving, and storing information using telecommunication devices to control remote objects
* The integrated use of telecommunications and informatics for application in vehicles and to control vehicles on the move
* Global navigation satellite system technology integrated with computers and mobile communications technology in automotive navigation systems
* (Most narrowly) The use of such systems within road vehicles (also called vehicle telematics)

== History ==
Telematics is a translation of the French word &quot;télématique,&quot; which was first coined by Simon Nora and Alain Minc in a 1978 report to the French government on the computerization of society. It referred to the transfer of information over telecommunications and was a portmanteau blending the French words &quot;télécommunications&quot; (&quot;telecommunications&quot;) and &quot;informatique&quot; (&quot;computing science&quot;). The original broad meaning of telematics continues to be used in academic fields, but in commerce it now generally means vehicle telematics.

== Vehicle telematics ==
Telematics can be described as thus:
# The convergence of telecommunications and information processing, the term later evolved to refer to automation in automobiles, such as the invention of the emergency warning system for vehicles. GPS navigation, integrated hands-free cell phones, wireless safety communications, and automatic driving assistance systems all are covered under the telematics umbrella.
# The science of telecommunications and informatics applied in wireless technologies and computational systems. 802.11p, the IEEE standard in the 802.11 family and also referred to as Wireless Access for the Vehicular Environment (WAVE), is the primary standard that addresses and enhances Intelligent Transport System.

Vehicle telematics can help improve the efficiency of an organization.

=== Vehicle tracking ===
Vehicle tracking is monitoring the location, movements, status, and behavior of a vehicle or fleet of vehicles. This is achieved through a combination of a GPS (GNSS) receiver and an electronic device (usually comprising a GSM GPRS modem or SMS sender) installed in each vehicle, communicating with the user (dispatching, emergency, or co-ordinating unit) and PC-based or web-based software. The data is turned into information by management reporting tools in conjunction with a visual display on computerized mapping software. Vehicle tracking systems may also use odometry or dead reckoning as an alternative or complementary means of navigation.

GPS tracking is usually accurate to around 10–20 meters, but the European Space Agency has developed the EGNOS technology to provide accuracy to 1.5 meters.

=== Trailer tracking ===

Trailer tracking refers to the tracking of movements and position of an articulated vehicle&#x27;s trailer unit through the use of a location unit fitted to the trailer and a method of returning the position data via mobile communication network, IOT (Internet of things), or geostationary satellite communications for use through either PC- or web-based software.

Cold-store freight trailers that deliver fresh or frozen foods are increasingly incorporating telematics to gather time-series data on the temperature inside the cargo container, both to trigger alarms and record an audit trail for business purposes. An increasingly sophisticated array of sensors, many incorporating RFID technology, is being used to ensure the cold chain.

=== Container tracking ===
Freight containers can be tracked by GPS using a similar approach to that used for trailer tracking (i.e. a battery-powered GPS device communicating its position via mobile phone or satellite communications). Benefits of this approach include increased security and the possibility to reschedule the container transport movements based on accurate information about its location. According to Berg Insight, the installed base of tracking units in the intermodal shipping container segment reached 190,000 at the end of 2013. Growing at a compound annual growth rate of 38.2 percent, the installed base reached 960,000 units at the end of 2018.

=== Fleet management ===
Fleet management is the management of a company&#x27;s fleet and includes the management of ships and/or motor vehicles such as cars, vans, and trucks. Fleet (vehicle) management can include a range of functions, such as vehicle financing, vehicle maintenance, vehicle telematics (tracking and diagnostics), driver management, fuel management, health and safety management, and dynamic vehicle scheduling. Fleet management is a function which allows companies that rely on transport in their business to remove or minimize the risks associated with vehicle investment, improving efficiency and productivity while reducing overall transport costs and ensuring compliance with government legislation and Duty of Care obligations. These functions can either be dealt with by an in-house fleet management department or an outsourced fleet management provider.

=== Telematics standards ===

The Association of Equipment Management Professionals (AEMP) developed the industry&#x27;s first telematics standard.
In 2008, AEMP brought together the major construction equipment manufacturers and telematics providers in the heavy equipment industry to discuss the development of the industry&#x27;s first telematics standard. Following agreement from Caterpillar, Volvo CE, Komatsu, and John Deere Construction &amp; Forestry to support such a standard, the AEMP formed a standards development subcommittee chaired by Pat Crail CEM to develop the standard. This committee consisted of developers provided by the Caterpillar/Trimble joint venture known as Virtual Site Solutions, Volvo CE, and John Deere. This group worked from February 2009 through September 2010 to develop the industry&#x27;s first standard for the delivery of telematics data. 
The result, the AEMP Telematics Data Standard V1.1, was released in 2010 and officially went live on October 1, 2010. As of November 1, 2010, Caterpillar, Volvo CE, John Deere Construction &amp; Forestry, OEM Data Delivery, and Navman Wireless are able to support customers with delivery of basic telematics data in a standard xml format. Komatsu, Topcon, and others are finishing beta testing and have indicated their ability to support customers in the near future.

The AEMP&#x27;s telematics data standard was developed to allow end users to integrate key telematics data (operating hours, location, fuel consumed, and odometer reading where applicable) into their existing fleet management reporting systems. As such, the standard was primarily intended to facilitate importation of these data elements into enterprise software systems such as those used by many medium-to-large construction contractors. Prior to the standard, end users had few options for integrating this data into their reporting systems in a mixed-fleet environment consisting of multiple brands of machines and a mix of telematics-equipped machines and legacy machines (those without telematics devices where operating data is still reported manually via pen and paper). One option available to machine owners was to visit multiple websites to manually retrieve data from each manufacturer&#x27;s telematics interface and then manually enter it into their fleet management program&#x27;s database. This option was cumbersome and labor-intensive.

A second option was for the end user to develop an API (Application Programming Interface), or program, to integrate the data from each telematics provider into their database. This option was quite costly as each telematics provider had different procedures for accessing and retrieving the data and the data format varied from provider to provider. This option automated the process, but because each provider required a unique, custom API to retrieve and parse the data, it was an expensive option. In addition, another API had to be developed any time another brand of machine or telematics device was added to the fleet.

A third option for mixed-fleet integration was to replace the various factory-installed telematics devices with devices from a third party telematics provider. Although this solved the problem of having multiple data providers requiring unique integration methods, this was by far the most expensive option. In addition to the expense, many third-party devices available for construction equipment are unable to access data directly from the machine&#x27;s electronic control modules (ECMs), or computers, and are more limited than the device installed by the OEM (Cat, Volvo, Deere, Komatsu, etc.) in the data they are able to provide. In some cases, these devices are limited to location and engine runtime, although they are increasingly able to accommodate a number of add-on sensors to provide additional data.

The AEMP Telematics Data Standard provides a fourth option. By concentrating on the key data elements that drive the majority of fleet management reports (hours, miles, location, fuel consumption), making those data elements available in a standardized xml format, and standardizing the means by which the document is retrieved, the standard enables the end user to use one API to retrieve data from any participating telematics provider (as opposed to the unique API for each provider that was required previously), greatly reducing integration development costs.

The current draft version of the AEMP Telematics Data Standard is now called the AEM/AEMP Draft Telematics API Standard, which expands the original standard Version 1.2 to include 19 data fields (with fault code capability). This new draft standard is a collaborative effort of AEMP and the Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM), working on behalf of their members and the industry. This Draft API replaces the current version 1.2 and does not currently cover some types of equipment, e.g., agriculture equipment, cranes, mobile elevating work platforms, air compressors, and other niche products.

In addition to the new data fields, the AEM/AEMP Draft Telematics API Standard changes how data is accessed in an effort to make it easier to consume and integrate with other systems and processes. It includes standardized communication protocols for the ability to transfer telematics information in mixed-equipment fleets to end user business enterprise systems, enabling the end user to employ their own business software to collect and then analyze asset data from mixed-equipment fleets without the need to work across multiple telematics provider applications.

To achieve a globally recognized standard for conformity worldwide, the AEM/AEMP Draft Telematics API Standard will be submitted for acceptance by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Final language is dependent upon completion of the ISO acceptance process.

=== Satellite navigation ===
Satellite navigation in the context of vehicle telematics is the technology of using a GPS and electronic mapping tool to enable a driver to locate a position, plan a route, and navigate a journey.

=== Mobile data ===
Mobile data is the use of wireless data communications using radio waves to send and receive real-time computer data to, from, and between devices used by field-based personnel. These devices can be fitted solely for use while in the vehicle (Fixed Data Terminal) or for use in and out of the vehicle (Mobile Data Terminal). See mobile Internet.

The common methods for mobile data communication for telematics were based on private vendors&#x27; RF communication infrastructure. During the early 2000s, manufacturers of mobile data terminals/AVL devices moved to try cellular data communication to offer cheaper ways to transmit telematics information and wider range based on cellular provider coverage. Since then, as a result of cellular providers offering low GPRS (2.5G) and later UMTS (3G) rates, mobile data is almost totally offered to telematics customers via cellular communication.

=== Wireless vehicle safety communications ===
Wireless vehicle safety communications telematics aid in car safety and road safety. It is an electronic subsystem in a vehicle used for exchanging safety information about road hazards and the locations and speeds of vehicles over short-range radio links. This may involve temporary ad hoc wireless local area networks.

Wireless units are often installed in vehicles and fixed locations, such as near traffic signals and emergency call boxes along the road. Sensors in vehicles and at fixed locations, as well as in possible connections to wider networks, provide information displayed to drivers. The range of the radio links can be extended by forwarding messages along multi-hop paths. Even without fixed units, information about fixed hazards can be maintained by moving vehicles by passing it backwards. It also seems possible for traffic lights, which one can expect to become smarter, to use this information to reduce the chance of collisions.

In the future, it may connect directly to the adaptive cruise control or other vehicle control aids. Cars and trucks with the wireless system connected to their brakes may move in convoys to save fuel and space on the roads. When a column member slows down, those behind it will automatically slow also. Certain scenarios may required less engineering effort, such as when a radio beacon is connected to a brake light.

In fall 2008, network ideas were tested in Europe, where radio frequency bandwidth had been allocated. The 30 MHz allocated is at 5.9 GHz, and unallocated bandwidth at 5.4 GHz may also be used. The standard is IEEE 802.11p, a low-latency form of the Wi-Fi local area network standard. Similar efforts are underway in Japan and the USA.

===Emergency warning system for vehicles===
Telematics technologies are self-orientating open network architecture structures of variable programmable intelligent beacons developed for application in the development of intelligent vehicles with the intent to accord (blend or mesh) warning information with surrounding vehicles in the vicinity of travel, intra-vehicle, and infrastructure. Emergency warning systems for vehicle telematics are developed particularly for international harmonization and standardization of vehicle-to-vehicle, infrastructure-to-vehicle, and vehicle-to-infrastructure real-time Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) systems.

Telematics most commonly relate to computerized systems that update information at the same rate they receive data, enabling them to direct or control a process such as an instantaneous autonomous warning notification in a remote machine or group of machines. In the use of telematics relating to intelligent vehicle technologies, instantaneous direction travel cognizance of a vehicle may be transmitted in real-time to surrounding vehicles traveling in the local area of vehicles equipped (with EWSV) to receive said warning signals of danger.

===Intelligent vehicle technologies===
Telematics comprise electronic, electromechanical, and electromagnetic devices—usually silicon micro-machined components operating in conjunction with computer-controlled devices and radio transceivers to provide precision repeatability functions (such as in robotics artificial intelligence systems) emergency warning validation performance reconstruction.

Intelligent vehicle technologies commonly apply to car safety systems and self-contained autonomous electromechanical sensors generating warnings that can be transmitted within a specified targeted area of interest, i.e. within 100 meters of the emergency warning system for the vehicle&#x27;s transceiver. In ground applications, intelligent vehicle technologies are utilized for safety and commercial communications between vehicles or between a vehicle and a sensor along the road.

On November 3, 2009, the most advanced Intelligent Vehicle concept car was demonstrated in New York City when a 2010 Toyota Prius became the first LTE connected car. The demonstration was provided by the NG Connect project, a collaboration of automotive telematic technologies designed to exploit in-car 4G wireless network connectivity.

===Carsharing===
Telematics technology has enabled the emergence of carsharing services such as Local Motion, Uber, Lyft, Car2Go, Zipcar worldwide, or City Car Club in the UK. Telematics-enabled computers allow organizers to track members&#x27; usage and bill them on a pay-as-you-drive basis. Some systems show users where to find an idle vehicle. Car Clubs such as Australia&#x27;s Charter Drive use telematics to monitor and report on vehicle use within predefined geofence areas to demonstrate the reach of their transit media car club fleet.

===Auto insurance/Usage-based insurance (UBI)===
The general idea of telematics auto insurance is that a driver&#x27;s behavior is monitored directly while the person drives and this information is transmitted to an insurance company. The insurance company then assesses the risk of that driver having an accident and charges insurance premiums accordingly. A driver who drives less responsibly will be charged a higher premium than a driver who drives smoothly and with less calculated risk of claim propensity. Other benefits can be delivered to end users with Telematics2.0-based telematics as customer engagement can be enhanced with direct customer interaction.

Telematics auto insurance was independently invented and patented by a major U.S. auto insurance company, Progressive Auto Insurance , and a Spanish independent inventor, Salvador Minguijon Perez (European Patent EP0700009B1). The Perez patents cover monitoring the car&#x27;s engine control computer to determine distance driven, speed, time of day, braking force, etc. Progressive is currently developing the Perez technology in the U.S. and European auto insurer Norwich Union is developing the Progressive technology for Europe. Both patents have since been overturned in courts due to prior work in the commercial insurance sectors.

Trials conducted by Norwich Union in 2005 found that young drivers (18- to 23-year-olds) signing up for telematics auto insurance have had a 20% lower accident rate than average. 

In 2007, theoretical economic research on the social welfare effects of Progressive&#x27;s telematics technology business process patents questioned whether the business process patents are pareto efficient for society. Preliminary results suggested that it was not, but more work is needed. In April 2014, Progressive patents were overturned by the U.S. legal system on the grounds of &quot;lack of originality.&quot;

The smartphone as the in-vehicle device for insurance telematics has been discussed in great detail and the instruments are available for the design of smartphone-driven insurance telematics.

<text>The Crystal World is a science fiction novel by English author J. G. Ballard, published in 1966. The novel tells the story of a physician trying to make his way deep into the jungle to a secluded leprosy treatment facility. While trying to make it to his destination, his chaotic path leads him to try to come to terms with an apocalyptic phenomenon in the jungle that crystallises everything it touches.

Ballard previously used the theme of apocalyptic crystallisation in the 1964 short story &quot;The Illuminated Man&quot; (included in &quot;The Terminal Beach&quot;), which is also set in the same locations.

== Plot summary ==

The protagonist is Edward Sanders, an English medical doctor, who arrives at the river port of Port Matarre, in Cameroon. From here he tries to reach a leprosy treatment facility where his friends, Max and Suzanne Clair, live. Soon, however, he starts to recognize that a mysterious phenomenon is crystallizing the jungle along with its living creatures. The same phenomenon is reported to be present in the Florida everglades and in the Pripyat Marshes (Soviet Union) as well. Scientific explanations of the phenomenon are provided within the book: however, Ballard offers mostly an interior and psychological perspective about it, directly through Sanders&#x27; experiences. Several facts, furthermore, remain unexplained: for example, the ability of jewels to liquefy the crystals. The crystals also have the property to keep objects and beings in a suspended state of existence. Many passages deal with this characteristic, pointing out its capability to stop time and life.

In his route towards the deep of the forest, Sanders gets involved in a personal feud between Ventress, a Belgian architect, and Thorensen, the director of a diamond mine. In one of the most striking episodes of the novel, Sanders discovers the reason of the deadly rivalry to be Ventress&#x27; former wife, Serena, who is terminally ill with tuberculosis. After a final confrontation, Thorensen decides to remain in his house within the jungle, in spite of the encroaching crystallization process. Two of the other characters met by Sanders in his voyage spontaneously make the same decision: Balthus, an apostate priest, and Suzanne. The latter, nearly gone mad and sporting the first symptoms of leprosy, is portrayed towards the end of the novel as the leader of a band of lepers who set for the interior of the crystallizing forest, clearly to never come back.

After having barely escaped from the now quickly spreading crystallization, Sanders reaches Port Matarre. Here, however, he makes the same decision as Balthus and Suzanne. In the final pages, Sanders goes back to the river to face the same fate as Suzanne.

==Reception==
Richard A. Lupoff described &quot;The Crystal World&quot; as the best of Ballard&#x27;s &quot;catastrophe novels&quot;, saying it was &quot;Idiosyncratic but highly effective [and] a very important science fiction book.&quot;

<text>Royal Air Force Bampton Castle or RAF Bampton Castle is a former non-flying Royal Air Force station near Bampton Castle, Oxfordshire, England.

The base was established by the Royal Corps of Signals in 1939 and handed over to the RAF in 1969. It was the home of No. 2 and No. 81 Signal Units, which dealt with high frequency radio communications. Day-to-day operations were overseen (parented in RAF speak) by RAF Brize Norton due to the larger base&#x27;s proximity to Bampton Castle and that Brize was the home of No. 38 Group Tactical Communications Wing RAF (and successors until 2006).

The station closed progressively between 2003 and 2006 when the RAF&#x27;s high frequency communications system was replaced by the Defence High Frequency Communications Service. Approximately seventy-two masts were removed in December 2003 and the final two removed in 2015. The site is now in use as a business centre.

<doc id="865657" wikidata="Q2597876" url="?curid=865657" title="Xbox Development Kit">
<text>The Xbox Development Kit (XDK) is a software development kit created by Microsoft used to write software for the 2001 Xbox gaming system. The XDK includes libraries, a compiler, and various tools used to create software for the Xbox. The XDK has the option to integrate itself into Microsoft Visual Studio 2002 or 2003. This is needed if one wants to develop applications or games for the Xbox. The XDK also includes a tool to record in-game footage, which has been widely used to create high-quality screenshots and trailers.

==Purpose==
The XDK allows software creators to create, run and distribute applications on the Xbox platform. Xbox 360 XDKs were based on all three generations of the Xbox 360 Design (&quot;Phat&quot;, &quot;Slim&quot; and &quot;E&quot;). There were XNA Kits, which were used at some expos and given to game studios, Stress Kits, which were used to test the power of the Xbox 360 and various conditions such as undervolting and overvolting and issued to Microsoft developers only, and Demo kits, which were used to demo games. Some but not all XDKs include a sidecar which was used to emulate the DVD drive and act as a hard drive and on older XDKs with older recoveries, used for PIX Debugging. Bundled with XDKs is the Xbox 360 SDK used to connect to the console, enable memory editing, file management, and integrate to Visual Studio 2010 for Xbox 360 game development.

==Xbox development environment==
The Xbox BIOS is based on the NT 5.0 kernel, but does not have all of the resources or capabilities of the Windows 2000 operating system, (for example: neither DirectShow, registry, or DLL are natively supported on the Xbox). Because of the constraints on the hardware and environment of the Xbox, all software development for the Xbox (and all video game consoles systems in general) are focused on reserving the limited resources that exist, the main limitation of which is the amount of available RAM.

==Xbox embedded operating system==
*The Xbox does not have an operating system per se, instead it only has a simple BIOS.
**Everything else must go into the main executable and its (XDK and own-made) libraries.
*Only a single process (executable program) can run at a time on the Xbox.
*Xbox hard drive file system (FATX) has many limitations, among them a maximum file name length of 42 characters.
*The Xbox has four non-standard USB ports but the Xbox SDK does not contain a full USB stack, thus to add support for USB hardware devices, the developer would have to code the entire USB stack from scratch.

==XDK and Xbox specific software limitations==
This is a list of XDK, Xbox hardware, and Xbox operating system specific limitations.

*UDF (Universal Disk Format) file system limitation: The Xbox only supports UDF version 1.02 (designed for DVD-Video), which has a maximum file size of 1 GB (Gigabyte) (a DVD in a newer UDF version with a video that is larger than 1GB will not play), with the same applying to UDF/ISO hybrid formats (a.k.a. UDF Bridge format). A workaround is to burn discs in the ISO 9660 format. The ISO 9660 format has a 2 GB maximum file size, which cannot be bypassed.
*The Xbox hard disk is formatted in FATX (File Allocation Table for Xbox) which has a 4 GB (4096 Megabyte) maximum file size, and only supports file/folder names up to 42 characters, a maximum of 255 character full path, and a maximum number of 4096 files/folders in a single folder, plus in the root of each partition, the maximum number of files/folders is 256. FATX also does not support all standard ASCII characters in file/folder names (for example &lt; &gt; = ? : ; &quot; * +, / \|¤ &amp;).
*The USB flash drive reader/writer class used by the Xbox operating system has a few limitations as well. It is limited to USB flash drives and hard disks compatible with USB Mass Storage Device Class following the USB 1.1 standard, with a maximum size of 4 GB. It can read and write to FATX formatted flash drives, but can only read FAT12, FAT16 (including VFAT), and FAT32. NTFS formatted drives are not supported yet.
*With its 733 MHz Intel Pentium III-like CPU and 64 MB shared memory, the Xbox has neither a fast enough CPU nor sufficient RAM to play HDTV videos encoded in native 720p/1080i resolution. However, the Xbox can upscale all standard definition movies and output them at 720p or 1080i.

<doc id="865668" wikidata="Q571133" url="?curid=865668" title="Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array">
<text>The Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA) is a neutrino telescope located beneath the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station. In 2005, after nine years of operation, AMANDA officially became part of its successor project, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.

AMANDA consists of optical modules, each containing one photomultiplier tube, sunk in Antarctic ice cap at a depth of about 1500 to 1900 metres. In its latest development stage, known as AMANDA-II, AMANDA is made up of an array of 677 optical modules mounted on 19 separate strings that are spread out in a rough circle with a diameter of 200 metres. Each string has several dozen modules, and was put in place by &quot;drilling&quot; a hole in the ice using a hot-water hose, sinking the cable with attached optical modules in, and then letting the ice freeze around it.

AMANDA detects very high energy neutrinos (50+ GeV) which pass through the Earth from the northern hemisphere and then react just as they are leaving upwards through the Antarctic ice. The neutrino interacts with nuclei of oxygen or hydrogen atoms contained in the surrounding water ice through the weak nuclear force, producing a muon and a hadronic shower. The optical modules detect the Cherenkov radiation from these latter particles, and by analysis of the timing of photon hits can approximately determine the direction of the original neutrino with a spatial resolution of approximately 2 degrees.

AMANDA&#x27;s goal was an attempt at neutrino astronomy, identifying and characterizing extra-solar sources of neutrinos. Compared to underground detectors like Super-Kamiokande in Japan, AMANDA was capable of looking at higher energy neutrinos because it is not limited in volume to a manmade tank; however, it had much less accuracy because of the less controlled conditions and wider spacing of photomultipliers. Super-Kamiokande can look at much greater detail at neutrinos from the Sun and those generated in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere; however, at higher energies, the spectrum should include neutrinos dominated by those from sources outside the solar system. Such a new view into the cosmos could give important clues in the search for dark matter and other astrophysical phenomena.

After two years of integrated operation as part of IceCube, the AMANDA counting house (in the Martin A. Pomerantz Observatory) was decommissioned in July and August 2009.

<doc id="865675" wikidata="Q486066" url="?curid=865675" title="Sukhoi Superjet 100">
<text>The Yakovlev Superjet 100 or SJ-100 (until August 2023: Sukhoi Superjet 100 [SSJ100], ) is a regional jet designed by Russian aircraft company Sukhoi Civil Aircraft, a division of the United Aircraft Corporation (now: Regional Aircraft – Branch of the Irkut Corporation). With development starting in 2000, it made its maiden flight on 19 May 2008 and its first commercial flight on 21 April 2011 with Armavia.

The MTOW plane typically seats 87 to 98 passengers and is powered by two PowerJet SaM146 turbofans developed by a joint venture between French Safran and Russian NPO Saturn. By May 2018, 127 were in service and by September the fleet had logged 300,000 revenue flights and 460,000 hours. By November 2021 the fleet had logged at least 2 million hours. The type has recorded four hull loss accidents and 89 deaths . 

In 2022, Sukhoi announced a Russified version of the body and electronics, without most of the Western components; the engines are replaced by the Aviadvigatel PD-8 model. Aeroflot has ordered 89 Irkut SSJ-Russified aircraft. In August 2023, parent company Irkut rebranded itself as Yakovlev, with the Superjet to be known as the SJ-100.

== Development ==
=== Background ===
JSC Sukhoi was incorporated in May 2000 to develop the first all-new commercial aircraft in post-Soviet Russia.
Studies of the Russian Regional Jet (RRJ) began in 2001. After analysing the Russian market, Sukhoi identified a need for an aircraft with a range of between , greater than typical regional jets. Three variants were initially envisaged: the RRJ60, RRJ75 and RRJ95, with 60, 78 and 98 seats respectively; a five-abreast layout was chosen as being optimal for this size range. Sukhoi estimated the targeted market to be around 800 aircraft, including 250–300 from Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States.

On 15 October 2001, the Russian government allocated $46.6 million to the development of a new 70–80 seat regional jet, targeting first flight in 2006 and entry into service in 2007.
Sukhoi&#x27;s RRJ was competing against Myasishchev&#x27;s M-60-70 and Tupolev&#x27;s Tu-414 projects. Boeing provided advice to Sukhoi and its partners on programme management, engineering, marketing, product development, certification, supplier management and customer support. The Sukhoi RRJ was selected by Rosaviakosmos, the government&#x27;s aviation and space agency, in March 2003.

The RRJ programme allocated $63.5 million to the development of a engine between 2003 and 2015. Four engines were initially envisaged: the Pratt &amp; Whitney PW800, the Rolls-Royce BR710, the General Electric CF34-8, and the Snecma/NPO Saturn SaM146.
The BR710 and the CF34-8 were eliminated by July 2002, and the PW800 was subsequently rejected due to a perceived technical risk associated with its geared fan.
A formal memorandum of understanding was signed with Snecma on 29 April 2003, confirming the selection of the SaM146,
to be developed in a joint venture with NPO Saturn, based on the Snecma SPW14 and combining a Snecma DEM21 gas generator with an Aviadvigatel &quot;cold section&quot;.

Key suppliers were selected in October 2003, including Thales for avionics, Messier-Bugatti-Dowty for landing gear, Honeywell for the auxiliary power unit, Liebherr for flight controls, Intertechnique for fuel systems, Parker Hannifin for hydraulic systems, B/E Aerospace for interiors.
At this time, Sukhoi anticipated a market for 600 aircraft by 2020representing 10% of global demand for regional jetsfor a total sales volume of $11 billion.
Discussions were held with Air France and the SkyTeam alliance to ensure that the aircraft would meet western requirements.
An application for EASA certification was made in 2004 and was expected to be granted six months after the Russian approval.

The Komsomolsk-on-Amur plant was selected in February 2005 for final assembly, implementing jig-less assembly, automatic component alignment and automatic riveting.
The RRJ60 and RRJ75 were deemed to be less cost-effective, and development was focused on the largest model, the 98-seat RRJ95. The 78-seater RRJ75 remained under consideration, and a future stretch was also envisaged.
The RRJ95 was renamed the Sukhoi Superjet 100 at the Farnborough Air Show in July 2005.
The first order, for 30 aircraft, was signed on 7 December with Aeroflot.

In June 2007, Boeing expanded its assistance to cover flight and maintenance crew training and manuals, and spare parts management and supply. On 22 August, Sukhoi and Alenia Aeronautica established the SuperJet International joint venture for customer support outside Russia and Asia. Alenia Aeronautica took a 25% stake in Sukhoi Civil Aircraft Corporation (SCAC) for $250 million, valuing it at $1 billion.
Development costs were expected to total $1 billion, with another $1 billion needed to develop the powerplant and for customer support.

=== Flight testing ===
The first SSJ was transported in an Antonov 124 from Komsomolsk-on-Amur to Zhukovsky, Moscow Oblast on 28 January 2007, for ground tests conducted by the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI). The SuperJet was officially unveiled on 26 September 2007 at Dzyomgi Airport in Komsomolsk-on-Amur. By October 2007, initial deliveries were scheduled for 2009; plans called for the 95–98-seat model to be followed by a 75–78-seat shrink and a 110-seat stretch.

The SaM146 engine was first run on 21 February 2008. Tests were conducted by the Gromov Flight Research Institute, using an Ilyushin Il-76LL as a flying test bed. The SuperJet 100 made its maiden flight on 19 May 2008, taking off from Komsomolsk-on-Amur. By July, certification was expected for the third quarter of 2009, pushing back deliveries to later the same quarter.
On 24 December 2008, the second SSJ made its maiden flight.

By January 2009, the first two aircraft had completed over 80 flights, and the engines had accumulated 2,300 hours of tests. In April 2009, the two prototypes were flown from Novosibirsk to Moscow, and EASA pilots conducted a number of familiarisation flights. A third prototype joined the test campaign in July 2009.

The SSJ made its international debut at the 2009 Paris Air Show; during the show, Malév Hungarian Airlines placed a $1 billion order for 30 aircraft.
As of June 2009, 13 aircraft were under construction, with the first four scheduled to be handed over to clients from December. Armenian Armavia was to receive the first two, followed by Aeroflot, having ordered 30 with an option for 15 more. Other customers include Russian Avialeasing, Swiss AMA Asset Management Advisor, and Indonesian Kartika Airlines. Sukhoi expected production to reach a rate of 70 aircraft per year by 2012.

In December 2009, engine availability issues resulted in deliveries being delayed indefinitely. On 4 February 2010, the fourth prototype made its maiden flight using engines removed from the first prototype, as a result of continuing delays in engine production, including NPO Saturn quality problems.
On 15 September 2010, static tests for certification of the aircraft were completed by TsAGI.

=== Certification ===

By June 2010, certification was 90% complete but was delayed due to SaM146 engine problems that were not encountered during testing.
In September 2010, certification was expected for November. In October 2010, noise was tested for certification authorities, Russian IAC and European EASA. On 4 November 2010, the first production aircraft, intended for Armavia, was first flown.
By November 2010, the SSJ test fleet had made 948 flights totalling 2,245 hours.

On 3 February 2011, IAC granted a Type Certificate.
EASA&#x27;s Type Certificate followed on 3 February 2012, allowing operations in European countries.

On 14 March 2022, EASA revoked the Superjet&#x27;s airworthiness certificate as part of the EU&#x27;s sanctions against Russia following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

=== In-service developments ===
In summer 2017, the business jet variant&#x27;s additional fuel tanks were certified to carry 3,100 kg (6,800 lb) more fuel, increasing range from to .

London City Airport is a major destination for Irish airline CityJet, which was to receive 15 SSJ100s, but its steep 5.5° approach required new control laws, wing flap setting and modified brakes: test flights were to begin in December 2017, with certification planned for 2018, and the modified aircraft to be available in 2019. In any event, CityJet ceased all use of SSJ-100 aircraft by November of 2020.

A new &quot;sabrelet&quot; winglet, helping takeoff and landing performance and delivering 3% better fuel burn, will be standard and available for retrofit.
Designed with CFD tools by Sukhoi and TsAGI, the &quot;saberlets&quot; debuted flight tests on 21 December 2017.
They should improve hot and high airport performance and cut costs up to $70,000 per year.
Parts of the wing are reinforced for the aerodynamic loads distribution change.
They should reduce fuel costs by 4%. Flight-testing was completed after over 140 flights by October 2019.
The first aircraft with the composite winglets was delivered to Russian carrier Severstal Aircompany in December 2019.

By November 2018, the TsAGI carried out wind tunnel tests on two modified wing designs to save structural weight: one with less wing sweep and the other with more relative thickness, also enhancing aerodynamics and load capabilities, and improving fuel efficiency by nearly 10%.

=== Russified SSJ ===

To resist the Airbus–Boeing duopoly pressure on regional jets through the Embraer E-Jet E2 (once set to become a Boeing product, after its later failed acquisition of Embraer) and the Airbus A220, Sukhoi would upgrade the SSJ100 to the SSJ100B and the &quot;Russianised&quot; SSJ100R. Western content accounts for 55–60% of the original SSJ100&#x27;s cost but sanctions against Russia were tightening by 2018. As of December 2018, the US authorities did not send any feedback to Sukhoi over exports to Iran. The SSJ100B would feature more powerful SaM146-1S18 engines, improved avionics software, enhanced high-lift devices controls and retrofittable &quot;sabrelet&quot; blended wingtip devices. After 2021 the SSJ100R would replace western components by Russian ones for government customers and countries subject to international sanctions such as Iran Air Tours and Iran Aseman.

SSJ100R could include a smaller variant of the Aviadvigatel PD-14 engine (Aviadvigatel PD-8); KRET electronic units to replace the Thales avionics; a Russian inertial navigation system and APU to replace Honeywell&#x27;s; and the landing gear to replace one produced by Safran. Fuel burn would be reduced by 5–8% with a new composite wing. Russian content should double to 30% as US restrictions limit its export potential. Sukhoi forecasts 345 sales from 2018 to 2030, mostly in post-Soviet states and some in south-east Asia and Latin America, including an improved range business jet version. The seating capacity is to be raised to 110, and hot and high operations to 4000 m and 50 °C. A freighter variant is also being studied. Russian government has earmarked ₽3.2 billion ($51 million) toward the variant of the SSJ with indigenous propulsion and avionics, introduced at the Eurasia Airshow 2018 in Antalya alongside the SSJ75.

In May 2021, Rostec announced the completion of the first experimental core &#x27;hot section&#x27; of the PD-8 engine. The &#x27;Russified&#x27; variant of the SSJ with the composite wing, indigenous avionics and the PD-8 engine later became known as the SSJ-New. In July 2021, UEC exhibited the new engine at the 2021 Moscow Air Show and aimed to secure type certification by 2023. In January 2022, a new control system, developed by UEC for the PD-8 engine, was being tested prior to integration with the engine.
The full domestic fabrications plan will take place in 2023 to 2024, replacing Western components.

Under a plan announced in June 2022 to bring the proportion of domestically produced aircraft to 80% of the Russian fleet by the end of the decade following the international sanctions brought in after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, serial production of the SSJ-New was targeted for 2023. In July 2022, a prototype SSJ-New fuselage was transported to test facilities near Moscow to undergo life cycle testing. Further prototypes were assembled in 2023, with structural testing of the updated airframe and certification of the PD-8 engine both expected to be completed by the autumn. As of May 2023, serial production was expected to begin in 2024. 

Yakovlev carried out the first flight of its new version of the Superjet 100 featuring all-Russian componentsnow known as the SJ-100in August 2023, albeit with SaM146 engines rather than the intended PD-8s. As of mid-2024, the engine manufacturer was implementing a strategy of using a computer model of the PD-8 for testing in order to reduce the number of required real engine tests, so as to accelerate PD-8 certification.

=== Irkut Corporation integration ===
At the end of November 2018, United Aircraft Corporation transferred from Sukhoi to the Irkut Corporation, to become UAC&#x27;s airliner division, as Leonardo S.p.A. pulled out in early 2017 because of Superjet&#x27;s poor financial performance. Irkut managed the Superjet 100, the MC-21 and the Russo-Chinese CR929 widebody, but the Il-114 passenger turboprop and modernized Ilyushin Il-96-400 widebody stayed with Ilyushin. The new commercial division also included the Yakovlev Design Bureau, avionics specialist UAC–Integration Center and composite manufacturer AeroComposit. The aircraft was to be known simply as the Superjet 100, dropping the Sukhoi name.

In July 2023, Irkut announced that the entire company would be rebranded under the Yakovlev name, to be effective by the end of August, though it did not specify whether the Superjet would undergo a further change of designation. The name change was confirmed in August; the Superjet is to drop the Sukhoi name and be known as the SJ-100.

===Potential Sukhoi divestment of SuperJet===
In March 2023, a deal was announced that would see UAC completely exit the Superjet 100 programme by selling its entire stake in SuperJet International (SJI) to an Emirati investment fund, Markab Capital Investments. A new factory would be built at Al Ain International Airport, Abu Dhabi, where aircraft would be assembled before completion at SJI&#x27;s Venice site. The deal would be conditional on SJI&#x27;s assets being unfrozen by the European Union. With a new supply chain to be established in Italy by Leonardo to service the Abu Dhabi production line, and the sale of intellectual property, it is unclear how Russian production of the SSJ-New, now solely limited to servicing Russia&#x27;s domestic market, could continue under the deal.

== Design ==
=== Concept ===
The five-abreast cross-section is more optimised beyond 70 seats than the four-abreast Bombardier CRJs and Embraer E-Jets but smaller than the six-abreast Airbus A320 and Boeing 737.
The SSJ100 typically seats 87 to 98 passengers. In Russia, it replaces the aging Tupolev Tu-134 and Yakovlev Yak-42 aircraft. It competes with the Antonov An-148, Embraer E190 and the Bombardier CRJ1000. Sukhoi claims cash operational costs are lower than competitors by 8-10%, with reduced fuel burn per seat and longer maintenance intervals. The design meets CIS AP-25, US FAR-25 and EU JAR-25 aviation rules, and conforms to ICAO Chapter 4 and FAR 36 Section 4 noise standards from 2006.

=== Development cost and state aid ===
The Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade supports it as a priority project. In 2010, development costs were $1.4 billion excluding the SaM146 engine, with 25% funded from the federal budget, rising to US$ 1.5 billion by 2013. Unit cost was US$31–35 million in 2012, rising to a US$50.1 million base price in 2018.

=== Engines ===

==== PowerJet SaM146 ====
Over 30 foreign partnerships are involved in the design and production of the aircraft. The SaM146 engines are developed, manufactured and marketed by PowerJet, a joint-venture between French Safran Aircraft Engines (formerly Snecma) and Russia&#x27;s NPO Saturn. The PowerJet SaM146 turbofans provide of thrust for a 70–120 seat aircraft.

==== Aviadvigatel PD-8 ====
In May 2021, Rostec announced the completion of the first experimental core &#x27;hot section&#x27; of the PD-8 engine. Under a plan announced in June 2022 following international sanctions after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, prototypes of an all-Russian SJ-100 were assembled in 2023, with structural testing of the updated airframe and certification of the Aviadvigatel PD-8 engine both expected to be completed by autumn 2023. Serial production was expected to begin in 2024.

Yakovlev carried out the first flight of its new version of the Superjet 100 featuring all-Russian components – now known as the SJ-100 – in August 2023, albeit with SaM146 engines rather than the intended PD-8s. As of mid-2024, the engine manufacturer was implementing a strategy of using a computer model of the PD-8 for testing in order to reduce the number of required real engine tests, so as to accelerate PD-8 certification.

In February 2025, Vladimir Artjakov of Rostec stated that PD-8 engines had now been delivered to the production site of the SJ-100 in Komsomolsk and that flight testing of the new engine was to begin as soon as possible. The first newly-designed SJ-100, with mostly Russian parts, are planned for 2026.

== Production and marketing ==

=== Assembly ===
Assembly is performed at the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Plant in the Russian Far East, while the Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association produces components; both are upgrading their facilities and were expecting to produce 70 airframes by 2012.

=== Marketing ===
A joint venture between Alenia (later part of Leonardo S.p.A.) and Sukhoi, SuperJet International, was responsible for marketing in Europe, the Americas, Africa, Japan and Oceania, though Leonardo pulled out in early 2017 because of Superjet&#x27;s poor financial performance and Sukhoi regained a 100% share in . 

== Operational history ==
=== Introduction ===
On 19 April 2011, the first production aircraft was handed over to Armavia at Zvartnots Airport in Yerevan, to be operated to Moscow and Sochi, as well as Ukrainian cities. The aircraft was named after Yuri Gagarin.
On 21 April, the first commercial flight landed at Moscow Sheremetyevo, lasting 2 h 55 min; Armavia used the Airbus A319 on this route before switching to the Superjet 100.
On 1 May, it made its first commercial flight to Venice Airport in around 4 hours, it had accumulated 50 hours in 24 flights by then.
By March 2012, the six aircraft operated by Aeroflot were flying 3.9 hours/day instead of the standard 8–9 hours due to failures and parts delivery delays, and the airline asked for compensation.
In August 2012, Armavia announced that it had returned both of its SSJ100s to the manufacturer.
Armavia then avoided further deliveries.

In February 2013, Sukhoi stated teething problems are usual in new airliners.

The SSJ entered service with Mexican Interjet on 18 September 2013; in their first four weeks, the first two aircraft operated were flown 580 times over 600 hours with a daily utilisation of 9.74 hours and a dispatch reliability of 99.03%.

By June 2014, Interjet had received seven SSJ100s and the dispatch reliability had increased to 99.7%.
On 12 September 2014, Interjet started regular passenger flights to the US, on the Monterrey, Mexico, – San Antonio, Texas, route. However, Interjet confirmed by January of 2020 that it was planning to phase out its SSJ100 fleet; but was unable, while sold all other but one plane of all other models. By November of that year it kept 3 or 4 of its 22 SSJ100 potentially able to fly, using other planes for parts; and in December the company was closed because was unable to continue operation. 

On 3 June 2016, the Irish carrier CityJet was the first western European airline to take delivery of an SSJ100. But CityJet had ceased all use of SSJ-100 aircraft by November of 2020.

=== Dependability ===

On 24 December 2016, the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency grounded seven jets after a tail component of an IrAero SSJ100 showed metal fatigue, leading Sukhoi to inspect the entire fleet. By 27 December, all aircraft had been inspected and it had been shown that the defect was not systemic as it featured multiple redundancies and a safety margin doubling the normal loads. Interjet grounded half of its fleet of SSJ100s during this period, but all of its aircraft returned to service by the first week of January 2017 after Sukhoi sent 22 technicians to repair the grounded aircraft.
In June 2017, dispatch reliability increased to 97.85% from 96.94% a year earlier, while there were 89.6 malfunctions per 1,000 flight-hours, down by 40%.
On 21 July 2017, following the discovery of horizontal stabiliser rear spar cracks, the EASA mandated compulsory inspections. Sukhoi recognised it needed to improve customer support with more responsiveness and availability for flight training, engineering and spare parts supply. In early November 2017, the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency and Italian Civil Aviation Authority (ENAC) amended their bilateral airworthiness agreement, hitting SSJ export sales. Interjet claimed its capital cost for 10 Superjets was equivalent to the pre-delivery payment for one Airbus A320.
The pre-delivery payment amounts to 15-30% of an aircraft list price.
An A320 list price was $88.3M in 2012.
In January 2018, &quot;Bloomberg&quot; reported that four of Interjet&#x27;s 22 SSJ100s were being cannibalised for parts to keep others running after having been grounded for at least five months because of SaM146 maintenance delays. This was later refuted by Interjet. One grounded SSJ100 was due to be back in service on 19 January 2018 and the remaining three in March. In August 2018, Russian regional carrier Yakutia Airlines considered withdrawing their SSJs, after two were grounded because their engines were removed after 1,500-3,000 cycles, below the 7,000 specified, and no replacements were available.
PowerJet was expanding its repair capacity and lease pool as engine maturity improved, noting that the SaM146 engine achieved 99.9% dependability since its 2011 introduction.

=== Productivity ===
In September 2018, Interjet was reported to be considering replacing its SSJ100s with Airbus A320neos, to make better use of its slots, with the SSJ technical problems possibly also a factor.
On 12 September, Interjet denied the report.
It was later reported that Interjet intends to phase out some of its Superjets and take 20 more A320neos, maybe alongside newer Superjet deliveries; it will have access to an enhanced SSJ spares inventory in Mexico City and is installing a flight simulator in Toluca.
The updated SSJs would have winglets, a higher MTOW and improved systems and interior.
Sukhoi has also proposed to increase the cabin density from 93 to 108 seats by reducing the pitch from .
While the airline was attracted by its low introductory price, Sukhoi was forced to reimburse Interjet in 2018 after its fleet of 30 suffered persistent faults.
In October 2018, Sukhoi and engine contractor UEC agreed on a plan, backed by the Russian government, to focus on customer support rather than deliveries in order to improve dispatch reliability.
At the end of November 2018, United Aircraft Corporation transferred from Sukhoi Holding to the Irkut Corporation, to become UAC&#x27;s airliner division. By then, Brussels Airlines was seeking alternatives for its four SSJ100s wet-leased from CityJet, as teething problems affected their reliability.
By February 2019, CityJet&#x27;s remaining five SSJ100s stood idle and were expected to be transferred to Slovenia&#x27;s Adria Airways, which committed for 15 in late 2018, though Adria subsequently cancelled its order in April 2019. Neither CityJet nor Brussels Airlines have commented as to why they dropped the SSJ, though low reliability, difficult maintenance and spare parts availability are suspected to have contributed.

By the end of the first quarter of 2019, 15 of Interjet&#x27;s 22 SSJs were out of service. Further talks with Sukhoi were deadlocked, with Interjet reportedly unwilling to pay for repairs to the PowerJet SaM146 engines. Interjet&#x27;s reliability issues are compounded by the lack of service facilities in the Americas for the SSJ, a factor which also contributed to the poor reliability recorded by CityJet.

On 15 May 2019, Interjet announced that it is to sell its 20 SSJs, of which only five are operational, as it is no longer profitable to operate aircraft of this size in Mexico. Therefore, , Sukhoi has had trouble selling the Superjet and renewing leasing contracts outside of Russia because of reliability and service network issues, resulting in an average of 109 flight hours per month for Russian airlines, approximately half the Embraer EMB 170 productivity, and just a third of a Boeing or Airbus jet. Unease with the SSJ&#x27;s low reliability also spread to Russian operators.

=== Slow sales ===
Sukhoi delivered only three SSJs in the first half of 2019; its financial results show a sevenfold drop in aircraft sales revenue and a fourfold drop in overall sales revenue, resulting in a 32% increase in its net loss. The company needs to achieve a production rate of 32 to 34 aircraft per year to make a profit, though demand for Russian models in the 60–120 seat category is forecast to be only 10 aircraft per year over a 20-year period. In the short-term, the company&#x27;s main hope is that Aeroflot will firm up its 2018 preliminary agreement for 100 SSJs.

Yamal Airlines, the second-largest Russian SSJ operator, announced the cancellation of its order for 10 further SSJs, citing high servicing costs. Of 30–40 SSJs owned by Aeroflot, only 10 are reportedly usable at a time due to maintenance problems. Aeroflot cancelled approximately 50 Superjet flights in the week following the Flight 1492 accident. &quot;Kommersant&quot; cited industry sources as saying the Superjet 100 had lower dispatch reliability than Airbus and Boeing aircraft in the airline&#x27;s fleet historically and attributed a rise in cancellations to &quot;increased safety measures&quot; at Aeroflot while the accident is investigated. On 4 June, the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya) ordered carriers to perform one-time inspections of the SSJ, including a general check of the aircraft&#x27;s condition and verification of aircraft and engine logs, by 25 June.
A total of 12 jets were delivered in 2020 to the following operators: Rossiya Airlines, Azimuth Airlines, Red Wings Airlines.
The sole remaining western operator, Interjet, down by the end of November 2020 to just four operational SSJ100s, quit flying in December 2020 and entered bankruptcy in April 2021. Part of Interjet’s plan was to try to return its 22 SSJ-100s to Sukhoi to cancel its debt, and resume flying with 10 Airbus A320 aircraft.
In December 2020, Rossiya Airlines announced that it intends to operate 66 Superjets by the end of 2021, transferred from its parent company Aeroflot which currently has 54 SJs. In September 2023, North Korea’s supreme leader Kim Jong Un visited a fighter aircraft production in Russia’s Far East, he also inspected civil aviation project, included the domestic made Superjet 100.

=== Impact of sanctions against Russia ===
Russian operators of the Superjet 100 encountered difficulties in keeping their fleets airborne as result of sanctions imposed following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In 2023, it emerged that there was a shortage of parts for the SaM146 engines, namely igniter plugs produced in the United States and French fuel filters for which no domestic replacement could be found. Rossiya Airlines expressed fears that only 40% of its Superjet 100 fleet would be active in the spring and summer of 2023 due to lack of parts.
In September 2022, UEC Saturn, producer of the SaM146, resorted to cleaning old filters as a method to extend the lifetime of the engines, though this procedure was banned by the Russian regulator due to lack of formal certification.

== Variants ==
Three variants were initially planned, seating 60, 78 and 98 passengers: the RRJ-60, RRJ-75 and RRJ-95, respectively. By 2007, the RRJ-60 had been dropped, to focus on the 98-seater, with the 78-seater to follow. The basic version was certified by the EASA on 3 February 2012, the RRJ-95LR100 with an MTOW increased from and the RRJ-95B100 with thrust increased from the SaM146-1S17 of -1S18s were added on 7 March 2017.
The RRJ-95LR100 range is increased to .
The RRJ-95B100 takeoff distance is reduced by 10%.

=== 130–140 seat stretch ===
In 2011, the Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade mentioned the stretched Superjet 130NG, seating 130.
It would have an aluminium fuselage and composite wings. The new materials were intended to reduce weight by 15-20%, increase service life by 20–30% and reduce operating costs by 10–12%.

In 2013, funding was planned to start in 2016 for production from 2019 to 2020. It would have used a derivative of the Irkut MC-21 composite wing and Pratt &amp; Whitney PW1000G engines. The 130-seat stretch would have been known as the Sukhoi Superjet 130NG. It would have competed with the Airbus A220 and Embraer E-Jet E2 family.

=== 115–120 seat stretch ===
In 2016, a shorter stretch seating up to 120, using larger wings but the same engines and tail, was planned for introduction in 2020.
In 2017, with a business plan for 150 aircraft, a go-ahead for the NG 130-seat stretch depended on the availability of engines with sufficient thrust and was due by the end of the year.
The aircraft could carry up to 120 passengers with the existing engines, and up to 125 passengers with airframe continuous improvements; PowerJet could certify a thrust increase of 2% within three years. Sukhoi was to decide by the first quarter of 2018 whether to launch first a shortened 75-seat or a stretched variant needing higher thrust SaM146s or an alternative engine.

=== 75 seat shrink ===
At the February 2018 Singapore Air Show, Sukhoi announced a possible 75-seat shrink, to enter service in 2022.
With a smaller, optimised aluminium or composite wing, it would be powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney PW1200Gs, detuned SaM146s or Aviadvigatel PD-14 derived PD-7s.
The shorter fuselage would be lighter and it would fall within US scope clauses, but would require Western service and support experience.

Demand for such jets is 200–300 in Russia and up to 3,000 overseas; introduction could slip to early 2023.
As Sukhoi and Irkut may be consolidated into United Aircraft, some structures and avionics could be closer to the Irkut MC-21 for commonality.
A unified platform with identical controls would ease pilot conversions; S7 Airlines committed to 75 aircraft.
In July 2018, a composite wing was preferred and a 3-metre test section will be manufactured and tested. The variant would retain the SaM146 and empty weight should be reduced by 12–15%.

In 2018, serial production was planned for 2025, four years after design approval. By 2019, the priority had shifted to the replacement of Western parts on the SSJ100 so that the aircraft can be sold to US-sanctioned countries such as Iran. S7 Airlines, which had committed to 75 of the shortened aircraft, may seek alternatives from Bombardier or Embraer. In September 2019, the owner of S7, Vladislav Filev, confirmed his understanding that the SSJ75 project had been abandoned. He explained that S7 had insisted on the participation of its own experts in the test programme, and had demanded the replacement of the composite floor that showed insufficient fire resistance in the Sheremetyevo crash, together with a redesign of the wheel wells.

== Orders and deliveries ==

By August 2016, 133 SSJ100s were in operation with eight airlines and five governmental and business aviation organizations.
In October 2017, there were 105 SSJ100s in service worldwide: some used by government bodies such as the Royal Thai Air Force and Kazakh government agencies.
The fleet had logged 230,000 flights in 340,000 hours since its commercial operations debuted in 2011.
At least 30 SSJ100s were to be delivered in 2017, with 38 planned for 2018 and 37 for 2019. In May 2018, ten years after its first flight, the fleet of 127 have logged over 275,000 commercial flights and 420,000 hours. In September 2018, it had logged over 300,000 revenue flights lasting 460,000 hours. As of April 2023, there were approx. 160 Superjet aircraft in service.

== Accidents and incidents ==

As of July 2024, there have been four hull loss accidents, three of which resulted in a total of 89 fatalities.
* On 9 May 2012, a demonstration flight directly struck Mount Salak in Indonesia, killing all 45 on board (Sukhoi personnel and representatives of various local airlines). The Terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS) alert was ignored by the pilot, distracted by a conversation with a potential customer.
* On 21 July 2013, during autoland evaluation of an RRJ-95B (Russian experimental registry) with a single engine in a crosswind at Keflavík Airport in Iceland, the fuselage hit and slid down the runway with the gear up. During an intended go-around, the fatigued pilot throttled down the wrong engine, causing the aircraft to lose thrust sufficient for controlled flight. The plane continued to lose altitude and hit the runway even as the pilot realized his mistake and throttled up the engine. One of the five crew was injured during evacuation. The Icelandic Aircraft Accident Investigation Board investigated the event and issued nine recommendations. The aircraft was subsequently repaired and returned to service as part of the test fleet.
* On 10 October 2018, a Yakutia Airlines SSJ100 slid off the runway at Yakutsk Airport as the main landing gear collapsed. All 87 passengers and five crew were safely evacuated and none were seriously injured. The excursion may have been caused by ice on the runway or the airstrip&#x27;s poor state of repair. The airliner was damaged beyond repair and was expected to be written off.
* On 5 May 2019, as Aeroflot Flight 1492 was climbing after takeoff from Moscow Sheremetyevo, at lightning discharged close to the aircraft from a nearby cumulonimbus cloud with a base. The radio and other equipment failed, and the flight crew chose to make an emergency landing at Sheremetyevo. The aircraft bounced several times after an initial touchdown, and after the fourth hard touchdown a fire erupted and engulfed the rear of the aircraft. An emergency evacuation was then carried out but 41 out of 78 occupants died.
* On 12 July 2024, a Gazpromavia SSJ100 crashed near Kolomna during a test flight after repairs, killing the crew of three.
* On 24 November 2024, an Azimuth SSJ100 from Sochi caught fire after landing at Antalya. All passengers were evacuated and there were no casualties.

<text>A social skill is any competence facilitating interaction and communication with others where social rules and relations are created, communicated, and changed in verbal and nonverbal ways. The process of learning these skills is called socialization. Lack of such skills can cause &quot;social awkwardness&quot;.

Interpersonal skills are actions used to effectively interact with others. Interpersonal skills relate to categories of dominance vs. submission, love vs. hate, affiliation vs. aggression, and control vs. autonomy (Leary, 1957). Positive interpersonal skills include entertainment, persuasion, active listening, showing care, delegation, hospitality and stewardship, among others. Social psychology, an academic discipline focused on research relating to social functioning, studies how interpersonal skills are learned through societal-based changes in attitude, thinking, and behavior.

==Enumeration and categorization==
Social skills are the tools that enable people to communicate, learn, ask for help, get needs met in appropriate ways, get along with others, make friends, develop healthy relationships, protect themselves, and in general, be able to interact with the society harmoniously. Social skills build essential character traits like trustworthiness, respectfulness, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. These traits help build an internal moral compass, allowing individuals to make good choices in thinking and behavior, resulting in social competence.
The important social skills identified by the Employment and Training Administration are:
* Coordination – Adjusting actions in relation to others&#x27; actions.
* Mentoring – Teaching and helping others learn how to do something (e.g. being a study partner).
* Negotiation – Discussion aimed at reaching an agreement. 
* Persuasion – The action or fact of persuading someone or of being persuaded to do or believe something. 
* Service orientation – Actively looking for ways to evolve compassionately and grow psycho-socially with people.
* Social perceptiveness – Being aware of others&#x27; reactions and able to respond in an understanding manner.

Social skills are goal oriented with both main goals and sub-goals. For example, a workplace interaction initiated by a new employee with a senior employee will first contain a main goal. This will be to gather information, and then the sub-goal will be to establish a rapport in order to obtain the main goal. Takeo Doi in his study of consciousness distinguished this as &quot;tatemae&quot;, meaning conventions and verbal expressions and &quot;honne&quot;, meaning true motive behind the conventions.

==Causes of deficits==
Deficits in social skills were categorized by Gresham in 1998, as failure to recognize and reflect social skills, a failure to model appropriate models, and failure to perform acceptable behavior in particular situations in relation to developmental and transitional stages. Social skill deficits are also a discouragement for children with behavioral challenges when it comes to adult adjustment.

===Alcohol misuse===
Social skills are often significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism. This is due to the neurotoxic long-term effects of alcohol misuse on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The social skills that are typically impaired by alcohol abuse, include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems, and theory of mind deficits. The ability to understand humor is also often impaired in alcohol abusers. Impairments in social skills can also occur in individuals who have fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. These deficits persist throughout the affected people&#x27;s lives, and may worsen over time due to the effects of aging on the brain.

===ADHD and hyperkinetic disorder===
People with ADHD and hyperkinetic disorder often have difficulties with social skills, such as social interaction. Approximately half of children and adolescents with ADHD will experience peer rejection, compared to 10–15 percent of non-ADHD youth. Adolescents with ADHD are less likely to develop close friendships and romantic relationships; they are usually regarded by their peers as immature or as social outcasts, with an exception for peers that have ADHD or related conditions themselves, or a high level of tolerance for such symptoms. As they begin to mature, however, it becomes easier to make such relationships. Training in social skills, behavioral modification, and medication have some beneficial effects. It is important for youth with ADHD to form friendships with people who are not involved in deviant or delinquent activities, people who do not have significant mental illnesses or developmental disabilities, in order to reduce emergence of later psychopathology. Poor peer relationships can contribute to major depression, criminality, school failure, and substance use disorders.

===Autistic spectrum disorders ===
Individuals with autistic spectrum disorders including autism and Asperger syndrome are often characterized by their deficiency in social functioning. The concept of social skills has been questioned in terms of the autistic spectrum. In response to the needs of autistic children, Romanczyk has suggested adapting a comprehensive model of social acquisitions with behavioral modification rather than specific responses tailored for social contexts.

===Anxiety and depression===
Individuals with few opportunities to socialize with others often struggle with social skills. This can often create a downward spiral effect for people with mental illnesses like anxiety or depression. Due to anxiety experienced from concerns with interpersonal evaluation and fear of negative reaction by others, surfeit expectations of failure or social rejection in socialization leads to avoiding or shutting down from social interactions. Individuals who experience significant levels of social anxiety often struggle when communicating with others, and may have impaired abilities to demonstrate social cues and behaviors appropriately.

The use of social media can also cause anxiety and depression. The Internet is causing many problems, according to a study with a sample size of 3,560 students. Problematic internet use may be present in about 4% of high school students in the United States, it may be associated with depression. About one fourth of respondents (28.51%) reported spending fifteen or more hours per week on the internet. Although other studies show positive effects from internet use.

Depression can also cause people to avoid opportunities to socialize, which impairs their social skills, and makes socialization unattractive.

=== Anti-social behaviors ===
The authors of the book &quot;Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work&quot; explore psychopathy in workplace. The FBI consultants describe a five phase model of how a typical psychopath climbs to and maintains power. Many traits exhibited by these individuals include: superficial charm, insincerity, egocentricity, manipulativeness, grandiosity, lack of empathy, low agreeableness, exploitativeness, independence, rigidity, stubbornness and dictatorial tendencies. Babiak and Hare say for corporate psychopaths, success is defined as the best revenge and their problem behaviors are repeated &quot;ad infinitum&quot; due to little insight and their proto-emotions such as &quot;anger, frustration, and rage&quot; are refracted as irresistible charm. The authors note that lack of emotional literacy and moral conscience is often confused with toughness, the &quot;ability&quot; to make hard decisions, and &quot;effective&quot; crisis management. Babiak and Hare also emphasizes a reality they identified with psychopaths from studies that psychopaths are not able to be influenced by any sort of therapy.

At the University at Buffalo in New York, Emily Grijalva has investigated narcissism in business; she found there are two forms of narcissism: &quot;vulnerable&quot; and &quot;grandiose&quot;. It is her finding that &quot;moderate&quot; level of grandiose narcissism is linked to becoming an effective manager. Grandiose narcissists are characterized as confident; they possess unshakable belief that they are superior, even when it is unwarranted. They can be charming, pompous show-offs, and can also be selfish, exploitative and entitled. Jens Lange and Jan Crusius at the University of Cologne, Germany associates &quot;malicious-benign&quot; envy within narcissistic social climbers in workplace. It is their finding that grandiose narcissists are less prone to low self-esteem and neuroticism and are less susceptible to the anxiety and depression that can affect vulnerable narcissists when coupled with envy. They characterize vulnerable narcissists as those who &quot;believe they are special, and want to be seen that way–but are just not that competent, or charming.&quot; As a result, their self-esteem fluctuates a lot. They tend to be self-conscious and passive, but also prone to outbursts of potentially violent aggression if their inflated self-image is threatened.&quot; Richard Boyatzis says this is an unproductive form of expression of emotions that the person cannot share constructively, which reflects lack of appropriate skills. Eddie Brummelman, a social and behavioral scientist at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands and Brad Bushman at Ohio State University in Columbus says studies show that in western culture narcissism is on the rise from shifting focus on the self rather than on relationships and concludes all narcissism to be socially undesirable (&quot;unhealthy feelings of superiority&quot;). David Kealy at the University of British Columbia in Canada states that narcissism might aid temporarily but in the long run it is better to be true to oneself, have personal integrity, and be kind to others.

==Behavioral therapy==

Behaviorism interprets social skills as learned behaviors that function to facilitate social reinforcement. According to Schneider &amp; Byrne (1985), operant conditioning procedures for training social skills had the largest effect size, followed by modeling, coaching, and social cognitive techniques. Behavior analysts prefer to use the term behavioral skills to social skills. Behavioral skills training to build social and other skills is used with a variety of populations including in packages to treat addictions as in the community reinforcement approach and family training (CRAFT).

Behavioral skills training is also used for people with borderline personality disorder,
depression, and developmental disabilities. Typically, behaviorists try to develop what are considered cusp skills, which are critical skills to open access to a variety of environments. The rationale for this type of approach to treatment is that people meet a variety of social problems and can reduce the stress and punishment from the encounter in a safe environment. It also addresses how they can increase reinforcement by having the correct skills.

<doc id="865679" wikidata="Q3398862" url="?curid=865679" title="Cup holder">
<text>A cup holder is a device, such as a podstakannik (Russian) or zarf (Turkish), to hold a cup or other drinking vessel. It may be free standing to hold cups securely on a desk or other flat surface, or in a tree style to store sets of cups in kitchens. They may be built into automobiles or chairs, or fixed to the walls of airplanes, boats, buses and trains.

== Automobile cup holder ==

The development of the drive-in restaurant was a step in the cup holder&#x27;s development. Servers would attach a tray that hooked over the car&#x27;s side window, which needed to be left up a little for it to attach to. This gave a temporary table to hold drinks and food while eating in the car. The drive-in restaurant and cinema encouraged the development of built-in tray tables; often, the inside of the glove compartment lid, when folded down, had indentations to hold cups, cans as well as pistachio shells and were found in cars as early as the 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air. These were sufficient to hold beverages when the car was stopped, but not while in motion.

The later development of the drive-through restaurant encouraged the development of better holders for drinks, and a more fast-paced life and longer commute times made many drivers desire to drink their morning coffee in the car on the way to work. The 1960s saw coffee cups with wide, flat, rubberised bases being sold, which would keep them steady on the dash or console. A little later, aftermarket cup holders began to be sold. These often clipped onto the door windows, although other designs wedge in between the front seats and the center console.

Built-in cup holders began to be available in the 1920s. Minivans were pioneers in their availability, and they still offer the greatest number of them. Over time, automotive cup holders have become larger and more sophisticated, so that they can hold a variety of different cup sizes securely. Many offer spring-loaded holders that clasp the cup securely, no matter how large or small. The development of ever-larger cups by fast-food chains and convenience stores in the US and Canada has proven a challenge to automotive designers; many fast-food chains now offer 44 fl.oz. (1.3 L) drinks. The automobile cup-holder has also driven the development of &quot;car cups&quot; designed to fit within most cars&#x27; cup holders; these have a narrower base but flare outward after a short cylindrical distance. The installation of cup holders in automobiles increased significantly after &quot;Stella Liebeck v. McDonald&#x27;s Corporation&quot;, in which a 79-year-old woman in Albuquerque, New Mexico ordered hot coffee from a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant and, when it spilled, was scalded so severely she required skin grafts.

==Desktop cup holder==

Earlier wood versions of cup holders for tops of desks have been around decades such as one featured in a U.S. Airline catalog in the late 1980s. Cup holders for edges of desks and tables really picked up steam in the U.S. around 2006 regarding the GW Bush administration. Specifically, the CDC Department. Cup holders for such a use weren&#x27;t for sale on the internet in the U.S. during most or all of 2005 and possibly not prior. The 1st appearance 2005 to 2006 was by Antro Technology with a cup holder for the edge of a construction table. The 2nd was a South Korean export with a clip for an indoor table. People sometimes drink beverages at their tables and work desks. It is very easy to knock over a cup or mug full of hot tea or coffee and this can then damage expensive laptops or keyboards. Also the hot liquid may cause injury to people or damage to books or carpets.

On a table or work desk, coffee cups can be knocked over by the person sitting and working at the desk by their arms or hands. This can happen very easily if they are disturbed e.g. by a telephone call or by a sudden impulse move. Coffee cups on desks can also be knocked over by pets such as dogs or cats who may jump up on to the desk. Coffee or tea can also spill out of a cup if the table is knocked by a person walking by.

Several devices were patented to hold coffee cups. The main problem in the endeavor is to provide a mechanism to hold the handle of the cup which usually protrudes a few centimeters from the side of the mug. Another problem facing the inventors is the varying sizes of coffee cups.
Some devices which were patented are as follows.

* US patent number 5984136 1999. This cup holder has slots to hold the handle and relies on an extended base to hold the cup upright.
* US patent number 6039206 2000. This cup holder features legs which extend when the cup is placed into the holder.
* US patent number D645,308 2011. This cup holder for a surface solves a lot of previous problems. It was shown shortly before being granted on U.S. television however it has not been sold.
In Japan several patents were applied for, but they were not finalized. They have since been commercialized by other manufacturers. These are:

* Number 2006314739.
* Number 2995040642. This cup holder has slots to accommodate the cups handle and has a suction cup to attach the holder to a smooth flat surface, so that it is held securely.

New Zealand patent number 565067. This is a completely free-standing desktop coffee cup holder that can sit on any flat surface this was invented by Digby Green, George Green and Aly Matthews. It can be manufactured in several materials, e.g. wood, metal or plastic. It has been manufactured in plastic by Adovationz Ltd in New Zealand under the brand name of Adkaf.

Dorian Gibbs of Los Angeles, California had the earliest workable cup holder that attaches to a flat edge in the U.S. with US 5,842,671 granted Dec. 1, 1998. 
US 6,929,229 was granted on Aug. 16, 2005 to Chris D. Palmby of Bellingham, Washington. Perry Segretto of Elmhurst, Illinois had a similar cup holder pending like Palmby&#x27;s in the U.S. around the same time. Segretto and Michael Koczor sold a cup holder called Drink Hold&#x27;em featured on HGTV&#x27;s &quot;I want that.&quot; Antro Technology sold one similar briefly. A South Korean company exported a clip type cup holder to the U.S. No lawsuits were involved to slow the product though mail was received. An agenda regarding jobs with a patent trolls interest occurred during the time of the Obama administration.

A wide variety of cup holders that attach to cylinders were produced in the late 2000s and early 2010s.

==The bus/train/boat cup holder==

Before the automobile cup holders, many buses and trains were built with wall-mounted cup holders. These cup holders are usually constructed by thin stainless steel plates. Some of them are covered by rubber. There are now many cup holders available which can be screwed to the walls of boats and buses and recreational vehicles.

Another popular cup holder for boats is the &quot;drop in&quot; cup holder. This is a round plastic item, that has a lip at the top. It requires that a hole is drilled into the boat&#x27;s table or console and then the unit is inserted and the lip holds it in place. These do not accommodate cups with handles.

==Cinema cup holder==
AMC Theatres patented cup holder armrests in 1981.

==The cup holder tree==

These are devices which hold several mugs usually in a kitchen or dining room. People often buy sets of mugs for use in a family or guest situation and they need a place to store them ready for use. These cup holder trees are available in two types. The first type has a base with a vertical mast from which there are hooks to hold each cup or of an &quot;accordion&quot; arm where pegs are placed at each junction of a pivot point. The second type is screwed or mounted underneath shelves or in kitchen cupboards etc..

<text>Royal Air Force Barkston Heath or RAF Barkston Heath is a Royal Air Force Relief Landing Ground under the command of RAF Cranwell near Grantham, Lincolnshire, England.

RAF Barkston Heath is the home of 57 Sqn&#x27;s B Flight of No. 3 Flying Training School RAF (3 FTS). For a period between approximately 1995 and 2010, it operated the Slingsby T67M260 Firefly, followed by the Grob Tutor T.1 operated between 2010 and 2018.

No. 3 FTS currently provide elementary flying training for RAF and Royal Navy students on the Grob Prefect T.1. A secondary role of RAF Barkston Heath is as a Relief Landing Ground for the flying training activities at RAF Cranwell.

== History ==
Barkston Heath was constructed in 1936 and was initially used as a satellite station for RAF Cranwell.

===United States Army Air Forces use===

In late 1943, Barkston Heath was made available to the United States Army Air Force&#x27;s Ninth Air Force. It was earmarked for basing troop carrier units scheduled to be transferred from Sicily to participate in the forthcoming cross-Channel invasion, Operation Overlord. During its time as a USAAF airfield, Barkston Heath was designated as USAAF station 483.

==== 61st Troop Carrier Group ====
The first US personnel arrived on 13 February from Sciacca, Sicily, and most of their Douglas C-47 Skytrains on the 17th and 18th, although not all aircraft were in place until a month later. These new occupants were the 61st Troop Carrier Group.

The 61st TCG was part of the 52nd Troop Carrier Wing, IX Troop Carrier Command. The headquarters of the 61st Troop Carrier Group moved to an Advanced Landing Ground (ALG) at Abbeville (ALG B-92), France, on 13 March 1945, but its squadrons went to RAF Chipping Ongar from where they participated in Operation Varsity on 24 March carrying British paratroops who dropped near Wesel.

==== 349th Troop Carrier Group ====
An increased demand for theatre air transport brought the 349th TCG from Baer Field, Indiana in late March 1945, with its Curtiss C-46 Commando transports. Group headquarters was established at Barkston on 30 March, but the group only remained three weeks before moving to Rove/Amy, France, on 18 April.

===Royal Air Force use===
The USAAF returned control of the airfield to the Air Ministry in June 1945 when the war in Europe ended. From 1983 to 1989 Barkston was home to &#x27;A&#x27; Flight 25 Squadron (with Bristol Bloodhound surface-to-air missiles) when they returned from RAF Bruggen in Germany.

==== Elementary Flying Training ====

On 1 April 1995, the Joint Elementary Flying Training School (JEFTS), which provided training to RAF and Fleet Air Arm (FAA) pilots, relocated to Barkston Heath from RAF Topcliffe in North Yorkshire. The school was equipped with eighteen civilian registered Slingsby T67M Firefly trainer aircraft.

In 1996 the Army Air Corps (AAC) joined JEFTS and the school operated as a tri-service organisation until 2003 when the RAF decided to instead provide elementary flying training through its network of University Air Squadrons. JEFTS as a result was renamed the Defence Elementary Flying Training School in July 2003, with the FAA element re-establishing itself as 703 Naval Air Squadron (703 NAS) and the AAC element as No. 674 Squadron.

In November 2009 the Fireflies were retired and replaced with the Grob Tutor T.1.
674 Squadron AAC operated the Slingsby Firefly in the 1990s through to around 2007, the Grob 115 Tutor from around 2007 until acquisition of the Prefect T1 turboprop trainer in the late 2010s. Students from all three Services of the Armed Forces were trained during this time as well as a limited number of students from overseas, mainly from certain Gulf States. Training was delivered as part of the UK Military Flying Training System (UKMFTS) contract.
The Squadron was temporarily stood down in April 2021 before reforming at Middle Wallop Flying Station and a transition to the flying grading role.

====Heraldry====
The squadron motto &#x27;Nothing Is Impossible&#x27; was selected by the Regimental Committee of the Army Air Corps in order to perpetuate the memory of the Glider Pilot Regiment which bore the same motto.

The squadron crest bears the Sphinx of the Royal Lincolnshire Regiment, chosen because of the squadron&#x27;s initial location at Barkston Heath in Lincolnshire and the close association of the Chief of the Defence Staff with the Army Air Corps (he was the Regimental Colonel) and the Royal Anglian Regiment, the successor to the Royal Lincolnshire Regiment.

===Other units===
The following units were also here at some point:

*No. 1 Elementary Flying Training School RAF
*No. 2 Central Flying School RAF
*No. 2 Flying Instructors School RAF
*No. 3 (Coastal) Operational Training Unit RAF
*No. 7 Equipment Disposal Depot RAF
*No. 85 Squadron RAF
*RAF College
*RAF College Flying Training School RAF
*RAF College Service Flying Training School RAF

== Infrastructure and facilities ==

The RAF Barkston Heath site extends to . It has three runways, 06/24 which is long, 10/28 which is long and 18/36 which is long, all constructed from asphalt.

The airfield has limited facilities and relies on its parent station RAF Cranwell for support. The main building at Barkston Heath is the Operational Support Building which was re-opened in January 2018 after refurbishment as part of the UK Military Flying Training System (UKMFTS) programme. It was renamed the Esmonde Building in memory of Lieutenant Commander Eugene Esmonde, a distinguished Fleet Air Arm pilot who was a posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross.

Out of six T2 type hangar and one B1 type constructed during the Second World War, only two T2 type remain on the site.

The airfield contains the decaying remains of an English Electric Canberra at the northern edge of the airfield site.

== Role and operations ==
=== Defence Elementary Flying Training School ===

RAF Barkston Heath is home to the Defence Elementary Flying Training School, comprising 57 Squadron RAF, operating the Grob Prefect T1 in the elementary flying training role. Aircraft and support are provided by a civilian contractor, Ascent Flight Training, as part of the UK Military Flying Training System contract. Ascent also provides a significant proportion of the instructional staff, the Air Traffic Control service is provided by NATS Solutions Ltd, Affinity provide engineering personnel and other Station support personnel are provided by NBC and the MoD.

Although the school trains Fleet Air Arm crews, it is under the command of the RAF&#x27;s No. 3 Flying Training School, based at nearby RAF Cranwell.

==== 703 Naval Air Squadron ====
703 NAS trains Fleet Air Arm pilots destined to fly both rotary (AgustaWestland Merlin and AgustaWestland Wildcat) and fixed wing aircraft (Lockheed Martin F-35B II Lightning and BAE Hawk). Helicopter students graduate to No. 1 Flying Training School (1 FTS) at RAF Shawbury in Shropshire, whereas fast jet students move onto No. 4 Flying Training School at RAF Valley in Anglesey.

=== Relief Landing Ground ===
Barkston Heath acts as a Relief Landing Ground for the flying training activities at RAF Cranwell, which is four minutes flying time away.

==Based units==
The following flying units are based at RAF Barkston Heath. The station is also regularly used as relief landing ground by aircraft based at nearby RAF Cranwell.

=== Royal Air Force ===
No. 22 Group (Training) RAF

*No. 3 Flying Training School / Defence Elementary Flying Training School
**No. 57 Squadron – Grob Prefect T.1

<doc id="865686" wikidata="Q1666284" url="?curid=865686" title="Internal set theory">
<text>Internal set theory (IST) is a mathematical theory of sets developed by Edward Nelson that provides an axiomatic basis for a portion of the nonstandard analysis introduced by Abraham Robinson. Instead of adding new elements to the real numbers, Nelson&#x27;s approach modifies the axiomatic foundations through syntactic enrichment. Thus, the axioms introduce a new term, &quot;standard&quot;, which can be used to make discriminations not possible under the conventional ZFC axioms for sets. Thus, IST is an enrichment of ZFC: all axioms of ZFC are satisfied for all classical predicates, while the new unary predicate &quot;standard&quot; satisfies three additional axioms I, S, and T. In particular, suitable nonstandard elements within the set of real numbers can be shown to have properties that correspond to the properties of infinitesimal and unlimited elements.

Nelson&#x27;s formulation is made more accessible for the lay-mathematician by leaving out many of the complexities of meta-mathematical logic that were initially required to justify rigorously the consistency of number systems containing infinitesimal elements.

==Intuitive justification==
Whilst IST has a perfectly formal axiomatic scheme, described below, an intuitive justification of the meaning of the term &quot;standard&quot; is desirable. This is not part of the formal theory, but is a pedagogical device that might help the student interpret the formalism. The essential distinction, similar to the concept of definable numbers, contrasts the finiteness of the domain of concepts that we can specify and discuss, with the unbounded infinity of the set of numbers; compare finitism.
* The number of symbols one writes with is finite.
* The number of mathematical symbols on any given page is finite.
* The number of pages of mathematics a single mathematician can produce in a lifetime is finite.
* Any workable mathematical definition is necessarily finite.
* There are only a finite number of distinct objects a mathematician can define in a lifetime.
* There will only be a finite number of mathematicians in the course of our (presumably finite) civilization.
* Hence there is only a finite set of whole numbers our civilization can discuss in its allotted lifespan.
* What that limit actually is, is unknowable to us, being contingent on many accidental cultural factors.
* This limitation is not in itself susceptible to mathematical scrutiny, but that there is such a limit, whilst the set of whole numbers continues forever without bound, is a mathematical truth.

The term &quot;standard&quot; is therefore intuitively taken to correspond to some necessarily finite portion of &quot;accessible&quot; whole numbers. The argument can be applied to any infinite set of objects whatsoever – there are only so many elements that one can specify in finite time using a finite set of symbols and there are always those that lie beyond the limits of our patience and endurance, no matter how we persevere. We must admit to a profusion of &quot;nonstandard&quot; elements—too large or too anonymous to grasp—within any infinite set.

===Principles of the &quot;standard&quot; predicate===

The following principles follow from the above intuitive motivation and so should be deducible from the formal axioms. For the moment we take the domain of discussion as being the familiar set of whole numbers.
* Any mathematical expression that does not use the new predicate &quot;standard&quot; explicitly or implicitly is an &quot;internal formula&quot;.
* Any definition that does so is an &quot;external formula&quot;.
* Any number &quot;uniquely&quot; specified by an internal formula is standard (by definition).
* Nonstandard numbers are precisely those that cannot be uniquely specified (due to limitations of time and space) by an internal formula.
* Nonstandard numbers are elusive: each one is too enormous to be manageable in decimal notation or any other representation, explicit or implicit, no matter how ingenious your notation. Whatever you succeed in producing is by definition merely another standard number.
* Nevertheless, there are (many) nonstandard whole numbers in any infinite subset of N.
* Nonstandard numbers are completely ordinary numbers, having decimal representations, prime factorizations, etc. Every classical theorem that applies to the natural numbers applies to the nonstandard natural numbers. We have created, not new numbers, but a new method of discriminating between existing numbers.
* Moreover, any classical theorem that is true for all standard numbers is necessarily true for all natural numbers. Otherwise the formulation &quot;the smallest number that fails to satisfy the theorem&quot; would be an internal formula that uniquely defined a nonstandard number.
* The predicate &quot;nonstandard&quot; is a logically consistent method for distinguishing &quot;large&quot; numbers—the usual term will be &quot;illimited&quot;. Reciprocals of these illimited numbers will necessarily be extremely small real numbers—&quot;infinitesimals&quot;. To avoid confusion with other interpretations of these words, in newer articles on IST those words are replaced with the constructs &quot;i-large&quot; and &quot;i-small&quot;.
* There are necessarily only finitely many standard numbers—but caution is required: we cannot gather them together and hold that the result is a well-defined mathematical set. This will not be supported by the formalism (the intuitive justification being that the precise bounds of this set vary with time and history). In particular we will not be able to talk about the largest standard number, or the smallest nonstandard number. It will be valid to talk about some finite set that contains all standard numbers—but this non-classical formulation could only apply to a nonstandard set.

== Formal axioms ==
IST is an axiomatic theory in the first-order logic with equality in a language containing a binary predicate symbol ∈ and a unary predicate symbol st(&quot;x&quot;). Formulas not involving st (i.e., formulas of the usual language of set theory) are called internal, other formulas are called external. We use the abbreviations
:formula_1
IST includes all axioms of the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC). Note that the ZFC schemata of separation and replacement are &quot;not&quot; extended to the new language, they can only be used with internal formulas. Moreover, IST includes three new axiom schemata – conveniently one for each initial in its name: Idealisation, Standardisation, and Transfer.

=== Idealisation ===
*For any internal formula formula_2 without a free occurrence of &quot;z&quot;, the universal closure of the following formula is an axiom:
*:formula_3
*In words: For every internal relation &quot;R&quot;, and for arbitrary values for all other free variables, we have that if for each standard, finite set &quot;F&quot;, there exists a &quot;g&quot; such that &quot;R&quot;(&quot;g&quot;, &quot;f&quot;) holds for all &quot;f&quot; in &quot;F&quot;, then there is a particular &quot;G&quot; such that for &quot;any standard&quot; &quot;f&quot; we have &quot;R&quot;(&quot;G&quot;, &quot;f&quot;), and conversely, if there exists &quot;G&quot; such that for any standard &quot;f&quot;, we have &quot;R&quot;(&quot;G&quot;, &quot;f&quot;), then for each finite set &quot;F&quot;, there exists a &quot;g&quot; such that &quot;R&quot;(&quot;g&quot;, &quot;f&quot;) holds for all &quot;f&quot; in &quot;F&quot;.

The statement of this axiom comprises two implications. The right-to-left implication can be reformulated by the simple statement that elements of standard finite sets are standard. The more important left-to-right implication expresses that the collection of all standard sets is contained in a finite (nonstandard) set, and moreover, this finite set can be taken to satisfy any given internal property shared by all standard finite sets.

This very general axiom scheme upholds the existence of &quot;ideal&quot; elements in appropriate circumstances. Three particular applications demonstrate important consequences.

==== Applied to the relation ≠ ====
If &quot;S&quot; is standard and finite, we take for the relation &quot;R&quot;(&quot;g&quot;, &quot;f&quot;): &quot;g&quot; and &quot;f&quot; are not equal and &quot;g&quot; is in &quot;S&quot;. Since &quot;&quot;For every standard finite set F there is an element g in S such that for all f in F&quot; is false (no such &quot;g&quot; exists when ), we may use Idealisation to tell us that &quot;There is a G in S such that for all standard f&quot; is also false, i.e. all the elements of &quot;S&quot; are standard.

If &quot;S&quot; is infinite, then we take for the relation &quot;R&quot;(&quot;g&quot;, &quot;f&quot;): &quot;g&quot; and &quot;f&quot; are not equal and &quot;g&quot; is in &quot;S&quot;. Since &quot;For every standard finite set F there is an element g in S such that for all f in F&quot; (the infinite set &quot;S&quot; is not a subset of the finite set &quot;F&quot;), we may use Idealisation to derive &quot;There is a G in S such that for all standard f&quot;.&quot; In other words, every infinite set contains a nonstandard element (many, in fact).

The power set of a standard finite set is standard (by Transfer) and finite, so all the subsets of a standard finite set are standard.

If &quot;S&quot; is nonstandard, we take for the relation &quot;R&quot;(&quot;g&quot;, &quot;f&quot;): &quot;g&quot; and &quot;f&quot; are not equal and &quot;g&quot; is in &quot;S&quot;. Since &quot;&quot;For every standard finite set F there is an element g in S such that for all f in F&quot; (the nonstandard set &quot;S&quot; is not a subset of the standard and finite set &quot;F&quot;), we may use Idealisation to derive &quot;There is a G in S such that for all standard f.&quot; In other words, every nonstandard set contains a nonstandard element.

As a consequence of all these results, all the elements of a set &quot;S&quot; are standard if and only if &quot;S&quot; is standard and finite.

==== Applied to the relation &lt; ====
Since &quot;For every standard, finite set of natural numbers F there is a natural number g such that for all f in F&quot; (say, ), we may use Idealisation to derive &quot;There is a natural number G such that for all standard natural numbers f&quot;.&quot; In other words, there exists a natural number greater than each standard natural number.

==== Applied to the relation ∈ ====
We take &quot;R&quot;(&quot;g&quot;, &quot;f&quot;): &quot;g&quot; is a finite set containing element &quot;f&quot;. Since &quot;&quot;For every standard, finite set F, there is a finite set g such that for all f in F&quot; (e.g. ), we may use Idealisation to derive &quot;There is a finite set G such that for all standard f&quot;.&quot; For any set &quot;S&quot;, the intersection of &quot;S&quot; with the set &quot;G&quot; is a finite subset of &quot;S&quot; that contains every standard element of &quot;S&quot;. &quot;G&quot; is necessarily nonstandard, by the ZFC regularity axiom.

=== Standardisation ===
*If formula_2 is any formula (it may be external) without a free occurrence of &quot;y&quot;, the universal closure of
*:formula_5
:is an axiom.
*In words: If &quot;A&quot; is a standard set and P any property, internal or otherwise, then there is a unique, standard subset &quot;B&quot; of &quot;A&quot; whose standard elements are precisely the standard elements of &quot;A&quot; satisfying &quot;P&quot; (but the behaviour of &quot;B&quot;&#x27;s nonstandard elements is not prescribed).

=== Transfer ===
*If formula_6 is an internal formula with no other free variables than those indicated, then
*:formula_7
:is an axiom.
*In words: If all the parameters &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, ..., &quot;W&quot; of an internal formula &quot;F&quot; have standard values then holds for all &quot;x&quot;″s as soon as it holds for all standard &quot;x&quot;″s—from which it follows that all uniquely defined concepts or objects within classical mathematics are standard.

==Formal justification for the axioms==
Aside from the intuitive motivations suggested above, it is necessary to justify that additional IST axioms do not lead to errors or inconsistencies in reasoning. Mistakes and philosophical weaknesses in reasoning about infinitesimal numbers in the work of Gottfried Leibniz, Johann Bernoulli, Leonhard Euler, Augustin-Louis Cauchy, and others were the reason that they were originally abandoned for the more cumbersome real number-based arguments developed by Georg Cantor, Richard Dedekind, and Karl Weierstrass, which were perceived as being more rigorous by Weierstrass&#x27;s followers.

The approach for internal set theory is the same as that for any new axiomatic system—we construct a model for the new axioms using the elements of a simpler, more trusted, axiom scheme. This is quite similar to justifying the consistency of the axioms of elliptic non-Euclidean geometry by noting they can be modeled by an appropriate interpretation of great circles on a sphere in ordinary 3-space.

In fact via a suitable model a proof can be given of the relative consistency of IST as compared with ZFC: if ZFC is consistent, then IST is consistent. In fact, a stronger statement can be made: IST is a conservative extension of ZFC: any internal formula that can be proven within internal set theory can be proven in the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms with the axiom of choice alone.

<doc id="865689" wikidata="Q7450018" url="?curid=865689" title="Senate Report on Iraqi WMD Intelligence">
<text>The Senate Report on Iraqi WMD Intelligence (formally, the Report of the Select Committee on Intelligence on the U.S. Intelligence Community&#x27;s Prewar Intelligence Assessments on Iraq) was the report by the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence concerning the U.S. intelligence community&#x27;s assessments of Iraq during the time leading up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The report, which was released on July 9, 2004, identified numerous failures in the intelligence-gathering and -analysis process. The report found that these failures led to the creation of inaccurate materials that misled both government policy makers and the American public.

The Committee&#x27;s nine Republicans and eight Democrats agreed on the report&#x27;s major conclusions and unanimously endorsed its findings. They disagreed, though, on the impact that statements on Iraq by senior members of the Bush administration had on the intelligence process. The second phase of the investigation, addressing the way senior policymakers used the intelligence, was published on May 25, 2007. Portions of the phase II report not released at that time include the review of public statements by U.S. government leaders prior to the war, and the assessment of the activities of Douglas Feith and the Pentagon&#x27;s Office of Special Plans.

== Background ==
After the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq agreed to destroy its stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and dismantle its WMD programs. To verify compliance, UN inspection teams were to be given free access to the country. Over the next seven years, inspectors sometimes complained about non-cooperation and evasiveness by the Iraqi government. Iraqi officials in turn complained that some weapons inspectors were acting as spies for foreign intelligence agencies. In 1998, after a critical report on the Iraqi government&#x27;s noncompliance was issued by UN weapons inspector Richard Butler, U.S. President Bill Clinton announced that he would launch airstrikes on Iraqi targets (see Operation Desert Fox). Butler evacuated his inspectors and the bombing proceeded. After the bombing campaign, Iraq refused to allow weapons inspectors to re-enter the country.

After George W. Bush became president in January 2001, and especially after the September 11 attacks, the U.S. government increased its attention on Iraq. In the first half of 2002, a series of public statements by President Bush and senior members of his administration indicated a willingness to use force, if necessary, to remove Saddam Hussein from power. On October 1, 2002, the CIA delivered a classified National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) assessing the threat represented by Iraq&#x27;s WMD activities. Three days later, CIA Director George Tenet published an unclassified white paper on the subject of Iraq&#x27;s WMD capabilities. Over the next two weeks, a joint resolution authorizing the use of force was passed by both houses of Congress.

Over the next several months the U.S. conducted a diplomatic effort at the United Nations, seeking to obtain that body&#x27;s approval for a new WMD inspection regime, and, potentially, for the use of force to overthrow the Iraqi government. The UN Security Council passed resolution 1441 on November 8, 2002, calling on Iraq to make &quot;an accurate full, final, and complete disclosure&quot; of its WMD programs, and threatening &quot;serious consequences&quot; if it did not comply. In the wake of resolution 1441, Iraq allowed UN weapons inspectors to return to the country. While the inspections were taking place, the U.S. continued to lobby the members of the UN Security Council to pass a resolution explicitly authorizing the use of force against Iraq. As part of that effort U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell gave a presentation to the UN on February 5, 2003, in which he detailed false intelligence gatherings regarding Iraqi WMD. The USA was faced with the opposition of a majority of the Security Council&#x27;s members, including Germany, France, and Russia, and afterwards abandoned the effort to obtain an explicit use-of-force authorization from the UN.

On March 20, 2003, the U.S. and its allies invaded Iraq, an action that led to the overthrow of the government of Saddam Hussein.

Over the ensuing year, U.S. and allied forces searched for evidence supporting the pre-invasion claims about Iraqi WMD stockpiles and programs. The lead role in this search was played by the Iraq Survey Group (ISG), consisting of investigators from the U.S. Department of Defense and the CIA. Although scattered remnants of Iraq&#x27;s WMD stockpiles from the time of the 1991 Gulf War were found, the ISG&#x27;s final report concluded that Iraq did not possess significant WMD capabilities at the time of the invasion of Iraq. The ISG also stated that Iraq had intended to restart all banned weapons programs as soon as multilateral sanctions against it had been dropped.

As these facts were emerging in June 2003, U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS), chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, announced that the Committee, as part of its regular oversight responsibility, would conduct a &quot;thorough and bipartisan review&quot; of Iraqi WMD and ties to terrorist groups. On June 20, 2003, Senator Roberts and Senator John D. Rockefeller IV (D-WV), the Committee&#x27;s vice chairman, issued a joint press release announcing that the committee would conduct a detailed review of the Iraqi WMD intelligence process, including the following areas:

* the quantity and quality of U.S. intelligence on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction programs, ties to terrorist groups, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s threat to stability and security in the region, and his repression of his own people;
* the objectivity, reasonableness, independence, and accuracy of the judgments reached by the Intelligence Community;
* whether those judgments were properly disseminated to policy makers in the Executive Branch and Congress;
* whether any influence was brought to bear on anyone to shape their analysis to support policy objectives; and
* other issues we mutually identify in the course of the Committee&#x27;s review.

== Investigation committee membership ==

The following nine Republicans were members of the Committee at the time the investigation was launched: Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Michael DeWine (R-OH), Kit Bond (R-MO), Trent Lott (R-MS), Olympia Snowe (R-ME), Chuck Hagel (R-NE), Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), and John Warner (R-VA).

The following eight Democrats made up the rest of the Committee: Vice-Chairman Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), Carl Levin (D-MI), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Ronald Wyden (D-OR), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Evan Bayh (D-IN), John Edwards (D-NC), and Barbara Mikulski (D-MD).

=== Chronology ===
In the course of the investigation, Committee staff reviewed more than 30,000 pages of documentation provided by the intelligence community. The Committee requested that it be supplied copies of the President&#x27;s Daily Briefs (PDBs) concerning Iraq&#x27;s WMD capabilities and ties to terrorism, but the White House denied that request. An article by journalist Murray Waas has described a specific controversy over the PDB for September 21, 2001, which allegedly said that the US intelligence community had &quot;no evidence&quot; linking Saddam Hussein to the September 11 attacks, and &quot;scant credible evidence&quot; that Iraq had any significant collaborative ties with al Qaeda.

Committee staff also interviewed more than 200 people, including intelligence analysts and senior officials with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Defense Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and other federal entities involved in intelligence gathering and analysis. The Committee also held a series of hearings on the intelligence concerning Iraqi WMD and ties to terrorism.

On February 12, 2004, Senators Roberts and Rockefeller announced an expansion of the scope of the investigation. The new elements added to the investigation were:

* &quot;the collection of intelligence on Iraq from the end of the Gulf War to the commencement of Operation Iraqi Freedom;&quot;
* &quot;whether public statements and reports and testimony regarding Iraq by U.S. Government officials made between the Gulf War period and the commencement of Operation Iraqi Freedom were substantiated by intelligence information;&quot;
* &quot;the postwar findings about Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction and weapons programs and links to terrorism and how they compare with prewar assessments;&quot;
* &quot;prewar intelligence assessments about postwar Iraq;&quot;
* &quot;any intelligence activities relating to Iraq conducted by the Policy Counterterrorism Evaluation Group (PCTEG) and the Office of Special Plans within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy; and&quot;
* &quot;the use by the Intelligence Community of information provided by the Iraqi National Congress (INC).&quot;

On June 17, 2004, Senators Roberts and Rockefeller announced that the completed report had been unanimously approved by the Committee&#x27;s members, and that they were working with the CIA on the issue of declassification. The completed report, with blacked-out text (&quot;redactions&quot;) made by the CIA, was released on July 9, 2004. The report did not cover most of the new topics announced in the February 12, 2004, press release; instead, those topics were now to be covered in a separate report, to be completed later, covering &quot;phase two&quot; of the investigation.

== Phase I conclusions ==

The 511-page report focuses much of its attention on the October, 2002, classified National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) titled &quot;Iraq&#x27;s Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot;. The report includes 117 formal conclusions, as well as supporting discussion and background information.

=== General conclusions on intelligence relating to Iraq&#x27;s WMD and ties to terrorism ===
The report&#x27;s first conclusion points to widespread flaws in the October 2002 NIE, and attributes those flaws to failure by analysts in the intelligence community:

:&quot;Most of the major key judgments in the Intelligence Community&#x27;s October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE), Iraq&#x27;s Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction, either overstated, or were not supported by, the underlying intelligence reporting. A series of failures, particularly in analytic trade craft, led to the mischaracterization of the intelligence.&quot;

Subsequent conclusions fault the intelligence community for failing to adequately explain to policymakers the uncertainties that underlay the NIE&#x27;s conclusions, and for succumbing to &quot;group think,&quot; in which the intelligence community adopted untested (and, in hindsight, unwarranted) assumptions about the extent of Iraq&#x27;s WMD stockpiles and programs. The committee identified a failure to adequately supervise analysts and collectors, and a failure to develop human sources of intelligence (HUMINT) inside Iraq after the departure of international weapons inspectors in 1998. It also cited the post-9/11 environment as having led to an increase in the intensity with which policymakers review and question threat information.

=== Niger and the Iraqi nuclear program ===

Section II of the report discussed the handling of intelligence indicating that Iraq might be attempting to purchase uranium from Niger. The report examined the role played by former ambassador Joseph Wilson in investigating the issue, and the way Wilson&#x27;s assessment was communicated within the intelligence community. It also discusses the process whereby references to Iraq&#x27;s uranium-procurement efforts were removed from some speeches at the behest of intelligence officials, but left in President Bush&#x27;s 2003 State of the Union address. The report concludes that prior to October, 2002, it was reasonable for the intelligence community to assess Iraq may have been attempting to obtain uranium from Africa.

Section III of the report discusses assessments of Iraq&#x27;s domestic nuclear program. It focuses a significant amount of attention on the intelligence process that took place in the spring of 2001 regarding Iraq&#x27;s attempts to purchase 60,000 high-strength aluminum tubes. The CIA concluded that the tubes could be intended for constructing centrifuges for a uranium-enrichment program (i.e., for a restarted Iraqi nuclear weapons program); analysts in the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense considered that to be unlikely.

The October 2002 NIE stated that Iraq appeared to be reconstituting its nuclear weapons program. The Committee&#x27;s report concluded that this view was not supported by the underlying intelligence, and the report agreed with the opinion of the State Department&#x27;s Bureau of Intelligence and Research, expressed as an &quot;alternative view&quot; in the NIE, that the available intelligence did not make &quot;a compelling case for reconstitution&quot; of the Iraqi nuclear program. The committee reached several conclusions critical of poor communications between the CIA and other parts of the intelligence community concerning this issue.

=== Biological weapons, chemical weapons, and delivery systems ===
The sections of the report concerned with assessments of Iraq&#x27;s biological weapons programs, chemical weapons programs, and delivery systems contain extensive discussion of the problem of inadequate &quot;human intelligence&quot; for intelligence gathering in Iraq. There is discussion of &quot;CURVEBALL,&quot; an Iraqi defector who provided much of the information regarding Iraq&#x27;s alleged mobile bioweapons labs, although much of the material in this part of the report has been redacted. The report concludes that the October 2002 NIE and other statements regarding Iraq&#x27;s biological and chemical WMD and associated delivery systems were for the most part not supported by the underlying intelligence data supplied to the Committee.

Committee Chairman Pat Roberts told NBC&#x27;s Tim Russert that &quot;Curveball really provided 98 percent of the assessment as to whether or not the Iraqis had a biological weapon.&quot; This was in despite the fact that &quot;nobody inside the U.S. government had ever actually spoken to the informantexcept [for a single] Pentagon analyst, who concluded the man was an alcoholic and utterly useless as a source.&quot;

After learning the intelligence provided by Curveball was going to be used as the &quot;backbone&quot; of the case for war, the Pentagon analyst wrote a letter to the CIA expressing his concerns. The Deputy of the CIA Counter Proliferation Unit quickly responded by saying:

&quot;Let&#x27;s keep in mind the fact that this war&#x27;s going to happen regardless of what Curve Ball said or didn&#x27;t say. The Powers That Be probably aren&#x27;t terribly interested in whether Curve Ball knows what he&#x27;s talking about.&quot;

One area where the Committee found that the intelligence community&#x27;s reporting accurately reflected the underlying intelligence concerned Iraq&#x27;s retention of Scud-type ballistic missiles, and its development of new types of short- and medium-range missiles. In the case of the NIE&#x27;s reporting on Iraq&#x27;s development of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), however, the Committee found that the reporting generally was not well-supported by the underlying intelligence, and overstated what was known concerning the likelihood that the Iraqi UAVs were intended for use as a delivery means for biological weapons.

=== Colin Powell&#x27;s speech to the UN ===

Section VII of the Committee&#x27;s report focuses on the intelligence behind Secretary of State Colin Powell&#x27;s speech to the UN on February 5, 2003. The report describes the process whereby the CIA provided a draft of the speech to the National Security Council (NSC), and then, at the request of the NSC, worked to expand the speech with additional material, especially regarding Iraq&#x27;s nuclear program. The report also describes the subsequent review made by Colin Powell and analysts from the State Department with analysts from the CIA. In the speech, Powell said that &quot;every statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources. These are not assertions. What we&#x27;re giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence.&quot; Despite this, the Committee concluded that &quot;[m]uch of the information provided or cleared by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for inclusion in Secretary Powell&#x27;s speech was overstated, misleading, or incorrect.&quot;

=== Pressure on analysts ===
The report partially looks at the question of whether pressure was brought to bear on intelligence analysts to get them to shape their assessments to support particular policy objectives. It recounts how Sen. Roberts made repeated public calls for any analysts who believed they had been pressured to alter their assessments to speak with the Committee about their experiences. The Committee also attempted to identify and interview several individuals who had described such pressure in media reports and government documents. The report says that the Committee did not find any evidence that administration officials tried to pressure analysts to change their judgments; however, an evaluation of the Bush Administration&#x27;s use of intelligence was put off until &quot;phase two&quot; of the investigation. (Several Democratic committee members, although they voted to approve the report&#x27;s conclusions, expressed reservations on this issue and Republicans also acknowledged that the issue of &quot;pressure&quot; would be examined during phase two; see below, in the discussion of the report&#x27;s &quot;additional views&quot;, for details.)

=== The October 2002 white paper ===
A white paper titled &quot;Iraq&#x27;s Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot; was released by CIA Director George Tenet on October 4, 2002, three days after the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iraqi WMD was released. In part, the white paper was a response to Congressional requests for an unclassified version of the information in the NIE, since that document was available only to a small group of lawmakers due to its classified nature. The white paper, although shorter and less-detailed than the NIE, was very similar to it in format and major conclusions. The Committee found that the white paper presented a significantly stronger characterization of the threat represented by Iraqi WMD than did the NIE, and that that stronger characterization was not supported by the underlying intelligence.

=== Iraq&#x27;s alleged links to al-Qaeda ===
Several sections in the report examine topics relating to allegations of links between Iraq and terrorism. The Committee said that the intelligence community produced reasonable conclusions on this topic, although the Committee found gaps in the intelligence-gathering methods used (Page 350).

Much of the Committee&#x27;s investigation in this area concerned the CIA&#x27;s preparation and distribution of a document titled &quot;Iraqi Support for Terrorism&quot;. An initial version of this document was distributed to senior Bush administration officials in September, 2002; an updated version of the document was provided to Congress in January, 2003. The conclusion of CIA analysts was that although Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government had likely had several contacts with al Qaeda during the 1990s, &quot;those contacts did not add up to an established formal relationship.&quot; The CIA also attempted to determine the attitudes that Iraqi and al-Qaeda leadership held toward the possibility of working cooperatively with each other. The available intelligence in this area suggested that Iraqi and al-Qaeda leaders would be wary of working together.

The &quot;most problematic area of contact between Iraq and al-Qaida were the reports of training in the use of non-conventional weapons, specifically chemical and biological weapons.&quot; Abu Musab al-Zarqawi had been present in Baghdad, and Ansar al-Islam, an al-Qaeda affiliate organization that identified itself as the &quot;sworn enemy&quot; of Saddam Hussein had operated in northeastern Iraq in an area under Kurdish control. There was no evidence proving Iraqi complicity or assistance in an al Qaeda attack. The report criticized the CIA for its lack of human intelligence resources in Iraq to assess the country&#x27;s ties with terrorism during the time prior to 2002.

In terms of pressure on analysts, the Committee said that after 9/11, &quot;analysts were under tremendous pressure to make correct assessments, to avoid missing a credible threat, and to avoid an intelligence failure on the scale of 9/11.&quot; The Committee concluded that this resulted in assessments that were &quot;bold and assertive in pointing out potential terrorist links,&quot; and that this pressure was more the result of analysts&#x27; own desire to be as thorough as possible, than of any undue influence by the administration, for which the Committee said they found no evidence. Several Democratic members of the Committee said in the report&#x27;s &quot;additional views&quot; that the question had not been adequately explored.

== The report&#x27;s &quot;additional views&quot; ==
The Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence voted unanimously to approve the finished report. There were, however, significant areas of disagreement, with those disagreements being expressed in the form of &quot;additional views&quot; attached at the end of the report proper.

=== Senators Roberts, Hatch, and Bond ===
In the first &quot;additional view&quot; attached to the report, Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS), joined by Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Christopher Bond (R-MO), presents two conclusions that Democratic members of the Committee were unwilling to include in the report, even though, according to Roberts, &quot;there was no dispute with the underlying facts.&quot; Those two conclusions related to the actions of Joseph Wilson, the former ambassador who was sent to Niger in 2002 to investigate allegations that the Iraqi government was attempting to purchase &quot;yellowcake&quot; uranium, presumably as part of an attempt to revive Iraq&#x27;s nuclear weapons program. The two conclusions were that the plan to send Wilson to investigate the Niger allegation was suggested by Wilson&#x27;s wife, a CIA employee, and that in his later public statements criticizing the Bush administration, Wilson included information he had learned from press accounts, misrepresenting it as firsthand knowledge.

This additional view also discusses the question of pressure on analysts, and recommends caution in implementing reforms in the intelligence community.

=== Senators Rockefeller, Levin, and Durbin ===
Senators John D. Rockefeller (D-WV) (the Committee&#x27;s vice-chairman), Carl Levin (D-MI), and Richard Durbin (D-IL), used their additional view to say that the report painted an incomplete picture, because the Committee had put off until phase two of the investigation the key question of &quot;how intelligence on Iraq was used or misused by Administration officials in public statements and reports.&quot; Because of this, they said, &quot;the Committee&#x27;s phase one report fails to fully explain the environment of intense pressure in which Intelligence Community officials were asked to render judgments on matters relating to Iraq when policy officials had already forcefully stated their own conclusions in public.&quot;

=== Senators Chambliss, Hatch, Lott, Hagel, and Bond ===
The third additional view in the report is by Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), with Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Trent Lott (R-MS), Chuck Hagel (R-NE), and Christopher Bond (R-MO). It focuses on the issues of information sharing and Human Intelligence (HUMINT), and rebuts the allegation of &quot;pressure&quot; contained in the additional view by Senators Rockefeller, Levin, and Durbin.

=== Other additional views ===
Senator Olympia Snow (R-ME) wrote in her additional view that the Committee&#x27;s report revealed poor management and a lack of accountability in the intelligence community, and she called for strong reforms.

Senator John Warner (R-VA) used his additional view to defend the integrity and professionalism of front-line intelligence analysts, and to emphasize that &quot;there was no evidence that anyone involved in reaching intelligence judgments for this NIE was subjected to any pressure from their superiors or from policymakers to alter any of their judgments or analyses.&quot;

The additional view by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), was critical of the Bush administration, saying it &quot;did not fairly represent the intelligence.&quot;

Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) was also critical of the Bush administration in his additional view, giving a list of public statements by senior members of the administration that misstated and exaggerated the underlying intelligence on Iraq.

Senator Richard Durbin (D-IL) focused on the need for greater accountability for the intelligence failures identified in the report.

Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) used her additional view to argue for a number of specific structural and procedural reforms in the intelligence community.

== &quot;Phase two&quot; of the investigation ==
At the time of the report&#x27;s release (July 9, 2004), Democratic members of the committee expressed the hope that &quot;phase two&quot; of the investigation, which was to include an assessment of how the Iraqi WMD intelligence was used by senior policymakers, would be completed quickly. Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS) said of phase two, &quot;It is a priority. I made my commitment and it will get done.&quot;

On March 10, 2005, during a question-and-answer session after a speech he had given at the Woodrow Wilson Center, Senator Roberts said of the failure to complete phase two, &quot;[T]hat is basically on the back burner.&quot; Senator John D. Rockefeller (D-WV), vice chairman of the Committee, made a statement later that day in which he said, &quot;The Chairman agreed to this investigation and I fully expect him to fulfill his commitment... While the completion of phase two is long overdue, the committee has continued this important work, and I expect that we will finish the review in the very near future.&quot;

In a statement regarding the release of the report of the presidential WMD commission on March 31, 2005, Senator Roberts wrote, &quot;I don&#x27;t think there should be any doubt that we have now heard it all regarding prewar intelligence. I think that it would be a monumental waste of time to replow this ground any further.&quot;

On April 10, 2005, Senators Roberts and Rockefeller appeared together on NBC&#x27;s Meet the Press program. In response to a question about the completion of phase two of the investigation, Roberts said, &quot;I&#x27;m perfectly willing to do it, and that&#x27;s what we agreed to do, and that door is still open. And I don&#x27;t want to quarrel with Jay, because we both agreed that we would get it done. But we do havewe have Ambassador Negroponte next week, we have General Mike Hayden next week. We have other hot-spot hearings or other things going on that are very important.&quot;

Moderator Tim Russert then asked Senator Rockefeller if he believed phase two would be completed, and he replied, &quot;I hope so. Pat and I have agreed to do it. We&#x27;ve shaken hands on it, and we agreed to do it after the elections so it wouldn&#x27;t be any sort of sense of a political attack. I mean that was my view; it shouldn&#x27;t be viewed that way.&quot;

On August 2, 2005, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) released the text of a letter she had sent to Senator Roberts, saying, in part, &quot;I am increasingly dismayed by the delay in completing the Committee&#x27;s &#x27;Phase II&#x27; investigation into intelligence prior to the Iraq War... I stand ready to participate in this investigation in any way possible.&quot;

On November 1, 2005, Senator Harry Reid (D-NV), the Senate minority leader, invoked a seldom-used provision of the Senate rules to place the body in a closed session. During a three-and-a-half hour discussion, agreement was reached on the creation of a six-member Senate panel to report by November 14 on &quot;the intelligence committee&#x27;s progress of the phase two review of the prewar intelligence and its schedule for completion.&quot;

On April 26, 2006, an article by journalist Alexander Bolton in the Congressional journal &quot;The Hill&quot; reported that Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS) was seeking to further divide the phase two report. Under Roberts&#x27; new approach, the following components of the report would be released relatively quickly: pre-war intelligence assessments of post-war Iraq, postwar findings in Iraq regarding WMD and ties to terrorism, and the use by US intelligence of information supplied by the Iraqi National Congress. Two components of the report would be delayed: whether public statements before the war by senior government officials were supported by the underlying intelligence, and the role played by the Department of Defense&#x27;s Office of Special Plans in developing the prewar intelligence.

A September 7, 2006, article by journalist Jonathon Weisman in the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that the part of the phase two report comparing the Bush administration&#x27;s public statements about Saddam Hussein with the evidence senior officials reviewed in private would not be released before the November 2006 election.

Two volumes of the phase II report were released on September 8, 2006: &quot;Postwar Findings about Iraq&#x27;s WMD Programs and Links to Terrorism and How they Compare with Prewar Assessments&quot; and &quot;The Use by the Intelligence Community of Information Provided by the Iraqi National Congress.&quot;

After Democrats gained a majority in the Senate during the 2006 midterm election, chairmanship of the committee passed to Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV). The former chair, Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS) left the committee; the ranking Republican and vice chairman of the committee is now Sen. Kit Bond (R-MO).

On May 25, 2007, the committee released a volume of the phase II report titled, &quot;Prewar Intelligence Assessments About Postwar Iraq&quot;. This volume of the report includes seven pages of conclusions regarding assessments provided by the intelligence community to U.S. government leaders prior to the Iraq war. The report concludes that the intelligence community had assessed that establishing a stable government in Iraq would be a &quot;long, difficult, and probably turbulent challenge,&quot; that Iraqi society was deeply divided and would engage in violent conflict unless an occupying power took steps to prevent it, and that the war would increase the threat of terrorism, at least temporarily. The intelligence community also assessed that a U.S. defeat and occupation of Iraq would lead to a surge in political Islam and increased funding for terrorist groups, and that the war would not cause other countries in the region to abandon their WMD programs.

This volume of the report includes an appendix containing two previously classified reports by the National Intelligence Council (NIC) titled, &quot;Regional Consequences of Regime Change in Iraq&quot; and &quot;Principal Challenges in Post-Saddam Iraq&quot;, as well as a long list of recipients within the government of NIC assessments on Iraq. The appendix also contains a number of &quot;Additional Views&quot; in which different members of the committee comment on the history of the committee&#x27;s work in this area, and criticize what they characterize as the politicization of that work by members of the other party.

Phase II of the report was publicly released on Thursday June 5, 2008 whether statements by US Government officials were substantiated by intelligence reports.

This was a bi-partisan majority report (10-5) and &quot;details inappropriate, sensitive intelligence activities conducted by the DoD&#x27;s Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, without the knowledge of the Intelligence Community or the State Department.&quot; It concludes that the US Administration &quot;repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when in reality it was unsubstantiated, contradicted, or even non-existent. As a result, the American people were led to believe that the threat from Iraq was much greater than actually existed.&quot; These included President Bush&#x27;s statements of a partnership between Iraq and Al Qa&#x27;ida, that Saddam Hussein was preparing to give weapons of mass destruction to terrorist groups, and Iraq&#x27;s capability to produce chemical weapons.

The Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Sen.Jay Rockefeller, stated in press release of report&#x27;s publication &quot;It is my belief that the Bush Administration was fixated on Iraq, and used the 9/11 attacks by al Qa&#x27;ida as justification for overthrowing Saddam Hussein. To accomplish this, top Administration officials made repeated statements that falsely linked Iraq and al Qa&#x27;ida as a single threat and insinuated that Iraq played a role in 9/11. Sadly, the Bush Administration led the nation into war under false pretenses. While the report highlights many of the problems with the intelligence and criticizes the Bush Administration for its handling of the lead up to the war and its reasons for doing so, the report also supports in many cases that claims made by the Bush Administration about Iraq&#x27;s Weapons of Mass Destruction programs were &quot;generally substantiated by the intelligence&quot;.

&quot;There is no question we all relied on flawed intelligence. But, there is a fundamental difference between relying on incorrect intelligence and deliberately painting a picture to the American people that you know is not fully accurate.&quot;

The Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Sen.Jay Rockefeller twice alleged that the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, or its former head Douglas Feith may have engaged in unlawful activities, Phase II of the report &quot;&quot;found nothing to substantiate that claim; nothing unlawful about the &quot;alleged&quot; rogue intelligence operation in the PCTEG , nothing unlawful about the Office of Special Plans, and nothing unlawful about the so-called failure to inform Congress of alleged intelligence activities.&quot;&quot; The previous year, the chairman released a press statement claiming that it appeared that the office&#x27;s were &quot;not in compliance with the law.&quot; Yet, rather than pursue these allegations, Rockfeller decided to pursue an issue unrelated to the intelligence, and unrelated to Iraq. He pursued and inquiry of an exploratory meeting held in Rome in 2001 between two DOD officials and two Iranians. Writing for the Minority Opinion as part of the report it was stated that &quot;&quot;After four years of making unsubstantiated allegations of unlawful activities, the calculus appears to be that proclamations of &quot;inappropriate&quot; behavior will generate the desired headlines focusing only on the caustic words, rather than the lack of substance behind them. We hope that these additional views will help redirect that focus to the evidence, or lack thereof.&quot;&quot;

Despite House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s telling her caucus members &quot;that impeachment is off the table; she is not interested in pursuing it,&quot; Dennis Kucinich D-Ohio introduced a formal resolution to the House of Representatives in an attempt to impeach President George W. Bush from the White House. House Democrats unanimously voted to send it to a committee; a maneuver that essentially killed Kucinich&#x27;s efforts.

<doc id="865691" wikidata="Q598071" url="?curid=865691" title="Concrete Island">
<text>Concrete Island is a novel by British writer J. G. Ballard, first published in 1974.

== Plot introduction ==
A car accident leaves Robert Maitland, a wealthy architect in the midst of concealing his affair with a colleague, stranded in a large area of derelict land created by several intersecting motorways. Though surrounded by motorists and within sight of large buildings, Maitland is unable to escape the median strip and must struggle for survival. Along the way he encounters other inhabitants of the median strip, which he comes to call &quot;The Island,&quot; who are a teenaged sex worker who hides out in an abandoned air-raid bunker and an acrobat who became mentally disabled in an accident and now salvages car parts for bizarre shamanic rituals. He learns to survive by scavenging discarded food from littering motorists, and eventually comes to think of the island as his true home. Conflicts ensue with the other inhabitants and before long Maitland is struggling to determine whether he was truly meant to leave the island at all.

The novel heavily references Shakespeare&#x27;s The Tempest, with its remote island setting, its stranded inhabitants, the belief in sorcery and its Caliban character, the unstable acrobat.

==Adaptations==
Ballard&#x27;s papers at the British Library include his screenplay (1972) for &quot;Concrete Island&quot; (Add MS 88938/3/9).

In an episode entitled &quot;The Island&quot; from the cartoon show &quot;CatDog&quot; both characters are stuck in a dilemma identical to the protagonist in Concrete Island.

In 2011, Barcelona-based production company Filmax announced that it was producing a film adaptation of the novel. Scott Kosar was set to adapt Ballard&#x27;s story, and Brad Anderson was to direct. Actor Christian Bale was announced as the main character. A start date has yet to be announced. Bale, who played the lead in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s adaptation of Ballard&#x27;s &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;, apparently is no longer attached to the project.

In June 2013, BBC Radio 4 aired an hour-long adaptation by Graham White, directed by Mary Peate, featuring Andrew Scott as Maitland, Georgia Groome as Jane and Ben Crowe as Proctor.

<doc id="865695" wikidata="Q2555514" url="?curid=865695" title="Mets–Willets Point station (IRT Flushing Line)">
<text>The Mets–Willets Point station is a rapid transit station on the IRT Flushing Line of the New York City Subway. Located near the Citi Field baseball stadium, it is served by the 7 train at all times and by the express &lt;7&gt; train during rush hours in the peak direction or after sporting events. This station is located near Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in Willets Point, Queens, on Roosevelt Avenue between 114th and 126th Streets.

The station opened on May 7, 1927, as a local station named Willets Point Boulevard, with two side platforms and three tracks. It was rebuilt into the current layout of three tracks, two side platforms, and a center island platform for the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The overpass to Flushing Meadows–Corona Park was rebuilt in the early 1940s. Ahead of the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, the original wooden platforms were replaced with more durable concrete slabs. Shortly afterward, the station was renamed Willets Point–Shea Stadium for the nearby baseball stadium. After Shea Stadium was replaced by Citi Field in 2009, the station was renamed after the New York Mets baseball team, and a ramp was added to the Flushing-bound side platform. A connection to the proposed AirTrain LaGuardia people mover system was announced in 2015, but the people mover was canceled in 2023.

The station&#x27;s peak use occurs during Mets games at Citi Field (and at Shea Stadium from 1964 until 2008), located on the north side of the station, and during events at the USTA National Tennis Center, on the south side. The side platform for Manhattan-bound local trains, as well as the island platform for express trains and Flushing-bound local trains, are in regular use. The side platform for Flushing-bound local trains is wheelchair-accessible but is only open during sports games and special events; the other platforms are not wheelchair-accessible.

==History==
===Construction and opening===

The 1913 Dual Contracts called for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT; later Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, or BMT) to build new lines in Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Queens did not receive many new IRT and BRT lines compared to Brooklyn and the Bronx, since the city&#x27;s Public Service Commission (PSC) wanted to alleviate subway crowding in the other two boroughs first before building in Queens, which was relatively undeveloped. The IRT Flushing Line was to be one of two Dual Contracts lines in the borough, along with the Astoria Line; it would connect Flushing and Long Island City, two of Queens&#x27;s oldest settlements, to Manhattan via the Steinway Tunnel. When the majority of the line was built in the early 1910s, most of the route went through undeveloped land, and Roosevelt Avenue had not been constructed. Community leaders advocated for more Dual Contracts lines to be built in Queens to allow development there. The Flushing Line west of 103rd Street opened in 1917. The IRT agreed to operate the line under the condition that any loss of profits would be repaid by the city. In 1923, the BMT started operating shuttle services along the Flushing Line, which terminated at Queensboro Plaza.

As part of the Dual Contracts, the PSC would build the line eastward to at least Flushing. Three stations at Main Street, Willets Point Boulevard, and 111th Street were approved in 1921 as part of an extension of the Flushing Line past 103rd Street. Construction of the station and the double-deck bridge over the Flushing Creek began on April 21, 1923. The line to Main Street had been practically completed by 1925, but it had to be rebuilt in part due to the sinking of the foundations of the structure in the vicinity of Flushing Creek. Once the structure was deemed to be safe for operation, the line was extended to Willets Point Boulevard on May 7, 1927. The station&#x27;s opening was formally celebrated on that date, coinciding with the opening of the Roosevelt Avenue Bridge for cars and buses. Until the Main Street station was completed, trains temporarily terminated at Willets Point Boulevard, where passengers boarded a shuttle bus to travel across the creek to Flushing. The Willets Point Boulevard extension was served by shuttle trains from 111th Street until through service was inaugurated on May 14.

The BMT used wooden elevated rolling stock, as the Flushing Line was built to IRT clearances, and standard steel BMT subway rolling stock were not compatible. Furthermore, because the Main Street station was underground, all elevated trains on the Flushing Line had to terminate at Willets Point Boulevard, as elevated trains were banned in subway tunnels. On January 22, 1928, the line was extended one stop east to Main Street. Afterward, Willets Point Boulevard was by far the least used station on the Flushing Line; it recorded 66,042 entries in 1930, whereas every other station on the line had at least one million passengers. After the Long Island Rail Road closed its Whitestone Branch to the neighborhood of Whitestone in early 1932, there were proposals to connect the branch with the subway at the Willets Point Boulevard station, but this did not happen.

===20th-century modifications===

==== 1939 World&#x27;s Fair ====
The site just south of the Willets Point Boulevard station was remodeled into Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in advance of the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. In December 1936, the IRT announced plans to expand the Willets Point Boulevard station to accommodate additional crowds for the World&#x27;s Fair. The station would contain three platforms and four tracks, capable of serving 40 trains per hour in each direction. Expansion of the Willets Point Boulevard station, as well as the construction of an Independent Subway System (IND) line to a planned World&#x27;s Fair station nearby, was seen as essential for World&#x27;s Fair access. In January 1937, the World&#x27;s Fair Corporation presented plans for the Willets Point Boulevard station&#x27;s expansion to the New York City Board of Estimate, which voted to provide $650,000 for the project. The Manhattan Railway Company, which operated the IRT&#x27;s elevated lines, opposed the planned expansion because it would put the IRT and IND in direct competition, but a federal judge ruled that the project could proceed.

Work on an overpass between the Willets Point Boulevard station and Flushing Meadows Park commenced in late 1937. Ramps and stairs were built from each platform to the overpass, where 16 turnstiles and a canopy were installed. Construction on the station itself began in January 1938, at which point the project had a budget of $494,000. The station had been revised to three tracks and three platforms. The center track and platform would be served by express trains that terminated at Willets Point Boulevard, while the outer two tracks would be used by local trains to Main Street. The IRT installed signals on the express track, which had previously been used as a storage track, and it built a power substation to allow for more frequent service. The IRT bought 50 World&#x27;s Fair Lo-V subway cars in conjunction with these upgrades. World&#x27;s Fair Special express trains began service on April 24, 1939. The fair opened on April 30, and 110,689 people entered the station on that day alone.

==== 1940s and 1950s ====
The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. After the World&#x27;s Fair closed in October 1940, the Willets Point Boulevard station continued to operate, serving Flushing Meadows Park. The overpass to Flushing Meadows Park was reconstructed in 1941. As part of a pilot program aimed at reducing traffic congestion in midtown Manhattan, a park and ride facility with 3,000 parking spots opened next to the Willets Point Boulevard station in November 1947. Many of the Willets Point Boulevard station&#x27;s riders came from the park-and-ride facility and from United Nations General Assembly meetings in Flushing Meadows Park, but the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; said in 1949 that the station &quot;serves practically no resident population&quot;.

The IRT routes were given numbered designations in 1948 with the introduction of &quot;R-type&quot; rolling stock, which contained rollsigns with numbered designations for each service. The route from Times Square to Flushing became known as the 7. On October 17, 1949, the joint BMT/IRT operation of the Flushing Line ended, and the line became the responsibility of the IRT. After the end of BMT/IRT dual service, the New York City Board of Transportation announced that the Flushing Line platforms would be lengthened to 11 IRT car lengths; the platforms were only able to fit nine 51-foot-long IRT cars beforehand. The platforms at the station were extended in 1955–1956 to accommodate 11-car trains. However, nine-car trains continued to run on the 7 route until 1962, when they were extended to ten cars.

At the end of 1949, the city proposed diverting several bus routes that terminated in Flushing, sending these routes to Willets Point Boulevard. The bus-terminal plan faced great opposition. Critics objected that business near the bus terminals in Flushing would decrease and that travel times from Willets Point Boulevard to points east would increase. Supporters of the plan noted the heavy traffic congestion on Flushing streets and the narrowness of the stairways at the Main Street station. Super-express 7 trains started serving the station in 1953, running nonstop between Queensboro Plaza and Willets Point Boulevard during rush hours in the peak direction. The super-express service was discontinued in 1956.

==== 1964 World&#x27;s Fair and Shea Stadium ====
In 1960, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) proposed upgrading the station in advance of the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, which was to be held at Flushing Meadows. The plans included rebuilding the walkway between the station and the park; the Willets Point Boulevard station would be the closest stop to the fair, since the World&#x27;s Fair Line was not planned to be rebuilt. The NYCTA set aside $3.2 million for the expansion of the Willets Point Boulevard station and the nearby Corona Yard. Around the same time, Shea Stadium was built north of the Willets Point Boulevard station as a baseball stadium for the New York Mets. To make way for Shea Stadium, the Willets Point Boulevard park-and-ride facility was closed in 1962 and replaced with a 1,200-space parking lot south of the station. A direct ramp was built from the station to Flushing Meadows Park to accommodate increased crowds. The wooden platforms were also replaced with more durable concrete slabs.

With the opening of the World&#x27;s Fair in April 1964, trains were lengthened to eleven cars, and the NYCTA bought 430 R33 and R36 &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; cars to provide this enhanced service. The station was renamed Willets Point–Shea Stadium. The &quot;Willets Point&quot; in the station&#x27;s name is derived from the boulevard. The boulevard was named after the Willets Point peninsula at Fort Totten, northeast. The area near the Willets Point Boulevard station became known as Willets Point during the 20th century.

One of Shea Stadium&#x27;s parking lots, adjacent to the station, was expanded in 1978, becoming a park-and-ride facility with 1,500 spaces. In 1983, Donald Trump proposed erecting a football stadium within Flushing Meadows–Corona Park and have the city government renovate the Willets Point subway station; however, the stadium was never built. A floor mosaic at the station&#x27;s entrance, depicting the old Trylon and Perisphere, was completed in 1998.

===21st century===
The MTA reintroduced express service to Manhattan at the conclusion of New York Mets weeknight games in July 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTApr07/11/07&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Super-express trains to Manhattan also started operating after weekend games in April 2008. The super-express trains run for approximately one hour after the game and only make three stops in Queens before entering Manhattan: 61st Street–Woodside, Queensboro Plaza, and Court Square.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTApr05/09/08&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After Shea Stadium was replaced with Citi Field in 2009, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority renamed the stop Mets–Willets Point, omitting the corporate-sponsored name associated with the current stadium. Citigroup had sponsored the new baseball field but did not sign a naming rights deal with the MTA. Had the naming rights deal been achieved, the station would have been known as Willets Point–Citi Field. In conjunction with Citi Field&#x27;s construction, the MTA also spent $40 million to renovate the subway and LIRR stations at Willets Point, including $18 million on the subway station. The MTA repainted the station, replaced lighting, and renovated the platforms. A ramp to the northbound side platform was rehabilitated, making that platform compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). However, the other platforms remained inaccessible, prompting protests from disability rights advocates. Except for game days, the Mets–Willets Point station remained sparsely used, with 4,155 passengers on an average weekday in 2014.

==== Unbuilt AirTrain station ====
On January 20, 2015, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a plan to build AirTrain LaGuardia, a people mover running along the Grand Central Parkway and connecting the station to LaGuardia Airport. The project would have included a $50 million renovation of the Willets Point subway station, which would have become fully accessible. In May 2017, Parsons Brinckerhoff was hired to design the AirTrain; at the time, construction was projected to start in 2019. Transportation advocates criticized the plan as being overly roundabout. In October 2021, Kathy Hochul, who succeeded Cuomo as governor after his resignation, directed PANYNJ to pause the AirTrain project. The PANYNJ presented 14 alternatives in March 2022, and the AirTrain LGA project was canceled in March 2023 in favor of increased bus service.

==Station layout==

The Mets–Willets Point station contains three tracks and three platforms. From compass north to south, there is a southbound side platform, southbound track for Manhattan-bound local trains (internally known as track 1), center express track (track M), island platform, northbound track for Flushing-bound local trains (track 2), and northbound side platform. It is served by 7 local trains at all times and by &lt;7&gt; express trains during rush hours in the peak direction. The next station to the west is for express trains and for local trains, while the next station to the east is . Northbound local trains normally open their doors on the island platform. The northbound side platform is used only during Mets games and events at the National Tennis Center, such as the U.S. Open. Some 7 local trains terminate at this station during the evening rush hour.

West of the station, there are switches between the local tracks, the express track, and the northern layup track to 111th Street. East of the station, switches allow trains on the express track in either direction to switch to the local track, but not vice versa.

===Exits===

On the south side of the station, a wheelchair-accessible ramp connects the mezzanine and the northbound (southern) side platform to a footbridge, known as the Passarelle Boardwalk, which passes over Corona Yard and connects to the Mets–Willets Point station on the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)&#x27;s Port Washington Branch, before entering the grounds of the National Tennis Center.

A wooden mezzanine is located underneath the tracks and platforms, with two ramps to the southbound platform and two stairways to the island platform. The north side of the station has a stairway, which formerly led to Shea Stadium but now leads directly to Citi Field&#x27;s Jackie Robinson Rotunda. The mezzanine contains a station agent&#x27;s booth, as well as a main fare control area with several turnstiles and an emergency-exit door. Typically, passengers enter the station through the main fare control area, but these turnstiles are deactivated during Mets games, allowing pedestrians to walk between the LIRR station to the south and Citi Field to the north without paying a fare. During Mets games, the ramps to the southbound platform and the stairs to the island platform are accessed by their own fare-control areas, each with several turnstiles.

===Accessibility===
The Mets–Willets Point station is generally not accessible to passengers with disabilities, except during sporting events, when the northbound side platform is open. In 2009, the MTA built a ramp from the south side of Roosevelt Avenue to the station mezzanine. The two existing ramps from the mezzanine to station level were modified to make them ADA-accessible; the work cost $4 million. The ramps are owned and maintained by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTApr04/10/09&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Some riders with disabilities were unhappy that the station was not made completely accessible during the station&#x27;s renovation. By contrast, other New York City Subway stations that serve sports venues, including 161st Street–Yankee Stadium for Yankee Stadium, 34th Street–Penn Station at Seventh Avenue and Eighth Avenue for Madison Square Garden, and Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center for Barclays Center, are completely accessible. Northbound local trains open their doors on the side platform during games and special events only; the platform typically opens 90 minutes before an event and closes 90 minutes afterward. The southbound platform and the center platform are not wheelchair-accessible. Transit advocates also complained about the Willets Point station&#x27;s lack of accessibility outside of game days; aside from Willets Point, only four of the Flushing Line&#x27;s 18 stations in Queens were accessible. , the MTA also had not allocated funding for further accessibility upgrades in its 2025–2029 capital plan. However, if Steve Cohen&#x27;s proposal for a casino in Willets Point were approved, the station would receive accessibility upgrades as part of the casino&#x27;s construction.

A footbridge had formerly extended north over Casey Stengel Plaza, leading to a long, circular staircase with turnstiles at the bottom, bringing people close to Gate E at Shea Stadium. In 2008, the footbridge and turnstiles were removed and replaced with a wider stairway which is now situated at Mets Plaza, close to Citi Field&#x27;s Jackie Robinson Rotunda. The arrangement of turnstiles in the mezzanine was also reconfigured to improve the post-game pedestrian flows and allow fans to use all ramps, whether they were using the subway or walking across the Passarelle Boardwalk to reach the Long Island Rail Road station or parking lots in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTApr04/09/08&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>Jeremy Ponsonby Meredyth Davies (25 March 1935 – 5 November 2022) was an English Roman Catholic priest and physician. Davies was a leading exorcist and co-founder of the International Association of Exorcists.

==Early life==
Jeremy Ponsonby Meredyth Davies was born on 25 March 1935 in Wimbledon, London to Idris and Elizabeth Davies. He was educated at The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury.

Davies studied English literature at St Edmund Hall, Oxford and studied medicine at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, London. He graduated with a medical degree in 1967, then worked in Mission Hospitals in Guyana, Nigeria and Ghana.

He then became House Surgeon at Redhill General Hospital in Surrey.

==Ordained ministry==
Jeremy Davies became a Catholic in 1966 at the age of 31 when he was baptised at the church of St Charles Borromeo Church, Westminster (Ogle Street, London). He was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1974. He served as a chaplain at Westminster Cathedral from 1974 to 1976, then as an assistant priest at St Mary’s, Chelsea from 1976 to 1979. During this time he became deeply involved in the Pro-Life movement and also spent time in Rome training as an exorcist. He established the annual Pilgrimage of Reparation and Prayer for the Sanctity of Life, centred on Walsingham, Norfolk, in 1984.

Father Davies was appointed exorcist of the Westminster Archdiocese in Great Britain in 1987. In 1993, he co-founded, along with Father Gabriele Amorth and four others, the International Association of Exorcists which now has hundreds of members worldwide.

From 1997 to 2005, Father Davies was parish priest for Puckeridge and Old Hall Green, Hertfordshire; on turning 70 in 2005 he became an assistant priest at Our Lady Help of Christians in Luton. In 2021, aged 86, he retired to Walsingham. He died at a care home in Fakenham on 5 November 2022.

==Personal life and death==
Davies died at Walsingham Priory on 5 November 2022, at the age of 87.

<doc id="865711" wikidata="Q287252" url="?curid=865711" title="Magellanic diving petrel">
<text>The Magellanic diving petrel (Pelecanoides magellani) is a species of diving petrel, one of five very similar, small, auk-like petrels found exclusively in the southern oceans. It is one of the smaller species of diving petrels, though size differences are seemingly indistinguishable between species unless seen up close. It is probably the least known of all five species.

== Taxonomy ==
The Magellanic diving petrel was formally described in 1912 by the Australian born ornithologist Gregory Mathews as a subspecies of the Peruvian diving petrel with the trinomial name &quot;Pelecanoides garnotii magellani&quot;. It is now considered as a separate species with the binomial name &quot;Pelecanoides magellani&quot;. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;pelekan &quot; meaning &quot;pelican&quot; and &quot;-oidēs&quot; meaning &quot;resembling&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;magellani&quot; refers to the Straits of Magellan. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

According to HBW, this species is more closely related to the South Georgian and Peruvian diving petrels. The diving petrels bear strong resemblances to the smaller auk species (i.e. the Dovekie or Little Auk), though they are not closely related. This likeness is a prime example of convergent evolution, since the two have similar niches in their ecosystem, therefore they have evolved similar traits.

== Description ==

This short, compact petrel ranges from in length, and weighs anywhere between 5-6 oz (males are typically heavier than females). The head of &quot;P. magellani&quot; is black, bordered by a contrasting white that leads into a distinctive white crescent extending up towards the back of the neck. The rest of the body follows a strong penguin-like black above, white below scheme, with some white streaks around the sides of the nape and on the scapulars. They also have some blackish-grey mottling on the flank region and sometimes on the sides of the breast. The upperwing is mostly black, with white edges on the secondaries; the underwing coverts are white (with some fragments of black on the &quot;arm&quot;), while the underside of the flight feathers are light grey. The tail feathers (rectrices) are mostly black above (but may appear brown in some lighting) with nearly invisible white tips, and mainly white to a very light grey below. The bill is mostly black, as well as the upward-facing nostrils (which are unique only to the diving petrels), the legs and feet are a light slate-blue to light blue with black-brownish webs, and black claws, and the eyes are a very dark brown color. It only overlaps with the Peruvian diving petrel, &quot;P. garnotii&quot;, but the two are distinguishable by the visible white crescent of the Magellanic vs. the nearly all-black head of the Peruvian.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Magellanic diving petrel breeds on vegetated slopes on coastal and nearshore islands, typically in fjords and channels, in southern Chile, Argentina, and Tierra del Fuego and forages in offshore and inshore waters in the area.

== Behavior and ecology ==
=== Feeding ===
Being the most elusive of the &quot;Pelecanoides&quot; species, not much is known about the ecology of the Magellanic diving petrel. Like all diving petrel species, &quot;P. magellani&quot; is a strong swimmer capable of performing dives of over 10 ft to pursue prey, staying submerged anywhere from 10 seconds to potentially over a minute. The birds usual dive from the surface, though are capable of dropping a few feet from the air into the ocean. They move through the water by propelling themselves with their wings and steering with their tails and feet. The prey of &quot;P. magellani&quot; is shown to consist of small crustaceans, aquatic invertebrates like copepods, amphipods, and plankton, and perhaps small fish could be in their diet as well. They likely carry food back to their chicks via their gular pouches then regurgitating food through them.

=== Breeding ===
Breeding habits of the Magellanic diving petrel are little known. It is known that eggs are laid from November to December, and fledglings have been spotted in March. Like its congeners, &quot;P. magellani&quot; nests in burrows in dense colonies on coastal islands. They lay one egg and are most likely monogamous like other Procellariiformes. Both parents take shifts between incubation and going out to sea to feed during the incubation period, and both take turns feeding their chick, which will reach sexual maturity anywhere from 2–3 years of age. After raising their offspring, the adults go into what is called post-nuptial moult, where they shed old feathers to grow fresh feathers, most notably their flight feathers. During this time, for all &quot;Pelecanoides&quot; species, they become flightless until their feathers have been fully replaced.

== Status and conservation ==
The Magellanic diving petrel is considered as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Their population is estimated anywhere from 6,700 to 330,000 individuals; they are under no immediate threat, but are presumed to be affected by invasive species (i.e. rats or mice) and human activity, namely periodic guano harvests, could be a threat. However, the species is not well-known, and extensive research is required to evaluate current population trends and new threats.

<text>The Great Western Railway is a Canadian short line railway company operating on former Canadian Pacific Railway trackage in Southwest Saskatchewan. Great Western Railway Ltd. is an operating company that services the line and is locally owned and operated by farmers and municipalities in Southwestern Saskatchewan.

==History==

Abbotsford based Westcan Ltd., a railway contracting and maintenance company from BC, purchased 330 miles of track from CP and announced the launch of a new Westcan-owned short line, Great Western Railway Ltd, to provide service on these lines. The original purchase date was July 31, 2000, but this date was pushed to September 8, 2000 after overwhelming rainfall washed out 16 km of track on the Vanguard Subdivision, one of the branches that was being sold. An agreement was reached with Canadian Pacific to repair the damaged section at a cost of more than 500,000 before the takeover was completed.

In 2004 the railway was purchased by local investors from the area of Saskatchewan it serves. It is now locally owned and operated. Great Western Railway continues to serve many producer loading sites along their entire rail network, but also provide railcar storage for Class I railways and railcar companies.

GWR operates on of former Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s Shaunavon, Vanguard, Altawan and Notukeu Subdivisions. GWR also services on the Fife Lake Railway, which is wholly owned by the company, and another of the Red Coat Road &amp; Rail on a yearly contractual basis.
==Engine Roster==

Great Western Railway had humble beginnings hauling hopper cars of grain for small producer loading sites, but as Great Western Railway gradually gained trackage rights over Red Coat Road &amp; Rail and Fife Lake Railway, the railway required more motive power to provide sufficient customer service for their new customers. Up until 2011, Great Western Railway utilized an all MLW M420 roster; however, with the increased maintenance cost of operating Montreal Locomotive Works locomotives, Great Western Railway decided to purchase their first General Electric units. In March 2011 it was announced Great Western Railway would receive two former Burlington Northern Santa Fe GE B40-8Ws for the original Great Western route.
In early 2017, GWRS 576 was purchased, continuing the company&#x27;s effort to move into an entire G.E. fleet. Great Western Rail is currently in the process of selling their entire MLW fleet.

<text>The 111th Street station is a local station on the IRT Flushing Line of the New York City Subway, located at the intersection of 111th Street and Roosevelt Avenue. It is served by the 7 train at all times.

==History==

=== Early history ===

The 1913 Dual Contracts called for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT; later Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, or BMT) to build new lines in Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Queens did not receive many new IRT and BRT lines compared to Brooklyn and the Bronx, since the city&#x27;s Public Service Commission (PSC) wanted to alleviate subway crowding in the other two boroughs first before building in Queens, which was relatively undeveloped. The IRT Flushing Line was to be one of two Dual Contracts lines in the borough, along with the Astoria Line; it would connect Flushing and Long Island City, two of Queens&#x27;s oldest settlements, to Manhattan via the Steinway Tunnel. When the majority of the line was built in the early 1910s, most of the route went through undeveloped land, and Roosevelt Avenue had not been constructed. Community leaders advocated for more Dual Contracts lines to be built in Queens to allow development there.

The station opened on October 13, 1925, with shuttle service between 111th Street and the previous terminal at Alburtis Avenue (now 103rd Street–Corona Plaza). Shuttle service used the Manhattan-bound track. The line was extended to Willets Point Boulevard (now Mets–Willets Point) on May 7, 1927, and to the current terminal at Flushing–Main Street on January 21, 1928.

=== Later years ===
The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. The IRT routes were given numbered designations in 1948 with the introduction of &quot;R-type&quot; rolling stock, which contained rollsigns with numbered designations for each service. The route from Times Square to Flushing became known as the 7. On October 17, 1949, the joint BMT/IRT operation of the Flushing Line ended, and the line became the responsibility of the IRT. After the end of BMT/IRT dual service, the New York City Board of Transportation announced that the Flushing Line platforms would be lengthened to 11 IRT car lengths; the platforms were only able to fit nine 51-foot-long IRT cars beforehand. The platforms at the station were extended in 1955–1956 to accommodate 11-car trains. However, nine-car trains continued to run on the 7 route until 1962, when they were extended to ten cars. With the opening of the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, trains were lengthened to eleven cars.

As part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program, the MTA announced plans to renovate the 52nd, 61st, 69th, 82nd, 103rd and 111th Streets stations, a project that had been delayed for several years. Conditions at these stations were reported to be among the worst of all stations in the subway system. The Manhattan-bound platform at the 111th Street station was closed for renovation on May 15, 2023, and reopened on April 19, 2024. The Flushing-bound platform at this station was closed for renovation on May 6, 2024, and reopened on January 27, 2025.

==Station layout==

The station has five tracks and two side platforms. The express track is located on a flyover above the other four tracks. The two center tracks are not used in passenger service, but instead are used as yard leads of the Corona Yard, where 7 trains are maintained and stored. As a result, trains that go to/from the yard often terminate or begin at this station. Stations with flyover express tracks such as this were far more common on IRT elevated lines in Manhattan during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Due to the yard tracks, an unusual layout takes place in and east of the station. The two layup tracks only have connections to the main tracks east of the station. The eastbound track rises east of the station while the express track lowers. The layup tracks dive down and cross under the eastbound track. The westbound track then rises to level out the three tracks, which continue east.

This station has full windscreens except at the west end of the eastbound platform, which has a waist-high steel fence instead.

===Exits===
Exit is at the south (geographic west) end, with staircases to all four corners of 111th Street and Roosevelt Avenue. The mezzanine and stairway landings are wooden while the flooring at the fare control area is concrete. The station has a crossunder between platforms. New signs have covered the old ones. Above some of the black station signs reading &quot;111 Street&quot; are white signs reading &quot;Hall of Science&quot;, identifying the nearby New York Hall of Science five blocks south.

<text>Sacred Reich is an American thrash metal band from Phoenix, Arizona, formed in 1985. Since 2019, the band&#x27;s lineup has consisted of vocalist-bassist Phil Rind, lead guitarist Wiley Arnett, rhythm guitarist Joey Radziwill, and drummer Dave McClain. Former members include rhythm guitarist Jason Rainey and drummer Greg Hall. Their music often features mid-tempo song structures and musical and lyrical influences from punk rock and hardcore, with their lyrics focusing on political and social topics. The band is credited (along with Testament, Destruction, Death Angel, and Dark Angel) with leading the second wave of thrash metal in the late 1980s.

Sacred Reich gathered initial success with the release of their debut album, &quot;Ignorance&quot; (1987), but remained relatively underground. Upon the release of their first EP, &quot;Surf Nicaragua&quot; (1988), and second album &quot;The American Way&quot; (1990), the band gained significant acclaim, with the latter reaching No. 153 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Their subsequent albums, &quot;Independent&quot; (1993) and &quot;Heal&quot; (1996), failed to attract attention, leading to Sacred Reich&#x27;s disbanding in 2000. They reunited for a series of live shows in 2006, eventually reforming as a live act. In 2018, they began recording their first album after their reformation, &quot;Awakening&quot;, which was released in August 2019. 

== History ==
=== 1985–1989: Formation, early years, &quot;Ignorance&quot;, and &quot;Surf Nicaragua&quot; ===
Sacred Reich formed at Coronado High School in Scottsdale, Arizona in 1985, with the original lineup consisting of rhythm guitarist Jason Rainey, lead guitarist Jeff Martinek, bassist Mike Andre, vocalist Dan Kelly, and drummer Ray Nay. Shortly after the band&#x27;s formation, Phil Rind replaced Andre as the bassist and Greg Hall replaced Nay on the drums. Dan Kelly—who had an apartment at the time—refused to help pay for their first demo, &quot;Draining You of Life&quot;, citing having to pay their apartment bills. Kelly was removed from the band, and Rainey made Rind the new vocalist. In 1986, Wiley Arnett replaced Martinek—who had left shortly after the demo&#x27;s release. With Arnett, they re-recorded the song &quot;Sacred Reich&quot; alongside a new song, &quot;Ignorance&quot;, which was added to the &quot;Draining You of Life&quot; demo. In 1987, recommended by Flotsam and Jetsam bassist Jason Newsted, &quot;Ignorance&quot; appeared on the Metal Blade Records compilation &quot;Metal Massacre VIII&quot;—which brought them significant attention. Soon after, Metal Blade signed a record deal with the band and released their debut album, &quot;Ignorance&quot;, in October of that year. 
&quot;Ignorance&quot; was influenced by punk rock and hardcore, and featured political and social commentary in their lyrics—with themes of war, racism, and political oppression among others. &quot;Ignorance&quot; was generally well received, with reviews citing its political themes and lyrics. On the album, Hit Parader proclaimed: &quot;Intelligence and metal are two things not normally associated with each other, but in the case of Sacred Reich, they blend to form a powerful musical message.&quot; Kerrang! labeled the album the &quot;best debut thrash LP this year.&quot; The band&#x27;s members received several offers from other bands, including Flotsam and Jetsam offering positions to Rind and Arnett, Dark Angel offering Rind a vocalist slot, and Slayer offering Greg Hall a drummer position during Dave Lombardo&#x27;s first departure.

In 1988, Sacred Reich released the EP &quot;Surf Nicaragua.&quot; It is regularly considered their first breakthrough into the world market. In an interview, Rind recalled that the EP outsold &quot;Ignorance&quot; within two weeks. &quot;Surf Nicaragua&quot;, showed a change in the band&#x27;s sound, with better production, less hardcore influences, and slower tempos, sometimes described as &quot;more mature&quot;. After &quot;Surf Nicaragua&quot;&#x27;s release, the band began an extensive world tour, including an appearance at Dynamo Open Air in 1989 which was recorded and released as their first live album, &quot;Alive at the Dynamo&quot;.

=== 1990–2000: &quot;The American Way&quot;, &quot;Independent&quot;, &quot;Heal&quot;, and disbanding ===

In 1990, Sacred Reich released their second album, &quot;The American Way&quot;. The album saw Sacred Reich progress further from their debut &quot;Ignorance&quot;, featuring less use of double bass pedals and shredding&quot;&quot; and favoring slower tracks for a more diverse tempo and tone. It has been cited as one of the first groove metal albums, being released a few months before Pantera&#x27;s &quot;Cowboys from Hell.&quot; They also experimented with other genres, with the closing track &quot;31 Flavors&quot; being a funk rock track. As with previous releases, the album focused heavily on sociopolitical topics, but moved towards a more personal direction, with Rind stating: &quot;Although there are some political songs/overtones, we&#x27;ve tried to deal more with people than political systems.&quot; The album peaked at No. 153 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart on September 1, 1990, staying on the chart for nine weeks. Sacred Reich toured for nearly two years in support of &quot;The American Way&quot;, including co-headlining with Sepultura and Napalm Death on the &quot;New Titans on the Bloc&quot; tour in 1991. In 1991, the band released an EP titled &quot;A Question&quot;. Later that year, Greg Hall parted ways with Sacred Reich and was replaced by former S.A. Slayer member Dave McClain.

Sacred Reich signed with major record label Hollywood Records and released their third album, &quot;Independent&quot;, in 1993. On the album, they continued experimenting with groove metal. Upon release, the album received little recognition, in part because of the drop in popularity of thrash metal and the gap between album releases. Dave McClain departed Sacred Reich to join Machine Head after receiving several offers from them earlier that year. On their fourth album, &quot;Heal&quot; (1996), Sacred Reich returned to Metal Blade Records to produce the album. Upon release, the album received little to no recognition for similar reasons to their previous album &quot;Independent&quot;. Later that year, Greg Hall rejoined the band; however, drummer Chuck Fitzgerald took over drumming duties for the world tour. The band released a live album, &quot;Still Ignorant&quot;, in 1997, but remained relatively inactive outside of touring. The band disbanded between 1999 to 2000.

=== 2006–present: Reformation, &quot;Awakening&quot;, and upcoming sixth studio album ===

In November 2006, Sacred Reich announced they would play several shows in Europe in the summer of 2007 including Wacken Open Air, before reforming as a live act that year. They performed at Wacken Open Air again in 2009, which was recorded and later released as a live album, &quot;Live at Wacken&quot;, in 2012. In the spring of 2017, they announced their first North American tour in 21 years, titled &quot;30 Years of Ignorance&quot; after the 30th anniversary of their debut album, &quot;Ignorance&quot;.

In January 2018, Sacred Reich signed to Metal Blade Records and began working on their fifth album, &quot;Awakening.&quot; On &quot;Awakening&quot;, as a result of Rind&#x27;s Buddhist practices and worldview, the lyrical themes became more positive, with Rind commenting: &quot;We just thought people need some positivity and some encouragement. That&#x27;s what we wanted to do.&quot; Later in January, Greg Hall was fired from the band and temporarily replaced by Tim Radziwill for the demos and touring. In September, Machine Head announced that Dave McClain was leaving their band, officially rejoining Sacred Reich in December. In February 2019, Rainey parted ways with the band for health reasons, being replaced by Tim Radziwill&#x27;s son, Joey. In April, Sacred Reich released the split single &quot;Don&#x27;t Do it Donnie&quot; alongside Iron Reagan, later co-headlining a monthlong tour with them in May. &quot;Awakening&quot; was released on August 23, 2019, being the band&#x27;s first full-length studio album since 1996&#x27;s &quot;Heal&quot; and their first studio album in 23 years. &quot;Awakening&quot; was met with positive reception, with Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, giving the album a 76 out of 100 rating based on 4 reviews. The album was featured at No. 9 on Decibel&#x27;s 40 Best Metal Albums of 2019. In support of the album, Sacred Reich toured in Europe alongside Night Demon, and supported Gwar on their &quot;Use Your Collusion&quot; tour that year. Rainey later died on March 16, 2020, at the age of 53 from a heart attack.

At the beginning of 2024, Sacred Reich announced they were recording their upcoming sixth studio album, which was expected to be released at the end of the year. However, it appeared this plan had changed, with Rind announcing in a post on New Year&#x27;s Eve of 2024 that the band would soon be entering the studio to record their new album for a late August 2025 release.

== Artistry ==
=== Musical style and lyrics ===
Sacred Reich is known for their political and social lyrics, which often focus on topics such as war, racism, and ecology. The band&#x27;s style, generally considered thrash metal, frequently uses mid-tempo song structures and frequently takes influences from other genres such as punk rock and hardcore punk, notably on their debut album &quot;Ignorance&quot;. They have also used elements of groove metal on their later releases and have been considered a progenitor of the genre, although the band has said they were &quot;unaware of the assessment.&quot;
=== Name ===
According to Wiley Arnett, the name &quot;Sacred Reich&quot; originated from a road trip taken by Dan Kelly and Paul Stottler—a friend of and artist for the band—to Hollywood, where they spotted graffiti tagged by a gang, labeled &quot;SR-13&quot;, in the form of &quot;[an] equal sign with the SR, and then a jagged 13 below it.&quot; They took the idea of the &quot;SR&quot; and brainstormed what the &quot;SR&quot; could be an acronym of, eventually picking the phrase &quot;Sacred Reich&quot;. The band reportedly chose the name because &quot;no one would ever think it was country&quot;, with Arnett telling the Phoenix New Times: &quot;Sacred Reich came up, and one of the first comments{{nbsp}}... was, &#x27;well, look at this one—I&#x27;ll tell you what, when someone reads that, they&#x27;re gonna know it&#x27;s not a fuckin&#x27; country band.&#x27; We started embracing it right then.&quot;

=== Mascot ===

The band&#x27;s mascot, named &quot;Our Dude&quot; (or simply &quot;OD&quot;), appears on the cover art of several of Sacred Reich&#x27;s releases and merchandise. The mascot was created as a sketch by Paul Stottler during class at Coronado High School in either 1986 or 1987, and was later drawn in pen and ink and then colorized for merchandise. In a Facebook post, the band described Our Dude as a &quot;post-apocalyptic mutant warrior&quot;, with its &quot;story&quot; being &quot;Road Warrior meets Planet of the Apes meets Kung Fu.&quot;

== Influence and legacy ==
{{Needs expansion|date=February 2025}}
The band&#x27;s discography, most notably &quot;Ignorance&quot;, &quot;Surf Nicaragua&quot;, and &quot;The American Way&quot;, have been repeatedly cited as influential on the thrash metal scene. Revolver named Sacred Reich as &quot;one of the most important thrash bands of the eighties and nineties,&quot; dubbing their debut album, &quot;Ignorance&quot;, as &quot;a milestone in the thrash movement&quot;, with the album later appearing on their 25 Essential Thrash Albums list. Metal Hammer dubbed the band &quot;among the few socially conscious thrashers in the 80s&quot;. The band is commonly attributed to helping lead the second wave of thrash metal during the late 1980s alongside bands such as Testament, Death Angel, Dark Angel, and Forbidden.

<text>Cynan ab Iago (c. 1014 c. 1063) was a Welsh prince of the House of Aberffraw. His father, Iago ab Idwal ap Meurig, became King of Gwynedd in 1023, and his son, Gruffudd, later became king.

Iago was King of Gwynedd from 1023 to 1039 but was killed (possibly by his own men) while Cynan was still young. The throne was seized by Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, a member of a cadet branch of the royal dynasty. Cynan fled to Ireland and took refuge in the Kingdom of Dublin. He married Ragnhildr, the daughter of Olaf Arneid (; Olaf Sigtrygsson and Amlaíb mac Sitriuc) and the granddaughter of King Sigtrygg Silkbeard. His wife was descended from Brian Boru through her father&#x27;s mother Sláine ingen Briain and his wife&#x27;s mother was the daughter of a son of King of Leinster . The spelling Ragnailt appears on the list of fair women known as recorded in the Book of Leinster and elsewhere.

It can be inferred that he died soon after the birth of his son Gruffudd, as the twelfth century work written in Middle Welsh titled &quot;Historia hen Gruffud vab Kenan vab Yago&quot; () details Cynan&#x27;s ancestry but omits him from its account of Gruffudd&#x27;s youth. Instead, Gruffudd&#x27;s mother tells him about his father and the he should claim across the sea. Following two major Saxon invasions under Harold and Tostig Godwinson, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn was killed in 1063: the later Welsh &quot;Brut y Tywysogion&quot; reported he was done in by his own men, while the &quot;Ulster Chronicle&quot; states he was killed by Cynan ab Iago in 1064.

The only record referring to Cynan as King of Gwynedd is the &quot;Historia hen Gruffud vab Kenan vab Yago&quot;. It is believed that the &quot;Historia&quot; was written from an earlier Latin manuscript written after the death of Gruffudd ap Cynan and during the early reign of Owain Gwynedd. It was first published as &quot;Buchedd neu Hanes Gruffud ap Kenan&quot; () in The Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales in the nineteenth century. Gruffudd, his son, was unusually referred to as grandson of Iago rather than the son of Cynan, which suggests Cynan was not well known.

<text>The 103rd Street–Corona Plaza station is a local station on the IRT Flushing Line of the New York City Subway, located at the intersection of 103rd Street and Roosevelt Avenue. It is served by the 7 train at all times.

==History==

=== Early history ===
The 1913 Dual Contracts called for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT; later Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, or BMT) to build new lines in Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Queens did not receive many new IRT and BRT lines compared to Brooklyn and the Bronx, since the city&#x27;s Public Service Commission (PSC) wanted to alleviate subway crowding in the other two boroughs first before building in Queens, which was relatively undeveloped. The IRT Flushing Line was to be one of two Dual Contracts lines in the borough, along with the Astoria Line; it would connect Flushing and Long Island City, two of Queens&#x27;s oldest settlements, to Manhattan via the Steinway Tunnel. When the majority of the line was built in the early 1910s, most of the route went through undeveloped land, and Roosevelt Avenue had not been constructed. Community leaders advocated for more Dual Contracts lines to be built in Queens to allow development there.

This station opened on April 21, 1917, as &quot;Alburtis Avenue&quot;, as the easternmost station of an extension of the Flushing line past Queensboro Plaza. It was later renamed &quot;104th Street&quot;, giving the possibility of a sealed exit at the north end, before taking its current name of &quot;103rd Street–Corona Plaza&quot;. This station still contains signs showing &quot;Alburtis Avenue&quot;, but which now have been covered up. This station was the eastern terminal for the joint BMT and IRT services on the line until the extension to 111th Street opened on October 13, 1925.

=== Later years ===
The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. The IRT routes were given numbered designations in 1948 with the introduction of &quot;R-type&quot; rolling stock, which contained rollsigns with numbered designations for each service. The route from Times Square to Flushing became known as the 7. On October 17, 1949, the joint BMT/IRT operation of the Flushing Line ended, and the line became the responsibility of the IRT. After the end of BMT/IRT dual service, the New York City Board of Transportation announced that the Flushing Line platforms would be lengthened to 11 IRT car lengths; the platforms were only able to fit nine 51-foot-long IRT cars beforehand. The platforms at the station were extended in 1955–1956 to accommodate 11-car trains. However, nine-car trains continued to run on the 7 route until 1962, when they were extended to ten cars. With the opening of the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, trains were lengthened to eleven cars.

As part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program, the MTA announced plans to renovate the 52nd, 61st, 69th, 82nd, 103rd and 111th Streets stations, a project that had been delayed for several years. Conditions at these stations were reported to be among the worst of all stations in the subway system. The Flushing-bound platform at the 103rd Street station will close for five months for renovation in 2025, followed by the five-month closure of the Manhattan-bound platform.

==Station layout==

This elevated station has three tracks and two side platforms. The center track is used by the rush hour peak direction &lt;7&gt; express service. Both platforms have beige windscreens and brown canopies supported by green frames and support columns in the center and green waist-high steel fences at both ends. The station names are in the standard black plates with white lettering, though some lampposts at both ends have their original white signs in black lettering.

===Exits===
This station&#x27;s only entrance/exit is an elevated station house beneath the tracks. A pair of staircases from either side of Roosevelt Avenue between 103rd and 104th Streets go up to the station house, where there is a token booth in the center and a turnstile bank on either side. Both turnstile banks lead to a wooden waiting area/crossunder and have a single staircase going up to either platform.

<text>The Junction Boulevard station (originally Junction Avenue station) is an express station on the IRT Flushing Line of the New York City Subway, located at the intersection of Junction Boulevard and Roosevelt Avenue in Corona, Queens. It is served by the 7 train at all times and by rush hour peak-direction &lt;7&gt; express service.

==History==

=== Early history ===
The 1913 Dual Contracts called for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT; later Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, or BMT) to build new lines in Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Queens did not receive many new IRT and BRT lines compared to Brooklyn and the Bronx, since the city&#x27;s Public Service Commission (PSC) wanted to alleviate subway crowding in the other two boroughs first before building in Queens, which was relatively undeveloped. The IRT Flushing Line was to be one of two Dual Contracts lines in the borough, along with the Astoria Line; it would connect Flushing and Long Island City, two of Queens&#x27;s oldest settlements, to Manhattan via the Steinway Tunnel. When the majority of the line was built in the early 1910s, most of the route went through undeveloped land, and Roosevelt Avenue had not been constructed. Community leaders advocated for more Dual Contracts lines to be built in Queens to allow development there.

This elevated station opened on April 21, 1917, as Junction Avenue, as part of a large extension of the Flushing Line from its previous eastern terminus at Queensboro Plaza to Alburtis Avenue (now 103rd Street–Corona Plaza). It was part of the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, albeit served by shuttles of IRT dimensions, and the two companies jointly operated the Flushing and Astoria Lines due to the provisions of the Dual Contracts. The station was renamed Junction Boulevard in 1940.

=== Later years ===
The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. The IRT routes were given numbered designations in 1948 with the introduction of &quot;R-type&quot; rolling stock, which contained rollsigns with numbered designations for each service. The route from Times Square to Flushing became known as the 7. On October 17, 1949, the joint BMT/IRT operation of the Flushing Line ended, and the line became the responsibility of the IRT. After the end of BMT/IRT dual service, the New York City Board of Transportation announced that the Flushing Line platforms would be lengthened to 11 IRT car lengths; the platforms were only able to fit nine 51-foot-long IRT cars beforehand. The platforms at the station were extended in 1955–1956 to accommodate 11-car trains. However, nine-car trains continued to run on the 7 route until 1962, when they were extended to ten cars. With the opening of the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, trains were lengthened to eleven cars.

In 1981, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system. A renovation of the Junction Boulevard station was funded as part of the MTA&#x27;s 1980–1984 capital plan. The MTA received a $106 million grant from the Urban Mass Transit Administration in October 1983; most of the grant would fund the renovation of eleven stations, including Junction Boulevard.

==Station layout==

This station has two island platforms and three tracks. The two outer local tracks are used by the full-time 7 local service while the middle express track is used by the rush-hour peak direction &lt;7&gt; express service. Both platforms have red canopies with green frames and support columns in the center and are narrower at either ends.

===Exits===
This station has one elevated station house beneath the platforms tracks. Four staircases from each corner of Junction Boulevard and Roosevelt Avenue go up to a mezzanine that has a token booth in the center and a turnstile bank on the east and west sides. These turnstile banks lead to a crossunder and has a single staircase going up to each platform towards the west (railroad south) end.

This station was made ADA accessible in 2007, at the cost of $6 million. From the northeast corner of the intersection this station is located at, a single elevator goes up to an enclosed overpass above the platforms with an intermediate stop at the mezzanine. The overpass has two HEET turnstiles and a gate that is automatically opened when a MetroCard is swiped at either turnstile. Inside, two elevators go down to the platforms, one for each. Previously, an &quot;AutoGate&quot; Reduced-fare MetroCard was required to open the gate. An emergency staircase goes down to the Manhattan-bound platform and an employee-facility is on the Flushing-bound end of the overpass.
