<text>Warkworth () is a town on the Northland Peninsula in the upper North Island of New Zealand. It is in the northern part of the Auckland Region, north of Auckland and south of Whangārei, at the head of Mahurangi Harbour. State Highway 1 runs past it.

Mahurangi Harbour and surrounding area has been settled by Māori since at least the 13th century. As Warkworth is the uppermost navigable point on the Mahurangi River, it was a crossroads between overland traffic and waka, and gained the name , referring to the waterfalls on the river. Māori people of the Mahurangi Harbour area moved seasonally between different kāinga based on available resources, and came to the dense kauri forests at Puhinui for food resources such as berries and eels, and to fell trees to build waka.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, Ngāti Rongo, Ngāti Raupō and Ngāti Manuhiri were active in the Warkworth area. The area was depopulated during the Musket Wars of the 1820s, with Te Kawerau hapū taking shelter with differing tribes in the north. Ngāti Rongo returned to the area in 1836, followed by Ngāti Manuhiri in the early 1840s.

European settler John Anderson Brown first settled at Warkworth in 1843, establishing a timber mill on the banks of the Mahurangi River. The town was officially established in 1853, and became a hub for timber and shipbuilding industries. The town became a hub for the Wilsons Cement Works in 1884. By the 1930s, as roads improved, it transitioned into a commercial and service hub for the surrounding rural area.

Warkworth and the surrounding areas was home to over 40 United States Army camps during World War II. In 1971 the Warkworth Radio Astronomical Observatory was established near the town. The town&#x27;s population has grown significantly since the mid-2000s.

==Etymology==

Warkworth was named in 1853 by early settler John Anderson Brown, who took the name from Warkworth in Northumberland, allegedly because the Mahurangi River reminded him of the River Coquet at Warkworth, where a relative of Browns worked as a school headmaster. The major streets of Warkworth were named after villages adjacent to Warkworth in England, or after major Northumbrian families. For ten years prior to this, the area was known as Brown&#x27;s Mill, after the John Anderson Brown sawmill, and until the 1870s the township was primarily known by the name Upper Mahurangi.

The traditional Māori name for Warkworth is (&quot;Big Plume&quot;), referring to the Puhinui Waterfalls located in the township.

==Geography==

The Warkworth area is at the upper navigable point of the Mahurangi River, which flows south-east towards the Mahurangi Harbour. The township is located at the point where the river runs over a low waterfall and becomes a tidal estuary, The wider area is predominantly uplifted Waitemata Group sandstone. Historically, the area was heavily forested until European settlement.

The highest point in Warkworth is a hill located between Falls Road and View Road, where a water reservoir and cellphone tower are located.

On the eastern side of the river is the Mahurangi Peninsula, with the seaside towns of Snells Beach and Algies Bay. It is here that the scenic Kawau Island is found, notable for its historic Mansion House, once the private retreat of Governor Grey.

East of Warkworth and north of Mahurangi East lies the Tāwharanui Peninsula, home of the Tāwharanui Regional Park and Tawharanui Marine Park. To the north is the town of Wellsford, with the thickly forested Dome Valley lying in between. On the west coast lies the Kaipara Harbour, while to the south is the small historic township of Puhoi and further south the larger town of Orewa.

===Climate===
Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as oceanic (Cfb), but it is rainier in winter.

==History==
===Māori history===

The wider Mahurangi area has been settled since at least the 13th century. Local traditions describe Toi-te-huatahi being the founding ancestor for Mahurangi peoples, and Toi is the namesake for many features in the area, including Little Barrier Island / Te Hauturu-o-Toi and the Hauraki Gulf (Te Moananui-ā-Toi). One of the first known iwi to have settled in the area is Ngāi Tāhuhu. Named for Tāhuhunui-o-te-rangi, captain of the &quot;Moekākara&quot; waka, the iwi also settled at Ōtāhuhu in Auckland, Whangārei and the Bay of Islands. &quot;Te Arawa&quot; and &quot;Tainui&quot; migratory waka are known to have visited the area, and descendants of captain Manaia of the &quot;Māhuhu-ki-te-rangi&quot; waka are known to have intermarried with Ngāi Tāhuhu. A location of significance near Warkworth is , the peak of the Dome Forest, which was used as a traditional boundary marker, and is the location where Tainui ancestress Reipae married the Ngāi Tāhuhu rangatira Tahuhupotiki.

Mahurangi peoples primarily focused settlement along the shores of the Hauraki Gulf, moving seasonally between different kāinga based on available seasonal resources. Puhinui was a crossroads, at the highest navigable point by waka. This led to overland ara. While the majority of known archaeological sites near Warkworth are on the Mahurangi Harbour coast, the Mahurangi River (traditionally called ) shores and adjoining forests would have been utilised for resources, such as berry collecting, bird snaring, flax harvesting, eel fishing and felling trees to construct waka.

====Arrival of Maki====
In the mid-17th century, the warrior Maki migrated from the Kāwhia Harbour to his ancestral home in the Auckland Region. Maki conquered and unified many of the Tāmaki Māori tribes, including those of the West Auckland, the North Shore and Mahurangi, and unified these peoples under the name Te Kawerau. In Mahurangi, this was done by conquering Ngāi Tāhuhu, and by forming peacemaking marriages with the Te Roroa and Ngāti Manaia/Ngātiwai tribes who were migrating from the north.

After Maki&#x27;s death, his sons settled different areas of his lands, creating new hapū, including the Mahurangi hapū of Ngāti Rongo, Ngāti Raupō, Ngāti Manuhiri, Ngāti Maraeariki, Ngāti Poataniwha and Ngāti Kahu.

Ngāti Rongo formed from the union of Maki&#x27;s son Ngāwhetu and Moerangaranga of Ngā Rīriki, the latter of whom is also an ancestor for Te Uri-o-Hau of Ngāti Whātua. Ngāti Raupō descend from Maki&#x27;s son Maraeariki, and settled on the Tāwharanui Peninsula, while Ngāti Manuhiri settled the Whangateau Harbour north to Pākiri. As these hapū developed, Ngātiwai developed strong ties to Kawerau hapū through successive generations of intermarriage, especially Ngāti Rehua, Ngāti Manuhiri, and Ngāti Kahu.

By the mid-1700s, Marutūāhu tribes from the Hauraki Gulf, especially Ngāti Pāoa, sought to control the shark fishery located on the Mahurangi coast, between Kawau Island and the Whangaparāoa Peninsula. War broke out between Ngāti Pāoa and the Kawerau hapū. By the early 19th century, Kawerau-descended hapū held exclusive land rights to the Mahurangi, while fishing rights were shared between these hapū and the Marutūāhu tribes.

By the early 19th Century, the Mahurangi Harbour was primarily settled by Ngāti Rongo and their related hapū Ngāti Kā and Ngāti Raupō, all of whom kept close ties to Ngāti Manuhiri, while Marutūahu tribes frequented the coast during the summertime.

====Musket Wars and Early European arrivals====
In the early 1820s during the Musket Wars, Ngāpuhi and related northern tribes attacked the Mahurangi area settlements in retaliation for past losses, leading to the Mahurangi area being depopulated. Ngāti Rongo, then approximately 100 people, sought refuge with their Ngāti Manu relatives in the Bay of Islands under the protection of Pōmare II, Ngāti Raupō at Whangārei with Te Parawhau and Te Whareumu, and Ngāti Mahuhiri to the north of Whangārei with Ngātiwai.

In 1832, Gordon Browne established a spar station on the Pukapuka Peninsula of the Mahurangi Harbour. Browne obtained rights to fell kauri from Marutūāhu tribes, after which Ngāpuhi chiefs Patuone and Tītore brokered a deal with the British Royal Navy to supply kauri spurs for navy ships, using the spar station. This station was the first European settlement in the Auckland Region, and most of the station labourers were members of Ngāti Pāoa and Ngāpuhi. The station operated until 1834, and was contested by Kawerau descendant hapū.

Ngāti Rongo returned to the Mahurangi area in 1836, under the leadership of Te Hēmara Tauhia, focusing settlement at Te Muri. Ngāti Rongo and Ngāti Raupō occupied modern Warkworth by the late 1830s or early 1840s, with Ngāti Mahuhiri likely returning in the early 1840s. By this period, many of the Kawerau hapū had developed associations with Ngāti Whātua, and the Mahurangi area was contested between Kawerau, Ngāti Whātua and Marutūāhu tribes.

===Land sales and early colonial settlement===
Following the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, the Crown made the first purchases of the Mahurangi and Omaha blocks on 13 April 1841, which included the Mahurangi Harbour. While some iwi and hapū with customary interests had been engaged, such as Ngāti Paoa, Ngāti Rongo, Ngāti Raupō and Ngāti Manuhiri were not a part of this transaction, and it took the Crown until the 1850s to finalise a deal with these tribes. Te Hemara Tauhia and his people continued to occupy their lands at Te Muri during this time.

In 1843, early settler John Anderson Brown began squatting on land along the Mahurangi River, establishing a dam and timber mill on the left bank in 1844. The timber industry, later joined by shipbuilding, were the two major economic activities in the area during the mid-19th century. In 1853, Brown was among the first land owners in the area, when Warkworth was established as a planned settlement and he and his daughter Amelia purchased of land from the Crown. The town developed slowly, primarily around the Mahurangi River wharf, where settlers could supply goods and services for the Auckland market. Bridge House Lodge, established on the site of John Anderson Brown&#x27;s home next door to the Warkworth Bridge, is the oldest surviving building in Warkworth.

The Mahurangi Post Office and Library were established in 1859, followed by the first local government in the area, when the Mahurangi Highway Board was established in 1863. In the same year, the Mahurangi School opened, and by 1868 Henry Palmer had established a flour mill in the settlement. Shipbuilding declined in the area during the late 1870s, and ceased in 1880. Unlike other areas of northern Auckland and Northland, kauri gum digging did not appear to play a large part in the economy of the town. Orchards were established around Warkworth, with some continuing to operate today.

In 1883 the Masonic Hall was built and up until 1911 served as a public hall until a dedicated building was constructed on the corner of Alnwick and Neville Streets.

Ngāti Rongo continued to hold a presence in the area in the 19th century. While initially made landless through the Mahurangi Purchase, a native reserve was established between Pukapuka and Waiwera in 1853. Land in this block was gradually sold land to settlers, and when Te Hemara Tauhia died in 1891, his Ngāti Rongo family moved to Glorit. In the 21st century, 13 iwi and collectives have interests in the Warkworth area, of whom Ngāti Manuhiri are considered mana whenua; or having historic and territorial rights in the area.

===Lime and concrete works===

John Sullivan began Warkworth&#x27;s first roche lime production in 1849. John Southgate established a second limeworks at a site further downstream in 1857, selling it to Nathaniel Wilson in 1864.

Wilson became interested in cement in 1883 and formed the Wilsons Cement Works in 1884 with his brothers John and James. The site became the first portland cement manufacturing works in the Southern Hemisphere. The company built the Warkworth Bridge in 1899.

By 1910, the cement company had become one of the major employers in Warkworth. In 1918, it amalgamated with the New Zealand Portland Cement Company, who were based in Motu Matakohe – Limestone Island in Whangārei, and the operation was gradually moved to Whangārei, eventually closing entirely in 1929. Ruins remain and the mine is a popular local freshwater swimming hole.

===World War II, developing community===
In 1933, the road to Auckland had improved enough that the town no longer relied on the steamer service to transport goods, and the steamers stopped operating in 1937. After this time, Warkworth transitioned from a logging town into a commercial and service hub for the wider north Auckland area. Logging continued at Warkworth until the 1930s.

During World War II, Warkworth and the surrounding area became home to over 40 camps for United States Army servicemen, including the 3rd Marine Division, 25th Infantry Division and the 43rd Infantry Division. The first personnel to arrive were the 43rd Infantry Division in October 1942, and camps included the modern-day Rodney Showgrounds, and a military hospital that was constructed near Hill Street. The historic cement works, which had been closed since 1928, was used as demolition practice by the servicemen. By 1944 when the United States Army had left, the New Zealand Army requisitioned many of the camps.

In 1971, the Warkworth Radio Astronomical Observatory was established near the town, as the first major long-range telecommunication centre for satellite telephone circuits and television in New Zealand. By 2010, the facility had been redeveloped as an AUT radio observatory.

The Warkworth &amp; District Museum, a local museum showcasing local history, opened in 1980.

Warkworth saw significant suburban housing growth between 2008 and 2018, with the population increasing by 61% between 2006 and 2018. In 2023, the Pūhoi to Warkworth section of the Auckland Northern Motorway was opened, diverting traffic away from Warkworth. The town is currently projected to triple in size by the late 2040s.

==Local government==
The first local government for the township was the Upper Mahurangi Highway District, which was formed on 24 December 1864. It was one of the first highway districts to form north of the city of Auckland, and was formed to administer the road upkeep costs in the area. With the abolition of the provinces of New Zealand in 1876, Warkworth became part of Rodney County, which was formed at that time. The highway district was dissolved in 1903 and the Warkworth Road Board was created. In 1908 the road board became a town board, and in 1954 it became a town council following the Municipal Corporations Act. In 1976 Warkworth became a district community council of Rodney County. From 1989 to 2010, Warkworth was part of Rodney District.

In November 2010, all city and district councils in the Auckland Region were merged into a single unitary authority, Auckland Council, with Warkworth in the Rodney Local Board area. Electors in Warkworth vote for the seven-member Rodney Local Board, and also a Rodney ward councillor, who represents the area on the Auckland Council. The local board operates from the Warkworth Service Centre on Baxter Street. The Rodney Local Board formerly held meetings outside of the local board area, in Orewa on the Hibiscus Coast. Since 2023, the local board has held meetings at 3 Elizabeth Street in Warkworth.

<text>Ludmila of Bohemia ( 860 – 15 September 921) is a Czech saint and martyr venerated by the Orthodox and the Roman Catholics. She was born in Mělník as the daughter of the Sorbian prince Slavibor. Saint Ludmila was the grandmother of Saint Wenceslaus, who is widely referred to as Good King Wenceslaus. Saint Ludmila was canonized shortly after her death. As part of the process of canonization, in 925, Wenceslaus moved her remains to St. George&#x27;s Basilica, Prague.

==Marriage==
Ludmila was married to Bořivoj I of Bohemia, the first Christian Duke of Bohemia, in 873. The couple converted to Christianity through the efforts of Methodius. Their efforts to convert Bohemia to Christianity were initially not well received, and pagans drove them from their country for a time. Eventually the couple returned and ruled for several years before retiring to Tetín, near Beroun.

In 875, the eldest son of the princely couple, Spytihněv, was born. Ludmila gave birth to at least six children (three sons and three daughters - not counting any children who died in infancy and were not mentioned in the records) during the approximately fourteen years of her marriage. Only the names of two sons Spytihněv 875-915 and Vratislav c. 888-921) are known, both of whom later ascended to the princely throne.

Bořivoj was succeeded by their son Spytihněv. Spytihněv was succeeded by his brother Vratislav. When Vratislav died in 921, his son Wenceslas became the next ruler of Bohemia. It had been primarily Ludmila who raised her grandson, and she acted as regent for him.

==Ludmila and Drahomíra==

Wenceslaus&#x27; mother, Drahomíra, became jealous of Ludmila&#x27;s influence over Wenceslaus. She had two noblemen, Tunna and Gommon (probably of Frankish or Varangian descent) murder Ludmila in Tetín, and part of Ludmila&#x27;s narrative states that she was strangled with her veil. Initially, Ludmila was buried at St. Michael&#x27;s at Tetín.

Ludmila was canonized shortly after her death. As part of the process of canonization, in 925 Wenceslaus moved her remains to St. George&#x27;s Basilica, Prague. She is venerated as a patroness of Bohemia. She is considered to be a patron saint of Bohemia, converts, duchesses, those with problems with in-laws, and widows. Her feast day is celebrated on September 16.

Antonín Dvořák composed his oratorio &quot;Saint Ludmila&quot; between September 1885 and May 1886. The work was commissioned by the publisher Littleton for the Leeds Festival.

== Interesting facts ==
A direct descendant of Saint Ludmilla is Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, Archbishop of Vienna.

<doc id="868722" wikidata="Q952706" url="?curid=868722" title="Fred Ottman">
<text>Fred Alex Ottman (born August 10, 1956) is an American retired professional wrestler. He worked for the World Wrestling Federation (later WWE) from 1989 to 1993 under the ring names Tugboat and Typhoon. As the former, he played a key babyface ally of Hulk Hogan. As the latter, he turned heel to form The Natural Disasters with Earthquake and held the WWF Tag Team Championship.

In 1993, Ottman debuted as The Shockmaster in World Championship Wrestling and immediately fell over, losing his mask on live television while his teammates broke character and laughed. This botch hurt his career, and is now generally regarded as the worst debut in wrestling history, but he was able to capitalize on its notoriety after his in-ring retirement.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1984–1988)===
Ottman was trained by Boris Malenko and got his start as Sigfried the Giant in February 1985, for Championship Wrestling from Georgia. He later wrestled for Texas All-Star Wrestling and the Continental Wrestling Association as Big Bubba. He wrestled as Big Bubba in 1986 and 1987 in Memphis for Jerry Jarrett&#x27;s CWA wrestling where he teamed with Goliath as the Downtown Connection and was initially managed by Downtown Bruno.

=== Championship Wrestling from Florida (1988–1989)===

In September 1988, Ottman wrestled on the Gordon Solie-hosted TV shows of Championship Wrestling from Florida as a heel called Big Steel Man, managed by Diamond Dallas Page. He feuded with Dusty Rhodes, among others. He defeated Rhodes for the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship on May 13, 1989.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1989–1993) ===

====Tugboat (1989–1991)====
Ottman made his first appearance in the WWF in June 1989 in a dark match under the ring name &quot;Big Steel Man&quot; with Slick as his manager. He wrestled three more dark matches that summer, defeating Paul Roma and Boris Zukhov, and losing to Mr. Perfect. 

That September, his name was changed to &quot;Tugboat Tyler&quot;, then &quot;Tugboat Thomas&quot;, as he portrayed a fan favorite on house shows, defeating the likes of Barry Horowitz, The Brooklyn Brawler and Boris Zhukov. He debuted on WWF television on the January 27, 1990 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot; under the Tugboat Thomas moniker and defeated Iron Mike Sharpe. His ring name was soon after shortened to &quot;Tugboat&quot;. His costume consisted of a red striped shirt, white pants, and a sailor&#x27;s hat. Part of his gimmick included miming pulling the cord of an airhorn and making a &quot;Toot-toot&quot; noise, like a horn of a ship. On the May 20 episode of &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot;, Hulk Hogan made a promo explaining that he personally trained Tugboat and brought him to the WWF. Following Tugboat&#x27;s win on that very same show Hogan came out into the ring and raised his arm, showing his full support. Tugboat railed for fans to send encouraging letters to Hogan after Hogan was brutally attacked by Earthquake. Tugboat aided Hulk Hogan in his feud with Earthquake and &quot;Canada&#x27;s Strongest Man&quot; Dino Bravo. This coincided with a substantial push that saw Tugboat emerging victorious on television against numerous opponents. He made his pay-per-view debut at that November&#x27;s &quot;Survivor Series&quot;, where he teamed with Hogan, The Big Boss Man and Hacksaw Jim Duggan to face the team of Earthquake, Dino Bravo, Haku and The Barbarian. Tugboat was eliminated when he and Earthquake fought to a double count-out, and Hogan went on to be the sole survivor. Tugboat was the first true test of The Undertaker, who defeated him in numerous matches between December 1990 and March 1991. Tugboat received a shot at Mr. Perfect&#x27;s Intercontinental Championship on the May 5, 1991 episode of &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot;, but was unsuccessful.

====Natural Disasters (1991–1993)====

In May 1991, Ottman teased a heel turn by eliminating Hulk Hogan in a battle royal on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXIX&quot;. Ottman completed the turn on the June 15 episode of &quot;WWF Superstars&quot;. Tugboat and The Bushwhackers were facing The Nasty Boys and Earthquake in a six-man tag team match when Tugboat attacked his teammates, allowing Earthquake to hit the Earthquake Splash on Bushwhacker Luke and pin him. On the June 17 episode of &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot;, Earthquake&#x27;s manager, Jimmy Hart, reintroduced Ottman as Typhoon, and he and Earthquake became known as The Natural Disasters. As part of the character change, Ottman began wearing a red, white and black singlet with a tidal wave on the front and &quot;Typhoon&quot; in black letters under it (to match the design on Earthquake&#x27;s wrestling gear, seismograph lines and &quot;Earthquake&quot; in red letters across the middle).

The Natural Disasters dumped Hart and turned into fan favorites in early 1992 - with Ottman&#x27;s heel run having lasted less than seven months - feuding with Hart&#x27;s new top team, Money Inc. (&quot;Million Dollar Man&quot; Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster). On April 17 they won the SWS Tag Team Championship defeating George Takano and Shunji Takano in Yokohama, Japan when WWF had a partnership with Super World of Sports. In July the Natural Disasters defeated Money Inc. to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. They lost the title to Money Inc. three months later. After Earthquake took a leave of absence from the WWF early in 1993, Ottman wrestled in singles matches before leaving the company in early summer. He worked house shows against Terry Taylor in the spring. He also put over a returning Bam Bam Bigelow in a series of house shows, and twice on televised Raw shows. He wrestled two televised matches against Yokozuna, losing one by pinfall and winning the other by disqualification. His final match saw him defeat The Predator in a house show match in Tampa on July 18.

===World Championship Wrestling (1993–1994)===

====The Shockmaster (1993–1994)====
After departing from the WWF, Ottman found himself at the center of one of the most infamous moments in wrestling history as The Shockmaster. He had signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and was to make his debut in a match alongside the fan favorite team of Sting, Dustin Rhodes and Davey Boy Smith in the upcoming eight-man WarGames match against the heel team composed of Sid Vicious, Big Van Vader, Kane and Kole at Fall Brawl.

On &quot;A Flair for the Gold&quot;, an interview segment hosted by Ric Flair, in front of a live audience at &quot;Clash of the Champions XXIV&quot;, Sting and Smith were confronted by Sid and Harlem Heat, demanding to know the identity of their new partner. Sting exclaimed, &quot;All I have to say is, our partner is going to shock the world, because he is none other than the Shockmaster!&quot; The camera then zoomed in on a section of the set where two torches set off a small pyrotechnics explosion in front of a sheetrock wall. With a new costume consisting of a &quot;Star Wars&quot; Stormtrooper helmet painted purple and covered in silver glitter, a pair of jeans and a large, black, puffy vest, Ottman attempted to make a dramatic entrance by crashing through the wall.

While making his entrance, Ottman tripped over a piece of lumber that was framing the set, causing him to fall forward through the wall with his helmet falling off and sliding across the floor. His face accidentally exposed, he scrambled to put the helmet back on as Vicious, restraining laughter, exclaimed &quot;Oh, God!&quot;, while Flair could also be heard saying &quot;Oh no&quot; under his breath. Ottman donned the helmet and got back on his feet, shifting his weight and dusting his hands off in an attempt to shrug off the gaffe while Harlem Heat&#x27;s Kole asked, &quot;Who is this motherfucker?&quot; and Smith exclaimed &quot;He fell flat on his arse! He fell flat on his fucking arse!&quot;. Both of these comments were audible to the live audience and television viewers, but were bleeped in future showings of the footage by WWE. Ottman then began gesturing toward his would-be opponents several seconds before a menacing gravelly off-screen voice (provided by Ole Anderson, who could be heard laughing before speaking) started to threaten Sid and Vader. Sid Vicious, remaining in character, reacted in rage to Shockmaster, and the broadcast focused on Vicious for the duration of the voiceover. The announcers said nothing as the segment ended.

Dusty Rhodes later claimed, on an episode of WWE 24/7&#x27;s &quot;Legends of Wrestling&quot; show, the piece of lumber previously wasn&#x27;t there during a successful practice run and it was later put there by David Crockett without informing Ottman. WWE, on its official website, wrote, &quot;There is a case to be made that The Shockmaster&#x27;s debut at WCW &quot;Clash of the Champions XXIV&quot; is the greatest of all time – albeit for all the wrong reasons.&quot; The organization has also described the incident as &quot;one of the most unintentionally funny moments in sports entertainment history,&quot; and &quot;a debacle many still consider one of the worst gaffes in the history of sports-entertainment.&quot; While Ottman was initially displeased with the turn of events, he now finds humor in the incident.

Despite generating no crowd reaction, WCW tried to continue with the angle, repackaging The Shockmaster character as a klutz in a series of pre-recorded promos (featuring Ottman in different attire, without a mask and using his own voice). It was this version of the character that went on to appear as planned in the main event of Fall Brawl, teaming with Sting, Dustin Rhodes and Davey Boy Smith in the War Games match. His ring attire for his match was a plain white shirt, jeans and a white construction worker&#x27;s helmet, very different to the character in its infamous debut. He entered last into the match and actually gained the victory for his team by forcing Kole to submit to a bear hug.

This version of the character remained reasonably popular with live crowds and continued to appear at the final three pay-per-view events of the year. At Halloween Havoc he teamed up with Ice Train and Charlie Norris in a six man tag match against Harlem Heat (Kole and Kane) and The Equalizer. The Shockmaster again scored the victory for his team by pinning Kole. Next at Battlebowl he took part in the Lethal Lottery tournament and was drawn to team with Paul Orndorff to face the team of bitter rivals Ricky Steamboat and Lord Steven Regal. Steamboat and Regal imploded and Shockmaster was able to pick up the win for his team after Steamboat hit Regal. In the Battlebowl Final battle royal Shockmaster was eliminated around the half way point by the Nasty Boys. In the final pay-per-view of the year Starrcade he faced Awesome Kong (accompanied by King Kong). After both attacked the Shockmaster at the start of the match, bizarrely King Kong actually wrestled instead of his partner and the Shockmaster picked up a quick victory over him. He changed his name to &quot;The Super Shockmaster&quot; and departed in January 1994. He was also known as &quot;Uncle Fred&quot;. However, he did make a brief appearance on the March 12, 1994 episode of &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot;, when Mean Gene Okerlund visited the set of Hulk Hogan&#x27;s TV series &quot;Thunder in Paradise&quot;.

In 2009, Shawn Michaels, Triple H, and Dusty Rhodes appeared on a segment of &quot;WWE Raw&quot; to discuss the DVD release of &quot;The Rise and Fall of WCW&quot; when Triple H brought up the subject of the Shockmaster&#x27;s debut. During that segment, the WWE recreated the Shockmaster&#x27;s stumbling through the wall, with Santino Marella portraying the character and Arn Anderson providing the voice. Anderson fled from the camera when the other wrestlers pointed at him.

On February 22, 2016, Ottman returned as The Shockmaster for an episode of the WWE Network show, &quot;The Edge and Christian Show That Totally Reeks of Awesomeness&quot;. On the show, The Shockmaster was given the opportunity to redeem the famous debut incident by walking through the show&#x27;s banner.

===World Wrestling Federation (1994)===
Ottman returned to the WWF as Typhoon in May 1994, taking the place of his former partner Earthquake in house show matches against Yokozuna after Earthquake left the WWF. Typhoon made his return to television on the June 25 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot; (taped May 25), defeating Quebecer Pierre. He then primarily lost matches to Yokozuna on television and at house shows before departing in August.

===Late career (1994–2001)===
After leaving the WWF in August 1994, Ottman, still using the Typhoon name, began wrestling on the independent circuit in the East Coast. In December 1995, he went to Japan to compete in a one-night tag team tournament, held by WAR. He teamed up with Shinja and advanced to the semi-finals, before losing to Genichiro Tenryu and Ultimo Dragon. In March 1996, he wrestled a tour of Malaysia for the National Wrestling Alliance feuding with King Kong Bundy.

By the late 1990s, he was wrestling primarily in Florida, where he competed for FOW and WXO. In WXO, he was given the name The Dominator and his gimmick was that he was too big to get out of his own car. He lost to NWA World Heavyweight Champion Dan Severn on November 7, 1997 in Gainesville, Florida. On May 27, 2000 as Typhoon he defeated One Man Gang and Ron Harris in a 3 way match for Wrestling In Ashwaubenon independent show in Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin.

In 2000, he briefly appeared in the iGW promotion as a manager named Sugar Daddy.

Ottman was one of the participants in the 20-man Gimmick Battle Royal match at WrestleMania X-Seven as Tugboat, and was eliminated by his former partner, Earthquake. He retired soon thereafter.

===Return to wrestling (2009)===
On September 5, 2009, Ottman returned to the ring as Tugboat losing to Martin Nolte at DWA 10 years event in Uelzen, Germany. He returned to North America on November 21 as Tugboat defeating Jason Static at ECPW in New York City. He once again retired.

==Other media==
In 1992, he appeared as Typhoon (along with Earthquake) in the SNES version of the video game &quot;WWF Super WrestleMania&quot;. The Disasters were absent from the Sega version. On February 23, 2016, he appeared as downloadable content for &quot;WWE 2K16&quot;. He appears along with Earthquake in &quot;WWE 2K17 and WWE 2K18&quot; as well. In 2K18, the Shockmaster helmet (slightly modified as to avoid any copyright disputes with the Star Wars license) and the Typhoon singlet are available in the game&#x27;s attire creation suite, and can be worn by any character in the game.

On a two-part episode of the 1994 TV series &quot;Thunder in Paradise&quot;, Ottman played a palace guard named Yussef. He is also parodied in the 2014 RPG as Shocklord.

On a two-part episode of the 1998 TV series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Conquest&quot;, Ottman played Z&#x27;dak, in the second episode his name was featured solely in the credits though.

==Personal life==
Ottman retired from wrestling after WXO folded in 2001. In 2007 he lived in Lakeland, Florida and worked as a safety manager for Gaffin Industrial Services, a building cleaning service. He also coached the little league team of his two sons, Berkley and Beau, and daughter, Bailey. Berkley currently serves as the timekeeper for the WWE. He is the brother-in-law of pro wrestler Dusty Rhodes. He is one of the two uncles of Cody Rhodes and Dustin Rhodes, the other being Jerry Sags.

<text>The Shendan Expressway (pinyin: Shendan Gaosu Gonglu) links Shenyang in China&#x27;s Liaoning province with the border town of Dandong, sitting next to Sinŭiju in North Korea (DPRK).

The cities of Benxi, Nanfen, and Fenghuangcheng, as well as other localities, are located next to the expressway, heading slightly south-east.

A second expressway to Dandong is still partially under construction. This would run directly from Dalian and Zhuanghe.

<doc id="868735" wikidata="Q33670660" url="?curid=868735" title="African French">
<text>African French () is the generic name of the varieties of the French language spoken by an estimated 320 million people in Africa in 2023 or 67% of the French-speaking population of the world spread across 34 countries and territories. This includes those who speak French as a first or second language in these 34 African countries and territories (some of which are not Francophone, but merely non-Francophone members or observers of the &quot;Organisation internationale de la Francophonie&quot; or OIF), but it does not include French speakers living in other African countries. Africa is thus the continent with the most French speakers in the world, and African French speakers now form a large and integral part of the Francophonie.

In Africa, French is often spoken as a second language alongside the Indigenous ones, but in a small number of urban areas (in particular in Central Africa and in the ports located on the Gulf of Guinea) it has become a first language, such as in the region of Abidjan, Ivory Coast, the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the urban areas of Douala, Yaoundé in Cameroon, in Libreville, Gabon, and Antananarivo

In some countries, though not having official &quot;de jure&quot; status, it is a first language among some social classes of the population, such as in Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, and Mauritania, where French is a first language among the upper classes along with Arabic (many people in the upper classes are simultaneous bilinguals in Arabic/French), but only a second language among the general population.

In each of the Francophone African countries, French is spoken with local variations in pronunciation and vocabulary.

== List of countries in Africa by French proficiency ==
French proficiency in African countries according to the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF).

==Varieties==
There are many different varieties of African French, but they can be broadly grouped into five categories:

# The French variety spoken in Central Africa and West Africa – spoken altogether by about 97 million people in 2018, as either a first or second language.
# The French variety spoken by Berbers and Maghrebis in North-west Africa (see Maghreb French), which has about 33 million first and second language speakers in 2018.
# The French variety spoken in the Comoro Islands (the Comoros and Mayotte) and Madagascar, which have 5.6 million first and second language speakers in 2018.
# The French variety spoken by Creoles in the Mascarene Islands (Mauritius and Réunion) and Seychelles, which has around 1.75 million first and second language speakers in 2018. The French spoken in this region is not to be confused with the French-based creole languages, which are also spoken in the area.
# The French variety spoken in Djibouti in the Horn of Africa, which has about 0.5 million first and second language speakers in 2018.

All the African French varieties differ from Standard French, both in terms of pronunciation and vocabulary, but the formal African French used in education, media and legal documents is based on standard French vocabulary.

In the colonial period, a vernacular form of creole French known as &quot;Petit nègre&quot; (&quot;little negro&quot;) was also present in West Africa. The term has since, however, become a pejorative term for &quot;poorly spoken&quot; African French.

The difficulty linguists have in describing African French comes from variations, such as the &quot;pure&quot; language used by many African intellectuals and writers versus the mixtures between French and African languages. For this, the term &quot;creolization&quot; is used, often in a pejorative way, and especially in the areas where French is on the same level with one or more local languages. According to Gabriel Manessy, &quot;The consequences of this concurrency may vary according to the social status of the speakers, to their occupations, to their degree of acculturation and thus to the level of their French knowledge.&quot;

Code-switching, or the alternation of languages within a single conversation, takes place in both DR Congo and Senegal, the former having four &quot;national&quot; languages – Ciluba, Kikongo, Lingala, and Swahili – which are in a permanent opposition to French. Code-switching has been studied since colonial times by different institutions of linguistics. One of these, located in Dakar, Senegal, already spoke of the creolization of French in 1968, naming the result &quot;franlof&quot;: a mix of French and Wolof (the language most spoken in Senegal) which spreads by its use in urban areas and through schools, where teachers often speak Wolof in the classroom despite official instructions.

The omnipresence of local languages in Francophone African countries – along with insufficiencies in education – has given birth to a new linguistic concept: &quot;le petit français&quot;. &quot;Le petit français&quot; is the result of a superposition of the structure of a local language with a narrowed lexical knowledge of French. The specific structures, though very different, are juxtaposed, marking the beginning of the creolization process.

Some African countries such as Algeria intermittently attempted to remove the use of French; it was removed as an official language in Mali and Burkina Faso in 2023 and 2024 respectevely.]

== Français populaire africain ==
In the urban areas of Francophone Africa, another type of French has emerged: &quot;Français populaire africain&quot; (&quot;Popular African French&quot;) or FPA. It is used in the entirety of Sub-Saharan Africa, but especially in cities such as Abidjan, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire; Cotonou, Benin; Dakar, Senegal; Lomé, Togo; and Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. At its emergence, it was marginalized and associated with the ghetto; Angèle Bassolé-Ouedraogo describes the reaction of the scholars:

However, FPA has begun to emerge as a second language among the upper class. It has also become a symbol of social acceptance.

FPA can be seen as a progressive evolution of Ivorian French. After diffusing out of Ivory Coast, it became Africanized under the influence of young Africans (often students) and cinema, drama, and dance.

FPA has its own grammatical rules and lexicon. For example, &quot; or &quot; can either mean &quot;This person annoys me very much (literally he or she is annoying me to death)&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m dying (out of love) for him/her&quot; depending on the circumstances. &quot;&quot; signifies a feeling of exasperation (whereupon it actually means &quot;he or she starts to appeal to me&quot;), and friendship can be expressed with &quot; or &quot;

FPA is mainly composed of metaphors and images taken from African languages. For example, the upper social class is called &quot; (the above from above) or &quot; (the powerful môgôs).

=== Pronunciation ===
Pronunciation in the many varieties of African French can be quite varied. There are nonetheless some trends among African French speakers; for instance,  tends to be pronounced as the historic alveolar trill of pre-20th Century French instead of the now standard uvular trill or &#x27;guttural R.&#x27; The voiced velar fricative, the sound represented by in the Arabic word , is another common alternative. Pronunciation of the letters , , and may also vary, and intonation may differ from standard French.

== Abidjan French ==

According to some estimates, French is spoken by 75 to 99 percent of Abidjan&#x27;s population, either alone or alongside indigenous African languages. There are three sorts of French spoken in Abidjan. A formal French is spoken by the educated classes. Most of the population, however, speaks a colloquial form of French known as &quot;français de Treichville&quot; (after a working-class district of Abidjan) or &quot;français de Moussa&quot; (after a character in chronicles published by the magazine &quot;Ivoire Dimanche&quot; which are written in this colloquial Abidjan French). Finally, an Abidjan French slang called Nouchi has evolved from an ethnically neutral lingua franca among uneducated youth into a creole language with a distinct grammar. New words often appear in &quot;Nouchi&quot; and then make their way into colloquial Abidjan French after some time. As of 2012, a crowdsourced dictionary of &quot;Nouchi&quot; was being written using mobile phones.

Here are some examples of words used in the African French variety spoken in Abidjan (the spelling used here conforms to French orthography, except ô which is pronounced ):
* is a slang word meaning a girl or a girlfriend. It is a loanword either from the Mandinka language or from English (&quot;girl&quot;). It is also French hip-hop slang for a girl.
* is a colloquial word meaning a street-side eatery, a working-class restaurant serving African food (likely from French “”).
* is a slang word equivalent to &quot;bloke&quot; or &quot;dude&quot; in English. It is a loanword from the Mandinka language.
* is a word meaning to whip, to beat, or to chastise (children). It is a loanword from Portuguese where it meant &quot;to whip&quot;. It has now entered the formal language of the educated classes.
* is a slang word meaning money. It comes perhaps from the standard French word (&quot;coin&quot;) or (&quot;stone&quot;), or perhaps (dollar, buck).
When speaking in a formal context, or when meeting French speakers from outside Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Abidjan speakers would replace these local words with the French standard words , or , , &quot;battre&quot; and &quot;l&#x27;argent&quot; respectively. Note that some local words are used across several African countries. For example, is attested not only in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire but also in Senegal, Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Chad, the Central African Republic, Benin, Togo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

As already mentioned, these local words range from slang to formal usage, and their use therefore varies depending on the context. In Abidjan, this is how the sentence &quot;The girl stole my money.&quot; is constructed depending on the register:
*formal Abidjan French of the educated people: 
*colloquial Abidjan French (): (in standard French, the grammatically correct sentence should be )
*Abidjan French slang (&quot;Nouchi&quot;): ( is an Abidjan slang word meaning &quot;to steal&quot;)
Another unique, identifiable feature of Ivorian French is the use of the phrase &quot;n&#x27;avoir qu&#x27;à + infinitif&quot; which, translated into English, roughly means, &quot;to have only to + infinitive&quot;. The phrase is often used in linguistic contexts of expressing a wish or creating hypotheticals. This original Ivorian phrase is generally used across the Ivory Coast&#x27;s population; children, uneducated adults, and educated adults all using the phrase relatively equally. Often in written speech, the phrase is written as &quot;Ils non cas essayer de voir&quot; rather than &quot;Ils n&#x27;ont qu&#x27;à essayer de voir&quot;.

=== Characteristics ===
Many characteristics of Ivorian/Abidjan French differ from &quot;standard&quot; French found in France. Many of the linguistic evolutions are from the influences of native African languages spoken within the Ivory Coast and make Abidjan French a distinct dialect of French. 

Some of the major phonetic and phonological variations of Abidjan French, as compared to a more &quot;typical&quot; French, include substituting the nasal low vowel [ɑ̃] for a non-nasal [a], especially when the sound occurs at the beginning of a word, and some difficulty with the full production of the phonemes [ʒ] and [ʃ]. There are also, to a certain degree, rhythmic speaking patterns in Ivorian French that are influenced by native languages.

Ivorian French is also unique in its grammatical differences present in spoken speech such as these:

* omission of articles in some contexts (&quot;tu veux poisson&quot; instead of the French &quot;tu veux du poisson&quot;)
* omission of prepositions in some contexts (&quot;Il parti Yamoussoukro&quot; rather than &quot;Il est parti à Yamoussoukro&quot;)
* interchangeable usage of indirect and direct objects (using &quot;lui&quot; instead of &quot;le&quot; and vice versa)
* more flexible grammatical formation

== Algerian French ==
Without being an official language, French is frequently used in government, workplaces, and education. French is the default language for work in several sectors. In a 2007 study set in the city of Mostaganem, it was shown that French and Arabic were the two functional languages of banking. Technical work (accounting, financial analysis, management) is also frequently done in French. Documents, forms, and posters are often in both French and Arabic.

The usage of French among the Algerian population is different depending on social situations. One can find:

* direct borrowings, where the lexical unit is unchanged: &quot;surtout&quot; (particularly), &quot;voiture&quot; (car)
* integrated borrowings, where the lexical unit experiences phonetic transformation: &quot;gendarme&quot; (police force), &quot;cinéma&quot; (cinema)
* code switching, where another language is spoken in addition to French in a single oration (ex: Berber/French, Arabic/French)

== Beninese French ==
French is the sole official language in Benin. In 2014, over 4 million Beninese citizens spoke French (around 40% of the population). Fongbe is the other widely spoken language of Benin. It is natural to hear both languages blending, either through loan words or code-switching. 

Few academic sources exist surrounding the particularisms of Beninese French. Nevertheless, it is evident that Beninese French has adapted the meanings of several French terms over time, such as: &quot;seconder&quot; (to have relations with a second woman, from the French &quot;second -&quot; second), &quot;doigter&quot; (to show the way, from the French &quot;doigt&quot; - finger).

==Burkinabe French==
French is the language of administration, education, and business in Burkina Faso and was the &quot;de jure&quot; official language until a constitutional change in 2024. While spoken fluently only by about a quarter of the population, French has progressively become a native language among urban populations since the late 20th century, notably in the cities of Ouagadougou, Bobo-Dioulasso, and Banfora. By 2010, about 10% of Ouagadougou residents spoke French as their first language. 

Linguists have observed the development of a local vernacular of French in the country called français populaire burkinabè which is influenced by local languages such as Mooré and is used as a lingua franca in commerce. It is largely used as a spoken language whereas speakers continue to use standard French as the written language.
==Cameronian French==
== Kinshasa French ==
With more than 11 million inhabitants, Kinshasa is the largest Francophone city in the world, surpassing Paris in population. It is the capital of the most populous francophone country in the world, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where an estimated 43 million people (51% of the total population) can speak French (essentially as a second language). Contrary to Abidjan where French is the first language of a large part of the population, in Kinshasa French is only a second language, and its status of &quot;lingua franca&quot; is shared with Lingala. Kinshasa French also differs from other African French variants, for it has some Belgian French influences, due to colonization. People of different African mother tongues living in Kinshasa usually speak Lingala to communicate with each other in the street, but French is the language of businesses, administrations, schools, newspapers and televisions. French is also the predominant written language.

Due to its widespread presence in Kinshasa, French has become a local language with its own pronunciation and some local words borrowed for the most part from Lingala. Depending on their social status, some people may mix French and Lingala, or code switch between the two depending on the context. Here are examples of words particular to Kinshasa French. As in Abidjan, there exist various registers and the most educated people may frown upon the use of slangish/Lingala terms.

* means broken, worn out, exhausted, or dead. It is a neologism on the standard French word whose meaning in standard French is &quot;corpse&quot;. The word has now spread to other African countries due to the popularity of Congolese music in Africa.
* means strong, resistant. It is a loanword from Lingala.
* are sunglasses worn by partiers at night. It is a word coined locally and whose literal meaning in standard French is &quot;anti-night&quot;. It is one of the many Kinshasa slang words related to nightlife and partying. A reveler is known locally as , from standard French which means atmosphere.
*, literally &quot;to break the Bic&quot;, means to stop going to school. is colloquially used to refer to a ballpoint pen in Belgian French and Kinshasa French, but not in standard French.
* means &quot;thank you very much&quot;. It comes from standard French (&quot;thank you&quot;) and Lingala (&quot;a lot&quot;).
* is a bottle opener. It comes from the Lingala verb which means &quot;to open something that is blocked up or bottled&quot;, to which was added the standard French suffix .
* is a rickety old taxi. In standard French means &quot;tetanus&quot;.
* means &quot;absolutely impossible&quot;. It comes from (&quot;there&#x27;s no way&quot;), itself made up of standard French (&quot;way&quot;) and Lingala (&quot;not&quot;, &quot;no&quot;), to which was added standard French (&quot;really&quot;).
* means to have a mistress. doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;He has two offices&quot;, but &quot;He has two mistresses&quot;.
* means &quot;fend for yourself&quot; or &quot;find what you need by yourself&quot;. 
* means &quot;thank you&quot; or &quot;you are welcome&quot;. When it means &quot;thank you&quot;, it can offend some French speakers who are not aware of its special meaning in Kinshasa. For example, if one offers a present to a person, they will often reply . In standard French, it means &quot;I don&#x27;t mind&quot;.
* is the way Kinois say 81, in Europe. 
*, literally to make things &quot;complicated&quot; or difficult for someone. It can be anyone: , &quot;She is giving me a tough time&quot;.
* is something someone does to make another person&#x27;s life harder, and often refers to policemen or soldiers. A fine is often called a , especially because the policemen in Kinshasa usually ask for an unpayable sum of money that requires extensive bargaining.

=== Characteristics ===
There are many linguistic differences that occur in Kinshasa French that make it a distinct dialect of French. Similarly to many other African dialects of French, many of the linguistic aspects are influenced, either directly or indirectly, by the linguistics of the local African languages. It is also essential to note that grammatical differences between local Congolese languages and the French language, such as the lack of gendered nouns in the former, result in linguistic changes when speakers of the former speak French.

Here are some of the phonetic characteristics of Kinshasa French:

* the posteriorization of anterior labial vowels in French, more specifically, the posteriorization of the common French phoneme [ɥ] for [u] (ex: pronunciation of the French word &quot;cuisine&quot; [kɥizin] as &quot;couwisine&quot; [kuwizin])
* the delabialization of the phoneme [y] for the phoneme [i] (ex: pronunciation of the French term &quot;bureau&quot; [byʁo] as &quot;biro&quot; [biʁo])
* the vocalic opening of the French phoneme [œ] creating, instead, the phoneme [ɛ] (ex: pronunciation of the French word &quot;acteur&quot; [aktœʁ] as actère [aktɛʁ])
* in some cases, the denasalization of French vowels (ex: pronunciation of the French term &quot;bande&quot; [bɑ̃d] as ba-nde [band])
* the mid-nasalization of occlusive consonants that follow the nasals [n] and [m] (ex: in relationship to the example above, the French word &quot;bande&quot; [bɑ̃d] could be pronounced both as ba-nde [band] or as ban-nde with a slightly nasalized [d])
* the palatalization of French apico-dental consonants that are followed by [i] and/or [ɥ] (ex: pronunciation of the French word &quot;dix&quot; [dis] is pronounced as &quot;dzix&quot; [dzis] and, similarly, the term &quot;parti&quot; may be pronounced as &quot;partsi)&quot;

As briefly mentioned above, many Congolese languages are ungendered languages and so there is often some mixing of the French masculine and feminine articles in speakers of Kinshasa French, such as the phrase &quot;Je veux du banane&quot; rather than the &quot;correct&quot; French &quot;Je veux de la banane&quot;.

<text>The Burgundian School was a group of composers active in the 15th century in what is now northern and eastern France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, centered on the court of the Dukes of Burgundy. The school inaugurated the music of Burgundy.

The main names associated with this school are Guillaume Dufay, Gilles Binchois, Antoine Busnois and (as an influence), the English composer John Dunstaple. The Burgundian School was the first phase of activity of the Franco-Flemish School, the central musical practice of the Renaissance in Europe.

==Background==

In late Medieval and early Renaissance Europe, cultural centers tended to move from one place to another due to changing political stability and the presence of either the spiritual or temporal power, for instance the Pope, Anti-pope or the Holy Roman Emperor. In the 14th century, the main centers of musical activity were northern France, Avignon, and Italy, as represented by Guillaume de Machaut and the &quot;ars nova&quot;, the &quot;ars subtilior&quot;, and Landini respectively; Avignon had a brief but important cultural flowering because it was the location of the Papacy during the Western Schism. When France was ravaged by the Hundred Years&#x27; War (1337–1453), the cultural center migrated farther east, to towns in Burgundy and the Low Countries, known then collectively as the Netherlands.

During the reign of the House of Valois, Burgundy was the most powerful and stable political division in western Europe, and added, a bit at a time, Flanders, Brabant, Holland, Luxembourg, Alsace and Lorraine. Especially during the reigns of Philip the Good (1419–1467) and Charles the Bold (1467–1477), this entire area, loosely known as Burgundy, was a center of musical creativity. Most of the musical activity did not take place in what is modern-day Burgundy, which has its capital in Dijon (even though the Dukes of Burgundy maintained an administrative center there). The main centers of music-making were Brussels, Bruges, Lille, and Arras, as well as smaller towns in that same general area.

Musicians from the region came to Burgundy to study and further their own careers as the reputation of the area spread. The Burgundian rulers were not merely patrons of the arts, but took an active part: Charles the Bold himself played the harp, and composed chansons and motets (although none have survived with reliable attribution). The worldly dukes also encouraged the composition of secular music to a degree seen only rarely before in European music history, a characteristic which itself defines the Burgundian epoch as a Renaissance phenomenon.

This migration of musical culture east from Paris to Burgundy also corresponds with the conventional (and by no means universally accepted) division of music history into Medieval and Renaissance; while Guillaume de Machaut is often considered to be one of the last Medieval composers, Dufay is often considered to be the first significant Renaissance composer.

Charles the Bold was killed in 1477 in the Battle of Nancy, during one of his attempts to add territory to his empire. After his death, music continued to flourish as before, but the region was split politically, with the duchy of Burgundy being absorbed into France, and most of the Low Countries becoming part of the holdings of the Spanish Habsburgs. Both the French court and the Habsburgs were patrons of music; however, a French style began to diverge from that of the Low Countries, especially in secular music, and in the period after 1500.

==Composers==

The history of Burgundian music began with the organization of the chapel in 1384; twenty years later, it rivaled the famous establishment at Avignon in splendor. Names associated with this early phase of Burgundian music include Johannes Tapissier and Nicolas Grenon, who carried the tradition across to the next phase of the chapel, when it was reorganized in 1415. Other early composers there were Hugo and Arnold de Lantins, both of whom Dufay later met in Italy.

Of all the names associated with the Burgundian School, the most famous was Guillaume Dufay, who was probably the most famous composer in Europe in the 15th century. He wrote music in many of the forms which were current, music which was melodic, singable and memorable (more than half of his sacred music consists of simple harmonizations of plainsong, for example). Contemporary with Dufay were composers such as Gilles Binchois, who was at the Burgundian court between approximately 1430 and 1460, and Hayne van Ghizeghem, a composer, singer and soldier who may have been killed in the last military campaign of Charles the Bold.

After the death of Dufay in 1474, the most prominent Burgundian musician was Antoine Busnois, who was also a prolific composer of chansons, and who possibly wrote the famous L&#x27;homme armé tune.

==Musical style and forms==
Burgundian composers favored secular forms, at least while they worked in Burgundian lands; much sacred music survives, especially from those composers who spent time in Italy, for example in the papal choir. The most prominent secular forms used by the Burgundians were the four &quot;formes fixes&quot; (rondeau, ballade, virelai, and bergerette), all generically known as chansons. Of the four, the rondeau was by far the most popular; at any rate more rondeaux have survived than any other form. Most of the rondeaux were in three voices, and in French, though there are a few in other languages. In most of the rondeaux, the uppermost voice (the &quot;superius&quot;) was texted, and the other voices were most likely played by instruments. The bergerette was developed by the Burgundians themselves; it was like a virelai, but shorter, having only one stanza.

Most of the composers also wrote sacred music in Latin; this was to remain true for the next several generations. They wrote both masses and motets, as well as cycles of Magnificats. During the period, the mass transformed from a group of individual sections written by different composers, often using a head-motif technique, to unified cycles based on a cantus firmus. Dufay, Binchois, Busnois, Reginald Liebert and others all wrote cyclic masses. One of the favorite tunes used as a cantus firmus was the renowned l&#x27;homme armé, which was set not only by the Burgundians but by composers of subsequent centuries; indeed it was the most common tune used as a basis for mass composition in all of music history, with more than forty surviving masses featuring the melody. David Fallows writes of it in the &quot;New Grove&quot;: &quot;It is hard to think of any other melody in the history of music that has yielded so much music of the highest quality.&quot;

During the period the motet transformed from the isorhythmic model of the 14th century to the smoothly polyphonic, sectional composition seen in the work of the later Burgundians such as Busnois. In the motets, as well as the masses and other sacred music, a common musical technique employed was fauxbourdon, a harmonization of an existing chant in parallel 6-3 chords, occasionally ornamented to prevent monotony. Composition using fauxbourdon allowed sung text to be clearly understood, but yet avoided the plainness of simple chant. Burgundian motets tended to be in Latin, written for three voices with the top voice being the most important. An example of a Burgundian motet is &quot;Quam pulchra es&quot;, written by Dunstaple in the early 15th century.

Instrumental music was also cultivated at the Burgundian courts, often for dancing. A peculiarity of the Burgundian instrumental style is that the dukes preferred music for loud instruments (trumpets, tambourins, shawms, bagpipes) and more of this survives than for other current instruments such as the lute or the harp. In contemporary practice, the loud instruments would usually play from an elevated location, such as a balcony, while the other instruments would play closer to the dancers.

Instrumental forms included the &quot;basse danse&quot;, or &quot;bassadanza&quot;, which was a ceremonial dance of a rather dignified character, and relatively slow tempo. Typically it was in a duple meter subdivided into threes (in modern notation, 6/8), and often the dance would be immediately followed by a quick dance, the &quot;tordion&quot; or &quot;pas de Brabant&quot;.

The Burgundian School was the first generation of what is sometimes known as the Netherlands School, several generations of composers spanning 150 years who composed in the polyphonic style associated with the mainstream of Renaissance practice. Later generations, which were no longer specifically associated with either the court or the region of Burgundy but were interlinked by adjacent geography and by common musical practice, included such names as Johannes Ockeghem, Jacob Obrecht, Josquin des Prez, Adrian Willaert and Orlandus Lassus.

==Manuscript sources==

There are approximately 65 manuscript sources which contain music by Burgundian composers. The most prominent of these include:

* Canonici Manuscript (containing music from around 1400 to 1440). This manuscript is at the Bodleian Library in Oxford, England; it is named after a previous owner, Matteo Luigi Canonici, an 18th-century Venetian Jesuit. It has 380 compositions in all, including works by 60 composers. Both sacred and secular music are well represented in this collection.
* Laborde Chansonnier (containing music mainly composed during the reign of Charles the Bold, 1467–1477). It is named after the Marquis de Laborde, and is presently at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC. It has 106 pieces of music in all.
* Mellon Chansonnier (containing music from approximately 1440 to 1477). It is named after Paul Mellon, who gave it to Yale University; currently it is in the Beinecke Library there. It has 57 compositions, and includes some non-Burgundian music as well (for example, works by contemporary English and Italian composers)
* Dijon Chansonnier (containing music from approximately 1470 to 1475). Some of the music is by composers not normally associated with the Burgundian school, such as Ockeghem, Loyset Compère, and Johannes Tinctoris. It is at the public library in Dijon, and contains 161 pieces of music in all.
* El Escorial Chansonnier (containing music from about 1430 to 1445). It is in the Biblioteca del Monasterio, El Escorial, V.III.24, and is commonly referred to as EscA. It contains a total of 62 compositions, only one of which is attributed (to Gilles Binchois), although many of the rest have been assigned to Binchois, Dunstaple, Dufay, and others, on stylistic grounds.

<text>Te Ringa Mangu Netana &quot;Dun&quot; Mihaka (1942 – 22 August 2023) was a New Zealand Māori activist, author, and political candidate.

==Early life and family==
Mihaka was born at Te Ahuahu in 1942 and was affiliated with the Ngāpuhi iwi. The son of Te Aroha and Hone Mihaka and a descendant of Ruatara, he attended Te Ahuahu Māori School and Northland College, later working as a labourer and joining the army.

Mihaka was the uncle of Peeni Henare.

==Activism==
Mihaka was involved in a number of campaigns regarding Māori rights, including the Bastion Point land dispute. His 1979 attempts to use the Māori language in court were appealed to the Court of Appeal and were the trigger for the 1986 Waitangi Tribunal ruling that the government should introduce legislation making it an official language of New Zealand. He wrote two books on Māori issues. He is most known, however, for performing an act of &quot;whakapohane&quot; (baring his buttocks, a traditional Māori insult) to Diana, Princess of Wales and Charles, Prince of Wales in 1983. Some sources claim this was actually directed at the Queen herself; however, this is likely confused with a later incident in 1986 in which Mihaka was arrested for driving a van with an image of &quot;whakapohane&quot; in the vicinity of a royal motorcade. On that occasion, he was charged with dangerous driving.

In 2010, Mihaka was sentenced to 28 days in jail for contempt of court for calling a District Court judge an &quot;arsehole&quot; in open court.

== New Zealand election campaigns ==
Mihaka stood as an independent candidate in the Southern Maori electorate in the , , , and s. He either came last or second to last, with Whetu Tirikatene-Sullivan holding the electorate during that time. He then stood as an independent candidate for the Te Tai Tokerau electorate in the 1999 election, winning 1.03% of the vote. In 2004, he stood in the Te Tai Hauauru by-election, challenging the incumbent Tariana Turia. Mihaka stood as the candidate for the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party, the only party other than Turia&#x27;s Māori Party to contest the by-election. Mihaka claimed that the drugs issue was of greater importance to Māori than the foreshore and seabed controversy, which Turia largely focused on. In the by-election, Mihaka placed a distant second, winning 2.52% of the vote compared to Turia&#x27;s 92.74%. He did, however, place above the four independent candidates.

==Death==
Mihaka died on 22 August 2023, at the age of 81. His body was taken from Wellington to Parawhenua Marae, between Ōhaeawai and Lake Ōmāpere in Northland, for his tangihanga.

<doc id="868742" wikidata="Q4798251" url="?curid=868742" title="Arthur Chichester, 1st Earl of Donegall">
<text>Arthur Chichester, 1st Earl of Donegall (16 June 1606 – 18 March 1675), was an Anglo-Irish military officer, politician and peer.

==Origins==
He was the eldest son and heir of the 1st Viscount Chichester, from Eggesford, Devon, by his first wife Anne Copleston, heiress of Eggesford.

==Career==
He made a career as a soldier before being elected to the Irish House of Commons as Member of Parliament for Antrim in 1634 and again in 1640. Having distinguished himself in helping to put down the rebellion which took place in Ulster in 1641, Chichester was admitted to the Privy Council of Ireland in 1643. It was on the advice of James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, that in 1647 he was created Earl of Donegall in the Peerage of Ireland. The earldom was created with a special remainder to the male heirs of his father, whom he succeeded a year later as Viscount Chichester and Governor of Carrickfergus for life. He took his seat in the Irish House of Lords in 1661. In 1668 he endowed a mathematical lectureship at Trinity College Dublin with an annuity of 30 livre (pounds), which lectureship survives as an annual public lecture at the School of Mathematics in Trinity College.

==Marriages and children==
He married three times: 
*Firstly to Dorcas Hill (1607–1630), a daughter of John Hill of Honiley, Warwickshire (whose arms are shown on her monument in Eggesford Church: &quot;Sable, six talbot hounds argent, 3,2,1&quot;), by whom he had one daughter:
**Mary Chichester, wife of John St Leger and mother of Arthur St Leger, 1st Viscount Doneraile (died 1727). 
*Secondly to Lady Mary Digby (died 1648), daughter of John Digby, 1st Earl of Bristol (whose arms are shown on her monument in Eggesford Church: &quot;Azure, a fleur de lys argent&quot;), by whom he had eight children all of whom died young.
*Thirdly in 1651 he married Letitia Hicks, daughter of Sir William Hicks, 1st Baronet, by whom he had surviving children one son and one daughter, four other daughters having died young:
**William Chichester (died 1660)
**Anne Chichester (died 1697) who married firstly John Butler, 1st Earl of Gowran, and secondly Francis Aungier, 1st Earl of Longford.

==Death and burial==
Lord Donegall died after a short illness in Belfast in 1675 and was buried in St Nicholas&#x27;s Church, Carrickfergus.

==Succession==
As all his sons had died young, the earldom passed under the remainder to his nephew Arthur Chichester.

<text>Virginia Bruce (born Helen Virginia Briggs; September 29, 1910 – February 24, 1982) was an American actress and singer.

==Early life==
Bruce was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. As an infant she moved with her parents, Earil and Margaret Briggs, to Fargo, North Dakota. The city directory of Fargo documents that the Briggs family lived there at 421 14th Street South. After Bruce graduated from Fargo Central High School in 1928, she moved with her family to Los Angeles intending to enroll at the University of California, Los Angeles when a friendly wager sent her seeking film work.

==Career==
Bruce&#x27;s first screen work was in 1929 as an extra for Paramount in &quot;Why Bring That Up?&quot; In 1930, she appeared on Broadway in the musical &quot;Smiles&quot; at the Ziegfeld Theatre, followed by the Broadway production &quot;America&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; in 1931.

Bruce returned to Hollywood in 1932, where she began work in early August at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on the film &quot;Kongo&quot; starring Walter Huston. During production on that project, on August 10, she married John Gilbert (her first, his fourth) with whom she recently costarred in &quot;Downstairs&quot;. &quot;The Film Daily&quot; reported that the couple&#x27;s &quot;quick&quot; wedding was held in Gilbert&#x27;s dressing room on the studio lot. Among the people attending the small ceremony were the head of MGM production Irving Thalberg, who served as the groom&#x27;s best man; screenwriter Donald Ogden Stewart, whose wife Beatrice acted as matron of honor; MGM art director and set designer Cedric Gibbons; and his wife, actress Dolores del Río.

Bruce retired briefly from acting after the birth of their daughter Susan Ann, although she returned to film appearances after her divorce from Gilbert (caused by his alcoholism) in May 1934. Gilbert died of a heart attack in 1936.
Bruce is credited with introducing the Cole Porter standard &quot;I&#x27;ve Got You Under My Skin&quot; in the 1936 film &quot;Born to Dance&quot;. The same year, she costarred in the MGM musical &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot;. She also performed periodically on radio. In 1949, for example, Bruce starred in &quot;Make Believe Town&quot;, a 30-minute afternoon drama broadcast daily on CBS Radio. In the early 1960s, she retired from films.

==Personal life==

Bruce married American film director J. Walter Ruben in 1937.

Bruce was a Democrat who supported the campaign of Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election.

Bruce died of cancer at age 71 on February 24, 1982, at the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California.

<text>Cypress Gardens was a botanical garden and theme park near Winter Haven, Florida that operated from 1936 to 2009. As of 2011, the botanical garden portion had been preserved inside the newly formed Legoland Florida.

==History==
Billed as Florida&#x27;s first commercial tourist theme park, Cypress Gardens opened on January 2, 1936, as a botanical garden planted by Dick Pope Sr. and his wife Julie. Over the years it became one of the biggest attractions in Florida, known for its water ski shows, gardens, and Southern Belles.

It became known as the &quot;Water Ski Capital of the World&quot; because it was the site of many of the sport&#x27;s landmark firsts and over 50 world records were broken there. During World War II, soldiers visited and waterskiing was introduced for their entertainment. Numerous movies were filmed at the park, including portions of &quot;This is Cinerama&quot;, the first feature filmed in the wide-screen format, and a string of Esther Williams films and TV specials in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1950s the Southern Belles attraction was introduced, in which young women dressed in the crinolines reminiscent of the Antebellum South. During the 1961-1965 American Civil War Centennial young men dressed in Confederate uniforms would be photographed with the Southern Belles. In the early 1960s a custom photography boat named &quot;Miss Cover Girl&quot; was introduced, and the park became a popular site for the filming of television commercials.

Many celebrities and dignitaries have skied and visited at the park, including Elvis Presley, King Hussein of Jordan and his son and successor, King Abdullah II. It was also the site of a Johnny Carson special.

On April 14, 2014, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

===Competitions and changes of ownership===
Competition for guests increased after Walt Disney World Resort opened nearby in 1971. In the early 1980s, the Popes retired and transferred the park to their son, Dick Pope, Jr.

In 1985 book publisher Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich purchased the park to build their SeaWorld parks group. Harcourt sold the other businesses to Anheuser-Busch in 1989. Busch continued to operate Cypress Gardens until April 1, 1995, when a group of the park&#x27;s managers, led by Bill Reynolds, bought the property.
Under President and CEO Reynolds, the park operated until April 13, 2003, when it closed after a prolonged tourism decline following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. 529 people were put out of work with three days&#x27; notice.

===Cypress Gardens Adventure Park===
On February 22, 2004, Adventure Parks Group, owned by Kent Buescher, purchased the property and renamed it Cypress Gardens Adventure Park. The purchase of the amusement park portion of the Cypress Gardens property was part of a larger conservation transaction. In that transaction, the entire site was purchased from its previous owner, First Gardens, L.C., by The Trust for Public Land, a national conservation organization. TPL then sold a conservation easement over the entire property to the state of Florida, while Polk County purchased the gardens portion of the property, less the development rights conveyed in the state easement. Adventure Parks Group purchased the balance of the property, also subject to the conservation easement.

Buescher&#x27;s plan to reopen the park in September 2004 was delayed by damage from hurricanes Charley, Frances, and Jeanne. Cypress Gardens Adventure Park finally opened in November 2004. One of its new attractions, the &quot;Triple Hurricane&quot; roller coaster, was named for the tumultuous storm season. The adjacent Splash Island water park opened in 2005, along with the &quot;Galaxy Spin&quot; roller coaster.

On May 18, 2006, scenes for the film &quot;Grace Is Gone&quot;, starring John Cusack, were shot at Cypress Gardens. In the film, a man delays telling his daughters that their mother has been killed in the Iraq War by taking them to &quot;Enchanted Gardens&quot;, their favorite theme park.

In September 2006, Adventure Parks Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at the Florida site citing approximately $30 million in damages sustained from the 2004 hurricanes.

Land South Adventures, a subsidiary of Mulberry, Florida-based Land South Holdings, purchased Cypress Gardens at a bankruptcy auction on October 16, 2007, for $16.9 million, leaving Buescher as interim manager until Baker Leisure Group of Orlando, Florida, took over park operations in January 2008.

On Monday, November 10, 2008, Land South Holdings announced the temporary closure of the park, which was shut down November 17 of that year. It reopened on March 28, 2009, with an expanded water park named Splash Island. The animals, however, were gone, and the rides did not operate or had already been removed. Cypress Gardens and Splash Island began separate ticketing, with dual-park season passes also available; parking was free.

On September 23, 2009, owner Land South Holdings LLC announced that the park was closing immediately, saying that all avenues to keep the park open had been explored but that they were unable to find a way to &quot;keep the park running in its traditional form&quot;.

===Legoland acquisition===

On January 15, 2010, the world&#x27;s second largest theme park and attraction operator Merlin Entertainments bought Cypress Gardens with intent to use the site for the fifth Legoland. On January 21, 2010, Merlin Entertainments announced that the park would be turned into Legoland Florida. On October 21, 2010, an October 2011 opening date was announced. Opening day occurred on October 15, 2011, at 10 am EDT.

<text>Wild Adventures (formerly known as Liberty Farms) is a zoological theme park located in Clyattville, Georgia, south of Valdosta, Georgia. The park is owned by Herschend Family Entertainment and has been managed by Jon Vigue since October 2020. Wild Adventures has rides, exotic animals, the Splash Island water park, and live shows.

== History ==
Kent Buescher and his wife Dawn Buescher founded the park on a plot of farmland outside of Valdosta, Georgia. It was established in 1996 for around $10 million. Wild Adventures started as a small petting zoo known as Liberty Farms D&amp;L (Distribution &amp; Logistics ). The park now hosts six roller coasters and numerous flat rides. Rides were initially added to the park in 1998. Splash Island, the park&#x27;s water park, opened in 2003 as the park&#x27;s largest expansion which features a 100-meter drop double slide.

In 2004, the Adventure Park Group purchased Cypress Gardens in Winter Haven, Florida, a company that Buescher privately held. The expansion of the park was slowed down following the purchase of Cypress Gardens. In 2005, an S&amp;S Power Screamin&#x27; Swing named Gauntlet was added. For the park&#x27;s 10th anniversary in 2006, the park announced its intent to add the Shaka Zulu River Adventure log flume, relocated from the defunct Miracle Strip Amusement Park in Panama City Beach, Florida. However, the ride was delayed due to engineering problems and was later canceled.

In September 2006, Adventure Parks Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On September 25, 2007, due to bankruptcy proceedings, Adventure Parks Group LLC auctioned off Cypress Gardens and Wild Adventures. Despite the Chapter 11 filing, the parks remained open for operation. The initial bids were set at $17.4 million for Cypress Gardens and $38.85 million for Wild Adventures, with a combined starting point of $53.25 million. The group&#x27;s situation only worsened after hurricanes Charley, Frances, and Jeanne damaged Cypress Gardens in 2004. Herschend Family Entertainment later purchased Wild Adventures for $34.4 million.

Herschend removed the Gauntlet but opened The Rattler on March 21, 2008. It is a Huss Frisbee-type flat ride manufactured by Moser Rides of Italy. Also in 2008, the Tiger Terror roller coaster was sold and moved to Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa, Florida, and renamed &quot;Tasmanian Tiger&quot;. In February 2009, the movie &quot;Zombieland&quot; was filmed at Wild Adventures for its theme park scenes.

For the 2010 season, the park added several rides including Viking Voyage, Whirling Wildcats, and Falcon Flyers. All three rides were from the now defunct Celebration City in Branson, Missouri. The Attractions, Gold Rush, and Mystery Maze were removed. Bug Out was renamed Go Bananas. The S&amp;S Double Shot was renamed Firecracker. Two new rides, Tailspin, and Wacky Wheels were added before the 2013 season. In 2015, Jungle Rumble, a flat ride, was also added.

Before the 2019 season, Fiesta Express was moved out of storage and was renamed Swamp-water Snake and the S&amp;S Double-shot was renamed Blazer Blast for a new children-themed area called Discovery Outpost. After the 2019 season, Viking Voyage was moved to Fun Spot Kissimmee. Beginning in the 2020 season, Blackfoot Falls was renovated and renamed Island Falls, and the Pharaoh&#x27;s Fury was moved to another zone of the park after the closure of surrounding rides. Wild Adventures was shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, later reopening in July 2020. In early 2021, it was announced that the park&#x27;s CCI wooden coaster Cheetah would be retired after its closure in the 2020 season, as well as the park&#x27;s go-karts and mini-golf course.

For the 2022 season, the Falcon Flyers were renamed the American Flyers and received a new paint job. The restaurant Brews and Bites began selling alcoholic beverages and added covered seating and a live concert area. At the end of the season, the Yo-Yo ride was removed from the park. In 2023, the Go Bananas roller coaster was renamed to Marsh Mayhem, and the Sidewinder flat ride was renamed Sandstorm Chaser and moved to the new Oasis Outpost-themed area of the park.

==Sections==
In 2019, the park created Discovery Outpost, a new children&#x27;s section, using old rides that were repainted and renovated to match the theme of the area. Oasis Outpost was added for the 2023 season with two rides being moved to this new section – the Sidewinder was renamed the Sandstorm Chaser and the Trail Trackers. Past themes included Base Camp, Bugsville, Australian Outback, Alapaha Preserve, The Lagoon, African Pride-lands, and Wild West.

==Splash Island Water Park==

Splash Island is a Polynesian-themed water park that is free with admission to Wild Adventures. It takes up of the park and hosts seven rides and five shops. It is frequently the most crowded area of the park. Splash Island first opened in 2003 and was Wild Adventures&#x27; largest expansion since rides were introduced in 1999.

When Splash Island was opened, it had no theming and more closely resembled a community pool. In 2008, Wild Adventures announced that Splash Island would undergo a $4 million renovation to turn the park into a Polynesian-themed paradise. Wild Adventures also announced their intent to build a new ride, the Wahee Cyclone.

<text>Tommy Ivo (born April 18, 1936), also known as &quot;TV Tommy&quot; and &quot;Instant Ivo&quot; is an American actor and drag racer, who was active in the 1960s racing community.

==Acting==
Ivo was born in Denver, Colorado. His acting career began in the early 1940s, with notable performances including Cousin Arne in &quot;I Remember Mama&quot; (1948), Joey in &quot;Prejudice&quot; (1949), David in &quot;The Lost Volcano&quot; with Johnny Sheffield. and William Button in &quot;Plymouth Adventure&quot; (1952). 

In 1955 Ivo appeared as Shelby in the &quot;Heart of a Cheater&quot; episode of the &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; TV show. He also appeared in &quot;Make Room for Daddy&quot; as daughter Terry&#x27;s boyfriend Walter in &quot;Terry Goes Steady&quot; in 1958. The teenage Hot Rod film entitled Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow (1959), features a brief appearance of Tommy Ivo as a dragster racer and race car builder. From 1959 to 1961, Ivo appeared as Herbie Bailey on &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;. 

In 1961 Ivo appeared as William, the young son of Motel owner Mrs Prattle -‘Praytell’- in the American ‘neo noir’ crime Film “The Cat Burglar” written by actor and former criminal Leo Gordon, starring Jack Hogan, June Kenney and John Baer.

Ivo guest starred in an episode of the syndicated adventure television series, &quot;Rescue 8&quot; and in two episodes of &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; (one being S3E37’s “Wally’s Play” as “The Duke”).
He also guest starred on the ABC/Warner Brothers western series, &quot;Sugarfoot&quot; and on the NBC western series &quot;The Tall Man&quot;. In several episodes of &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;, he played one of the Bud Anderson&#x27;s friends. During the 1961–62 TV season, Ivo played the role of Haywood Botts in another ABC sitcom, &quot;Margie&quot;. In 1963 he appeared in the &quot;Honeymoon Hotel&quot; episode of the &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;.

==Racing==
In the late 1950s, Ivo raced a twin (side by side) Buick nailhead-engined dragster which was the first gasoline-powered dragster to break the nine-second barrier.

The car held the &quot;Drag News&quot; AA/GD et record at 8.69. The Twin Buick also was the first gas dragster to record speeds of 170, 175 and 180 mph which were Standard 1320 records as well. It was unique in appearance and won numerous races, including NASCAR&#x27;s first National Drag Race. Later he designed a four-engine, four-wheel-drive dragster he called &quot;Showboat&quot; (with a quartet of Nailheads), but NHRA ruled it the first &quot;exhibition&quot; dragster, and he was unable to race it.

<text>Edward Chichester, 1st Viscount Chichester (1568 – 8 July 1648), was an English peer.

==Origins==
He was the third son of Sir John Chichester (died 1569), knight, lord of the manor of Raleigh, in the parish of Pilton, Devon, about three-quarters of a mile north-east of the historic centre of Barnstaple, by his wife Gertrude Courtenay (1521–1566), a daughter by his second marriage of Sir William Courtenay (1477–1535) &quot;The Great&quot; of Powderham, MP for Devon 1529–1535, and a distant cousin of the Earl of Devon. He was thus the younger brother of Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Chichester of Belfast (1563–1625), founder of Belfast.

==Career==
He was knighted in 1616, and after his brother&#x27;s death in 1625 was in his memory ennobled as Baron Chichester, of Belfast, and Viscount Chichester, of Carrickfergus, both in the County of Antrim, both in the Peerage of Ireland. He succeeded his brother in his extensive estates as well as in his offices of Governor of Carrickfergus and Lord High Admiral of Lough Neagh. He took his seat in the Irish House of Lords in 1634.

==Marriages and children==
Edward Chichester married twice:
*Firstly in 1605 to Anne Copleston (1588–1616), the sole daughter and heiress of John Copleston Esq., (died 1606) of Eggesford by his wife Dorothy Biston (died 29 July 1601). They had the following children:
**Arthur Chichester, 1st Earl of Donegall (1606–1674) the eldest son.
**Col. John Chichester (died 1647), a Royalist during the Civil War, who married Mary Jones, eldest daughter of Roger Jones, 1st Viscount Ranelagh (d. 1643), an Irish peer and Lord President of Connaught.
**Lt-Col. Edward Chichester (born 1611), a Royalist during the Civil War, who married Elisabeth Fisher, 5th daughter of Sir Edward Fisher, Knight, the latter who in 1611 had obtained letters patent from King James I for extensive lands in Wexford, Ireland, from which he ejected the local population by force of arms and formed into the &quot;Manor of Chichester&quot;, and in 1617 renamed Fisherstown, with his seat at &quot;Fisher&#x27;s Prospect&quot;. 
**Elizabeth Chichester, eldest daughter, wife of Sir William Wrey, 2nd Baronet (1600–1645) of Trebeigh, St Ive, Cornwall, and North Russell, Sourton, Devon, MP for Liskeard, Cornwall, in 1624. Her eldest son was Sir Chichester Wrey, 3rd Baronet (1628–1668), of Trebeigh, MP for Lostwithiel in Cornwall. Both the 2nd and 3rd Baronets were Royalists during the Civil War.
**Mary Chichester, younger daughter, who married firstly Thomas Wise of Sydenham in the parish of Marystow, Devon, and secondly John Harris of Radford.
*Secondly after 1616 and before 1626, as evidenced by a date stone on Eggesford Barton bearing the inscription: &quot;E.C.M. 1626&quot;, to Mary Denham.

==Death and burial==
Lord Chichester died on 8 July 1648 at his manor of Eggesford in Devon, where he was buried.

==Monument==

Lord Chichester has a particularly fine alabaster effigy and monument against the north wall of the north aisle (Chichester Chapel) in Eggesford Church, Devon, to the immediate west of which stood his manor house, Eggesford House, demolished in 1824. The monument shows recumbent effigies of himself and his first wife with two tablets above inscribed as follows:

:&quot;Here rest in hope of Resurrection the body of the Right Hon.bl Sr. Edward Chichester knt., Lord Chichester, Barron of Belfast. Viscount Chichester of Carrickfergus, governor of the same &amp;c., and one of His Majesties most hon.ble Privy Counsell for the Kingdome of Ireland, sonne of Sr. John Chichester of Rawleigh knight; and the body of Dame Anne his wife sole daughter and heire of John Copleston of Eggesford Esq.r. who had issue Arthur his eldest sonne now Lord Viscount Chichester, Earle of Donegall &amp;c, who first married Dorcas, daughter of John Hill of Honnely in Warwickshire, Esq. and had issue by her one daughter; afterwards the Lady Mary eldest daughter of John, Earle of Bristol and had issue by her six sonnes &amp; two daughters.

Hee departed this life on the 8 and was buried on ye 13-day of July Anno 1648. Shee departed this life on the 8 and was buried on the 11-day of March Anno 1616. This monument was prepared by himself in his lifetime but now erected and finished by the said Arthur Lord Viscount Chichester, Earle of Donegall, January the 11 Anno Domini 1648&quot;.

On a lunette above, probably the text planned by the deceased himself:

&quot;In memory of Edward Lord Viscount Chichester &amp; Dame Anne his wife and in humble acknowledgement of the good providence of God in advancing their house&quot;.

&quot;Fam&#x27;d Arthur Ireland&#x27;s dreade in armes in peace, &lt;br&gt;

Next Arthur in God&#x27;s caus and King&#x27;s stak&#x27;t all,&lt;br&gt;
And had to&#x27;s honour added Donnegall&quot;.&lt;br&gt;

On the wall to the right above the monument is a black stone tablet inscribed as a memorial to Anne Copleston&#x27;s parents:

&quot;Here lyeth buried ye bodies of John Copleston Esq., &amp; Dorothie his wife daughter to Sr. George Biston of Biston Castel in Chelshere, knight.

Sir George Beeston (c. 1520 – 1601) of Beeston House near Bunbury, Crewe, Cheshire, acquired Beeston Castle from the Crown shortly before his death. He was a naval captain who commanded the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; against the Spanish Armada in 1588, and was knighted at sea on board the &quot;Ark Royal&quot; by Lord Howard of Effingham the Lord High Admiral. He served as MP for Cheshire in 1589. His wife, and Dorothy&#x27;s mother, was Alice Davenport (died 1591), daughter of Thomas Davenport Esq., of Henbury. Sir George&#x27;s effigy and elaborate monument exist against the north wall of the sanctuary in St Boniface&#x27;s Church, Bunbury.

<text>Magua is a fictional character and the main antagonist in the 1826 novel &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; by James Fenimore Cooper. This historical novel is set at the time of the French and Indian War. A Huron Indian chief, he is also known by the French alias &quot;Le Renard Subtil&quot; (&quot;The Wily Fox&quot;).

Magua is the enemy of Colonel Munro, the commandant of Fort William Henry, and attempts on several occasions to abduct the colonel&#x27;s daughters, Cora and Alice. He also assists the French leader, the Marquis de Montcalm, in his attack on the fort.

Magua reveals how his life was shattered by being abducted himself by the Mohawks, the traditional enemies of the Huron. His life was spared, and he was adopted into the tribe. During his time with the Mohawks, Magua met up with Colonel Munro, who punished him by tying him to a whipping-post for drinking whiskey, which he calls fire-water. Later, when he returned to the Huron village, he found that his wife had married another.

In the novel, his attempts to force Munro&#x27;s daughter Cora to become his wife and his hatred of the English lead to his downfall and death. He captures both daughters, but is pursued by their father, by David Gamut, Hawkeye, Chingachgook, and Uncas. Magua kills Uncas during his attempt to free Cora, and one of Magua&#x27;s companions stabs Cora, causing her death. Hawkeye soon shoots Magua, who falls from a cliff shouting his defiance to the end.

In the most recent film version of this novel in 1992, Magua blames all his past misfortunes on Colonel Munro and swears to kill both Munro and his two daughters. He captures Munro during an ambush of the British evacuation of the fort, then cuts out his heart after telling his enemy his motives and plans. Later he kills Uncas. He himself is then killed by Chingachgook, the father of Uncas.

<text>The Pa-hsien Mountain (), or Eight Immortals Mountain, is a mountain in Heping District, Taichung, Taiwan. It is a branch of Mount Yu. Its height is 2,448 metres, which is around 8,000 Taiwanese feet (台尺). The pronunciation of &quot;eight thousand&quot; (baqian) and &quot;eight immortals&quot; are similar in Chinese, hence the name.

One of the three major logging stations in Taiwan used to be in the forest. There is an amusement park located on the part of the mountain that is located in Heping District. It is estimated that there are 59 native birds and 5 migratory birds.

<text>Donald Leo Mischer (born March 5, 1940) is an American producer and director of television and live events and president of Don Mischer Productions.

==Career==
Mischer has been honored with fifteen Emmy Awards, a record ten Directors Guild of America Awards for Outstanding Directorial Achievement, two NAACP Image Awards, a Peabody Award for excellence in broadcasting, and the 2012 Norman Lear Achievement Award in Television from the Producers Guild of America and the 2019 Directors Guild of America Lifetime Achievement Award for Television.

As a producer/director, his credits include the Oscars, &quot;We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial&quot;, the Kennedy Center Honors, the 100th anniversary of Carnegie Hall, &quot;Motown 25&quot;, the Super Bowl Halftime Shows (Michael Jackson, Prince, the Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, Tom Petty, and Bruce Springsteen), the Democratic National Convention, and the Opening Ceremonies of the 1996 Summer Olympics and 2002 Winter Olympics. Mischer has also produced specials with Beyoncé, Bono, Prince, Rihanna, Britney Spears, Bruce Springsteen, James Taylor, Taylor Swift, Stevie Wonder, Sting, Garth Brooks, Mary J. Blige, Elton John, Justin Timberlake, Barbra Streisand, Cher, Yo Yo Ma, and Morgan Freeman, among others. He also presided as director over the 1975 flop, &quot;Saturday Night Live With Howard Cosell&quot;, which he blamed on the inexperience and indifference of producer Roone Arledge.

He has received the Governors Award from the National Association of Choreographers and is a member of the Event Industry Hall of Fame, the Producers Guild of America, the Directors Guild of America, and the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, where he has served two terms on the board of governors. As a member of the Directors Guild of America, he has served three terms on the National Board, and in 2019 received the DGA&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award for Television, only the fourth such award ever given for television. On December 11, 2014, Mischer received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 

In November of 2023, Mischer published his memoir “:10 Seconds to Air: My Life in the Director’s Chair,” recounting the entire span of his career. Book review magazine Kirkus Reviews wrote “Mischer&#x27;s writing style is in formal and charming – he creates an atmosphere of candor and intimacy without going out of his way to ingratiate himself to readers. As a result, his recollection is thoroughly entertaining, but also affecting and thoughtful. A frank, insightful recollection of an accomplished career.&quot;

==Personal life==
Mischer was born in San Antonio, Texas, the son of Lillian and Elmer Mischer. After graduating from Douglas MacArthur High School in San Antonio, Mischer completed his education at the University of Texas Austin. He graduated with a BA degree in 1961 and with a master&#x27;s degree in sociology and political science in 1963. Mischer&#x27;s work took him to Washington, D.C., where he worked with the US Information Agency and Oscar-winning documentarian Charles Guggenheim. 
With his first wife Beverly, he has two children, Jennifer Christine and Heather Mischer Godsey. After 10 years in New York, he relocated to Los Angeles, where he had two children, Charles Donald and Lilly Ellison, with his wife Suzan Reed Mischer, a former CBS executive and graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design.

==Accolades==
*Mischer has 40 Primetime Emmy nominations, with 15 Emmy wins: 13 wins through The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, and 2 wins through the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.
*10 Directors Guild of America Awards for Outstanding Directorial Achievement.
*George Foster Peabody Award for Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever.
*Norman Lear Achievement Award in Television, from the Producers Guild of America (2012).
*Directors Guild Lifetime Achievement Award (2019). Only the fourth such award given for Television Direction.

*Governors Award from the National Association of Choreographers.
*Membership in the Event Industry Hall of Fame.
*Received Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on December 11, 2014.
*Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Cinematographers Guild

==2004 Democratic National Convention==
In 2004, he produced the Democratic National Convention at the FleetCenter in Boston. After John Kerry&#x27;s acceptance speech, balloons were supposed to drop from the ceiling onto the delegates below. However, the balloons got stuck in the ceiling and did not fall. Mischer subsequently lost his temper with his tech crew and his profanities were aired accidentally by CNN&#x27;s live broadcast.

<doc id="868817" wikidata="Q1572638" url="?curid=868817" title="Huff-Daland XB-1">
<text>The Huff-Daland XB-1 was a prototype bomber aircraft built for the United States Army Air Corps.

The XB-1 was the first aircraft named using just a &quot;B-&quot; designation. Prior to 1926, the U.S. Army used &quot;LB-&quot; and &quot;HB-&quot; prefixes, signifying &#x27;Light Bomber&#x27; and &#x27;Heavy Bomber&#x27;. The first XB-1, called the &quot;Super-Cyclops&quot; by Huff-Daland, was an extension of the earlier Huff-Daland XHB-1 &#x27;Cyclops&#x27;. It was essentially the same in size, but sported a twin tail and twin engines.

==Design and development==
The XB-1&#x27;s gunnery arrangement was new for an American bomber, but it had been previously used by the British and the Germans during World War I. The Army Air Corps had decided that single-engined bombers such as the XHB-1 performed worse, and weren&#x27;t as safe as twin-engined bombers.

==Operational history==
The aircraft flew for the first time in September 1927. Its original Packard engines did not provide enough power for the aircraft, and it was refitted with more powerful Curtiss Aircraft &quot;Conqueror&quot; engines. This new configuration was designated the XB-1B.

Three other similar aircraft designs were requested by the Army Air Corps around the same time which competed against the XB-1 for the contract. Of these three (the XB-2 Condor, the Sikorsky S-37 and the Fokker XLB-2), the Curtiss model eventually won, and only a single XB-1 was ever produced.

<doc id="868838" wikidata="Q3631502" url="?curid=868838" title="Action at a distance (computer programming)">
<text>Action at a distance is an anti-pattern in computer science in which behavior in one part of a program varies wildly based on difficult or impossible to identify operations in another part of the program.

The way to avoid the problems associated with action at a distance is a proper design, which avoids global variables and alters data only in a controlled and local manner, or usage of a pure functional programming style with referential transparency.

The term is based on the concept of action at a distance in physics, which may refer to a process that allows objects to interact without a mediator particle such as the gluon. In particular, Albert Einstein referred to quantum nonlocality as &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot;.

Software bugs due to action at a distance may arise because a program component is doing something at the wrong time, or affecting something it should not. It is very difficult, however, to track down which component is responsible. Side effects from innocent actions can put the program in an unknown state, so local data is not necessarily local. The solution in this particular scenario is to define which components should be interacting with which others. A proper design that accurately defines the interface between parts of a program, and that avoids shared states, can largely eliminate problems caused by action at a distance.

==Example==
This example, from the Perl programming language, demonstrates an especially serious case of action at a distance (note the codice_1 variable was deprecated in later versions of Perl):

==Action at a distance across objects==
Proper object-oriented programming involves design principles that avoid action at a distance.

The Law of Demeter states that an object should only interact with other objects near itself. Should action in a distant part of the system be required then it should be implemented by propagating a message. Proper design severely limits occurrences of action at a distance, contributing to maintainable programs. Pressure to create an object orgy results from poor interface design, perhaps taking the form of a God object, not implementing true objects, or failing to heed the Law of Demeter.

One of the advantages of functional programming is that action at a distance is de-emphasised, sometimes to the point of being impossible to express at all in the source language.

Being aware of the danger of allowing action at a distance into a design, and being able to recognize the presence of action at a distance, is useful in developing programs that are correct, reliable and maintainable. Given that the majority of the expense of a program may be in the maintenance phase, and that action at a distance makes maintenance difficult, expensive and error prone, it is worth effort during design to avoid.

<text>The Korean Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (KOSDAQ; ) is a trading board of Korea Exchange (KRX) in South Korea established in 1996. Initially set up by Korea Financial Investment Association as an independent stock market from the Korean Stock Exchange, it was benchmarked from the American counterpart, NASDAQ. KOSDAQ is an electronic stock market, just like NASDAQ. The open hours for the market are 09:00AM to 03:30PM KST.

It is now operated as SME Market Division of KRX. As of February 2021, 1476 companies are listed on KOSDAQ for trading.

==History==

In July 1986, The South Korean government passed the &quot;Market Organization for Vitalization of Publicly Traded Assets for Small Businesses Act&quot; in order to provide a way for small and intermediate businesses to raise capital through publicly traded shares, and to provide investors with new routes of investments. In April 1987, the Market Organization was achieved, and the first three companies were registered.

On May 17, 1996, the KOSDAQ Securities Exchange (코스닥증권시장) was established in order to vitalize, modernize and fully computerize the market. KOSDAQ went into fully service on July 1, 1996.

During the 1997 Asian financial crisis, KOSDAQ market indexes plummeted and investors suffered heavy losses, but due to the quick recovery of the South Korean Economy, KOSDAQ saw rapid recovery and increase in market capitalization through the early 21st century.

<doc id="868863" wikidata="Q1107140" url="?curid=868863" title="Physical attractiveness stereotype">
<text>The physical attractiveness stereotype, commonly known as the &quot;beautiful-is-good&quot; stereotype, is the tendency to assume that physically attractive individuals, coinciding with social beauty standards, also possess other desirable personality traits, such as intelligence, social competence, and morality. The target benefits from what has been coined as “pretty privilege”, namely social, economic, and political advantages or benefits. Physical attractiveness can have a significant effect on how people are judged in terms of employment or social opportunities, friendship, sexual behavior, and marriage. 

The physical attractiveness stereotype will bias an observer&#x27;s opinions and decisions when comparing people of different attractiveness levels. There is evidence of this stereotype affecting decision making within social settings, but also within the workplace and the judicial system.

== History ==
The physical attractiveness stereotype was first formally observed in a study done by Karen Dion, Ellen Berscheid, and Elaine Walster in 1972. The goal of this study was to determine whether physical attractiveness affected how individuals were perceived, specifically whether they were perceived to have more socially desirable personality traits and quality of life. Participants, all university students, were informed that they would be tested on how well they could &quot;read&quot; a person after seeing a single photo of them, where their performance would then be compared to individuals trained in reading body language and other interpersonal skills. The subjects were then given three envelopes that contained a photo of either a male or female near the subjects&#x27; age, who the researchers had categorized as either attractive, average, or unattractive. Findings demonstrated that, overall, attractive individuals judged to be more socially desirable, have better job and marital prospects, be better spouses, and have better social, marital and professional lives compared to unattractive individuals. The only dimension that did not realise the same results was parenting, where attractive individuals were not rated higher on the expectation of being a better parent. Hence, this study coined the term &quot;beautiful-is-good&quot;. 

== Related theories and perspectives ==
There are some proposed theoretical underpinnings and evidence for the physical attractiveness stereotype.

=== Implicit personality theory ===
The implicit personality theory is the unconscious assumptions one makes about another&#x27;s personality based on their characteristics. These assumptions can be based on other personality traits but in the context of the physical attractiveness stereotype, they are based on physical traits. Using this theory, researchers explain the physical attractiveness stereotype in that attractive physical features are linked with positive assumptions of personality and unattractive physical features are linked with negative assumptions of personality. These unconscious linkages can explain why those seen as more physically attractive are treated and perceived differently. However, this theory becomes inaccurate when individuals make assumptions based on pre-conceived judgements they believe make sense without applying them to real-world circumstances. 

One prevalent study conducted a meta-analysis which used the implicit personality theory to challenge the “beauty-is-good” theory. The study found that the traits associated with attractiveness were only remarkably strong for social competence (e.g., sociability, popularity), whereas people also tended to view them as more vain and less modest. With evidence finding that the “beauty-is-good” theory was not one-dimensional, using the implicit personality framework was argued to be most appropriate, encouraging the context-dependent nature and complexity of the physically attractive stereotype to be acknowledged. 

=== Evolution ===
The principle of evolutionary biology is that, in case of genetic variation within a population in a characteristic, the form which improves the individual&#x27;s chance of survival and reproduction will be selected over other forms and becomes more frequent within the population. Evolutionary psychologists suggest that the physical attractiveness stereotype has evolved for individuals to assess potential mates and reproductive partners and as a means to assess our status ranking among same-sex members.

The reproductive strategy of women and men differ; however, both include advertising to potential mates and competing with same-sex members to demonstrate one&#x27;s value. Attractiveness or beauty is the display of these traits and one of the most important predictors of reproductive success. Physical attractiveness may have evolved as a signal of good health, fitness, and genetic quality. Certain physical features, including symmetry, clear skin, and waist-to-hip ratio, signal reproductive health. Individuals with these features are perceived as more attractive because they possess genes which they could pass on to the next generation.

The physical attractiveness stereotype may have also evolved as a result of natural selection. Attractive individuals may have a greater chance of mating and passing on desirable traits and are therefore preferred as mates over others based on their physical attractiveness.

Physical attractiveness, therefore, provides the target with direct benefits where they gain directly for themselves and their offspring, and indirect benefits whereby the target gains genetic benefits to the offspring.

=== Brain regions involved in perceiving attractiveness ===
Here only the brain regions used in assessing facial beauty will be discussed, since there is little research of how the brain processes body judgements.

The brain uses at least three cognitive domains to decide the value of attractiveness. At first, the occipital and temporal regions of the cortex process face views. The information about facial features is then passed on to the fusiform face area of the fusiform gyrus (FG) for facial recognition. When judging an unfamiliar face, the FG responds more strongly to attractive faces than unattractive ones, suggesting that the recognition of attractive features occurs even before the rest of the brain is included in the evaluation.

The second module interprets facial movements and then interacts with other brain regions such as the amygdala, insula, and limbic system for the emotional content of facial expressions and movements.

Information is then passed on to the third module, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) which makes judgments of beauty and produces the neurological rewards, namely dopamine and other neurotransmitters, for finding the face&#x27;s beauty. The OFC is more active when viewing an attractive face versus an unattractive face. These areas of the bran are also associated with reward processing and regulating experiences of pleasure motivation. Researchers suggest that our brains find attractive faces rewarding which could be part of the reason more attractive people benefit from pretty privilege.

=== Memory ===
&quot;See also: Memory&quot;

In memory systems, stereotypes form as information is encoded and stored, primarily as semantic memory, integrating into existing schemas. They are then primed and retrieved into working memory when forming judgements. 

Studies have suggested stereotypes foster efficiency in encoding, where information congruent with stereotypes can readily assimilate and consolidate into existing schemas. Information, hence, was also better recalled, though potentially motivated by confirmation biases. Studies found people often mistakenly recognised stereotype-congruent information as familiar, bolstered by findings of recognition biases stemmed from stereotypes generating false memories. Furthermore, when memory processes were compromised, stereotypes were exercised as heuristic cues in facilitating the retrieval of information and formation of judgements. For example, studies found upon recounting episodic memories, people relied on semantic memory in reinterpreting forgotten details, as it is more easily retrievable. Similar behaviours were also observed when complexity or cognitive demand of tasks increased. For instance, one study found that as decision-making became harder, jurors exhibited stronger stereotype-congruent recall of case details and judgements on defendants. Hence, though stereotypes can sometimes allow people to remember, recall and recognise more easily, it comes at the expense of accurately recalling and utilising these concepts later on. 

Findings from Jean-Christophe Rohner and Anders Rasmussens&#x27; support such findings, whilst tailoring their study’s focus specifically to the physically attractive stereotype. 

Their 2011 study found evidence that both explicit (conscious) and implicit (unconscious) memory systems recognised stereotype-congruent better than incongruent information. Across three experiments, researchers presented participants with equally divided sets of congruent and incongruent face-word pairs (e.g., an attractive face with “kind” or “cruel”, respectively). Researchers then conducted subsequent memory tests, presenting new face-word pairs along with the old pairs. Explicit memory was investigated by observing whether participants could accurately recognise and categorise the pairs as &quot;old&quot; or &quot;new&quot;. Implicit memory was measured similarly, albeit participants only focused on the word&#x27;s valence (e.g., &quot;kind&quot; is &quot;positive&quot;) to judge whether the presented “face” influenced response/reaction time. The study also measured the participants&#x27; subjective confidence in their responses

Though results demonstrated participants had recognised congruent pairs most accurately and quickly, they also frequently categorised them as &quot;old&quot; regardless. No significant correlation between answers and measures of low confidence was found, demonstrating participants confidently believed they encountered congruent pairs before, supporting previous notions of bias imposed on recognition memory. 

Moreover, their 2012 study extended this by investigating the effects of nine moderating variables on stereotype-guided behaviours. Results demonstrated no moderator had a statistically significant impact in reducing bias, indicating the need for potentially accommodating real-world scenarios to account for the strength of the physically attractive stereotype.
== Real-life implications ==
In the years since the publication of the original study, further research has bolstered the physical attractiveness stereotype and expanded its influence into other areas. 

=== Intelligence ratings ===
Physical attraction also has a strong relationship with how intelligent one is perceived. For both adults and children, attractive individuals are expected to be more intellectually competent than unattractive individuals. This effect is stronger in adults and also stronger in males. Between equally attractive males and females, the males will be perceived as more intelligent. This perception exists despite little to no evidence that attractiveness is correlated with actual competence.

=== Workplace ===
Research has shown that this stereotype exists in the workplace as well. A meta-analysis looking at how one&#x27;s level of physical attractiveness can affect various job-related outcomes showed a strong relationship between attractive individuals and better job outcomes. The report accumulated over 60 study results and showed that attractive individuals were perceived as better employees. They are more likely to be hired and promoted, as well as ranked higher in performance evaluations and employment potential than unattractive counterparts. This stereotype is present for and affects both men and women as neither the gender of the attractive individual nor the gender of the observer influences the relationship.

=== Judicial system ===
&quot;See also: Physically attractive stereotype— Memory&quot;

Studies have demonstrated how attractive defendants also receive more lenient treatment in judicial settings, being viewed as less dangerous and more virtuous.

A meta-analysis conducted by Ronald Mazella and Alan Feingold investigated the effect of a defendant’s physical attractiveness on jury rulings through mock trials to better understand juries’ decision-making. It was found that defendants who were physically attractive, female, and of high socioeconomic status received weaker sentences. Juries were more likely to find a physically unattractive defendant guilty than an attractive defendant. Additionally, for certain crimes, juries recommended lesser punishments for attractive individuals. In the case of robbery, rape, and cheating, the attractiveness of the defendant contributed to a lesser sentence. However, in the case of negligent homicide, attractive individuals received harsher punishments than their unattractive counterparts, though the effect size of these findings were notably small. Researchers posit that this occurs because attractive individuals are held to higher standards than unattractive individuals. Therefore, they are treated harsher when they make a mistake, such as in the case of negligent homicide.

Most studies also found that attractiveness led to weaker punishments. However, for crimes that shared relations with attractiveness, such as swindling, they received harsher sentences compared to their unattractive counterparts. This is potentially a result of jurors perceiving defendants to weaponise their attractiveness, hindering stereotype-congruent associations to be exercised in decision-making. Generally, such results were rationalised by acknowledging that benefits reaped from the physically attractive stereotype were not unidirectional. Some studies posited that when attractive defendants provided justification, jurors anchored to this more positively, and were more forgiving in sentencing. However, when justification was low, jurors could not characterise defendants with stereotype-congruent traits of attractiveness, realising no benefits over unattractive defendants.

The effects physically-attractive stereotypes have on memory also underscore the fragility of certain judicial processes. Empirical evidence revealed that people rely on stereotypes in inferring forgotten details when recalling personal memories, or as a heuristic to ease complex decision-making. Such findings further shed light on potentially detrimental biases impinging jurors, with similar implications applying to memory-based judgements like eyewitness testimonies. 

Many studies have found unattractive faces are stereotypically associated with untrustworthiness, and hence, criminality and guilt in crime-settings. One study found that unattractive/“criminal” faces were more memorable and easier recognised. Another study indirectly supported this, however, their results indicated that, more significantly, participants failed to recognise individuals intra-categorically (e.g., attractive individuals from each other). Such recognition error was also demonstrated with other variables such as race, with some highlighting that people were notably confident in their judgements. The implications of this on eyewitness testimonies can be inferred, where unattractive individuals are particularly vulnerable to these stereotype-motivated recognition errors, especially when sharing similar characteristics to the actual perpetrator or those associated with criminality.

Current literature has also found that asking witnesses to select out of options can make them feel more confident in their answers, where this is misconstrued as accurate. For example, providing a series of mugshots for them to select the perpetrator. It is encouraged for them to freely recall information instead. Studies have also found that stereotype-motivated behaviour is potentially easily reversible, where simply informing participants to be more deliberate and conscious in mitigating stereotypical thinking can almost entirely remove its biassed effects.

A 2023 study found that attractive victims of intimate partner violence are viewed as being more credible compared to less attractive victims.

=== Education ===
In a review of studies done that examine perception of students in the education system, it was found that attractive students were treated more favorably by their teachers than unattractive students. Consistent with the perception that attractive individuals are more intelligent, research shows that teachers have higher expectations for attractive students. They expect these students to be more intelligent, earn better grades, and have better social attributes than other, less attractive students. Furthermore, various studies done between 1960–1985 show that attractive students actually earned higher scores on standardized tests. Researchers believe this is an example of a self-fulfilling prophecy, where the teacher&#x27;s higher expectations for the attractive students cause them to work harder and perform better.

==Criticism==
There are recent studies that indicate that the physical attractiveness stereotype can also be a negative bias and disadvantage the target. Research suggests that there might exist an exception to pretty privilege when the viewer and the target are of the same sex. In the study, targets were less likely to be recommended for a job and admission into university compared to average-looking individuals. This might stem from a desire to avoid perceived self-threats posed by attractive same-sex targets. Especially individuals who lack self-esteem are more likely to avoid these threats than those with high self-esteem.

<text>Vance DeBar Colvig Sr. (September 11, 1892 – October 3, 1967), known professionally as Pinto Colvig, was an American voice actor, cartoonist, and circus and vaudeville performer whose schtick was playing the clarinet off-key while mugging. Colvig was the original performer of the Disney characters Goofy and Pluto, as well as Bozo the Clown and Bluto in &quot;Popeye&quot;. In 1993, he was posthumously made a Disney Legend for his contributions to Walt Disney Films, including &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; and &quot;Fun and Fancy Free&quot;.

== Early life ==
Colvig was born Vance DeBar Colvig in Jacksonville, Oregon, the youngest of seven children of William Mason &quot;Judge&quot; Colvig (1845–1936) and his wife, Adelaide ( Birdseye) Colvig (1856–1912). 

William Colvig was a pioneer, an attorney and a distinguished Oregonian; he was never actually a judge. Pinto attended but did not graduate from Medford High School. Pinto was accepted and attended, sporadically from 1910 to 1913, Oregon State University, in Corvallis, where he took art classes and played clarinet in the band. He drew cartoons for the Oregon Agricultural College Barometer newspaper, and the yearbook.

I was born in Jacksonville and named Vance DeBar Colvig. At age 7 (because of too many freckles, and goony antics) I was nicknamed &#x27;Pinto the Village Clown&#x27; (which I have used professionally during my circus and other show business activities, besides occasional jobs as a newspaper cartoonist.— &quot;&#x27;Pinto&#x27; Colvig Writes About Names, History of Clowning&quot;, &quot;Medford Mail Tribune&quot;, July 12, 1961.

== Career ==

In 1913, Colvig worked the Pantages Theatre Circuit, briefly, before leaving for clarinetist in the Al G. Barnes Circus band for part of a season. In 1914 he was a newspaper cartoonist in Reno, Nevada and then in Carson City, then again clarinetist in the Al G. Barnes Circus band for part of the 1915 season.

I didn&#x27;t know when I was going to school whether I wanted to be a clown, draw cartoons, write, hobo, or be a musician. So I wrapped it all up and made stew out of it. — Pinto Colvig

Colvig performed &quot;chalk talks&quot; in vaudeville.

In 1916, Colvig worked at the Animated Film Corporation in San Francisco, which produced animated cartoons years prior to Walt Disney. The company was the oldest known studio of its kind established on the West Coast. That year Colvig at Animated Film Corporation produced &quot;Creation,&quot; reported to be the world&#x27;s first feature-length cartoon. Only five 35 mm frames survive, housed at the Southern Oregon Historical Society. Animated Film Corporation in San Francisco, ended with the entry of the U.S. into World War I (April 1917).

In 1919, Pinto produced &quot;Pinto&#x27;s Prizma Comedy Review,&quot; the first color cartoon, it is now considered a lost film, and published in the San Francisco Bulletin (May 1919—February 1920), the &quot;Bulletin Boob&quot; column, and photographs.

In 1922, Colvig created a newspaper cartoon panel titled &quot;Life on the Radio Wave&quot; for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. The feature ran three or four times per week on the newspaper&#x27;s radio page, was syndicated nationally, and lasted six months. In 1922, Colvig and his family moved to Hollywood, working as an animator, title writer and comedian in silent comedies and on sound cartoons, working first for Mack Sennett.

By the late 1920s, Colvig became associated with Walter Lantz, with whom he attempted to establish a cartoon studio, creating a character called &quot;Bolivar, the Talking Ostrich&quot;, which would have appeared in sound shorts. When Lantz became producer of Universal&#x27;s Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons in 1929, Colvig was hired as an animator, also working as a storyman and voice artist, briefly voicing Oswald.

In 1930, Colvig signed an eight-year contract with Walt Disney Productions as a writer, also providing sound effects, including the barks for Pluto the Pup. The following year he began voicing Goofy, originally known as Dippy Dawg. Other notable characters he voiced include Practical Pig, the pig that built the &quot;house of bricks&quot; in the Disney short &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot;, and both Grumpy and Sleepy in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;. He directed (along with Erdman Penner and Walt Pfeiffer) the 1937 Mickey Mouse short &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Amateurs&quot;. Colvig was associated with Disney for most of his career.

Between 1937 and 1940, Colvig did not work for the Disney studio, after falling out with Walt Disney. He was offered a job with Fleischer Studios, then planning to produce a competing feature-length animated film in the wake of Disney&#x27;s success with &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,&quot; moving to Miami in early 1938. For Fleischer, he worked on 1939&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, for which he voiced town crier Gabby, who was spun off into his own short-lived series. He also voiced Bluto for the studio&#x27;s &quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot; cartoons, replacing Gus Wickie, who elected to remain in New York rather than move to Miami. Colvig&#x27;s departure from Disney meant that the increasingly popular Goofy went voiceless for several years. A select few shorts during the interim period of leave featured a soundalike voice for Goofy provided by Jack Bailey. He began working on radio, providing voices and sound effects, including the sounds of Jack Benny&#x27;s Maxwell on &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, later performed by Mel Blanc.

In 1939, Colvig returned to California, and began to devote himself to acting and doing voices in several cartoons for the Warner Bros. animation studio and for MGM, where he voiced a Munchkin in the 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

In 1946, Colvig was cast as Bozo the Clown for Capitol Records. He played the role for a decade, which also included portraying the character on television. During this period, Colvig also recorded the &quot;Filbert the Frog&quot; song, which featured Colvig&#x27;s virtuoso use of the glottal stop as a musical instrument in itself.

In 1967, Colvig&#x27;s last known performance, as Goofy, was for the Telephone Pavilion at Expo 67. Colvig&#x27;s dialogue for this exhibit was recorded six months before his death.

== Personal life ==
Colvig married Margaret Bourke Slavin (1892–1950) in 1916, and settled with her in San Francisco, where four of their five boys were born. Later, their last son was born in Los Angeles.

Colvig was the father of the character and voice actor Vance Colvig, who also later portrayed Bozo the Clown on a live TV program.

A lifelong smoker, Colvig was one of the pioneers in advocating warning labels about cancer risk on cigarette packages in the United States.

==Death==

Colvig died of lung cancer on October 3, 1967, at Motion Picture Country Hospital in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California, at age 75. He was interred at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City. Their graves remained unmarked for years until Colvig&#x27;s great-granddaughter designed his marker and Arthur Dark, his descendants placed this headstone in 2020.

<doc id="868868" wikidata="Q7603671" url="?curid=868868" title="State constitutions in the United States">
<text>In the United States, each state has its own written constitution.

They are much longer than the United States Constitution, which only contains 4,543 words. State constitutions are all longer than 8,000 words because they are more detailed regarding the day-to-day relationships between government and the people. The shortest is the Constitution of Vermont, adopted in 1793 and currently 8,295 words long. The longest was Alabama&#x27;s sixth constitution, ratified in 1901, about 345,000 words long, but rewritten in 2022. Both the federal and state constitutions are organic texts: they are the fundamental blueprints for the legal and political organizations of the United States and the states, respectively.

The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (part of the Bill of Rights) provides that &quot;The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.&quot; The Guarantee Clause of Article 4 of the Constitution states that &quot;The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government.&quot; These two provisions indicate states did not surrender their wide latitude to adopt a constitution, the fundamental documents of state law, when the U.S. Constitution was adopted.

Typically state constitutions address a wide array of issues deemed by the states to be of sufficient importance to be included in the constitution rather than in an ordinary statute. Often modeled after the federal Constitution, they outline the structure of the state government and typically establish a bill of rights, an executive branch headed by a governor (and often one or more other officials, such as a lieutenant governor and state attorney general), a state legislature, and state courts, including a state supreme court (a few states have two high courts, one for civil cases, the other for criminal cases). They also provide general governmental framework for what each branch is supposed to do and how it should go about doing it. Additionally, many other provisions may be included. Many state constitutions, unlike the federal constitution, also begin with an invocation of God.

Some states allow amendments to the constitution by initiative.

Many states have had several constitutions over the course of their history.

The territories of the United States are &quot;organized&quot; and, thus, self-governing if the United States Congress has passed an Organic Act. Two of the 14 territories without commonwealth status — Guam and the United States Virgin Islands — are organized, but have not adopted their own constitutions. One unorganized territory, American Samoa, has its own constitution. The remaining 13 unorganized territories have no permanent populations and are either under direct control of the U.S. Government or operate as military bases.

The commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) do not have organic acts but operate under local constitutions. Pursuant to the acquisition of Puerto Rico under the Treaty of Paris, 1898, the relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States is controlled by Article IV of the United States Constitution. Constitutional law in the CNMI is based upon a series of constitutional documents, the most important of which are the 1976 Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in political union with the United States of America, which controls the relationship between the CNMI and the United States; and the local commonwealth constitution, drafted in 1976, ratified by the people of the CNMI in March 1977, accepted by the United States Government in October 1977, and effective from 9 January 1978.


==List of constitutions==
The following is a list of the current constitutions of the states in the United States. Each entry shows the ordinal number of the current constitution, the official name of the current constitution, the date on which the current constitution took effect, and the estimated length of the current constitution. Also below are a description of organic instruments with respect to additional territory.

Constitutions of states that were independent countries prior to admission, and constitutions used by rebelling states participating in the American Civil War are not counted.
===Federal district charter===
The District of Columbia has a charter similar to charters of major cities, instead of having a constitution like the states and territories. The District of Columbia Home Rule Act establishes the Council of the District of Columbia, which governs the entire district and has certain devolved powers similar to those of major cities. Congress has full authority over the district and may amend the charter and any legislation enacted by the Council. Attempts at statehood for the District of Columbia have included the drafting of three constitutions in 1982 1987, and 2016 all referring to the district as the &quot;State of New Columbia&quot;.

===Commonwealth and Territorial constitutions===
* The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, July 25, 1952. It was ratified by Puerto Rico&#x27;s electorate in a referendum on March 3, 1952, approved by the United States Congress.
* The Constitution of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands was drafted by thirty-nine elected delegates meeting in a constitutional convention on Saipan in 1976. Their proposed constitution was subsequently ratified by Northern Mariana Islands voters on March 6, 1977, and became effective January 9, 1978. Pursuant to the provisions of Section 202 of the Covenant, the Constitution of the Northern Mariana Islands was deemed to have been approved by the Government of the United States six months after the date of submission to the president. The six-month period having expired on October 22, 1977, President Carter issued a proclamation announcing the Constitution of the Northern Mariana Islands was deemed approved.
* The Constitution of the Territory of American Samoa was signed by 68 members of the 1960 constitutional convention and was approved by United States Secretary of the Interior Fred Andrew Seaton on 27 April 1960. It became effective 17 October 1960. Several amendments to the Constitution were approved in a referendum in the general elections in 1966, subsequently by Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall on 2 June 1967, and became effective 1 July 1967.

===Organic acts===
* The Territory of Guam does not have its own constitution, but operates under the Guam Organic Act of 1950 and other federal statutes.
* The United States Virgin Islands, an unincorporated organized territory, does not have its own constitution, instead operating under various federal statutes. The Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands of 1954 is the current Organic Act defining the government of the United States Virgin Islands.

<doc id="868882" wikidata="Q776860" url="?curid=868882" title="Clive Swift">
<text>Clive Walter Swift (9 February 1936 – 1 February 2019) was an English actor and songwriter. A classically trained actor, his stage work included performances with the Royal Shakespeare Company, but he was best known to television viewers for his role as Richard Bucket in the BBC sitcom &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot;. He played many other television and film roles.

==Life and career==
Swift was born in Liverpool on 9 February 1936, the son of Abram Sampson Swift, who owned a furniture shop in Bootle, and Lily Rebecca, née Greenman. He was educated at Clifton College and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge reading English literature. He was previously a teacher at LAMDA and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. His family was Jewish.

He appeared as Snug in the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s 1968 film production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; as part of a cast that included Diana Rigg, Helen Mirren and Ian Richardson. During the 1970s, he appeared as Doctor Black in two of the BBC&#x27;s M. R. James adaptations: &quot;The Stalls of Barchester&quot; and in &quot;A Warning to the Curious&quot;, as well as the BBC adaptation of &quot;The Barchester Chronicles&quot;. He is best known for his role on &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot; as Richard Bucket, the long-suffering husband of Hyacinth. Swift made two appearances in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, in the 1985 story &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot; and the 2007 Christmas special. Around the time of his second appearance, he gave a &quot;grumpy&quot; interview to &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; in which he bemoaned &quot;not getting paid&quot; to promote his episode, and belittled the show. He also played Sir Ector, the adoptive father of King Arthur in John Boorman&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;Excalibur&quot;.

In addition to acting, he was a songwriter. Many of his songs were included in his shows &quot;Richard Bucket Overflows: An Audience with Clive Swift&quot;, which toured the UK in 2007, and &quot;Clive Swift Entertains&quot;, in which he performed his own music and lyrics, which toured the UK in 2009. He also played the part of the Reverend Eustacius Brewer in &quot;Born and Bred&quot;, which aired on BBC One from 2002 to 2005. His last performance was in an episode of &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; in 2017, after which he retired.

==Personal life and death==
Swift was married to novelist Margaret Drabble from 1960 until their divorce in 1975. He was the father of one daughter, Rebecca (who died in April 2017), known for running The Literary Consultancy in London, and two sons, Adam Swift, an academic, and Joe Swift, a garden designer, journalist and television presenter.

Swift died at home on 1 February 2019, aged 82, following a short illness. Paying tribute to Swift, fellow actor James Dreyfus said he &quot;loved this extremely talented, subtle actor&quot;. His &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot; co-star Patricia Routledge said: &quot;Clive was a skillful and inventive actor with wide experience, as his successful career proved,&quot; and that she was very sad to hear of her former co-star&#x27;s death.

Swift&#x27;s elder brother David was also an actor.

<text>Ivana Brlić-Mažuranić (; 18 April 1874 – 21 September 1938) was a Croatian writer. She has been praised as the best Croatian writer for children.

==Early life==
She was born on 18 April 1874 in Ogulin into a well-known Croatian family of Mažuranić. Her father Vladimir Mažuranić was a writer, lawyer and historian who wrote &quot;Prinosi za hrvatski pravno-povjestni rječnik&quot; (Croatian dictionary for history and law) in 1882. Her grandfather was the politician, the Ban of Croatia and poet Ivan Mažuranić, while her grandmother Aleksandra Demeter was the sister of well-known writer and one of keypersons of Croatian national revival movement, Dimitrija Demeter. Ivana was largely home-schooled. With the family she moved first to Karlovac, then to Jastrebarsko, and ultimately to Zagreb.

Upon marriage to Vatroslav Brlić, a politician and a prominent lawyer in 1892, she moved to Brod na Savi (today Slavonski Brod) where she entered another known family and lived there for most of her life. She became the mother of seven children and devoted all her work to her family and education. Her first literary creations were initially written in French.

==Work==
Ivana Brlić-Mažuranić started writing poetry, diaries and essays rather early but her works were not published until the beginning of the 20th century. Her stories and articles like the series of educational articles under the name &quot;School and Holidays&quot; started to be published more regularly in the journals after the year 1903.

It was in 1913 when her book &quot;The Marvelous Adventures and Misadventures of Hlapić the Apprentice&quot; (also known as &quot;The Brave Adventures of Lapitch&quot; and &quot;Čudnovate zgode šegrta Hlapića&quot;) was published that really caught the literary public&#x27;s eye. In the story, the poor apprentice Hlapić accidentally finds his master&#x27;s lost daughter as his luck turns for the better.

Her book &quot;Croatian Tales of Long Ago&quot; (&quot;Priče iz davnine&quot;), published in 1916, is among the most popular today in large part because of its adaptation into a computerized interactive fiction product by Helena Bulaja in 2003/2006. In the book Mažuranić created a series of new fairy-tales, but using names and motifs from the Slavic mythology of Croats. It was this that earned her comparisons to Hans Christian Andersen and Tolkien who also wrote completely new stories but based in some elements of real mythology.
Brlić-Mažuranić was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times – in 1931 and 1935 she was nominated by the historian Gabriel Manojlović, and in 1937 and 1938 he was joined by the philosopher Albert Bazala, both based in Zagreb. In 1937 she also became the first woman accepted as a Corresponding Member into the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts. She was awarded Order of Saint Sava.

After a long battle with depression, she committed suicide on 21 September 1938 in Zagreb. She is buried in Mirogoj Cemetery in Zagreb.

=== Translations ===
Her books of novels and fairy tales for children, originally intended to educate her own, have been translated into nearly all European languages. Highly regarded and valued by both national and foreign literary critics, she obtained the title of &quot;Croatian Andersen&quot;.

&quot;The Marvelous Adventures and Misadventures of Hlapić the Apprentice&quot; was translated, among other languages, into Bengali (by Dr. Probal Dashgupta), Hindi, Chinese (by Shi Cheng Tai), Vietnamese (a few chapters), Turkish, Japanese (by Sekoguchi Ken) and Parsi (by Achtar Etemadi). Most of the latter translations were made indirectly, through Esperantists. The book&#x27;s most recent Esperanto translation is by Maja Tišljar, and important part in translations of &quot;Adventures of Hlapić&quot; had Spomenka Štimec, the most important Croatian writer that writes in Esperanto.

== Film ==

In the 1990s, the Croatia Film company adapted Brlić-Mažuranić&#x27;s work &quot;The Marvellous Adventures and Misadventures of Hlapić the Apprentice&quot; as a children&#x27;s animated feature, &quot;Lapitch the Little Shoemaker&quot;. Originally released in 1997, it became Croatia&#x27;s most successful theatrical release, and was its official submission to the 70th Academy Awards (in the Best Foreign Language Film category).

Milan Blažeković, the director of &quot;Lapitch&quot;, has been developing another animated adaptation of her works since 2000, &quot;Tales of Long Ago&quot; (&quot;Priče iz davnine&quot;).

In 2000, Helena Bulaja started an interactive animated project based on her book &quot;Croatian Tales of Long Ago&quot;. The project, which consists of eight animated interactive stories, cartoons and games, was published as two CD-ROMs and a series of book/DVD editions. It was created in Flash by eight independent international teams of animators, illustrators, musicians, programmers, actors etc. from all around the world (US, France, UK, Germany, Russia, Australia, Croatia), whose work was coordinated on the Internet. The unique and innovative project and the animations won several awards at the most famous international festivals of new media and animation, including Flashforward San Francisco, Lucca Comics and Games multimedia award, International Family Film Festival in Hollywood and others. A series of innovative educational iPhone and iPad games based on the project are in development.

<doc id="868898" wikidata="Q6260215" url="?curid=868898" title="John Tamihere">
<text>John Henry Tamihere (born 8 February 1959) is a New Zealand politician, media personality, and political commentator. He was a member of Parliament from 1999 to 2005, including serving as a Cabinet minister in the Labour Party from August 2002 to November 2004. Tamihere ran unsuccessfully for Auckland mayor in the 2019 election. He joined the Māori Party in 2020 and from April to October 2020 was the party&#x27;s co-leader. He became president of the Māori Party in June 2022.

==Early life==
Tamihere was born in Auckland on 8 February 1959, the 11th of 13 children of John Hamil Tamihere and Ruby Elaine Tamihere (née McEwen). Of Māori descent, he affiliates to the Whakatohea and Ngāti Porou ki Hauraki iwi. He is a brother to convicted murderer David Tamihere.

John Tamihere attended St Mary&#x27;s School in Avondale and St Peter&#x27;s College where a teacher named Tom Weal, deputy leader of the Social Credit Political League 1970–1972, had a strong influence on him. Tamihere rated Weal as his most influential teacher, and said that Weal would link things to politics and, in particular, to New Zealand&#x27;s agricultural policies. Weal would emphasise that grass was the most important New Zealand crop, as it was the basis of the wool, meat, and dairy industries. Weal alerted Tamihere to the impact that Britain&#x27;s joining the European Common market would have on New Zealand&#x27;s economy and society. According to Weal, New Zealand would have to wake up quickly to the loss of the relationship with Britain, find new markets and new ways of doing things, and back itself. &quot;The way Mr Weal brought education to life gave me a strong interest in what I call the Kiwi-isation of our society&quot;, wrote Tamihere.

Tamihere gained arts and law degrees from the University of Auckland, being the first person in his family to attend university. After graduating, he became a lawyer, eventually working for the Māori Land Court and the Department of Māori Affairs. In 1991, Tamihere became the chief executive of the Waipareira Trust, a trust that provides health and education services to Māori in the Auckland region. He also served as chairman of the New Zealand Māori Rugby League Board. Tamihere had a relatively high profile before entering politics, having been selected as Person of the Year by &quot;The Sunday Star-Times&quot;, New Zealander of the Year by &quot;North &amp; South&quot; magazine, and Man of the Year by &quot;Metro&quot; magazine.

==Member of Parliament==

=== Election and roles ===
In the 1999 election, Tamihere stood as the Labour Party&#x27;s candidate for the Māori electorate of Hauraki. He won the seat with 60 percent of the vote; his nearest rival gained only 15 percent. He became chairman of the Māori Affairs Select Committee and also served on the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee.

In the 2002 election, Tamihere contested the newly formed Tamaki Makaurau electorate, which he won with 73 percent of the vote. He gained the second-highest majority in a Māori electorate, exceeded only by that of Parekura Horomia, the Minister of Māori Affairs. Tamihere was appointed to Cabinet in 2002. He served as Minister of Small Business, Minister of Youth Affairs, Minister of Statistics, and Minister for Land Information, as well as functioning as Horomia&#x27;s deputy as Associate Minister of Māori Affairs until 2004.

Journalist Vernon Small said that &quot;in the mid-2000s Tamihere was seen as a rising star, and even a potential prime minister&quot;.

=== Foreshore and seabed controversy ===
The foreshore and seabed controversy of 2004–2005 put considerable strain on the Labour Party&#x27;s Māori MPs, with many showing dissatisfaction with the party&#x27;s policy. Two Labour MPs, Tariana Turia and Nanaia Mahuta, chose to vote against Labour&#x27;s legislation, and Turia elected to leave the party. Tamihere, however, eventually voted in favour of the legislation, and defended it from its critics. Tamihere also criticised the new Māori Party established by Turia and her supporters, saying that it would ultimately fail. According to Tamihere, the party&#x27;s leaders belonged &quot;to a relatively wealthy, educated elite&quot;, and did not represent ordinary Maori.

=== Resignation from Ministerial roles ===
In October 2004, Tamihere was accused of dishonest financial dealings, including accepting a &quot;golden handshake&quot; from the Waipareira Trust after stating that he would not take one, and failing to pay tax on this payment. On 15 October 2004, Tamihere requested leave from his Ministerial portfolios; he said that he had &quot;done nothing to bring shame&quot;, but portrayed standing down from his Ministerial roles during the investigation as the &quot;honourable&quot; course. On 22 October, the Waipareira Trust accepted that it, not Tamihere, had the responsibility for tax on any payment, but other allegations relating to the financial management of the Trust persisted. On 3 November Tamihere resigned from his Ministerial portfolios, citing as untenable the retention of his responsibilities during on-going investigations. On 21 December, an official investigation cleared Tamihere of the tax charges, and on 14 March 2005, the Serious Fraud Office cleared him of the charges relating to his stewardship of the Waipareira Trust.

=== Other political controversies while in office ===
On 4 April 2005, the magazine &quot;Investigate&quot; published an interview in which Tamihere insulted the Prime Minister and Cabinet ministers. About Prime Minister Helen Clark he said, &quot;But she&#x27;s no good with emotions. She goes to pieces. She&#x27;ll fold on the emotional side and walk away or not turn up. She knows it&#x27;s going to get emotional and it upsets her. We&#x27;ve never had a great relationship&quot;. Tamihere also made comments regarded as derogatory about other members of the Labour Party: Steve Maharey was called &quot;smarmy&quot; and lacking in substance, and Michael Cullen was depicted as cunning and manipulative. Women were referred to as &quot;front-bums&quot; and the party&#x27;s homosexual MPs were also criticised.

Tamihere denies that the interview he gave was on the record, a claim disputed by the journalist in question. Helen Clark speculated on Tamihere&#x27;s having had a &quot;liquid lunch&quot;, and indicated that a return to cabinet for Tamihere was no longer certain. Tamihere was advised to take leave to consider his position, and began attempting to mend relations with his colleagues.

A week later, however, more comments emerged from the interview. Tamihere was reported as being highly critical of women leaders, saying that they achieved their position through preferential treatment. He also stated that he was &quot;sick and tired of hearing how many Jews got gassed&quot; in the Holocaust, saying that while he found the Holocaust revolting, he believed that repeated mention of it was simply used to make people &quot;feel guilty&quot;. He also alleged that Clayton Cosgrove, previously believed to be one of Tamihere&#x27;s closest allies in the party, had conducted a &quot;nasty&quot; campaign of telephone harassment against Clark and her husband when Clark deposed Mike Moore as party leader in 1993. These latest revelations were regarded by many as the end of Tamihere&#x27;s career within the Labour Party, and Clark indicated that she saw no chance of Tamihere being elected to Cabinet again. The revelation of these comments also ended talk of a potential move to another party, the National Party being frequently mentioned, and also ended attempts by opposition parties in New Zealand to portray Tamihere as a victim of the Labour Party and to use the comments to point out the flaws within the Labour Party. At the Labour Party caucus meeting on 12 April, Tamihere attended despite being placed on stress leave by Clark. He apologised for his comments and was censured by the meeting, but was not asked to resign from the party.

=== Loss of seat ===
In the 2005 election, Tamihere lost his electorate seat to Pita Sharples of the Māori Party and left Parliament. He had previously decided not to seek a list placement, stating that this decision was due to his desire to determine whether he had the &quot;people&#x27;s mandate.&quot;

==Career after Parliament==

=== Return to Waipareira Trust ===
After his election loss, Tamihere sought re-election to the Waipareira Trust. He was voted back onto the board by members of the trust, but the board itself tried to remove him by changing the governance rules. This resulted in a legal case which Tamihere and the four other newly elected board members won. As of 2020 Tamihere is still chief executive of the trust.

In late September 2022, Charities Services general manager Natasha Weight confirmed that the agency was investigating two charities headed by Tamihere, the Waipareira Trust and the National Urban Māori Authority, for financing his 2019 Auckland mayoral and 2020 general election campaigns. Under existing legislation, charities are banned from donating or endorsing political parties or candidates and allowing them to use their resources. According to the Charities Register, Te Whānau o Waipareira Trust Group had provided NZ$385,307 in interest free loans to support Tamihere&#x27;s 2020 election campaign while the National Urban Māori Authority had paid NZ$70,833 to support his 2019 Auckland mayoral campaign and NZ$82,695 payment to support his 2020 election campaign and Māori Party aspirations. In response, Tamihere accused the Charities Services of discriminating against Māori causes and the Māori Party. Tamihere and the Māori Party also confirmed that they would litigate against the Charities Service if the agency ruled against them. In addition, Tamihere criticised &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; journalist Matt Nippert&#x27;s coverage of the two charities&#x27; donations to his election campaigns, which he described as racist. He announced that the Māori Party would be boycotting &quot;The Herald&quot;. 

In May 2023, the Waipareira Trust agreed to cease making political donations and recover funds it had made in interest free loans to its chief executive and Te Pāti Māori President Tamihere. By February 2024, Tamihere had repaid his loan to the Waipareira Trust. This loan had been used to fund his political campaigns. The Charities Service confirmed that it was still continuing its investigation into the Waipareira Trust&#x27;s political donations.

In July 2024, the Charities Service concluded its four year investigation into the Waipareira Trust&#x27;s donations into Tamihere&#x27;s political campaigns and the referred the case to the peak charities regulator, the Charities Registration Board.

=== Radio career and the &quot;Roast Busters&quot; controversy ===
Tamihere previously co-hosted a talkback show, Willie &amp; JT, on Radio Live with Willie Jackson. He is well known for his trenchant political commentaries on television, radio and through other media. Tamihere and Jackson also have a New Zealand current affairs debate-based TV show, &quot;The world according to Willie and JT&quot;. In 2007, Tamihere and Jackson ran for the mayoralties in Waitakere City and Manukau City respectively. Both were unsuccessful, Tamihere finishing second behind the incumbent, Bob Harvey. From 2011 to 2012, he hosted the TV3 show &quot;Think Tank&quot; that dealt with issues affecting New Zealanders and particularly those of importance to Maori.

In November 2013, on RadioLive, Willie Jackson and John Tamihere interviewed a &#x27;friend&#x27; of an alleged rape victim, &quot;Amy&quot;. Amy discussed information she knew about an incident by a group called the &quot;Roast Busters&quot; that was under investigation in New Zealand. Jackson and Tamihere asked her why and how much the girls had been drinking, and why they were out late at night. &quot;The other side comes to it, were they willing drinkers?&quot; They also questioned why the girls, some as young as 13, had not made formal complaints to the police, asked &quot;how free and easy are you kids these days?&quot;, and asked Amy what age she had lost her virginity. They also described the Roast Busters&#x27; actions as &quot;mischief&quot;. Jackson and Tamihere also implied that some young girls who had consensual sex with the young men may now &quot;line up and say they were raped as well&quot;. Amy said she believed those involved were rapists, which was met with a small laugh by the hosts, who then said: &quot;Well if some of the girls have consented that doesn&#x27;t make them rapists, right?&quot; Many on social media were angry with the pair, calling for them to be fired or to step down from their positions. Vodafone, Telecom, Countdown and Briscoes suspended all RadioLive advertising due to the interview. Four other advertisers pulled their campaigns from the station earlier.

On 11 November, the pair stood down from their show for the rest of the year. Jackson returned in early 2014 with new co-host Alison Mau, replacing Tamihere, who did not return. This resulted in Tamihere launching legal action against Mediaworks alleging breach of his contract. Mediaworks eventually settled and apologised.

== Return to politics ==

=== 2014 general election ===
In October 2012, Tamihere made moves to resume his parliamentary career by indicating that he would like to stand again for the Labour Party in the 2014 election, but his name was not on Labour&#x27;s list. On 17 November 2012, Tamihere was barred from the Labour Party Annual Conference after criticising the party for being &quot;too focused on issues like gay marriage&quot;.

=== Local government ===
In the 2013 New Zealand local elections, Tamihere stood successfully for a seat on the board of the Waitakere Licensing Trust, which owns and operates a chain of wholesale liquor outlets and bars in West Auckland. He also stood, but narrowly missed out, for a seat on the Waitemata District Health Board, which also covers the North Shore and Rodney areas. Tamihere said that he did &quot;very well in West Auckland but just could not carry the North Shore votes.&quot; He said that he did no campaigning for either post, such as attending public meetings, putting up placards or handing out pamphlets, preferring to &quot;just put my name on the ballot to see what happens&quot;. Tamihere did not seek election to any local government positions in 2016.

Tamihere ran unsuccessfully for Auckland mayor in the 2019 election. Tamihere came second, with 22% of the vote. He used the term &quot;Sieg Heil&quot; during a debate. After Goff stated &quot;We won&#x27;t put up with the sort of nonsense that we get from racists coming into this country to tell us that multiculturalism doesn&#x27;t work,&quot; Tamihere responded, &quot;I say sieg heil to that.&quot; After the debate, Tamihere initially denied using the term, then stated his comments were a criticism of Goff&#x27;s decision to bar Canadian visitors Stefan Molyneux and Lauren Southern from using an Auckland Council venue for an event in 2018, calling Goff &quot;a dictator&quot;. Also during the campaign, Tamihere made a complaint over three social media posts posted by Phil Goff, but the complaints were rejected by the Advertising Standards Authority.

=== 2020 general election ===
In 2020, Tamihere joined the Māori Party, and in April 2020 he was announced as the party&#x27;s co-leader along with Debbie Ngarewa-Packer. Tamihere was the Māori Party&#x27;s candidate for the electorate of Tāmaki Makaurau and was seventh on the party list.

Tamihere said he would vote yes in the 2020 New Zealand cannabis referendum that was held alongside the 2020 general election, but would rather cannabis was only decriminalised rather than legalised. He narrowly failed to unseat incumbent Labour MP for Tamaki Makaurau Peeni Henare and did not enter Parliament. His son-in-law Rawiri Waititi won Waiariki and, as the only Maori Party MP who successfully contested an electorate in 2020, automatically replaced him as male co-leader of the party.

=== President of the Māori Party ===
On 8 June 2022, Tamihere succeeded Che Wilson as president of the Māori Party. 

=== 2023 general election ===
During the 2023 New Zealand general election, Tamihere contested the Te Atatū electorate for the Māori Party. He came fifth place, with Labour&#x27;s Phil Twyford winning the electorate. Though Tamihere was not elected into Parliament, the Māori Party won six of the seven Māori electorates.

In early June 2024, Stuff journalist Andrea Vance published two reports alleging that staff at the Manurewa Marea in the Tāmaki Makaurau electorate had illegally collected personal data obtained during the 2023 New Zealand census collection and COVID-19 immunisation drives for political campaigning purposes by Te Pāti Māori during the 2023 general election. Former marae workers also alleged that Census participants were given vouchers and gifts to encourage them to switch to the Māori roll. Manurewa Marae CEO Takutai Moana Kemp had successfully contested Tāmaki Makaurau as a Te Pāti Māori candidate during the 2023 election. In addition, the Labour Party complained that Tamihere&#x27;s Waipareira Trust used a text code to encourage COVID-19 vaccine recipients to vote for Te Pāti Māori during the 2023 election. Statistics New Zealand launched an investigation into the alleged data breaches. 

In response, Tamihere claimed that the census data misuse allegations were made by disgruntled former marae employees. Following second allegations, Tamihere denounced the allegations as baseless and claimed that the party was being targeted by opponents for speaking up for Māori. Tamihere also accused Destiny Church leader Brian Tamaki of attempting to take over Manurewa Marae. Former Māori academic Rawiri Taonui has disputed the allegations against Waipareira Trust, Te Pāti Māori and Manurewa Marae; arguing that photocopies of census data were taken solely for verification purposes and destroyed, highlighting that Statistics New Zealand had clarified that neither Tamihera, the Waipareira Trust and the Whanau Ora Commissioning Agency had access to their database, disputing that vouchers were used to encourage people to switch to the Māori electoral roll, and denying that Māori Party flyers were included in wellbeing packs. Taonui also claimed that the whistleblowers were connected to Destiny Church and had instigated the allegations against Manurewa Marae and Te Pāti Māori following a failed attempt by the church to take over the marae. 

On 22 January 2025, a Statistics New Zealand investigation cleared the Whanau Ora Commissioning Agency of data breaches during the 2023 Census, finding that the agency increased Māori participation. The report made nine recommendations to improve Statistics NZ&#x27;s procedures and referred allegations against Manurewa Marae to the Privacy Commissioner. The report also found no evidence that one of the alleged whistleblowers had attempted to contact Statistics NZ regarding allegations against the marae.

==Views and opinions==
Tamihere has a high public profile, much of it derived from his beliefs on a number of issues. He has made a significant impact in Māori politics by campaigning on behalf of &quot;Urban Māori&quot;, who often have no remaining links to their iwi or hapū (tribe or sub-tribal grouping). According to Tamihere, traditional structures such as iwi do not reflect the reality of modern Māori life, and have proven inadequate for solving today&#x27;s problems. Tamihere has condemned modern iwi organisations as &quot;new feudal tribal constructs&quot;, dominated by an elite group far removed from the majority of Maori. These comments have angered many prominent Māori leaders, but won him considerable popularity with ordinary Māori voters, as well as with a large measure of non-Māori supporters.

Tamihere has also attracted both criticism and praise for his views on Māori self-sufficiency. According to Tamihere, too many Māori &quot;blam[e] others for our failure&quot;, and Māori need to &quot;take responsibility for our own actions&quot;. This has placed him at odds with Māori politicians such as Willie Jackson, who accuse Tamihere of &quot;victim-blaming&quot;. Tamihere, however, claims that the &quot;victim mentality&quot; holds Māori back, and that Māori need to abandon it if they wish to improve their living standards.

Tamihere has expressed concern that the National-led coalition government&#x27;s boot camp programme would fail without long-term support. He said &quot;the kids loved it because it wasn;t about a boot camp. It was about the discipline of working out how discipline works within a structured environment these kids had never been part of. You&#x27;ve got to watch because as soon as they come out of that you&#x27;ve got to put them on a staircase. Unless you are micromanaging that staircase all the way through they fall off and they fall deeper.&quot;

==Other controversies==
Tamihere was convicted for three drink driving and other driving offences between 1978 and 1995, according to the &quot;National Business Review&quot;.

In May 2005, Tamihere was cautioned by the New Zealand SPCA after he left two cats when he moved house. Neighbours said the cats had been left without food or water for eleven days and the New Zealand Herald reported that the two cats were discovered with feline immunodeficiency virus.

In April 2013, Tamihere made headlines when he removed a wheel clamp himself.

In April 2020, two doctors walked off the job at a COVID-19 testing clinic in West Auckland, after claims Tamihere told his staff to lie in order to meet the criteria to get tested for COVID-19. The clinic is operated by the Waipareira Trust, for which Tamihere is the chief executive. Tamihere refused an interview request and said it was an employment matter.

<text>Eusebius of Vercelli (c. 2 March 283 – 1 August 371) was a bishop from Sardinia and is counted a saint. Along with Athanasius, he affirmed the divinity of Jesus against Arianism.

==Biography==
Eusebius was born in Sardinia, in 283. After his father&#x27;s martyrdom, he was taken to Rome by his mother, where he later became a lector. He became the first bishop in Vercelli (in northern Italy), probably sometime in the early- to mid-340s. According to a letter of Ambrose to the congregation in Vercelli two decades after Eusebius&#x27; death, the local leaders recognized his piety and thus elected him rather than local candidates (&quot;Epistola lxiii, Ad Vercellenses&quot;). Inspired by St Athanasius&#x27;s &quot;Life of St Anthony&quot;, he founded a priestly community in Vercelli that resembled a monastic community. This coenobium, in turn, inspired others such as Gaudentius of Novara, Eustasius of Aosta, and Maximus of Turin. He was the first bishop to live in common with the clergy, devoting his best energies to form them in piety and zeal. For this reason, the Canons Regular of St. Augustine honour him along with Augustine as their founder.

In 354, Pope Liberius asked Eusebius to join Bishop Lucifer of Cagliari in carrying a request to the Emperor Constantius II at Milan, pleading for the emperor to convoke a council to end the dissensions over the status of Athanasius of Alexandria and the matter of Arianism. The synod was held in Milan in 355. Eusebius attended part of the council, but refused to condemn Athanasius and so was exiled, first to Scythopolis in Syria, under the watchful eye of the Arian bishop Patrophilus, whom Eusebius calls his jailer, then to Cappadocia, and lastly to the Thebaid, in Upper Egypt. Several letters surrounding the council written to or by Eusebius still survive, as do two letters written by him during his exile.

In the latter place, Eusebius was dragged through the streets and persecuted in many ways but never gave up the Catholic faith. Upon the accession of Julian, the exiled bishops were free to return to their sees. Eusebius passed through Alexandria and there attended Athanasius&#x27; synod of 362 which confirmed the divinity of the Holy Spirit and the orthodox doctrine concerning the Incarnation. The synod also agreed both to deal mildly with the repentant bishops who had signed Arianizing creeds under pressure and to impose severe penalties upon the leaders of several of the Arianizing factions.

While still on his way home, Eusebius took the synod&#x27;s decisions to Antioch and hoped to reconcile the schism there. The church was divided between adherents of Eustathius of Antioch, who had been deposed and exiled by the Arians in 331, and those of the Meletians. Since Meletius&#x27; election in 361 was brought about chiefly by the Arians, the Eustathians would not recognize him, although he solemnly proclaimed his orthodox faith after his episcopal consecration. The Alexandrian synod had desired that Eusebius should reconcile the Eustathians with Bishop Meletius, by purging his election of whatever might have been irregular in it, but Eusebius found that Lucifer of Cagliari had also passed that way, and had unilaterally consecrated Paulinus, the leader of the Eustathians, as Bishop of Antioch.

Unable to reconcile the factions, he continued towards home, visiting other churches along the way in the interest of promulgating and enforcing the orthodox faith. Once back in Vercelli in 363, he continued to be a leader with Hilary of Poitiers in defeating Arianism in the Western Church, and was one of the chief opponents of the Arian bishop Auxentius of Milan. He died in 370 or 371.
Although in the Middle Ages he was sometimes referred to as a martyr, this was more to honour the sufferings he endured in standing up for his faith. Later legends of his martyrdom have no historical basis. The Roman Catholic Church celebrates his feast on 2 August. His former feast day of 16 December roughly coincided with his elevation as bishop. His current feast day roughly coincides with the anniversary of his death. Vercelli Cathedral is dedicated to him.

In a General Audience in October 2007, Pope Benedict XVI observed, Therefore, Pastors, Eusebius said, must urge the faithful not to consider the cities of the world as their permanent dwelling place but to seek the future city, the definitive heavenly Jerusalem. This &quot;eschatological reserve&quot; enables Pastors and faithful to preserve the proper scale of values without ever submitting to the fashions of the moment and the unjust claims of the current political power. The authentic scale of values – Eusebius&#x27; whole life seems to say – does not come from emperors of the past or of today but from Jesus Christ...

==Works==
* Three short letters of Eusebius are printed in Migne, &quot;Pat.Lat.&quot;, XII, 947-54 and X, 713-14. 
* Jerome (&quot;Of Famous Men&quot;, c. lvi, and Epistle lxi, n. 2) ascribes to him a Latin translation of a commentary on the Psalms, written originally in Greek by Eusebius of Caesarea; but this work has been lost. 
* In the cathedral at Vercelli is preserved the &quot;Codex Vercellensis&quot;, the earliest manuscript of the old Latin Gospels (&quot;Codex a&quot;), which was believed to have been written by Eusebius, though now scholars tend to doubt it. 
* Krüger (&quot;Lucifer, Bischof von Calaris&quot;, Leipzig, 1886, 118–30) ascribes to Eusebius a baptismal oration by Caspari (&quot;Quellen sur Geschichte des Taufsymbols&quot;, Christiania, 1869, II, 132-40).
* The confession of faith &quot;Des. Trinitate confessio&quot;, &quot;P.L.&quot;, XII, 959–968, sometimes ascribed to Eusebius, is spurious.

<text>Slava Raškaj (; 2 January 1877 – 29 March 1906) was a Croatian painter, considered to be the greatest Croatian watercolorist of the late 19th and early 20th century. Deaf since birth, Raškaj was schooled in Vienna and Zagreb, where her mentor was the renowned Croatian painter Bela Čikoš Sesija. In the 1890s her works were exhibited around Europe, including at the 1900 Expo in Paris. In her twenties Raškaj was diagnosed with acute depression and was institutionalised for the last three years of her life before dying in 1906 from tuberculosis in Zagreb. The value of her work was largely overlooked by art historians in the following decades, but in the late 1990s and early 2000s interest in her work was revived.

==Biography==

Slava was born as Friderika Slavomira Olga Raškaj on 2 January 1877 into a middle class family (her mother Olga ran the local post office which was at the time a prestigious administrative position) in the town of Ozalj in present-day Croatia (at the time in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, a subdivision within Austria-Hungary). Olga liked painting in her free time and she passed her love for arts very early on to both her daughters Slava and Paula (Paula later worked as a schoolteacher in Orahovica and also continued to paint casually in adulthood).
When she was eight, Salva was sent to Vienna to enroll at a school for deaf people where she first learned to draw. Her drawings from that period mainly depict casts of classical sculptures drawn in pencil or ink (two of these drawings survived and are kept on display at the Croatian School Museum at Republic of Croatia Square in Zagreb). During her time in Vienna she also learned German and French and in later years moved on to watercolor and gouache techniques before returning to Ozalj in 1893.

Upon her return, the local schoolteacher Ivan Muha-Otoić noticed her artistic talent and urged her parents to send her to Zagreb for further art instructions at the renowned painter Vlaho Bukovac&#x27;s atelier in 1895 (as Bukovac was a friend of Muha-Otoić). Once in Zagreb, Bukovac refused to help her but then Bela Čikoš Sesija took her in and began instructing her in his own studio in 1896. She spent the next few years working with Sesija - she lived at what was then the State Institute for Deaf-mute Children () on Ilica Street, and she used a local morgue as her studio (in the meantime her former teacher from Ozalj Ivan Muha-Otoić became director of the Institute in 1895).

Raškaj&#x27;s repertoire was peculiar at the time - she painted somewhat macabre paintings of still life, watercolors with unusual objects such as a starfish, a silver jewelry chest, and even more interesting, pairs of objects such as a red rose and an owl, or a lobster and a fan.
In the late 1890s she started painting &quot;en plein air&quot;, depicting outdoor scenes from the Zagreb Botanical Garden, Maksimir Park and other parks in the city, featuring somewhat lighter tones and colors. In 1899 she returned to her hometown of Ozalj and continued to paint outdoors, which was also unusual at the time. Her most valuable paintings were all created in the 1890s, including works such as &quot;Self-portrait&quot;, &quot;Spring in Ozalj&quot;, &quot;The Old Mill&quot; and others. Her works were first publicly exhibited at the Art Pavilion in Zagreb soon after it opened in 1898, where six of her watercolors were presented along with the works of renowned painters such as Menci Klement Crnčić and Vlaho Bukovac. Her paintings were also exhibited in Saint Petersburg, in Moscow and at the &quot;Exposition Universelle&quot; in Paris in 1900, where five of her paintings were shown.

In 1900 first symptoms of depression began to appear. She was hospitalised but soon after that she was released for home care. However, her condition deteriorated further and Slava was eventually institutionalised at a psychiatric hospital in Stenjevec in 1902. She completely stopped painting in her last years, and died on 29 March 1906 from tuberculosis.
==Legacy==

The first exhibition dedicated to her work took place in 1957 in Zagreb. Her impressionist watercolors painted after 1900 are considered among the best of Croatian art.

A Croatian film about her controversial relationship with Sesija titled &quot;100 Minutes of Glory&quot; directed by Dalibor Matanić was released in 2004, and a grand retrospective exhibition featuring 185 of her works opened at the Klovićevi Dvori Gallery in Zagreb between May and August 2008.

In December 2000 the Croatian National Bank issued a silver commemorative coin depicting Slava Raškaj, in their Famous Croatian Women series (&quot;Znamenite Hrvatice&quot;), along with children&#x27;s writer Ivana Brlić-Mažuranić and the 17th-century noblewoman Katarina Zrinska.

The Slava Raškaj Educational Centre, in Zagreb, specializes in inclusive practical and vocational education for deaf students and those with communication impairments.

<doc id="868926" wikidata="Q7641000" url="?curid=868926" title="Sunraysia Television">
<text>Sunraysia Television was a publicly listed company which owned Channel Nine Perth&#x27;s parent company &quot;Swan Television and Radio Broadcasters&quot; from 1989 to 2007. Although listed on the ASX, Sunraysia had been majority owned by Eva Presser&#x27;s Sabtel (between 44 and 50 per cent) with WIN Corporation owning another 43.65% of the company.

==History==
Sunraysia Television has its origins in the area around Mildura, known as Sunraysia. It operated a single television licence, STV-8. In 1985, the station was purchased by Eva Presser.

In 1989, Sunraysia acquired Channel Nine Perth from Bond Media who were forced to sell it due to cross-media ownership laws restricting national audience reach. They paid A$95 million for the station. As part of the deal, it also sold STV-8 to Bond Media for $18 million, which was then onsold to ENT Ltd. for the same price.

In 1994, following a failed takeover bid for Sunraysia, Kerry Stokes sold his 21.2 per cent stake to Bruce Gordon&#x27;s WIN Corporation which already held 19.9 per cent. Mrs Presser was quoted as calling the Stokes bid &quot;uninvited, unnecessary, unwanted, unspectacular&quot; and that her rejection wof the bid was &quot;unequivocal&quot;.

==Selling of &quot;Nine Perth&quot;==
In February 2007, PBL Media announced that it would acquire 100% of &quot;Swan Television and Radio Broadcasters&quot; from Sunraysia for $136.4 million. However, after protest from WIN Corporation owner Bruce Gordon, who was offering Sunraysia a revised $163.1 million, it was announced months later on 21 April that the board of Sunraysia would now endorse WIN&#x27;s revised offer.
 The sale went through on 8 June 2007.

==Sunraysia &amp; the Pressers==
Eva&#x27;s husband Dan is executive chairman of family company, Sabrands. Sabrands runs the Sunraysia Natural Beverages company, which similarly has no ties to the Sunraysia region, and since 2013 has owned the iconic Rosella business. The Pressers use &quot;Sunraysia&quot; as their personal brand name, which some may see as ironic given the name was also used in a 1920s dried fruit advertising campaign, for the Australian Dried Fruits Association - an entity with no connection to the Pressers.

<text>Penny Arcade (born Susana Carmen Ventura, July 15, 1950) is an American performance artist, actress, and playwright based in New York City. She is known for her comedic wit, forthright delivery, and stage presence. Her performances explore topics such as gentrification, humanity, womanhood, LGBT culture, nostalgia, family history, and the life of the outsider. Additionally, Penny Arcade is known for her association with underground arts and culture.

==Early years==
Susana Ventura was born in New Britain, Connecticut, and grew up in a working class Italian immigrant family. Her father fell ill from a severe beating he endured at Ellis Island in 1946 and in 1953 he was committed to Connecticut Valley Hospital in Middletown, Connecticut, where he died 12 years later of a heart attack at age 50. Arcade and her three siblings were raised by Arcade&#x27;s mother, who worked as a seamstress in local sweatshops. The family was presided over by her maternal grandparents, both born in the 19th century in a remote Southern Italian village of Picerno, Basilicata.

As a child, Arcade did not plan to become a performance artist. In her working-class Italian-American family, there &quot;just wasn&#x27;t a format for that,&quot; she explained.

Of her early social experiences, Arcade described, &quot;I was perceived to be this girl that everyone had slept with when I was 12 -- no one anyone knew, but they had heard.&quot; At age 13, she ran away from home and spent 4 weeks homeless in Old Saybrook, Connecticut. During this time, she was brought to juvenile court and sentenced to two years at the Sacred Heart Academy for Wayward Girls, a reform school run by the semi-cloistered Sisters Of The Good Shepherd. It was there that Arcade wrote her first play at age 14. At age 16, Arcade left home and spent the summer of 1967 homeless in Provincetown, Massachusetts, before ultimately moving to New York City.

==Early career==

Arcade adopted the name &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; after an LSD trip with her mentor Jamie Andrews, who took her into his home when she moved to New York. It was Andrews who introduced Arcade to John Vacarro.

Ventura&#x27;s association with avant-garde performance began at age 17, when she became a member of John Vaccaro&#x27;s Playhouse of the Ridiculous. In 1968, she appeared in painter Larry Rivers film &quot;T.I.T.S.&quot; In 1969, she starred in the Jackie Curtis play &quot;Femme Fatale&quot; at La MaMa Etc. with Curtis, Mary Woronov, Jayne County and Patti Smith, followed by a small role in the Paul Morrissey / Andy Warhol film, &quot;Women in Revolt&quot;. In 1970, Arcade was featured in her first interview in &quot;Rags Magazine&quot;, an alternative fashion magazine.

== Time in Europe ==
At age 20, Arcade left New York for Europe, where she lived for a decade. In 1971, Arcade turned down a role in the London production of Andy Warhol&#x27;s play &quot;Pork&quot;, choosing instead to join Vaccaro and The Playhouse of the Ridiculous in Amsterdam. After eight months in Amsterdam, she moved to the island of Formentera in Spain&#x27;s Balearic Islands. She has described her time in Europe as fodder for a &quot;...great and scandalous memoir...drinking with sailors as a bargirl, starting a school for the children of drug smugglers, befriending and being befriended by Robert Graves at the end of his life... well, it goes on.&quot;

== Return to New York ==
Arcade returned to New York City in 1981 to appear in The Playhouse of The Ridiculous&#x27;s remounting of their 1970 hit &quot;Night Club&quot; by Kenneth Bernard for LaMama&#x27;s 20th anniversary at Ellen Stewart&#x27;s request. She worked with underground theatre artists, including Jack Smith, Charles Ludlam, and the founder of The Cockettes and Angels of Light, Hibiscus. In the spring of 1982 she improvised her first performance piece in Hibiscus’s show &quot;Tinsel Town Tirade&quot; at Theater for The New City, receiving her first writer&#x27;s credit.

In February 1985, Arcade presented her first full-length evening of original improvised work, &quot;While You Were Out,&quot; at the Poetry Project, and then presented it at Performance Space 122 in June later that same year. &quot;While You Were Out&quot; then moved to University of The Streets in November 1985 and continued to run for an additional four months.

Penny Arcade was featured in 1988 &quot;Vogue Magazine&quot;&#x27;s &quot;People Are Talking About&quot; issue, the first mention of performance art in a national fashion magazine. In the late 1980s, she created a character named Margo Howard-Howard, a 50-year-old drag queen with a scandalous past, for her performances. The &quot;New York Times&quot; refers to the character as &quot;patently unbelievable&quot;, but in a later article acknowledges that her monologue was &quot;based on real Lower East Side residents.&quot; Howard-Howard received an obituary in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;.
Premiering in 1990 at Performance Space 122, and running off broadway at The Village Gate 1992-1993 Arcade began touring internationally in 1993 with her most presented show, &quot;Bitch! Dyke! Faghag! Whore!&quot;, an opinionated commentary on sexuality and censorship that features a chorus of professional erotic dancers and strippers which created the international neo performance burlesque movement In 1998 she performed at the first Gay Shame event at DUMBA in Brooklyn; she appears in the documentary film of the event by Scott Berry, entitled &quot;Gay Shame &#x27;98&quot;.
She co-starred with Quentin Crisp in the long-running performance/interview piece, &quot;The Last Will and Testament of Quentin Crisp&quot;

Arcade&#x27;s 2002 performance &quot;New York Values&quot;, which also toured abroad, addressed the loss of cultural identity in New York during the Giuliani years. The Village Gate marquee in New York is still adorned with her name and the title of her performance piece &quot;Politics, Sex &amp; Reality&quot;, although the nightclub no longer exists.

Arcade is a co-founder of the Lower East Side Biography Project, &quot;Stemming The Tide Of Cultural Amnesia, with long time collaborator Steve Zehentner, a video production and oral history that began as a workshop that trains participants in documentary filmmaking and preserves the stories of Lower Manhattan artists and activists. profiled individuals have included Judith Malina, Lee Breuer, Tom O&#x27;Horgan, Sarah Schulman, Betty Dodson, Quentin Crisp, ], Jayne County,Danny Fields and Marty Matz, among others.

In 2002 Arcade ran for the New York State Assembly as a candidate of the Green Party. She received 1,054 votes out of 32,976 in the 74th Assembly district, losing to incumbent and anti-rent control advocate Steven Sanders.

In January 2011 Arcade had an on-stage spat with performance artist Ann Liv Young while she was hosting an evening of performances and Young refused to respect the artists who were waiting to take their turn on stage . 
In 2012 she took up residence at London&#x27;s Arcola Theatre for a 22 performance run of her show &quot;Bitch! Dyke! Faghag! Whore!&quot; which went on to run for 48 performances in London with 48 standing ovations.

In 2013 Arcade starred along with Mink Stole in a revival of Tennessee Williams one-act play, &quot;The Mutilated&quot;. The production was directed by Cosmin Chivu with music by Jesse Selengut, and previewed at the eighth annual Provincetown Tennessee Williams Theater Festival in Massachusetts, prior to its six-week run in New York at the New Ohio Theatre in the West Village where it was nominated for a Drama League Award as Best Revival.

==Personal life==
Penny Arcade has been married three times. Her third marriage in 1998 was to singer-writer-composer Chris Rael, with whom she collaborated artistically. The couple lived together until January 2008. Arcade identifies as bisexual.

He is well known for playing loveable slob Onslow in the British sitcom &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot; (1990–1995) and &quot;Twiggy&quot; in the sitcom &quot;The Royle Family&quot;, playing the part from 1998 to 2008.

From 2001 to 2005 he played conman and rogue businessman Vernon Scripps in the ITV police drama &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, taking over as the show&#x27;s main rogue from Bill Maynard&#x27;s Claude Greengrass, and returning to the programme briefly in 2007.

==Life and career==
Hughes was born in Wallasey, Cheshire, to Ada (née Tulloch) and Bill Hughes. He had one younger brother, Gordon. He was brought up in Liverpool, where he attended Ranworth Square Primary School. He then went to Abbotsford Secondary Modern School in Norris Green, Liverpool. He started his acting career in repertory at the Victoria Theatre in Stoke-on-Trent and soon made his West End debut in the Lionel Bart and Alun Owen musical &quot;Maggie May&quot;. His other West End productions included the stage version of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Say Goodnight to Grandma&quot;, &quot;The Secret Life of Cartoons&quot; and several series of &quot;Run For Your Wife&quot;.

<text>The Scudder Falls Bridge is a toll bridge that carries Interstate 295 (I-295) over the Delaware River, connecting Lower Makefield Township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, with the Scudders Falls section of Ewing Township in Mercer County, New Jersey, United States. It is maintained by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission (DRJTBC). The original bridge was a plate girder bridge constructed from 1958 to 1961, and the current structure is a box-girder bridge that partially opened in 2019 and was substantially complete in 2021. Previously, the bridge was a toll-free crossing. However, this changed on July 14, 2019, when an all-electronic toll was levied for Pennsylvania-bound traffic; the toll can be paid using E-ZPass or Toll-by-Plate.

A $534 million replacement project for the bridge was completed, which involved widening I-295 in the area from four lanes to eight, and reconstruction of the interchanges at both ends of the bridge. The first span of the new bridge opened to Pennsylvania-bound traffic on July 10, 2019. New Jersey-bound traffic was moved onto the new span on July 24, 2019, and demolition of the old span began afterwards. The downstream span was opened to New Jersey-bound traffic on August 18, 2021. As well, a shared-use path for bicycle and foot-traffic opened on November 16, 2021.

==Name==

The Scudder Falls Bridge derives its name from Richard Betts Scudder, who according to the Long Island Genealogy Surname Database, died in 1754 at &quot;Scudder&#x27;s Falls, Hunterdon County&quot; (portions of Mercer County were part of Hunterdon County until 1838). One of Richard Scudder&#x27;s ancestors from Kent, England, was named Henry Skudder. The &quot;k&quot; in the surname apparently became a &quot;c&quot; at some point in time, helping to give the falls and modern-day bridge its name. The &quot;falls&quot; (really just an area of rapids) are located about 1/2 mile north of the bridge, and the entrance to the Delaware and Raritan Canal State Park just north of the bridge is signed as the &quot;Scudders Falls&quot; unit. The extra &quot;s&quot; at the end of &quot;Scudders&quot; was dropped to make pronunciation of the bridge&#x27;s name easier.

==Original bridge==

Following the destruction of the Yardley–Wilburtha Bridge in the August flood of 1955, plans were made to build a new bridge about north of the old site. The DRJTBC was responsible for the construction of the bridge, while New Jersey and Pennsylvania built the approaches to each side. Because the bridge was not originally part of the Interstate Highway System, the cost of construction was not 90% covered by the federal government. Instead, they covered 50% of the cost of the new span, while New Jersey and Pennsylvania paid the remaining 50% of the total bill, as with an ordinary U.S. Highway route.

In April 1958, the location of the future Scudder Falls Bridge was approved with little opposition. Construction, overseen by the DRJTBC, began in May of the same year and was completed in 1959. The new bridge, which had cost $8.4 million, opened to traffic on June 22, 1961. The Yardley-Wilburtha Bridge was rebuilt as a temporary crossing before the Scudder Falls Bridge began being built. It was completely torn down in 1961 when the Scudder Falls Bridge opened. The bridge was built using two-span continuous steel-plate girders. Its two end spans were each long, while each of the eight middle spans measured . The bridge consisted of a roadway wide, split into four twelve-foot lanes. Opposing traffic was separated by a Jersey barrier. The bridge&#x27;s total length was . The Scudder Falls Bridge originally carried I-95 over the Delaware River. In March 2018, I-95 was renumbered to I-295 across the bridge as part of the Pennsylvania Turnpike/Interstate 95 Interchange Project that completed the gap in I-95.

==Replacement bridge==
Starting in 2003, the DRJTBC began working on plans to replace the bridge, improve the safety and traffic flow of its two immediately adjoining interchanges (Taylorsville Road in Pennsylvania and Route 29 in New Jersey), and widen the Pennsylvania approach to the bridge (from four lanes to six). The project was deemed necessary because despite only being 42 years old, the original configurations of the bridge, interchanges and roadways suffered from numerous inadequacies. Design standards called for, at minimum, the addition of an inside shoulder wide (adding to its original width) and an outside shoulder wide (adding to its original width). The closely spaced interchanges on both ends of the bridge required the addition of acceleration and deceleration lanes (the Commission refers to them as &quot;auxiliary lanes&quot;), of which there were previously none.

According to the DRJTBC&#x27;s 2002 Southerly Crossings Corridor Study, the Scudder Falls Bridge carried roughly 55,000 vehicles per day (traffic counts have increased since then), well beyond the design load of 40,000 vehicles per day. By 2030, traffic volumes were expected to increase by 35%, the equivalent of 19,000 additional vehicles. This amount of traffic would require two to perhaps four additional travel lanes (24 to 48 additional feet of roadway width).

Also mentioned by the 2002 study is that Scudder Falls Bridge had been given a Level of Service (LOS) grade of &quot;F&quot; during peak rush hours and afternoons. This grade denotes the worst service conditions and the highest congestion rate. At times other than brief rush hour delays, traffic traveling the bridge was relatively light. The condition of the bridge had also been a growing concern in the following years. Even though routine inspections had not revealed any serious structural problems, the bridge, at over 50 years old, was past the end of its structural service life. The bridge was also similar in design to the Mianus River Bridge in Greenwich, Connecticut, which suffered a fatal collapse in 1983, further inflating concerns about the structural integrity of the old bridge.
The replacement bridge consists of six through-travel lanes and three auxiliary lanes (two in the New Jersey-bound direction and one in the Pennsylvania-bound direction) to handle traffic accelerating onto the bridge or decelerating off of the bridge at the two closely spaced adjoining interchanges. It also has shoulders to handle vehicle breakdowns and emergencies, with the two inside shoulders being wide enough to handle proposed regional bus-rapid transit service. A bicycle/pedestrian facility was added to the upstream side of the new bridge. On July 10, 2019, the upstream span of the new bridge opened to Pennsylvania-bound traffic. New Jersey-bound traffic remained on the original span until July 24, after which demolition of the original span began and construction of the new downstream span began; it opened just over two years later on August 18, 2021.

To help finance this multi-faceted improvement project, the DRJTBC voted in late December 2009 to establish tolling at the crossing. Tolls were implemented on July 14, 2019, four days after the new bridge span opened to traffic. Tolls are collected from traffic crossing into Pennsylvania, with an all-electronic toll gantry consisting of E-ZPass transponder readers and high-resolution cameras (no cash toll booths) constructed on the bridge. The DRJTBC has stated that the introduction of cashless tolling at the bridge is necessary to help finance its capital program, of which the multi-faceted Scudder Falls Bridge Replacement Project would be its largest single construction initiative in its 75-year history. The commission is funded solely by tolls collected at its eight current toll bridges; it receives no gasoline tax revenues or state or federal support. Commission executives have stated that it would be unfair to have the project financed solely by motorists using its other toll bridges, individuals who have been subsidizing the Scudder Falls facility already for more than two decades.

The shared-use path on the bridge is the only one of its kind across the Delaware River crossing from Pennsylvania-to-New Jersey, in that it allows cyclists to ride across without dismounting. This bridge also restores pedestrian/cyclist access to cross the bridge in the Yardley area, which had been previously unavailable since the 1955 destruction of the Yardley-Wilburtha bridge.

<text>Anthony Francis Lucas (born Antun Lučić; September 9, 1855 – September 2, 1921) was a Croatian-born American oil explorer. With Pattillo Higgins, he organized the drilling of an oil well near Beaumont, Texas, that became known as Spindletop. This led to the widespread exploitation of oil and the start of the Petroleum Age.

==Early life==
Christened Antonio Francesco Luchich, he was the son of Captain Francis Stephen Luchich, a prosperous shipbuilder and shipowner from the Croatian island of Lesina, and his wife Giovanna Giovanizio. According to Lucas himself, who was proud of his heritage, the Luchich family was pure by blood, descended from ancient Illyrian (Dalmatian) nobility, and he sometimes called himself in society events &quot;Count Anthony [François Maria Vincent] Giovanizio de Bertuchevich Lucas&quot;. Born in the Austrian Empire city of Split, his family moved to Trieste, where his father served in the Austro-Hungarian navy.

At the age of 20, Lucas completed studies at the Polytechnical Institute (Technische Hochschule) in Graz, Austria, and became an engineer. After graduating from the Austrian Naval Academy of Pula and Rijeka, Lucas was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1878.

==Move to the United States==
In 1879, Lucas visited his uncle in Saginaw, Michigan, and started work in a sawmill, improving the design of a gang saw then in use. In 1883, he started working in the Colorado, California and North Carolina gold, copper, silver and iron mining industries. He changed his name to Anthony Francis Lucas, receiving his naturalization papers on May 9, 1885, at Norfolk, Virginia. He married Caroline Weed Fitzgerald in 1887. They moved to Washington, D.C. in 1888, where Lucas worked as a mechanical and mining engineer, except for a two year break prospecting for gold in Colorado. Their son Anthony FitzGerald was born on 21 July 1889.

==Career==
In 1893, Lucas started to work as a salt mine superintendent for Myles and Company of New Orleans. The damaged mine was located at Petite Anse (Avery Island), and over the next three years, Lucas restored operations.

Lucas drilled and explored for salt on Jefferson Island for Joseph Jefferson, and Belle Isle, where he discovered the relationship between salt deposits, sulfur, natural gas, and oil deposits. In Lucas&#x27; words, &quot;This led me to study the accumulation of oil around salt masses, and I formed additional plans for prospecting other localities. Thus I began my investigations into the occurrence of oil on the Coastal Plain.&quot; In 1898, Lucas mined salt on Grand Côte, Weeks Island, and Anse la Butte, having by then become an expert on salt domes.

===Lucas Gusher===

In 1899, Lucas visited the Sour Spring Mound south of Beaumont, Texas, with Pattillo Higgins. This was the future site of Spindletop. Lucas noted, &quot;This mound attracted my attention on account of the contour, which indicated possibilities for an incipient dome below, and because at the apex of it there were exudations of sulphuretted hydrogen gas. This has suggested to me, in the light of my experience at Belle Isle, that it might prove a source of either sulphur or oil, or both.&quot; Lucas then signed a lease agreement with the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company, and a separate agreement with Higgins.

Using a rotary drilling rig from Louisiana, Lucas began his well in August or September 1899, reaching a depth of in Dec. At a depth of , the casing collapsed, but only after a layer of oil sand was found.

Short on money, Lucas sought funding from any source, including Henry Folger of Standard Oil, but to no avail. Lucas received an opportunity when Dr. William Battle Phillips, geologist for the University of Texas and the Texas State Mineral Survey, endorsed Lucas&#x27; dome theory, and wrote a letter of introduction to John H. Galey. Galey, with his partner James M. Guffey, put together financing with Andrew Mellon, allowing Lucas to drill three wells deep. Lucas also retained 12.5 percent of the deal. Galey further recommended that the Hamill brothers, Al, Curt, and Jim, drill the well.

After reaching the depth of , on 10 January 1901, mud and water erupted followed by a stream of crude oil reaching . The eruption lasted nine days, flowing between 70,000 and 100,000 barrels per day, before the Lucas Gusher was finally brought under control.

Beaumont became a boomtown. Yet, tiring of his loss of privacy, in May 1901, Lucas sold his stock in the Guffey Petroleum Company, and continued his scientific search for oil in the United States and Mexico.

==Legacy==
The Lucas Gusher helped revolutionize world fuel use and transformed the economy of southeast Texas. It helped further the development of the combustion engine automobile since significant amounts of energy were needed for fuel. The city of Houston become the national center of the oil industry, with the United States surpassing Russia as the world&#x27;s leading producer.

Anthony Francis Lucas is considered to be the founder of modern petroleum reservoir engineering. He later served as a consulting engineer in Romania, Russia, Mexico, Algeria, as well as in the United States. As a successful businessman and expert in mining, Lucas was the lifelong chairman of the American Committee for Oil and Gas.

==Inventions and applications==
A number of Lucas inventions and scientific or technical knowledge were used in early oil exploration and extraction, with most still being employed. Some are:
* overhead method of mining in salt mines
* surface exploration for underground mineral deposits
* application of steam-driven, hydraulic-rotary drilling rig and of mud in oil well drilling
* construction and application of back pressure valve
* construction of blowout preventers
* designing of well logs
* invention of the Christmas tree oil well

==Heritage==
Lucas died on September 2, 1921, in Washington, D.C. He was often mistakenly described as Austrian, sometimes even as a Trieste-born Italian. On his grave in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C., he is described as being of Illyric origin, which was the standard term for Croatian at the time.

In 1936, the American Institute for Geological and Metallurgical Investigations founded the Anthony F. Lucas Gold Medal for development in the area of oil exploration. A museum with a granite obelisk was built to honor the explorer about which is inscribed: &quot;On this spot on the tenth day of the twentieth century a new era in civilization began.&quot; A street and an elementary school in Beaumont, Texas, bear his name.

<doc id="868933" wikidata="Q1946268" url="?curid=868933" title="International trade law">
<text>International trade law includes the appropriate rules and customs for handling trade between countries. However, it is also used in legal writings as trade between private sectors. This branch of law is now an independent field of study as most governments have become part of the world trade, as members of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Since the transaction between private sectors of different countries is an important part of the WTO activities, this latter branch of law is now part of the academic works and is under study in many universities across the world.

==Overview==
International trade law should be distinguished from the broader field of international economic law. The latter could be said to encompass not only WTO law, but also law governing the international monetary system and currency regulation, as well as the law of international development.

The international trade law includes rules, regulations and customs governing trade between nations. International trade law is the tool used by the nation’s government for taking corrective actions against trade. International trade law focuses on applying domestic rules to international trade rules and applying treaty-based international trade law governing trade.

The body of rules for transnational trade in the 21st century was derived from medieval commercial laws called the &quot;lex mercatoria&quot; and &quot;lex maritima&quot;—respectively, &quot;the law for merchants on land&quot; and &quot;the law for merchants on the sea.&quot; Modern trade law (extending beyond bilateral treaties) began shortly after the Second World War, with the negotiation of a multilateral treaty to deal with trade in goods: the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).

International trade law is based on theories of economic liberalism developed in Europe and later the United States from the 18th century onwards.

International Trade Law is an aggregate of legal rules of &quot;international legislation&quot; and new lex mercatoria, regulating relations in international trade. &quot;International legislation&quot; – international treaties and acts of international intergovernmental organizations regulating relations in international trade.
lex mercatoria – &quot;the law for merchants on land&quot;. Alok Narayan defines &quot;lex mercatoria&quot; as &quot;any law relating to businesses&quot; which was criticised by Professor Julius Stone.
and 
lex maritime – &quot;the law for merchants on sea. Alok in his recent article criticised this definition to be &quot;too narrow&quot; and &quot;merely-creative&quot;. Professor Dodd and Professor Malcolm Shaw of Leeds University supported this proposition.

The Lex Mercatoria is the grouping of legal rules that guide and underlie international trade, which acts totally independently of the positive law of states, being considered normative. Currently, the new Lex Mercatoria has been prepared. The former Lex Mercatoria was generated in light of the characteristic demands of the time in question, including the values, culture, and future provisions of the time, whereas, the new one is recognized as having the responsibility of common international trade law.

==World Trade Organization==
In 1995, the World Trade Organization, a formal international organization to regulate trade, was established.

The purposes and structure of the organization are governed by the &quot;Agreement Establishing The World Trade Organization&quot;, also known as the &quot;Marrakesh Agreement&quot;. It does not specify the actual rules that govern international trade in specific areas. These are found in separate treaties, annexed to the Marrakesh Agreement.

The scope of WTO:

(a) provide a framework for administration and implementation of agreements;
(b) forum for further negotiations;
(c) trade policy review mechanism; and
(d) promote greater coherence among members economics policies

Principles of the WTO:

(a) A principle of non-discrimination (most-favored-nation treatment obligation and the national treatment obligation)
(b) market access (reduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade) 
(c) balancing trade liberalization and other societal interests
(d) harmonization of national regulation (TRIPS agreement, TBT agreement, SPS agreement)

==Trade in goods==
The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT) has been the backbone of international trade law since 1948 after the charter for international trade had been agreed upon in Havana. It contains rules relating to &quot;unfair&quot; trading practices—dumping and subsidies. Many things impacted GATT like the Uruguay Round and the North American Free Trade Agreement.

In 1994 the World Trade Organization (WTO) was established to take the place of the GATT. This is because the GATT was meant to be a temporary fix to trade issues, and the founders hoped for something more concrete. It took many years for this to come about, however, because of the lack of money. The British Economy was in crisis and there was not much backing from Congress to pass the new agreement.

The idea of these agreements (WTO and GATT) was to create an equal field for all countries in trade. This way all countries got something of equal value out of the trade. This was a difficult thing to do since every country has a different economy size. This led to the Trade Expansion act of 1962.

== Principles of International Trade Laws ==

* National Treatment Principle: Imported and locally-produced goods should be treated equally—at least after the foreign goods have entered the market. The same should apply to foreign and domestic services, and to foreign and local trademarks, copyrights and patents. These principles apply to trade in goods, trade in services as well as trade related aspects of intellectual property rights.
* Most Favored Nation (MFN) Principle: The MFN principles ensures that every time a WTO Member lowers a trade barrier or opens up a market, it has to do so for the like goods or services from all WTO Members, without regard of the Members’ economic size or level of development. The MFN principle requires to accord to all WTO Members any advantage given to any other country. A WTO Member could give an advantage to other WTO Members, without having to accord advantage to non- Members but only WTO Members benefit from the most favorable treatment.

==Trade and intellectual property==
The World Trade Organization Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement required signatory nations to raise intellectual property rights (also known as intellectual monopoly privileges). This arguably has had a negative impact on access to essential medicines in some nations such as less developed countries, as the local economy is not as capable of producing more technical products such as pharmaceuticals.

==Cross-border transactions==

Cross-border operations are subject to taxation by more than one country. Commercial activity that occurs among several jurisdictions or countries is called a cross-border transaction. Those involved in any international business development or international trade should be knowledgeable in tax law, as every country enforces different laws on foreign businesses. International tax planning ensures that cross-border businesses stay tax compliant and avoid or lessen double taxation.

==Dispute settlement==

Most prominent in the area of dispute settlement in international trade law is the WTO dispute settlement system. The WTO dispute settlement body is operational since 1995 and has been very active since then with 369 cases in the time between 1 January 1995 and 1 December 2007. Nearly a quarter of disputes reached an amicable solution, in other cases the parties to the dispute resorted to adjudication. The WTO dispute settlement body has exclusive and compulsory jurisdiction over disputes on WTO law (Article 23.1 Dispute Settlement Understanding).

<doc id="868936" wikidata="Q753063" url="?curid=868936" title="Paris Gun">
<text>The Paris Gun () was a type of German long-range siege gun, several of which were used to bombard Paris during World War I. They were in service from March to August 1918. When the guns were first employed, Parisians believed they had been bombed by a high-altitude Zeppelin, as the sound of neither an airplane nor a gun could be heard. They were the largest pieces of artillery used during the war by barrel length, and qualify under the (later) formal definition of large-calibre artillery.
Also called the &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm Geschütz&quot; (&quot;Kaiser Wilhelm Gun&quot;), they were often confused with Big Bertha, the German howitzer used against Belgian forts in the Battle of Liège in 1914; indeed, the French called them by this name as well. They were also confused with the smaller &quot;Langer Max&quot; (Long Max) cannon, from which they were derived. Although the famous Krupp-family artillery makers produced all these guns, the resemblance ended there.

As military weapons, the Paris Guns were not a great success: the payload was small, the barrel required frequent replacement, and the guns&#x27; accuracy was good enough for only city-sized targets. The German objective was to build a psychological weapon to attack the morale of the Parisians, not to destroy the city itself.

==Description==
Due to the weapon&#x27;s apparent total destruction by the Germans in the face of the final Entente offensives, its capabilities are not known with full certainty. Figures stated for the weapon&#x27;s size, range, and performance varied widely depending on the source—not even the number of shells fired is certain. In the 1980s, a long note on the gun was discovered and published. This was written by Dr. Fritz Rausenberger (in German), the Krupp engineer in charge of the gun&#x27;s development, shortly before his death in 1926. Thanks to this, the details of the gun&#x27;s design and capabilities were considerably clarified.

The gun was capable of firing a shell to a range of and a maximum altitude of —the greatest height reached by a human-made projectile until the first successful V-2 flight test in October 1942. At the start of its 182-second flight, each shell from the Paris Gun reached a speed of .

The distance was so far that the Coriolis effect—the rotation of the Earth—was substantial enough to affect trajectory calculations. The gun was fired at an azimuth of 232 degrees (southwest) from Crépy-en-Laon, which was at a latitude of 49.5 degrees north.

Seven barrels were constructed. They used worn-out 38 cm SK L/45 &quot;Max&quot; long gun barrels that were fitted with an internal tube that reduced the caliber from to . The tube was long and projected out of the end of the gun, so an extension was bolted to the old gun-muzzle to cover and reinforce the lining tube. A further, long smooth-bore extension was attached to the end of this, giving a total barrel length of . This smooth section was intended to improve accuracy and reduce the dispersion of the shells, as it reduced the slight yaw a shell might have immediately after leaving the gun barrel produced by the gun&#x27;s rifling. The barrel was braced to counteract barrel drop due to its length and weight, and vibrations while firing; it was mounted on a special rail-transportable carriage and fired from a prepared, concrete emplacement with a turntable. The original breech of the old gun did not require modification or reinforcement.

Since it was based on a naval weapon, the gun was manned by a crew of 80 Imperial Navy sailors under the command of Vice-Admiral Maximilian Rogge, chief of the Ordnance branch of the Admiralty. It was surrounded by several batteries of standard army artillery to create a &quot;noise-screen&quot; chorus around the big gun so that it could not be located by French and British spotters.

The projectile flew significantly higher than projectiles from previous guns. Writer and journalist Adam Hochschild put it this way: &quot;It took about three minutes for each giant shell to cover the distance to the city, climbing to an altitude of at the top of its trajectory. This was by far the highest point ever reached by a man-made object, so high that gunners, in calculating where the shells would land, had to take into account the rotation of the Earth. For the first time in warfare, deadly projectiles rained down on civilians from the stratosphere&quot;. This reduced drag from air resistance, allowing the shell to achieve a range of over .

The unfinished V-3 cannon would have been able to fire larger projectiles to a longer range, and with a substantially higher rate of fire. The unfinished Iraqi super gun would also have been substantially bigger.

==Projectiles==
The Paris Gun shells weighed . The shells initially used had a diameter of and a length of . The main body of the shell was composed of thick steel, containing of TNT.

The small amount of explosive—around 6.6% of the weight of the shell—meant that the effect of its shellburst was small for the shell&#x27;s size. The thickness of the shell casing, to withstand the forces of firing, meant that shells would explode into a comparatively small number of large fragments, limiting their destructive effect. A crater produced by a shell falling in the Tuileries Garden was described by an eyewitness as being across and deep.

The shells were propelled at such a high velocity that each successive shot wore away a considerable amount of steel from the rifled bore. Each shell was sequentially numbered according to its increasing diameter, and had to be fired in numeric order, lest the projectile lodge in the bore and the gun explode. Also, when the shell was rammed into the gun, the chamber was precisely measured to determine the difference in its length: a few inches off would cause a great variance in the velocity, and with it, the range. Then, with the variance determined, the additional quantity of propellant was calculated, and its measure taken from a special car and added to the regular charge. After 65 rounds had been fired, each of progressively larger caliber to allow for wear, the barrel was sent back to Krupp and rebored with a new set of shells.

The shell&#x27;s explosive was contained in two compartments, separated by a wall. This strengthened the shell and supported the explosive charge under the acceleration of firing. One of the shell&#x27;s two fuzes was mounted in the wall, with the other in the base of the shell. The fuzes proved very reliable as every single one of the 303 shells that landed in and around Paris successfully detonated.

The shell&#x27;s nose was fitted with a streamlined, lightweight, ballistic cap and the side had grooves that engaged with the rifling of the gun barrel, spinning the shell as it was fired so its flight was stable. Two copper driving bands provided a gas-tight seal against the gun barrel during firing.

==Use in World War I==

The Paris gun was used to shell Paris at a range of . The gun was fired from a wooded hill (Le mont de Joie) near Crépy, and the first shell landed at 7:18 a.m. on 23 March 1918 on the &quot;Quai de la Seine&quot;, the explosion being heard across the city. Shells continued to land at 15-minute intervals, with 21 counted on the first day. On the first day, fifteen people were killed and thirty-six wounded. The effect on morale in Paris was immediate: by 27 March, queues of thousands had started at the Gare d&#x27;Orsay and, at the Gare Montparnasse, ticket sales out of the capital were suspended due to demand.

The initial assumption was these were bombs dropped from an airplane or Zeppelin flying too high to be seen or heard, or perhaps an &quot;aerial torpedo&quot;. Within a few hours, sufficient casing fragments had been collected to show that the explosions were the result of shells, not bombs. By the end of the day, military authorities were aware the shells were being fired from behind German lines by a new long-range gun, although there was initial press speculation on the origin of the shells. This included the theory they were being fired by German agents close by Paris, or even within the city itself, so abandoned quarries close to the city were searched for a hidden gun. Another possibility was that German forces had penetrated the front line, but authorities realized that such heavy artillery could not be moved and emplaced so quickly.

The press reported the German gun&#x27;s range as about , which amazed American ordnance officers, and the shells as , compared to the caliber of heavy German siege shells. The previous world distance record was German bombardment of Dunkirk from , while the best American gun had a range of . Experts thought that the German weapon might be a product of the Škoda Works. Three emplacements for the gun were located within days by the French reconnaissance pilot Didier Daurat, the path of the shells which landed in Paris having revealed the direction from which they were being fired. The closest emplacement was engaged by a 34 cm railway gun while the other two sites were bombed by aircraft, although this failed to interrupt the German bombardment.

Between 320 and 367 shells were fired, at a maximum rate of around 20 per day. The shells killed 250 people and wounded 620, and caused considerable damage to property. The worst incident was on 29 March 1918, when a shell hit the roof of the St-Gervais-et-St-Protais Church, collapsing the roof onto the congregation then hearing the Good Friday service. A total of 91 people were killed and 68 were wounded. There was no firing between 25 and 29 March, when the first barrel was being replaced; an unconfirmed intelligence report claimed that it had exploded. Barrels were probably changed again between 7–11 April and again between 21–24 April. The diameter of the later shells increased from , indicating that the used barrels had been re-bored.
A further emplacement, later identified as specifically designed for the Paris Gun, was found by advancing US troops at the beginning of August, on the north side of the wooded hill at Coucy-le-Château-Auffrique, some from Paris.

The gun was taken back to Germany in August 1918 as Allied advances threatened its security. No guns were ever captured by the Allies. It is believed that near the end of the war they were completely destroyed by the Germans. One spare mounting was captured by American troops in Bruyères-sur-Fère, near Château-Thierry, but the gun was never found; the construction plans seem to have been destroyed as well.

==After World War I==

Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, the Germans were required to turn over a complete Paris Gun to the Allies, but they never complied with this.

In the 1930s, the German Army became interested in rockets for long-range artillery as a replacement for the Paris Gun—which was specifically banned under the Versailles Treaty. This work eventually led to the V-2 rocket that was used in World War II.

Despite the ban, Krupp continued theoretical work on long-range guns. They started experimental work after the Nazi government began funding the project upon coming to power in 1933. This research led to the 21 cm K 12 (E), a refinement of the Paris Gun design concept. Although it was broadly similar in size and range to its predecessor, Krupp&#x27;s engineers had significantly reduced the problem of barrel wear. They also improved mobility over the fixed Paris Gun by making the K 12 a railway gun.

The first K 12 was delivered to the German Army in 1939 and a second in 1940. During World War II, they were deployed in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France; they were used to shell Kent in Southern England between late 1940 and early 1941. One gun was captured by Allied forces in the Netherlands in 1945.

==In popular culture==
A parody of the Paris Gun appears in the Charlie Chaplin movie &quot;The Great Dictator&quot;. Firing at the Cathedral of Notre Dame, the &quot;Tomanians&quot; (the fictional country that represented Germany) succeed in blowing up a small outhouse.

The destruction of the St-Gervais-et-St-Protais Church inspired Romain Rolland to write his novel &quot;Pierre et Luce&quot;.

<text>Grand Coulee is an ancient river bed in the U.S. state of Washington. This National Natural Landmark stretches for about 60 miles (100 km) southwest from Grand Coulee Dam to Soap Lake, being bisected by Dry Falls into the Upper and Lower Grand Coulee.

==Geological history==
Grand Coulee is a large coulee on the Columbia River Plateau. This area has underlying granite bedrock, formed deep in the Earth&#x27;s crust 40 to 60 million years ago. The land periodically uplifted and subsided over millions of years giving rise to some small mountains and, eventually, an inland sea.

From about 10 to 18 million years ago, a series of volcanic eruptions from the Grand Ronde Rift near the Idaho/Oregon/Washington/Montana border began to fill the inland sea with lava. In some places the volcanic basalt is thick. In other areas granite from the earlier mountains is still exposed.

Starting about two million years ago, during the Pleistocene epoch, glaciation took place in the area. Large parts of northern North America were repeatedly covered with glacial ice sheets, at times reaching over in thickness. Periodic climate changes resulted in corresponding advances and retreats of ice.

About 18,000 years ago a large finger of ice advanced into present-day Idaho, forming an ice dam known as the Purcell lobe at what is now Lake Pend Oreille. The Purcell lobe blocked the Clark Fork River drainage, thus creating an enormous lake reaching far back into mountain valleys of western Montana. Leaks may have developed around and under the ice, causing the dam to fail. The of water in Lake Missoula was released in just 48 hours—a torrential flood equivalent to ten times the combined flow of all the rivers in the world.

This mass of water and ice, high near the ice dam before release, flowed across the Columbia Basin, moving at speeds of up to . The deluge stripped away soil, cut deep canyons and carved out of earth, leaving behind areas of stark scabland.

Over nearly 2500 years the cycle was repeated many times. Most of the displaced soil created new landforms, but some was carried far out into the Pacific Ocean. In Oregon&#x27;s Willamette Valley, as far south as Eugene, the cataclysmic flood waters deposited fertile soil and icebergs left numerous boulders from as far away as Montana and Canada. At present day Portland, the water measured deep. A canyon deep is carved into the far edge of the continental shelf. The web-like formation can be seen from space. Mountains of gravel as tall as 40-story buildings were left behind; boulders the size of small houses and weighing many tons were strewn about the landscape.

Grooves in the exposed granite bedrock are still visible in the area from the movement of glaciers, and numerous erratics are found in the elevated areas to the northwest of the coulee.

Early theories suggested that glaciers diverted the Columbia River into what became the Grand Coulee and that normal flows caused the erosion observed. In 1910 Joseph T. Pardee described a great Ice Age lake, &quot;Glacial Lake Missoula&quot;, a glacier dammed lake with water up to deep, in northwest Montana and in 1940 he reported his discovery that giant dunes high and feet apart had formed the lake bed. In the 1920s, J Harlen Bretz looked deeper into the landscape and put forth his theory of the dam breaches and massive glacial floods from Lake Missoula.

Of the Channeled Scablands, Dry Falls, one of the largest waterfalls ever known, is an excellent example (south of Banks Lake).

It is probable that humans were witnesses, and victims, of the immense power of the Ice Age Floods. Archeological records date human presence back to nearly the end of the Ice Age, but the raging torrents erased the land of clear evidence, leaving us to question who, if anyone, may have survived. With the end of the last glacial advance, the Columbia settled into its present course. The river bed is about below the Grand Coulee. Walls of the coulee reach in height.

==Upper Coulee==
Grand Coulee is the longest and deepest of eastern Washington canyons. Its unique characteristics include a lower floor at the head of the channel than at its outlet and the widest and highest dry falls cliff in the middle. It was created through the process of cataract recession, which included a cataract twice as high as its existing Dry Falls.

Grand Coulee is two canyons, with an open basin in the middle. The Upper Coulee, filled by Banks Lake, is long with walls tall. It links to the Columbia River at Grand Coulee Dam and leads southward, through the surrounding highlands. The entry to the coulee is above the Columbia. It began as the course of a Glacial Columbia River. The Cordilleran ice sheet&#x27;s Okanogan lobe extended southward across the Columbia Rivers pathway and onto the southern plateau creating an ice dam. This dam backed up the waters of the Columbia into Glacial Lake Columbia and later during the Missoula Floods forced those waters into eastern Washington, creating the Scablands.

The river at Grand Coulee found no existing valley and thus forged its own pathway across the divide, creating the Upper Coulee. The plateau is not level, but is marked with wrinkles and upfolds of the basalt. The diverted waters of the Columbia encountered the monoclinal flexure, a steep warping up of toward the northwest. Lake Columbia topped the ridge at the higher side of the flexure. Encountering the steep slope of the monocline, the new river would have cascaded off the rim, down onto a broad plain where Coulee City and Dry Falls State Park now stand.

===Waterfall erosion===

Upper Grand Coulee began as an cascade just north of Coulee City. As the rush of water eroded the surface, it steepened into a waterfall. The falls continued to erode backward (northward) creating the canyon. When the falls reached the divide into Lake Columbia, i.e., preglacial Columbia Valley, it disappeared, leaving the elongated notch. Today, the waters of the Lake Roosevelt are pumped from the Grand Coulee Dam, into Banks Lake to act as an Equalizing Reservoir and irrigation water source.

Evidence of the waterfalls includes a plunge basin where the falls began, immediately south of Coulee City. It contains at least of gravel lower than the open flooring of the land. The river above the falls was shallow and much wider than the gorge. Thus, it wrapped around the lip of the main falls creating lateral falls. These flowed until the recession of the main falls denied them water. Northrup Canyon in Steamboat Rock State Park contains a dry cataract as wide as Niagara Falls and three times as high. Steamboat Rock, high and a in area, now stands as an isolated rise, but for a time it created two cataracts.
When the falls passed north of Steamboat Rock, it found a granite base beneath the basal flows. Granite lacks the close vertical joints of basalt and resisted the erosion from the cataract&#x27;s plunge. It remains as hills on the broad floor of the Coulee. Some gravel-bar deposits are visible along the Route 155. They provide evidence of eddies in the lee of rock shoulders.

==Lower Coulee==
Dry Falls is at the head of Lower Grand Coulee. The Great Cataract forms the divide from the upper to lower coulees. The Lower Coulee tends along the monoclinal flexure to Soap Lake where the canyons end and the water flowed out into Quincy Basin. Quincy Basin is filled with the eroded gravels and silts from the Coulee. The Lower Coulee also created its own path across the plains. Evidence of this is found in the tilted flows visible at Hogback islands in Lake Lenore and tilted flows along Washington 17 from Dry Falls to Park Lake. Numerous canyons acted as a distribution system for the volume of water flowing out of the upper coulee. The distribution begins in the uncanyoned basin below Dry Falls and expanded to over before reaching Quincy Basin. One cataract (Unnamed Coulee) is high and had three alcoves over more than . There is no channel as the water arrived in a broad sheet.
The gravel deposits of Quincy Basin represent only a third or a fourth of the estimated 11 cubic miles of rock excavated from the Grand Coulee and its smaller other related coulees (Dry, Long Lake, Jasper, Lenore, and Unnamed). Most of the debris was carried on through and beyond Quincy Basin.

The Ephrata Fan (a.k.a. &quot;&quot;) is a gravel fan formed when floodwaters from the lower Grand Coulee entered the Quincy Basin during the formation of the Scablands.

==Modern uses==
The area surrounding the Grand Coulee is shrub-steppe habitat, with an average annual rainfall of less than . The Lower Grand Coulee contains Park, Blue, Alkali, Lenore, and Soap lakes. Until recently, the Upper Coulee was dry. The Columbia Basin Project changed this in 1952, using the ancient river bed as an irrigation distribution network. The Upper Grand Coulee was dammed and turned into Banks Lake. The lake is filled by pumps from the Grand Coulee Dam and forms the first leg of a irrigation system. Canals, siphons, and more dams are used throughout the Columbia Basin, supplying over of farm land.

Water has turned the Upper Coulee and surrounding region into a haven for wildlife, including bald eagle. Recreation is a side benefit and includes several lakes, mineral springs, hunting and fishing, and water sports of all kinds. Sun Lakes and Steamboat Rock state parks are both found in the Grand Coulee. However, the lake has also flooded a large area of natural habitat and native hunting grounds, displacing local Native Americans.

<text>Stationary steam engines are fixed steam engines used for pumping or driving mills and factories, and for power generation. They are distinct from locomotive engines used on railways, traction engines for heavy steam haulage on roads, steam cars (and other motor vehicles), agricultural engines used for ploughing or threshing, marine engines, and the steam turbines used as the mechanism of power generation for most nuclear power plants.

They were introduced during the 18th century and widely made for the whole of the 19th century and most of the first half of the 20th century, only declining as electricity supply and the internal combustion engine became more widespread.

==Types of stationary steam engine==

There are different patterns of stationary steam engines, distinguished by
the layout of the cylinders and crankshaft:
*Beam engines have a rocking beam providing the connection between the vertical cylinder and crankshaft.
*Table engines have the crosshead above the vertical cylinder and the crankshaft below.
*Horizontal engines have a horizontal cylinder.
*Vertical engines have a vertical cylinder.
*Inclined engines have an inclined cylinder.
*Undertype engines are distinguished by having a locomotive-style boiler over top of a horizontal engine. 

Stationary engines may be classified by secondary characteristics as well:
*High-speed engines are distinguished by fast-acting valves.
*Corliss engines are distinguished by special rotary valve gear.
*Uniflow engines have admission valves at the cylinder heads and exhaust ports at the midpoint.

When stationary engines had multiple cylinders, they could be classified as:
*Simple engines, with multiple identical cylinders operating on a common crankshaft.
*Compound engines which use the exhaust from high-pressure cylinders to power low-pressure cylinders.

An engine could be run in simple or condensing mode:
* Simple mode meant the exhaust gas left the cylinder and passed straight into the atmosphere
* In condensing mode, the steam was cooled in a separate cylinder, and changed from vapour to liquid water, creating a vacuum that assisted with the motion. This could be done with a water-cooled plate that acted as a heat sink, or pumping-in a spray of water.

Stationary engines may also be classified by their application:
*Pumping engines are found in pumping stations.
*Mill engines to power textile mills
*Winding engines power various types of hoists.
*Refrigeration engines are typically coupled to ammonia compressors.

Stationary engines could be classified by the manufacturer
*Boulton &amp; Watt
*George Saxon &amp; Co

<doc id="868953" wikidata="Q939364" url="?curid=868953" title="Congenital heart defect">
<text>A congenital heart defect (CHD), also known as a congenital heart anomaly, congenital cardiovascular malformation, and congenital heart disease, is a defect in the structure of the heart or great vessels that is present at birth. A congenital heart defect is classed as a cardiovascular disease. Signs and symptoms depend on the specific type of defect. Symptoms can vary from none to life-threatening. When present, symptoms are variable and may include rapid breathing, bluish skin (cyanosis), poor weight gain, and feeling tired. CHD does not cause chest pain. Most congenital heart defects are not associated with other diseases. A complication of CHD is heart failure.

Congenital heart defects are the most common birth defect. In 2015, they were present in 48.9 million people globally. They affect between 4 and 75 per 1,000 live births, depending upon how they are diagnosed. In about 6 to 19 per 1,000 they cause a moderate to severe degree of problems. Congenital heart defects are the leading cause of birth defect-related deaths: in 2015, they resulted in 303,300 deaths, down from 366,000 deaths in 1990.
The cause of a congenital heart defect is often unknown. Risk factors include certain infections during pregnancy such as rubella, use of certain medications or drugs such as alcohol or tobacco, parents being closely related, or poor nutritional status or obesity in the mother. Having a parent with a congenital heart defect is also a risk factor. A number of genetic conditions are associated with heart defects, including Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, and Marfan syndrome. Congenital heart defects are divided into two main groups: cyanotic heart defects and non-cyanotic heart defects, depending on whether the child has the potential to turn bluish in color. The defects may involve the interior walls of the heart, the heart valves, or the large blood vessels that lead to and from the heart.
Congenital heart defects are partly preventable through rubella vaccination, the adding of iodine to salt, and the adding of folic acid to certain food products. Some defects do not need treatment. Others may be effectively treated with catheter based procedures or heart surgery. Occasionally a number of operations may be needed, or a heart transplant may be required. With appropriate treatment, outcomes are generally good, even with complex problems.

==Signs and symptoms==

Signs and symptoms are related to type and severity of the heart defect. Symptoms frequently present early in life, but it is possible for some CHDs to go undetected throughout life. Some children have no signs while others may exhibit shortness of breath, cyanosis, fainting, heart murmur, under-development of limbs and muscles, poor feeding or growth, or respiratory infections. Congenital heart defects cause abnormal heart structure resulting in production of certain sounds called heart murmur. These can sometimes be detected by auscultation; however, not all heart murmurs are caused by congenital heart defects.

===Associated conditions===
Congenital heart defects are associated with an increased incidence of seven other specific medical conditions, together being called the VACTERL association:
* V — Vertebral anomalies
* A — Anal atresia
* C — Cardiovascular anomalies
* T — Tracheoesophageal fistula
* E — Esophageal atresia
* R — Renal (Kidney) and/or radial anomalies
* L — Limb defects

Ventricular septal defect (VSD), atrial septal defect (ASD), and tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) are the most common congenital heart defects seen in the VACTERL association. Less common defects in the association are persistent truncus arteriosus and transposition of the great arteries.

==Causes==
The cause of congenital heart disease may be genetic, environmental, or a combination of both.

===Genetic===

Genetic mutations, often sporadic, represent the largest known cause of congenital heart defects. They are described in the table below.

====Molecular pathways====

The genes regulating the complex developmental sequence have only been partly elucidated. Some genes are associated with specific defects. A number of genes have been associated with cardiac manifestations. Mutations of a heart muscle protein, α-myosin heavy chain (MYH6) are associated with atrial septal defects. Several proteins that interact with MYH6 are also associated with cardiac defects. The transcription factor GATA4 forms a complex with the TBX5 which interacts with MYH6. Another factor, the homeobox (developmental) gene, NKX2-5 also interacts with MYH6. Mutations of all these proteins are associated with both atrial and ventricular septal defects; In addition, NKX2-5 is associated with defects in the electrical conduction of the heart and TBX5 is related to the Holt–Oram syndrome which includes electrical conduction defects and abnormalities of the upper limb. The Wnt signaling co-factors BCL9, BCL9L and PYGO might be part of these molecular pathways, as when their genes are mutated, this causes phenotypes similar to the features present in Holt-Oram syndrome. Another T-box gene, TBX1, is involved in velo-cardio-facial syndrome DiGeorge syndrome, the most common deletion which has extensive symptoms including defects of the cardiac outflow tract including tetralogy of Fallot.

The notch signaling pathway, a regulatory mechanism for cell growth and differentiation, plays broad roles in several aspects of cardiac development. Notch elements are involved in determination of the right and left sides of the body plan, so the directional folding of the heart tube can be impacted. Notch signaling is involved early in the formation of the endocardial cushions and continues to be active as the develop into the septa and valves. It is also involved in the development of the ventricular wall and the connection of the outflow tract to the great vessels. Mutations in the gene for one of the notch ligands, &quot;Jagged1&quot;, are identified in the majority of examined cases of arteriohepatic dysplasia (Alagille syndrome), characterized by defects of the great vessels (pulmonary artery stenosis), heart (tetralogy of Fallot in 13% of cases), liver, eyes, face, and bones. Though less than 1% of all cases, where no defects are found in the &quot;Jagged1&quot; gene, defects are found in &quot;Notch2&quot; gene. In 10% of cases, no mutation is found in either gene. For another member of the gene family, mutations in the &quot;Notch1&quot; gene are associated with bicuspid aortic valve, a valve with two leaflets instead of three. &quot;Notch1&quot; is also associated with calcification of the aortic valve, the third most common cause of heart disease in adults.

Mutations of a cell regulatory mechanism, the Ras/MAPK pathway are responsible for a variety of syndromes, including Noonan syndrome, LEOPARD syndrome, Costello syndrome and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome in which there is cardiac involvement. While the conditions listed are known genetic causes, there are likely many other genes which are more subtle. It is known that the risk for congenital heart defects is higher when there is a close relative with one.

===Environmental===
Known environmental factors include certain infections during pregnancy such as rubella, drugs (alcohol, hydantoin, lithium and thalidomide) and maternal illness (diabetes mellitus, phenylketonuria, and systemic lupus erythematosus). Alcohol exposure in the father also appears to increase the risk of congenital heart defects.

Being overweight or obese increases the risk of congenital heart disease. Additionally, as maternal obesity increases, the risk of heart defects also increases. A distinct physiological mechanism has not been identified to explain the link between maternal obesity and CHD, but both pre-pregnancy folate deficiency and diabetes have been implicated in some studies.

===Twins and Multiple Births===
Congenital heart defects happen more often in twins than in single babies. Monochorionic twins, who share a placenta, have a greater risk of these heart defects compared to dichorionic twins, who have their own placentas. A systematic review and meta-analysis of four studies conducted in 2007 showed a 9-fold increase in CHD risk in MC twins compared to singletons.

==Mechanism==

There is a complex sequence of events that result in a well formed heart at birth and disruption of any portion may result in a defect. The orderly timing of cell growth, cell migration, and programmed cell death (&quot;apoptosis&quot;) has been studied extensively and the genes that control the process are being elucidated.
Around day 15 of development, the cells that will become the heart exist in two horseshoe shaped bands of the middle tissue layer (mesoderm), and some cells migrate from a portion of the outer layer (ectoderm), the neural crest, which is the source of a variety of cells found throughout the body. On day 19 of development, a pair of vascular elements, the &quot;endocardial tubes&quot;, form. The tubes fuse when cells between then undergo programmed death and cells from the first heart field migrate to the tube, and form a ring of heart cells (myocytes) around it by day 21. On day 22, the heart begins to beat and by day 24, blood is circulating.

At day 22, the circulatory system is bilaterally symmetrical with paired vessels on each side and the heart consisting of a simple tube located in the midline of the body layout. The portions that will become the atria and will be located closest to the head are the most distant from the head. From days 23 through 28, the heart tube folds and twists, with the future ventricles moving left of center (the ultimate location of the heart) and the atria moving towards the head.

On day 28, areas of tissue in the heart tube begin to expand inwards; after about two weeks, these expansions (the membranous &quot;septum primum&quot; and the muscular &quot;endocardial cushions&quot;) fuse to form the four chambers of the heart. A failure to fuse properly will result in a defect that may allow blood to leak between chambers. After this happens, cells that have migrated from the neural crest begin to divide the bulbus cordis. The main outflow tract is divided in two by the growth of a spiraling septum, becoming the great vessels—the ascending segment of the aorta and the pulmonary trunk. If the separation is incomplete, the result is a &quot;persistent truncus arteriosus&quot;. The vessels may be reversed (&quot;transposition of the great vessels&quot;). The two halves of the split tract must migrate into the correct positions over the appropriate ventricles. A failure may result in some blood flowing into the wrong vessel (&quot;e.g.&quot; overriding aorta). The four-chambered heart and the great vessels have features required for fetal growth. The lungs are unexpanded and cannot accommodate the full circulatory volume. Two structures exist to shunt blood flow away from the lungs to compensate. Cells in part of the septum primum die, creating a hole while new muscle cells (the &quot;septum secundum&quot;) grow along the right atrial side of the septum primum except for one region, leaving a gap through which blood can pass from the right atrium to the left atrium (the foramen ovale). A small vessel called the &quot;ductus arteriosus&quot; allows blood from the pulmonary artery to pass to the aorta.

===Changes at birth===
The ductus arteriosus stays open because of circulating factors including prostaglandins. The foramen ovale stays open because of the flow of blood from the right atrium to the left atrium. As the lungs expand, blood flows easily through the lungs and the membranous portion of the foramen ovale (the septum primum) flops over the muscular portion (the septum secundum). If the closure is incomplete, the result is a patent foramen ovale. The two flaps may fuse, but many adults have a foramen ovale that stays closed only because of the pressure difference between the atria.

===Theories===
Rokitansky (1875) explained congenital heart defects as breaks in heart development at various ontogenesis stages. Spitzer (1923) treats them as returns to one of the phylogenesis stages. Krimski (1963), synthesizing two previous points of view, considered congenital heart diseases as a stop of development at the certain stage of ontogenesis, corresponding to this or that stage of the phylogenesis. Hence, these theories can explain feminine and neutral types of defects only.

==Diagnosis==
Many congenital heart defects can be diagnosed prenatally by fetal echocardiography. This is a test which can be done during the second trimester of pregnancy, when the woman is about 18–24 weeks pregnant. It can be an abdominal ultrasound or transvaginal ultrasound.

If a baby is born with cyanotic heart disease, the diagnosis is usually made shortly after birth due to the blue colour of their skin (called cyanosis).

If a baby is born with a septal defect or an obstruction defect, often their symptoms are only noticeable after several months, or sometimes even after many years.

===Classification===
A number of classification systems exist for congenital heart defects. In 2000 the International Congenital Heart Surgery Nomenclature was developed to provide a generic classification system.

====Hypoplasia====

Hypoplasia can affect the heart, typically resulting in the underdevelopment of the right ventricle or the left ventricle. This causes only one side of the heart to be capable of pumping blood to the body and lungs effectively. Hypoplasia of the heart is rare but is the most serious form of CHD. It is called hypoplastic left heart syndrome when it affects the left side of the heart and hypoplastic right heart syndrome when it affects the right side of the heart. In both conditions, the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus (and, when hypoplasia affects the right side of the heart, a patent foramen ovale) is vital to the infant&#x27;s ability to survive until emergency heart surgery can be performed, since without these pathways blood cannot circulate to the body (or lungs, depending on which side of the heart is defective). Hypoplasia of the heart is generally a cyanotic heart defect.

====Obstructive defects====

Obstructive defects occur when heart valves, arteries, or veins are abnormally narrow or blocked. Common defects include pulmonic stenosis, aortic stenosis, and coarctation of the aorta, with other types such as bicuspid aortic valve stenosis and subaortic stenosis being comparatively rare. Any narrowing or blockage can cause heart enlargement or hypertension.

====Septal defects====
The septum is a wall of tissue which separates the left heart from the right heart. Defects in the interatrial septum or the interventricular septum allow blood to flow from the left side of the heart to the right, reducing the heart&#x27;s efficiency. Ventricular septal defects are collectively the most common type of CHD, although approximately 30% of adults have a type of atrial septal defect called probe patent foramen ovale.

====Cyanotic defects====
Cyanotic heart defects are called such because they result in cyanosis, a bluish-grey discoloration of the skin due to a lack of oxygen in the body. Such defects include persistent truncus arteriosus, total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of the great vessels, and tricuspid atresia.

* Double aortic arch, aberrant subclavian artery, and other malformations of the great arteries
* Interrupted aortic arch (IAA)
* Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)
* Scimitar syndrome (SS)

Some constellations of multiple defects are commonly found together.
* Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF)
* Pentalogy of Cantrell
* Shone&#x27;s syndrome/ Shone&#x27;s complex / Shone&#x27;s anomaly

==Treatment==
CHD may require surgery and medications. Medications include diuretics, which aid the body in eliminating water, salts, and digoxin for strengthening the contraction of the heart. This slows the heartbeat and removes some fluid from tissues. Some defects require surgical procedures to restore circulation back to normal and in some cases, multiple surgeries are needed.

Interventional cardiology now offers minimally invasive alternatives to surgery for some patients. The Melody Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve (TPV), approved in Europe in 2006 and in the U.S. in 2010 under a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE), is designed to treat congenital heart disease patients with a dysfunctional conduit in their right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). The RVOT is the connection between the heart and lungs; once blood reaches the lungs, it is enriched with oxygen before being pumped to the rest of the body. Transcatheter pulmonary valve technology provides a less-invasive means to extend the life of a failed RVOT conduit and is designed to allow physicians to deliver a replacement pulmonary valve via a catheter through the patient&#x27;s blood vessels.

Many people require lifelong specialized cardiac care, first with a pediatric cardiologist and later with an adult congenital cardiologist. There are more than 1.8 million adults living with congenital heart defects.

=== Mental health ===
Supporting people with chronic diseases such as congenital heart disease with emotional problems and mental health is a treatment consideration. Since some people with congenital heart disease have a lower quality of life that is related to their condition, some people may struggle with finding a job, engaging in physical exercise, with their fertility, and clinical depression as examples. An estimated 31% of adults with congenital heart disease also have mood disorders. Psychotherapy may be helpful for treating some people who have congenital heart disease and depression, however further research is needed to determine the best way to reduce depression including the length of treatments required for an improvement, type of psychotherapy treatments, and how the psychotherapy sessions are delivered.

==Epidemiology==

Heart defects are among the most common birth defect, occurring in 1% of live births (2–3% including bicuspid aortic valve). In 2013, 34.3 million people had CHD. In 2010, they resulted in 223,000 deaths, down from 278,000 deaths in 1990.

For congenital heart defects that arise without a family history (&quot;de novo&quot;), the recurrence risk in offspring is 3–5%. This risk is higher in left ventricular outflow tract obstructions, heterotaxy, and atrioventricular septal defects.

==Terminology==
Congenital heart defects are known by a number of names including congenital heart anomaly, congenital heart disease, heart defects, and congenital cardiovascular malformations.

<text>The Society of Janus is the second BDSM organization founded in the United States (after The Eulenspiegel Society) and is a San Francisco, California-based BDSM education and support group.

The Society of Janus is nonprofit, volunteer run and is devoted to the art of safe, consensual and non-exploitative adult power exchange. They publish a monthly digital newsletter called &quot;Yellow.&quot;

==History==
The Society of Janus was founded in August 1974 by Cynthia Slater and Larry Olsen. According to the Leather Hall of Fame biography of Slater, she said of the Society of Janus:

A group called Cardea, a women&#x27;s discussion group within the Society of Janus, existed from 1977 to 1978 before discontinuing. A core of lesbian members of Cardea, including Pat Califia, who identified as a lesbian at the time, Gayle Rubin, and sixteen others, were inspired to start Samois on June 13, 1978, as an exclusively lesbian BDSM group. Samois was a lesbian-feminist BDSM organization based in San Francisco that existed from 1978 to 1983, and was the first lesbian BDSM group in the United States. 

The Society of Janus was one of the founding coalition partners of the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom, which was founded in 1997.

In 2004, the Society of Janus Hall of Fame was established. Some of its inductees are: Guy Baldwin, Patrick Califia, Dossie Easton, Janet Hardy, Viola Johnson, Midori, Fakir Musafar, Charles Moser, Gayle Rubin, Cynthia Slater, Jim Ward, Mollena Williams-Haas, and Jay Wiseman.

In 2014, the Society of Janus held their 40th Anniversary Dinner, Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony &amp; Play Party, which was awarded &quot;Best Organization Anniversary Event&quot; at The SF Leather Community Awards for that year. 

In 2017, the art installation known as the San Francisco South of Market Leather History Alley was installed; in it Society of Janus cofounder Cynthia Slater is honored with a metal bootprint displaying her name and a short statement about her.

In 2018, the Society of Janus was inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame.

The records of the Society of Janus are housed at the Leather Archives &amp; Museum in Chicago.

<doc id="868969" wikidata="Q968067" url="?curid=868969" title="Son Sen">
<text>Son Sen ( ; 12 June 1930 – 15 June 1997), alias Comrade Khieu () or &quot;Brother Number 89&quot;, was a Cambodian Communist politician and soldier. A member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kampuchea/Party of Democratic Kampuchea, the &quot;Khmer Rouge&quot;, from 1974 to 1992, Sen oversaw the Party&#x27;s security apparatus, including the &quot;Santebal&quot; secret police and the notorious security prison S-21 at Tuol Sleng.

Son Sen was responsible for ordering the massacre of more than 100,000 people in the Eastern Zone of Cambodia during the last six months of 1978.

Sen was married to Yun Yat, who became the Party&#x27;s minister of education and information. Along with the rest of his family, he was killed on the orders of Pol Pot during a 1997 factional split in the Khmer Rouge.

==Early life==

Son Sen was born in the village of Huong Hoa, Trà Vinh Province in southern Vietnam to a minor landowning family. Although the Khmer Institute described Sen as being of &quot;Sino-Vietnamese&quot; descent, Béréziat and others have confirmed that like several other Khmer Rouge leaders he was of Khmer Krom ethnicity. From 1946 he attended a teacher training college in Phnom Penh, and in the 1950s received a scholarship to study in Paris, where he became a member of a Marxist group of Cambodian students centred on Saloth Sar (alias Pol Pot), Ieng Sary, and Hou Yuon. Along with other members of the group, Sen was influenced by the radical line pursued by the French Communist Party.

Sen&#x27;s academic record was relatively mediocre, and in May 1956 the authorities withdrew his scholarship due to his continued participation in political activity. Returning to Cambodia with a teaching certificate, he taught for a time at the &quot;Lycee Sisowath&quot;, and went on to become director of studies of the National Teaching Institute, part of the University of Phnom Penh. By 1960 he had also, however, joined the clandestine Cambodian Communist Party, then known as the Khmer People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party and led by Tou Samouth.

==In the &quot;maquis&quot;==

Son Sen&#x27;s political views, which opposed the ruling Sangkum regime of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, were soon to affect his career. In 1962 he was removed from his post at the Institute after being accused of spreading anti-Sangkum ideas amongst the students, though he was permitted to continue teaching and was appointed principal of a high school in Takéo Province. By 1963, when Saloth Sar took over the Communist Party leadership, a number of leftists were beginning to escape Phnom Penh for the countryside; Sen went underground and was to follow them in 1964, hidden in the car boot of a Chinese diplomatic vehicle.

Sen was initially to join Saloth Sar and other former colleagues at a Vietnamese Communist military base called Office 100, located in the border areas of Cambodia. There are indications that he was soon sent to the remote, malarial Ratanakiri Province, in the far north-east of the country, in order to build up anti-government activity amongst the Khmer Loeu tribesmen. By the later 1960s, Sen – with increasing experience of guerrilla warfare – had built up a reputation as a talented field commander, and had risen to a senior rank within the Party. In 1968, he was responsible for several successful uprisings in the south-west of the country, and was reported to be the chief of the political committee for Kampot, Takéo and Kampong Speu.

==Chief of Staff of Khmer Rouge forces==

After the Cambodian coup of 1970, and the subsequent establishment of the Khmer Republic under Lon Nol, Sihanouk was to join with his former Communist enemies in forming the GRUNK, a Beijing-based government-in-exile. The Khmer Rouge&#x27;s forces were soon to be swelled by thousands of new recruits, attracted in part by Sihanouk&#x27;s name. Son Sen, whilst not a prominent member of the GRUNK, had considerable power thanks to his high position in the government&#x27;s forces on the ground – CPNLAF, the Cambodian People&#x27;s National Liberation Armed Forces. Along with Ieng Sary, he was responsible for the North-Eastern Zone, the stronghold of the Party &#x27;Centre&#x27;.

By 1972 Son Sen had become Chief of Staff of the Khmer Rouge forces. Despite occasional criticisms – his colleagues found his style peremptory and his point of view &quot;bourgeois&quot;, and he was openly criticised by Hou Yuon at the Party&#x27;s 1971 Congress – his devotion to Saloth Sar and his closeness to the Party &#x27;Centre&#x27; guaranteed his senior position.

==Democratic Kampuchea==

After the Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh in April 1975, Son Sen was appointed Deputy Prime Minister with responsibility for Defense. Responsible for internal security, he also oversaw the &quot;Santebal&quot; – the Khmer Rouge secret police. As such he monitored the operations of the infamous S-21 prison at Tuol Sleng, and engaged actively in the design of its interrogation and torture procedures. Son Sen&#x27;s role meant that he was particularly closely implicated in the many thousands of deaths that occurred in this period due to the arrest and execution of perceived enemies of the regime. His memoranda to his subordinate Kang Kek Iew, and notes taken during study sessions overseen by Sen for S-21 cadres, reveal his continued interest in history, deeply anti-Vietnamese views, and revolutionary zeal, along with a &quot;schoolmasterish attention to detail&quot;. These were combined with a brutally ruthless streak; Sen was reputed to have once been so angry with Foreign Minister Ieng Sary that he unsuccessfully attempted to have him murdered.

The Party&#x27;s paranoia with regard to security, and its obsessive secrecy, led many senior Khmer Rouge cadres to be identified in internal documents by pseudonyms or numbers: Son Sen was often referred to as &quot;Khieu&quot;, and his wife as &quot;At&quot;. He was also identified as &quot;Brother 89&quot; on letters and memoranda.

Sen&#x27;s other main duties in this period involved reorganising the CPNLAF forces into a cohesive national army, the Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea. By 1977–78, he was overseeing an increasing series of clashes with Vietnamese forces along the border, as well as mounting a massive purge of Eastern Zone cadres considered to have Vietnamese links. As the ongoing war with the Vietnamese began to go increasingly badly for the Democratic Kampuchean forces, however, Sen began to fall under suspicion himself, and may well have become a victim of his own security apparatus if the 1979 Vietnamese invasion had not intervened. In particular, he had been implicated by the Party&#x27;s internal security in several &quot;traitorous&quot; activities including the 1978 murder of the British academic Malcolm Caldwell.

==Commander of the NADK==

Following the Vietnamese invasion and the establishment of a pro-Vietnamese regime in Phnom Penh, Sen was to re-establish his control over the Khmer Rouge forces, now operating against the Vietnamese and the forces of the People&#x27;s Republic of Kampuchea from bases in the Cardamom Mountains.

By August 1985, when the &#x27;retirement&#x27; of Pol Pot was officially announced, Son Sen assumed supreme command of the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea, as it was now called. During this period Sen had occasional contact with the commanders of the other armed groups within the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea; the Khmer People&#x27;s National Liberation Armed Forces under Sak Sutsakhan, and the ANS armed wing of the royalist FUNCINPEC, commanded by Norodom Ranarridh. There was occasional coordination between the Sen&#x27;s NADK and the ANS in particular, though the Khmer Rouge forces remained easily the strongest element in the coalition (and periodically attacked ANS and KPNLAF forces).

==After 1991 and death==

Following the Paris Peace Agreements of October 1991, Son Sen and Khieu Samphan traveled to Phnom Penh to negotiate with UNTAC and the Cambodian government in Phnom Penh. Sen was made a member of the Supreme National Council which was set up to protect the country&#x27;s independence until UN-supervised elections could take place, and seems to have been more determined than most Khmer Rouge leaders to ensure that they were reintegrated into normal national politics. However, as a result Sen was removed from power in May 1992 by Ta Mok, after a dispute with fellow Khmer Rouge leaders over whether to continue the negotiations. From 1992 to 1997 he had relatively little influence within the Khmer Rouge.

He was murdered on 15 June 1997, alongside 13 members of his family, including children, on orders of Pol Pot, who at the time was fighting his last battle to regain control of the Khmer Rouge from Ta Mok. Pol Pot is thought to have believed that Sen was in negotiations with government forces to surrender, specifically being in contact with then-Second Prime Minister Hun Sen; he ordered Son Sen and his family to be shot, after which trucks drove over their bodies back-and-forth and at high speed. Pol Pot later claimed to be remorseful over Sen and his family&#x27;s murder, stating that &quot;I feel sorry for that. That was a mistake that occurred when we put our plan into practice. I feel sorry&quot;.

<text>Radiocontrast agents are substances used to enhance the visibility of internal structures in X-ray-based imaging techniques such as computed tomography (contrast CT), projectional radiography, and fluoroscopy. Radiocontrast agents are typically iodine, or more rarely barium sulfate. The contrast agents absorb external X-rays, resulting in decreased exposure on the X-ray detector. This is different from radiopharmaceuticals used in nuclear medicine which emit radiation.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) functions through different principles and thus MRI contrast agents have a different mode of action. These compounds work by altering the magnetic properties of nearby hydrogen nuclei.

==Types and uses==
Radiocontrast agents used in X-ray examinations can be grouped in positive (iodinated agents, barium sulfate), and negative agents (air, carbon dioxide, methylcellulose).

===Iodine (circulatory system)===
Iodinated contrast contains iodine. It is the main type of radiocontrast used for intravenous administration. Iodine has a particular advantage as a contrast agent for radiography because its innermost electron (&quot;k-shell&quot;) binding energy is 33.2 keV, similar to the average energy of x-rays used in diagnostic radiography. When the incident x-ray energy is closer to the k-edge of the atom it encounters, photoelectric absorption is more likely to occur. Its uses include:
* Contrast CTs
* Angiography (&quot;arterial investigations&quot;)
* Venography (&quot;venous investigations&quot;)
* VCUG (&quot;voiding cystourethrography&quot;)
* HSG (&quot;hysterosalpingogram&quot;)
* IVU (&quot;intravenous urography&quot;)

Organic iodine molecules used for contrast include iohexol, iodixanol and ioversol.

===Barium sulfate (digestive system)===

Barium sulfate is mainly used in the imaging of the digestive system. The substance exists as a water-insoluble white powder that is made into a slurry with water and administered directly into the gastrointestinal tract.
* Upper gastrointestinal series
* Barium enema (&quot;large bowel investigation&quot;) and DCBE (&quot;double contrast barium enema&quot;).
* Barium swallow (&quot;oesophageal investigation&quot;)
* Barium meal (&quot;stomach investigation&quot;) and double contrast barium meal
* Barium follow through (&quot;stomach and small bowel investigation&quot;)
* CT pneumocolon / virtual colonoscopy

Barium sulfate, an insoluble white powder, is typically used for enhancing contrast in the GI tract. Depending on how it is to be administered the compound is mixed with water, thickeners, de-clumping agents, and flavourings to make the contrast agent. As the barium sulfate doesn&#x27;t dissolve, this type of contrast agent is an opaque white mixture. It is only used in the digestive tract; it is usually swallowed as a barium sulfate suspension or administered as an enema. After the examination, it leaves the body with the feces.

===Air===
As in the picture on the right where both air and barium are used together (hence the term &quot;double-contrast&quot; barium enema) air can be used as a contrast material because it is &quot;less&quot; radio-opaque than the tissues it is defining. In the picture it highlights the interior of the colon. An example of a technique using purely air for the contrast medium is an air arthrogram where the injection of air into a joint cavity allows the cartilage covering the ends of the bones to be visualized.

Before the advent of modern neuroimaging techniques, air or other gases were used as contrast agents employed to displace the cerebrospinal fluid in the brain while performing a pneumoencephalography. Sometimes called an &quot;air study&quot;, this once common yet highly-unpleasant procedure was used to enhance the outline of structures in the brain, looking for shape distortions caused by the presence of lesions.

===Carbon dioxide===
Carbon dioxide also has a role in angioplasty. It is low-risk as it is a natural product with no risk of allergic potential. However, it can be used only below the diaphragm as there is a risk of embolism in neurovascular procedures. It must be used carefully to avoid contamination with room air when injected. It is a negative contrast agent in that it displaces blood when injected intravascularly.

===Discontinued agents===
====Thorotrast====
Thorotrast was a contrast agent based on thorium dioxide, which is radioactive. It was first introduced in 1929. While it provided good image enhancement, its use was abandoned in the late 1950s since it turned out to be carcinogenic. Given that the substance remained in the bodies of those to whom it was administered, it gave a continuous radiation exposure and was associated with a risk of cancers of the liver, bile ducts and bones, as well as higher rates of hematological malignancy (leukemia and lymphoma). Thorotrast may have been administered to millions of patients prior to being disused.

====Nonsoluble substances====
In the past, some non water-soluble contrast agents were used. One such substance was iofendylate (trade names: Pantopaque, Myodil) which was an iodinated oil-based substance that was commonly used in myelography. Due to it being oil-based, it was recommended that the physician remove it from the patient at the end of the procedure. This was a painful and difficult step and because complete removal could not always be achieved, iofendylate&#x27;s persistence in the body might sometimes lead to arachnoiditis, a potentially painful and debilitating lifelong disorder of the spine. Iofendylate&#x27;s use ceased when water-soluble agents (such as metrizamide) became available in the late 1970s. Also, with the advent of MRI, myelography became much less-commonly performed.

==Adverse effects==

Modern iodinated contrast agents – especially non-ionic compounds – are generally well tolerated. The adverse effects of radiocontrast can be subdivided into type A reactions (e.g. thyrotoxicosis), and type B reactions (hypersensitivity reactions: allergy and non-allergy reactions [formerly called anaphylactoid reactions]).

Patients receiving contrast via IV typically experience a hot feeling around the throat, and this hot sensation gradually moves down to the pelvic area.

The documentation of adverse drug reactions to contrast media should be documented precisely so that the patient receives adequate prophylaxis if contrast medium is administered again. 

===Contrast induced nephropathy===

Iodinated contrast may be toxic to the kidneys, especially when given via the arteries prior to studies such as catheter coronary angiography. Non-ionic contrast agents, which are almost exclusively used in computed tomography studies, have not been shown to cause CIN when given intravenously at doses needed for CT studies.

===Thyroid dysfunction===
Iodinated radiocontrast can induce overactivity (hyperthyroidism) and underactivity (hypothyroidism) of the thyroid gland. The risk of either condition developing after a single examination is 2–3 times that of those who have not undergone a scan with iodinated contrast. Thyroid underactivity is mediated by two phenomena called the Plummer and Wolff–Chaikoff effect, where iodine suppresses the production of thyroid hormones; this is usually temporary but there is an association with longer-term thyroid underactivity. Some other people show the opposite effect, called Jod-Basedow phenomenon, where the iodine induces overproduction of thyroid hormone; this may be the result of underlying thyroid disease (such as nodules or Graves&#x27; disease) or previous iodine deficiency. Children exposed to iodinated contrast during pregnancy may develop hypothyroidism after birth and monitoring of the thyroid function is recommended.

<text>Zara Frances Cully (January 26, 1892 – February 28, 1978) was an American actress. Cully was best known for her role as Olivia &#x27;Mother Jefferson&#x27; Jefferson on the CBS sitcom &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, which she portrayed from the series beginning in 1975 until her death in 1978.

==Early life and education==
Zara Frances Cully was the eldest of 10 surviving children born to Ambrose E. and Nora Ann (née Gilliam) Cully in Worcester, Massachusetts, on January 26, 1892. The Cully family was musical with Ambrose serving as the music director of the church they attended, Zion AME Church. Zara&#x27;s younger brother, jazz trumpeter Wendell Cully, played with Cab Calloway and Duke Ellington. She graduated from the Worcester School of Speech and Music.

==Career==
In 1940, after an appearance in New York City, she became known as &quot;one of the world&#x27;s greatest elocutionists&quot;. After moving to Jacksonville, Florida, she began producing, writing, directing, and acting in numerous plays. For 15 years she was a drama teacher at her own studio as well as at Edward Waters College, a historically black college founded in 1866 to educate freed slaves. She had become known as Florida&#x27;s &quot;Dean of Drama.&quot; Upset by the racism she experienced in the Jim Crow-era South, Cully decided to move to Hollywood, where she became a regular performer at the Ebony Showcase Theatre.

By the time she acquired the role of &#x27;Mother&#x27; Jefferson, Cully had accumulated a long list of acting credentials spanning a half-century, including such movies as &quot;The Liberation of L.B. Jones&quot; (1970), a starring role in &quot;Brother John&quot; (1971), and the Blaxploitation films &quot;Sugar Hill&quot; (1974) and &quot;Darktown Strutters&quot; (1975). Her TV career went back to what critics call &#x27;the Golden Age of Television&#x27;, including appearances on the highly acclaimed &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; series. Aside from &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, her television credits included &quot;The People Next Door&quot; (CBS Playhouse), &quot;Run for Your Life&quot; (NBC Matinee Theater), &quot;Cowboy in Africa&quot;, &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;, &quot;Mod Squad&quot;, &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, and &quot;All in the Family&quot; (in a 1974 appearance in which she originated the &quot;Mother Jefferson&quot; role, which she then carried over to &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, when that show spun off). At 86, she was one of the oldest performers active in television at the time of her death.

===&quot;The Jeffersons&quot; (1975–1978)===
Cully&#x27;s first appearance as &#x27;Mother&#x27; Olivia Jefferson was in a guest appearance on an episode of &quot;All in the Family&quot; entitled &quot;Lionel&#x27;s Engagement&quot; which aired February 9, 1974. She was 82 years old at the time. All three actors who portrayed Tom, Helen, and Jenny Willis on that episode were replaced with different actors by the time &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; became a spin-off on January 18, 1975, but producers retained Cully as Mother Jefferson. During the first 17 episodes of the third season of &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, she was absent due to a severe case of pneumonia caused by a collapsed lung. Upon her recovery she returned to the show. Her last credited performance was an appearance in the ninth episode of the fourth season entitled &quot;The Last Leaf&quot;, which aired November 12, 1977, three months before her death. No special episode was created to center on her death, but it was addressed in the second episode of the fifth season entitled &quot;Homecoming (pt 1)&quot;, which aired September 27, 1978, seven months after her death.

==Personal life and death==
Cully was married once, to James M. Brown Jr. from 1914 until his death in 1968. Together, Cully and Brown had four children: Mrs. Mary Gale &quot;Polly&quot; Buggs (wife of John A. Buggs, deputy director of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, 1917–2005), Emerson T. Brown, James M. Brown III, and a baby daughter. Cully died at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on February 28, 1978, from lung cancer, aged 86. Services were held on March 2, 1978, at the Church of Christian Fellowship, in Los Angeles. She was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale) in the Freedom Mausoleum, Columbarium of Victory. In attendance were the cast and crew of &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, including show producer Norman Lear. Cully was posthumously awarded an NAACP special Image Award on June 9, 1978, at the 11th Annual NAACP Awards ceremony.

<text>Phronima is a genus of small, deep sea hyperiid amphipods of the family Phronimidae. It is found throughout the world&#x27;s oceans, except in polar regions. &quot;Phronima&quot; species live in the pelagic zone of the deep ocean. Their bodies are semitransparent. Although commonly known as parasites, they are more technically correctly called parasitoids. Instead of constantly feeding on a live host, females attack salps, using their mouths and claws to eat the animal and hollow out its gelatinous shell. &quot;Phronima&quot; females then enter the barrel and lay their eggs inside, then propel the barrel through the water as the larvae develop, providing them with fresh food and water.

It is sometimes thought to be an inspiration for the fictional xenomorphs.

&quot;Phronima&quot; species possess unique compound eyes adapted to detect blue-green wavelengths of light, which are prominent in the bioluminescent flashes of potential prey and predators. These specialized visual adaptations aid Phronima in navigating the dim mid-ocean environment, where bioluminescence serves as an important ecological signal.

==Classification==

The genus &quot;Phronima&quot; contains these 10 species:
*&quot;Phronima atlantica&quot; 
*&quot;Phronima bowmani&quot; 
*&quot;Phronima bucephala&quot; 
*&quot;Phronima colletti&quot; 
*&quot;Phronima curvipes&quot; 
*&quot;Phronima dunbari&quot; 
*&quot;Phronima pacifica&quot; 
*&quot;Phronima sedentaria&quot; (type species)
*&quot;Phronima solitaria&quot; 
*&quot;Phronima stebbingi&quot;

<doc id="868983" wikidata="Q1183039" url="?curid=868983" title="Stretching">
<text>Stretching is a form of physical exercise in which a specific muscle or tendon (or muscle group) is deliberately expanded and flexed in order to improve the muscle&#x27;s felt elasticity and achieve comfortable muscle tone. The result is a feeling of increased muscle control, flexibility, and range of motion. Stretching is also used therapeutically to alleviate cramps and to improve function in daily activities by increasing range of motion.

In its most basic form, stretching is a natural and instinctive activity; it is performed by humans and many other animals. It can be accompanied by yawning. Stretching often occurs instinctively after waking from sleep, after long periods of inactivity, or after exiting confined spaces and areas. In addition to vertebrates (e.g. mammals and birds), spiders have also been found to exhibit stretching.

Increasing flexibility through stretching is one of the basic tenets of physical fitness. It is common for athletes to stretch before (for warming up) and after exercise in an attempt to reduce risk of injury and increase performance.

Stretching can be dangerous when performed incorrectly. There are many techniques for stretching in general, but depending on which muscle group is being stretched, some techniques may be ineffective or detrimental, even to the point of causing hypermobility, instability, or permanent damage to the tendons, ligaments, and muscle fiber. The physiological nature of stretching and theories about the effect of various techniques are therefore subject to heavy inquiry.

Although static stretching is part of some warm-up routines, pre-exercise static stretching usually reduces an individual&#x27;s overall muscular strength and maximal performance, regardless of an individual&#x27;s age, sex, or training status. For this reason, an active dynamic warm-up is recommended before exercise in place of static stretching.

== Physiology ==
Studies have shed light on the function, in stretching, of a large protein within the myofibrils of skeletal muscles named titin. A study performed by Magid and Law demonstrated that the origin of passive muscle tension (which occurs during stretching) is actually within the myofibrils, not extracellularly as had previously been supposed. Due to neurological safeguards against injury such as the Golgi tendon reflex, it is normally impossible for adults to stretch most muscle groups to their fullest length without training due to the activation of muscle antagonists as the muscle reaches the limit of its normal range of motion.

== Psychology ==
Stretching has been recognized for its potential to positively influence both cognitive function and mood. Research indicates that engaging in stretching exercises may lead to a reduction in feelings of anxiety, depression, hostility, fatigue, and confusion, particularly among individuals with sedentary lifestyles. These improvements in mood have been observed to correlate with enhancements in cognitive function. For individuals who often spend prolonged periods engaged in sedentary activities, integrating stretching into their daily routines may prove beneficial. Doing so not only addresses physical tension but also promotes mental well-being. Regular stretching has been associated with decreased levels of anxiety and depression, alongside increased vigor, which could activate brain regions associated with improved cognitive abilities.

== Types of stretches ==
Stretches can be either static or dynamic. Static stretches are performed while stationary and dynamic stretches involve movement of the muscle. Stretches can also be active or passive, where active stretches use internal forces generated by the body to perform a stretch and passive stretches involve forces from external objects or people to perform the stretch. They can involve both passive and active components.

===Dynamic stretching===
Dynamic stretching is a movement-based stretch aimed at increasing blood flow throughout the body while also loosening up the muscle fibers. Standard dynamic stretches typically involve slow and controlled active contraction of muscles. An example of such a dynamic stretch is lunges. Another form of dynamic stretching is ballistic stretching, which is an active stretch that involves bouncing or swinging back and forth at a high speed in order to take a muscle beyond its typical range of motion using momentum. Ballistic stretching can also be performed with tools such as resistance bands to increase the intention between sets in order to quickly warm-up the body. Ballistic stretching may cause damage to the joints.

===Static stretching===
The simplest static stretches are static–passive stretches, according to research findings. This brings the joint to its end range of motion and hold it there using external forces. There are more advanced forms of static stretching, such as proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF), which involves both active muscle contractions and passive external forces. PNF stretching utilizes an aspect of neuromuscular reeducation, which may yield better results than regular static stretching in terms of induced strength. PNF stretching may involve contracting either the antagonist muscles, agonist muscles, or both (CRAC). The efficacy of PNF stretching and its recommendation of use may be dependent on stretching-to-performance duration.

== Effectiveness ==
Stretching has been found both effective and ineffective based on its application for treatment.

Although many people engage in stretching before or after exercise, the medical evidence has shown this has no meaningful benefit in preventing specifically muscle soreness. It may reduce the lactic acid build up in the muscles, making the next workout more bearable.

Stretching does not appear to reduce the risk of injury during exercises, except perhaps a dynamic warm-up for runners. While running places extreme stress loads on the joints, static stretching can help to improve joint flexibility. However, this has not been proven to reduce risk of injury in the runners. A dynamic (stretching) warm up has been shown to help overall running performance.

Delayed onset muscle soreness, also known as DOMS, typically arises 48 hours after an exercise bout. Stretching before or after the exercise did not show any significant benefits in the onset of DOMS.

=== Effectiveness of dynamic stretching ===
Ballistic stretching, a form of dynamic stretching, is likely to increase flexibility through a neurological mechanism. The stretched muscle is moved passively to the end range by an external force or agonist muscle: holding a muscle in this position might reduce muscle spindle sensitivity, with repeated stretch applied at the end range inhibiting the Golgi tendon organ.

Dynamic stretching, because it is movement-based, may not isolate the muscle group as well or have as intense of a stretch, but it is better at increasing the circulation of blood flow throughout the body, which in turn increases the amount of oxygen able to be used for athletic performance. This type of stretching has shown better results on athletic performances of power and speed when compared to static stretching.

=== Effectiveness of static stretching ===
Static stretching is better at creating a more intense stretch because it is able to isolate a muscle group better. But this intensity of stretching may hinder one&#x27;s athletic performance because the muscle is being overstretched while held in this position and, once the tension is released, the muscle will tend to tighten up and may actually become weaker than it was previously. It has been shown in high level athletes, such as gymnasts, after performing a static stretching routine that it has a negative effect. The gymnasts lost the ability to jump vertically as high as prior as well as no improvement in their straddle jump or flexibility. Also, the longer the duration of static stretching, the more exhausted the muscle becomes. This type of stretching has been shown to have negative results on athletic performance within the categories of power and speed. However, to be able to do usual daily activities, a certain amount of range of motion is needed from each muscle. For example, the calf muscles are one of the muscle groups that have the most need for adequate flexibility since they are deeply related to normal lower limb function. When the goal is to increase flexibility, the most commonly used technique is stretching. Chronic static stretching was shown to increase range of motion of Dorsiflexion or bringing one&#x27;s foot closer to their shin by an average of 5.17 degrees in healthy individuals versus 3.77 degrees when solely using ballistic stretching. While static stretching is shown to decrease power and speed in higher level athletes, when it comes to the older population who live more sedentary lifestyles static stretching has been shown to increase muscles strength and power.

==== Dynamic versus Static: Flexibility and Performance ====
Both dynamic and static stretching have been shown to have a positive impact on flexibility over time by increasing muscle and joint elasticity, thus increasing the depth and range of motion an athlete is able to reach. This is evident in the experiment &quot;Acute effects of duration on sprint performance of adolescent football players&quot;. In this experiment, football players were put through different stretching durations of static and dynamic stretching to test their effects. They were tested on maximum sprinting ability and overall change in flexibility. Both static and dynamic stretching had a positive impact on flexibility but, whereas dynamic stretching had no impact on sprint times, static stretching had a negative result, worsening the time the participants were able to sprint the distance in.

<doc id="868991" wikidata="Q2401305" url="?curid=868991" title="Radiodensity">
<text>Radiodensity (or radiopacity) is opacity to the radio wave and X-ray portion of the electromagnetic spectrum: that is, the relative inability of those kinds of electromagnetic radiation to pass through a particular material. Radiolucency or hypodensity indicates greater passage (greater transradiancy) to X-ray photons and is the analogue of transparency and translucency with visible light. Materials that inhibit the passage of electromagnetic radiation are called radiodense or radiopaque, while those that allow radiation to pass more freely are referred to as radiolucent. Radiopaque volumes of material have white appearance on radiographs, compared with the relatively darker appearance of radiolucent volumes. For example, on typical radiographs, bones look white or light gray (radiopaque), whereas muscle and skin look black or dark gray, being mostly invisible (radiolucent).

Though the term radiodensity is more commonly used in the context of qualitative comparison, radiodensity can also be quantified according to the Hounsfield scale, a principle which is central to X-ray computed tomography (CT scan) applications. On the Hounsfield scale, distilled water has a value of 0 Hounsfield units (HU), while air is specified as -1000 HU.

In modern medicine, radiodense substances are those that will not allow X-rays or similar radiation to pass. Radiographic imaging has been revolutionized by radiodense contrast media, which can be passed through the bloodstream, the gastrointestinal tract, or into the cerebral spinal fluid and utilized to highlight CT scan or X-ray images. Radiopacity is one of the key considerations in the design of various devices such as guidewires or stents that are used during radiological intervention. The radiopacity of a given endovascular device is important since it allows the device to be tracked during the interventional procedure.
The two main factors contributing to a material&#x27;s radiopacity are density and atomic number. Two common radiodense elements used in medical imagery are barium and iodine.

Medical devices often contain a radiopacifier to enhance visualization during implantation for temporary implantation devices, such as catheters or guidewires, or for monitoring the position of permanently implanted medical devices, such as stents, hip and knee implants, and screws. Metal implants usually have sufficient radiocontrast that additional radiopacifier is not necessary. Polymer-based devices, however, usually incorporate materials with high electron density contrast compared to the surrounding tissue. Examples of radiocontrast materials include titanium, tungsten, barium sulfate, bismuth oxide and zirconium oxide. Some solutions involve direct binding of heavy elements, for instance iodine, to polymeric chains in order to obtain a more homogeneous material which has lower interface criticalities. When testing a new medical device for regulatory submission, device manufacturers will usually evaluate the radiocontrast according to ASTM F640 &quot;Standard Test Methods for Determining Radiopacity for Medical Use.&quot;

<doc id="868993" wikidata="Q4677976" url="?curid=868993" title="Acyanotic heart defect">
<text>An acyanotic heart defect, is a class of congenital heart defects. In these, blood is shunted (flows) from the left side of the heart to the right side of the heart, most often due to a structural defect (hole) in the interventricular septum. People often retain normal levels of oxyhemoglobin saturation in systemic circulation.

This term is outdated, because a person with an acyanotic heart defect may show cyanosis (turn blue due to insufficient oxygen in the blood).

== Signs and symptoms ==
Presentation is the following:
* Shortness of breath
* Congested cough
* Diaphoresis
* Fatigue
* Frequent respiratory infections
* Machine-like heart murmur
* Tachycardia
* Tachypnea
* Respiratory distress
* Mild cyanosis (in right sided heart failure)
* Poor growth and development (from increased energy spent on breathing)

=== Complications ===
This condition can cause congestive heart failure.
==Diagnosis==

=== Types ===
Left to right shunting heart defects include:
* Ventricular septal defect (VSD) (30% of all congenital heart defects)
* Atrial septal defect (ASD)
* Atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD)
* Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)

Others:
* levo-Transposition of the great arteries (l-TGA),

Acyanotic heart defects without shunting include:
* Pulmonary stenosis (a narrowing of the pulmonary valve)
* Aortic stenosis
* Coarctation of the aorta

== Management ==
Treatment of this condition can be done via:
* Medications: Digoxin/Lanoxin
* Diuretics: Furosemide/Lasix
* Surgery

<text>The Konami LaserScope is a head-mounted light gun used with and licensed for the Nintendo Entertainment System video game console. 

It was designed for the game &quot;Laser Invasion&quot; (known as &quot;Gun Sight&quot; in Japan), but works with any game compatible with the NES Zapper. In the United States, &quot;Laser Invasion&quot; came with a coupon for a $5 discount for the LaserScope.

It is voice-activated, firing a shot whenever the wearer says &quot;fire&quot; (although some reviewers criticized its ability to do so). The headset also includes an eyepiece with a crosshair that sits in front of the wearer&#x27;s right eye.

The LaserScope is powered through the audio port of the NES, allowing it to function as headphones for the NES.

==Reception==
The LaserScope received negative reviews for its poor microphone technology; users complained that saying anything into the microphone would cause the LaserScope to fire, including background noise. The complaint was humorized in James Rolfe&#x27;s &quot;Angry Video Game Nerd&quot; series, in the episode &quot;NES Accessories&quot;, where he uses various swear words to fire.

<doc id="868996" wikidata="Q1194249" url="?curid=868996" title="Three Secrets of Fátima">
<text>The Three Secrets of Fátima () are a series of apocalyptic visions and prophecies given to three young Portuguese shepherds, Lúcia Santos and her cousins Jacinta and Francisco Marto, by a Marian apparition, starting on 13 May 1917. The three children claimed to have been visited by the Virgin Mary six times between May and October 1917. The apparition is now popularly known as Our Lady of Fátima.

According to Lúcia, around noon on 13 July 1917, the Virgin Mary entrusted the children with three secrets. Two of the secrets were revealed in 1941 in a document written by Lúcia, at the request of José Alves Correia da Silva, Bishop of Leiria, to assist with the publication of a new edition of a book on Jacinta. When asked by the Bishop in 1943 to reveal the third secret, Lúcia struggled for a short period, being &quot;not yet convinced that God had clearly authorized her to act&quot;. However, in October 1943 the Bishop ordered her to put it in writing. Lúcia then wrote the secret down and sealed it in an envelope not to be opened until 1960, when &quot;it will appear clearer&quot;. The text of the third secret was officially released by Pope John Paul II in 2000. Some claim that it was not the entire secret revealed by Lúcia, despite repeated assertions from the Vatican to the contrary.

According to various Catholic interpretations, the three secrets involve Hell, World War I and World War II, and 20th-century persecutions of Christians.

==Background==
Of the hundreds of alleged Marian apparitions the Catholic Church has investigated, only twelve have received ecclesiastical approval, with nine having occurred between 1830 and 1933. Cultural anthropologists Victor and Edith Turner, who converted to Catholicism in 1958, at one time viewed the increase in Marian apparition cults as a post-industrial reaction of a &quot;disenfranchised lower middle class to a rapidly changing culture.&quot;

At the age of 14, Lúcia was sent to the school of the Sisters of Saint Dorothy in Vilar, near Porto. In 1928, she became a postulant at the Dorothean convent in Tui, just across the border in Spain. Lúcia continued to report private visions periodically throughout her life. In the mid-1930s the Bishop of Leiria encouraged Lúcia (religious name: Sister María Lúcia das Dores) to write her memoirs, so as to disclose further details of her cousins and the 1917 apparitions.

As early as July 1917, mention was made that the Lady of the apparitions had entrusted to the children a secret, &quot;that was good for some and bad for others&quot;. It was not until her third memoir, written in 1941, that Lúcia began to write more in depth about the content of the secret. In this, she follows the French visionary Mélanie Calvat who saw Our Lady of La Salette in 1846, who wrote down the secrets from that event almost twenty years after. Lúcia wrote that the secret has three parts, the first two of which she revealed in 1941. The third, however, was not written down until 3 January 1944.

== First secret ==
In her third memoir (1941), Lúcia said that the first secret, a vision of Hell, was disclosed to the children on 13 July 1917.
== Second secret ==

The second secret refers to the devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary and was initially only partially revealed to the children on 13 July 1917. Various prophecies related to this devotion were made, such as a statement that World War I would end, along with a prediction of another war during the reign of Pope Pius XI, should men continue offending God and should Russia not convert. The second half requests that Russia be consecrated to the Immaculate Heart of Mary:
In 1925 Sister Lúcia reported an apparition of the Virgin Mary at the Convent of Saint Dorothea at Pontevedra, Galicia. She said she was asked to convey the message of the First Saturday Devotions. By her account a subsequent vision of the Child Jesus reiterated this request. In 1930, she wrote to her confessor that in 1929 she had a vision of both Mary and the Holy Trinity in which God had asked for the Consecration of Russia to the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary by the Pope in communion with all the bishops of the world. This later vision fulfilled what was said in 1917 about how the Virgin Mary would come later to request the consecration. The message regarding the establishment of the Devotion of the Five First Saturdays is reminiscent of that reported by Margaret Mary Alacoque in the seventeenth century, which led to the First Friday Devotion.

It is unlikely that this message was conveyed to the Pope, but the Bishop of Leiria suggested that she write her memoirs so as to provide more details on her cousins as well as further details of the 1917 apparitions. In her third memoir, written in 1941, Sister Lúcia recalled that at the apparition of 13 July 1917, the Virgin Mary had first mentioned the consecration of Russia, and said that she would return to give particulars.

The second prophecy was not disclosed until August 1941, after World War II had already begun. Skeptics have questioned whether Mary, in 1917, referred explicitly to Pope Pius XI, as Ambrogio Ratti did not choose that regnal name until after his election in 1922. Further, the European portion of World War II is generally held to have begun on 1 September 1939, and by then, Pope Pius XII had succeeded Pius XI. As for the conversion of Russia, the Bolshevik Revolution did not happen until November 1917.

Some proponents of the Fátima prophecies argue that the secret did not say that the war must begin in Europe, and during the pontificate of Pius XI Japan had already invaded China in 1937, which is generally seen by historians of China and other parts of Asia as when the Second World War actually began, a view which also has qualified support from some Western historians. Some critics argue that the Russian Civil War (1918–1921), the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921), the Chinese Civil War (1927–1937), the war between Italy and Ethiopia (1935–1936), and the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) serve to illustrate that the prediction that one war will end and that another will start is not necessarily an indication of divine inspiration. Proponents of the prophecy will point out that the second secret called for a war worse than World War I, not simply any armed conflict. In addition, with regards to the conversion of Russia, there was already, at the time, strong revolutionary ferment in Russia before the Bolshevik Revolution as witnessed by the earlier February Revolution in 1917 and the active Communist and anarchist movements, which would explain Mary&#x27;s reference on 13 July 1917 to the need for a conversion of Russia.

On 25 January 1938, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported &quot;Aurora Borealis Startles Europe; People Flee in Fear, Call Firemen.&quot; The celestial display was seen from Canada to Bermuda to Austria to Scotland, and short-wave radio transmissions were shut down for almost 12 hours in Canada. It is noteworthy that during the final hour of this aurora, Christian Rakovsky was undergoing interrogation in the Soviet Union, giving information to Stalin about Western involvement in Hitler&#x27;s rise, suggesting an alliance with the Western powers against Germany. Just over a month later, Hitler seized Austria and eight months later invaded Czechoslovakia.

As a result of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Pope Francis announced he would consecrate Russia and Ukraine to the Immaculate Heart of Mary which he did on March 25, 2022.

== Third secret ==

Sister Lúcia chose not to disclose the third secret in her memoir of August 1941. In 1943, Lúcia fell seriously ill with influenza and pleurisy. Bishop Silva, visiting her on 15 September 1943, suggested that she write the third secret down to ensure that it would be recorded in the event of her death. However, Lúcia was hesitant to do so as, upon receiving the secret, she had heard Mary say not to reveal it. Because Carmelite obedience requires that orders from superiors be regarded as coming directly from God, she was in a as to whose orders took precedence. Finally, in mid-October, Bishop Silva sent her a letter containing a direct order to record the secret. Lúcia continued to struggle, even after this direct order. According to Lúcia, she overcame it after the Virgin Mary appeared to her in early January 1944 and said, &quot;Write that which they command you, but not that which is given to you to understand of its meaning.&quot;
The third part of the secret was written down &quot;by order of His Excellency the Bishop of Leiria and the Most Holy Mother&quot; on 3 January 1944. In June 1944, the sealed envelope containing the third secret was delivered to Silva, where it stayed until 1957, when it was finally delivered to Rome. Canon Galamba, an advisor to the Bishop of Leiria, is quoted as saying that when the bishop refused to open the sealed envelope, Lúcia &quot;made him promise that it would definitely be opened and released to the world at her death, or in 1960, whichever came first.&quot;

It was announced by Cardinal Angelo Sodano on 13 May 2000, 83 years after the first apparition of the Lady to the children in the Cova da Iria, and 19 years after the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II that the third secret would finally be released. In his announcement, Cardinal Sodano implied that the secret was about the 20th century persecution of Christians that culminated in the failed Pope John Paul II assassination attempt on 13 May 1981, the 64th anniversary of the first apparition of the Lady at Fátima. The idea of an already fulfilled secret is contested by some Catholics.

The text of the third secret, according to the Vatican, was published on 26 June 2000:
Along with the text of the secret, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (the future Pope Benedict XVI) published a theological commentary in which he states: &quot;A careful reading of the text of the so-called third &#x27;secret&#x27; of Fatima ... will probably prove disappointing or surprising after all the speculation it has stirred. No great mystery is revealed; nor is the future unveiled.&quot; After explaining the differences between public and private revelations, he cautions people not to see in the message a determined future event:
He then moves on to talk about the symbolic nature of the images, noting: &quot;The concluding part of the &#x27;secret&#x27; uses images which Lucia may have seen in devotional books and which draw their inspiration from long-standing intuitions of faith.&quot; As for the meaning of the message: &quot;What remains was already evident when we began our reflections on the text of the &#x27;secret&#x27;: the exhortation to prayer as the path of &#x27;salvation for souls&#x27; and, likewise, the summons to penance and conversion.&quot;

On 13 May 2010, during a homily in Fatima, Pope Benedict said that &quot;we would be mistaken to think that Fatima&#x27;s prophetic mission is complete.&quot; He then expressed the hope that the centenary of the 1917 apparitions may &quot;hasten the fulfillment of the prophecy of the triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, for the glory of the Blessed Trinity.&quot;

==Third secret controversy==
Prior to the 1930s, the main focus of devotion to Our Lady of Fatima (which was at that time not widely known outside Portugal and Spain) was on the need to pray the Rosary for an end to World War I and for world peace. After the publication of Sister Lúcia&#x27;s memoirs, starting in 1935, Fatima came to be seen as presenting the victory of the Blessed Virgin over Communism.

On 8 February 1960, the Portuguese news information agency Agência Nacional de Informação published a news article stating that it was &quot;most probable the Secret would remain, for ever, under absolute seal.&quot; This announcement produced considerable speculation over the content of the secret. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, speculation ranged from &quot;worldwide nuclear annihilation to deep rifts in the Roman Catholic Church that lead to rival papacies.&quot; On 2 May 1981, Laurence James Downey hijacked an airplane and demanded that Pope John Paul II make public the third secret of Fátima.

The release of the text sparked criticism from the Catholic Church in Portugal. Clergy as well as laypeople were offended that the text had been read in Rome and not at the Fátima shrine in Portugal where the reported events took place. &quot;The Times&quot; for 29 June 2000 reported that &quot;The revelation on Monday that there were no doomsday predictions has provoked angry reactions from the Portuguese church over the decision to keep the prophecy secret for half a century&quot;.

Critics such as Italian journalist and media personality Antonio Socci claim that the four-page handwritten text of the Third Secret released by the Vatican in 2000 is not the real secret, or at least not the full secret. The argument is based on the following:

*Written on one sheet of paper: the text of the third secret released by the Vatican is handwritten on four sheets of paper. Father Joaquin Alonso, official Fátima archivist for 16 years, reports in his book that, &quot;Lucy tells us that she wrote it on a sheet of paper. In a taped interview, Charles Fiore quoted Malachi Martin as saying the following regarding the text of the third secret: &quot;I cooled my heels in the corridor outside the Holy Father&#x27;s apartments, while my boss, Cardinal Bea, was inside debating with the Holy Father, and with a group of other bishops and priests, and two young Portuguese seminarians, who translated the letter, a single page, written in Portuguese, for all those in the room.&quot; Later, in May, 2007, Tarcisio Cardinal Bertone went on the Italian television program &quot;Porta a Porta&quot; and showed Lúcia&#x27;s document on camera. It was a &quot;single&quot; sheet of paper that had been divided twice, once vertically, and then once horizontally. Lucia&#x27;s handwriting was on both sides of the sheet of paper. The vertical squares were what the Vatican reproduced in June, 2000.
*Written in the form of a letter: another reason why critics argue the full third secret has not been released is because of indications that the third secret was written in the form of a signed letter to the Bishop of Leiria and the text of the third secret released by the Vatican is not written in the form of a letter. Lúcia was interviewed by Father Jongen on 3 February 1946. When Fr. Jongen asked Lúcia when the time would arrive for the Third Secret, Lúcia responded, &quot;I communicated the third part in a letter to the Bishop of Leiria.&quot; Also, Canon Galamba, an advisor to the Bishop of Leiria, is quoted as saying, &quot;When the bishop refused to open the letter, Lucy made him promise that it would definitely be opened and read to the world either at her death or in 1960, whichever came first.&quot; Antonio Socci, however, questioned how strictly one should interpret the word &quot;letter.&quot;
*Contains words attributed to the Blessed Virgin Mary: the text of the third secret released by the Vatican contains no words attributed to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Socci asserts that the third secret probably begins with the words &quot;In Portugal the dogma of the Faith will always be preserved etc.&quot;, words which Lúcia included in her fourth memoir, but which are included only as a footnote to the text released by the Vatican. Lúcia, however, stated in her fourth memoir that she was not going to reveal the third part.
*Contains information about the Apocalypse, apostasy, Satanic infiltration of the Church: in an interview published in the 11 November 1984 edition of &quot;Jesus&quot; Magazine, Cardinal Ratzinger was asked whether he had read the text of the third secret and why it had not been revealed. Ratzinger acknowledged that he had read the third secret, and stated in part that the third secret involves the &quot;importance of the novissimi&quot;, and &quot;dangers threatening the faith and the life of the Christian and therefore (the life) of the world.&quot; Ratzinger also commented that &quot;If it is not made public – at least for the time being – it is in order to prevent religious prophecy from being mistaken for a quest for the sensational.&quot; Also, Howard Dee, former Philippine ambassador to the Vatican, was interviewed by &quot;Inside the Vatican&quot; in 1998. Dee claimed that Cardinal Ratzinger had personally confirmed to him that the messages of Akita and Fátima are &quot;essentially the same&quot;. The Akita prophecy, in part, contains the following: &quot;The work of the devil will infiltrate even into the Church in such a way that one will see cardinals opposing cardinals, bishops against bishops. … churches and altars sacked ...&quot; On 13 May 2000, Cardinal Sodano announced that the third secret would be released, during which he implied the secret was about the persecution of Christians in the 20th century that culminated in the failed assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II on 13 May 1981. In a syndicated radio broadcast, Malachi Martin stated that the third secret &quot;doesn&#x27;t make any sense unless we accept that there will be, or that there is in progress, a wholesale apostasy amongst clerics, and laity in the Catholic Church ...&quot;.

:In a 1980 interview for the German magazine &quot;Stimme des Glaubens&quot; published in October 1981, John Paul II was asked explicitly to speak about the third secret. He said:
However, during the 26 June 2000 press conference that saw the publication of the third secret, Cardinal Ratzinger denied that John Paul II had made these remarks.

According to one source, Lúcia was allegedly asked about the third secret and remarked that it was &quot;in the Gospels and in the Apocalypse&quot;, and at one point had even specified Apocalypse chapters 8 to 13, a range that includes the Book of Revelation 12:4, the chapter and verse cited by Pope John Paul II in his homily in Fátima on 13 May 2000.

==Cardinal Bertone&#x27;s response==
The Vatican has maintained its position that the full text of the third secret was published in June 2000. A report from the Zenit &quot;Daily Dispatch&quot; dated 20 December 2001 based on a Vatican press release, reported that Lúcia told then-Archbishop Tarcisio Bertone, in an interview conducted the previous month, that the secret has been completely revealed and published, and that no secrets remain. Bertone, along with Cardinal Ratzinger, co-authored &quot;The Message of Fatima&quot;, the document published in June 2000 by the Vatican that contains a scanned copy of the original text of the third secret.
Bertone, who was elevated to the rank of cardinal in 2003 and held the position of Vatican Secretary of State until September 2013, wrote a book in 2007 titled &quot;The Last Secret of Fatima&quot;. The book contains a transcribed interview between journalist Giuseppe De Carli and Bertone in which Bertone responds to various criticisms and accusations regarding the content and disclosure of the third secret. At one point in the interview, De Carli comments on an unsourced accusation that the Vatican is concealing a one-page text of the third secret which predicts a great apostasy where Rome will &quot;lose the faith and become the throne of the Antichrist.&quot; Bertone responds as follows:

At another point in the interview, De Carli claimed that Cardinal Ottaviani had once stated, &quot;the [third] Secret was written on a single sheet of paper. So we would be talking about twenty to twenty-five lines in total...&quot; He also mentions that one of Lúcia&#x27;s memoirs contains the words &quot;In Portugal, the dogma of the faith will always be preserved etc&quot;, words which some believe introduce the real third secret. Describing these observations as &quot;feeble bits of evidence that neither prove nor disprove anything&quot;, De Carli asks Cardinal Bertone about the possibility of there being two texts, where the &quot;first document&quot; contains the words of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the other contains the description of the vision published by the Vatican. Bertone answers in part &quot;There is no first document. There never was any such text in the archives of the Holy Office.&quot; Bertone also says &quot;So I&#x27;m not sure what Cardinal Ottaviani was talking about.&quot; Bertone also states that &quot;We have the word, better, the official confirmation of Sister Lúcia: &#x27;Is this the Third Secret, and is this the only text of it?&#x27; &#x27;Yes, this is the Third Secret, and I never wrote any other&#x27;.&quot; It was later discovered that Cardinal Ottaviani had never remarked about the number of the lines of text.

Later on in the interview, Bertone again addresses the question as to whether a text exists with words attributed to the Blessed Virgin that was censored: &quot;The part of the text where the Virgin speaks in the first person wasn&#x27;t censored, for the simple reason that it never existed. ...I&#x27;m basing my statement on Sister Lucia&#x27;s own direct confirmation that the Third Secret is none other than the text that was published in the year 2000.&quot;

In early September 2007, archbishop Loris Francesco Capovilla, private secretary to Pope John XXIII, who witnessed Pope John open the envelope of the third secret, said there was no truth in the rumor that the Vatican was suppressing a vision of the end of the world. &quot;There are not two truths from Fatima and nor is there any fourth secret. The text which I read in 1959 is the same that was distributed by the Vatican.&quot; Capovilla is also quoted as saying &quot;I have had enough of these conspiracy theories. It just isn&#x27;t true. I read it, I presented it to the Pope and we resealed the envelope.&quot;

On 21 September 2007 writers Antonio Socci and Solideo Paolini, who have competing books on Fatima, attempted to crash a reception at the Pontifical Urbanianum University where Bertone was to introduce his book &quot;The Last Fatima Visionary: My Meetings with Sister Lucia&quot;. They stated that they wished to participate in the question and answer part of the reception. When told that the cardinal would not be taking questions, they then tried to confront Bertone, who is the Vatican Secretary of State. Security guards hustled them out. In talking to reporters afterwards, Socci and Paolini produced a tape recording in which they claimed Archbishop Loris Francesco Capovilla, revealed that there were two texts of the third secret, although Capovilla had stated otherwise less than two weeks before.

Pope Paul VI and Pope John Paul I also read the contents of the third secret, in 1965 and 1978 respectively, but they too preferred to reseal the contents so that they would be disclosed later.

==Pope John Paul I==
The Catholic Counter-Reformation group, founded by theologian Abbé George de Nantes, takes the position that the released text is the complete third secret, but refers to Pope John Paul I rather than John Paul II, pointing out that the latter, after all, did not die when he was attacked, while the bishop in the third secret did. John Paul I had met Lúcia Santos while he was Patriarch of Venice, and was deeply moved by the experience. In a letter to a colleague after his election, he vowed to perform the Consecration of Russia which Lúcia said Mary had asked for.

==Commentaries==
Michael Cuneo notes &quot;Secret messages, apocalyptic countdowns, cloak-and-dagger intrigue within the highest echelons of the Vatican: not even Hollywood could ask for better material than this&quot;.

&quot;To understand and appreciate Fatima is to understand and appreciate Portuguese Catholicism&quot;. Jeffrey S. Bennett takes note of how, starting in the 1930s, the image of Our Lady of Fátima developed into a rallying point for anti-communism, an idea that spread far beyond the Iberian peninsula. Martindale mentions a concept where the fruits of a phenomenon are more important than its historical origins. Therefore, it is possible to conceive of a vibrant cultus where the strength of the devotion, shrine, or pilgrimage, can outweigh uncertainties regarding its origin. According to Maunder, Fátima demonstrates not only how seriously Catholics took &quot;the revelations of an enclosed nun remembering visions she had experienced at the age of ten, but also show how difficult it is for the hierarchy to manage a movement of popular piety, despite critics claims of manipulation. Following Fátima, there would be proliferation of apocalyptic manifestations, such as at Necedah.

<doc id="868997" wikidata="Q2186829" url="?curid=868997" title="Cyanotic heart defect">
<text>A cyanotic heart defect is any congenital heart defect (CHD) that occurs due to deoxygenated blood bypassing the lungs and entering the systemic circulation, or a mixture of oxygenated and unoxygenated blood entering the systemic circulation. It is caused by structural defects of the heart such as right-to-left or bidirectional shunting, malposition of the great arteries, or any condition which increases pulmonary vascular resistance. The result may be the development of collateral circulation.

== Types ==
* Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF)
* Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection
* Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS)
* Transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA)
* Truncus arteriosus (Persistent)
* Tricuspid atresia
* Interrupted aortic arch
* Pulmonary atresia (PA)
* Pulmonary stenosis (critical)
* Eisenmenger syndrome (reversal of shunt due to pulmonary hypertension).

== Signs and symptoms ==
Presentation includes the following:
* Clubbing
* The patient assuming a crouching position
* Cyanosis - bluish face, particularly the lips; and bluish fingers and toes
* Crying
* Crabbiness/irritability
* Tachycardia
* Tachypnea
* A history of inadequate feeding
* Unusually large toe and fingernails
* Delayed development (both biological and physiological)

==Diagnosis==
== Management ==
* Morphine during Tet spells to decrease associated infundibular spasm.
* Prophylactic: Propranolol/Inderall
* Prostaglandin E (to keep the ductus arteriosus patent)
* Prophylactic antibiotic to prevent endocarditis
* Surgery: Variable. Superior Cavopulmonary Bypass (Bidirectional Glenn or Hemi-Fontan Procedure), Total Cavopulmonary Bypass (Fontan Completion Procedure). The purpose of these operations is to redirect the blood flow of the deoxygenated blood to the lungs by attaching the Vena Cava directly to the Pulmonary Artery causing the blood that flows into the lungs to be oxygenated before entering the chambers on the right side of the heart. Mathematical models are used to address the issue of pressure level alterations of circulation after the procedures. The pulmonary pressure resistance in the cavopulmonary connection is increased, and these models permit clear analyses of the pressure increase allowing doctors to avoid possible venous circulation congestion.

<doc id="869004" wikidata="Q838139" url="?curid=869004" title="Ventricular septal defect">
<text>A ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a defect in the ventricular septum, the wall dividing the left and right ventricles of the heart. The extent of the opening may vary from pin size to complete absence of the ventricular septum, creating one common ventricle. The ventricular septum consists of an inferior muscular and superior membranous portion and is extensively innervated with conducting cardiomyocytes.

The membranous portion, which is close to the atrioventricular node, is most commonly affected in adults and older children in the United States. It is also the type that will most commonly require surgical intervention, comprising over 80% of cases.

Membranous ventricular septal defects are more common than muscular ventricular septal defects, and are the most common congenital cardiac anomaly.
==Signs and symptoms==
Ventricular septal defect is usually symptomless at birth. It usually manifests a few weeks after birth.

VSD is an acyanotic congenital heart defect, aka a left-to-right shunt, so there are no signs of cyanosis in the early stage. However, an uncorrected VSD can increase pulmonary resistance leading to the reversal of the shunt and corresponding cyanosis.
* Pansystolic (Holosystolic) murmur along lower left sternal border (depending upon the size of the defect) +/- palpable thrill (palpable turbulence of blood flow). Heart sounds are normal. Larger VSDs may cause a parasternal heave, a displaced apex beat (the palpable heartbeat moves laterally over time, as the heart enlarges). An infant with a large VSD will fail to thrive and become sweaty and tachypnoeic (breathe faster) with feeds.

The restrictive ventricular septal defects (smaller defects) are associated with a louder murmur and more palpable thrill (grade IV murmur). Larger defects may eventually be associated with pulmonary hypertension due to the increased blood flow. Over time this may lead to an Eisenmenger&#x27;s syndrome the original VSD operating with a left-to-right shunt, now becomes a right-to-left shunt because of the increased pressures in the pulmonary vascular bed.

==Cause==
Congenital VSDs are frequently associated with other congenital conditions, such as Down syndrome. Congenital heart disease, particularly VSDs, is the number one cause of death for children with Down syndrome ages birth to two. 

A VSD can also form a few days after a myocardial infarction (heart attack) due to mechanical tearing of the septal wall, before scar tissue forms, when macrophages start remodeling the dead heart tissue.

A congenital VSD can result from a disturbance in the morphogenesis of the heart in its embryonic stages. In the fifth week of gestation, the heart undergoes multiple processes of septation and forming a dextral loop. Interfering with the latter leads to insufficient leftward movement of the ventricular outflow tract over the atrioventricular canal, which in turn can result in a VSD or, in the most extreme cases, a double outlet right ventricle with one.

A ventricular septal defect arises when the superior part of the interventricular septum, which separates the right and left ventricles of the heart, fails to fully develop. The right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs to get oxygen, while the left ventricle pumps blood to the rest of the body to provide oxygen to tissues. A ventricular septal defect results in the mixing of oxygen-rich blood with oxygen-poor blood, increasing strain on the heart and lungs.

==Pathophysiology==
During ventricular contraction, or systole, some of the blood from the left ventricle leaks into the right ventricle, passes through the lungs and re-enters the left ventricle via the pulmonary veins and left atrium. This has two net effects. First, the circuitous refluxing of blood causes volume overload on the left ventricle. Second, because the left ventricle normally has a much higher systolic pressure (~120 mmHg) than the right ventricle (~20 mmHg), the leakage of blood into the right ventricle therefore elevates right ventricular pressure and volume, causing pulmonary hypertension with its associated symptoms.

In serious cases, the pulmonary arterial pressure can reach levels that equal the systemic pressure. This reverses the left to right shunt, so that blood then flows from the right ventricle into the left ventricle, resulting in cyanosis, as blood is by-passing the lungs for oxygenation.

This effect is more noticeable in patients with larger defects, who may present with breathlessness, poor feeding and failure to thrive in infancy. Patients with smaller defects may be asymptomatic. Four different septal defects exist, with perimembranous most common, outlet, atrioventricular, and muscular less commonly.

==Diagnosis==

A VSD can be detected by cardiac auscultation. Classically, a VSD causes a pathognomonic holo- or pansystolic murmur. Auscultation is generally considered sufficient for detecting a significant VSD. The murmur depends on the abnormal flow of blood from the left ventricle, through the VSD, to the right ventricle. If there is not much difference in pressure between the left and right ventricles, then the flow of blood through the VSD will not be very great and the VSD may be silent. This situation occurs a) in the fetus (when the right and left ventricular pressures are essentially equal), b) for a short time after birth (before the right ventricular pressure has decreased), and c) as a late complication of unrepaired VSD. Confirmation of cardiac auscultation can be obtained by non-invasive cardiac ultrasound (echocardiography). To more accurately measure ventricular pressures, cardiac catheterization, can be performed.

===Classification===
Although there are several classifications for VSD, the most accepted and unified classification is that of Congenital Heart Surgery Nomenclature and Database Project.
The classification is based on the location of the VSD on the right ventricular surface of the inter ventricular septum and is as follows:

====Multiple====

====Type 1====
Type 1 is sub aortic

====Type 2====
* Type 2 also known as perimembranous, paramembranous, conoventricular, membranous septal defect, and subaortic.
* Most common variety found in 70%

====Type 3====
Type 3 also known as inlet (or AV canal type).
* Commonly associated with atrioventricular septal defect, found in about 5%

====Type 4====
Type 4 also known as muscular (trabecular)
* Located in the muscular septum, found in 20%. Can be sub classified again based on the location into anterior, apical, posterior and mid

====Type: Gerbode====
Type: Gerbode also known as left ventricular to right atrial communication
* Due to absence of Atrioventricular septum.

==Treatment==

Most cases do not need treatment and heal during the first years of life. Treatment is either conservative or surgical. Smaller congenital VSDs often close on their own, as the heart grows, and in such cases may be treated conservatively.
Some cases may necessitate surgical intervention, i.e. with the following indications:

# Failure of congestive cardiac failure to respond to medications
# VSD with pulmonic stenosis
# Large VSD with pulmonary hypertension
# VSD with aortic regurgitation

For the surgical procedure, a heart-lung machine is required and a median sternotomy is performed. Percutaneous endovascular procedures are less invasive and can be done on a beating heart, but are only suitable for certain patients. Repair of most VSDs is complicated by the fact that the conducting system of the heart is in the immediate vicinity.

Ventricular septum defect in infants is initially treated medically with cardiac glycosides (e.g., digoxin 10-20 μg/kg per day), loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide 1–3 mg/kg per day) and ACE inhibitors (e.g., captopril 0.5–2 mg/kg per day).

=== Transcatheter closure ===
A device, known as the Amplatzer muscular VSD occluder, may be used to close certain VSDs. It was initially approved in 2009. It appears to work well and be safe. The cost is also lower than having open heart surgery. The device is placed through a small incision in the groin.

The Amplatzer septal occluder was shown to have full closure of the ventricular defect within the 24 hours of placement. It has a low risk of embolism after implantation. Some tricuspid valve regurgitation was shown after the procedure that could possibly be from the right ventricular disc. There have been some reports that the Amplatzer septal occluder may cause life-threatening erosion of the tissue inside the heart. This occurs in one percent of people implanted with the device and requires immediate open-heart surgery. This erosion occurs due to improper sizing of the device resulting with it being too large for the defect, causing rubbing of the septal tissue and erosion.

=== Surgery ===

Surgical closure of a Perimembranous VSD is performed on cardiopulmonary bypass with ischemic arrest. Patients are usually cooled to 28 degrees. Percutaneous Device closure of these defects is rarely performed in the United States because of the reported incidence of both early and late onset complete heart block after device closure, presumably secondary to device trauma to the AV node.

Surgical exposure is achieved through the right atrium. The tricuspid valve septal leaflet is retracted or incised to expose the defect margins.

Several patch materials are available, including native pericardium, bovine pericardium, PTFE (Gore-Tex or Impra), or Dacron.

Suture techniques include horizontal pledgeted mattress sutures, and running polypropylene suture.

Critical attention is necessary to avoid injury to the conduction system located on the left ventricular side of the interventricular septum near the papillary muscle of the conus. Care is taken to avoid injury to the aortic valve with sutures.

Once the repair is complete, the heart is extensively deaired by venting blood through the aortic cardioplegia site, and by infusing Carbon Dioxide into the operative field to displace air.

Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography is used to confirm secure closure of the VSD, normal function of the aortic and tricuspid valves, good ventricular function, and the elimination of all air from the left side of the heart.

The sternum, fascia and skin are closed, with potential placement of a local anesthetic infusion catheter under the fascia, to enhance postoperative pain control.

Multiple muscular VSDs are a challenge to close, achieving a complete closure can be aided by the use of fluorescein dye.

==Epidemiology==
VSDs are the most common congenital cardiac abnormalities. They are found in 30-60% of all newborns with a congenital heart defect, or about 2-6 per 1000 births. During heart formation, when the heart begins life as a hollow tube, it begins to partition, forming septa. If this does not occur properly it can lead to an opening being left within the ventricular septum. It is debatable whether all those defects are true heart defects, or if some of them are normal phenomena, since most of the trabecular VSDs close spontaneously. Prospective studies give a prevalence of 2-5 per 100 births of trabecular VSDs that close shortly after birth in 80-90% of the cases.

<text>Chief Kaiser Daliwonga Matanzima, often misspelled as Mathanzima (15 June 1915 – 15 June 2003), was the long-term leader of Transkei. In 1950, when South Africa was offered to establish the Bantu Authorities Act, Matanzima convinced the Bhunga to accept the Act. The Bhunga were the council of Transkei chiefs, who at first rejected the act until 1955 when Matanzima persuaded them.

Born in Qamata, Cape Province, a brother of George, Ngangomhlaba Matanzima and a nephew of Nelson Mandela, Mathanzima spent part of his childhood at the homestead of Chief Falo Mgudlwa, a repository of Thembu history and lore. He received the name Daliwonga (meaning &quot;Maker of Majesty&quot;) upon reaching manhood as an &quot;isikhahlelo&quot; (praise name). Mathanzima studied law at Fort Hare University and completed his articles in the Transkei capital, Mthatha, in 1948. However, he never practiced law, instead, he involved himself in Thembu and Transkei politics.

==Political career==
Made paramount chief of the &quot;Emigrant Thembus&quot;, a breakaway and sub-group to the Thembus, Mathanzima&#x27;s support of the South African government&#x27;s Bantu Authorities Act (1951), which looked to foster traditional African leadership structures, gave the Act credibility in the eyes of many chiefs, but saw him part ways with Mandela politically (although the two initially remained friends, with Mathanzima acting as best man at Mandela&#x27;s wedding).

===Relationship with South African government===
In his 1975 book &quot;Independence My Way&quot;, Mathanzima argued that emancipation would come through a federation of semi-autonomous black states, such as Transkei, rather than through the militant nationalism espoused by the African National Congress (ANC). Mandela condemned Mathanzima as a de facto supporter of apartheid.

Mathanzima became a member of the United Transkeian Territorial Council in 1955 and an Executive Council member of the newly created Transkeian Territorial Authority (TTA) in 1956. In 1961 he graduated to Chairman of the TTA, survived an assassination attempt in December 1962 by members of the Pan Africanist Congress, and in 1963 was an obvious candidate for Chief Minister of the newly formed Transkeian Legislative Assembly. Mathanzima was not a popular vote for everyone because of his strong support of apartheid. Mathanzima and his brother George founded the Transkei National Independence Party, led it to election victories in 1968 and 1973, and was sworn in as Prime Minister in 1976 when Transkei became the first bantustan to gain nominal independence. According to an article published in &quot;Time Magazine&quot; at the time, though Transkei declared independence theoretically as a &quot;free state&quot;, Mathanzima ruled the territory as a &quot;de facto&quot; puppet-state dictator, banning local opposition parties and buying at subsidized prices Transkei farmlands offered by the South African government.

Mathanzima clashed with the South African government over various issues, mostly connected with territorial demands made by Mathanzima. This led to his announcement on 2 February 1978 that Transkei would break all diplomatic ties with South Africa, including the non-aggression pact between them. He ordered that all South African Defence Force members seconded to the Transkei Army leave Transkei by 31 March. But he soon backed down in the face of Transkei&#x27;s dependence on South African economic aid.

===Presidency===
In 1979, after the death of AmaMpondo King Botha Sigcau, Mathanzima became State President, with his brother George as Prime Minister. Their approach included jailing protesters and banning such opposition parties as, in 1980, the Democratic Progressive Party. That party&#x27;s leader, AbaThembu King Sabata Dalindyebo, was convicted of &quot;violating the dignity&quot; of President Mathanzima, but escaped to Zambia and joined the ANC.

Mandela&#x27;s father-in-law was a member of the Transkei cabinet, and Mathanzima attempted to persuade Mandela to accept exile in Transkei in lieu of imprisonment. Mandela not only refused but declined to see Mathanzima during his imprisonment on Robben Island, fearing that such a meeting would legitimize the bantustans to the international community.

However, in common with other bantustan leaders, Mathanzima did not shy away from criticism of South Africa&#x27;s racial policies and called for the repeal of Apartheid legislation (which were repealed in bantustans that were nominally independent), and occasionally pressed for a federal system for South Africa.

===Retirement===
On 20 February 1986, faced with South African evidence of corruption, Mathanzima was forced to retire as President, although he tried to claim that he wanted to spend more time dealing with family affairs. Kaiser Mathanzima was replaced as President by his brother, George Mathanzima, who resigned later on because he too had been accused of being corrupt. Kaiser Mathanzima was still described as Transkei&#x27;s effective leader for a time, but the two soon fell out and Kaiser was temporarily detained in the Transkei gaols in 1987; upon release, he was restricted to Qamata.

==Death==
Mathanzima died in Queenstown on his 88th birthday. He received an official funeral, but not a state one as former allies and supporters had hoped. The continued mixed feelings toward him in South Africa were reflected in then President Thabo Mbeki&#x27;s eulogy for him. Although Mathanzima was said to have been a harsh ruler, Mbeki looked at the positive legacies that Mathanzima left behind. Mbeki praised Mathanzima&#x27;s dream of eliminating poverty in South Africa as well as seeing all South Africans citizens educated. Others who spoke at Mathazima&#x27;s funeral said they admired how he fought to see the recognition of traditional leaders in South Africa. Former South African President and Kaiser Mathanzima&#x27;s Uncle, Nelson Mandela, was not in attendance for Mathanzima&#x27;s funeral because he was in Dublin, Ireland for the opening ceremonies of the 2003 Special Olympics.

Mathanzima&#x27;s grandson, King Lwandile Zwelenkosi Matanzima, ruler of Western Thembuland of Eastern Cape, died on 22 May 2010.

<doc id="869027" wikidata="Q5894453" url="?curid=869027" title="Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions">
<text>The Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU) was a pro-democracy labour and political group in the Hong Kong. It was established on 29 July 1990. It had 160,000 members in 61 affiliates (mainly trade unions in various sectors) and representation in the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (LegCo) to challenge government policies and push for legal protection of worker and trade union rights. It was one of the two most influential labour groups in Hong Kong, with the other one being the pro-Beijing Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions.

==Beliefs==
The principles put forward by the HKCTU were &quot;Solidarity, Rice Bowl, Justice and Democracy&quot;. The group focused on the rights and interests of workers, and the development of a democratic political system in Hong Kong. It called for the right to collective bargaining and protection against dismissals for involvement in trade union activities.

Besides calling for universal suffrage of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong and LegCo, the group also supported the pro-democracy movement in mainland China, including the struggle for independent trade unions. It participated in a number of human rights and labour rights networks to oppose the suppression of labour movements in mainland China.

==History==
The HKCTU emerged from the Hong Kong Christian Industrial Committee (HKCIC), a church-sponsored labour organisation largely involved in the grassroots movements in the 1970s and 1980s. The Confederation was established in 1990 under the leadership of independent labour leader Lau Chin-shek. It was largely as a coalition of the independent and politically unaffiliated union organisations, most of which were new white-collar unions organising the civil service and professional or service employees in the public and subvented sectors, including the Hong Kong Professional Teachers&#x27; Union and the Hong Kong Social Workers General Union.

The HKCTU inherited the vanguard image and the more liberal sector in the territory&#x27;s pluralistic union movement. It became a partner and an ally of the pro-democracy camp and the Democratic Party, in which Lau was the founding member. Lau Chin-shek won a seat in the 1991 LegCo direct election and Lee Cheuk-yan, the general secretary of the HKCTU, also won a seat in the 1995 LegCo election.

In 1993, HKCTU supported a strike by its affiliate Cathay Pacific Airways Flight Attendants Union (FAU). The strike, demanding a reduction of working hours from up to sixty-five hours per week and the reinstatement of three workers fired for refusing to work overtime, lasted for seventeen days and ended in victory.

Days before transfer of sovereignty in 1997, with the support of the pro-democracy camp, the HKCTU successfully established statutory rights of collective bargaining of labour unions, which mandate employers to negotiate with labour unions on issues such as salaries, welfare and working hours, by introducing the Employee&#x27;s Rights to Representation, Consultation and Collective Bargaining Bill as Lee Cheuk-yan&#x27;s private member&#x27;s bill. But the laws were soon abolished by the pro-Beijing appointed Provisional Legislative Council shortly after the transfer of sovereignty.

Members of HKCTU were involved in organising a number of local protests, including the pivotal 2003 July 1 march to oppose the enactment of anti-sedition laws under Article 23 of the Basic Law (organised by the Civil Human Rights Front of which HKCTU is a member), and other protests to struggle for labour rights and democracy in Hong Kong and in mainland China.

In the 1998 LegCo election, the group was represented by Lau Chin-shek (also a member of Democratic Party and The Frontier) and Lee Cheuk-yan (also a member of The Frontier) in the legislative council (LegCo). In 2012, the HKCTU co-founded the Labour Party.

In 2013, HKCTU supported a strike by its affiliate Union of Hong Kong Dockers. After a forty-day strike, the workers achieved a 9.8 percent pay rise, meal breaks and promises that there would be no retaliation against the strikers.

HKCTU members voted to disband the union on October 3, 2021, following the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests. At that time, co-founder and general secretary Lee Cheuk-yan was in jail for his involvement in the protests and chief executive Mung Siu Tat had announced on Facebook that he had left Hong Kong. At least 29 Hong Kong trade unions had already been dissolved throughout 2021.

==Notable affiliates==
*Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions
*Hong Kong Social Workers&#x27; General Union
*Hong Kong Professional Teachers&#x27; Union
*Hong Kong Federation of Domestic Workers Unions
*Union of Hong Kong Dockers

<text>Whaley Bridge () is a town and civil parish in the High Peak district of Derbyshire, England. It is situated on the River Goyt, south-east of Manchester, north of Buxton, north-east of Macclesfield and west of Sheffield. It had a population of 6,455 at the 2011 census, including Furness Vale, Horwich End, Bridgemont, Fernilee, Stoneheads and Taxal.

==History==
There is evidence of prehistoric activity in the area, including early Bronze Age standing stones, burial sites and the remains of a stone circle. A bronze-age axe head was discovered in 2005. There has long been speculation that the &#x27;Roosdyche&#x27;, a complex of banks and ditches on the eastern side of the town, is of prehistoric human origin, but investigations in 1962 concluded that it was formed by glacial meltwater.

The name of &quot;Weyley&quot; or &quot;Weylegh&quot; appears in many 13th-century documents and is derived from the Anglo Saxon &quot;weg lēah&quot;, meaning &#x27;a clearing by the road&#x27;. In 1351, the lands of Weyley and Yeardsley were granted to William Joddrell for his faithful service to Edward, the Black Prince. In the 14th century, it housed the residence of William Jauderell and his descendants; their name also spelt &#x27;Jodrell&#x27;, who gave their name to the modern Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire. The Jodrells continued to call their lands &quot;Yeardsley Whaley&quot; for centuries and, when the first local government board was formed in 1863 and the area became an urban district, the town adopted its popular name of &quot;Whaley Bridge&quot;; the town has been called so ever since. Parish records from the 1820s refer to Horridge rather than Horwich.

The River Goyt formed the historical boundary between Derbyshire and Cheshire. The present town of Whaley Bridge was divided into smaller towns in both counties. Historical records show that, in 1316, on the Cheshire side there were Taxal, Yeardsley and Whaley; the last two were combined into one district of Yeardsley-cum-Whaley. The Derbyshire side consisted only of Fernilee, which included the villages of Shallcross and Horwich. This side was in the parish of Hope and was part of the Forest of High Peak, while the Cheshire side was part of the Forest of Macclesfield. From 1796, Taxal and Yeardsley were effectively joined in that the Jodrell family was the main landowner in both towns, although the administration of these remained separate until 1936.

Until the late 19th century, the population of the area grew slowly. For example, in the diocesan census in 1563, Taxal is recorded as having 26 households and, by the mid-18th century, Taxal and Yeardsley together only reached 55 households. In 1791, land at Whaley Bridge was advertised for sale; the owner believed that its waterpower would be useful in the textile industry, but the two townships remained very small and only had a population of 853 between them by 1841. Up to this time, agriculture and coalmining had been the main occupations.

The town expanded greatly in the Industrial Revolution and the population almost trebled to 2,322. Although there had been coal mines from earlier times, cotton mills had become the dominant industry by 1871. Coal mining took place in the area from its very early days because of a large geographical fault which traverses the Whaley Bridge basin from east to west; this results in the coal outcropping in various places. Documentary evidence of 1587 indicates a well-established coal industry in the &quot;Towneshepp of Weley&quot;, known today as Whaley Bridge. Today, there is less intensive agriculture labour and no coal mining in the area.

===Today===
Whaley Bridge continues to expand as new housing is built, but retains the character of a small town. As the self-styled &quot;Gateway to the Goyt&quot;, it attracts tourists, mainly walkers, but has not become dominated by the tourist industry, unlike some other local towns and villages. The Peak District Boundary Walk runs through the village.

The town has been twinned with Tymbark, Poland, since June 1994.

===Cromford and High Peak Railway===
The Cromford and High Peak Railway was granted Parliamentary consent in 1825. It was fully opened for passenger and goods traffic on 6 July 1831. The railway linked the wharf at the head of the Whaley Bridge Branch of the Peak Forest Canal to the Cromford Canal at Cromford Wharf. It had seven inclined planes, the first being situated within the town of Whaley Bridge itself. Unlike the other six inclined planes, which were operated by stationary steam engines, this one was operated by a horse-driven gin, which remained operational until 9 April 1952. This plane was much shorter than the others, being only 180 yards (165 m) long and rising at 1:13.5. Approach to the top of the plane was under a very low bridge and, because of this, waggons had to be hauled to and from the top of the plane by horses.
Horses also worked the bottom section of the line and the tracks ran onto a wharf and into two mills. Another notable feature on the bottom section is an iron bridge that carries the line across the River Goyt.

===Peak Forest Canal===
The Peak Forest Canal and basin were built in the 1790s and opened on 1 May 1800. An important Grade 2 listed building at the head of the Peak Forest Canal was the Transhipment Warehouse, built in 1801 and extended after the arrival of the railway in 1832. In this building, goods and minerals were transferred to and from the many working canal boats servicing local industry. The building straddles the head of the canal which is fed by the Combs and Toddbrook reservoirs to the south. The canal splits just outside Whaley Bridge, turning east to end at Buxworth basin and turning west to Marple, the Cheshire Ring and Manchester. The Goyt Way runs for from Etherow Country Park to Whaley Bridge, partly along the canal towpath, and is part of the Midshires Way which runs from Stockport through the English Midlands to Buckinghamshire.

===1872 Whaley Bridge Flood===
On 19 June 1872, a massive flood became one of the worst in English history. The town received as much as 2 inches of rain in 24 hours.

===2019 evacuation===

On 1 August 2019, part of the town was evacuated on the orders of Derbyshire Police after flooding caused damage to the dam at Toddbrook Reservoir. Parts of nearby Furness Vale and New Mills were also evacuated. The Royal Air Force and all high-volume pumping units from various fire services were drafted in, along with Chinook helicopters bringing in aggregate and providing support. The Environment Agency and Derbyshire Fire Brigade reported that the dam was at &quot;real risk of collapse&quot;, with 1,500 residents being evacuated from the town. After the first day, the water level of the dam had been reduced by half a metre, but authorities said this would need to fall several metres before it could be considered safe. The targeted reduction in the reservoir water level of was achieved on 6 August 2019.

==Governance==

===Local government===

Whaley Bridge is a civil parish with the status of a town. At the lowest level of local government is Whaley Bridge Town Council, consisting of 12 councillors. Three councillors are elected for each of the four wards of Fernilee, Furness Vale, Taxal and Yeardsley.

The next tier of local government is High Peak Borough Council. Whaley Bridge constitutes one of the borough&#x27;s 28 wards. It returns 3 of the 43 borough councillors. At the last council elections in May 2015, one Conservative Party, one Liberal Democrat and one independent councillor were elected.

The top tier of local administration is the 64-member Derbyshire County Council. The town is included in the electoral division of Whaley Bridge and Blackbrook, electing one county councillor. In the 2021 local elections, the town&#x27;s former Labour MP Ruth George was re-elected to Derbyshire County Council, defeating former Conservative MP Edwina Currie Jones.

====Civic history====
The township of Yeardsley-cum-Whaley, Cheshire, was part of the ancient parish of Taxal. In 1863 the township adopted the Local Government Act 1858 and formed a local board to govern the town. Under the Local Government Act 1894 this became Yeardsley-cum-Whaley Urban District. On the Derbyshire side of the Goyt, the parish of Fernilee was included in Chapel en le Frith Rural District. In 1936 a county review order merged the urban district with the built-up part of Fernilee to form Whaley Bridge Urban District, with the new district placed in Derbyshire.

In 1974 the Local Government Act 1972 came into force, abolishing all urban and rural districts in England and Wales, and replacing them with non-metropolitan districts. Whaley Bridge became part of the district of High Peak, with a successor parish formed for the area of the urban district. The parish council resolved that Whaley Bridge should have the status of a town.

Whaley Bridge is surrounded by, but not part of, the Peak District National Park.

==Education==
The town has two primary schools: Whaley Bridge Primary School and Taxal &amp; Fernilee Church of England Primary School. For secondary education, children must travel further afield, typically to Chapel-en-le-Frith, New Mills, Hope Valley, Buxton, Macclesfield or Stockport. Schools in these areas include Chapel-en-le-Frith High School, New Mills School, Hope Valley College, King&#x27;s School and Stockport Grammar School.

==Transport==
Whaley Bridge railway station is on the Buxton line between Manchester Piccadilly, Stockport and Buxton. There is a generally hourly service in each direction, operated by Northern Trains.

The town is served by bus services operated primarily by High Peak. This includes the 199 &quot;skyline&quot; service, which runs every 30 minutes between Buxton, Stockport and Manchester Airport. Other services in the town run to Glossop, Hayfield, Macclesfield and New Mills.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the one of the 4 local relay transmitters (Whaley Bridge, Ladder Hill, Chinley and Birch Vale ).

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Manchester on 95.1 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Midlands on 103.3 FM, and Whaley Radio, a community based station that broadcast on 107.4 FM. 

The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Buxton Advertiser&quot;. 

==Religious sites==

The Church of England parish of Whaley Bridge has two churches. St James, Taxal, stands on a site a mile from the town centre and was established in the 12th century. Parts of the fabric of the bell tower date back to that time, although the tower was rebuilt in the late 16th or early 17th century. The rest of the church building was fully rebuilt in 1825 and restored in 1889 when the chancel was also enlarged. However, many internal elements of the earlier church were retained, including the 17th-century communion rail and panelling, 18th-century monuments and a royal coat of arms from the reign of Queen Anne. It is a Grade II* listed building. Holy Trinity Church, Fernilee, was established near the town centre in 1905. Parts of the town are included in the Cheshire parish of St John, Disley, and are served by the Church of St John the Divine, Furness Vale.

The Roman Catholic Church of the Sacred Heart, Whaley Lane, serves the parish of Whaley Bridge and Disley.

The United Reformed Church and Methodists formed a local ecumenical partnership, the &quot;Whaley Bridge Uniting Partnership&quot; in 1983, subsequently joined by the Baptists. The partnership has three places of worship: Whaley Bridge Uniting Church, Fernilee Methodist Church and Kettleshulme Chapel.

The Good News Church is an evangelical church based in the Gospel Hall, Old Road.

Whaley Hall is a large detached Victorian house near Toddbrook Reservoir. Since 1979 it has been a retreat house and conference centre run by the Community of the King of Love, an ecumenical community of men and women. The painting &quot;Magistrate of Brussels&quot;, by Anthony van Dyck, hung there, unrecognised, during the first decade of the 21st century.

==Festivals and traditions==

Whaley Bridge has an annual carnival month in June. This launches on the second weekend of the month with &#x27;Whaley Water Weekend&#x27;, commonly known as W3. Launched in 2000, W3 started out as a small community event on the canal basin. It was relaunched in 2010 as a music and arts festival, building on its waterways core. The last event saw several thousand visitors, with record numbers taking advantage of free short canal boat rides and a longer heritage trip to Bugsworth Basin. In the evening crowds watched free live music on the outdoor stage. 2012 saw W3 enter into a partnership with the Canal &amp; River Trust where they adopted the canal basin and the Peak Forest canal to the Bugsworth Arm.

The weekend of W3 is followed by the Well Dressing Weekend, a traditional Derbyshire event in which the local well is decorated with large collages of cones, flower petals, etc. Carnival month ends with the Rose Queen Carnival, started over a hundred years ago, where groups of local young people from the town, Rose Queen royalty from other villages and invited bands process through the main streets in their finery and on decorated floats culminating in events, stalls and entertainment held at Whaley Bridge Bowling Club. In 2009 a fell race, known as the Whaley Waltz, was added to the Rose Queen programme, and it annually attracts over 180 runners. Organised by Goyt Valley Striders, the race starts in the centre of the village and climbs 900 ft to Windgather Rocks and finishes after crossing the River Goyt on Forge Road. Following the carnival is the Rose Queen Pet Show, where locals bring their pets to compete in different classes.

November 2012 saw the relaunch of Whaley Bridge&#x27;s firework event, with a new team of volunteers after the Round Table felt they were unable to continue. This also incorporated the town&#x27;s first lantern parade.

The final event of the year is the switching on of the Christmas tree lights outside the Jodrell Arms Hotel, close to Whaley Bridge railway station. This is usually done by the chair of the Town Council and is accompanied by seasonable music from members of Whaley Bridge Brass Band. Father Christmas traditionally arrives at the Transshipment Warehouse on the Whaley Wharf of the Peak Forest Canal on a canal boat and processes to the Mechanics&#x27; Institute accompanied by his helpers. Businesses make their contribution to the town&#x27;s Christmas decorations by way of small trees above their shops. The Town Council erects two large trees each year, the second being by the Soldier Dick public house at Furness Vale.

<doc id="869033" wikidata="Q1326011" url="?curid=869033" title="Power Glove">
<text>The Power Glove is a controller accessory for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The Power Glove gained public attention due to its early virtual reality mechanics and significant marketing. However, its two games did not sell well, as it was not packaged with a game, and it was criticized for its imprecise and difficult-to-use controls.

==Development==
The Power Glove was originally released in 1989. Though it was an officially licensed product, Nintendo was not involved in the design or release of the accessory. Rather, it was designed by Samuel Cooper Davis for Abrams/Gentile Entertainment (AGE), made by Mattel in the United States and PAX in Japan. Additional development was accomplished through the efforts of Thomas G. Zimmerman and Jaron Lanier, a virtual reality pioneer responsible for codeveloping and commercializing the DataGlove, who had made a failed attempt at a similar design for Nintendo earlier.
Mattel brought in Image Design and Marketing&#x27;s Hal Berger and Gary Yamron to develop the raw technology into a functional product. They designed Power Glove over the course of eight weeks. The Power Glove and DataGlove were based on Zimmerman&#x27;s instrumented glove. Zimmerman built the first prototype that demonstrated finger flex measurement and hand position tracking using a pair of ultrasonic transmitters. His original prototype used optical flex sensors to measure finger bending which were replaced with less expensive carbon-based flex sensors by the AGE team.

==Design and functionality==
The Power Glove is based on the patented technology of the VPL Dataglove, but with many modifications that allow it to be used with modestly performing consumer hardware and sold at an affordable price. Whereas the Dataglove can detect yaw, pitch and roll, uses fiberoptic sensors to detect finger flexure, and has a resolution of 256 positions (8 bits) per finger for four fingers (the little finger is not measured to save money, and it usually follows the movement of the ring finger), the Power Glove can only detect roll, and uses sensors coated with conductive ink; their analog signal is converted into two bits per finger. yielding a resolution of four positions (2 bits) per finger for four fingers. This allows the Power Glove to store all the finger flexure information in a single byte.
The design of the Glove was based on RoboCop from the 1987 film of the same name.

The glove has traditional NES controller buttons on the forearm as well as a program button and buttons labeled 0–9. The user presses the program button and a numbered button to input commands, such as changing the firing rate of the A and B buttons. Along with the controller, the player can perform various hand motions to control a character on screen.

==Games==

Two games were released with specific features for use with the Power Glove: &quot;Super Glove Ball&quot;, a faux-3D puzzle maze game; and &quot;Bad Street Brawler&quot;, a beat &#x27;em up. Both games are playable with the standard NES controller, but include moves that can only be used with the glove. These two games are branded as part of the &quot;Power Glove Gaming Series&quot;. Since no Power Glove-specific games ever retailed in Japan, the Power Glove was sold only as an alternative controller.

Two more games, &quot;Glove Pilot&quot; and &quot;Manipulator Glove Adventure&quot;, were announced but never released. Another unreleased game, &quot;Tech Town&quot; or &quot;Tektown&quot;, is a virtual puzzle solving game in which the player moved a robotic hand around a deserted space station type of setting, using the glove to open doors and to pick up and use tools. It can be seen in a sneak peek in the &quot;Official Power Glove Game Players Gametape&quot;.

The Power Glove was adopted by the emerging virtual reality community in the 1990s to interact with 3D worlds in a cheaper way to the popular high end DataGlove produced by VPL Research. REND386 was the bridging shareware software to support it.

==Reception==
The Power Glove sold nearly one million units and was a commercial success. However, it generally received extremely poor reception, because the controls for the glove were incredibly obtuse, making it completely impractical for almost every game on the console. Only two games were specially constructed for the Power Glove, and many users had no practical use for it for other noteworthy games of its time. Consumer complaints also noted the poor connection signal between the glove and the console, build quality of the materials, and high price point for 1989 (retail price was $100, approximately $250 in 2024).

==In popular culture==

The Power Glove is featured in the 1989 film &quot;The Wizard&quot;, wielded by antagonist Lucas Barton (Jackey Vinson), who infamously declares, &quot;I love the Power Gloveit&#x27;s so bad.&quot;

In 2013, a documentary titled &quot;The Power of Glove&quot; was put into development. The film was released in 2019.

The Power Glove was featured in the 2021 movie &quot;8-Bit Christmas&quot;, and &quot;New York Times&quot; writer Calum Marsh describes the Power Glove&#x27;s &quot;awfulness&quot; as what &quot;sets the [film&#x27;s] plot in motion&quot;.

<text>Andrey Nikolayevich Illarionov (, born 16 September 1961) is a Russian economist and former senior policy advisor to Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, from April 2000 to December 2005. Since April 2021, he is a senior fellow at the non-governmental organization Center for Security Policy, which is based out of Washington, D.C. in the United States.

He has become a vocal critic of Putin and his administration since 2003 while he was still a Putin&#x27;s adviser. In April 2022, Illarionov declared in a news interview that change in the Kremlin would happen &quot;sooner or later&quot; given that &quot;it is absolutely impossible to have any positive future for Russia with the current political regime.&quot;

== Early life ==

Andrey Illarionov was born on 16 September 1961, in Sestroretsk, a municipal town of Saint Petersburg. At fifteen he started working at a communications office (telephone and postal services) in the town of Sestroretsk. He then went on to study economics at the Leningrad State University, graduating in 1983, and receiving a Ph.D. in economics in 1987.

From 1983 to 1984, and again from 1988 to 1990 Illarionov taught for the International Economic Relations Department of Leningrad State University. From 1990 to 1992 he was senior researcher at the Regional Economic Research Department of the Saint Petersburg State University of Economics and Finance.

==Career==
From 1992 he became economic adviser to the Russian Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar and (until 1993) the first deputy head of the Economic Reform Centre of the Russian Government. From 1993 to 1994 Illarionov was the head of the Analysis and Planning Group of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the Government of Russia, Viktor Chernomyrdin, after which he went on to become the vice-president of the Leontyev International Social and Economic Research Centre, and director of the Moscow division. He created the Institute for Economic Analysis and was its director from 1994 to 2000.

Illarionov had predicted 1998 financial crisis and called for a devaluation of the Russian ruble in order to avoid the August 1998 financial meltdown.

On 12 April 2000, Illarionov was invited by Vladimir Putin to be his senior economic adviser and in May 2000 he became the personal representative of the Russian president (sherpa) in the G8. He played an important role in introducing the 13% flat income tax in Russia, in earlier repayment the Russian foreign debt, in creation the petroleum revenues-based Stabilization Fund of the Russian Federation and in bringing Russia&#x27;s full-fledged membership into the political G8.

While he was a Kremlin economic adviser, he served on the supervisory board of the Central Bank of Russia and accessed the accounts of the Russian foreign state banks. He found that in 1992 the $1 billion IMF loan to Russia was used to prevent the default of the KGB- associated Eurobank in Paris, that Yegor Gaidar was behind the scam, and that Boris Fyodorov, who was the finance minister of Russia and a close associate of Illarionov, was not told of the scam. Eurobank was one of the most important finance centers of the Soviet Union and Russia for foreign intelligence operations of the KGB and GRU. Allegedly, in 1990, the Soviet Union had a $1.75 billion loan from Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait as payment for the Soviet Union&#x27;s veto of Desert Storm. Allegedly, after the failure of Vnesheconombank (VEB) resulting in its accounts frozen on 1 January 1992, this was the first debt that the Russian government had to pay through &quot;Eurobank&quot; in Paris (&quot;Banque Commerciale pour l&#x27;Europe du Nord&quot;) and the Russian network of Roszagranbanks to the Soviet and Russian foreign intelligence associated finance centers including Evrofinance (Moscow), RTD France (Paris), Eurogrefi (Paris), and others.

On 3 January 2005 Illarionov resigned from his position as presidential representative to the G8 because of the government troops&#x27; storm of the Beslan school on 3 September 2004 leading to death of 333 children, their parents and teachers. On 21 December 2005, Illarionov declared &quot;This year Russia has become a different country. It is no longer a democratic country. It is no longer a free country&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that he had cited a recent report by the human rights observer Freedom House. On 27 December 2005, Illarionov offered his resignation as economic adviser in protest against the stealing of billions of dollars by Putin&#x27;s inner circle from the Russian state via the IPO of state-owned company Rosneft. He claimed that Russia was no longer politically free and was run by an authoritarian and corrupt elite. &quot;It is one thing to work in a country that is partly free. It is another thing when the political system has changed, and the country has stopped being free and democratic,&quot; he said. He also claimed that he had no more ability to influence the government&#x27;s course and that Kremlin put limits on him expressing his point of view. Illarionov was openly critical to such elements of the Russian economic policy as the Yukos affair, increasing influence of government officials on private sector and civil rights, as well as the Kremlin pressure on Ukraine in the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute. Illarionov has also been a proponent of recognition of Chechnya&#x27;s independence.

==Dissident life==
In October 2006, Illarionov was invited to be senior fellow at the Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity of the US libertarian think tank Cato Institute in Washington, D.C. In this position, he has stated that &quot;[Russia&#x27;s] new corporate state in which state-owned enterprises are governed by personal interests and private corporations have become subject to arbitrary intervention to serve state interests&quot; as well as &quot;new ways in which political, economic and civil liberties are being eliminated.&quot;

In October 2006, the same week as Putin declared the Assassination of Anna Politkovskaya &quot;abominable in its brutality&quot;, Illarionov took up a position with the Cato Institute.

On 14 April 2007, and 9 June 2007, Illarionov took part in opposition Dissenters&#x27; Marches in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, respectively. He then observed that the repression was &quot;brutal&quot; and that in &quot;a comparison with the 15 former Soviet republics, Russia is now third to last when it comes to economic growth.&quot;

While the Cato Institute is based in Washington, DC, Illarionov did not then plan to immigrate but rather to commute. He stopped travelling to Russia in 2017.

Illarionov is one of the 34 first signatories of the online anti-Putin manifesto &quot;Putin must go&quot;, published on 10 March 2010.

In 2012 Illarionov wrote a book chapter entitled &quot;A Few Theses on the Theory of Freedom and on Creating an Index of Freedom&quot; for the Fraser Institute. His work was developed into the Index of Freedom in the World, and later the annual Human Freedom Index.

As a well known opponent to Vladimir Putin and his policies, in December 2014 he criticized former Czech president Václav Klaus&#x27; view that the European Union and the United States did more to escalate conflict in Ukraine than Vladimir Putin did.

In January 2015 Illarionov clashed with Mikhail Khodorkovsky over the 2014 Annexation of Crimea. Even then there was discussion of the Kremlin&#x27;s &quot;hybrid war&quot;. He was then living full-time in Washington.

In March 2016 Illarionov was frustrated at the label of Russia by dissidents as a &quot;hybrid régime&quot;. Masha Gessen wrote that he felt that it was a pure dictatorship, and that “This is not a hybrid regime! Thinking about it that way is a mistake, and analytical mistakes like that can have long-term tragic consequences.”

In January 2018 Illarionov was listed with others as an advisor to the US Treasury on the régime of sanctions over Crimea. This followed on from a 17 November 2017 article that he had co-authored along with Anders Åslund, Daniel Fried and Andrei Piontkovsky for the Atlantic Council entitled &quot;How to Identify the Kremlin Ruling Elite and its Agents&quot;.

In April 2023 Illarionov co-authored the Declaration of Russia’s Democratic Forces.

== Views ==
=== Putin&#x27;s rise to power ===
Illarionov, who was an advisor to Boris Yeltsin as well as to Putin, says that &quot;Putin is an outstanding politician, and he carried out a very successful operation to win the trust of the&quot; tightly-knit group of men that then surrounded power in Russia in that era.

=== Climate change ===

In 2004 Illarionov likened the Kyoto Protocol to a &quot;concentration camp for the world economy&quot;, the Soviet-era GULag forced penal labour camps, and called the Protocol &quot;an international Auschwitz for economic growth&quot;.

=== 2008 Russo-Georgian war ===

Illarionov has questioned the official Russian version of the Russian-Georgian war that led to the Russian occupation of Georgia&#x27;s provinces South Ossetia and Abkhazia. He has provided evidence that the war was launched by the Russian leadership that started aggression against Georgia on 6 August 2008 by bringing its military into South Ossetia and escalating the situation before the Georgian side was forced to respond in the night of 8 August.

=== 2008 Russian financial crisis ===

Illarionov has also stated that Moscow&#x27;s intervention into Georgia scared away investors and was in part responsible for the 2008 Russian financial crisis. He has criticized the Russian government attacks on private sector in summer of 2008 that contributed to financial crisis.

=== 2010 Smolensk air disaster ===

In 2010 Illarionov criticised the official Russian investigation about the Smolensk air disaster and called the official version &quot;naive&quot;. He was invited into an investigative commission created by Polish parliament.

=== Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014 ===

On 4 February 2014, before the Russian intervention in Crimea, Illarionov predicted that Vladimir Putin was going to implement a military operation to effectively establish political control over Ukraine. In a 10 October 2013 interview with Serhiy Leshchenko, Illarionov revealed many of Putin&#x27;s viewpoints during the early 2000s and that Putin desired to have Kuchma use force to put down the Orange Revolution but Kuchma refused, that Putin has an imperialist vision with respect to Ukraine, and that, similar to other tyrants such as Adolf Hitler, Putin is a tyrant and will leave as Russia&#x27;s leader only in death.

In late March 2014, following the Revolution of Dignity and the annexation of Crimea by Russia, speaking to &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot;, Illarionov suggested that Vladimir Putin would seek to incorporate Ukraine, Belarus, parts of Georgia and the Baltic states&quot; into Russia.

On 9 June, he said that the beginning of the ceasefire and negotiations between the newly elected Ukrainian president Poroshenko and separatists of break-away republics at the East of Ukraine would ultimately result in a Russian attempt of establishing political control over the entirety of Ukraine.

=== Inevitable dissolution of the Russian Federation ===

In November 2018, Andrey Illarionov said in the chat of the Ukrainian portal GlavRed that the dissolution of Russian Federation is inevitable which is a natural process for multinational empires. Later in the same interview, when he was asked to name the thing that terrifies him the most in modern Russia, Illarionov listed political dictatorship, suppression of civil and political rights of citizens, and Kremlin&#x27;s neo-imperial policies towards other countries, neighbors or not.

=== 2021 US Capitol attack ===

After the events of the 2021 United States Capitol attack in Washington D.C., Illarionov wrote on his blog that the Capitol police did not provide any resistance to demonstrators and quickly fell back into the building. The blog post is named &quot;Reichstag fire&quot; stating it as a trigger for the party in power to limit civil liberties. Following his post, the libertarian Cato Institute fired Illarionov for expressing his views about the 6 January 2021 events.

=== 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine ===
On 1st February 2022, Illarionov said that &quot;Biden saves ratings with myths about &quot;Russian Armed Forces&#x27; invasion&quot; of Ukraine&quot;. He was quoted by RIAFAN.

In April 2022, Illarionov remarked during an interview with the BBC News agency that if Western countries &quot;would try to implement a real embargo on oil and gas exports from Russia&quot;, then, in response, &quot;probably within a month or two, Russian military operations in Ukraine, probably will be ceased, will be stopped&quot;. He stated that decisions involving Russian energy markets involved &quot;very effective instruments&quot; in terms of influencing senior leaders&#x27; behavior. Illarionov additionally declared that change in the Kremlin would happen &quot;sooner or later&quot; given that &quot;it is absolutely impossible to have any positive future for Russia with the current political regime&quot;.

In June 2024 Illarionov was interviewed by the &quot;Kyiv Post&quot;. He proposed that the beginning of Putin&#x27;s Ukrainian campaign occurred on 17 September 2003. In front of his high-level ministers on this day Putin laid claim to the territory of Ukraine. This was when Putin began his expansion, with the 2003 Tuzla Island conflict. Illarionov repeated this claim, which was made by him as early as summer 2014.

<doc id="869048" wikidata="Q1501273" url="?curid=869048" title="Hounsfield scale">
<text>The Hounsfield scale ( ), named after Sir Godfrey Hounsfield, is a quantitative scale for describing radiodensity. It is frequently used in CT scans, where its value is also termed CT number.

==Definition==
The Hounsfield unit (HU) scale is a linear transformation of the original linear attenuation coefficient measurement into one in which the radiodensity of distilled water at standard pressure and temperature (STP) is defined as 0 Hounsfield units (HU), while the radiodensity of air at STP is defined as −1000 HU. In a voxel with average linear attenuation coefficient formula_1, the corresponding HU value is therefore given by:

formula_2

where formula_3 and formula_4 are respectively the linear attenuation coefficients of water and air.

Thus, a change of one Hounsfield unit (HU) represents a change of 0.1% of the attenuation coefficient of water since the attenuation coefficient of air is nearly zero.

Calibration tests of HU with reference to water and other materials may be done to ensure standardised response. This is particularly important for CT scans used in radiotherapy treatment planning, where HU is converted to electron density. Variation in the measured values of reference materials with known composition, and variation between and within slices may be used as part of test procedures.

===Rationale===
The above standards were chosen as they are universally available references and suited to the key application for which computed axial tomography was developed: imaging the internal anatomy of living creatures based on organized water structures and mostly living in air, &quot;e.g.&quot; humans.

==Values for different body tissues and material ==


HU-based differentiation of material applies to medical-grade dual-energy CT scans but not to cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans, as CBCT scans provide unreliable HU readings.

Values reported here are approximations. Different dynamics are reported from one study to another.

Exact HU dynamics can vary from one CT acquisition to another due to CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters (kV, filters, reconstruction algorithms, etc.). The use of contrast agents modifies HU as well in some body parts (mainly blood).

A practical application of this is in evaluation of tumors, where, for example, an adrenal tumor with a radiodensity of less than 10 HU is rather fatty in composition and almost certainly a benign adrenal adenoma.

<text>Turbotronic is a joystick marketed by Camerica in the late 1980s. The joystick has two connectors: One with seven pins for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and one with nine pins for several Atari and Commodore home computers and game consoles, as well as the Master System.

The Turbotronic closely resembles the NES Advantage, a joystick released by Nintendo of America in 1987. In 1988, Camerica released Freedom Stick, a wireless, consumer IR version of Turbotronic exclusively for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Nintendo brought legal action against Camerica because of the products&#x27; similarity to the NES Advantage.

Camerica later redesigned Freedom Stick with an unorthodox triangular base intended for both right- and left-handed players, and called the product Supersonic the Joystick. The bottom of the joystick&#x27;s base is fitted with suction cups to stabilize it on a tabletop.

Freedom Stick and Supersonic the Joystick were among the first game controllers to communicate via infrared beam. They were contemporaneous with Broderbund&#x27;s U-Force, a game controller that made innovative use of consumer IR technology.

<doc id="869062" wikidata="Q3366024" url="?curid=869062" title="Parramatta Eels">
<text>The Parramatta Eels are an Australian professional rugby league football club based in the Sydney suburb of Parramatta that competes in the National Rugby League (NRL).

The Parramatta District Rugby League Football Club was formed in 1947, and their home ground was Cumberland Oval. After the 1981 grand final win fans damaged Cumberland Oval which was later replaced by Parramatta stadium on the same site. As of 2019, Parramatta&#x27;s home ground stadium has been rebuilt and they now play as the co-tenants at Western Sydney Stadium, which sits on the same site that was once Parramatta Stadium.

It took thirty years for the club to make the grand final, which they did in 1976 and 1977, losing on both occasions. However, this period foreshadowed their most successful period in the early 1980s, when they won four premierships and qualified for five grand finals in six seasons. This was a golden era for the club and yielded their only premiership titles. In 2016, a salary cap breach saw them stripped of their 2016 Auckland Nines premiership. The club plays in the NRL, the premier rugby league football competition in Australia. Parramatta sides are also fielded in lower grades and junior competitions run by the New South Wales Rugby League.

==History==
The playing of rugby union and rugby league in Parramatta lie in the 19th century with the formation of the Parramatta Rugby Club in 1879. With the advent of a Sydney District competition in 1900, the Parramatta club merged with Western Suburbs and played some of its matches at Cumberland Oval. On a local level, rugby league began to be played in 1910 when a district competition was formed. Other clubs in the Parramatta district also emerged; over the ensuing decades, clubs established in suburbs throughout the area.

Pressure in the area for a local club to participate in the New South Wales Rugby League premiership began in the mid-1930s with a formal proposal put to the NSWRL in 1936 by local rugby league identities such as Jack Argent and Jack Scullin. The proposal was rejected by all clubs except Western Suburbs who, despite having the most to lose from the entrance of a Parramatta side (with much of their territory being lost to Parramatta), voted for the entrance of the new club. The advent of World War II put the establishment of the club on hold and a Parramatta district club was not proposed again until 1946 when the club was successfully admitted into the Premiership.

===Foundation and early years===

Parramatta saw very little success in their early years, despite narrowly missing out on finals qualification in 1949 under the guidance of former Western Suburbs and Leeds five-eighth Vic Hey. Between 1952 and 1961, they finished last eight times and won only 35 of 180 matches. The reasons behind the club doing so poorly in the early years was due to a lack of resources and a weak playing roster. Where other teams fielded test and representative players, Parramatta fielded mainly amateur players or park footballers. The only players of note during this dark period were Billy Rayner and Brian Hambly.

In 1962, Parramatta made the finals for the first time; this achievement was repeated for the three following seasons under coach Ken Kearney. Around this time the club managed to finally attract better players such as Ken Thornett, Dick Thornett and Bob O&#x27;Reilly. However, the club slid back down the ladder in the following years, collecting the wooden spoon in 1970 and 1972. The club&#x27;s first major success came in 1975 when they defeated Manly-Warringah in the pre-season cup final.

===1970s===
In 1976, the club finally reached the grand final, in their thirtieth season. However, they lost narrowly to a Manly-Warringah side that they had defeated just two weeks earlier. Both clubs had been admitted into the NSWRFL in 1947, and Parramatta were in their first grand final while Manly were in their eighth premiership decider (having qualified for their first in 1951) and were bidding for their third premiership after wins in 1972 and 1973. Unfortunately for Parramatta, this game is regarded as &quot;the one that got away&quot; with Manly winning 13-10 despite the Eels crossing for two tries to Manly&#x27;s one. A dropped pass by winger Neville Glover with the line wide open in the dying moments of the game ultimately costing the Eels a chance to win the game. Had Glover scored the score would have been tied at 13-all giving goal kicking John Peard a sideline conversion attempt to win the game.

The following year, Parramatta captured their first minor premiership before qualifying for the grand final for the second year running. Against St. George, the match was drawn 9-9, forcing a replay the following weekend. In this match, Parramatta lost 22–0. The Eels made the finals in both 1978 and 1979, but missed the finals in 1980 for the first time since 1974.

===1980s===

The early 1980s was the most successful period for Parramatta, who earned five grand final appearances and four premierships from 1981 to 1986. Under the influence of coach Jack Gibson and with a team including names such as Ray Price, Peter Sterling, Eric Grothe, Sr., Steve Ella, Mick Cronin, and Brett Kenny the club captured three consecutive premierships from 1981 to 1983, beating the Newtown Jets in 1981 and the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in 1982 and 1983. In 1984 the team once again reached the Grand Final, but lost in a low-scoring game to the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs 6–4. In 1986, the club took out their third minor premiership while also reaching the grand final, beating Canterbury 4–2 in the second lowest-scoring decider in history. This win proved to be most notably among the victories in the clubs history, ending Canterbury&#x27;s two year premiership winning streak. The fourth premiership victory capped off a strong period for the club, between 1975 and 1986, the club had only missed the finals once and played in seven grand finals, winning four.

===1990s===
From 1987 to 1996, the Parramatta club failed to make the finals. With the advent of the Super League war in the mid-1990s, Parramatta capitalised on staying with the Australian Rugby League by picking up high-profile players such as Dean Pay, Jason Smith, Jim Dymock and Jarrod McCracken from the 1995 premiership-winning side, the Sydney Bulldogs.

In 1997, the Eels remained in the ARL&#x27;s competition and made the finals for the first time in 11 seasons by finishing third in the Australian Rugby League competition. Parramatta continued into the NRL era which began in 1998, surviving the reduction in teams at the end of the twentieth century. In the 1998 NRL season Parramatta finished 4th and defeated North Sydney in the first week of the finals 25–12. The following week Parramatta traveled to Brisbane in the major semi final and won the match 15-10 earning the week off.

In the 1998 preliminary final Parramatta were leading arch rivals Canterbury 18–2 with less than 10 minutes to play only for Canterbury to fight their way back into the match and with a minute left on the scoreboard, winger Daryl Halligan kicked a conversion from out on the far touchline to send the game into extra time. Canterbury won in extra time 32–20. The loss was hard to take for Parramatta as they had beaten eventual premiers Brisbane twice during the season.

In 1999, Parramatta led Melbourne 16–0 at halftime in the preliminary final only to lose 18–16 at full time. Melbourne went on to win the premiership the following week. In the 2000 NRL season, Parramatta finished 7th and won both their sudden death finals matches to take on Brisbane in the preliminary final. In a game that they were not expected to win, Parramatta came close but lost the match against a much stronger Brisbane side. This was their 3rd preliminary final loss in a row.

===2000s===

The Eels reached the 2001 NRL Grand final after a dominant regular season, where they scored a total of 839 points and lost only 4 matches, but were defeated by the Newcastle Knights 30–24. The week leading up to the grand final itself is also remembered for The infamous 2001 grand final breakfast where coach Brian Smith and the Parramatta players attended wearing as Newcastle player Mark Hughes described &quot;Miami Vice black suits&quot;. Another Newcastle player Ben Kennedy reflected on the game saying &quot;They came into the game under a sh*tload of pressure but for us, it was just a good time and a heap of fun. Parra were sh*tting themselves and we were just having a good time&quot;. Andrew Johns also reportedly could tell how nervous the Parramatta players were and knew they had a chance at making an upset.

In 2005, Parramatta finished as minor premiers in the regular season and came up against North Queensland in the preliminary final. In a game that Parramatta were expected to win, North Queensland defied the odds and won the match 29–0. In 2006, Parramatta finished 8th in the regular season and faced Melbourne in the first week of the finals losing 12–6 and thus being eliminated from the competition. In 2007, Parramatta again made the preliminary final and once more the opponent was Melbourne. Parramatta went on to lose the match 26–10. This was their 5th preliminary final loss in nine years.

In 2009, under new coach Daniel Anderson, the Eels had an indifferent start to the season which saw the release of star halfback Brett Finch. After 18 rounds and incredibly inconsistent form, the Parramatta Eels had won only 5 games and were sitting third-last and were in direct contention for the dreaded 2009 NRL Wooden Spoon. TAB SportsBet had the Eels as $151 outsiders to win the NRL Premiership.

Though beginning in Round 19, upset victories against the Melbourne Storm and the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs set the platform for an unexpected 10 wins from the next 11 games, which propelled the Eels into the Top 8 and consequently, premiership contention. This unanticipated winning streak was directly attributed by many sporting experts including Rugby League legend Andrew Johns to the spectacular run of form of star fullback Jarryd Hayne. Winning the award for man-of-the-match in every game from Round 19–24, and again in the first week of the finals, Hayne was described as &quot;the best player in any code of football in Australia&quot; by premiership-winning coach Phil Gould. Following his astonishing string of 7-man-of-the-match performances, Hayne won the award for Dally M Fullback of the Year and was crowned the best and fairest player in the game, winning the Dally M Medal for 2009.

After a 7-game winning streak, the Eels succumbed to a heavy defeat by the minor premiers St George-Illawarra Dragons, however they returned to Kogarah in Week 1 of the 2009 NRL Finals Series and defeated the Dragons 25–12 featuring an impressive late game try by Dally M medal winner Jarryd Hayne. Following successive wins against the Gold Coast Titans (a team that Parramatta had never beaten before), 27–2 at SFS and Canterbury-Bankstown, 22–12 in front of a record-breaking non-grand final crowd of 74,549 at ANZ stadium, the Eels qualified for their first grand final since 2001. On 4 October 2009, Parramatta Eels played the deciding game of NRL, against the Melbourne Storm at ANZ Stadium in front of a crowd of 82,538. The Melbourne Storm defeated the Eels 23–16, ending what critics called &quot;the Parramatta Fairytale&quot; and winning the NRL Premiership. Such was the euphoria at the time with Parramatta making an incredible run to the 2009 grand final that the then NSW Premier Nathan Rees pledged that if Parramatta were to win the premiership he would rename two of the new trains due to be rolled out across The Sydney network the following year. The names of the new trains were to be &quot;The Hayne Train&quot; and &quot;The Fuifui Moimoi Express&quot;. They were to be painted blue and gold, and run along the western line of the railway network.

===2010s===

On 22 April 2010, the Melbourne Storm were stripped of the premiership as a result of long-term gross salary cap breaches disclosed by the NRL. However, the premiership for 2009 was not handed over to the Parramatta Eels, instead remaining vacant.

In 2010, the Parramatta club were picked at the beginning of the year by many leading betting agencies to take out the premiership for 2010 following their surge of form which took them to the grand final in 2009. But, after a relatively poor start to the season, and then a 4-game winning streak, the Parramatta side once again returned to the inconsistent form of past seasons. This inconsistent form, recognised by all Rugby League fans, saw them miss out on the Top 8 in 2010.

After a season of unrelenting disappointment which saw five-eighth Daniel Mortimer dropped to reserve grade, centre Timana Tahu being suspended for an on-field confrontation against the Newcastle Knights and reports of player rifts, Daniel Anderson was sacked unceremoniously as Parramatta coach and replaced by New Zealand World Cup-winning coach Stephen Kearney.

The Parramatta club made several new player signings for the 2011 season. In the forwards, the Eels added former Queensland centre Carl Webb and former Bulldogs and Cronulla as well as one-time Kangaroo Reni Maitua. To bolster the backs after the retirement of Eric Grothe Jr and the departure of Timana Tahu, the Eels signed the experienced pair of Chris Walker and Chris Hicks.

The 2011 season was to be considered a year of &quot;almosts&quot; for Parramatta, with the team losing over half of their matches by four points or fewer, many of which were conceded after attaining leads over their opponents. Parramatta pushed a record four games into Golden Point during the season, however were unable to win any, resulting in a draw against the St. George Illawarra Dragons and one-point losses to the Penrith Panthers, Sydney Roosters and the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs.

Throughout the 2011 season, coach Stephen Kearney motioned several reshuffles of the Parramatta side, the most high-profile change being fullback Jarryd Hayne&#x27;s switch to five-eighth after his ball-playing abilities were considered by several experts including the NSW State of Origin coach Ricky Stuart, as his strongest point. Other switches include the moving of Luke Burt to fullback, second-rower Ben Smith to right centre, and the resting of five-eighth Daniel Mortimer.

Before the final match of their season, Parramatta had won only five of their 24 games and were in contention for the dreaded wooden spoon. During their final match, the Parramatta side emerged victorious over the Gold Coast Titans who were also direct contenders for last place. The wooden spoon was awarded to the Gold Coast side, finishing 16th on the NRL ladder, the club finishing in 14th position.

The 2012 season saw the retirement of Parramatta legends Luke Burt and Nathan Hindmarsh. It would also mark the first time since 1972 that the team would succumb to the dreaded wooden spoon. Parramatta struggled all year, securing just their first win of the season in Round 5 against defending premiers Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles before ending a six-game losing streak against the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. This horror start to the season, and a win rate of less than 25% over almost two seasons with the club, coach Stephen Kearney was forced to resign and Assistant Coach Brad Arthur would become caretaker. The team responded to this producing 3 wins from 4 games, including competition front-runners Melbourne Storm and Brisbane Broncos to give the fans some hope for the rest of the season. However this was short lived and following a 38-6 thumping to the South Sydney Rabbitohs in Round 25 of the Telstra Premiership were officially unable to avoid the wooden spoon.

Whilst Parramatta&#x27;s problems in 2012 were largely attributed to their relatively poor defence, numerous pundits blamed them on the recurring absences of star fullback Jarryd Hayne. Even whilst producing higher per-match statistics than any other fullback in the game (8 tries, 14 try-assists), Hayne only managed to complete 10 games from the season&#x27;s 24, due to both injury and State of Origin duty.

Throughout the season many of the Parramatta players came under scrutiny and were dropped to the NSW Cup, including high-profile recruit Chris Sandow, who at the time was touted as overweight and unfit, and veteran Luke Burt. As a result, players Matt Ryan, Jake Mullaney and Nathan Smith were called up to the top squad and have impressed in their roles of Second-Row, Fullback and Hooker respectively, making a suitable replacement for injured stars Jarryd Hayne and Matt Keating.

Towards the end of the season Ricky Stuart was announced as the new coach for the Parramatta Eels from 2013.
In June 2013, head coach Ricky Stuart told twelve Parramatta players via an overhead projector that their services would not be required beyond the 2013 season.

Another wooden spoon followed at the end of 2013, with the club suffering their second biggest loss ever (4–64 to Melbourne in round 24), and conceding three other scores of 50 or more. On 12 September 2013, it was announced Ricky Stuart would leave Parramatta to take up the head coaching role at Canberra for the 2014 season.

Parramatta were determined to continue their rebuilding process in the off-season after receiving the wooden spoon two years running. The club did this by releasing
the aforementioned twelve players and signing more in key areas to help them achieve success in the 2014 season.

Parramatta also recruited a new coach in Brad Arthur, formerly an Assistant Coach at the club, as Ricky Stuart reneged on the final two years of his contract. This was in order to return to his hometown of Canberra, the team he played for during his youth. Before the 2014 season started, Brad Arthur and Parramatta implemented a new recruitment policy and made strong signings including future NSW hooker Nathan Peats, promising star Corey Norman and William Hopoate who was a 2011 premiership winner and NSW representative before leaving rugby league to join a two-year Mormon mission.

The 2014 season started off in great style as Parramatta won four out of their first six matches. Parramatta then went into their Easter Monday clash at Stadium Australia sitting 5th on the ladder but lost the match controversially 21–18 in front of 50,000 fans. In round 24 Parramatta were sitting 8th on the ladder and looked destined to play in the finals for the first time since 2009 and only needed to win one of their last two remaining games against sides lower than them on the table which were Canberra and Newcastle. Parramatta lost both matches and missed out on the finals series by two competition points.

The 2015 season was a year to forget for Parramatta as they finished 12th on the table. The highlights being in round 1 when Parramatta defeated Manly 42–12 and Semi Radradra scoring 24 tries in 18 matches.

====2016 salary cap breach====

The discovery by the NRL in 2016 of salary cap breaches, over a period of four years, resulted in it stripping the Parramatta club of the twelve competition points the club has accrued so far in the 2016 NRL season. In addition to being fined $1 million, Parramatta also had its 2016 NRL Auckland Nines title revoked. On 19 July 2016 the Parramatta Leagues Club board was sacked by the Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority, and an administrator appointed. This effectively also removed the Parramatta board as the seven directors on both boards were the same people. Max Donnelly, of Ferrier Hodgson was appointed as administrator. At the time of the 12-point deduction, Parramatta were sitting 5th on the ladder but then found themselves at 14th position. 

Prior to the start of the 2016 NRL season, the Parramatta Eels faced the prospect with starting the season on -4 points due to salary cap indiscretions in 2015, however the NRL was satisfied with governance changes at the Eels and no points were deducted.

However, it was revealed in March that third-party payments had been made by several companies to several players, which is strictly prohibited in the NRL.

On 3 May 2016, NRL CEO Todd Greenberg announced that the club would be docked the twelve competition points they have accrued so far this season, as well as fined $1 million and stripped of the 2016 NRL Auckland Nines title it won in February. In addition, the NRL also announced that the Eels would not be able to accrue any further competition points until they fall under the salary cap, which they were reported to be $500,000 over as of 3 May 2016. Five officials, including chairman Steve Sharp, deputy chairman Tom Issa, director Peter Serrao, chief executive John Boulous and football manager Daniel Anderson, were also sacked.

On 9 July, after over 2 months of club officials contesting the preliminary penalties, Parramatta were handed their punishment with the addition of their for/against points tally accumulated from rounds 1-9 being deducted.

The main point of interest in this episode was the manner of the punishment when compared to the Melbourne Storm salary cap breach in 2010, while the Melbourne Storm were not allowed to play for points for the whole season the Parramatta Eels were permitted to play for points as soon as they fell back in line with the cap. It was acknowledged that this change was made due to the demoralising nature of the Storm punishment and having to witness a team running out week after week with nothing to play for.

The aftermath ended with Parramatta hooker Nathan Peats being squeezed out of the club, so the club would be just under the salary cap and start playing for competition points for the remainder of the season. Though this did very little for the troubled club finishing the NRL season 13th on the ladder winning only six of their last 14 matches.

Their first match played after the points deduction was against South Sydney at Parramatta Stadium, Parramatta lost the match 22–20 in a close game. 2016 would also prove to be the final year that Parramatta would play at Parramatta Stadium as it was due to be demolished at seasons end to make way for a new 30,000-seat stadium. The final home game played at Parramatta Stadium was against The St. George in front of 13,553 spectators. Parramatta went on to beat St. George 30–18. Parramatta&#x27;s final game of 2016 saw them travel to New Zealand to play The Auckland Warriors. Parramatta won the match 40–18 with Bevan French scoring 3 tries. At the end of the season, Parramatta finished in 14th place on the ladder but had they not been stripped of the 12 competition points they would have played in the finals. The 2016 season was also difficult for Parramatta as to become salary cap compliant the club needed to release players such as Nathan Peats and Junior Paulo to be able to play for points. Star recruit Kieran Foran who signed only months earlier on a $1 million a year contract also walked out on the club mid-season due to numerous personal problems and off field issues.

The 2017 season saw a major turnaround for the club with Parramatta finishing fourth on the table and making the finals for the first time since 2009. Some of the highlights throughout the year were the club winning nine out of their final ten matches and defeating Brisbane twice including a 52–34 win at Suncorp Stadium and eventual premiers Melbourne. Parramatta then went on to play premiership favorites Melbourne in the first qualifying final, going into the second half Parramatta had stunned everyone by leading the match and it took Melbourne the last play of the game to hold on and win 18–16. The following week, Parramatta played against North Queensland in the sudden death elimination final. Parramatta led 10–6 at halftime but went on to lose the match 24–16 in what would be one of the biggest upsets of the season.

For the 2018 season, Parramatta were predicted by many before the season to finish in the top 8 and challenge for the premiership. Those predictions were matched in the opening round of the season as Parramatta lead Penrith 14–0 early on but after a second half capitulation lost the game 24–14. In Round 2, Parramatta were humiliated 54–0 by Manly at Brookvale Oval. Parramatta went on to lose the opening 6 games of the season before eventually winning their first game of the season defeating Manly 44–10 in Round 7. In Round 8, Parramatta defeated Wests 24–22 to make it back to back victories for the club. The Eels then went on to lose the next 5 games in a row before eventually winning their third game of the season defeating North Queensland 20–14 in Darwin in which Jarryd Hayne returned from injury scoring two tries. The following weeks were filled with disappointment as the club came close to pulling off upset wins against top of the table St George only for the club to concede two tries in 5 minutes to lose 20–18 and South Sydney after leading 20–6 late into the game only for The Rabbitohs to score late tries and win 26–20. In Round 18, Parramatta lost 18–16 to Newcastle with The Eels being denied a last minute try after it was ruled winger Bevan French had put his foot over the sideline. The following week, Parramatta defeated arch rivals Canterbury 14–8 in what the media dubbed the &quot;Spoon Bowl&quot;. There were hopes that Parramatta could avoid the wooden spoon as going into the second last game of the season the club sat above North Queensland on the table due to for and against. In what was the retiring Jonathan Thurston&#x27;s final home game, both clubs needed a win to avoid the wooden spoon. North Queensland won the match 44–6. In the final game of the season, Parramatta were defeated 44–10 by the Sydney Roosters ensuring that the club finished last and claimed their 14th wooden spoon and the Roosters claiming the minor premiership. Before the match, the Roosters needed to defeat Parramatta by 27 points to overtake Melbourne and finish first on the table.

Before the start of the 2019 NRL season, Parramatta were predicted by many to finish towards the bottom of the table or claim another wooden spoon. The club started off the year with back to back victories over Penrith and arch rivals Canterbury-Bankstown. In Round 6 of the 2019 NRL season, Parramatta played their first game at the new Western Sydney Stadium against the Wests Tigers and ran out 51–6 winners in front of a sold-out crowd.

In Round 9 against Melbourne, Parramatta suffered one of their worst ever defeats losing 64–10 at Suncorp Stadium. In the aftermath of the defeat, coach Brad Arthur and the players were placed under intense scrutiny but just a week after the loss, Arthur was given a two-year contract extension by the Parramatta board. The club would then go on to lose against North Queensland and last placed Penrith in the coming weeks.

Between Round 12 and Round 22 of the 2019 season, Parramatta would go on to win 8 of their 10 games. In Round 22 against the Gold Coast Titans, Parramatta qualified for the 2019 finals series with a 36–12 victory at Cbus Super Stadium.

At the end of the 2019 regular season, Parramatta finished 5th on the table and qualified for the finals. In the elimination final against Brisbane, Parramatta won the match 58–0 at the new Western Sydney Stadium. The victory was the biggest finals win in history, eclipsing Newtown&#x27;s 55–7 win over St George in 1944. The match was also Parramatta&#x27;s biggest win over Brisbane and Brisbane&#x27;s worst ever loss since entering the competition in 1988. The following week against Melbourne in the elimination semi final, Parramatta were defeated 32–0 at AAMI Park which ended their season. The loss against Melbourne was also the sixth time Parramatta had been defeated by Melbourne in a finals game since 1999.

===2020s===
At the start of the 2020 NRL season, Parramatta won their first five matches in a row which put them at the top of the table. It was the club&#x27;s best start to a season since 1989. At the end of the 2020 regular season, Parramatta finished in third place on the table and secured a top four spot. It was the club&#x27;s highest finish on the table since 2005. In the qualifying final, Parramatta lead Melbourne 12–0 early on before losing the match 36–24 at Suncorp Stadium. The following week in the elimination final, Parramatta played against South Sydney for the first time in a finals game since 1965. Parramatta lead the match 18–8 before a second half capitulation saw them lose 38–24 ending their season.

Parramatta started the 2021 NRL season with four consecutive victories before losing to St. George Illawarra in round 5. They then won the next five matches in a row to sit second on the competition ladder after ten rounds. By round 18, the club sat entrenched within the top four of the competition with a six-point gap ahead of the fifth and sixth placed Sydney Roosters and Manly-Warringah. The club then suffered an end of season slump losing to Canberra, an understrength Sydney Roosters side 28–0 and then two heavy defeats against South Sydney and Manly. Parramatta recovered to defeat North Queensland and then pulled off one of the upsets in 2021, defeating Melbourne 22–10 which ended their 19-game winning streak. Parramatta would end the 2021 regular season in sixth place. In week one against Newcastle in the elimination final, Parramatta won a close match 28–20. The following week, Parramatta lost 8–6 in the lowest scoring match of the year against Penrith in the second week of the finals which ended their season.

Parramatta started the 2022 NRL season winning four of their opening five matches. Throughout the 2022 regular season, Parramatta struggled with consistency. Although they defeated Penrith and Melbourne twice, the club only managed to win more than three games consecutively on two separate occasions and lost to eventual wooden spooners the Wests Tigers in round 6 of the competition. In round 14, Parramatta suffered an embarrassing 34–4 loss against arch-rivals Canterbury who were sitting bottom of the table. In round 22, Parramatta were defeated 26-0 by South Sydney which saw them fall to seventh on the table. However, Parramatta would win their final three games in convincing fashion to finish fourth. In week one of the finals, Parramatta were defeated 27–8 by Penrith before bouncing back the following week against Canberra in the elimination final 40–4 to reach their first preliminary final since 2009. In the preliminary final, Parramatta pulled off one of the biggest upsets in the NRL era defeating North Queensland 24–20 in Townsville to reach the grand final. In the 2022 NRL Grand Final against Penrith, Parramatta trailed 18–0 at half-time before going on to lose 28–12.

Parramatta started the 2023 NRL season with three straight losses, all of which were by four points. In round 1, the club lost in golden point extra-time to Melbourne, followed by a four-point loss to Cronulla and then another defeat against Manly at Brookvale Oval. In round 4, Parramatta defeated back to back premiers Penrith 17–16 in golden point extra-time with Mitchell Moses kicking the winning field goal.
Between rounds 12–17, Parramatta recorded five straight victories including an upset victory over South Sydney in round 12. In round 17, the club recorded their highest ever first half score in a game as they lead the Dolphins 42–4 at half-time before going on to win 48–20. The victory elevated the club up to fifth place on the table.
In round 19, Parramatta suffered their biggest loss of the year losing 46–10 against the New Zealand Warriors with a number of key players missing due to injury and State of Origin selection. All of Parramatta&#x27;s previous losses in the season were by ten points or less.
Following their loss to New Zealand, the club suffered a form slump only winning two of their next six matches which included heavy losses to Melbourne and Brisbane. Parramatta&#x27;s season was officially ended in round 25 when they lost against the Sydney Roosters 34-12 which meant the club could not make the finals.
The following week, Parramatta pulled off one of the biggest upsets in the 2023 season defeating Penrith 32–18. Parramatta would miss out on the top 8 by two points with an eventual finish of 10th place.

Parramatta started the 2024 NRL season with a 26-8 victory over arch-rivals Canterbury. Following the clubs round 3 victory over Manly, Parramatta were dealt a huge blow with halfback Mitchell Moses suffering a foot injury which ruled him on indefinitely. In round 4, the club would succumb to an embarrassing defeat against the Wests Tigers who had finished the previous two seasons with the Wooden Spoon. Captain Clint Gutherson had a penalty goal attempt after the full-time siren to win the game which he missed with Wests winning 17-16. In round 7, Parramatta were beaten 44-16 by the Dolphins at TIO Stadium in Darwin. The Dolphins had seven starting players ruled out of the game with injury and head coach Wayne Bennett was also missing due to illness. The score was in favour of Parramatta 8-4 at half-time, however in the second half the club would capitulate conceding eight tries in under 25 minutes.
Following the clubs 48-16 loss against Melbourne at Magic Round, head coach Brad Arthur was terminated by Parramatta ending his ten-year tenure in charge. Trent Barrett was named as the clubs interim head coach for the rest of the 2024 season.
On the same day it was reported that Parramatta had been in talks with Wayne Bennett to become the new head coach whilst Arthur was still in charge but Bennett opted to sign a three-year deal with South Sydney.
In round 12 of the 2024 NRL season, Parramatta suffered one of their most embarrassing losses in recent times losing 42-26 against South Sydney who were bottom of the table and only had one win to their name prior to the match. Souths also had eight first team players out and had lost their previous six games in a row.
On 8 July 2024, the club announced that Jason Ryles would be appointed as the new head coach of the side on a four-year deal starting in 2025.
The club would manage to avoid the wooden spoon in the final game of the regular season after defeating the Wests Tigers 60-26 in the &quot;Spoon Bowl&quot; game. Due to other results going their way, Parramatta would finish 15th on the table.

==Club identity==

===Kit sponsors and manufacturers===
===Name and emblem===
Like most NSWRFL clubs founded before the 1980s, Parramatta was established with no official nickname or mascot. The only nickname Parramatta had ever been known by was the &quot;Fruitpickers&quot;, a reference to the orchards spread throughout the District and surrounding suburbs in the first half of the 20th century. As the competition and the clubs themselves became more focused on marketing in the 1970s, Parramatta adopted an official club mascot.

In the mid-1960s, Peter Frilingos, a Sydney rugby league journalist, suggested that the club should be known as the &quot;Eels&quot;. This reasoning was based on the name of the Parramatta, anglicised from the Aboriginal dialect &quot;Barramattagal&quot; meaning &quot;place where the Eels dwell&quot;. After this, the team was commonly called &quot;The Eels&quot; and it became an official nickname in the late 1970s.

As a result, the club&#x27;s crest was changed in 1980, to a design featuring an eel. This crest remained, despite several changes in jersey design, until a new eel logo was introduced in 2000. In 2004, the club mascot featured on the crest reverted to an eel drawing similar to that featured on the original crest.

Parramatta has also used two separate crests based on Parramatta City&#x27;s crest. The first was a highly detailed scene showing a typical scene on the foreshore of the Parramatta River in the early days of European settlement. It is an apparent tribute to the District&#x27;s original occupants, the Barramattagal tribe. In the foreground of the original crest, a male Aboriginal is preparing to spear a fish while a woman in a canoe watches. In the background a paddle steamer is visible as well as the tree-lined banks of the Parramatta River. This crest was used by the club until the 1970s when a more stylised version showing only the hunter, and the club&#x27;s name on a scroll, was used. This crest is still used in 2006 by the Parramatta District Junior Rugby League Football Club.

In 2009, the Parramatta Eels announced they were returning to their original 1980s club emblem in the 2011 season with the numbers 1947 added, this being the year of conception of the Eels.

===Colours===
When a Parramatta District Club was first proposed in 1936, the colours put forward to the New South Wales Rugby League by the District were emerald green and white, as these were the colours worn by the Western Districts President&#x27;s Cup side and the Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club. However, when the proposal for a Parramatta club was next put to the NSWRL in 1946, the proposed colours for the new District side were blue and gold. These colours are said to have been selected based on the navy blue, sky blue and gold colours used by Arthur Phillip High School. These colours were also adopted by the Parramatta District Rugby Union club in 1936 and also suggested in Parramatta City Council&#x27;s use of livery of blue and golden-orange in their crest. While this colour scheme has remained consistent throughout the history of the club, the shades of blue and gold have changed several times.

The original Parramatta jersey used in 1947 was of a blue design with a single yellow hoop around the middle of the jersey, extending across the sleeves. This original design was altered in 1949 to a design based on blue and gold hoops and remained unchanged until the 1970s when a jersey comprising stripes on a predominantly blue or gold background was adopted. Over the years, the design has changed gradually from one based on blue and gold stripes to a design incorporating different blue and gold designs around the fringes of a predominantly blue or gold jersey.

===Primary jerseys===
==Stadium==
Rugby league was played at Cumberland Oval from as early as 1909 by local clubs such as Parramatta Iona, Endeavours and the Western Districts representative side. When the club was admitted into the NSWRL Premiership in 1947, Cumberland Oval became its home ground. The club played its first match in the premiership on 12 April 1947 against Newtown, being defeated 34–12 in front of 6,000 spectators. Cumberland Oval remained the home ground of the Parramatta Eels until 1981; the club played their last match there against the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. Later that year, after the Parramatta Eels secured their first-ever Premiership trophy, Eels fans rallied at Cumberland Oval; during the celebrations, fans set fire to the ground&#x27;s soon-to-be-demolished stand.

From 1982 to 1985, the club used Belmore Oval, home of the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, as a temporary home ground while a new facility Parramatta Stadium was built. The new stadium to be built on the site of Cumberland Oval was approved by the New South Wales Government for development in 1983 and the contract for the construction and design of the Stadium was put to competitive tender. After construction was completed in November 1985, the club played its first match at the new stadium on 16 March 1986 winning this opening game 36–6 against the St. George Dragons. The original capacity of the ground stood at 30,000, though after re-development of the hills behind each in-goal area into seated terraces in 2002, the capacity was reduced to 21,487.

The largest crowd to watch a rugby league match at Cumberland Oval was 22,470 when the Parramatta took on the South Sydney Rabbitohs on 26 April 1971. The largest crowd at Parramatta Stadium under the current configuration was 21,141 in 2006 against the Wests Tigers. The largest ever attendance for a Parramatta Eels home game came in the stadium&#x27;s first season when 27,243 saw the Eels draw 12-all with South Sydney in Round 24 of the 1986 NSWRL season. The largest ever rugby league attendance at Parramatta Stadium was set on 6 July 1994 when 27,918 saw Australia defeat France 58–0 in a one-off mid-season Test match. This was also the first test match held in Sydney since 1914 that wasn&#x27;t played at either the Agricultural Ground, the SCG, or the Sydney Football Stadium.

Parramatta Stadium was closed &amp; demolished in 2017 with Western Sydney Stadium being built in the same location. This stadium has a 30,000 seat capacity and was opened in 2019. The first NRL match to be played at the new venue was in Round 6 2019 between Parramatta and Wests Tigers. Parramatta won the match 51–6 in front of a full house. While CommBank Stadium was under construction, Parramatta played home games at ANZ Stadium between 2017 and the first few rounds of 2019.
The Eels currently share a Western Sydney Stadium with many NRL clubs such as the Wests Tigers and arch-rivals Canterbury-Bankstown.

==Rivalries==
===Parramatta Eels–Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles rivalry===

Parramatta has a rivalry with Northern Beaches-based club Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. Though both clubs were formed in the same year, this rivalry did not develop until the 1970s and 1980s when the clubs faced each other in three grand finals: in 1976, 1982 and 1983. The clubs also competed in several play-off finals matches during this period including a controversial drawn semi-final and subsequent replay in 1978. The famous rivalry between the clubs was also marked in an advertising jingle in a 1970s Tooheys television commercial. The rivalry has been regularly rekindled at various times since, particularly when Parramatta players have transferred to play with Manly. Since their 2005 finals series clash, Parramatta and Manly have not played each other in a finals game since and have not played against each other in a grand final since 1983.

On 18 May 2003, Parramatta and Manly played in the first ever golden point match in NRL history. Manly would win the match 36–34 at Brookvale Oval courtesy of a Ben Walker penalty goal.
In round 2 of the 2018 NRL season, Parramatta suffered their worst ever loss to Manly. The game was played in temperatures of nearly 40 degrees where Manly ran out 54-0 winners.
In the 2019 NRL season, Parramatta beat Manly in round 25 to take Manly&#x27;s 5th spot on the ladder and would go on to beat Brisbane 58–0 in the elimination final. The victory is currently the biggest win in finals history.
In round 11 of the 2022 NRL season, Manly lead Parramatta by ten points in the second half before Parramatta scored two tries to make it 20-20. Parramatta player Mitchell Moses then converted a goal from the side line to win the match 22–20.
In round 21 of the 2022 NRL season, the two sides met at Brookvale Oval where Manly needed to defeat Parramatta if they were to stand any chance of reaching the finals. Parramatta would win the game 36–20 with the maligned Jakob Arthur providing two try assists for Parramatta which ended Manly&#x27;s finals hopes.

Since the 2000s, the rivalry has seen numerous player swaps or players who have featured for both clubs which in the early days was a rare occurrence of the fixture. Such players who have been at both clubs since 2000 include Jamie Lyon, Daniel Heckenberg, Shayne Dunley, Kylie Leuluai, Michael Witt, Aaron Cannings, Jack Afamasaga, Feleti Mateo, Richard Faʻaoso, Blake Green, Joe Galuvao, Tony Williams, Jeff Robson, Jonathan Wright, Justin Horo, Chris Hicks, Cheyse Blair, Darcy Lussick, Kelepi Tanginoa, Brayden Wiliame, Daniel Harrison, William Hopoate, David Gower, Anthony Watmough, Clinton Gutherson, Kieran Foran, Siosaia Vave, Shaun Lane, Andrew Davey, Joey Lussick, Michael Oldfield, Morgan Harper and Kelma Tuilagi.

===Parramatta Eels–Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs rivalry===
The most significant rivalry is with the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs and began in the early days between the two sides. The rivalry grew further during the 1980s when the clubs faced one another in grand finals in 1984 and 1986 as well as regular play-off matches during this period.

This rivalry received renewed impetus during the Super League war when Parramatta recruited four notable Canterbury players.

In 1998, Parramatta and Canterbury played against each other in the preliminary final with the winners to play the Brisbane Broncos in the grand final. Parramatta were leading the match 18–2 with under 10 minutes to play until what happened next can only be described as one of the greatest capitulations in finals history. Canterbury scored three tries in ten minutes and took the game to extra time winning the game 32–20.
In the 2005 NRL season, Parramatta recorded the biggest victory between the two clubs when they defeated Canterbury 56–4 at Parramatta Stadium.
Parramatta would need to wait nine years to exact their revenge on Canterbury for the 1998 preliminary final when they played in the 2007 elimination final and won the match 25–6. On 15 March 2008, Parramatta came from 20-0 down at half-time against Canterbury to win 28–20.
Later in the 2008 NRL season, Parramatta and Canterbury met in round 24 with Canterbury needing to defeat Parramatta in order to avoid the Wooden Spoon. Parramatta would go on to defeat Canterbury-Bankstown 26-12 and condemn them to their fifth spoon.

In 2009 on their fairy tale run to the grand final, Parramatta faced off against Canterbury in the preliminary final in front of a record crowd of 74,549. Billed as the &quot;Sydney Grand Final&quot;, Parramatta were down 12–6 at halftime but came back in the second half to win 22–12. Proving why their rivalry is one of the leagues most bitter.
In recent times Parramatta have dominated the fixture between the two clubs winning 12 of the last 15 meetings since 2015.

Speaking to the Herald Sun in 2007, former Canterbury-Bankstown player Craig Polla-Mounter described the rivalry between the two club&#x27;s saying &quot;I think the Parramatta and Canterbury fans can be the most unforgiving, especially when we play each other. I have no doubt it is the biggest rivalry in rugby league and part of the reason he didn&#x27;t play again&quot;. Polla-Mounter said this in reference to Parramatta player Paul Carige and his infamous performance in the 1998 preliminary final.

===Parramatta Eels–Penrith Panthers rivalry===

Another rivalry is with neighboring Western Sydney club the Penrith Panthers. The match between the two is known as the &quot;Western Sydney derby&quot; or &quot;The Battle of the West&quot;. Aside from local &#x27;bragging rights&#x27; the rivalry is also partly founded in bitterness associated with the former status of the Penrith district as part of the Parramatta rugby league district. The relationship between local Penrith clubs and the Parramatta District was often problematic; players and officials in the Penrith area considered themselves ignored and neglected by the Parramatta club during the 1950s and 1960s. Parramatta beat Penrith in two finals games in 1985 winning 38-6 and in 2000 when Parramatta won again 28–10. In 2021, Penrith beat Parramatta in a tight and bruising affair 8–6 on their way to winning the 2021 Grand Final.

In round 9 of the 2022 NRL season, Parramatta defeated Penrith 22–20 at Penrith Stadium. This ended Penrith&#x27;s eight match winning streak to start the season and it was also the first time Penrith had lost at the ground since the 2019 NRL season.
In round 20 of the same season, Parramatta defeated Penrith 34–10. Parramatta were the only team in the 2022 NRL season to beat Penrith twice. In the 2022 finals series, Penrith defeated Parramatta 27–8 in the qualifying final. The two clubs would then meet in the 2022 NRL Grand Final with Penrith securing back to back premierships defeating Parramatta 28–12. Following the grand final, some of the Penrith players mocked the Parramatta club in public and on social media with James Fisher-Harris saying that Parramatta were now Penrith&#x27;s sons followed by the player inviting Penrith supporters to chant &quot;We hate Parra&quot; and Jarome Luai posting on social media &quot;Daddy loves you&quot; which was in reference to Luai saying before the grand final that Penrith were now Parramatta&#x27;s &quot;Daddy&quot;.

In round 4 of the 2023 NRL season, Parramatta met Penrith in the grand final rematch. Parramatta went into the match having started the season winless. Parramatta lead the match 16–8 with less than seven minutes to play but Penrith levelled the game at 16-16 after Nathan Cleary kicked a 40-metre field goal with seconds remaining. In golden point extra-time, Mitchell Moses kicked a field goal to win the game for Parramatta 17–16.
In the final round of the 2023 NRL season, Parramatta upset Penrith 32–18 with Parramatta winger Maika Sivo scoring four tries.
In round 23 of the 2024 NRL season, Penrith staged one of the best comebacks in recent memory as they came from 16 points down to defeat Parramatta 36-34. Penrith scored three converted tries in six minutes to claim the victory.

===Parramatta Eels–St. George Illawarra Dragons rivalry===

The Eels did have a rivalry with another Sydney-based team, the St. George Illawarra Dragons. The Eels were the Dragons&#x27; first-ever opponents as a joint-venture and the match was also the second ever held at Stadium Australia which would be the venue for the Olympic Games the following year. The Eels won 20-10 but the Dragons later moved on to make the grand final. The rivalry was not based on geographic location or tribalism as it was more based on both teams being in the finals hunt and pursuit of the premiership. In recent years there were some memorable, not to mention controversial matches, including:
* Round 18, 2005: Dragons captain Trent Barrett and Eels hooker PJ Marsh instigated an all-in brawl as Barrett kicked down-field and Marsh attempted to smother his kick. Barrett took exception to the tackle and punched Marsh in the back of the head whilst Eels fullback Wade McKinnon fielded the kick and ran 80 metres to score. It turned out to be the turning point to the match as the Eels would go on to win 40–14.
* Round 13, 2006: After 70 minutes without a score, Parramatta kicked a field goal to go 1-0 up before 8 unanswered points by the Dragons got them home 8–1 in one of the weirdest matches ever in NRL history. This match was played in driving rain at WIN Jubilee Oval, Kogarah.
* Round 26, 2009: With the minor premiership seemingly all but lost, the Dragons thrashed the Eels 37–0 to actually finish on top of the NRL ladder from the Bulldogs who had lost 34–18 against the Wests Tigers in the second match played on the same night as the Dragons vs Eels match. The win by the Dragons ended Parramatta&#x27;s late season surge and it saw the Eels finish eighth.
* 4th Qualifying Final, 2009: But in the qualifying final nine days later, the Eels turned the tables on the Dragons and beat the premiership favourites 25–12, a 50-point turnaround. The Eels would then go on to make the grand final (which they ultimately lost to the disgraced Melbourne Storm) whilst the Dragons would exit the finals altogether after losing to the Brisbane Broncos 24–10.
* Round 13, 2011: After being thrashed 30–0 against the Dragons in a previous round the Eels began the match as underdogs. The Eels got out to a 14–0 lead only for it to be chased down by the Dragons. After 10 minutes of extra time and neither side being able to break the dead-lock, the game was declared a draw. However, Eels fullback Jarryd Hayne almost pulled off a miracle field goal from close to 60 metres out only for the kick to fade late and miss by half a metre.

===Parramatta Eels–Melbourne Storm rivalry===

Parramatta have also developed a rivalry with the Melbourne Storm. After Melbourne were found to have breached the salary cap from 2006 to 2010, Parramatta felt robbed of a premiership, having gone down to Melbourne in the 2009 NRL Grand Final and wanted a chance at redemption. In 2010, Parramatta got this chance.
* Round 13, 2010: After Melbourne were found to have breached the salary cap over the previous five years and robbed several teams of premiership glory including the Parramatta Eels, the Eels got their chance at redemption. In front of a loud and proud home crowd who let Melbourne know what they&#x27;d done, Parramatta beat Melbourne, who still had their illegal roster but could no longer accrue points, 24–10. The game was marred by two fights which erupted. The first started after Eels fullback Jarryd Hayne and Melbourne fullback Billy Slater came head to head after Hayne had worked Slater over in a tackle.

Hayne proceeded to head-butt Slater who responded with a punch and the 2 had to be separated. The second occurred again after Hayne and Slater came together. This time Slater was the aggressor and appeared to lead with an elbow when tackling Hayne. Parramatta Five-Eighth Daniel Mortimer was then put in the Sin-Bin for being the third man in. Parramatta fired-up after this incident with prop Fui Fui Moi Moi charging onto the ball from the ensuing penalty and gaining 20 metres. Parramatta kept their heads and won the game by a comfortable margin in the end.

As of 2024, Parramatta has never defeated Melbourne in a finals game having lost all seven encounters in the 1999 preliminary final, 2006 qualifying final, 2007 preliminary final, The 2009 NRL Grand Final, 2017 qualifying final, the 2019 elimination semi final and 2020 qualifying final.
Parramatta hold the record as the side who have scored the most points against Melbourne in a single match when they defeated them 54-10 during the 2001 NRL season.
In round 24 of the 2021 NRL season, Parramatta defeated Melbourne 22-10 which ended their record equalling 19-game winning streak. Melbourne were only one win from setting an all-time winning streak of 20 victories in a row. Parramatta were the only team to defeat Minor Premiers, Melbourne twice during the 2021 NRL regular season.
In round 25 of the 2022 NRL season, Parramatta defeated Melbourne 22–14 to leapfrog them into fourth place on the table. The result meant that Melbourne finished in fifth place, their lowest finish since the 2014 NRL season.

In round 1 of the 2023 NRL season, Parramatta faced Melbourne in a tightly contested season opener that ended with Melbourne&#x27;s hooker, Harry Grant, scoring a try in the first period of golden point to win the match 16–12.
In round 22 of the 2023 NRL season, Melbourne conducted their 25th anniversary celebrations against Parramatta at Docklands Stadium with a promotional poster before the game showing the club had won six premierships including the 2009 premiership even though the NRL had stripped the club of both premierships due to deliberate salary cap breaches between 2006 and 2010. Melbourne would go on to win the game 46–16.
On 31 July 2023, former Melbourne player Cameron Smith spoke to the media regarding the celebrations of the stripped premierships stating that people wouldn&#x27;t understand why the Melbourne club celebrate the stripped premierships and that opposition fans in particular Parramatta supporters had the right to feel annoyed but said the celebration was for all the right reasons.

<text>Jürgen Todenhöfer (born 12 November 1940) is a German author, journalist, politician, and executive.

==Early life and education==
Todenhöfer was born in Offenburg in what is now the current German state of Baden-Württemberg, and studied law at the universities of Munich, Paris, Bonn and Freiburg. He graduated as a doctor of law in 1969 and worked as a judge from 1972 on.

==Politics==
Todenhöfer became a member of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) in 1970 which he left on 12 November 2020, his 80th birthday, to found a new political party and was a member of the Bundestag from 13 December 1972 to 20 December 1990 (five election periods) where he represented Tübingen and was affiliated with the pejoratively named &quot;Stahlhelm-Fraktion.&quot; He also acted as party spokesman for development policy and arms control. He was vice chairman of the executive board of German media company Hubert Burda Media until 2008.
He is considered to be a pacifist although he pointed out that he is not. He participates in the Bundestag election 2021 with his own party, Team Todenhöfer.

He is a Christian.

==Journalism==
In 1980 he visited Soviet-occupied Afghanistan and started to raise money for refugees. Todenhöfer is one of the most prominent German critics of the US-led wars against Afghanistan and against Iraq in 2001 and 2003, respectively.

He claims that during the war in Iraq the Bush administration was deceiving the public and that the US war in Iraq has killed several hundred thousand Iraqi civilians. He has visited Iraq several times and did original research for his book &quot;Why do you kill, Zaid?&quot;

Following the International Criminal Court&#x27;s arrest warrant against the Sudanese dictator Omar al-Bashir, he sent an open letter to the Prosecutor General of the ICC, Luis Moreno-Ocampo. He asked for the reasons which led the prosecutor to indict the Sudanese dictator but not the US president George W. Bush or the British prime minister Tony Blair, seeing that neither Sudan nor the US have recognized the International Criminal Court.
===First western journalist to visit ISIS===

In the summer of 2014 Todenhӧfer sent a message on Facebook to more than 80 German ISIS soldiers asking whether he could visit the ISIS fighting cadre. His goal was to understand the motivations of ISIS. On 9 September, Abu Qatadah, a 31-year-old German and an important person in ISIS media, answered the message. They had Skype discussions for several months. Finally, Todenhӧfer received a document guaranteeing his safety. In October 2014, Todenhӧfer was the first western journalist to travel to ISIS-controlled territory. He was accompanied by his filmmaker son, Frederic.

Todenhöfer wrote that he stayed with an ISIS soldier who was armed with a Kalashnikov rifle. The soldier told him that he was sure to return home alive because ISIS wanted to be accepted as a state, so he had the guarantee of safety from their leadership. In other words, violation of the guarantee would mean violation of this state. Todenhӧfer spent most of his time in Mosul, Iraq but he could have visited ISIS-controlled cities in Syria such as Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor.

===Interview with al Nusra commander===
In 2016 Todenhöfer filmed an interview with an alleged Syrian rebel commander near Aleppo. The commander, said to be with the al-Qaeda affiliated group the Al-Nusra Front (later Jabhat Fateh al-Sham), claimed to have American support and said his group opposed humanitarian aid to civilians. Whether the commander was truly a Nusra fighter was later questioned and the authenticity of the video disputed. Todenhöfer did not respond to questions about his interview.

== Controversies ==

=== &quot;Inside IS&quot; book ===
In 2016 the German newspaper &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; analyzed Todenhöfer&#x27;s book &quot;Inside IS&quot;, in which he reports allegedly visiting the Islamic State and speaking to several of its members. &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;&#x27;s article contained many strong accusations, disputing most of Todenhöfer&#x27;s claims. The article concluded Todenhöfer&#x27;s work was more a &quot;fictional novel than a factual documentary&quot;, and calling Todenhöfer a &quot;Märchenonkel&quot; (lying pope). Todenhöfer subsequently sued &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;.

=== Cooperation with Xavier Naidoo ===
In 2015 Todenhöfer recorded a song with the German songwriter Xavier Naidoo, who drifted far into the right spectrum. The song was a protest against the German support of the military intervention in Syria. In it, Muslims are called the &quot;new Jews bearing the responsibility of the star of David&quot;. In general opinion Naidoo&#x27;s and Todenhöfer&#x27;s song was widely criticized, citing their blunt antisemitism and relationship to Syria&#x27;s dictator Assad. In fact, Todenhöfer has been found in close contact to Assad and his daughter, calling her &quot;my little princess&quot;.

<text>Daniël Hartman Craven (11 October 1910 – 4 January 1993) was a South African rugby union player (1931–1938), national coach, national and international rugby administrator, academic, and author. Popularly known as Danie, Doc, or Mr Rugby, Craven&#x27;s appointment from 1949 to 1956 as coach of the Springboks signalled &quot;one of the most successful spells in South African rugby history&quot; during which the national team won 74% of their matches. While as a player Craven is mostly remembered as one of rugby&#x27;s greatest dive-passing scrumhalves ever, he had also on occasion been selected to play for the Springboks as a centre, fly-half, No.8, and full-back. As the longest-serving President of the South African Rugby Board (1956–93) and chairman of the International Rugby Board (1962, 1973, 1979), Craven became one of the best-known and most controversial rugby administrators. In 1969, Craven sparked outrage among anti-apartheid activists when he allegedly said, &quot;There will be a black springbok over my dead body&quot;. Craven denied saying this and in his later career promoted black and coloured training facilities.

Craven earned doctorates in ethnology (1935), psychology (1973) and physical education (1978). He not only created the physical training division of the South African Defence Force (1941) but became the first professor of physical education at Stellenbosch University (1949).

== Early life and school years==
Danie Craven was born on 11 October 1911 to James Roos Craven (b. 28 June 1882) and Maria Susanna Hartman (d. 1958) on Steeton Farm near Lindley, a small town on the Vals River in eastern Free State province of South Africa. Craven was the third of seven children. The family farm was named for Steeton in West Yorkshire, home to Craven&#x27;s paternal grandfather, John Craven (1837–90), who came to South Africa as a diamond prospector. Craven later also named his home in Stellenbosch Steeton. His father, aged 18, fought against the British during the Anglo-Boer War and was interned in a British concentration camp, a fate that reportedly also befell his mother.

As a young boy Craven played barefoot soccer, and received his first lessons at a farm school. At the age of 13 he was sent to Lindley High School, and started playing rugby with a stone in the dusty town streets. At school he shone at cricket and rugby. In the following year Craven was selected to play for the town&#x27;s adult team, but his principal, Tivoli van Huyssteen, prevented him from playing until he turned 15. Among his Lindley teammates was Lappies Hattingh, who would play with Craven 8 years later in the Springbok team against the Wallabies.

== Education and teaching career==
In 1929 Craven enrolled at Stellenbosch University in the Western Cape. He initially registered as a theology student, but later switched to Social Sciences and Social Anthropology. The switch was prompted by medical advice after his vocal chords were damaged by a kick to the throat while he tried to stop charging forwards during the 1932 test against Scotland.

Craven lodged in Wilgenhof Men&#x27;s Residence, following in the footsteps of his maternal grandfather, George Nathaniel Hayward (1886–1977). In 1903 Hayward had been one of Wilgenhof&#x27;s first residents. An all-round athlete, Craven represented his university in rugby, swimming (captain), water polo and baseball. He also participated in track and field, and played cricket, tennis, and soccer.

Craven obtained his BA (1932) as well as a MA (1933) and PhD (1935) in ethnology at Stellenbosch. His PhD dissertation was titled &quot;Ethnological Classification of the South African Bantu&quot;. His third doctorate was for his thesis on &quot;Evolution of Modern Games&quot;. He was appointed as Stellenbosch&#x27;s first professor of physical education in 1949, and served in that capacity until 1975.

After completing his education at Stellenbosch, Craven started teaching at St. Andrew&#x27;s College in Grahamstown, Eastern Cape, in 1936. He coached the school&#x27;s rugby side, and while there he was selected for the 1937 Springbok tour.

Craven joined the Union Defence Force in 1938 as director of physical education and was sent to Europe to study physical education in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, France, and Britain. The imminent outbreak of war forced the Cravens to return to South Africa. Craven was appointed head of physical education at the South African military academy with the rank of major. When his section was established as a separate Physical Training Brigade in 1947, Craven was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and director of the brigade. His military career was momentarily interrupted in 1947 as he was appointed lecturer in the Union Education Department at Stellenbosch University before returning to the brigade.

Due to his fame as a Springbok, Craven&#x27;s image was used in Afrikaans language newspapers during the Second World War to encourage men to enlist. The advertisement showed Craven in uniform, looking into the distance and announcing, &quot;I am playing in the biggest Springbok team ever; join me and score the most important try of your life.&quot;

==Rugby playing career==
At university Craven found a mentor in Stellenbosch coach and national selector A.F. (&quot;Oubaas Mark&quot;) Markötter, in charge of the university team from 1903 to 1957. Markötter noticed Craven from the time he starting playing as a 19-year-old in 1929, and promoted him to the first team the following year.

=== Provincial career ===
Craven was selected as a Springbok in 1931 before he had made his provincial debut for Western Province in 1932. In a match against Free State in Bloemfontein that year he scored a hat-trick of tries in a performance regarded as one of his best.

In 1936 he worked in Grahamstown, and so started playing for Eastern Province, alongside Flappie Lochner. At Craven&#x27;s suggestion, Markötter ensured that Lochner went on the 1937 tour to New Zealand.

=== International career ===
Craven played his first test match on 5 December 1931 as scrum half at the age of 21 against at St Helens, Swansea. His flyhalf was the captain, Bennie Osler. One of the other debutants that day was flanker André McDonald, who would later develop into the first specialist No. 8. Craven and McDonald became fast friends. His performance on a water-logged field led &quot;Die Burger&quot; to exult &quot;Boy plays like a giant&quot;.

In his third test, against Scotland at Murrayfield on 16 January 1932, Craven scored the winning try. The opportunity came because Craven implemented advice that he had received at Stellenbosch from coach Markötter. Markötter had said that on a muddy field a scrumhalf should either play with his forwards or kick, Craven recalled later. His advice enabled Craven to choose between captain Osler, who wanted the ball to be passed to him, and leader of the forwards Boy Louw, who demanded that the ball stay with the forwards. During the match he was knocked unconscious, sustained damage to his vocal chords, and lost a tooth.

Craven&#x27;s last test match was on 10 September 1938 as captain (also as scrum half) at the age of 27 against the British Lions at Newlands, Cape Town. During the 1930s he was one of the world&#x27;s leading scrumhalves, but the start of the Second World War in 1939 ended his career prematurely.

=== Test history ===
==Rugby coaching and administration==

===Coaching career===
After his rugby-playing career ended, he was a national selector from 1938 until he was appointed coach in 1949. He started his coaching career with a bang, winning 10 matches in a row, including a 4–0 whitewash of New Zealand in their 1949 tour to South Africa. Under his guidance the Springboks were undefeated from 1949 to 1952, and won 17 of 23 tests (74% success rate) – an achievement that makes Craven one of South Africa&#x27;s greatest coaches. He also coached Stellenbosch University from 1949 until 1956.

=== Administrative career ===
Craven became the president of the South African Rugby Board (SARB) in 1956. He was also a member of the International Rugby Board from 1957 and served as its chairman on several occasions.

The last part of Craven&#x27;s chairmanship of the SARB occurred during the country&#x27;s most tumultuous years. Rugby had become the national sport of white South Africans and a symbol of Afrikaner power. In the 1970s and 1980s, the outlawed African National Congress allied with overseas anti-apartheid movements to successfully isolate South Africa from sporting and cultural contact with the rest of the world. Of all the sanctions aimed at South Africa, none irked the Afrikaner population more than the ban on rugby internationals.

Craven managed to maintain links with other rugby playing nations during the years of South Africa&#x27;s sporting isolation through his position with the IRB. He feared that isolation would negatively affect the standard of Springbok rugby. Consequently, he was not above &quot;some murky business&quot;, such as the New Zealand Cavaliers tour in 1986, which Craven denied would happen. By the time South Africa returned to international competition in 1992, there had been no outgoing tours since 1981, and no incoming tours since 1984.

In 1988 Craven met leaders of the African National Congress (ANC) in Harare, Zimbabwe in a bold bid to return to global competition. An unprecedented deal emerged to form a single rugby association that would field integrated teams for participation in foreign tournaments. Many right-wing white South Africans attacked Craven as a traitor for meeting with the ANC, and then-president P.W. Botha denounced the move. Although the deal did not lead to the immediate end of the sporting isolation, it paved the way for the formation of the unified body, the South African Rugby Football Union (SARFU) in 1992. Craven was SARFU&#x27;s first chairman until he died in 1993, having served for an unbroken 37 years at the head of South African rugby.

==Personal life==
Craven married twice. He wed Beyera Johanna (née Hayward, d. 2007) on 2 July 1938. She was from the Eastern Cape, a teacher, and daughter of the member of parliament for Steytlerville, George Hayward. Danie and Beyera had four children: Joan, George Hayward, Daniel, and James Roos Craven. One of his grandsons is the professional Namibian road cyclist Dan Craven, winner of the 2008 African Road Race Championships in Casablanca, Morocco. Danie and Beyera divorced in 1972.

On 30 May 1975 Craven married Martha Jacoba (Merlė) Vermeulen, the widow of Cape Town detective Dirk Vermeulen. Merlė worked in the fashion industry as a buyer for a chain of stores, and so had to attend fashion parades. After one such a parade in Pretoria, she twisted her ankle badly at her hotel. A bystander introduced her to Craven as &quot;a doctor&quot; who &quot;knew a lot about ankle injuries&quot;. After Craven treated her foot, he telephoned and arranged to meet her again, and their relationship developed.

Craven had a dog named Bliksem which accompanied him everywhere, even to rugby practices. A journalist recalled how &quot;when Doc and Bliksem were on the touchline at training, no one within sight would dare shirk&quot;.

== Legacy ==
There were &quot;many contradictions and convolutions in Craven&#x27;s life&quot;, wrote Paul Dobson, which made him both admired and despised:
=== Honours ===
Danie Craven was accepted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame in 1997, the first of 9 South Africans to date. In 2007 he became the third inductee into the IRB Hall of Fame, only preceded by Rugby School and William Webb Ellis, the alleged instigator of the game that would develop into rugby union.

The South African Craven Week schools rugby competition is named after him, as well as the Danie Craven Stadium and Danie Craven Rugby Museum in Stellenbosch. To commemorate him, Stellenbosch University commissioned sculptor Pierre Volschenk to execute a bronze sculpture of Craven and his faithful dog. The statue stands within the grounds of the Coertzenburg sports complex in Stellenbosch.

In 1981 Craven received the State President&#x27;s Award for Exceptional Service, as well as the honorary citizenship of the city of Stellenbosch. He was made an honorary life president of the French Rugby Federation in 1992.

=== Aphorisms ===
Craven is often remembered for his quirky and controversial statements. For example, he said &quot;When Maties and Western Province rugby are strong, then Springbok rugby is strong.&quot;

Initially he was unsure that all South Africans could play together, arguing in 1968 that the different race groups were &quot;separate nations ... [who] won&#x27;t ever play in the same side. But maybe ... one day, we would have such a team&quot;. Craven denied that he had ever said that people of colour would be Springboks &quot;over my dead body&quot;. His supporters could point to his liking for coloured rugby enthusiasts, and the efforts that he made over the last few years of his life to run multiracial rugby workshops in rural South Africa as signs that he had changed his views.

=== Published works ===
Apart from his academic dissertations which were referred to above, Craven wrote numerous books as solo and co-author on rugby, including his autobiography (1949), rugby terms for translators (1972), and how to organize a tennis club (1951). According to &quot;The Independent&quot; of London &quot;his coaching manual &quot;Rugby Handbook&quot; (1970) is a standard&quot;.

<doc id="869072" wikidata="Q900734" url="?curid=869072" title="Monogenetic volcanic field">
<text>A monogenetic volcanic field is a type of volcanic field consisting of a group of small monogenetic volcanoes, each of which erupts only once, as opposed to polygenetic volcanoes, which erupt repeatedly over a period of time. The small monogenetic volcanoes of these fields are the most common subaerial volcanic landform.

Many monogenetic volcanoes are cinder cones, often with lava flows, such as Parícutin in the Michoacán-Guanajuato volcanic field, which erupted from 1943 to 1952. Some monogenetic volcanoes are small lava shields, such as Rangitoto Island in the Auckland volcanic field. Other monogenetic volcanoes are tuff rings or maars. A monogenetic field typically contains between ten and a hundred volcanoes. The Michoacán-Guanajuato field in Mexico contains more than a thousand volcanoes and is exceptionally large.

Monogenetic fields occur only where the magma supply to the volcano is low or where vents are not close enough or large enough to develop plumbing systems for continuous feeding of magma. Monogenetic volcanic fields can provide snapshots of the underlying region beneath the surface, and may be useful in studying the generation of magma and the composition of the mantle since the single eruption produced would match that of the chamber from which it erupted. The magma supplying such fields is thought to have rapidly ascended from its source region, with only short resident times (decades or less) in shallow magma chambers.

==Examples==

*Auckland volcanic field, underlying much of the city of Auckland, New Zealand
*Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field, east-central British Columbia, Canada
*Honolulu Volcanic Series, Hawaii, United States
*Boring Lava Field, in and near Portland, Oregon, United States
*Michoacán-Guanajuato volcanic field (includes El Jorullo and Parícutin), Michoacán, Mexico
*Vulkan Eifel, Germany
*Chaîne des Puys, France
*La Garrotxa Volcanic Field (also known as the Olot Volcanic Field), Spain
*Carrán-Los Venados, Chile
*North and north-eastern area of Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, Spain
*Southern Volcanic Zone of Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain
* Newer Volcanics Province, southeastern Australia
* Kachchh volcanic plugs, Gujarat, India
* Maahunui Volcanic System, Canterbury Basin, New Zealand
* Cat Hills volcanic field in New Mexico, United States
* Cumbre Vieja ridge, La Palma, Canary Islands, Spain

<doc id="869074" wikidata="Q578918" url="?curid=869074" title="Alberto Calderón">
<text>Alberto Pedro Calderón (September 14, 1920 – April 16, 1998) was an Argentine mathematician. His name is associated with the University of Buenos Aires, but first and foremost with the University of Chicago, where Calderón and his mentor, the analyst Antoni Zygmund, developed the theory of singular integral operators. This created the &quot;Chicago School of (hard) Analysis&quot; (sometimes simply known as the &quot;Calderón-Zygmund School&quot;).

Calderón&#x27;s work ranged over a wide variety of topics: from singular integral operators to partial differential equations, from interpolation theory to Cauchy integrals on Lipschitz curves, from ergodic theory to inverse problems in electrical prospection. Calderón&#x27;s work has also had a powerful impact on practical applications including signal processing, geophysics, and tomography.

==Early life and education==
Alberto Pedro Calderón was born on September 14, 1920, in Mendoza, Argentina, to Don Pedro Calderón, a physician (urologist), and Haydée. He had several siblings, including a younger brother, Calixto Pedro Calderón, also a mathematician. His father encouraged his mathematical studies. After his mother&#x27;s unexpected death when he was twelve, he spent two years at the Montana Knabeninstitut, a boys&#x27; boarding school near Zürich in Switzerland, where he was mentored by Save Bercovici, who interested him in mathematics. He then completed his high school studies in Mendoza.

Persuaded by his father that he could not make a living as a mathematician, he entered the University of Buenos Aires, where he studied engineering. After graduating in civil engineering in 1947, he got a job in the research laboratory of the geophysical division of the state-owned oil company, the YPF (Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales).

==Research==
While still working at YPF, Calderón became acquainted with the mathematicians at the University of Buenos Aires: Julio Rey Pastor, the first professor in the Institute of Mathematics, his assistant Alberto González Domínguez (who became his mentor and friend), Luis Santaló and Manuel Balanzat. At the YPF Lab Calderón studied the possibility of determining the conductivity of a body by making electrical measurements at the boundary; he did not publish his results until 1980, in his short Brazilian paper. see also On an inverse boundary value problem and the Commentary by Gunther Uhlmann. It pioneered a new area of mathematical research in inverse problems.

Calderón then took up a post at the University of Buenos Aires. Antoni Zygmund of the University of Chicago, arrived there in 1948 at the invitation of Alberto González Domínguez and Calderón was assigned as his assistant. Zygmund invited Calderón to work with him, and in 1949 Calderón arrived in Chicago with a Rockefeller Fellowship. He was encouraged by Marshall Stone to obtain a doctorate, and with three recently published papers as dissertation, Calderón obtained his PhD in mathematics under Zygmund&#x27;s supervision in 1950.

The collaboration reached fruition in the Calderón-Zygmund theory of singular integrals, and lasted more than three decades. The memoir of 1952 was influential for the Chicago School of hard analysis. The Calderón-Zygmund decomposition lemma, invented to prove the weak-type continuity of singular integrals of integrable functions, became a standard tool in analysis and probability theory. The Calderón-Zygmund Seminar at the University of Chicago ran for decades.

Calderón contributed to the theory of differential equations, with his proof of uniqueness in the Cauchy problem using algebras of singular integral operators, his reduction of elliptic boundary value problems to singular integral equations on the boundary (the &quot;method of the Calderón projector&quot;), and the role played by algebras of singular integrals, through the work of Calderón&#x27;s student R. Seeley, in the initial proof of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, see also the Commentary by Paul Malliavin. The development of pseudo-differential operators by Kohn-Nirenberg and Hörmander also owed much to Calderón and his collaborators, R. Vaillancourt and J. Alvarez-Alonso.

Also, Calderón insisted that the focus should be on algebras of singular integral operators with non-smooth kernels to solve actual problems arising in physics and engineering, where lack of smoothness is a natural feature. It led to what is now known as the &quot;Calderón program&quot;, with major parts: Calderón&#x27;s study of the Cauchy integral on Lipschitz curves, and his proof of the &quot;boundedness of the &quot;first commutator&quot;&quot;. These papers stimulated research by other mathematicians in the following decades; see also the later paper by the Calderón brothers and the Commentary by Y. Meyer.

Work by Calderón in interpolation theory opened up a new area of research, see also the Commentary by Charles Fefferman and Elias M. Stein, and in ergodic theory, his basic paper (see also the Commentary by Donald L. Burkholder, and) formulated a transference principle that reduced the proof of maximal inequalities for abstract dynamical systems to the case of the dynamical system on the integers, on the reals or, more generally, on the acting group.

==Career==
In his academic career, Calderón taught at many different universities, but primarily at the University of Chicago and the University of Buenos Aires. Calderón together with his mentor and collaborator Zygmund, maintained close ties with Argentina and Spain, and through their doctoral students and their visits, strongly influenced the development of mathematics in these countries.

<doc id="869076" wikidata="Q2426357" url="?curid=869076" title="Natalie Appleton">
<text>Natalie Jane Appleton Howlett (born 14 May 1973) is a Canadian singer. She is a member of the British girl group All Saints and the duo Appleton with her younger sister Nicole Appleton.

Appleton joined All Saints in 1996, becoming the fourth and final member of the group, but five years later they split up amid group in-fighting. She went on to form a duo with her younger sister Nicole under the name Appleton. Since then, she has reunited to release three more albums with All Saints, in 2006, 2016 and 2018.

== Career ==
In 1983, Appleton moved to London and attended the Sylvia Young Theatre School. She had a brief cameo in an episode of &quot;Grange Hill&quot; in 1986.

=== 1996–2001: All Saints ===
Appleton&#x27;s father met Melanie Blatt, with whom Nicole had attended the Sylvia Young Theatre School, and heard that Blatt was looking for new members for her girl group. Nicole asked whether her sister could join the group as well. In 1996 both sisters joined Blatt and Shaznay Lewis, forming All Saints. In 2000, Natalie and Nicole appeared in the poorly received film &quot;Honest&quot;. All Saints split acrimoniously in 2001 amid much foment and rumour. In their five-year career, the group scored a total of five number-one singles.

=== 2002–2005: Appleton and television ===
Natalie and Nicole formed the duo Appleton and launched their first single &quot;Fantasy&quot; in September 2002 which features Natalie doing a stage dive. Initially, it was to be Nicole doing the stage dive, but she backed out at the last minute, and thus Natalie took her place. The album &quot;Everything&#x27;s Eventual&quot; was released in early 2003 and coincided with the documentary &quot;Appleton on Appleton&quot; which gave an inside look into the life of the sisters. In November 2004, Appleton was a contestant on the fourth series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. While on the show the public voted for her numerous times to take part in bushtucker trials, she was not very successful in completing the challenges and left after the public voted for her to do what would have been a record fifth bushtucker trial.

=== 2006–present: All Saints return===
From 2006 to 2008 All Saints reunited and released their third studio album titled &quot;Studio 1&quot; on 13 November 2006. However, the group subsequently split again in 2009.

In 2014, All Saints reformed to support the Backstreet Boys for five dates across the UK and Ireland. On 27 January 2016, it was confirmed that All Saints were scheduled to release their fourth studio album &quot;Red Flag&quot; on 8 April 2016. The lead single from the album, &quot;One Strike&quot;, preceded the album on 26 February 2016.

In 2023, Appleton competed on the fourth series of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Fawn&quot; and finished in third place.

== Early and personal life ==
Nicole and Natalie have two older sisters, Lori and Lee. Natalie was born in Mississauga, Ontario, to Jewish parents Mary and Kenneth Appleton. While growing up she lived in Toronto, New York City, and London.

She attended high school in Ellenville, New York, and eventually left to sing at a Borscht Belt country club at age 15. In 1990, she moved back to Camden, London, where she met Carl Robinson (born c. 1967), a stripper with the Dreamboys whom she met when seeing them perform on a night out in London when she was 17. On 19 May 1992, their daughter Rachel Appleton (now Rachel Howlett) was born. She and Robinson moved to New York where they married in 1993, before Appleton returned to the United Kingdom after having the marriage annulled.

She had relationships with television presenter Jamie Theakston and actor Jonny Lee Miller during the late 1990s.

Appleton began dating Liam Howlett of the electronic band the Prodigy in 2000, after they met at V Festival. They married on 7 June 2002 in a ceremony in France. In addition to Appleton&#x27;s daughter from her first marriage, the couple have a son, Ace Billy Howlett, born 2 March 2004. As of 2014, the family lived in the Hampstead area of London.

<text>Nicole Marie Appleton (born 7 December 1974) is a Canadian singer and television presenter. She is a member of the British girl group All Saints and the pop duo Appleton with her elder sister Natalie Appleton.

== Early life ==
Appleton was born in Hamilton, Ontario, to Jewish parents Mary and Kenneth Appleton. She is the youngest of four daughters. She has three older sisters; Lori, Lee, and Natalie. While growing up she lived in Toronto, New York City, and London.

== Career ==
=== 1996–2001: Career with All Saints ===

In 1996 Appleton and her sister Natalie Appleton became the third and fourth members of the group &quot;All Saints&quot;, formed by Melanie Blatt and Shaznay Lewis. All Saints released their debut single &quot;I Know Where It&#x27;s At&quot; in 1997 via London Records and reached number four on the UK Singles Chart. Their second single Never Ever was released in November 1997, and introduced the group to international success, reaching the top ten in several countries as well as peaking at number one in the United Kingdom and Australia. It sold over 1.2 million copies in the UK and was eventually certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. In 1998 the group won two BRIT Awards for &quot;Best British Single&quot; and &quot;Best British Video&quot;, both for Never Ever. They released their debut album &quot;All Saints&quot; in November 1997, it reached number two in the UK and was certified five-times platinum by the BPI for sales of 1.5 million. The third single from the album was the double A-side &quot;Under the Bridge / Lady Marmalade&quot;, which became their second UK number-one single. &quot;Bootie Call&quot;, the fourth single, also went to number one, and the silver-certified &quot;War of Nerves&quot;, the fifth and final release, peaked at number seven. The album achieved success in countries such as Australia, Canada and the United States, where &quot;All Saints&quot; was certified platinum by the RIAA for sales of one million and produced two top forty singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100: &quot;I Know Where It&#x27;s At&quot; and &quot;Never Ever&quot;.

In February 2000 they released the single &quot;Pure Shores&quot; for the soundtrack of the film &quot;The Beach&quot; (starring Leonardo DiCaprio). &quot;Pure Shores&quot; was their fourth number-one single in the UK and the second best-selling single of 2000, with 600,000 copies sold; it also became their first and only number-one single in Ireland and was a substantial hit across Europe and Australia. In October 2000, All Saints released the single &quot;Black Coffee&quot;, which became their fifth and final number-one single in the UK, selling 200,000 copies. Also in 2000, Nicole and her sister both appeared in the film &quot;Honest&quot;. This preceded their second studio album, &quot;Saints &amp; Sinners&quot;, which debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, eventually reaching double-platinum certification in the UK for sales of 600,000 copies. The second and final single was &quot;All Hooked Up&quot; in January 2001, which peaked at number seven. In February 2001, All Saints announced that they were to take a break so that they &quot;could clear the air between themselves&quot;. In November 2001, London Records released a greatest hits compilation entitled &quot;All Hits&quot;.

=== 2002–2005: Career with Appleton ===
In September 2002, Nicole and her sister Natalie launched themselves back onto the music scene, with their first single, &quot;Fantasy&quot;, written with Andy Hayman and Gareth Young, reaching No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart. Their autobiography, &quot;Together&quot;, came out in October 2002. In 2003, they had two more hits with &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry&quot; and &quot;Everything Eventually&quot;, and success with their album, &quot;Everything&#x27;s Eventual&quot;, which went gold in the UK after just two months. They decided to sign a deal with Concept Music in late 2004 because of differences with their previous label, Polydor.

=== 2006–present: All Saints reunion and television ===
On 24 January 2006, it was announced that the group had reformed and signed a record deal with Parlophone. They subsequently began work on their third studio album, &quot;Studio 1&quot;. The first single, &quot;Rock Steady&quot; (released in November 2006), reached number three on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Studio 1&quot; entered the albums chart at number forty and sold 60,000 copies according to the BPI, being certified silver. From 2007 to 2010 Nicole has been a host of the TV show &quot;The Hot Desk&quot;. She is also the host of &quot;Cover Me Canada&quot;, a Canadian reality singing competition that debuted on CBC Television in 2011.

In 2014, All Saints reformed to support the Backstreet Boys for five dates across the UK and Ireland in 2014. On 27 January 2016, it was confirmed that All Saints will release their fourth studio album, &quot;Red Flag&quot;, on 8 April 2016. The lead single from the album, &quot;One Strike&quot;, preceded the album on 28 February 2016.

== Personal life ==
On 7 December 1997, Appleton met Robbie Williams while filming &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. A relationship began, and they were subsequently engaged. In an autobiography she co-authored with her sister Natalie, Appleton later revealed that she terminated the pregnancy of her and Williams&#x27; baby after pressure from her record company. Their relationship ended in January 1999.

In 2000, Appleton started a relationship with Liam Gallagher, the frontman of the group Oasis. She gave birth to their son, Gene Gallagher, on 2 July 2001. Gallagher recorded the song &quot;Songbird&quot; as a token of his love for Appleton. The couple married at Marylebone Town Hall in London on the morning of 14 February 2008.

In April 2014, the couple divorced after the media revealed Liam Gallagher was expecting a child with journalist and &quot;The New York Times&quot; freelancer Liza Ghorbani.

In March 2020, Appleton announced she had given birth to a daughter named Skipper with her boyfriend Stephen Haines. Appleton and Haines married in October 2021.

<doc id="869081" wikidata="Q7418311" url="?curid=869081" title="Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company">
<text>The Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company is the trading name of two sister food companies (Australian Health and Nutrition Association Ltd and New Zealand Health Association Ltd). Both are wholly owned by the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

Founded in Melbourne, Victoria, in 1898, Sanitarium has factories in Australia and New Zealand, producing a large range of breakfast cereals and vegetarian products. All the food products it manufactures and markets are plant derived or vegetarian. Its flagship product is Weet-Bix sold in Australia and New Zealand.

==History==

During his time in Australia, William C. White convinced Seventh-day Adventist Edward Halsey, a baker at John Harvey Kellogg&#x27;s Battle Creek Sanitarium, to emigrate to Australia.

Halsey arrived in Sydney, New South Wales, on 8 November 1897. He rented a small bakery in Melbourne, and produced granola (made of wheat, oats, maize, and rye) and Granose (the unsweetened forerunner to Weet-Bix). Halsey and his team sold it from door to door as an alternative to the fat-laden and nutrient-poor foods popular at the time.

The business relocated to larger premises in Cooranbong, New South Wales, next to the campus of the seminary which became Avondale University College.

In 1900, Halsey transferred to New Zealand, where he began making the first batches of Granola, New Zealand&#x27;s first breakfast cereal, Caramel Cereals (a coffee substitute), and wholemeal bread in a small wooden shed in the Christchurch suburb of Papanui.

Sanitarium New Zealand and Sanitarium Australia are now separate companies, but work together.

Sanitarium has factories in several locations, including Berkeley Vale in New South Wales; Carmel in Perth, Western Australia; Brisbane, Queensland; and Auckland, New Zealand. Weet-Bix was originally manufactured, from 1928, at 659 Parramatta Road, Leichhardt, where until recent times Sanitarium signage could still be seen. This factory predates the purchase of Weet-Bix by Sanitarium in 1930. Another factory was constructed for Sanitarium in Warburton, Victoria in 1925 to manufacture Granose. This factory was damaged by floods in 1934 and a new factory constructed and operational by 1938, producing Granose and later Weet-Bix until 1997. This factory was unusual because it had an on-site hydro-electricity plant which also supplied the township of Warburton. A factory was operating in Palmerston North in New Zealand, but closed in the late 1990s. The Hackney factory in Adelaide, South Australia was closed in October 2010, followed by the Cooranbong factory in 2018.

In June 2017, Sanitarium caused controversy when it objected to a specialty shop-owner based in Christchurch, New Zealand, trying to import 300 boxes of Weetabix into the country. New Zealand Customs detained the boxes at the request of Sanitarium on the grounds the British-made Weetabix competed with and confused the branding of their own New Zealand-made &#x27;Weet-bix&#x27;. Sanitarium faced a backlash in New Zealand as a result. After failing to come to a settlement, Sanitarium filed civil action against the shop owner. The case hearing began in the High Court at Christchurch on 30 July 2018.

==Tax exemption==
Neither the Australia nor the New Zealand Sanitarium companies pay company tax on their profits, due to their ownership by a religious organisation. On their official website, Sanitarium defend their tax exemption with several points, stating they operate exclusively for charitable purposes, and that income tax exemptions are available to all companies and individuals in New Zealand who limit themselves to charitable purposes. However, the exemption has been criticised and is considered unfair by their competitors.

According to their last annual return as of February 2019, businesses operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church reported more than $10 million profit.

==Products==
===Honey Puffs===

Honey Puffs is a wheat breakfast cereal coated with honey made in Australia and New Zealand.

===Marmite===
Marmite is a food spread made in New Zealand. It is made from yeast extract, by-product of beer brewing.

===So Good (soy beverage)===
So Good (also known as SoGood or So-Good) is a brand of non-dairy beverages, foods, and desserts that are lactose, cholesterol and gluten-free. So Good is manufactured by Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company in Australia and New Zealand. In Canada, it was prepared by Earth&#x27;s Own. So Good is sold in India by Life Health Foods.

In Australia, So Good produces soy milk, as well as almond milk and almond and coconut milk. They also produce flavoured soy milk and frozen soy desserts.

In India, So Good produces almond milk and almond and coconut milk, in addition to soy milk. They also produce flavoured soy milk, flavoured almond milk, and fortified soy milk.

===Up &amp; Go===
Up &amp; Go is the brand of a range of liquid breakfast products manufactured and marketed by Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company. The brand was the first product that established the category of liquid breakfast in supermarket and convenience stores in Australia and New Zealand. Many other brands have entered the category since the late 1990s, and forced the brand to defend its market share.

In June 2013, &quot;Choice&quot; magazine released a study of 23 liquid breakfast products questioning the validity of claims that were made by manufacturers including Up &amp; Go claims regarding fibre content. Sanitarium defended Up &amp; Go in a release citing the current code of practice for nutrient claims that a product must contain a minimum of 3 g of dietary fibre per serving to be considered &quot;high in fiber&quot; and Up &amp; Go contained 3.8 g of fibre per 250-ml serving.

===Weet-Bix===

Weet-Bix is a wheat breakfast cereal made in Australia and New Zealand and in South Africa by Bokomo.

<text>Baroness Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach née Countess Dubsky (, ; 13 September 1830 – 12 March 1916) was an Austrian writer and a noblewoman. Noted for her psychological novels, she is regarded as one of the most important German-language writers of the latter portion of the 19th century.

==Biography==

===Early life and family===
She was born at the castle of the Dubský of Třebomyslice family in Zdislawitz near Kroměříž in Moravia (present Zdislavice in the Czech Republic), the daughter of Baron (from 1843: Count) Franz Joseph Dubský of Třebomyslice, a nobleman whose family roots are deeply Catholic and Bohemian, and his wife Maria Rosalia Therese, &quot;née&quot; Baroness von Vockel, who came from a noble Protestant-Saxon background. 

Marie lost her mother in early infancy, but received a careful intellectual training from two stepmothers, first Baroness Eugenie von Bartenstein, and then her second step-mother, Countess Xaverine von Kolowrat-Krakowsky, who often contributed to her inspiration by taking her to the Burgtheater in Vienna periodically. Despite being part of a noble family, and having access to her family&#x27;s vast libraries, she was never actually formally schooled. However, because of her curiosity, access to information, and educated family, she became auto-didact at a young age, and was taught fluent French, German, and Czech. 

In 1848 she married her cousin, Moritz von Ebner-Eschenbach, a physics and chemistry professor at a Viennese engineering academy. Later on, he would become an Austrian captain, and promoted to lieutenant field marshal on his retirement. The couple resided first in Vienna, then, from 1850, at village Louka (&quot;Klosterbruck&quot;) near Znojmo (now part of the town), as the engineering academy had been relocated there, and after 1860 again in Vienna. The marriage was childless to disappointment of both of them. Marie grappled with the domestic tasks. She kept a journal and wrote letters explaining how she felt unsatisfied. It has been speculated that Marie may have suffered from &quot;hysteria&quot; including debilitating headaches and excessive nervousness.
===Career and success===
Marie began devoting herself to literary work. In her endeavours she received assistance and encouragement from Franz Grillparzer and Freiherr von Münch-Bellinghausen. Her first publicized work was the drama &quot;Maria Stuart in Scotland&quot; (), which Philipp Eduard Devrient produced at the Karlsruhe theatre in 1860. Then came a tragedy in five acts, &quot;Marie Roland&quot;, with several one-act dramas: &quot;Doktor Ritter&quot;, &quot;Violets&quot; (), and &quot;The Disconsolate One&quot;. Though she was encouraged to keep writing, her relative failure in the field of playwriting had actually become somewhat of a point of an embarrassment to her family.

After these limited successes in the field of drama, she turned to narrative. Commencing with &quot;Die Prinzessin von Banalien&quot; (1872), she graphically depicts in &quot;Božena&quot; (Stuttgart, 1876, 4th ed. 1899) and &quot;Das Gemeindekind&quot; (Berlin, 1887, 4th ed. 1900) the surroundings of her Moravian home, and in &quot;Lotti, die Uhrmacherin&quot; (Berlin, 1883, 4th ed. 1900), &quot;Zwei Comtessen&quot; (Berlin, 1885, 5th ed. 1898), &quot;Unsühnbar&quot; (1890, 5th ed. 1900) and &quot;Glaubenslos?&quot; (1893) the life of the Austrian aristocracy in town and country.

Much of Ebner-Eschenbach&#x27;s more mainstream success is accredited to Julius Rodenberg due to his publishing Ebner-Eschenbach&#x27;s work in his popular periodical, &quot;Die Deutsche Rundschau&quot;. In 1875, her half-sister, composer Julie Waldburg-Wurzach, used her social contacts at Cotta Verlag (today Klett-Cotta Verlag) to market some of Ebner-Eschenbach&#x27;s work. Ebner-Eschenbach also published &quot;Neue Erzählungen&quot; (Berlin, 1881, 3rd ed. 1894), &quot;Aphorismen&quot; (Berlin, 1880, 4th ed. 1895) and &quot;Parabeln, Märchen und Gedichte&quot; (2nd ed., Berlin, 1892). Von Ebner-Eschenbach&#x27;s elegance of style, her incisive wit and masterly depiction of character give her a foremost place among the German women writers of her time. On the occasion of her 70th birthday the University of Vienna conferred upon her the degree of doctor of philosophy, honoris causa. An edition of Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach&#x27;s &quot;Gesammelte Schriften&quot; (Collected Works) began to appear in 1893 (Berlin).

Throughout her life, she had never created literature or plays for monetary reasons, and so, in her will, she left, as to aid other writers in their own endeavors, the compensation she had received. She died in Vienna, Austria-Hungary.

The Marie Ebner-Eschenbach park in Währing, Vienna, is named after her.
