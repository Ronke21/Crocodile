<text>Simon Bradstreet (baptized March 18, 1603/4 – March 27, 1697) was a New England merchant, politician and colonial administrator who served as the last governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Arriving in Massachusetts on the Winthrop Fleet in 1630, Bradstreet was almost constantly involved in the politics of the colony but became its governor only in 1679. 

He served on diplomatic missions and as agent to the crown in London, and also served as a commissioner to the New England Confederation. He argued for minority positions for accommodation of the demands of King Charles II following his restoration to the throne.

Bradstreet was married to Anne, the daughter of Massachusetts co-founder Thomas Dudley and New England&#x27;s first published poet. He was a businessman, investing in land and shipping interests. Due to his advanced age (he died at 93) Cotton Mather referred to him as the &quot;Nestor of New England&quot;.

==Early life==
Simon Bradstreet was baptized on March 18, 1603/4 in Horbling, Lincolnshire, the second of three sons of Simon and Margaret Bradstreet. His father was the rector of the parish church, and was descended from minor Irish nobility. His grand nephew via his brother John Bradstreet was to become Sir Simon Bradstreet, 1st Baronet. With his father a vocal Nonconformist, the young Simon acquired his Puritan religious views early in life. At the age of 16, Bradstreet entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He studied there for two years, before entering the service of the Earl of Lincoln as an assistant to Thomas Dudley in 1622. There is some uncertainty about whether Bradstreet returned to Emmanuel College in 1623–1624. According to Venn, a Simon Bradstreet attended Emmanuel during this time, receiving an M.A. degree, but genealogist Robert Anderson is of the opinion that this was not the same individual. During one of Bradstreet&#x27;s stints at Emmanuel he was recommended by John Preston as a tutor or governor to Lord Rich, son of the Earl of Warwick. Rich would have been 12 in 1623, and Preston was named Emmanuel&#x27;s master in 1622.

Bradstreet took over Dudley&#x27;s position when the latter moved temporarily to Boston in 1624. On Dudley&#x27;s return several years later, Bradstreet then briefly served as a steward to the Dowager Countess of Warwick. In 1628 he married Dudley&#x27;s daughter Anne, when she was 16.

In 1628, Dudley and others from the Earl of Lincoln&#x27;s circle formed the Massachusetts Bay Company, with a view toward establishing a Puritan colony in North America. Bradstreet became involved with the company in 1629, and in April 1630, the Bradstreets joined the Dudleys and colonial Governor John Winthrop on the fleet of ships that carried them to Massachusetts Bay. There they founded Boston, the capital of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.

==Massachusetts Bay Colony==
After a brief stay in Boston, Bradstreet made his first residence in Newtowne (later renamed Cambridge), near the Dudleys in what is now Harvard Square. In 1637, during the Antinomian Controversy, he was one of the magistrates that sat at the trial of Anne Hutchinson, and voted for her banishment from the colony. In 1639, he was granted land in Salem, near that of John Endecott. He lived there for a time, moving in 1634 to Ipswich before becoming one of the founding settlers of Andover in 1648. 

In 1666, his Andover home was destroyed by fire, supposedly because of &quot;the carelessness of the maid&quot;. He had varied business interests, speculating in land, and investing with other colonists in a ship involved in the coasting trade. In 1660, he purchased shares in the Atherton Trading Company, a land development company with interests in the &quot;Narragansett Country&quot; (present-day southern Rhode Island). He became one of its leading figures, serving on the management committee, and publishing handbills advertising its lands. 

At the time of his death he owned more than of land in five communities spread across the colony. He was known to own two slaves, a woman named Hannah and her daughter Billah.
Bradstreet was heavily involved in colonial politics. When the council met for the first time in Boston, Bradstreet was selected to serve as colonial secretary, a post he would hold until 1644. He was politically moderate, arguing against legislation and judicial decisions punishing people for speaking out against the governing magistrates. Bradstreet was also outspoken in opposition to the witch hysteria that infested his home town of Salem, culminating in numerous trials in 1692.

He served for many years as a commissioner representing Massachusetts to the New England Confederation, an organization that coordinated matters of common interest (principally defense) among most of the New England colonies. He was regularly chosen as an assistant, serving on the council that dominated the public affairs of the colony, but did not reach higher office until 1678, when he was first elected deputy governor under John Leverett. He was against military actions against some of the colony&#x27;s foreign neighbors, opposing official intervention in a French Acadian dispute in the 1640s, and also spoke against attacking the New Netherland during the First Anglo-Dutch War (1652–1654).
Bradstreet was sent on a number of diplomatic missions, dealing with settlers, other English colonies, and the Dutch in New Amsterdam. In 1650, he was sent to Hartford, Connecticut, where the Treaty of Hartford was negotiated to determine the boundary between the English colonies and New Amsterdam. In the following years he negotiated an agreement with settlers in York and Kittery to bring them under Massachusetts jurisdiction.

Following the 1660 restoration of Charles II to the throne of England, colonial authorities again became concerned about preserving their charter rights. Bradstreet in 1661 headed a legislative committee to &quot;consider and debate such matters touching their patent rights, and privileges, and duty to his Majesty, as should to them seem proper.&quot; The letter the committee drafted reiterated the colony&#x27;s charter rights, and also included declarations of allegiance and loyalty to the crown. Bradstreet and John Norton were chosen as agents to deliver the letter to London. Charles renewed the charter, but sent the agents back to Massachusetts with a letter attaching conditions to his assent. The colony was expected, among other things, to expand religious tolerance to include the Church of England and religious minorities like the Quakers. The agents were harshly criticized by hardline factions of the legislature, but Bradstreet defended the need to accommodate the king&#x27;s wishes as the safest course to take. 

How to respond to the king&#x27;s demands divided the colony; Bradstreet was part of the moderate &quot;accommodationist&quot; faction arguing that the colony should obey the king&#x27;s wishes. This faction lost the debate to the hardline &quot;commonwealth&quot; faction, who were in favor of aggressively maintaining the colony&#x27;s charter rights, led through the 1660s by governors John Endecott and Richard Bellingham. With Charles distracted by war with the Dutch and domestic politics in the late 1660s, the issue lay dormant until the mid-1670s. Relations between colony and crown deteriorated when the king then renewed demands for legislative and religious reforms, which hardline magistrates again resisted.

==Governor==

In early 1679 Governor John Leverett died, and Bradstreet as deputy succeeded him. Leverett had opposed accommodation of the king&#x27;s demands, and the change to an accommodationist leadership was too late. Bradstreet would turn out to be the last governor under its original charter. His deputy, Thomas Danforth was from the commonwealth faction. During his tenure, crown agent Edward Randolph was in the colony, attempting to enforce the Navigation Acts, under which certain types of trade involving the colony were illegal.
Randolph&#x27;s enforcement attempts were vigorously resisted by both the merchant classes and sympathetic magistrates despite Bradstreet&#x27;s attempts to accommodate Randolph. Juries frequently refused to condemn ships accused of violating the acts; in one instance Bradstreet tried three times to get a jury to change its verdict. Randolph&#x27;s attempts to enforce the navigation laws eventually convinced the colony&#x27;s general court that it needed to create its own mechanisms for their enforcement. A bill to establish a naval office was vigorously debated in 1681, with the house of deputies, dominated by the commonwealth party, opposing the idea, and the moderate magistrates supporting it. The bill that finally passed was a victory for the commonwealth party, making enforcement difficult and subject to reprisal lawsuits. Bradstreet refused to actually implement the law, and Randolph published open challenges to it. Bradstreet was in some degree vindicated when he won re-election in 1682, and he then used his judicial authority to further undermine the law&#x27;s effects.

Randolph&#x27;s threats to report the colonial legislature&#x27;s intransigence prompted it to dispatch agents to England to argue the colony&#x27;s case; however, their powers were limited. Shortly after their arrival in late 1682, the Lords of Trade issued an ultimatum to the colony: either grant its agents wider powers, including the ability to negotiate modifications to the charter, or risk having the charter voided. The general court responded by issuing the agents instructions to take a hard line. Following legal processes begun in 1683, the charter was formally annulled on October 23, 1684.

==Dominion, and temporary return as governor==

King Charles II in 1684 established the Dominion of New England. Bradstreet&#x27;s brother-in-law Joseph Dudley, who had served as one of the colonial agents, was commissioned by James as President of the Council for New England in 1685 by King James II, and took control of the colony in May 1686. Bradstreet was offered a position on Dudley&#x27;s council, but refused. Dudley was replaced in December 1686 by Sir Edmund Andros, who came to be greatly detested in Massachusetts for vacating existing land titles, and seizing Congregational church properties for Church of England religious services. Andros&#x27; high-handed rule was also unpopular in the other colonies of the dominion.

The idea of revolt against Andros arose as early as January 1689, before news of the December 1688 Glorious Revolution reached Boston. After William III and Mary II took the throne, Increase Mather and Sir William Phips, Massachusetts agents in London, petitioned them and the Lords of Trade for restoration of the Massachusetts charter. Mather furthermore convinced the Lords of Trade to delay notifying Andros of the revolution. He had already dispatched to Bradstreet a letter containing news that a report (prepared before the revolution) stating that the charter had been illegally annulled, and that the magistrates should &quot;prepare the minds of the people for a change.&quot; News of the revolution apparently reached some individuals as early as late March, and Bradstreet is one of several possible organizers of the mob that formed in Boston on April 18, 1689. He, along with other pre-Dominion magistrates and some members of Andros&#x27; council, addressed an open letter to Andros on that day calling for his surrender in order to quiet the mob. Andros, who had fled to the safety of Castle Island, surrendered, and was eventually returned to England after several months in confinement.

In the wake of Andros&#x27; arrest, a council of safety was formed, with Bradstreet as its president. The council drafted a letter to William and Mary, justifying the colony&#x27;s acts in language similar to that used by William in his proclamations when he invaded England. The council fairly quickly decided to revert to the government as it had been under the old charter. In this form Bradstreet resumed the governorship, and was annually re-elected governor until 1692. He had to defend the colony against those who were opposed to the reintroduction of the old rule, who he characterized in reports to London as malcontents and strangers stirring up trouble. The colony&#x27;s northern frontier was also engulfed in King William&#x27;s War, where there was frequent Indian raiding. Bradstreet approved the expeditions of Sir William Phips in 1690 against Acadia and Quebec.

In 1691 William and Mary issued a charter establishing the Province of Massachusetts Bay, and appointed Phips its first governor. Bradstreet was offered a position on Phips&#x27; council when the new governor arrived in 1692, but declined. Bradstreet died at his home in Salem on 27 March 1697 at the age of 93; due to his advanced age he was called the &quot;Nestor of New England&quot; by Cotton Mather.

==Family and legacy==
Bradstreet was buried in the Charter Street Burying Ground in Salem. Poetry by his first wife Anne was published in England in 1650, including verses containing expressions of enduring love for her husband. Anne Bradstreet died in 1672; the couple had eight children, of whom seven survived infancy. Their children included Dudley and John. In 1676 Bradstreet married Ann Gardner, the widow of Captain Joseph Gardner, son of Thomas Gardner of Salem.

<text>All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries was formed in 1967 as a splinter group of Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)), seeing its participation in the United Front government in West Bengal as a betrayal. Initially the group was known as AICCR of the CPI(M), and partially functioned as an inner-party fraction.

AICCCR claimed that the Indian political situation was ripe for armed revolution and denounced participation in the Electoral Politics. The leaders of AICCCR were Charu Majumdar and Kanu Sanyal.

The first meeting if AICCCR in November 1967 was attended by the following persons:
* Shiv Kumar Mishra (Uttar Pradesh)
* S. N. Tiwari (Uttar Pradesh)
* Satyanarayan Singh (Bihar)
* Lakshman Singh (Bihar)
* Appu (Madras)
* Sambhunathan (Madras)
* Babu (Mysore)
* Kunnikkal Narayan (Kerala)
* Philip Prasad (Kerala)
* Rabi Das (Orissa)
* Radha Mohan Das (Orissa)
* Charu Majumdar (West Bengal)
* Sushital Roy Chowdhury (West Bengal)
* Saroj Dutta (West Bengal)
* Asit Sen (West Bengal)
* Pramod Ranjan Sengupta (West Bengal)
* Parimal Das Gupta (West Bengal)

After the Burdwan plenum of CPI(M) in April 1968 the group changed its name to just AICCCR.

At the second meeting of AICCCR in May 1968 there Punjab was also represented.

In August 1968 Parimal Das Gupta broke away from AICCCR.

In September 1968 Andhra Pradesh Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries joined AICCCR.

In February 1969 the Andhra Pradesh Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries was expelled from AICCCR. Rapidly after the expulsion of APCCCR, AICCCR organized an Andhra State Coordination Committee with Tejeshwara Rao as the convenor. AICCCR mainly drew its support from the Srikakulam district.

On 22 April 1969 AICCCR formed the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist).

<doc id="844911" wikidata="Q1337731" url="?curid=844911" title="Merism">
<text>Merism (, ) is a rhetorical device (or figure of speech) in which a combination of two &quot;contrasting parts&quot; of the whole refer to the whole. 

For example, in order to say that someone &quot;searched everywhere&quot;, one could use the merism &quot;searched high and low&quot;. Another example is the sword-and-sandal movie genre, a loose term for a genre of movies made principally in Italy in the 1950s and 1960s set in classical antiquity.

Merisms are common in the Old Testament. For example, in Genesis 1:1, when God creates את השמים ואת הארץ (Modern pronunciation: &quot;et hashamaim ve-et haarets&quot;) &quot;the heavens and the earth&quot; (New Revised Standard Version), the two parts (heavens and earth) do not refer only to the heavens and the earth. Rather, they refer to the heavens, the earth &quot;and everything between them&quot;: God created the &quot;entire world&quot;, the &quot;whole universe&quot;. Other famous examples of Biblical merisms are Genesis 1:5 in which &quot;evening&quot; and &quot;morning&quot; refer to &quot;one day&quot; (including noon, afternoon etc.) and Psalm 139 in which the psalmist declares that God knows &quot;my downsitting and my uprising&quot;: God knows all of the psalmist&#x27;s actions.

==Etymology==
The term entered English in 1894 in the biological sense but had appeared earlier in rhetorical contexts in which it denoted &quot;&#x27;synecdoche in which totality is expressed by contrasting parts&#x27; (such as &quot;high and low&quot;, &quot;young and old&quot;)&quot;. It derives from Modern Latin &quot;merismus&quot;, from Greek μερισμός &quot;merismos&quot; &#x27;a dividing or partitioning&#x27;, ultimately from &quot;merizein&quot; &#x27;to divide&#x27;, from &quot;meros&quot; &#x27;part, share&#x27;.

==Biological usage==
In biology, a merism is a repetition of similar parts in the structure of an organism (Bateson 1894). Such features are called &quot;meristic&quot; characters, and the study of such characters is called meristics. An example is in flowers in considering the number of parts in each whorl of organs from which they are constructed.

==Legal usage==

Merisms frequently figure in the writing of lawyers and are a hallmark of legal style. The two parts of the legal merism &quot;Last Will and Testament&quot; at one time referred to two documents, which were enforced in two separate courts. The &quot;will&quot; disposed of a decedent&#x27;s real property, and the &quot;testament&quot; disposed of chattels. It became customary to combine the instruments in a single dispositive document, and the name has continued long after the doctrines that had required its use became obsolete in common law.

A lawyer who writes a will typically includes a residuary clause that disposes of any property not covered by a prior section. The weight of tradition is such that the lawyer writing such a document will often phrase it something like this:

Traditionally, a gift of real property was called a &quot;devise&quot;, and a gift of other property was a &quot;bequest&quot;. Nowadays, the words &quot;bequeath&quot; and &quot;devise&quot; are synonymous in most jurisdictions and so &quot;I bequeath the rest of my property to...&quot; is enough in both law and logic to achieve the same result. Many deeds frequently contain a traditional clause that says that the grantee is &quot;to have and to hold&quot; the property conveyed. That usage goes back to the days in which the instruments were drawn up in Latin, and is sometimes called a &quot;habendam et tenendam&quot; clause. The use of legal merisms seldom, if ever, adds legal effect to the documents that contain them, but it frequently increases their reading difficulty. However, the weight of tradition and the fear of a deviation from the established formula having unintended legal consequences make lawyers reluctant to revise the traditional formulae, and their clients, seeing them, at least draw the satisfaction of knowing that their documents appear to be written by a lawyer.

In some cases, the doubling (or even tripling) of constituent parts in the meristic constructions arose as a result of the transition of legal discourse from Latin to French and then from French to English. During such periods, key terms were paired with synonyms from multiple languages in an attempt to prevent ambiguity and ensure hermeneutic consistency.

<doc id="844914" wikidata="Q2629256" url="?curid=844914" title="Exotic meson">
<text>In particle physics, exotic mesons are mesons that have quantum numbers not possible in the quark model; some proposals for non-standard quark model mesons could be:
;glueballs or gluonium: Glueballs have no valence quarks at all.
;tetraquarks: Tetraquarks have two valence quark–antiquark pairs.
;hybrid mesons: Hybrid mesons contain a valence quark–antiquark pair and one or more gluons.

All exotic mesons are classed as mesons because they are hadrons and carry zero baryon number. Of these, glueballs must be flavor singlets – that is, must have zero isospin, strangeness, charm, bottomness, and topness. Like all particle states, exotic mesons are specified by the quantum numbers which label representations of the Poincaré symmetry, q.e., by the mass (enclosed in parentheses), and by , where is the angular momentum, is the intrinsic parity, and is the charge conjugation parity; One also often specifies the isospin of the meson. Typically, every quark model meson comes in SU(3) flavor nonet: an octet and an associated flavor singlet. A glueball shows up as an extra (&quot;supernumerary&quot;) particle outside the nonet. 

In spite of such seemingly simple counting, the assignment of any given state as a glueball, tetraquark, or hybrid remains tentative even today, hence the preference for the more generic term &quot;exotic meson&quot;. Even when there is agreement that one of several states is one of these non-quark model mesons, the degree of mixing, and the precise assignment is fraught with uncertainties. There is also the considerable experimental labor of assigning quantum numbers to each state and crosschecking them in other experiments. As a result, all assignments outside the quark model are tentative. The remainder of this article outlines the situation as it stood at the end of 2004.

==Lattice predictions==
Lattice QCD predictions for glueballs are now fairly settled, at least when virtual quarks are neglected. The two lowest states are
::0++ with mass of and
::2++ with mass of 
The 0−+ and exotic glueballs such as 0−− are all expected to lie above . Glueballs are necessarily isoscalar (both for strong isospin, and trivially, weak isospin), with 

The ground state &quot;hybrid mesons&quot; 0−+, 1−+, 1−−, and 2−+ all lie a little below . The hybrid with exotic quantum numbers 1−+ is at . The best lattice computations to date are made in the quenched approximation, which neglects virtual quarks loops. As a result, these computations miss mixing with meson states.

==0++ states==
The data show five isoscalar resonances: (500), (980), (1370), (1500), and (1710). Of these the (500) is usually identified with the of chiral models. The decays and production of (1710) give strong evidence that it is also a meson.

===Glueball candidate===
The (1370) and (1500) cannot both be a quark model meson, because one is . The production of the higher mass state in two photon reactions such as or reactions is highly suppressed. The decays also give some evidence that one of these could be a glueball.

===Tetraquark candidate===
The (980) has been identified by some authors as a tetraquark meson, along with the  = 1 states (980) and (800). Two long-lived (&quot;narrow&quot; in the jargon of particle spectroscopy) states: the scalar (0) state (2317) and the vector (1) meson (2460), observed at CLEO and BaBar, have also been tentatively identified as tetraquark states. However, for these, other explanations are possible.

==2 states==
Two isoscalar states are definitely identified: (1270) and the ′(1525). No other states have been consistently identified by all experiments. Hence it is difficult to say more about these states.

==1 and other states==
The two isovector exotics 1(1400) and 1(1600) seem to be well established experimentally. A recent coupled-channel analysis has shown these states, which were initially considered separate, are consistent with a single pole. A second exotic state is disfavored. The assignment of these states as hybrids is favored. Lattice QCD calculations show the lightest with 1 quantum numbers has strong overlap with operators featuring gluonic construction.

The (1800) 0, (1900) 1 and the (1870) 2 are fairly well identified states, which have been tentatively identified as hybrids by some authors. If this identification is correct, then it is a remarkable agreement with lattice computations, which place several hybrids in this range of masses.

<text>Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) is a website provided by NASA and Michigan Technological University (MTU). It reads: &quot;Each day a different image or photograph of our universe is featured, along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer.&quot;
The photograph does not necessarily correspond to a celestial event on the exact day that it is displayed, and images are sometimes repeated.
These often relate to current events in astronomy and space exploration. The text has several hyperlinks to more pictures and websites for more information. The images are either visible spectrum photographs, images taken at non-visible wavelengths and displayed in false color, video footage, animations, artist&#x27;s conceptions, or micrographs that relate to space or cosmology.

Past images are stored in the APOD Archive, with the first image appearing on June 16, 1995. This initiative has received support from NASA, the National Science Foundation, and MTU. The images are sometimes authored by people or organizations outside NASA, and therefore APOD images are often copyrighted, unlike many other NASA image galleries.

When the APOD website was created, it received a total of 14 page views on its first day. , the APOD website has received over a billion image views throughout its lifetime. APOD is also translated into 21 languages daily.

APOD was presented at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in 1996. Its practice of using hypertext was analyzed in a paper in 2000. It received a &quot;Scientific American&quot; Sci/Tech Web Award in 2001. In 2002, the website was featured in an interview with Nemiroff on CNN &quot;Saturday Morning News&quot;. In 2003, the two authors published a book titled &quot;The Universe: 365 Days&quot; from Harry N. Abrams, which is a collection of the best images from APOD as a hardcover &quot;coffee table&quot; style book. APOD was the Featured Collection in the November 2004 issue of &quot;D-Lib Magazine&quot;.

During the United States federal government shutdown of 2013, APOD continued its service on mirror sites.

Robert J. Nemiroff and Jerry T. Bonnell were awarded the 2015 Klumpke-Roberts Award by the Astronomical Society of the Pacific &quot;for outstanding contributions to public understanding and appreciation of astronomy&quot; for their work on APOD. The site was awarded the International Astronomical Union&#x27;s 2022 Astronomy Outreach Prize.

<doc id="844925" wikidata="Q7781775" url="?curid=844925" title="Theodore Enslin">
<text>Theodore Vernon Enslin (March 25, 1925 – November 21, 2011) was an American poet associated with Cid Corman&#x27;s &quot;Origin&quot; and press. He is widely regarded as one of the most musical of American avant-garde poets.

Enslin was born in Chester, Pennsylvania. His father was a biblical scholar and his mother a Latin scholar. He studied musical composition at Cambridge, Massachusetts. His teacher, Nadia Boulanger, was the first person to recognize his ability as a writer and encouraged him to pursue his interest in poetry. He has said &quot;I like to be considered as a composer who happens to use words instead of notes.&quot; His first book, &quot;The Work Proposed&quot;, was published by Origin in 1958.

Enslin moved to Maine in 1960 and had lived in Washington County ever since, working at odd jobs and making and selling handmade walking sticks. The Maine landscape forms an integral part of his poetry, as does its isolation, both geographic and in terms of distance from literary fashion and the academy, on the physical margin of the United States. &quot;Ranger&quot; 1978 is one of the key American long poems of the second half of the 20th century. A bibliographical checklist of Enslin&#x27;s works was prepared by Robert J. Bertholf and published in 2017.

He died in Milbridge, Maine on November 21, 2011.

<doc id="844927" wikidata="Q1814569" url="?curid=844927" title="Risca">
<text>Risca () is a town in the Caerphilly County Borough and the historic boundaries of Monmouthshire in south-east Wales. Risca has a railway station, re-opened on the Ebbw Valley Railway in February 2008, after a gap of 46 years. It is split into two communities; Risca East and Risca West. It has a population of 11,700. Cardiff the capital of Wales can be reached in under 28 minutes from the nearby railway station of Risca and Pontymister station which reopened in 2008 after a gap of nearly 60 years.

The town lies at the south-eastern edge of the South Wales Coalfield and the town has been shaped by mining, together with other heavy industries, for many centuries.

Risca is home to Ty-Sign, which is a large housing estate built in the early 1960s as a satellite village for the then new Llanwern steelworks. Risca has a rural aspect and is surrounded to the east and west by several extensively wooded hills including Mynydd Machen () and Twmbarlwm () which attract tourists for the hillwalking and mountain bikers to Cwmcarn Forest Drive.

==History==
There is evidence of human habitation in the Risca area going back thousands of years, such as the Silures hillfort on nearby Twmbarlwm, however the area was rural and sparsely populated until the nineteenth century. As local industries expanded and transport links improved with the building of the canal and railways, the population rapidly increased.

Several arguments have been put forward for the derivation of the name &quot;Risca/Rhisga&quot; including that it comes from the Welsh &quot;yr is cae&quot; meaning &quot;the lower field&quot; or &quot;yr hesg cae&quot; meaning &quot;field or rushes&quot; or &quot;rhisgl&quot; meaning oak bark.

The earliest known official use of the name &quot;Risca&quot; for the place was in 1476 when two men from Risca were charged at the Newport Assizes although there are also ecclesiastical documents which go as far back as 1146 which include a man called &quot;Kadmore de Risca&quot;.

From 1540, Risca is found regularly in land transactions involving the Tredegar estates and in 1747 John Wesley recorded a visit in his diary.

Rapid population increase started around 1820 with the opening of the mines.

Note: Until the 1990s, these figures include the population of the nearby villages of Crosskeys and Pontymister but since the reorganisation of wards only includes the population of Risca East and Risca West wards.

===Industrial Heritage===
From the early nineteenth century, the area around Risca has been dominated by coal mining and transport systems to access the mines, although there is also evidence that lead and coal were being extracted much earlier. 

The first large scale mine was known as the Black Vein colliery and it was located near to the boundary between Risca and what is now Cross Keys and closed in 1921. The New Risca Colliery, which was between what is now Wattsville and Cross Keys, operated until 1967.

The Black Vein coal seam was very explosive and the mines working it experienced a series of serious mine accidents. In 1846, 35 miners were killed in an explosion at the Black Vein Colliery, and in 1860 more than 140 miners were killed at the same mine. In 1860, an explosion at the New Risca colliery, which was working the same seam of coal, killed 120 men.

In addition to its coal mines, brickworks, quarries, and copper, tin, and iron works also developed in and around Risca through the nineteenth century.

Risca was served by the Monmouthshire Railway and Canal Company lines to the north from Tredegar (via the Sirhowy Railway) and Ebbw Vale towards Newport to the south, including passenger facilities at the original Risca railway station.

===Twentieth century===
The dominance of coal in the local economy meant that mine closures in the 1930s and 1940s caused severe unemployment in Risca. Some charitable relief was sent by the Mayor of Oxford&#x27;s Mining Distress Committee. In 1931, this included - with the help of a grant from the Educational Settlements Association - the founding of the Educational Settlement at Oxford House, Risca. The first wardens of the settlement were a couple, Mr and Mrs Wills. David Wills was a UK pioneer of psychiatric social work, a holder of a William Straight Fellowship at the New York School of Social Work at Columbia University. Oxford House, Risca was founded at Hillside, moving in 1937 to The Grove. Oxford House is now an adult education centre operated by Caerphilly Borough Council.

By the end of the 1970s, most of the local coalmines had closed and the majority of the population were working in other industries.

The town is now part of the Cardiff Capital Region which has a combined population of 1,543,293. 

==Governance==
In the UK Parliament, Risca is part of the constituency of Newport West and Islwyn, a Labour Party stronghold represented since the 2024 general election by Ruth Jones. Don Touhig previously represented the constituency following a by-election in 1995, but did not stand for re-election in 2010. The seat and its predecessor was formerly represented for 25 years by the former Labour leader Neil Kinnock.

In the Senedd, Risca is part of the constituency of Islwyn, represented since 2003 by Labour&#x27;s Irene James. At the first Assembly elections in 1999 Brian Hancock, Plaid Cymru, won the seat in a major upset and one of 17 seats in the National Assembly of Wales for Plaid Cymru.

<doc id="844933" wikidata="Q7010878" url="?curid=844933" title="New Oscott">
<text>New Oscott is an area of Birmingham, England.

It was named after the Oscott area of Birmingham, when St. Mary&#x27;s College, the Roman Catholic seminary, moved from that site to the new one. The original then became known as Old Oscott.

The only pub in New Oscott is the Beggars Bush. The area also hosts the Princess Alice Retail Park and adjacent Tesco Extra superstore.

Princess Alice Retail Park was the site of a large and well known children&#x27;s home from the late 19th century. When the site was sold for redevelopment in the 1980s the home was demolished leaving Brampton Hall which was a Community Centre serving the local area. Brampton Hall offered a range of classes and interest groups to the community and was a popular venue for parties and children&#x27;s birthday parties. In recent years, this hall got knocked down and turned into a fast food chain, Frankie and Bennie&#x27;s, which has since been turned into a Burger King.

The area near The Beggars Bush used to be home to a traffic island which was removed and a new double traffic light system was put into place.

The name Beggar&#x27;s Bush derives from a thorn bush that was located in the middle of the Chester Road and was encircled by iron railings. At an unknown date, it is said that a beggar died after sheltering under the bush, and as the bush marked the boundary of the parish, there was debate over who should pay for the burial of the man. The bush was destroyed by road workers in the mid-1930s to the disapproval of locals.

Bus services in New Oscott are operated by National Express West Midlands and Diamond Bus providing links to Birmingham, Sutton Coldfield, Erdington and Walsall. The nearest railway station is Wylde Green although more convenient for connecting bus services to New Oscott is Sutton Coldfield.

<doc id="844934" wikidata="Q1897136" url="?curid=844934" title="Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist)">
<text>The Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) (CPI(ML)) was an Indian communist party formed by the All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries (AICCCR) at a congress in Calcutta in 1969. The foundation of the party was declared by Kanu Sanyal at a mass meeting in Calcutta on 22 April, Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s birthday. Later the CPI(ML) party splintered into several Naxalite groups.

==Origin==
The CPI (ML) was formed by the radicals within the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM) who grew concerned by the increasingly parliamentary character of its politics. A debate ensued where the radicals accused the CPM leadership of turning towards revisionism. Finally, the party purged the radicals, who went to form the CPI (ML). The CPI (ML) advocated armed revolution and denounced participation in the electoral process. Its leaders were Charu Majumdar and Saroj Dutta, both of whom had belonged to the left-wing within the CPM in northern West Bengal. Sanyal, Jongol Santhal and his followers had mobilised a revolutionary peasants movement in Naxalbari, which evolved into an armed uprising of the mostly Santhal tribal inhabitants. CPI (ML) saw Naxalbari as the spark that would start a new Indian revolution, and the movement came to be known as &quot;naxalites&quot;. In several parts of India, for example Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, other parts of West Bengal, and in Srikakulam in northern Andhra Pradesh, the CPI (ML) organised guerrilla units. The party got moral support from China, which actively encouraged the attempts of CPI (ML) to launch revolution.

According to Pradip Basu in his book &quot;Towards Naxalbari (1953-1967): An Account of Inner-Party Ideological Struggle&quot;:

&quot;There were two nuclei of radicals in the party organisation in West Bengal. One &#x27;theorist&#x27; section around Parimal Das Gupta in Calcutta, which wanted to persuade the party leadership to correct revisionist mistakes through inner-party debate, and one &#x27;actionist&#x27; section led by Charu Majumdar and Kanu Sanyal in North Bengal. The &#x27;actionists&#x27; were impatient, and strived to organize armed uprisings. According to Basu, due to the prevailing political climate of youth and student rebellion it was the &#x27;actionists&#x27; which came to dominate the new Maoist movement in India, instead of the more theoretically advanced sections.&quot; 

=== Naxalbari uprising ===

It occurred in Naxalbari of Siliguri subdivision, Darjeeling district under the leadership of communist leaders like Charu Majumdar and others who later became the part of CPI (ML).

=== Srikakulam peasant uprising ===

In the Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh, communist leaders aligned themselves with the then formed AICCCR and launched peasant upsurge in Srikakulam which continued for almost 5 years in late 1960s and early 1970s.

==After 1970==
The first party congress was held in Calcutta 1970. A Central Committee was elected. As a result of both external repression and a failure to maintain internal unity, the movement did however degenerate into extreme sectarianism. Instead of popular armed struggle in the countryside, individual terrorism in Calcutta became a principal method of struggle. In 1971 Satyanarayan Singh revolted against the leadership, &quot;individual killing of people branded as class enemy&quot; and sectarianism of Majumdar. The result became that the party was split into two, one CPI (ML) led by Satyanarayan Singh and one CPI (ML) led by Majumdar. In 1972, frail and broken Majumdar died of multiple diseases in police custody; after his death a series of splits took place during the major part of the 1970s. The naxalite movement suffered a period of extremely harsh repression that rivalled the Dirty Wars of South America at the same time that the movement got all more fragmented.

After Majumdar&#x27;s death the CPI (ML) central committee split into pro- and anti-Majumdar factions. In December 1972 the Central Committee of the pro-Charu Majumdar CPI (ML) led by Sharma and Mahadev Mukherjee adopted resolution to follow the line of Charu Majumdar unconditionally which others did not agree to. The pro-Charu Majumdar CPI (ML) later split into pro- and anti-Lin Biao factions. The pro-Lin Biao faction became known as Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) (Mahadev Mukherjee) and the anti-Lin Biao-group later became known as Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Liberation and was led by Jauhar, Vinod Mishra, Swadesh Bhattacharya.

==Legacy==
Today, there exist a large number of political organisations whose roots are in the AICCCR/CPI (ML). Only C.P.I (M-L) faction led by Mahadev Mukherjee follows Charu Majumdar&#x27;s concept of armed revolution and annihilation, whereas others have condemned the excesses of the sectarian epoch. All the organisations belonging to the later category have established legal overground structures (trade unions, student groups, peasant organisations, etc.) and started participating in elections.

<doc id="844935" wikidata="Q370047" url="?curid=844935" title="Amiga Fast File System">
<text>The Amiga Fast File System (abbreviated AFFS, or more commonly historically as FFS) is a file system used on the Amiga personal computer from the computer-manufacturer Commodore Int&#x27;l.. The previous Amiga filesystem was never given a specific name and known originally simply as &quot;DOS&quot; or &quot;AmigaDOS&quot;. Upon the release of FFS and for purposes of differentiation, the original filesystem became retrospectively known as Amiga&#x27;s &quot;Old File System&quot;, shortened OFS. The former file-system OFS, which was primarily designed for use with floppy disks, had been proving slow to keep up with hard drives of the era.

FFS was designed as a full replacement for the original Amiga filesystem. FFS differs from its predecessor mainly in the removal of redundant information. Data blocks contain nothing but data, allowing the filesystem to manage the transfer of large chunks of data directly from the host adapter to the final destination.

==Characteristics==

OFS was the predecessor to FFS. Before FFS was released, AmigaOS had a single filesystem simply called AmigaDOS: this uses 24 bytes per sector for redundancy data, providing for reconstructing structural data on less reliable media such as floppy disks. When higher-speed media (i.e. hard disks) became more available to the Amiga, this redundant data posed a bottleneck as all data needed to be realigned to be passed to the application. The redundancy was removed with FFS and the data read in from media are passed to the application directly. The previous filesystem, AmigaDOS, was renamed OFS, Old File System, to differentiate between it and FFS. FFS was backward-compatible and could access devices formatted with OFS.

Given these advantages, FFS was rapidly adopted as the most common filesystem used by almost all Amiga users, although OFS continued to be widely used on floppy disks from third-party software vendors. (This was purely for compatibility with pre-AmigaOS 2 systems in games and applications that did not actually require AmigaOS 2+, as machines running earlier versions of the OS without FFS in the ROM could not boot from these floppies, although they could still read them if they had FFS installed.)

Amiga FFS is simple and efficient, and when introduced was more than adequate, and had many advantages compared to the file systems of other platforms. However, as OFS had done before it, it aged; as drives became larger and the number of files on them increased, its use as a day-to-day filesystem became more problematic in terms of difficulty of maintenance and competitiveness of general performance. Despite this, it is still used on AmigaOS systems and shipped with both MorphOS and AmigaOS 4.

By the last Commodore release of AmigaOS, 3.1, FFS was still the only filesystem shipped as standard with the Amiga, but it was already showing its age as technology advanced. FFS (and OFS) stores a &quot;bitmap&quot; of the filesystem in a single sector. On write, this is first marked as invalid, then the write is completed, then the bitmap is updated and marked as valid. If a write operation is interrupted by a crash or disk removal, this then allows the &#x27;disk-validator&#x27; program to undo the damage. This resembled a very simple form of filesystem journaling. To allow the disk to be used again with an invalidated OFS or FFS filesystem, the entire disk has to be completely scanned and the bitmap rebuilt, but only the data being modified during the write would be lost. During this scanning the disk cannot be written to (except by the disk-validator as it performs its function), and read access is very slow.

AmigaOS originally included a disk-validator on every bootable disk, which was prone to being replaced by viruses to allow themselves to spread (for example the &quot;Saddam Hussein&quot; virus). Later it became part of the ROM from Kickstart 2.x onwards, protecting it from malicious replacement. The disk-validator attempted to repair the bitmap on an invalidated drive by write-protecting the drive and scanning it; this could take a long time and made it very slow to access the disk until it was finished, especially on slower media. As hard drives got larger and contained more files, the validation process could take many hours. In addition, files and directories could feasibly be lost (often without the user being notified or even aware) during the process if their data hashes were corrupted. In some cases the validator could fail and leave the disk in a non-validated state, requiring the user to use a third-party disk tool like DiskSalv to make the volume writable again, or simply save the files by copying them to a fresh partition—a very slow process.

FFS was also originally limited to 32-bit addressing and therefore about 4 GB drives, or at least the first 4 GB on a larger drive. Attempting to use FFS partitions beyond this limit caused serious data corruption all through the drive. FFS belatedly got some third-party 64-bit patches and then official (but non-Commodore) updates to allow it to circumvent these limitations. The latter were supplied with AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9, from Haage &amp; Partner. The former often were supplied with third-party disk controllers, such as those from Phase5, where the ability to use large-capacity disks was a selling point. The two systems were not mutually compatible.

In terms of support tools, although Commodore itself only shipped with an application called DiskDoctor (and later removed it from AmigaOS disks), FFS had a small selection of third-party tools—most notably DiskSalv—to maintain the file system and repair and validate it, undelete files, or reverse &quot;quick formats&quot; (filesystem initializations). An OFS or FFS volume had to be locked to defragment or convert to different FFS modes to prevent corruption and this made it inaccessible to everything but the tool defragmenting it. Most of these tools were not updated when FFS became capable of 64-bit addressing and could only operate on partitions smaller than 4 GB; they could not read partitions bigger than 4 GB, and would generally corrupt partitions &quot;beyond&quot; the 4 GB boundary. When hard drives in use by Amiga users were reaching 4 GB in size, this became a problem.

For all of these reasons, FFS was often replaced by users in the mid-1990s with more up-to-date alternatives such as Smart File System (SFS) and Professional File System (PFS), which did not have these limitations and were considered safer, faster and more efficient. SFS in particular continued to be developed and is now as close to a generic AmigaOS filesystem as FFS, and is the default filesystem for AROS.

==History==
FFS was introduced with version 1.3 of AmigaOS in 1988, and replaced both the Kickstart ROM (or Kickstart floppy for A1000s) and Workbench floppy with updated software. It carried the version number of v34, like the rest of the AmigaOS 1.3 components.

Kickstart 1.3 provided autobooting support so that the machine could now be booted from hard disk or reset-proof RAM disk (&quot;RAD:&quot;), whereas earlier Kickstart releases could only be booted from floppy disk. Workbench 1.3 provided the FFS filesystem device driver on disk, which could be copied into the Rigid Disk Block (RDB) on hard disks. Compliant block devices would then load and install the filesystem driver before filesystems were mounted and thus make it possible to use loadable filesystems on hard disks. Kickstart 1.2 could boot Workbench 1.3 from floppy (and vice versa), but it needed both Kickstart and Workbench 1.3 to autoboot FFS-formatted hard disks.

FFS support was merged into the ROM-based filesystem from Kickstart 2.0 onwards, and so it was no longer necessary to install FFS in the RDB. The ability to load filesystems from the RDB still remained available in case one wished to fix ROM bugs, get new FFS features, or use a third-party filesystem.

Floppies are unpartitioned devices without a RDB and also do not use the autobooting mechanism, so were only bootable if the disk&#x27;s dostype was one the ROM-based filesystem understood. As a result, FFS-formatted floppies were not bootable until the release of Kickstart 2.0, and mounting them under Workbench 1.3 involved some ugly unsupported hacks. Similarly, &quot;Directory Cache&quot; variants were not bootable or supported until Kickstart 3.0.

The various FFS flavours did not have any compatibility problems with Amiga software, even ones that were considered &quot;system-unfriendly&quot;. Software would either use the system calls and thus work with any filesystem, or be &quot;trackloaders&quot; and not use a filesystem at all.

==FFS Modes==
FFS operated in several modes, defined as and by &quot;DOS types&quot;. AmigaOS filesystems are identified by a four letter-descriptor which is specified either in the RDB or a so-called &quot;mountlist&quot; or &quot;dosdriver&quot;; alternatively (as was the case in &quot;trackdisk&quot;-like devices like floppy disks), the disk itself could be formatted in any DOStype specified.

The FFS-DOStypes introduced with AmigaOS v1.3 (v34) were as follows:
AmigaOS 2.04 made FFS (now v37) part of the Kickstart ROM and introduced new modes for handling international characters in filenames, and for an on-disk directory cache. Each new mode was available with both OFS- and FFS-DOSTypes. This odd system was for reasons of parity: OFS-modes apart from codice_1 were almost never used but were available nonetheless.

The new FFS-DOStypes introduced with AmigaOS v2.04 (v37):

The last published major version of FFS by Commodore (v39), saw the following FFS-DOSTypes being introduced with AmigaOS v3.0:
Version v40.1 was the last version of FFS released by Commodore, and came with AmigaOS 3.1, both on the OS disks and in the ROM.

After this, several Unofficial patches appeared which allowed its use on drives after the first 2 GB of a hard disk, using a 64-bit addressing system called &quot;TrackDisk64&quot; or TD64 (although the 2 GB limit on file size and the 127 GB limit on partition-sizes remained, as it was a limitation of AmigaOS&#x27; codice_2 and all then-current Amiga software) and carried the version number of v44.

The version of FFS that came with the later official licenced AmigaOS-releases from German distributor Haage &amp; Partner, AmigaOS 3.5 and v3.9 respectively, was v45 – It differed from the former versions in that it used a alternate 64-bit addressing system, called &quot;New Style Device&quot; or NSD.

More recently in 2003, MorphOS and AmigaOS 4 have introduced support for a slightly updated &quot;FFS2&quot;, by Olaf Barthel (FFS v46, v50 respectively) – This release is compatible with the older FFS. It is PowerPC native, and introduced further two more DOSTypes:
However, despite eventually obtaining additional features and ultimately the ability to use the long filenames, by the time these additions were made, FFS already compared very poorly to other available filesystems on the platforms it was available for. Apart from these extra DOSTypes, there are little or no functional difference between FFS and FFS2 (although some older non-specified bugs may have been dealt with) and should still not be used except for legacy purposes. Disk validation is still necessary in FFS2 (and may still result in data loss) just as it was on FFS, despite early beliefs to the contrary.

In September 2018, Hyperion Entertainment released Amiga OS 3.1.4 build upon the Amiga OS 3.1 source. It included an updated FastFileSystem V46 within the Kickstart ROM. The V46 FFS natively supports the APIs for &quot;TD_64&quot;, &quot;NSD&quot;, and/or the classic 32-bit &quot;TD_ storage&quot;-calls. This lets the Amiga OS v3.x use and boot from large media (&gt;4GB) natively, and support &gt;2GB partition sizes.

In July 2019, an additional file-based update to FFS was contained in the 3.1.4.1 update. In May 2021, an updated Amiga OS 3.2 was released and provided a matching ROM-based V47 FFS update which gained a few minor features and fixes.

==Other implementations==
There were few other implementations which are able to read FFS filesystems, which would normally require an Amiga emulator and a copy of the operating system ROMs to be read. Most notably, support for affs (Amiga Fast File System) can be compiled into Linux kernels, and offers full read, write and format support on FFS and OFS partitions of all dostypes except DOS\6 and DOS\7 (which are probably incredibly rare).

On the Amiga, the freeware application xfs could, among many filesystems, read and write to devices formatted in OFS or FFS, and was probably the sole Amiga filesystem apart from FFS/FFS2 itself to do so. It did not support DOS\6 or DOS\7, which it predates, or formatting of devices.

<text>On the Amiga, the Old File System, sometimes also called &quot;Amiga File System&quot;, was the filesystem for AmigaOS before the Amiga Fast File System. Even though it used 512-byte blocks, it reserved the first small portion of each block for metadata, leaving an actual data block capacity of 488 bytes per block. It wasn&#x27;t very suitable for anything except floppy disks, and it was soon replaced.

== History ==
Commonly known as just the &quot;Amiga File System&quot;, it originally came from the filesystem of TRIPOS, which formed the basis of the first versions of AmigaDOS. It received the nickname of &quot;Old&quot; or &quot;Original&quot; File System when Fast File System was released with AmigaOS 1.3.

OFS is very good for repairing the filesystem in the event of a problem, although the so-called DiskDoctor provided by Commodore quickly earned the name DiskDestroyer, because it could not repair No-DOS type autostart disks provided by third-party software manufacturers as bootable disks for games. The idea to create non-standard autobootable disks was born in a primitive attempt to prevent copy of such disks and to avoid the loading and launch of Amiga DOS, in order to directly access the Amiga graphic, audio and memory chipsets. DiskDoctor in fact changed autostart disks bootblocks into standard AmigaDOS-based ones, renaming a disk with &quot;Lazarus&quot; namedisk, and made the autostart disk unusable.

== Characteristics of AmigaDOS Floppy Disks ==
Amiga uses MFM encoding/decoding by default when handling floppy disks. There are 80 cylinders on an Amiga floppy disk. Each cylinder has 2 MFM tracks, one on each side of the disk. Double density (DD) disks have 11 sectors per MFM track, high density (HD) disks have 22 sectors.

The geometry of an Amiga floppy disk is as follows:

* DD disks: 512 bytes/sector, 11 sector/track, 2 track/cyl, 80 cyl/disk
* HD disks: 512 bytes/sector, 22 sector/track, 2 track/cyl, 80 cyl/disk

The DD disk has 11 * 2 * 80 = 1760 (0 to 1759) blocks, while the HD disk has 22 * 2 * 80 = 3520 blocks.

Amiga stores 880 KiB on a DD disk and 1760 KiB on an HD floppy disk.

==Characteristics of Files under AmigaDOS==
Prior to AmigaOS 3.5, AmigaDOS file handles maintained a 32-bit wide offset parameter (unsigned), telling where to start the next read or write operation. The biggest size for any single Amiga file under these operating systems therefore comes to 232 = 4 GiB. After Amiga OS 3.5, file handles may reference 264 = 16 EiB files. However, OFS-formatted disks continue to retain the 32-bit limitations, for that is an intrinsic limitation of the format as recorded on the media.

An OFS datablock stores block size BSIZE-24 bytes (i.e. normally 488 bytes at most frequently used BSIZE of 512 bytes).

The rootblock is located at the physical middle of the media: block number 880 for DD disks, block 1760 for HDs. This helps minimize seek times.

The exact calculation for where it is stored is as follows:
The rootblock contains information about the disk: its name, its formatting date, etc. It also contains information on accessing the files/directories/links located at the uppermost (root) directory.

The characters &#x27;/&#x27; and &#x27;:&#x27; are forbidden in file and volume names, but *!@#$%|^+&amp;_()=\-[]{}&#x27;;&quot;,&lt;&gt;.? and letters with diacritical marks like âè are allowed.

The date fields in the root block (and other blocks) are structured in the form of DAYS, MINS and TICKS. The DAYS field contains the number of days since January 1. 1978. MINS is the number of minutes that have passed since midnight and TICKS are expressed in 1/50s of a second. A day value of zero is considered illegal by most programs. Since the DAYS value is stored as a 32-bit number, the Amiga filesystem does not have an inherent Year 2000 problem or Year 2038 problem.

To reach a file, directory or link, AmigaDOS uses a hash function to calculate which 32-bit word in the disk block to use as a pointer to a hash bucket list, which in turn contains the file, directory, or link record. A bucket list is used to support filesystem objects with names that hash to the same offset. For example: file_1a, file_24 and file_5u have the same hash value.

Filename characters can be lowercase and uppercase, but are not case sensitive when accessed. That is to say, &quot;MyFile&quot; and &quot;myfile&quot; in the same directory refer to the same file.

Files are composed of a file header block, which contains information about the file (size, last access time, data block pointers, etc.), and the data blocks, which contain the actual data. The file header block contains up to BSIZE/4-56 data block pointers (which amounts to 72 entries with the usual 512 byte blocks). If a file is larger than that, file extension blocks will be allocated to hold the data block pointers. File extension blocks are organised in a linked list, which starts in the file header block (&#x27;extension&#x27; field).

<text>The A80 is a road in Scotland, running from the A8 to Moodiesburn, north east of Glasgow. Prior to the M80 opening, the A80 was one of Scotland&#x27;s busiest trunk roads.

==Original Route==

The A80 was once the main route from Glasgow to Stirling. It has now been superseded by the M80 motorway which roughly follows the route of the original A80.

==A80 / M80 Upgrade project==
===History===
One of Scotland&#x27;s worst traffic jams has a reputation for being the A80. In 1992, the M80 Stepps bypass opened between the M8 and Stepps to relieve pressure on the road. This caused the M80 to lie in two parts with the A80 providing the link between the two sections: between the end of the Stepps bypass, and the 1974 section of the M80 which resumed at Haggs. The Stepps-Haggs stretch, built in the 1960s, was under-capacity in relation to the amount of traffic it carried, and the lack of hard shoulders meant that a vehicle breakdown potentially could cause massive jams

=== Auchenkilns roundabout upgrade ===

Despite long-term plans to replace the Stepps-Haggs section with a completed M80, the troublesome Auchenkilns roundabout in Cumbernauld was replaced by a grade separated junction in 2005 as traffic congestion meant it could not wait for the final upgrade (which at that stage, was still in planning). A dumbbell interchange junction between the A80, A73 and B8048 was opened in November 2005. A scheme was devised in the 1970s to replace the A80 with a motorway which would have linked western segment of the M80, bypassing Cumbernauld and linking to the M8, to the eastern segment, where it connects to the A803 and M876, through what was known as the &quot;Kelvin Valley Route&quot;. However, this was not implemented.

=== M80 Stepps to Haggs completion project ===
:&quot;See M80 motorway&quot;

The Scottish Executive announced in 2002 that the A80 would be upgraded to Motorway standard, replacing the A80 from Stepps to Haggs with the M80. The Kelvin Valley route was not chosen as it would have breached the Antonine Wall and destroyed the Castlecary Roman fort; instead an on-line upgrade through Cumbernauld was selected.

The upgrade was completed in September 2011.

<text>Perry Common is an area of north Birmingham that includes parts of both Stockland Green and Kingstanding. It falls within the Birmingham Erdington parliamentary constituency.

North Birmingham Academy (formerly College High School) is located in Perry Common as are the Hawthorn Shopping Centre on Hawthorn Road and Witton Lakes.

==Regeneration==
Redevelopment has been carried out by Witton Lodge Community Association, who have overseen the development of two large care homes as well as more than 300 new houses for sale and rent. The scheme also included the development of new roads, public open spaces and community facilities.

On June 19, 2012 the Perry Common Community Hall was re-opened after a major re-fit and extension. The hall provides space for various regular clubs and activities, includes meeting and hot desk space for local businesses as well as serving as a base for the Witton Lodge Community Association.

==History==
The area was developed for council housing during the 1920s, with well over 1,000 families moving to the area from dilapidated inner city slums. The houses were built from concrete in a style pioneered by Henry Boot Limited. By the 1980s, however, the estate was facing serious problems. Many of the homes were in a poor state of repair, with cracks in the walls and rising damp being just some of the many problems plaguing the now unpopular Boot houses. During the 1990s, the city council earmarked 908 homes in the area for demolition.

<text>Rednal is a residential suburb on the south western edge of metropolitan Birmingham, West Midlands, England, southwest of Birmingham city centre and forming part of Longbridge parish and electoral ward. Historically it was part of Worcestershire.

Rednal is home to approximately 2,000 residents. The suburb is located in a triangle formed by Rubery and the Bristol Road South to the north and north west, the former MG Rover car factory to the south east and the Lickey Hills and Cofton Hackett Park just south. The popular rural Lickey Hills Country Park is south of Rednal, with Rednal Hill being the nearest peak.

== History ==
The first evidence of people settling in the area dates back to the Stone Age, when a Neolithic hunter lost a flint arrow head on Rednal Hill. The arrow head is leaf-shaped and made of flint and is certainly over 4000 years old. Additionally a 3000-year-old flint javelin point was found lying on the surface by an observant Mr W. H. Laurie when the Lickey&#x27;s road was being widened in 1925. A flint-scraping tool was found in the area near the Earl of Plymouth monument. The artefacts are on display at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery.

The Romans constructed a road over the Lickeys very near to the present Rose Hill gap before it swung north through Rednal and followed the route of the present-day Bristol Road South. The road would have been used to transport salt and other goods between the Roman encampments at Worcester and Metchley, near where Birmingham&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth Hospital now stands. It would have also been used as a military marching route by Roman soldiers. In 1963, a Roman coin was found near Rednal Hill School by a Janet and Stephen Harris. The coin was a dupondius struck during the reign of Emperor Antoninus Pius, who ruled Rome and Britain from 138 to 161. The tiny coin was struck from brass and would have been worth about the price of a loaf of bread.

In Norman times, Rednal and the Lickeys formed part of the royal manor of Bromsgrove and were set aside as a royal hunting forest. As well as stocking the area with deer, the Normans deliberately introduced rabbits to the area that were kept in large enclosures, or &#x27;warrens&#x27;, hence the road and place names. The word &#x27;forest&#x27; means &#x27;place of deer&#x27; and did not necessarily mean that the area was totally covered with trees.

Rednal was known by the Anglo-Saxon name, &quot;Wreodan Healh&quot;, meaning &#x27;thicket nook&#x27;. Together with Kings Norton and other sub-manors, Rednal is listed as Weredeshale in the Domesday Book, a berewick of Bromsgrove belonging to the king. A 20th-century housing estate has reinstated the name of Wreodanhale into modern usage. The name was recorded as early as 849 and is mentioned in the Cofton Lease, one of the few surviving Anglo-Saxon charter documents in the West Midlands. The charter designated land around Cofton Hackett and Rednal to be leased by Bishop Ealhun of Worcester to King Berhtwulf in AD 849.

Running along the west side of Lickey Road, between Leach Green Lane and past Edgewood Road, is a medieval hedge estimated to be over 700 years old. The manor was sold by crown charter in 1682 to the Earl of Plymouth, who lived at nearby Tardebigge, and his descendants would own the lands at Rednal, Longbridge, Cofton Hackett and the Lickey Hills for the next 250 years.

In 1888, I the Birmingham Society for the Preservation of Open Spaces purchased Rednal Hill and handed it to the city in trust. It also arranged for Pinfield Wood and Bilberry Hill to be leased on a peppercorn (nominal) rent. Birmingham City Council finally purchased Cofton Hill, Lickey Warren and Pinfield Wood outright in 1920. With the eventual purchase of the Rose Hill Estate from the Cadbury family in 1923, free public access was finally restored to the entire hills.

An early provision for the small rural community was the Rednal Public Library built in 1909 by King&#x27;s Norton &amp; Northfield Urban District Council on Leach Green Lane. The site was donated by Edward Cadbury and George Cadbury Jnr, and the building costs met by philanthropist, Andrew Carnegie.

In 1917, the Austin Aero Company built an airfield right next to Rednal, just on the other side the Lickey Road and north east of Cofton Hackett Park. The airfield was used for flying aeroplanes out of the Cofton Hackett aircraft factory. Between 1939 and 1945, the factory produced mainly Hawker Hurricane fighters, Short Stirling four-engined bombers that were flown out over Rednal.

In 1924, the Birmingham tram system was extended along the central reservation of the Bristol Road South to the new Rednal Terminus, with a branch to Rubery. The new line drew thousands of visitors from the city and all over the Black Country to Rednal and the Lickeys at weekends and on bank holidays. There are records of crowds as far back as the Rose and Crown up Rose Hill on busy Sundays, as families queued for the trams to take them home. The trams were removed when the trams were replaced by buses in 1953, but the terminus turning circle and its extensive waiting shelter remained in situ until well into the 1960s, and it is believed that they continued to be used by the buses on bank holidays. The original tram station offices are now used as a Chinese restaurant. A small development of retirement homes and a carpark were built on the site of the terminus, but several short lengths of tramlines are still visible on front gardens and pathways.

In preparation for the Second World War, deep shelter tunnels were dug alongside Rednal in 1936 to accommodate up to 15,000 people. The main tunnels were under the South Works and were also driven under the Flying Ground through the sandstone towards the Cofton Hackett aircraft factory, a task undertaken by an army of mining engineers. The tunnels were large enough to admit 3-ton lorries. The tunnels under the South Works were intended to be used mainly ands air raids, but although some machine tools were installed, allowing work to continue. The tunnels under the airfield and the Cofton factory were designed for use during the assembling aero engines and even aircraft but they also contained a St John&#x27;s Ambulance Station, staffed by first-aid qualified factory workers. Used in later years for moving partially-completed cars around the site, the tunnels still exist under the demolished factories, and many photographs taken by &#x27;Subterranean Britain&#x27; explorers have surfaced on the Internet.

Major housing development in Rednal did not begin until after the war, with the construction of the Rednal Hall council estate, where over 600 houses added.

== Governance ==
=== Historical ===
During the medieval period Rednal formed part of the yields of nearby Kings Norton.

=== Westminster ===
For elections to the House of Commons, Rednal forms part of the Birmingham Northfield constituency.

=== Birmingham City Council ===
Rednal is part of Rubery and Rednal Ward and is represented on Birmingham City Council by Adrian Delaney of the Conservative party.

== Geography ==

The village nestles at the feet of the three hilltops geographically comprising The Lickeys – Rednal Hill, Bilberry Hill and Cofton Hill – are the summits of the Lickey Ridge, a formation of hard quartzite. Panoramic views over the city of Birmingham and surrounding countryside can be seen from the top of these hills.

The Lickey Hills area is of significant geological interest due to the range and age of the rocks. The stratigraphic sequence, which is the basis for the area&#x27;s diversity of landscape and habitat, comprises:

*Barnt Green rocks – Precambrian tuffs and volcanic grits
*Lickey Quartzite – a Cambrian quartzite
*Keele Clay – a Carboniferous clay
*Clent Breccia – a Permian breccia
*Bunter Pebble Beds – beds of Triassic water-worn pebbles

== Economy ==
With the demise of the Longbridge Motor Factory there is little in the way of major employment in the immediate area. Rednal barely existed prior to the factory, coming into being in its current form as a result of four events. Firstly the opening of the Austin motor works at Longbridge in 1905, secondly the extension of the area of the City of Birmingham to the northern boundary of Cofton Hackett in 1911. Thirdly the break-up of the Earl of Plymouth&#x27;s estate by auction in 1919, and lastly the extension of the Birmingham tramlines to the Rednal terminus in 1924.

These events had carried Rednal very rapidly from the rural age of the horse and cart to that of the motor car and bus, and from a community depending chiefly on farming to a delightful dormitory for people nearly all of whom now travel into central Birmingham to work. Most of the shops are in an area on the southern edge of the village that was administratively transferred from Kings Norton only in 1911.

The previous MG Rover site was purchased by St Modwen and discussions since 2006 have taken place between residents, county, district and parish councils, West Midlands Development Agency and central government officials on suitable development plans for the site. The 2008 downturn in the worldwide economy has slowed the progression of any new development. Situated where the Bristol Road meets Longbridge Lane, the Longbridge Technology Park was completed in late 2007; in 2008 one of the two buildings is occupied but the other is still vacant.

A major development aimed to improve the Longbridge ward was the Great Park development in Rubery by Corporate Land Developments Ltd. The site just off junction 4 on the M5 Motorway has been developed into a community with offices, houses, industrial units, Empire Cinemas, Hollywood Bowl, Premier Inn, Brewers Fayre, Morrisons, Gala Bingo, Greens Fitness and an area of public open space.

Rednal is also now the home of the NASUWT, the UK&#x27;s largest teachers&#x27; union. Their premises, which includes training rooms and accommodation, is at Hillscourt, close to the Lickey Hills footpaths.

== Education ==

=== Primary schools ===
Most primary aged children attend St. Columba&#x27;s Catholic Primary School, Rednal Hill Infant or Junior Schools, Colmers Farm Infant or Junior Schools or St. James Catholic Primary School. St Columba&#x27;s Catholic Primary School is a Catholic school with Christ&#x27;s teachings of love, peace and justice at the heart of all they do.

=== Secondary ===
Most older children attend either Colmers School or St Thomas Aquinas Catholic School, Kings Norton.

== Religious sites ==
The Anglican church of St Stephen&#x27;s on Edgewood Road was built to serve the community of Rednal and dedicated in 1951. It was granted its own parish from parts of Rubery parish in 1957. The original building was designed as both church and parish hall, however, a new church hall was constructed in 1961. The 450 pipe organ was moved from St John&#x27;s Methodist Church in Selly Oak in 1960 by a group of volunteers led by St Stephen&#x27;s organist G. A. W. Jeynes. The church has recently constructed a website to boost its outreach into the Rednal area, and also to encourage communication from the community to the church.

The Catholic church, Our Lady of Perpetual Succour, is on Leach Green Lane.

Longbridge Methodist Church is on Bristol Road South.

== Notable people ==
*John Henry, Cardinal Newman was buried in the small Roman Catholic cemetery at Rednal, by the Oratory country house. Father Ambrose St. John, his companion of 32 years, also buried at Rednal in the same grave.

* The scholar and author of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, J. R. R. Tolkien lived at Fern Cottage in Rednal at the age of 12, when his mother died there in 1904. The young Tolkien walked widely on the hills of the Lickeys with his brother and later recalled: Later in his youth he and his younger brother often stayed at &#x27;The Retreat&#x27; with Father Francis, a large retreat house with grounds in Rednal, maintained by the Birmingham Oratory on the rural edge of the city. 

*In his novel &quot;The Rotters&#x27; Club&quot;, author Jonathan Coe uses 1970s southwest Birmingham as a background, including scenes set in and around Rednal, and in particular in Cofton Park; and a major plot line takes place at the Longbridge Motor Works.

*Rick Price, guitarist in The Move and Wizzard, grew up in Rednal.

<doc id="844954" wikidata="Q1368052" url="?curid=844954" title="Westvleteren Brewery">
<text>Westvleteren () is a brewery founded in 1838 at the Trappist Abbey of Saint Sixtus in Vleteren, Belgium. The brewery brews three traditional Trappist beers in small quantities to support the operations and philanthropic causes of the abbey. The brewery is referred to by several names in Dutch and English, including Westvleteren Brewery and the Saint-Sixtus Abbey brewery.

== History ==
The Saint-Sixtus Abbey was founded in 1831 by Trappist monks from the abbey at Mont des Cats in France. Records show that a small volume of beer was brewed at the abbey in 1838 and in 1839 the abbey received a brewing license from King Leopold I. In 1850, a group of monks left Saint-Sixtus abbey and founded Scourmont Abbey, which also brews a Trappist beer under the brand name Chimay. 

The brewery continued to operate during both World Wars albeit at a reduced capacity. In World War I the abbey acted as a hospital for allied troops and in World War II the area was occupied by German forces. During this time it was the only Trappist brewery to retain its original copper brewing vessels, with materials requisitioned from other breweries by German occupation forces. Beer was only served to guests at the abbey until 1931, after which it beer was sold to the general public. 

Between 1946 and 1992, the St. Bernardus Brewery in Watou was granted a license to brew beer under the &quot;St. Sixtus&quot; name. Today, St. Bernardus brews beers of similar styles but under their brand name. In 1992, the brewery was modernised.

Brewing operations are carried out by the monks from the abbey, with a small team of secular workers for manual labour tasks. Of the 26 monks that reside at the abbey, five run the brewery, with an additional five who assist during bottling.

== Commercial orientations ==
As with other Trappist breweries, beer is brewed and sold to financially support the monastery and other philanthropic causes. Whilst the brewery is a business by definition (its purpose is to make money), it does not exist for pure profit motives and they do not advertise. The monks have repeatedly stated enough beer is brewed to run the monastery, and production volumes will not be increased to meet market demand. During World War II, the brewery stopped supplying wholesalers, and since then they only sell to individual buyers at the brewery and visitors&#x27; centre cafe. On the opening of the new brewery, the Father Abbott said &quot;We are not brewers. We are monks. We brew beer to be able to afford being monks.&quot;

== Beers ==

The brewery brews three beers:
* Westvleteren Blonde (green cap), a pale ale, 5.8% ABV, introduced on 10 June 1999.
* Westvleteren 8 (blue cap) (formerly &quot;Extra&quot;), a dubbel, 8% ABV.
* Westvleteren 12 (yellow cap) (formerly &quot;Abt&quot;), a quadrupel, 10.2% ABV, introduced in 1940.

Until 1999, the brewery also produced a 6.2% ABV dark beer and a lighter 4° which served as the monks&#x27; table beer, but these were replaced by the Blonde. The 8 and 12 are bottle conditioned and considered to have a long shelf life, with some drinkers preferring the taste when the beers have been stored for several years. The ingredients are yeast, hops, malt, candi sugar and water.

Historically the beers were identified only by the colour of the bottle cap. Labels were introduced in August 2022.

== Availability ==
Buyers were originally limited to ten 24-bottle crates of the beer per car, but as the beer increased in popularity, this was first reduced to five, then to three and now to two or one crates. For the Westvleteren 12 in 2009, it was limited to one case. When making an order now, the type and quantity of beer available for sale are revealed. Sales are limited to one order every 30 days per person per license plate and phone number. The beer must be reserved online through the abbey&#x27;s website, with registration weeks before the planned pick up date. The online system has replaced the &quot;beerphone&quot; in 2019. The monks do not sell beer to individuals who drive up to the abbey hoping to purchase beer. The reason for this is to eliminate commercial reselling, and hence give all visitors a chance to purchase the product.

The current production is 475 kilolitres (60,000 cases) per year, and has remained the same since 1946.

Aside from the brewery itself, the only other official sale point for the beer is the abbey-owned &quot;In de Vrede&quot;, a cafe and visitor&#x27;s centre opposite the abbey. All beers can be bought there for immediate consumption or take-away, depending on availability (however, prices are higher than at the abbey). Often there is no beer available at the shop. The shop also sells cheeses made at the abbey, yeast tabs (not yeast to make beer but dead yeast for health) and other Trappist products.

Buyers of the beer receive a receipt with &quot;Niet verder verkopen&quot; (&quot;Do not resell&quot;) printed on it. The abbey is very much against resale of their beer, and it is their wish that the beer be only commercially available at the two abbey-owned official sale points. Therefore, any Westvleteren beer offered for sale anywhere else in the world is a grey- or black market item, as there are no wholesalers in existence that supply the beer. The abbey is actively working to eliminate the illicit sales, and generally only agrees to media interviews to spread their message against drinking illicitly sold Westvleteren beer.

The brewery and the Belgian retailer Colruyt put a gift pack (6 bottles of Westvleteren 12, plus 2 glasses) on sale, available only in exchange for promotional coupons printed in selected media. The goal of the sales was to increase income to provide funds for urgent and immediate renovations at the monastery. Available from 2 November 2011, sales were limited to 93,000 packs, at 25 Euro per pack. All earnings of the sale were to be put towards the renovation project. This was the first time the brewery had done something like this.

On 4 November 2011 it was announced that 7760 gift packs (each containing 6 bottles of Westvleteren 12 and 2 glasses) would be imported by US-based Shelton Brothers, starting in April 2012. During a Shelton Brothers beer festival in June 2012, the gift packs were then made available to attendees at the price of $85. The original arrangement also listed Manneken-Brussels Imports Austin, Texas, as an additional distributor for the western states, but the Manneken-Brussels deal fell through in May 2012.

On 12 December 2012 gift packs were briefly made available in the US. As with the previous release, the gift packs contained 6 bottles of Westvleteren 12 and 2 decorated glasses. Distributed to selected locations across 22 states, they retailed at the regulated price of $84.99.

A six-pack (at CAD$76.85) was sold out on 12 December 2012 at various LCBO locations in Ontario.

== International reputation ==
Many beer drinkers rank Westvleteren 12 among their favourite beers. The 8 and the Blonde also rank highly on beer-rating websites.

In June 2005, when Westvleteren 12 was again highlighted as &quot;Best Beer in the World&quot;, news organizations followed this up and articles appeared in the international press, highlighting the beer ranking and the unusual business policies. In 2014 it was rated best beer in the world by Ratebeer.com.

Following these events, interest in Westvleteren&#x27;s output increased and stories appeared of the abbey&#x27;s stock being low, forcing the monks to reduce the amount of beer sold to each customer. In an interview, monk Mark Bode explained that the abbey had no intention of increasing its production, despite demand: &quot;We make the beer to live but we do not live for beer.&quot;

Despite the popularity, the monks of St Sixtus have continued to decline almost all interview and visit requests, and have not enjoyed all of the attention they have received. Non-monastic visitors to the abbey are usually turned away, instead being directed to the visitor&#x27;s centre opposite where there is information about the abbey and brewery. They have stated their desire to only produce as much beer as needed to finance the community.

<text>Quinton is a suburb and ward of Birmingham, in the county of the West Midlands, England, west of the city centre. Formerly part of Halesowen parish, Quinton became part of Birmingham in 1909. Quinton was a village and the surrounding area was farmland until the 1930s when the first housing estates were developed. Most of the farmland had been built on by 1980 but some countryside remains in the form of Woodgate Valley Country Park. Along with Bartley Green, Harborne and Edgbaston, Quinton is within the Birmingham Edgbaston constituency.

==History==

The name of Quinton is thought to derive from &quot;Cweningtun&quot;, meaning the queen&#x27;s settlement.

Quinton was formerly a chapelry in the ancient parish of Halesowen and was largely owned in medieval times by the wealthy abbey at Lapal near Halesowen. In the 1840s, when called &quot;The Quinton&quot;, mention was made of two small coal mines in the area and that the inhabitants were employed in nail manufacturing. It formed, with most of Halesowen parish, a detached part of Shropshire, until moving to Worcestershire in 1844. In 1866 Ridgacre became a separate civil parish, in 1894 the parish was renamed from &quot;Ridgacre&quot; to &quot;Quinton&quot;. On 1 April 1912 the parish was abolished and merged with Birmingham. In 1911 the parish had a population of 1120. Quinton developed along the turnpiked Kidderminster and Birmingham road.

Data from the 1881 census shows working in agriculture and the building trades to be the top two male occupations whereas for working women it was domestic service and nail making.

===Bourne College===
Prior to the construction of the M5 motorway, Quinton&#x27;s north western boundary extended over to the west. Where is now the Chantry Drive housing development there formerly stood the Primitive Methodist, Bourne College in its of grounds. The college, a boarding school for boys, was built in 1882 and named after one of the joint founders of Primitive Methodism, Hugh Bourne. Hoosen Close is named after the college&#x27;s only headmaster. The college closed in 1928 and the buildings were used from 1931 as a residential home for elderly men, known as Quinton Hall. The hall was demolished in 1978.

===Incorporation into Birmingham===
Quinton with its population of 1,100 and area of was incorporated into the county borough of Birmingham, in Warwickshire, on 9 November 1909. Quinton residents voted by 180 out of 224 to join with Birmingham rather than remain in Halesowen Rural District though it remained a parish until 1912. The main benefit for Quinton Parish Council was connection to an extended Birmingham drainage and sewerage network. For Birmingham Corporation the attraction was the prospect of developing farmland for housing. A tree was planted by Birmingham&#x27;s Lord Mayor in Quinton Recreation Ground to commemorate the centenary. Quinton became, with the rest of Birmingham, part of the metropolitan county of the West Midlands on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972.

===World wars===
Although a First World War Zeppelin flew over Quinton on 31 January 1916, its bombing target was Halesowen and no bombs were dropped on the parish. Quinton remained in character a village rather than a suburb until large-scale private housing development of the 1930s. Factory developments were not planned for the area because of objections by residents of Edgbaston to the possibility of fumes being blown over by the wind and so Quinton was not a prime bombing target for the German Luftwaffe. On 17 July 1941, all six crew of a Royal Air Force, World War Two, Armstrong Whitworth Whitley (Z6476) bomber died when their plane crashed in Quinton after striking a barrage balloon cable on a training flight from RAF Abingdon. The only fatalities from German bombs that fell on Quinton were a mother and son who perished on 18 October 1940 when a newsagents on Court Oak Road was hit. Three houses in Wolverhampton Road South were ruined and several more damaged in the same raid. Overall, Quinton was not greatly affected by bombing compared to some areas of Birmingham and the Black Country.

==Geography==
Quinton is covered by the B32 postal district.
The northern boundary of Quinton is the southern side of the A456/A458 Hagley Road West between Balden Road and the M5 motorway; the northern side is Brandhall in the Metropolitan Borough of Sandwell. The M5 forms the western boundary down to junction 3, and separates Quinton from the town of Halesowen in the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley. The Bourn Brook in Woodgate Valley Country Park is the southern boundary and divides Quinton from Woodgate, South Woodgate and Bartley Green. Balden Road, Tennal Lane and West Boulevard (B4121) form the eastern boundary, however, the ward boundary extends further east to Lordswood Road in the B17 postcode area of Harborne.

Quinton covers an area of though its boundaries have since expanded slightly. Eastern parts were formerly known as Ridgacre, with Quinton or &quot;The Quinton&quot; being the area now around the church.

Elevation

Quinton&#x27;s highest point is above sea level at the original village centre on High Street. The land drops away to the south and east to a low of at the Bourn Brook by West Boulevard.
The top of the spire of the (Church of England) Christ Church is the highest point of any building in Birmingham. The escarpment a little to the west forms part of the national watershed, dividing the catchment areas of the River Severn and the River Trent.

Housing

The area is almost entirely residential, though there are typical small local service businesses. An office park, accessed from the Quinton Expressway, has been built on part of Quinton Meadows. 

The original Quinton village in the area around Christ Church on Hagley Road West is of largely Victorian terraced houses. On the corner of Ridgacre Road West and High Street stands the Nailer&#x27;s Cottage, apparently 18th century, but whose lower walls may date back to the 16th century. It is the oldest dwelling in Quinton. The village spread south in the 1970s with the Chichester Drive housing development.

Much of the Ridgacre estate consists of medium-sized, private semi-detached houses from the 1930s and 1940s. Many of the roads are tree-lined. Construction of the estate was halted during World War II. In the 1950s, council houses typical of the period were built. Further council housing was built south of Quinton Road West along Simmons Drive in the 1970s, encroaching into the Woodgate Valley. Most of the housing is two storey terraces but there are some three storey townhouses all of which originally had integral garages. At the head of each of the V-shaped cul-de-sacs that project into Woodgate Valley is a four-storey block of flats.

Parks and open spaces

The northern part of Woodgate Valley Country Park down to the Bourn Brook lies in Quinton. Woodland and shrubs planted in the late 1980s predominate, but there are also some smaller areas of open meadow.

Quinton Meadows Local Nature Reserve comprises of grassland and woodland sandwiched between the M5 motorway and the A456 Quinton Expressway. Access from Woodgate Valley Country Park is via a pelican crossing on the Expressway. of the meadows were lost in the early 2000s following the construction of Quinton Business Park.

Quinton Recreation Ground next to the M5 is accessed from Meadow Road and Powell Avenue. Highfield Farm Recreation Ground has a children&#x27;s play area, multi-sports pitch and exercise equipment. There is car parking off Highfield Lane.

Transport infrastructure

The long A456 Quinton Expressway links Quinton to the M5 motorway at junction 3 via a short underpass. The A456 continues as Hagley Road West towards Birmingham city centre. The A458 to Halesowen via Mucklow Hill begins at the Quinton traffic island. A short section of the A4123, enters Quinton as Wolverhampton Road South and bears east along Court Oak Road towards Harborne. West Boulevard used to terminate at Quinton Road West but was extended in August 1986 across the Woodgate Valley and reclassified as the B4121.

No railway lines or canals pass through Quinton.

==Demography==
The 2021 Population Census recorded that 21,377 people were living in Quinton, down from 23,084 in 2001. 40% (8,548) of the ward&#x27;s population consisted of ethnic minorities (up from 14.5% in 2001), compared with 51.3% for Birmingham. 46.8% of the population of Quinton stated Christianity as their religion in 2021, down from 71.7% in 2001.

==Politics==
Quinton ward is currently represented on Birmingham City Council by Labour Co-op Councillors Sam Forsyth &amp; Lauren Rainbow.

The ward of Quinton forms part of Birmingham Edgbaston constituency along with Bartley Green, Edgbaston, Harborne and North Edgbaston, which has been represented by Labour Co-operative MP Preet Gill since 2017.

==Education and community facilities==
Quinton has one secondary school, Four Dwellings Academy and four primary schools; Quinton Church Primary, World&#x27;s End Junior, Woodhouse Primary Academy and Four Dwellings Primary Academy. Quinton Church Primary School&#x27;s roots go back to 1846, six years after the consecration of Christ Church. Pitts Wood, a small ancient woodland designated as a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation adjoins Woodhouse Primary Academy and is used by the school for environmental education.

Quinton Library on the corner of Overdale Road and Ridgacre Road opened on 2June 1974.

==Religious sites==
The Early English styled Christ Church is of red sandstone and was built at a cost of £2,500 in 1840. The &quot;Old Burial Ground&quot; at the end of the church drive, next to Quinton Church Primary School was opened in 1898. Half of the site was for members of the Church of England and half for other residents of the parish; each administered separately. In the 1950s the grounds became overgrown and by the 1980s were in effect closed. Since 2006 the area has been restored and maintained.

St Boniface, Church of England on Quinton Road West, consecrated in 1959, was designed by the architectural partnership of Bromilow, While &amp; Smeaton who also designed St John the Baptist&#x27;s Church, Longbridge. It is within the Diocese of Birmingham. The church building of brick has a clerestory with dormer windows as part of a steeply pitched roof. The gabled west front is surmounted by an octagonal, louvred, copper-roofed bell turret. The altar by architect, W H Bidlake came from St Stephen&#x27;s, Newtown Row.

Quinton Methodist Church on Ridgeway Avenue just over the border in Halesowen was built by William Jackson of Langley Green to a design by Selby Clewer and opened on 3 February 1968. The building replaced one on College Road opened in 1888 that was demolished to make way for the M5 motorway. Ridgacre Methodist Church on World&#x27;s End Lane opened in May 1951.

The Catholic parish of Our Lady of Fatima is part of the Archdiocese of Birmingham. The Parish Hall was built in Higgins Lane in 1952 and served as a dual purpose building for both church and social activities. The present church was built next to the hall, and was consecrated on 7October 1978 by His Grace, George Patrick Dwyer, Archbishop of Birmingham. Our Lady of Fatima Catholic Primary School is on Winchfield Drive, Harborne.

Quinton Evangelical Free Church on World&#x27;s End Lane and Ridgacre Road has served the local community since 1944. The Christadelphian Hall on Ridgacre Road dates from 1938.

<text>Shard End is an area of Birmingham, England. It is also a ward within the formal district of Hodge Hill. Shard End borders Castle Bromwich to the north and Kingshurst to the east which are situated in the northern part of the neighbouring Metropolitan Borough of Solihull.

==History==

===Pre-War===
Before the end of World War II, Shard End was completely rural and the only buildings were farmhouses, farm outbuildings and tithe cottages.

Shard End&#x27;s most infamous resident was Abraham Thornton, son of the owner of Shard End Farm (then part of the Coleshill estate). He was charged with the murder of a local girl, Mary Ashford, in 1817. The events of the trial led to the abolition of two ancient legal rights – the right of a close relative to demand another trial although the defendant had been acquitted, and the right of a defendant to defend himself by challenging the relative to a duel. The duel did not take place and Thornton left the area soon after his second trial to travel to the US.

During World War I, much of the woodland between Shard End and Kingshurst had been cut down to help with the war effort. The Birmingham and District Association of Boy Scouts were able to buy a patch of land at a bargain price and set up a permanent camp there. This land was halfway between Kingshurst and Shard End. It was called Yorkswood and opened in 1923. There were five camp fields, covering an area of . The total site was over . The site benefited from permanent washhouses and latrines, a swimming pool, a training centre and headquarters, guesthouse, warden&#x27;s hut and other huts. A small brook from a fresh water spring ran past the camp and Cock Sparrow Farm was about away to provide fresh milk. The entrance to the camp was flanked by a series of griffin statues. These had come from the roof of Lewis&#x27;s Department Store in Birmingham when it was being renovated. After the camp closed in 1972 they were placed upon the Yorkswood housing estate (Kendrick Avenue and nearby roads) in Shard End, built upon the site of the camp. Yorkswood takes its name from the nearby Yorks Wood, an eleven hectare forest dating back hundreds of years.
In the inter war years the Midland Sand and Gravel Company operated a mine on what is now the Norman Chamberlain Playing Fields, off Packington Avenue. During World War II, this gravel pit was used to store and repair third-line tanks. After the war the area was landscaped to become the playing fields. The old gravel pit was allowed to fill with water from a natural spring to form Shard End Lake and has become a leisure facility.

===The new estate===
A plan of the new housing estate was produced at the end of 1945 and compulsory purchase orders were issued in 1946. Building of the estate started in the late 1940s and was added to in stages producing some variety in the housing. As usual, communal facilities lagged behind the building of the housing. Nine tower blocks were constructed in the ward.

As a result of the construction of the estate, plans for a new church were drawn up. In 1954, construction of All Saints Church, a traditional Church of England church, began and construction was completed in 1955. Designed by F J Osbourne, it was the first new church to be built in Birmingham after World War II. On 1 November 1955, the Lord Bishop of Birmingham, Leonard Wilson, consecrated the church. This was followed by a visit by Queen Elizabeth II two days later. Nikolaus Pevsner, an architect and writer, disapproved of the building calling it &quot;a very ugly church&quot;.
Shard End Library opened in 1967 and was the first in Birmingham to use plastic membership cards instead of the traditional cardboard tickets. Some of the housing deteriorated in later years, but has improved as tenants have bought their homes.

===Development in the 1970s===
After the estate of the 1940s had been constructed, a large swathe of green land remained along the River Cole valley, this was called &#x27;The cow fields&#x27; and in the early 1950s local people - particularly at the &#x27;Bailey bridge&#x27; end of Shard End Crescent - would have cows grazing on the fields there. This rare open space in a city provided valuable recreation space for the new and young population of Shard End.

During the late 1970s, however, this tract of land was almost completely built upon and the area lost much of its charm. Since the building of this development, and a sharp decline in employment levels during the 1980s, Shard End has seen a marked increase in the problems typical of urban areas in large cities.

==Shard End 1990s==
All Saints Church (Anglican) is situated in Coneyford Road. It was opened by the Queen in 1955. It has the distinction of being the first Church of England church to be built and consecrated after the war, anywhere in the country. There is also a Methodist and a Baptist church.

Shard End has its own community Centre on Packington Avenue, on the opposite side of the road to the Police Station. At one time, this station had the largest meeting room in the police sub division. There is a shopping area, crown post office and surgery on Shard End Crescent. Cole Hall Farm was derelict for a number of years but has now been converted into a pub. There are four primary and two secondary schools.

The River Cole, a tributary of the River Tame, runs through Shard End, into Kingshurst. It forms the heart of the Kingfisher Country Park.

The local library hosts the Shard End Local History Group once every month.

In January 2005, work on replacing a derelict petrol station with a community centre began. The building is a result of a partnership between Birmingham City Council and GOWM. Thomas Vale Construction are building the community centre.

In January 2013, work was completed on All Saints Square aiming to improve a deprived area of the city, housing a new Library, Birmingham City Council office and Shard End Post Office, alongside a number of other businesses. The development includes a large onsite car park with local bus services running through the area.

The project included the construction of a number of new homes and apartments undertaken in partnership with Barratt Developments and Greswoulde construction.

75.6% of Shard End voters chose to Leave during the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. This was the highest of any ward in Birmingham.

==Demographics==
According to the 2001 Population Census there were 23,154 people living in Shard End with a population density of 3,817 people per km2 compared with 3,649 people per km2 for Birmingham. The area is not an ethnically diverse community with ethnic minorities representing 7.9% (1,820) of the ward&#x27;s population compared with 29.6% for Birmingham in general.

==Transport==
The area is served by Lea Hall railway station on the Coventry to Birmingham New Street line with occasional services to Walsall and Rugeley Trent Valley. It is served by the number 95 bus route.

==Notable people==
Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra grew up in a council house at 368 Shard End Crescent in Shard End. The lyrics to the ELO song &quot;All Over the World&quot; mention Shard End along with cities like London, Paris, Amsterdam, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo. Roger Taylor (drummer of Duran Duran) also lived at 350 Shard End Crescent until the age of 11 and attended Timberley Lane School. The author and artist Geoff Bunn also grew up in the area.

<text>WXKS (1200 AM) – branded Talk 1200 – is a commercial conservative talk radio station licensed to Newton, Massachusetts, serving the Greater Boston area. Owned by iHeartMedia, WXKS serves as the Boston affiliate for Fox News Radio, &quot;The Glenn Beck Program&quot;, &quot;The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show&quot;, &quot;The Sean Hannity Show&quot; and &quot;The Mark Levin Show&quot;; and the home of syndicated personalities Bill Handel, Ron Wilson, Gary Sullivan and Leo Laporte. The WXKS studios are located in the Boston suburb of Medford, while the station transmitter resides in Newton. Besides its main analog transmission, WXKS streams online via iHeartRadio.

==History==
===WKOX (AM)===
On April 21, 1947, the station signed on as WKOX, a daytime-only station on 1190 kHz in Framingham. WKOX would be paired with an FM adjunct, WKOX-FM (105.7), on February 10, 1960. Fairbanks Communications purchased WKOX and WKOX-FM in 1970. In 1985, WKOX switched frequencies to 1200 kHz and received authorization to broadcast around the clock. For many years, WKOX functioned as a full service station oriented towards the MetroWest region.

Following stints with satellite-fed oldies and talk radio, WKOX became a partial simulcast of its FM sister station, then known as country-formatted WCLB (105.7 FM), on March 1, 1993. The only deviation from this simulcast was morning drive, which continued to be programmed separately with a local talk show. That August, WKOX switched to ABC Radio/Satellite Music Network&#x27;s &quot;Real Country&quot; format, featuring classic country to complement the more contemporary country sound on WCLB; the local morning news-talk program was again retained.

Another attempt at talk, including a show hosted by former WEEI (590 AM) and WRKO host Gene Burns, was made on October 2, 1995. By this point, WKOX had begun to orient itself to the Boston market as a whole rather than MetroWest. WKOX&#x27;s talk format was largely replaced with brokered programming in October 1996, mostly consisting of ethnic and foreign language shows; by 1997, WKOX&#x27;s daytime schedule largely featured programming in creole and Spanish, with some talk programming remaining in other time periods. Notably, contemporary Christian music station WJLT (1060 AM) leased out WKOX&#x27;s overnight hours to extend its programming schedule, since WJLT was bound at the time to daytime-only operations; by 1999, the bulk of the station&#x27;s daytime programming was also religious in nature, in Spanish.

As early as 1995, WKOX pursued options to upgrade its power and serve the entire Boston area. The FCC approved plans to have the station change its city of license to Newton and move its transmitter site to a site also utilized by WUNR, where it would operate at 50,000 watts. Community opposition delayed this series of moves for nearly 13 years, and also significantly delayed attempts by Fairbanks Communications to divest WKOX. While Westinghouse Broadcasting and B-Mass Holding Company had expressed interest, by 1998, WKOX was the last remaining radio station in the Fairbanks portfolio. After Richard M. Fairbanks died in August 2000, WKOX was finally sold to Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) in early 2001.

The brokered format, by then primarily consisting of Spanish-language religious programming, was retained until 2004, when the station began simulcasting a progressive talk radio format with the original WXKS (1430 AM). Both stations switched to a Spanish tropical format, branded as &quot;Rumba&quot;, on December 21, 2006. WKOX completed the transmitter and city of license move to Newton in the fall of 2008, and began broadcasting at 50,000 watts full-time in April 2009. On September 4, WXKS (1430 AM) broke from the WKOX simulcast and flipped to a Spanish adult hits format, branded as &quot;Mia 1430&quot;.

=== WXKS (2010–present) ===

Clear Channel announced in January 2010 that WKOX would once again change to a talk format in April; the launch was stepped up to March 8 after WRKO dropped &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot; from its line-up. With this format change, WKOX changed call letters to WXKS (AM) on March 1; WXKS (1430 AM) concurrently changed its calls to WKOX. &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; was the first talk program to air on the station, moving from WRKO in February 2010, several weeks before the full format change. &quot;Rumba&quot; programming ceased on March 5, at which time the station began stunting. For the first year of the talk format, WXKS was branded as &quot;Rush Radio 1200&quot;, named for Limbaugh; similar branding was utilized at WRNO-FM in New Orleans, WRDU in Raleigh-Durham, and WPTI in Greensboro, North Carolina. Less than a year later, on February 28, 2011, WXKS re-branded itself as &quot;Talk 1200 Boston.&quot;
Local hosts Jeff Katz and Jay Severin were both dismissed from WXKS on August 6, 2012; Katz was reassigned to then-co-owned WRVA in Richmond, Virginia, while Severin joined TheBlaze Radio Network. That same day, both Rush Limbaugh and &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; returned to WRKO&#x27;s lineup. For the next four days, WXKS continued with the remainder of its syndicated programming before stunting with a 10-minute loop of political gaffes; this led into a format switch to comedy radio that August 13 as the Boston affiliate for 24/7 Comedy Radio. Branded &quot;Matty&#x27;s Comedy 1200&quot; in honor of WXKS-FM morning host Matt Siegel—who announced the launch on both his show and on WXKS—the comedy format began with a routine from Cambridge native Dane Cook.
On February 27, 2013, Clear Channel announced that WXKS would begin to carry Bloomberg Radio&#x27;s financial news and information programming as of March 1. The comedy format continued on the second HD Radio subchannel of WXKS-FM until December 2013. The simulcast of 1200 AM, which had previously been on 107.9-HD2, moved to the HD2 subchannel of WJMN, replacing old-school hip hop. In September 2013, WXKS began broadcasting Harvard University football, men&#x27;s hockey, and men&#x27;s basketball games. The broadcasts were produced by an independent packager who paid for the airtime.

Bloomberg L.P. announced on July 3, 2017, that the following day, Bloomberg Radio would move its programming to WRCA and its FM translator at 106.1 MHz. WXKS continued to simulcast the Bloomberg programming for several months.

After Bloomberg&#x27;s local marketing agreement with WXKS ended on March 1, 2018, the station took on the conservative talk programming that had been on WKOX, including Rush Limbaugh. WXKS also returned to the &quot;Talk 1200&quot; branding. WKOX returned to a tropical music format and was moved into a trust ownership, and would later eventually donated to Delmarva Educational Association.

The simulcast on WJMN&#x27;s HD2 channel ended in November 2018, when it was replaced with iHeartMedia&#x27;s &quot;Breeze&quot; soft adult contemporary programming. In September 2021, WXKS reappeared on the HD Radio dial, this time on the third sub-channel of sister station WZLX, replacing K-Love.

Initially, during its conservative talk format, WXKS carried some programming from Fox Sports Radio, including its morning show. On November 1, 2021, the station replaced Fox Sports Radio&#x27;s &quot;2 Pros and A Cup of Joe&quot; with a regionally-syndicated program hosted by Jim Polito, produced by Worcester sister station WTAG.

<text>The small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus) is a butterfly species belonging to the family Nymphalidae, classified within the subfamily Satyrinae (commonly known as &quot;the browns&quot;). It is the smallest butterfly in this subfamily. The small heath is diurnal and flies with a noticeable fluttering flight pattern near the ground. It rests with closed wings when not in flight. It is widespread in colonies throughout the grasslands of Eurasia and north-western Africa, preferring drier habitats than other &quot;Coenonympha&quot;, such as salt marshes, alpine meadows, wetlands, and grasslands near water (i.e. streams). However, habitat loss caused by human activities has led to a decline in populations in some locations.

The larval host plants are grasses, found in various habitats, while adult butterflies feed on nectar from flowers. The males of this species are territorial, which plays a large role in obtaining a female mate. To establish dominance, they partake in lekking, a mating display in which males aggregate in a competitive display to attract passing females.

== Taxonomy ==
The small heath is one of 40 species classified within the genus &quot;Coenonympha&quot; and placed in the family Nymphalidae. It belongs to the tribe Satyrini and its Coenonymphina subtribe. The small heath was first described in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish botanist and zoologist, in his book &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. Originally, the female &quot;C. pamphilus&quot; butterfly was referred to as the Golden Heath Eye and the male as the Selvedged Heath Eye. Entomologist Moses Harris later described it as the Small Heath or the Gatekeeper. However, the Gatekeeper now describes the &quot;Pyronia tithonus&quot;.

==Description in Seitz==
&quot;C. pamphilus.&quot; Small butterflies which on the upper side are the colour of reddish yellow sand. Forewing beneath reddish yellow, bordered with grey and bearing a small pupilled apical ocellus; hindwing diluted with grey, with a shortened, curved, whitish median band shaded with brown. The ocelli are generally completely absent or only indicated by faint and indistinct vestiges of dots or rings. — The ground-colour of the hindwing of the Northern form, &quot;pamphilus&quot; L. (= &quot;nephele&quot; Hbn., &quot;menaleas&quot; Poda, &quot;gardetta&quot; Loche) (48 g) is mouse grey beneath; it is the only form in the North, and extends throughout North and Central Europe to Anterior Asia, Turkestan, Ferghana and Persia. — In ab. &quot;bipupillata&quot; Cosm. the apical ocellus is greatly enlarged and doubly pupilled. — &quot;marginata&quot; Stgr. (48 g) has a very broad dark distal margin on all the wings, but its underside resembles that of &quot;lyllus.&quot; (A broadening of the blackish distal margin occurs in the summer brood in many localities.) — &quot;lyllus&quot; Esp. is the summer form from Southern Europe, North Africa and the southern part of Anterior Asia. In this form the wings are broader, the apex of the forewing is more rounded, the margin of the hindwing often undulating, the underside of the hindwing not mouse-grey but also sandy yellow with a fine, curved, median line. — In &quot;Thyrsides&quot; Stgr. (48 g), from Sicily-, Dalmatia and the southern portion of Anterior Asia, of which I also found typical specimens in the valleys of the Atlas, the hindwing on both sides bears a submarginal row of ocelli, which are sometimes pupilled. — Larva bright green with a thin, double, white dorsal stripe and yellow lateral one. Head pale green; throughout the summer on grasses. Pupa stout, green, with darker markings. The butterflies are the commonest Satyrids in the whole of Europe and are on the wing from the end of April until October, everywhere on meadows and fallow fields, cornfields and bare summits of hills. They almost fly only when disturbed, and soon settle again, affecting roads and bare patches of ground, sometimes inclining their always closed wings to one side. Their flight is jumping, slow, and low. They even fly into the towns, wandering over gardens and yards, and one sometimes sees them hopping along on paved streets for traffic, and settling for a moment on the pavement.

=== Similar species ===
The butterfly loosely resembles a small meadow brown, but the brown of the wings appears noticeably paler in flight. Unlike the meadow brown and other common members of the subfamily Satyrinae, the small heath is a lateral basker, only ever resting with its wings closed and angled at 90° to the sun. It more closely resembles &quot;Coenonympha caeca&quot; (forewing without apical spots), &quot;Coenonympha tullia&quot; (forewing apical spot smaller), and &quot;Coenonympha symphita&quot; (underside of hindwing without white spot and almost always with a complete row of spots on the forewing).

== Distribution and habitat ==

The small heath is spread throughout the Western Palearctic, particularly in Europe where it has been reported in at least 40 different countries since 2002. It is commonly found in the United Kingdom, largely in England and Wales. Populations are also found in southwest Siberia, regions of Asia, and north Africa.

As a grasslands species, the small heath prefers open habitats with shorter grass compared to other related species. It is also found in an extensive range of environments including meadows, heaths, mountains (in the subalpine zone), and alongside railways. It has been sighted in calcareous grasslands throughout nineteen countries in Europe. For mating and oviposition, small heath butterflies prefer territories that are close to vegetation over areas that are open and clear.

The small heath also resides in biodiverse patches of green habitats (i.e. greenways, gardens, and parks) in urban areas. These fragments create less-isolated corridors throughout cities, which help butterflies disperse throughout this habitat.

== Food resources ==

=== Caterpillars ===

The primary food resources for small heath larvae are different varieties of grass species. These include the &quot;Anthoxanthum odoratum&quot;, &quot;Poa pratensis&quot;, &quot;Agrostis stolonifera&quot;, and &quot;Festuca rubra&quot;, which commonly appear on some calcareous grasslands.

=== Adults ===

Adult small heath butterflies feed on floral nectar of a variety of flowers such as bramble, yarrow, and ragwort. This nectar has a high content of minerals and nutrients (particularly amino acids and sugar), and is highly important for male and female butterfly reproductive success.

== Parental care ==

=== Oviposition ===
The small heath is a plurivoltine butterfly, having multiple generations in a year. Oviposition varies throughout the lifespan of a female small heath. The rate of oviposition is high for young females, particularly at the beginning of their reproductive life, while older females eventually lay fewer and yellower eggs.

=== Host plant selection for egg laying ===
Small heath females prefer to lay eggs in grassland. They use a biological adhesive to lay its eggs directly onto host plants, plants near host plants, or wilting leaves. If the eggs are laid on or near host plants, the larvae are able to feed on the host plant. If attached to the dead grasses, they are forced to find their own food immediately after hatching.

== Life cycle ==
=== Eggs ===
Small heath eggs are round and sometimes laid on blades of grass. The eggs are occasionally in clusters, but usually alone. Initially, the egg is a light green with a slight depression on the top and an overall ridged texture. It later gains a white hue with a brown band wrapped around the middle and irregular brown speckles on the surface.

Egg color and weight changes throughout a female&#x27;s lifespan. Younger females initially tend to lay heavier, greener eggs at a higher frequency. These eggs then transition to an intermediate green-yellow color. After about 100 eggs are laid, or near the end of their lifespans, older females lay lighter, yellow eggs. Adult small heath butterflies have at least one or usually two broods of offspring depending on environmental factors (such as location and altitude).

=== Larvae ===
Butterflies like the small heath typically undergo multiple stages of development called instars, through which the insect grows noticeably larger in size. The small heath typically goes through four instars and molts three times. The third instar signals a diapause in which the larva hibernates. By the end of the fourth instar, the small heath larvae are a leafy green color with a green stripe running along its back and stripes a lighter shade of green on its sides. It has pink anal points, a protrusion at the end of the caterpillar. Larvae will sometimes undergo a fifth instar and enter diapause, which possibly signals an adapted response to environmental factors (primarily temperature). In diapause, the larva&#x27;s resources are used to reinforce and strengthen its already-existing larval adult structures. These larvae then develop into larger male and smaller female pupae.

=== Pupae ===
The small heath remains in the pupae stage for approximately 3 weeks. The color of the chrysalis fully develops in four days. The pupa is light yellow-green and suspends from a plant stem with the head facing downward. The cremaster is a series of hooks at the rear of the pupa, which allows it to hang from the stem. The pupae is thick and has a length of 8.5 mm. It is slightly curved with dark dorsal stripes around the sides and light-yellow bumps on the abdomen. The wing covers along the side are a white pigment with small accents of red-brown.

=== Adult ===
The wings of an adult small heath butterfly are light brown. Males are darker and sometimes have gray-brown hues, while females are paler and occasionally a white-brown or yellow-white color. Other variations include a redder or yellower pigment with the occasional purple-brown color. Both males and females can have a brownish-gray border circling the edge of the wing. This border varies in thickness and appears to be more common in males than in females. The forewing can have a prominent or faint dark spot or, sometimes, no spot at all near the wing tip. The hindwings may also have eyespots or white dots. A white band runs along the underside of the wing and varies in width and fullness. Female small heath butterflies have a wingspan of 37 mm and tend to be larger than males, which have a wingspan of 33 mm.

The small heath is diurnal, or is active in the daytime. It flies near the ground with a fluttering flight pattern. Small heaths are also lateral baskers, angling their bodies 90° to the sun with their wings closed when resting.

== Mating ==

=== Aggression between males ===
Male small heath butterflies often establish their own territories and become stationary. Males with their own territories are more likely to mate successfully with females. This prompts aggressive male behavior between stationary males and wandering males who may contest territory ownership. The stationary male sometimes engages the wandering male in an attempt to determine its sex, and these interactions remain short to reduce vulnerability to predation. Longer interactions between males are typically territorial disputes. Larger males are typically more successful in territorial disputes with other males, as they have longer wing spans and are superior in size and weight to smaller males. Thus, larger males have a significantly higher chance of successfully mating a female.

Temperature plays a role in male-male interactions as well. Both females and males increase vagrancy with increased temperatures, and vice versa. In low-temperature conditions, it is advantageous for a male to remain stationary in order to defend his territory as a potential mating site. This leads to longer male-male interactions when territorial disputes are more likely to occur. However, when temperatures are high, choosing not to defend territory is the preferred and advantageous strategy in mating. This is because males who become vagrant will have a higher chance of intercepting a wandering female in competition with other vagrant males. This leads to shorter male-male interactions as males are not defending territory.

=== Interactions between males and females ===
==== Mate choice ====
Male small heath butterflies find mates either by defending their ownership of a territory or by drifting in search for a female. Virgin females also spend time in the air to find a potential mate, but females who have already mated avoid claimed territories. Due to its longer lifespan, virgin females seek mates less urgently than, for example, females of the &quot;C. tullia&quot; species. Virgin small heaths females will allow males to pass by instead of seeking them out to begin courtship. They choose to perform a long, elaborate zig-zag flight pattern to draw attention after they reach a group of perching males, who will take part in lekking as a show of dominance. The female then selectively chooses her mate and begins a monandrous relationship. Most matings occur with residents within territories than with the wandering non-residents. Females often mate with males with larger wings, as territory owners are usually larger, and generally mate only once or twice in their short overall lifetimes.

==== Lekking ====
Male small heaths aggregate and form leks often around bushes or trees, creating an elaborate visual display to attract a female&#x27;s attention. The female will approach by circling the lek, which attracts the males&#x27; attention more than being stationary. There are both costs and benefits of lekking for the female. Females benefit by typically mating with the dominant male and producing offspring with beneficial, heritable genes, as a result of their free choice in mates. They also have increased survival and maintained health because males cannot force the females to copulate. A few fitness costs include lost time to obtain more resources, risk of mortality through predation, and less time for oviposition, which all lead to decreased fecundity. The leks themselves do not contain resources for the females.

==== Copulation ====
Copulation between male and female small heath butterflies lasts between 10 minutes and 5 hours, occurring at any time in the day. In 1985, a study observed that males often mate within their own territory (86.7% of 30 matings), and these copulations are generally lengthy, lasting over 100 minutes. Otherwise, copulations lasted approximately 10–30 minutes, especially for vagrant males. The study also found that either the male or female (but generally the male) is forced to leave the territory after copulation.

==== Nuptial gifts ====
During copulation, male small heath butterflies transfer a nuptial gift to a female in the form of a spermatophore, which contains both additional nutrients and sperm. Males can use amino acids found in nectar from food resources to help produce these spermatophores, which are then passed to the female when reproducing. The spermatophore increases female fitness and aids female performance in reproduction, and its nutrients are also assimilated later into the eggs that are laid, leading to heavier larvae.

== Thermoregulation ==

Small heath butterflies typically live well in dry, open landscapes with higher temperatures, in comparison to other species of satyrine butterflies. When temperatures are significantly high, lifespan is shortened but the small heath will fare better than shade-dwelling species, such as the speckled wood, &quot;Pararge aegeria&quot;. Like other butterflies, it has a small range of optimum temperatures and can regulate its temperatures in a small variety of ways, such as positioning its body to maximally absorb sunlight. In high temperature habitats, the small heath produces eggs at a relatively high rate, has good fecundity, and survives well as compared to woodland butterflies. Male butterflies will also tend to drift and be vagrant in their search for females rather than perch in their territories and wait, as they would do in optimum or sub-optimum temperatures.

== Threats ==

=== Parasitism ===
The &quot;Trogus lapidator&quot; (parasitic wasp) and other varieties of Ichneumoninae species will often parasitize Lepidoptera pupae as parasitoids. The parasite eventually emerges from the host pupae as an adult by slicing out a cap at the terminal end of the chrysalis and breaking through. In small heath pupae, staining can sometimes be seen around the cut site of the cap.

=== Interactions with humans ===
As a grassland species, the effects of intense, widespread agriculture is a concern for the welfare of the small heath. Grassland management through periodic ecological disturbances (i.e. mowing) is considered necessary to maintain &quot;semi-natural&quot; grasslands. Negative effects of mowing include the loss of biodiversity, the conversion of natural grasslands into agricultural fields, mortality, and loss of nectar resources. However, a study shows that such disturbances of these habitats may actually lead to an increase in the population of grassland butterflies including the small heath.

== Conservation ==
Overall, the small heath is generally common and abundant throughout its geographic distribution, particularly in Europe. Urban habitats have become a significant focus in the conservation of the small heath due to the widespread green fragments forming chains of ecological biodiversity. In a study of elevated atmospheric CO2 levels on development, it was determined that larval development time increased due to elevated CO2 levels, suggesting an effect of CO2 on larval performance. Additionally, it was found that food-plant preferences of larvae might also be affected, which could play a future evolutionary role, although this is an area that requires further research.

=== Status in the Netherlands ===
In the Netherlands, the distribution of the &quot;Coenonympha&quot; &quot;tullia&quot; is significantly reduced as a result of climate change. Also satyrine species of the genus &quot;Coenonympha&quot;, the &quot;C. hero&quot; and &quot;C. arcania&quot; have gone extinct. One study shows that the small heath has adapted well to climate change and will continue to survive because it can adapt biologically to altered environments. In response to these environmental changes (i.e. temperature), the small heath can overwinter in diapause, which promotes its survival through rapid development.

===Status in England===

The small heath, like its cousin the wall brown, has been in serious decline across much of southern England for reasons unclear, and was accordingly designated as a UK Biodiversity Action Plan Priority Species (research only) by DEFRA in 2007. These butterflies typically live in colonies, which have been negatively impacted by construction, human development, and general habitat loss in recent years. In 2007, the IUCN category status listed the small heath as near threatened.

<text>The Harriman Alaska expedition explored the coast of Alaska for two months from Seattle to Alaska and Siberia and back again in 1899. It was organized by wealthy railroad magnate Edward Harriman. Harriman brought with him an elite community of scientists, artists, photographers, and naturalists to explore and document the Alaskan coast.

==Genesis of the voyage==
Edward Harriman was one of the most powerful men in America and controlled several railroads. By early 1899, he was exhausted. His doctor told him that he needed a long vacation. Harriman went to Alaska to hunt Kodiak bears. Rather than go alone, he took a scientific community to explore and document the coast of Alaska.

He contacted Clinton Hart Merriam, the head of the Division of Economic Ornithology and Mammalogy at the United States Department of Agriculture, and one of the founders of the National Geographic Society. Harriman told Merriam that he would cover the expenses of scientists, artists, and other experts who would join the voyage. He asked Merriam to choose the scientific party.

Historians question why Harriman wanted to go to Alaska. Some think he was considering developing Alaskan resources. Some think he was considering building a railroad to the Alaskan territory. Some people at the time openly wondered if he was going to buy Alaska, or build a railroad bridge from Alaska to Siberia — a railroad around the world. Nothing seemed impossible for Edward H. Harriman.

Merriam held a flurry of meetings and sent many telegrams. He organized a broad range of experts: arctic experts, botanists, biologists and zoologists, geologists and geographers, artists, photographers, ornithologists and writers.

Harriman had the steamship SS &quot;George W. Elder&quot; refitted for the expedition. The remodeled ship featured lecture rooms, a library with over 500 volumes on Alaska, a stable for animals, taxidermy studios, and luxury rooms for the team. Some on the expedition referred to her as the &quot;George W. Roller&quot;, for its tendency to roll at sea, causing seasickness among the passengers.

Harriman also brought a medical team, a chaplain, hunters and packers, guides, and taxidermists. He brought his own family and his servants. Together, with the crew of the &quot;Elder&quot;, the total number of people on the ship was 126.
==Voyage==
By the end of May, the ship&#x27;s guests and passengers had all arrived in Seattle. Newspapers around the world ran front-page stories about the trip. The &quot;Elder&quot; left Seattle on 31 May 1899. Cheering crowds saw them off.

Their first stop was the Victoria Museum on Vancouver Island. They then traveled farther north to Lowe Inlet, where they stopped to explore and document the wildlife.

On 4 June, they stopped in Metlakatla, the European-style settlement that was created by Scottish missionary William Duncan for the Alaskan indigenous people. The scientists visited with Duncan in his home.

In the next two weeks the &quot;Elder&quot; stopped at several spots on Alaskan soil, including Skagway and Sitka. They saw the results, both positive and negative, of the Klondike Gold Rush. They continued to catalog plants, animals, and marine creatures, as well as geological and glacial formations. Harriman had brought a graphophonic recording machine, and used it to record a native Tlingit song.

By 25 June, they had reached Prince William Sound. They discovered an undocumented fjord in the northwest corner of the Sound. They named it &quot;Harriman Fjiord.&quot;

While the scientists had some control over where they stopped to explore, Harriman retained the final judgment. He was anxious to hunt a bear, and he decided to head toward Kodiak Island when he heard that there were bears there.

On 7 July, they reached Popof Island in the Shumagin Islands. Four of the scientists, Ritter, Saunders, Palache, and Kincaid (accompanied by guide Luther Kelly), decided to camp on Popof Island while the rest of the scientists continued on to Siberia. This allowed them to make much more detailed notes about the area, rather than quick notes on frequent stops along the way.

Edward Harriman’s wife wanted to put her feet on Siberian soil, so the &quot;Elder&quot; continued northward. By 11 July, the ship had put into Plover Bay in Siberia.

Harriman, by this time, was impatient and ready to get back to work. The &quot;Elder&quot; steamed southward, picking up the party on Popof Island. On 26 July, the &quot;Elder&quot; made one last stop, at an abandoned Tlingit village at Cape Fox. On July 30, the ship pulled into Seattle.

==Expedition publications==

Harriman paid for the creation of several sizable volumes of the discoveries of the expedition. When Harriman died in 1909, his wife provided additional funds to continue the publications. Merriam served as the editor, and spent twelve years working on the publications.
John Burroughs, a best-selling nature author, was the official scribe of the expedition. He wrote much of &quot;Volume I&quot;, an overview of the trip. &quot;Volumes VI&quot; and &quot;VII&quot;, which were to be written by Merriam and feature mammals, never appeared. Perhaps Merriam simply couldn’t find the time with his other duties. Subsequent volumes were written by other expedition scientists or authors hired by Merriam to finish the work. While they often mentioned the beauty and grandeur of the Alaskan coast, the publications were mostly highly technical and written for scientists.

The first volume was published in 1901, and they continued to be published during the next few years. The Smithsonian republished the entire series in 1910, and the volumes are now available as free downloads.
** Vol I: Narrative, Glaciers, Natives
** Vol II: History, Geography, Resources
** Vol III: Glaciers and Glaciation
** Vol IV: Geology and Paleontology
** Vol V: Cryptogamic Botany
** Vol VIII: Insects, Part 1
** Vol IX: Insects, Part 2
** Vol X: Crustaceans
** Vol XI: Nemerteans, Bryozoans
** Vol XII: Enchytraeids, Tubicolous Annelids
** Vol XIII: Land and Fresh Water Mollusks
** Vol XIV: Monograph of the Shallow-water Starfishes of the North Pacific Coast from the Arctic Ocean to California, Part 1. Text and Part 2. Plates

==Accomplishments==
The expedition claimed to have discovered some 600 species that were new to science, including 38 new fossil species. They charted the geographic distribution of many species. They discovered an unmapped fjord and named several glaciers. Gilbert’s work on glaciers represented new thinking in the field.

Another legacy of the trip was the career of Edward Curtis. On the trip, he developed a close friendship with George Grinnell, who was an expert on Native American culture. After the expedition, Grinnell invited Curtis with him on a trip to the Blackfeet Reservation in Montana. Curtis, moved by what was commonly believed to be a dying way of life, spent much of his career documenting Native American culture.

At first, John Muir found Harriman distasteful and his hunting barbaric. But, over the course of the trip and afterward, the two became friends. Years later, Muir recruited Harriman to help with governmental lobbying on National Park legislation. Muir gave the eulogy at Harriman’s funeral in 1909.

In many ways, the expedition was an intersection of 19th century science and 20th century science. It often represented the best of the new century’s science, but it also showed how scientists thought in the previous century.

They foreshadowed practices of 20th century science by being an interdisciplinary team. The wealth of disciplines represented on the voyage enabled them to work together to solve many pieces of the puzzle. They also discussed the potential loss of the wilderness and the indigenous peoples. They saw the remnants of the Yukon gold rush, and how self-serving treasure hunters were plundering the countryside and the dignity and viability of the indigenous cultures.

In many ways, they were firmly rooted in 19th century science. In the 19th century, the common way to write scientific articles was to create endlessly long descriptions of the physical characteristics of plants or animals. Most of the publications from the expedition followed this protocol. This approach to biology withered in the early 20th century.

Another example of 19th century thinking was their perspective on indigenous cultures. Their ethnocentric view regarded the indigenous people as savages. While the scientists remarked in horror that the indigenous cultures were disappearing, they simultaneously felt that adopting modern European-style technology, dress, and customs would be a helpful step for them.

The intersection of 19th and 20th century science was evident among different opinions of those on the expedition. Upon seeing the indigenous peoples involved in salmon fishing operations and canning factories, those on the &quot;Elder&quot; felt different things. Some saw the cannery operations as forced labor, akin to slavery. Other expedition members saw the cannery operations as efficient and effective.

===Cape Fox artifacts===

On July 26, 1899, the expedition landed in Cape Fox, at an abandoned Tlingit village. The village had been deserted for about five years, but many pieces of Tlingit artwork and totem poles remained there. Some members of the expedition (in protest of other members) removed some of the artifacts from the village. While this has been described by some as &quot;looting,&quot; it must be considered in the context of the times. Members of the expedition believed that the indigenous cultures of Alaska would soon be extinguished by the encroaching of modern civilization. Their desire was to save to museums what they believed would be the last remnants of the Tlingit artwork and culture. The expedition saw the artifacts as inanimate objects from a deserted village. To the Tlingit living nearby, the artifacts were a sacred part of their identity.

The Cape Fox artifacts were preserved in museums. In 2001, a group of scientists retraced the steps of the 1899 Harriman Expedition. The 2001 scientists and crew, including the great-great-granddaughter of Edward Harriman, returned a number of artifacts to the descendants of the original Cape Fox Tlingit residents.

<doc id="844977" wikidata="Q1289536" url="?curid=844977" title="Heavy Petting Zoo">
<text>Heavy Petting Zoo (known as Eating Lamb on the LP version) is the sixth studio album by the American punk rock band NOFX. It was released on January 31, 1996, through Epitaph Records. The record reached a position of No. 63 on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Albums chart, the first NOFX album to do so. In Austria, &quot;Heavy Petting Zoo&quot; peaked at No. 20, while the album achieved the No. 13 position in both Sweden and Finland.

==Music==
NOFX recorded the album in October 1995 with Ryan Greene at the Razor&#x27;s Edge studio, San Francisco, a garage described by the band as &quot;a total dive&quot;.

The music on &quot;Heavy Petting Zoo&quot; has been complimented as &quot;melodic&quot;, and the album has been favorably compared to the band&#x27;s 1991 &quot;Ribbed&quot; LP, but although tracks like &quot;Hobophobic (Scared of Bums)&quot; and &quot;Freedom Lika Shopping Cart&quot; have been lauded for their witty titles, they have also been criticized for being overly cynical.

The track &quot;August 8th&quot; makes reference to the death of Jerry Garcia. Songwriter Fat Mike commented that he wrote the song, &quot;cuz I fucking hate the Grateful Dead, but it turns out I had the date wrong. He really dies on August 9th. Whoops. I guess I&#x27;m lame.&quot;
According to Fat Mike, the first half of &quot;The Black And White&quot; is concerned with a repressed homosexual male living in &quot;Small Town, USA&quot;.

&quot;Liza&quot; revisits the lesbians Liza and Louise introduced on the 1992 album &quot;White Trash, Two Heebs and a Bean&quot;. The third song in the series, &quot;Louise&quot; is found on their eighth album &quot;Pump up the Valuum&quot;.

==Artwork==
There are two different cover images for the album, both illustrated by Mark deSalvo, a noted designer of punk album art. 
The artwork for the CD edition features a man fingering a sheep. The band&#x27;s name and album title are featured at the top of the cover. The vinyl edition&#x27;s artwork features the same man and sheep in a 69 position. The title &quot;Eating Lamb&quot; is given on the cover of the LP, with &quot;Heavy Petting Zoo&quot; written on the spine and record itself.

&quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot;, in their review of the album, described it as the band&#x27;s &quot;nastiest cover yet..&quot;,
and in their analysis of NOFX&#x27;s attitude, the authors of &quot;Screaming for Change: Articulating a Unifying Philosophy of Punk Rock&quot; state: &quot;..the fact that none of the songs on the record deal with animals, zoos, or even bestiality, supports the assertion that the artwork contains little, if any, significant meaning other than portraying images the band is confident will upset and shock the establishment.&quot;

To promote the album&#x27;s release, record label Epitaph sent out inflatable sheep with the message &quot;Fuck ewe&quot; attached.
The LP version was banned in Germany, due to its zoophilic content. A court order in October 1996 prohibited distribution of the record in Germany, and confiscated copies with the offending artwork that were already on public display.

The device is split into two main areas. At the beginning of the device is the metadata section, which consists of a root block, and a generic array of blocks that can be allocated to store metadata. The rest of the device is another contiguous generic array of blocks that can be allocated to store data. The metadata section usually uses a few percent of the device, depending on the size of the device.

The metadata is stored as a tree of single blocks in the metadata section. The entire directory structure is recorded in the metadata, so the data section purely contains data from files. The metadata describes the location of data in files with extents of blocks, which makes the metadata quite compact.

When a metadata update occurs, the system looks at the block containing the metadata to be changed, and copies it to a newly allocated block from the metadata section, with the change made, then it recursively changes the metadata in the block that points to that block in the same way. This way, eventually the root block needs to be changed, which causes the atomic metadata update.

The filesystem is reasonably good at keeping files unfragmented, although there is a defragmentation tool available which will work on an online filesystem.

It was the first filesystem to introduce the concept of the Recycle Bin natively at filesystem-level to the Amiga, holding the last few deleted files in a hidden directory on the disk root.

PFS version 5.3 was developed in C and a small portion of assembly code by Michiel Pelt.

<text>Sparkhill is an inner-city area of Birmingham, England, situated between Springfield, Hall Green and Sparkbrook.

Historically part of Worcestershire, Sparkhill once existed as a rural area with its main industry being agriculture until the 1880s.

==History==
===The Sparke family===
In the Middle Ages, the Sparke family farmed in the area, although it can be posited that Sparkhill takes its name from Spark Brook, a small stream that flows from Moseley to the River Cole in Small Heath. It was, as the name suggests, a hill that was situated alongside the stream. The watercourse can be traced almost entirely along its length from source to where it joins the River Tame, although most of its tributaries are now culverted, and is a popular route for leisure walkers and cyclists. The only part where it cannot easily be followed is a short tunnel where it passes under the Grand Union Canal, very close to the old BSA motorcycle factory near Golden Hillock Road. Most of the route is accessible through Ackers Trust artificial ski slope and sports centre, which was built on BSA&#x27;s old test track. This part of the route is still used for off-road cycling and similar pursuits.
===The Cherry Arbour===
As a result of the Industrial Revolution which was causing Birmingham to expand, development of the area began. In the 1850s, a small area of land was bought by a building society and sold to separate developers who built houses for the working class. People who owned a property were entitled to vote and a campaigner for the working class vote was Joseph Sturge, a Birmingham manufacturer. As a result of his campaigning, a newly created street in the area was named after him. The architecture of the houses was varied due to the different developers. A centre began to develop for the area with its own pub, &quot;The Cherry Arbour&quot;.

In the late 1860s, developments appeared all over Sparkhill with the creation of long, straight streets forming a uniform pattern. The new houses were terraced with their own back garden, coal shed and lavatory. For the wealthy middle class, larger houses were built in a plot bounded by Stoney Lane, Alfred Road and Durham Road.

===Annexation by Birmingham ===
Sparkhill was removed from Yardley and annexed by Birmingham in 1911 as part of the &quot;Greater Birmingham Act&quot;. Yardley also became a suburb of Birmingham in the same year. The former council house for Yardley District Council (built 1898–1902, architect Arthur Harrison) was converted into Sparkhill Library () and opened on 19 January 1923. It is one of the earliest examples of double-glazed windows in a public building. Other buildings built for the district were a police station, magistrate&#x27;s court and a fire station, which were all located next to the council house. St John&#x27;s Church is the local Anglican Parish Church and the home of the charity Narthex Sparkhill. Designed by the famous Birmingham Architects Martin and Chamberlain, the church was built in 1888. A reredos in memory of Louisa Ryland was erected in the church after her death.
===World War II===
As a result of the nearby BSA factory being targeted, the area suffered from bombing in World War II, resulting in the loss of some houses, and their 1940s replacement (e.g. the houses at 180–190 Osborne Road). A memorial to those from the BSA works who died during the Second World War can be found in St John&#x27;s Church.
===Public houses===
Another old landmark in Sparkhill is the &quot;Mermaid Inn&quot;, which has been the site of a pub since the 17th century. The building was converted into a Balti restaurant in the late 20th century; however, it was severely damaged by numerous fires in the 2000s decade. The building&#x27;s art deco exterior decoration is by local sculptor William Bloye.


Other pubs, the Bear and The Antelope, both designed by Holland W. Hobbiss, have sculpted pub signs by William Bloye. The Antelope was, in 2010, converted into a Pakistani restaurant known as &quot;Hajees Spice&quot;.

==Immigration==
In the 20th century, the area became heavily influenced by migrants who settled in the area. The first wave of immigrants were of Irish descent. This has progressed to include Afro-Caribbeans, South Asians, and more recently Somalis. Moreover, in the last decade, migrants of Romanian descent have begun to settle in the area, mostly inhabiting terraced houses. It has a large population of ethnic minorities, mainly of South Asian origin, which is reflected by the number of Asian eateries in the area. As a result, Sparkhill has become a main centre in the &quot;Balti Triangle&quot; of Birmingham.

The first series was broadcast from August 2012 with a new series each year; currently up to series 5 in 2016.

<doc id="844984" wikidata="Q1132964" url="?curid=844984" title="Ring name">
<text>A ring name is a type of stage name or nickname used by an athlete such as a professional wrestler, mixed martial artist, or boxer whose real name is considered unattractive, dull, difficult to pronounce or spell, amusing for the wrong reasons, or projecting the wrong image. Since the advent of the Internet, it is relatively easy to discover a fighter&#x27;s real name.

==Professional wrestling==
Ring names are much more common in professional wrestling than any other sport; famous examples include Terry Bollea becoming Hulk Hogan, Michael Shawn Hickenbottom becoming Shawn Michaels, Roderick Toombs becoming Roddy Piper, Dwayne Johnson becoming The Rock, Christopher Irvine becoming Chris Jericho, and Phillip Jack Brooks becoming CM Punk. A number of wrestlers adopted their real name or a variation of it, sometimes modifying the spelling to better fit their gimmick, such as Dave Bautista becoming Batista (later reverting to his real name for his Hollywood acting career), Patricia Stratigeas becoming Trish Stratus, Jonathan Good becoming Jon Moxley, Bryan Danielson becoming Daniel Bryan (when he wrestled in WWE), Richard Fliehr becoming Ric Flair and Randall Poffo becoming Randy Savage. Others simply use part of their name, such as Bill Goldberg using Goldberg, Nicole Garcia-Colace using Nikki Bella, Mike Mizanin using The Miz, Cody Runnels using Cody Rhodes, and Michael Wardlow using Wardlow. Many female wrestlers go solely by their first name such as. It is also common for wrestlers of all genders to use a nickname in addition to their real name for marketability and other reasons. Ricky Steamboat is an atypical instance of a wrestler adopting a ring name to sound less intimidating, as his legal name of Richard Blood was considered unfitting for his babyface persona.

Some (mostly independent) wrestlers still go to great lengths to ensure that their real names are not publicly known. It is a highly respected tradition in Mexican lucha libre for performers to hide their true identities, usually wrestling under masks, and revealing a luchador&#x27;s identity without their permission is considered a serious offence with real-life consequences. Professional wrestlers are often referred to by their contemporaries by their ring name. In interviews, Bret Hart regularly referred to Mark Calaway, Curt Hennig, and Kevin Nash by their ring names (The Undertaker, Mr. Perfect, and Diesel). Ring names are often trademarked by the promotion that creates a character or gimmick for a performer. It is common to see one performer use a variety of ring names throughout their career, even if their overall persona remains similar.

This is especially true in WWE, which has largely forced most wrestlers that have debuted since 2006 to use a WWE-owned ring name instead of a ring name that they used on the independent circuit or, such as with Daniel Bryan and a few others, their real name. One notable exception was made for David Otunga because of his real marriage to singer Jennifer Hudson at the time, which gave WWE some mainstream exposure.

Low Ki used the alias &quot;Senshi&quot; during his second TNA stint to reserve his primary ring name for other use. A similar example is the team known as The Dudley Boyz in ECW and WWE and Team 3D elsewhere. WWE trademarked the &quot;Dudley Boyz&quot; name, leading them to have to change their name when they went to TNA. The members&#x27; individual names were also trademarked by WWE, forcing them to have to change their names. WWE partially repealed the policy in 2015, allowing wrestlers who were well known in other promotions such as Samoa Joe, A.J. Styles, Shinsuke Nakamura, Austin Aries, Bobby Roode, and Eric Young to use their long-standing ring names (or, in Nakamura&#x27;s and Roode&#x27;s cases, their real names) as well as wrestlers who sign &quot;Tier 2&quot; NXT brand contracts such as Johnny Gargano and Tommaso Ciampa, who wrestle both on NXT and the independent circuit to keep their ring names (or, in Gargano&#x27;s case, his real name). Gargano and Ciampa have since signed exclusive WWE contracts. &quot;In-house&quot; WWE wrestlers still use WWE-owned ring names.

In rare cases, the rights to a wrestler&#x27;s ring name may be owned by a company with little or no connection to professional wrestling, such as Marvel Comics&#x27; ownership of the name Hulk Hogan until early 2003, which was due to Hogan being advertised as &quot;The Incredible Hulk Hogan&quot; early in his career, while Marvel owned the trademark for their comic book character. Sometimes, a wrestler will buy the rights to their own ring name; for example, Steve Borden owns the rights to the name Sting and licenses it to the musician of the same name. The wrestler formerly known as Test took this one step further and legally changed his name to &quot;Andrew Test Martin&quot;. Jim Hellwig, known as The Ultimate Warrior, had his name legally changed to simply &quot;Warrior&quot;.

In many cases, ring names evolve over time as the wrestler&#x27;s gimmick changes, either subtly or dramatically. After debuting in WWE as the &quot;Connecticut Blueblood&quot; Hunter Hearst Helmsley, Paul Levesque&#x27;s character later morphed into Triple H. A more drastic change sometimes occurs when a wrestler turns heroic or villainous, such as when Hulk Hogan joined the villainous nWo (New World Order) and became &quot;Hollywood&quot; Hulk Hogan. His new attitude was enhanced by changing his costume color scheme from his famous red and yellow to nWo&#x27;s black and white. Steve Williams adopted the ring name Steve Austin to avoid confusion with the then-more established performer &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams. Austin would wrestle under that name for several years before signing with the WWF and being given the name &quot;the Ringmaster&quot;. This gimmick failed to catch on, and Austin reverted to his established name, reaching his greatest level of success with the prefix &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin.

==Boxing==
Numerous boxers have used ring names or nicknames as their mode of identification during their professional boxing careers, particularly during the late 19th century and the early 20th century. The ring name &quot;Kid&quot; was particularly popular, indicating the boxer&#x27;s comparative youth. Since the mid 20th century, ring names for boxers have typically been less common, although nicknames have become more popular in recent years. Famous examples of boxers who used ring names include:

*Kid Azteca
*Kid Chocolate
*Kid Diamond
*Kid Gavilan
*Kid Meza
*Kid Paret
*Jack Kid Berg
*Ted Kid Lewis
*Jersey Joe Walcott
*Joey Giardello
*Rocky Marciano
*Rocky Graziano
*Takaloo
*Steve Hearon

==Global use==

* In Japan, sumo wrestlers use a ring name called &quot;shikona&quot; (). Other martial artists use &#x27;martial names&#x27; or &#x27;warrior names&#x27; called Bugō.
* In Mexico, Puerto Rico, and other parts of Latin America, lucha libre wrestlers use ring names and conceal their identities with masks.
* In Latin America, boxers often use nicknames alongside their real names, and both may be used each time they are introduced. Examples include Wilfred &quot;El Radar&quot; Benítez, Wilfredo &quot;Bazooka&quot; Gómez, and Alexis &quot;El Flaco Explosivo&quot; Argüello.
* In Thailand, both professional boxers and Muay Thai kickboxers tend to use their stable or gym name as the last part of their ring name, for example Khaosai Galaxy, Khaokor Galaxy, Sot Chitalada, Samart Payakaroon, Kongtoranee Payakaroon, Namphon Nongkee Pahuyuth, Namkabuan Nongkee Pahuyuth, Ratanapol Sor Vorapin, Ratanachai Sor Vorapin, Saen Sor Ploenchit, Chatchai Singwangcha, Saman Sorjaturong, Veeraphol Nakornlouang Promotion, Nawaphon Nakornloung Promotion. Also the names of commercial brands have been introduced as fighters&#x27; last name, as part of sponsorship deals. These names are liable to change if the brand sponsoring the fighter changes. Examples of fighters who have taken the name of their commercial sponsor are: Samson Dutch Boy Gym, Yodsanan 3-K Battery, Poonsawat Kratingdaenggym, Teerachai Kratingdaenggym, Knockout CP Freshmart.

<text>Stechford is an area of East Birmingham, England, situated about five miles east of the city centre, bordering Ward End, Yardley, Hodge Hill and Kitts Green. Historically it lay within Worcestershire.

==History==
Stechford&#x27;s history is unclear. Its oldest components are Station Road (known as Stoney Lane since Norman times) and Flaxleye Farm, first referenced in 1218. The farm itself no longer remains, however there is a farmhouse at 143 Flaxley Road, although the oldest parts of the current building cannot be older than the 17th century. The closest buildings of historical importance are St Edburgh&#x27;s church and Blakesley Hall, both a stone&#x27;s throw outside Stechford in Yardley. The name Stechford is apparently a reference to the Stich or Stitch, a local tributary of the River Cole, although the Stitch is now entirely under culverts. A ford over the Cole is first referenced in 1249. The name Stechford was unknown until the construction of Stechford Station in 1844, and it has been conjectured that it was simply a railway misspelling. The name Stycheforde is attested since 1400. The common misspelling Stetchford is not an acceptable variant.

Old Stechford appears to have been mainly a cluster of buildings around the railway station. Until 1900, most of the area was still farmland. Some station houses are still present and remain along the main road. However, development on this area was considered difficult due to the steep gradient of the land nearby which can clearly be seen. This resulted in buildings built on the slope having to have stilts located underneath the ground floor. In some buildings, these are clearly visible.

For most of the 20th century Stechford was its own parliamentary constituency, represented by Roy Jenkins, Labour for 27 years from 1950, although it has been alleged in parliament that he never lived there. When Jenkins stepped down to become a European Commissioner in 1977, the seat was won by Conservative Andrew MacKay, and Jenkins&#x27;s future partners, the Liberal Party were leapfrogged by the British National Front, whose candidate Andrew Brons obtained third place. The National Front and its successor British National Party have continued to target the area. In 1983, the Stechford constituency was broken up into Birmingham Hodge Hill and Birmingham Yardley.

The first UK branch of German discount supermarket Aldi opened in 1990.

==Politics==
Stechford is part of the Stechford and Yardley North Ward of the Yardley Constituency. As of 2005, the councillors are Neil Eustace, Carol Jones and Barbara Jackson, and the MP is Labour MP Jess Phillips . Until 2005, the constituency was held by Estelle Morris (Labour), who was Secretary of State for Education in Tony Blair&#x27;s Labour administration. From 1950 to 1977, the area was represented in the Stechford constituency by Roy Jenkins, (as a Labour MP), who was one of the biggest figures in British politics between the 1960s and 1980s. The ward councillors work closely with an advisory board of local people, which has led to the creation of a playground area next to the Cascades, the provision of security gates on many access alleys, and improvements to street lighting.

Politician Enoch Powell was born at Flaxley Lane, Stechford, in 1912. He moved to Kings Norton in 1918 and would later go on to be a classical scholar, poet, youngest Brigadier in the British Army when he fought in the Second World War, and politician. He is best known for his Rivers of Blood speech in 1968.

==Attractions==

Stechford has a long-standing row of shops along Station Road, with a lesser group of shops on Albert Road. Main shopping centres are connected by the Outer Ring Road (A4040) and Outer Circle bus. Nearby shopping areas are the Fox &amp; Goose in Ward End and The Yew Tree in Yardley. Links to Birmingham are provided by bus services 14 (Audley Road) and 97 (Bordesley Green East).

The local railway station is Stechford railway station. On 28 February 1967, Stechford station was the scene of a train collision which killed nine people and injured 16. Opposite the station is The Stechford Club which was founded in 1907. Houses in the area are mainly council houses or old Victorian houses built around the station.

==Churches==
Stechford has three churches. Stechford Baptist, on Victoria Road, All Saints (Anglican) on Albert Road, and Corpus Christi (Catholic) on Albert Road. The churches hold an annual Remembrance Day service at the Five Ways War Memorial on Remembrance Sunday, early November, which is attended by about 200 people.

==Geography==
The district is cut across by the River Cole, the Birmingham to London railway, and the Birmingham Outer Circle (A4040).

All of the land around the Cole is flood plain, which means that Stechford has a wide swathe of green, semi-wild vegetation. It is still possible to canoe from Stechford to Water Orton. The Cole and the green area around it, are being restored through the Kingfisher Project.

The project also takes in Stechford Fairground, which is home to two funfairs each year. The area around the River Cole is now green belt land which prevents developers from constructing on the site.

==Healthcare==
*National Health Service care is provided by Birmingham East and North Primary Care Trust
*Heartlands Hospital is a major local employer

<doc id="844987" wikidata="Q3318182" url="?curid=844987" title="Moderator of the United Church of Canada">
<text>The Moderator of the United Church of Canada is the most senior elected official within the United Church of Canada. He or she may be a lay person or a member of the Order of Ministry and is elected to a three-year term by commissioners attending the church&#x27;s triannual General Council. The current Moderator is Carmen Lansdowne, who was elected to the office at the 44th General Council in July 2022, and installed on August 7, 2022.

== Role ==
The Moderator&#x27;s authority exists by his or her ability to influence the direction of the denomination, rather than any sort of direct power to unilaterally enact changes. Duties of the Moderator include:
* giving leadership (&quot;especially in spiritual things, quickening in the hearts of the people a sense of God as revealed in Christ, and heartening and strengthening the whole United Church&quot;)
* visiting pastoral charges across the country, &quot;giving sympathetic guidance and counsel giving sympathetic guidance and counsel, and reporting to the General Council and its executive&quot;.
* being the primary spokesperson and representative for the United Church
* presiding at the meetings of the United Church&#x27;s highest court, the triannual General Council, and chairing meetings of the General Council&#x27;s Executive and Sub-Executive.

== History of the office ==
When the United Church of Canada was founded in 1925, General Councils were biennial, giving each moderator a two-year term of office. (The first exception was the first moderator, George C. Pidgeon, who only served for one year. The second was the 43rd moderator, Richard Bott, who had his term extended to four years when the 44th General Council was postponed by one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.) At the 1994 General Council, the commissioners voted to make General Councils triennial, thus increasing the moderator&#x27;s term to three years. 

Although most moderators have been ordained ministers, this is not a requirement of office, and to date, four moderators have been lay persons. If the moderator is ordained, he or she is styled the &quot;Right Reverend&quot; while in office, and the &quot;Very Reverend&quot; afterwards.

<doc id="844992" wikidata="Q7617538" url="?curid=844992" title="Stirchley, Birmingham">
<text>Stirchley is a suburb in south-west Birmingham, England. The name likely refers to a pasture for cattle. The settlement dates back to at least 1658. Prehistoric evidence, Roman roads, and Anglo-Saxon charters contribute to its history. The Worcester and Birmingham Canal and the railways brought industry to the area. Stirchley&#x27;s development is also linked to industries like screw-making and rubber manufacturing. Originally part of Worcestershire, Stirchley underwent administrative changes in 1911. Residential developments were established alongside the long-standing Victorian terracing which is associated with the suburb.

The River Rea, which flows through the area and once powered mills at Lifford, Hazelwell, Dogpool and Moor Green, is now a walking and cycle route. The restored former Stirchley Baths community hub opened in 2016.

==Political==
In 2018, Stirchley separated from the Bournville Ward to become a ward in its own right. It is represented by Councillor Mary Locke of the Labour Party. Stirchley is in the Parliamentary Constituency of Birmingham Selly Oak, represented by Alistair Carns of the Labour Party.

Until the Local Provisional Order Bill came into effect on 9 November 1911, the area was administered by the King’s Norton and Northfield Urban District Council in the East Worcestershire (UK Parliament constituency) represented by Austen Chamberlain. The event, known as the Greater Birmingham Act, required the ancient county boundaries of Staffordshire, Worcestershire and Warwickshire to be changed. The former county boundary was the Bourn Brook which separates Edgbaston (Warwickshire), from Selly Oak (Worcestershire). Slightly more than 22,000 acres of Worcestershire was transferred to Warwickshire in the extension of the administrative area of Birmingham, and this has grown further with the creation of New Frankley. Nearly 50% of modern Birmingham was formerly in Worcestershire or Staffordshire. The Evolution of Worcestershire county boundaries since 1844 is complex as a number of enclaves and exclaves were adjusted. Documentary references need to be researched under the county of origin. An editorial note in the VCH Warwickshire Volume 7 Birmingham refers to the special difficulties created by the change of the county boundaries and states that: &quot;Accounts of the ancient parishes of King’s Norton, Northfield, and Yardley, and the parish of Quinton (in the ancient parish of Halesowen), now within the boundaries of the city, are contained in Volume III of the History of Worcestershire.&quot;

==Toponymy==
Lock considers the reference to Stercan Lei in the 730 Cartularium Saxonicum applies to Stirchley. A stirk or Styrk is Old English for heifer, and therefore the name signifies the clearing or pasture for cattle. This has been adopted as the meaning of Stirchley in Shropshire.

The earliest known reference of a settlement at Stirchley is a deed dated 6 May 1658, where it is described as an &quot;Indenture between Katherine Compton and Daniel Greves and others concerning a tenement and lands at Stretley Streete in the Parish of King’s Norton&quot;. In his research of the history of the building called Selly Manor, Demidowicz identified it to be a Yeoman’s house before becoming cottages called the Rookery. He also identified the site of the medieval settlement of Barnbrook’s End. This is connected to Barnbrook Hall, frequently referred to as Bournbrook Hall, which is confusing because of another property of the same name in Bournbrook. Demidowicz accessed a 1602 map that showed that Stretley Brook was the boundary between the ancient parishes of Northfield and King’s Norton. The brook was later known as Gallows Brook, Griffins Brook, and, after the Cadbury Brothers established their Cocoa Company it became ‘The Bourn’. It is likely that Gallows Brook was the former name of Wood Brook, which flows from Northfield, as in 1783 Thomas Wardle, was sentenced to be executed and his body hung in Chains on the further Part of Bromsgrove Lickey, near Northfield. Three others also received death sentences.

In a map published in 1789, James Sheriff names the place as Stutley, while one of 1796 names Sturchley. However, Chinn suggests that an 18th-century map maker mis-read the ‘ee’ and replaced it with a ‘u’.

In 1863, Strutley Street branch national school was opened to accommodate 132 pupils. It replaced a former school suggesting there was an established population in the area before this date. Hazelwell Street was shown as Strutley Street on the plans for the sale of land to be developed in conjunction with straightening the Pershore Road.

==History==
===Prehistoric===
Evidence of human activity during the Bronze Age is provided by the presence of mounds of heat-shattered and fissured pebbles in charcoal referred to as ‘burnt mounds’. Such mounds have been identified along the River Rea in Wychall Lane, at Ten Acres, and at Moseley Bog. No settlement associated with this period has been found.
Prehistoric settlements or farmsteads are difficult to find in built-up areas, however, there is a possibility of occupation at Cotteridge. Chinn suggests that the name Cotteridge means Cotta’s Ridge, and there is a clear ridge running up from Breedon Hill. The Tithe Map records a feature of Near and Far Motts, now beneath the housing development at Foxes Meadow suggesting the possibility of an ancient Celtic settlement, hill-fort, or look-out site at the top of the ridge which runs through Northfield to Dudley. Alternatively, it may be the medieval Vill of Northfield’s Sub-Manor of Middleton as the site was possibly included on the auctioneer&#x27;s plan for the sale of the Estate of Middleton Hall.

Hutton commented that &quot;In the parish of King’s Norton, south west of Birmingham is ‘The Moats’, upon which long resided the ancient family of Field. The numerous buildings, which almost formed a village, are totally erased and barley grows where the beer was drank.&quot; This location would have provided an excellent panoramic view of the south of the Birmingham Plateau. The ancient pre-urban landscape was not dissimilar to that of Bredon Hill near Evesham. Both ‘Bre’ (Celtic) and ‘don’ (Old English) mean hill. Demidowicz has identified that the Rea was formerly called the Cole, a derivative of the Welsh Celtic word ‘colle’ meaning Hazel. In a map of the locations mentioned in an Anglo-Saxon Charter the site where the Rea crosses Dogpool Lane was referred to in 1495 as Collebrugge and in 1496 as Colebruge.

===Roman===
The Roman Road Icknield Street, or Ryknield Street, connected Alcester with Metchley Fort. Evidence of this road at Walkers Heath Road, Broadmeadow Lane, Lifford Lane, and Stirchley Street suggests a route along a terrace that avoided medieval King’s Norton Green and Cotteridge. There is a reference to Selly Cross which may be where Icknield Street converged with the Upper Saltway now the Bristol Road (A38). The Roman Road may have followed a more ancient packhorse route with salt as the most obvious commodity to be transported. From Metchley Fort the road went north through the Streetly Valley in Sutton Park where there is a watercourse called the Bourne Brook Continuing northwards, Icknield Street crossed Watling Street (A5) near Letocetum, the Roman site at Wall, close to Hammerwich where the Staffordshire Hoard was found. Barrow suggests that another road, the Hadyn Way ran in a southerly direction from the Ryknield Street near Bournbrook through Stirchley Street and Alauna (Alcester) to join the Fosse Way near Bourton-on-the-Water. Peter Leather indicates that Dogpool Lane may have been a minor Roman route from the Alcester Road to Metchley Fort via Warwards Lane and Selly Park Recreation Ground where a significant archaeological survey was undertaken.

Until recently, the place name of Stirchley was accompanied by ‘Street’. Gelling suggests that major place-names like Strete or Streetly refer to the position of the settlement on or close to one of the main roads of Roman Britain. It is possible that the name Street is a corruption of the OE Stroet which has been interpreted as a &quot;Roman road, a paved road, an urban road, a street&quot;. The 1838 Tithe Map for King’s Norton Parish in the County of Worcestershire identifies the place, rather than the road name, as Stirchley Street. Other Place names associated with Roman occupation are Street Farm Northfield where the road from Wootton Wawen met the Bromsgrove Road, and Moor Street Bartley Green.

===Anglo-Saxon===
Stirchley was in the ancient parish of King’s Norton. King’s Norton had two Anglo-Saxon boundary charters: Hellerelege (AD 699-709) which was a grant by Offa, King of Mercia, and Cofton (AD 849) in which Bishop Ealhun of Worcester has leased the 20 hide estate to King Berhtwulf. Plotting these boundaries has proved difficult as many of the names have changed.
The boundaries of King’s Norton parish and the manor were coterminous and stretched from Balsall Heath in the north to Wythall in the south, from Rednal in the west to Solihull Lodge in the east. Beating the bounds took four days to complete. The population was scattered but small hamlets and later sub-manors were formed. For administration purposes the parish was divided into five yields or taxable divisions. Lea yield, which was probably focused on the area of Leys Farm in Stirchley, was consumed by the Moseley and Moundesley yields around the time of the Tithe Commutation Act 1836 and is not shown with the Tithe Map and Apportionments.

Domesday Book indicates that Bromsgrove was a significant manor with eighteen outliers or berewicks. Some these manors are now part of the Anglo-Saxon presence in Greater Birmingham: Moseley, King’s Norton, Lindsworth, Tessall, Rednal, Wychall, and possibly Lea. There are ongoing arguments as to the location of Lea. Monkhouse considered the reference to belong to the Stirchley area of Leys Farm while F and C Thorn identified it as Lea Green near Houndsfield and Wythwood. Leys Farm was not mentioned on the 1832 OS map although there is the possibility of a building on the site. A considerable period of time has elapsed since those discussions and it seems valid that the debate should be resumed now that so much more information is available.

At the time of the Domesday survey in 1086, Birmingham was a manor in Warwickshire with less than 3,000 acres whereas the current Birmingham Metropolitan Borough is closer to 66,219 acres (26,798 ha). Birmingham developed in the hinterland of three counties – Warwickshire, Staffordshire, and Worcestershire and nearly 50% of modern Birmingham has Domesday Book manors that were formerly in either Staffordshire, or Worcestershire, As the city expanded the ancient Shire boundaries were changed in order that the area being administered came under one county authority – Warwickshire. To establish the Saxon presence in the territory of modern Birmingham all the former Manors and Berewicks/Outliers mentioned in Domesday Book that are now within the boundaries of the city, need to be combined. This is complicated by the fact that separate figures were not given for Harborne (Staffordshire), Yardley and King’s Norton (Worcestershire) which were all attached to manors outside the area. The Birmingham Plateau had about 26 Domesday Book manors, a population of close to 2,000, with seven mills, and three priests.

Other Worcestershire manors mentioned in Domesday Book are: Yardley; Selly Oak and its outlier Bartley Green; Northfield; Frankley (New Frankley); and Halesowen (Quinton). Harborne (Staffordshire) was owned by the Bishop of Lichfield. Selly Oak was leased to Wulfwin, who owned Birmingham as a freeman, by the Bishop of Lichfield. &quot;Leases meant services to the bishop, and in this way he ensured the cultivated of the lands he retained in his own hands, as well as those which he let out, and had a large force ready at hand in case of war or tumult.&quot; These services could have been called upon during the raids by the Danes. The nun-cupative (oral) will is a unique inclusion and suggests that the Bishop had a particular reason for not wishing to lose the territory of Selly Oak which meets Stirchley north of the Bourn and west of the River Rea.

The Domesday Book manors of both King’s Norton and Selly Oak were in pre-Conquest Came Hundred which later became Halfshire Hundred. A Hundred was an administrative division of a Shire (County). Some Tithe maps field names near Moor Green called Big Hundred (3260), Little Hundred (3257), Upper Hundred (2759), Lower Hundred (2760), plus Hundreds Meadow (3261), hint that there was once a hundred meeting place there in Anglo-Saxon times. The site is near to the Dogpool Lane Bridge over the Rea, which might once have been a ford as the stream runs wide and shallow at that point. Such a spot was favoured for early meeting places. Just west of the River Rea is the Selly Wick Estate. The ‘wick’ may be a loan from the Latin vicus, a civilian settlement associated with a Roman fort or it may belong to a variety of meanings including salt-working centre or a dairy farm. This estate joins the Selly Hall Estate and as ‘sel’ or &#x27;cel&#x27; may derive from the Anglo-Saxon for house, hall, or storage building it is possible that an earlier structure may lie beneath what is now the Convent of the Sisters of Charity of St Paul the Apostle. Near Selly Wick House and once part of the Selly Hall Estate are the remains of a medieval moat and fishponds.

===Mills===
Lifford Mill and pool lie on the south side of Tunnel Lane where it crosses the eastern of the two branches of the Rea at Lifford. It may have been the Dobbs Mill shown in the area in 1787–9. The pool and the reservoir below the mill were formed when the Worcester and Birmingham Canal was constructed in the early 19th century. In 1830 the mill was described as a ‘rolling mill of 15 horse power upon a never-failing stream. In 1841 Joseph Davies left it together with Harborne Mill to his son Samuel. In 1873 and 1890 it was occupied by india-rubber manufacturers. By 1900 it had become part of the works of J &amp; E Sturge, chemical manufacturers. The mill building is now derelict, but both it and Lifford House form part of the premises of J &amp; E Sturge, Ltd.

Hazelwell Mill and pool lie on the east of the Rea immediately above Hazelwell Fordrough. The three water corn mills in Hazelwell manor in 1704 were probably at this mill, and the mill was similarly described when in the tenure of Thomas Hadley in 1733. Edward Jordan, who took over the mill from John White in 1756, was, like the Hadley’s, a gunsmith. The mill was, however, being used for corn milling, stones in the rye mill and the wheat mill being mentioned in the lease. The three water corn mills were again mentioned in 1776 and in 1787, but by the early 19th century the mill had been converted to metal working. In 1843 and 1863 it was in the tenure of William Deakin and Sons, sword-cutlers, gun-barrel and bayonet manufacturers, and in the 1870s of William Millward and Sons, sword-cutlers, gun and pistol-barrel makers. It was a gun-barrel works in 1886, but by the 1900s had become a rubber factory.

Dogpool Mill with its pool lies to the west of the Rea just below the point where Griffin’s Brook joins the Rea. It was mentioned as Dog Poo’ Mill in 1800 and was a rolling mill in 1836. The tenant in 1843 was John Phipson and in 1863 Tomlinson and Co., tube- and wire-manufacturers. By 1875 the mill had been taken over by C Clifford and Sons, metal-rollers and tube-makers.

Moor Green, or Farmons Mill and its pool, lay on the east of the Rea just above the point where Holders Lane reaches the river. The mill, called a blade mill, was already in existence when the Moore family acquired it from John Middlemore, together with the manor, in 1597. It was held by the Moore family until 1783 when it was sold by John Moore to James Taylor. The Serjeant family held the lease of the mill from Moore and Taylor between 1780 and 1841, and William Serjeant greatly improved the mill, then still a blade mill, between 1816 and 1841. In 1841 his widow surrendered the lease to James Taylor and the freehold was sold to Charles Umpage, metal-roller. William Betts and Co., metal-rollers, occupied the mill in the 1860s and 70s. It was still in use as a rolling mill in the 1880s but seems to have fallen into disuse shortly after, and only a part of the wheel channel still remains.

Sherborne Mill, also known as the Kings Norton Paper Mill, was built by James Baldwin &amp; Sons Ltd, paper makers of Birmingham, in the 1850s. The mill produced brown papers for wrapping, grocery papers, paper bags and gun wadding. The mill became an independent business in 1926 which was dissolved in 1967. The buildings were converted to hold the Patrick Collection of vintage cars. It is now called the Lakeside Centre and Lombard Rooms. An artificial pond, created to provide water for the paper-making process, still exists on site. James Baldwin was Mayor of Birmingham in 1853–54. The Baldwin family lived nearby at Breedon House, now the site of the Cotteridge school.

===Farms===
Using the modern road names to identify the location: Lea House Farm was near Lea House Road; Two Gates Farm was by the junction of Sycamore Road and Willows Road; Barnbrook Farm was by the cross-roads of Linden Road and Bournville Lane; Row Heath Farm was at the junction of Franklin Road and Oak Tree Lane, and Barnbrook Hall Farm later became the recreation ground for female staff at Cadbury’s; Fordhouse Farm was half way up Fordhouse Lane near The Worthings; Bullies Farm was located on Cartland Road, close to the junction with Pineapple Road; Pineapple Farm was at the bottom of Vicarage Road, just across the railway lines from Hazelwell Hall; Dawberry Farm stood near Dawberry Fields Road and Harton Way.

===Estates and high status residences===
Breedon House: The 1840 Tithe Map shows that John Lane Snow owned Breedon House on the estate of which is now Cotteridge Primary School. The house and estate was occupied by the Baldwin family, papermakers (whose principal mill was off Lifford Lane), between c.1860 and c.1895. The Old Cross Inn was sold c. 1900 and the owner moved to larger premises on the other side of the canal to enable the expansion of the screw factory. Stirchley Village starts at the foot of Breedon Hill.

==Transport and communications==
===Pershore Road (A441)===
King’s Norton village was connected to Birmingham by a minor rural track until it reached the road from Alcester to Balsall Heath which was turnpiked in 1767. There was no Pershore Road until the Birmingham and Pershore Turnpike Road Act 1825 (6 Geo. 4. c. cxlii) authorised the construction of the Pershore . This new road from Birmingham to Redditch began near Smithfield Market and headed south through Edgbaston Parish (Warwickshire) to Pebble Mill where the Bourn Brook marks the former county boundary. It continued through Northfield Parish (Worcestershire) past Moor Green to Ten Acres, where it crossed the watercourse of the Bourn into King’s Norton Parish. This particular section of the road does not appear on either the first series OS Map or the 1839 tithe maps. A surveyors plan for the sale of Dogpool Mill on 15 July 1847 names the stretch of road from the Bourn to Dogpool Lane as ‘New Street’ and the continuation of this to Birmingham as ‘New Pershore Road’. The new road created a one way system as it appears that a small hamlet had formed at the junction of Bournville Lane and Hazelwell Street. The Pershore Road joined the old Roman Road as far as Breedon Cross and went straight up the hill to Cotteridge which was probably little more than a farmstead. It went down the hill towards the manorial mill and up to King’s Norton village. The new road that bypassed King&#x27;s Norton Green was not authorised until 1834 although the section to West Heath had been constructed in 1827.

Public transport was by horse-drawn bus operated by City of Birmingham Tramways Co. The building that became Halford Coach Trimmers was once the stable for the horses that pulled the horse-drawn tram. Its concrete floor had drainage grooves set into it. Under the powers of 1901 the King’s Norton and Northfield UDC constructed a tramway along the Pershore Road, and a short connecting line along Pebble Mill Road was constructed to link the Bristol Road section with the new line. As the Bristol and Pershore Roads were so closely related, arrangements were made for CBT to work the new line on behalf of the two councils until the lease of the Bristol Road section expired in 1911. CBT cars began working to Breedon Cross on 29 May 1904, and through to Cotteridge on 23 June 1904. The addition of another 40 cars became necessary when it was realised that many of the 30 cars operated by CBT on the Selly Oak and King’s Norton routes were in such poor condition that they could not be counted upon for regular service when due for acquisition in July 1911.

In 1911, Birmingham Corporation Tramways took over the operation. At the beginning of World War I the Pershore Road line had been doubled between Pebble Mill Road and Cotteridge. At Ten Acres where, because of the narrowness of the road, a single track with a passing loop was retained. The single track in Pebble Mill Road was doubled and placed on the central reservation between dual carriageways, the first use of this layout in Birmingham. World War I brought difficulties to all undertakings and Tramways were no exception. Buses were impressed for military use, staff shortages became acute giving rise to the appearance of conductresses, costs rose and supplies of all kinds became difficult to obtain. The upper saloon bulkheads were replaced by half-glazed partitions enclosing new quarter-turn staircases, at the head of which doors were provided. The suggestion of saloon handrails on these partitions was suggested initially by a regular passenger, R A Howlett, who lived in Stirchley. The scope of his proposed scheme was enlarged and handrails were provided for the whole length of the partitions.
The eight cars stationed at either the Bournbrook or Cotteridge depots were painted in the chocolate and cream livery when taken over in July 1911. Wartime grey livery was applied to some cars with them being repainted in the standard livery when next overhauled between July 1945 and April 1946. The line closed in 1952 and the depot was demolished and replaced with Beaumont Park Sheltered Housing.

===Canals===
After protracted arguments on 10 June 1791 the Worcester and Birmingham Canal Bill received the Royal Assent. It involved the expertise of civil engineers in the construction of tunnels, cuttings and embankments with aqueducts over roads, rivers and streams. An early wooden accommodation draw-bridge at Leay House Farm, located where Mary Vale Road now crosses the canal, was replaced by a brick bridge in 1810. The route of the canal didn’t respect farm and estate boundaries: &quot;Unfortunately this work meant the destruction of growing wheat on the land of Mr Guest of Barnbrook, and he was promised compensation for his crops, as were other farmers similarly affected on the line of the canal as the work proceeded.&quot; The labourers, who had travelled to the area, were housed in barracks possibly large wooden huts that could be moved to other sites as the work progressed. Food, beer and other domestic needs were serviced by the local community, who also provided skilled work as carpenters, blacksmiths, and brickmakers. The canal was completed in 1815 although sections had been opened when completed and had enabled a route from Dudley to London. The Lapal, or Dudley 2, connection from Netherton to Selly Oak had been opened on 28 May 1798. The Stratford-upon-Avon Canal joined the Worcester and Birmingham canal near King’s Norton village and was fully opened in 1816. An unusual guillotine lock was installed to control the difference in height of the water. This is now a scheduled ancient monument. Wharves were built to offload supplies of coal and lime which were then distributed by horse-drawn carts.

===Railways===
In 1828 powers were obtained to build a railway or tramway (sic) from Bristol to Gloucester and in 1836 another Act authorised the route from Gloucester to Birmingham. This line was opened on 17 December 1840 with a terminus at Camp Hill and on 17 August 1841 trains commenced running into the London and Birmingham Terminus at Curzon Street. Lifford has had three stations. The first Lifford railway station opened 1840–1844; The Birmingham West Suburban Railway opened the second station on its line which closed in 1885. The third station was on the Camp Hill line and closed in 1941. The station at King’s Norton (Cotteridge) opened in 1849. Another station that served Stirchley was Hazelwell at the top of what would become Cartland Road.

Construction of the Birmingham West Suburban Line began in 1872. This required expanding the canal embankment. A section of the canal had to be drained to complete the work scheduled to last for a week. The canal was to be re-watered through a valve in the southern stop-gate but someone opened the gate and water from as far as Tardibigge rushed towards Birmingham &quot;like a great tidal wave&quot; resulting in a breach of the canal in Edgbaston and causing damage to a number of canal boats. The water spent itself in Charlotte Road where the culverts carried away an immense quantity. It was a major event for the emergency services and the navvies, and witnessed by a multitude of people who turned up to witness the devastation. The railway opened on 3 April 1876 with a station at Stirchley Street (now Bournville). By this time the Midland Railway Company had taken over the Birmingham West Suburban Railway and in 1881 obtained an act for doubling the track and creating a direct route to King’s Norton that avoided the Lifford Loop.

Midland Railway Company Engine Shed
The opening of Lifford curve in July 1892 allowed for a more intensive local service. New sidings were opened at Cadbury’s and Selly Oak in 1885 and by 1892 Selly Oak was handling over 55,000 tons of goods traffic and Lifford over 17,000 tons. The Midland Railway Company identified an available site near Stirchley Street which was bordered by the Birmingham West Suburban main line, Cotteridge Park, Breedon Road, and Mary Vale Road. Land was purchased from the Trustees of the late J Hock. The engine roundhouse was built by Messrs. Garlick and Horton at a cost of £11,546 and Eastwood Swingler gained the contract for a 50’ turntable. Construction began in 1893 and the shed opened on 12 March 1894. Although named Bournville Engine Shed it was unrelated to Bournville Model Village. The shed was significant during World War I and drivers and firemen were classified as being in a Reserved occupation. The lighter Engines required for the Dowery Dell viaduct operated from Lifford taking empty wagons on the outward journey and returning with loads, usually steel tubes and coil, manufactured in the Halesowen area. The arrival of diesel driven units and the 1950s rationalisation of the railway programme meant the end of the shed. It closed on 2 February 1960. It became the new ‘Parkside’ distribution centre for Cadbury’s. By 1971 Cadbury’s had switched from rail to road transport so the depot became surplus to requirements and was demolished and replaced with a housing estate.

==Industry==
Guest, Keen, and Nettlefold Ltd: 
James and Son constructed a screw making factory at Breedon Cross in 1861-2. In 1864 William Avery joined the firm and the company name changed to James, Son, and Avery. Joseph Chamberlain (senior) gave financial support to his brother-in-law, John Sutton Nettlefold, to secure at a cost of £30,000, the English rights to an American screw making machine. In 1866 Nettlefold and Chamberlain moved into the factory at Breedon Cross. The company was managed by the sons of the owners, Joseph Chamberlain and Joseph Henry Nettlefold. Joseph Chamberlain left the company in 1874 to concentrate on politics. In 1880 the company was incorporated as Nettlefolds Ltd, the various firms incorporated were those of Messrs Nettlefold’s, at Heath Street, and Princip-Street, Birmingham, and at King’s Norton. and later, in 1902, became part of Guest, Keen, and Nettlefold (GKN).

Boxfoldia: in 1924 Boxfoldia moved to the Ten Acre Works. They manufactured cartons for well-known companies such as Colman&#x27;s, Reckitt Benckiser, and the Dunlop Rubber Company. The founder, Charles Henry Foyle, believed that business was a partnership between employer and employee, and set up a Works Council. By 1933 these works had become too small and Boxfoldia moved to Dale Road, in Bournbrook From 1934 the site was then taken over by Cox, Wilcox &amp; Co who were manufacturers of domestic Hardware. Ten Acre Mews, a small housing development now occupies the site.

Capon Heaton: Hazelwell Mill was established in the late 17th century to grind corn for the sub-manor of Hazelwell in Kings Norton. In about the mid-18th century it was converted to the boring and grinding of gun barrels. By 1904 the earlier watermill had been demolished. Edward Capon and Harry Heaton entered into a partnership in 1883. As Capon-Heaton and Company they manufactured India-rubber at Lifford until the mid-1890s when the firm moved to Hazelwell, the next mill downstream where they continued until acquired in 1964 by Avon India Rubber Co. In 1978-9, The Stirchley Industrial Estate was built over the original mill and mill pool site.

Eccles Caravans: In 1913 A J Riley and his son built his first recreational vehicle by putting a caravan body onto a Talbot car chassis. After World War I ended the Riley’s decided to invest in a motor haulage company that was having difficulty. It was called the Eccles Motor Transport Company. By the late 1920s the factory had outgrown its premises and moved to a 4-acre site in Hazelwell Lane, Stirchley, where a modern, single story factory was built. Believed to be the first purpose built caravan factory of its kind in the World it was fitted with the latest high tech woodwork machinery. It was here that &#x27;overrun brake systems&#x27; were invented and these are still fitted on caravans produced today. During World War II orders for caravans virtually stopped however the Eccles factory survived by adapting to the war situation. Commissioned by the British Military Authorities the Eccles factory still produced caravan bodies but these were used as portable workshops and radio offices. The factory also built ambulances and search light vehicles. By 1960 Bill Riley had retired, shutdown the factory and sold it to Sprite Caravans who moved production to their factory in Newmarket.

The Hampton Works Company in Twyning Road, was a manufacturer of custom precision pressings. The building was designed by Bradley and Clark of Temple Row, Birmingham in 1934. It was extended c.1939 by the same architects and air raid shelters were built at the same time to the west of the existing factory buildings. It is a listed building now occupied by Rivfast Ltd. The buildings are of plum-coloured brick laid in Flemish bond with decorative bands of brown brick dressings and partially glazed pitched roofs and metal-framed windows. The decorative motifs are in an Art Deco style.

Jesse Hill Gunmakers, Ash Tree Road, is a family business that began in 1921. The building is listed.

R J Hunt &amp; Sons: The iron foundry was acquired by J Brockhouse and Co in 1937 and continued to trade as Brockhouse Hunt. They produced cast iron products from scrap and other metal using sand from Bromsgrove. The site is now derelict and will potentially become a small housing estate.

Rubberplas BSP Ltd, Mary Vale Road, manufactures Rubber Moulding, Thermoplastic Moulding &amp; Vacuum Metallizing for automotive and domestic industries. It also launched the Golf Grass Mat used to install permanent or temporary walkways around Golf Courses.

Edwin Showell and Sons: Showell and Barnes were founded in 1790, in Loveday Street. By 1820 they were trading as Edwin Showell and Sons, manufacturing door springs and architectural brassware. After Edwin died his two sons, Charles and Edwin Alfred ran the company. The move to the Stirchley Brass Foundry in Charlotte Road took place in c1902. The property included an attractive Elizabethan red brick farmhouse, called Ivy House or Nine Elms into which Charles Showell moved. The factory gradually expanded to include the whole site and the farmhouse, which had fallen into disrepair, was demolished. During World War I they produced 100,000 Enfield oilers for Birmingham Small Arms Company rifles. In 1956 they were taken over by Josiah Parkes and Sons.

==Community==
===Stirchley Neighbourhood Forum ===
Stirchley Neighbourhood Forum represents all residents of Stirchley. The forum holds a monthly open meeting attended by police and the local councillor.

===Ten Acres and Stirchley Street Co-operative Society (TASCOS)===
This co-operative society was formed by a group of traders who met in Ten Acres School (now Darris Road). The front room and cellar of a house at 112 Hazelwell Street was rented, trading stock was bought, and on 25 June 1875 the first shop was opened. The success was such that bigger premises were necessary and in 1893 the Stirchley Street Central Premises was opened. Adjoining shops and cottages were acquired and the Central Premises was extended. The Drapery and Footwear Departments were trading in 1893 from the first Central Premises. By 1913 further expansion resulted in the construction of a new building at the corner of Hazelwell Street and Umberslade Road. Throughout the district various shops became branches where members could recite their ‘divvy’ number and be rewarded by collecting a dividend for shopping in the TASCOS chain of stores. Initially bread was made at a bake-house at the rear of the old Central Premises until larger premises were opened in 1905 and even larger premises were acquired in Mary Vale Road in 1929. The Central Butchery was established in 1913. By 1914 the model dairy in Ribblesdale Road was distributing 5,000 gallons of milk a week. Although TASCOS began trading in coal in 1898 the site at Lifford was not operational until 1917. The furnishing department opened in 1915. A Hairdresser (1926), a chemist (1928), and the Funeral Department (1932) were also opened. The laundry moved from Mary Vale Road to Bewdley Road where it opened in 1939 at a cost of £36,000. The building was a target in 1940 air raids. The Co-Operative movement had an ethos of Education and Social Activities. A sports pavilion was erected on ground purchased near Lifford. By 1951, the membership had grown to over 60,000 and the office staff to 192. After a short period of administration by the Co-operative Wholesale Society in 1971 TASCOS was absorbed into the Birmingham Co-operative Society.

The co-op food store ceased trading in Stirchley on 25 January 2020, ahead of Morrisons supermarket taking over the building.

===Housing===
Much of Pershore Road from Cotteridge to Pebble Mill is lined with artisans houses built from the 1870s. Many of the side roads have similar houses and there are also unique terraces, Derwent Cottages, and Rose Cottages that lie behind the Pershore Road. The main builders were Grant’s Estates and they often gave the terraces names and the date of construction. Grant’s Estates was founded by brothers Thomas James Grant and Henry Michael Grant in the 1890s. Groups of terraced housing in Cotteridge and King’s Heath, stable blocks, and other jobbing work in 1897 can be traced to the company. They concentrated on buying building plots on green field sites, laying out the roads and drainage, and letting the properties. Their business premises were next to the railway bridge in Cotteridge. Sewell’s acquired the business in 1961. The family lived in a house called Falcon Hill which became a police station in the 1960s and was replaced by Grant’s Court ten years later. The family name is preserved in the Grant Arms pub. Mrs Ellen Grant Ferris bought Harvington Hall, in 1920, which she gave to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Birmingham. 

The houses on the East side of the Pershore Road from Ten Acres heading towards Pebble Mill are known as the ABC houses as they are named in alphabetical order after places in Britain. The ambitious project only got as far as J for Jarrow.

===Parks and open spaces===
Stirchley Park is a pocket park between Hazelwell Street and Bond Street. There is mown grass with mature as well as recently planted trees and a few benches. A wall by the park has some professional Graffiti. The park once had a competitive bowling club with a green and pavilion for the players. This had not been used for many years and, as part of a Community Asset Transfer, will become the car-park for the new Community Centre. The park has now been established as the venue for the annual Stirchley Festival. The vehicular entrance to the park is being improved by the demolition of an extension to the listed Friends Meeting House. It is likely that the Farmers Market will also relocate to this site. Hazelwell Park was the former venue for the festival but major works to address issues of flooding meant it was temporarily unavailable and the new location fits in well with the regeneration of Stirchley. Near Hazelwell Park, still known to some as Newlands Park, there are significant community allotments. Ten Acres Park is between Cartland Road and Dogpool Lane where the former head race for the mill was cut from the Bourn and the River Rea. The community has suggested the creation of a natural wetland area on land subject to flooding. Holders Lane Playing Fields is on the site of the ancient Farmons Mill. Lifford Reservoir was built near the junction of the Worcester and Birmingham Canal, and the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal, as a supply lake for the nearby mills. It was also a leisure resort with a tea shop, boating and fishing. During the 1920s and 1930s there were tea rooms, boats for hire, and fishing at Dogpool Mill pool.

===Cinemas and library===
Picturedrome, Hudson Drive: It was opened on the site of Hudson Brothers Ltd in 1913 but Cotteridge Cinema Ltd went into liquidation in 1932. It is now a factory unit and a small estate has been built on the former industrial land at the end of the Drive.

Savoy Cinema, Breedon Cross: This building was opened in 1922 as the ‘Palace of Varieties’. Ten years later the name was changed to the Savoy and it closed in 1958. The building continued in use as Wyvern Engineering.

Empire, Pershore Road: It opened in 1912 to the design of architects Wood and Kenrick of Colmore Row. William Astley, father-in-law of Sidney Clift, who started the Clifton Circuit, was the first proprietor of the Empire. The cinema, known locally as the ‘Bug House’, had closed by 1950. The building was then used as a car hire depot.

Stirchley Pavilion, Pershore Road, was designed by Harold Seymore Scott and opened on 18 November 1931 by Alderman Sir Percival Bower. In 1931 a large house was demolished, an orchard ploughed up, and the Cinema was built. The promoters included Joseph Cohen who owned the News Theatre in Birmingham. The Pavilion’s at Stirchley and Wylde Green were intended as the first of a chain of Pavilions throughout the Midlands. However, the idea was abandoned and they became ABC houses. It had a seating capacity of 2,500 and a restaurant. A Ten-pin bowling alley was built next to the cinema which closed in 1968. After alterations it became ‘The Star’, a Bingo (United Kingdom) and bowls venue. Part of the building is now Fitness First.

The area is served by Stirchley Library.

===Public houses===
The earliest pubs were the Cross Inn, that was relocated to build the GKN works and the Black Horse where Stirchley Baths was built.

The Three Horseshoes public house existed in 1836 although it was rebuilt in the 1920s. It was also used as a meeting place to auction local plots of land. The Inn sold Davenports’ Celebrated and Noted Bottled Ales and Stouts. Davenports operated a ‘beer at home’ delivery service. In 2020 the pub was refurbished and opened under the new name of The Bournbrook Inn. It includes a bar, restaurant and 53 rooms and is operated by Westfield Leisure.

The British Oak was a small beer house that was rebuilt in 1926. The new building was designed by Mr Brassington, who had designed the Barton Arms some twenty two years earlier. At the rear is a bowling green, gardens, and a children’s playground.

The New Dogpool Hotel was previously on the opposite corner on Dogpool Lane where the Birmingham Municipal Bank was opened in 1928. It replaced the Ten Acres Tavern, a Holt’s pub, which stood at the junction of St Stephen’s Road and dates from 1923. It has changed names a number of times.

Further along the Pershore Road is the Selly Park Tavern with its bowling green and skittle alley. Formerly the Pershore Road Inn and then the Selly Park Hotel, it was built on land owned by the brewer Sir John Holder whose initials appear on the centre gable. After 1920 Holders Brewery was acquired by Mitchells &amp; Butlers. The Tavern has a separate skittle alley in what may have been the earlier inn’s outbuildings. It also has a bowling green.

The Highbury marks the boundary with Moseley and King’s Heath Ward. The Lifford Curve suffered the same fate as the Breedon Bar being burnt beyond repair. The Hazelwell was built on the site of Hazelwell Hall.

The Lifford Curve public house was located on Fordhouse Lane. The name of the pub was taken from the nearby curve in the Camp Hill line.The building was badly damaged by a fire in May 2010.
The pub was later demolished and the site sold for redevelopment. The site is now occupied by Thrifty Car Rental

The Breedon Bar was closed in 1993. It was a listed building but was so badly damaged by a major fire that it had to be demolished. It is now an apartment block.

Between 2015 and 2019, the area saw a sudden increase of micropubs, bars and breweries (with adjacent tap houses) launch either on or near the Pershore Road. This included The Wildcat Tap, Cork &amp; Cage, Artefact, Attic Brew, Glasshouse Brewery and the Birmingham Brewing Company. In 2019, the Couch cocktail bar opened (also selling beer). The area became colloquially known as the Stirchley Beer Mile and often also included Cotteridge Wines and Stirchley Wines off licenses as well as the long established British Oak pub.

===Stirchley Baths===
On 25 June 1911, Stirchley Baths in Bournville Lane were opened to the public by King&#x27;s Norton and Northfield Urban District Council. These were the second baths constructed by the council with the other being located on Tiverton Road, Bournbrook. Later that year, the baths were taken over by the Birmingham Baths Committee. The baths contained one swimming pool with a spectators&#x27; gallery, private baths for men and women and a small steam room. In the winter months, the swimming pool was floored over and the room was used as a hall. The private baths service was discontinued after the baths were taken by the City of Birmingham Baths Department shortly after opening. An unusual feature of the baths was a system of aeration and filtration of the water, which was obtained from the council&#x27;s mains supply and continuously filtered. This was one of the first uses of such a system in swimming baths in the country and it was later introduced and installed in all baths in all local authorities. Swimming baths usually obtained the water from deep wells constructed beneath the premises.

These baths are a grade II Listed building but were closed in 1986 and became tumbledown. In January 2015 a building refurbishment project began, using money from the sale of the old Community Centre (as part of a supermarket redevelopment) and a £1 million community development grant. The building reopened as a community centre in January 2016.

Pictures of the derelict state of the baths can be viewed here and here.

==Places of worship==
Church of Ascension: construction of the Church of Ascension began in 1898 on Hazelwell Street on land adjoining the Church School and School House. These later became the church hall. Construction was completed in 1901 and it was consecrated by the Bishop of Coventry on 30 October 1901. It was designed by W. Hale as a Chapel of ease to St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Moseley. A separate Parish was assigned to it in 1912 out of the parishes of St. Mary&#x27;s, Moseley and St. Nicolas, Kings Norton. On 1 December 1927, a daughter church dedicated to St. Hugh of Lincoln serving the Dads Lane estate was opened in Pineapple Grove. A new parish of St Mary Magdalene, Hazelwell, was created, taking in part of Stirchley parish. During World War II the church hall was taken over by the ‘British Restaurant’.

On 29 October 1965

<text>The Verkhovna Rada (; VR), officially the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, is the unicameral parliament of Ukraine. It consists of 450 deputies, who are presided over by a speaker. The Verkhovna Rada meets in the Verkhovna Rada building in Ukraine&#x27;s capital Kyiv.

The Verkhovna Rada developed out of the systems of the republican representative body known in the Soviet Union as the Supreme Soviet (Supreme Council) that was first established on 26 June 1938 as a type of legislature of the Ukrainian SSR after the dissolution of the Congress of Soviets of the Ukrainian SSR.

The 12th convocation of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR (elected in 1990) issued the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine, introduced elements of a market economy and political liberalization, and officially changed the numeration of its sessions, proclaiming itself the first convocation of the &quot;Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine&quot;. The current parliament is the ninth convocation. Because of the war in Donbas and the unilateral annexation of Crimea by Russia, elections for the constituencies situated in Donbas and Crimea were not held in the 2014 and 2019 elections; hence the current composition of the Verkhovna Rada consists of 424 deputies.

The Verkhovna Rada previously used a mixed voting system, in which 50% of the seats were distributed under party lists with a 5% election threshold and the other 50% through first-past-the-post voting systems in single-member constituencies. The method of 50/50 mixed elections was used in the 2002, 2012, 2014 and 2019 elections; however, in 2006 and 2007, the elections were held under a proportional system only. According to the election law that became valid on 1 January 2020, the next election to the Verkhovna Rada, set to be held after the Russian invasion of Ukraine ends, will be held under a proportional system.

==Name==
The name &quot;Rada&quot; () means &quot;council&quot;. The institution originated in the time of Kievan Rus&#x27; and then represented a council of boyars and of the higher clergy. In the 17th and 18th centuries the Dnieper Cossacks used the term to refer to the meetings where major decisions were made; the Cossacks elected new councils by popular vote. The Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic between 17 March 1917 and 29 April 1918 had a Central Rada. The West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic and the Ukrainian government-in-exile each had a UNRada (Ukrainian National Rada).

The current name of the parliament derives from the Soviet practice of calling national parliament and parliaments of its constituent republics &quot;Supreme Soviets&quot; (). Like in many other Soviet republics, &quot;Verkhovna Rada&quot; is a localized version of this term used in the Ukrainian SSR. After Ukraine regained independence in 1991, the term &quot;Verkhovnaya Rada&quot; () had been in use in both Russian and Ukrainian-based russophone media as a loan translation of the Ukrainian term. &quot;Verkhovna&quot;, the feminine form of the adjective meaning &quot;supreme&quot;, derives from the Ukrainian word meaning &quot;top&quot;.

Another name, used less commonly, is the &quot;Parliament of Ukraine&quot; ().

==History==
===1917–1990===
* Central Rada in 1917–18
* Ukrainian National Rada in 1918 (West Ukraine)
* Labour Congress of Ukraine in 1919 (along with West Ukrainian delegates)
* Rada of the Republic in 1921 (exiled in Tarnów, Poland)

The Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic replaced the All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets and was a type of legislative authority of Soviet Ukraine according to the 1937 Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR. The All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets had already been renamed the Supreme Council in 1927. The Congress of Soviets was initiated by its Central Executive Committee, which it elected and held accountable. The last chairman of the committee was Hryhoriy Petrovsky (also known as Grigoriy Petrovskiy in Russian transliteration).

The first elections to the Supreme Council of the Ukrainian SSR took place on 26 June 1938. The first session of the parliament took place in Kyiv from 25 July through to 28 July 1938. The first Chairman of the council was Mykhailo Burmystenko who later died during World War II. In 1938, a Presidium was elected by the council that was chaired by Leonid Korniyets. The Presidium represented the council whenever it was not in session.

During the war, the Presidium was evacuated to the city of Saratov in the Russian SFSR. On 29 June 1943, the Presidium issued an order postponing elections for the new convocation for one year while extending the first convocation. On 8 January 1944, the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR in agreement with the Communist Party decided to relocate the Presidium of the Supreme Council from Kharkiv to Kyiv. New elections were scheduled for 9 February 1947 for the Council.
===1990–present===
Until 24 August 1991, Verkhovna Rada kept the name Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR.

The first partially free elections to the Verkhovna Rada and local councils of people&#x27;s deputies were held on 4 March 1990. Although the Communist Party still remained in control, a &quot;Democratic Bloc&quot; was formed by numerous parties, including People&#x27;s Movement of Ukraine (&quot;Rukh&quot;), Helsinki Watch Committee of Ukraine, Party of Greens of Ukraine, and many others.

The twelfth convocation of the Supreme Council of the Ukrainian SSR issued the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine on 16 July 1990, and declared Ukrainian independence on 24 August 1991, at approximately 6 p.m. local time. At the time, the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada was Leonid Kravchuk. The Act of Ukrainian Independence was overwhelmingly supported in a national referendum held on 1 December 1991. On 12 September 1991, the parliament adopted the law &quot;On the Legal Succession of Ukraine&quot;. Thus, the VR became the &quot;Supreme Council of Ukraine&quot;.

The Constitution of Ukraine was adopted by the thirteenth convocation of the Verkhovna Rada on 28 June 1996, at approximately 9 a.m. local time. The parliament&#x27;s fourteenth convocation officially changed the numbering of the convocations proclaiming itself the &quot;third&quot; (democratic and independent) convocation of the Verkhovna Rada. After the Orange Revolution, constitutional amendments were adopted in December 2004, by the fourth (fifteenth) convocation of the Verkhovna Rada. On 1 October 2010, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine overturned the 2004 Amendments, considering them unconstitutional. On 21 February 2014, parliament reinstated the December 2004 amendments to the constitution.

In 2017 and 2018, the website of the Verkhovna Rada was the most popular among all websites of the parliaments of UN member states.

==Location==

The Verkhovna Rada meets in a neo-classical building on Kyiv&#x27;s vulytsia Mykhaila Hrushevskoho (Mykhaila Hrushevsky Street) and Ploshcha Konstytutsii (Constitution Square). The building adjoins Mariinskyi Park and the 18th century Mariinskyi Palace, designed by Bartolomeo Rastrelli, which serves as the official residence of the President of Ukraine.

After the transfer of the capital of the Ukrainian SSR from Kharkiv to Kyiv in 1934, a whole set of government buildings was planned for the city. In 1936, a contest for the construction of the new parliament building was won by architect Volodymyr Zabolotny.

The original building was constructed from 1936 to 1938. Having been destroyed in the Second World War, the building was reconstructed from 1945 to 1947, with the rebuilt glass dome one metre higher than the original.

===Other locations===
* Palace Ukraina (the 1999 presidential oath of Leonid Kuchma)
* Ukrainian House (21 January 2000)
* Building of budget committee (6–8 vulytsia Bankova on 4 April 2013)

==Mission and authority==
The Verkhovna Rada is the sole body of legislative power in Ukraine. The parliament determines the principles of domestic and foreign policy, introduces amendments to the Constitution of Ukraine, adopts laws, approves the state budget, designates elections for the President of Ukraine, impeaches the president, declares war and peace, appoints the Prime Minister of Ukraine, appoints or confirms certain officials, appoints one-third of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, ratifies and denounces international treaties, and exercises certain control functions. The Constitution of Ukraine stipulates that the Verkhovna Rada is authorized to fulfil its functions under the condition that at least two-thirds of its constitutional composition (300 or more people&#x27;s deputies) are elected.

In Ukraine there are no requirements for the minimum number of signatures (of deputies) to register a bill. In general the parliament adopts about 200 bills per year. An average of five to six bills are registered daily in parliament. As a result of this in the spring of 2019 parliament had more than 10 thousand registered and under consideration bills it had yet to debate.

All procedural regulations are contained in the Law on Regulations of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. The latest version of the document was adopted on 16 December 2012, in which through the initiative of the President of Ukraine amendments were made concerning registration and voting by parliamentarians. 2012 became a year of numerous changes in regards to the document, among which were changes to the election of the chairman. Bills are usually considered following the procedure of three readings; the President of Ukraine must sign a law before it can be officially promulgated.

Until 2017 the parliament appointed and dismissed judges from their posts and permitted detention or arrest of judges (those powers were transferred to the High Council of Justice).

==Composition==
The Verkhovna Rada is a unicameral legislature with 450 people&#x27;s deputies () elected on the basis of equal and direct universal suffrage through a secret ballot.

===Parliamentary factions, groups, and parties===

All members of parliament are grouped into parliamentary factions and groups. Members of parliament who were elected from a certain party list are not necessarily members of that party. Parties that break the 5% electoral threshold form factions in the parliament. The formation of official parliamentary factions is regulated by the Verkhovna Rada&#x27;s rules and procedures.

Only 15 or more deputies may form a parliamentary faction and an MP may be a member of only one faction at a time. The chairman and his two vice-chairmen may not be the heads of factions. Under current parliamentary rules a faction of non-partisan politicians can not be smaller than the smallest faction of a political party.

Deputies who are expelled from factions or decide to leave them to become individual lawmakers; individual deputies are allowed to unite into parliamentary groups of people&#x27;s deputies that again have at least 15 deputies. Several influential parties have been founded after originally being formed as a faction in the Verkhovna Rada, for example, the Party of Regions, All-Ukrainian Union &quot;Fatherland&quot; and Labour Ukraine.

Each parliamentary faction or group appoints a leader.

Since the Imperative mandate provisions of the Ukrainian constitution came into effect again in February 2014 a political party can withdraw a parliamentary mandate if one of their MPs leaves its parliamentary faction. MPs who defected from one faction to another were known as &quot;Tushky&quot; a derogatory name meaning &quot;carcass&quot;. The term was applied to deputies allegedly bribed to switch factions.

In 2010, women accounted for 8.5% of MPs. After the 2012 parliamentary election they made up 10% of the parliament. Following the 2014 parliamentary election women made up 11.1% of the parliament; setting a record for Ukraine. For comparison, the EU average for female representation in national legislatures was 25% as of 2014. Ukraine made further progress in this area in the 2019 elections, following which 21% of the Rada was female.

On 20 March 2022, the activities of the main opposition party, Opposition Platform — For Life were suspended by the National Security and Defense Council for the period of martial law due to allegations of having ties to Russia made by the Council during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

====Biggest parliamentary factions====
* 1990–1994 Communist Party of Ukraine (After the failed 1991 August Putsch in Moscow it was simply called as Group of 239)
* 1994–2002 Communist Party of Ukraine
* 2002–2006 Viktor Yushchenko Bloc &quot;Our Ukraine&quot;
* 2006–2014 Party of Regions
* 2014 All-Ukrainian Union &quot;Fatherland&quot;
* 2014–2019 Petro Poroshenko Bloc &quot;Solidarity&quot;

===Members of Parliament===
Members of the Verkhovna Rada are known officially as &quot;People&#x27;s deputies of Ukraine&quot;. According to the &quot;Law on elections of national deputies of Ukraine&quot;, a citizen of Ukraine may become a People&#x27;s Deputy if he or she has, on the day of the election, a) reached 21 years of age; b) political franchise; c) resided in Ukraine for the last five years.

Deputies have the right to free transportation, free use of the hall of official delegations, free housing, free medical services and free vacations at health spas. Each deputy is allowed to have up to 31 assistants-consultants four out of them are allowed to be admitted into the Secretariat of the Verkhovna Rada. Until 2019, the Ukrainian President, Prime Minister, members of the government and deputies all had parliamentary immunity and agents of law enforcement were prohibited from searching their homes or following them. During the Orange Revolution and the campaign for the 2007 parliamentary election Party of Regions, OU-PSD and BYuT all promised to strip lawmakers of their parliamentary immunity. In June 2008 the parliament failed to adopt the &quot;Bill on restriction of privileges for deputies and introduction of imperative mandate&quot;. 192 people&#x27;s deputies voted &quot;for&quot; the bill submitted by the BYuT faction out of 436 deputies registered in the plenary hall. The factions of the opposition Party of Regions, as well as the CPU and the Lytvyn Bloc, voted against, the OU-PSD faction voted partially &quot;for&quot; and the BYUT faction voted unanimously &quot;for&quot;. A proposal to send the bill for the first reading for a second time also did not find support. In May 2009 the second Tymoshenko Government approved a bill amending the &quot;Law on the status of a people&#x27;s deputy of Ukraine&quot;, this bill reduced certain privileges for incumbent and former deputies. The parliament canceled some benefits and payments to lawmakers in December 2011.

Deputy&#x27;s absence from parliamentary meetings is being countered by withholding salary.

In December 2019 deputy&#x27;s immunity was dismantled except that a lawmaker is not legally liable for the results of voting or statements in parliament and its bodies.

Over the years several local millionaires have been members of the Rada.

In early 2020, Servant of the People announced plans to reduce the number of deputies from the current 450 to 300. An initial vote regarding this initiative garnered 236 votes in favor, 40 against, and 86 abstentions.

====Oath of office====
Before assuming office, the deputies must take the following oath before the leadership of the Rada and fellow deputies on the first day of a new session of the Rada.

==Other offices==

===Chairman and deputy chairmen===
The Verkhovna Rada elects from among its ranks a Chairman (Speaker; ), a First Deputy Chairman, and a Second Deputy Chairman.

Before the Chairman of a newly convoked Rada is elected, parliamentary sessions are presided over by members of a temporary presidium of the first session (). The temporary presidium is composed of five deputies, representing the four largest parliamentary fractions plus the chairman of a preparatory deputy group of the first parliamentary session, however, the Rada may enact an &quot;ad hoc&quot; deviation from this composition rule.

The chairman presides over parliamentary sessions, signs bills and sends them to the President for promulgation, signs and promulgates parliamentary acts (other than bills), organises staff work, etc. The chairman is also empowered to call special sessions of parliament, enact bills vetoed by the President when the Verkhovna Rada votes to overturn a veto by a two-thirds majority, and participate in meetings of the National Security and Defence Council.

In circumstances where the post of President of Ukraine becomes vacant, the Chairman of the Rada becomes the acting head of state with limited authority. The chairman in duties of the President may dissolve parliament, appoint or submit for parliamentary approval candidates for key official posts, grant military ranks or state orders, and exercise the right of pardon. The Constitution and Ukrainian legislation contain no provision for presidential succession in cases where the posts of President and Chairman of the Rada are vacant simultaneously.

===Presidium===
The Presidium of the Verkhovna Rada is a collective name that was adapted for the chairman and his or her deputies out of tradition. Before the collapse of the Soviet Union, it was an official office that was elected at the first session of each convocation of the Supreme Soviet. Originally it consisted of a chairman, the chairman&#x27;s two deputies, a secretary, and 19 additional members. Later compositions of the Presidium changed. The Presidium was regulated by Section 106 of the 1978 Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR, which empowered the Presidium with almost all of the Verkhovna Rada&#x27;s powers wherever the latter was not in session, on the nominal condition that any decrees be laid at the next parliamentary session for approval. Since the adoption of the Ukrainian Constitution the institution has been discontinued, but the term is used for the leadership of parliament that includes the current chairman and his or her deputies and may include faction leaders.

The first session of every newly elected parliament is headed by a temporary presidium that consists of six members of parliament according to Article 18 of the Regulations of the Verkhovna Rada.

===Ceremonial opening and the first session of new convocation===
One of the most important sessions of the parliament is the first session of each newly elected parliament. The preparation for the session is conducted by the Preparation deputy group with support from the Office of the Verkhovna Rada. The formation of the group out of the newly elected People&#x27;s Deputies is conducted by the Chairman of the previous convocation or his/her deputy chairpersons (Article 13, Regulations of the Verkhovna Rada). The group elects its own chairperson, his or her deputy and a secretary on principles for establishing the temporary special commission. The group terminates its activity with the establishment of parliamentary committees.

Before the opening of the first session of each newly elected parliament, all newly elected People&#x27;s Deputies of Ukraine are gathered for a special ceremonial meeting to take the oath of office (article 14, Regulations of the Verkhovna Rada). An Invitation to take the oath is given by the Chairperson of the previous convocation who grants the leading word to the oldest member of the parliament and asks the members to rise and reads the oath out loud. Every member of parliament signs a copy of the oath that is held in the archives of the Verkhovna Rada.

The plenary meetings of the first session reviews the following matters: formation of the provisional presidium of the first session, establishment and registration of the factions, the situation concerning legislation pending before parliament with the Chairman of the previous convocation, the election of the Counting Commission, the chairman, the chairman&#x27;s deputies, hearing of extraordinary messages on domestic and foreign affairs by the President of Ukraine, hearing and discussion of the Preparation deputy group report, about the parliamentary committees, about Conciliation board of deputy factions in the Verkhovna Rada and about media coverage of the activities and sessions held by the Verkhovna Rada.

=== Office of the Verkhovna Rada ===

The Office of the Verkhovna Rada is an internal supporting department of the Verkhovna Rada that provides organizational, legal, social, analytical and other support to parliament, its other departments and members of the parliament. The Office is apolitical in its role and exists mainly to provide secretarial help.

Before the first session of each newly elected parliament, the Office provides to members of parliament various documents among which are copies of the Constitution of Ukraine, the Regulations of the Verkhovna Rada, the official results of the election from the Central Election Commission of Ukraine, the Law of Ukraine on the status of People&#x27;s Deputies, among others (Article 12, Regulations of the Verkhovna Rada).

===Office of the Ombudsman===
The Office of the Ombudsman at the Verkhovna Rada was established in 1998 and was led by Nina Karpachova until 2012. The Office has its own secretariat and advisory council. The current Ombudsman is Lyudmyla Denisova who replaced Valeriya Lutkovska in 2017.

===Committees===

The Verkhovna Rada establishes parliamentary committees composed of various deputies. On 4 December 2014, the current parliament formed 27 committees and 2 special control commissions. The previous parliament (2012–2014) had 29 committees and an ad hoc supervisory board. The sixth session of the Rada (2007–2012) had 28 committees, including the Budget Committee, the Special Control Commission of the Verkhovna Rada on Privatization and the Committee on Transportation and Communications. There are no permanent or standing committees; instead, committees are reformed from one convocation to another. One of the most significant assignments of the Verkhovna Rada is the Budget Committee.

===Investigative commissions===
Members of the Verkhovna Rada are permitted to create temporary investigative commissions. Creating such a commission requires one-third of the constitutional composition of parliament, 150 members. Before a draft on creation of such a commission may be scheduled for voting, it has to be approved by a relevant committee, the Committee on Regulations, deputy ethics, and ensuring the work of the Verkhovna Rada.

==Incidents in parliament==
===Fights and incidents===
Brawls are not unusual in the Ukrainian parliament. On several occasions work in parliament is blocked by sit-ins by various parties (usually for a couple of days; but in 2008 from 18 January till 6 March and in February 2013 for 17 days). In 2000 and on 4 April 2013 the parliament split into two and held two sessions on two different premises.

A noticeable incident was the disorder of 27 April 2010, after the parliament ratified a treaty that extended the Russian Black Sea Fleet lease in the Crimean port of Sevastopol until 2042, when Chairman Volodymyr Lytvyn had to be shielded with umbrellas as he was pelted with eggs, while smoke bombs exploded and politicians brawled. Another major incident occurred on 16 December 2010 when several Rada members were admitted to hospital after Party of Regions politicians stormed the parliament podium, which was occupied by the Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko faction.

On 12 December 2012, an all-out scuffle broke out in Parliament, as Batkivshchyna party members attempted to prevent the swearing in of two members who had left the party during the body&#x27;s first session following the October 2012 election. The same day members of the All-Ukrainian Union &quot;Svoboda&quot; removed the fence around the Verkhovna Rada that was installed early October 2012. The speaker of the parliament Volodymyr Rybak promised to review the incident of the fence removal. The fence is not accounted as the property of parliament nor the city of Kyiv. Rybak noted that the matter might require a review within a special designated committee.

From the parliamentary election of 28 October 2012 till the first months of 2013 parliamentary work was virtually paralyzed because the opposition (UDAR, Fatherland, Svoboda, others) blocked the podium and chairman&#x27;s seat on various days.

==Elections==
Political developments in Ukraine have led to repeated changes in the electoral system used for parliamentary elections. Each convocation of the Verkhovna Rada has been elected under a different set of laws gradually evolving from the purely majoritarian scheme inherited from the Soviet era to a purely proportional scheme, effective from 2006 until 2010. The next election to the Verkhovna Rada&lt;ref name=&quot;chesno.org/post/3402EFGH&quot;&gt; Early to rejoice? Regular parliamentary elections may take place under Yanukovych&#x27;s law, Civil movement &quot;Chesno&quot; (11 July 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; again will be held under a proportional scheme.

In the 1990 and 1994 elections, all 450 MPs were elected in single-member districts. Ukraine was therefore divided at the time into 450 electoral districts. Each district sent one member to parliament. To win a seat, a candidate needed more than 50% of the votes. If no candidate had 50%, then the two leading candidates participated in a run-off vote.

In the 1998 and 2002 elections, 225 MPs were elected in single-member districts as earlier (with the exception that the candidate needed only a simple majority to win). The remaining 225 MPs were elected on a proportional basis. These seats were divided between the parties who passed a 4% electoral threshold.

In the 2006 and 2007 elections, all deputies were elected on a proportional basis. All seats were divided between the parties who passed a 3% electoral threshold. For the 2007 election, the threshold percentage was not changed, but some amendments to the election process were made. In the 2012, 2014 and 2019 elections a mixed voting system was again used (50% under party lists and 50% under simple-majority constituencies) with a 5% election threshold.

According to current law, the next election to the Verkhovna Rada should have been in 2023, however, due to the imposition of martial law in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, these elections have been indefinitely postponed (by law) until martial law is lifted. According to the latest reversion of the electoral code of Ukraine, which took effect on 1 January 2020, this election will be without single-member constituencies and instead deputies can only be elected on a party list in one nationwide constituency with a 5% election threshold with open regional lists of candidates for deputies.

<text>Tyburn is a ward in Birmingham, in the county of West Midlands, England formerly known as Kingsbury.

It is part of the Erdington formal district and comprises Castle Vale, Fort Parkway in Castle Bromwich, the Pype Hayes area of Erdington, Birches Green and Tyburn Road. The significant landmarks in the area include Jaguar Cars&#x27; Castle Bromwich Assembly factory, Fort Dunlop and Pype Hayes Park.

The Castle Vale Library, built in 2006, serves the area. The library was designed by Birmingham-based Associated Architects and built by the Castle Vale Housing Action Trust.

==Geography of the area==
Tyburn covers the municipal housing estates of Birches Green, Pype Hayes and Castle Vale as well as Erdington Hall, a residential area.

The housing estates of Pype Hayes and Castle Vale have witnessed significant regeneration in recent times. Entire estates in Pype Hayes were cleared and replaced with modern housing by Birmingham City Council. Castle Vale was home to one of Europe&#x27;s largest urban regeneration projects which resulted in the demolition of many tower blocks and low rise flats and the construction of a retail park and semi-detached modern housing. This was done by the Housing Action Trust, established in 1993.

The industrial area of Bromford was formerly part of the old Kingsbury Ward most of which was incorporated into the new Tyburn Ward. It has witnessed redevelopment in the form of the construction of the Fort Shopping Centre and the Heartlands Spine Road which connects the A47 Nechells to the A47 Chester Road.

==Population==
The 2001 Population Census recorded that there were 16,480 people living in Tyburn with a population density of 2,816 people per km2 compared with 3,649 people per km2 for Birmingham. This ward has the smallest population of all Birmingham City wards. 8.9% (1,465) of the ward&#x27;s population consists of ethnic minorities compared with 29.6% for Birmingham in general. At the time of the 2011 Census the population had increased to 25,927.

==Politics==
Tyburn is represented by three Labour councillors on Birmingham City Council.

The ward has adopted a Ward Support Officer.

People living in the area tend see themselves as living in Erdington, Castle Bromwich, Birches Green or Castle Vale, people seldom say they live in Tyburn.

<doc id="845000" wikidata="Q167738" url="?curid=845000" title="Plastic welding">
<text>Plastic welding is welding for semi-finished plastic materials, and is described in ISO 472 as a process of uniting softened surfaces of materials, generally with the aid of heat (except for solvent welding). Welding of thermoplastics is accomplished in three sequential stages, namely surface preparation, application of heat and pressure, and cooling. Numerous welding methods have been developed for the joining of semi-finished plastic materials. Based on the mechanism of heat generation at the welding interface, welding methods for thermoplastics can be classified as external and internal heating methods, as shown in Fig 1.

Production of a good quality weld does not only depend on the welding methods, but also weldability of base materials. Therefore, the evaluation of weldability is of higher importance than the welding operation (see rheological weldability) for plastics.

==Welding techniques==
A number of techniques are used for welding of semi-finished plastic products as given below:

===Hot gas welding===

Hot gas welding, also known as &quot;hot air welding&quot;, is a plastic welding technique using heat. A specially designed heat gun, called a &quot;hot air welder&quot;, produces a jet of hot air that softens both the parts to be joined and a plastic filler rod, all of which must be of the same or a very similar plastic. (Welding PVC to acrylic is an exception to this rule.)

Hot air/gas welding is a common fabrication technique for manufacturing smaller items such as chemical tanks, water tanks, heat exchangers, and plumbing fittings.

In the case of webs and films a filler rod may not be used. Two sheets of plastic are heated via a hot gas (or a heating element) and then rolled together. This is a quick welding process and can be performed continuously.

====Welding rod====
A plastic welding rod, also known as a &quot;thermoplastic welding rod&quot;, is a rod with circular or triangular cross-section used to bind two pieces of plastic together. They are available in a wide range of colors to match the base material&#x27;s color. Spooled plastic welding rod is known as &quot;spline&quot;.

An important aspect of plastic welding rod design and manufacture is the porosity of the material. A high porosity will lead to air bubbles (known as &quot;voids&quot;) in the rods, which decrease the quality of the welding. The highest quality of plastic welding rods are therefore those with zero porosity, which are called &quot;voidless&quot;.

====Heat sealing====
Heat sealing is the process of sealing one thermoplastic to another similar thermoplastic using heat and pressure. The direct contact method of heat sealing utilizes a constantly heated die or sealing bar to apply heat to a specific contact area or path to seal or weld the thermoplastics together. A variety of heat sealers is available to join thermoplastic materials such as plastic films: Hot bar sealer, Impulse sealer, etc.

Heat sealing is used for many applications, including heat seal connectors, thermally activated adhesives, and film or foil sealing. Common applications for the heat sealing process: Heat seal connectors are used to join LCDs to PCBs in many consumer electronics, as well as in medical and telecommunication devices. Heat sealing of products with thermal adhesives is used to hold clear display screens onto consumer electronic products and for other sealed thermo-plastic assemblies or devices where heat staking or ultrasonic welding is not an option due to part design requirements or other assembly considerations.

Heat sealing also is used in the manufacturing of bloodtest film and filter media for the blood, virus and many other test strip devices used in the medical field today. Laminate foils and films often are heat sealed over the top of thermoplastic medical trays, Microtiter (microwell) plates, bottles and containers to seal and/or prevent contamination for medical test devices, sample collection trays and containers used for food products. Medical and the Food Industries manufacturing Bag or flexible containers use heat sealing for either perimeter welding of the plastic material of the bags and/or for sealing ports and tubes into the bags.

====Freehand welding====
With freehand welding, the jet of hot air (or inert gas) from the welder is placed on the weld area and the tip of the weld rod at the same time. As the rod softens, it is pushed into the joint and fuses to the parts. This process is slower than most others, but it can be used in almost any situation.

===Speed tip welding===
With speed welding, the plastic welder, similar to a soldering iron in appearance and wattage, is fitted with a feed tube for the plastic weld rod. The speed tip heats the rod and the substrate, while at the same time it presses the molten weld rod into position. A bead of softened plastic is laid into the joint, and the parts and weld rod fuse. With some types of plastic such as polypropylene, the melted welding rod must be &quot;mixed&quot; with the semi-melted base material being fabricated or repaired. These welding techniques have been improved over time and have been utilized for over 50 years by professional plastic fabricators and repairers internationally. Speed tip welding method is a much faster welding technique and with practice can be used in tight corners.
A version of the speed tip &quot;gun&quot; is essentially a soldering iron with a broad, flat tip that can be used to melt the weld joint and filler material to create a bond.

===Extrusion welding===
Extrusion welding allows the application of bigger welds in a single weld pass. It is the preferred technique for joining material over 6 mm thick. Welding rod is drawn into a miniature hand held plastic extruder, plasticized, and forced out of the extruder against the parts being joined, which are softened with a jet of hot air to allow bonding to take place.

===Contact welding===
This is the same as spot welding except that heat is supplied with thermal conduction of the pincher tips instead of electrical conduction. Two plastic parts are brought together where heated tips pinch them, melting and joining the parts in the process.

===Hot plate welding===

Related to contact welding, this technique is used to weld larger parts, or parts that have a complex weld joint geometry. The two parts to be welded are placed in the tooling attached to the two opposing platens of a press. A hot plate, with a shape that matches the weld joint geometry of the parts to be welded, is moved in position between the two parts. The two opposing platens move the parts into contact with the hot plate until the heat softens the interfaces to the melting point of the plastic. When this condition is achieved the hot plate is removed, and the parts are pressed together and held until the weld joint cools and re-solidifies to create a permanent bond.

Hot-plate welding equipment is typically controlled pneumatically, hydraulically, or electrically with servo motors.

This process is used to weld automotive under hood components, automotive interior trim components, medical filtration devices, consumer appliance components, and other car interior components.

===Non-contact / IR welding===

Similar to hot plate welding, non-contact welding uses an infrared heat source to melt the weld interface rather than a hot plate. This method avoids the potential for material sticking to the hot plate, but is more expensive and more difficult to achieve consistent welds, particularly on geometrically complex parts.

===High frequency welding===

High Frequency welding, also known as Dielectric Sealing or Radio Frequency (RF) Heat Sealing, is a very mature technology that has been around since the 1940s. High frequency electromagnetic waves in the range of radio frequencies can heat certain polymers up to soften the plastics for joining. Heated plastics under pressure weld together. Heat is generated within the polymer by the rapid reorientation of some chemical dipoles of the polymer, which means that the heating can be localized, and the process can be continuous.

Only certain polymers which contain dipoles can be heated by RF waves, in particular polymers with high loss power. Among these, PVC, polyamides (PA) and acetates are commonly welded with this technology. In practice, two pieces of material are placed on a table press that applies pressure to both surface areas. Dies are used to direct the welding process. When the press comes together, high frequency waves (usually 27.120 MHz) are passed through the small area between the die and the table where the weld takes place. This high frequency (radio frequency) heats the plastic which welds under pressure, taking the shape of the die.

RF welding is fast and relatively easy to perform, produces a limited degradation of the polymer even welding thick layers, does not create fumes, requires a moderate amount of energy and can produce water-, air-, and bacteria-proof welds. Welding parameters are welding power, (heating and cooling) time and pressure, while temperature is generally not controlled directly. Auxiliary materials can also be used to solve some welding problems. This type of welding is used to connect polymer films used in a variety of industries where a strong consistent leak-proof seal is required. In the fabrics industry, RF is most often used to weld PVC and polyurethane (PU) coated fabrics. Other materials commonly welded using this technology are nylon, PET, PEVA, EVA and some ABS plastics. Exercise caution when welding urethane as it has been known to give off toxic cyanide gasses when melting.

===Induction welding===
When an electrical insulator, like a plastic, is embedded with a material having high electrical conductivity, like metals or carbon fibers, induction welding can be performed. The welding apparatus contains an induction coil that is energised with a radio-frequency electric current. This generates an electromagnetic field that acts on either an electrically conductive or a ferromagnetic workpiece. In an electrically conductive workpiece, the main heating effect is resistive heating, which is due to induced currents called eddy currents. Induction welding of carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic materials is a technology commonly used in for instance the aerospace industry.

In a ferromagnetic workpiece, plastics can be induction-welded by formulating them with metallic or ferromagnetic compounds, called susceptors. These susceptors absorb electromagnetic energy from an induction coil, become hot, and lose their heat energy to the surrounding material by thermal conduction.

===Injection welding===
Injection welding is similar/identical to extrusion welding, except, using certain tips on the handheld welder, one can insert the tip into plastic defect holes of various sizes and patch them from the inside out. The advantage is that no access is needed to the rear of the defect hole. The alternative is a patch, except that the patch can not be sanded flush with the original surrounding plastic to the same thickness. PE and PP are most suitable for this type of process. The Drader injectiweld is an example of such tool.

===Ultrasonic welding===

In ultrasonic welding, high frequency (15 kHz to 40 kHz) low amplitude vibration is used to create heat by way of friction between the materials to be joined. The interface of the two parts is specially designed to concentrate the energy for the maximum weld strength. Ultrasonic can be used on almost all plastic material. It is the fastest heat sealing technology available.

===Friction welding===

In friction welding, the two parts to be assembled are rubbed together at a lower frequency (typically 100–300 Hz) and higher amplitude (typically ) than ultrasonic welding. The friction caused by the motion combined with the clamping pressure between the two parts creates the heat which begins to melt the contact areas between the two parts. At this point, the plasticized materials begin to form layers that intertwine with one another, which therefore results in a strong weld. At the completion of the vibration motion, the parts remain held together until the weld joint cools and the melted plastic re-solidifies. The friction movement can be linear or orbital, and the joint design of the two parts has to allow this movement.

===Spin welding===

Spin welding is a particular form of frictional welding. With this process, one component with a round weld joint is held stationary, while a mating component is rotated at high speed and pressed against the stationary component. The rotational friction between the two components generates heat. Once the joining surfaces reach a semi-molten state, the spinning component is stopped abruptly. Force on the two components is maintained until the weld joint cools and re-solidifies. This is a common way of producing low- and medium-duty plastic wheels, e.g., for toys, shopping carts, recycling bins, etc. This process is also used to weld various port openings into automotive under hood components.

===Laser welding===
This technique requires one part to be transmissive to a laser beam and either the other part absorptive or a coating at the interface to be absorptive to the beam. The two parts are put under pressure while the laser beam moves along the joining line. The beam passes through the first part and is absorbed by the other one or the coating to generate enough heat to soften the interface creating a permanent weld.

Semiconductor diode lasers are typically used in plastic welding. Wavelengths in the range of 808 nm to 980 nm can be used to join various plastic material combinations. Power levels from less than 1W to 100W are needed depending on the materials, thickness and desired process speed.

Diode laser systems have the following advantages in joining of plastic materials:

*Cleaner than adhesive bonding
*No micro-nozzles to get clogged
*No liquid or fumes to affect surface finish
*No consumables
*Higher throughput
*Can access work-piece in challenging geometry
*High level of process control

Requirements for high strength joints include adequate transmission through upper layer, absorption by lower layer, materials compatibility (wetting), good joint design (clamping pressure, joint area), and lower power density.

Some materials that can be joined include polypropylene, polycarbonate, acrylic, nylon, and ABS.

Specific applications include sealing, welding, or joining of: catheter bags, medical containers, automobile remote control keys, heart pacemaker casings, syringe tamper evident joints, headlight or tail-light assemblies, pump housings, and cellular phone parts.

====Transparent laser plastic welding====
New fiber laser technology allows for the output of longer laser wavelengths, with the best results typically around 2,000 nm, significantly longer than the average 808 nm to 1064 nm diode laser used for traditional laser plastic welding. Because these longer wavelengths are more readily absorbed by thermoplastics than the infrared radiation of traditional plastic welding, it is possible to weld two clear polymers without any colorants or absorbing additives. Common applications will mostly fall in the medical industry for devices like catheters and microfluidic devices. The heavy use of transparent plastics, especially flexible polymers like TPU, TPE and PVC, in the medical device industry makes transparent laser welding a natural fit. Also, the process requires no laser absorbing additives or colorants making testing and meeting biocompatibility requirements significantly easier.

===Solvent welding===
In solvent welding, a solvent is applied which can temporarily dissolve the polymer at room temperature. When this occurs, the polymer chains are free to move in the liquid and can mingle with other similarly dissolved chains in the other component. Given sufficient time, the solvent will permeate through the polymer and out into the environment, so that the chains lose their mobility. This leaves a solid mass of entangled polymer chains which constitutes a solvent weld.

This technique is commonly used for connecting PVC and ABS pipe, as in household plumbing. The &quot;gluing&quot; together of plastic (polycarbonate, polystyrene or ABS) models is also a solvent welding process.

Dichloromethane (methylene chloride) can solvent weld polycarbonate and polymethylmethacrylate. It is a primary ingredient in some solvent cements. ABS plastic is typically welded with acetone based solvents which are often sold as paint thinners or in smaller containers as nail polish remover.

Solvent welding is a common method in plastics fabrication and used by manufacturers of in-store displays, brochure holders, presentation cases and dust covers. Another popular use of solvents in the hobby segment is model building from injection molded kits for scale models of aircraft, ships and cars which predominantly use polystyrene plastic.

== Testing of plastic welds ==
In order to test plastic welds, there are several requirements for both the inspector as well as the test method. Furthermore, there are two different types of testing weld quality. These two types are destructive and non-destructive testing. Destructive testing serves to qualify and quantify the weld joint whereas nondestructive testing serves to identify anomalies, discontinuities, cracks, and/or crevices. As the names of these two tests implies, destructive testing will destroy the part that is being tested while nondestructive testing enables the test piece to be used afterwards. There are several methods available in each of these types. This section outlines some requirements of testing plastic welds as well as the different types of destructive and non-destructive methods that are applicable to plastic welding and go over some of the advantages and disadvantages.

=== Testing requirements ===
Some standards like the American Welding Society (AWS) require the individuals who are conducting the inspection or test to have a certain level of qualification. For example, AWS G1.6 is the Specification for the Qualification of Plastic Welding Inspectors for Hot Gas, Hot Gas Extrusion, and Heated Tool Butt Thermoplastic Welds. This particular standard dictates that in order to inspect the plastic welds, the inspector needs one of 3 different qualification levels. These levels are the Associate Plastics Welding Inspector (APWI), Plastics Welding Inspector (PWI), and Senior Plastics Welding Inspector (SPWI). Each of these levels have different responsibilities. For example, the APWI has to have direct supervision of a PWI or SPWI in order to conduct the inspection or prepare a report. These three different levels of certification also have different capability requirements, education requirements, and examination requirements. Additionally, they must be able to maintain that qualification every 3 years.

=== Destructive testing ===

==== Bend testing ====

The bend test uses a ram to bend the test coupon to a desired degree. This test setup is shown in Figure 2. 

A list of the minimum bend angles and ram displacements for different plastic materials can be found in the DVS Standards, DVS2203-1 and DVS2203-5. Some of the ram speeds, bend angle, and displacement information from DVS2203-1 are shown in Table 1 and Table 2.

Some of the main advantages of the bend test are it provides qualitative data for tensile, compressive, and shear strain. These results typically lead to a higher confidence level in the quality of the weld joint and process. In contrast, some of the disadvantages are it requires multiple test pieces. It is typically recommended to use a minimum of 6 different test samples. Another disadvantage is that it does not provide specific values for evaluating the joint design. Moreover, large amounts of effort may need to go into preparing the part for testing. This could cause an increase in cost and schedule depending on the complexity of the part. Lastly, like all destructive tests, the part and/or weld seam is destroyed and cannot be used.

==== Tensile testing ====

When conducting the tensile test, a test piece is pulled until it breaks. This test is quantitative and will provide the ultimate tensile strength, strain, as well as the energy to failure if it has extensometers attached to the sample. Additionally, the results from a tensile test cannot be transferable to that of a creep test. The rate at which the specimen is pulled depends on the material. Additionally, the shape of the specimen is also critical. DVS2203-5 and AWS G1.6 are great sources for providing these details. Examples of the shapes are shown in Figure 3 through Figure 5. Additionally, the testing speed per material is shown in Table 3.


One advantage of the tensile test is that it provides quantitative data of the weld for both weld seam and the base material. Additionally, the tensile test is easy to conduct. A major disadvantage of this testing is the amount of preparation required to conduct the test. Another disadvantage is that it does not provide the long-term weld performance. Additionally, since this is also a type of destructive test, the part is destroyed in order to collect this data.

==== Impact testing ====
Also known as the Tensile Impact Test, the Impact Test uses a specimen that is clamped into a pendulum. The test specimen looks like the one shown in Figure 4. The pendulum swings down and strikes the specimen against an anvil breaking the specimen. This test enables the impact energy to be determined for the weld seam and base material. Additionally, the permanent fracture elongation can be calculated by measuring the post-test specimen length. The main advantage of this test is that quantitative data is obtained. Another advantage is that it is easy to set up. The disadvantages are that it too can have a great deal of preparation in order to conduct this test. Also, like the tensile test, there is not a long term weld performance determined, and the part is destroyed.

==== Creep test ====
There are two types of creep tests, the Tensile Creep Test and the Creep Rupture Test. Both creep tests look at the long-term weld performance of the test specimen. These tests are typically conducted in a medium at a constant temperature and constant stress. This test requires a minimum of 6 specimens in order to obtain enough data to conduct a statistical analysis. This test is advantageous in that it provides quantitative data on the long-term weld performance; however, it has its disadvantages as well. There is a lot effort that needs to go into preparing the samples and recording where exactly the specimen came from and the removal method used. This is critical because how the specimen is removed from the host part can greatly influence the test results. Also, there has to be strict control of the test environment. A deviation in the medium&#x27;s temperature can cause the creep rupture time to vary drastically. In some cases, a temperature change of 1 degree Celsius affected the creep rupture time by 13%. Lastly, this test is again a destructive test, so the host part will be destroyed by conducting this type of test.

=== Non-destructive testing ===

==== Visual examination ====
Visual inspection, just like the name implies, is a visual investigation of the weldment. The inspector is typically looking for visual indications such as discolorations, weld defects, discontinuities, porosity, notches, scratches, etc. Typically visual inspection is broken down into different categories or groups for the qualifying inspection criteria. These groupings may vary among standards and each group has a certain level of imperfections that they consider acceptable. There are 5 tables and a chart found in DVS Standard DVS2202-1 that show different types of defects found by visual examination and their permissible acceptance criteria.

Visual inspection is very advantageous in the fact that it is quick, easy, inexpensive, and requires very simple tools and gauges in order to conduct. Because it is so quick, it is typically required to have a weld pass visual inspection prior to being able to have any additional nondestructive test conducted to the specimen. In contrast, the inspection needs to be completed by someone who has a lot of experience and skill. Additionally, this type of test will not give any data into the quality of the weld seam. Because of the low cost, if a part is suspected to have issues, follow on testing can be conducted without much initial investment.

==== X-ray testing ====
X-ray testing of plastics is similar to that of metal weldments, but uses much lower radiation intensity due to the plastics having a lower density than metals. The x-ray testing is used to find imperfections that are below the surface. These imperfections include porosity, solid inclusions, voids, crazes, etc. The x-ray transmits radiation through the tested object onto a film or camera. This film or camera will produce an image. The varying densities of the object will show up as different shades in the image thus showing where the defects are located. One of the advantages of X-ray is that it provides a way to quickly show the flaws both on the surface and inside the weld joint. Additionally, the X-ray can be used on a wide range of materials. They can be used to create a record for the future. One of the disadvantages of X-ray is that it is costly and labor-intensive. Another is that it cannot be used in the evaluation of the weld seam quality or optimize the process parameters. Additionally, if the discontinuity is not aligned properly with the radiation beam, it can be difficult to detect. A fourth disadvantage is that access to both sides of the component being measured is required. Lastly, it presents a health risk due to the radiation that is transmitted during the X-ray process.

==== Ultrasonic testing ====

Ultrasonic testing utilizes high frequency sound waves passing through the weld. The waves are reflected or refracted if they hit an indication. The reflected or refracted wave will have a different amount of time it requires to travel from the transmitter to the receiver than it will if an indication was not present. This change in time is how the flaws are detected. The first advantage that ultrasonic testing provides is that it allows for a relatively quick detection of the flaws inside of the weld joint. This test method also can detect flaws deep inside the part. Additionally, it can be conducted with access from only one side of the part. In contrast, there are several disadvantages of using ultrasonic testing. The first is that it cannot be used to optimize the process parameters or evaluate the seam quality of the weld. Secondly, it is costly and labor-intensive. It also requires experienced technicians to conduct the test. Lastly, there are material limitations with plastics due to transmission limitations of the ultrasonic waves through some of the plastics. The image in Figure 6 shows an example of ultrasonic testing.
==== High voltage leak testing ====
High voltage testing is also known as spark testing. This type of testing utilizes electrically conductive medium to coat the weld. After the weld is coated, the weld is exposed to a high voltage probe. This test shows an indication of a leak in the weld when an arc is observed through the weld. This type of testing is advantageous in the fact that it allows for quick detection of the flaws inside the weld joint and that you only have to have access to one side of the weld. One disadvantage with this type of testing is that there is not a way to evaluate the weld seam quality. Additionally, the weld has to be coated with conductive material.

==== Leak-tightness testing ====
Leak-Tightness Testing or Leak Testing utilizes either liquid or gas to pressurize a part. This type of testing is typically conducted on tubes, containers, and vessels. Another way to leak-test one of these structures is to apply a vacuum to it. One of the advantages is that it is a quick simple way for the weld flaw to be detected. Additionally, it can be used on multiple materials and part shapes. On the other hand, it has a few disadvantages. Firstly, there is not a way to evaluate the weld seam quality. Secondly, it has an explosion hazard associated with it if over pressurization occurs during testing. Last, it is limited to tubular structures.,

<doc id="845002" wikidata="Q2446212" url="?curid=845002" title="Nikolai Sheremetev">
<text>Nikolai Petrovich Sheremetev () (28 June 1751 - 2 January 1809 O.S., 9 July 1751 - 14 January 1809 N.S.) was a Russian count, the son of Petr Borisovich Sheremetev, notable grandee of the epoch of empresses Anna Ivanovna, Elizabeth Petrovna, and Catherine II. He was also the grandson of Boris Petrovich Sheremetev.

His father P. B. Sheremetev was passionate about the theatre and transferred this passion to his son. N. P. Sheremetev spent his early youth at court. From the age of 13 to 14 he started to act in private theatricals of his father, and then &quot;on the big court theatre&quot;. In 1765 he played the role of the god Hymen in the mythological ballet &quot;Acis and Galathea&quot;, in which his childhood comrade, the future Paul I, had distinguished himself.

Having a special passion for music, Nikolai Petrovich masterfully played the cello. From 1769 to 1773 he traveled abroad: he attended lectures in Leiden University in the Netherlands, traveled across England, Germany, and Switzerland, took music lessons, and got acquainted with theatre life. In France he took a great interest in opéra comique.

Returning to Moscow and receiving the post of director of the Moscow bank for noblemen, Sheremetev started to reconstruct his father&#x27;s theatre: he engaged in special education of serf children, &quot;certain to theatre&quot; (Russian letters, foreign languages, music, singing, dance, diction, refined manners). Feeling extraordinary talent in one of his students, Parasha Kovaleva (Praskovya Ivanovna Kovaleva), he gave her more and more attention, preparing for her star career as the future &quot;Praskovya Zhemchugova&quot;, whom he married in 1801.

Sheremetev&#x27;s performances involved Moscow gentlefolk. From a small private theatre of the count P. B. Sheremetev, it grew into a troupe capable of giving &quot;an opera and allegorical ballets&quot;. From the moment of his return from abroad Sheremetev not only watched closely all events of the Moscow theatre life, but on a regular basis he took out the troupe to performances of theatre Medox, and he invited lead actors of Peter theatre (theatre Medox) to teach serf actors. In the beginning of 1790 Sheremetev decided to transfer the serf theatre from Kuskovo to Ostankino. On July 22, 1795 the theatre was opened with the premiere of the heroic opera &quot;The Capture of Izmail&quot; (P. Potemkin&#x27;s libretto, I. Kozlovski&#x27;s music). Sheremetev&#x27;s theatre left far behind numerous other serf troupes (the only exception was the theatre of the Count A. R. Vorontsov).

In 1796 Sheremetev was made a senator, and in March he moved to St. Petersburg to Catherine II&#x27;s court. On November 6, 1796 Catherine died and the throne was inherited by Paul I who gave Sheremetev the title of marshal. Sheremetev&#x27;s life proceeded in St.Petersburg, Pavlovsk, Gatchina; he was engaged in theatre much less. Because of the incurable illness of Zhemchugova, who was now his wife, the Count closed the theatre in Ostankino, and on November 6, 1801 he secretly married her, having first found in an archive the facts testifying to her &quot;origin&quot; from the Polish noble clan of Kovalev. The marriage was made public only after Zhemchugova&#x27;s death (on February 23, 1803). Sheremetev sent a letter to the tsar, informing him about his marriage with a woman &quot;whose origin incontestably had a noble beginning&quot; and about the birth of his son and heir.

Sheremetev died six years later, in 1809. In his will he gave instructions for a very simple funeral, in a simple board coffin, with the money intended for a funeral distributed instead to the poor and monasteries.

<doc id="845012" wikidata="Q223318" url="?curid=845012" title="Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet">
<text>The Boeing F/A-18E and F/A-18F Super Hornet are a series of American supersonic twin-engine, carrier-capable, multirole fighter aircraft derived from the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet. The Super Hornet is in service with the armed forces of the U.S., Australia, and Kuwait. The F/A-18E single-seat and F tandem-seat variants are larger and more advanced versions of the F/A-18C and D Hornet, respectively.

A strike fighter capable of air-to-air and air-to-ground/surface missions, the Super Hornet has an internal 20mm M61A2 rotary cannon and can carry air-to-air missiles, air-to-surface missiles, and a variety of other weapons. Additional fuel can be carried in up to five external fuel tanks and the aircraft can be configured as an airborne tanker by adding an external air-to-air refueling system. Designed and initially produced by McDonnell Douglas, the Super Hornet first flew in 1995. Low-rate production began in early 1997, reaching full-rate production in September 1997, after the merger of McDonnell Douglas and Boeing the previous month. An electronic warfare variant, the EA-18G Growler, was also developed. Although officially named &quot;Super Hornet&quot;, it is commonly referred to as &quot;Rhino&quot; within the U.S. Navy.

The Super Hornet entered operational service with the United States Navy in 2001, supplanting the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, which was retired in 2006; the Super Hornet has served alongside the original Hornet as well. The F/A-18E/F has been used extensively in combat operations in the Middle East, including the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and against the Islamic State and Assad-aligned forces in Syria. The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), which operated the F/A-18A as its main fighter since 1984, ordered the F/A-18F in 2007 to replace its aging General Dynamics F-111C fleet with the RAAF Super Hornets entering service in December 2010.

==Development==

===Origins===

The Super Hornet is an enlarged redesign of the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet. The wing and tail configuration trace its origin to a Northrop prototype aircraft, the P-530, , which began as a rework of the lightweight Northrop F-5E (with a larger wing, twin tail fins and a distinctive leading edge root extension, or LERX). Later flying as the Northrop YF-17 &quot;Cobra&quot;, it competed in the United States Air Force&#x27;s Lightweight Fighter (LWF) program to produce a smaller and simpler fighter to complement the larger McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle; the YF-17 lost the competition to the YF-16.
The Navy directed that the YF-17 be redesigned into the larger F/A-18 Hornet to meet a requirement for a multi-role fighter (VFAX) to complement the larger and more expensive Grumman F-14 Tomcat serving in fleet defense interceptor and air superiority roles. Northrop teamed with McDonnell Douglas to navalize the design, with the latter eventually becoming the prime contractor. The Hornet proved to be effective but limited in combat radius. The concept of an enlarged Hornet was first proposed in the 1980s, which was marketed by McDonnell Douglas as &quot;Hornet 2000&quot;. The &quot;Hornet 2000&quot; concept was an advanced F/A-18 with a larger wing and a longer fuselage to carry more fuel and more powerful engines.

The end of the Cold War led to a period of military budget cuts and considerable restructuring. At the same time, U.S. Naval Aviation faced a number of problems. The McDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger II Advanced Tactical Aircraft (ATA) was canceled in 1991 after the program ran into serious problems; it was intended to replace the obsolete Grumman A-6 Intruder. The Navy then embarked on another attack aircraft program called the Advanced-Attack (A-X), but also considered updating an existing design for an interim capability until A-X could be fielded. Meanwhile, McDonnell Douglas had proposed the &quot;Super Hornet&quot; (initially &quot;&quot;Hornet II&quot; and later &quot;Hornet 2000&quot;&quot; in the 1980s), which could serve as an alternate replacement for the A-6 Intruder or an interim aircraft for A-X; the design would also address some of the limitations of the previous F/A-18 models, such as insufficient bringback capability, or the ability to recover unused weapons aboard aircraft carriers. The next-generation Hornet design proved more attractive than Grumman&#x27;s Quick Strike upgrade to the F-14 Tomcat, which was regarded as an insufficient technological leap over existing F-14s and was opposed by the Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. Furthermore, the A-X, which had evolved into the A/F-X (Advanced Attack/Fighter) due to added fighter capabilities, was canceled in the 1993 Bottom-Up Review as the Super Hornet was viewed as a more attractive low-risk approach to a clean-sheet design due to post-Cold War budget reductions.

At the time, the Grumman F-14 Tomcat was the Navy&#x27;s primary air superiority fighter and fleet defense interceptor. Cheney described the F-14 as 1960s technology, and drastically cut back F-14D procurement in 1989 before cancelling production altogether in 1991, in favor of the updated F/A-18E/F. The decision to replace the Tomcat with an all-Hornet Carrier Air Wing was controversial; Vietnam War ace and Congressman Duke Cunningham criticized the Super Hornet as an unproven design that compromised air superiority. Between 1991 and 1992, the Navy gradually canceled the Navy Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF), which would have been a navalized variant of the Air Force&#x27;s Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor to complement the A-12, due to escalating costs. As a cheaper alternative to NATF, Grumman proposed substantial improvements to the F-14 beyond Quick Strike, but Congress rejected them as too costly and reaffirmed its commitment to the less expensive F/A-18E/F. Originally viewed as an interim for A-X or A/F-X, the Super Hornet would become the mainstay of the Carrier Air Wing.

===Testing and production===
The Super Hornet was first ordered by the U.S. Navy in 1992, and the total Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) cost was capped at $4.88 billion in FY 1990 dollars (~$ in ). The Navy retained the F/A-18 designation to help sell the program to Congress as a low-risk &quot;derivative&quot;, though the Super Hornet is largely a new aircraft. To some extent, the design of the F/A-18E/F was driven by a more cautious development approach favoring incremental improvements over the F/A-18C/D, affordability, and reliability at the expense of raw performance. The Hornet and Super Hornet share many characteristics, including avionics, ejection seats, radar, armament, mission computer software, and maintenance/operating procedures. The Super Hornet&#x27;s F414 engines were derived from the Hornet&#x27;s F404 while also incorporating advances developed for the A-12&#x27;s F412. The initial F/A-18E/F retained most of the avionics systems from the F/A-18C/D&#x27;s configuration at the time to reduce upfront development costs. The design would be expanded in the Super Hornet with an empty weight slightly greater than the F-15C. The division of manufacturing would largely mirror the Hornet&#x27;s, with McDonnell Douglas (later Boeing) responsible for the forward fuselage, wings, and stabilators while Northrop Grumman produced the center/aft fuselage and vertical tails. The design service life was 6,000 flight hours.

The Super Hornet first flew on 29 November 1995. Initial production on the F/A-18E/F began in 1995. Flight testing started in 1996 with the F/A-18E/F&#x27;s first carrier landing in 1997. Low-rate production began in March 1997 with full production beginning in September 1997. Testing continued through 1999, finishing with sea trials and aerial refueling demonstrations, as well as design modifications to resolve &quot;wing drop&quot; and possible stores release interference. Testing involved 3,100 test flights covering 4,600 flight hours. The Super Hornet underwent U.S. Navy operational tests and evaluations in 1999, and was approved in February 2000.
Following the retirement of the F-14 in 2006, all of the Navy&#x27;s combat jets were Hornet variants until the F-35C Lightning II entered service. The F/A-18E single-seat and F/A-18F two-seat aircraft took the place of the F-14 Tomcat, A-6 Intruder, Lockheed S-3 Viking, and KA-6D aircraft. An electronic warfare variant, the EA-18G Growler, replaced the EA-6B Prowler. The Navy calls this reduction in aircraft types a &quot;neck-down&quot;. During the Vietnam War era, the Super Hornet&#x27;s roles were performed by a combination of the A-1/A-4/A-7 (light attack), A-6 (medium attack), F-8/F-4 (fighter), RA-5C (recon), KA-3/KA-6 (tanker), and EA-6 (electronic warfare). It was anticipated that $1 billion in fleetwide annual savings would result from replacing other types with the Super Hornet. The Navy considers the Super Hornet&#x27;s acquisition a success, meeting cost, schedule, and weight (400 lb, 181 kg) below requirement threshold limits.

The total Super Hornet procurement number would fluctuate considerably throughout its production run. The 1997 Department of Defense (DoD) Quadrennial Defense Review cut the originally planned number of around 1,000 by nearly half. By October 2008, Boeing had delivered 367 Super Hornets to the U.S. Navy, but the service was still experiencing a strike fighter shortfall as older aircraft types retired and the procurement rate was not sufficient to replenish the carrier air wings, especially with ongoing combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as substantial delays with the F-35 program. In 2006, the Navy was 60 fighters below its validated requirement. The FY2010 budget bill authorized a multiyear purchase agreement for additional Super Hornets, finalized on 28 September 2010, that reportedly saved $600 million over individual yearly contracts. This contract for 66 Super Hornets and 58 Growlers was intended to mitigate a four-year delay in the F-35 program. In 2019, Boeing received a $4 billion contract to deliver 78 Block III Super Hornets for the Navy through fiscal 2021. The Navy plans to sign year to year contracts to convert all of its Block II aircraft to Block III variants through 2033. As the F-35 began entering service, Boeing announced plans to end Super Hornet production in 2025, later extended to 2027 with an additional 17 orders from the U.S. Navy.

===Improvements and changes===
The Block II Super Hornet incorporates an improved active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, larger displays, the joint helmet mounted cueing system, and several other avionics replacements. Avionics and weapons systems that were under development for the prospective production version of the Boeing X-32 were used on the Block II Super Hornet. New-build aircraft received the APG-79 AESA radar beginning in 2005. In January 2008, it was announced that 135 earlier production aircraft were to be retrofitted with AESA radars.

In 2008, Boeing discussed the development of a Super Hornet Block III with the U.S. and Australian military, featuring additional stealth capabilities and extended range. The airframe is strengthened to increase service life to 10,000 flight hours, and some Block II aircraft can be modified to achieve this as well. In 2010, Boeing offered prospective Super Hornet customers the &quot;International Roadmap&quot;, which included conformal fuel tanks, enhanced engines, an enclosed weapons pod (EWP), a next-generation cockpit, a new missile warning system, and an internal infrared search and track (IRST) system; the IRST was later mounted on the centerline external tank. The EWP has four internal stations for munitions, a single aircraft can carry a total of three EWPs, housing up to 12 AMRAAMs and 2 Sidewinders. The next-generation cockpit features a 19 x 11-inch touch-sensitive display. In 2011, Boeing received a US Navy contract to develop a new mission computer.
In 2007, Boeing stated that a passive Infrared Search and Track (IRST) sensor would be an available future option. The sensor, mounted in a modified centerline fuel tank, detects long wave IR emissions to spot and track targets such as aircraft; combat using the IRST and AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles is immune to radar jamming. In May 2009, Lockheed Martin announced its selection by Boeing for the IRST&#x27;s technology development phase, and a contract followed in November 2011. , a basic IRST would be fielded in 2016 and a longer-range Block II version in 2019. The sensor would be designated the AN/ASG-34(V) IRST21. An F/A-18F performed a flight equipped with the IRST system in February 2014, and Milestone C approval authorizing low-rate initial production (LRIP) was granted in December 2014. The sequestration cuts in 2013 would cause years of delay, and the Navy chose to skip the basic version and transition directly to the Block II IRST for operational service. After production quality issues, the IRST became operational in January 2025.

====Advanced Super Hornet====
Boeing and Northrop Grumman self-funded a prototype of the Advanced Super Hornet. The prototype features a 50% reduction in frontal radar cross-section (RCS), conformal fuel tanks (CFT), and an enclosed weapons pod. Features could also be integrated onto the EA-18G Growler: using CFTs on the EA-18G fleet was speculated as useful for relieving underwing space and lowering the drag margin for the Next Generation Jammer. Flight tests of the Advanced Super Hornet began on 5 August 2013 and continued for three weeks, testing the performance of CFTs, the enclosed weapons pod (EWP), and signature enhancements. The U.S. Navy was reportedly pleased with the Advanced Super Hornet&#x27;s flight test results, and hopes it will provide future procurement options. Although the Advanced Super Hornet was not pursued, many elements would be transferred to the Block III.

In 2013, the U.S. Navy was considering the widespread adoption of CFTs, which would allow the Super Hornet to carry of additional fuel. Budgetary pressures from the F-35C Lightning II and Pacific region operations were cited as reasons supporting the use of CFTs. Flight testing demonstrated CFTs could slightly reduce drag while expanding the combat range by . The prototype CFT weighed , while production CFTs are expected to weigh . Boeing stated that the CFTs do not add any cruise drag but acknowledged a negative impact imposed on transonic acceleration due to increased wave drag. General Electric&#x27;s enhanced performance engine (EPE), increasing the F414-GE-400&#x27;s power output by 20%, was suggested as a mitigating measure. In 2021, the U.S. Navy halted plans to fit CFTs as standard on all Block III Super Hornets due to cost, schedule, and performance issues.

In 2009, development commenced on several engine improvements, including greater resistance to foreign object damage, reduced fuel burn rate, and potentially increased thrust of up to 20%. In 2014, Boeing revealed a Super Hornet hybrid concept, equipped with the EA-18G Growler&#x27;s electronic signal detection capabilities to allow for targets engagement using the receiver; the concept did not include the ALQ-99 jamming pod. Growth capabilities could include the addition of a long-range infrared search and track sensor and new air-to-air tracking modes.

==Design==
===Overview===
The Super Hornet is largely a new aircraft at about 20% larger, heavier empty weight, and heavier maximum weight than the original Hornet. The Super Hornet carries 33% more internal fuel, increasing mission range by 41% and endurance by 50% over the &quot;Legacy&quot; Hornet. The empty weight of the Super Hornet is about less than that of the F-14 Tomcat which it replaced, while approaching, but not matching, the F-14&#x27;s payload and range. Although lacking some of the F-14&#x27;s raw performance, the F/A-18E/F has much better handling characteristics and controllability and was also significantly more reliable and affordable to operate. With the Super Hornet being significantly heavier than the legacy Hornet, the catapult and arresting systems must be set differently. To aid safe flight operations and prevent confusion in radio calls, the Super Hornet is informally referred to as the &quot;Rhino&quot; to distinguish it from earlier Hornets partly because of the AN/APX-111 &quot;pizza box&quot; IFF antenna protruding on top of the nose. (The &quot;Rhino&quot; nickname was previously applied to the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, which was retired from US Navy combat use in 1987.)

The Super Hornet, unlike the previous Hornet, can be equipped with an aerial refueling system (ARS) or &quot;buddy store&quot; for the refueling of other aircraft, filling the tactical airborne tanker role the Navy had lost with the retirement of the KA-6D and Lockheed S-3B Viking tankers. The ARS includes an external tank with hose reel on the centerline, along with four external tanks and internal tanks, for a total of of fuel on the aircraft. On typical missions a fifth of the air wing is dedicated to the tanker role, which consumes aircraft fatigue life expectancy faster than other missions. It most commonly uses JP-5 jet fuel.

===Airframe changes===
The forward fuselage is unchanged, but the remainder of the aircraft shares little with earlier F/A-18C/D models. The fuselage was stretched by to make room for fuel and future avionics upgrades and increased the wing area by 25%, yet the Super Hornet has 42% fewer structural parts than the original Hornet. The wings have a dogtooth extension and a strip of porous surface at the folding joint to mitigate &quot;wing drop&quot;. The General Electric F414 engine, developed from the Hornet&#x27;s F404, has 35% additional thrust over most of the flight envelope and is rated at in afterburner. The Super Hornet can return to an aircraft carrier with a larger load of unspent fuel and munitions than the Hornet; this ability is known as &quot;bringback&quot;, which for the Super Hornet is in excess of .
Other differences include larger rectangular caret inlets with fixed ramps for the more powerful engines and two extra wing hard points for payload (for a total of 11), retaining previous hardpoints on the bottom centerline, wingtips, and two conformal fuselage positions. Among the most significant aerodynamic changes are the enlarged leading edge extensions (LEX) that provide improved vortex lifting characteristics in high angle of attack maneuvers, and reduce the static stability margin to enhance pitching characteristics. This modification results in pitch rates in excess of 40 degrees per second, and high resistance to departure from controlled flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boeing_E/F&quot;&gt;&quot;F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.&quot; Boeing. Retrieved: 16 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to concerns over released stores potentially striking the airframe from early wind tunnel testing, all underwing pylons are canted outwards slightly; although this was later determined to be unnecessary, production tooling had already been adjusted so the canted pylons remained to save development costs and revalidating all flight testing. While the effects are marginal for cruise drag, they are more substantial for transonic and supersonic drag.

===Radar signature reduction measures===

Survivability is a key feature of the Super Hornet. The U.S. Navy took a &quot;balanced approach&quot; to survivability in its design. It does not rely primarily on low-observability technology, but rather adopts improvements to its radar signature alongside other innovations; incorporating more advanced electronic warfare capabilities, reduced ballistic vulnerability, and greater employment of standoff weapons to collectively enhance crew and aircraft safety. While the F/A-18E/F is not a stealth fighter like the F-22, it does have a frontal radar cross-section (RCS) an order of magnitude smaller than prior generation fighters. Additional changes for reducing RCS can be installed on an as-needed basis.

The F/A-18E/F&#x27;s RCS is reduced greatly from some aspects, mainly the front and rear. The design of the caret engine inlets reduces the aircraft&#x27;s frontal radar cross-section, with the alignment of the leading edges of the inlets designed to scatter radiation to the sides. Fixed fanlike reflecting structures in the inlet tunnel divert radar energy away from the rotating fan blades. The Super Hornet also makes considerable use of panel joint serration and edge alignment to direct reflected waves away from the aircraft in uniformly narrow angles. Considerable attention is paid to the removal or filling of unnecessary surface join gaps and resonant cavities. Where the F/A-18A-D used grilles to cover various accessory exhaust and inlet ducts, the F/A-18E/F uses perforated panels that appear opaque to radar waves at the frequencies used.

===Avionics===
Initially, the Super Hornet&#x27;s avionics and software had a 90% commonality with that of the F/A-18C/D fleet at the time, with further upgraded avionics introduced in successive Blocks. Differences include an up-front touchscreen control display; a large multipurpose color liquid-crystal display; and a fuel display. The Super Hornet has a quadruplex digital fly-by-wire system, as well as a digital flight-control system that detects and corrects for battle damage. Initial production models used the APG-73 radar, later replaced by the AN/APG-79 active electronically scanned array (AESA). The AN/ASQ-228 ATFLIR (Advanced Targeting Forward Looking InfraRed), is the main electro-optical sensor and laser designator pod for the Super Hornet. The communications equipment consist of an AN/ARC-210 VHF/UHF radio and a MIDS-JTRS low volume terminal for HAVE QUICK, SINCGARS and Link 16 connectivity.

The defensive countermeasures of Block I aircraft includes the AN/ALR-67(V)3 radar warning receiver, the AN/ALE-47 countermeasures dispenser, the AN/ALE-50 towed decoy and the AN/ALQ-165 Airborne Self-Protect Jammer (ASPJ). Block II aircraft replace the ALQ-165 with the AN/ALQ-214 Integrated Defensive Countermeasures (IDECM) system, consisting of internally mounted threat receivers and optional self-protection jammers. Interior and exterior lighting on the Block II was changed to allow the use of night vision devices. The older ALE-50 decoys are being replaced by ALE-55 towed decoys, which can transmit jamming signals based on data received from the IDECM.

Beginning in 2005, Block II aircraft were fitted with the AN/APG-79 AESA radar, capable of executing simultaneous air-to-air and air-to-ground attacks, and providing higher quality high-resolution ground mapping at long standoff ranges. The AESA radar can also detect smaller targets, such as inbound missiles and can track air targets beyond the range of the aircraft&#x27;s air-to-air missiles. VFA-213, the first squadron to fly AESA-equipped Super Hornets, became &quot;safe for flight&quot; (independently fly and maintain the F/A-18F) on 27 October 2006. The first Super Hornet upgraded with the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) was delivered to VFA-213 on 18 May 2007. The JHMCS provides multi-purpose situational awareness, which includes high-off-boresight missile cuing. The Shared Reconnaissance Pod (SHARP) is a high-resolution, digital tactical aerial reconnaissance system that features advanced day/night and all-weather capability. The Multifunctional Information Distribution System low volume communication terminal is being upgraded with the MIDS-JTRS system, which will allow a tenfold increase in bandwidth as well as compatibility with the Joint Tactical Radio System standards.

The avionics of Block III aircraft, first delivered in 2021, incorporates an improved cockpit with all MFDs replaced by a large-area touchscreen display, updated integration and targeting networks, an updated processor, and an open mission systems architecture. Block II aircraft can be upgraded to the Block III configuration. For passive infrared detection and targeting, the aircraft can carry the AN/ASG-34(V)1 IRST21 sensor contained in a modified centerline FPU-13 external fuel tank; the sensor occupies for forward portion of the tank, reducing its capacity to 340 gallons. The ATFLIR is planned to be replaced by the AN/AAQ-28(V) Litening targeting pod.

==Operational history==
===United States Navy===
In 1999, the Super Hornet entered fleet service with the U.S. Navy. It achieved initial operating capability (IOC) in September 2001 with the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Strike Fighter Squadron 115 (VFA-115) at Naval Air Station Lemoore, California. VFA-115 was also the first unit to take their F/A-18s into combat. On 6 November 2002, two F/A-18Es conducted a &quot;Response Option&quot; strike in support of Operation Southern Watch on two surface-to-air missile launchers at Al Kut, Iraq and an air defense command and control bunker at Tallil air base. One of the pilots dropped JDAM bombs from the Super Hornet for the first time during combat.

In support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (Iraq War), VFA-14, VFA-41 and VFA-115 flew close air support, strike, escort, SEAD and aerial refueling sorties. Two F/A-18Es from VFA-14 and two F/A-18Fs from VFA-41 were forward deployed to . The VFA-14 aircraft flew mostly as aerial refuelers and the VFA-41 fighters as Forward Air Controller (Airborne) or FAC(A)s. On 6 April 2005, VFA-154 and VFA-147 (the latter squadron then still operating F/A-18Cs) dropped two laser-guided bombs on an enemy insurgent location east of Baghdad. 
On 8 September 2006, VFA-211 F/A-18Fs expended GBU-12 and GBU-38 bombs against Taliban fighters and Taliban fortifications west and northwest of Kandahar. This was the first time the unit had participated in an active combat capacity using the Super Hornet.
During the 2006–2007 cruise with , VFA-103 and VFA-143 supported Operations Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom and operations off the Somali coast. Alongside &quot;Legacy Hornet&quot; squadrons, VFA-131 and VFA-83, they dropped 140 precision guided weapons and performed nearly 70 strafing runs. The Super Hornet can operate from the French aircraft carrier .&lt;ref name=&quot;F/A 18E-CDG&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
On 7 August 2014, U.S. defense officials announced they had been authorized to launch bombing missions upon Islamic State (IS) forces in northern Iraq. The decision to take direct action was made to protect U.S. personnel in the city of Irbil and to ensure the safety of transport aircraft making airdrops to Yazidi civilians. Early on 8 August, two Super Hornets took off from and dropped 500 lb laser-guided bombs on a &quot;mobile artillery piece&quot; the militants had been using to shell Kurdish forces defending the city. Later that day, four more aircraft struck a seven-vehicle convoy and a mortar position.
On 18 June 2017, a U.S. Navy F/A-18E shot down a Syrian Air Force Su-22 fighter-bomber that allegedly had bombed a position held by U.S.-supported Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) near Tabqa; the Syrian government claimed the Su-22 was bombing an IS position. This was the first aerial kill of a crewed aircraft by an American fighter since 1999, the first by the Navy since the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the first kill by a Super Hornet, and the third kill by an F/A-18. An E-3 Sentry issued several warnings to the Su-22 and, after it dropped bombs near SDF fighters, the F/A-18E, piloted by Lieutenant Commander Michael &quot;MOB&quot; Tremel, a pilot assigned to Strike Fighter Squadron 87 aboard the carrier &quot;George H.W. Bush&quot;, independently chose to shoot it down based on established rules of engagement. The F/A-18E first missed with an AIM-9X Sidewinder, then hit the Su-22 with an AIM-120 AMRAAM; the encounter lasted eight minutes.

In 2018, Boeing was awarded a contract to convert nine single-seat F/A-18E Super Hornets and two F/A-18F two-seaters for Blue Angels use; these were to be completed by 2021.

On 26 December 2023, Super Hornets from USS &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot;, along with the accompanying destroyer , destroyed 12 attack drones, three anti-ship missiles and two ground attack cruise missiles fired by Houthi forces in the southern Red Sea. Around 2:30 AM local time on 12 January 2024, Houthi targets were struck by U.S. Navy, USAF, and RAF forces in response to Houthi attacks against commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Super Hornets from &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; took part in the strikes, which in total hit 60 targets at 16 locations using over 100 PGMs of various types. On 22 December 2024, an F/A-18F Super Hornet from VFA-11 was shot down by in a friendly fire incident. Both crewmembers of the aircraft survived.

===Royal Australian Air Force===
On 3 May 2007, the Australian Government signed a $2.9 billion contract to acquire 24 F/A-18Fs as an interim replacement for the Royal Australian Air Force&#x27;s (RAAF) aging F-111s. It was reported that the order would also address any difficulties that might be caused by a need to quickly replace the RAAF&#x27;s existing fleet of classic F/A-18A/B Hornets in the event of delays to the F-35 program. The total cost of the purchase, with training and support over 10 years, was expected to be A$6 billion (US$4.6 billion).
The order was controversial; Air Vice Marshal (retired) Peter Criss, said that he was &quot;absolutely astounded&quot; that $6 billion would be spent on an interim aircraft, and cited the US Senate Armed Services Committee, to the effect that the &quot;excess power&quot; of the Block I Super Hornet was inferior to that of the MiG-29 and Su-30, both of which were being operated by, or were on order for, air forces in South East Asia. Another former senior RAAF officer, Air Commodore (ret.) Ted Bushell stated that the F/A-18F could not perform the strategic deterrent/strike role of the F-111C and the latter could continue to operate until 2020 at least. On 31 December 2007, the new Australian Labor government announced a review of the RAAF&#x27;s aircraft procurement plans citing suitability concerns, the lack of a proper review process, and beliefs that an interim fighter was not needed.

On 17 March 2008, the Government announced that it would proceed to acquire 24 F/A-18Fs. Defence Minister Joel Fitzgibbon called the Super Hornet an &quot;excellent aircraft&quot;, and indicated that costs and logistical factors contributed to the decision: the F-111&#x27;s retirement was &quot;irreversible&quot;; &quot;only&quot; the F/A-18F could meet the timeframe and that termination involved &quot;significant financial penalties and create understandable tensions between the contract partners.&quot; The Block II aircraft offered include installed engines and six spares, APG-79 AESA radars, Link 16 connectivity, LAU-127 guided missile launchers, AN/ALE-55 fiber optic towed decoys and other equipment. On 27 February 2009, Fitzgibbon announced that 12 of the 24 F/A-18Fs would be wired on the production line for future modification as Boeing EA-18G Growlers at an additional cost of A$35 million. The final decision on the EA-18G conversion, at a cost of A$300 million, would be made in 2012.

The first RAAF F/A-18F made its first flight from Boeing&#x27;s factory in St. Louis, Missouri, on 21 July 2009. RAAF crews began training in the U.S. in 2009. The first five F/A-18Fs arrived at their home base, RAAF Base Amberley in Queensland, on 26 March 2010; and were joined by six more aircraft on 7 July 2010. After four more aircraft arrived in December 2010, the first RAAF F/A-18F squadron was declared operational on 9 December 2010.

In 2008, U.S. export approval was sought for EA-18G Growlers. In December 2012, Australia sought cost information on acquiring a further 24 F/A-18Fs, which may be bought to avoid a capability gap due to F-35 delays. In February 2013, the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of a possible Foreign Military Sale to Australia for up to 12 F/A-18E/Fs and 12 EA-18Gs with associated equipment, training and logistical support. In May 2013, Australia announced the order of 12 new EA-18Gs instead of converting any F/A-18Fs. In June 2014, Boeing received a contract for 12 EA-18Gs; the first was rolled out on 29 July 2015.

On 24 September 2014, eight RAAF F/A-18Fs, along with a KC-30A tanker, an early warning aircraft, and 400 personnel arrived in the United Arab Emirates to take part in operations against Islamic State (IS) militants. On 5 October 2014, the RAAF officially started combat missions over Iraq using a pair of F/A-18Fs armed with GPS guided bombs, they returned safely to base without attacking targets. On 8 October 2014, an RAAF F/A-18F conducted its first attack, dropping two bombs on an ISIL facility in northern Iraq. In 2017, EA-18Gs replaced No. 6 Squadron RAAF&#x27;s F/A-18Fs, which were then transferred to No. 1 Squadron RAAF.

On 8 December 2020, F/A-18F A44-223 rolled into a ditch while attempting to take off at RAAF Base Amberley, the crew ejected. An eyewitness reportedly observed smoke from one of the engines. A day after the incident, the RAAF grounded the fleet of 24 Super Hornets and 11 Growlers while the incident was investigated. The cause was determined to be pilot error. The Super Hornet was repaired, and returned to service in mid-2021.

===Kuwait Air Force===
In May 2015, the Kuwait Air Force was reportedly planning to order 28 F/A-18E/Fs with options for an additional 12. However, in June 2015, it was reported that Kuwait was considering a split purchase between the Eurofighter Typhoon and the F/A-18E/F. On 11 September 2015, Kuwait signed an agreement for 28 Eurofighters. In November 2016, a proposed Kuwaiti sale of 32 F/A-18E and 8 F/A-18F fighters, armaments, and associated equipment was approved by the U.S. State Department.

In June 2018, the Kuwaiti Government ordered 22 F/A-18Es and 6 F/A-18Fs via a US$1.5 billion contract. The aircraft were scheduled to be delivered by January 2021, but were rescheduled to be delivered later due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Potential operators===
Boeing has pitched the F/A-18E/F to numerous countries, particularly those that operate the legacy Hornet as it was supposed to be a &quot;logical progression from the Hornet to the [Super Hornet], with its logistics, weaponry and training commonalities&quot;. So far only the US Navy, Australia, and Kuwait have ordered and received the Super Hornet.

====Malaysia====
Boeing offered Malaysia Super Hornets as part of a buy-back package for its existing Hornets in 2002. However, the procurement was halted in 2007 after the government decided to purchase the Sukhoi Su-30MKM instead; Chief Gen. Datuk Nik Ismail Nik Mohamaed of the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) indicated that the air force had not planned to end the Super Hornet buy, stating that such fighters were needed. Separately, the Super Hornet is a contender for the MRCA program, under which the RMAF seek to equip three squadrons with 36 to 40 new fighters with an estimated budget of RM6 billion to RM8 billion (US$1.84 billion to US$2.46 billion). Other competitors are the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale and Saab JAS 39 Gripen.

===Failed bids===

====Belgium====
On 12 March 2014, Belgian newspaper &quot;De Morgen&quot; reported that Boeing was in talks with the Belgian Ministry of Defence about the Super Hornet as a candidate to replace Belgium&#x27;s aging F-16 fleet. In April 2017, Boeing announced it would not compete in the competition, citing it &quot;does not see an opportunity to compete on a truly level playing field&quot;. On 25 October 2018, Belgium officially selected the offer for 34 F-35As to replace its fleet of around 54 F-16s.

====Brazil====
Boeing proposed the Super Hornet to the Brazilian government in response to an initial requirement for 36 aircraft, with a potential total purchase of 120. In October 2008, the Super Hornet was reportedly selected as one of three finalists in Brazil&#x27;s fighter competition. However, news of National Security Agency spying on Brazilian leaders caused animosity between Brazil and the US. Brazil eventually dropped the Super Hornet from its final list and selected the Saab JAS 39 Gripen in December 2013.

====Canada====
The Super Hornet was a contender to replace the CF-18 Hornet, a version of the F/A-18A and B models, operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force. Like the older Hornet, the Super Hornet&#x27;s design is well-suited to Northern Canada&#x27;s rugged forward operational airfields, while its extended range removes its predecessor&#x27;s main deficiency while commonalities enable a straightforward transition. In 2010, Canada decided on sole source selection of the F-35A. Boeing claimed that Canada had ignored the Super Hornet&#x27;s radar cross-section characteristics during evaluation. By April 2012, Canada was reportedly reviewing its F-35 procurement. In September 2013, Boeing provided Canada with data on its Advanced Super Hornet, suggesting that 65 aircraft would cost $1.7 billion less than an F-35 fleet. The US Navy buys Super Hornets for $52 million per aircraft, while the advanced model costs $6–$10 million more per aircraft, dependent on options selected.

The Liberal government elected in 2015 indicated that it would launch a competition to replace the CF-18 fleet. During the election, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau stated that his government would not buy the F-35. On 22 November 2016, the government announced its intention to acquire 18 Super Hornets on an interim basis. In September 2017, the U.S. State Department granted Canada permission to buy 10 F/A-18Es and 8 F/A-18Fs (or EA-18Gs) along with supporting equipment, spares, and armaments; the agreed cost totaled CA$1.5 billion, or about CA$83.3 million per aircraft, adding the supporting equipment, training, spares, and weapons increased the acquisition cost to CA$6.3 billion. However, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned that the pending Super Hornet sale, along with a possible sale of another 70, was adversely affected by Boeing&#x27;s actions against Bombardier Aerospace, such as a complaint to the US government over the sale of CSeries airliners to Delta Air Lines at unduly low prices; in September 2017, the U.S. Department of Commerce proposed a 219% tariff on CSeries imported into the US. In January 2018, the USITC commissioners unanimously ruled against Boeing that the U.S. industry is not threatened and no duties will be imposed.

In late 2017, the Canadian Government agreed with Australia to purchase 18 used F/A-18 Hornets as an interim measure. Boeing confirmed its bid for the Advanced Fighter Program, likely offering a mix of 88 F/A-18E/F Advanced Super Hornets (Block III) and Boeing EA-18G Growlers. On 25 November 2021, Reuters reported that Boeing is out of the competition since its fighter proposal does not meet requirements with the F-35 and Saab JAS 39 Gripen remaining in competition.

====Denmark====
In 2008, the Royal Danish Air Force was offered the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet as one of three fighters in a Danish competition to replace 48 F-16AM/BMs. The other contenders were the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter and the Eurofighter Typhoon. Denmark is a level-3 partner in the JSF program. The final selection was originally planned for mid-2015 where 24 to 30 fighters were expected. In April 2014, the Danish Ministry of Defence handed over a Request for Binding Information (RBI) that specifically listed the F/A-18F two-seat variant. In December 2015, the decision was postponed to 2016, with the final order&#x27;s details pending negotiations. In May 2016, the Danish government recommended to parliament that 27 F-35As should be procured instead of 38 Super Hornets.

In September 2016, Boeing indicated that they would take legal action against the Danish F-35A buy, indicating that flawed data was used. In March 2018, Boeing lost the case with the court stating &quot;The court has found that the authorities&#x27; decisions on refusal of access to the documents are legal and valid.&quot;

====Finland====
In June 2015, a working group set up by the Finnish MoD proposed starting the HX Fighter Program to replace the Finnish Air Force&#x27;s current fleet of F/A-18C/D Hornets, which will reach the end of their service life by the end of the 2020s. The group recognised five potential types: Boeing F/A-18E/F Advanced Super Hornet, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II and Saab JAS 39 Gripen. In May 2016, the DOD announced that Boeing (with the Super Hornet) and Lockheed Martin (with the F-35) would respond to the information request. This request was sent in early 2016 with five responses received in November 2016. A call for tender will be sent in spring 2018 and the buying decision is scheduled to take place in 2021.

In February 2020, three Super Hornets (a single-seat F/A-18E, a twin-seat F/A-18F and an EA-18G) arrived at the Tampere-Pirkkala Airbase in Finland for final flight evaluations. The evaluations concluded on 28 February 2020. The Finnish newspaper &quot;Iltalehti&quot; reported that several foreign and security policy sources had confirmed the Finnish Defense Forces recommendation of the F-35, citing its capability and expected long lifespan as key reasons. Finland ordered the F-35 in February 2022.

====Germany====
Germany requires a replacement for its aging Panavia Tornado fleet, including both Tornado IDS (interdictor/strike) and ECR (Electronic Combat/Reconnaissance) variants. Germany considered ordering the Lockheed Martin F-35, Eurofighter Typhoon, and the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler. In April 2020, Germany&#x27;s defense secretary announced a replacement plan for a split purchase of 30 Super Hornets, 15 EA-18Gs and 55 Typhoons. However, the Defense Ministry states this is not finalized and it is being debated. As of March 2020, the Super Hornet was not certified for the B61 nuclear bombs, but Dan Gillian, Super Hornet program head, previously stated that &quot;We certainly think that we, working with the U.S. government, can meet the German requirements...&quot;

With increased tensions in Europe, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine beginning 24 February 2022, Germany scrambled to accelerate defense spending priorities. Newly elected Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledged a €100 billion military upgrade, which included selecting the F-35 instead of the Super Hornet for the nuclear role and Eurofighter ECR/SEAD instead of the Growler.

====India====
For India&#x27;s MMRCA competition, Boeing offered a customized variant called F/A-18IN, which included Raytheon&#x27;s APG-79 AESA radar. In August 2008, Boeing submitted an industrial participation proposal detailing partnerships with companies in India. The Indian Air Force (IAF) extensively evaluated the Super Hornet, including field trials in August 2009. However, in April 2011, the IAF eliminated the F/A-18IN from the competition which was eventually won by the Dassault Rafale.
In October 2016, India reportedly received three unsolicited bids, including one from Boeing for the Super Hornet, to replace its MiG-21 and MiG-27 aircraft. In February 2018, the Indian Naval Air Arm was reportedly interested in the Super Hornet as the main carrier-based strike fighter of the in-development &quot;Vishal&quot;-class aircraft carrier. In December 2020, Boeing announced the successful launch of the aircraft from a ski-jump, emphasizing its compatibility with the Indian Navy&#x27;s STOBAR carriers. In May 2022, two Super Hornets were sent to Goa to showcase compatibility with Indian aircraft carriers. There are technical aspects that would make the Rafale difficult to implement for the , and would favor the Super Hornet over the Rafale.

The aircraft is now competing with six others in a fresh tender, referred as MMRCA 2.0, for the procurement of 114 multi-role combat aircraft for the IAF.

In July 2023, the Indian Ministry of Defence revealed that the Defence Acquisition Council had granted Acceptance of Necessity for 22 Dassault Rafale M fighters and 4 Dassault Rafale DH conversion trainers for the Indian Navy. The Rafale was chosen over the Super Hornet due to their commonality with the Rafale aircraft operated by the Indian Air Force, as well as availability to integrate Indian origin systems into the aircraft. The aircraft would complement the existing fleet of Navy Mikoyan MiG-29K aircraft, to be later joined by the Indian built Twin Engine Deck Based Fighter. The aircraft would be operated on the Indian aircraft carriers INS &quot;Vikramaditya&quot; and INS &quot;Vikrant&quot;.

====Poland====

During the 2010s, Poland sought to purchase 64 multirole combat aircraft from 2021 to replace the Polish Air Force&#x27;s fleet of Sukhoi Su-22M4 ground attack aircraft and Mikoyan MiG-29 fighters. In November 2017, the Armament Inspectorate launched the acquisition process. On 22 December 2017, five entities expressed interest in participating in the market analysis phase of the procurement, referred to as &quot;Harpia&quot; (harpy eagle); they included Saab (Gripen NG), Lockheed Martin (F-35), Boeing (F/A-18), Leonardo (Eurofighter Typhoon) and Fights-On Logistics (second-hand F-16). On 28 May 2019, the Polish Defense Ministry formally requested to buy 32 F-35As.

====Switzerland====

Boeing first offered the Super Hornet to the Swiss Air Force as a replacement for Swiss F-5E Tigers before withdrawing from the competition on 30 April 2008. The Swiss Air Force was at one point intending to buy the rival Saab Gripen, but this was blocked by Swiss voters in 2014. In March 2018, Swiss officials named contenders in its Air 2030 program: The Saab Gripen, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Lockheed Martin F-35. The program has a budget of but includes not only combat aircraft but also ground-based air defense systems. In October 2018, it was reported by Jane&#x27;s that the Swiss Air Force may be limited to purchasing a single-engine fighter due to cost. The F/A-18E/F performed demonstrations for Swiss personnel at Payerne Air Base in April 2019, which was contrasted to flights performed by other bidders.

On 30 June 2021, the Swiss Federal Council proposed buying 36 F-35As to Parliament at a cost of up to 6 billion Swiss francs (US$6.5 billion), citing the aircraft&#x27;s cost and combat effectiveness. The anti-military group GSoA intended to contest the purchase in another national referendum supported by the Green Party of Switzerland and the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland (which previously acted to block the Gripen). In August 2022, they registered the initiative, with 120,000 people having signed in less than a year (with 100,000 required). On 26 November 2021, it was announced that Armasuisse had agreed terms with the US government for 36 F-35As for CHF 6.035 billion. The order was then subject to parliamentary approval and the popular initiative not proceeding or failing. A parliamentary inquiry found the purchase worrisome but legal. The government did not wait for the popular initiative to proceed, which was legally permitted. On 15 September 2022, the Swiss National council gave the Federal council permission to sign the purchase deal. The deal to buy 36 F-35A was signed on 19 September 2022, with deliveries to commence in 2027 and conclude by 2030.

====Spain====
By 2018, Spain sought 68-72 fighters to replace its F/A-18A/B Hornets; tender participants included the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, Boeing F/A-18 E/F Advanced Super Hornet, and Lockheed F-35 Lightning II. On 22 June 2022, Spain ordered 20 Tranche 4 Typhoons to replace the 20 ex-USN F/A-18s based at the Canary Islands.

====United States Marine Corps====
The United States Marine Corps (USMC) avoided the Super Hornet program over fears that any purchased F/A-18s would be at the cost of the F-35B STOVL fighters that they intend to operate from amphibious ships. Resistance is so high that they would rather fly former Navy F/A-18Cs. In 2011, the USMC agreed to eventually equip five Marine fighter-attack squadrons (VMFA) with the F-35C carrier variant to continue to augment Navy carrier air wings as they do with the F/A-18C.

====Others====

On 10 March 2009, Boeing offered the Super Hornet for Greece&#x27;s Next-Generation Fighter Program.

On 1 August 2010, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that the British government was considering canceling orders for the F-35B and buying the Super Hornet instead for its s, claiming a saving of around £10 billion as a result. An industry source claimed that the Super Hornet could be ski jump launched without catapults. In the end, the UK opted for a STOVL aircraft carrier equipped with F-35Bs.

The United Arab Emirates was reported to have asked for information on the Super Hornet in 2010.

In early 2011, Bulgaria was considering the F/A-18 as a replacement for its MiG-21 fleet. After initially selecting the Saab Gripen, the newly elected governing coalition restarted the program and indicated that the Super Hornet is again under consideration. The decision is expected by July 2018. In December 2018, the Bulgarian Ministry of Defence selected the offer for 8 F-16V from the United States for an estimated 1.8 billion lev ($1.05 billion) as the preferred option, and recommended the government to start talks with the US.

In 2012, Norway received an offer for at least one squadron of F/A-18s, noting its suitability to Northern Norwegian conditions.

In 2014, Boeing worked with Korean Airlines to offer the Advanced Super Hornet to the Republic of Korea Air Force as an alternative to their KF-X fighter program. Although a fighter based on the Super Hornet would save money, downgrading the program would not give South Korean industry as much knowledge as it would from developing a new fighter.

==Notable accidents==
* On 6 April 2011, a U.S. Navy F/A-18F from VFA-122 Tactical Demonstration team crashed, killing both crew members. The crash occurred when the crew attempted to perform a loaded roll with too much speed and insufficient angle-of-attack. The loaded roll has since been removed from the Navy&#x27;s F/A-18F flight demonstration routine.
* On 31 July 2019, a U.S. Navy F/A-18E from VFA-151 crashed into the side of &quot;Star Wars Canyon&quot; in California, killing the pilot and injuring seven French civilian sightseers at the Father Crowley Vista Point 40 feet above the impact point. The crash was attributed to flying &quot;too fast and too low with respect to the surrounding terrain&quot;. Military training within the canyon has since been suspended, with standing instructions to stay above the rim of the canyon.
* On 22 December 2024, a U.S. Navy F/A-18F took off from aircraft carrier operating in the Red Sea and was hit by friendly SM-2 surface-to-air missile fired from operating in the same area. The two pilots onboard ejected with minor injuries and were rescued.

<text>The Ballard Bridge, also known as the 15th Avenue Bridge, is a double-leaf bascule bridge in Seattle, Washington. It carries 15th Avenue NW over Seattle&#x27;s Salmon Bay between Ballard to the north and Interbay to the south. The Ballard Bridge follows the Fremont Bridge in the east in the succession of bridges spanning the Lake Washington Ship Canal, which connects Lake Washington in the east to Puget Sound in the west.

Built in 1917, it has an opening span of and a total length of . The approaches of the bridge were originally timber trestles. It also carried a streetcar. In 1939, the timber approach spans of the Ballard Bridge were replaced as a Public Works Administration project. The deck was surfaced with concrete and the rails for the streetcar were removed. In 1982, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

In recent years bicyclists have complained that improvements are needed to address safety concerns.

In 2024, work began on seismic improvements to the bridge structure, including installing ground anchors and other safety features. The project shut down the bridge to vehicular traffic over several weekends in September and October.

<text>Ward End is an area of Birmingham, England. It covers the area between Saltley, Hodge Hill and Stechford and includes Ward End Park, a public park that has been open for over 100 years.

==Ward End territory==
Pelham in Ward End joins with Alum Rock Ward End starts by Ward End Park on the Washwood Heath Road and finishes at the Fox and Goose public house.

==The Fox &amp; Goose==

The Fox &amp; Goose, a pub and shopping area is situated in the eastern part of Ward End and marks the boundary with Stechford and Hodge Hill.

==Ward End Park==

The park, opened in 1904, covers a large part of Ward End. A typical English park, it is heavily populated in the summer months. Ward End Park House is located within the park and dates back to 1759.

The park also has two large multi-sports practice courts, two professional cricket nets, two large play sections and a car park.

==Secondary schools==

The secondary school which served this area from 1958 was Ward End Hall Secondary Modern; later known as Ward End Hall County Secondary School, before finally being renamed Park View Upper School in 1983 when it catered solely for 4th and 5th year senior pupils, and sixth-formers (or Year 10, 11, 12 and 13s as they are known these days). Park View Lower School was the name given to the next closest secondary school, Naseby, after the two schools amalgamated in the mid-1980s. However, whether it was due to lack of demand for places or just financial problems, the former Ward End Hall School was closed down and demolished in the mid-1990s. A housing estate now stands on the site of the former school. Park View School was renamed Rockwood Academy in 2015. In addition to Rockwood Academy, there is a secondary education establishment quite locally at Washwood Heath (Washwood Heath Academy) and two more in Hodge Hill (Hodge Hill College; and Hodge Hill Girls&#x27; School, a former grammar school).

==Places of worship==
There are a number of places of worship in Ward End, Christ Church in Burney Lane and a large number of mosques.George Grenfell Memorial Hall situated to the rear of Grenfell Baptist Church in Bankdale Road B8 2AA. Monk Road Methodist is now an African pentecostal church.

==Unusual events==
Several unusual events have occurred in Ward End over the years.

In late-1981 and into 1982, the residents of five houses on Thornton Road informed the police that stones had been thrown against their windows at night. The stones had no fingerprints, so a night-time surveillance using infrared cameras and image-intensifiers was set up. The stone-throwing continued even though no human activity was seen. Eventually the Birmingham CID gave up and left the case open.

In late-2004 and early 2005, there were rumours that a man had bitten several people on Glen Park Road; described as being black and in his mid-20s he was dubbed the &quot;Birmingham Vampire&quot;. However the police had received no reports of any attack, and the hospitals had received no bite victims. The local press was inundated with calls from worried residents in Ward End and the surrounding area. The case has been dismissed as an urban legend.

In 2006, Tarmac (a heavy building materials company) drew up a list of Britain&#x27;s &quot;spookiest roads&quot;, with Drews Lane in Ward End coming tenth. Invisible cars are frequently heard on the road.

===Famous Resident===
Charlie Hall, character actor in many Laurel and Hardy films, was born here.

<doc id="845028" wikidata="Q1549047" url="?curid=845028" title="Selkie">
<text>Selkies are mythological creatures that can shapeshift between seal and human forms by removing or putting on their seal skin. They feature prominently in the oral traditions and mythology of various cultures, especially those of Celtic and Norse origin. The term “selkie” derives from the Scots word for “seal”, and is also spelled as &#x27;,&#x27;, or &#x27;. Selkies are sometimes referred to asselkie folk(), meaning&#x27;seal folk&quot;&quot;. Selkies are mainly associated with the Northern Isles of Scotland, where they are said to live as seals in the sea but shed their skin to become human on land.

Selkies have a dual nature: they can be friendly and helpful to humans, but they can also be dangerous and vengeful. Selkies are often depicted as attractive and seductive in human form, and many stories involve selkies having romantic or sexual relationships with humans, sometimes resulting in children. Selkies can also be coerced or tricked into marrying humans, usually by someone who steals and hides their seal skin, preventing them from returning to the sea. Such marriages are often unhappy, as the selkie always longs for the sea and may eventually escape if they find their skin. 

Selkies have counterparts in other cultures, such as the Faroese, Icelandic, Irish, and Manx. They are sometimes confused with other seal-like creatures, such as the mermaids or the finfolk. Selkies have inspired many works of art, literature, music, and film.

==Terminology==
The Scots language word &#x27; is diminutive for &#x27; which strictly speaking means &#x27;grey seal&#x27; (&quot;Halichoerus grypus&quot;). Alternate spellings for the diminutive include: &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &quot;&quot;, etc.

The term &quot;selkie&quot; according to Alan Bruford should be treated as meaning any seal with or without the implication of transformation into human form.

W. Traill Dennison insisted &quot;selkie&quot; was the correct term to be applied to these shapeshifters, to be distinguished from the merfolk, and that Samuel Hibbert committed an error in referring to them as &quot;mermen&quot; and &quot;mermaids&quot;. However, when other Norse cultures are examined, Icelandic writers also refer to the seal-wives as merfolk ().

There also seems to be some conflation between the selkie and finfolk. This confounding only existed in Shetland, claimed Dennison, and that in Orkney the selkie are distinguished from the finfolk, and the selkies&#x27; abode undersea is not &quot;Finfolk-a-heem&quot;; this notion, although seconded by Ernest Marwick, has been challenged by Bruford.

There is further confusion with the Norse concept of the Finns as shapeshifters, &quot;Finns&quot; (synonymous with &quot;finfolk&quot;) being the Shetland dialect name for dwellers of the sea who could remove their seal-skin and transform into humans according to one native correspondent.

;Gaelic terms
In Gaelic stories, specific terms for selkies are rarely used. They are seldom differentiated from mermaids. They are most commonly referred to as in Scottish Gaelic, in Irish, and in Manx (&#x27;maiden of the sea&#x27; i.e. mermaids) and clearly have the seal-like attributes of selkies. The only term that specifically refers to a selkie but which is only rarely encountered is , or &#x27;seal maiden&#x27;.

==Scottish legend==

Many of the folk-tales on selkie folk have been collected from the Northern Isles (Orkney and Shetland).

In Orkney lore, &quot;selkie&quot; is said to denote various seals of greater size than the grey seal; only these large seals are credited with the ability to shapeshift into humans, and are called &quot;selkie folk&quot;. The type of large seals that might have been seen on the islands include the Greenland seal (also known as the Harp Seal) and the crested seal (also known as the hooded seal). Something similar is stated in Shetland tradition, that the mermen and mermaids prefer to assume the shape of larger seals, referred to as &quot;Haaf-fish&quot;.

===Selkie wife and human lover===

A typical folk-tale is that of a man who steals a female selkie&#x27;s skin, finds her naked on the sea shore, and compels her to become his wife. But the wife will spend her time in captivity longing for the sea, her true home, and will often be seen gazing longingly at the ocean. She may bear several children by her human husband, but once she discovers her skin, she will immediately return to the sea and abandon the children she loved. Sometimes, one of her children discovers or knows the whereabouts of the skin. Sometimes it is revealed she already had a first husband of her own kind. Although in some children&#x27;s story versions, the selkie revisits her family on land once a year, in the typical folktale she is never seen again by them.
In one version, the selkie wife was never seen again (at least in human form) by the family, but the children would witness a large seal approach them and &quot;greet&quot; them plaintively.

Male selkies are described as being very handsome in their human form, and having great seductive powers over human women. They typically seek those who are dissatisfied with their lives, such as married women waiting for their fishermen husbands. In one popular tattletale version about a certain &quot;Ursilla&quot; of Orkney (a pseudonym), it was rumoured that when she wished to make contact with her male selkie she would shed seven tears into the sea.

Children born between man and seal-folk may have webbed hands, as in the case of the Shetland mermaid whose children had &quot;a sort of web between their fingers&quot;, or &quot;Ursilla&quot; rumoured to have children sired by a male selkie, such that the children had to have the webbing between their fingers and toes made of horny material clipped away intermittently. Some of the descendants actually did have these hereditary traits, according to Walter Traill Dennison, who was related to the family.

===Binding rules and sinful origin===

Some legends say that selkies could turn human every so often when the conditions of the tides were correct, but oral storytellers disagreed as to the time interval. In &quot;Ursilla&#x27;s rumour&quot;, the contacted male selkie promised to visit her at the &quot;seventh stream&quot; or springtide. In the ballad &quot;The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry&quot;, the seal-husband promised to return in seven years; the number &quot;seven&quot; being commonplace in balladry.

According to one version, the selkie could only assume human form once every seven years because they are bodies that house condemned souls. There is the notion that they are either humans who had committed sinful wrongdoing, or fallen angels.

=== Superstitions ===

It was only during hard times that the people of the Scottish Isles would kill seals to make use of their skin and blubber. It was thought that the killing of a seal would result in misfortune for the perpetrator.

Ernest Marwick recounts the tale of crofters who brought their sheep to graze upon a small group of holms within the Orkney Islands. During the summer, a man placed seven sheep on the largest holm. While on his way home from grazing sheep, the man killed a seal. That night, all of the man&#x27;s sheep disappeared, however, the other crofters, who had not killed a seal, did not lose their sheep.

== Orkney tales ==

The selkie-wife tale had its version for practically every island of Orkney according to W. Traill Dennison. In his study, he included a version collected from a resident of North Ronaldsay, in which a &quot;goodman of Wastness&quot;, a confirmed bachelor, falls in love with a damsel among the selkie-folk, whose skin he captures. She searches the house in his absence, and finds her seal-skin thanks to her youngest daughter who had once seen it being hidden under the roof.

In &quot;Selkie Wife&quot;, a version from Deerness on the Mainland, Orkney, the husband locked away the seal-skin in a sea-kist (chest) and hid the key, but the seal woman is said to have acquiesced to the concealment, saying it was &quot;better tae keep her selkie days oot o&#x27; her mind&quot;. However, when she discovered her skin, she departed hastily leaving her clothes all scattered about.

A fisherman named Alick supposedly gained a wife by stealing the seal-skin of a selkie, in a tale told by an Orkney skipper. The Alick in the tale is given as a good acquaintance of the father of the storyteller, John Heddle of Stromness.

==Shetland tales==

A version of the tale about the mermaid compelled to become wife to a human who steals her seal-skin, localized in Unst, was published by Samuel Hibbert in 1822. She already had a husband of her own kind in her case.

Some stories from Shetland have selkies luring islanders into the sea at midsummer, the lovelorn humans never returning to dry land.

In Shetland, the sea-folk were believed to revert to human shape and breathed air in the atmosphere in the submarine homeland, but with their sea-dress (seal-skin) they had the ability to transform into seals to make transit from there to the reefs above the sea. However, each skin was unique and irreplaceable.

The shape-shifting nature of selkies within Shetland tradition is detailed in the Scottish ballad &quot;The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry&quot;:

In the tale of &quot;Gioga&#x27;s Son&quot;, a group of seals resting in the Ve Skerries were ambushed and skinned by Papa Stour fishermen, but as these were actually seal-folk, the spilling of the blood caused a surge in seawater, and one fisherman was left abandoned. The seal-folk victims recovered in human-like form, but lamented the loss of their skin without which they could not return to their submarine home. Ollavitinus was particularly distressed since he was now separated from his wife; however, his mother Gioga struck a bargain with the abandoned seaman, offering to carrying him back to Papa Stour on condition the skin would be returned. In a different telling of the same plot line, the stranded man is called Herman Perk, while the rescuing selkie&#x27;s name is unidentified.

==Parallels==
Tales of the seal bride type has been assigned the number ML 4080 under Reidar Thoralf Christiansen&#x27;s system of classification of migratory folktales. These stories of selkie-wives are also recognized to be of the swan maiden motif type. There are now hundreds of seal bride type tales that have been found from Ireland to Iceland. Only one specimen was found in Norway by Christiansen.

In the Faroe Islands there are analogous beliefs in seal-folk and seal-women also.

Seal shapeshifters similar to the selkie exist in the folklore of many cultures. A corresponding creature existed in Swedish legend, and the Chinook people of North America have a similar tale of a boy who changes into a seal.

==Icelandic folk-tales==

The folk-tale &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Seal-Skin&quot;) published by Jón Árnason offers an Icelandic analogue of the selkie folk tale. The tale relates how a man from Mýrdalur forced a woman transformed from a seal to marry him after taking possession of her seal-skin. She discovers the key to the chest in her husband&#x27;s usual clothes when he dresses up for a Christmas outing, and the seal woman is reunited with the male seal who was her betrothed partner.

Another such tale was recorded by Jón Guðmundsson the Learned (in 1641), and according to him these seal folk were sea-dwelling elves called (mermen and mermaids). His tale is of a man who comes across the dancing and celebrating of elves within a cave by the ocean. The cave is lined with the sealskins of the dancing elves. As soon as the elves take notice of the man, they rush to don their skins and dive back into the ocean. However, the man is able to steal the smallest of the skins, sliding it underneath his clothes. The owner of the skin tries to retrieve her skin from the man but he quickly takes hold of the young elf and takes her to his home to be his wife. The man and the elf are together for two years, producing two children, a boy and a girl, but the elf harbors no love for the man. During this time, the former elf woman&#x27;s elf husband swims along the shore by the couple&#x27;s home. One day, the elf woman finds her skin, and runs away, never to be seen again.

Scientist Fridtjof Nansen reported another Icelandic tale of the seal-woman: a man passes by the sea and hears sounds coming out of a cave. He finds a pile of discarded sealskins nearby and fetches one of them. Later that same day, he returns to the cave and finds a weeping young woman - the owner of the sealskin he took home. The man brings the woman to his house; they marry and have children. One day, while the man is away fishing, the woman finds her sealskin, says goodbye to her human family and departs to the sea.

A more distant echo of selkie-type stories may be found in the medieval story of the demonic woman Selkolla (whose name means &#x27;Seal-head&#x27;).

== Faroese legends ==
A famous selkie story from the Faroe Islands is &quot;The Legend of&quot; &quot;,&quot; literally meaning &#x27;seal woman.&#x27; The story tells of a young farmer from the village of Mikladalur who, after learning about the local legend that seals could come ashore and shed their skins once a year on the Thirteenth Night, goes to see for himself. While laying in wait, the man watches as many seals swim to shore, shedding their skin to reveal their human forms. The farmer takes the skin of a young selkie woman, who, unable to return to the water without her skin, is forced to follow the young man back to his farm and become his wife. The two stay together for many years, even producing several children. The man locks the selkie woman&#x27;s skin in a chest, keeping the key to the lock on his person at all times, so his wife may never gain access. However, one day the man forgets his key at home, and comes back to his farm to find that his selkie wife has taken her skin and returned to the ocean. Later, when the farmer is out on a hunt, he kills the selkie woman&#x27;s selkie husband and two selkie sons. Enraged, the selkie woman promises vengeance for her lost kin. She exclaims that &quot;some shall be drowned, some shall fall from cliffs and slopes, and this shall continue, until so many men have been lost that they will be able to link arms around the whole island of Kalsoy.&quot; Deaths that occur on the island are thought to be due to the selkie woman&#x27;s curse.

&quot;Peter Kagan and the Wind&quot; by Gordon Bok tells of the fisherman Kagan who married a seal-woman. Against his wife&#x27;s wishes he set sail dangerously late in the year, and was trapped battling a terrible storm, unable to return home. His wife shifted to her seal form and saved him, even though this meant she could never return to her human body and hence her happy home. Singer-songwriter Russell Christian immortalized the tale of the Faroese selkie in his song &quot;Kopakonan&quot;.

==Irish folklore==
The mermaid in Irish folklore (sometimes called &quot;merrow&quot; in Hiberno-English) has been regarded as a seal-woman in some instances. In a certain collection of lore in County Kerry, there is an onomastic tale in Tralee that claimed the Lee family was descended from a man who took a (&#x27;mermaid&#x27;) for a wife; she later escaped and joined her seal-husband, suggesting she was of the seal-folk kind.

There is also the tradition that the Conneely clan of Connemara was descended from seals, and it was taboo for them to kill the animals lest it bring ill luck. And since &quot;conneely&quot; became a moniker of the animal, many changed their surname to Connolly. It is also mentioned in this connection that there is a Roaninish (, &#x27;seal island&#x27;) just outside Gweebarra Bay, off the western coastline of County Donegal in Ulster.

== Selkie children ==

In many versions of the selkie myth, the children produced by the coupling of a selkie and a human, are born with certain physical characteristics that set them apart from normal children.

In David Thomson&#x27;s book &quot;The People of the Sea,&quot; which chronicles the extensive legends surrounding the Grey Seal within the folklore of rural Scottish and Irish communities, it is the children of male selkies and human women that have webbed toes and fingers. When the webbing is cut, a rough and rigid growth takes its place.

In &quot;The Folklore of Orkney and Shetland&quot;, Ernest Marwick cites a tale of a woman who gives birth to a son with a seal&#x27;s face after falling in love with a selkie man. A dream later reveals the location of silver for the woman to find after giving birth to her son.

A group of selkie descendants, also mentioned by Marwick, possessed a skin that was greenish, white in color and cracked in certain places upon the body. These cracks exuded a fishy odor. 

==Theories of origins==
Before the advent of modern medicine, many physiological conditions were untreatable. When children were born with abnormalities, it was common to blame the fairies. The MacCodrum clan of the Outer Hebrides became known as the &quot;MacCodrums of the seals&quot; as they claimed to be descended from a union between a fisherman and a selkie. This was an explanation for their syndactyly – a hereditary growth of skin between their fingers that made their hands resemble flippers.

Scottish folklorist and antiquarian, David MacRitchie believed that early settlers in Scotland probably encountered, and even married, Finnish and Sami women who were misidentified as selkies because of their sealskin kayaks and clothing. Others have suggested that the traditions concerning the selkies may have been due to misinterpreted sightings of Finn-men (Inuit from the Davis Strait). The Inuit wore clothes and used kayaks that were both made of animal skins. Both the clothes and kayaks would lose buoyancy when saturated and would need to be dried out. It is thought that sightings of Inuit divesting themselves of their clothing or lying next to the skins on the rocks could have led to the belief in their ability to change from a seal to a man.

Another belief is that shipwrecked Spaniards were washed ashore, and their jet-black hair resembled seals. As the anthropologist A. Asbjørn Jøn has recognised, though, there is a strong body of lore that indicates that selkies &quot;are said to be supernaturally formed from the souls of drowned people&quot;.

==Modern treatments==

Scottish poet George Mackay Brown wrote a modern prose version of the story, entitled &quot;Sealskin&quot;.

==In popular culture==

Selkies—or references to them—have appeared in numerous novels, songs and films, though the extent to which these reflect traditional stories varies greatly. Work where selkie lore forms the central theme include:
* &quot;A Stranger Came Ashore&quot;, a 1975 young adult novel by Scottish author Mollie Hunter. Set in the Shetland Islands in the north of Scotland, the plot revolves around a boy who must protect his sister from the Great Selkie. 
* &quot;The Secret of Roan Inish&quot;, a 1994 American/Irish independent film based on the novel &quot;Secret of the Ron Mor Skerry&quot;, by Rosalie K. Fry.

<doc id="845031" wikidata="Q904346" url="?curid=845031" title="Kingdom of Desmond">
<text>The Kingdom of Desmond () was a historic kingdom in southwestern Ireland. It was founded in 1118 by Tadhg Mac Cárthaigh, King of Munster when the Treaty of Glanmire formally divided the Kingdom of Munster into Desmond and Thomond (, &quot;North Munster&quot;). It comprised all of what is now County Cork and most of County Kerry. Desmond was ruled by the Mac Cárthaigh (MacCarthy) dynasty. Other clans within the kingdom included the O&#x27;Sullivans and O&#x27;Donovans. Following the Norman invasion of Ireland in the late 12th century, the eastern half of Desmond was conquered by the Anglo-Normans and became the Earldom of Desmond, ruled by the Fitzmaurices and FitzGeralds—the famous Irish family known as the Geraldines. The king of Desmond, Diarmaid Mac Cárthaigh submitted to Henry II of England, but the western half of Desmond lived on as a semi-independent Gaelic kingdom. It was often at war with the Anglo-Normans. Fínghin Mac Carthaigh&#x27;s victory over the Anglo-Normans at the Battle of Callann (1261) helped preserve Desmond&#x27;s independence. The kings of Desmond founded sites such as Blarney Castle, Ballycarbery Castle, Muckross Abbey and Kilcrea Friary. Following the Nine Years&#x27; War of the 1590s, Desmond became part of the Kingdom of Ireland.

==MacCarthy Mórs: Kings of Desmond==
From its inception in 1118 through 1596, the Kingdom of Desmond was ruled by the family of the MacCarthy Mór (i.e., the &quot;Great MacCarthy&quot;). For centuries the MacCarthy Mórs reigned as Kings of Desmond, and maintained significant demesne lands (manors) throughout the kingdom. Principal seats were at Pallis Castle (near present-day Killarney), Castle Lough (on Killarney&#x27;s Lough Leane), and Ballycarbery Castle (near Cahersiveen on the Ring of Kerry).

After the death of King Donal IX MacCarthy Mór in 1596, and following the effective end of the Gaelic Order after the Battle of Kinsale (1602), the former Kingdom of Desmond was partitioned between County Cork and County Kerry (in 1606).

Subsequent to the end of the MacCarthy Mór sovereignty in Desmond, descendants entitled to the highest Gaelic designation of &quot;Chief of the Name&quot; of the MacCarthy Mór family, are also properly styled as Princes of Desmond. A secondary title of the MacCarthy Mór would derive from the lordship designation of his sept.

==Principalities and other septs==
Generational offshoots (cadet family lines) of the Royal House of Desmond received their own territories and titles – known as appanages of the royal house. Those MacCarthy Mór cadet branches which did not evolve to the MacCarthy Mór chief-of-the-name status, became chiefs-of-the-name of their own princely septs, i.e. MacCarthy Reagh of Carbery, MacCarthy of Muskerry, and MacDonough MacCarthy of Duhallow.

Because of their location, it was the MacCarthys of Muskerry and Carbery who ended up fighting the majority of the battles against the Normans – mainly the FitzGerald Earls of Desmond – while defending and expanding the Gaelic realms. By the mid-sixteenth century, the main line of the MacCarthys Mor had largely withdrawn to Kerry, so any modern claims that they are still entitled to the nominal overlordship of Carbery and Muskerry might be rejected by any extant descendants of these branches.

===Carbery===
One of three principalities within the original Kingdom of Desmond, Carbery, under the MacCarthy Reagh dynasty founded by Donal Gott MacCarthy in the mid-13th century, achieved independence from the overlordship of the MacCarthy Mórs of Desmond. Thus, the MacCarthy territories were actually over a fourth again greater outside of Desmond proper, due to the independent and considerable principality of Carbery, directly to the south/southeast of Desmond.

Principal seats of the Lords/Princes of Carbery were at Kilbrittain Castle (near Kinsale in County Cork), as well as Timoleague Castle (west of Kinsale). Possession of the latter was frequently in dispute with the Norman family of Barry, who were also prominent in West Cork. Some of the more notable sub-lordships under the MacCarthy Reagh dynasty of Carbery included castles at Ballydehob, Benduff, Downeen, Kilcoe, and Kilgobbin, to name but a few.

===Muskerry===
The MacCarthys of Muskerry, on the other hand, derived more recently from the MacCarthys Mór, and so were (and still are) considered a sept of the main dynasty. This principality of the Kingdom of Desmond began in the 14th century as an appanage of King Cormac Mór MacCarthy Mór (d. 1359) for his second son, Dermod. At various times, because of their adeptness at playing the political game with England, the Lords/Princes of Muskerry also bore various British titles, such as Earl of Clancarty, Viscount Mountcashel, and Baron (Lord) of Blarney.

From its rebuilding in the late 15th century by Cormac Laidir MacCarthy, Blarney Castle, near to Cork city, was the principal seat of the MacCarthys of Muskerry. It was from alleged dialogue between Cormac Teige MacCarthy, the Lord of Blarney, and Queen Elizabeth I of England, that the term &quot;blarney&quot; was coined to mean &quot;empty flattery&quot; or &quot;beguiling talk.&quot; It is also from Blarney Castle that the legend of &quot;kissing the Blarney Stone&quot; derives.

Among the numerous sub-infeudations/sub-lordships within the overlordship of the Princes of Muskerry, some of the major ones were: Ballea, Carrignamuck, Carrignavar, Castlecormac, Cloghroe, Cloghphillip, and Downyne.

===Duhallow===
The third of the princely lines that began as appanages of the MacCarthy Mór dynasty was that of the MacCarthys of Duhallow (), known as the MacDonough MacCarthys. The Duhallow sept began in the 13th century as an appanage from the then-King of Desmond, Cormac Fionn MacCarthy Mór (r. 1244–1248), to his son Diarmuid (Dermond). It was the Gaelic lordship(s) of Duhallow (and Coshmaing) that occupied the northern frontier of the MacCarthys of Desmond in their sometime struggles with the Norman family of the FitzGeralds, the Earls of Desmond. The principal seat of the Lords of Duhallow was at Kanturk. The family of the MacDonough MacCarthy Lords/Princes of Duhallow became extinct in the 18th century.

As in the other princely appanages of Carbery and Muskerry, Duhallow held overlordship of a number of septs of both comital (ard tiarna) rank – Clanawly, Clonmeen, and Dromagh – as well as baronial (tiarna) rank – e.g., Cappagh, Dromiscane, Kanturk, Kilbolane, Knocktemple, and Lohort, among others.

===Other septs===

====Coshmaing====
The sept (clan) of Sliocht Eoghan of Coshmaing (&quot;beside the River Maine&quot;) was established in the 14th century by King Cormac Mór MacCarthy Mór (d. 1359) for his third son, Eoghan, as an appanage of the royal house of Desmond. According to Butler, &quot;Of the MacCarthy septs in the Barony of Magunihy, by far the most (88 to 105 ploughlands) was the Sliocht Eoghain Mhoir of Cois Mainge…. The lands of this sept stretched along the whole northern frontier of Magunihy from a point near Castlemaine to the border of Cork.&quot;

The head of Sliocht Eoghan of Coshmaing was styled as Lord (Ard Tiarna) of Coshmaing (English: &quot;Cosmaigne&quot;). The principal seat of the Coshmaing lordship was at Molahiffe, with other castles (sub-lordships) at Fieries and Clonmeallane.

====Non-MacCarthy septs====
Both inside and outside the territories of the Kingdom of Desmond in southwestern Ireland, there were many families other than the various septs of the MacCarthys. Most prominent of the Norman families in the area were the FitzGeralds (Earls of Desmond), FitzMaurices, Barrys, Barretts, and Roches.

The chief non-MacCarthy Gaelic princes under the MacCarthy Mórs in Desmond were the O&#x27;Sullivans. After them were the O&#x27;Donoghues, and these two were the only septs who took part in the performance of the MacCarthy inauguration ceremonies – i.e., the bestowal of the White Wand. Also prominent were the O&#x27;Callaghans, O&#x27;Keeffes, McAuliffes, O&#x27;Sheas, [O&#x27;Fearris, /O&#x27;Fearguis] and others.

Within Carbery, aside from the MacCarthy Reaghs, the most prominent Gaelic families were the princely sept of the O&#x27;Donovans, the O&#x27;Mahonys, O&#x27;Driscolls, O&#x27;Dalys, and O&#x27;Crowleys. Within Muskerry, prominent non-MacCarthy Gaelic families included the MacSweeneys, O&#x27;Learys, O&#x27;Spaelains, O&#x27;Healys, and O&#x27;Riordans.

<text>KHON-TV (channel 2) is a television station in Honolulu, Hawaii, United States, serving the Hawaiian Islands as an affiliate of Fox and an owned-and-operated station of The CW. It is owned by Nexstar Media Group alongside MyNetworkTV affiliate KHII-TV (channel 9). The two stations share studios at the Haiwaiki Tower in downtown Honolulu; KHON&#x27;s main transmitter is also located downtown at the Century Center condominium/business complex.

==History==
===NBC affiliate===
KHON-TV first signed on the air on November 16, 1952, as the first Hawaiian television station and a primary NBC affiliate, KONA, occupying the channel 11 position. It also had a secondary affiliation with DuMont (which it later shared with KULA-TV, now KITV, after it signed on in 1954) until that network&#x27;s demise in 1955. The station was originally owned by Herbert Richards. Two years later in 1954, the &quot;Honolulu Advertiser&quot; purchased the station. 

On October 16, 1955, KONA changed channels from 11 to 2 due to the lower VHF positions (2 to 6) having the most powerful ERPs at the time. The channel 11 frequency now belongs to PBS member station KHET. In 1956, KONA was sold to Pacific and Southern Broadcasting, the forerunner of Combined Communications. KALU signed on in 1958, with KALA following in 1961. 

In 1965, all three stations&#x27; call letters were changed: KONA became KHON-TV, with KALA becoming KHAW-TV and KALU changing to KAII-TV.

In 1973, Pacific and Southern Broadcasting decided to spin off KHON to company president Arthur H. McCoy. The move was made so Pacific and Southern could merge into Combined Communications (which would itself merge with the Gannett Company six years later). Between them, the two companies were one station over the ownership limit of the time.

In 1979, KHON and Maui&#x27;s KAII were sold to Western-Sun Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Cowles Communications; the Hilo satellite KHAW-TV was sold to Simpson Communications, but leased back to Cowles/Western-Sun. In 1985, KHON and KAII were sold to Burnham Broadcasting as part of the Cowles family&#x27;s liquidation of most of its media assets; Burnham would acquire KHAW outright the next year, reuniting the stations.

===Fox affiliate===

In March 1994, the Fox Broadcasting Company (then a division of News Corporation) entered into a partnership with minority-owned communications firm Savoy Pictures to form a television station ownership group called SF Broadcasting. On August 25, 1994, the company bought KHON, WVUE-TV in New Orleans and WALA-TV in Mobile, Alabama for $229 million; fellow sister station WLUK-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin was sold to the company one month earlier in a separate $38 million deal, which for a time, was challenged by a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) petition filed by NBC alleging that the deal violated foreign investment limits for U.S. broadcasters (a fifth Burnham station, KBAK-TV in Bakersfield, California, was excluded from the SF deal and was instead spun off to Westwind Communications, a new company formed by several former Burnham executives). As part of the deal, all four stations (three NBC affiliates, including KHON, and one ABC affiliate) would disaffiliate from their respective network and become Fox affiliates. Fox was slated to control the voting stock in the venture, but prior to the sale&#x27;s closure in 1995, it was determined that Fox would still hold an interest in SF although it opted not to have voting stock in the company. Savoy Pictures controlled the day-to-day operations of the four stations.

On January 1, 1996, KHON-TV switched its affiliation to Fox (and changed its on-air branding to &quot;Fox 2&quot;); the NBC affiliation moved to former Fox affiliate KHNL (channel 13). Unlike the New World Communications-owned Fox affiliates that joined the network during the previous 18-month span, KHON ran Fox Kids programming on weekdays (until Fox discontinued the weekday block in December 2001, airing weekdays from 1 to 4 p.m. and then from 2 to 4 p.m. until the fall of 2001 when it was moved to 10 a.m. to noon) and Saturday mornings (until November 2008, when 4Kids Entertainment ceased programming Fox&#x27;s children&#x27;s block, with the network discontinuing its children&#x27;s programming altogether). KHON also expanded its local news programming on weekdays, seeing an increase in newscast ratings with the affiliation switch. KHON currently has the distinction of having the highest-rated local news programming of any Fox affiliate nationwide, and also declares itself as &quot;America&#x27;s No. 1 Fox affiliate&quot;, though the network&#x27;s Miami affiliate WSVN makes this claim as well. Neither station mentions Fox in its logo or branding; when KHON was rebranded to &quot;KHON 2&quot; in 2004, it became the first Fox station to ditch the network&#x27;s brand standardization for its stations while it was still an affiliate. KHON is one of a handful of Fox affiliates that omit network references in their branding.
On November 28, 1995, Silver King Communications (operated by former Fox executive Barry Diller) announced that it would acquire Savoy Pictures; as a result, Savoy Pictures and Fox ended their partnership and sold the SF Broadcasting stations, including KHON-TV, to the USA Networks division Silver King Broadcasting. Silver King, which later became known as USA Broadcasting, owned several stations on the United States mainland that were affiliated with the Home Shopping Network, which was also owned by USA Networks. The sale of KHON and the other SF stations was approved and finalized in March 1996, with its other assets being merged into the company that November.

In 1999, KHON relocated from its longtime studios on Auahi Street and moved to their current studios on Piikoi Street. Also on April 1 of that year, USA sold all four of its Fox stations to Indianapolis-based Emmis Communications for $307 million in cash and stock, as part of a sale of its major network affiliates in order to concentrate on its formerly HSN-affiliated independent stations.

A year later in 2000, Emmis purchased CBS affiliate KGMB, effectively bringing Hawaii&#x27;s two oldest television stations under common ownership, though both stations retained separate operations—unlike what would become the common operational structure of most duopolies. Emmis received a cross-ownership waiver to acquire KGMB as FCC duopoly rules prohibit two of the four highest-rated stations in the same market from being owned by one company.

From September 2, 2002, to October 31, 2004, KHON carried select UPN programming via a secondary affiliation shared with KGMB; each station aired programs from that network that the other station did not air. The two stations began carrying UPN programming in September 2002 after KFVE (which had been with UPN since its January 1995 launch) disaffiliated from the network to become a full-time affiliate of The WB (whose programming aired on KFVE in a secondary capacity since December 1998). KIKU, an independent station specializing in Japanese programming, became a secondary UPN affiliate on November 1, 2004, and remained with the network until its closure on September 15, 2006.

====Sale to Montecito====
On May 15, 2005, Emmis Communications announced that it would sell its 16 television stations in order to concentrate on its portfolio of radio stations. On September 15, Emmis sold KHON as well as CBS affiliate KOIN in Portland, Oregon, and NBC affiliates KSNW in Wichita and KSNT in Topeka, Kansas to the Montecito Broadcast Group (formerly SJL Broadcast Management) for $259 million; the sale closed on January 27, 2006. The acquisition resulted in one of the rare instances in which two stations operated in a duopoly were completely separated due to Emmis owning KHON and KGMB under a waiver.

Montecito planned to replace 35 of KHON&#x27;s 111 employees with automation. KHON employees first learned of the plan on January 12, when general manager Rick Blangiardi notified the staff of his intent to resign once the sale was finalized. At a station staff meeting that afternoon, SJL announced the layoffs, which would take place in two phases over the course of two months. Anchor Joe Moore announced the plan at the end of that evening&#x27;s 6 p.m. newscast, and stated his concern that the change would impact the station&#x27;s ability to serve its viewers. Montecito responded on January 15, assuring the public that no reporters or anchors would be affected, and the 6 p.m. newscast would be largely unchanged from the viewer&#x27;s perspective.

The purchase of KHON was scheduled to close on January 26; however, Montecito was unable to complete the purchase of KHON that day, due to a mix-up in paperwork. As a result, Emmis announced that no employees would be fired as a result of the sale until at least March 31, and that Emmis would pay additional benefits to the affected employees. Moore used the last minutes of the 6 p.m. newscast, the final newscast under Emmis&#x27; ownership, to bid farewell to Blangiardi (who continued to manage KHON&#x27;s former sister station, KGMB) and to criticize Montecito. Among other charges, he claimed that the layoffs were tantamount to &quot;the butchering of an already lean work force&quot; and accused Montecito of being a &quot;virtual company&quot; with no physical offices. Montecito&#x27;s chief operating officer, Sandy Benton, disputed the charges, saying that &quot;what was said last night was not the truth&quot;.

Since the purchase, KHON&#x27;s new general manager, Joe MacNamara, changed the scope of the terminations: instead of a number of people to fire, a salary goal was given. Eight of KHON&#x27;s nine managers resigned over three days, each stating that they could not support Montecito&#x27;s decision to terminate employees (only the chief engineer remained). The managers involved, including Blangiardi, denied that the mass exodus was planned. Montecito continued to stand by the automation plan, pointing out that most of the markets it had entered have seen ratings increases as a result of Montecito management.

On June 28, 2006, Moore appeared to take another on-air dig at Montecito&#x27;s automation plan. For two weeks, a noticeable echo could be heard during the newscast. At the start of that night&#x27;s 10 p.m. newscast, it prompted Moore to stop and ask the technical crew if the problem could be fixed. A visibly disgusted Moore, who then blamed the new automated system, said &quot;We&#x27;re going to go to commercial. We&#x27;re going to get this straightened out because I&#x27;m fed up with this crap.&quot; When the newscast returned, the problem was fixed, and Moore resumed as normal. Moore, who was rumored to be considering leaving KHON as a result of the sale, decided to remain as the station&#x27;s chief anchor. In a February 6 email sent to staff members, Moore wrote, &quot;How could I possibly work for owners I do not respect? After much deliberation, I reached this conclusion ... the owners are not KHON-2. We, the people who work here are KHON-2. I would not be working &#x27;for the owners&#x27;. I would be working &#x27;for our viewers&#x27;, and &#x27;with&#x27; fellow employees I deeply respect. I have decided not to let our owners drive me out of KHON-2.&quot;

====Sale to New Vision Television, then LIN Media====
On July 24, 2007, Montecito announced the sale of all of its stations (KHON, KOIN in Portland, KSNW in Wichita and its satellites, and KSNT in Topeka) to New Vision Television. On November 1 of that year, New Vision officially took over ownership of the stations.

On May 7, 2012, LIN Media announced its acquisition of the New Vision stations for $330.4 million and the assumption of $12 million in debt. The FCC approved the sale to LIN on October 2, and the group deal was consummated ten days later on October 12, 2012, reuniting KHON-TV and its Oregon and Kansas sister stations with several former Emmis-owned stations which had been purchased by LIN seven years earlier, such as WALA-TV, WLUK-TV and Albuquerque, New Mexico&#x27;s KRQE.

====Sale to Media General, then Nexstar====

On March 21, 2014, Media General announced that it would purchase LIN Media and its stations, including KHON-TV, in a $1.6 billion merger. The merger was completed on December 19. KHON was the only LIN-owned Fox affiliate affected by the SF Broadcasting deal that was retained by Media General, as WALA and WLUK were respectively sold to the Meredith Corporation and Sinclair Broadcast Group to resolve ownership conflicts with existing Media General stations in the Mobile and Green Bay markets (WVUE had previously been sold to the Louisiana Media Company in 2007, and has since transferred that station&#x27;s operations to what is today Gray Television, which also owns KGMB/KHNL; WVUE reunited with WALA in 2021 following the latter&#x27;s acquisition by Gray, along with the rest of the Meredith Local Media division, and, as a result, the two stations remain as the only Burnham/SF stations under common ownership).

On January 27, 2016, Nexstar Broadcasting Group announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire Media General and its stations, including KHON-TV, with the sale being completed on January 17, 2017, marking Nexstar&#x27;s first entry into Hawaii.

==KHON-DT2 (Hawaii&#x27;s CW)==
KHON-DT2, branded Hawaii&#x27;s CW, is the CW-owned and operated second digital subchannel of KHON-TV, broadcasting in 720p high definition on channel 2.2.

===History===
On October 23, 2006, KHON-TV was announced as the Honolulu affiliate of The CW, carrying the network on its second digital subchannel. Beginning in March 2006 (two months after the network&#x27;s launch was announced), The CW had struggled to find an affiliate in Honolulu after the market&#x27;s then-WB affiliate KFVE, which was seen by many as the likeliest candidate to join The CW, signed with competing network MyNetworkTV, and former UPN affiliate KIKU (which aired the network&#x27;s programming in the afternoons) declined to take the CW affiliation.

The network premiered on KHON&#x27;s main channel on October 24 and 25 with airings of the regular CW schedule before moving to digital channel 2.2 on October 30; this was possible due to Fox&#x27;s World Series coverage airing live at 2 p.m. Honolulu time, freeing up prime time. On December 11, 2006, Oceanic Time Warner Cable began offering KHON-TV&#x27;s CW subchannel on digital cable channel 93; until the fall of 2011, the subchannel used its cable channel position within its branding.

KHON-DT2 presently clears The CW&#x27;s entire schedule, including its Saturday morning block. However, the subchannel had aired The CW&#x27;s Sunday night lineup an hour off-schedule, from 5 to 10 p.m. until the Sunday lineup was dropped and the hours given to its affiliates in September 2009. The subchannel is also available locally on DirecTV and Dish Network; the &#x27;93&#x27; in the subchannel&#x27;s branding was removed for this reason, as its channel numbers are different on those providers, and was later dropped by KHON across the board on both Oceanic Time Warner and Hawaiian Telcom (on cable channel 3), going with only &quot;Hawaii&#x27;s CW&quot; for that same reason. On August 20, 2007, &quot;Hawaii&#x27;s CW&quot; began airing the nationally syndicated morning news program &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot;. The show&#x27;s former home in the Honolulu market, KGMB, dropped the show three days earlier on August 17 in favor of a local morning newscast titled &quot;Sunrise on KGMB9&quot;, which launched on September 17. Unlike KGMB, which only aired the first two hours of &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot;, &quot;Hawaii&#x27;s CW&quot; aired the entire three-hour broadcast each weekday from 5 to 8 a.m. Upon the sudden cancellation of &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; in mid-April 2015 by its distributor, the channel switched to a simulcast of KHON&#x27;s morning news in full.

Incidentally, KHON was a secondary affiliate of one of The CW&#x27;s predecessor networks, UPN, from 2002 to 2004—at a time when secondary affiliations were more common and the advent of digital subchannels was not as widespread as it is today. &quot;Hawaii&#x27;s CW&quot; does not have its own website; the only mentions of the subchannel on KHON&#x27;s website are in the station&#x27;s programming schedule and a link to The CW&#x27;s website.

==Programming==
When it was an NBC affiliate, channel 2 carried most of the network&#x27;s lineup. The only exception was &quot;The Today Show&quot;, which the station had preempted since its sign-on due to the program being telecast live at 7 a.m. Eastern (which is 2 a.m. Hawaii time during standard time and 1 a.m. Hawaii time during daylight saving time, which Hawaii does not observe) and Hawaii&#x27;s geographical location, making it difficult to deliver a taped broadcast to the islands. As a result, the station would not start its full day of programming until at least 7 a.m., usually with ethnic programming, cartoons, and from 1966 to 1972, an hour of &quot;Romper Room&quot;. In 1968, KHON would finally air a one-hour taped version of &quot;Today&quot; but would then drop it a year later. It finally began airing the full two-hour program via same-day satellite in 1972.

For most of its first 30 years on the air, KHON aired the NBC schedule on one-week tape delay, with some shows airing out of pattern. For instance, it aired the &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; after 12 midnight or 6 a.m. the following morning via air mail. The Saturday morning schedule aired on Sunday morning, and &quot;Meet the Press&quot; aired on Saturday morning on a one-week delay. It would not be until 1985 when KHON would start airing NBC programming on the same day in the same timeslots as the U.S. mainland thanks to advances in satellite technology.
Since its switch from NBC in 1996, KHON clears the entire Fox network schedule (nightly prime time, Saturday late night, and Fox Sports programming, along with the network&#x27;s Saturday morning E/I programming block &quot;Xploration Station&quot;, and the political talk show &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot;). As of 2020, KHON also airs the syndicated infomercial block &quot;Weekend Marketplace&quot; on Sundays, making the station one of the few Fox affiliates that airs both &quot;Xploration Station&quot; and &quot;Weekend Marketplace&quot;. Most other Fox stations carrying &quot;Xploration Station&quot; air the block instead of &quot;Weekend Marketplace&quot;. The station presently airs Fox&#x27;s Sunday night programming one hour later than other affiliates, from 7 to 10 p.m. Hawaii Time (all other stations start Sunday prime time at 6 p.m.), and the network&#x27;s &quot;Animation Domination HD&quot; late night lineup on Saturdays aired a half-hour later airing at 10:30 p.m., due to its nightly 10 p.m. newscast. In 2014, KHON launched a half-hour prime time newscast at 9 p.m. on weekdays, followed by a second-run syndicated program, while network programs air in that hour on Sundays (syndicated programs may air in place of network shows if Fox airs a sporting event that is scheduled for prime time on the U.S. mainland, but due to the time differences between Hawaii and the continental United States, airs on KHON earlier that day).

KHON&#x27;s CW subchannel aired weekly CFL broadcasts for the 2007 season after former University of Hawaii star quarterback Timmy Chang earned a backup spot with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the pre-season. The station airs preseason games and special programming of the Las Vegas Raiders via a deal signed between the team and KHON owner Nexstar Broadcasting. The Raiders feature Hawaii native (and 2014 Heisman Trophy winner) Marcus Mariota. The station aired Tennessee Titans preseason games supplied via the team&#x27;s primary affiliate (and sister station through Media General) WKRN-TV when Mariota played in Tennessee.

For over a decade, both &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; aired on KHON. &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; was then moved to CBS affiliate KGMB in 2002 in order for KHON to begin a 5 p.m. newscast, which makes Honolulu one of the few markets where &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; air on separate stations.

===News operation===
KHON-TV presently broadcasts 37 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with seven hours each weekday, and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to locally produced newscasts, it has the largest newscast output of any television station in the Hawaiian Islands. When it switched to Fox, KHON maintained a news schedule similar to what it offered as an NBC affiliate. This resulted in KHON being the only news-producing Fox affiliate—indeed, the only Fox station that ran any local news programming—that did not air a prime time newscast. Hawaii&#x27;s local stations use the same prime time scheduling as network-affiliated stations in the Central, Mountain and Alaska time zones in the continental U.S. While most Fox stations in these time zones generally air their late evening newscasts at 9 p.m., instead KHON airs its late newscast at 10 p.m., competing against KITV, KGMB and KHNL instead of only competing with KFVE (whose 9 p.m. newscast is produced by the joint &quot;Hawaii News Now&quot; operation also involving KFVE sister stations KGMB and KHNL). On September 8, 2014, KHON launched its first 9 p.m. weeknight newscast, which is 30 minutes in length. This marked the first time KHON aired news programming in prime time since it was an NBC affiliate, when its &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; began its late evening broadcast at 9:30 p.m. to accommodate the delayed NBC schedule from 1972 to 1980. KHON&#x27;s 10 p.m. newscast will continue in the same time slot.

KHON&#x27;s newscasts have been the highest-rated in Hawaii for almost 40 years. The station&#x27;s news operation is so well respected that even when it branded itself as &quot;Fox 2&quot; from 1996 to 2004, it still titled its newscasts &quot;Channel 2 News&quot; (the name it had used since the early 1980s) rather than &quot;Fox 2 News&quot;. Also for this reason, its late newscast is not titled &quot;The Ten O&#x27;Clock News&quot; like with other Fox stations.

The station&#x27;s dominance has been especially pronounced since it lured KGMB sports anchor Joe Moore to become its lead anchor in 1979. Moore, billed as &quot;Hawaii&#x27;s most watched television newscaster,&quot; remains the station&#x27;s lead anchor. In addition to his duties on the 6 and 10 p.m. flagship newscasts, he also anchors &quot;Hawaii&#x27;s World Report at 5:30&quot;, a round-up of world and national news reports from CNN and Fox News. Moore is frequently the subject of controversy, but his popularity in the state usually prevents any attempts to rein him in.

As of 2012, KHON was the only major U.S. network-affiliated television station in Hawaii that had yet to make the upgrade to high definition or 16:9 enhanced definition widescreen local newscasts (KITV (channel 4) upgraded its newscasts to widescreen that year), as well as one of two LIN Media television properties that has yet to broadcast its local programming in high definition or widescreen (the other being WLFI-TV). On March 23, 2012, KHON president and general manager Joe McNamara stated in a New Vision Television press release that &quot;in the coming months, additional changes will be taking place inside our (KHON) studios with state-of-the-art HD upgrades of cameras, lighting and newsroom systems that will enhance our on-air look tremendously.&quot; On October 11, 2013, KHON became the last LIN-owned station to broadcast its newscasts in high definition with a new set and new logo. The debut was made during their 5 p.m. newscast. Included in the upgrade was a new logo and updated news music. The station uses the &quot;Inergy&quot; news music package by Stephen Arnold Music that was originally intended for stations owned by the E. W. Scripps Company; however, KHON uses a custom version with traditional Hawaiian instrumentation.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The stations&#x27; signals are multiplexed:


===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KHON-TV ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 2, on January 15, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the State of Hawaii transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts (almost five months before the June 12 transition date for full-power stations on the U.S. mainland). The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel 8, using virtual channel 2.

On that same date, KHAW-TV relocated its digital signal from UHF channel 21 to its former analog-era VHF channel 11; while KAII-TV relocated its digital signal from UHF channel 36 to its former analog-era VHF channel 7. K55DZ formerly broadcast in analog only, though it had applied with the FCC to operate a digital signal on channel 28.

==Satellite stations==
As with other major television stations in Hawaii, KHON operates multiple satellite stations and translators across the Hawaiian Islands to rebroadcast the station&#x27;s programming outside of metropolitan Honolulu.

<doc id="845038" wikidata="Q515302" url="?curid=845038" title="Coursing">
<text>Coursing by humans is the pursuit of game or other animals by dogs—chiefly greyhounds and other sighthounds—catching their prey by speed, running by sight, but not by scent. Coursing was a common hunting technique, practised by the nobility, the landed and wealthy, as well as by commoners with sighthounds and lurchers. In its oldest recorded form in the Western world, as described by Arrian—it was a sport practised by all levels of society, and it remained the case until Carolingian period forest law appropriated hunting grounds, or commons, for the king, the nobility, and other landowners. It then became a formalised competition, specifically on hare in Britain, practised under rules, the &quot;Laws of the Leash&#x27;.

As a zoological term, it refers to predation by running down prey over long distances, as opposed to stalking, in which a stealthy approach is followed by a short burst of sprinting. Humans also employ coursing as a means of hunting, but the term is normally reserved for predation by non-human predators.

== Sport and hunting ==
Animals coursed in hunting and sport include hares, foxes, deer of all sorts, antelope, gazelle, jackals, wolves. Jackrabbits and coyotes are the most common animals coursed in the United States. Competitive coursing in Ireland, the UK (until prohibition in 2004), Portugal and Spain has two dogs running against each other. In the United States, generally speaking, three dogs are run together.
The Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act and the Hunting Act 2004 (in England and Wales) made it illegal to hunt any type of mammal with dogs with the exception of rabbits and rats. Dogs are still permitted to chase (flush) game into the path of a waiting gun, as long as no more than two dogs are used.

In Australia, dogs may be used to hunt feral animals such as foxes, deer, goats, rabbits, and pigs.

<text>&quot;Banned in Boston&quot; is a phrase that was employed from the late 19th century through the mid-20th century, to describe a literary work, song, motion picture, or play which had been prohibited from distribution or exhibition in Boston, Massachusetts. During this period, Boston officials had wide authority to ban works featuring &quot;objectionable&quot; content, and often banned works with sexual content or foul language. This even extended to the $5 bill from the 1896 &quot;Educational&quot; series of banknotes featuring allegorical figures that were partially nude.

==History==
Boston was founded in the early 17th century by Puritans, who held strict moral standards. Boston&#x27;s second major wave of immigrants, Irish Catholics, began arriving in the 1820s and also held conservative moral beliefs, particularly regarding sex.

Early instances of works being &quot;banned in Boston&quot; extend back at least to the year 1651. That year, William Pynchon, the founder of Springfield, Massachusetts—Massachusetts&#x27; great settlement in the Connecticut River Valley—and the former treasurer of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, wrote a book criticizing Puritanism entitled &quot;The Meritorious Price of Our Redemption&quot;. Boston, founded by Puritans and, at that time ruled as a &quot;de jure&quot; theocracy, banned Pynchon&#x27;s book and pressed him to return to England. He did so in 1652, which nearly caused Springfield to align with the nearby Connecticut Colony.

This reputation persisted throughout the Puritan era. In 1700 an objection to the religious doctrines of Increase Mather carried with it an advertisement that Boston publishers had refused to print it out of fear of Mather. This advertisement caused such an uproar in Boston that many half-hearted denials by Boston printers were collected and printed by Mather&#x27;s party.

The phrase &quot;banned in Boston&quot;, however, originated in the late 19th century at a time when American moral crusader Anthony Comstock began a campaign to suppress vice. He found widespread support in Boston, particularly among upper-class officials. Comstock was also known as the proponent of the Comstock Act, which prevented obscene materials from being delivered by the U.S. mail.

Following Comstock&#x27;s lead, Boston&#x27;s city officials took it upon themselves to ban anything that they found to be salacious, inappropriate, or offensive. Aiding them in their efforts was a group of private citizens, the Boston Watch and Ward Society. Theatrical shows were run out of town, books were confiscated, and motion pictures were prevented from being shown; sometimes movies were stopped mid-showing, after an official had &quot;seen enough&quot;. In 1935, for example, during the opening performance of Clifford Odets&#x27; play &quot;Waiting for Lefty&quot;, four cast members were placed under arrest.

This movement had several unintended consequences. One was that Boston, a cultural center since its founding, was perceived as less sophisticated than other cities without stringent censorship practices. Another was that the phrase &quot;banned in Boston&quot; became associated, in the popular mind, with something lurid, sexy, and naughty. Commercial distributors were often pleased when their works were banned in Boston—it gave them more appeal elsewhere. In 1961, singer/host Merv Griffin recorded a novelty song, &quot;Banned in Boston,&quot; written by Clint Ballard Jr. and Fred Tobias, which became a modest hit.

Literary figure H. L. Mencken was arrested in Boston in 1926, after purposely selling a banned issue of his magazine &quot;The American Mercury&quot;. Though his case was dismissed by a local judge and he later won a lawsuit against the Watch and Ward Society for illegal restraint of trade, the effort did little to affect censorship in Boston. &quot;Strange Fruit&quot;, the novel of forbidden interracial romance by Lillian Smith, was also banned by the Watch and Ward Society, and, in 1929, Boston&#x27;s mayor Malcolm Nichols and the city censor banned Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning play &quot;Strange Interlude&quot;.

During the same era, there were also periodic &quot;purity campaigns&quot; on radio, as individual stations decided to ban songs with double-entendres or alleged vulgar lyrics. One victim of such a campaign was bandleader Joe Rines who, in November 1931, was cut off in mid-song by John L. Clark, program director of WBZ, for performing a number called &quot;This is the Missus&quot;, whose lyrics Clark deemed inappropriate. Rines was indignant, saying he believed Clark was over-reacting to a totally innocent song, but Clark insisted he was right to ban any song whose lyrics might be construed as suggestive.

The Warren Court (1953–69) expanded civil liberties and in &quot;Memoirs v. Massachusetts&quot; and other cases curtailed the ability of municipalities to regulate the content of literature, plays, and movies. The last major literary censorship battle in the U.S. was fought over &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;, which was banned in Boston in 1965. Eventually the Watch and Ward Society changed its name to the New England Citizens Crime Commission, and made its main emphasis against gambling and drugs and far less on media.

<text>The grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) is a species of large herbivorous freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae, native to the Pacific Far East, with a native range stretching from northern Vietnam to the Amur River on the Sino-Russian border. This Asian carp is the only species of the genus Ctenopharyngodon.

Grass carp are resident fish of large turbid rivers and associated floodplain lakes/wetlands with a wide range of temperature tolerance, and spawn at temperatures of . It has been cultivated as a food fish in China for centuries, being known as one of the &quot;Four Great Domestic Fish&quot; (), but was later introduced to Europe and the United States for aquatic weed control, becoming the fish species with the largest reported farmed production globally, over five million tonnes per year.

==Appearance and anatomy==
Grass carp have elongated, chubby, torpedo-shaped body forms. The terminal mouth is slightly oblique with non-fleshy, firm lips, and no barbels. The complete lateral line contains 40 to 42 scales. Broad, ridged pharyngeal teeth are arranged in a &quot;2, 4-4, 2&quot; formula. The dorsal fin has eight to 10 soft rays, and the anal fin is set closer to the tail than most cyprinids. Body color is dark olive, shading to brownish-yellow on the sides, with a white belly and large, slightly outlined scales. 
Grass carp grow very rapidly. Young fish stocked in the spring at will reach over by fall. The typical length is about . The maximum length is and they grow to .

==Ecology==
Grass carp inhabit lakes, ponds, pools and backwaters of large rivers, preferring large, slow-flowing or standing water bodies with abundant vegetation. In the wild, grass carp spawn in fast-moving rivers, and their eggs, which are slightly heavier than water, develop while drifting downstream, kept in suspension by turbulence. Grass carp require long rivers for the survival of the eggs and very young fish, and the eggs are thought to die if they sink to the bottom.

Adult grass carps feed primarily on aquatic plants, both higher aquatic plants and submerged terrestrial vegetation, but may also eat detritus, insects and other invertebrates. They eat up to three times their own body weight daily, and thrive in small lakes and backwaters that provide an abundant supply of vegetation.

According to one study, grass carp live 5–9 years, with the oldest surviving 11 years. In Silver Lake, Washington, a thriving population of grass carp is passing the 15-year mark.

==Introduced species==
Grass carp have been introduced to many countries around the world. In the Northern Hemisphere, countries and territories of introduction include Japan, the Philippines, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, Iran, Israel, the United States, Mexico, Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia. In the Southern Hemisphere, they have been introduced to Argentina, Venezuela, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and South Africa. Grass carp are known to have spawned and established self-reproducing populations in only six of the many larger Northern Hemisphere rivers into which they have been stocked. Their failure to establish populations in other rivers suggests they have quite specific reproductive requirements.

In the United States, the species was first imported in 1963 from Taiwan and Malaysia to aquaculture facilities in Alabama and Arkansas. The first release is believed to have been an accidental escape in 1966 from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&#x27;s Fish Farming Experimental Station in Stuttgart, Arkansas, followed by planned introductions beginning in 1969. Subsequently, authorized, illegal and accidental introductions have been widespread; by the 1970s, the species had been introduced to 40 states, and it has since been reported in 45 of the country&#x27;s 50 states. In 2013, it was determined to be reproducing in the Great Lakes Basin. It is still stocked in many states as an effective biocontrol for undesirable aquatic vegetation, many species of which are themselves introduced.

==Use==
===Weed control===
Grass carp were introduced into New Zealand in 1966 to control the growth of aquatic plants. Unlike the other introduced fish brought to New Zealand, the potential value and impact of grass carp was investigated in secure facilities prior to their use in field trials. They are now approved by the New Zealand government for aquatic weed control, although each instance requires specific authorization. In the Netherlands, the species was also introduced in 1973 to control over-abundant aquatic weeds. The release was controlled and regulated by the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature, and Food Quality. In both of these countries, control is made easier because grass carp are very unlikely to naturally reproduce because of their very specific breeding requirements, but elsewhere, control is obtained by the use of sterile, triploid fish.

===Food===

Grass carp is one of the most common freshwater farmed fish in China, being one of the Four Domestic Fish &quot;(四大家鱼)&quot; alongside the Black carp, Silver carp, and Bighead carp. Its meat is tender, with little bones. Many Chinese cuisine has grass carp as a featured dish, such as Cantonese cuisine. In some Asian countries, it is believed that ingestion of raw bile or entire gall bladders of the grass carp may improve visual acuity and health. However, it may in fact cause severe poisoning.

==Fishing for grass carp==

Grass carp grow large and are strong fighters when hooked on a line, but because of their vegetarian habits and their wariness, they can be difficult to catch via angling. The IGFA World record for a grass carp caught on line and hook is , caught in Bulgaria in 2009. The fish are also popular sport fish in areas where bowfishing is legal.

Where grass carp populations are maintained through stocking as a biocontrol for noxious weeds, fishermen are typically asked to return any caught to the water alive and unharmed.

<text>J. F. Oberlin (31 August 1740 – 1 June 1826) was an Alsatian pastor and a philanthropist. He has been known as John Frederic(k) Oberlin in English, Jean-Frédéric Oberlin in French, and Johann Friedrich Oberlin in German.

==Life==

Oberlin was born the son of Johann Georg Oberlin (1701–1770), a teacher, and Maria Magdalena (1718–1787), daughter of lawyer Johann Heinrich Feltz, on 31 August 1740 in the German-speaking city of Strasbourg, where he studied theology. In 1766 he became Protestant pastor of Waldbach (now Waldersbach), a remote and barren region in the Steinthal (Ban de la Roche/Steintal), a valley in the Vosges on the borders of Alsace and Lorraine.
Oberlin set out to improve both the material and the spiritual condition of the inhabitants. He began by encouraging the construction of roads through the valley and the erection of bridges, rallying the peasantry to the enterprise by his personal example. He introduced an improved system of agriculture. Substantial cottages were erected, and various industrial arts were introduced. He founded an itinerant library, originated infant schools (precursors of the modern nursery schools of France) and established an ordinary school at each of the five villages in the parish. In the work of education he received great assistance from his housekeeper, Louisa Scheppler (1763–1837). He practiced medicine among them, founded a savings and loan bank and introduced cotton manufacturing.

Beside all this Oberlin was a man of rare spirituality, being frequently styled &quot;a saint of the Protestant church,&quot; and an excellent pastor, who preached each month three sermons in French and one in German. In 1812 Daniel Legrand visited the Steinthal (Ban de la Roche), where he met Oberlin, who lived in Waldersbach. Legrand came under the spell of the pastor, and moved with his ribbon factory to the village of Urbach in the vicinity of Waldersbach, where he lived for the rest of his life.

Oberlin died at Waldersbach on 1 June 1826 and was interred with great manifestations of honor and affection at Urbach (now Fouday, Bas Rhin).

==Legacy==

Oberlin has been called the &quot;true precursor of social Christianity in France.&quot;
Daniel Legrand&#x27;s grandson was Tommy Fallot, founder of &quot;Christianisme social.&quot;
Legrand and Robert Owen (1771–1853) of Wales, another industrialist, advocated creation of an international organization dedicated to reform of labor laws.
Oberlin&#x27;s orphan asylums were the beginning of the many &quot;Oberlinvereine&quot; for the protection of children, such as in Leonberg, Potsdam and Worms.

Oberlin, Ohio, founded as a Christian settlement, and its centerpiece, Oberlin College, a liberal arts college, were named for him upon their founding in 1833. J. F. Oberlin University in Tokyo, Japan, which was named for Oberlin College, also bears his name. Oberlin, Louisiana, was also named after him.

His brother Jérémie Jacques Oberlin was a noted archaeologist and philologist.

<text>Washwood Heath is a ward in Birmingham, within the formal district of Hodge Hill, roughly two miles north-east of Birmingham city centre, England. Washwood Heath covers the areas of Birmingham that lie between Nechells, Bordesley Green, Stechford and Hodge Hill.

== Geography ==
Saltley on the south-western side and Ward End on the north-eastern side of Washwood Heath are the two areas that cover the entire ward, though some parts near Nechells and Hodge Hill do not come under either of these and are simply headed under &quot;Washwood Heath&quot;. One of the area&#x27;s major employers was the railway works owned by Metropolitan-Cammell (later Alstom), but it closed in 2005.

In the 2020s, Washwood Heath railway depot is to be constructed as part of the High Speed 2 project - to service and maintain the high speed trains.

==Demographics==
According to the 2001 Population Census, there were 27,822 people living in the ward with a population density of 5,335 people per km2 compared with 3,649 people per km2 for Birmingham. The area is 5.2 km2. Washwood Heath is an ethnically diverse community with 57% (15,863) of the ward&#x27;s population being of an ethnic minority compared with 29.6% for Birmingham. It had been a major Irish community.

==Education==
The area is served by Washwood Heath Academy. For the younger population, there is a children&#x27;s centre.

==Politics==
The ward is represented on Birmingham City Council by three councillors: Mariam Khan, Ansar Ali Khan and Mohammed Idrees, all Labour.

===Project Champion===
Project Champion was a project to install a £3m network of 169 Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras to monitor vehicles entering and leaving Washwood Heath and Sparkbrook. Its implementation was frozen in June 2010 amid allegations that the police deliberately misled councillors about its purpose, after it was revealed that it was being funded as an anti-terrorism initiative, rather than for &#x27;reassurance and crime prevention&#x27;.

==The Ward End Works==
In 1914 the Electric &amp; Ordnance Accessories Company Ltd (Vickers, Sons &amp; Maxim) constructed a large factory between Common Lane and Drews Lane in the Ward End area of Washwood Heath. The Ward End Works covered an area of upon completion. A distinctive feature was the Bromford House administrative block, with its façade fronting onto Drews Lane.

The factory was an assembly plant and before the outbreak of hostilities produced a light car called the Stellite. During its first four years, the factory also produced munitions fuses and shell cases for soldiers fighting in mainland Europe during World War I. When the war was over, Vickers, the owners of Electric &amp; Ordnance Accessories Company Ltd, put the factory under the ownership of another subsidiary Wolseley Motors on 30 September 1919. After the change in ownership, Wolseley replaced the small workshop sheds with a large assembly building.

Wolseley began to encounter difficulties in the 1920s and it was saved after being purchased by William Morris. As a result of the purchase, car manufacturing was completely moved from the Adderley Park site, which became Morris Commercials, to the Ward End Works. Engines for the Morris Minor were also produced at the factory during the 1930s alongside the Wolseley production line.

When World War II broke out in 1939 the factory became the production base for tanks and military vehicles as well as mines. In 1941, it also began to produce the Horsa glider. By the end of the war, £500,000 worth of damage had been inflicted on the plant by the Luftwaffe in raids in 1941 and 1942.

In 1939 a new factory for the Morris Motors Pressing Branch was constructed on the Common Lane side of the Ward End Works. This was renamed Nuffield Metal Products in 1945. Production of Wolseley cars recommenced on 4 September 1945.

In 1948 the works began to encounter new problems and it was seen to be more efficient for production of new Morrises to be moved to Cowley in Oxford. By the 1950s, production was centred at Cowley and the Ward End Works were used in the productions of Nuffield Group products. Following the formation of the British Motor Corporation in 1952, parts were also made there for Austin-Healey Sprite, and the Wolseley 1500/Riley 1.5 twins. The formation of British Leyland resulted in the plant being redesignated the Austin Morris division&#x27;s Transmission Plant. 4,400 workers were employed on site.

When the Adderley Park plant closed in 1972 all vehicle production was moved to the Common Lane works. During the mid-1980s there was a fire at the factory however no other problems surfaced.

In 1989 Freight Rover became Leyland-DAF Vans, which then became the LDV Group in 1993. The site covered , with Bromford House being used as the company&#x27;s headquarters. The works have since been demolished.

The former Metro-Cammell and Leyland DAF Vans sites are to be redeveloped as the Washwood Heath depot for High Speed 2.

<text>Stockland Green is an area of Birmingham, England.

It gives its name to a ward which is part of the Erdington formal district, and is located to the south-west of Erdington and north-east of Birmingham City Centre. The area is often mistakenly identified as Erdington, normally through domestic and commercial addresses. The area however has its own council ward and is outside Erdington&#x27;s traditional boundaries, previously in the Birmingham Aston constituency.

==Demographics==
The 2001 Population Census recorded that there were 23,060 people living in the ward with a population density of 4,487 people per km2 compared with 3,649 people per km2 for Birmingham. 24.7% (5,706) of the ward&#x27;s population consists of ethnic minorities compared with 29.6% for Birmingham in general.

==Politics==
The ward was dominated by the Labour Party between the mid-1980s to 2007 and sent three Labour councillors to Birmingham City Council. However, in 2008 this changed when Matt Bennett won for the local Conservative Party.

Ward boundaries changed in 2018 and Stockland Green was reduced from three councillors to two; the ward no longer included Gravelly Hill which became a single-member ward.

Stockland Green has a Ward Support Officer.

==Places of interest==
Points of interest include Witton Cemetery, one of the largest cemeteries in the Midlands, which can be seen from the M6 motorway. Other areas include the Josiah Mason/Stockland Green complex of schools and colleges and Witton Lakes, an area of local beauty.

A rocky outcrop is located along the Tyburn Road. There are two major areas of open space; Bleak Hill Recreation Ground and Brookvale Park, which contains a large lake.

Stockland Green Community Leisure Centre serves the area.

==Transport==
Three major roads dissect the area; Tyburn Road (A38), Gravelly Hill (A5127) and Reservoir Road (A4040). The M6 motorway is situated in the southern boundary of the ward.

Gravelly Hill railway station on the Cross-City Line is on the boundary of Stockland Green and Gravelly Hill wards.

<text>William Heath (March 2, 1737 – January 24, 1814) was an American farmer, soldier, and political leader from Massachusetts who served as a major general in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.

==Life and career==
Heath made his home for his entire life at his family&#x27;s farm in Roxbury, Massachusetts (present day Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, part of the city of Boston). He was born on a farm that had been settled in 1636 by his ancestors. He became active in the militia, and was a captain of the Roxbury Company of the Suffolk County militia regiment in 1760. By 1770 he was the regiment&#x27;s colonel and its commanding officer.

In 1765 he was elected as a member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts and was elected as the company&#x27;s lieutenant in 1768 and as its captain in 1770.

In December 1774 the revolutionary government in Massachusetts commissioned him as a brigadier general. He commanded Massachusetts forces during the last stage of the Battle of Lexington and Concord in April 1775. As the siege of Boston began, Heath devoted himself to training the militia involved in the siege. In June of that year, Massachusetts named him a major general in the state troops, and the Continental Congress commissioned him a brigadier general in the newly formed Continental Army.

In 1776 Heath participated in the defense of New York City, and was one of those who urged General Washington not to abandon the city. He saw action at Long Island, Harlem Heights, and White Plains. In August 1776 he was promoted to major general in the Continental Army, but Washington had doubts about Heath&#x27;s abilities and posted him where no action was expected. In November he was placed in command of forces in the Hudson River Highlands. In January 1777, Washington instructed Heath to attack Fort Independence in New York in support of Washington&#x27;s actions at Trenton and Princeton, but Heath&#x27;s attack was botched and his troops were routed. He was censured by Washington and thereafter was never given command of troops in combat.

General Heath was placed in charge of the Convention Army of John Burgoyne’s surrendered troops after the Battle of Saratoga. In 1780 he returned to command the Highland Department after Benedict Arnold’s treason.

He was admitted as an original member of The Society of the Cincinnati in the state of Massachusetts when it was established in 1783.

After the war, Heath was a member of the Massachusetts Convention that ratified the United States Constitution in 1788. He served in the Massachusetts Senate from 1791 to 1792, and as a probate court judge. He was also a candidate for Congress in 1792 and 1798, and was the Democratic-Republican nominee in the 1799 gubernatorial election. In 1806 he was elected the Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts, but declined the office.

He died at his home in Roxbury on January 24, 1814, and was buried nearby in Forest Hills Cemetery. The town of Heath, Massachusetts, is named in his honor. A street in the west Bronx is named in his honor.

<doc id="845060" wikidata="Q2185349" url="?curid=845060" title="Fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry">
<text>The fundamental theorem of [[Riemannian geometry]] states that on any Riemannian manifold (or pseudo-Riemannian manifold) there is a unique affine connection that is torsion-free and metric-compatible, called the &quot;Levi-Civita connection&quot; or &quot;Riemannian connection&quot; of the given metric. Because it is canonically defined by such properties, this connection is often automatically used when given a metric.

==Statement==
The theorem can be stated as follows:
Fundamental theorem of Riemannian Geometry. Let be a Riemannian manifold (or pseudo-Riemannian manifold). Then there is a unique connection which satisfies the following conditions:
* for any vector fields , , and we have formula_1 where denotes the derivative of the function along vector field .
* for any vector fields , , formula_2 where denotes the Lie bracket of and . 
The first condition is called &quot;metric-compatibility&quot; of . It may be equivalently expressed by saying that, given any curve in , the inner product of any two –parallel vector fields along the curve is constant. It may also be equivalently phrased as saying that the metric tensor is preserved by parallel transport, which is to say that the metric is parallel when considering the natural extension of to act on (0,2)-tensor fields: . It is further equivalent to require that the connection is induced by a principal bundle connection on the orthonormal frame bundle.

The second condition is sometimes called &quot;symmetry&quot; of . It expresses the condition that the torsion of is zero, and as such is also called &quot;torsion-freeness&quot;. There are alternative characterizations.

An extension of the fundamental theorem states that given a pseudo-Riemannian manifold there is a unique connection preserving the metric tensor, with any given vector-valued 2-form as its torsion. The difference between an arbitrary connection (with torsion) and the corresponding Levi-Civita connection is the contorsion tensor.

The fundamental theorem asserts both existence and uniqueness of a certain connection, which is called the &quot;Levi-Civita connection&quot; or &quot;Riemannian connection&quot;. However, the existence result is extremely direct, as the connection in question may be explicitly defined by either the &quot;second Christoffel identity&quot; or &quot;Koszul formula&quot; as obtained in the proofs below. This explicit definition expresses the Levi-Civita connection in terms of the metric and its first derivatives. As such, if the metric is -times continuously differentiable, then the Levi-Civita connection is -times continuously differentiable.

The Levi-Civita connection can also be characterized in other ways, for instance via the Palatini variation of the Einstein–Hilbert action.

==Proof==
The proof of the theorem can be presented in various ways. Here the proof is first given in the language of coordinates and Christoffel symbols, and then in the coordinate-free language of covariant derivatives. Regardless of the presentation, the idea is to use the metric-compatibility and torsion-freeness conditions to obtain a direct formula for any connection that is both metric-compatible and torsion-free. This establishes the uniqueness claim in the fundamental theorem. To establish the existence claim, it must be directly checked that the formula obtained does define a connection as desired.
===Local coordinates===
Here the Einstein summation convention will be used, which is to say that an index repeated as both subscript and superscript is being summed over all values. Let denote the dimension of . Recall that, relative to a local chart, a connection is given by smooth functions
formula_3
with
formula_4
for any vector fields and . Torsion-freeness of the connection refers to the condition that for arbitrary and . Written in terms of local coordinates, this is equivalent to
formula_5
which by arbitrariness of and is equivalent to the condition . Similarly, the condition of metric-compatibility is equivalent to the condition
formula_6
In this way, it is seen that the conditions of torsion-freeness and metric-compatibility can be viewed as a linear system of equations for the connection, in which the coefficients and &#x27;right-hand side&#x27; of the system are given by the metric and its first derivative. The fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry can be viewed as saying that this linear system has a unique solution. This is seen via the following computation:
formula_7
in which the metric-compatibility condition is used three times for the first equality and the torsion-free condition is used three times for the second equality. The resulting formula is sometimes known as the &quot;first Christoffel identity&quot;. It can be contracted with the inverse of the metric, , to find the &quot;second Christoffel identity&quot;:
formula_8
This proves the uniqueness of a torsion-free and metric-compatible condition; that is, any such connection must be given by the above formula. To prove the existence, it must be checked that the above formula defines a connection that is torsion-free and metric-compatible. This can be done directly.

===Invariant formulation===
The above proof can also be expressed in terms of vector fields. Torsion-freeness refers to the condition that
formula_2
and metric-compatibility refers to the condition that
formula_10
where , , and are arbitrary vector fields. The computation previously done in local coordinates can be written as
formula_11
This reduces immediately to the first Christoffel identity in the case that , , and are coordinate vector fields. The equations displayed above can be rearranged to produce the &quot;Koszul formula&quot; or &quot;identity&quot;
formula_12
This proves the uniqueness of a torsion-free and metric-compatible condition, since if is equal to for arbitrary , then must equal . This is a consequence of the &quot;non-degeneracy&quot; of the metric. In the local formulation above, this key property of the metric was implicitly used, in the same way, via the existence of . Furthermore, by the same reasoning, the Koszul formula can be used to define a vector field when given and , and it is routine to check that this defines a connection that is torsion-free and metric-compatible.

<text>The Spring Mountains are a mountain range of Southern Nevada in the United States, running generally northwest–southeast along the west side of Las Vegas and south to the border with California. Most land in the mountains is owned by the United States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management and managed as the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area within the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest and the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area.

==Geography==
The Spring Mountains range is named for the number of springs to be found, many of them in the recesses of Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area, which is on the eastern side of the mountains.

The Spring Mountains divide the Pahrump Valley and Amargosa River basins from the Las Vegas Valley watershed, which drains into the Colorado River watershed, by way of Las Vegas Wash into Lake Mead, thus the mountains define part of the boundary of the Great Basin. The Great Basin Divide, (one of the Great Basin region borders) continues north through the Indian Springs Pass region, then turns due east at the perimeter mountain ranges north of Las Vegas.

===Mount Charleston===

The highest point is Mount Charleston (officially Charleston Peak), at . The area around Mount Charleston is protected in the Mount Charleston Wilderness. The main town in the area is also named Mount Charleston (Nevada), which lies in Kyle Canyon. The area is typically 30-40 °F cooler than the valleys below, and it is a popular getaway for Las Vegas residents and visitors. The Lee Canyon (Ski and Snowboard Resort) lies in Lee Canyon on State Highway 156.

===Strawberry Valley===
Strawberry Valley is the gap pass on the north point of the Spring Mountains. U.S. Route 95 in Nevada goes though the pass. Nevada State Route 160 is just west of the Strawberry Valley pass.

===Other peaks===

In addition to Mount Charleston, other major summits in the Spring Mountains range include Bonanza Peak, McFarland Peak, Mummy Mountain, Griffith Peak, Bridge Mountain, Mount Wilson and Mount Potosi.

== Biological diversity ==
The Spring Mountains are a sky island ecosystem. With an area around , and a vertical range of nearly , the mountains encompass a wide variety of habitats, and the biological diversity is probably greater than anywhere else in Nevada; 37 species of trees are known (more than any other Nevadan range), and 600 species of vascular plants have been reported from the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area alone.

The bases of the mountains are part of the Mojave zone dominated by creosote bush and white bursage, then rising to a blackbush scrub zone, followed by a pygmy conifer zone with juniper, pinyon pine, and mountain mahogany, and topped by a montane zone with many species of conifers around Mt. Charleston and its connecting ridges.

Palmer&#x27;s chipmunk is endemic to the Spring Mountains.

<doc id="845070" wikidata="Q7985340" url="?curid=845070" title="West Heath, West Midlands">
<text>West Heath is a residential area of Birmingham, England on the boundary with Worcestershire. Forming the larger part of the ward of Longbridge And West Heath it is situated between Kings Norton, Northfield, Longbridge and Cofton Hackett and lies on traditional heathland formed in the 13th century as part of the Kings Norton manorial lands, and was historically in Worcestershire.

Based on a small village formed in the early 1900s that was originally centred on the medieval Lilley Lane, the majority of West Heath&#x27;s expansion and growth took place just after World War II. The original expansion in the 1940s and 1950s consisted of large numbers of prefab houses, most of which were eventually replaced by permanent housing estates in the 1960s and 1970s.

There are a number of buildings in West Heath that date to the 19th century and earlier. The suburb is adjacent to rural Worcestershire and a number of public footpaths allow open access to the surrounding fields up to Hopwood, Cofton Hackett and the Lickey Hills.

==History==

===Early history===
In early Anglo-Saxon times, West Heath lay at the northernmost border of the lands of the Hwicce, a people who occupied the former territory of the British tribe, The Dobunni. As part of what would become Kings Norton, West Heath was positioned slightly to the north of the boundary between two tribes, the &quot;Pencersaetan&quot; and the &quot;Tomsaetan&quot;.

There is evidence of the previous presence of Romans in West Heath – in 1949, Roman coins of the reign of Emperor Hadrian were unearthed in Coney Green Drive in the Austin Village and there was a further discovery of coins of the reign of the Emperor Diocletian in 1966 in Hawkesley Drive, also in the Austin Village.

One of the earliest mentions of West Heath is in the Saxon lease of land at Coston Hackett in 849 AD detailing a grant by Worcester&#x27;s Bishop Ealhhun to King Berhtwulf, King of Mercia. West Heath and parts of Kings Norton would remain part of Coston Hackett manor estates as late as the early 20th century. West Heath was mentioned in the manorial court roll of Bromsgrove and Kings Norton in 1267 when it was recorded that &quot;Richard de Coſton has a purpresture (i.e. an enclosure of tenants land or an enclosure of waste land) upon Westhethe, Richard de Coſton holds four acres in Westhethe and does nothing in service to the King. Alexander and Gregory de Coſton hold land in Westhethe, Master John de Aluvechurch as (sic) 1 and half acres of purpresture upon &quot;La Westhethe&quot; by permission of Robert de Coſton&quot;. In 1494 it was recorded that &quot;Baldwin Lyndon – banks in ruins between Hawkesley Pole and Westhethe...fined 2d&quot; whilst the Abbot of Bordesley was fined 8d &quot;through defect in cleansing the banks at West Hethe&quot;. In 1596, a woman called Joan was fined 6d because &quot;she enclosed a parcel of the King&#x27;s waste at West Heath&quot;.

Turves Green was known as Turvosland in 1490 and was the site for peat-cutting for fuel. There is a layer of peat a few feet below the surface and deeper still are successive layers of clay and a coal seam and a bloomery has been discovered – this is the first form of forge for smelting iron from ore leaving less bulk to transport for further smelting to refine the metal. In 1442 Turves Green had been named Le Grene Slave, Greenway Lane in 1780 and Green Lane in 1877.

During the English Civil War West Heath was on the border between royalist Worcestershire and parliamentary Warwickshire and there were regular minor skirmishes and conflicts between the forces of the two opposing sides. Situated off Turves Green, Hawkesley House, which belonged to the royalist George Middlemore and his family, was besieged and seized by parliamentary forces under Colonel Tinker Fox in April 1644. The Parliamentarians fortified the building but on 13 May 1645 Royalist forces under the king’s nephews Prince Rupert and Prince Maurice laid siege to Hawkesley House and were joined the following day by King Charles I who had been staying at nearby Cofton Hall. The Royalists took the house on 16 May and expelled the Parliamentary forces and razed the house to the ground. The inhabitants of West Heath would also have been aware of other clashes close by during the Civil War. Two miles away at Kings Norton Prince Rupert with eight troops of horses and 300 foot soldiers was engaged on 17 October 1642 on Kings Norton Green by a Parliamentary force of 800 foot soldiers and horsemen on its way to join the Earl of Essex at Worcester. The Royalists were routed by the Parliamentarians under Lord Willoughby Of Parham and fifty Royalist troops were killed and buried in an unmarked grave in King&#x27;s Norton Churchyard. On 10 July 1643 Queen Henrietta Maria arrived in Kings Norton with 3000 horsemen, 30 companies of foot soldiers and artillery and camped there en route to Oxford where she planned to join King Charles. She passed the night in the ‘Saracen&#x27;s Head’ while the location of the site where the soldiers camped is said to be where ‘The Camp’ public house is now located.

This historic association with the Civil War is marked by the naming of several roads in West Heath such as Fairfax Road, Cropredy Road, Edgehill Road and a public house named &quot;The Cavalier&quot; on Fairfax Rd.

William Middlemore rebuilt Hawkesley House in 1654 but by the 19th century its status was simply that of a farmhouse, called Hawkesley Farm, until it was demolished in 1957. A municipal block of flats – ‘Moat House’ – was built on the spot of the original Hawkesley House in 1971. The ancient moat can still be seen near Moat House.

From earliest times, what is now known as West Heath Road had been a trackway until 1796 when it was surfaced to become part of the Stourbridge to Wooten Wawen turnpike road. It remained a turnpike until 1820 with a toll-house at the junction of what are now Alvechurch and Redhill Roads, recorded in 1813. National censuses for the 19th century reveal that the inhabitants were principally farmers, agricultural labourers or nail-makers. West Heath formed a part of Kings Norton, linking Kings Norton isthmus-like to Rednal which was also part of the district and the area was principally used as livestock grazing land. The land was jealously guarded – in the fifteenth century, during the reign of Edward IV, the manor court ruled that &quot;No man shall take in foreign cattle to keep on the common&quot; and in 1641, John Brookes of Cofton Hackett was fined five shillings for keeping a great flock of sheep on the common, &quot;being a foreigner&quot;. Alan The Bailiff in the fifteenth century, had been charged to &quot;drive&quot; the common two or three times a year to discover the nature of the stock being pastured there and to ensure that no one should keep above five colts, horses or mares upon the common. Inhabitants were sometimes fined for &quot;encroaching&quot; (enclosing small areas) on the common although these may actually have been payments to regularise a new practice rather than a form of punishment.

After the Civil War, a Parliamentary Survey of &quot;The Manor of Kingsesnorton&quot; produced in 1649 because the manor &quot;was in the hands of Parliament by reason of the seizure of the lands of King Charles I&quot;, reported that &quot;The soil of the heaths, wastes, and commons called... West Heath, and the archery (and all of them do contain in the whole by estimate of 3,000 acres or thereabouts) are the lord&#x27;s and the trees thereon growing and &quot;the bitt&quot; belong to the tenants&quot;.

By the 19th century there was considerable local poverty and those who lived on Cofton Common were described as &quot;peasants&quot; in a reminiscence of Alice Impey who lived at Longbridge House and who recalled that when someone died there it was necessary for her father to send a cart for the body to be taken to Cofton Church and buried in the pauper&#x27;s section of the graveyard.

===Nail making in West Heath===
Apart from agriculture, nail making was the most notable industry in 19th-century West Heath. Numbers of nailers in West Heath are included in figures for Northfield and in the whole district there were 122 employed in the industry in 1831. However the industry was already in decline – in 1841 there were 74 nailers and in 1884 there were only twenty-three with only seven in West Heath. Nailers&#x27; workshops were present at Groveley, West Heath and Turves Green; the latter was still the site of hand-made nail production by Mr. Withers in Oak Tree Cottages as late as 1910 although the factory of The Patent Hob Nail &amp; Rivet Company had been opened in Station Road in 1900. The nailers&#x27; workshops were usually little lean-to sheds built against the sides of the cottages with a brick-built small furnace.

===20th century residents===
As well-drained open heath land, the area was not developed as a residential area until the early 1900s, containing only a few scattered agricultural buildings and latterly one or two grand houses in the Lilley Lane area. In 1907 Kelly&#x27;s Directory Of Birmingham records that several middle class residents were living in the larger houses of West Heath including two professors of chemistry at the new University of Birmingham – Percy Faraday Frankland F.R.S. (son of Edward Frankland, an eminent scientist who discovered chemical valency and also godson of the famous physicist, Michael Faraday) lived at The Dell and Adrian John Brown F.R.S. (whose chair at the university was actually that of Malting and Brewing and who became a pioneer in enzyme kinetics) who lived with his family in West Heath House, which was the largest residence in the village but was demolished to make way for an Elderly Person&#x27;s Home, situated at the junction of Alvechurch Road and Cofton Road. The replacement 1950s building was closed and demolished in 2016 and a newly built, 3-storey, 80-bedroom Residential Home, called &quot;Austin Rose&quot;, was opened in Autumn 2017.

Groveley Hall: The earliest building on the site probably dated back to 1530 and had been a religious institution belonging to Westbury College in Bristol but it had been confiscated as a result of The Reformation and handed to Sir Ralph Sadler, Secretary of State to King Henry VIII, in 1536. In 1548 the property was bought by John Coombes and later by John Lyttleton and after 1600 by Francis Heaton. In the early nineteenth century the house belonged to Robert Middleton Biddulph from whose family John Merry obtained the property around 1820. It passed through the Merry family, eventually being purchased by Ambrose Biggs, a tobacco manufacturer and merchant who was also a mayor of Birmingham, in 1872. Biggs was declared bankrupt in 1883, at which point the estate was purchased by Joseph Billing Baldwin, paper maker of Kings Norton. The property remained in the Baldwin family until 1937. It became the home of Robert Jolly, a physician, his wife Fanny (Joseph B. Baldwin&#x27;s daughter), and Baldwin&#x27;s son Major James Baldwin (d.1922). Neither Fanny nor James had children. Fanny left the property to the National Trust in her will, intending it to be a holiday home for distressed gentlefolk. The nearby Dingle Farm, formerly the farmhouse serving the Groveley estate, remains in National Trust hands as a private property.

Elsewhere in West Heath, Lieutenant Meynell Hunt lived at Groveley House. The only houses on Cofton Common which are mentioned in the Directory were both owned by women – Mrs. Higgins at Fern Bank and Mrs. Avery.

The surname Hobbis had been particularly common in the area in the 19th century and people with that name included farmers, agricultural workers and (in Kings Norton village) the publican of the inn, The Plumber&#x27;s Arms, but no one named Hobbis is listed in the 1907 Directory as owning property in West Heath although a small piece of land in what is now Alvechurch Road was known as Hobbis&#x27; Piece and was then owned by Adam Webb, chief clerk in an assurance company, another solid middle class inhabitant of that time in West Heath.

The only farmer recorded to be living in Turves Green in the late nineteenth century censuses was Thomas Morris, born in 1865, but in 1907 he was mentioned in Kelly&#x27;s Directory as either living at Longbridge or Staple Old Road.

In 1874, the Impey family moved from Edgbaston to Longbridge House, which had been Prince Rupert&#x27;s headquarters during the siege of Hawlesley House in 1645 during the Civil War. Frederick Impey was a partner in Messrs White and Pikes which owned a printing works in Moor Street in Birmingham and which was developing a method of colour printing onto tin. Impey opened a factory in the area to carry out this process but it was burned down in 1900 and not reopened. Herbert Austin subsequently bought the site to build premises for motor car manufacture. In 1910, the Impeys moved to &quot;The Island&quot;, a large house in West Heath situated between Turves Green and West Heath Road, but moved away when Frederick Impey died in 1920. Like the Cadbury family who lived in neighbouring Northfield, the Impeys were Quakers and as well as being important developers of local industry, showed considerable interest in improving the lot of their factory workers.

The first post office in West Heath was opened on 5 June 1892 although the 1891 census records a rural postman, John Cook, to be living in West Heath. Mail was cancelled with the village&#x27;s name by the use of a rubber canceller. The first postmaster of West Heath was William A. Jarvis who was recorded in the 1901 English census as also being a grocer at 37 West Heath Lane, the post office having been opened at that address in 1899 in the newly built &quot;West Villas&quot; and this coincided with the post office becoming a money office and savings bank on 1 May of that year. Jarvis&#x27;s wife, Sarah, was described as &quot;Postmistress&quot; in 1901 and Jarvis remained the postmaster until 1912 by which time West Heath Lane had been renamed as Alvechurch Road and West Villas had been allocated the address of no. 53 Alvechurch Road. West Heath post office&#x27;s status changed from that of a rural post office to a town sub-post office on 20 August 1916. It continues to operate but with very limited services.

===Hospital===
West Heath Hospital was established as an infectious diseases hospital in 1889, became a tuberculosis hospital in 1910 and was refocused as a geriatric hospital in 1980.

===Expansion===
In 1900 visitors arriving via Northfield railway station could visit the skating rink on West Heath Road next to the bridge over the river Rea. Unfortunately the skating rink was used during the First World War as a munitions factory and following an accident the rink was destroyed by fire.

In the 1930s small terraced houses that were built along Alvechurch Road and Sir Hilton&#x27;s Road, and slightly grander semi-detached and detached houses, along West Heath Road and Redditch Road began to change the traditional rural nature of West Heath. The newer high density housing estates built two decades later would complete the change.

The rapid expansion of West Heath and its transition from open farmland to residential suburb of Birmingham had commenced in the years immediately after the Second World War when several extensive estates of pre-fab houses were quickly erected to house returning servicemen and families made homeless during wartime bombing raids.

Another notable building of the area was &quot;The Bath Tub&quot; open air lido (now demolished), opened on 1 July 1937 in Alvechurch Road, where 20,000 people had gathered to watch the opening ceremony by Gracie Fields with Mantovani and his orchestra and the M.P. for Northfield and Kings Norton, Ronald Cartland, the brother of Dame Barbara Cartland, the novelist. The lido which had been built by Percy Hollier who intended it to be &quot;Birmingham&#x27;s brightest entertainment spot&quot; and which included a 180 feet by 90 feet sized swimming pool as well as a putting green, lawn for archery and a children&#x27;s playground, only operated for 3 years and was closed due to commercial failure. Laughtons took over the site with Eddystone Radio during the war when its rural location helped it to avoid attack by German air raids. The lido site is now covered by a housing estate. There is also the art deco Man On The Moon pub on Redditch Road, which was built in 1937 (originally as The Man In The Moon but the name was changed in 1969 to commemorate the first Moon landing).

Prior to 1938, when a school was opened in Turves Green, children had attended St. Anne&#x27;s Church School in West Heath. The headmistress of that school, Miss Mary Davies, was appointed to be headmistress at Turves Green where a junior school was first opened and then, in 1939, a school for seniors. 
A Catholic Primary School linked to the parish of St. John Fisher was opened in Alvechurch Road on 5 September 1961 on the remaining part of an industrial estate next to Hobbis&#x27; Piece to accommodate the large number of local children of Irish Catholic origin (at the time 60% of children attending the school passed their summer holidays in Ireland). A tree was donated to the school by the Birmingham Tree Lovers charity but was cut down in 2010 to make way for a car park.

In the 1950s the population of West Heath continued to increase and change considerably. Working-class families who had lived in central Birmingham in old unsuitable properties which were to be demolished and a considerable number of Irish immigrant families settled in the new homes on the newly built council estates around Cofton Common and the land between it and Turves Green. Local work was plentiful, especially at the Austin Motor Works at Longbridge and, for the women, at Cadbury&#x27;s chocolate factory in Bournville or the Kalamazoo paper factory in Longbridge, which had been moved to the area by Oliver Morland and F. Paul Impey in 1913 from central Birmingham.

===Services===

West Heath has a small, somewhat neglected shopping area on Alvechurch Road and there is an Art Deco building which previously housed a Co-Operative store which closed in 2018. Other facilities include a Chinese Food Takeaway shop, a Fish and Chip shop, a sandwich shop, an undertaker&#x27;s, a dry cleaner&#x27;s, two pharmacies and an optician&#x27;s shop. The post office with very limited services is still located at &quot;West Villas&quot; on Alvechurch Road. There is a “Tesco Express” supermarket located in the building which previously housed “The Fordrough” public house.

Located on West Heath Road is a primary health care centre, built in 2011, replacing the former surgery which had been situated in a 1930s detached house neighbouring the previous residence of a former general practitioner, Dr Anthony (Antek) Bobak who had set up his practice in 1954. Another general practitioner&#x27;s surgery, that of Dr. Shan, was located for many years on Alvechurch Road.

A children&#x27;s nursery is also located on West Heath Road. There are other doctors&#x27; surgeries and nurseries in the area. West Heath Hospital is located on Rednal Road and nearby, on Ivyhouse Road, there is a rehabilitation hospital for people with brain injury. There are two elderly persons&#x27; homes, primary schools, a community centre in Hampstead House (a second community centre, Oddingley Hall, is actually situated in Kings Norton), recreation grounds and other basic facilities.

West Heath Library, previously situated near the former Fordrough public house off West Heath Road, was closed by Birmingham City Council in January 2014 despite a vigorous local community-based campaign to fight the closure. More than 110 local residents attended a public protest outside the library building on 12 April 2014 to further the aims of the campaign against closure. At the meeting the local Labour councillor strenuously reassured the campaigners that a local library service would continue but an announcement by Labour-run Birmingham City Council, made in mid-February 2016, revealed that plans for a new building had been withdrawn and that a library may be opened in the future elsewhere. Subsequently, on 9 April 2016, a rally of 50 people including the Member of Parliament for Northfield, the Leader of Birmingham City Council and the three Northfield City Councillors, was held at the site of the old West Heath library to call for a new building to be constructed on this site but nothing came of this. The area is now served by a weekly mobile library service but there is a move to relocate some library facilities to the West Heath Community Centre at Hampstead House.
Before moving to the Fordrough, there was a library situated next to St Anne&#x27;s Church in a prefabricated building on Lilley Lane.

===Events===
For many years an annual West Heath Flower And Produce Show was held at the beginning of September. It was originally held at St. Anne&#x27;s Church Hall but from the 77th Show in 2011 it was located in Hampstead House in Condover Road, West Heath&#x27;s Community Centre. The holding of the annual Flower And Produce Show has now been discontinued. There is an annual West Heath Art Exhibition held at Hampstead House.

An annual summer fete for the local community is held in June at Hampstead House.

An annual West Heath Beer and Cider festival is held at Hampstead House usually in late September or early October.

The ‘Velo Birmingham 2019’ cycling event passed through West Heath on 13 May 2019 when cyclists rode through the area along Rednal Road, up Lilley Lane, around West Heath green and along Cofton Road and Groveley Lane. The same event was to have taken place in 2020 but was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

===The area===
There is a green which forms an island around which the roads from Kings Norton to Rednal and Northfield to Alvechurch pass and at the centre of which is a large and old oak tree. The green is planted with bulbs which provide a colourful display in spring. On either side of the green are St. John Fisher church and St. Anne&#x27;s church as well as a residential home for the elderly and new housing. There is also a very large oak tree situated at the corner of Longbridge Lane and Groveley Lane which has been named &quot;The Cofton Oak&quot; and which was the subject of a campaign to preserve it when it was threatened by plans to have it removed.

Council estates were constructed after 1945, both at West Heath and Turves Green. Both areas feature a large number of terraces and semi-detached houses with some Tower blocks at Fairfax Road which latterly have become known as &#x27;The Poets&#x27; Blocks&#x27;, each being named after a famous British poet (Shakespeare, Wordsworth and Tennyson). The first flats to be built in West Heath were 3 six storey blocks in Turves Green constructed in 1952 by Deeley for the then Birmingham County Borough Council in an Art Deco style. The three blocks, Oxford House, Aylesbury House and Buckingham House, were demolished in 1999.

A high-density private estate was built on the former grounds of West Heath Hospital. Turves Green at one time had nine residential towers, several blocks of low-rise flats, and an estate of pre-fabricated bungalows and brick semi-detached houses, known as the Austin Village, which was built in 1916 to house First World War munitions workers. The Austin Village has been a Conservation area from the early 1990s but in 2019 Birmingham City Council decided to withdraw its special status though it has extended the time allowed for an appeal against this decision in the face of a campaign led by the Austin Village Preservation Society.

West Heath Park is located at the north-east boundary of West Heath with Kings Norton. Amenities include children&#x27;s recreation facilities and football pitches and nearby is Oddingley Hall, the second of West Heath&#x27;s Community centres, though this is located in Kings Norton.

Cofton Park, where Pope Benedict XVI attended a service for the beatification of Cardinal John Henry Newman on 19 September 2010, is situated within the boundaries of the Longbridge and West Heath electoral ward. Various public events are held in the park including, annually, the Longbridge Pride event which celebrates the heritage of the Longbridge motor works.

==Governance==
===Historical===
Historically, in the Middle Ages West Heath was part of the upper division of Halfshire Hundred that also contained Bromsgrove, Coston Hackett, Dodderhill, Doverdale, Droitwich, Elmbridge, Feckenham, Hadsor, Hampton Lovett, Kington, Kings Norton, Northfield, Salwarpe, Tardebigge and Upton Warren. However, West Heath was incorporated in the City of Birmingham in 1911 when the Kings Norton and Northfield Urban District Council was abolished.

===Westminster===
The area is in the Birmingham Northfield parliamentary constituency and is represented by Gary Sambrook (Conservative Party) who was elected on 12 December 2019.

===Birmingham City Council===
West Heath is represented on Birmingham City Council as part of the Ward of Longbridge And West Heath by two councillors:- Deborah Clancy (Conservative), re-elected 5 May 2022, and Ron Storer (Conservative), elected 5 May 2022.

Prior to May 2018 West Heath, apart from a small part at the southern edge from 2004, was represented on Birmingham City Council by the three Northfield councillors. Previous councillors from 1973 when local government boundaries had been considerably altered include Neil Scrimshaw who died in office to be succeeded by his wife, Margaret Scrimshaw (1984-1996 and 1999-2004), Reg Corns (1973-1994, re-elected 2000-15), Les Lawrence (1982-1995 and 1998-2012), Randal Brew (2004-2018 and previously Councillor for Longbridge, Lord Mayor of Birmingham 2007-8) and Edwina Currie (1975-1986, later Member of Parliament for South Derbyshire and government minister and mistress of Prime Minister John Major).

As part of the reorganisation of representation on Birmingham council, the Local Government Boundary Commission England released a report in 2015 which proposed West Heath become a ward of the city with a single councillor. The suggested boundaries excluded West Heath village on Alvechurch Road, from the proposed West Heath ward, along with West Heath parish church, West Heath post office, West Heath Community Centre in Hampstead House, the site of the now-closed West Heath library and West Heath medical centre. The village itself and the sites mentioned were all to be placed in a ward titled &quot;Northfield East&quot;. It was proposed &quot;Northfield East&quot; be renamed &quot;West Heath North&quot;, to reflect the reality that otherwise West Heath&#x27;s most important sites would not be included in a ward named &quot;West Heath&quot;. In response, the Local Government Boundary Commission for England recommended on 10 May 2016 that the new wards be named &quot;West Heath North&quot; and &quot;West Heath South&quot; respectively, but a final submission combined the two with part of Longbridge in a large ward with 2 councillors to be called &quot;Longbridge and West Heath&quot;. The new ward stretches from Cofton Park in the south, to West Heath Park in the north and includes West Heath village, Longbridge town centre, the Austin village, Cofton Primary School, Albert Bradbeer School, the Turves Green Schools, West Heath Primary School and St. John Fisher Roman Catholic School along with Bournville College (in Longbridge), St. Anne&#x27;s Church, St. John Fisher Church and St. John The Baptist Church in Longbridge. The ward includes Longbridge railway station, West Heath Community Centre, West Heath Hospital and notable buildings including the old railway workers cottages along Station Road, the old nailers cottage in Turves Green and The Man On The Moon pub. The ward is the most southerly in Birmingham.

==Geography==

===Geology===
West Heath is built on a well-drained stretch of gravel and sand that had been laid down under a prehistoric shallow sea and enriched by sediments from ice age glaciers. The natural heath land had grown on a flatter area between the nearby Lickey Hills and Redhill. The Lickey Hills area includes a wide geological range of rocks of various ages. The stratigraphic sequence, which is the basis for the area&#x27;s diversity of landscape and habitat, comprises:

*Barnt Green rocks – Precambrian tuffs and volcanic grits
*Lickey Quartzite – a Cambrian quartzite
*Keele Clay – a Carboniferous clay
*Rubery sandstone – a fossiliferous sandstone of lower Silurian age
*Clent Breccia – a Permian breccia
*Bunter Pebble Beds – beds of Triassic water-worn pebbles

The subsoil layers under West Heath and Turves Green also contain a coal seam that would indicate that a prehistoric tropical forest once existed here.

===Waterways===
The River Rea runs through West Heath on its way from its source to the North Sea.
The river rises in Waseley Hills Country Park and after dropping 70 metres in the first mile passes through West Heath and onwards to Kings Norton, Selly Oak and Digbeth in the centre of Birmingham. Near Gravelly Hill Interchange, about 14 miles from its source, the Rea becomes a tributary of the River Tame and its waters eventually discharge into the North Sea via later connections with the River Trent and eventually the Humber Estuary.

Although now often reduced to a sluggish trickle, due to changes in agricultural usage and other demands, the River Rea was once a major waterway and served several working mills in West Heath and provided water for the skating rink and open air lido (now both demolished).

===Roads===
The A441 Redditch Road, which runs between Birmingham and Redditch, passes to the East, and the A38 Bristol Road South, which runs between Birmingham and Worcester and eventually Cornwall, passes to the West. The M42 and M5 Motorways are also close, providing national connections.

==Demography==
As part of the Northfield ward there are no separate demographic figures for West Heath.

In the 2011 UK census the total population of the Northfield constituency was about 101,400 living in approximately 43,000 households (in the 2001 census, approximately 25,000 people were resident in the Northfield ward, the population density being about 45 persons per hectare compared with an average of around 36.5 for Birmingham as a whole). In 2001 Northfield ward had an approximate average age of 39 compared with 36 for the city as a whole. The total population of Northfield constituency had increased by 3.5% between 2001 and 2011. In 2011, 15.1% of the population of Northfield constituency was aged 65 years and over compared with 12.9% for Birmingham as a whole.

In 2011, the White ethnic group accounted for 85.8% of the population (in 2001, 94% of all residents were White). In 2011, 4.2% of the population was recorded as being Asian in origin while in 2001, 1.5% were recorded as being of Asian Pakistani origin. Around 4.4% of the population was recorded as Black in 2011 (1.5% in 2001). The 2011 Census recorded that 8.5% of the population of Northfield had been born overseas compared with figures of 22.2% for Birmingham and 13.8% for England. In 2011, 1.8% of the population of Northfield did not speak English as their first language compared with 7.5% for the whole of Birmingham

In 2011, 60.7% of the population of Northfield (compared with 46.1% of the population of Birmingham) recorded that they were Christians, 28.5% recorded that they adhered to no religion (19.3% of Birmingham population), 6.8% did not state their religion (6.5%) and 2.3% described themselves as Muslims (21.8% of Birmingham population).

In 2011, 67.7% of the population of Northfield were economically active compared with 64.2% of the population of Birmingham while the unemployment rate in Northfield was 6.2% compared with 9.4% for Birmingham as a whole.

==Economy==
The early 1970s were difficult times for many of the West Heath inhabitants who worked at the motor works in Longbridge because of the severe industrial unrest which prevailed then with its accompanying &quot;wildcat&quot; strikes. Derek Robinson – &quot;Red Robbo&quot; – at one time lived in Alvechurch Road and he was generally seen as one of the principal leaders of the industrial action that was frequently taken against the management of the company that was then known as British Leyland.
With so many local people working at the motor works at the time the factory was of great economic importance to West Heath and there was even a pub on Longbridge Lane which was called &quot;The Jolly Fitter&quot; which depicted a happy-looking motor worker on its pub sign.

Since the closure of the Longbridge motor works there is little in the way of major industry in the area and West Heath serves as a dormitory area for central Birmingham.

There is a small industrial estate in Lightning Way off Alvechurch Road including a company which manufactures glass products, a local speciality.

==Landmarks==

==Religious sites==

* St John Fisher Catholic Church – The large influx of Irish people in the 1950s led to the establishment of the Catholic parish of St. John Fisher on 30 September 1956 with first masses being held by Father Philip Smith at Turves Green Girls School and afterwards at Archbishop Masterson Girls&#x27; School. Father Philip Smith cut the first turf on the land for a new church on 5 March 1962 and Archbishop Grimshaw laid the foundation stone on 25 June 1962 with the church being opened on 31 March 1964 and consecrated on 22 June 1972, the feast of St. John Fisher. The building was designed by the architect E. Bower Norris. Until it sustained damage and was removed in 2008 there was a large wooden sculpture of St. John Fisher dressed as Bishop of Rochester, sculpted by Jonah Jones (1919–2004), attached to the front of the church but it has now been replaced by the pattern of a cross in brick. The large Catholic population in West Heath amounts to about 900 families living in the area in 2010.
* St Anne&#x27;s Church – The Anglican Parish of St. Anne covers a geographically small area with St. Anne&#x27;s Church at the centre, the building consisting of the old church, called &quot;The Mission Church&quot; until 1942, which was built in 1900 and opened by the Bishop of Worcester on 1 December 1900 and now used as the church hall, and the new church. Work on the building of the new church began in 1968 with the consecration of St Anne&#x27;s Church and St Francis’ Chapel taking place on 4 October 1974, St Francis’ Day. West Heath became the Benefice of West Heath in the Deanery of Kings Norton in 1966. The architects of the new church were Harvey and Wicks.
* St Nicholas Church – Prior to the building of St. Anne&#x27;s, the medieval church of St. Nicholas in Kings Norton, had served West Heath as the parish church. Cofton Common lay within the parish of St. Michael&#x27;s Church at Cofton Hackett.

* Dame Barbara Cartland – it is sometimes stated that the romantic novelist who had been born in Augustus Road, Edgbaston, lived in West Heath but no published evidence is available to support this belief. It is possible that her family moved to West Heath, less affluent than Edgbaston, temporarily after her grandfather&#x27;s suicide in 1903 which followed his bankruptcy and the family&#x27;s consequent loss of wealth.
* Reverend Wilbert Vere Awdry – creator of &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine&quot;, was curate at St. Anne&#x27;s West Heath from 1940 to 1946. It was during this period of his life that Awdry first told a railway story to his son Christopher in 1943 and published his first railway story, &quot;The Three Railway Engines&quot;, in 1945. Awdry also held services at the Epiphany Church in the Austin Village.
* Bruce Chatwin – as a young child during World War II, the novelist and travel writer often lived for periods in West Heath at the home of his widowed paternal grandmother, Isobel Chatwin, who lived at 198 West Heath Road. His uncle sometimes took him to sail boats he had built at nearby Barnt Green Reservoir. Chatwin&#x27;s mother Margharita had worked as an assistant to Ronald Cartland, Barbara Cartland&#x27;s brother, who was Member of Parliament for Kings Norton. In the 1950s, 198 West Heath Road became the home of the local medical general practitioner, Dr. Anthony Bobak, but despite the significance of the building, the house was demolished in 2007 and replaced by a block of apartments.

<doc id="845078" wikidata="Q917055" url="?curid=845078" title="The Unbearable Lightness of Being">
<text>The Unbearable Lightness of Being () is a 1984 novel by Milan Kundera, about two women, two men, a dog, and their lives in the 1968 Prague Spring period of Czechoslovak history. Although written in 1982, the novel was not published until two years later, in a French translation (as &quot;L&#x27;insoutenable légèreté de l&#x27;être&quot;). The same year, it was translated to English from Czech by Michael Henry Heim and excerpts of it were published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. The original Czech text was published the following year.

==Premise==
&quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot; takes place mainly in Prague in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It explores the artistic and intellectual life of Czech society from the Prague Spring of 1968 to the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union and three other Warsaw Pact countries and its aftermath through the lives of two separate pairs of people and those around them.

==Characters==
*Tomáš: A Czech surgeon and intellectual. Tomáš is a womanizer who lives for his work. He considers sex and love to be distinct entities: he has sex with many women but loves only his wife, Tereza. He sees no contradiction between these two positions. He explains womanizing as an imperative to explore female idiosyncrasies only expressed during sex. At first he views his wife as a burden whom he is obliged to take care of. After the Warsaw Pact invasion, they escape to Zürich, where he starts womanizing again. Tereza, homesick, returns to Prague with the dog. He quickly realizes he wants to be with her and follows her home. He has to deal with the consequences of a letter to the editor in which he metaphorically likened the Czech Communists to Oedipus. Eventually fed up with life in Prague under the Communist regime, Tomáš and Tereza move to the countryside. He abandons his twin obsessions of work and womanizing and discovers true happiness with Tereza. His epitaph, written by his Catholic son, is &quot;He Wanted the Kingdom of God on Earth&quot;.
*Tereza: Tomáš&#x27;s young wife. A waitress from a hotel restaurant in a small provincial town, became a photographer with the help of one of Tomáš&#x27;s lovers, she delves into dangerous and dissident photojournalism during the Soviet occupation of Prague. Tereza does not condemn Tomáš for his infidelities, instead characterizing herself as a weaker person. Tereza is mostly defined by her view of the body as disgusting and shameful, due to her mother&#x27;s embrace of the body&#x27;s grotesque functions. Throughout the book she fears simply being another body in Tomáš&#x27;s array of women. Once Tomáš and Tereza move to the countryside, she devotes herself to raising cattle and reading. During this time she learns about her anima through an adoration of pet animals, reaching the conclusion that they were the last link to the paradise abandoned by Adam and Eve and becomes alienated from other people.
*Sabina: Tomáš&#x27;s mistress and closest friend. Sabina lives her life as an extreme example of lightness, taking profound satisfaction in the act of betrayal. She declares war on kitsch and struggles against the constraints imposed upon her by her puritan ancestry and the Communist Party. This struggle is shown through her paintings. She occasionally expresses excitement at humiliation, as shown through the use of her grandfather&#x27;s bowler hat, a symbol that is born during one sexual encounter with Tomáš, before it eventually changes meaning and becomes a relic of the past. Later in the novel, she begins to correspond with Šimon while living under the roof of some older Americans who admire her artistic skill.
*Franz: Sabina&#x27;s lover and a Geneva professor and idealist. Franz falls in love with Sabina, whom he considers a liberal and romantically tragic Czech dissident. He is a kind and compassionate man. As one of the novel&#x27;s dreamers, Franz bases his actions on loyalty to the memories of his mother and Sabina. His life revolves completely around books and academia, eventually to the extent that he seeks lightness and ecstasy by participating in marches and protests, the last of which is a march in Thailand to the border with Cambodia. In Bangkok after the march, he is mortally wounded during a mugging.
*Karenin: The dog of Tomáš and Tereza. Although she is a female dog, the name is masculine and is a reference to Alexei Karenin, the husband in &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;. Karenin displays extreme dislike of change. Once moved to the countryside, Karenin becomes more content as she is able to enjoy more attention from her companions. She also quickly befriends a pig named Mefisto. During this time Tomáš discovers that Karenin has cancer and even after removing a tumor it is clear that Karenin is going to die. On her deathbed she unites Tereza and Tomáš through her &quot;smile&quot; at their attempts to improve her health.
*Šimon: Tomáš&#x27;s estranged son from an earlier marriage.

==Philosophical underpinnings==
Challenging the concept of eternal recurrence (the idea that the universe and its events have already occurred and will recur &quot;ad infinitum&quot;), the story&#x27;s thematic meditations posit the alternative: that each person has only one life to live and that which occurs in life occurs only once and never again – thus the &quot;lightness&quot; of being. Moreover, this lightness also signifies freedom; Tomáš and Sabina display this lightness, whereas Tereza&#x27;s character is &quot;weighed down&quot;. In Constance Garnett&#x27;s translation of Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot; she gives us the phrase &quot;strange lightness of being&quot; during the description of Prince Andrey&#x27;s death. In contrast, the concept of eternal recurrence imposes a &quot;heaviness&quot; on life and the decisions that are made. Nietzsche believed this heaviness could be either a tremendous burden or great benefit depending on the individual&#x27;s perspective.

Quoting Kundera from the book:

The heavier the burden, the closer our lives come to the earth, the more real and truthful they become. Conversely, the absolute absence of burden causes man to be lighter than air, to soar into heights, take leave of the earth and his earthly being, and become only half real, his movements as free as they are insignificant. What then shall we choose? Weight or lightness? ... When we want to give expression to a dramatic situation in our lives, we tend to use metaphors of heaviness. We say that something has become a great burden to us. We either bear the burden or fail and go down with it, we struggle with it, win or lose. And Sabina – what had come over her? Nothing. She had left a man because she felt like leaving him. Had he persecuted her? Had he tried to take revenge on her? No. Her drama was a drama not of heaviness but of lightness. What fell to her lot was not the burden, but the unbearable lightness of being.

In the novel, Nietzsche&#x27;s concept is attached to an interpretation of the German adage &#x27;one occurrence is not significant&#x27;; namely, an &quot;all-or-nothing&quot; cognitive distortion that Tomáš must overcome in his hero&#x27;s journey. He initially believes &quot;If we only have one life to live, we might as well not have lived at all,&quot; and specifically (with respect to committing to Tereza) &quot;There is no means of testing which decision is better, because there is no basis for comparison.&quot; The novel resolves this question decisively that such a commitment is in fact possible and desirable.

==Publication==
&quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot; (1984) was not published in the original Czech until 1985 by the exile publishing house 68 Publishers (Toronto, Ontario). The second Czech edition was published in October 2006, in Brno, Czech Republic, some 18 years after the Velvet Revolution, because Kundera did not approve it earlier. The first English translation by Michael Henry Heim was published in hardback in 1984 by Harper &amp; Row in the U.S. and Faber and Faber in the UK and in paperback in 1985.

==Film==
In 1988, an American-made film adaptation of the novel was released starring Daniel Day-Lewis, Lena Olin and Juliette Binoche and directed by Philip Kaufman. In a note to the Czech edition of the book, Kundera remarks that the movie had very little to do with the spirit either of the novel or the characters in it. In the same note, Kundera goes on to say that after this experience he no longer allows any adaptations of his work.

<text>The Texas School Book Depository, now known as the Dallas County Administration Building, is a seven-floor building facing Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas. The building was Lee Harvey Oswald&#x27;s during the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. The Warren Commission concluded that Oswald, an employee at the depository, shot and mortally wounded President Kennedy from a sixth floor window on the building&#x27;s southeastern corner. Kennedy was pronounced dead at Parkland Memorial Hospital.

The building, located at 411 Elm Street on the northwest corner of Elm and North Houston Streets in downtown Dallas, is a Texas Historic Landmark.

==Early history==
The site was originally owned by John Neely Bryan. In the 1880s, Maxime Guillot operated a wagon shop on the property. In 1894, the Rock Island Plow Company bought the land, and four years later constructed a five-story building for its Texas division, the Southern Rock Island Plow Company. In 1901, the building was hit by lightning and nearly burned to the ground. It was rebuilt in 1902 in the Commercial Romanesque Revival style and expanded to seven stories. In 1937, the Carraway Byrd Corporation purchased the property, but they defaulted on the loan. It was sold at public auction in July 1939 and purchased by D. Harold Byrd.

Under Byrd&#x27;s ownership, the building remained empty until 1940, when it was leased by grocery wholesaler John Sexton &amp; Co. Sexton Foods used this location as the branch office for sales, manufacturing, and distribution for the south and southwest United States. In November 1961, Sexton Foods moved to a modern distribution facility located at 650 Regal Row Dallas. By then, the building was known locally as the Sexton Building. The building was refurbished, and partitions, carpeting, air conditioning, and a new passenger elevator were added on the first four floors.

==Assassination of John F. Kennedy==
In 1963, the building was in use as a multi-floor warehouse storing school textbooks and other related materials, and an order-fulfillment center by the privately owned Texas School Book Depository Company, which had moved from the first floor of the adjacent Dal-Tex Building. The company found that the upper floors had sustained oil damage from items stored there by the previous tenant, so they began to cover the floors with plywood to protect their books, stored in cardboard boxes, from the oil.

Work had begun on the west side of the sixth floor just before President Kennedy&#x27;s motorcade, &quot;leaving the whole scene in disarray, with stock shifted as far as the east wall, and stacks in between piled unusually high.&quot; Lee Harvey Oswald was working as a temporary employee at the building. He fired three shots from a sixth floor window at the presidential motorcade on November 22, 1963. At this time, the building had three elevators.

===Second building===
The Texas School Book Depository Company maintained a second warehouse at 1917 Houston, several blocks north of the main building. The short four-story structure was well removed from the parade route, half-hidden on an unpaved section of Houston. Oswald&#x27;s supervisor Roy Truly told the Warren Commission that he had the option to assign Oswald to either building on his first day at work. &quot;Oswald and another fellow reported for work on the same day [October 15] and I needed one of them for the depository building. I picked Oswald.&quot; This second building was eventually destroyed to make way for the Woodall Rodgers Freeway.

According to William Manchester in his book &quot;The Death of a President&quot;, this warehouse prior to November 22 was &quot;the better known&quot; of the two warehouses.

==Later years==
The mayor of Dallas, Wes Wise, saved the Texas School Book Depository from imminent destruction, preserving it for further research into the president&#x27;s murder.

The Texas School Book Depository Company moved out in 1970. The building was sold at auction to Aubrey Mayhew, a Nashville, Tennessee music producer and collector of Kennedy memorabilia, by the owner D. H. Byrd. In 1972, ownership reverted to Byrd. In 1977, the building was purchased by the government of Dallas County. After renovating the lower five floors of the building for use as county government offices, the Dallas County Administration Building was dedicated in March 1981.

On President&#x27;s Day 1989, the sixth floor opened to the public, for an admission charge, as the Sixth Floor Museum of assassination-related exhibits. On President&#x27;s Day 2002, the seventh-floor gallery opened. The gallery opened in February 2002 with the exhibit: &quot;The Pulitzer Prize Photographs: Capture the Moment&quot;. A $2.5 million renovation turned the storage area on the seventh floor into a new gallery space for the museum. Other exhibits that have hung in the space include works of Andy Warhol.

In May 2010, burglars attempted to steal a safe from the Sixth Floor Museum, but fled when &quot;they were confronted by a security guard,&quot; leaving the unopened safe suspended from a winch on the back of a truck.

<text>The Fremont Bridge is a double-leaf bascule bridge that spans the Fremont Cut in Seattle, Washington. The bridge, which connects Fremont Avenue North and 4th Avenue North, connects the neighborhoods of Fremont and Queen Anne.

The Fremont Bridge was opened on Friday June 15, 1917, at a cost of $410,000. The first traffic over the bridge was to &quot;owl cars&quot;, the last run of the trolleys, and then after 5am the same day to all other traffic. The Lake Washington Ship Canal was dedicated on July 4, 1917, which has caused confusion about the opening date, for this bridge crosses the canal.

The Fremont Bridge is the first of four city bascules to cross the canal, the others being Ballard Bridge (1917), University Bridge (1919), and Montlake Bridge (1925). The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, and is also a designated city landmark, ID #110347.In its early years, before the construction of the nearby Aurora Bridge in 1932, the Fremont Bridge had the most vehicle traffic of any bascule bridge in the United States. In another respect, it remains among the busiest even today: due to its low vessel clearance of , the Fremont Bridge opens an average of 35 times a day, which makes it the most frequently opened drawbridge in the United States and one of the busiest bascule bridges in the world. Federal law gives marine traffic the right-of-way over vehicular traffic; however, the Fremont Bridge is closed to most water traffic during rush hours.

The Fremont Bridge was originally painted a dull green. In 1972, the Fremont Improvement Committee picked a new color, Fremont Orange, and residents approved the change. The bridge&#x27;s blue and orange color was chosen by voters at a 1985 street fair.

In 2006, the Fremont Bridge underwent a $41.9 million restoration project to replace the approaches and maintenance shop, as well as renovation of the mechanical and electrical systems that operate the bascule. The approaches were completed in May 2007 and testing lasted through the Spring of 2008. In 2014 the city began repainting the bridge.

The bridge received a permanent art installation in February 2018 as part of an artist residency program coinciding with the centennial of the bridge and two of the ship canal&#x27;s other bascule bridges. The Fremont Bridge was outfitted with what is to be the first of three dynamic lighting designs. The Ballard Bridge and University Bridge will also receive installations assuming funding can be secured.

A bicycle counter was installed in 2012. It was the first of twelve counters in the city, as of 2018. Bike traffic reached 1.12 million rides in 2019, a 13% increase from the year before.

==Earlier bridges==
The present bridge is actually the third bridge at this location. A low trestle bridge was built in 1890 or 1891. In 1911, in anticipation of the construction of the Ship Canal, it was replaced by a higher trestle bridge. While that bridge was always intended as temporary, it proved even more so than planned, because early in the afternoon of March 12, 1914, the Fremont dam, which controlled the level of Lake Union, gave way. Over the course of a day, the lake level lowered by nine feet, stranding vessels and floating homes, and rupturing the central portion of the second Fremont bridge. The Stone Avenue Bridge, which included a streetcar trestle from Westlake Avenue to Stone Way, remained intact. Streetcar traffic that had used the Fremont Bridge was rerouted over that trestle until the completion of the present-day bridge.
