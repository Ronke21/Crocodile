<text>Rockwell Collins, Inc. was a multinational corporation headquartered in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, providing avionics and information technology systems and services to government agencies and aircraft manufacturers. It was formed when the Collins Radio Company, facing financial difficulties, was purchased by Rockwell International in 1973. In 2001, the avionics division of Rockwell International was spun off to form the current Rockwell Collins, Inc., retaining its name.

It was acquired by United Technologies Corporation on November 27, 2018, and since then operates as part of Collins Aerospace, a subsidiary of the RTX Corporation (formerly Raytheon Technologies).

== History ==
Arthur A. Collins founded Collins Radio Company in 1933 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. It designed and produced both shortwave radio equipment and equipment for the AM radio broadcast industry. Collins supplied the military, the scientific community, and the larger AM radio stations with equipment. Collins provided the equipment to establish a communications link with the South Pole expedition of Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd in 1933.

In 1936, Collins had begun production of the 12H audio console, 12X portable field announcers box, and the 300E and 300F broadcast transmitters. Throughout World War II, the 212A1 and 212B1 replaced the 12H design. Collins became the principal supplier of radio and navigation equipment used in the military.

In the postwar years, the Collins Radio Company expanded its work in the communications field, while broadening its technology into flight-control instruments, radio-communication devices, and satellite voice transmissions. Collins Radio Company provided communications for the United States&#x27; role in the Space Race, including equipment for astronauts to communicate with earth stations and equipment to track and communicate with spacecraft. Collins communications equipment was used for Projects Mercury, Gemini and Apollo. 

In 1973, the U.S. Skylab program used Collins equipment to provide communication from the astronauts to earth.

=== Rockwell Collins ===

After facing financial difficulties, the Collins Radio Company was purchased by Rockwell International in 1973. In 2001, the avionics division of Rockwell International was spun off to form Rockwell Collins, Inc, retaining its name. Rockwell Collins was highly concentrated in the defense and commercial avionics markets, and no longer marketed receivers to the public.

On April 28, 2000, Rockwell International Corp and its Rockwell Collins unit agreed to acquire Sony Corp&#x27;s Sony Trans Com (Irvine, California) for undisclosed terms. Sony had purchased the business from Sundstrand Corporation in 1989. On December 20, 2000, Rockwell Collins expanded its services to commercial and executive aviation in Mercosur countries.

The company had acquired several companies, including Hughes-Avicom&#x27;s in-flight entertainment business (1998), Sony Trans Com (2000), Intertrade Ltd., Flight Dynamics, K Systems, Inc. (Kaiser companies), Communication Solutions, Inc., Airshow, Inc. (2002), NLX (Simulation Business) in 2003, portions of Evans &amp; Sutherland, TELDIX GmbH, IP Unwired, Anzus Inc. in 2006, Information Technology and Applications Corp in 2007, Athena Technologies, Datapath Inc. (divested in 2014), SEOS Displays Ltd., Air Routing International in 2010, Computing Technologies for Aviation (CTA) in 2011, ARINC in 2014, and BE Aerospace in 2017.

The company was among the major suppliers of in-flight entertainment (IFE). Rockwell Collins&#x27; key competitors in this industry included Panasonic Avionics Corporation, Thales Group, and JetBlue&#x27;s IFE subsidiary LiveTV, which was later purchased by Thales in 2014 for $400 million.

In 2010, the company employed over 20,000 people and had an annual turnover of US$4.665 billion. Its nonexecutive chairman was Anthony Carbone following the retirement of Clayton M. Jones.
In September 2012, Kelly Ortberg was appointed as president of the company. In August 2013, Kelly Ortberg was appointed CEO of Rockwell Collins.

====Acquisition by United Technologies====
On September 4, 2017, United Technologies of Farmington, Connecticut, agreed to acquire the company for $30 billion. The transaction closed on November 26, 2018.

== Past products ==

=== Broadcast transmitters ===

Starting in the mid-1930s, the Collins Radio Company constructed and sold transmitters and audio mixing consoles to the broadcast industry.

In 1939, the model 12 Speech Input Console, in addition to the 26C limiter amplifier, was licensed to Canadian Marconi Co. for both sales in Canada and His Majesty&#x27;s Service for the war effort. Collins&#x27; success in constructing broadcast transmitters continued to grow, selling well over a thousand up to the start of World War II. During World War II, Collins&#x27; expertise grew in high-power transmitters, producing designs that ran well over 15 kilowatts (kW) of RF power on a continuous basis. After the war, some AM transmitters were produced, called the 300G, and remain the finest in low-power AM transmitters (300W) ever produced.

Collins remained an important manufacturer of AM and FM broadcast radio transmitters for the commercial market surviving the drastic cost-cutting market of the 1960s and 1970s. The transmitter line was later sold to Continental Electronics, which continued to produce a number of Collins designs under its own nameplate before phasing them out in the 1980s.

=== Shortwave transmitters ===
Collins produced several shortwave transmitters to the commercial market. A &quot;30&quot; Series production catered to the growing need of state highway patrol agencies and Department of Commerce aviation needs. During World War II, Collins produced high-power transmitters for aircraft, notably the ART-13 equipped with automatic tuning circuits, which represented an important enhancement for airborne radio communications.

After World War II, Collins supported both broadcast and the growing postwar amateur radio market. The United States Coast Guard Cutter USCGC &quot;Courier&quot; was employed as seagoing relay station for Voice of America programming using two Collins 207B-1 transmitters.
Amateur radio transmitters included the 32V-1, -2, and -3, the KWS-1, and the rack-mounted KW-1.

=== Receivers ===

Around 1947, the company introduced their first amateur radio receiver, the 75A-1 (called the 75A). This set achieved excellent stability for the time due to high build quality and the use of a permeability tuned oscillator in its second conversion stage. It was one of the few double-conversion superheterodynes on the market, and covered only the amateur bands.

With the experience gained in the design of the 75A-1, Collins released the 51J-1 receiver, a general-coverage HF set covering to. It was produced in somewhat updated versions (51J-2, 51J-3, 51J-4) for about a decade. It was known as the R-388 and was used in multiple receiver diversity radioteletype installations.

The 75A amateur line was updated throughout the early , finishing with the 75A-4, which was released in 1955. The Collins mechanical filter was introduced to consumers in the 75A-3, and the 75A-4 was one of the first receivers marketed specifically as a single sideband receiver. 

Around 1950, Collins began designing the R-390 () for the US military. This was intended to be a receiver of the highest performance available, with the ruggedness and serviceability required for military duty. It featured direct mechanical digital frequency readout. The set is composed of several modules for easy field repair—a bad module could simply be swapped out and repaired later, or junked. Sets built during the original 1951 contract cost the government about () each, and around 16,000 were produced.

Concurrently, Collins developed the R-389, a long-wave version with fewer than 1,000 made. The R-391, another variant of the R-390, allowed choice of eight different autotuned channels.

Three years later, Collins delivered the R-390A to the military. About 54,000 were produced and the set was a military workhorse until the . Like the R-390, it can outperform many modern radios, to the point that it was designated top secret until the late .

In 1958, Collins replaced the 75A series with the much smaller 75S series, part of the S/Line. These featured mechanical filters, very accurate frequency readout, and excellent stability. At the request of the US government, Collins designed the 51S-1 general-coverage set, which was essentially (in intended use) a physically smaller replacement for the 51J series. It was not intended as a replacement for the higher-performance R-390A, and unlike the R-390A, it was extensively marketed for commercial use.

Collins produced a few high-performance solid-state receivers in the , such as the 651S-1. Like their tube predecessors, these are coveted by collectors today.

=== Transceivers and systems ===

With the introduction of the S/Line in 1958, Collins moved from designing individual products that could be used together, to ones that were designed to integrate and operate together, in various combinations, as a system. They were the first equipment maker to take this approach. Collins was also the first to introduce a compact HF transceiver, the KWM-1, the year before. Together, these two innovations put Collins temporarily ahead of its competition, and set the stage for other manufacturers and the next generation of amateur (and military) HF radio equipment.

The 75S-1 receiver and 32S-1 transmitter, comprising the heart of the S/Line, operated separately or together to transceive. The units included crystal band-pass filters and a new compact design that provided stable, highly linear tuning across 200 kHz band segments. The S/Line tuning-dial mechanism was unique when introduced. It used concentric dials and a gear mechanism that provided precise dial resolution, better than 1 kHz.
Within a few years, Collins had introduced additional S/Line components, including the 30S-1 kilowatt power amplifier, the 30L-1 desktop power amplifier, and the 62S-1 transverter, which provided coverage of the 6-m (50 MHz) and 2-m (144 MHz) amateur bands. The KWM-2 transceiver replaced the KWM-1 using many of the S/Line&#x27;s design features and matching its styling. Other accessories included speakers, microphones, and control consoles.

Illustrating the uniqueness of their new, smaller units in the market, Collins advertisements in the 1950s and early 1960s emphasized the S/Line&#x27;s physical styling and size, as often as they did its performance.

Collins continued to improve the S/Line, first introducing the S-2, then the S-3 units, the 75S-3 (and -3A, -3B and -3C) receiver, and the 32S-3 and -3A transmitters. The -3A and -3C units were identical to the -3 and -3B units, respectively, except they provided an extra set of heterodyne oscillator crystals, enabling them to cover extra bands – useful for military, amateur and MARS operation, where operation just outside the regular amateur bands was necessary.
Among amateur radio operators, the S/Line established its reputation as perhaps the most solidly engineered equipment available, and the most costly. As a result, S/Line equipment, and the A-Line and other predecessors, are restored, prized, and operated on the air by collectors today.

Collins continued to produce the S/Line well into the late 1970s, and after its acquisition by Rockwell.

In 1978, with the move to solid-state design, the S/Line came to an end after a two-decade production run. The KWM-380 transceiver was introduced the next year, a break with the past both in its use of transistors and digital technology, and its styling. It was Collins&#x27; final entry in the amateur radio market until it was discontinued in the mid-1980s.

=== Computers ===

In the 1960s, the company designed and sold C-System computerized message-switching equipment, built an intranet, and began implementing computer storage of design data for circuit boards and assemblies. They had a goal of automating all functions from parts ordering and inventory to factory scheduling to generation of maintenance provisioning. With products technically successful and far ahead of their time in many respects, Mr. Collins continued to invest in development at a rate that could not be supported by sales when a downturn occurred, and began to have financial problems.

=== Network Transmission Systems ===

In 1991, Rockwell sold its Richardson, Texas-based Network Transmission Systems division to Alcatel.

== Acquisitions ==

In 2008, Rockwell Collins acquired Athena Technologies for million (equivalent to $million in ).

===ARINC Acquisition===
In August 2013, Rockwell Collins announced the agreement to purchase ARINC. On December 23, 2013, Rockwell Collins announced it had completed its acquisition of ARINC for billion (equivalent to $billion in ). The purchase of ARINC allowed Rockwell Collins to shift their balance in commercial aviation.

=== B/E Aerospace Acquisition ===
In April 2017, Rockwell Collins entered the aircraft cabin interiors market through the acquisition of B/E Aerospace for billion (equivalent to $billion in ). Based in Wellington, Florida, B/E products included seating, food and beverage preparation and storage equipment, lighting and oxygen systems, and modular galley and lavatory systems for commercial airliners and business jets. B/E benefits from rival Zodiac Aerospace&#x27;s delivery troubles. Retrofit opportunities are provided by its $12 billion installed base. B/E shareholders received 20% of the new Rockwell, which then had $8.1 billion in revenues and $1.9 billion in pretax earnings with nearly 30,000 employees.

Rockwell Collins filed for regulatory approval for its intended acquisition of B/E Aerospace, before the Philippine Competition Commission, since the latter has a branch in the Philippines operating a manufacturing plant in Tanauan, Batangas.

As a result of the acquisition, a newly created direct or indirect subsidiary of Rockwell, Quarterback Merger Sub Corp., merged with and into B/E Aerospace, with the latter surviving the merger as a direct or indirect subsidiary of Rockwell Collins.

== Organizational structure ==
Rockwell Collins has five main divisions:
* Commercial Systems (CS)
* Government Systems (GS)
* International and Service Solutions (I&amp;SS)
* Information Management Services (IMS)
* Interior Systems (IS)

The CS division services the commercial airline industry and business aircraft, providing navigation, communication, synthetic vision, other cockpit products such as autoland autopilots, and cabin products such as in-flight entertainment. The GS division services primarily the US government and military, but also provides some products and services to foreign governments with close ties to the United States. Notable government-related projects that Rockwell Collins has involvement with are Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS), Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT), Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR), and Future Combat Systems. The I&amp;SS division is an amalgamation of International Business organization, whose responsibility is sales, engineering, and human resources of personnel outside of North America, and Service Solutions, which provides support services such as customer support, simulation and training, and technical publications. I&amp;SS provides a common service to both CS and GS divisions, and its formation was announced on the Rockwell Collins press release web page on February 19, 2010.

== Donald R. Beall Advanced Technology Center ==
The Donald R. Beall Advanced Technology Center is a research and development center within Rockwell Collins that focuses on creating, identifying, and maturing technologies targeted at driving business growth. It maintains a portfolio that balances short-term deliverables focused on core and adjacent markets, with technologies for long-term growth. It has three departments: Advanced Radio Systems, Communications and Navigation Systems, and Embedded Information Systems.

==Collector community==
As with several other brands of vintage radio equipment, an active community of Collins radio enthusiasts existed, with clubs, web sites, and on-line discussions dedicated to restoring and operating the equipment. The Collins Collectors Association and the Collins Radio Association were two examples of such organizations.

Groups of Collins users have also organized meetings, gatherings at hamfests, and regularly scheduled on-air discussions called nets.
==Tax avoidance==

In December 2019, CNBC listed Rockwell Collins along with 91 additional &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 companies that &quot;paid an effective federal tax rate of 0% or less&quot; as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

<text>The Groundhog Day gale was a severe winter storm that hit the Northeastern United States and southeastern Canada on February 2 (Groundhog Day), 1976.

==Meteorologist synopsis==
An upper-level low was stationary across the Desert Southwest of the United States, on January 28. A system in the northern branch of the Westerlies known as a Saskatchewan Screamer, similar to an Alberta clipper but originating as a frontal wave in the next Canadian province to the east, moved east-southeast across Canada beginning on January 30, luring the system in the United States eastward. The cyclones merged by February 2, becoming a significant storm over New England before lifting northward through Quebec into the Davis Strait. At this time, maximum sustained winds reached 164 kilometers per hour (102 mph) in coastal areas (equal to a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale), with wind gusts of up to 188 kilometers per hour (116 mph). By February 6, this extratropical cyclone was absorbed by another system in the northern Canadian archipelago.

==Effects in the United States==

===Maine===
Caribou, Maine, recorded one of its lowest pressures on record, with much of New England recording its lowest values for the month of February, with a reading of . Winds gusted to 60 knots (69 mph) in Rockland and 100 knots (115 mph) at Southwest Harbor. Blizzard conditions were experienced for a few hours as the cyclone moved up into Canada. The storm caused extensive damage in many areas. Although many trees were blown down by the storm, many more were killed after large amounts of seawater were blown inland. Coastal flooding was seen from Brunswick to Eastport. A tidal surge went up the Penobscot River, flooding Bangor, Maine, for three hours around midday. At 11:15 am, waters began rising on the river and within 15 minutes had risen a total of flooding downtown. About 200 cars were submerged and office workers were stranded until waters receded. There were no reported deaths during this unusual flash flood.

===Massachusetts===
Boston, Massachusetts, set their lowest February pressure on record, with a reading of .

===New York===
Cyclonic flow and cold air around the backside of this system led to significant Lake effect snows for areas downwind of the Great Lakes.

===Vermont===
Burlington set a daily snow record on February 2 when 6.5 inches fell.

==Canada effects==
Significant damage occurred in southern New Brunswick, especially to the city of Saint John. Saint John experienced winds of 188 km/h (116 mph). Southwest Nova Scotia and southern New Brunswick experienced coastal flooding of up to deep causing extensive damage to wharves, coastal buildings, boats and vessels. Power and communications lines were also knocked out. The tides along the coast were increased due to the convergence of anomalistic, synodical, and tropical monthly tidal cycles peaking simultaneously (known as Saros); a once in 18-year event. Damage was estimated in the tens of millions of dollars. Offshore New Brunswick, 12-m (39 ft) waves with swells of were reported in the high seas. The decommissioned Grand Harbour Lighthouse at Fish Fluke Point on Grand Manan sustained extensive damage. The aftermath of this storm was worsened by a severe cold snap that followed the day after.

<text>Penfold Park () is a public park managed by the Hong Kong Jockey Club in Sha Tin, Hong Kong. It is named after Major-General Bernard Penfold, the first general manager of the Jockey Club who was in office from 1972 to 1979.

The park is located in the centre (within the track) of the Sha Tin Racecourse with a gross area of over 20 acres. It features green areas, as well as pools used by various waterbirds. People around the area often go there to have a walk. There are many painted horse statues and artworks. It is closed during horse racing days and Mondays.

==History==
The park was briefly called Infield Park at opening on 11 May 1979. The chairman of the Jockey Club Board of Stewards, during the Stewards&#x27; annual general meeting on 17 September that year, announced that the park would be named in honour of Major-General Bernard Penfold. The chairman explained that the Stewards &quot;considered the beautifying of the in-field with shrubs and trees to be a characteristic example of General Penfold&#x27;s many achievements&quot;. General Penfold, the manager of the Jockey Club who presided over construction of the park, was slated to retire the following year after seven seasons as general manager.

During the years after SARS, there were a few slight bouts of bird flu, and the man-made lakes had been closed a few times to reduce the chance of visitors contracting the diseases. The Hong Kong Jockey Club had announced that Penfold Park would be closed from the end of July 2007 to April 2008 for the construction of training facilities for the 2008 Olympic equestrian events. On 17 January 2009, the park was reopened for the public.

==Features==
==Opening hours==
On 22 September 2015, The Hong Kong Jockey Club announced that Penfold Park would be open year-round and with extended opening hours.

<text>Sir Samuel Garth FRS (1661 – 18 January 1719) was an English physician and poet.

==Life==
Garth was born in Bolam in County Durham and matriculated at Peterhouse, Cambridge in 1676, graduating B.A. in 1679 and M.A. in 1684. He took his M.D. and became a member of the College of Physicians in 1691. He settled as a physician in London and soon acquired a large practice. He was a zealous Whig, the friend of Addison and, though of different political views, of Pope. He ended his career as physician to George I, who knighted him in 1714. The politician John Garth was a nephew of Samuel Garth.

In 1699 Samuel Garth was called to give evidence in what became known as the Sarah Stout Affair. Spencer Cowper, a lawyer and member of a prominent Hertfordshire family, was accused with some friends of the murder of a Quaker woman called Sarah Stout. The prosecution asserted that because the body was floating when found, that it must have been put in the water after death. Opinions were given at the trial by Samuel Garth and Hans Sloane. It appears that aside from the fact that the body was floating when found, there was no other evidence to support the charge. The defendants were acquitted, but the case remains interesting as an early example of attempts to use &#x27;expert testimony&#x27; and forensic science evidence in a trial.

He was notably sharp-tongued: &quot;God help the country where St Leger is made a judge&quot;! he exclaimed in 1714, on hearing that Sir John St Leger, an Irish Whig barrister, had been appointed a High Court judge in Ireland.

For a while, he owned the manor of Edgcott in Buckinghamshire. He died on 18 January 1719.

==Works==
In 1697 he delivered the Harveian Oration, in which he advocated a scheme dating from some ten years back for providing dispensaries for the relief of the sick poor, as a protection against the greed of the apothecaries. In 1699 he published a mock-heroic poem, &quot;The Dispensary&quot;, in six cantos, which had an instant success, passing through three editions within a year. In this, he ridiculed the apothecaries and their allies among the physicians.

Garth’s work is a satirical take on the traditional epic poem, and is perhaps one of the better examples of the “medical poetry” genre.

Long has he been of that amphibious fry,
Bold to prescribe, and busy to apply;
His shop the gazing vulgar&#x27;s eyes employs,
With foreign trinkets and domestic toys.
Here mummies lay, most reverently stale,
And there the tortoise hung her coat of mail;
Not far from some huge shark&#x27;s devouring head
The flying-fish their finny pinions spread.
Aloft in rows large poppy-heads were strung,
And near, a scaly alligator hung.
In this place drugs in musty heaps decay&#x27;d,
In that dried bladders and false teeth were laid.

An inner room receives the num&#x27;rous shoals
Of such as pay to be reputed fools;
Globes stand by globes, volumes on volumes lie,
And planetary schemes amuse the eye.
The sage in velvet chair here lolls at ease,
To promise future health for present fees;
Then, as from tripod, solemn shams reveals,
And what the stars know nothing of foretells.
Our manufactures now they merely sell,
And their true value treacherously tell;
Nay, they discover, too, their spite is such,
That health, than crowns more valued, cost not much;
Whilst we must steer our conduct by these rules,
To cheat as tradesmen, or to starve as fools.
He is also remembered as the author of &quot;Claremont&quot;, a descriptive poem. He translated the &quot;Life of Otho&quot; in the fifth volume of Dryden&#x27;s Plutarch, and also edited a translation of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, to which Addison, Pope, and others contributed. His intervention ensured an honourable burial for John Dryden and he pronounced a eulogy at the funeral in Westminster Abbey.

In 1704 he wrote the prologue for the play &quot;Squire Trelooby&quot; which his fellow Kit-Cat Club members Congreve, Vanbrugh and William Walsh had created.

It was originally called &quot;Fuarán Mór&quot;, meaning &quot;great spring&quot; in Irish. This name reputedly refers to a spring or well near the village.

== History ==

=== Pre-history ===

Evidence of prehistoric settlement in the Oranmore Parish area include a number of fulacht fiadh (at Frenchfort townland), ringforts (Rinn townland) and a megalithic structure (at Garraun South townland). Griffith&#x27;s Valuation, a land survey completed in 1857, shows several such structures (sometimes colloquially and collectively known as fairy forts) in the area.

=== Medieval church ruins ===
The ruin of a medieval Roman Catholic church is one of the oldest buildings in Oranmore town. Its northern wall forms part of the enclosure which encompasses the church and its graveyard. The church is believed to date to the 13th century. If true, this means it was built no later than one and half century&#x27;s after the initial Anglo-Norman Invasion of 1169 AD.

The existing remains measure approximately 32 feet by 72 feet, however, there is evidence that the church was larger at one time. Some grave markers in the adjoining cemetery have no discernible name or date. Other graves have been marked with pieces of the fallen church walls. The oldest grave stone, with a discernible date inscription, is a Celtic cross dated 1661. It is no longer in its original location, but is instead lying on top of another, newer stone slab.

There is a gated section within the graveyard set aside for the Presentation Sisters, an order of teaching sisters who established a convent in Oranmore in 1861. Some interments occurred within the ruined walls of the actual church.

=== Oranmore Castle ===

Oranmore Castle is a tower house which was originally associated with the Norman Clanricarde family. It was built around the 15th century, reputedly on the site of an earlier structure.

=== St Mary&#x27;s church ===

Completed in 1803, St Mary&#x27;s is a large church building with a bell-cote above the front door and an elaborate ceiling. In 1972, it was replaced as the local parish church with the newer, larger Church of the Immaculate Conception. St Mary&#x27;s was deconsecrated and converted to become the town&#x27;s public library. Its carved baptismal font was moved to the new church, but the graveyard was left intact.

==Economy==
The focus of industry has shifted from dairy agriculture to tourism, manufacturing and logistics. Oranmore has four hotels and 23 restaurants.

==Transport==
Oranmore town is near the old N6 Galway to Dublin road and the old N18 from Galway to Limerick. The M6 Motorway connects to the existing road at Doughiska, as well as connecting with the M18 at Glenascaul. The former N6 leading into Oranmore has been reclassified as the R338 regional road. The M18 motorway was officially opened on 27 September 2017 and connects to the M6 at Rathmorrissey at a three-level interchange. This road runs close to Oranmore but does not connect directly to it, and instead, motorists have to access it using the R381 at Kiltiernan or the M6 at Rathmorrissey.

Bus Éireann, Citylink, and Nestor Bus services through Oranmore serve Galway, Dublin, Cork, and Dublin and Shannon Airports. Also, Local Link buses serve other local places.

Oranmore Aerodrome was a Royal Air Force base in World War I. It later became a civil airfield serving the city of Galway.

===Rail===
Oranmore railway station opened on 1 August 1851, closed on 17 June 1963. A new station was built 1.4 km west of the original station and was opened on 28 July 2013. Trains connect directly with Galway, Athenry, Athlone, Portarlington, Kildare and Dublin Heuston, as well as on the Western Rail Corridor to Ennis and Limerick.

==Education==
Oranmore has two primary schools, Scoil Iosa and Gaelscoil de hÍde. Calasanctius College, founded in 1861 by the Presentation Sisters, is the secondary school in Oranmore.

==Sport==
Oranmore-Maree GAA is the local GAA club, and has won a number county titles across several age groups, including a Galway Senior Hurling Championship title in 1933 and All-Ireland Intermediate Club Hurling Championship title in 2019. The club fields teams in Gaelic football, hurling and camogie. Naomh Mhuire Ladies Football Club (Oranmore Maree) fields ladies&#x27; Gaelic football teams from under-10 to minor and junior.

Maree/Oranmore Soccer Club was founded in 1989. The club reached the Connacht Cup Final in 2024 and finished in the top 3 of the Galway FA Men&#x27;s Premier Division in 2023. The club also won four Galway FA U21 Premier League titles between 2021 and 2024.

Galway Bay Golf Resort is located in Renvile, Oranmore, and has been named best golf resort in Connacht 10 times. Other clubs in the area include the Oranmore Badminton Club, Maree Badminton Club, Maree Basketball Club, Oranmore Judo Club and Galway Bay Sailing Club. The latter is based in Renville, Oranmore. Junior &quot;Park Run&quot; events are run on Sunday mornings.

<doc id="867041" wikidata="Q2982669" url="?curid=867041" title="Tropical geometry">
<text>In mathematics, tropical geometry is the study of polynomials and their geometric properties when addition is replaced with minimization and multiplication is replaced with ordinary addition:

: formula_1,
: formula_2.

So for example, the classical polynomial formula_3 would become formula_4. Such polynomials and their solutions have important applications in optimization problems, for example the problem of optimizing departure times for a network of trains.

Tropical geometry is a variant of algebraic geometry in which polynomial graphs resemble piecewise linear meshes, and in which numbers belong to the tropical semiring instead of a field. Because classical and tropical geometry are closely related, results and methods can be converted between them. Algebraic varieties can be mapped to a tropical counterpart and, since this process still retains some geometric information about the original variety, it can be used to help prove and generalize classical results from algebraic geometry, such as the Brill–Noether theorem or computing Gromov Witten invariants, using the tools of tropical geometry.
== History ==
The basic ideas of tropical analysis were developed independently using the same notation by mathematicians working in various fields. The central ideas of tropical geometry appeared in different forms in a number of earlier works. For example, Victor Pavlovich Maslov introduced a tropical version of the process of integration. He also noticed that the Legendre transformation and solutions of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation are linear operations in the tropical sense. However, only since the late 1990s has an effort been made to consolidate the basic definitions of the theory. This was motivated by its application to enumerative algebraic geometry, with ideas from Maxim Kontsevich and works by Grigory Mikhalkin among others.

The adjective &quot;tropical&quot; was coined by French mathematicians in honor of the Hungarian-born Brazilian computer scientist Imre Simon, who wrote on the field. Jean-Éric Pin attributes the coinage to Dominique Perrin, whereas Simon himself attributes the word to Christian Choffrut.

== Algebra background ==
Tropical geometry is based on the tropical semiring. This is defined in two ways, depending on max or min convention.

The &quot;min tropical semiring&quot; formula_5 is the semiring formula_6, with the operations:
: formula_1,
: formula_2.
The operations formula_9 and formula_10 are referred to as &quot;tropical addition&quot; and &quot;tropical multiplication&quot; respectively. The identity element for formula_9 is formula_12, and the identity element for formula_10 is 0.

Similarly, the &quot;max tropical semiring&quot; formula_5 is the semiring formula_15, with operations:

: formula_16,
: formula_2.

The identity element for formula_9 is formula_19, and the identity element for formula_10 is 0.

These semirings are isomorphic, under negation formula_21, and generally one of these is chosen and referred to simply as the &quot;tropical semiring&quot;. Conventions differ between authors and subfields: some use the &quot;min&quot; convention, some use the &quot;max&quot; convention.

The tropical semiring operations model how valuations behave under addition and multiplication in a valued field.

Some common valued fields encountered in tropical geometry (with min convention) are:

* formula_22 or formula_23 with the trivial valuation, formula_24 for all formula_25.
* formula_22 or its extensions with the p-adic valuation, formula_27 for &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; coprime to &quot;p&quot;.
* The field of Laurent series formula_28 (integer powers), or the field of (complex) Puiseux series formula_29, with valuation returning the smallest exponent of &quot;t&quot; appearing in the series.

== Tropical polynomials ==
A &quot;tropical polynomial&quot; is a function formula_30 that can be expressed as the tropical sum of a finite number of &quot;monomial terms&quot;. A monomial term is a tropical product (and/or quotient) of a constant and variables from formula_31. Thus a tropical polynomial &quot;F&quot; is the minimum of a finite collection of affine-linear functions in which the variables have integer coefficients, so it is concave, continuous, and piecewise linear.
:formula_32

Given a polynomial &quot;f&quot; in the Laurent polynomial ring formula_33 where &quot;K&quot; is a valued field, the &quot;tropicalization&quot; of &quot;f&quot;, denoted formula_34, is the tropical polynomial obtained from &quot;f&quot; by replacing multiplication and addition by their tropical counterparts and each constant in &quot;K&quot; by its valuation. That is, if 
:formula_35,
then
:formula_36.

The set of points where a tropical polynomial &quot;F&quot; is non-differentiable is called its associated &quot;tropical hypersurface&quot;, denoted formula_37 (in analogy to the vanishing set of a polynomial). Equivalently, formula_37 is the set of points where the minimum among the terms of &quot;F&quot; is achieved at least twice. When formula_39 for a Laurent polynomial &quot;f&quot;, this latter characterization of formula_37 reflects the fact that at any solution to formula_41, the minimum valuation of the terms of &quot;f&quot; must be achieved at least twice in order for them all to cancel.

== Tropical varieties ==
=== Definitions ===
For &quot;X&quot; an algebraic variety in the algebraic torus formula_42, the &quot;tropical variety&quot; of &quot;X&quot; or &quot;tropicalization&quot; of &quot;X&quot;, denoted formula_43, is a subset of formula_44 that can be defined in several ways. The equivalence of these definitions is referred to as the &quot;Fundamental Theorem of Tropical Geometry&quot;.

==== Intersection of tropical hypersurfaces ====
Let formula_45 be the ideal of Laurent polynomials that vanish on &quot;X&quot; in formula_33. Define
:formula_47
When &quot;X&quot; is a hypersurface, its vanishing ideal formula_45 is a principal ideal generated by a Laurent polynomial &quot;f&quot;, and the tropical variety formula_43 is precisely the tropical hypersurface formula_50.

Every tropical variety is the intersection of a finite number of tropical hypersurfaces. A finite set of polynomials formula_51 is called a &quot;tropical basis&quot; for &quot;X&quot; if formula_43 is the intersection of the tropical hypersurfaces of formula_53. In general, a generating set of formula_45 is not sufficient to form a tropical basis. The intersection of a finite number of a tropical hypersurfaces is called a &quot;tropical prevariety&quot; and in general is not a tropical variety.

==== Initial ideals ====
Choosing a vector formula_55 in formula_44 defines a map from the monomial terms of formula_33 to formula_58 by sending the term &quot;m&quot; to formula_59. For a Laurent polynomial formula_60, define the &quot;initial form&quot; of &quot;f&quot; to be the sum of the terms formula_61 of &quot;f&quot; for which formula_62 is minimal. For the ideal formula_45, define its &quot;initial ideal&quot; with respect to formula_55 to be
:formula_65.
Then define
:formula_66.
Since we are working in the Laurent ring, this is the same as the set of weight vectors for which formula_67 does not contain a monomial.

When &quot;K&quot; has trivial valuation, formula_67 is precisely the initial ideal of formula_45 with respect to the monomial order given by a weight vector formula_55. It follows that formula_43 is a subfan of the Gröbner fan of formula_45.

==== Image of the valuation map ====
Suppose that &quot;X&quot; is a variety over a field &quot;K&quot; with valuation &quot;v&quot; whose image is dense in formula_58 (for example a field of Puiseux series). By acting coordinate-wise, &quot;v&quot; defines a map from the algebraic torus formula_42 to formula_44. Then define
:formula_76,
where the overline indicates the closure in the Euclidean topology. If the valuation of &quot;K&quot; is not dense in formula_58, then the above definition can be adapted by extending scalars to larger field which does have a dense valuation.

This definition shows that formula_43 is the non-Archimedean amoeba over an algebraically closed non-Archimedean field &quot;K&quot;.

If &quot;X&quot; is a variety over formula_23, formula_43 can be considered as the limiting object of the amoeba formula_81 as the base &quot;t&quot; of the logarithm map goes to infinity.

==== Polyhedral complex ====
The following characterization describes tropical varieties intrinsically without reference to algebraic varieties and tropicalization. A set &quot;V&quot; in formula_44 is an irreducible tropical variety if it is the support of a weighted polyhedral complex of pure dimension &quot;d&quot; that satisfies the &quot;zero-tension condition&quot; and is connected in codimension one. When &quot;d&quot; is one, the zero-tension condition means that around each vertex, the weighted-sum of the out-going directions of edges equals zero. For higher dimension, sums are taken instead around each cell of dimension formula_83 after quotienting out the affine span of the cell. The property that &quot;V&quot; is connected in codimension one means for any two points lying on dimension &quot;d&quot; cells, there is a path connecting them that does not pass through any cells of dimension less than formula_83.

=== Tropical curves ===
The study of &quot;tropical curves&quot; (tropical varieties of dimension one) is particularly well developed and is strongly related to graph theory. For instance, the theory of divisors of tropical curves are related to chip-firing games on graphs associated to the tropical curves.

Many classical theorems of algebraic geometry have counterparts in tropical geometry, including:

* Pappus&#x27;s hexagon theorem. 
* Bézout&#x27;s theorem. 
* The degree-genus formula.
* The Riemann–Roch theorem.
* The group law of the cubics.

Oleg Viro used tropical curves to classify real curves of degree 7 in the plane up to isotopy. His method of &quot;patchworking&quot; gives a procedure to build a real curve of a given isotopy class from its tropical curve.

== Applications ==
A tropical line appeared in Paul Klemperer&#x27;s design of auctions used by the Bank of England during the financial crisis in 2007. Yoshinori Shiozawa defined subtropical algebra as max-times or min-times semiring (instead of max-plus and min-plus). He found that Ricardian trade theory (international trade without input trade) can be interpreted as subtropical convex algebra. Tropical geometry has also been used for analyzing the complexity of feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation.
Moreover, several optimization problems arising for instance in job scheduling, location analysis, transportation networks, decision making and discrete event dynamical systems can be formulated and solved in the framework of tropical geometry. A tropical counterpart of the Abel–Jacobi map can be applied to a crystal design. The weights in a weighted finite-state transducer are often required to be a tropical semiring. Tropical geometry can show self-organized criticality.

Tropical geometry has also found applications in several topics within theoretical high energy physics. In particular, tropical geometry has been used to drastically simplify string theory amplitudes to their field-theoretical limits and has found connections to constructions such as the Amplituhedron and tropological (topological Carrollian) sigma models.

<text>North Down is a parliamentary constituency in the United Kingdom House of Commons. The current MP is Alex Easton, elected at the 2024 United Kingdom general election.

Stephen Farry was elected to the position in the 2019 general election, replacing the incumbent Sylvia Hermon. Hermon had held the position since being elected to it in the 2001 general election, but chose not to contest in 2019.

==Constituency profile==
North Down covers the north coast of the Ards Peninsula including Bangor which has several Alliance councillors. Historically a unionist area, North Down is currently represented by Alex Easton

==Boundaries==

1885–1918: The baronies of Castlereagh Lower, Lower Ards, and Upper Ards, that part of the barony of Castlereagh Upper in the parishes of Comber and Knockbreda, and that part of the parliamentary borough of Belfast lying in County Down.

1918-1922: The Urban Districts of Bangor, Donaghadee and Newtownards, and that part of the Rural District of Newtownards not contained within the Mid Down division.

1950–1974: The Boroughs of Bangor and Newtownards, the Urban Districts of Donaghadee and Holywood, and the Rural Districts of Castlereagh, Hillsborough, and Newtownards.

1974–1983: The Boroughs of Bangor and Newtownards, the Urban Districts of Donaghadee and Holywood, the Rural District of North Down, in the Rural District of Castlereagh the district electoral divisions of Ballycultra, Craigavad, and Holywood Rural, and in the Rural District of Hillsborough the district electoral divisions of Annahilt, Ballykeel, Ballymacbrennan, Ballyskeagh, Ballyworfy, Blaris, Carryduff, Dromara, Drumbo, Glassdrumman, Hillsborough, Maze, Ouley, and Saintfield.

1983–1997: The District of North Down, and the District of Castlereagh wards of Ballyhanwood, Carrowreagh, Dundonald, Enler, Gilnahirk, and Tullycarnet.

1997–present: The District of North Down, and the District of Ards wards of Donaghadee North, Donaghadee South, and Millisle.

The county constituency was first created in 1885 from the northern part of Down. From the dissolution of Parliament in 1922, it was merged back into that constituency.

The seat was re-created in 1950 when the old two-MP Down constituency was abolished as part of the move to single-member seats. Originally the seat consisted of most of the northern parts of County Down, with the southern parts included in South Down. In January 1980, the Boundary Commission&#x27;s original proposals suggested significantly reducing the size of the constituency and renaming it &#x27;Loughside&#x27; on the grounds that this would avoid confusion in the event of borough council elections being held on the same day. As a result, in 1983 the seat was radically cut down as part of an expansion of Northern Ireland&#x27;s constituencies from 12 to 17, although the name remained unaltered. Significant parts of the constituency were transferred to the new Strangford constituency. In boundary changes proposed by a review in 1995, the seat exchanged territory with Strangford, losing the Dundonald area from Castlereagh and gaining a part of Ards.

The seat now contains the entirety of North Down district as well as Donaghadee and Millisle in Ards.

In 2005, the Boundary Commission published provisional recommendations for modifying the boundaries of constituencies in Northern Ireland. No changes were proposed for North Down. This proved acceptable at the public enquiries and the Assistant Commissioner also recommended no change to the constituency meaning that the constituency is to remain unchanged.

==History==
===1885 to 1922===
The constituency was a strongly unionist area being held by the Irish Unionist Party. Neither the Nationalist Party or Sinn Féin contested the seat in 1918.

====The First Dáil====
Sinn Féin contested the general election of 1918 on the platform that instead of taking up any seats they won in the Imperial Parliament, they would establish a revolutionary assembly in Dublin. In 1921 Sinn Féin decided to use the UK-mounted elections for the Northern Ireland House of Commons and the House of Commons of Southern Ireland as a ballot for the Second Dáil of the Irish Republic. The constituency was incorporated into the eight-member constituency of Down, and saw the President of Dáil Éireann, Éamon de Valera, elected there. The constituency also elected the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Sir James Craig, to the Parliament of Northern Ireland.

===1950 to present===
North Down is one of the most overwhelmingly unionist parts of Northern Ireland, with nationalist parties routinely getting no more than 5% of the vote, if that. In the 1955 election George Currie, the Ulster Unionist candidate, gained 96.8% of the popular vote, which he &quot;bettered&quot; in 1959 with some 98%. These shares of the popular votes are the highest ever achieved in a United Kingdom general election (post 1832 Reform). However it has arguably the most volatile and unpredictable politics of the entire province. Whereas elsewhere there are effectively three fundamental battles fought in elections – between the Ulster Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party to be the leading unionist party, between the Social Democratic and Labour Party and Sinn Féin to be the leading nationalist party, and between unionism and nationalism as a whole, North Down is different. The lack of any substantial nationalist vote renders the last two battles immaterial. Of Northern Ireland&#x27;s five main parties, only the Ulster Unionist Party and the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland have historically had a significant organisation and support in the constituency, though the Democratic Unionist Party has recently started to gain a foothold where previously it was nearly non-existent.

In addition the constituency has seen many substantial votes for smaller party groupings and individuals. The Ulster Popular Unionist Party, the Conservative Party, the UK Unionist Party and the Northern Ireland Women&#x27;s Coalition have all polled substantially in the last fifteen years, whilst in local council elections many independent candidates gain sufficient votes to be elected. The area is the heartland of numerous &quot;one-man parties&quot;, of which the Ulster Popular Unionist Party and the UK Unionist Party are the best known but far from the only ones. There have been many examples of elected individuals changing party allegiance and often successfully defending their seats for the new party.

The constituency is the most prosperous in Northern Ireland and is widely considered to be the most similar to an English constituency. In part because of this the seat was the heartland of the Equal Citizenship campaign in the late 1980s which argued that political parties in Britain should organise and contest elections in Northern Ireland, in the hope that this would &quot;normalise&quot; the politics of the province. The Conservative Party established itself (having in earlier years been in alliance with the Ulster Unionist Party until a breakdown in relations in the 1970s) and to date has been relatively strongest in North Down though in recent years its vote has declined heavily from the brief surge in the elections held between 1989 and 1992.

Traditionally levels of turnout in elections are very low by Northern Ireland standards, possibly because the lack of a serious threat of a nationalist victory removes the impetus to vote common among unionists elsewhere in the province. The one significant exception to the levels of turnout was the 1998 referendum on the Good Friday Agreement where turnout reached 80%, a total not come close to since 1921.

The parliamentary constituency was original held by the Ulster Unionist Party with no serious opposition. In 1970 James Kilfedder was first elected and he proceeded to accumulate a high level of personal popularity in the constituency. In 1977 he left the Ulster Unionists in protest over their increasing support for Enoch Powell&#x27;s proposed policy of &quot;integration&quot; for Northern Ireland, rather than the restoration of devolved government. Standing as an independent Unionist, Kilfedder successfully defended his seat against a UUP challenge in the 1979 general election. The following year he formed the Ulster Popular Unionist Party, with a few local councillors being elected on the label.

Kilfedder continued to hold his seat. Then in the 1987 general election he agreed an electoral pact with the Ulster Unionists and the Democratic Unionist Party to form a united opposition to the Anglo-Irish Agreement. However the local UUP candidate, Robert McCartney, was opposed to this pact and refused to withdraw. He was expelled from the UUP and so stood as a &quot;Real Unionist&quot; on a platform of complete integration for the province. Kilfedder retained the seat but with a reduced majority. As part of his platform for integration, McCartney had called for the major UK parties to organise and stand in the province and his result gave impetus to this campaign.

The Conservative Party did very well in the 1989 local elections for North Down Borough Council when they became the largest party. They stood candidates in several Northern Ireland constituencies in the 1992 general election, but their strongest prospect was expected to be North Down. Kilfedder by this stage was taking the Conservative whip at Westminster and so was aggrieved by this (and subsequently given a knighthood). In the event the result was similar to 1987, with the Conservatives getting a similar vote to McCartney.

Kilfedder died in 1995, and his Ulster Popular Unionist Party faded away even before the resulting by-election. By this time support for the Northern Ireland Conservatives had collapsed, and there was much speculation about how the by-election would go. The Ulster Unionist Party was hopeful that it could retake the seat, but McCartney also stood, this time as a &quot;UK Unionist&quot; with the support of the Democratic Unionist Party. No candidate stood for the Popular Unionists or any nationalist party. On a low turnout, McCartney won, with the Conservative vote collapsing from 32% to 2.1%.

McCartney further established his UK Unionist Party and sought to challenge the existing unionist parties by offering a less sectarian alternative. He held his seat in the 1997 election and was also elected to both the Northern Ireland Peace Forum in 1996 and the Northern Ireland Assembly in 1998, though on each occasion he was the only UK Unionist elected from North Down. In the 1998 Assembly election the Ulster Unionists had their strongest result in the province and there was much speculation that they could unseat McCartney at the next general election.

A rather public row erupted over the selection of the UUP&#x27;s candidate. The local Assembly member Peter Weir was selected, but his opposition to the Good Friday Agreement and David Trimble&#x27;s leadership became very prominent and a running source of embarrassment to the party. Weir was subsequently deselected; his replacement as candidate, Sylvia Hermon, was supportive of both Trimble and the Agreement. Hermon, aided by the Alliance standing aside, won the seat.

Weir remained as an Assembly member but subsequently defected to the Democratic Unionist Party. In the 2003 Assembly election Weir successfully defended his seat for the DUP, who also gained another MLA from the Northern Ireland Women&#x27;s Coalition. At the 2005 general election the party battle was altered somewhat by the DUP running Weir, the Alliance putting up a candidate, and McCartney – after some speculation – deciding not to stand but to instead endorse Weir. In a strong contest, Hermon retained the seat, becoming at that time the only Ulster Unionist MP, though she later left that party. She retained her seat at the 2010 election as an independent with the second-biggest margin of any Northern Irish MP (behind Gerry Adams in Belfast West) and was re-elected at the 2015 and 2017 elections, although her majority was considerably reduced.

Hermon retired at the 2019 election. The bulk of her support shifted to the Alliance, and a split unionist vote allowed Alliance candidate Stephen Farry to capture the seat, becoming the Alliance&#x27;s only MP.

In the 2024 United Kingdom general election in Northern Ireland, former MLA for North Down (Assembly constituency) Alex Easton succeeded in capturing the seat from Stephen Farry, defeating him in a landslide, with the backing from the DUP and Traditional Unionist Voice, running as an Independent Unionist.

=== Elections in the 2000s ===








=== Elections in the 1990s ===




The figures and result are compared to the 1992 general election, not the 1995 by-election.








=== Elections in the 1980s ===









In 1980 Kilfedder formed the small Ulster Popular Unionist Party and contested all subsequent elections under this label.

=== Elections in the 1970s ===



Kilfedder left the Ulster Unionists in 1977, in opposition to Enoch Powell&#x27;s proposals for integration instead of devolution for Northern Ireland, and defended his seat as an Independent Ulster Unionist. The new Ulster Unionist candidate was Clifford Smyth, who had previously been a Democratic Unionist Party assembly member in North Antrim.

<doc id="867053" wikidata="Q15261121" url="?curid=867053" title="National Grid (Great Britain)">
<text>The National Grid is the high-voltage electric power transmission network supporting the UK&#x27;s electricity market, connecting power stations and major substations, and ensuring that electricity generated anywhere on the grid can be used to satisfy demand elsewhere. The network serves the majority of Great Britain and some of the surrounding islands. It does not cover Northern Ireland, which is part of the Irish single electricity market.

The National Grid is a wide area synchronous grid operating at a nominal 50 hertz. Most of the physical HV parts of the grid consists of 400 kV lines as well as some 275 kV lines that collectively form a supergrid. It has several undersea interconnectors: an AC connector to the Isle of Man, and DC connectors to Northern Ireland, the Shetland Islands, the Republic of Ireland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, and Denmark. 

Since the privatisation of the Central Electricity Generating Board in 1990, the National Grid in England and Wales is owned by National Grid plc. In Scotland the grid is owned by ScottishPower Transmission in the south, and by SSE in the north. Infrastructure connecting offshore wind farms to the grid is owned by offshore transmission owners. 

Since October 2024, the transmission system operator for the whole GB grid is the government-owned National Energy System Operator (NESO).

==History==
At the end of the 19th century, Nikola Tesla established the principles of three-phase high-voltage electric power distribution while he was working for Westinghouse in the United States. The first use of this system in the United Kingdom was by Charles Merz, of the Merz &amp; McLellan consulting partnership, at his Neptune Bank Power Station near Newcastle upon Tyne. This opened in 1901, and by 1912 had developed into the largest integrated power system in Europe. The rest of the country, however, continued to use a patchwork of small supply networks.

In 1925, the British government asked Lord Weir, a Glaswegian industrialist, to solve the problem of Britain&#x27;s inefficient and fragmented electricity supply industry. Weir consulted Merz, and the result was the Electricity (Supply) Act 1926, which recommended that a &quot;national gridiron&quot; supply system be created. The 1926 Act created the Central Electricity Board, which set up the UK&#x27;s first synchronised, nationwide AC grid, running at 132 kV, 50 Hz.
The grid was created with of cables – mostly overhead – linking the 122 most efficient power stations. The first &quot;grid tower&quot; was erected near Edinburgh on 14 July 1928, and work was completed in September 1933, ahead of schedule and on budget. It began operating in 1933 as a series of regional grids with auxiliary interconnections for emergency use. Following the unauthorised but successful short term parallelling of all regional grids by the night-time engineers on 29 October 1937, by 1938 the grid was operating as a national system. The growth by then in the number of electricity users was the fastest in the world, rising from three quarters of a million in 1920 to nine million in 1938. The grid proved its worth during the Blitz, when South Wales provided power to replace lost output from Battersea and Fulham power stations. The grid was nationalised by the Electricity Act 1947, which also created the British Electricity Authority. In 1949, the British Electricity Authority decided to upgrade the grid by adding 275 kV links.

At its inception in 1950, the 275 kV Transmission System was designed to form part of a national supply system with an anticipated total demand of 30,000 MW by 1970. The predicted demand was already exceeded by 1960. This rapid growth led the Central Electricity Generating Board (created in 1958) to carry out a study in 1960 of future transmission needs.

Considered in the study, together with the increased demand, was the effect on the transmission system of the rapid advances in generator design resulting in projected power stations of 2,000–3,000 MW installed capacity. These new stations were mostly to be sited where advantage could be taken of a surplus of cheap low-grade fuel and adequate supplies of cooling water, but these sites did not coincide with the load centres. West Burton&#x27;s 4 × 500 MW machines, in the Nottinghamshire coalfield near the River Trent, is an example. These developments shifted the emphasis on the transmission system from interconnection to bulk power transfers from the generation areas to the load centres, such as the anticipated transfer in 1970 of some 6,000 MW from the Midlands to the home counties.

Continued reinforcement and extension of the 275 kV systems was examined as a possible solution. However, in addition to the technical problem of high fault levels, many more lines would have been required to obtain the estimated transfers at 275 kV. As this was not consistent with the Central Electricity Generating Board&#x27;s policy of preservation of amenities, a better solution was sought. Consideration was given to 400 kV and 500 kV schemes: both gave a sufficient margin for future expansion. The decision in favour of a 400 kV system was made for two main reasons. Firstly the majority of the 275 kV lines could be uprated to 400 kV, and secondly it was envisaged that operation at 400 kV could begin in 1965 compared with 1968 for a 500 kV scheme. Design work was started and in order to meet the programme for 1965 it was necessary for the contract engineering for the first projects to run concurrently with the design. One of these projects was the West Burton 400 kV Indoor Substation, the first section of which was commissioned in June 1965. From 1965, the grid was partly upgraded to 400 kV, beginning with a line from Sundon to West Burton, to become the Supergrid.

In the 2010 issue of the code that governs the National Grid, the &quot;Grid Code&quot;, the Supergrid is defined as those parts of the British electricity transmission system that are connected at voltages in excess of 200 kV.

The 2.2 GW undersea Western HVDC Link from Scotland to North Wales was built in 2013–2018. This was the first major non-alternating current grid link within Great Britain, although interconnectors to foreign grids already used HVDC.

In 2021 a new non-lattice design of electricity pylon, the T-pylon, was built near East Huntspill, Somerset for the new 35 mile Hinkley Point C to Avonmouth connection.

In 2023, the National Grid began removing equipment from China&#x27;s NARI Technology over national security concerns.

In 2024, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero established the publicly owned NESO to acquire the electricity system operator license from National Grid plc.

==Characteristics of the grid==


The contiguous synchronous grid covers England (including the Isle of Wight), Scotland (including some of the Scottish islands such as Orkney, Skye and the Western Isles which have limited connectivity), Wales, and the Isle of Man.

===Network size===
The following figures are taken from the 2005 Seven Year Statement.
* Maximum demand (2005/6): 63 GW (approx.) (81.39% of capacity)
* Minimum demand (2020 May): 15.3 GW
* Annual electrical energy used in the UK is around 
* Capacity (2005/6): 79.9 GW (or 80 GW per the 2008 Seven Year Statement)
* Number of large power stations connected to it: 181
* Length of 400 kV grid: 11,500 km (circuit)
* Length of 275 kV grid: 9,800 km (circuit)
* Length of 132 kV (or lower) grid; 5,250 km (circuit)

Total generating capacity is supplied roughly equally by renewable, gas fired, nuclear, coal fired power stations. Annual energy transmitted in the UK grid is around , with an average load factor of 72% (i.e. 3.6×1011/(8,760 × 57×106).

=== Decarbonisation ===
Decarbonisation plans in 2020 from the UK government and National Grid initially set a stretch target to be carbon neutral or negative by 2033, earlier than the UK&#x27;s national target to achieve this by 2050. National Grid also aimed to have the capability to be &#x27;zero carbon&#x27; as early as 2025, meaning that if energy suppliers are able to produce sufficient green power, the grid could theoretically run without any greenhouse gas emissions at all (i.e. no carbon capture or offsetting would be needed as is the case with &#x27;net zero&#x27;). In 2020, about 40% of the grid&#x27;s energy came from burning natural gas, and it was not expected that anywhere close to sufficient green power would be available to run the grid on zero carbon in 2025, except perhaps on the very windiest days. Analysts such as Hartree Solutions considered in 2020 that getting to &#x27;net zero&#x27; by 2050 would be challenging, even more so to reach &#x27;net zero&#x27; by 2033.

There has been sustained progress towards carbon neutrality, with carbon intensity falling by 53% in the five years to 2020. The phase-out of coal has been completed: in 2020, only 1.6% of the UK&#x27;s electricity came from coal, compared with about 25% in 2015. 2020 also saw the UK go more than two months without needing to burn any coal for electricity, the longest period since the Industrial Revolution. On 30 September 2024, on the closure of the last coal-fired power station, UK electricity became coal-free.

In July 2024, The Royal Academy of Engineering released a report into the progress of National Grid&#x27;s decarbonisation strategy. The report &quot;Rapid Decarbonisation of the GB Electricity System&quot; stated the government’s mission to provide clean power by 2030 sharply raises the level of ambition from an already challenging 2035 target. A revised strategy in 2024 meant that the UK government now aimed to reach this goal by 2030, advancing from the original target of 2035. This change in delivery date was made possible by recent infrastructure investments, and a proposed £77 billion to enhance the electricity transmission network between 2026 and 2031. Months prior to this, an announcement was made about the creation of Great British Energy, a government-backed renewable energy firm. Its creation, and projects that it would have a minority stake in, would play a large role in reaching the government&#x27;s 2030 target. Investments of £8.3 billion were planned by GBE in offshore wind, hydrogen power, carbon capture and nuclear power developments before 2030.

The 2030 decarbonisation target has also been made possible by the scaling of capacity in offshore wind, while onshore wind and solar sites have been identified to increase the usage of those sites. Public information programs and campaigns have been introduced to try and change user habits in electricity consumption, which can mean using large sources of power outside peak hours. Reductions in the costs of electric vehicle charging overnight is one such scheme that had large take-up in 2024. 

Despite progress, there are still some challenges that remain to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035 and net zero by 2050. Development and the installation of transmission energy infrastructure is essential to achieving these goals. System flexibility is a concern: for example, solar is less effective during long periods of heavy rain, thus other green energy solutions are needed to meet the demand. Should clean energy fail to achieve this flexibility, the British media suggested blackouts could be possible, although the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; stated in January 2025 that large-scale blackouts remain unlikely. Regulatory reforms and energy storage innovations would also play a major role in ensuring clean energy always provides the grid with enough power.

===Losses===
Figures are again from the 2005 Seven Year Statement.
* Joule heating in cables: 857.8 MW
* Fixed losses: 266 MW (consists of corona and iron loss; can be 100 MW higher in adverse weather)
* Substation transformer heating losses: 142.4 MW
* Generator transformer heating losses: 157.3 MW
* Total losses: 1,423.5 MW (2.29% of peak demand)

Although overall losses in the National Grid are low, there are significant further losses in onward electricity distribution to the consumer, causing a total distribution loss of about 7.7%. Losses differ significantly for customers connected at different voltages; connected at high voltage the total losses are about 2.6%, at medium voltage 6.4% and at low voltage 12.2%.

Generated power entering the grid is metered at the high-voltage side of the generator transformer. Any power losses in the generator transformer are therefore accounted to the generating company, not to the grid system. The power loss in the generator transformer does not contribute to the grid losses.

===Power flow===
In 2009–10 there was an average power flow of about 11 GW from the north of the UK, particularly from Scotland and northern England, to the south of the UK across the grid. This flow was anticipated to grow to about 12 GW by 2014. Completion of the Western HVDC Link in 2018 added capacity for a flow of 2.2 GW between Western Scotland and North Wales.

Because of the power loss associated with this north to south flow, the effectiveness and efficiency of new generation capacity is significantly affected by its location. For example, new generating capacity on the south coast has about 12% greater effectiveness due to reduced transmission system power losses compared to new generating capacity in north England, and about 20% greater effectiveness than in northern Scotland.

===Interconnectors===

There is a 40 MW AC cable to the Isle of Man, the Isle of Man to England Interconnector and a 260km 600MW HVDC cable to the Shetland Islands.

The UK grid is connected to adjacent European electrical grids by submarine power cables.

In 2014, the UK&#x27;s electricity interconnection level (off-island transmission capacity relative to production capacity) was 6%. 

, the total capacity of these connectors is over 9 GW. They include direct-current cables to northern France (2 GW HVDC Cross-Channel, 1 GW HVDC IFA-2, 1 GW ElecLink via the Channel Tunnel); Belgium (1 GW HVDC Nemo Link); the Netherlands (1 GW HVDC BritNed); Norway (1.4 GW HDVC North Sea Link); Northern Ireland (500 MW HVDC Moyle Interconnector); the Republic of Ireland (500 MW HVDC East–West Interconnector), and Denmark (1.4 GW Viking Link). 

A further 500 MW link with the Republic of Ireland (Greenlink) is scheduled for 2024. Further potential schemes include links with Germany (NeuConnect, 1.4 GW); Iceland (Icelink, around 1 GW) and Morocco (3.6 GW from new battery-backed solar generation).

===Grid storage===
The UK grid has access to large pumped storage systems, notably Dinorwig Power Station which can provide 1.7 GW for 5–6 hours, and the smaller Cruachan and Ffestiniog.

There are also some grid batteries. As of May 2021, 1.3 GW of battery storage was operating in the United Kingdom, with 16 GW of projects in the pipeline potentially deployable over the next few years. A 100 MW power Chinese-financed plant at Minety, Wiltshire was reported to be the largest in Europe when it opened in July 2021; when a 50 MW extension is completed, the site&#x27;s storage capacity will be 266 MWh.

===Reserve services and frequency response===

National Grid is responsible for contracting short term generating provision to cover demand prediction errors and sudden failures at power stations. This covers a few hours of operation giving time for market contracts to be established to cover longer term balancing.

The grid frequency is normally maintained within 49.8 and 50.2 Hz. Frequency-response reserves act to keep the system&#x27;s AC frequency within ±1% of 50 Hz, except in exceptional circumstances. These are used on a second by second basis to either lower the demand or to provide extra generation. In an emergency where the discrepancy between supply and demand is too great and the frequency drops too far (between 48.8 Hz down to 47.8 Hz) then the Low Frequency Demand Disconnection (LFDD) automatic cutouts progressively trigger and remove up to 60% of the customer load from the Supergrid to avoid blacking out the entire grid.

Reserve services are a group of services each acting within different response times:
* Fast Reserve: rapid delivery (within two minutes) of increased generation or reduced demand, sustainable for a minimum of 15 minutes.
* Fast Start: generation units that start from a standstill and deliver power within five minutes automatically, or within seven minutes of a manual instruction, with generation maintained for a minimum of four hours.
* Demand Management: reduction in demand of at least 25 MW from large power users, for at least an hour.
* Short Term Operating Reserve (STOR): generation of at least 3 MW, from a single or aggregation of sites, within four hours of instruction and maintained for at least two hours.
* BM Start-Up: mainstream major generation units maintained in either an &quot;energy readiness&quot; or &quot;hot standby&quot; state.

These reserves are sized according to three factors:
* The largest credible single generation failure event, which is currently either Sizewell B nuclear power station (1,260 MW) or one cable of the HVDC Cross-Channel interconnector (1,000 MW)
* The general anticipated availability of all generation plants
* Anticipated demand prediction errors

==Control of the grid==
The English and Welsh parts of the National Grid are controlled from the National Grid Control Centre which is located in St Catherine&#x27;s Lodge, Sindlesham, Wokingham in Berkshire. It is sometimes described as being a &#x27;secret&#x27; location. the system is under consistent cyber attack.

Although the transmission network in Scotland is owned by separate companies – SP Transmission plc (part of ScottishPower) in the south, and Scottish Hydro Electric Transmission plc (part of Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks) in the north – overall control rests with National Grid Electricity System Operator.

==Transmission costs==

The costs of operating the National Grid System are recouped by National Grid Electricity System Operator (NGESO) through levying of Transmission Network Use of System (TNUoS) charges on the users of the system. The costs are split between the generators and the users of electricity.

Tariffs are set annually by NGESO, and the country is divided into zones, each with a different tariff for generation and consumption. In general, tariffs are higher for generators in the north and consumers in the south since there is generally a north–south flow of electricity.

===Triad demand===
&#x27;Triad demand&#x27; is a metric of demand which reports retrospectively three numbers about peak demand between November and February (inclusive) each winter. In order to encourage usage of the National Grid to be less &#x27;peaky&#x27;, the triad is used as the basis for extra charges paid by the users (the licensed electricity suppliers) to the National Grid: the users pay less if they can manage their usage so as to be less peaky.

For each year&#x27;s calculation, historic system demand metrics are analysed to determine three half-hour periods of high average demand; the three periods are known as triads. The periods are (a) the period of peak system demand, and (b) two other periods of highest demand which are separated from peak system demand and from each other by at least ten days.

For power stations, the chargeable demand is only the net site demand (per CUSC rule 14.17.10), so when the site is net exporting (i.e. total metered generation at that site exceeds total separately metered station demand), that separately metered station demand shall not be liable for demand TNUoS charges in relation to the station demand at triad.

Triad dates in recent years were:
This is the main source of income which National Grid uses to cover its costs for high-voltage long-distance transmission (lower voltage distribution is charged separately). The grid also charges an annual fee to cover the cost of generators, distribution networks and large industrial users connecting.

Triad charges encourage users to cut load at peak periods; this is often achieved by using diesel generators. Such generators are also routinely used by National Grid.

===Estimating costs per kW⋅h of transmission===
If the total TNUoS or Triad receipts (say £15,000/MW·year × 50,000 MW = £750 million/year) is divided by the total number of units delivered by the UK generating system in a year (the total number of units sold – say .), then a crude estimate can be made of transmission costs, and one gets the figure of around 0.2p/kW⋅h. Other estimates also give a figure of 0.2p/kW⋅h.

However, Bernard Quigg notes: &quot;According to the 06/07 annual accounts for NGC UK transmission, NGC carried 350TW⋅h for an income of £2012m in 2007, i. e. NGC receives 0.66p per kW hour. With two years inflation to 2008/9, say 0.71p per kW⋅h.&quot;, but this also includes generators&#x27; connection fees.

===Generation charges===
In order to be allowed to supply electricity to the transmission system, generators must be licensed (by BEIS) and enter into a connection agreement with NGET which also grants Transmission Entry Capacity (TEC). Generators contribute to the costs of running the system by paying for TEC, at the generation TNUoS tariffs set by NGET. This is charged on a maximum-capacity basis. In other words, a generator with 100 MW of TEC who only generated at a maximum rate of 75 MW during the year would still be charged for the full 100 MW of TEC.

In some cases, there are negative TNUoS tariffs. These generators are paid an amount based on their peak net supply over three &quot;proving runs&quot; over the course of the year. This represents the reduction in costs caused by having a generator close to the centre of demand of the country.

National Grid uses a grid services market. &quot;Dynamic Containment&quot; started in October 2020, initially priced at £17 per MW per hour, and Dynamic Regulation (DR) started in April 2022.

===Demand charges===

Consumers of electricity are split into two categories: half-hourly metered (HH) and non-half-hourly metered (NHH). Customers whose peak demand is sufficiently high are obliged to have a HH meter, which, in effect, takes a meter reading every 30 minutes. The rates at which charges are levied on these customers&#x27; electricity suppliers therefore varies 17,520 times a (non-leap) year.

The TNUoS charges for a HH metered customer are based on their demand during three half-hour periods of greatest demand between November and February, known as the Triad. Due to the nature of electricity demand in the UK, the three Triad periods always fall in the early evening, and must be separated by at least ten clear working days. The TNUoS charges for a HH customer are simply their average demand during the triad periods multiplied by the tariff for their zone. Therefore, () a customer in London with a 1 MW average demand during the three triad periods would pay £19,430 in TNUoS charges.

TNUoS charges levied on NHH metered customers are much simpler. A supplier is charged for the sum of their total consumption between 16:00 and 19:00 every day over a year, multiplied by the relevant tariff.

===Constraint payments===
Constraint payments are payments to generators above a certain size, where the National Grid gives them dispatch instructions that they are unable to take the electricity that the generators would normally provide. This can be due to a lack of transmission capacity, a shortfall in demand, or unexpected excess generation. A constraint payment is recompense for the reduction in generation.

==Major incidents==
Power cuts due to faults in the national grid, or lack of generation to supply it with sufficient power, are very rare. The overall performance of the system is published on National Grid&#x27;s website and includes a simple high-level figure for the transmission system availability. this was 99.999612%.

In 2020–21, issues affecting the low voltage distribution networks – for which National Grid is not responsible – caused almost all the 60 minutes or so per year, on average, of unplanned domestic power cuts.

Since 1990, there have been a small number of prominent power outages which were linked to National Grid:

===August 2003===
In the early evening of 28 August 2003, a power cut affected 476,000 customers in the south London area, as well as the London Underground and some rail services, for approximately 40 minutes. A total of 724 MW of load was lost.

An oil leak, in a transformer, had been left untreated, except for top-ups, for many months, pending a proper fix. This caused an alarm which was misinterpreted by the National Grid control room. While switching the presumed faulty equipment out, an incorrectly sized protection relay installed several years prior caused a circuit breaker to trip, resulting in the loss of supply to two major south London substations.

===September 2003===

A week after the London blackout, on 5 September 2003, an incident occurred at Hams Hall substation which affected supply to 201,000 customers in east Birmingham. Affected customers included Network Rail, Birmingham International Airport, and the National Exhibition Centre, with a total of 301 MW of load lost.

This was attributed to an error made by National Grid when commissioning protection systems after upgrading components in the substation that August.

===May 2008===

On 27 May 2008 starting at 11:34, two of Britain&#x27;s largest power stations, Longannet in Fife and Sizewell B in Suffolk, disconnected from the grid (&quot;tripped&quot;) within minutes of each other. The total combined loss of generation caused by these trips was at least 1714 MW — larger than the maximum loss of 1260 MW which the grid was required to support that day.

The system frequency immediately dropped to 49.2 Hz, and subsequent additional trips of generation due to automatic protection caused the frequency to fall further to a low of 48.8 Hz. This caused the distribution networks to automatically disconnect some customers in order to arrest the frequency drop, and over the next few hours National Grid ordered the distribution networks to reduce voltage in order to reduce demand. At least 500,000 customers lost power. Within 40 minutes, distribution networks were allowed to reconnect all customers, although voltage control continued in some areas until 18:07.

The incident was described as a &quot;gigantic coincidence&quot; and was not attributed to lack of investment. Nonetheless, a number of issues were exposed by the event. The behaviour of generation protection during sudden frequency changes caused a number of generators to disconnect from the grid incorrectly. The Low Frequency Demand Disconnection and voltage control schemes also did not deliver as much demand reduction as they were intended to, but this did not have a significant impact on the outage.

===August 2019===
The third event occurred on 9 August 2019, when around a million customers across Great Britain found themselves without power. Lightning struck a transmission line at 4:52 pm, causing the loss of 500 MW embedded (mostly solar) generation. Almost immediately, Little Barford Power Station and Hornsea Wind Farm tripped within seconds of each other, removing 1.378 GW of generation, which was in excess of the 1 GW of backup power (the size of the largest single expected loss) that the operator was maintaining at the time. The grid frequency fell to 48.8 Hz before automatic load-shedding disconnected 5% of the local distribution networks (1.1 million customers) for 15 to 20 minutes; this action stabilised the remaining 95% of the system and prevented a wider blackout.

Although power was maintained at all times to the railway network (but not to the signalling system), the reduction in frequency caused 60 Thameslink Class 700 and 717 trains to fail. Half were restarted by the drivers but the others required a technician to come out to the train to restart it. This led to substantial travel disruption for several hours on the East Coast Main Line and Thameslink services. The supply to Newcastle Airport was also disrupted, and a weakness was exposed in backup power arrangements at Ipswich Hospital.

An investigation by Ofgem concluded in January 2020. It found that Little Barford and Hornsea One had failed to remain connected to the grid following the lightning strike, and their operators – RWE and Ørsted respectively – agreed to each pay £4.5 million to Ofgem&#x27;s redress fund. Additionally, Ofgem fined distribution network operator UK Power Networks £1.5M for beginning to reconnect customers before being cleared to do so, although this breach of procedure did not affect the recovery of the system.

==Minor incidents==

===November 2015===
On 4 November 2015 National Grid issued an emergency notice asking for voluntary power cuts because of &quot;multiple plant breakdowns&quot;. No power cuts occurred but wholesale electricity prices rose dramatically, with the grid paying up to £2,500 per megawatt-hour.

<text>A crest is a component of a heraldic display, consisting of the device borne on top of the helm. Originating in the decorative sculptures worn by knights in tournaments and, to a lesser extent, battles, crests became solely pictorial after the 16th century (the era referred to by heraldists as that of &quot;paper heraldry&quot;).

A normal heraldic achievement consists of the shield, above which is set the helm, on which sits the crest, its base encircled by a circlet of twisted cloth known as a torse. The use of the crest and torse independently from the rest of the achievement, a practice which became common in the era of paper heraldry, has led the term &quot;crest&quot; to be frequently but erroneously used to refer to the arms displayed on the shield, or to the achievement as a whole.

==Origin==

The word &quot;crest&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;crista&quot;, meaning &quot;tuft&quot; or &quot;plume&quot;, perhaps related to &quot;crinis&quot;, &quot;hair&quot;. Crests had existed in various forms since ancient times: Roman officers wore fans of feathers or horsehair, which were placed longitudinally or transversely depending on the wearer&#x27;s rank, and Viking helmets were often adorned with wings and animal heads. They first appeared in a heraldic context in the form of the metal fans worn by knights in the 12th and 13th centuries. These were primarily decorative, but may also have served a practical purpose by lessening or deflecting the blows of opponents&#x27; weapons (perhaps why their edges came to be serrated). These fans were generally of one colour, later evolving to repeat all or part of the arms displayed on the shield.

The fan crest was later developed by cutting out the figure displayed on it, to form a metal outline; this evolved in the late 13th and early 14th centuries into a three-dimensional sculpture. These were usually made of cloth, leather or paper over a wooden or wire framework, and were typically in the form of an animal; also popular were wings, horns, human figures, and panaches of feathers. These were probably worn only in tournaments, not battle: not only did they add to the already considerable weight of the helm, they could also have been used by opponents as a handle to pull the wearer&#x27;s head down.

Laces, straps, or rivets were used to affix the crest to the helm, with the join being covered by a circlet of twisted cloth known as a torse or wreath, or by a coronet in the case of high-ranking nobles. Torses did not come into regular use in Britain until the 15th century, and are still uncommon on the Continent, where crests are usually depicted as continuing into the mantling. Crests were also sometimes mounted on a furred cap known as a chapeau, as in the royal crest of England.

==Later development==
By the 16th century, the age of tournaments had ended, and physical crests largely disappeared. Their illustrated equivalents consequently began to be treated as simply two-dimensional pictures. Many crests from this period are physically impossible to bear on a helm, e.g. the crest granted to Sir Francis Drake in 1581, which consisted of a disembodied hand issuing from clouds and leading a ship around the globe (representing God&#x27;s guidance).

In the same period, different helms began to be used for different ranks: sovereigns&#x27; and knights&#x27; helms faced forwards (&quot;affronté&quot;), whereas those of peers and gentlemen faced to the right (&quot;dexter&quot;). In the medieval period crests would always have faced the same way as the helm, but as a result of these rules, the directions of the crest and the helm might be at variance: a knight whose crest was a lion &quot;statant&quot;, would have the lion depicted as looking over the side of the helm, rather than towards the viewer. Torses also suffered artistically, being treated not as silken circlets, but as horizontal bars.

Heraldry in general underwent something of a renaissance in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and many of the illogicalities of previous centuries were discarded. Crests are now generally not granted unless they could actually be used on a physical helm, and the rules about directions of helms are no longer rigidly observed.

==Usage==

The use of crests was once restricted to those of &#x27;tournament rank&#x27;, i.e. knights and above, but in modern times nearly all personal arms include crests. They are not generally used by women (with the exception of reigning queens) and clergymen, as they did not participate in war or tournaments and thus would not have helms on which to wear them. Some heraldists are also of the opinion that crests, as personal devices, are not suited for use by corporate bodies, but this is not widely observed.

In continental Europe, particularly Germany, crests have a far greater significance than in Britain, and it is common for one person to display multiple crests with his arms; certain high-ranking noblemen are entitled to as many as seventeen. This practice did not exist in Britain until the modern era, and arms with more than one crest are still rare. In contrast to Continental practice, where a crest is never detached from its helm, a Briton with more than one crest may choose to display only one crested helm, and have the other crests simply floating in space. Though usually adopted through marriage to an heiress, examples exist of secondary crests being granted as augmentations: after defeating the Americans at the Battle of Bladensburg, Robert Ross was granted, in addition to his original crest, the crest of an arm holding the US flag with a broken flagstaff.
After the 16th century, it became common for armigers to detach the crest and wreath from the helm, and use them in the manner of a badge, displayed on crockery, carriage doors, stationery, etc. This led to the erroneous use of the term &quot;crest&quot; to mean &quot;arms&quot;, which has become widespread in recent years. In Scotland, a member of a clan or house is entitled to use a prescribed form of crest badge, which consists of the chief&#x27;s crest encircled by a strap and buckle inscribed with the chiefly motto. Unlike such a badge, which can be used by any number of relatives and retainers, the crest itself is personal to the armiger, and its use by others is considered usurpation.

It is widely observed in English heraldry that no two families may use the same crest. This is in contrast to Scottish practice, in which crests are less significant, and are often borne in the same form by unrelated people. As a result of this lack of need for differentiation, Scottish crests tend to be less ornamental than their English counterparts. Marks of cadency are generally not used with crests, though it is not incorrect to do so, and the British royal family continue this practice.

The usual torse around the crest is frequently replaced by some kind of coronet, known as a &quot;crest-coronet&quot;. The standard form is a simplified ducal coronet, consisting of three fleurons on a golden circlet; these are not, however, indications of rank, though they are not generally granted nowadays except in special circumstances. In some modern examples, the crest features both a crest-coronet and a torse, though this practice is deprecated by purists.

==Orders of chivalry==
Perhaps the only places physical crests are still seen are the chapels of Britain&#x27;s orders of chivalry: the Order of the Garter&#x27;s St George&#x27;s Chapel, the Order of the Thistle&#x27;s Thistle Chapel, and the Order of the Bath&#x27;s Henry VII Chapel. Within each chapel are rows of stalls for use by the knights; above these stalls are placed each knight&#x27;s sword and crested helm. These are carved out of lime wood and painted and gilded by Ian Brennan, the official sculptor to the royal household.

<text>Crazywell Pool or Crazy Well Pool is a large pond situated about south of Princetown just off the path between Burrator and Whiteworks on the western side of Dartmoor, Devon, England at . It is about long and has a surface area of about .

The pool is thought to be the result of excavations by tin miners, and is either a flooded mine shaft, or a reservoir. The presence of tin workings downhill from the pool support this view. The valley of Newleycombe Lake has been extensively worked with many mining remains along its short length. The level of the pool never varies much from its mean—it is maintained by a hidden spring and by subterranean drainage at its lower end. Near to the pool is Crazywell Cross, one of the line of crosses that marked the ancient track between Buckfast Abbey and Tavistock Abbey.

In 1998, Nathaniel Burton, a sixteen-year-old recruit in the Royal Marines, died in Crazywell Pool. He was taking part in a routine training exercise and drowned while crossing the icy waters of the pool.

==Legends==
There are no natural lakes on Dartmoor, which may be one reason why Crazywell Pool has attracted more than its share of local legends. It was once believed to be bottomless, and according to local legend the parishioners of Walkhampton (or Sheepstor) brought up the bell ropes from the parish church to test its depth. Even after tying the ropes together—a total length of over 500 feet—and weighting the end, it was claimed they were still unable to reach the bottom. This legend was disproved in the dry summer of 1844 when the pool was almost completely pumped out by the Plymouth Dock Water Company to supplement the water supply of Devonport Leat which runs along the hillside not far above the pool. The reality is that the pool is about deep at the western end and considerably less at the eastern end.
Crazywell Pool is the subject of other Dartmoor superstitions. The water level was said to rise and fall with the tides at sea, and it was claimed that at dusk the waters call out the name of the next parishioner to die and that their face can be seen in the surface of the pool at midnight on Midsummer&#x27;s Eve.

The pool was also said to be haunted during the Middle Ages by the Witch of Sheepstor, who gave people bad advice. Legend says she advised Piers Gaveston, who owned the Forest of Dartmoor from 1308, and who was in hiding here after being banished from the king&#x27;s court, telling him to return to court, predicting that &quot;his humbled head shall soon be high&quot;. Instead, he was captured by the king&#x27;s enemies and beheaded and his head was set up on high battlements.

More recently, two young men were said to have gone to the pool at midnight one Midsummer&#x27;s Eve on a motorbike for a dare, but they never returned because on their way back the motorbike came off the road, killing them both.

<doc id="867063" wikidata="Q778134" url="?curid=867063" title="NES Four Score and Satellite">
<text>The NES Four Score and NES Satellite are multitap accessories produced by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). With supported games, both peripherals allow the connection of up to four controllers to input simultaneously on the NES; they are interchangeable in their compatibility with supported games.

The major difference between the NES Four Score and the NES Satellite is that the former connects directly to the NES, while the latter uses infrared wireless communication instead; the latter acts as a range extender adaptor for all wired controllers, extending the usable range from around 3 feet (for a standard controller) to 15 feet. The Satellite consists of two units: a small infrared receiver that plugs into the console&#x27;s controller ports, and a main unit that is powered by six C batteries and must have a line of sight to the receiver. Both devices have four controller ports and two &quot;Turbo&quot; switches to simulate rapid pressing of the A and B buttons. The NES Satellite includes a switch to enable either a controller or light gun (NES Zapper) mode; the NES Four Score does not have such a switch and is incompatible with the latter peripheral as well as the Power Pad, but includes a different switch that enables either a two-controller or four-controller mode. 

NES games released prior to the introduction of the multitaps required the sharing of an NES controller if they supported more than two players (such as &quot;Anticipation&quot;); such games do not support the multitaps&#x27; individual controller feature as a result. Both devices were shown at the 1990 Winter Consumer Electronics Show.

Nintendo initially revealed the NES Satellite, designed by Rare Coin-It, to journalists in June 1989; it was previewed in the September–October 1989 issue of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; before releasing in North America in December 1989 at an MSRP of and was also featured in the NES Sports Set console bundle, which retailed for $150. The adapter was released in Sweden in February 1991 for . The NES Four Score was released in North America in March 1990 for .

==Games ==
These licensed games are compatible with the NES Four Score for more than two concurrent controllers:

* &quot;Bomberman II&quot; (up to three players)
* &quot;Championship Bowling&quot;
* &quot;Danny Sullivan&#x27;s Indy Heat&quot;
* &quot;Gauntlet II&quot;
* &quot;Greg Norman&#x27;s Golf Power&quot;
* &quot;Harlem Globetrotters&quot;
* &quot;Kings of the Beach&quot;
* &quot;Magic Johnson&#x27;s Fast Break&quot;
* &quot;Monster Truck Rally&quot;
* &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot;
* &quot;NES Play Action Football&quot;
* &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;
* &quot;Nintendo World Cup&quot; 
* &quot;R.C. Pro-Am II&quot;
* &quot;Rackets &amp; Rivals&quot;
* &quot;&quot;
* &quot;Smash TV&quot; (two players with two controllers each)
* &quot;Super Off Road&quot;
* &quot;Super Jeopardy!&quot;
* &quot;Super Spike V&#x27;Ball&quot;
* &quot;Swords and Serpents&quot;
* &quot;Top Players&#x27; Tennis&quot;
These homebrew games are also compatible:

*&quot;Justice Duel&quot;
*&quot;Micro Mages&quot;
These cancelled games were planned to support the devices:

*&quot;Hit the Ice&quot;
==Famicom counterparts==
Since the Famicom has hardwired controllers, all games supporting more than two controllers require the use of a controller or peripheral that plugs into the console&#x27;s expansion port. Some titles (such as &quot;Nekketsu Kakutō Densetsu&quot; and &quot;Nekketsu Kōkō Dodgeball Bu&quot;) require separate controllers to connect to it, while others (such as &quot;Downtown Nekketsu Kōshinkyoku: Soreyuke Daiundōkai&quot; and &quot;Wit&#x27;s&quot;) require the , a multitap manufactured by .

<text>Dartmeet is a popular tourist spot in the centre of Dartmoor, Devon, England at .

It lies at the end of the B3357 road, about east of Two Bridges. From here, the road continues eastwards as a minor road with restrictions on the size of vehicles, past Poundsgate and over Holne Bridge and New Bridge to Ashburton on the edge of the moor. Immediately east of the river crossing, this road ascends Dartmeet Hill, a long steep hill that climbs up the valley side.

As the name suggests, Dartmeet is the meeting point of the two major tributaries of the River Dart: the East Dart and West Dart. The road bridge, built in 1792, spans the East Dart; just above it, at the side of the large carpark is an earlier, possibly medieval, clapper bridge, now partially collapsed. The actual confluence of the two rivers is just downstream of the bridge. Dartmeet is the official put in for the Upper Dart section of the River Dart for whitewater kayakers and canoeists.

==History==
Dartmeet is at the centre of an internationally important archaeological landscape mainly due to its prehistoric field systems, delineated by reaves, which are among the best preserved in north west Europe.

Dartmeet was one of the boundary points mentioned (though not by name) in the 1240 Perambulation of the Forest of Dartmoor, the boundary coming down the East Dart from the Wallabrook, and continuing up the West Dart to the foot of the O Brook. The first documentary reference to the name (as &quot;Dartameet&quot;) was in a Duchy of Cornwall document dated 1616.

Halfway up Dartmeet Hill, close to the road, lies the Coffin Stone on which coffins would be placed to allow the bearers to take a rest on the way to taking bodies for burial at Widecombe-in-the-Moor. The rock is split in two, along its length. Local legend has it that the body of a particularly wicked man was laid there. God took exception to this, and struck the stone with a thunderbolt, destroying the coffin and splitting the stone in two.

<doc id="867073" wikidata="Q7335482" url="?curid=867073" title="Rip-off Britain">
<text>Rip-off Britain is an expression used by some to refer to the phenomenon in which some products and services cost significantly more in the United Kingdom than in other countries, especially member states of the European Union and the United States, than a basic currency conversion would permit.

==Origin==
In 1999, the Consumers&#x27; Association hired a stand at the British International Motor Show, only revealing on press day its true purpose in doing so—to highlight high British car prices. The organizers of the show, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, decided not to fan the media flames by ejecting the Consumers&#x27; Association.

By this point, the phrase had already taken hold in the mass media, and it became a term in frequent use to describe anything that was wrong with Britain. It also proved to be one of the elements leading to a tipping point in the harmonisation of car prices within the EU. The campaign was devised by UK advertising agency Claydon Heeley, who are known for such &quot;guerrilla marketing&quot; work.

==Possible causes==

===Taxation===
The level of indirect taxation applied to some products such as alcoholic drinks, tobacco, and petroleum may serve to disguise high profit margins by the retailer, but it may also work in the opposite direction, squeezing profits when there are other legal markets with lower taxation.

While the standard UK rate of Value Added Tax (VAT) of 20 per cent is generally triple or more that of US sales taxes, differences in prices can be far greater than this could account for.. The Crown Dependencies of Jersey and Guernsey are not part of the EU and Low Value Consignment Relief applied to imports. Retailers such as Play.com and Specsavers operated from Jersey or Guernsey specifically as a means of avoiding VAT.

In the UK, imported commercial goods valued up to £15 are exempt from VAT; for personal gifts, the exemption rises to £36. As of July 2014, imports up to the value of £135 are not liable for UK customs duty.

===Business costs===
Companies sometimes argue that some of their fixed costs are higher in the United Kingdom than elsewhere, such as for storage and distribution. The truthfulness of this defence varies from case to case. For example, the UK has around the fiftieth-highest population density of any country in the world, eight times that of the US and over twice that of France, so transportation distances are unlikely to be a factor, and a parliamentary report concluded there was no great difference across EU states.

Differences in storage costs are difficult to quantify, since many goods are shipped just in time directly from the manufacturer to the consumer, or in the case of electronic goods and services, they may not be physically shipped at all, but delivered via the Internet.

===Easy conversion===
Simply converting $1 to £1 is one reason for the price increase. For example, Wikipedia donations page asking for donations gives the following options,

US customers: &quot;This year, please consider making a donation of $5, $20, $50 or whatever you can to protect and sustain Wikipedia.&quot;

UK customers: &quot;This year, please consider making a donation of £5, £20, £50 or whatever you can to protect and sustain Wikipedia.&quot;

Discussing why personal computers cost more in the UK than in the US, &quot;New Scientist&quot; stated in 1977 that &quot;the price of an American kit in dollars rapidly translates into the same figure in pounds sterling by the time it has reached the shores of Britain&quot;. This also applies to digital downloads where the price is not a round number and where the costs are the same. &quot;The ever popular method of simply swapping the $ sign for a £ sign sees a monthly subscription to Spotify priced at $9.99 in the US and £9.99 in the UK&quot;, &quot;Which?&quot; magazine stated in 2013.

At its launch, Microsoft Windows Vista had a suggested retail price of $249 (£127) in the United States and £249 ($487) in the United Kingdom. This made it almost twice as expensive to buy in the UK than in the U.S.

==Remedies==

===Shipping from abroad===
Higher prices in the UK often have the effect of encouraging British consumers to order goods from the Internet, whether from UK businesses claiming to break a price cartel or directly from abroad, including via eBay and other online auction sites.

Most American Internet retailers ship directly to consumers in the UK which, assuming customs provisions are met, can provide a worthwhile alternative to higher UK prices. Many believe that competition from the Internet and the Eurozone general free trade will tend to normalize retail prices and put an end the UK being known as &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. However, &quot;customer not present&quot; transactions can generally not be made for legally controlled products such as alcohol, tobacco, solvents, fuels, or medication.

Electrical and electronic products designed for the North American market may have to be converted to run on EU voltage and TV systems, annulling any benefit in reduced prices. Other products may also differ in specification, or they may not come with the same warranties or guarantees, making returning faulty goods difficult, or at least not cost effective. Furthermore, products for sale in the European Union should carry the CE mark for safety, but products purchased in the United States or designed for the US market are often supplied with other safety designations such as the UL listing.

===Internet delivery===
Products and services delivered over the Internet do not face physical barriers for shipping the goods, so one might expect Internet-based markets to normalize across free trading countries.

Apple&#x27;s iTunes Store formerly operated a model in which purchases can only be made in a domain where the users&#x27; means of payment is registered. UK customers were therefore tied to the offerings in the UK iTunes Store, proving a disadvantage both in price and selection. On 9 January 2008, however, Apple conceded that this was unfair practice and promised to harmonise prices with Europe within six months, citing record labels&#x27; wholesale music prices as the reason.

<doc id="867074" wikidata="Q48134" url="?curid=867074" title="Leonid Govorov">
<text>Leonid Aleksandrovich Govorov (; – 19 March 1955) was a Soviet military commander. Trained as an artillery officer, he joined the Red Army in 1920. He graduated from several Soviet military academies, including the Military Academy of Red Army General Staff. He participated in the Winter War of 1939–1940 against Finland as a senior artillery officer.

In World War II, Govorov rose to command an army in November 1941 during the Battle of Moscow. He commanded the Leningrad Front from April 1942 to the end of the war. He reached the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union in 1944, and was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union and many other awards. He was the father of Soviet General Vladimir Govorov.

==Early years and Russian Revolution==
Leonid Aleksandrovich Govorov was born into a peasant family of Russian ethnicity in the village of Butyrki in Vyatka Governorate (now in Kirov Oblast). He attended a technical high school in Yelabuga and enrolled in the shipbuilding department of Petrograd Polytechnical Institute. In December 1916, however, he was mobilized and was sent to the Konstantinovskye Artillery School, from which he graduated in 1917. He became an artillery officer with the rank of podporuchik.

When the Russian Revolution broke out and the Russian Army disintegrated, Govorov returned home, but was conscripted into the White Guard army of Aleksandr Kolchak in October 1918, serving in an artillery battery with the 8th Kama Rifle Division of the 2nd Ufa Army Corps in the Western Army, fighting in the Russian Civil War. Govorov fought in the Spring Offensive of the Russian Army, a general drive westwards by White forces in the east. He deserted in November 1919, fleeing to Tomsk, where he took part in an uprising against White authorities as part of a fighting squad. Govorov joined the Red Army in January 1920, serving in the 51st Rifle Division as an artillery battalion commander. With the division, he fought in the Siege of Perekop in November, during which Soviet forces drove Pyotr Wrangel&#x27;s White Army out of Crimea. Govorov was wounded twice during the year and was awarded the Order of the Red Banner in 1921 for his actions in Crimea.

==Interwar years==
In 1923 he met in Odessa, and later married Lydia Izdebska, the daughter of a former manager of a Polish estate. In 1924 their son Vladimir was born.

Govorov obtained further military education, graduating from the Artillery course in 1926, the Higher Academy course in 1930, and the Frunze Military Academy in 1933. In 1936, Govorov was among the first officers who attended the newly founded Military Academy of Red Army General Staff, from which he graduated in 1938.

From 1936, he was head of artillery in the Kiev Military District. In 1938 he was appointed as lecturer in tactics at the Dzerzhinsky Artillery Academy. In 1939, he finished his first research publication. This was the period of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge. Govorov was close to being arrested, but in the end survived thanks to the intervention of Mikhail Kalinin and continued to rise in rank.

==World War II==
In 1939 the Soviet Union invaded Finland, and Govorov was appointed chief of artillery of the 7th Army, as his research while at Dzerzhinsky Artillery Academy was about assaulting and penetrating fortified enemy positions. He commanded the massive artillery assault that allowed the Soviet breakthrough along the Mannerheim Line in 1940. For this he was awarded the Order of the Red Star and promoted to the rank of division commander. He was then appointed Deputy Inspector-General of Artillery of the Red Army.

After Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Govorov commanded the Artillery on the Western Front in Belarus from August to October 1941. During the Battle of Moscow, he was appointed Chief of Artillery of the 5th Army, under the command of Major General Dmitri Danilovich Lelyushenko. After Lelyushenko was wounded on 18 October Govorov assumed command of the army. During the Soviet counter-offensives in the winter of 1941–42, his army liberated Mozhaisk. As a result, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general of artillery.

===Defense of Leningrad===
In April 1942 Govorov was appointed commander of the Leningrad Group of Forces of the Leningrad Front, which combined the former Leningrad and Volkhov Fronts. In July, the Volkhov Front was re-established, and Govorov became the head of the entire Leningrad Front, replacing Lieutenant General M.S. Khosin. Leningrad had been cut off from the rest of the country since September 1941, and the Soviet forces were trying to lift the siege of Leningrad, which was causing colossal damage to the city and suffering to the civilian population. The Road of Life, which was the only means of supply to the city, was frequently cut by regular German and Finnish air strikes. Despite several German requests Mannerheim decided that Finnish forces would not attack Leningrad. Soviet forces launched several offensives in the region in 1942, but these failed to lift the siege. The Lyuban Offensive Operation resulted in the encirclement and destruction of most of the Soviet 2nd Shock Army. In this situation, Govorov&#x27;s background as an artilleryman was considered most valuable, since the city was under constant shelling, and one of Govorov&#x27;s tasks was to launch an artillery counter-offensive against the German guns.

As soon as he became the commander of the Leningrad Front in July 1942, Govorov mounted local attacks in several sectors of the front, while preparing a much larger offensive. Together with the Volkhov Front, the Leningrad Front would break the blockade of the city by eliminating the German positions south of Ladoga Lake, where only separated the Leningrad and Volkhov Fronts. This position was called &quot;the bottleneck&quot;. At the same time, German forces were planning Operation Northern Light () to capture the city and link up with Finnish forces. To achieve that, heavy reinforcements arrived from Sevastopol, which the German forces had captured in July 1942. Both sides were unaware of the other&#x27;s preparations. As a result, the Soviet Sinyavino Offensive failed and the 2nd Shock army was decimated for the second time in a year, but the German forces suffered heavy casualties and canceled Operation Northern Light.
In late November 1942, Govorov began planning the next operation to break the blockade of Leningrad. In December, the plan was approved by the Stavka and received the codename Operation Iskra (Spark). Operation Iskra began on 13 January 1943, and on 18 January Soviet forces linked up, breaking the blockade. By 22 January the front line stabilized. The operation successfully opened a land corridor 8–10 km wide to the city. A railroad was swiftly built through the corridor that allowed far more supplies to reach the city than the &quot;Road of Life&quot;, eliminating the possibility of the capture of the city and a German-Finnish link up. Govorov was promoted to Colonel General on 15 January and was awarded the Order of Suvorov 1st Class on 28 January.

The Leningrad and Volkhov Fronts tried to follow up their success with a much more ambitious offensive operation named Operation Polyarnaya Zvezda (Polar Star). This operation had the aim of decisively defeating the German Army Group North, but achieved very modest gains. Several other offensives were conducted by Govorov in the area in 1943, slowly expanding the corridor into Leningrad, and making other small gains. In November 1943, Govorov began planning the Leningrad-Novgorod Offensive which would drive Army Group North out of the Leningrad region. On 17 November he was promoted to army general.

===Soviet Counter Offensive===
The Soviet offensive started on 14 January 1944. By 1 March the Leningrad, Volkhov and 2nd Baltic Fronts had driven Army Group North back up to on a front, liberating the southern Leningrad region and part of the Kalinin region. By that time, the reinforced Germans forces were at the &quot;Panther Line&quot;, stretching from Narva to Pskov using Lake Pskov as a barrier, where the offensive was stopped in several heavy battles around Narva. On 18 April the Soviet forces were ordered to the defense, a new 3rd Baltic Front was created to coordinate operations near Narva and Govorov&#x27;s Leningrad Front turned attention to the north. In June 1944, during the Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive, which led to Soviet recapture of Vyborg, Govorov was promoted to the rank of marshal of the Soviet Union. Later his forces recaptured the Baltic states, and in autumn 1944 his forces blocked Army Group North in what became known as Courland Pocket. On 27 January 1945, Govorov was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.

==Post-war career==

In the postwar years Govorov was commander of the Leningrad Military District, and then Chief Inspector of Ground Forces. In 1948 he was appointed Commander of National Air Defence Forces, and in 1952 he also became Deputy Minister of Defence. In these posts he oversaw the modernization of the Soviet air defence system for the age of the jet aircraft and the atomic bomb. But Govorov was by this time suffering from chronic heart disease, and died in March 1955. He was cremated and his ashes in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. A street in St Petersburg is named after him.

<text>Wood&#x27;s metal, also known as Lipowitz&#x27;s alloy or by the commercial names Cerrobend, Bendalloy, Pewtalloy and MCP 158, is a metal alloy that is useful for soldering and making custom metal parts, but its fumes are toxic, as well as being toxic on skin exposure. The alloy is named for Barnabas Wood, who invented and patented the alloy in 1860. It is a eutectic, fusible alloy of 50% bismuth, 26.7% lead, 13.3% tin, and 10% cadmium by mass. It has a melting point of approximately .

==Applications==
Uses include making custom-shaped apertures and blocks (for example, electron-beam cutouts and lung blocks) for medical radiation treatment, and making casts of keys that are hard to otherwise duplicate.

Like other fusible alloys, e.g. Rose&#x27;s metal, Wood&#x27;s metal can be used as a heat-transfer medium in hot baths. Hot baths with Rose&#x27;s and Wood&#x27;s metals are not used routinely but are employed at temperatures above .

At room temperature, Wood&#x27;s metal has a modulus of elasticity of 12.7 GPa and a yield strength of 26.2 MPa.

== Toxicity ==
Wood&#x27;s metal is toxic because it contains lead and cadmium, and contamination of bare skin is considered harmful. Vapour from cadmium-containing alloys is also known to pose a danger to humans. Cadmium poisoning carries the risk of cancer, anosmia (loss of sense of smell), and damage to the liver, kidneys, nerves, bones, and respiratory system. Field&#x27;s metal is a non-toxic alternative.

The dust may form flammable mixtures with air.

<doc id="867081" wikidata="Q4792577" url="?curid=867081" title="Armagh (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Armagh or County Armagh is a former county constituency in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. It was a two-member constituency in Ireland from 1801 to 1885 and a single-member constituency in Northern Ireland from 1922 to 1950. It was replaced in boundary changes in 1983.

==History and boundaries==
County Armagh had been represented by two seats in the Irish House of Commons. From 1 January 1801, when the Acts of Union 1800 came into effect, it was represented by a county constituency with two MPs in the United Kingdom House of Commons. It consisted of County Armagh, except the parts in the parliamentary borough constituencies of Armagh City and Newry. The borough of Charlemont was disfranchised in 1801. The First Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1801 was composed all members of the parliament of Great Britain and members continuing from areas which were enfranchised in Ireland.

Catholics were excluded from taking seats until the enactment of the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829. Under the Parliamentary Elections (Ireland) Act 1829, the traditional county 40 shilling freehold landowning qualification was changed to a £10 qualification (which was an increase to five times the previous level). Before the Representation of the People Act 1884, there was a restrictive property-based franchise. It was not until the householder franchise was introduced for county elections, in the electoral reforms which took effect in 1885, that most (but not all) adult males became voters. In these circumstances, most members of parliament came from a limited number of Protestant aristocratic and gentry families. There were few contested elections.

In the first half-century or so after the union, the constituency was fairly evenly balanced between Whig/Liberal and Tory/Conservative parties. Thereafter the area became more Conservative.

In 1885, under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, it was split into Mid Armagh, North Armagh and South Armagh.

In 1922, following the establishment of the Parliament of Northern Ireland, the number of seats in Northern Ireland at Westminster was cut from 30 to 13 under the Government of Ireland Act 1920. The single-seat constituency of Armagh consisted of the entirety of County Armagh. From its inception, Armagh had a unionist majority, though by the 1970s the nationalist vote was in the mid-30s%. In 1951, it was one of the last four seats to be uncontested in a UK general election, and in 1954 it saw the last uncontested by-election in the UK. In 1974 the Ulster Unionist Party repudiated the Sunningdale Agreement and so did not reselect the pro-Sunningdale MP, John Maginnis. Instead, they ran Harold McCusker, who held the seat until 1983. He was then elected for Upper Bann, which contained part of Armagh.

In 1983 most of the constituency became part of the Newry and Armagh constituency, with part going to Upper Bann.

In two-member elections, the bloc voting system was used. Voters could cast a vote for one or two candidates, as they chose. The two candidates with the largest number of votes were elected.

In by-elections to fill a single seat, the first past the post system applied.

After 1832, when registration of voters was introduced, a turnout figure is given for contested elections. In two-member elections, when the exact number of participating voters is unknown, this is calculated by dividing the number of votes by two. To the extent that voters did not use both their votes this will be an underestimate of turnout. If the electorate figure is unknown the last known electorate figure is used to provide an estimate of turnout.

Where a party had more than one candidate in one or both of a pair of successive elections change is calculated for each individual candidate, otherwise change is based on the party vote.

<text>Eugene Peyton Jarvis is an American game designer and video game programmer, known for producing pinball machines for Williams Electronics and video games for Atari. Most notable among his works are the seminal arcade video games &quot;Defender&quot; and &quot;&quot; in the early 1980s, and the &quot;Cruis&#x27;n&quot; series of racing games for Nintendo in the 1990s. He co-founded Vid Kidz in the early 1980s and currently leads his own development studio, Raw Thrills. In 2008, Eugene Jarvis was named the first Game Designer in Residence by DePaul University&#x27;s Game Development program. His family owns the Jarvis Wines company in Napa, California.

In 2009, he was chosen by IGN as one of the top 100 game creators of all time.

==Early life and education==
Jarvis was born in Palo Alto, California and grew up in Menlo Park. He has an older sister, Diane, and a younger sister, Helen. His first game was chess, which he played as a young child; he was one of the best players at Bellarmine College Preparatory in San Jose. Jarvis&#x27;s first encounter with computers came while he was in high school attending a one-day course on FORTRAN programming given by IBM.
Jarvis originally intended to become a biochemist but decided on studying computers instead. At the University of California, Berkeley, Jarvis did FORTRAN programming on mainframes. At Berkeley he got his first taste of computer gaming, playing &quot;Spacewar!&quot; in the basement of the physics lab. He received his B.S. in EECS in 1976 from Berkeley. In his last days before graduation, he interviewed with Atari, but did not receive a call back.

==Career==
Having an interest in natural language processing, Jarvis was hired by Hewlett-Packard to help create a COBOL compiler. He disliked the boring HP culture and quit after only three days into the six-year project. A few days later, three months after his interview, Atari finally called him back, interested in hiring him. He joined them and started programming some of the first pinball games that used microprocessors. &quot;I never quite understood why Atari got into the pinball business. They had this groundbreaking idea in video games, which at the time had far fewer parts and pieces, were far more reliable, and thus much less expensive to produce, yet they were putting time and money into pinball. It was kind of a mess,&quot; said Jarvis. Atari&#x27;s pinball development branch failed a few years later, so he moved to Chicago to continue programming pinball games for Williams Electronics.

===Video arcade games===
As Jarvis worked on pinball games at Williams in the late 1970s, &quot;Space Invaders&quot; was released, sparking great interest in microprocessor-based video games. Jarvis wanted to try making a video game. When thinking of design ideas with famed pinball designer Steve Ritchie, they developed the concept for &quot;Defender&quot; – a side-scroller with the player flying over the surface of a planet. &quot;Defender&quot; (1980) was Jarvis&#x27;s first video game and turned out to be a huge hit, becoming one of the highest grossing video games from the golden age of arcade games. Williams expanded greatly with the success of &quot;Defender&quot;, but Jarvis left to found an independent game development firm called Vid Kidz with Larry DeMar in February 1981. After four months of tag-team programming between DeMar and Jarvis, they produced Vid Kidz&#x27;s first game: &quot;Stargate&quot; (1981), an enhanced sequel to &quot;Defender&quot; that they sold to Williams.

Jarvis&#x27;s next hit with Vid Kidz was the high-action game &quot;Robotron&quot;, which was produced by Williams in 1982. It took 6 months to develop. He then designed &quot;Blaster&quot;, a sort-of &quot;Robotron&quot; sequel set in 2085 — after the robots destroyed humanity — but with different, 3D gameplay. Though a marvel to look at, &quot;Blaster&quot; was not quite as successful or remembered as his previous video games. The video game crash of 1983 hit Williams hard, forcing them to cut back and revert to much of their pre-&quot;Defender&quot; business. Jarvis left Vid Kidz in 1984 to attend Stanford University, where he gained an MBA in 1986. He continued making games, designing &quot;Narc&quot; (1989) and helping develop &quot;Smash TV&quot; (1990), which drew comparisons to &quot;Robotron&quot;.

The next big leap for Jarvis was 3D. He had been interested in virtual reality since attending Berkeley in the 1970s. He and a group of others left Midway (which Williams had purchased in 1988) to experiment with VR, but disappointingly came to the realization that VR headsets were not catching on. They did find potential in multi-screen cockpit simulators though. He helped create 3D texture mapping hardware which ended up being used in his &quot;Cruis&#x27;n&quot; series of games.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; listed Jarvis in their &quot;75 Most Important People in the Games Industry of 1995&quot;, both for the massive success of &quot;Defender&quot; and for &quot;Cruis&#x27;n USA&quot;, which they said is &quot;arguably neck-and-neck with &quot;Daytona USA&quot; as the most popular driving game of 1994.&quot;

He works for his own studio, Raw Thrills Inc., and his more recent work has returned him to the coin-op arcade game world with &quot;&quot;, a first-person perspective shooting game based on the &quot;war on terror&quot;, introduced in spring 2004. The second game from his studio, &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; debuted that fall along with the &quot;&quot; update kit. Since the release of &quot;Target Terror&quot;, the company has experienced strong growth, developing or releasing titles including Nicktoons Nitro, Guitar Hero Arcade, H2Overdrive, the Big Buck series of games and Jurassic Park Arcade among others.

In 2006, Raw Thrills purchased game developer Play Mechanix which is led by his friend George Petro. Together the two companies have developed arcade and video redemption games for ICE and Bandai Namco Amusements America.

In 2008, Jarvis was named DePaul University&#x27;s first Game Designer in Residence. His involvement at DePaul&#x27;s Game Development program includes lectures, supervision of game projects, and input on curriculum. He was recognized as the NY-AMOA Man of the Year in 2009 and he received the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences Pioneer Award in 2013.

Jarvis is the only video game designer to have his work featured on a U.S. postage stamp two 1980&#x27;s era children are depicted playing &quot;Defender&quot; on the video games stamp for the &quot;Celebrate the Century&quot; series. He also appeared in a cameo on the TV series &quot;NewsRadio&quot; (in the 3rd-season episode &quot;Arcade&quot;) as &quot;Delivery Man #3&quot;, a character who delivers a distracting arcade video game machine to the office. That arcade game is his own creation &quot;Stargate&quot;, which within the episode is called &quot;Stargate Defender&quot; and is described as being about &quot;saving the humanoids&quot; while avoiding the &quot;Yllabian Space Guppies&quot;.

In 2018, &quot;Defender&quot; was included in the Chicago New Media 1973-1992 exhibition, that was curated by Jon Cates.

In 2022, Jarvis and his wife, Sasha Gerritson, gifted DePaul the university&#x27;s largest ever gift, in support of the institution&#x27;s College of Computing and Digital Media. In recognition of the couple&#x27;s generosity and dedicated leadership, the college has been renamed the Eugene P. Jarvis College of Computing and Digital Media.

<doc id="867089" wikidata="Q675176" url="?curid=867089" title="Galinstan">
<text>Galinstan is a brand name for an alloy composed of gallium, indium, and tin which melts at and is thus liquid at room temperature. In scientific literature, galinstan is also used to denote the eutectic alloy of gallium, indium, and tin, which melts at around . The commercial product Galinstan is not a eutectic alloy, but a near eutectic alloy. Additionally, it likely has added flux to improve flowability, to reduce melting temperature, and to reduce surface tension.

Eutectic galinstan is composed of 68.5%Ga, 21.5%In, and 10.0%Sn (by weight).

Due to the low toxicity and low reactivity of its component metals, galinstan has replaced the toxic liquid mercury or the reactive alloy NaK in many applications.

==Name==
The name &quot;galinstan&quot; is a portmanteau of gallium, indium, and stannum (Latin for &quot;tin&quot;). The brand name &quot;Galinstan&quot; is a registered trademark of the German company .

==Physical properties==
*Boiling point: &gt;1300°C
*Vapour pressure: &lt;10−8Torr (at 500°C)
*Solubility: Insoluble in water or organic solvents
*Viscosity: 0.0024Pa·s (at 20°C)
*Thermal conductivity: 16.5W·m−1·K−1
*Electrical conductivity: 3.46×106 S/m (at 20°C)
*Surface tension: &quot;s&quot; = 0.535–0.718 N/m (at 20°C, dependent on producer)

In the presence of oxygen at concentrations above 1 ppm, the surface of bulk galinstan oxidizes to Ga2O3. Unlike mercury, galinstan tends to wet and adheres to many materials, including glass, due to its surface oxide. This can limit its use as a direct replacement material in some situations, but can also be utilized in some situations.

==Uses==

Galinstan can replace mercury in thermometers at moderate temperatures.

Galinstan has higher reflectivity and lower density than mercury. In astronomy, it can replace mercury in liquid-mirror telescopes.

Metals or alloys like galinstan that are liquids at room temperature are often used by overclockers and enthusiasts as a thermal interface for computer hardware cooling, where their higher thermal conductivity compared to thermal pastes and thermal epoxies can allow slightly higher clock speeds and CPU processing power achieved in demonstrations and competitive overclocking. Two examples are &quot;Thermal Grizzly Conductonaut&quot; and &quot;Coolaboratory Liquid Ultra&quot;, with thermal conductivities of 73 and 38.4 W/mK respectively. Unlike ordinary thermal compounds which are easy to apply and present a low risk of damaging hardware, galinstan is electrically conductive and causes liquid metal embrittlement in many metals including aluminum which is commonly used in heatsinks. Despite these challenges the users who are successful with their application do report good results. In August 2020, Sony Interactive Entertainment patented a galinstan-based thermal interface solution suitable for mass production, for use on the PlayStation 5.

Galinstan is difficult to use for cooling fission-based nuclear reactors, because indium has a high absorption cross section for thermal neutrons, efficiently absorbing them and inhibiting the fission reaction. Conversely, it is being investigated as a possible coolant for fusion reactors. Its nonreactivity makes it safer than other liquid metals, such as lithium and mercury.

The wetting characteristics of galinstan can be utilized to fabricate conductive patterns, allowing it to be used as a liquid, deformable conductor in soft robotics and stretchable electronics. Galinstan can be used to replace wires, interconnects, and electrodes as well as the conductive element in inductor coils and dielectric composites for soft capacitors.

===X-ray equipment===

Extremely high-intensity sources may be obtained with an X-ray source that uses a liquid-metal galinstan anode of 9.25 keV X-rays (gallium K-alpha line) for X-ray phase microscopy of fixed tissue (such as mouse brain), from a focal spot about 10 μm × 10 μm, and 3-D voxels of about one cubic micrometer. The metal flows from a nozzle downward at a high speed, and the high-intensity electron source is focused upon it. The rapid flow of metal carries current, but the physical flow prevents a great deal of anode heating (due to forced-convective heat removal), and the high boiling point of galinstan inhibits vaporization of the anode.

<doc id="867101" wikidata="Q72345" url="?curid=867101" title="Joachim Kroll">
<text>Joachim Georg Kroll (17 April 1933 – 1 July 1991) was a German serial killer, child molester, necrophile and cannibal who murdered a minimum of eight women and young girls in the Ruhr metropolitan region from 1955 until his arrest on 3 July 1976. He was convicted of eight murders and one attempted murder but confessed to a total of 14. He was sentenced to life imprisonment on 8 April 1982.

== Early life ==
Born on 17 April 1933 as the son of a miner in Hindenburg (Zabrze), Upper Silesia, Kroll was the sixth of nine children. After the end of World War II, during which his father was a prisoner of war, Kroll&#x27;s family moved to North Rhine-Westphalia.

== Crimes ==
He began killing in 1955 after his mother died. Around 1960, Kroll went to Duisburg and found work as a toilet attendant for Mannesmann. Afterwards, he worked for Thyssen Industries and moved to Friesenstrasse 24, Laar, a district of Duisburg. At that time he resumed killing people.

=== List of victims ===
* 8 February 1955 – Irmgard Strehl, 19, raped and stabbed to death. Her disembowelled body was found in a barn in Lüdinghausen.
* 3 March 1956 – Erika Schuletter, 12, raped and strangled in Kirchhellen which is now part of Bottrop.
* 16 June 1959 – Klara Frieda Tesmer, 24, murdered in the meadows of the Rhine, near Rheinhausen. A mechanic, Heinrich Ott, was arrested for the crime. He hanged himself in jail.
* 26 July 1959 – Manuela Knodt, 16, raped and strangled in the City Park of Essen. Slices of flesh were carved from her buttocks and thighs.
* 23 April 1962 – Petra Giese, 13, raped and strangled in Dinslaken-Bruckhausen. Vinzenz Kuehn was arrested and convicted.
* 4 June 1962 – Monika Tafel, 12, killed in Walsum, slices of flesh carved from her buttocks. Walter Quicker was arrested for the crime. He was later released but was driven by neighbours to suicide in October.
* 3 September 1962 – Barbara Bruder, 12, abducted in Burscheid. Her body was never found.
* 22 August 1965 – Hermann Schmitz, 25, and his girlfriend Marion Veen were attacked as they sat in a car in a lover&#x27;s lane in Duisburg-Großenbaum. Hermann—Kroll&#x27;s only male victim—was killed, but Veen escaped.
* 13 September 1966 – Ursula Rohling, 20, strangled in Foersterbusch Park near Marl. Her boyfriend Adolf Schickel committed suicide after being falsely accused of the crime.
* 22 December 1966 – Ilona Harke, aged 5, raped and drowned in a ditch in Wuppertal.
* 12 July 1969 – Maria Hettgen, 61, raped and strangled at Hückeswagen.
* 21 May 1970 – Jutta Rahn, 13, strangled while walking home from a train station. Peter Schay was arrested and eventually released. He confessed to the crime in 1976 after being hounded by his neighbours.
* 8 May 1976 – Karin Toepfer, 10, raped and strangled in Voerde.
* 3 July 1976 – Marion Ketter, 4. Parts of her body were in the process of being simmered when Kroll was arrested.

=== Method ===
Kroll was very particular about where he killed, only killing in the same place on a few occasions years apart. This, and the fact that there were a number of other killers operating in the area at the time, helped him to evade capture. Kroll would surprise his victims and strangle them quickly. Afterwards, he would strip the body and have intercourse with it, often masturbating over it again. He would then mutilate and cut off pieces to be eaten later. Upon returning home, he would have intercourse again with a rubber sex doll he had for this purpose.

=== Arrest ===
On 3 July 1976, Kroll was arrested for kidnapping and killing a four-year-old girl named Marion Ketter. As police went from home to home, a neighbour approached a policeman and told him that the waste pipe in his apartment building had been blocked up, and when he had asked his neighbour, Kroll, whether he knew what had been blocking the pipe, Kroll had simply replied, &quot;guts&quot;. Upon this report, the police went up to Kroll&#x27;s apartment and found the body of Marion Ketter cut up: some parts were in the refrigerator, a small hand was cooking in a pan of boiling water and the entrails were found stuck in the waste pipe. Kroll was immediately arrested.

=== Trial and death ===
He admitted killing Marion Ketter and gave details of 13 other murders and one attempted murder over the previous two decades.

Kroll said that he often sliced portions of flesh from his victims to cook and eat them, claiming that he did this to save on his grocery bills. In custody, he believed that he was going to get a simple operation to cure him of his homicidal urges and would then be released from prison. Instead, he was charged with eight murders and one attempted murder. In April 1982, after a 151-day trial, he was convicted on all counts and was given a life sentence.

He died of a heart attack in 1991 in the prison of Rheinbach.

<text>Ghislenghien (; ) is a small town of Wallonia and a district of the municipality of Ath, located in the province of Hainaut, Belgium. It has about 3000 inhabitants.

==Gas explosion==
On 30 July 2004 a high-pressure natural gas pipeline operated at a pressure of 70 bar ruptured following recent third party damage. 24 people died as a result and 150 survivors were hospitalised, most with severe burns.

It is thought that damage to the pipeline occurred during the final stages of a car park construction project. Notice of the work had been given to the pipeline operator, Fluxys, and one of their operatives had regularly attended the site through the course of the project. Damage to the pipeline probably occurred as a mechanical soil stabiliser was driven over it or near by. This resulted in several evenly spaced (but not full depth) gouges in the steel wall of the pipeline. Two weeks after the completion of the car park gas pressure was increased in the pipeline, which then ruptured with the fault centred on a 350 mm long gouge. Other contributing factors to the accident may have been a reduced cover over the pipeline as a result of levelling, the way information was passed down the sub-contracting chain to workers and the frequency and adequacy of supervision by the pipeline operator at the site.

<text>Londonderry was a parliamentary constituency in Northern Ireland represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament, as well as a constituency in elections to various regional bodies. It was replaced in boundary changes in 1983. Londonderry returned two MPs (1801–1885) and later one (1922–1983).

==Boundaries==
The constituency consisted, in 1801–1885, of the whole of County Londonderry, except for the parliamentary boroughs of Coleraine and Londonderry City.

The seat was re-created in 1922. As part of the consequences of the devolved Stormont Parliament for Northern Ireland, the number of MPs in the Westminster Parliament was drastically cut. The seat was focused on County Londonderry. It comprised the administrative county of Londonderry and the County Borough of Londonderry.

In 1951, it was one of the last four seats to be uncontested in a United Kingdom general election.

In 1983 the number of seats for Northern Ireland was increased from 12 to 17 and Londonderry was split in two, forming Foyle and East Londonderry.

==Politics and history of the constituency==
From its inception Londonderry had a unionist majority, though by the 1970s the nationalist vote was approaching 40% in some elections.

In 1974 the Ulster Unionist Party repudiated the Sunningdale Agreement and so did not reselect Robin Chichester-Clark, who had been a Minister in the government of Edward Heath. Instead they ran William Ross, who held the seat until 1983. He was then elected for the new East Londonderry.

For the history of the area post 1983, please see Foyle (UK Parliament constituency) and East Londonderry.

<text>Low power may refer to:
* Radio transmitters that send out relatively little power:
** QRP operation, using &quot;the minimum power necessary to carry out the desired communications&quot;, in amateur radio.
** Cognitive radio transceivers typically automatically reduce the transmitted power to much less than the power required for reliable one-way broadcasts.
** Low-power broadcasting that the power of the broadcast is less, i.e. the radio waves are not intended to travel as far as from typical transmitters. 
** Low-power communication device, a radio transmitter used in low-power broadcasting.
* Low-power electronics, the consumption of electric power is deliberately low, e.g. notebook processors.
* Power (statistics), in which low power is due to small sample sizes or poorly designed experiments

<text>HP OpenView is the former name for a Hewlett-Packard product family that consisted of network and systems management products. In 2007, HP OpenView was rebranded as HP BTO (&quot;Business Technology Optimization&quot;) Software when it became part of the HP Software Division. The products were available as various HP products, marketed through the HP Software Division. HP Software became part of HPE after the HP/HPE split and HPE Software was eventually sold to MicroFocus.

HP OpenView software provided large-scale system and network management of an organization&#x27;s IT infrastructure. It included optional modules from HP as well as third-party management software, which connected within a common framework and communicated with one another.

==History==
The foundational OpenView product was Network Node Manager (NNM), network monitoring software based on SNMP. NNM was used to manage networks and could be used in conjunction with other management software, such as CiscoWorks.

In April 2004, HP bought Novadigm and its Radia suite. In December 2005, it acquired Peregrine Systems with its IT asset and service management software and integrated it into HP OpenView. In November 2006, HP completed its purchase of Mercury Interactive Corp., subsequently integrated Mercury application and software life-cycle management products (QualityCenter, LoadRunner/PerformanceCenter, WinRunner/QTP) into the HP Software &amp; Solutions portfolio. In September 2007, HP acquired Opsware.

In early 2007, alongside the integration of Mercury Interactive, Peregrine Systems and Opsware products, HP OpenView products were rebranded under the HP Software Division business, and the OpenView and Mercury names were phased out. The HP OpenCall name continued as part of the HP Software Division business. HP Software became part of HPE after the HP/HPE split and HPE Software was eventually sold to MicroFocus.

<text>Olive Ann Oatman (September 7, 1837March 21, 1903) was a White American woman who was enslaved and later released by Native Americans in the Mojave Desert region when she was a teenager. She later lectured about her experiences.

On March 18, 1851, while emigrating from Illinois to the confluence of the Colorado River and the Gila River (in modern-day Yuma, Arizona), her family was attacked by a small group from a Native American tribe. Though she identified them as Apache, they were most likely Tolkepayas (Western Yavapai). They killed her parents and 4 siblings, left her older brother Lorenzo Dow Oatman (1836–1901) for dead, and enslaved Olive and her younger sister Mary Ann, holding them as slaves for one year before they traded them to the Mohave people. While Lorenzo exhaustively attempted to recruit governmental help in searching for them, Mary Ann died from starvation and Olive spent four years with the Mohave.

Five years after the attack, she was repatriated into American society. The story of the Oatman Massacre began to be retold with dramatic license in the press, as well as in her own memoir and speeches. Novels, plays, movies, and poetry were inspired, which resonated in the media of the time and long afterward. She had become an oddity in 1860s America, partly because of the prominent blue tattooing of her chin by the Mohave, making her the first known White woman with Native tattoo on record. Much of what actually occurred during her time with the Native Americans remains unknown.

==Early life==
Olive was born the third of seven children to Royce Boise Oatman (1809-1851) and Mary Ann Sperry Oatman (1813-1851) in La Harpe, Hancock County, Illinois. In 1839, her parents left the Methodist church and joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) under the leadership of Joseph Smith. After Smith was killed in June 1844, the Oatmans chose to affiliate with the Mormon splinter-group called the Brewsterites (which was founded in 1848 by James C. Brewster) instead of staying with the main body of Mormons under the leadership of Brigham Young.

On August 5, 1850, the Brewsterites (including the Oatmans) left their encampment near Independence, Missouri as a wagon train with 93 people and 24 wagons headed to the confluence of the Colorado River and the Gila River in modern-day Yuma, Arizona. There, Brewster claimed was the &quot;intended place of gathering&quot; for The Church of Christ followers. Dissension caused the group to split near Santa Fe in New Mexico Territory with Brewster following the northern route. Royce Oatman and several other families chose the southern route via Socorro and Tucson. Near Socorro, Royce Oatman assumed command of the party. They reached New Mexico Territory early in 1851 only to find the country and climate wholly unsuited to their purpose. The other wagons gradually abandoned the goal of reaching the Colorado River.

When the party reached Maricopa Wells (20 miles south of modern-day Phoenix, Arizona), they were told that the Gila Trail (Southern Emigration Route) to the west was barren, dangerous, and frequented by hostile Native Americans. They were warned that they would risk their lives if they proceeded further. While the other families resolved to stay in Maricopa Wells, the Oatmans chose to continue their westward journey.

==The Oatman Massacre==
The Oatman family, traveling alone, was nearly annihilated in what became known as the &quot;Oatman Massacre&quot; on the banks of the Gila River 84 miles east of modern-day Yuma, Arizona.
The seven Oatman children ranged in age from one to 17 years old, the eldest being Lucy Oatman. Mary Ann was 8 months pregnant with their eighth child. On the Oatmans&#x27; fourth day out from Maricopa Wells, they were approached by a group of nineteen Native Americans who were asking for tobacco and food. Due to the lack of supplies, Royce Oatman was hesitant to share too much with the small party of Yavapais. They became irate at his stinginess. During the encounter, the Yavapais attacked the Oatman family. The Yavapais clubbed the family to death. All were killed except for three of the children: 15-year-old Lorenzo, who was left for dead, while 14-year-old Olive and 7-year-old Mary Ann were taken to be slaves for the Yavapais.

After the attack, Lorenzo awoke to find his parents and siblings dead, but he saw no sign of little Mary Ann or Olive. Lorenzo attempted the hazardous trek to find help. He eventually reached a settlement, where his wounds were treated. Lorenzo rejoined the emigrant train, and three days later returned to the bodies of his slain family. In a detailed retelling which was reprinted in newspapers over the decades, he said, &quot;We buried the bodies of father, mother and babe in one common grave.&quot; The men had no way of digging proper graves in the volcanic rocky soil, so they gathered the bodies together and formed a cairn over them. It has been said the remains were reburied several times and finally moved to the river for re-interment by early Arizona colonizer Charles Poston. Lorenzo Oatman became determined to never give up the search for his only surviving siblings.

==Captivity and conversion==
After the attack, the Native Americans took some of the Oatman family&#x27;s belongings, along with Olive and Mary Ann. Although Olive Oatman later identified her captors as members of the Tonto Apache tribe, they were probably of the Tolkepaya tribe (Western Yavapais) living in a village southwest of Aguila, Arizona, in the Harquahala Mountains. After arriving at the village, the girls were initially treated in a way that appeared threatening, and Oatman later said she thought they would be killed. However, the girls were used as slaves to forage for food, to lug water and firewood, and for other menial tasks.

During the girls&#x27; stay with the Yavapais, another group of Native Americans came to trade with the tribe. This group was made up of Mohave Native Americans. The daughter of the Mohave Chief Espaniole saw the girls and their poor treatment during a trading expedition. She tried to make a trade for the girls. The Yavapais refused, but the chief&#x27;s daughter, Topeka, was persistent and returned once more offering a trade for the girls. Eventually the Yavapais gave in and traded the girls for two horses, some vegetables, blankets, and beads. After being taken into Mohave custody, the girls walked for days to a Mohave village along the Colorado River (in the center of what today is Needles, California). They were immediately taken in by the family of a tribal leader (kohot) whose non-Mohave name was Espaniole. The Mohave tribe was more prosperous than the group that had held the girls captive, and both Espaniole&#x27;s wife, Aespaneo, and daughter, Topeka, took an interest in the Oatman girls&#x27; welfare. Oatman expressed her deep affection for these two women numerous times over the years after her captivity.

Aespaneo arranged for the Oatman girls to be given plots of land to farm. A Mohave tribesman, Llewelyn Barrackman, said in an interview that Olive was most likely fully adopted into the tribe because she was given a Mohave nickname, something only presented to those who have fully assimilated into the tribe. Olive herself would later claim that she and Mary Ann were held captive by the Mohave and that she feared to leave, but this statement could have been colored by the Reverend Royal Byron Stratton, who sponsored the publication of Olive&#x27;s captivity narrative shortly after her return to White society. For example, Olive did not attempt to contact a large group of whites that visited the Mohaves during her period with them, and years later she went to meet with a Mohave leader, Irataba, in New York City and spoke with him of old times.

Anthropologist Alfred L. Kroeber wrote in an article about the Oatman captivity: &quot;The Mohaves always told her she could go to the white settlements when she pleased but they dared not go with her, fearing they might be punished for having kept a white woman so long among them, nor did they dare to let it be known that she was among them&quot;.

Another thing that suggests Olive and Mary Ann were not held in forced captivity by the Mohave is that both girls were tattooed on their chins and arms, in keeping with the tribal custom. Oatman later claimed (in Stratton&#x27;s book and in her lectures) that she was tattooed to mark her as a slave, but this is not consistent with the Mohave tradition, where such marks were given only to their own people to ensure that they would enter the land of the dead and be recognized there by their ancestors as members of the Mohave tribe. The tribe did not care if their slaves could reach the land of the dead, however, so they did not tattoo them. It has also been suggested that the evenness of Olive&#x27;s facial markings may indicate her compliance with the procedure.

Olive Oatman&#x27;s 1860s lecture notes tell of her younger sister often yearning to join that better &quot;world&quot; where their &quot;Father and Mother&quot; had gone. Mary Ann died of starvation while the girls were living with the Mohave. This happened in about 1855–56, when Mary Ann was ten or eleven. It has been claimed that there was a drought in the region, and that the tribe experienced a dire shortage of food supplies, and Olive herself would have died had not Aespaneo, the matriarch of the tribe, saved her life by making a gruel to sustain her.

Olive later spoke with fondness of the Mohaves, who she said treated her better than her first captors. She most likely considered herself assimilated. She was given a clan name, Oach, and a nickname, Spantsa, a Mohave word having to do with unquenchable lust or thirst. She chose not to reveal herself to white railroad surveyors who spent nearly a week in the Mohave Valley trading and socializing with the tribe in February 1854. Because she did not know that Lorenzo had survived the massacre, she believed she had no immediate family, and the Mohave treated her as one of their own.

==Release==
When Olive was 19 years old, Francisco, a Yuma Indian messenger, arrived at the village with a message from the authorities at Fort Yuma. Rumors suggested that a white girl was living with the Mohaves, and the post commander requested her return, or to know the reason why she did not choose to return. The Mohaves initially sequestered Olive and resisted the request. At first they denied that Olive was even white. Over the course of negotiations some expressed their affection for Olive, others their fear of reprisal from whites. The messenger Francisco, meanwhile, withdrew to the homes of other nearby Mohaves; shortly thereafter he made a second fervent attempt to persuade the Mohaves to part with Olive. Trade items were included this time, including blankets and a white horse, and he passed on threats that the whites would destroy the Mohaves if they did not release Olive.

After some discussion, in which Olive was this time included, the Mohaves decided to accept these terms, and Olive was escorted to Fort Yuma in a 20-day journey. Topeka (the daughter of Espianola/Espanesay and Aespaneo) went on the journey with her. Before entering the fort, Olive was given Western clothing lent by the wife of an army officer, as she was clad in a traditional Mohave skirt with no covering above her waist. Inside the fort, Olive was surrounded by cheering people.

Olive&#x27;s childhood friend Susan Thompson, whom she befriended again at this time, stated many years later that she believed Olive was &quot;grieving&quot; upon her forced return because she had been married to a Mohave man and had given birth to two boys.

Olive, however, denied rumors during her lifetime that she either had been married to a Mohave or had been sexually mistreated by the Yavapai or Mohave. In Stratton&#x27;s book, she declared that &quot;to the honor of these savages let it be said, they never offered the least unchaste abuse to me.&quot; However, her nickname, Spantsa, may have meant &quot;rotten womb&quot; and implied that she was sexually active, although historians have argued that the name could have different meanings.

Within a few days of her arrival at the fort, Olive discovered that her brother Lorenzo was alive and had been looking for her and Mary Ann. Their meeting made headline news across the West.

==Later life==
In 1857, a pastor named Royal Byron Stratton sought out Olive and Lorenzo Oatman. He co-wrote a book about the Oatman Massacre and the girls&#x27; captivity titled &quot;Life among the Indians: or, The Captivity of the Oatman Girls Among the Apache &amp; Mohave Indians&quot;. It was a bestseller for that era, at 30,000 copies. Stratton used the royalties from the book to pay for Olive and her brother Lorenzo to attend the University of the Pacific (1857). Olive and Lorenzo accompanied Stratton across the country on a book tour, promoting the book and lecturing in book circuits. Olive was a curiosity. Her boldly tattooed chin was on display and people came to hear her story and witness the blue tattoo for themselves. She was the first known tattooed White American woman as well as one of the first female public speakers. Olive entered the lecture circuit as feminism was developing. Though she herself never claimed to be part of the movement, her story entered the American consciousness shortly after the Seneca Falls Convention.

Both Oatman and Mary Brown, Sallie Fox&#x27;s mother and Rose–Baley Party survivor, lived in San Jose, California, at the same time. Mary Brown refused a meeting.

Oatman married John Brant Fairchild (1830-1907) on November 9, 1865 in Rochester, New York. They met at a lecture she was giving alongside Stratton in Michigan. Fairchild was a wealthy rancher who had lost his brother to an attack by Native Americans during a cattle drive in Arizona in 1854, the same time Oatman was living among the Mohave. Stratton did not receive an invitation to the wedding, and Olive never reached out to him again. Stratton became institutionalized after the development of hereditary insanity and died in 1875.

Olive and John Fairchild moved to Sherman, Texas, a boom town ripe for a businessman like Fairchild to start a new and prosperous life. Fairchild founded the City Bank of Sherman and together they lived quietly in a large Victorian mansion. Olive began wearing a veil to cover her famous tattoo and became involved in charity work. She was particularly interested in helping a local orphanage. She and Fairchild never had their own children, but they did adopt a little girl and named her Mary Elizabeth after their mothers, nicknaming her Mamie. Her husband went on to track down copies of Stratton&#x27;s book and burn them.

Her brother Lorenzo died on October 8, 1901. She outlived him by fewer than 2 years. Olive Oatman Fairchild died of a heart attack on March 20, 1903, at the age of 65. She is buried at the West Hill Cemetery in Sherman, Texas.

== Legacy ==
The town of Oatman, Arizona, located near her release site, was named in her honor in 1915. It was part of the Oatman Gold District. The once thriving gold rush town is now a tourist stop.

Named in her honor, the historic town of Olive City, Arizona, near the present town of Ehrenberg, was a steamboat stop on the Colorado River during the gold rush days. Other namesakes in Arizona are Oatman Mountain and the adjacent Oatman Flat. Oatman Flat Station was a stage stop for the Butterfield Overland Mail from 1858 to 1861.

== In popular culture ==

=== Television and film ===
*The character of Eva Oates, portrayed by Robin McLeavy in the AMC television series &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot; is very loosely based on Oatman. Outside of being captured by a group of Native Americans, bearing the distinctive blue chin tattoo, and having been raised Mormon, there are very few similarities between the character of Eva and the actual life of Oatman.

*In an episode of the series &quot;The Ghost Inside My Child: The Wild West and Tribal Quest&quot;, a southern American Baptist family claims that their daughter Olivia says she is the reincarnation of Olive Oatman.

*A 1965 episode of the TV series Death Valley Days starring Ronald Reagan recounts the story of Olive Oatman and features her brother Lorenzo&#x27;s search for her. In this episode he finds her with the Mojave but she doesn&#x27;t want to leave. Episode title: “The Lawless Have Laws.” https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0556827/

<text>Rasht (; ) is a city in the Central District of Rasht County, Gilan province, Iran, serving as the capital of the province, the county, and the district. The city is also known as the &quot;City of Rain&quot; (, ) and, with a population of 679,995 in 2016, is the most populous city in northern Iran.

Rasht is the largest city on Iran&#x27;s Caspian Sea coast. Due to being between the coast and the mountains, the local environment is rainy with a humid subtropical climate. It also has a temperate rainforest to its south, contrasting the mostly arid Iran.

It is a major trade center between Caucasia, Russia, and Iran, using the port of Bandar-e Anzali. Rasht is also a major tourist center with the resort of Masouleh in the adjacent mountains and the beaches of Caspian as some of the major attractions.

Historically, Rasht was a major transport and business center which connected Iran to Russia and the rest of Europe, and because of this was known as the &quot;Gate of Europe&quot;. The city has a history that goes back to the 13th century but its modern history dates back to the Safavid era during which Rasht was a major silk trade center with numerous textile workshops. In 2015, this city joined the network of creative cities of the world as a creative gastronomy city under the supervision of UNESCO.

Some of the famous neighbourhoods of Rasht include Golsar, Safsar, Kordmahaleh and Khamiran.

==Etymology==
There are multiple views about the city&#x27;s name:
==History==

===Timeline===
*682: Rasht was first mentioned in Umayyad historical documents.
*1669: Stenka Razin, a Cossack warlord, plundered the city.
*1714: Rasht destroyed by earthquake.
*1722–1732: Occupation by the Russians due to the Russo-Persian War.
*1901: A major epidemic plague devastates the city.
*1917–1920: The Russian and British armed forces fight in the port city of Bandar-e Anzali and Rasht. The British retreat and the Russians occupy the area.
*1920–1921: The short-lived Gilan Soviet Socialist Republic was established with its capital in Rasht.
*1937: A revolt, sparked by the desire to collect a &quot;road tax&quot; from the Russians, was suppressed.
*1974: First university established in Rasht.

Rasht was first mentioned in Umayyad historical documents in 682 CE. It has seen the Sassanid era, the Rashidun conquest, the armies of Peter the Great and later Russian rulers, and British colonialism. The people of Rasht also played a major role in the Constitutional Revolution of Iran.

Rasht has, along with regions around Tabriz and Tehran, one of the earliest industry plants during the last quarter of the 19th century, prominently in fields such as fishing, caviar production, the Caspian sea oil pipeline construction and textiles. During the 20th century, until the mid-70s, Gilan and the Rasht region was the third-ranking industrial city in Iran by number of workers and per capita productivity. It lost its cultural and industrial status to a large extent after the 1970s.

The people of Rasht played a prominent role in instigation and radicalization of the Persian Constitutional Revolution (1905–1907). Rasht is the birthplace of Mīrzā Kūchak Khān, one of the leading figures of the Constitutional Revolution. His own movement in Gilan, which went by the name of Jangalis, represented a pro-modern and social democratic program for reformation of Muslim rituals and traditions. Mirza established the short-lived Persian Socialist Soviet Republic in 1920 after the defeat of the constitutional forces and in coalition with Iranian communists.

The republic had the support of the newly established Russian Red Army. The Soviet Government, after a turn of military and political strategy proposed by Trotsky, withdrew its support and the republic itself was tormented by the inner conflicts between the newly established Iranian Communist Party (1919) and the Jangalis and other factions. The republic was finally defeated by the Iranian army under the command of Reza Shah.

The first national library of Iran was established in Rasht under the Qajar dynasty. &quot;Nasim-e-Shomal&quot;, the first modern newspaper of Iran after the constitutional revolution, has been initially published in Rasht. First Public Library of Iran was built in Rasht City. First Branch of the First Iranian Bank (Sepah Bank) was located in Rasht City. First branch of 24/7 pharmacy (Karoon pharmacy) was built in Rasht City. First school for girls and first fire station in Iran were also built in Rasht City. The city of Rasht was the center of Gilan and the center of the first province of the country.

During the Qajar period, along with economic development between Iran and Russia, Noghan trade and other products expanded. Thus, Rasht became the gateway to Europe in the 19th century. , a Russian orientalist and writer who visited Rasht at the end of 1860, wrote in his published notes that the city at that time had 5463 houses, 1021 shops, 22 mosques, 34 schools and 17 bathhouses, and a population of 27,314. At that time, Rasht&#x27;s political credibility was such that the Russian, British, and Ottoman governments had consulates in Rasht.

===Modern day===
Rasht is turning into an industrialized town like most of the Iranian large cities and province capitals. Enjoying the Kadus International Hotel and hundreds of tourist attractions, Rasht receives thousands of foreign tourists annually, mostly from Austria, Germany, Netherlands, France, Australia, Japan and African countries like Senegal and Cameroon as well as countries from Oceania like Micronesia.

Rasht is known for its famous municipal building, located in the Square of Municipality, which was constructed circa 1900, and has been renovated each year. Due to the high amount of humidity in Rasht which damages and destroys the aged buildings, the native, older architectural texture of Rasht is gradually being replaced with the modern skyscrapers and apartments.

The culture of consumerism is prevalent among the people of Rasht as a cultural and urban center which is historically engaged in close commercial and political ties with the United Kingdom, Russia and France. Due to this background which makes the inhabitants much familiar with the industrial, cultural and political developments of the west, the finance and credit institutions are more willing to open representative offices and bureaus in Rasht and it has made the city a center of various banks and financial organizations.

There are many commercial centers, malls and financial institutions in Rasht including one branch of the Exports Development Bank of Iran which is an international bank dealing with the Iranian exports. The organizers and directors of national Iranian or non-Iranian banks afford to spend considerable amounts of budgets to construct attractive and modern buildings for their offices in Rasht.

Since the Islamic Revolution of 1979 in Iran, there have always been requests on behalf of Russian, Turkish and Azeri banks to open branches in Rasht and that is why the city is endowed as the &quot;gate of Europe&quot; in Iran. The head consulate of the Russian Federation government is located in Rasht and some of the other Caspian region countries are also keen to establish representative headquarters in Rasht alongside their embassies in Tehran.

Some evidences are the University of Gilan which was constructed jointly by the governments of Iran and West Germany about 40 years ago, the building of IRIB representatives in Rasht which was constructed jointly by the Iranian and Belgian engineers.

<text>James Augustus Van Der Zee (June 29, 1886 – May 15, 1983) was an American photographer best known for his portraits of black New Yorkers. He was a leading figure in the Harlem Renaissance. Aside from the artistic merits of his work, Van Der Zee produced the most comprehensive documentation of the period. Among his most famous subjects during this time were Marcus Garvey, Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson and Countee Cullen.

==Biography==
Born in Lenox, Massachusetts, Van Der Zee demonstrated an early gift for music, and was initially aspired to career as a professional violinist. Van Der Zee&#x27;s second interest was in photography. He bought his first camera when he was a teenager, and improvised a darkroom in his parents&#x27; home. He took hundreds of photographs of his family as well as his hometown of Lenox. Van Der Zee was one of the first people to provide an early documentation of his community life in small town New England.

In 1906, he moved with his father and brother to Harlem in New York City, where he worked as a waiter and elevator operator. By now Van Der Zee was a skilled pianist and aspiring professional violinist. He would become the primary creator and one of the five performers in a group known as the Harlem Orchestra. In March 1907, Van Der Zee married Kate L. Brown and they moved back to Lenox to have their daughter, Rachel, born in September. Soon after, they moved to Phoebus, Virginia. In 1908, their son, Emile, was born but died within a year from pneumonia.

In 1915, he moved to Newark, New Jersey, where he took a job in a portrait studio, first as a darkroom assistant and then as a portraitist. That same year, he converted to Catholicism and began taking assignments from the Church. He returned to Harlem the following year, just as large numbers of Black immigrants and migrants were arriving into that part of the city. He set up a studio at the Toussaint Conservatory of Art and Music with his sister, Jennie Louise Van Der Zee, also known as Madame E Toussaint, who had founded the conservatory in 1911.
In 1916, Van Der Zee and Gaynella Greenlee launched the Guarantee Photo Studio on West 125th Street in Harlem. They married in 1918. His business boomed during World War I, and the portraits he shot from this period until 1945 have demanded the majority of critical attention. In 1919, he photographed the victory parade of the returning 369th Infantry Regiment, a predominantly African American unit sometimes called the &quot;Harlem Hellfighters.&quot;

During the height of his popularity in 1927, his daughter Rachel, aged 19, died of appendicitis while in Portland, Maine. Van Der Zee photographed her funeral; he incorporated poems and heavenly imagery into the final prints.

During the 1920s and 1930s, he produced hundreds of photographs recording Harlem&#x27;s growing middle class. Its residents entrusted the visual documentation of their weddings, funerals, celebrities and sports stars, and social life to his carefully composed images. Quickly Van Der Zee became the most successful photographer in Harlem. Among his many renowned subjects were poet Countee Cullen, dancer Bill (&quot;Bojangles&quot;) Robinson, Charles M. &quot;Daddy&quot; Grace, Joe Louis, Florence Mills, and black nationalist leader Marcus Garvey. By the early 1930s Van Der Zee found it harder to make an income from his work in photography, partly because of the strained economic circumstances of many of his customers and partly because the growing popularity of personal cameras reduced the need for professional photography.

Van Der Zee worked predominantly in the studio and used a variety of props, including architectural elements, backdrops, and costumes, to achieve stylized tableaux vivant in keeping with late Victorian and Edwardian visual traditions. Sitters often copied celebrities of the 1920s and 1930s in their poses and expressions, and he retouched negatives and prints heavily to achieve an aura of glamour. He also created funeral photographs between the wars. These works were later collected in &quot;The Harlem Book of the Dead&quot; (1978), with a foreword by Toni Morrison.

In 1982, at age 96, Van Der Zee photographed 21-year-old painter Jean-Michel Basquiat for the January 1983 issue of &quot;Interview&quot; magazine.

Van Der Zee died in Washington, D.C., on May 15, 1983. Ten years later the National Portrait Gallery exhibited his work as a posthumous tribute. In 1984 Van Der Zee was inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum.

== Works ==

=== Commission from UNIA ===
In the spring and summer of 1924, Van Der Zee worked to document the members and activities of Marcus Garvey&#x27;s Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). He took thousands of photographs on this assignment, some of which were featured in a calendar issued to members in 1925.

Fulfilling Garvey&#x27;s wishes, Van Der Zee&#x27;s job was to project a positive image of the Association, especially to emphasize the strength and social standing of its membership, the so-called Garveyites. Nowhere in Van Der Zee&#x27;s visual record was there any hint of the controversy surrounding Garvey in the early 1920s, a period when the leader was subject to public interrogation, quarrels with the writer and philosopher W.E.B. DuBois, and legal proceedings against him on charges of mail fraud.

=== &quot;Harlem on My Mind&quot; ===
In 1969, Van Der Zee gained worldwide recognition when his work was featured in the exhibition &quot;Harlem on My Mind: Cultural Capital of Black America, 1900-1968&quot; at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. His inclusion in the exhibition was somewhat by accident. In December 1967, a researcher for the exhibition (and a photographer in his own right), Reginald McGhee, came across Van Der Zee&#x27;s Harlem studio and asked if he happened to have any photographs from the 1920s and 30s.

In a story recounted by photo historian Rodger C. Birt, Van Der Zee showed him the boxes and boxes of negatives he had kept from this period. These photographs would become the core of &quot;Harlem on My Mind&quot;—and the feature of the exhibit that critics routinely praised as the show&#x27;s biggest revelation. As art historian Sharon Patton observed, Van Der Zee not only documented the Harlem Renaissance, but also helped create it.

&quot;Harlem on My Mind&quot; marked a controversy between the Met and a number of practicing artists then living and working in Harlem. Painters including Romare Bearden and Benny Andrews protested the show for its emphasis on social history and experience, at the expense—as they viewed it—of interest in the artistic legacy of black New York artists. The Metropolitan rejected Harlem residents from planning the exhibition and utilized photography as the sole method of representation, excluding all sculptures, paintings, drawings, and prints by Harlem artists. At the time, Harlem artists — and the art world at large — did not view photography as an art form, but as a form of documentation. In this way, the Metropolitan received criticism for framing Harlem as an ethnographic study rather than a living community with thriving artistry.

On opening day, a picket line formed in front of the Met. Andrews carried a sign reading: &quot;Visit The Metropolitan Museum of Photography.&quot; 

==Photographic techniques and artistry==
Works by Van Der Zee are artistic as well as technically proficient. His work was in high demand, in part due to his experimentation and skill in double exposures and in retouching negatives of children. One theme that recurs in his photographs was the emergent black middle class, which he captured using traditional techniques in often idealistic images. Negatives were retouched to show glamor and an aura of perfection. This affected the likeness of the person photographed, but he felt each photo should transcend the subject.

His carefully posed family portraits reveal that the family unit was an important aspect of Van Der Zee&#x27;s life. &quot;I tried to see that every picture was better-looking than the person ... I had one woman come to me and say &#x27;Mr. VanDerZee my friends tell that&#x27;s a nice picture, but it doesn&#x27;t look like you.&#x27; That was my style&quot;, said VanDerZee. Van Der Zee sometimes combined several photos in one image, for example by adding a ghostly child to an image of a wedding to suggest the couple&#x27;s future, or by superimposing a funeral image upon a photograph of a dead woman to give the feeling of her eerie presence. Van Der Zee said, &quot;I wanted to make the camera take what I thought should be there.&quot;

Van Der Zee was a working photographer who supported himself through portraiture, and he devoted time to his professional work before his more artistic compositions. Many famous residents of Harlem were among his subjects. In addition to portraits, Van Der Zee photographed organizations, events, and other businesses.

<text>Epsom and Ewell is a constituency in Surrey represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2024 by Helen Maguire, a Liberal Democrat.

== History ==
The seat has existed since the February 1974 general election, forming the centre of the previous Epsom constituency. Epsom had been held by a Conservative since its creation in the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 and the new seat continued to elect Conservative MPs with sizable majorities.

Chris Grayling was first elected in 2001; he went on to serve in the cabinets of the Cameron and May governments from 2010 to 2019. Grayling stood down for the 2024 general election, when Helen Maguire of the Liberal Democrats took the seat for the first time on a swing of 18%.

In Westminster elections, it was, until 2024, one of the strongest Conservative areas in the country. Locally, however, the majority area council (Epsom and Ewell Borough Council) is controlled by the local Residents&#x27; Association. Conservatives regularly run the two slightly included neighbouring councils and until recently the party rarely contested the main borough&#x27;s elections. One ward in Epsom, Court, is quite strongly Labour, and several Residents Association councillors have sided against Conservative-run Reigate and Banstead council which is also electorally diverse.

In 1987, Barbara Follett, later Member of Parliament for Stevenage, unsuccessfully stood for the Labour Party in the constituency.

== Boundaries ==

=== Historic ===

Before 1997 Epsom and Ewell excluded Ashtead but instead included Banstead from Reigate and Banstead. As the borough of Epsom and Ewell is small and includes relatively sparsely populated areas such as Epsom Downs, the constituency has consistently also included areas of neighbouring Surrey districts.

1974–1983: The Municipal Borough of Epsom and Ewell, and the Urban District of Leatherhead.

1983–1997: The Borough of Epsom and Ewell, and the Borough of Reigate and Banstead wards of Banstead Village, Nork, Preston, and Tattenhams.

1997–2010: The Borough of Epsom and Ewell, the District of Mole Valley wards of Ashtead Common, Ashtead Park, and Ashtead Village, and the Borough of Reigate and Banstead wards of Nork, Preston, and Tattenhams.

2010–2024: The Borough of Epsom and Ewell, the District of Mole Valley wards of Ashtead Common, Ashtead Park, and Ashtead Village, and the Borough of Reigate and Banstead wards of Nork and Tattenhams.
:&quot;The boundary with Mole Valley moved slightly the uninhabited portions of land by the M25 motorway adjoining Ashtead and Leatherhead, in line with local government wards. The Preston ward of Reigate &amp; Banstead (in Tadworth) was transferred to Reigate.&quot;

=== Current ===
Further to the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies which came into effect for the 2024 general election, the constituency is defined as being composed of the following as they existed on 1 December 2020:

* The Borough of Epsom and Ewell.
* The District of Mole Valley wards of: Ashtead Common; Ashtead Park; Ashtead Village; Leatherhead North; Leatherhead South.
Following a local government boundary review in Mole Valley which came into effect in May 2023, the constituency now comprises the following from the 2024 general election:

* The Borough of Epsom and Ewell.
* The District of Mole Valley wards of Ashtead Lanes &amp; Common, Ashtead Park, Leatherhead North, and Leatherhead South.

&quot;The electorate was reduced to bring it within the permitted range by transferring the parts in the Borough of Reigate and Banstead to Reigate. To partly compensate, Leatherhead was transferred from the abolished constituency of Mole Valley (its main successor being Dorking and Horley).&quot;

<doc id="867145" wikidata="Q147356" url="?curid=867145" title="Balto-Slavic languages">
<text>The Balto-Slavic languages form a branch of the Indo-European family of languages, traditionally comprising the Baltic and Slavic languages. Baltic and Slavic languages share several linguistic traits not found in any other Indo-European branch, which points to a period of common development and origin. 

A Proto-Balto-Slavic language is reconstructable by the comparative method, descending from Proto-Indo-European by means of well-defined sound laws, and from which modern Slavic and Baltic languages descended. One particularly innovative dialect separated from the Balto-Slavic dialect continuum and became ancestral to the Proto-Slavic language, from which all Slavic languages descended.

While the notion of a Balto-Slavic unity was previously contested largely due to political controversies, there is now a general consensus among academic specialists in Indo-European linguistics that Baltic and Slavic languages comprise a single branch of the Indo-European language family, with only some minor details of the nature of their relationship remaining in contention.

==Historical dispute==
The nature of the relationship of the Balto-Slavic languages has been the subject of much discussion from the very beginning of historical Indo-European linguistics as a scientific discipline. A few are more intent on explaining the similarities between the two groups not in terms of a linguistically &quot;genetic&quot; relationship, but by language contact and dialectal closeness in the Proto-Indo-European period.
Baltic and Slavic share many close phonological, lexical, morphosyntactic and accentological similarities (listed below). The early Indo-Europeanists Rasmus Rask and August Schleicher (1861) proposed a simple solution: From Proto-Indo-European descended Balto-German-Slavonic language, out of which Proto-Balto-Slavic (later split into Proto-Baltic and Proto-Slavic) and Germanic emerged. Schleicher&#x27;s proposal was taken up and refined by Karl Brugmann, who listed eight innovations as evidence for a Balto-Slavic branch in the &quot;Grundriss der vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen&quot; (&quot;Outline of the Comparative Grammar of the Indo-Germanic Languages&quot;). The Latvian linguist Jānis Endzelīns thought, however, that any similarities among Baltic and Slavic languages resulted from intensive language contact, i.e. that they were not genetically more closely related and that there was no common Proto-Balto-Slavic language. Antoine Meillet (1905, 1908, 1922, 1925, 1934), a French linguist, in reaction to Brugmann&#x27;s hypothesis, propounded a view according to which all similarities of Baltic and Slavic occurred accidentally, by independent parallel development, and that there was no Proto-Balto-Slavic language. In turn, the Polish linguist Rozwadowski suggests that the similarities among Baltic and Slavic languages are a result of both a genetic relationship and later language contact. Thomas Olander corroborates the claim of genetic relationship in his research in the field of comparative Balto-Slavic accentology.

Even though some linguists still reject a genetic relationship, most scholars accept that Baltic and Slavic languages experienced a period of common development. This view is also reflected in most modern standard textbooks on Indo-European linguistics. Gray and Atkinson&#x27;s (2003) application of language-tree divergence analysis supports a genetic relationship between the Baltic and Slavic languages, dating the split of the family to about 1400 BCE.

==Internal classification==
The traditional division into two distinct sub-branches (i.e. Slavic and Baltic) is mostly upheld by scholars who accept Balto-Slavic as a genetic branch of Indo-European. There is a general consensus that the Baltic languages can be divided into East Baltic (Lithuanian, Latvian) and West Baltic (Old Prussian). The internal diversity of Baltic points at a much greater time-depth for the breakup of the Baltic languages in comparison to the Slavic languages.

&quot;Traditional&quot; Balto-Slavic tree model
This bipartite division into Baltic and Slavic was first challenged in the 1960s, when Vladimir Toporov and Vyacheslav Ivanov observed that the apparent difference between the &quot;structural models&quot; of the Baltic languages and the Slavic languages is the result of the innovative nature of Proto-Slavic, and that the latter had evolved from an earlier stage which conformed to the more archaic &quot;structural model&quot; of the Proto-Baltic dialect continuum. Frederik Kortlandt (1977, 2018) has proposed that West Baltic and East Baltic are in fact not more closely related to each other than either of them is related to Slavic, and Balto-Slavic therefore can be split into three equidistant branches: East Baltic, West Baltic and Slavic.

Alternative Balto-Slavic tree model
Kortlandt&#x27;s hypothesis is supported by a number of scholars. Some scholars accept Kortlandt&#x27;s division into three branches as the default assumption, but believe that there is sufficient evidence to unite East Baltic and West Baltic in an intermediate Baltic node.

The tripartite split is supported by glottochronologic studies by V. V. Kromer, whereas two computer-generated family trees (from the early 2000s) that include Old Prussian have a Baltic node parallel to the Slavic node.

==Historical expansion==
The sudden expansion of Proto-Slavic in the sixth and the seventh century (around 600 CE, uniform Proto-Slavic with minor dialectal differentiation was spoken from Thessaloniki in Greece to Novgorod in Russia) is, according to some, connected to the hypothesis that Proto-Slavic was in fact a &quot;koiné&quot; of the Avar state, i.e. the language of the administration and military rule of the Avar Khaganate in Eastern Europe. In 626, the Slavs, Persians and Avars jointly attacked the Byzantine Empire and participated in the Siege of Constantinople. In that campaign, the Slavs fought under Avar officers. There is an ongoing controversy over whether the Slavs might then have been a military caste under the khaganate rather than an ethnicity. Their language—at first possibly only one local speech—once koinéized, became a &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the Avar state. This might explain how Proto-Slavic spread to the Balkans and the areas of the Danube basin, and would also explain why the Avars were assimilated so fast, leaving practically no linguistic traces, and that Proto-Slavic was so unusually uniform. However, such a theory fails to explain how Slavic spread to Eastern Europe, an area that had no historical links with the Avar Khanate. That said, the Avar state was later replaced by the definitively Slavic state of Great Moravia, which could have played the same role.

It is also likely that the expansion of Slavic occurred with the assimilation of Iranic-speaking groups such as the Sarmatians, who quickly adopted Proto-Slavic due to speaking related Indo-European satem languages, in much the same way Latin expanded by assimilating the Celtic speakers in continental Western Europe and the Dacians.

That sudden expansion of Proto-Slavic erased most of the idioms of the Balto-Slavic dialect continuum, which left us today with only two groups, Baltic and Slavic (or East Baltic, West Baltic, and Slavic in the minority view). This secession of the Balto-Slavic dialect ancestral to Proto-Slavic is estimated on archaeological and glottochronological criteria to have occurred sometime in the period 1500–1000 BCE. Hydronymic evidence suggests that Baltic languages were once spoken in much wider territory than the one they cover today, all the way to Moscow, and were later replaced by Slavic.

==Shared features of the Balto-Slavic languages==
The degree of relationship of the Baltic and Slavic languages is indicated by a series of common innovations not shared with other Indo-European languages, and by the relative chronology of these innovations which can be established. The Baltic and Slavic languages also share some inherited words. These are either not found at all in other Indo-European languages (except when borrowed) or are inherited from Proto-Indo-European but have undergone identical changes in meaning when compared to other Indo-European languages. This indicates that the Baltic and Slavic languages share a period of common development, the Proto-Balto-Slavic language.

===Common sound changes===
* Winter&#x27;s law: lengthening of vowels before Proto-Indo-European (PIE) non-breathy voiced consonants (&quot;*b&quot;, &quot;*d&quot;, &quot;*g&quot;).
* PIE breathy-voiced consonants (&quot;*bʰ&quot;, &quot;*dʰ&quot;, &quot;*gʰ&quot;, &quot;*ǵʰ&quot;) merge into plain voiced consonants (&quot;*b&quot;, &quot;*d&quot;, &quot;*g&quot;, &quot;*ǵ&quot;). This also occurred in several other Indo-European branches, but as Winter&#x27;s law was sensitive to the difference between the two types of consonants, the merger must have happened after it and so is a specific Balto-Slavic innovation.
* Hirt&#x27;s law: retraction of the PIE accent to the preceding syllable, if that syllable ended in a laryngeal (&quot;*h₁&quot;, &quot;*h₂&quot;, &quot;*h₃&quot;, see Laryngeal theory).
* A high vowel is inserted before PIE syllabic sonorants (&quot;*l̥&quot;, &quot;*r̥&quot;, &quot;*m̥&quot;, &quot;*n̥&quot;). This vowel is usually &quot;*i&quot; (giving &quot;*il&quot;, &quot;*ir&quot;, &quot;*im&quot;, &quot;*in&quot;) but in some occasions also &quot;*u&quot; (&quot;*ul&quot;, &quot;*ur&quot;, &quot;*um&quot;, &quot;*un&quot;). Proto-Germanic is the only other Indo-European language that inserts a high vowel (&quot;*u&quot; in all cases), all others insert mid or low vowels instead.
* Emergence of a register distinction on long syllables, between acute (probably glottalized) and circumflex. The acute arose primarily when the syllable ended in a PIE voiced consonant (as in Winter&#x27;s law) or when it ended in a laryngeal. The distinction is reflected in most Balto-Slavic languages, including Proto-Slavic, as an opposition between rising and falling tone on accented syllables. Some Baltic languages directly reflect the acute register in the form of a so-called &quot;broken tone&quot;.
* Shortening of vowels before word-final &quot;*m&quot;.
* Word-final &quot;*-mi&quot; &gt; &quot;*-m&quot; after a long vowel. This followed the preceding change, as the preceding long vowel is retained.
* Raising of stressed &quot;*o&quot; to &quot;*u&quot; in a final syllable.
* Merging of PIE short &quot;*o&quot; and &quot;*a&quot; into &quot;*a&quot;. This change also occurred in several other Indo-European branches, but here too it must have happened after Winter&#x27;s law: Winter&#x27;s law lengthens &quot;*o&quot; to &quot;*ō&quot; and &quot;*a&quot; to &quot;*ā&quot;, and must therefore have occurred before the two sounds merged. It also followed the raising of &quot;*o&quot; to &quot;*u&quot; above. In the Slavic languages, &quot;*a&quot; is later rounded to &quot;*o&quot;, while the Baltic languages keep &quot;*a&quot;:
** Lithuanian &quot;ašìs&quot; Old Church Slavonic &quot;ось&quot; (from PIE &quot;*a&quot;: Latin &quot;axis&quot;, Ancient Greek &quot;áxōn&quot;)
** Lithuanian &quot;avìs&quot;, Old Church Slavonic &quot;овьца&quot; (from PIE &quot;*o&quot;: Latin &quot;ovis&quot;, Greece &quot;óis&quot;)

Common Balto-Slavic innovations include several other changes, which are also shared by several other Indo-European branches. These are therefore not direct evidence for the existence of a common Balto-Slavic family, but they do corroborate it.

* Satemization: The PIE palatovelar consonants &quot;*ḱ&quot;, &quot;*ǵ&quot;, &quot;*ǵʰ&quot; become palatal sibilants &quot;*ś&quot;, &quot;*ź&quot;, &quot;*ź&quot;, while the PIE labiovelar consonants &quot;*kʷ&quot;, &quot;*gʷ&quot;, &quot;*gʷʰ&quot; lose their labialization and merge with the plain velar &quot;*k&quot;, &quot;*g&quot;, &quot;*gʰ&quot;. The palatal sibilants later become plain sibilants &quot;*s&quot;, &quot;*z&quot; in all Balto-Slavic languages except Lithuanian.
* Ruki sound law: &quot;*s&quot; becomes &quot;*š&quot; when preceded by &quot;*r&quot;, &quot;*u&quot;, &quot;*k&quot; or &quot;*i&quot;. In Slavic, this &quot;*š&quot; later becomes &quot;*x&quot; (variously spelled , or in the Slavic languages) when followed by a back vowel.

===Common grammatical innovations===
* Replacement of the original PIE genitive singular ending of thematic (o-stem) nouns, which is reconstructed as &quot;&quot;, with the ablative ending &quot;*-ād&quot; (Proto-Slavic &quot;*vьlka&quot;, Lithuanian &quot;vil̃ko&quot;, Latvian &quot;vilka&quot;). Old Prussian, however, has another ending, perhaps stemming from the original PIE genitive: &quot;deiwas&quot; &quot;god&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;tawas&quot; &quot;father&#x27;s&quot;.
* Use of the ending &quot;*-ān&quot; (from earlier &quot;*-āmi&quot;) of the instrumental singular in ā-stem nouns and adjectives. This contrasts with Sanskrit &quot;-ayā&quot;, archaic Vedic &quot;-ā&quot;. Lithuanian &quot;rankà&quot; is ambiguous and could have originated from either ending, but the correspondence with East Lithuanian &quot;runku&quot; and Latvian &quot;rùoku&quot; point to Balto-Slavic &quot;*-ān&quot;.
* Use of the ending &quot;*-mis&quot; in the instrumental plural, e.g. Lithuanian &quot;&quot;, Old Church Slavonic &quot;&quot; &quot;with sons&quot;. This ending is also found in Germanic, while the other Indo-European languages have an ending with &quot;-bʰ-&quot;, as in Sanskrit &quot;&quot;.
* Creation of a distinction between definite (meaning similar to &quot;the&quot;) and indefinite adjectives (meaning similar to &quot;a&quot;). The definite forms were formed by attaching the corresponding form of the relative/demonstrative pronoun &quot;*jas&quot; to the end of the adjective. For example, Lithuanian &quot;geràsis &#x27;the good&#x27; as opposed to &quot;&quot; &#x27;good&#x27;, Old Church Slavonic &quot;dobrъjь &#x27;the good&#x27; as opposed to &quot;&quot; &#x27;good&#x27;. These forms in Lithuanian, however, seem to have developed after the split, since in older Lithuanian literature (16th century and onwards) they had not yet merged (e.g. &quot;naujamę́jame&quot; ʽin the new one&#x27; from &quot;*naujamén&quot; + &quot;*jamén&quot;). In Lithuanian, the pronoun merged with the adjective having a modern (secondary) pronominal inflection; in Slavic, the pronoun merged with an adjective, having an ancient (primary) nominal inflection.
* Usage of the genitive case for the direct object of a negative verb. For example, Russian &#x27;, Lith. &quot;knygos&quot;&#x27; neskaičiau&quot; &#x27;I haven&#x27;t read the book&#x27;.

===Shared vocabulary===
Some examples of words shared among most or all Balto-Slavic languages:

* &#x27;tilia&#x27; (linden tree): Lithuanian &quot;&quot;, Old Prussian &quot;līpa&quot;, Latvian &quot;&quot;, Latgalian &quot;&quot;, Common Slavic &quot;&quot; (Old Church Slavonic &quot;&quot;, Russian &quot;&quot;, Polish &quot;&quot;, Czech &quot;&quot;)
* &#x27;hand&#x27;: Lithuanian &quot;&quot;, Old Prussian &quot;rānkan&quot; (acc. sg.), Latvian &quot;&quot;, Latgalian &quot;&quot;, Common Slavic &quot;&quot; (Old Church Slavonic &quot;&quot;, Russian &quot;&quot;, Polish &quot;&quot;, Czech &quot;&quot;)
* &#x27;head&#x27;: Lithuanian &quot;&quot;, Old Prussian &quot;&quot;, Latvian &quot;&quot;, Latgalian &quot;&quot;; Common Slavic &quot;&quot; (Old Church Slavonic &quot;&quot;, Russian &quot;&quot;, Polish &quot;&quot;, Czech &quot;&quot;, Slavic &quot;Triglav&quot; &#x27;three-headed/three-faced&#x27; god).

Despite lexical developments exclusive to Balto-Slavic and otherwise showing evidence for a stage of common development, there are considerable differences between the vocabularies of Baltic and Slavic. Rozwadowski noted that every semantic field contains core vocabulary that is etymologically different between the two branches. Andersen prefers a dialect continuum model where the northernmost dialects developed into Baltic and the southernmost dialects into Slavic (with Slavic later absorbing any intermediate idioms during its expansion). Andersen thinks that different neighboring and substratum languages might have contributed to the differences in basic vocabulary.

<text>was a Japanese composer. He is best known for composing several entries in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise as well as developing the titular monster&#x27;s roar.

==Biography==
===Early years in Hokkaido===
Akira Ifukube was born on 31 May 1914, in Kushiro, Japan as the third son of a police officer Toshimitsu Ifukube. The origins of this family can be traced back to at least the 7th century with the birth of Ifukibe-no-Tokotarihime. He was strongly influenced by the Ainu music as he spent his childhood (from age of 9 to 12) in Otofuke near Obihiro, where was with a mixed population of Ainu and Japanese. His first encounter with classical music occurred when attending secondary school in Sapporo city. Ifukube decided to become a composer at the age of 14 after hearing a radio performance of Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, and also cited the music of Manuel de Falla as a major influence.

Ifukube studied forestry at Hokkaido Imperial University in Sapporo and composed in his spare time, which prefigured a line of self-taught Japanese composers. His first piece was the piano solo, &quot;Piano Suite&quot; (later the title was changed to &quot;Japan Suite&quot;, arranged for orchestra), dedicated to George Copeland who was living in Spain. Atsushi Miura, Ifukube&#x27;s friend at the university, sent a letter to Copeland. Copeland replied, &quot;It is wonderful that you listen my disc in spite of you living in Japan, the opposite side of the earth. I imagine you may compose music. Send me some piano pieces.&quot; Then Miura, who was not a composer, presented Ifukube and this piece to Copeland. Copeland promised to interpret it, but the correspondence was unfortunately stopped because of the Spanish Civil War. Ifukube&#x27;s big break came in 1935, when his first orchestral piece &quot;Japanese Rhapsody&quot; won the first prize in a competition for Japanese composers promoted by Alexander Tcherepnin. The judges of that contest—Albert Roussel, Jacques Ibert, Arthur Honegger, Alexandre Tansman, Tibor Harsányi, Pierre-Octave Ferroud, and Henri Gil-Marchex were unanimous in their selection of Ifukube as the winner. Ifukube studied modern Western composition while Tcherepnin was visiting Japan, and his &quot;Piano Suite&quot; received an honourable mention at the I.C.S.M. festival in Venice in 1938. &quot;Japanese Rhapsody&quot; was performed in Europe on a number of occasions in the late 1930s.

On completing University, he worked as a forestry officer and lumber processor in Akkeshi, and towards the end of the Second World War was appointed by the Imperial Japanese Army to study the elasticity and vibratory strength of wood. He suffered radiation exposure after carrying out x-rays without protection, a consequence of the wartime lead shortage. Thus, he had to abandon forestry work and became a professional composer and teacher. Ifukube spent some time in hospital due to the radiation exposure, and was startled one day to hear one of his own marches being played over the radio when General Douglas MacArthur arrived to formalize the Japanese surrender.

===From 1946 to 2006 in Tokyo===

He taught at the Tokyo University of the Arts (formerly Tokyo Music School), during which period he composed his first film score for &quot;Snow Trail&quot;, released in 1947. Over the next fifty years, he would compose more than 250 film scores, the high point of which was his 1954 music for Ishirō Honda&#x27;s Toho movie, &quot;Godzilla&quot;. Ifukube also created Godzilla&#x27;s trademark roar – produced by rubbing a resin-covered leather glove along the loosened strings of a double bass – and its footsteps, created by striking an amplifier box.

Despite his financial success as a film composer, Ifukube&#x27;s first love had always been his general classical work as a composer. In fact his compositions for the two genres cross-fertilized each other. For example, he was to recycle his 1953 music for the ballet &quot;Shaka&quot;, about how the young Siddhartha Gautama eventually became the Buddha, for Kenji Misumi&#x27;s 1961 film &quot;Buddha&quot;. Then in 1988 he reworked the film music to create his three-movement symphonic ode &quot;Gotama the Buddha&quot;. Meanwhile, he had returned to teaching at the Tokyo College of Music, becoming president of the college the following year, and in 1987 retired to become head of the College&#x27;s ethnomusicology department.

He trained younger generation composers such as Toshiro Mayuzumi, Yasushi Akutagawa, Akio Yashiro, Teizo Matsumura, Sei Ikeno, Minoru Miki, Maki Ishii, Riichirō Manabe, Hajime Okumura, Reiko Arima, Taichiro Kosugi, Kaoru Wada, Motoji Ishimaru, Shigeyuki Imai, and Satoshi Imai. He also published &quot;Orchestration&quot;, a 1,000-page book on theory, widely used among Japanese composers.

He died in Tokyo at Meguro-ku Hospital of multiple organ dysfunction on 8 February in 2006, at the age of 91 and buried at the Ube shrine in Tottori.

===Honors===

The Japanese government awarded Ifukube the Order of Culture. Subsequently, he was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure, Third Class.

The conflict formed part of the Norwegian expedition against Scotland in 1263, in which Haakon Haakonsson, King of Norway attempted to reassert Norwegian sovereignty over the western seaboard of Scotland. Victory was achieved by the Scots with a crafty three-tiered strategy on the part of the young Scottish king, Alexander III: plodding diplomacy forced the campaign to bad weather months and a ferocious storm ravaged the Norwegian fleet, stripping it of many vessels and supplies and making the forces on the Scottish coast vulnerable to an attack that forced the Norwegians into a hasty retreat that was to end their 500-year history of invasion, and leaving Scotland to consolidate its resources into building the nation. 

Since the beginning of the 12th century, Largs in the north Ayrshire area of Scotland had lain at the periphery of the Norwegian realm, ruled by magnates who recognised the overlordship of the kings of Norway. In the mid-13th century, two Scottish kings, Alexander II and his son Alexander III, attempted to incorporate the region into their own realm. Following Alexander III&#x27;s early, failed attempts to purchase the islands from the Norwegian king, the Scots launched military operations to end the issue altogether by asserting royal sovereignty over all of western Scotland. Haakon responded to the Scottish aggression by leading a massive Norwegian fleet, thought to number in the thousands of vessels, that reached the Hebrides in the summer of 1263. Realizing that the Scots were tremendously outnumbered by an experienced and mobile enemy, Alexander III sought a protracted diplomatic intervention that would buy time to acquire more troops and possibly force the Norwegians into the stormy autumn and winter months where an invasion could be stalled due to weather. By late September, Haakon&#x27;s fleet occupied the Firth of Clyde and the temperate days — such as they are on the western coast of Scotland — were almost at an end. When negotiations between the kingdoms broke down, Haakon brought the bulk of his fleet to anchor off the Cumbraes, poised to invade Scotland at a site of his choosing.

On the night of 1 October, during a bout of stormy weather, several Norwegian vessels were driven aground on the Ayrshire coast, near present-day Largs. On 2 October, while the Norwegians were salvaging their vessels, the main Scottish army arrived on the scene. Composed of infantry and cavalry, the Scottish force was commanded by Alexander of Dundonald, Steward of Scotland. The Norwegians were gathered in two groups: the larger main force on the beach and a small contingent atop a nearby mound. The advance of the Scots threatened to divide the Norwegian forces, so the contingent on the mound ran to rejoin their comrades on the beach below. Seeing them running from the mound, the Norwegians on the beach believed they were retreating and fled back towards the ships. There was fierce fighting on the beach, and the Scots took up a position on the mound formerly held by the Norwegians. Late in the day, the Norwegians recaptured the mound after several hours of skirmishing. The Scots withdrew from the scene and the Norwegians reboarded their ships. They returned the next morning to collect their dead. With the weather deteriorating, Haakon&#x27;s fleet sailed to Orkney to overwinter.

As a result of the battle, Scotland achieved the end of 500 years of Norse Viking depredations and invasions despite being tremendously outnumbered, without a one-sided military victory in the ensuing battle. The victory caused the complete retreat of Norwegian forces from western Scotland and the realm entered a period of prosperity for almost 40 years. The tactical decision at Largs thus led to a sweeping strategic victory that ended in Scotland purchasing the Hebrides Islands and the Isle of Man in the Treaty of Perth, 1266. 

The battle is commemorated in Largs by an early 20th-century monument, and festivities held there annually since the 1980s.

== Context ==

Viking depredations have been recorded in the British Isles since the late 8th century, and Scandinavian settlement on Scotland&#x27;s western-seaboard may have begun before the turn of the 9th century. Claims to this region by Norwegian kings date to the turn of the 12th century, when Magnus Olafsson, King of Norway (d. 1103) established himself in the Hebrides and the Isle of Man (Mann). Direct Norwegian control ended with Magnus&#x27; death, after which the Hebrides and Mann, known to the Norwegians as the &quot;Southern Isles&quot;, were controlled by local dynasties for over a century and a half. In the first half of the 13th century, the seaboard was controlled by two main power blocks: one consisting of the Mann, Lewis and Harris, and Skye—controlled by the patrilineal descendants of Godred Crovan (d. 1095); the other consisting of mainland territories in Argyll, and the islands of Islay, Jura, Mull, and possibly Uist—controlled by the descendants of Somerled (d. 1164). As part of the far-flung, early 13th century Norwegian realm, these island rulers recognised the overlordship of Haakon Haakonarson, King of Norway (d. 1263).

The first half of the 13th century was a period of consolidation for both Scottish and Norwegian kings. The Norwegians, under Haakon, overcame a period of internal strife, from 1161 to 1208, and oversaw the submission of the Faroe Islands, the Greenland settlements, and Iceland, in the mid 13th century. The Scots, under Alexander II, King of Scots (d. 1249), extended royal authority into the northern Highlands, Argyll, and Galloway. The king also wanted to incorporate the western seaboard into the Scottish realm. In 1230, Scottish aggression against the Isles and interference forced the Norwegian king to pacify the region. In 1249, after attempting to purchase the Isles from Haakon, Alexander II launched a campaign of his own, deep into Argyll and into the Hebrides. Unfortunately for the Scots, their king died suddenly on the verge of conquest. Since his son and successor, Alexander III (d. 1286), was only a boy at the time, the Scottish realm suffered through a lengthy and troubled minority. In consequence, it wasn&#x27;t until the 1260s that the king looked west and attempted to finish what his father had so nearly accomplished.

In 1262, a year after another unsuccessful attempt to purchase the Isles, Scottish forces launched an attack upon Skye. Haakon&#x27;s response to the invasion was to mastermind a massive military expedition of his own. Described by the Icelandic Annals as the largest force to have ever set sail from Norway, the fleet reached the Isles in the summer of 1263. After receiving only a lukewarm reception from his vassals in the region, Haakon&#x27;s forces reached the Firth of Clyde, after his men had secured several castles, and undertook raids into the surrounding mainland. With the Norwegian fleet anchored off Arran, the Norwegians and Scottish embassies fiercely debated the sovereignty of the Islands of the Clyde. When talks broke down, Haakon dispatched a fleet of Islesmen to raid into Loch Lomond, and to ravage Lennox. Meanwhile, the main Norwegian fleet repositioned itself between the Cumbraes and the Ayrshire coast.

== Actions ==

The main Norwegian source for the battle is &quot;Hakonar saga Hakonarsonar&quot;, a contemporary account of the life of Hakon Haakonarson, King of Norway (d. 1263), composed by the Icelandic historian Sturla Thordarson (d. 1284). Although the saga describes the events purely from the Norwegian perspective, its narrative of the battle appears to have been drawn from eyewitness accounts, and it is the most detailed source available for the Scottish–Norwegian conflict, given that many contemporary Scottish archival holdings are lost to history. A contemporary Scottish perspective of the events is preserved in a brief entry in the &quot;Chronicle of Melrose&quot;. First penned at Melrose Abbey in the last quarter of the 12th century, the chronicle was further extended and supplemented from time to time into the late 13th century. It is an important historical source for the mediaeval Scottish realm. Clan and remaining royal records of property and titles subsequent to the event are also informative.

While lying off the Cumbraes, on the night of 30 September, Haakon&#x27;s fleet was battered by stormy weather. During the night, the saga records that a merchantman dragged its anchor and was driven aground. The following morning, it and four other vessels were floated off by the rising tide but carried by the current towards the Scottish mainland where they ran aground again. The crews of the beached vessels were soon harassed by a small force of Scots armed with bows. After the Norwegians had suffered some casualties, Haakon sent reinforcements ashore, and the Scots fled the area. Haakon&#x27;s reinforcements remained ashore for the night, and the Norwegian king himself came ashore to oversee the salvage operation the next morning.

According to the saga, the main Scottish force, consisting of heavily armoured cavalry and infantry, arrived on 2 October. The saga numbers the mounted troops at about 500 and states that they rode high-quality horses protected by mail. The use of a substantial force of mounted knights or sergeants appears to be corroborated in contemporary records of payments made to troops. For example, Walter Stewart, Earl of Menteith had to maintain 120 sergeants—which could include knights, mounted men-at-arms, archers, or other footsoldiers—at Ayr Castle for three weeks. Although surviving records fail to mention the number of knights assembled at Ayr, the record of wages suggests that it was &quot;more than a mere handful&quot;. According to the saga, the Scottish infantry were armed with bows and &quot;Irish axes&quot;, and since at one point the Scots are said to have thrown stones at the Norwegians, the Scottish army must have also included slingers. The Latin &quot;Chronicle of Melrose&quot; simply describes the Scottish infantry as &quot;pedisequi patrie&quot; (the &quot;foot-sloggers of the locality&quot;). If this description refers to the men of the surrounding countryside, the Scottish infantry would have been made up of men from the &#x27;common army&#x27;, drawn only from Strathgryffe, Cunninghame and Kyle. These levies would have been mustered by the Sheriff of Ayr, the Sheriff of Lanark, and the local magnates. At the time of Largs, the Scottish king thus had at his disposal men from the &#x27;common army&#x27; (lesser men who owed service to their king), the feudal host (greater men who owed military service for their lands), and also paid troops.

The evidence suggests that the main Scottish force arrived from the south, rather than from the east or the north. For example, Alexander III is recorded to have been south at Ayr in September, and the power centre of Alexander of Dundonald, Steward of Scotland (d. 1282), who is thought to have commanded the Scottish forces at the battle, was also located to the south. Furthermore, at the time of the battle, the Sheriff of Ayr was probably a member of the steward&#x27;s family—probably his younger brother, the Earl of Menteith. If the Scots had indeed arrived from the south, then they would have also assembled at a mustering site to the south, possibly somewhere near Ayr. The saga indicates that the Norwegians were divided into two groups. The smaller force numbered 200 men, was stationed on a mound, somewhat inland from the beach, under the command of a Norwegian nobleman Ogmund Crouchdance. The main Norwegian force, numbering about 700 to 800 men (including Haakon himself), was stationed on the beach below. These two detachments were likely only a fraction of the total number of forces at Haakon&#x27;s disposal. The numbers that the saga allows for either side may be exaggerated. A more likely number may be only about one hundred or several hundred men per side with the number of knights present may have been closer to 50 than the saga&#x27;s 500. The forces which Haakon had mustered in Norway formed part of his realm&#x27;s leidang, a naval levy in which districts contributed men, ships, and provisions for military service.

As the Scots advanced towards the Norwegians, the saga indicates that Ogmund withdrew his troops from the mound to avoid being cut off from his comrades on the beach below. If the Scots had indeed marched northwards, their advance would have threatened to drive a wedge between the Norwegians on the mound and those on the beach. Once the Scottish vanguard came into contact with Ogmund&#x27;s men, the saga indicates that his orderly withdrawal disintegrated into a chaotic scramble. On the beach below, Haakon followed the advice of his men and retired to the safety of his ships. To the men on the beach, the rapid descent of Ogmund&#x27;s men towards them looked like an all-out retreat; they turned and fled. The Norwegian army was thus routed, and in the mad dash back to their ships they suffered substantial casualties. Some of the Norwegians may have used the beached vessels as makeshift fortifications, since the saga notes that a group of them made a bold stand by their ships, out-numbered ten to one, in a fierce engagement in which a particularly valiant Scottish knight was slain. This entry confirms that at least some of the Scottish knights present were able to engage their foes on horseback. The supplies and usable ships lost on the beach were consequential in Haakom&#x27;s decision to retreat from the area.

According to the saga, the Scots then withdrew from the beach and consolidated atop the mound abandoned by Ogmund&#x27;s men, who had been beaten back by a detachment of men under Sir Robert Boyd (father of William Wallace&#x27;s second in command). Minor skirmishing followed in which both sides attacked each other with arrows and stones. Before nightfall, the saga maintains that the Norwegians made one last determined assault, and forced the Scots from the mound, before making an orderly withdrawal to their ships. On the morning of 3 October, the Norwegians returned ashore to collect their dead and burn their beached vessels. For several days, Haakon&#x27;s forces laid off the coast of Arran. After rendezvousing with the returning fleet that had plundered Lennox, Haakon&#x27;s entire forces made for the Hebrides. At Mull he rewarded a number of his Norse-Gaelic vassals with grants of lands. By the end of October, the Norwegian fleet reached Orkney. In mid December, the Norwegian king fell ill and died at the Bishop&#x27;s Palace, and was temporarily buried in nearby St Magnus Cathedral.

== Aftermath ==
The saga described the Norwegian campaign as a triumph. In reality, it had not achieved anything, though the expedition was not lost at Largs. Haakon simply retreated to Orkney to overwinter with his forces. He unexpectedly fell ill and died there before he had the chance to resume operations. The campaign had started too late, and the Scottish king had successfully prolonged negotiations to his own advantage. As the summer turned to autumn, and the royal envoys parleyed back and forth, Alexander III had further strengthened his forces in the defence of his realm and left Haakon&#x27;s fleet to the mercy of the deteriorating weather. In the end, the Scottish realm had successfully defended itself from Norwegian might, and many of Haakon&#x27;s Norse-Gaelic vassals had been reluctant to support the Norwegian cause. Within months of the abortive campaign, embassies were sent from Norway to discuss terms of peace. Meanwhile, Alexander III seized the initiative and made ready to punish the magnates who had supported Haakon. By the end of the year the Hebrideans and Manx were forced to submit to the Scots. In 1266, almost three years after the battle, terms of peace were finally agreed upon between the Scottish and Norwegian kings. On 2 July 1266, with the conclusion of the Treaty of Perth, the Hebrides and Mann were leased to the King of Scots, in return for an annual payment. As it happened, Norwegian rule over the Hebrides would never return, with the Kingdom of Scotland eventually discontinuing their payments to the Norwegian crown. The treaty also entailed Scottish acceptance of Norwegian rule over Orkney and Shetland.

== Ramifications ==

The battle of Largs has been characterized by later historians as a great Scottish victory, but its strategic ramifications far outstripped its tactical cost as it involved only a small part of the Norwegian fleet. With his fleet and forces strewn about the Hebrides, Haakon may have intended to continue to campaign after spending the winter in Orkney and reconcentrating his forces, but he was taken ill in the dismal climate and died there. His illness is thought to have been caused in part by the stresses he endured in the long campaign and the difficult, damp environment of the Orkney Islands. The protracted diplomacy that had slowed his invasion had ultimately helped seal his own fate as well. With Haakon&#x27;s death, his successor, Magnus Haakonarson, King of Norway, signed the Treaty of Perth three years after the battle, leasing Scotland&#x27;s western seaboard to Alexander III in return for a yearly payment. This lease became permanent, but the Kingdom of Scotland eventually stopped paying the Norwegian crown for the islands when Norway became distracted by civil wars.

Although the Battle of Largs&#x27; contemporary records were largely lost to history with the loss of the Scottish archives in the wars of independence, it is for historians today to judge it by its ultimate, easily understood consequence: the end of a multi-century era of Norse invasion. The Battle greatly influenced clan history, especially that of the Boyds, Cunninghams, and Muirs, all of which point directly to participation in this battle as key to the grant of lands in Ayrshire. In the case of the Boyd family, its motto &quot;Confido&quot; (I Trust) was a direct quote from Alexander III at Largs. Alexander III depended on Boyd&#x27;s detachment to keep the Norwegians off Gold Berry Hill and enveloped on the beach. The name &quot;Gold Berry&quot; was placed under their early heraldic devices.

== Historiography ==

The significance of the Battle was understood in Scotland at the time as it led to years of consolidation of royal authority. Unfortunately, many original sources and manuscripts were lost during the many years of fighting with the English, especially Edward I (see Jonathan Donald: 2019, Scotland, LE School of History, University of St Andrews, &quot;Alexander III, 1249–1286: First Among Equals&quot;). See also Acts of Alexander III King of Scots 1249 -1286 See also: The &quot;Chronicle of Melrose&quot; offers only a brief description, and does not record its location. It ascribes the campaign&#x27;s failure more to the power of God than to that of the Scots. The battle is not recorded at all within the &quot;Chronicle of Mann&quot;, or any Irish source, and English sources show a similar lack of interest. But by the 14th and 15th centuries, the battle was being portrayed as part of an epic struggle between an invading force of Norwegians and an idealised Scottish king defending his realm. By the 17th century, the battle had lost its attributed significance, but in the 19th century it was rediscovered by antiquarians and historians who transformed it into a conflict of international importance. Although the battle&#x27;s upsurge in popularity at this time may be due to the tapping of Largs&#x27; tourism potential, it was also influenced by the general heightening of interest in Scotland&#x27;s history and culture. The battle became associated with Scotland&#x27;s proud military past and linked to the great mediaeval victories of national heroes such as Wallace and Bruce. Most modern academics do not subscribe to such a view, though they regard the battle as a significant part of the failed Norwegian campaign. But even today, to the locals of Largs, the battle represents a glorious Scottish victory over invading Vikings.

== Commemoration ==
On 12 July 1912, the battle was commemorated at Largs with the unveiling of a newly built stone tower. Popularly known as &quot;The Pencil&quot;, this tall, pencil-shaped, conical-roofed tower is built out of ashlar blocks of whinstone. Constructed by architect James Sandyford Kay at the cost of nearly , the tower was modelled after mediaeval round towers at Abernethy and Brechin, which were thought (erroneously) to have been built as redoubts against Viking marauders. The Pencil has been protected as a listed building since 1971, and stands about south of Largs, at , overlooking the local marina.

Although the monument marks the traditional battle site, it stands nowhere near the probable battle site. Its erroneous placement appears to be due to the discovery of prehistoric burials, consisting of both chambered tombs and cist burials. Nearby Bronze Age standing stones may have been interpreted as memorials to slain warriors, as was a nearby Neolithic tomb. The location of this tomb has led to the erroneous association between the battle and the two parks situated at and . The Ordnance Survey also locates the battle too far south, at .

The probable site of the mound upon which the Norwegians and Scots fought is not commemorated at all. Located at ., and surrounded by a housing development, the mound is crowned by a 19th-century monument known as &quot;The Three Sisters&quot;, which may have been erected by astronomer Thomas Brisbane. In recent years the battle site has been one of fifty battlefields researched by the Centre for Battlefield Archaeology and Historic Scotland for inclusion in the Inventory of Scottish Battlefields. The inventory, established in 2009, is intended to protect, preserve, and promote Scotland&#x27;s most significant battlefields under the Scottish Historical Environment Policy. The site of the Battle of Largs was one of eleven investigated sites that did not meet the criteria for inclusion.

Each autumn since 1981, the village of Largs has hosted the &quot;Largs Viking Festival&quot;, founded to celebrate the battle and to encourage tourism. A re-enactment of the battle, held onsite at The Pencil, forms part of the festivities. The battle is the subject of John Galt&#x27;s (d. 1839) &quot;The Battle of Largs: a Gothic Poem&quot;, written about 1804. Not regarded as one of Galt&#x27;s better literary works, this poem was almost certainly based on James Johnstone&#x27;s (d. 1798) &quot;The Norwegian Account of Haco&#x27;s Expedition Against Scotland A.D. MCCLXIII&quot;, published in 1782. The battle is also commemorated within one of William Hole&#x27;s (d. 1917) massive murals, which can be viewed in the foyer of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.

<text>No. 29 Squadron of the Royal Air Force was first raised as a unit of the Royal Flying Corps in 1915, and is one of the world&#x27;s oldest fighter squadrons. The second British squadron to receive the Eurofighter Typhoon, it is currently the operational conversion unit (OCU) for the Typhoon.

==History==

===First World War===
This unit was first raised as a reserve squadron at Fort Grange, Gosport, initially equipped with the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c, in November 1915. In early 1916 however No. 29 became the fourth squadron to receive the Airco DH.2 &quot;pusher&quot; fighter, and arrived in France on 25 March 1916 – helping to end the Fokker Scourge and establish Allied air superiority in time for the Battle of the Somme.

By late 1916 the DH.2 was outclassed by new German fighters, but No. 29 kept its pushers until March 1917, when it was re-equipped with Nieuport 17s. These were replaced with later Nieuport types, such as the Nieuport 24bis, as these became available. Due to a shortage of the Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5a the squadron retained its Nieuports until April 1918. At this time the squadron finally received the S.E.5a, which it retained for the rest of the war.

The award of a Victoria Cross – the highest award for valour &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; in the British Empire – to Captain James McCudden of 29 Squadron was gazetted on 2 April 1918, for McCudden&#x27;s &quot;conspicuous bravery, exceptional perseverance and a high devotion to duty&quot;, between August 1917 and March 1918.

October 1918 was a bitter month for the squadron; an American volunteer, Lieutenant Joseph Patrick Murphy was the first to fall on 8 October and become a prisoner of war. British Ace Claude Melnot Wilson was next to fall, on 14 October and Guy Wareing was shot down on the 27 October.

After a short period with the army of occupation in Germany, the Squadron returned to the UK in August 1919 and was disbanded on 31 December 1919. The squadron ended the war having claimed 385 victories. Apart from those already mentioned, the 26 aces who served with the squadron included:

*Edgar O. Amm
*Norman Brearley 
*Sydney Brown
*Edgar G. Davies
*Francis James Davies
*Thomas Sinclair Harrison
*D&#x27;Arcy Fowlis Hilton
*Ernest Charles Hoy
*Arthur G. Jones-Williams
*Camille Lagesse
*William Molesworth
*James Dennis Payne
*Arthur Reed
*Charles G. Ross
*Reginald H. Rusby
*Alfred Shepherd
*Christoffel Venter
*Walter Bertram Wood
===Inter-war years===

The squadron was reformed on 1 April 1923, initially equipped with Sopwith Snipes. These were replaced by Gloster Grebes in January 1925, In turn, these were replaced by the Armstrong Whitworth Siskin IIIA in March 1928 and Bristol Bulldogs in June 1932. In March 1935, nearly twenty years after it was first raised as a single-seat fighter squadron, the squadron received two-seater Hawker Demons, which it operated until 1938. This included service in Egypt from October 1935 to 1936, during the Abyssinian crisis. As part of the Royal Air Force’s modernisation and expansion in the late 1930s, No. 29 received Bristol Blenheim IF heavy fighters in December 1938.

===Second World War===

No 29 began the Second World War with its Blenheims, which at the period operated as day fighters – especially on convoy protection patrols. From June 1940 it became a night fighter squadron, receiving some of the first Beaufighters in November, though it was February 1941 before the squadron was fully equipped with the new fighter. Various marks of the de Havilland Mosquito were flown by the squadron from May 1943 culminating in the Mosquito NF30.

===Post-war===
During the immediate post-war years the squadron remained a night/all weather fighter unit. The Mosquitoes continued to serve until replaced by Gloster Meteor NF11s in August 1951. In November 1957 the squadron moved to RAF Acklington in Northumberland where it was re-equipped with Gloster Javelins. In July 1958 to RAF Leuchars in Scotland. In February 1963 No 29 moved to Cyprus and in December 1965 went to Ndola in Zambia for nine months on detachment during the Rhodesian crisis. A single aircraft was written off when all undercarriage legs failed to come down on 2 June 1966.

From May 1967 the squadron operated the English Electric Lightning F.3 based at RAF Wattisham near Stowmarket in Suffolk until December 1974 when they re-equipped with the McDonnell F-4 Phantom and moved to RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire. In May 1982, a detachment of 3 Phantom FGR2’s were deployed at Wideawake airstrip on Ascension Island during the Falklands War. On completion of repairs to the runway at Stanley in August 1982, the squadron deployed 10 aircraft south to the islands, the first arriving on 17 October 1982 flown by the then officer commanding Wing Commander Ian Macfadyen.

In 1987, 29 Squadron was one of the first RAF units to receive the Tornado F3, deploying to Saudi Arabia after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 and participating in Operation Desert Storm. No. 29 flew the Tornado until disbanding in 1998, as part of the Strategic Defence Review. The squadron was reformed in 2003, this time as the Typhoon operational conversion unit (OCU).

==Badge==
The badge of the squadron shows an eagle in flight preying on a buzzard, symbolising air combat. The motto in Latin is &quot;Impiger et acer&quot; - &#x27;Energetic and keen&#x27;.

==Squadron markings and the &quot;misspelled Roman numeral&quot; tradition==
Since the late 1920s, the squadron marking has been three (red) Xs (XXX). Since this closely resembles the Roman numeral for &quot;29&quot; (XXIX) there is a belief among current squadron personnel that this originated as a &quot;misspelling&quot; of the Roman numeral. Although various versions of the tradition are put forward, the most common explanation is that a mis-understood instruction to ground crew to paint &quot;2 X&#x27;s in front of the roundel and IX behind it&quot; meaning &quot;X,X,(roundel), and &#x27;IX&#x27; or &#x27;one-X&#x27;&quot; resulted in &quot;XX(roundel)&#x27;one times&#x27; X&quot;. In fact, the marking was always applied as &quot;XXX(roundel)XXX&quot; or as &quot;XXX(roundel)&quot; on smaller types, such as Siskins. Another version is that the original adoption of &quot;XXX&quot; for the 1930s squadron marking was nothing to do with Roman numerals, but was a reference to the brewers&#x27; mark for &quot;extra strong&quot;, frequently applied to kegs of beer, and that it is only a coincidence that this resembles the numeral for &quot;29&quot; (XXIX).

However, as the original squadron markings on the Gloster Grebe consisted of FOUR Xs, it is likely both versions above are apocryphal, and the four Xs were just a suitable geometric shape that were shortened to three to fit the smaller space on the Armstrong Whitworth Siskin.

<doc id="867157" wikidata="Q6151318" url="?curid=867157" title="Toyota Vitz">
<text>The is a subcompact car produced by the Japanese automobile manufacturer Toyota from 1999 to 2019 in a three- or five-door hatchback body styles. The &quot;Vitz&quot; nameplate was used consistently in Japan, while most international markets received the same vehicle as the Toyota Yaris, or as the Toyota Echo in some markets for the first generation. The Vitz was available in Japan from Toyota&#x27;s &quot;Netz Store&quot; dealerships. Toyota began production in Japan and later assembled the vehicle in other Asian countries and in France.

By 2010, the first two generations had achieved in excess of 3.5 million sales in over 70 countries, including more than 1.4 million in Japan.

In 2019, the &quot;Vitz&quot; nameplate was no longer used in Japan due to faltering sales and the unification of Toyota sales network in Japan, and the vehicle was replaced by the XP210 series Yaris. Since 2023, the nameplate is reused for a rebadged third-generation Suzuki Celerio for African markets.

== First generation (XP10/XP20; 1999) ==

The first generation XP10 series Vitz was designed by Sotiris Kovos at Toyota&#x27;s ED2 studio in Europe. It was first unveiled at the 1998 Paris Motor Show. Production began in late 1998, with a Japanese on-sale date of January 1999; European sales commenced two months later as the &quot;Toyota Yaris&quot;. When introduced to Australasia in October 1999, the &quot;Toyota Echo&quot; name was used,&lt;ref name = &quot;Toyota Echo (NCP10R /NCP12R Echo)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as was the case in Canada when released there in 2003 for the 2004 model year. The &quot;Echo&quot; and &quot;Yaris&quot; names were also given to the export version of the related Japanese market Toyota Platz sedan, also available as a coupé in North America. Often sold alongside the hatchback and marketed as a single line of vehicles, exterior panels common between the Vitz and Platz were restricted to the front doors. However, as Vitz and Platz were designed using the same platform, the mechanicals are largely identical and both share a common dashboard module. There was also a &quot;Yaris Verso&quot; or &quot;Echo Verso&quot; variant sold in some export markets from late 1999, based on the Japanese &quot;Toyota Fun Cargo&quot;. The Verso MPV utilizes the same running gear as the Vitz, but features a more spacious interior.

At its introduction in 1999, it won the Car of the Year Japan Award.

What became the XP10 series was shown earlier in concept form at the 1997 Frankfurt Motor Show. This concept, titled &quot;Funtime&quot; was developed under the leadership of Shuhei Toyoda, who also commissioned two additional models based on the same platform: the &quot;Funcoupe&quot; and the &quot;Funcargo&quot;, the predecessor to the forthcoming production model Fun Cargo. Styled in Brussels by Toyota&#x27;s &quot;European Office of Creation&quot; (EPOC), the &quot;Fun project&quot; as it was known, was envisaged to underline the versatility of shared platform engineering. These concept vehicles morphed into the &quot;New Basic Car&quot; (NBC) program, with each separate NBC model designated a number, &quot;NBC1&quot; in the case of the Vitz three-door. The name &quot;Vitz&quot; is the phonetic Anglicized spelling of the German word &quot;Witz&quot; which means &quot;wit&quot; (however, its principal meaning in contemporary German is &quot;joke&quot;). Toyota claims the contrived name &quot;Yaris&quot; is &quot;intended to convey a European impression&quot;, while &quot;Echo&quot; &quot;is intended to Echo nothing.&quot;

Instead of conventional analogue instruments, the Vitz utilized digital instruments which were mounted in a &quot;pod&quot; in the center of the dashboard. When sales commenced in the Canadian market this was not the case, with Toyota opting to fit a conventional speedometer, still mounted in the center of the dashboard.

In 2003, the facelifted &#x27;Phase 2&#x27; Vitz was released with different bumpers and &#x27;teardrop&#x27; front lights.

=== Facelift ===
=== Yaris TS / Vitz RS / Echo Sportivo ===
=== Safety ===
Euro NCAP crash tested the dual-airbag equipped XP10 series in 2000, rating the car 29 out of 37 for adult occupant protection, or four out of five stars. The pedestrian rating (pre-2002) is 13 points or two of out of four stars. In July 2004, ANCAP tested the XP10 with only a driver&#x27;s airbag fitted, resulting in a 23.64 out of 37 grading, or three out of five stars. The 2010 edition of Monash University&#x27;s &quot;Used Car Safety Ratings&quot; (UCSR), found that the XP10 provides a &quot;poor&quot; (two out of five stars) level of occupant safety protection in the event of an accident.

=== Markets ===

==== Asia ====
The Japanese launch of the Vitz occurred on 13 January 1999, and along with the related Platz, was retailed through the Netz Stores.

The Vitz &quot;RS&quot; was introduced in October 2000. The &quot;RS&quot; featured revised front and rear bumpers, a mesh grille, black-tinted headlamps, front fog lamps, side skirts and alloy wheels. Interior upgrades include, sports-oriented front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a leather and chrome gear shifter, and metallic door sill scuff plates. Two engines were available in the &quot;RS&quot;, the 1.3-litre 2NZ-FE and the 1.5-litre 1NZ-FE. More powerful brakes and a firmer suspension calibration were also fitted to the &quot;RS&quot;.

The Phase 2 Vitz RS was also available in a turbocharged version modified by Toyota Racing Development (TRD) mainly for the domestic Japanese market, and outfitted with an IHI Rhf4 turbocharger with boost. Produced in limited numbers, the TRD-tuned &quot;RS&quot; sported the 1.5-litre engine, and produced and offered a time of 7.9 seconds.

The Yaris was also sold in China as the Xiali Vizi from December 2002 to 2012, equipped with a 1.0 and 1.3-litre engine.

==== Australia ====
The XP10 series was introduced to Australia on 8 October 1999 as the &quot;Echo&quot;, replacing the Starlet. Both the three- and five-door hatchback variants were available, which sold alongside the four-door Toyota Platz-derived Echo sedan. Sourced from Japan, Australian-market Echo hatchbacks received the 1.3-litre 2NZ-FE engine with a standard five-speed manual transmission and optional four-speed automatic. The base model was fitted with a driver&#x27;s airbag and cassette player, although the optional safety pack added a passenger airbag and anti-lock brakes (ABS). Power steering was made standard equipment in October 2002. The Echo &quot;Sportivo&quot; was introduced in March 2001, fitted with the 1.5-litre 1NZ-FE engine with manual transmission only. Compared to the models equivalent to the Echo &quot;Sportivo&quot; in other markets (the Vitz &quot;RS&quot; in Japan, and Yaris &quot;T-Sport&quot; in Europe), the Australian variant is distinguishable with its locally developed T-CAM (Toyota Conversions, Accessories and Motorsport) body kit and downgraded 14-inch alloy wheels.

Sales of the facelifted hatchback range commenced in March 2003. At the same time, the price dropped and standard equipment was increased, with air conditioning, a CD player, and remote keyless entry included, although the safety pack was deleted as an option all together. Consequently, ANCAP tested the Echo in July 2004 and demoted it from a four- to a three-star safety rating. ANCAP had previously based its four-star rating on the test conducted by Euro NCAP, which was performed with the passenger airbag fitted. Following the reassessment, Toyota reintroduced the safety pack from 1 December 2004 for the 2005 model year. In June 2005, Toyota Australia launched the Echo &quot;Rush&quot; three- and five-doors. Additional equipment fitted over the base model included 14-inch alloy wheels, front power windows, and front fog lamps.

==== Europe ====
The Vitz, marketed as the &quot;Yaris&quot; in Europe, was initially available with gasoline-powered inline-four engines in displacements of 1.0 and 1.3-litres, both featuring Toyota&#x27;s VVT-i technology. The use of sophisticated engine management systems was said to give the equivalent of 1.4-litre performance from the 1.0-litre engine, while maintaining low fuel consumption and emissions. In 2001, the range was expanded via the addition of the hot hatch &quot;T Sport&quot; (equivalent to the Vitz &quot;RS&quot; in Japan), fitted with the 1.5-litre engine. After March 2002, a 1.4-litre D4-D diesel engine offering was also included in the lineup.

In most European markets, the Yaris was a stronger seller than the Starlet that it replaced. The XP10 was voted European Car of the Year in 2000, and also the 2000 Semperit Irish Car of the Year.

From 31 January 2001, the Yaris was produced in the Toyota Motor Manufacturing France (TMMF), in Onnaing, to supplement Japanese-made units.

European-market Yaris was also exported to Israel as well as in Morocco.

During the arrival of its successor, the first-generation Yaris had sold over 1.2 million units in Europe.

==== North America ====
The Vitz hatchback was not sold in North America until 2003, when it launched only in Canada under the &quot;Echo&quot; name for the 2004 model year. Prior to this, only the Platz-based Echo sedan and coupé were available in Canada. The hatchback (three and five doors) was introduced in Canada only due to the higher sales achieved by the sedan and coupé compared to the United States, where they have failed due to low demand. Minor changes were made to meet Canadian safety requirements such as larger bumpers. The Echo hatchback was offered in four different trims in Canada, the LE being the standard version available in three or five door variants. The CE was an economy version only available with three doors and did not feature power steering, a rear wiper or a four-way speaker system, while the RS was only available with five doors and featured an aero package, aluminium alloy wheels, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob along with sport seats.

Although an RS version was offered, it consisted of cosmetic changes only. All Canadian-bound Echo hatches were sold with the 1.5-litre 1NZ-FE engine and rated at .

In 2004, for the 2005 model year, a tachometer was added.

=== Yaris Cabrio Concept (2000) ===
The Yaris Cabrio concept car was presented at the March 2000 Geneva Motor Show. The Yaris Cabrio featured a fabric roof. It never reached the production stage. Another similar concept based on the XP150 series Yaris was showcased at the 23rd Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show in August 2015, being called Yaris Legian.

== Second generation (XP90; 2005) ==

Toyota redesigned the Vitz in early 2005, going on sale in Japan that February. The Yaris family (Vitz and including the Belta) was developed under the lead of chief engineer Kousuke Shibahara. While the previous generation Vitz hatchback and Platz sedan look and feel virtually alike, the redesigned XP90 Vitz and Belta are more subtly related in terms of appearance. The two cars share underpinnings, notably the frame and the drivetrain components, however the sheet metal and interior is different. While the Vitz was designed at Toyota&#x27;s European ED2 design studios, the Belta was designed at their Japanese design studios. 

The Vitz platform was larger in all metrics, to create a larger interior space on par with vehicles in the segment above. It had a short overhangs and cab-forward design. The Vitz has nine airbags for some models. 

The European, Australian, Canadian, Mexican, Venezuelan and Puerto Rican markets received the second-generation Vitz near the end of 2005. In the Australia and North America, the car was sold under the Yaris nameplate for the first time; the Belta is also sold there but with the nameplate Yaris sedan. The production Yaris for the US market was unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show in January 2006. The XP90 series Yaris was built in Japan, France, Thailand, China and Taiwan.

The previous 4-cylinder 1.0 VVT-i engine was replaced by the 3-cylinder engine also found in the Toyota Aygo. The 1.3-litre engine was revised to offer slightly more power, and the 1.4 D-4D got a boost to , the former engine allowing it to achieve exceptional fuel economy. For the European market in early 2009 the Yaris added a 1.33-litre engine with Stop &amp; Start technology. The Yaris became the first car in its class to offer nine airbags.

The Vitz also received a minor facelift in 2009 with slight subtle revisions to its bumper with in-built cornering protectors, air dams and revised tail lights.

=== Facelift ===
==== Second facelifts ====
The XP90 series Yaris continued to be built in China and Thailand until it was replaced by the XP150 model in November 2013.

In China, the Yaris received a second facelift in 2011, which has an extended front body which brings the car to measure in length and a new chrome grille.

For Thailand-made models (also exported to Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines), in February 2012 the Yaris received front and rear bumpers, rear LED tail lights from the facelifted Vitz RS/Yaris TS, and updated steering wheel.

=== Daihatsu Charade ===
From 2011 to 2013, Daihatsu sold the five-door XP90 Yaris in Europe as the Daihatsu Charade. Built in France from April 2011, powertrains comprised a 1.3-litre engine and six-speed manual or optional automatic. The Charade was sold alongside the XP130 series Toyota Yaris.


=== Vitz RS ===
The Vitz RS was launched in 2005. It is powered 1.5 L 4-cylinder VVT-i engine rated 107 bhp (80 kW) and . The RS features 16-inch alloy wheels, an RS badged mesh grille, a redesigned front and rear bumper, redesigned tail lamps, deep side skirts and a tail spoiler. It also features sports tuned steering and suspension as well as disc rear brakes.

The Vitz RS was sold in North American market equipped with the base 1.5-litre engine, and in European markets as the Yaris TS. It was first seen at the 2007 Geneva Motor Show. As with the previous T-Sport, there are extra rear reflectors on the bumper. Essentially, it is a Japanese market Vitz RS fitted with a 1.8-litre &quot;2ZR-FE&quot; engine rated and , which can reach in under 10 seconds.

For model year 2007 on Japanese models only, G-BOOK, a subscription telematics service, was offered as an option.

The Vitz RS was also a basis for the 2012 Thai-built Yaris facelift.

For the 2009 year, the Yaris 5-door liftbacks join the lineup of the existing 4-door sedans and 3-door liftbacks because of the increased demand for fuel efficient subcompact cars. In addition to the new 5-door liftback, all 2009 Yaris models come standard with anti-lock brakes (ABS), front seat-mounted side airbags and front and rear curtain side airbags. For 2009, Toyota also added cruise control as an option on liftback models, and has added a few more colour choices.

The Yaris has been praised by the automotive press for its extremely high fuel economy, but criticized for its excessive body roll (due to a soft suspension and high ride height) and the initial lack of a manual transmission on 5-door models.

The 2010 model has a 5-speed manual option for the 5-door. It also has the Star Safety System – Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) + Traction Control (TRAC), Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) with Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD) and Brake Assist.

=== Recall ===
In January 2009, Toyota recalled 1.28 million vehicles worldwide based on the Yaris platform, such as the Vitz, Belta and the Ractis. The recall is based on a seat belt defect that, in severe front-end collisions, could cause a foam pad in the vehicle to ignite.

== Third generation (XP130; 2010) ==
The third generation Vitz was introduced in December 2010 featuring a redesigned front facia, roomier interior, single windshield wiper and instrument cluster relocated in front of the driver. In European countries, the Yaris was also offered in 6-speed manual transmission for the 1.33L engine, or a CVT transmission often marketed as &quot;7-speed MultiDrive&quot; or &quot;MultiDrive S&quot;. The 7-speed refers to the possibility to select a predefined gear ratio among 7 available, emulating a 7-speed sequential gearbox, with steering wheel levers.

=== Safety ===


=== Recall ===
On 10 October 2012, Toyota recalled 7.4 million vehicles worldwide, including certain Vitz, Yaris and Corolla models, due to malfunctioning power windows. They include: 2.47 million in the United States, 1.4 million in China and 1.39 million in Europe.

=== Facelift (2014) ===
In 2014, a facelift version was introduced and marketed in North America, Europe, Australia and Japan — the latter as the &quot;Vitz&quot;. North America and Australia models featured a 1.5-litre, engine with a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic. In Europe, it was offered with a 1.33-litre engine, coupled with a six-speed manual or a CVT automatic. The facelift was designed by Toyota Europe, where previous iterations had been designed in Japan.

=== Facelift (2017) ===
On 12 January 2017, a second facelift version of the Vitz was launched in Japan. It was also offered with a hybrid drivetrain. The second facelift version of the Yaris has been available in Europe and Australia since March 2017 and in South Africa and North America since June 2017. The North American version was revealed at the April 2017 New York International Auto Show. The South African models were later replaced by the facelifted XP150 series Yaris hatchback.

=== Hybrid ===
The Yaris HSD Concept was introduced at the March 2011 Geneva Motor Show featuring a hybrid powertrain. The production version was presented at the March 2012 Geneva Motor Show, and went on sale in June 2012.

The Yaris Hybrid shares the same powertrain as the Toyota Prius c sold in North America and as the Toyota Aqua in Japan. The Prius c is not available in Europe. It has a 1.5 L gasoline engine with a maximum output of and a electric motor which combine for a total output of . Its NiMH battery has a capacity of 0.9 kWh.

The Yaris Hybrid sold 23,692 units during 2012. Cumulative sales reached 35,151 units through March 2013.

==== Second facelift ====
=== Markets ===

==== Japan ====
The third generation Vitz was launched on 22 December 2010 in Yokohama, Japan. Aerodynamic drag has been reduced with a coefficient drag value of 0.285.

This generation introduces a new 1.3-litre 4-cylinder engine which is as economical as the 1.0-litre engine, according to Toyota Japan. New features include a single windscreen wiper and an engine start-stop system with a claimed for the Japanese streets. The Vitz came with &quot;Toyota Safety Sense C&quot; package including features Lane Departure Alert, Automatic High Beam and Pre-crash safety system. Pre-crash safety system alarm will work when vehicle is between 15km/h to 140km/h, whereas automatic brakes will apply when vehicle is between 10km/h to 80km/h. The XP130 model comes with up to nine airbags: driver and front passenger airbags, front-seat mounted side airbags, a knee airbag for the driver, first and second row side-curtain airbags and two front seat cushion airbags.

The Vitz was offered in F, U, Jewela and RS model grades. The engines available range from 1.0- to 1.5-litres. The 1.5-litre RS model has a CVT transmission for the automatic, sporty front fascia and taillamps. Just like the previous generation, 2WD and 4WD drivetrains are available in Japan. The different engine size choices give Japanese drivers an option as to which annual road tax obligation they wish to pay, and larger engines are installed in vehicles with higher levels of optional equipment. On 6 September 2011, new RS G&#x27;s sport trim based from the regular RS was launched. This model has new aero bodykit, tuned suspensions, lightweight 17-inch aluminium wheels and high performance tires. The Vitz received its facelift on 21 April 2014. The F, U and Jewela models received the updated front fascia that was only marketed in Japan, while the RS model shares the front fascia with the facelifted Yaris in export markets, but with different headlamps and tail lamps (also marketed as the Yaris ZR in Australia). The RS model was discontinued and replaced by the Sporty package variant of the U model with the second facelift in January 2017. The GR Sport and GR variant of the Vitz was introduced on 19 September 2017, as part of the Gazoo Racing series lineup, replacing both RS and RS G&#x27;s trims.

In Japan, a sharp drop in sales from a height of 160,000 a year to 87,000 prompted Toyota to rebrand the Vitz as Yaris in order to expand its middle-aged customer base.

==== Europe ====
The third generation Yaris/Vitz entered production in Toyota Motor Manufacturing France plant in June 2011 and was launched in September of the same year. The Yaris Hybrid assembly started in April 2012.

Toyota Motor Manufacturing France started to build the Yaris for export to the US, Canadian and Puerto Rican markets from May 2013 until 2019.

A facelift version was introduced in 2014. Both the original and facelift share the drivetrain and transmission choices, however, the facelift claims to have improved ride comfort and interior quality among other features.

The production of the third generation Yaris in TMMF was stopped in June 2020.

==== Asia ====
In 2013, a different XP150 series Yaris which is based on the XP150 series Vios sedan was launched in some Asian markets, including many Southeast Asian regions. This version is not related to the XP130 series Vitz-based Yaris, instead, the XP150 series Yaris is based on the EFC platform.

In Singapore, the local dealer launched the XP130 series Yaris in 1.33-litre variant in the first quarter of 2013 to mid-2014. It was the only Asian country outside Japan and Hong Kong to source the Vitz-based Yaris.

==== Australia ====
The XP130 series Yaris for the Australian market was revealed at the July 2011 Australian International Motor Show held in Melbourne. The new Yaris has a sportier, more rounded grille and redesigned front bumper. The Australian Yaris comes in either a 1.3-litre or 1.5-litre powered petrol engine. Models sold are the basic YR, the mid-range YRS, YRX and the sportier ZR which features a sporty bumper with body kit. The basic YR model features 7 SRS airbags and Multi-Information Display as standard. Since the facelift in 2014, the range is 5-door only and has had a name change. They are now: Ascent for the base model, SX for the mid-range and ZR is the top level. In January 2017, there was another facelift and tech change, this bought a slightly different headlight/bumper/grill combination and Toyota Safety sense (auto high beam, lane departure alert and autonomous braking) became an option on Ascent and SX and standard on ZR.

==== United States and Canada ====
For the North American market, the XP130 series Yaris was released in the fourth quarter of 2011, for the 2012 model year, under the Yaris Liftback name. Offered in both three- and five-door hatchback styles, the Yaris Liftback offered only the previous generation&#x27;s 1.5-litre engine with a five-speed manual or optional four-speed automatic transmission. The 2012 model year three- and five-door hatchbacks were available in the base L (CE in Canada), mid-range LE and sport-tuned SE trim levels. The SE was available only as a five-door and came with larger 16-inch alloy wheels, sport-tuned suspension and disk brakes on all four wheels. For the 2012 model year, the Yaris Liftback had nine standard airbags. For the 2015 model year, it was given a facelift.

The Yaris Liftback was discontinued in the United States for the 2019 model year but remained available in Canada. In early 2019, the Mazda2-based Yaris hatchback debuted at the 2019 New York International Auto Show and replaced the Yaris Liftback in both countries.

In the US, the previous XP90 Yaris sedan was replaced by the Scion iA, a rebadged Mazda2 sedan, from the 2016 model year until the Scion marque was dropped. The iA was later renamed to the Yaris iA, and then back to the Yaris sedan. However, the Scion iA was marketed as the Yaris sedan in Canada since its introduction.

==== Vitz/Yaris GRMN ====
The Vitz/Yaris GRMN (&quot;Gazoo Racing, tuned by the Meister of the Nürburgring&quot;) is a limited-production high-performance variant of the Vitz/Yaris. There are two variants of these limited-production Vitz/Yaris. The first variant was launched in August 2013, this model is powered by a turbocharged 1.5-litre &quot;1NZ-FE Turbo&quot; engine (similar engine that powered the previous generations Vitz RS/Yaris T-Sport Turbo). This engine produces at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm. Only 200 examples of the Vitz GRMN Turbo were made and only available for the local Japanese market.

The second variant was launched in September 2017. This version is powered by a Lotus-tuned, supercharged 1.8-litre &quot;2ZR-FE&quot; engine (shared with the Series 3 Elise) that produces at 6,800 rpm and of torque at 5,000 rpm. It has a claimed acceleration in around 6.3 seconds and an electronically limited top speed of . 150 units were built for Japan and 400 units were built for Europe. It was later succeeded by the mass-produced, four-wheel drive variant of the GR Yaris.

<text>A regional language is a language spoken in a region of a sovereign state, whether it be a small area, a federated state or province or some wider area.

Internationally, for the purposes of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, &quot;regional or minority languages&quot; &quot;means languages that are:&quot;
#&quot;traditionally used within a given territory of a State by nationals of that State who form a group numerically smaller than the rest of the State&#x27;s population and&quot;
#&quot;different from the official language(s) of that State&quot;

Recognition of regional or minority languages must not be confused with recognition as an official language.

==Relationship with official languages==
In some cases, a regional language may be closely related to the state&#x27;s main language or official language. For example:

*The Frisian languages spoken in the Netherlands and Germany, which belong to the Germanic family.
*The Gutnish language, a regional language spoken in Gotland and related to the Swedish language.
*Kurdish in Kurdistan, which is an autonomous region in northern Iraq, Northwestern Iran and southeastern Turkey.
*Assyrian Neo-Aramaic in northern Iraq, northeastern Syria, southeastern Turkey and northwestern Iran.
*The several hundred Sinitic languages are nearly always replaced by Standard Chinese (based on the Beijing dialect) in writing.
**Wu, in Shanghai, southern Jiangsu, Zhejiang and eastern Jiangxi.
**Yue Chinese, in Guangdong, parts of Guangxi, Hainan, Hong Kong and Macau, Cantonese is the regional standard variety for Yue-speaking areas
**Hakka, in parts of Guangdong, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Taiwan
**Min, in Fujian, Taiwan, eastern Guangdong and Hainan.
**Xiang, in Hunan.
**Gan, in Jiangxi.
*Kashubian, a regional language of Poland, has a bit under 90 thousand speakers, and is a language of the Lechitic branch, alongside Polish and Silesian.
*Limburgish, a regional language in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, has around one million speakers and is closely related to Luxembourgish, Kleverlandish and Ripuarian.
*Low German (also referred to as Low Saxon), an officially recognized regional language in Germany and the Netherlands, the direct descendant of Old Saxon. Sometimes (e.g. by nds and nds-nl Wikipedia) considered two languages divided by today’s Netherlands–German border on account of Dutch influences in the west and German influences in the east; closely related to Frisian, more distantly to German.
*Scots, a regional language of Scotland and Northern Ireland (both part of the United Kingdom, and where it is known as Ulster Scots in the latter location), belongs to the same family of West Germanic languages as English.
*Neapolitan, Sicilian and Venetian, regional languages spoken in Italy which also belong to the same family of standard Italian (Italo-Dalmatian).
*Regional languages of Spain and Portugal:
**Aranese, Catalan, and Galician are each, in the regions where they are the autochthonous language, co-official in status with Castilian (Spanish) which is official everywhere in the Kingdom of Spain.
**Asturian and Leonese are recognized (but unofficial) in Asturias and Castile and León (Spain), while Mirandese is co-official with Portuguese in Miranda do Douro (Portugal). These Romance languages are classified under the term Astur-Leonese languages. Astur-Leonese is closely related to both Castilian and Galician, which itself is most closely related to Portuguese. Catalan is an Occitano-Romance language.
**Occitan, most widely spoken across the Pyrenees in France and Catalonia, together with Catalan, forms a subgroup of Romance languages linguistically intermediate between French and the Ibero-Romance languages of Spain and Portugal. Aranese is a subdialect of Gascon
*Tibetic languages
**Amdo tibetan language have regional official status in amdo or Qinghai.
**Standard Tibetan is currently based on Lhasa Tibetan.
*Võro and Seto, regional languages of Estonia, are either dialects of Estonian or separate Finnic languages as Estonian.
*Walloon, a regional language of France and Belgium, belongs to the same family of Oïl languages as French.
*Hindi and English are the official languages of India&#x27;s Central Government.
**The officially declared regional languages of India are: Assamese, Bengali, Bodo, Dogri, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri, Konkani, Maithili, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Nepali, Odia, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Santali, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu. Most are Indo-Aryan languages like Hindi and descend from Sanskrit, but 4 (Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam) are Dravidian languages, 2 (Bodo and Manipuri) are Sino-Tibetan, and Santali is a Munda language. In addition, there have been demands for 38 more languages to receive recognition.
*Sylheti, a regional language of the Sylhet Division of Bangladesh and the Barak Valley of Assam, India, is often considered a dialect of Bengali but is also sometimes seen as a separate language.
*Chittagonian, a regional language of parts of the Chittagong Division of Bangladesh, is often considered a dialect of Bengali but is also sometimes seen as a separate language.

In other cases, a regional language may be very different from the state&#x27;s main language or official language. For example:

*Basque, a regional language spoken in Spain and France (Basque Country).
*Breton, a regional Celtic language spoken in France (Brittany).
*Cherokee is an Iroquoian language, and one of the many Native American languages spoken in the U.S. State of Oklahoma.
*Cornish, a regional Celtic language in the United Kingdom (Cornwall).
*Corsican, a regional language in France (Corsica) closely related to Tuscan-derived Italian.
*Gagauz, a regional Turkic language spoken in Moldova.
*Livonian, a regional language of the Finnic family spoken in Latvia.
*Resian, a dialect of Slovene spoken in Italy (Resia valley).
*Sardinian, a regional Romance language spoken in Italy (Sardinia).
*Scottish Gaelic, a regional Celtic language spoken in the United Kingdom (Scotland).
*Sorbian, a regional Slavic language of Germany.
*Welsh, a regional Celtic language spoken in the United Kingdom (Wales).

==Official languages as regional languages==
An official language of a country may also be spoken as a regional language in a region of a neighbouring country. For example:
*Afrikaans, an official language of South Africa, is a regional language of Namibia.
*Arabic, official in Zanzibar, a region of Tanzania.
*Bengali is the official language of Bangladesh, and is the regional language of West Bengal in India.
*Bulgarian is the official language of Bulgaria, and is the regional language of Albania, Czech Republic,Hungary,Moldova, Romania, Serbia, Turkey, and Ukraine.
*Cantonese, one of the official standard varieties in Hong Kong and Macau (both special administrative regions of the People&#x27;s Republic of China), is used as a regional language of the province of Guangdong, People&#x27;s Republic of China.
*Catalan, the official language of Andorra, is a regional language in Spain (Catalonia, Balearic Islands and Valencian Community), France (Pyrénées Orientales) and Italy (Alghero, Sardinia).
*German, an official language of Austria, Belgium, Germany, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and Switzerland, is a regional language in Italy (South Tyrol), Poland (Silesia), France (Alsace and Lorraine), Denmark (Southern), Namibia, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Venezuela.

<text>Wormley is a village in the civil parish of Witley and Milford, in the Waverley district, in Surrey, England, around Witley station, off the A283 Petworth Road about SSW of Godalming.

==History==
===Expansion from archetypal hamlet===
Wormley developed primarily as a result of the construction in the 19th century of Witley station, on the Portsmouth Direct line. King Edward&#x27;s School, Witley once had its own station platform.

===Former businesses===
Cooper &amp; Sons Ltd owned the Combelane walking stick factory; this was replaced by houses with small gardens and a light industrial estate. The Institute of Oceanographic Sciences Deacon Laboratory was here from 1952 to 1995, housed in the former Admiralty Signals Establishment building on Brook Road. The only public house, the &quot;Wood Pigeon&quot;, closed in 2007.

==Architecture and gardens==
King Edward&#x27;s School is a Grade II listed building, the school war memorial is also Grade II listed. Gertrude Jekyll designed the gardens at Tigbourne Court and Wood End, houses both designed by Edward Lutyens.

==Notable former residents==
* George Eliot (1819–1880) is a former resident.
* Gertrude Mary Tuckwell (1861–1951) lived the last twenty years of her life in Little Woodlands, Combe Lane.
* Louis de Bernières (b. 1954) who based his collection of short stories, &quot;Notwithstanding&quot;, on the local area. In the afterword of the book, De Bernières muses whether Wormley is, or is no longer, the rural idyll.

<text>An operational conversion unit (OCU) is a unit within an air force whose role is to support preparation for the operational missions of a specific aircraft type by providing trained personnel. Operational conversion units teach pilots how to fly an aircraft and which tactics best exploit the performance of their aircraft and its weapons. The Royal Air Force and Royal Australian Air Force, among others, practise this method of training. The United States Navy calls its units in this role &quot;fleet replacement squadrons&quot;.

An example of an OCU is No. 29 Squadron RAF, which was the second RAF squadron to receive the Eurofighter Typhoon.

The Royal Australian Air Force has a number of OCUs. These include No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit, No. 6 Squadron and No. 292 Squadron. These units are responsible for converting aircrews to the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, F/A-18F Super Hornet and Boeing P-8 Poseidon aircraft, respectively.

No. 42 Squadron RNZAF Is the only OCU in the Royal New Zealand Air Force. It flies the RNZAF&#x27;s 4 Beechcraft Super King Air B200 in a Twin Engine conversion role. Until 2001 the RNZAF had No. 2 Squadron RNZAF. It flew the TA-4K Skyhawk in a Fighter Conversion Role but was mothballed along with the rest of the RNZAF&#x27;s Air Combat Wing in 2001.

Royal Air Force OCUs have their origins in the post-war period. Before the Second World War, operational training was carried out in the squadron itself. With the coming of war, this method of training was no longer possible and some squadrons were reassigned to training duties. These were later renamed as &quot;operational training units&quot; (OTU) and in practice were larger than operational squadrons.

<text>Konrad &quot;Conny&quot; Bauer (born 4 July 1943) is a German free jazz trombonist. He is the brother of the trombonist Johannes Bauer.

As a student at senior high school in Sonneberg between 1957 and 1961, he was enthusiastic about modern music and dance genres such as swing, boogie-woogie, blues and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, and taught himself to play guitar and piano. After leaving school with A-levels, he tried to play his music in several bands and was nicknamed &quot;Conny&quot; by his friends.

After recognizing that he did not know enough about music to become a professional musician, Bauer studied modern dance music from 1964 to 1968 at the Carl Maria von Weber-Music school Conservatory in Dresden. Because too many students wanted to study guitar, he entered the trombone class, having had some experience of playing the instrument. In 1968 he left the conservatory for Berlin to improve his skills with private lessons. From 1969 until 1971 he started his career as guitarist and singer in the band of Ernst-Ludwig Petrowsky. He also began a career as a trombone soloist in 1970.

During the second half of the 1970s Bauer became a prominent jazz player in European free jazz. He helped found numerous groups which influenced the development of jazz in East Germany: these included FEZ and its successive quartet and trio formations, the Doppelmoppel quartet, and Synopsis/Zentralquartett with Ernst-Ludwig Petrowsky, Ulrich Gumpert and Günter &quot;Baby&quot; Sommer. He was featured in a profile on composer Graham Collier in the 1985 Channel 4 documentary &#x27;Hoarded Dreams&#x27;. In 1986 he toured Japan for several weeks, encountering numerous Japanese musicians. From 1988 to 1989 he directed the National Jazz Orchestra of the former East Germany. Since 1983 he has worked with artists such as Tadashi Endo, Sheryl Banks, Tony Oxley, Derek Bailey, Maggie Nicols, Theo Jörgensmann, Peter Brötzmann, Barre Phillips, Peter Kowald, Han Bennink, Barry Altschul, Jay Oliver, Louis Moholo, Gerry Hemingway, and George E. Lewis.

In 2004 Bauer was awarded the German SWR jazz prize especially for his solo recordings &quot;Hummelsummen&quot;. As unaccompanied soloist Bauer uses multiphonics, with matchless &quot;circular breathing techniques&quot; he conjures his own loops.

<doc id="867176" wikidata="Q2407769" url="?curid=867176" title="History of rugby union">
<text>The history of rugby union follows from various football games long before the 19th century, but it was not until the middle of that century that the rules were formulated and codified. The code of football later known as rugby union can be traced to three events: the first set of written rules in 1845, the Blackheath Club&#x27;s decision to leave the Football Association in 1863 and the formation of the Rugby Football Union in 1871. The code was originally known simply as &quot;rugby football&quot;. It was not until a schism in 1895, over the payment of players, which resulted in the formation of the separate code of rugby league, that the name &quot;rugby union&quot; was used to differentiate the original rugby code. For most of its history, rugby was a strictly amateur football code, and the sport&#x27;s administrators frequently imposed bans and restrictions on players who they viewed as professional. It was not until 1995 that rugby union was declared an &quot;open&quot; game, and thus professionalism was sanctioned by the code&#x27;s governing body, World Rugby—then known as the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB).

== Antecedents of rugby union ==
Primitive forms of football included harpastum, played by the Roman where two opposing teams competed to throw a large ball into an opposition net, fighting for possession of the ball. Medieval Irishmen played caid, carrying an inflated bladder and using arched trees as goals. The Welsh played an inter-parish game using a wooden ball called cnapan. Frenchmen played soule and Georgians played lelo burti.

Other forms of traditional football similar to rugby have been played throughout Europe and beyond. Many of these involved handling of the ball, and scrummaging formations. For example, New Zealand had Ki-o-rahi, Australia marn grook, Japan kemari, the Scottish Borders Jeddart Ba&#x27; and Cornwall Cornish hurling, Central Italy Calcio Fiorentino, East Anglia Campball.

The first detailed description of what was almost certainly football in England was given by William FitzStephen in about 1174–1183. He described the activities of London youths during the annual festival of Shrove Tuesday:
:&quot;After lunch all the youth of the city go out into the fields to take part in a ball game. The students of each school have their own ball; the workers from each city craft are also carrying their balls. Older citizens, fathers, and wealthy citizens come on horseback to watch their juniors competing, and to relive their own youth vicariously: you can see their inner passions aroused as they watch the action and get caught up in the fun being had by the carefree adolescents&quot;.

Numerous attempts were made to ban football games, particularly the most rowdy and disruptive forms. This was especially the case in England, and in other parts of Europe, during the Middle Ages and early modern period. Between 1324 and 1667, in England alone, football was banned by more than 30 royal and local laws. The need to repeatedly proclaim such laws demonstrated the difficulty in enforcing bans on popular games. King Edward II was so troubled by the unruliness of football in London that, on 13 April 1314, he issued a proclamation banning it:

:&quot;Forasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large balls from which many evils may arise which God forbid; we command and forbid, on behalf of the King, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future.&quot;

In 1531, Sir Thomas Elyot wrote that English &quot;Footeballe is nothinge but beastlie furie and extreme violence&quot;.

Football games that included ball carrying continued to be played over the century, right up to the time of William Webb Ellis&#x27;s alleged invention. One form, recorded as early as 1440 and which persisted until the 19th century, was an East Anglian game called variously Camping, Campan, Camp-ball and Campyon which was explicitly based on carrying the ball and tossing it from player to player in order to continue the advance. According to an observer writing in 1823 (coincidentally the year of rugby&#x27;s &quot;invention&quot;),

:&quot;Each party has two goals, ten or fifteen yards apart. The parties, ten or fifteen on a side, stand in line, facing each other at about ten yards&#x27; distance midway between their goals and that of their adversaries. An indifferent spectator throws up a ball the size of a cricket ball midway between the confronted players and makes his escape. The rush is to catch the falling ball. He who first can catch or seize it speeds home, making his way through his opponents and aided by his own sidesmen. If caught and held or rather in danger of being held, for if caught with the ball in possession he loses a snotch, he throws the ball (he must in no case give it) to some less beleaguered friend more free and more in breath than himself, who if it be not arrested in its course or be jostled away by the eager and watchful adversaries, catches it; and he in like manner hastens homeward, in like manner pursued, annoyed and aided, winning the notch or snotch if he contrive to carry or throw it within the goals. At a loss and gain of a snotch a recommencement takes place.&quot;

=== Early history ===

&quot;Football&quot; as a game was well established by 1803 at Rugby school and by the 1830s, &quot;running in&quot; with the ball in hand was allowed but subject to hacking and &quot;collaring&quot;.

Playing football has been a long tradition in England and versions of football had probably been played at Rugby School for 200 years before three boys published the first set of written rules in 1845. The rules had always been determined by the pupils instead of the masters and they were frequently modified with each new intake. Rule changes, such as the legality of carrying or running with the ball, were often agreed shortly before the commencement of a game. There were thus no formal rules for football during the time that William Webb Ellis was at the school (1816–25) and the story of the boy &quot;who with a fine disregard for the rules of football as played in his time, first took the ball in his arms and ran with it&quot; in 1823 is . The story first appeared in 1876, some four years after the death of Webb Ellis, and is attributed to a local antiquarian and former Rugbeian Matthew Bloxam. Bloxam was not a contemporary of Webb Ellis and vaguely quoted an unnamed person as informing him of the incident that had supposedly happened 53 years earlier. The story has been dismissed as unlikely since an official investigation by the Old Rugbeian Society in 1895. However, the cup for the Rugby World Cup is named the Webb Ellis trophy in his honour, and a plaque at the school commemorates the &quot;achievement&quot;.

Rugby football has strong claims to the world&#x27;s first and oldest &quot;football club&quot;: the Guy&#x27;s Hospital Football Club, formed in London in 1843, by old boys from Rugby School. Around the English-speaking world, a number of other clubs formed to play games based on the Rugby School rules. One of these, Dublin University Football Club, founded in 1854, has arguably become the world&#x27;s oldest surviving football club in any code. The Blackheath Football Club, in London, founded in 1858 is the oldest surviving non-university/school rugby club. Cheltenham College 1844, Sherborne School 1846 and Durham School 1850 are the oldest documented school&#x27;s clubs. Francis Crombie and Alexander Crombie introduced rugby into Scotland via Durham School in 1854. The first rugby club in Wales was at St David&#x27;s College, Lampeter, founded in around 1850 by Rowland Williams.

Until the late 1860s, rugby was played with a leather ball with an inner-bladder made of a pig&#x27;s bladder. The shape of the bladder imparted a vaguely oval shape to the ball, but they were far more spherical in shape than they are today. A quote from &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s Schooldays&quot;, written by Thomas Hughes (who attended Rugby School from 1834 to 1842), shows that the ball was not a complete sphere:


In 1851, a football of the kind used at Rugby School was exhibited at the first World&#x27;s Fair, the Great Exhibition in London. This ball can still be seen at the Webb Ellis Rugby Football Museum and it has a definite ovoid shape. In 1862, Richard Lindon introduced rubber bladders and, because of the pliability of the rubber, balls could be manufactured with a more pronounced shape. As an oval ball was easier to handle, a gradual flattening of the ball continued over the years as the emphasis of the game moved towards handling and away from dribbling. In 1892, the RFU included compulsory dimensions for the ball for the first time in the Laws of the Game. In the 1980s, leather-encased balls, which were prone to water-logging, were replaced with balls encased in synthetic waterproof materials.

=== The schism between the Football Association and rugby football ===
The Football Association (FA) was formed at the Freemason&#x27;s Tavern, Great Queen Street, on Lincoln Inn Fields, London, on 26 October 1863, with the intention of framing a code of laws that would embrace the best and most acceptable points of all the various methods of play under the one heading of &quot;football&quot;. At the beginning of the fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the fact that a number of newspapers had recently published of the Cambridge rules. The Cambridge rules differed from the draft FA rules in two significant areas, namely &quot;running with the ball&quot; and &quot;hacking&quot; (kicking an opponent in the shins). The two contentious draft rules were as follows:

At the fifth meeting, a motion was proposed that these two rules be expunged from the FA rules. Francis Maule Campbell, a member of the Blackheath Club, argued that hacking is an essential element of &quot;football&quot; and that to eliminate hacking would &quot;do away with all the courage and pluck from the game, and I will be bound over to bring over a lot of Frenchmen who would beat you with a week&#x27;s practice&quot;. At the sixth meeting, on 8 December, Campbell withdrew the Blackheath Club, explaining that the rules that the FA intended to adopt would destroy the game and all interest in it. Other rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the Football Association.

=== The formation of the first rugby union ===
On 4 December 1870, Edwin Ash of Richmond and Benjamin Burns of Blackheath published a letter in &quot;The Times&quot; suggesting that &quot;those who play the rugby-type game should meet to form a code of practice as various clubs play to rules which differ from others, which makes the game difficult to play&quot;. On 26 January 1871, a meeting attended by representatives from 21 clubs was held in London at the Pall Mall restaurant.

The 21 clubs and schools (all from London or the Home Counties) attended the meeting: Addison, Belsize Park, Blackheath (represented by Burns and Frederick Stokes the latter becoming the first captain of England), Civil Service, Clapham Rovers, Flamingoes, Gipsies, Guy&#x27;s Hospital, Harlequins, King&#x27;s College, Lausanne, The Law Club, Marlborough Nomads, Mohicans, Queen&#x27;s House, Ravenscourt Park, Richmond, St Paul&#x27;s, Wellington College, West Kent, and Wimbledon Hornets. The one notable omission was the Wasps who &quot;In true rugby fashion … turned up at the wrong pub, on the wrong day, at the wrong time and so forfeited their right to be called Founder Members&quot;.

As a result of this meeting, the Rugby Football Union (RFU) was founded. Algernon Rutter was elected as the first president of the RFU and Edwin Ash was elected as treasurer. Three lawyers, who were Rugby School alumni (Rutter, Holmes and L.J. Maton), drew up the first laws of the game; these were approved in June 1871.

=== First international game ===

The first international football game resulted from a challenge issued in the sporting weekly &quot;Bell&#x27;s Weekly&quot; on 8 December 1870 and signed by the captains of five Scottish clubs, inviting any team &quot;selected from the whole of England&quot; to a 20-a-side game to be played under the Rugby rules. The game was played at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh, the home ground of Edinburgh Academicals, on 27 March 1871.

This is not only the first international rugby match, but the first international of any form of football because, despite the fact that three England v Scotland fixtures had already been played according to association football rules at The Oval, London, in 1870 and 1871, these are not considered full internationals by FIFA as the players competing in the Scotland team were London-based players who claimed a Scottish family connection rather than being truly Scottish players.

The English team wore all white with a red rose on their shirts and the Scots wore brown shirts with a thistle and white cricket flannels. The England team was captained by Frederick Stokes of Blackheath, that representing Scotland was led by Francis Moncrieff; the umpire was Hely Hutchinson Almond, headmaster of Loretto School.

The game, played over two-halves, each of 50 minutes, was won by Scotland, who scored a goal with a successful conversion kick after grounding the ball over the goal line (permitting them to &#x27;try&#x27; to kick a goal). Both sides achieved a further &#x27;try&#x27; each, but failed to convert them to goals as the kicks were missed (see also &#x27;Method of Scoring and Points&#x27; below). Angus Buchanan of Royal High School FP and Edinburgh University RFC was the first man to score a try in international rugby.

In a return match at the Kennington Oval, London, in 1872, England were the winners.

=== Growth within the British Empire ===
According to Rugby Australia, rugby football was an extremely early introduction to Australia, with games of the primitive code being played in the early to mid-19th century, and the first formal team, Sydney University Football Club being set up in 1864. In 1869, Newington College was the first Australian school to play rugby in a match against the University of Sydney. From this beginning, the first metropolitan competition in Australia developed, formally beginning in 1874. This was organised by the Southern Rugby Union, which was administered by the rugby union at Twickenham, in England. Administration was given over to the Southern Rugby Union in 1881.

Introduction to New Zealand came later, but formal development took place around the same time as Australia. Christchurch Football Club was founded in 1863 and is regarded as the oldest rugby club in the country, with records of a &quot;football&quot; match played in August 1863. However, they did not &#x27;change&#x27; to rugby football rules until after the 1868 formation of the Nelson Rugby Football Club. Rugby football was first introduced to New Zealand in 1870 by Charles John Monro, son of the then-Speaker of the House of Representatives, David Monro. He encountered the game while studying at Christ&#x27;s College Finchley, in East Finchley, London, England, and on his return introduced the game to Nelson College, who played the first rugby union match against Nelson football club on 14 May. By the following year, the game had been formalised in Wellington, and subsequently rugby was taken up in Wanganui and Auckland in 1873 and Hamilton in 1874. It is thought that by the mid-1870s, the game had been taken up by the majority of the colony.
When Canon George Ogilvie became headmaster of Diocesan College in Cape Town, South Africa in 1861, he introduced the game of football, as played at Winchester College. This version of football, which included handling of the ball, is seen as the beginnings of rugby in South Africa. In around 1875 rugby began to be played in the Cape Colony, the following year the first rugby (as opposed to Winchester football) club was formed. Former England international William Henry Milton arrived in Cape Town in 1878. He joined the Villagers club and started playing and preaching rugby. By the end of that year, Cape Town had all but abandoned the Winchester game in favour of rugby. In 1883, the Stellenbosch club was formed in the predominantly Boer farming district outside Cape Town and rugby was enthusiastically adopted by the young Boer farmers. As British and Boer migrated to the interior, they helped spread the game from the Cape colony through the Eastern Cape, and Natal, and along the gold and diamond routes to Kimberley and Johannesburg. However, for a number of years, South African rugby would be hindered by systemic racial segregation.

Early forms of rugby football were being played in the Canadas and other nearby British colonies from 1823 onwards, in towns such as Halifax, Montreal and Toronto. Rugby football proper in Canada dates to the 1860s. Introduction of the game and its early growth is usually credited to settlers from Britain and the British army and navy in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Esquimalt, British Columbia. In 1864, the first recorded game of rugby in Canada took place in Montreal amongst artillery men. It is most likely that rugby got its start in British Columbia in the late 1860s or early 1870s, when brief mentions of &quot;football&quot; appeared in print. Canadian rugby, however, soon evolved into Canadian football.

=== Competition and influence on other football codes ===

Rugby league and association football were not the only early competitors to rugby union. In the late 19th century, a number of &quot;national&quot; football codes emerged around the world, including Australian rules football (originating in Victoria), Gaelic football (Ireland), and the gridiron codes: American and Canadian football.

Some of these codes took direct influence from rugby union, or rugby football, but all of these involved kicking and carrying the ball towards posts, meaning that they were in direct competition with rugby union. While American, Canadian, and Australian rules football are professional, and so competed for rugby union players&#x27; economic attentions, Gaelic football has remained staunchly amateur. The former three also use an oblong ball, superficially similar in appearance to a rugby football.

Tom Wills, the founder of Australian rules football, was educated at Rugby School. In Melbourne, in 1858, he umpired and played in several football matches using experimental rules. It was reported that &quot;exceptions were taken … to some of the Rugby regulations&quot;, and on 17 May 1859 Wills chaired a meeting to incorporate the Melbourne Football Club in which the club&#x27;s rules (later the laws of Australian Football) were written down for the first time. While Wills was a fan of the rugby rules, his intentions were clear that he favoured rules that suited the drier and harder Australian fields. Geoffrey Blainey, Leonie Sandercock, Ian Turner and Sean Fagan have all written in support for the theory that rugby football was one of the primary influences on Australian rules football along with other games emanating from English public schools.

American football resulted from several major divergences from rugby from 1869 onwards, most notably the rule changes instituted by Walter Camp, considered the &quot;Father of American Football&quot;. Among these important changes were the introduction of the line of scrimmage and of down-and-distance rules. Later developments such as the forward pass, and professionalism in American football made it diverge even further from its rugby origins.

Michael Cusack, one of the founders of the Gaelic Athletic Association, had been known as a rugby player in Ireland, and was involved with the game at Blackrock College and Clongowes Wood College. Cusack was a native Irishman who had been concerned with the decline of Irish football codes. Cusack, along with others, codified Gaelic football in 1887. The GAA retained some hostility to rugby and soccer until recent years, through its Rule 42, which prohibits the use of GAA property for games with interests in conflict with the interests of the GAA – such games are referred to by some as &quot;garrison games&quot; or &quot;foreign sports&quot;. In practice, the rule has only been applied to the sports of soccer, and rugby, which were perceived to be rivals to the playing of Gaelic games.

Not all such codes were successful – Swedish football was created from a mixture of rugby and soccer rules, but was overtaken by soccer.

=== International appeal ===
By the end of the 19th century, rugby football and rugby union had spread far and wide. This spread was by no means confined to the British Empire.
Rugby football was an early arrival in Germany. The first German rugby team existed at Neuenheim College – now called Heidelberg College – in Heidelberg. Around 1850, the game started to attract the attention of the students. Students under the guidance of the teacher Edward Hill Ullrich were the ones who then founded the rugby department of the Heidelberger Ruderklub von 1872/Heidelberger Flaggenklub was established. (HRK 1872) in 1891, which today claims to be the oldest German rugby club. The oldest still existing rugby department within a club is that of DSV 78 Hannover, formed in 1878 by Ferdinand-Wilhelm Fricke. German rugby has traditionally been centred on Heidelberg and Hanover, but has spread over the entire country in recent decades.

In the United States, rugby football-like games were being played early. For example, Princeton University students played a game called &quot;ballown&quot; in 1820. All of these games remained largely &quot;mob&quot; style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary. By the 1840s, Harvard, Yale and Princeton were all playing rugby football stemming partly from Americans who had been educated in English schools. However, in 1862, Yale dealt it a major blow by banning it for being too violent and dangerous. Unfortunately, American football&#x27;s growth came at exactly the point at which rugby was beginning to establish itself in the States: in 1869, the first game of American football was played between Princeton and Rutgers, with rules substantially identical to rugby. However, by 1882, the rules&#x27; innovations of Walter Camp, like the snap and downs, had distinguished the American game from rugby.
Rugby union also reached South America early, a continent with few British colonies. The first rugby union match in Argentina was played in 1873, the game having been brought to South America by the British. In 1886 Buenos Aires Football Club played Rosario Athletic Club in Buenos Aires. Early Argentinian rugby was not immune to political problems either. An 1890 game in Buenos Aires resulted in both teams, and all 2,500 spectators being arrested. National president Juárez Celman was particularly paranoid after the Revolution of the Park in the city earlier in the year, and the police had suspected that the match was in fact a political meeting. Rugby reached neighbouring Uruguay early, but it is disputed just how early. Cricket clubs were the incubators of rugby in South America, although rugby has survived much better in these countries than cricket has. It has been claimed that Montevideo Cricket Club (MVCC) played rugby football as early as 1865, but the first certain match was between Uruguayans and British members of the MVCC in 1880. The MVCC claims to be the oldest rugby club outside Europe.

Rugby also appears to have been the first (non-indigenous) football code to be played in Russia, around a decade before the introduction of association football. Mr Hopper, a Scotsman, who worked in Moscow arranged a match in the 1880s; the first soccer match was in 1892. In 1886, however, the Russian police clamped down on rugby because they considered it &quot;brutal, and liable to incite demonstrations and riots&quot;

=== The formation of the International Rugby Football Board ===
In 1884, England had a disagreement with Scotland over a try that England had scored but that the referee disallowed citing a foul by Scotland. England argued that the referee should have played advantage and that, as they made the Law, if they said it was a try then it was. The International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) was formed by Scotland, Ireland and Wales in 1886; but England refused to join, since they believed that they should have greater representation on the board because they had a greater number of clubs. They also refused to accept that the IRFB should be the recognised lawmaker of the game. The IRFB agreed that the member countries would not play England until the RFU agreed to join and accept that the IRFB would oversee the games between the home unions. England finally agreed to join in 1890. In 1930, it was agreed between the members that all future matches would be played under the laws of the IRFB. In 1997, the IRFB moved its headquarters from London to Dublin and a year later it changed its name to the International Rugby Board (IRB); in 2014, it changed its name again to the current World Rugby (WR).

==== Evolution of the laws of the game ====
Changes to the laws of the game have been made at various times and this process still continues day

==== Number of players ====
The number of players on the field for each team was reduced from 20 to 15 a side in 1877.

==== Method of scoring and points ====
Historically, no points at all were awarded for a try, the reward being to &quot;try&quot; to score a goal (to kick the ball over the cross bar and between the posts). Modern points scoring was introduced in the late 1880s, and was uniformly accepted by the Home Nations for the 1890/91 season.

The balance in value between tries and conversions has changed greatly over the years. Until 1891, a try scored one point, a conversion two. For the next two years, tries scored two points and conversion three. In 1893, the modern pattern of tries scoring more was begun, with three points awarded for a try, two for a kick. The number of points from a try increased to four in 1971 and five in 1992.

Penalties have been worth three points since 1891 (they previously had been worth two points). The value of the drop goal was four points between 1891 and 1948, three points at all other times.

Before the 1937–38 northern hemisphere season, whenever a team chose to take a penalty kick, the offending team formed up at the point of the penalty, with the kicker retreating. Ever since, penalty kicks have been taken from the spot of the penalty, with the offending team required to retreat at least 10 yards toward their own try line.

The goal from mark was made invalid in 1977, having been worth three points, except between 1891 and 1905 when it was worth four. The field goal was also banned in 1905 after previously being worth 4.

The defence was originally allowed to attempt to charge down a conversion kick from the moment the ball was placed on the ground, generally making it impossible for the kicker to place the ball himself and make any kind of a run-up. As a result, teams had a designated placer, typically the scrum-half, who would time the placement to coincide with the kicker&#x27;s run-up. In 1958, the law governing conversions changed to today&#x27;s version, which allows the kicker to place the ball and prohibits the defence from advancing toward the kicker until he begins his run-up.

=== The beginning of rugby sevens ===

Rugby sevens was initially conceived by Ned Haig, a Jedburgh butcher who moved to Melrose, and David Sanderson as a fund-raising event for a local club in 1883. The first ever sevens match was played at the &quot;Greenyards&quot;, the Melrose RFC ground, where it was well received. Two years later, Tynedale was the first non-Scottish club to win one of the Borders Sevens titles at Gala in 1885.

Despite sevens&#x27; popularity in the Scottish Borders, it did not catch on elsewhere until after WWI, in the 1920s and 1930s. The first sevens tournament outside Scotland was the Percy Park Sevens at North Shields in north east England in 1921. Because it was not far from the Scottish Borders, it attracted interest from the code&#x27;s birthplace, and the final was contested between Selkirk (who won) and Melrose RFC (who didn&#x27;t). In 1926, England&#x27;s major tournament, the Middlesex Sevens was set up by Dr J.A. Russell-Cargill, a London-based Scot.

=== The schism between union and league ===
It is believed that Yorkshire inaugurated amateurism rules in 1879; their representatives along with Lancashire&#x27;s, are credited with formalising the RFU&#x27;s first amateur rules in 1886. Despite popular belief, these Northern bodies were strong advocates of amateurism, leading numerous crusades against veiled professionalism. However, conflict arose over the controversy regarding broken time, the issue of whether players should receive compensation for taking time off work to play. The northern clubs were heavily working class, and thus, a large pool of players had to miss matches due to working commitments, or forego pay to play rugby. In 1892, charges of professionalism were laid against rugby football clubs in Bradford and Leeds, both in Yorkshire, after they compensated players for missing work, but these were not the first allegation towards these northern bodies, nor was it unheard of for southern clubs to be faced with similar circumstances. The RFU became concerned that these broken time payments were a pathway to professionalism.

This was despite the fact that the Rugby Football Union (RFU) was allowing other players to be paid, such as the 1888 England team that toured Australia, and the account of Harry Hamill of his payments to represent New South Wales (NSW) against England in 1904.

In 1893, Yorkshire clubs complained that southern clubs were over-represented on the RFU committee and that committee meetings were held in London at times that made it difficult for northern members to attend. By implication, they were arguing that this affected the RFU&#x27;s decisions on the issue of &quot;broken time&quot; payments (as compensation for the loss of income) to the detriment of northern clubs, who made up the majority of English rugby clubs. The professional Football League had been formed in 1888, comprising 12 association football (soccer) clubs from northern England, and this may have inspired the northern rugby officials to form their own professional league.

On 29 August 1895, at a meeting at the George Hotel, Huddersfield, 20 clubs from Yorkshire, Lancashire and Cheshire decided to resign from the RFU and form the Northern Rugby Football Union, which from 1922 was known as the Rugby Football League. In 1908, eight clubs in Sydney, Australia, broke away from union and formed the New South Wales Rugby League. The dispute about payment was one which at the time was also affecting soccer and cricket. Each game had to work out a compromise; rugby&#x27;s stance was the most radical. Amateurism was strictly enforced, and anyone accepting payment or playing rugby league was banned. It would be a century before union legalised payments to players and would allow players who had played a game of league, even at an amateur level, to play in a union game.

== 20th century ==

=== Summer Olympics ===
Pierre de Coubertin, the revivor of the Olympics, introduced rugby union to the Summer Olympics at the 1900 games in Paris. Coubertin had previous associations with the game, refereeing the first French domestic championship as well as France&#x27;s first international. France, the German Empire and Great Britain all entered teams in the 1900 games (Great Britain was represented by Moseley RFC), Germany by the SC 1880 Frankfurt. France won gold defeating both opponents. The rugby event drew the largest crowd at that particular games. Rugby was next played at the 1908 games in London. A Wallaby team, on tour in the United Kingdom, took part in the event, winning the gold, defeating Great Britain who were represented by a team from Cornwall. The United States won the next event, at the 1920 Summer Olympics, defeating the French. The Americans repeated their achievement at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, again defeating France. Though rugby had attracted bigger crowds than the track and field events in 1924, it was dropped from next Games and has not been included since.

In October 2009, the International Olympic Committee voted to return a form of rugby to the Olympics, with rugby sevens contested for the first time in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.

=== 1900s and early 1910s ===
Between 1905 and 1908, all three major Southern Hemisphere rugby countries sent their first touring teams to the Northern Hemisphere: New Zealand in 1905, followed by South Africa in 1906 and then Australia in 1908. All three teams brought new styles of play, fitness levels and tactics, and were far more successful than critics had expected. The New Zealand 1905 touring team performed a haka before each match, leading Welsh Rugby Union administrator Tom Williams to suggest that Wales player Teddy Morgan lead the crowd in singing the Welsh National Anthem, &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot;, as a response. After Morgan began singing, the crowd joined in: the first time a national anthem was sung at the start of a sporting event. In 1905, France played England in its first international match.

=== World War I ===


The Five Nations Championship was suspended in 1915 and was not resumed until 1920, though in Britain in 1919, a tournament was arranged between Forces teams; it was won by the New Zealand Army.

One hundred and thirty-three international players were killed during the conflict. The Queensland Rugby Union was disbanded after the war and was not reformed until 1929. NSW took responsibility for rugby union in Australia until the formation of the Australian Rugby Union, now known as Rugby Australia, in 1949.

=== 1920s ===
==== Centenary of rugby ====
As 1923 approached, there were discussions of a combined England and Wales XV playing a Scottish-Irish team in celebration of when William Webb Ellis picked up the football and ran with it in 1823. The planned game was controversial in that there was a disagreement over whether it should be held at Rugby School, or be played at Twickenham, where an obviously larger crowd could witness the match. In the end, the match was taken to Rugby School.

=== 1930s ===

==== Formation of FIRA ====
For many years, there had been suspicion that the governing body of French rugby union, the French Rugby Federation (FFR) was allowing the abuse of the rules on amateurism, and in 1931 the French Rugby Union was suspended from playing against the other IRFB nations. As a result, &quot;Fédération Internationale de Rugby Amateur&quot; (FIRA) was founded in 1932.

In 1934, the Association was formed at the instigation of the French. It was designed to organise rugby union outside the authority of the &quot;International Rugby Football Board&quot; (as it was known at the time). The founder members were , , , , , , and . In the 1990s, the organisation recognised the IRB as the governing body of rugby union worldwide and in 1999 changed its name to FIRA – Association of European Rugby, an organisation to promote and rule over rugby union in the European area. The organisation changed its name again in 2014 to Rugby Europe.

Until its eventual merger with the IRB, Rugby Europe was the most multinational rugby organisation in the world, partly because the IRB had concentrated on the Five Nations, Tri Nations, and from 1987 the Rugby World Cup, competitions. Rugby Europe has generally been a positive force in spreading the sport beyond the English-speaking world.

==== Interesting times – 1930s ====
In 1931, Lord Bledisloe, the Governor-General of New Zealand, donated a trophy for competition between Australia and New Zealand. The Bledisloe Cup became one of the great rivalries in international rugby union.

Following the suspension of the French Rugby Federation (FFR) in 1931, many French players turned to rugby league, which soon became the dominant game in France, particularly in the south west of the country.

In 1934, the Federation Internationale de Rugby Amateur (FIRA) was formed at the instigation of the French. It was designed to organise rugby union outside the authority of IRB. In the 1990s, the organisation recognised the IRB as the governing body of rugby union worldwide and later changed its name twice—in 1999 to FIRA—Association of European Rugby, and in 2014 to Rugby Europe. Today, Rugby Europe promotes and rules over rugby union in the European area.

In 1939, the FFR was invited to send a team to the Five Nations Championship for the following season, but when war was declared, international rugby was suspended. Eighty-eight international rugby union football players were killed during the conflict.

=== World War II ===
During World War II, the RFU temporarily lifted its ban on rugby league players, many of whom played in the eight &quot;internationals&quot; between England and Scotland that were played by Armed Services teams under the rugby union code. The authorities also allowed the playing of two &quot;Rugby League v Rugby Union&quot; fixtures as fund-raisers for the war effort. The rugby league team (which included some pre-war professionals) won both matches, which were held under union rules.

After the defeat of France in 1940, the French Rugby Union authorities worked with the German collaborating Vichy regime to re-establish the dominance of their sport. Rugby union&#x27;s amateur ethos appealed to the occupier&#x27;s view of the purity of sport. Rugby league, along with other professional sports, was banned. Many players and officials of the sport were punished, and all of the assets of the Rugby League and its clubs were handed over to the Union. The consequences of this action reverberate to this day, as these assets were never returned. Although the ban on rugby league was lifted, it was prevented from calling itself &quot;rugby&quot; until the mid-1980s, having to use the name Jeu à Treize (&quot;Game of Thirteen&quot;) in reference to the number of player in a rugby league side.

=== Post-War, late 1940s and 1950s ===
In 1947, the Five Nations Championship resumed with France taking part. In 1948, the worth of a drop goal was reduced from 4 points to 3 points. In 1949, the Australian Rugby Union was formed and took over the administration of the game in Australia from the New South Wales Rugby Union. In 1958, long after the legend of William Webb Ellis had become engrained in rugby culture, Ross McWhirter managed to relocate his grave &quot;le cimetière du vieux château&quot; at Menton in Alpes Maritimes (has since been renovated by the French Rugby Federation).

=== 1960s ===
During the 1960s, there was stronger and stronger condemnation of the racist apartheid regime in South Africa. This racism extended to rugby union, and the sport soon found itself involved in its most serious controversy since 1895. By 1969, the Halt All Racist Tours campaign group had been set up in New Zealand.

=== 1970s ===
1970 saw the invention of mini rugby, a form of the game still used to train children. In 1971, Scotland appointed Bill Dickinson as their head coach, after years of avoidance, as it was their belief that rugby should remain an amateur sport. The 1971 Springbok tour to Australia was famous for its political protests against South Africa&#x27;s apartheid system. The 1970s were a golden era for Wales with the team capturing five Five Nations titles and dominating the Lions selections throughout the decade. In the middle of the decade, after overseeing the rise in popularity of rugby union in the United States, members&#x27; bodies met in Chicago in 1975 and formed the United States of America Rugby Football Union, today known as USA Rugby.

=== 1980s ===
The 1981 Springbok Tour to New Zealand was also marked by political protests and is still referred to by New Zealanders as &quot;The Tour&quot;. The tour divided New Zealand society and rugby lost some of its prestige, which was not restored until New Zealand won the inaugural 1987 Rugby World Cup. In 1983, the WRFU (Women&#x27;s Rugby Football Union) was formed, with 12 inaugural clubs, the body being responsible for women&#x27;s rugby in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. In 1984 the Wallabies completed their first grand slam, defeating all four nations of the British Isles, and announcing their emergence as a power in world rugby.

=== The Rugby World Cup ===

The first Rugby World Cup was played in 1987. New Zealand hosted the tournament, with some games, including both semi-finals, being played in Australia. The All Blacks defeated France in the final. In 1991, England hosted the second tournament, losing to Australia in the final.

The World Cup of 1995 proved to be a turning point for the game. The competition was held in South Africa, newly readmitted from international exile. Giant wing Jonah Lomu scored four tries for the All Blacks against . , who had not been allowed to compete in the first two tournaments, won the final, beating the All Blacks 15–12, the winning score coming from a drop-goal by Joel Stransky. The tournament became a point of reconciliation for the new South Africa, as South African President Nelson Mandela, dressed in a Springbok jersey, which was long a symbol of apartheid, bearing the name and number six of South Africa&#x27;s captain François Pienaar, handed him the William Webb Ellis Trophy.

The 1999 Rugby World Cup was held in Wales and was won by Australia, who defeated France in the final after the latter had come from behind to record a shock win against tournament favourites, the All Blacks, at the semi-final stage.

In 2003, Australia hosted the tournament and reached the final for the third time. In a closely fought game, which went into extra time, Australia narrowly lost to England, thanks to a last-minute drop goal by Jonny Wilkinson.

France was the host nation for the 2007 Rugby World Cup, though several games were played in Edinburgh and Cardiff, and France played its quarter-final in Wales, against the All Blacks, who had started the tournament as odds-on favourites. In a repeat of 1999, France gained a shock win, consigning the favourites to their worst result in World Cup history. France went on to lose against England at the semi-final stage. England, in turn, lost in the final to the Springboks, who equalled Australia&#x27;s record of two World Cup wins.

The breakthrough team in that competition was Argentina who started with a narrow win over France in the opener, and defeated Ireland to finish atop their pool. They lost in the semifinals to South Africa, but rebounded with a comprehensive win over France in the third-place game. This result led to calls to include the Pumas in one of the major hemispheric national team competitions, such as the Six Nations or Tri Nations. Ultimately, it was decided that the Pumas would be steered toward a future place in the Tri Nations, and they would join that competition in 2012, at which time it was renamed The Rugby Championship.

=== Rugby union and apartheid ===
Even before the apartheid laws were passed in South Africa after 1948, sporting teams going to South Africa had felt it necessary to exclude non-white players. In 1906, the South Africans objected to the selection of black England international James Peters when he turned out for Devon; but were persuaded to play by officials. Though, when England faced South Africa later in the tour, Peters was not selected. New Zealand rugby teams in particular had done this, and the exclusion of George Nēpia and Jimmy Mill from the 1928 All Blacks tour, and the dropping of Ranji Wilson from the New Zealand Army team nine years before that, had attracted little comment at the time. However, in 1960 international criticism of apartheid grew in the wake of &quot;The Wind of Change&quot; speech and the Sharpeville massacre.

From this point onward, the Springboks were increasingly the target of international controversy and protest.

=== Professionalism ===
On 26 August 1995, the International Rugby Board declared rugby union an &quot;open&quot; game and thus removed all restrictions on payments or benefits to those connected with the game. It did this because of a committee conclusion that to do so was the only way to end the hypocrisy of shamateurism and to keep control of rugby union.

The threat to amateur rugby union was especially large in Australia where Super League was threatening to entice players to rugby league with large salaries. SANZAR was formed in 1995 by the New Zealand, Australian and South African Rugby Unions to try to counter the Super League threat. SANZAR proposed a provincial competition with teams from all three countries. This competition became the Super 12 (later Super 14 in 2005, and Super Rugby since 2011). The SANZAR proposals also included an annual competition between each country&#x27;s Test teams, the Tri Nations Series. They were eventually able to get backing for the competition from Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation, with a contract totalling $US 550 million for ten years of exclusive TV and radio broadcasting rights. The deal was signed during the 1995 Rugby World Cup and revealed at a press conference on the eve of World Cup final.

SANZAR&#x27;s proposals were under serious threat from a Sydney-based group called the World Rugby Corporation (WRC). WRC was formed by lawyer Geoff Levy and former Wallaby player Ross Turnbull. Both wanted a professional worldwide rugby competition funded by Kerry Packer, who had already developed professional cricket. At one point the WRC had a majority of the All Blacks and Wallaby teams signed up to their competition. In addition to this the Springboks had also signed the WRC contracts but had decided not to hand them over and instead signed up with the South African Rugby Union. The players had been told they would never play for their country again if they committed to the WRC. Most of the All Blacks then followed their Springbok counterparts by signing with their Union. The Australians, realising that without the New Zealanders and South Africans WRC&#x27;s proposal could not succeed, relented and signed for the Australian Rugby Union.

The Heineken Cup was formed in 1995 as a competition for 12 European clubs. By the time it was replaced in 2014 by the European Rugby Champions Cup, it included teams from all of the Six Nations countries; the current Champions Cup still involves these countries and added South Africa in 2022.

Professionalism opened the door for the emergence of a new rugby generation in Italy. The Italian domestic leagues had attracted a degree of tax relief in the 1990s, and were able to attract both strong corporate sponsorship and also high quality coaches and players with recent Italian heritage from Australia and Argentina. These improvements led to a national team capable of competing with the national teams of the British Isles, proven by a famous victory against Ireland in 1995. Lobbying was successful to have Italy included in the century-old tournament for the top European rugby nations which became the Six Nations championship in 2000.

A key benefit that professionalism brought to rugby union as a whole was the elimination of the constant defection of union players who were attracted to the money of rugby league. The rugby union authorities of the time also hoped that as players could now play in either code, in the long term most of the sponsorship and interest would gravitate away from league to the more international game of union. However, rugby union has not managed to lure away more than a handful of elite players from rugby league, as the two codes have become quite different over the decades of separation in both culture and in aspects of play. The preferred body type and skill sets of players differ, especially in the play of the forwards. With access to players of different types, some more suited to one code and some to the other, some English rugby union clubs have even formed partnerships with a rugby league club which plays in the premier rugby league competitions – the most notable example being Harlequins with London Broncos (formerly Harlequins Rugby League), and between Wigan Warriors and Saracens.

In some countries rugby union&#x27;s administration and structure have not developed along with its professionalism. In Australia the constant flow of rugby union juniors to rugby league clubs has slowed, but Australian rugby union has failed to successfully promote a club or franchise league below the elite level. With professional club games every weekend, Australian rugby league has maintained its dominance over union, especially in its traditional heartlands of New South Wales and Queensland.

The many smaller unions across the globe have struggled both financially and in playing terms to compete with the major nations since the start of the open era. In England whilst some teams flourished in the professional era others such as Richmond, Wakefield, Orrell, Waterloo and London Scottish found the going much harder and have either folded or dropped down to minor leagues. In the other Home Nations, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, the professional era had a traumatic effect on the traditional structure of the sport, which had been based around local clubs. Professional rugby in these three countries is now regionally based. In Ireland, each of the four traditional provinces supports one professional team. Scotland currently has two regional teams, each based in one of the country&#x27;s two largest cities. Wales adopted a regional franchise model, originally with five teams but now with four. These three countries have a joint professional competition, originally known as the Celtic League. In 2010, two Italian super-regional teams joined the competition, which was renamed the Pro12, and in 2017, two South African franchises joined the Pro14 competition. This eventually became the United Rugby Championship, with four different South African teams.

== 21st century ==
Alterations to the laws of rugby union were trialled by students of Stellenbosch University in South Africa in 2006, and were adopted in competitions in Scotland and Australia since 2007, though only a few of the rules were universally adopted. The law variations are an attempt to make rugby union easier to understand by referees, fans and players, but the laws were controversial and far from being endorsed by all members of these groups. After a number of trials around half of the proposed changes were permanently added to the laws of the sport.

In 2012, the Tri Nations was expanded to include Argentina, with the competition being renamed The Rugby Championship. The competition&#x27;s organiser, now known as SANZAAR after the Argentine Rugby Union became a full member in 2016, has also expanded Super Rugby in the 21st century, first expanding from 12 to 14 teams in 2006, then to 15 teams in 2011, and most recently to 18 teams in 2016. The last of these expansions spread Super Rugby&#x27;s geographic scope outside of its founding countries (South Africa, Australia, New Zealand) for the first time, adding new teams in Argentina and Japan.

In 2014, the European club competition structure was revamped. The top-level Heineken Cup and second-level European Challenge Cup were respectively replaced by the European Rugby Champions Cup and European Rugby Challenge Cup. The most significant changes to the structure were a reduction in the number of clubs taking part in the top competition from 24 to 20, plus the introduction of a play-off to determine one place in the Champions Cup.

Following several years of tension within the SANZAAR consortium and knock-on effects from COVID-19, the 2020s saw major changes to the structure of international club rugby. Super Rugby lost its Japanese side even before COVID-19, and its Argentine side withdrew in 2020. More significantly, South Africa pivoted away from SANZAAR and aligned its club structure with that of Europe. Two South African sides had joined the competition previously known as Pro12 after that league&#x27;s 2016–17 season, though the country&#x27;s major regional sides remained in Super Rugby. One of the two Pro14 clubs folded before the 2020–21 season, and the other left the competition at the end of that season. South Africa&#x27;s four major regional sides then left Super Rugby to join Pro14, which was duly renamed the United Rugby Championship, starting in 2021–22. South Africa&#x27;s URC clubs became fully integrated with the European club system effective with the 2022–23 northern hemisphere season.

As for Super Rugby, it would be rebranded as Super Rugby Pacific in 2022, featuring five teams each from Australia and New Zealand, plus one representing Fiji and another nominally representing the Pacific islands as a whole (but mainly Samoa and Tonga).

== Scoring ==
The scoring system used in rugby has changed many times over the years. In the original games completing a &quot;touch down&quot; allowed the team to &quot;try&quot; a kick at goal. This is the derivation of the word &quot;try&quot;. Prior to 1890, games were won by goals scored. A goal was awarded for a successful conversion after a try, a drop goal or from a goal from mark. If the game was drawn, then unconverted tries were tallied to give a winner. This system led to score lines more akin to association football with far more games resulting in draws than are experienced in the modern game. One of the first tasks undertaken by the International Rugby Football Board, formed in 1886, was to introduce a standard point scoring system. One point was awarded for a try, two points for a successful kick at goal after scoring a try (a conversion) and three points for a dropped goal or for a penalty goal. Most of the changes have been to increase the value of tries compared to goals (conversions, penalties, dropped-goals, and goals from mark) in order to promote positive, attacking play. Field goals were considered valid methods of scoring until the RFU and IRFB banned them in 1905 with the value at abolition being 4 points.

== Timeline of the foundation of national rugby unions ==
The first national rugby union was the Rugby Football Union, founded in England in 1871. This was followed over the next decade by the home nations of Scottish Football Union (1873, later SRU), Irish Rugby Football Union (1879) and Welsh Rugby Union (1881). The French Federation (1919) and most recent addition to the 6 Nations Italy (1928).

In the southern hemisphere the traditional rugby powers of South Africa and New Zealand formed their Unions before the end of the 19th century. The white South African Rugby Board merged with the non-racial South African Rugby Union in 1992 following the fall of apartheid. In Australia the third traditional southern rugby power, the Southern Rugby Union (later the New South Wales Rugby Union) and the Northern Rugby Union (later the Queensland Rugby Union) were formed in 1874 and 1883 respectively, before eventually helping form the Australian Rugby Union, now known as Rugby Australia, in 1949. Recent addition to The Rugby Championship Argentina founded its union in 1899.

Other foundations of note include nations that have featured in several or indeed all of the Rugby World Cups today including Fiji (1913), Tonga (1923), Samoa (1923), Japan (1926), Canada (1965) and USA (1975).

Some of the pre-1925 foundations such as Rhodesia/Zimbabwe (1895), Germany (1900), Ceylon/Sri Lanka (1908), Morocco (1916), Malaya/Malaysia (1921), Catalonia (1922, later disbanded by Francisco Franco), Spain (1923) and Kenya (1923) are second and third tier nations.

Many other governing bodies have been set up in recent years, with the most recent being Jordan (2007), Ecuador (2008), Turkey (2009) and the United Arab Emirates (2010).

<text>USS &quot;Jenkins&quot; (DD-447) was a in the service of the United States Navy, the second ship named after Rear Admiral Thornton A. Jenkins. Beginning service during World War II, the destroyer saw action in the Pacific theatre. &quot;Jenkins&quot; was placed in reserve following the end of the war, until 1951, when the ship was reactivated for the Korean War. She served in the western Pacific until 1969 when the destroyer was taken out of service and sold for scrap in 1971.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Jenkins&quot; was laid down by Federal Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co., Kearny, New Jersey on 27 November 1941 and launched on 21 June 1942; sponsored by Mrs Marion Parker Embry. The destroyer was commissioned on 31 July 1942.

After a training period during the summer of 1942, &quot;Jenkins&quot; sailed from Casco Bay, Maine on 24 October as an escort to a convoy headed for the North African campaign. She screened capital ships during naval gunfire support missions, as the attack force arrived off Casablanca on 8 November. Following the Naval Battle of Casablanca, the destroyer returned to New York on 19 November to prepare for action in the Pacific.

Arriving at Nouméa, New Caledonia on 4 January 1943, she began escort and patrol duty among the Solomon Islands and in the Coral Sea. Her first Pacific landing operation began on 29 June, when she joined other units supporting the invasion of New Georgia Island.

Assigned to Rear Admiral Walden Lee &quot;Pug&quot; Ainsworth&#x27;s Task Group 36.1, &quot;Jenkins&quot; departed Tulagi on 5 July and steamed up &quot;The Slot&quot; to intercept Japanese destroyer and transport force-carrying reinforcements to Kolombangara. Radar detected the enemy ships during mid-watch and during the Battle of Kula Gulf 6 July, gunfire sank one destroyer and drove another Ship grounding. Japanese Type 93 torpedo sank the cruiser .

Following this operation, &quot;Jenkins&quot; was dispatched on 18 July to a position south of the Santa Cruz Islands to assist damaged seaplane tender and escorted &quot;Chincoteague&quot; back to Espiritu Santo.

During the next four months &quot;Jenkins&quot; engaged in escort duty, training exercises and preparations for the Gilbert Islands campaign. She joined the screen of Rear Admiral Arthur W. Radford&#x27;s Northern Carrier Group which provided air support over Makin and Tarawa during the landings 15 November. The destroyer then sailed with the carrier force to attack Kwajalein and Wotje in the Marshalls on 4 December. During these raids the aircraft carrier was hit by a torpedo, and &quot;Jenkins&quot; was assigned to escort her back to Pearl Harbor arriving 9 December.

&quot;Jenkins&quot; departed Hawaii 25 January 1944 with a tanker unit to fuel fast carriers and ships covering the Marshall Islands campaign. She operated with the refuelling group through February, and conducted shore bombardment on Bougainville during March. She departed Seeadler Harbor 20 April to rendezvous with Task Force 77 for amphibious operations at Hollandia and Aitape. The landings took place on 22 April and their successful conclusion gave Allied Pacific forces another base from which to launch attacks on remaining enemy-held islands. After escort duty and anti-submarine patrols, &quot;Jenkins&quot; patrolled in early June to deny any attempt by the Japanese to reinforce the Biak garrison. She then covered and provided gunfire support for the invasions of Noemfoor, Sansapor, and Morotai, as well as patrolling and escorting reinforcements throughout the summer.

&quot;Jenkins&quot; departed Manus, Admiralties, 12 October for the Leyte invasion scheduled 20 October. Upon arrival, she was assigned to radar picket and fighter director duties until 27 November.

On 28 December &quot;Jenkins&quot; sortied from Aitape to provide cover for the Luzon Attack Force. After receiving minor damage from an enemy shore battery, the destroyer returned to Leyte 12 January 1945. Ten days later she departed to assist operations in the Lingayen Gulf area. She provided anti-submarine, minesweeping and shore bombardment on Corregidor from 13 February till late April.

She departed Subic Bay 24 April to cover minesweeping and amphibious operations in the Celebes Sea off Borneo. &quot;Jenkins&quot; struck a mine off Tarakan Island on 30 April and sailed into Subic Bay for repairs. On 18 June she sailed for the United States to complete repairs, arriving at San Pedro, California 8 July. She remained on the West Coast through the duration of the war. The destroyer decommissioned at San Diego on 1 May 1946.

The outbreak of the Korean War &quot;Jenkins&quot; was recommissioned as DDE-447 on 2 November 1951 . She departed San Diego on 25 February 1952 for a training period at Pearl Harbor. Upon completion of training, she arrived at Japan on 12 June; and during the summer she operated with Task Force 77 which provided air support for ground forces in Korea. She engaged in patrol duties off Korea and Taiwan before returning to Pearl Harbor on 5 December.

She operated out of Pearl until 10 November 1953 when she sailed for another Far Eastern tour, returning to Pearl Harbor on 15 June. From 1954 through 1963, &quot;Jenkins&quot; sailed annually to the Far East for peacekeeping operations with the 7th Fleet. In her 1958 deployment the 7th Fleet was on ready alert, as the Chinese Communists commenced harassment of the Chinese Nationalist islands of Quemoy and Matsu.

During the sixties, the 7th Fleet deployments were of greater importance because of the Communist insurgency in Laos and Vietnam. For the greater part of 1964 and 1965, &quot;Jenkins&quot; operated out of Pearl Harbor.

&quot;Jenkins&quot; sailed for the Far East 9 February 1966 and on 21 February was assigned to gunfire support duty and shelled enemy positions to assist Marines fighting in Vietnam, until returning to Pearl Harbor on 22 July.

&quot;Jenkins&quot; operated in Hawaiian waters until entering U.S. Naval Shipyard at Pearl Harbor on 11 September for a major overhaul which was completed early in 1967. The destroyer then prepared for another deployment in the war zone.

==Honors==
&quot;Jenkins&quot; received 14 battle stars for World War II service and 1 star for Korean War service.

<text>Harry Hill McAlister (July 15, 1875 – October 30, 1959) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 37th governor of Tennessee from 1933 to 1937. He also served as Nashville&#x27;s city attorney in the early 1900s, and as Tennessee&#x27;s state treasurer in the 1920s and early 1930s. Inaugurated as governor at the height of the Great Depression, McAlister enacted massive spending cuts in an attempt to stabilize state finances. He coordinated federal programs in the state aimed at providing Depression-era relief.

McAlister withdrew from state politics in 1936 following a quarrel with powerful Memphis political boss E. H. Crump. He spent the last two decades of his life as a Referee in Bankruptcy in Nashville&#x27;s district court.

==Early life==
McAlister was born in Nashville, Tennessee in 1875, the son of William McAlister, a lawyer and judge, and Laura (Dortch) McAlister. He attended Vanderbilt University, graduating with a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B) in 1897. He was admitted to the bar, and began practice in Nashville in 1899.

McAlister became Nashville&#x27;s assistant city attorney in 1901, and was elevated to city attorney in 1905. He was elected to the Tennessee Senate in 1910, and served two terms (1911–1915). As a state senator, he sought stricter enforcement of laws regarding education and child labor, and advocated better food and drug inspections. He also sought funding for a tuberculosis hospital for Nashville. McAlister was an elector for President Woodrow Wilson in 1916, and served on the state Democratic Executive Committee from 1918 to 1920.

The Tennessee General Assembly appointed McAlister state treasurer in 1919. He served in this position until 1927, and again from 1931 to 1933. During the 1920s, he consistently warned that the state faced an impending financial crisis, and assailed Governor Austin Peay&#x27;s reforms.

==Governor==

In the governor&#x27;s race of 1926, McAlister sought the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination against the incumbent, Austin Peay. Peay had radically transformed the state government, and had angered numerous members of his own party in the process, among them political bosses E. H. Crump of Memphis and Hilary Howse of Nashville. With the help of Crump and Howse, McAlister was able to win Shelby and Davidson counties, but Peay won the state&#x27;s rural areas and East Tennessee, and defeated McAlister for the nomination by 7,000 votes.

In 1928, McAlister again sought the nomination, this time against incumbent Henry Horton, who had become governor following Peay&#x27;s death the previous year. McAlister had the support of Crump and Howse, while Horton had the support of powerful publisher Luke Lea. A third candidate, Lewis S. Pope, also sought the nomination. Though the primary campaign was hard-fought, McAlister fell short, losing to Horton 97,333 votes to 92,017 (Pope tallied just 27,779 votes).

By late 1930, the effects of the stock market crash of 1929 had reached Tennessee. A few days after Horton&#x27;s victory in the general election, numerous banks controlled by Lea&#x27;s business associate, Rogers Caldwell, failed, wiping out over $6 million in state deposits. Horton faced impeachment, and Lea was indicted on charges of bank fraud. While the motion calling for Horton&#x27;s impeachment failed in the state House, both Caldwell and Lea were eventually convicted on charges of bank fraud.

McAlister, who had warned of the impending crisis, was reappointed state treasurer, and sought the party&#x27;s nomination for governor again in 1932. Although Horton had survived impeachment, he did not seek further reelection, and McAlister&#x27;s main competitors were Pope and former governor Malcolm R. Patterson. Crump&#x27;s support, which gave McAlister a 25,000-vote advantage in Shelby County, proved to be the deciding factor, as McAlister won the nomination, 117,400 votes to 108,400 for Pope, and 60,520 for Patterson. Pope accused Crump of voter fraud, and ran against McAlister in the general election as an independent. On election day, McAlister won easily, with 169,075 votes to 117,797 for the Republican candidate, John E. McCall, and 106,990 for Pope.

Facing a $6 million state debt and an economy ravaged by business and bank failures, McAlister immediately began trimming the state government. He slashed over 2,300 jobs from the government workforce, and cut $7 million in state spending. These cuts included the cost of the governor&#x27;s mansion, which McAlister reduced from $35,000 per year to just $1,000. McAlister supported the Tennessee Valley Authority and other Depression-era federal programs. The construction of Norris Dam and Pickwick Landing Dam began during his tenure.

In April 1933, shortly after the beginning of McAlister&#x27;s term, the state adopted the iris as the state flower, and the mockingbird as the state bird.

In 1934, Pope, determined to break Crump&#x27;s power, again challenged McAlister for the Democratic nomination, but came up short, winning just 137,253 votes to McAlister&#x27;s 191,460. In the general election, Pope once again ran as an independent, and tried to form a fusion ticket with former Republican governor Ben W. Hooper, similar to the one that had elected Hooper more than two decades earlier. Hooper called on Republicans to support Pope in the gubernatorial election, while Pope called on independent Democrats to support Hooper in his Senate campaign against Crump ally, Kenneth McKellar. The plan failed, however, with Pope losing to McAlister, 198,743 votes to 122,965, and McKellar soundly defeating Hooper.

During his second term, McAlister angered Crump by proposing a state sales tax. Crump&#x27;s allies in the state house defeated the tax, and he broke off support for McAlister, calling him &quot;our sorriest governor.&quot; McAlister angered Crump further when he refused to allow the sale of liquor in Memphis (federal prohibition had ended with the repeal of the 18th Amendment, but state prohibition remained in effect). Realizing he had little chance of winning without Crump&#x27;s support, McAlister did not seek reelection to a third term.

==Later life==

Following his second term, McAlister retired to his home in Nashville, and continued to practice law. He was appointed field counsel for the Bituminous Coal Commission in Washington, D.C., in 1936. In 1940, he was appointed Referee in Bankruptcy for Nashville&#x27;s federal district court, and remained in this position for the rest of his life. He died on October 30, 1959, and was buried in Nashville&#x27;s Mount Olivet Cemetery.

==Family==

McAlister was descended (via his mother) from two former Tennessee governors, Willie Blount (1768–1835), his great-great-grandfather, and Aaron V. Brown (1795–1859), his great-grandfather. Willie Blount was the younger half-brother of territorial governor, William Blount.

McAlister married Louise Jackson, daughter of U.S. Supreme Court justice Howell E. Jackson, in 1901. They had two daughters.

<doc id="867189" wikidata="Q478141" url="?curid=867189" title="Mindanao hornbill">
<text>The Mindanao hornbill (Penelopides affinis), also known as the Mindanao tarictic hornbill, is a medium-small species of hornbill found in the canopy of rainforests on Mindanao, Dinagat, Siargao and Basilan in the southern Philippines. All five Philippine tarictics were once considered a single species. Its population declining due to habitat destruction, hunting and the illegal wildlife trade.

It is illegal to hunt, capture or possess Mindanao hornbills under Philippine Law RA 9147.

== Description and taxonomy ==
Ebird described it as &quot;A fairly large bird of lowland and foothill forest. Small for a hornbill. Bill fairly short with black bands, and with bare skin around the eyes and chin. Male has pale underparts and head with a black cheek, a pale buffy tail with a black tip, and pale blue facial skin. Female is entirely black with a buffy band through the center of the tail and darker blue facial skin. Rufous hornbill occurs in some of the same areas, but has a red bill. Samar Hornbill&#x27;s voice is a short, medium-pitched honk, reminiscent of a squeaky toy, often given in rapid series.&quot;

Formerly was once a single species. Visayan hornbill, Luzon hornbill, Samar hornbill and Mindoro hornbill. It is most similar to the Samar hornbill which it was again split from although some authorities believe in its treatment as a single species. It is differentiated from the Mindanao hornbill as it is smaller, and the male has a rufous uppertail. Its call is also in a slightly higher frequency. Its diet is presumed to be similar to other hornbills namely fruit, seeds, insects and small mammals and reptiles.

=== Subspecies ===
Two subspecies are recognized:
* &quot;P. a. affinis&quot; (the nominate subspecies). Found on the islands of Mindanao, Dinagat and Siargao.
* &quot;P. a. basilanica&quot;. Found on the island of Basilan.
It is social and often seen in pairs or small groups up to 12 birds. These birds are noisy, emitting an incessant &quot;ta-rik-tik&quot; call, hence the name. Despite their noise they are difficult to find, being well camouflaged by the dense foliage.

== Ecology and behavior ==
They are primarily frugivorous eating figs and berries but they are also known to eat insects, lizards and other small animals. Usually seen in pairs but can form flocks of up to 15 birds.

All hornbills are monogamous and mate for life. They are cavity nesters and rely on large dipterocarp trees for breeding. The female seals itself within the tree cavity and the male is in charge of gathering food for its mate and chicks. The male stores food in a gular pouch and regurgitates it to feed its mate and chicks. Cooperative breeding, wherein immature birds from previous seasons help out in feeding the female and chick has not been observed with this species so far. Among Philippine hornbills, it has only been recorded with the Rufous hornbill.

Among the tarictics, this species is one of the least studied but breeding habits believed to be similar to the better studied Luzon and Visayan hornbill. Clutch size is presumed to be 2 to 3 eggs. Incubation period is slightly shorter than the Luzon hornbill at just 25 days. In captivity, chicks fledge within 47 to 54 days. 

== Habitat and conservation status ==
Its natural habitats are tropical moist lowland forest with most records under 900 meters above sea level but with records of up to 1,450 meters above sea level. 

The species has been assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as a Least-concern species although this still includes the Samar hornbill as part of its assessment. However, Mindanao and Basilan had undergone extensive lowland deforestation on all islands in its range is the main threat. Most remaining lowland forest that is not afforded protection leaving it vulnerable to both legal and Illegal logging, conversion into farmlands through Slash-and-burn and mining. The &quot;basilanica&quot; sub-species is particularly threatened as there is only 230 hectares of primary forest left. Due to security situation on Basilan, It was only reconfirmed as extant in 2019. 

This tarictic species complex is widely kept in captivity, but due to the taxonomic reorganization it is unknown if these birds are of pure descent.

This occurs in a few protected areas such as Mount Apo, Mount Kitanglad, Pasonanca Natural Park, Mount Kalatungan and Mount Malindang but actual protection from illegal logging, hunting, and poaching are lax.

<text>The Cathedral Church of the Holy Spirit, Guildford, commonly known as Guildford Cathedral, is the Anglican cathedral in Guildford, Surrey, England. Earl Onslow donated the first of land on which the cathedral stands, with Viscount Bennett, a former Prime Minister of Canada, purchasing the remaining land and donating it to the cathedral in 1947. Designed by Edward Maufe and built between 1936 and 1961, it is the seat of the Bishop of Guildford. The cathedral was listed as Grade II* by Historic England in 1981. It was the last Church of England cathedral to be consecrated on a new site, and one of only three to be built in the 20th-century, the others being Liverpool and Coventry Cathedral.

==Construction==
The Diocese of Guildford was created in 1927, covering most of Surrey. Guildford&#x27;s restored Georgian Holy Trinity Church served as pro-cathedral, but was considered too small to become the cathedral.

In 1932, a design competition was held, with a brief that the construction costs should be £250,000. 183 architects took part, from whom the Cathedral Committee chose Edward Maufe (later Sir Edward Maufe) as its architect.

In 1933, Richard Onslow, 5th Earl of Onslow donated land at the top of Stag Hill as a site for the cathedral.

The foundation stone was laid by Cosmo Lang, Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1936, but work was suspended in 1939 due to the Second World War.

In 1947, Viscount Bennett, former prime minister of Canada, bought the land surrounding Stag Hill, as a memorial to Canadian soldiers who were billeted in the area during the Second World War.

In 1948, work recommenced on building new roofs and the base of the tower, but post-war building restrictions meant that building was not able to fully resume until 1952, after the appointment of Walter Boulton as Provost. At that point, it was already clear that £250,000 originally raised to build the cathedral was hopelessly inadequate. The Cathedral Committee, and its formidable secretary, Miss Eleanora Iredale, launched the &#x27;Buy-a Brick&#x27; campaign in 1952. Between 1952 and 1961 more than 200,000 people paid 2s 6d () to sign their name, or the name of another person on a brick. Elizabeth II and Prince Philip both signed bricks, which are on display inside the cathedral, along with bricks signed by other members of the Royal Family. 

Before the war, the bricks themselves had been made by Guildford Brick Works at the bottom of Stag Hill, from the clay removed during the installation of 778 piles, driven into the hill. After the war, the brickworks ceased to trade, and bricks were then bought from a brickmakers in Beare Green, Sussex. There is a slight colour variation between the local bricks (forming the eastern end of the cathedral) and the Sussex bricks, forming the western end, tower, garths and Lady Chapel.

The building was consecrated in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip on 17 May 1961. The building was finally completed in 1965.

==Location==

Where to put the cathedral for the new diocese of Guildford was a vexing question until Richard, Lord Onslow donated atop Stag Hill — so named because the Kings of England used to hunt there. Its solid red brick outline is visible for miles around. Whilst in 1932 this was far outside the town of Guildford, the growth since then has already begun to wrap around the cathedral to the west and south. Guildford Cathedral shares Stag Hill with the main campus of the University of Surrey.

Writing in 1932, Maufe said: &quot;The ideal has been to produce a design, definitely of our own time, yet in the line of the great English Cathedrals; to build anew on tradition, to rely on proportion, mass, volume and line rather than on elaboration and ornament.&quot; The Pevsner Architectural Guides describe the building as &quot;sweet-tempered, undramatic Curvilinear Gothic&quot;, and the interior as &quot;noble and subtle&quot;.

Maufe was influenced by continental cathedrals, notably the 13th-century Albi Cathedral in France, and favoured clean modern design in a Gothic Revival style. He aimed to create a broad and uninterrupted nave space by the use of narrow &quot;passage aisles&quot;, which as at Albi, removed the need for flying butresses. Unlike the French original, the aisles do not quite reach up to the nave roof, resulting in a small clerestory with little windows. When it became apparent that economy would preclude the use of stone, Maufe brought a medieval brick back from Albi, which was copied by the Guildford brick makers for use in the new building.

The tower is high, and contains twelve bells. At the top of the tower stands a gilded angel, which turns in the wind. Inside, the cathedral appears to be filled with light, with pale Somerset limestone pillars and white Italian marble floors. It is a Grade II* listed building.

The angel on the top of the tower was given in memory of Sgt. Reginald Adgey-Edgar of the Intelligence Corps, who died on active service in 1944 during World War II. It was designed by William Pickford and created by four silversmiths, before being positioned in Spring 1963. The supporting pole for the angel houses mobile phone antennas.

The wooden cross which stands outside the eastern end of the cathedral was erected in 1933 before construction work began in order to mark the site of the new cathedral. Known as the Ganges Cross, it is made from timbers of Burma teak from the battleship . The ship&#x27;s emblem — an elephant — is embedded in the wood.

Sir Edward Maufe&#x27;s wife, Lady Prudence Maufe – an interior designer, director of Heal and Son Ltd. and member of the Worshipful Company of Broderers – was instrumental in the design of the textiles within the cathedral. Unusually, Maufe&#x27;s contract included complete control over the internal fittings and colour scheme of the cathedral. This colour scheme references Guildford&#x27;s wool trade past, notably the blue colour for which Guildford wool was famous. The 1,447 kneelers, using a combination of standard and individual designs, were each reviewed and approved by Lady Maufe and her committee. They were made by over 400 individuals, mainly from the British Isles, but including people from other countries, such as Australia and New Zealand. Whilst most were made during the late 1950s and early 1960s, there are examples dating back to the late 1930s, and they collectively form a fascinating record of society and life at that time.
20th-century sculptors and artists are well represented at Guildford Cathedral, notably Eric Gill, Vernon Hill, Mary Spencer Watson, Dennis Huntley, Alan Collins and local artists John Cobbett and Douglas Stephen. Charles Gurrey created a series of sculptures above the West Front, to mark the Millennium, whilst Canadian sculptor Nicholas Thompson completed a sculpture of a WWI mother and child in 2016.

There are three side chapels. The Children&#x27;s Chapel is dedicated to children who have died, and holds a book of remembrance for children of any age. The Chapel of the Queen&#x27;s Royal Surrey Regiment holds the regimental colours and was dedicated in 1959 to the Honour of King Charles the Martyr. The Queen&#x27;s Royal Regiment was founded in 1661 as the Tangiers Regiment on the marriage of King Charles II and Catherine of Braganza. The Lady Chapel was built using funds donated by the Canadian people, in recognition of the support for Canadian troops stationed in the area during both world wars. It contains a figure of the Madonna and Child, carved in lignum vitae by Douglas Stephen, the then manager of Barclays Bank, Chelsea. The altar and altar rails were originally used in the chapel in the crypt, the place of worship for the original parish, during the construction of the cathedral. The crypt chapel is now used as the choir room.

==Glass==

The cathedral contains fewer stained glass windows than many comparable church buildings, having a predominantly clear glazing scheme (using opaque glass to soften the light) to complement the modernist architectural style of the building. However it includes works by Moira Forsyth, William Wilson, James Powell and Sons, Ninian Comper and Lawrence Lee.

There are etched glass works by New Zealand-born artist John Hutton. One set adorns the panel at the west entrance; the other is above the internal doors to the south porch. In January 2024 one of the panes on the west front door was smashed in an act of apparent vandalism. Hutton achieved particular acclaim for his work at Coventry Cathedral, and he worked on both Coventry and Guildford Cathedrals at the same time.

==Music==
===Organ===
The cathedral organ was installed in 1961 by the Liverpool firm of Rushworth and Dreaper. It is a reconstruction of an organ dating from , previously in the Rosse Street Baptist Church in Shipley, West Yorkshire. The organ, probably built by Nicholson of Bradford, was a gift of the Coulthurst Trust. During the cathedral&#x27;s renovation in 2015 to 2017, the organ was dismantled and refurbished by David Wells Organ Builders. There are approximately 4,600 pipes across both the main and positive organs.

A second organ, also supplied by Rushworth and Dreaper, is installed in the musicians gallery of the Lady Chapel.

===Organists===
Organists at Guildford Cathedral have included the composer Philip Moore. Katherine Dienes-Williams became the first female Organist and Master of the Choristers in an English Anglican Cathedral in January 2008.

===Choir===
The Cathedral Choir was formed for the consecration of the cathedral in May 1961. It consists of boy choristers, who sing at Sunday services and Choral Evensong on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and are educated at the RGS Preparatory School. Since 2002, girl choristers have sung on Sundays and Evensong on Fridays. There are six lay clerks, professional adult singers; two altos, two tenors and two basses. They sing on Sundays and at Evensong on weekdays. The Guildford Cathedral Singers are a voluntary mixed-voice choir, who sing at special services and when the Cathedral Choir is on holiday.

===Bells===

Guildford Cathedral has a ring of twelve bells; ten of which were cast by Mears and Stainbank in 1965. The bells were augmented to 12 with two Whitechapel trebles in 1975. The largest bell is the tenor which weighs 30 cwt and 43 lbs (1,543.5 kg), and is tuned to the key of D. A team of about 25 volunteer bellringers practice on Tuesdays. In June 2022, the cathedral hosted the final of the National 12 Bell Striking Contest.

<doc id="867200" wikidata="Q5539658" url="?curid=867200" title="George Gee (murderer)">
<text>George William Gee (16 June 1881 – 22 July 1904) was a Canadian murderer and the first person to be hanged in the town of Woodstock, New Brunswick. He was tried for the murder of Millie Gee, his cousin and ex-lover. The trial took place in the Old Carleton County Court House, and he was hanged in the Woodstock Gaol.
== The murder ==
George and Millie had been seeing each other for three or four years, when Millie lost interest and asked him not to see her anymore. Shortly thereafter, she was hired to look after the house and children of Bennie Gee because his wife had left him. She stayed in the house next door with Bennie&#x27;s sister Catherine and her husband Daniel Crane.

On Saturday, 12 March 1904, George arrived at Bennie&#x27;s residence with a Lee–Enfield Rifle that he had borrowed from a Lt. Weldon W. Melville. He had been drinking steadily for most of the afternoon, but was friendly enough when he arrived, and left the rifle at the door. He stayed late, playing cards with Bennie and continuing to drink until three in the morning, when George announced that he should leave and was helped to the door by Millie.

As he was going out he uttered his later famous words, &quot;I suppose you don&#x27;t know that this is the night you&#x27;re going to die.&quot; He then turned around, picked up the rifle and fired. The bullet ricocheted off the frame of the door and entered Millie&#x27;s chest, knocking her to the floor.

Hearing the shot, Bennie ran to the door. George fired twice in his direction but missed. He then fled. After a time he walked the long distance to a phone and called Dep. Sheriff Foster to turn himself in.

Three doctors were called to attend Millie, but they could not save her life. She died the following Wednesday a short time after giving her deposition to Dep. Sheriff Foster.

== The trial ==
After a preliminary hearing, the trial was set for 26 April 1904 with Judge Tucker presiding. Attorney General Pugsley was for the Crown. J. Chipman Hartley and T C L Ketchum were for the defense.

Gee pleaded not guilty and the calling of witnesses began. In all, 23 were called, most of them close friends and relatives. In his closing arguments Ketchum pleaded with the jury that Gee was insane, drunk, and too poor to mount a proper defense. He claimed a charge of manslaughter would be more appropriate. His full argument lasted a full hour and left Gee in tears.

The crown argued that the crime was premeditated and that Gee couldn&#x27;t have been insane, as he had obviously realized his crime when he turned himself in.

The jury deliberated for only 45 minutes before they returned a verdict of guilty. Judge Tucker sentenced Gee to hang on the grounds of the (then) new jail.

== The execution ==
The hanging went forward as planned, on July 22, although there was a delay for the rope to be shipped in from out of town, since no one from the town would sell it. He was baptized into the Adventist Church before his death. The executioner, Radcliffe, was swift in the hanging, and the rope snapped Gee&#x27;s neck. He was pronounced dead 12 minutes afterward. George Gee is buried in the same grave as Millie Gee, and they have a plaque together. They are buried in the Gee Flat Cemetery in Bath, New Brunswick.

<doc id="867206" wikidata="Q883798" url="?curid=867206" title="Henry Hollis Horton">
<text>Henry Hollis Horton (February 17, 1866 – July 2, 1934) was an American attorney, farmer and politician who served as the 36th Governor of Tennessee from 1927 to 1933. He was elevated to the position when Governor Austin Peay died in office, and as Speaker of the Tennessee Senate, he was first in the line of succession. He was subsequently elected to two more two-year terms.

Horton&#x27;s tenure as governor was marred by a scandal after the Stock Market crash in 1929. The related collapse of the financial empires of his political allies, Luke Lea and Rogers Caldwell, cost the state more than $6 million in funds deposited in their banks by Horton&#x27;s administration. The legislature held a vote on impeaching the governor, but the measure did not carry and he served out his term. He retired from politics and returned to his farm in Marshall County.

==Early life==
Horton was born in 1866 in the Princeton community of Jackson County, Alabama, one of 12 children of Henry Hollis Horton, a Baptist minister, and Anne (Moore) Horton. He attended Scottsboro Academy in Scottsboro, Alabama, before graduating from Winchester College in Winchester, Tennessee, in 1888. He moved to Hillsboro, Texas to teach school, but returned to Tennessee after about a year. He attended the University of the South in Sewanee in the early 1890s to study law.

Horton was admitted to the bar in 1894, and practiced law in Franklin County. He held various local offices, including school director and election commissioner, and worked as director of the Home Bank of Winchester.

==Marriage and family==
Horton married Adeline Wilhoite in 1896. They had one son.

==Early political career==
Horton was elected to represent Franklin County for one term in the Tennessee House of Representatives, from 1907 to 1909. He was a supporter of prohibition.

In 1911, Horton and his family moved to Marshall County, Tennessee. He operated a farm and mill that had been established by his in-laws, the Wilhoites, on the Duck River near Chapel Hill.

==Governor==

Horton was elected to the Tennessee Senate in 1926 for the district of Marshall and Lincoln counties. He served as Speaker of the Senate from 1926 to 1927. When Governor Austin Peay died in office on October 2, 1927, Horton became governor according to Tennessee&#x27;s gubernatorial succession law.

Unfamiliar with running a statewide campaign, Horton turned to Peay&#x27;s longtime adviser, Luke Lea, publisher of the &quot;Nashville Tennessean&quot;, to help him win reelection in 1928. Lea&#x27;s rivals, Memphis political boss E. H. Crump and Nashville political boss Hilary Howse, endorsed Hill McAlister, who had been defeated by Peay in 1926. A third candidate, Lewis S. Pope, also sought the Democratic nomination, and had the backing of Peay&#x27;s widow. After a hard-fought primary campaign, Horton won the nomination with 97,333 votes to 92,017 for McAlister, and 27,779 for Pope. In the general election, he defeated the Republican candidate, Raleigh Hopkins, 195,546 votes to 124,733.

During Horton&#x27;s second term, he and Lea began using state patronage to distribute jobs in Memphis in an attempt to weaken Crump&#x27;s influence there. Crump, who was running for Congress and wanted to focus on his own campaign, agreed to support Horton in the 1930 governor&#x27;s race if he and Lea would stop providing patronage to his foes. With Crump out of the way, Horton defeated his chief opponent, Lambert Estes Gwinn, 123,642 to 88,416 in the Democratic primary. He defeated C. Arthur Bruce in the general election, winning 144,995 votes to Bruce&#x27;s 101,285.

Four days after Horton was reelected governor, the Bank of Tennessee, owned by Lea associate Rogers Caldwell, was declared insolvent following the stock market crash in 1929, and Caldwell&#x27;s banks throughout the South soon followed. Horton had deposited more than $6 million in state funds in Caldwell&#x27;s banks, all of which was lost.

A Tennessee General Assembly investigation produced charges that Horton had conspired with Lea and Caldwell to run branches of state government for their own financial gain in exchange for Lea&#x27;s political support. Crump and his allies assailed Horton for depositing state funds in the banks of his political allies. They also attacked Horton for awarding no-bid contracts to Caldwell&#x27;s road-paving company, Kyrock. A motion calling for Horton&#x27;s impeachment was voted on by the state House in June 1931, but the motion failed, 58 to 41. Horton finished his term and did not seek reelection.

During Horton&#x27;s tenure as governor, he continued most of Peay&#x27;s reform initiatives. He abolished a land tax that had been unpopular with farmers, established a parole board, created a state division of aeronautics, and developed a secondary state highway system. He supported statues of Andrew Jackson and John Sevier being placed in Statuary Hall in Washington, D.C.

==Later life and legacy==

Following his final term as governor, Horton retired to his farm in Marshall County. He died from an apparent stroke on July 2, 1934. He was buried in Lewisburg, Tennessee.

In 1961, the state purchased Horton&#x27;s Marshall County farm from his heirs. It adapted the land for use as Henry Horton State Park, dedicated to his memory. The ruins of a mill operated by Horton and his in-laws, the Wilhoites, still stand in the park.

A portion of U.S. Route 31 in Marshall County has been named in Horton&#x27;s honor.

<doc id="867207" wikidata="Q5535364" url="?curid=867207" title="Geology of Hertfordshire">
<text>The geology of Hertfordshire describes the rocks of the English county of Hertfordshire which are a northern part of the great shallow syncline known as the London Basin. The beds dip in a south-easterly direction towards the syncline&#x27;s lowest point roughly under the River Thames. The most important formations are the Cretaceous chalks, which are exposed as the high ground in the north and west of the county, and the Cenozoic rocks made up of the Paleocene age Reading beds and Eocene age London Clay that occupies the remaining southern part.

==The Cretaceous==
On the northern boundary and just inside the county, at the foot of the chalk Chiltern Hills, near Tring and Ashwell, there is a small strip of exposed Cretaceous Gault Clay and Upper Greensand. At 100 million years old, these are the oldest rocks in the county. Rocks get progressively younger as one moves in a south easterly direction through the county.

The lowest layer of the chalk is the Chalk Marl, which, with the Totternhoe Clunch Stone above it, lies at the base of the Chiltern Hills escarpment. This is visible as a terrace projecting north-westwards, near Whipsnade and Ivinghoe.

Above these beds, the Lower and Middle Chalk, without flints, rise up sharply to form the steepest part of the Dunstable Downs, which are the easterly continuation of the Chiltern Hills.

Next comes the Chalk Rock, which, being a hard bed, caps the hilltops by Boxmoor, Apsley End and near Baldock. The Upper Chalk slopes southward towards the Paleogene boundary to the south.

All the chalk was deposited between 100 million and 66 million years ago when the area was at the bottom of a shallow sea and some distance from the nearest land.

The chalk is often covered by a clay-with-flints deposit, which is formed of the weathered remnants of Cenozoic rocks and chalk.

==The Cenozoic==
The Palaeocene Reading beds consist of mottled and yellow clays and sands, the latter are frequently hardened into masses made up of pebbles in a siliceous cement, known locally as Hertfordshire puddingstone. Examples of Reading Beds outliers occur in what are otherwise chalky areas at St Albans, Ayot Green, Burnham Green, Micklefield Green, Sarratt, and Bedmond. The Reading Beds were laid down about 60 million years ago when the area was a river estuary receiving river sediment from land to the west.

The London Clay is a stiff, blue clay that weathers to brown and rests nearly everywhere upon the Reading beds. It represents the time 55 to 40 million years ago when Hertfordshire was once again under a deeper sea but was near enough to land to receive fine mud deposits.
===The Ice Age===

About 478,000 to 424,000 years ago during the ice age period known as the Anglian Stage, glaciers approached from the North Sea and reached as far south-west as Bricket Wood. Glacial gravels and boulder clays cover a great deal of the whole area to the north east of the county and the Upper Chalk itself has been disturbed at Reed and Barley by glaciation.

Prior to the ice ages the River Thames followed a path through the southern part of Hertfordshire, running from the area of modern Staines up the valley of the Colne to Hatfield and then eastward across Essex originally towards the primeval Rhine but later down the valley of the modern River Lea. This path was blocked by a mass of ice near Hatfield and a lake ponded up to the west of this around St Albans. Waters eventually overflowed near Staines to cut the path of the modern Thames through central London. When the ice retreated about 400,000 years ago the river bed along the new route followed the lower path and so the river remained on its present-day course. The flow in the Colne valley reversed, now flowing south as a tributary into the modern Thames. Superficial gravel deposits from the primordial Thames, are found throughout the Vale of St. Albans.

At the retreat of the glaciers, wind blown powdered rock known as loess was deposited over the whole county, forming thin layers under a metre thick. This reddish clay is easily formed into bricks at the lowish temperatures attainable in a wood-fired kiln and gained the name brickearth. It gave rise to rural brick-making industries scattered throughout the county. It also makes for fine, easily cultivated and fertile soils.

<text>Gene Moore (June 10, 1910 – November 23, 1998) was an American designer and window dresser. Moore joined Tiffany &amp; Company in 1955, as its Artistic Director and Vice President. He was also the Art Director of Bonwit Teller and gave Andy Warhol some of his first work as a window dresser.

==Biography==
Gene Moore is often cited as pioneer in the history of American design and a vital figure in the creation of the brand image of jewelry powerhouse Tiffany &amp; Co. Historian Mark C. Taylor has described Moore as one of the &quot;most important twentieth-century window designers in the United States&quot;.

Moore was also the photographer behind one of the best-known portrait sittings of actress Audrey Hepburn, in 1952. The photo session was made by Moore originally with the intent to be the basis for modeling his new mannequin design for Bonwit Teller. Hepburn was later reunited with Moore in the opening sequence of the 1960 film Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s, appearing as the iconic Holly Golightly sipping morning coffee in front of his windows at the Tiffany &amp; Co. flagship store.

Working at Tiffany&#x27;s, Moore designed approximately 5,000 windows, many of which featured his collection of stuffed hummingbirds. He was also noted for using concepts or actual works of modern art in his windows, including those of Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Alexander Ney and Andy Warhol.

==Legacy==

In 1997, Moore donated much of his archives to the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, Smithsonian Institution. The collection was transferred to the Archives Center at the National Museum of American History in 2012.

His work was the subject of the 1996 exhibition &quot;Moon Over Pearls, Gene Moore&#x27;s Tiffany Windows and Beyond&quot; held at The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City.

<text>70013 &quot;[[Oliver Cromwell]]&quot; is a British Railways Standard Class 7 (also known as the Britannia class) preserved steam locomotive. The locomotive is notable as one of the four steam locomotives which worked the last steam railtour on British Railways (BR) in 1968.

==Career==

One of 55 of the Standard Class 7, &quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot; was built at Crewe Works, being completed on 30 May 1951. 70013 was initially allocated to Norwich depot (BR shed code 32A) on the Eastern Region of British Railways and employed on London Liverpool Street to Norwich expresses. Some of the Norwich diagrams (the day&#x27;s operating schedule for a locomotive) required two return trips a day to London totalling 460 miles. The introduction of the Britannia Pacifics revolutionised express services in East Anglia.

From 1958, diesel-electric locomotives began to replace steam locomotives. 70013 remained at Norwich until w/e 16 September 1961 when transferred to March depot (shed code 31B), having covered 698,000 miles in just over ten years, an excellent figure. Norwich depot, under the shedmaster Bill Harvey, was renowned for the fine mechanical condition of its locomotives. In December 1963, 70013 was transferred to the London Midland Region at Carlisle Kingmoor depot (shed code 12A) for freight, parcels and occasional passenger work – most regular express services were by now diesel-hauled. The north-west of England became the steam locomotive&#x27;s last area of operation on BR. On 3 October 1966, 70013 entered Crewe Works and became the last BR-owned steam locomotive to undergo routine heavy overhaul, being out-shopped after a special ceremony in February 1967. 70013 was selected to operate the last steam passenger train prior to the abolition of steam traction on British Railways lines, and in the summer of 1968 &quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot; hauled several specials, culminating in the &quot;Fifteen Guinea Special&quot; which ran between Liverpool and Carlisle on 11 August that year and which 70013 hauled on the Manchester to Carlisle leg of the trip.

==Preservation==

&quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot; became part of the National Railway Museum&#x27;s National Collection immediately after the end of the &quot;Fifteen Guinea Special&quot; (70000 &quot;Britannia&quot;, later preserved privately, had previously been earmarked for this move). Despite a steam ban after 11 August 1968, 70013 moved under its own steam on 12 August to its old shed at Norwich and then, on 13 August, to Diss whence it was transported by road to Bressingham Steam &amp; Gardens. At Bressingham, 70013 was in service to provide footplate rides until the 1980s, before retiring into the museum exhibition.

In 2004, it was announced that &quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot; would be restored to main-line standard in preparation for the 40th anniversary of the end of steam, with significant financial assistance from the readers of &quot;Steam Railway&quot; magazine. The locomotive was overhauled at the Great Central Railway (GCR) to mainline standards which included the fitting of the train protection warning system, overhaul of 70013&#x27;s automatic warning system and the fitting of a train event recorder. On the weekend of 3 May – 4 May 2008, the locomotive hauled its first revenue-earning passenger services since being restored on the GCR&#x27;s eight-mile route. The locomotive made an appearance at the National Railway Museum&#x27;s &quot;1968 and All That&quot; event celebrating 40 years since the end of steam.

Its first mainline passenger charter since 1968 was on 10 August 2008 when the locomotive took part in a re-run of the &quot;Fifteen Guinea Special&quot;. It then went on to operate on the &quot;Scarborough Spa Express&quot; later in the month.

On 9 September 2008, &quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot; completed a re-run of &quot;The Norfolkman&quot; running from Liverpool Street station to Norwich railway station and return, visiting the site of its former home of Norwich shed (32A). 70013 carried a 32A shed plate on the smokebox to complete the image.

On 8 November 2008, the locomotive was temporarily re-numbered as 70048 and renamed &quot;The Territorial Army 1908 - 2008&quot; to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Territorial Army. The naming was performed by The Duke of Gloucester at station on the preserved Great Central Railway. 70048 was a sister member of the BR Standard Class 7 Britannia class and was named &quot;The Territorial Army 1908 - 1958&quot;. During the 2008 renaming, 70013 carried this name on the right-hand-side smoke deflector as a reminder of the original name and as a link with the past association with the Territorial Army.

On 14 March 2009 &quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot; hauled a special on what was said to be the very last train (of any sort) to use the branch line down to Folkestone Harbour, where main line trains used to meet with cross channel ferries.

On 23 May 2009, the locomotive hauled a railtour from Norwich to Poole in Dorset, and then travelled to the Swanage Railway under its own power, via Wareham and the re-instated link between the main-line and the Swanage Railway at Motala.

On 11 March 2010, &quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot; hauled the opening railtour over the newly re-instated level crossing at Sheringham on the North Norfolk Railway, arriving from King&#x27;s Cross, via Cambridge and Norwich.

On 3 May 2010, &quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot; was used for a private charter by Girlguiding UK, as part of the celebration of 100 years of Guiding. Brownies Take Over the Tracks ran between London Victoria and Windsor &amp; Eton Riverside.

On Saturday 15 May 2010, two years after its previous overhaul, &quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot; suffered from cracks in the firebox and was moved to the GCR for an inspection which led to the locomotive being withdrawn from service.

During 2010, 70013 &quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot; underwent firebox repairs at Crewe Heritage Centre. The cab was removed before the rest of the locomotive was sent for repairs to the boiler. Following these repairs, on 17 December 2010 the locomotive had a successful steam test at Crewe. On 8 March 2011, the locomotive was taken to Southall, and on 12 March 2011 hauled &quot;The Lincoln Imp&quot; from London Victoria to Lincoln, returning to Kings Cross.

On 27 May 2012, the locomotive was involved in a blowback incident at Wood Green
tunnel near New Southgate station in North London on a Railway Touring Company railtour called &#x27;The Peak Forester&#x27;. Two of the three crew on board the locomotive had to attend hospital as a result. A Rail Accident Investigation Branch investigation was conducted after the accident.

On 11 August 2013, 70013 took part in the 45th anniversary train of The &quot;Fifteen Guinea Special&quot; along with three LMS Black 5s, 44932, 45305 and 45231. 70013 took the train from Longsight to Carlisle traveling via Farington Junction, Blackburn and Hellifield while traveling along the Settle and Carlisle line.

On 3 March 2018, 70013 hauled its final main line charter from Ealing Broadway to York via the Midland Main Line prior to the expiry of its boiler certificate. It then moved to the GCR. 70013 later had a boiler inspection which enabled it to run on the GCR until 31 December 2018. It ran GCR services for the last time on that date before being withdrawn for overhaul. In 2019 it moved to the GCR to be overhauled.

<doc id="867217" wikidata="Q16152781" url="?curid=867217" title="1924 Democratic National Convention">
<text>The 1924 Democratic National Convention, held at the Madison Square Garden in New York City from June 24 to July 9, 1924, was the longest continuously running convention in United States political history. It took a record 103 ballots to nominate a presidential candidate. It was the first major party national convention that saw the name of a woman, Lena Springs, placed in nomination for vice president. John W. Davis, a dark horse, eventually won the presidential nomination on the 103rd ballot, a compromise candidate following a protracted convention fight between distant front-runners William Gibbs McAdoo and Al Smith.

Davis and his vice presidential running-mate, Governor Charles W. Bryan of Nebraska, went on to be defeated by the Republican ticket of President Calvin Coolidge and Charles G. Dawes in the 1924 presidential election.

== Site selection ==
New York had not been chosen for a convention since 1868, and its selection as the site for the 1924 convention was based in part on the state party&#x27;s recent success. Two years earlier, thirteen Republican congressmen had lost their seats to Democrats. Wealthy New Yorkers, who had outbid other cities, declared their purpose &quot;to convince the rest of the country that the town was not the red-light menace generally conceived by the sticks&quot;. Though &quot;dry&quot; organizations that supported continuing the prohibition of alcohol opposed the choice, in the fall of 1923 it won the grudging consent of McAdoo, a dry, before McAdoo&#x27;s connection to the Teapot Dome scandal made Smith a serious threat. (McAdoo&#x27;s candidacy was hurt by the revelation that he had accepted money from Edward L. Doheny, an oil tycoon implicated in Teapot Dome.) McAdoo&#x27;s adopted state, California, had played host to the Democrats in 1920.

== The primaries ==

McAdoo swept the primaries in the first real race in the history of the party, although most states chose delegates through party organizations and conventions, giving most of their projected votes to local or hometown candidates, referred to as &quot;favorite sons&quot;.

== Ku Klux Klan presence ==
The Ku Klux Klan had surged in popularity after World War I, due to its leadership&#x27;s connections to passage of the successful Prohibition Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This made the Klan a political power throughout many regions of the United States, and it reached the apex of its power in the mid-1920s, when it exerted deep cultural and political influence on both Republicans and Democrats. Its supporters had successfully quashed an anti-Klan resolution before it ever went to a floor vote at the 1924 Republican National Convention earlier in June, and proponents expected to exert the same influence at the Democratic convention. Instead, tension between pro- and anti-Klan delegates produced an intense and sometimes violent showdown between convention attendees from the states of Colorado and Missouri. Klan delegates opposed the nomination of New York governor Al Smith because Smith was a Roman Catholic and an opponent of Prohibition, and most supported William Gibbs McAdoo. Non-Klan delegates, led by Sen. Oscar Underwood of Alabama, attempted to add condemnation of the organization for its violence to the Democratic Party&#x27;s platform. The measure was narrowly defeated, and the anti-KKK plank was not included in the platform.

== Roosevelt comeback ==
Smith&#x27;s name was placed into nomination by Franklin D. Roosevelt, in a speech in which Roosevelt dubbed Smith &quot;The Happy Warrior&quot;. Roosevelt&#x27;s speech, which has since become a well-studied example of political oratory, was his first major political appearance since the paralytic illness he had contracted in 1921. The success of this speech and his other convention efforts in support of Smith signaled that he was still a viable figure in politics, and he nominated Smith again in 1928. Roosevelt succeeded Smith as governor in 1929, and went on to win election as president in 1932.

== Results ==

=== Presidential candidates ===


The first day of balloting (June 30) brought the predicted deadlock between the leading aspirants for the nomination, William G. McAdoo of California and Gov. Alfred E. Smith of New York, with the remainder divided mainly between local &quot;favorite sons&quot;. McAdoo was the leader from the outset, and both he and Smith made small gains in the day&#x27;s fifteen ballots, but the prevailing belief among the delegates was that the impasse could only be broken by the elimination of both McAdoo and Smith and the selection of one of the other contenders; much interest centred about the candidacy of John W. Davis, who also increased his vote during the day from 31 to 61 (with a peak of 64.5 votes on the 13th and 14th ballots). Most of the favorite son delegations refused to be stampeded to either of the leading candidates and were in no hurry to retire from the contest.
In the early balloting many delegations appeared to be jockeying for position, and some of the original votes were purely complimentary and seemed to conceal the real sentiments of the delegates. Louisiana, for example, which was bound by the &quot;unit rule&quot; (all the state&#x27;s delegate votes would be cast in favor of the candidate favored by a majority of them), first complimented its neighbor Arkansas by casting its 20 votes for Sen. Joseph T. Robinson, then it switched to Sen. Carter Glass, and on another ballot Maryland Gov. Albert C. Ritchie got the twenty, before the delegation finally settled on John W. Davis.

There was some excitement on the tenth ballot, when Kansas abandoned Gov. Jonathan M. Davis and threw its votes to McAdoo. There was an instant uproar among McAdoo delegates and supporters, and a parade was started around the hall, the Kansas standard leading, with those of all the other McAdoo states coming along behind, and pictures of &quot;McAdoo, Democracy&#x27;s Hope&quot;, being lifted up. After six minutes the chairman&#x27;s gavel brought order and the roll call resumed, and soon the other side had something to cheer, when New Jersey made its favorite son, Gov. George S. Silzer, walk the plank and threw its votes into the Smith column. This started another parade, the New York and New Jersey standards leading those of the other Smith delegations around the hall while the band played &quot;Tramp, Tramp, Tramp, the Boys are Marching&quot;.

==== First ballot ====

==== Fifteenth ballot ====

==== Twentieth ballot ====
McAdoo and Smith each evolved a strategy to build up his own total slowly. Smith&#x27;s trick was to plant his extra votes for his opponent, so that McAdoo&#x27;s strength might later appear to be waning; the Californian countered by holding back his full force, though he had been planning a strong early show. But by no sleight of hand could the convention have been swung around to either contestant. With the party split into two assertive parts, the rule requiring a two-thirds vote for nomination crippled the chances of both candidates by giving a veto each could—and did—use. McAdoo himself wanted to drop the two-thirds rule, but his Protestant supporters preferred to keep their veto over a Catholic candidate, and the South regarded the rule as protection against a northern nominee unfavorable to southern interests. At no point in the balloting did Smith receive more than a single vote from the South and scarcely more than 20 votes from the states west of the Mississippi; he never won more than 368 of the 729 votes needed for nomination, though even this performance was impressive for a Roman Catholic. McAdoo&#x27;s strength fluctuated more widely, reaching its highest point of 528 on the seventieth ballot. Since both candidates occasionally received purely strategic aid, the nucleus of their support was probably even less. The remainder of the votes were divided among dark horses and favorite sons who had spun high hopes since the Doheny testimony; understandably, they hesitated to withdraw their own candidacies as long as the convention was so clearly divided.
==== Thirtieth ballot ====
As time passed, the maneuvers of the two factions took on the character of desperation. Daniel C. Roper even went to Franklin Roosevelt, reportedly to offer Smith second place on a McAdoo ticket. For their part, the Tammany men tried to prolong the convention until the hotel bills were beyond the means of the delegates who had traveled to the convention. The Smith backers also attempted to stampede the delegates by packing the galleries with noisy rooters. Senator James Phelan of California, among others, complained of &quot;New York rowdyism&quot;. But the rudeness of Tammany, particularly their delegates&#x27; booing of William Jennings Bryan when he spoke to the convention, only steeled the resolution of the country delegates. McAdoo and Bryan both tried unsuccessfully to adjourn and then reconvene in another city, perhaps Washington, D.C., or St. Louis.

==== Forty-second ballot ====
==== Sixty-first ballot ====
As a last resort, McAdoo supporters introduced a motion to eliminate one candidate on each ballot until only five remained, but Smith delegates and those supporting favorite sons managed to defeat the McAdoo strategy. Smith countered by suggesting that all delegates be released from their pledges—to which McAdoo agreed on condition that the two-thirds rule be eliminated—although Smith fully expected that loyalty would prevent the disaffection of Indiana and Illinois votes, both controlled by political bosses friendly to him. Indeed, Senator David Walsh of Massachusetts expressed the sentiment that moved Smith backers: &quot;We must continue to do all that we can to nominate Smith. If it should develop that he cannot be nominated, then McAdoo cannot have it either.&quot; For his part, McAdoo would angrily quit the convention once he lost: but the sixty-first inconclusive round—when the convention set a record for length of balloting—was no time to admit defeat.
==== Seventieth ballot ====

It had seemed for a time that the nomination could go to Senator Samuel Ralston of Indiana. Advanced by Indiana party boss Thomas Taggart, Ralston&#x27;s candidacy might attract support from the Bryans, given that Charles Bryan had written, &quot;Ralston is the most promising of the compromise candidates.&quot; Ralston was also a favorite of the Klan and a second choice of many McAdoo delegates. In 1922, he had launched an attack on parochial schools that the Klan saw as an endorsement of its own views, and he won several normally Republican counties dominated by the Klan. Commenting on the Klan issue, Ralston said that it would create a bad precedent to denounce any organization by name in the platform. Much of Ralston&#x27;s support came from the South and West—states including Oklahoma, Missouri, and Nevada that had strong Klan elements. According to Claude Bowers, McAdoo said: &quot;I like the old Senator, like his simplicity, honesty, record&quot;; and it was reported that he told Smith supporters he would withdraw only in favor of Ralston. As with John W. Davis, Ralston had few enemies, and his support from men as divergent as the Bryans and Taggart cast him as a viable compromise choice. He passed Davis, the almost consistent third choice, on the fifty-second ballot; but Taggart then discouraged the boom for the time being because the McAdoo and Smith phalanxes showed no signs of weakening. On July 8, the eighty-seventh ballot showed a total for Ralston of 93 votes, chiefly from Indiana and Missouri; before the day was over, the Ralston total had risen to almost 200, a larger tally than Davis had ever received. Most of these votes were drawn from McAdoo, to whom they later returned.

Numerous sources indicate that Taggart was not exaggerating when he later said: &quot;We would have nominated Senator Ralston if he had not withdrawn his name at the last minute. It was a near certainty as anything in politics could be. We had pledges of enough delegates that would shift to Ralston on a certain ballot to have nominated him.&quot; Ralston wavered on whether to make the race; despite his doctor&#x27;s stern recommendation not to run and the illness of his wife and son, Ralston had told Taggart that he would be a candidate, albeit a reluctant one. But the 300-pound Ralston finally telegraphed his refusal to go on; sixty-six years old at the time of the convention, he died the following year.
==== Seventy-seventh ballot ====
==== Eighty-seventh ballot ====
==== One hundredth ballot ====
==== One hundred third ballot ====
The nomination was finally awarded to John W. Davis, a compromise candidate, on the one hundred third ballot, after the withdrawal of Smith and McAdoo. Davis had never been a genuine dark horse candidate; he had almost always been third in the balloting, and by the end of the 29th round he was the betting favorite of New York gamblers. There had been a Davis movement of considerable size at the 1920 San Francisco convention; however, Charles Hamlin wrote in his diary, Davis &quot;frankly said ... that he was not seeking [the nomination] and that if nominated he would accept only as a matter of public duty&quot;. For Vice President, the Democrats nominated Charles W. Bryan, the governor of Nebraska and the brother of William Jennings Bryan, and for many years editor of &quot;The Commoner&quot;.

== Vice presidential nomination ==
=== Vice presidential candidates ===
Thirteen names were placed into nomination for Davis&#x27; vice-presidential running mate, two of which were withdrawn before the balloting commenced. Early in the nominating process, the permitted length of speeches was limited to five minutes each. Despite this, the only ballot was chaotic, with thirty people, including five women, getting at least one vote for the nomination.

The party leaders first asked Montana senator Thomas J. Walsh to run for vice president, but Walsh refused since he desired re-election to the Senate as opposed to being a guaranteed unsuccessful vice presidential candidate. New Jersey governor George Sebastian Silzer, Newton D. Baker, and Maryland governor Albert Ritchie were also considered. Eventually, Charles W. Bryan, Governor of Nebraska, was proposed as a candidate who could unite the Smith and McAdoo factions. Bryan had been chosen by a group of party leaders, including Davis and Al Smith.

George Berry, a labor union leader from Tennessee, led Governor Bryan by a vote of 263.5 to 238 on an unrevised first ballot. Before the finalization of the first ballot, however, a cascade of switches from various candidates to Bryan took place, and Bryan was nominated with 740 votes. Notably, he remains, as of 2024, the only brother of a previous nominee (William Jennings Bryan) to be nominated by a major party.

The official tally was:

Vice Presidential Balloting / 14th Day of Convention (July 9, 1924)
== Prayers ==
Each of the convention&#x27;s 23 sessions was opened with an invocation by a different nationally prominent clergyman. The choices represented the party&#x27;s coalition at the time: there were five Episcopalian ministers; three Presbyterians; three Lutherans; two Roman Catholics; two Baptists; two Methodists; one each from the Congregationalists, Disciples of Christ, Unitarians, and Christian Scientists; and two Jewish rabbis. All of the clergy were white men; African-American denominations were not represented.

With the convention deadlocked over the choice of a nominee, some of the invocations became calls for the delegates and candidates to put aside sectionalism and ambition in favor of party unity.

Among the clergy who spoke to the convention:

* Catholics included Patrick Joseph Hayes, Archbishop of New York, and Francis Patrick Duffy, Chaplain of the New York National Guard.
* Episcopalians, such as Thomas F. Gailor, Bishop of Tennessee, and Wythe Leigh Kinsolving, Chaplain of the Virginian Society of New York.
* The roster included, on different days, two fierce antagonists and frequent debaters on the theory of evolution and Biblical inerrancy, John Roach Straton, a Baptist conservative, and Charles Francis Potter, a Unitarian Modernist.
* Rabbi Stephen Samuel Wise, founder of the Free Synagogue, who was also a delegate from New York.
* Dr. Frederick Hermann Knubel, president of the United Lutheran Churches in America.

== Legacy ==
In his acceptance speech, Davis made the perfunctory statement that he would enforce the prohibition law, but his conservatism prejudiced him in favor of personal liberty and home rule and he was frequently denounced as a wet. The dry leader Wayne Wheeler complained of Davis&#x27;s &quot;constant repetition of wet catch phrases like &#x27;personal liberty&#x27;, &#x27;illegal search and seizure&#x27;, and &#x27;home rule&#x27;&quot;. After the convention Davis tried to satisfy both factions of his party, but his support came principally from the same city elements that had backed Cox in 1920. The last surviving participant from the convention was Diana Serra Cary, who as a five-year-old child film star was the convention&#x27;s official mascot; she died on February 24, 2020, at the age of 101.

* This was the first Democratic National Convention broadcast on radio.
* The first seconding address by a woman in either national political parties was given by Izetta Jewel at this convention, seconding John Davis, and Abby Crawford Milton, seconding McAdoo.
* During his 1960 campaign, John F. Kennedy cited the dilemma of the Massachusetts delegation at the 1924 Democratic National Convention when making light of his own campaign problems: &quot;Either we must switch to a more liberal candidate or move to a cheaper hotel.&quot;
* Both Franklin D. Roosevelt and Al Smith were filmed during the convention by Lee de Forest using his Phonofilm sound-on-film process. These films are in the Maurice Zouary collection at the Library of Congress.

== &quot;Klanbake&quot; meme ==

In 2015, conservative blogs and Facebook pages started circulating a photo of hooded Klansmen, marching at the 1924 DNC. In early 2017, a pro-Donald Trump Facebook group called &quot;ElectTrump2020&quot; turned the photo into a meme which was shared more than 18,000 times on Facebook alone. Author Dinesh D&#x27;Souza shared the photo and the meme on Twitter in September 2017. In fact, the widely circulated photo depicted a December 1924 march by Klansmen in Madison, Wisconsin, and had no connection to any political convention. The term &quot;Klanbake&quot; appears to have been coined by &quot;New York Daily News&quot; columnist Joseph A. Cowan, in a satirical column reporting on the Convention at the time. Cowan also used the derisive terms &quot;klanvention&quot; and &quot;klandidate.&quot; In 2000, a &quot;Daily News&quot; reporter included the term in an historical article about the 1924 convention, stating erroneously that &quot;newspapers&quot; referred to the convention as the Klanbake, when in fact Cowan was the only writer to use the term.

<doc id="867221" wikidata="Q1432530" url="?curid=867221" title="Mercury Mountaineer">
<text>The Mercury Mountaineer is a mid-size luxury sport utility vehicle (SUV) that was sold by Mercury from 1996 until 2010. Sharing many of its features with the Ford Explorer, the vehicles were virtually identical in terms of hardware. Externally, they were styled somewhat differently, and the Mountaineer was positioned with a more upscale interior, with the Mountaineer&#x27;s MSRP coming in at $1,000–$6,000 more than the Explorer. It was last redesigned for the 2006 model year with a new frame, looking very similar to its previous model.

Some controversy resulted after the media highlighted a number of rollovers involving Explorers and Mountaineers fitted with Firestone tires. The Mountaineer was never sold in Canada. As part of the discontinuation of the Mercury brand, production of the Mountaineer ended in late 2010.

== Background ==

In 1990, General Motors introduced the Oldsmobile Bravada sport-utility vehicle, derived from the four-door Chevrolet S-10 Blazer. Though far lower in price, the Bravada was marketed as a competitor to the Range Rover (and the later Land Rover Discovery) and Toyota Land Cruiser. While sharing its body with the Blazer, Oldsmobile differentiated the Bravada with the use of model-specific trim and a dedicated all-wheel drive powertrain (in place of part-time four-wheel drive). For 1993, Jeep briefly revived the long-running Grand Wagoneer nameplate as part of the Jeep Grand Cherokee model line, using woodgrain exterior trim and a leather interior; limited sales led to its cancellation after a single model year.

As a response to the Bravada and the Grand Wagoneer, Ford introduced the 1993 Ford Explorer Limited in 1992. In contrast to the outdoors-themed Explorer Eddie Bauer, the Limited was geared towards on-road driving; it was fitted with all-wheel drive in place of traditional four-wheel drive. The Limited was also distinguished by monochromatic body trim, body-color bumpers, and chrome wheels.

As part of the redesign of the Explorer for 1995, the Limited remained part of the Explorer lineup, with the segment gaining additional competitors through the use of badge engineering. For 1996, the Acura SLX (Isuzu Trooper), Infiniti QX4 (Nissan Pathfinder), and the larger Lexus LX450 (Toyota Land Cruiser) were introduced together.

As these brands, along with Oldsmobile, competed more directly with luxury brands than the Ford model line, Ford Motor Company sought to develop SUVs for its Lincoln-Mercury division. To minimize model overlap, Mercury was chosen to sell a version of the mid-size Ford Explorer, while Lincoln would sell a version of the then-upcoming full-size Ford Expedition.

==First generation (1997–2001)==

The Mercury Mountaineer began production in April 1996 as a 1997 model. As with the Ford Explorer Limited, the Mercury Mountaineer was offered only in a four-door body configuration. After its first year, sales of the Mountaineer fell short of Lincoln-Mercury sales projections. Following several revisions in 1997 and 1998, the Mountaineer would go on to become the third-best selling vehicle in the Mercury division, behind only the Sable and the Grand Marquis.

=== Body ===
At its launch, the Mercury Mountaineer was closest in appearance to the Ford Explorer XLT, though trimmed between the Explorer Eddie Bauer and Explorer Limited. To differentiate it from its Ford counterpart, the Mountaineer was styled with a distinct dark-gray lower body color scheme; while visually similar to the Explorer, the Mountaineer adopted the chrome waterfall grille styling of the Grand Marquis. While the taillights were model-specific, the rear hatch and bumper were shared with the European-export version of the Explorer.

As part of a 1998 model revision, the Mountaineer was given a model-specific grille and headlights, larger wheels, and a new rear hatch design.

=== Chassis ===
The 1997-2001 Mercury Mountaineer shares the chassis of the four-door Ford Explorer, following its 1995 redesign. Though heavily based upon the first-generation Ford Ranger, the sport-utility vehicles are wider and are based on a separate wheelbase. As with the Ford Explorer, the Mountaineer is fitted with fully independent wishbone front suspension.

For 1997, the Mercury Mountaineer was fitted with a 215 hp 5.0L V8 with a 4-speed automatic transmission. For 1998, the 205 hp 4.0L V6 SOHC was offered as an option. Like the Ford Explorer, the V8 engine was mated to either rear-wheel drive or full time all-wheel drive (viscous coupling center differential); part-time four-wheel drive was unavailable with the V8 engine. The V6 Mountaineer was offered either as rear-wheel drive or ControlTrac with &quot;Auto&quot;, &quot;High&quot; and &quot;Low&quot; modes.

=== Trim ===
The first-generation Mercury Mountaineer was introduced in a single trim level, offering many optional features of the Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer and Limited as standard. For 1998, Mercury introduced a V6-engined version of the Mountaineer to expand its price range. Though including a different powertrain, Mercury chose to offer largely the same features on both versions.

==Second generation (2002–2005)==

The second-generation Mercury Mountaineer was introduced for the 2002 model year, redesigned alongside the five-door Ford Explorer. Ending its chassis commonality with the Ford Ranger pickup truck, the Explorer/Mountaineer adopted a dedicated platform, introducing all new underpinnings and a four-wheel independent suspension to the model lines. Though sharing much of the same body (from the firewall rearward), designers began to give the model line an identity distinct from the Explorer. While sharing the same roofline and doors, the Mountaineer received different front fenders, hood, front and rear bumpers, liftgate, headlamps and taillamps.

Previewed by a concept vehicle at the 2000 Los Angeles Auto Show, the 2002 Mercury Mountaineer marked the introduction of a new design language for the Mercury line. The traditional Mercury silver waterfall grille was made rectangular (along with headlamps wrapping into the hood), introducing silver-trimmed taillamps and satin-silver wheels and badging. In various forms, style elements of the 2002 Mountaineer would appear across the Mercury line during the 2000s, including the Grand Marquis, Montego, Milan, Monterey, and Mariner.

The second-generation Mountaineer carried over the 210 hp 4.0L SOHC V6 as the standard engine; an optional 239 hp 4.6L V8 (shared with the Grand Marquis) replaced the previous 5.0L V8. A 5-speed automatic transmission was paired with both engines, with either rear wheel drive or full-time all-wheel drive offered. Unlike its Explorer counterpart, part time four-wheel drive was not offered.

In addition, several safety features were introduced to the Mountaineer. Side curtain airbags were introduced as an option with a rollover sensor (marketed as Mercury&#x27;s Safety Canopy system); the rollover sensor allows the side airbags to deploy in the event that the vehicle tips onto its side or rolls over. Beginning midyear 2003, Mercury&#x27;s &quot;AdvanceTrac&quot; electronic stability control system was also offered as optional equipment on Luxury and Premier trims equipped with the V8 engine; it became standard across the entire Mountaineer lineup for 2005.

Initially offered in a single trim level with standalone options and packages, the second generation Mountaineer was expanded to three trim levels beginning in 2003. A base Convenience trim (slotted between the Explorer XLT/Eddie Bauer), a mid-tier Luxury trim, and a range-topping Premier trim (slotted above the Explorer Limited) to align with trims offered on other Mercury models. Upper trim versions offered features including a rear TV/DVD player, rear ceiling air vents, chrome exhaust tip and roof rack, and body-color bumpers.

==Third generation (2006–2010)==
The third-generation Mercury Mountaineer was introduced for the 2006 model year, again serving as a counterpart of the Ford Explorer. Though unchanged in wheelbase, the model line rode on an all-new chassis, gaining nearly three inches in length. In contrast to the Explorer, the third-generation Mountaineer retained many styling elements from the previous generation, introducing clear-lens taillamps, fender-mounted turn signal repeaters, larger wheels, satin-silver trim for the sideview mirrors and bumpers; the grille and tailgate received larger Mercury emblems.

Following the discontinuation of the Lincoln Aviator, the Mountaineer again served as the premium mid-size SUV offering of the Lincoln-Mercury division. To better differentiate the model line from the Explorer Eddie Bauer and Limited, Lincoln-Mercury upgraded the interior trim of the Mountaineer and carried over various features from the discontinued Aviator, including the option of a DVD-based navigation system with voice control (not offered on any Explorer until 2008). As an option, the Mountaineer Premier offered power-retracting running boards (a feature adopted from the larger Lincoln Navigator, not introduced on the Explorer until 2007).

The Mountaineer carried over the 210 hp 4.0L SOHC V6 as the standard engine, introducing a 292 hp 4.6L Modular 24-valve V8 as an option (replacing the previous 16-valve version). V6 engines were paired with a 5-speed 5R55W automatic transmission; V8 engines received an all-new 6R 6-speed automatic.

During its production, the third-generation Mountaineer saw relatively few functional changes. For 2007, &quot;MOUNTAINEER&quot; badging was returned to the doors (after a four-year absence). For 2008, side-curtain airbags were made standard. For 2009, trailer-sway control was made standard on examples equipped for towing. The navigation system was upgraded, including traffic flow monitoring and live updates on fuel prices from nearby service stations. For 2010, all trim levels received the Ford MyKey system as a standard feature; the system is a programmable security system designed for vehicles owned by multiple drivers.

== Discontinuation ==
For 2000, the Mountaineer was the third-best-selling Mercury (behind the Sable and Grand Marquis); ten years later, the model line had become the slowest-selling vehicle of the brand. Following the June 2010 announcement by Ford Motor Company to shelve the Mercury brand, 2010 would be the end of Mountaineer production; the final vehicle was produced on October 1, 2010.

Unlike the Milan, Mariner, and Grand Marquis, the Mountaineer was not produced for a short 2011 model year. While the Ford Fusion and Ford Escape has seen only detail changes for 2011 (the Ford Crown Victoria had already ended retail sales in North America), the Ford Explorer underwent a major redesign for 2011; along with several major changes to the model line, the Explorer no longer shared a body with any divisional counterparts.

Since 2020 production, Lincoln has marketed a revived Lincoln Aviator. Though again based on the Ford Explorer, the Aviator now shares no visible body panels with its Ford counterpart. 

==Firestone tire controversy==
In May 2000, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) contacted Ford and Firestone about the high incidence of tire failure on first generation Mercury Mountaineers, first and second generation Ford Explorers, and Mazda Navajo 3-doors fitted with Firestone tires. Ford investigated and found that several models of 15-inch (381 mm) Firestone tires (&quot;ATX&quot;, &quot;ATX II&quot;, and &quot;Wilderness AT&quot;) had very high failure rates, especially those made at Firestone&#x27;s Decatur, Illinois plant.

<doc id="867230" wikidata="Q373584" url="?curid=867230" title="ArtRage">
<text>ArtRage is a bitmap graphics editor for digital painting created by Ambient Design Ltd. It is currently in version 6, and supports Windows, macOS and mobile Apple and Android devices and is available in multiple languages. It caters to all ages and skill levels, from children to professional artists. ArtRage 5 was announced in January 2017 and released in February 2017.

It is designed to be used with a tablet PC or graphics tablet, but it can be used with a regular mouse as well. Its mediums include tools such as oil paint, spray paint, pencil, acrylic, and others, using relatively realistic physics to simulate actual painting. Other tools include tracing, smearing, blurring, mixing, symmetry, different types of paper for the &quot;canvas&quot; (i.e. crumpled paper, smooth paper, wrinkled tin foil, etc.), as well as special effects, custom brushes and basic digital editing tools.

==Traditional media simulation and tools==

ArtRage is designed to be as realistic as possible. This includes varying thickness and textures of media and canvas, the ability to mix media, and a realistic colour blending option, as well as the standard digital RGB blending. It includes a wide array of real life tools, as well as stencils, scrap layers to use as scrap paper or mixing palettes, and the option to integrate reference or tracing images. The later versions (Studio, Studio Pro, and ArtRage 4) include more standard digital tools, such as Select, Transform, Cloner, Symmetry, Fill, and custom brushes (&quot;Sticker&quot;).

Each tool is highly customisable, and comes with several presets. It is possible to share custom resources between users and there is a reasonably active ArtRage community that creates and shares presets, canvases, custom brushes, stencils, colour palettes, and other resources.

===Tools and features===
Real colour blending

ArtRage offers a realistic colour blending option as well as standard digital RGB based blending. It is turned off by default as it is memory intensive but can be turned on from the Tools menu. The most noticeable effect is that green is produced when yellow and blue are mixed.

The color picker supports HSL and RGB colors.

===Custom resources===

One of the less well known features of ArtRage is the custom resource options. Users can create their own versions of various resources and tools, or record scripts, and share them with other users. Users can save their resource collections as a Package File (.arpack), which acts similar to a ZIP file. It allows folders of resources to be shared and automatically installed. ArtRage can import some Photoshop filters, but not all. It only supports .ttf (TrueType Fonts) which it reads from the computer&#x27;s fonts folder.

Package files do not work with versions earlier than 3.5. ArtRage Studio does not support Photoshop filters, or allow sticker creation, and has fewer options overall.
Alternatively, individual resources can be shared directly. Most of the resources have specific file types.

==Versions==
ArtRage comes in seven current editions. The mobile apps are ArtRage for Android, ArtRage Oil Painter Free for Android, ArtRage for iPhone, and ArtRage for iPad. A version called ArtRage Touch is also available in the Windows App Store for Metro devices. The desktop versions are ArtRage Lite and ArtRage 4. A free demo version of ArtRage 4 is also available. ArtRage 1, ArtRage 2, ArtRage Studio and ArtRage Studio Pro have been discontinued.

Ambient Design releases a new edition of ArtRage on three to four yearly upgrade cycle. There is a major free update halfway through this cycle (the X.5 edition) and ongoing free patches and minor updates. Some updates continue for the previous version, although support is slowly phased out over time. For example, backdated upgrades to Studio Pro included bug fixes, DRM removal for Steam users, and a fix to allow it to work properly on OS X Mavericks, and the iPad version was updated to include Retina support.

ArtRage is also available through Steam. It was part of the very first non-gaming software launch on Steam, on October 10, 2012. The Steam version does not include DRM and can be used without Steam running.

===Languages===

ArtRage 4 is available in several languages, but the manual is only available in English. The other versions have manuals available in assorted languages. Language is chosen when installing the program (except for the ArtRage 2 alternative editions).

Japanese/Chinese are only available as Alternative Editions in ArtRage 2
* ArtRage Studio &amp; Studio Pro Wacom China Editions support English, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese.
* ArtRage 2 Japanese Edition supports: Japanese and English interfaces and manuals.
* ArtRage 2 Wacom China Edition supports Simplified Chinese interface.

===Release history===

New desktop editions of ArtRage are released approximately every three years, with a major .5 update being released halfway through. There is no official release schedule, and new updates are announced as they are ready.

Free demo versions

These were released alongside their respective editions, as trial software. The earlier editions have been discontinued, and only the current ArtRage 4 demo is now available. Work can only be exported to JPEG format and contains an ArtRage watermark. Images larger than 1280x1024 cannot be saved or exported.

* ArtRage 2.2 Free Edition: limited trial version
* Studio Pro Demo Edition: full trial version with some restrictions, expires after 30 days
* ArtRage 4 Demo edition: full trial version with some restrictions
* ArtRage Touch: one week trial through the Windows App Store
* ArtRage Oil Painter Free : limited free app on the Play Store and Amazon App Store
* ArtRage for Android: free download on some Samsung devices via the Galaxy Gifts program

===Software downloads===
ArtRage is only sold individually as an online download. It can be bought directly from the company website, or through Steam, but is not sold on any other websites. The free demo is only available from the main site. The mobile (iPad and iPhone) versions can only be bought via the Apple app store and cannot be registered on the ArtRage site. The Android version is available from the GALAXY Gift store for specific Samsung devices, and will be made available on the Samsung Apps and Google Play stores.

====Upgrades====

Upgrading from ArtRage Lite or any pre-existing desktop editions gives a permanent 50% discount on ArtRage 4 (the most recent full desktop edition). This upgrade discount is handled separately by the Steam and the ArtRage stores, so users cannot currently switch between stores.

To upgrade, owners must register their serial number in the ArtRage members area (unless it is a Steam or mobile version). This also allows users to download both the macOS and the Windows versions of their software at any time, an unlimited number of times.

Steam and mobile versions are updated through Steam and the App Store.

===Hardware bundles===

The ArtRage for Android app was released as part of a bundle deal with Samsung. It is free for the new Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and Samsung Galaxy Note Edge smartphones, distributed through the GALAXY Gifts store, and is available for purchase from the Galaxy App store for other Samsung devices. It was released for sale on the Google Play Store in February 2015.

ArtRage Lite comes free with the Wacom Intuos Draw tablet.

===Supported file types===
ArtRage uses a proprietary file type, &quot;.ptg&quot;, which stands for &quot;painting&quot;. It can only save as PTG and can only open PSD and PTG files using the File|Open command. However, images can be exported to the following formats: PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF and Adobe Photoshop&#x27;s .psd format. ArtRage can import all of these file types using the File &gt; Import Image or Import Image as Layer command. Importing PTG files will open the PNG used for thumbnail images instead (this can be used to rescue images from corrupted PTG files).
&quot;*Only when exported as an individual layer&quot;

Transparency&lt;br&gt;
ArtRage supports transparency on imported files, but not on all exported files (for example, GIF and TIFF). It is often easier to export a transparent image as an individual layer, as the Canvas settings can save as opaque on full saves for some file types and in older editions.

<text>HMS &quot;Umbra&quot; (P35) was a Royal Navy U-class submarine built by Vickers-Armstrongs at Barrow-in-Furness. So far she has been the only ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name &quot;Umbra&quot;.

==Career==

She spent most of the war in the Mediterranean, where she sank the Italian cargo ships , &quot;Francesco Barbaro&quot;, &quot;Sacro Cuore&quot;, &quot;Emilio Morandi&quot;, the Italian transport ship &quot;Manfredo Campiero&quot;, and the German cargo ship . She also sank the Italian salvage vessel &quot;Rampino&quot;, and picked up her sole survivor, and torpedoed and sank the damaged on 15 June 1942. &quot;Trento&quot; had already been damaged by a torpedo from a British Beaufort aircraft (No. 217 Squadron RAF based at Malta). She also attacked the , but her torpedoes missed their target.

&quot;Umbra&quot; also torpedoed and destroyed the grounded Italian supply ship &quot;Amsterdam&quot; on 23 October 1942, and sank the Italian tug &quot;Pronta&quot; that was trying to salvage the &quot;Amsterdam&quot;. The &quot;Amsterdam&quot; had been grounded after being hit by a torpedo in an air attack. &quot;Umbra&quot; also damaged the Italian troop ship &quot;Piemonte&quot; and the Italian cargo ship &quot;Napoli&quot;. The ship was beached and later destroyed by aircraft. She later attacked and damaged the German troop ship &quot;Macedonia&quot; north of Sousse, Tunisia. The damaged German ship was beached and abandoned. She also launched an attack on the Italian cargo ship &quot;Nino Bixio&quot;, but missed her.

One of her last actions was to attack the Italian sailing vessels &quot;Nuovo Domenico&quot; and &quot;Concetta Falco&quot; by gunfire in the Gulf of Hammamet on 11 January 1943. &quot;Nuovo Domenico&quot; was damaged in the attack.

She survived the war, was sold for scrap on 9 July 1946, and was broken up at Blyth.

<text>The Millennium Stadium (), known since 2016 as the Principality Stadium () for sponsorship reasons, is the national stadium of Wales. Located in Cardiff, it is the home of the Wales national rugby union team and has also held Wales national football team games. Initially built to host the 1999 Rugby World Cup and replacing the National Stadium, it has gone on to host many other large-scale events, such as the Tsunami Relief Cardiff concert, the Super Special Stage of Wales Rally Great Britain, the Speedway Grand Prix of Great Britain and various concerts. It also hosted FA Cup, League Cup and Football League play-off finals while Wembley Stadium was being redeveloped between 2001 and 2006, as well as football matches during the 2012 Summer Olympics.

The stadium is owned by Millennium Stadium plc, a subsidiary company of the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU). The architects were Bligh Lobb Sports Architecture. The structural engineers were WS Atkins and the building contractor was Laing. The total construction cost of the stadium was £121 million, of which the Millennium Commission funded £46 million.

The Millennium Stadium opened in June 1999 and its first major event was an international rugby union match on 26 June 1999, when Wales beat South Africa in a test match by 29–19 before a crowd of 29,000. With a total seating capacity of 73,931, it is the largest stadium in Wales and the fourth largest (and second largest outside London) in the United Kingdom by total capacity. In addition, it is the third-largest stadium in the Six Nations Championship behind the Stade de France and Twickenham. It is also the second-largest stadium in the world with a fully retractable roof and was the second stadium in Europe to have this feature. Listed as a category four stadium by UEFA, the stadium was chosen as the venue for the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final, which took place on 3 June 2017. In 2015, the Welsh Rugby Union announced a 10-year sponsorship deal with the Principality Building Society that saw the stadium renamed as the &quot;Principality Stadium&quot; from early 2016.

==History==

===Background===

Until 1969, Cardiff RFC and Wales both played their home matches on the same pitch at Cardiff Arms Park, but all this changed in the 1969–70 season. As a result of an agreement between Cardiff Athletic Club and the WRU, the National Stadium project established that a new stadium for international matches and events was required, with Cardiff RFC moving to a new, purpose-built stadium on the original cricket ground at the site of the former Cardiff Arms Park stadium. By 7 April 1984 the National Stadium was officially opened. However, in 1994, a committee was set up to consider redeveloping the National Stadium, and by 1995 the WRU had been chosen to host the 1999 Rugby World Cup.

In 1995, the National Stadium, which was designed in 1962, only had a capacity of 53,000; other nations&#x27; stadia, such as Twickenham (England) with a capacity of 75,000, and Murrayfield Stadium (Scotland) with a capacity of 67,000, had overtaken it. France was also about to build the Stade de France, which would have a capacity of more than 80,000 for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. The original capacity of the National Stadium was 65,000, but this had been reduced to 53,000, due to the Taylor Report. 11,000 of 53,000 capacity was on the East Terrace and the conversion to an all-seater stadium would have reduced the stadium capacity still further to just 47,500.

In addition to the problems of capacity, the National Stadium was also very well hidden by the neighbouring buildings to the south in Park Street, Wood Street and to the east in Westgate Street, and also by Cardiff Rugby Ground in the north. It was only fully visible from across the River Taff in the west. Access to the ground was also very restricted with the main entrance being a narrow opening in Westgate Street to the east which was shared by both vehicles and spectators alike.

The options for the new stadium included adding a third tier to the existing National Stadium, or moving to a new site. This last option was discounted because it would have required a vast car parking facility, and that would have put severe short-term pressures on the local transport infrastructure, creating traffic jams and pollution. The committee eventually chose a new stadium on the same site but with considerable increase in its capacity. It would also involve moving the alignment of the stadium from west–east to north–south. This was the option supported by the Millennium Commission. It would become the fourth redevelopment of the Cardiff Arms Park site. It was also decided that the new stadium should have a sliding roof to accommodate a multi-use venue, with a grass pitch for rugby and football. The only other sliding roofs in Europe at the time were at two Dutch stadia – the Amsterdam Arena, completed in 1996 with a capacity of 50,000; and Gelredome in Arnhem, a 30,000-capacity ground built from 1996 to 1998.

To remain on the Arms Park site, additional space had to be found to allow safe access and to provide room for the increased capacity and improved facilities. This was achieved by the purchase of adjacent buildings to the south and east and by the construction of a new £6 million River Walk by the River Taff on the western side of the stadium.

By 1999, the Millennium Stadium had replaced the National Stadium, Cardiff Arms Park, as the national stadium of Wales for rugby union and association football international matches. Cardiff RFC continued as before to play at Cardiff Arms Park rugby ground, which had replaced the cricket ground in 1969.

===Construction===

The stadium was designed by a team led by Rod Sheard at Lobb Sport Architecture, who later merged with HOK Sport to become Populous. The building contractor was Laing and the structural engineers were WS Atkins. Mike Otlet of WS Atkins designed the stadium&#x27;s retractable roof, which was constructed by Kelsey Roofing Industries. Cimolai S.p.A. from Italy fabricated and erected the 72 steel plane frames for the stands and all the 4,500 components of the roof.
Construction involved the demolition of a number of buildings, primarily the existing National Stadium (Cardiff Arms Park), Wales Empire Pool (swimming pool) in Wood Street, Cardiff Empire Telephone Exchange building (owned by BT) in Park Street, the newly built Territorial Auxiliary &amp; Volunteer Reserve building in Park Street, and the Social Security offices in Westgate Street.
The stadium was built by Laing in 1999 on the site of the National Stadium, with the head of construction being Steve Ager. It was built for the 1999 Rugby World Cup, for which Wales was the main host, with seven of the 41 matches, including the final, being played at the stadium.

The total construction cost of the stadium was £121 million, which was funded by private investment and £46 million of public funds from the Millennium Commission, the sale of debentures to supporters (which offered guaranteed tickets in exchange for an interest-free loan) and loans. The development left the WRU heavily in debt.
The Millennium Stadium was named as such in recognition of the Millennium Commission&#x27;s contribution to the building.

The stadium was first used for a major event on 26 June 1999, when Wales played South Africa in a rugby union test match before a crowd of 29,000. Wales won 29–19: the first time they had ever beaten the Springboks.

===2016 renaming===

On 8 September 2015 it was announced that the Millennium Stadium would be renamed Principality Stadium as the result of a 10-year naming rights deal with the Principality Building Society. Some fans expressed opposition on social media.

On 22 January 2016, the Millennium Stadium was officially renamed as the Principality Stadium. The new name, written bilingually (&quot;Stadiwm Principality Stadium&quot;) and covering of the upper stadium, was lit up at a special evening ceremony, to be followed by a festival to encourage grassroots rugby. The change of name also meant a change of logo for the Millennium Stadium. There were three designs shortlisted, and a panel, which included the former Wales international captain Ryan Jones and staff and members of the WRU and Principality Building Society, chose the final design. A spokesperson for the WRU said: &quot;The new stadium logo takes its inspiration from the venue&#x27;s iconic architecture; four spires, curved frontage and fully retractable roof.&quot;

==Features==
The all-seater stadium has the capacity for 74,500 supporters and features a retractable roof, only the second stadium of its type in Europe, and the largest football stadium in the world with this feature, by capacity. Additional seating is sometimes added for special events such as a rugby Test against the New Zealand All Blacks, or for the FA Cup Final. The current record attendance is set at just over 78,000, recorded at the Anthony Joshua v Carlos Takam fight, on 28 October 2017, in which Joshua successfully retained his WBA, IBF and IBO titles.

The natural grass turf was made up of a modular system installed by GreenTech ITM. It features built in irrigation and drainage. The pitch itself was laid on top of some 7,412 pallets that could be moved so the stadium could be used for concerts, exhibitions and other events.

In May 2014, after much trouble with disease and stability, the surface was removed and replaced with a more resilient interwoven sand based Desso pitch.

The four ends of the ground are called the North Stand, the West Stand, the South Stand and the BT Stand (east). The South Stand was previously known as the Hyder Stand, until Hyder was sold. The stadium has three tiers of seating with the exception of the North Stand, which has two tiers. The lower tier holds 23,154 spectators, the middle tier holding 15,626 and the upper tier holding 35,151 spectators.

The stadium was slightly restricted in size due to its proximity to Cardiff Rugby Club&#x27;s home in the adjacent smaller stadium within Cardiff Arms Park. The WRU were unable to secure enough funding to include the North Stand in the new stadium and the Millennium Commission would not allow any of its funds to be used in any way for the construction of a new stadium for Cardiff RFC. The WRU held talks with Cardiff RFC to see if it would be possible for the club to either move or secure funding for the Cardiff Arms Park to be re-developed, but these were unsuccessful. The stadium thus had to be completed with a break in its bowl structure in the North Stand, known colloquially as Glanmor&#x27;s Gap, after Glanmor Griffiths, then chairman of the WRU and now a former president.

The superstructure of the stadium is based around four masts. The stadium was built from 56,000 tonnes of concrete and steel, and has 124 hospitality suites and 7 hospitality lounges, 22 bars, 7 restaurants, 17 first aid points, 12 escalators and 7 lifts. The stadium has 7 gates for access to the site; Gate 1 is from the River Walk via Castle Street (to the north), Gates 2 and 3 are via Westgate Street (to the east), Gate 4 which was renamed Gatland&#x27;s Gate () in honour of Warren Gatland in November 2019, is for team-coaches, celebrity limousines and other uses via Westgate Street, Gate 5 is via Park Street (to the south) and Gates 6 and 7 are via the Millennium Plaza (also to the south).

Any future renovation to the stadium will involve replacing the old North Stand of the former National Stadium with a new one similar to the three existing stands of the new Millennium Stadium. This will make the stadium bowl-shaped and will increase its capacity to around 80,000. It will resolve the existing problems of deteriorating concrete quality on the old structure in the north stand. However the WRU has been more resistant to the proposal in recent years, stating that the concrete has not been deteriorating in recent years meaning the cost of replacing Glanmor&#x27;s Gap would not justify the limited increase in capacity it would provide.

In each of the stadium&#x27;s bars, so-called &quot;joy machines&quot; can pour 12 pints in less than 20 seconds. During a Wales versus France match, 63,000 fans drank 77,184 pints of beer, almost double the 44,000 pints drunk by a similar number of fans at a game at Twickenham. The stadium has a resident hawk named &quot;Dad&quot;, who is employed to drive seagulls and pigeons out of the stadium.

In 2005 the stadium installed an &quot;Arena Partition Drape System&quot; – a black curtain made up of 12 drapes measuring – to vary the audience from a capacity of over 73,000 down to between 12,000 and 46,000, depending on the four different positions that it can be hung. The curtains can be stored in the roof of the stadium when not in use. The £1 million cost of the curtain was funded by the stadium, the Millennium Commission, its caterers Letherby and Christopher (Compass Group) and by the then Wales Tourist Board. The curtain was supplied by Blackout.

In May 2015, the chairman of the WRU, Gareth Davies, announced that the stadium would be fitted with new seats, replacing the original seats from 1999 at a cost of £4 million to £5 million, which would be completed by 2018. In addition a new £3.1 million Desso hybrid pitch will be installed.

In February 2019, the stadium increased its disabled capacity from 168 to 214 at a cost of around £100,000. As a result, the overall capacity of the stadium was reduced from 74,500 to 73,931.

===Statue of Sir Tasker Watkins===

A statue of Sir Tasker Watkins, the former WRU president between 1993 and 2004, was commissioned to stand outside Gate 3 of the stadium. The bronze statue, tall, was sculpted by Llantwit Major based sculptor Roger Andrews. The Welsh Government contributed £50,000, as did Cardiff Council. It was officially unveiled on 15 November 2009 by his daughter, Lady Mair Griffith-Williams.

==Usage==

As well as international rugby union and association football, the Millennium Stadium has hosted a variety of sports, including, rugby league (including the Challenge Cup Final on three occasions between 2003 and 2005, the opening ceremony of the 2013 Rugby League World Cup and Welsh Rugby League internationals), speedway, boxing, the Wales Rally Great Britain stage of the World Rally Championship, Monster Jam and indoor cricket. The indoor cricket match between The Brits and a Rest of the World team for the Pertemps Power Cricket Cup, which took place on 4 and 5 October 2002.

===Rugby union===
The stadium is the home of the Welsh rugby union team, who play all of their home fixtures at the venue. These games include those during the Six Nations, as well as the Autumn Internationals against nations from the Southern Hemisphere. Apart from the national team, the stadium has also hosted the European Rugby Champions Cup finals on five occasions. In total, the site, including the National Stadium, has hosted the final of the European Rugby Champions Cup on seven occasions.

The stadium has also been used for Celtic League games, and the semi-finals of the Anglo-Welsh Cup in 2006 and 2007. Since 2013, the Millennium Stadium has hosted Judgement Day, a double-header between the four Welsh United Rugby Championship teams. The 2016 edition had 68,262 spectators, the highest in the history of the league.

The stadium hosted the first match in the 2005 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand when they drew 25–25 against Argentina in a warm-up test match.

Welsh Varsity rugby matches

On 30 March 2011, the stadium hosted the Welsh Varsity rugby match for the first time in the history of the match between the senior teams of Cardiff University and Swansea University. The stadium is used alternating years with Liberty Stadium in Swansea. The Welsh Varsity event celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2016.

Rugby World Cup

The Welsh Rugby Union hosted the 1999 Rugby World Cup with the Final being played at the stadium. The stadium also hosted 3 pool matches and 1 quarter-final match (New Zealand 18–20 France) of the 2007 Rugby World Cup.
On 15 October 2011, the stadium was open to Welsh Rugby Union fans free of charge, providing that they wear red so that they could watch a live screening of the 2011 Rugby World Cup semi-final between Wales and France that was played at Eden Park, Auckland, New Zealand. The match was screened on the stadium&#x27;s existing large screens, on all of their television screens and on a screen that was brought in for the occasion. The same was done for the Bronze Final between Wales and Australia which saw Wales defeated and take fourth place.

The stadium hosted six pool matches, including two featuring Wales, and two quarter-final matches during the 2015 Rugby World Cup.

===Rugby league===
The stadium first hosted rugby league football during the 2000 World Cup: a double header featuring Cook Islands versus Lebanon and Wales versus New Zealand that attracted a crowd of 17,612. It was again used as Wales&#x27; home ground during the 2002 New Zealand rugby league tour of Great Britain and France when they again hosted the Kiwis this time attracting 8,746 spectators.

The Stadium has hosted three Challenge Cup Finals, which are usually played at Wembley, from 2003 to 2005. In 2003 the Bradford Bulls defeated the Leeds Rhinos 22–20 in front of 71,212 fans. St. Helens defeated Wigan 36–16 in 2004 in front of 73,734 fans, while Hull F.C. defeated Leeds 25–24 in 2005 in front of 74,213 fans, the largest rugby league crowd at the stadium.

Also, in 2007 the stadium hosted the inaugural Millennium Magic weekend. This was a two-day event in May when an entire round of Super League matches were played, three games on the Saturday and three games on the Sunday. The event was deemed a success by the sport&#x27;s governing body, the RFL, and second Millennium Magic event took place in May 2008, although the 2009 and 2010 events were held at Murrayfield Stadium and were renamed Magic Weekend. In 2011, Magic Weekend moved back to Cardiff with the opening round of Super League being played.

On 26 October 2013, the Millennium Stadium hosted the opening ceremony and the first two fixtures of the 2013 Rugby League World Cup: a double-header featuring Wales against Italy and England against title favourites and eventual tournament champions Australia. This double header produced an overall attendance of 45,052, which is an international rugby league record at the stadium.

===Association football===
From 2000 to 2009, the stadium was the almost-permanent home of Welsh football. The national team played the vast majority of home matches at the Millennium Stadium, with a handful of friendly matches once or twice a year at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham or Liberty Stadium, Swansea. The first Welsh football game at the stadium was played against Finland in 2000, and drew a then-record home crowd for Welsh football of over 66,000. This has since been beaten on several occasions. However, since 2010, the majority of home games have been played at the smaller Cardiff City Stadium, the home of Cardiff City. Wales have only played at the stadium twice since 2009; in 2011 against England and in 2018 against Spain.
While the Millennium Stadium was under construction, the original Wembley Stadium had hosted the Welsh rugby team during the building of the new ground. The favour was returned from 2001 while the new Wembley Stadium was being built, with the Millennium hosting:

*FA Cup Final
*League Cup Final
*Football League Trophy Final
*Football League play-off Finals
*FA Community Shield

The stadium became notorious for an apparent &quot;away team hoodoo&quot;; the first 11 major cup finals were all won by the teams occupying the home dressing room. Stoke City beat Brentford 2–0 in 2002 to end the &quot;hoodoo&quot;, after Paul Darby carried out a feng shui blessing.

Liverpool were the first team to win the FA Cup at the Millennium Stadium in 2001 after beating Arsenal 2–1. They were also the first team to win the League Cup at the Stadium, defeating Birmingham City in a penalty shoot-out earlier that year. In 2003, Liverpool won the League Cup for the seventh time in their history thanks to a 2–0 win over Manchester United in the final at the stadium. Liverpool also won the last FA Cup Final at the Millennium Stadium in 2006, beating West Ham United 3–1 in a penalty shoot-out that followed a 3–3 draw after extra time in what was billed as &#x27;the best cup final of the modern era&#x27;.

The Football League Third Division play-offs in 2003 saw AFC Bournemouth beat Lincoln City 5–2. In this game, Bournemouth set a new record for the most goals scored by one team in a single match at the stadium. This record has since been matched but not beaten. The last domestic cup match played was when Doncaster Rovers beat Bristol Rovers 3–2 after extra time in the Football League Trophy Final on 1 April 2007.

In 2001, the Football Association of Wales (FAW) confirmed that they had bid to host the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final. The stadium had recently been rated as a five-star stadium by UEFA, making it one of the favorites to host the match, but the final was eventually awarded to Old Trafford, the home of Manchester United.
It was suggested that the stadium would have been one of the venues of a proposed UEFA Euro 2016 championship hosted jointly by Wales and Scotland. However, the bid did not reach the formal UEFA selection stage, having been abandoned by the Welsh and Scottish Football Associations for financial reasons. In April 2014, the FAW did submit a formal bid to host three group matches and either a round of 16 match or a quarter-final at Euro 2020, which UEFA planned to host at 13 venues across Europe. When the host venues were voted on in September 2014, the Millennium Stadium lost out by a single vote behind Glasgow&#x27;s Hampden Park, a decision that FAW chief executive Jonathan Ford put down to UEFA politics. The stadium, however, would be selected for UEFA Euro 2028. On 30 June 2015, the Millennium Stadium was chosen as the venue for the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final. UEFA rules meant it could not be branded as the Principality Stadium during the event, resulting in all titles and logos – as well as those of other non-UEFA sponsors – being covered or removed for the duration. The game was played on 3 June 2017 between Italian club Juventus and Spanish club Real Madrid, in a repeat of the 1998 final; Real Madrid won the match 4–1.

When London was selected as the host city for the 2012 Summer Olympics, the Millennium Stadium was named as one of the six venues for the football competition. It had the distinction of hosting the opening event of the Games – a 1–0 win for the Great Britain women&#x27;s team against New Zealand – as well as four other group games and a quarter-final in the women&#x27;s tournament, and three group games, a quarter-final and the bronze medal match in the men&#x27;s.

===Boxing===
There have been five nights of boxing at the stadium.
On 8 July 2006 when Matt Skelton beat Danny Williams for the Commonwealth heavyweight title. On 7 April 2007, Joe Calzaghe beat Peter Manfredo to retain his WBO super middleweight belt. On 3 November 2007, Calzaghe beat Mikkel Kessler to retain his WBO super middleweight belt and win the WBA and WBC super middleweight titles.

On 28 October 2017 Anthony Joshua successfully retained his WBA (Super), IBF and IBO heavyweight titles against mandatory challenger Carlos Takam with a 10th round stoppage.

On 31 March 2018, it hosted the World heavyweight unification fight between Anthony Joshua, holder of the WBA and IBF belts, and Joseph Parker, holder of the WBO belt. Joshua beat Parker on points.

===Motorsports===
In 2001, the stadium staged its first ever motorsport event, hosting the Speedway Grand Prix of Great Britain, which continued annually, attracting a record crowd of 44,150 in 2010. The temporary motorcycle speedway track was in length and with sections of the stadiums lower seating bowl covered, the capacity of the stadium for the Grand Prix was set at 62,500. The 2025 event was cancelled for commercial reasons.

In September 2005 the stadium was host to the first ever indoor stage of the World Rally Championship during the Wales Rally Great Britain. The lower tier of the stadium was removed to create a figure-of-eight course. In addition to this, the stadium has also hosted Supercross events. In October 2007, the stadium first hosted the UK leg of the Monster Jam trucks Europe tour, and returned in June 2008, again in 2009, 2010, 2016, 2018 and 2019.

===Film===
The stadium has been used on numerous occasions as a venue for shooting film and television productions. Scenes from the 2001 Hindi film &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; were filmed there.

Between 2004 and 2011, the stadium was used several times as a filming location for episodes of the BBC science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The 2005 episode &quot;Dalek&quot; was shot primarily on location at the stadium, using its underground areas to represent a bunker in Utah, US, in the year 2012. The location shooting for the episode took place during October and November 2004. The underground areas of the stadium were used again in August 2005 to film Mission Control scenes for the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Christmas special, &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot;, and again the following year to film scenes in the underground corridors of Torchwood in &quot;The Runaway Bride&quot; episode, broadcast on Christmas Day 2006. Shots of the Stormcage Facility in which River Song is incarcerated in series 5 and 6 of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; are also in the stadium, filmed between October 2010 and January 2011.

The stadium has also been used as a location for the filming of Doctor Who spin-off The Sarah Jane Adventures. The 2010 story, &quot;Death of the Doctor&quot;, included corridor scenes for the UNIT headquarters that were filmed underground at the Millennium Stadium.

The Wembley Stadium scene in the film &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot; was actually filmed at the Millennium Stadium. Although the outside is footage of Wembley, the inside is all filmed in Cardiff. The visual effects team on the film edited the footage to make it look more like Wembley.

Sébastien Foucan jumped over the gap of the opening of the stadium roof in the parkour documentary &quot;Jump Britain&quot;.

===Eventing===
The inaugural Express Eventing International Cup took place at the stadium on 30 November 2008. The three-event competition made up of dressage, cross-country and show jumping all took place over the one day. The event was won by Oliver Townend.

===Concerts===

The stadium has also been used for a variety of musical events, including the Manic Street Preachers concert held on Millennium Eve, and, on the following day, a recording of the BBC&#x27;s Songs of Praise, which attracted an attendance of 60,000. Tina Turner performed a sold-out concert at the stadium during her highly successful Twenty Four Seven Tour in 2000. Welsh rockers Stereophonics have played two sold-out shows at the stadium: In July 2001 as part of their two-day &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; festival which would later be released to DVD and in 2003, shortly after the departure of the late Stuart Cable.

American rock band Bon Jovi played the venue during the One Wild Night Tour in 2001. At the end of January 2005, the stadium hosted a tsunami relief concert in aid of the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, with Eric Clapton headlining the event. The stadium has also been host to Madonna on two occasions, the first in July 2006 when she opened the UK leg of her Confessions Tour, and most recently in August 2008 when she kicked off her Sticky &amp; Sweet Tour at the stadium. Other performers who have played at the stadium include Robbie Williams as part of his Weddings, Barmitzvahs &amp; Stadiums Tour, U2 as part of their Vertigo Tour, Red Hot Chili Peppers as part of their By the Way tour, The Rolling Stones as part of their A Bigger Bang Tour, R.E.M. as part of their Monster tour and again for their Around the Sun tour.

Paul McCartney also played at the stadium as part of his Up and Coming Tour, and The Police performed there as part of their Reunion Tour. In late 2005, Oasis played at the stadium during their Don&#x27;t Believe the Truth Tour and again on their Dig Out Your Soul Tour in 2009. In 2008, the stadium hosted Neil Diamond and Bruce Springsteen with the E Street Band as part of their Magic Tour, On 22 August 2009, U2 again played at the stadium, as part of their European leg of their U2 360° Tour, playing to a record-breaking concert attendance of 73,354. On 17 May 2023, Beyoncé performed at the stadium as part of her Renaissance World Tour. Taylor Swift played at the stadium on 18 June 2024 as part of The Eras Tour. In 2024, it was announced Oasis would play at the stadium on the 4th and 5th of July 2025 as part of their UK and Ireland Reunion tour.

===Conferences===
The stadium offers conferencing facilities via the foodservice organisation Compass Group. The facilities consist of six individually designed lounges and 124 pitch-facing executive box suites.

In addition to business events, the facilities are also available for dinners, banquets, balls, parties and weddings receptions.

===Temporary hospital===

On 28 March 2020 it was announced that the stadium was to be converted at a cost of £8 million into a temporary field hospital to accommodate up to 2000 patients of the COVID-19 pandemic, at the same time as the Excel Centre, London, NEC, Birmingham, and the Manchester Central Convention Complex. By the weekend of 11–12 April 2020, it had a capacity of 330 beds.

===Professional wrestling===
On 12 April 2022, American professional wrestling company WWE announced that it would hold a major event at Millennium Stadium on 3 September, and opened pre-registration for tickets. The event was announced as being WWE&#x27;s largest show in the UK since SummerSlam at the original Wembley Stadium in 1992. On 29 April 2022, it was announced that the event would be titled Clash at the Castle, in reference to nearby Cardiff Castle. The event attracted over 59,000 ticket pre-sale registrations, a company record.

<text>RAF Bentley Priory was a non-flying Royal Air Force station near Stanmore in the London Borough of Harrow. It was the headquarters of Fighter Command in the Battle of Britain and throughout the Second World War. The Royal Air Force station closed its operations on 30 May 2008, with all units relocating to new accommodation at RAF Northolt, a few miles away.

The station incorporated Bentley Priory, which was originally built in 1766. Since its closure, the Officers&#x27; Mess has converted into the Bentley Priory Museum with exhibits focusing on the house&#x27;s role in the Battle of Britain. The grounds have been redeveloped as a private residential housing estate.

==History==
===Early history===
In early 1926, the Bentley Priory estate, which dates from 1766, was broken up and the Priory building and 40 acres (comprising the present grounds) were sold to the Air Ministry for a sum thought to be about £25,000.

On 26 May 1926, Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB) was formed at Hillingdon House, at RAF Uxbridge. The formation was radically reorganized with the creation of Bomber, Coastal, Fighter and Training Commands. The existing ADGB was dissolved and RAF Fighter Command emerged on 14 July 1936. It left Hillingdon House, at RAF Uxbridge, on this date and moved to Bentley Priory with its first Air Officer Commanding Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding. Fighter Command Headquarters remained at the Priory until its merger with the other operational commands in 1968.

A poem translated from Thomas Gray&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;Luna Habitabilis&#x27; (&quot;Cambridge 1797) is associated with the Priory. A copy of the poem was given to the Air Officer Commanding 11 Group on 22 November 1989 by the Rt Hon The Lord Harvington, who stated that he had intended reading it out to the House of Commons at the end of the Battle of Britain, but the copy had been lost. At the time Harvington was Wing Commander in the RAuxAF and Conservative member for St Pancras North. He felt it appropriate to quote this 18th-century prophecy:

:&quot;The time will come, when thou shalt lift thine eyes,
:To watch a long drawn battle in the skies,
:While aged peasants, too amazed for words,
:Stare at the flying fleets of wond&#x27;rous birds,
:England so long the mistress of the sea,
:Where winds and waves confess her sovereignty,
:Her ancient triumph yet on high shall bear,
:And reign, the sovereign of the conquered air.&quot;

===Fighter Command===
RAF Fighter Command operated under Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding with Air Commodore A D John Cunningham as his Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) and Air Commodore Napier John Gill as Air Officer Administration (AOA).

Because of his brilliant detailed preparation of Britain&#x27;s air defences for the German assault, and his prudent management of his resources during the battle, Dowding is today generally given the credit for Britain&#x27;s victory in the Battle of Britain. Dowding&#x27;s time leading Fighter Command left a lasting legacy on the organisation. His creation of the Operations and Filter Rooms, the essential elements of the Command, Control and Communications system, became the cornerstone of the Air Defence System. The system he developed gave air controllers the best chance of scrambling fighter squadrons to intercept &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; raids before they reached their targets. This rapid, flexible approach was essential because there were insufficient aircraft and crews to keep fighter patrols continuously airborne in 1940.
He also played a significant part in encouraging research into night-fighter equipment and tactics. Historian and Dowding biographer, Robert Wright, who served as Dowding&#x27;s personal assistant in the Battle of Britain, wrote in his book, &quot;Dowding and the Battle of Britain&quot;, that even when faced with threats of retirement and constant rebuttal, Dowding continued to give his all to those under him and the RAF service. Dowding noted in a letter Air Ministry in early March 1940, that:

Dowding&#x27;s subsequent downfall has been attributed by some to his single-mindedness and perceived lack of diplomacy and political savoir faire in dealing with intra-RAF challenges and intrigues, most obviously the still, even now, hotly debated Big Wing controversy in which a number of senior and active service officers had argued in favour of large set-piece air battles with the Luftwaffe as an alternative to Dowding&#x27;s successful Fabian strategy. Another reason often cited for his removal, but characterised by some contemporary commentators more as a pretext, was the difficulty of countering German nighttime bombing raids on British cities.

Bentley Priory continued to act as the Headquarters of Fighter Command throughout the Second World War. It assumed additional importance as the Air planning headquarters for D-Day, as the planning for the full operation was conducted at near Portsmouth, with Montgomery, Eisenhower and Churchill attending a nearby church the evening before the assault. Much of the detailed air planning work was carried out at Kestrel Grove just a few hundred yards away (this building still stands and is now a retirement home). On D-Day, the landings were monitored by King George VI, Winston Churchill and U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower in the Allied Expeditionary Air Force War room in the Priory&#x27;s underground bunker.

===Anti-Aircraft Command===
On 1 April 1939, HQ Anti-Aircraft Command (AAC) was formed under General Alan Brooke, but on 28 July 1939, he was suddenly moved to command the British Forces and General Sir Frederick Alfred Pile took over. Anti-Aircraft Command then moved to &quot;Glenthorn&quot; in the grounds of Bentley Priory.

===Wellington crash===

On 16 October 1940 a Vickers Wellington of the Czechoslovak-crewed No. 311 Squadron RAF collided with a cable of one of the barrage balloons protecting Bentley Priory. The aircraft had been on a bombing mission from RAF East Wretham to Kiel, but suffered icing and the failure of its compass and radio and was badly off-course. The Wellington crash resulted in the death of five of its six crew. They were buried in a single shared grave, from Bentley Priory, at Pinner New Cemetery. The tail gunner survived with serious burns. He later retrained as a fighter pilot and served with No. 312 (Czechoslovak) Squadron RAF.

===Airstrip===
With the requirement for frequent high-level meetings the need for an airstrip at Bentley Priory grew. Air Commodore Richard Atcherley undertook this project in late 1943. The Air Ministry War Department advised him that it would take six months to construct two strips, so he approached the United States Army Air Forces. Cinder landing strips were laid in just four days.

===Royal Observer Corps===
The Observer Corps moved to RAF Bentley Priory from its original location at RAF Uxbridge, along with Dowding and Fighter Command, in July 1936 and remained at the Priory until it was stood down in December 1995. The Observer Corps was one of the cornerstones of Lord Dowding&#x27;s air defence system and he said later in his despatch after the Battle of Britain:

When the Corps&#x27; first Commandant Edward Masterman stood down in April 1936, Alfred Warrington-Morris replaced him and took control of the Observer Corps in the important period immediately prior to the Second World War. He oversaw the move of HQ Observer Corps to Bentley Priory and the Corps&#x27; adoption by RAF Fighter Command. He also controlled the Corps during the memorable events of the Battle of Britain and was still at the helm when the Observer Corps was granted the title &quot;Royal&quot; to become the Royal Observer Corps and became a uniformed branch of the RAF in April 1941. Warrington-Morris was Mentioned in dispatches in July 1940.

Initially the Observer Corps&#x27; presence at Bentley Priory included not only the small headquarters&#x27; staff of a dozen officers and support staff but also around sixty spare time observers who filled essential plotting tasks in the Bentley Priory operations rooms. In 1955 the observers relocated to a new dedicated ROC operations centre in nearby Watford.

The Royal Observer Corps was stood down on 30 September 1991 and, in 1992, a Royal Observer Corps stained glass window to mark the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, was installed in the officers&#x27; mess at RAF Bentley Priory. The original Royal Banner, presented in 1966, was laid up at St Clement Danes Church in the Strand in 1991. A new banner, presented by Elizabeth II at Bentley Priory in July 1991, was laid up at the Rotunda at the RAF College Cranwell in Lincolnshire.
===Post-war operations===
Princess Elizabeth first visited the Priory in November 1950. On 30 April 1968, Fighter Command was amalgamated with other operational commands to form Strike Command. Bentley Priory also became the Administrative Headquarters for RAF Strike Command, although this function moved to High Wycombe in 1972.

===Fire===
In the evening of 21 June 1979 a major fire destroyed most of the main staircase as well the Dowding Room. Cubitts had been carrying out refurbishment work and the company&#x27;s insurance policy covered most of the repair work, which cost £3.1 million.

===Closure===
RAF Bentley Priory was latterly home to the Defence Aviation Safety Centre, Air Historical Branch (AHB) and RAF Ceremonial. As there was no enduring operational use for RAF Bentley Priory, however, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) released the site as part of its Greater London estate consolidation project, Project MoDEL (Ministry of Defence Estates London).

Project MoDEL is making a major contribution to the consolidation of the Defence Estate in Greater London through the delivery of three key outputs: the development of an integrated &#x27;core site&#x27; at RAF Northolt; the re-location of the London-based units; and the disposal of surplus sites. Accordingly, DASC, AHB and RAF Ceremonial relocated to RAF Northolt in 2008 following the completion of their new accommodation. A total of £180 million GBP ($295 million US in 2008) of the £300 million GBP released from Project MoDEL has been re-invested back into RAF Northolt.

A final dinner was held for the Battle of Britain veterans in July 2007 to celebrate the role of the building and those who worked in it in preventing Hitler&#x27;s planned air invasion of Britain in 1940. The sunset ceremony was carried out by the Queen&#x27;s Colour Squadron and there was a flypast by the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight and a Eurofighter Typhoon. The salute was taken by the Station Commander Squadron Leader Phil Reid, the Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Sir Glenn Torpy and Air Commodore (Ret) Pete Brothers, Chairman of the Battle of Britain Fighter Association.
The final closure Sunset ceremony took place on 30 May 2008, when the RAF ensign was lowered at RAF Bentley Priory for the last time. The station officially closed the following day, and all remaining lodger units moved to RAF Northolt.

==Bentley Priory Museum==

The former Bentley Priory Officers&#x27; Mess, which became the Bentley Priory Museum in September 2013, includes the original office of Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding (later Lord Dowding), Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief Fighter Command in the Battle of Britain, preserved with its original furniture. Other Battle of Britain historic artefacts are kept in the Museum, including one of the few remaining Battle of Britain Lace Panels.

Other items in the Museum include a number of &quot;trophies&quot; taken by the Royal Air Force from the Luftwaffe at the end of World War II, including an eagle statue and a bust of Hermann Göring.

The Officers&#x27; Mess was also notable for the number of Royal Portraits hanging in the building; there were two of HM The Queen, one in the Dining Room as a young woman and a second that hung in the Ladies&#x27; Room that was commissioned and paid for by the Royal Observer Corps to mark their 50th Jubilee Year, painted at Bentley Priory depicting Her Majesty in her ROC Commandant in Chief regalia and with a background of the Italian Gardens. There was also a portrait of His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh (dressed in a flying suit, hanging in the Dining Room on the wall facing the Queen), one of George VI (in RAF No 1 uniform wearing a &#x27;chip bag&#x27; and wings, which hangs in the Abercorn Bar) and one of The Queen Mother (gifted to the Mess by the Queen Mother after she paid for refurbishment following the fire).

==Redevelopment==
Following the closure of the RAF station the site was handed over to Defence Estates, who in turn passed it to the prime plus contractor for Project MoDEL, VSM Estates, a company formed by developers Vinci PLC and St. Modwen Properties PLC, who are responsible for developing proposals and the subsequent disposal of the site to developers who will realise the scheme.

Under Supplementary planning guidance agreed in 2007 by London Borough of Harrow the site will include a museum open to the public in the main rooms of the house, recording and interpreting the history of the site and in particular the Battle of Britain and Cold War heritage. The plans were put on hold in 2009 as a result of the economic climate in Britain, although in 2010 it was agreed that the museum would go ahead and be run by the Bentley Priory Battle of Britain Trust, with support from the charity The Prince&#x27;s Regeneration Trust. The plans for the site included the conversion of the grade II* listed mansion into luxury flats, above the museum. The restoration and classical style development for the site was carried out to a design by Nigel Anderson of ADAM Architecture.

On 12 September 2013, the Bentley Priory Museum was officially opened by Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall.

The Cold War bunker was surveyed by English Heritage, who concluded there were other examples of similar bunkers across the country in better condition. In March 2010 the bunker was filled in, leaving only the exterior doors and walls. The RAF Bentley Priory Battle of Britain Trust supported VSM Estates in the decision to fill in the bunker on the grounds of maintenance costs. The bunker had replaced the Second World War bunker in the 1980s.

<text>Heppenheim (Bergstraße) is the seat of Bergstraße district in Hesse, Germany, lying on the Bergstraße on the edge of the Odenwald. It is best known for being the birthplace of Sebastian Vettel, a four-time Formula One World Champion and the place of founding of the Free Democratic Party (Germany).

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The town is set on the vineyards below the mediaeval Starkenburg (castle). Defining for the townscape, besides the castle, is &quot;St. Peter&quot;, the “Cathedral of the Bergstraße” as the big Catholic church is known locally; it was consecrated on 1 August 1904, and is not a bishop&#x27;s seat. Heppenheim lies centrally on &quot;Bundesstraßen&quot; 3 and 460, and Autobahn A 5/A 67, almost halfway between Heidelberg and Darmstadt, in southern Hesse on the boundary with Baden-Württemberg, and is Hesse&#x27;s southernmost district seat.
The town&#x27;s official designation is “Heppenheim an der Bergstraße”. In the local Hessian German dialect, the town is also called &quot;Hepprum&quot;.

Heppenheim´s biggest lake is the Bruchsee. Multiple streams such as the Hambach, Stadtbach, Erbach und Brombach flow from the east and down the valleys of the Odenwald into the Weschnitz, the town&#x27;s western border.

“Bergstraße” is not only the name given the road running from Darmstadt to Heidelberg on the western edge of the Odenwald and eastern edge of the Rhine rift (now &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; 3), but also one given the landscape along the road. It stands out with its unusually mild and sunny climate in which trees blossom especially early.

In the area around the outlying centre of Ober-Laudenbach is a boundary oddity unique in Hesse: just there within the town&#x27;s municipal area are two enclaves belonging to Baden-Württemberg, within one of which is a further enclave belonging to Hesse.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Heppenheim borders in the north on the town of Bensheim, in the northeast on the community of Lautertal and the town of Lindenfels, in the east on the communities of Fürth, Rimbach, Mörlenbach and Birkenau, in the south on the community of Laudenbach (Rhein-Neckar-Kreis, Baden-Württemberg), in the southwest on the towns of Viernheim and Lampertheim and in the west on the town of Lorsch.

=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town, Heppenheim has the outlying centres of Unter-Hambach, Ober-Hambach, Kirschhausen (with Igelsbach), Erbach, Sonderbach, Wald-Erlenbach, Mittershausen-Scheuerberg, and Ober-Laudenbach, which were in the course of municipal reform in Hesse amalgamated with Heppenheim with effect from 1 January 1972.

== History ==
In 755, Heppenheim had its first documentary mention. At that time, the town was the hub of a Frankish domain. In 773, this area became one of Charlemagne’s donations to the Lorsch Abbey, and to protect it, the castle (Starkenburg) was built above it in 1065; in 1066 it successfully resisted a siege by Prince-Archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg-Bremen. The Imperial Abbey held the rank of principality, and Heppenheim developed over time into the territory&#x27;s administrative and economic hub, although it lost its importance with the Abbey&#x27;s downfall in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1229, Emperor Friedrich II put the Starkenburg under the administration of the Archbishops of Electoral Mainz, doing likewise with the Lorsch Abbey along with Heppenheim in 1232. But for an interruption from 1461 to 1623 when the fief was pledged to the Electorate of the Palatinate, Heppenheim remained an Electoral Mainz holding right up until the &quot;Reichsdeputationshauptschluss&quot; in 1803. Then it became Hessian, first part of the Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt, and since 1948 it has been part of the &quot;Bundesland&quot; of Hesse.

Heppenheim has had town rights since at least 1318, and market rights, it is believed, already by the early 9th century. From 1265 (possibly earlier) until 1803, Heppenheim was the seat of the Electoral Mainz &quot;Amt&quot; (&quot;Oberamt&quot;) of Starkenburg. Once it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt, the &quot;Amt&quot; was abolished. Heppenheim was thereafter first the seat of a (much smaller) &quot;Amt&quot;, and then, as of 1821 the seat of the Heppenheim Administrative Region (&quot;Landratsbezirk&quot;). As of 1832 it was the seat of the Heppenheim district. Since then, it was between 1848 and 1852 the seat of the &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; of Heppenheim, and has been since 1938 the seat of the Bergstraße district, to which were assigned not only the old Heppenheim district, but also great parts of the likewise abolished Bensheim district, with the parts of the Worms district on the Rhine’s right bank being added after the Second World War.

In both 1369 and 1693 (in the latter case owing to the devastation wrought by the French in the Nine Years&#x27; War), Heppenheim was almost utterly destroyed in town fires. The town came through both world wars unscathed, aside from slight damage when the Americans marched in March 1945.

Heppenheim suffered severely in the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–48); the Starkenburg was overwhelmed by Spanish troops in 1621, and by the Swedes in 1630. The Plague killed about 80% of the population in 1635 (almost 100% in the outlying countryside), and the town was sacked by the Poles in 1636 and again in 1645 by the French.

The Heppenheim Conference (&quot;Heppenheimer Tagung&quot;), a meeting of leading liberals on 10 October 1847 in the &quot;Halber Mond&quot; (“Half Moon”) Hotel, was a prelude to the German Revolution in 1848 and 1849. Given this historical connection, the Free Democratic Party (FDP, &quot;Freie Demokratische Partei&quot;) was founded on 11 December 1948 in Heppenheim.

There were Jews living in Heppenheim by the Middle Ages. The town was part of the Archbishopric of Mainz from 1232 to 1803 and there were repeated ecclesiastical measures undertaken to persecute Jews. Jewish life in the town was wiped out during the persecution that accompanied the Plague in 1348 and 1349. The modern community was founded in the 17th century. About 1900, there were some 40 Jewish families, with 200 to 300 people living in town. That figure fell to 113 people by 1933, a result of migration and emigration.
Martin Buber, Zionist and honorary professor of religious sciences at the University of Frankfurt am Main, is the best known Jewish inhabitant of Heppenheim where he settled in 1916. In February 1938, he left the country and emigrated with his family to Jerusalem. On 9 November 1938, Kristallnacht, Buber&#x27;s house was looted and his 3,000-volume library was destroyed. In May 1939, there were still 37 Jews in Heppenheim, but in September 1942, the last few Jewish residents were deported. The former synagogue&#x27;s location, now a memorial, has stone marking the perimeter of the synagogue destroyed in 1938. A plaque bears the inscription, &quot;Hier stand die 1900 erbaute und 1938 zerstörte Synagoge.&quot; (“Site of the synagogue, built in 1900 and destroyed in 1938.”). An additional plaque with the title &quot;Im Gedenken an die Ermordeten&quot; (“In memory of the murdered”) lists the names of 29 former Heppenheim Jews. The psychiatric institution in Heppenheim took part in the Nazi “euthanasia” crimes, and was also a “collection facility,” where Jewish psychiatric patients were sent on the way to the gas chamber.

Beginning on 28 May 1942, a subcamp of Dachau/Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp was located in Heppenheim. It was closed on 18 December 1942, but opened again as Heppenheim subcamp on 15 June 1943. It was permanently closed on 27 March 1945 when the town was occupied by American troops at the end of the fighting in Hesse. The prisoners in Heppenheim were put to work in the SS institution &quot;Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Ernährung und Verpflegung&quot;.

In 1955, the town celebrated its 1,200th anniversary and opened the new open-air stage &quot;Freilichtbühne&quot;. It is still in use today, seats around 2500 people and also proved its worth at the Hessentag 2004.

In 2004, the town hosted the 44th Hessentag state festival.

== Population development ==

The sharp rise between 1971 and 1975 has to do with the amalgamations in the course of administrative reform in Hesse in 1972.

== Politics ==
In 1948 the Free Democratic Party was founded in Heppenheim. Furthermore, the liberal Heppenheimer Versammlung was one of the starting points of the German revolutions of 1848–1849.

=== Town council ===

The municipal election held on 26 March 2006 yielded the following results:

The elections in March 2021 showed the following results:
*CDU: 14 seats
*SPD: 6 seats
*The LEFT: 1 seat
*FDP: 4 seats
*GLH: 7 seats
*FWH: 2 seats
*LIZ: 1 seats
*Tiers.: 2 seats

=== Mayors ===
In the runoff election on 10 April 2005, Gerhard Herbert (SPD) defeated the incumbent Ulrich Obermayr (CDU). Herbert took over the mayor&#x27;s office on 1 September 2005 from Obermayr, who had held it for 18 years. In 2011 Rainer Burelbach (* 1965) (CDU) was elected mayor with 55,6 % of the votes. Burelbach was reelected in 2017 and 2023.

The following mayors have held office in Heppenheim since the municipal constitution was promulgated in 1821:


Since 1924, beginning with Karl Schiffers&#x27;s time in office, the office of mayor has been executed by a professional mayor.

Among all the mayors, Wilhelm Höhn, Karl Schiffers and Wilhelm Metzendorf stand out as ones who decisively promoted the town.

=== Coat of arms ===
The town&#x27;s arms are charged with the Lion of Hesse above the parting, striped as always horizontally in silver and red, but in these arms also holding a golden-hilted, silver-bladed sword in his right paw and wearing a golden crown. The part of the field below the parting at the fess line is itself parted per pale (vertically down the middle). On the dexter side (armsbearer&#x27;s right, viewer&#x27;s left) is the Lorsch Abbey&#x27;s cross pattée fitchy (that is, cross with “flattened” ends to three of the arms, and a point on the bottom one) on a silver field. On the sinister side (armsbearer&#x27;s left, viewer&#x27;s right) is the silver six-spoked wheel of Mainz on a red field.

The arms, bestowed on the town on 30 August 1913 by Grand Duke Ernest Louis of Hesse, symbolize the town&#x27;s historical allegiances (a Lorsch holding from 773 to 1232, a Mainz holding until 1803, and after that Hessian), but without any reference to the town&#x27;s time with the Electorate of the Palatinate, which from 1461 to 1623 held it from Mainz as a pledge. The old, historical coat of arms showed a sitting bishop, symbolizing Electoral Mainz&#x27;s hegemony.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Heppenheim is twinned with:
* Kaltern an der Weinstraße, Italy (1971)
* Le Chesnay, France (1975)
* West Bend, United States (2004)

===Sponsorship===
Since 1956, together with the town of Bubenreuth, there has been a sponsorship arrangement with regard to Luby, formerly Schönbach in the district of Eger in the Sudetenland (now in the Czech Republic).

==Culture and sightseeing==

=== Sightseeing ===


Heppenheim has (as at 30 April 2008) 408 cultural monuments that are under monumental protection. The following is a selection:
* Marketplace with Town Hall, timber-frame houses and &quot;Marienbrunnen&quot; (fountain)
* Starkenburg (castle) on the Schlossberg (mountain)
* Catholic Parish Church of St. Peter (“Cathedral of the Bergstraße”)
* Electoral Mainz &quot;Amtshof&quot;
* Former power station built in 1899 in Gothic Revival style
* Open-air stage, built in 1955 on the Kappel, on the occasion of the 1,200-year jubilee 

Heppenheim has at its disposal a largely preserved, self-contained, picturesque Old Town core with an area of about 8 ha, within which are found all the sights mentioned in the foregoing list. The Old Town is characterized by timber-frame houses dating back mostly to the reconstruction in the early decades after Heppenheim&#x27;s destruction in the Nine Years&#x27; War in 1693, which was done over the remains of the medieval town. Of the town wall, however, which was largely knocked down in the early 19th century, little remains.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Heppenheim is part of the economically strong Rhine Neckar Area, as well as the Rhein-Main area.
Together with various neighbouring towns and communities (among others Bensheim, Lorsch and Lautertal), Heppenheim is identified as a middle centre in the South Hesse Regional Plan.

The town has in its favour good economic data – even in relation to the Rhine Neckar Area&#x27;s and the Starkenburg Region&#x27;s as a whole – above-average employment figures and an especially high proportion of graduates in the resident population&#x27;s above-average buying power.

=== Transport ===

Heppenheim is linked by several buslines to Jugenheim, Grasellenbach and Mörlenbach. Heppenheim station is found in the town centre, and the two-track Main-Neckar Railway links the town to Heidelberg and Frankfurt am Main.

=== Industry ===
In 1899, one of Europe&#x27;s first power stations was built in Heppenheim. Two steam engines furnished electricity beginning in 1900 for Heppenheim and Bensheim. After the Second World War, many industrial operations settled in town, from such fields as machine building (KLN Ultraschall AG), mining (Granitwerke Röhrig in the outlying centre of Sonderbach), textile and food production (among others, a great Langnese-Iglo GmbHproduction plant) and the analytical industry (WICOM). This array of businesses was also later filled out by further ones from the fields of logistics, marketing and services. On &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; 3, near the state boundary, the mineral spring business Odenwald-Quelle has been running since 1932.

=== Winegrowing ===
Heppenheim is a winegrowing town belonging to the Hessische Bergstraße wine region. With some 450 ha of vineyards it was originally Germany&#x27;s smallest self-contained wine region (but since Reunification it has been the second smallest). Two hundred and thirty hectares alone – roughly half – can be found in Heppenheim and its two outlying centres of Hambach and Erbach. They are marketed under the banner name “Heppenheimer Schlossberg” with the individual designations Centgericht, Stemmler, Steinkopf, Schlossberg, Maiberg and Eckweg (until 2004 there was also Guldenzoll).

Owing to the especially favourable climate and good soil conditions on the Bergstraße, mainly dry and dryish wines of very high quality are made here. The main variety is Riesling. The biggest producer is the Bergsträßer Winzer eG cooperative, with its seat in Heppenheim, which also owns Hesse&#x27;s biggest wine cellar. The &quot;Bergsträßer Staatsweingut&quot; (“state wine estate”) with its seat in Bensheim maintains the &quot;Hessischer Rebmuttergarten&quot; (“Vineyard Mother Garden”), formerly a vineyard cultivation facility whose goal was to fight the phylloxera, introduced from North America but only cropping up on the Bergstraße itself in 2005, by grafting phylloxera-proof hybrid rootstocks onto vines of nobler varieties. At the Bergsträßer Winzer eG begins the 6.9 km-long &quot;Erlebnispfad Wein und Stein&quot; (“Wine and Stone Adventure Path”), which runs through the vineyards with 30 stations.

=== Education ===
The Odenwaldschule, once Germany&#x27;s oldest comprehensive school, was in the Ober-Hambach section of Heppenheim. It was founded by Edith and Paul Geheeb in 1910 and was based on their concept of holistic education reform, integrating work of the head and hand. The boarding school used to have up to 250 pupils. After a scandal about sexual abuse cases in the 1970s and 1980s and attempts to save the institution, it was closed in 2015. There are plans for renovating the location.
Heppenheim is also home to the European Hotel Academy.

<text>The Hamburg cell () was, according to U.S. and German intelligence agencies, a group of radical Islamists based in Hamburg, Germany, that included students from different Arab countries who eventually came to be key operatives in the September 11 attacks. Important members included Mohamed Atta, who led the four hijacking teams in 2001 and piloted American Airlines Flight 11; Ramzi bin al-Shibh, who conspired with the other three members but was unable to enter the United States; Marwan al-Shehhi, who piloted United Airlines Flight 175; and Ziad Jarrah, who piloted United Airlines Flight 93 and failed to hit a target in Washington, D.C.. Other members included Said Bahaji, Zakariya Essabar, Mounir el-Motassadeq, and Abdelghani Mzoudi.

==Background==

On November 1, 1998, future-hijackers Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, and Ramzi bin al-Shibh moved into a spacious apartment (two bedrooms, one living room, one kitchen) together on Marienstraße. Here they formed the secretive &quot;Hamburg cell,&quot; which also included other minor participants in the 9/11 plot. They met together three or four times a week to discuss their anti-American and anti-Israeli views and to decide how best to fight for their cause.

As late as 1999, the four core members of the group had intended to wage jihad in Chechnya, where Islamic jihadists were rebelling against Russia. The &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot; notes in Chapter 5 that &quot;according to bin al-Shibh [who is now in U.S. custody], a chance meeting on a train in Germany caused the group to travel to Afghanistan instead. An individual named Khalid al Masri (or Khalid al-Masri) approached bin al-Shibh and Shehhi (because they were Arabs with beards, bin al-Shibh thinks) and struck up a conversation about jihad in Chechnya. When they later called Masri and expressed interest in going to Chechnya, he told them to contact Abu Musab in Duisburg, Germany. Abu Musab turned out to be Mohamedou Ould Slahi, who was well known to U.S. and German intelligence. 

Bin al-Shibh, Shehhi and Jarrah visited Slahi in Duisburg, where he convinced them that it would be best to train in Afghanistan first, because further experience would be useful, and anyway it was difficult at that time to get into Chechnya. Slahi instructed them to travel to Karachi, Pakistan, then to the Taliban office in Quetta, Pakistan, where they were to contact a man named Umar al-Masri. Atta and Jarrah left Hamburg during the last week of November 1999. Shehhi left by himself around the same time; bin al-Shibh followed two weeks later. Slahi denies any involvement with Al-Qaeda by 1999, having previously fought with the group against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. He attests that he hosted the trio as an act of hospitality to fellow muslims.

&quot;Umar al-Masri&quot; turned out to be a nonexistent person. The name was a code word that instructed members of the Taliban office to escort the men to Kandahar, Afghanistan, where they were convinced to join the al-Qaeda network and wage jihad against America. They met with Osama bin Laden himself and swore their loyalty to him. Mohamed Atta was chosen by Bin Laden as the leader of the group that would attack America; Atta would contact Bin Laden several more times before the attacks. The men then returned to Germany to enroll in flight training school, and later moved on to flight training schools in the United States at the recommendation of one of their instructors based in Germany.

The members of the Hamburg Cell were a boon to the 9/11 plot, which Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had proposed to Bin Laden in 1996. The Hamburg students were fluent in English, educated, accustomed to the Western lifestyle, radically Islamic, and capable of learning to pilot aircraft. &quot;Bin Laden and Mohammed Atef wasted no time in assigning the Hamburg group to the most ambitious operation yet planned by al-Qaeda,&quot; the &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot; says.

Many al-Qaeda members lived in the Hamburg apartment at various times. In all, 29 men listed the apartment as their home address while Mohamed Atta&#x27;s name was on the lease. Reportedly, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed visited the apartment repeatedly.

German intelligence monitored the apartment, but did not find any evidence against the residents. Both the United States&#x27; Central Intelligence Agency and German Intelligence have received criticism for failing to share information on these and other al-Qaida members.

==&quot;Hamburg Cell&quot; film==
The film &quot;Hamburg Cell&quot; is a docudrama on the planning and execution of the attacks. A co-production between Channel 4 in the UK and CBC in Canada, it was shown in the UK during September 2004, amid criticism that this was too close to the anniversary of the attack. Using computer-generated imagery, the film&#x27;s producers were able to show the twin towers of the World Trade Center, before the attack, in the background. Ziad Jarrah is featured calling his girlfriend, Aysel Sengün, from a public telephone at the airport, repeating the words &#x27;I love you&#x27; over and over.
