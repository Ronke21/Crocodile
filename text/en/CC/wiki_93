<text>MS Silja Europa is a cruiseferry constructed at Meyer Werft Germany for the Swedish ferry operator Rederi AB Slite, a part of Viking Line. At 59,914 gross tonnage (GT), she is the largest ship commissioned for and to ever operate for Tallink Silja, and is the tenth-largest cruiseferry in the world.

Just before she was due for delivery, Slite entered economic difficulties and could no longer afford the ship, so Meyer Werft kept her and she was soon chartered to Viking Line&#x27;s rival, Silja Line. She was put on the Helsinki–Stockholm route, replacing MS &quot;Silja Serenade&quot; which was put to the Turku–Mariehamn–Stockholm route, but the two ships swapped routes with each other again in 1995.

==History==

MS &quot;Silja Europa&quot; was commissioned by Rederi AB Slite and launched on 23 January 1993. As a result of the 1990-1994 Swedish financial crisis, the Swedish krona was floated in 1992 and consequently lost value. The &quot;Europa&quot; became more expensive for Slite, whose bank, Nordbanken, had stopped guaranteeing loans. Combined with the construction of other ships, Slite was declared bankrupt in April 1993.

She was christened the &quot;Silja Europa&quot; in Hamburg, Germany on 5 March 1993, then registered the next day to Fährschiff Europa KB. With a ten-year charter to Finnish cruisferry company Silja Line, &quot;Silja Europa&quot; made her maiden voyage on 14 March 1993.
On 28 September 1994, &quot;Silja Europa&quot; was the first vessel to receive the Mayday message from the sinking MS &quot;Estonia&quot;, and became the second vessel to arrive on-scene (after MS &quot;Mariella&quot;) following &quot;Estonia&#x27;s&quot; capsizing and sinking. The captain of &quot;Silja Europa&quot;, Esa Mäkelä, was appointed On-Scene Commander for the rescue operation.

In January 2000, a catalytic converter was installed at Aker Finnyards in Rauma, Finland. The funnel received a new blue paintjob, and the ship&#x27;s safety system was renewed. This was made following the incident of &quot;Estonia&quot;.

Silja Line was sold to Estonian shipping company Tallink in May 2006 - the Silja Line brand was initially kept separate, but most of its ships (including the &quot;Silja&quot; &quot;Europa&quot;) are now in Tallink livery. &quot;Silja Europa&quot;&#x27;s home port was changed to Tallinn and entered Tallink&#x27;s Helsinki–Tallinn service on 23 January 2013. She was then sailed to Australia on a 14-month charter as an accommodation ship for the Gorgon LNG project at Barrow Island. After this charter, Tallink returned &quot;Silja Europa&quot; to their Helsinki-Tallinn service on 13 March 2016.
In 2021, she was hired by Devon and Cornwall Police for a ten-day period during which she is to be moored in Falmouth and used to accommodate police officers during a G7 summit in Carbis Bay scheduled for 11–13 June 2021. In October, she moved to the River Clyde and was berthed at Inchgreen Quay, Greenock, to provide accommodation for delegates at the COP26 summit.

Since September 2022, the MS &quot;Silja Europa&quot; is docked at Velsen-Noord to shelter 1,000 asylum seekers until February 2023. The ship arrived in Velsen-Noord on Wednesday September 21st. The ship passed through the IJmuiden Sea Lock at around 6:30 a.m. that morning and moored at the VOB (Velsen Offshore Base ) quay an hour later. 

==Accidents and incidents==
*28 September 1994 &quot;Silja Europa&quot; was the first vessel to receive the Mayday message from the sinking MS &quot;Estonia&quot;, and became the second vessel to arrive on-scene (after MS &quot;Mariella&quot;) following &quot;Estonia&#x27;s&quot; capsizing and sinking. The captain of &quot;Silja Europa&quot;, Esa Mäkelä, was appointed On-Scene Commander for the rescue operation.
*13 January 1995 - &quot;Silja Europa&quot; ran aground close to Furusund, Sweden, due to a failure in the automatic speed control system. She continued under her own power to Stockholm, where she was taken out of service and then delivered to Naantali for repair.
*10 October 1996 - A passenger reported that he saw someone jumping overboard. This was reported to the captain, who notified the Swedish Coast Guard - however, instead of stopping the ship (as is procedure), he continued to Stockholm. Later, the Swedish Coast Guard found the person, a female passenger, in the sea. Her body temperature was very low and she died a couple of days later in hospital of hypothermia. The ship&#x27;s captain was prosecuted and found guilty of not stopping as he should have, but was not punished.
*20 August 1997 - The ship collided with a German sailing-boat south of Lemland due to heavy fog. A German couple and their dog were rescued by one of &quot;Silja Europa&quot;&#x27;s lifeboats. The sailing boat began to take on water and was later towed to Föglö by the Finnish Border Guard.
*28 September 2002 - A female passenger fell overboard and swam to a nearby islet, from where she was later rescued
*22 November 2009 - Experienced a steering fault while underway from Stockholm to Turku in the Åland archipelago. The ship would have been in immediate danger of running aground, but the ship&#x27;s crew made it stop by using asymmetric thrust. The ship&#x27;s emergency steering (KaMeWa BACK-UP) could not be used because the rudder shaft had broken. Silja Europa had 1,373 passengers at the time of the incident. The ship was steered from the shallow and cramped area to wider waters, where it circled for almost a day. The ship was steered using bow thrusters, while there was a continuous effort of diagonosing and fixing the problem at the same time. The next morning, the tug Ukko arrived at Silja Europa and helped it move towards Turku. A team of divers who arrived with the tug investigated the ship&#x27;s fault at Airisto and found that the fault was caused by damage to the rudder shaft. Silja Europa was supposed to be in Turku on Sunday evening at 7:15 pm, but didn&#x27;t arrive until Monday, November 23 at 4:30 pm. The ship left for a repair dock on November 26. During the repair procedures, Silja Europa was replaced on the Turku-Stockholm route by M/S Baltic Queen. Silja Europa returned to service on 19 December 2009.
*19 October 2019 - Two Finnish passengers (25 y/o and 21y/o) were found deceased in a cabin in the Port of Tallinn

<doc id="871129" wikidata="Q959236" url="?curid=871129" title="Frans van Mieris the Elder">
<text>Frans van Mieris the Elder (16 April 163512 March 1681), was a Dutch Golden Age genre and portrait painter. The leading member of a Leiden family of painters, his sons Jan (1660–1690) and Willem (1662–1747) and his grandson Frans van Mieris the Younger (1689–1763) were also accomplished genre painters.

==Biography==

Frans was born and died in Leiden, where his father Jan Bastiaans van Mieris was a goldsmith, carver of rubies and diamond setter. His father wished to train him to his own business, but Frans preferred drawing, and studied with Dutch Golden Age painter Jacob Toorenvliet&#x27;s father, Abraham Toorenvliet, a glazier who kept a school of design. From his own father&#x27;s shop he became familiar with the ways and dress of people of distinction. His eye was fascinated in turn by the sheen of jewelry and stained glass; and, though he soon left Toorenvliet for the workshops of Gerard Dou and Abraham van den Tempel, he acquired the Leiden fijnschilder manner over the Amsterdam finish of the disciples of Rembrandt.

He seldom chose panels of which the size exceeded 12 to 15 inches, and whenever his name is attached to a picture above that size, it is reasonable to assign it to his son Willem or to some other imitator. Unlike Dou when he first left Rembrandt, or Jan Steen when he started on an independent career, Mieris never ventured to design figures as large as life. Characteristic of his art in its minute proportions is a shiny brightness and metallic polish.
The subjects which he treated best are those in which he illustrated the habits or actions of the wealthier classes; but he sometimes succeeded in homely incidents and in portrait, and not infrequently he ventured on allegory. He repeatedly painted the satin skirt which Ter Borch brought into fashion, and he often rivalled Ter Borch in the faithful rendering of rich and highly coloured woven tissues. But he remained below Ter Borch and Metsu, because he had not their delicate perception of harmony or their charming mellowness of touch and tint, and he fell behind Gerard Dou, because Frans was hard and had not Dou&#x27;s feeling for effect by concentrated light and shade. In the form of his composition, which sometimes represents the framework of a window enlivened with greenery, and adorned with bas-reliefs within which figures are seen to the waist, his model is certainly Dou.

It is questionable whether Houbraken has accurately recorded this master&#x27;s birthday. One of his best-known pieces, a party of ladies and gentlemen at an oyster luncheon, in the Hermitage at St Petersburg, bears the date of 1650. Celebrated alike for composition and finish, it would prove that Mieris had reached his prime at the age of fifteen. Another beautiful example, the &quot;Doctor Feeling a Lady&#x27;s Pulse&quot; in the gallery of Vienna, is dated 1656; and Waagen, in one of his critical essays, justly observes that it is a remarkable production for a youth of twenty-one. In 1657 Mieris was married at Leiden in the presence of Jan Potheuck, a painter, and this is the earliest written record of his existence on which we can implicitly rely. Of the numerous panels by Mieris, at least twenty-nine (such as &quot;Young Woman Stringing Pearls&quot;) are dated—the latest being an allegory, long in the Ruhl collection at Cologne, illustrating what he considered the kindred vices of drinking, smoking and dicing, in the year 1680.
Mieris had numerous and distinguished patrons. He received valuable commissions from Archduke Leopold, the elector-palatine, and Cosimo III de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. His practice was large and lucrative, but never engendered in him either carelessness or neglect. If there be a difference between the painter&#x27;s earlier and later work, it is that the former was clearer and more delicate in flesh, whilst the latter was often darker and more livid in the shadows. When he died his clients naturally went over to his son Willem, who in turn bequeathed his painting-room to his son Frans. But neither Willem nor Frans van Mieris the Younger equalled Frans the elder.

The pictures of all the generations of the Mieris family were successfully imitated by A. D. Snaphaan, who lived at Leipzig and was patronized by the court of Anhalt-Dessau. To those who would study his deceptive form of art a visit to the collection of Wörlitz near Dessau may afford instruction.

==Theft==
In early June 2007, &quot;A Cavalier (Self Portrait)&quot;, dated to 1657–1659, was stolen from the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. The painting had been donated to the Art Gallery of NSW in 1993 by media figure and philanthropist, James Fairfax.

<doc id="871130" wikidata="Q1422400" url="?curid=871130" title="Raising Helen">
<text>Raising Helen is a 2004 American comedy-drama film directed by Garry Marshall and written by Jack Amiel and Michael Begler. It stars Kate Hudson, John Corbett, Joan Cusack, Hayden Panettiere, siblings Spencer and Abigail Breslin, and Helen Mirren. It grossed $37,486,512 at the U.S. box office.

==Plot==
Helen, Jenny, and Lindsay Harris are close sisters living in New York; the eldest Jenny raised the other two after their mother died when they were young. Jenny and Lindsay are responsible stay-at-home mothers while Helen, an executive assistant to the CEO of one of Manhattan&#x27;s most prestigious modeling agencies, enjoys a lavish, carefree lifestyle.

One morning, Helen receives a call from Jenny who tells her Lindsay and her husband Paul have died in a car accident, leaving behind their three children, 15-year-old Audrey, 10-year-old Henry, and 5-year-old Sarah. At an appointment with Lindsay&#x27;s attorney, Helen and Jenny are shocked to discover Lindsay has appointed Helen the guardian of the children. Both sisters are given a letter that Lindsay had left for them.

Forced to give up her wild lifestyle and move to Queens, Helen initially struggles to raise the children on her own. As time goes by, her concentration at work begins to slip and she is fired as a result, leading her to become a receptionist at a car dealership. Helen and Jenny get into a fight about how best to raise the children and they stop talking. Things later start to improve for Helen after she begins dating Dan Parker, the children&#x27;s school principal and pastor, who helps her bond with them.

Audrey starts to fall in with the wrong crowd at school and gets an older boyfriend called BZ. When she disappears after prom, Helen is forced to call Jenny for backup, too scared to take control of the situation on her own in fear that Audrey will hate her if confronted. Audrey is found at a motel with BZ, and Helen later turns the children over to Jenny&#x27;s custody, much to their dismay.

Helen goes back to work and slowly returns to her previous way of living, but soon realizes she is not happy. She goes to Jenny&#x27;s to take the children back, adamant she is ready to put her foot down and be a mother, but Jenny asks her to leave and think about it some more. Later that night, as Helen sits alone in the nearby park, Jenny appears and allows Helen to read her letter from Lindsay; in it, Lindsay explains she chose Helen to care for her children because their personalities are so similar and she wanted the children to have a mother figure who reminds them of her.

Finally having accepted Helen can cope, Jenny returns the children to her the following morning, and they happily begin to settle into their new family life.

<text>Willem van Mieris (3 June 166226 January 1747) was an 18th-century painter from the Dutch Republic.

==Biography==

Willem van Mieris was a painter, sculptor and etcher active in Leiden. He was born in Leiden and studied under his father Frans van Mieris the Elder (1635–1682), who was a successful genre painter. Willem had a reasonably successful career, being supported by a few patrons who commissioned and collected various of his works. His oeuvre consists mostly of genre and portraiture, with some landscape painting, as well as some sculptures. Van Mieris&#x27; style was that of the (painters in the &quot;fine manner&quot;), and his genre works, especially later in his career, depicted scenes from upper-class society.

At age 19, Van Mieris took over the family workshop after his father died in 1681, aged 45. He had barely finished his training in the family studio and it would take another two years before he entered the Leiden painters&#x27; guild in 1685. He set out to uphold his father&#x27;s reputation as a Leiden &quot;fijnschilder&quot;. The Leiden fine painters produced a small scale of mostly genre paintings or portraits with high attention to detail, which was made popular by Frans&#x27; master Gerrit Dou (1613–1675), a Dutch Golden Age painter. Frans&#x27; superb skills as a painter rubbed off on his son and his influence can be seen in technique, subject matter, and style. He finished what was left incomplete on his father&#x27;s demise. One year later, in 1684, he married his wife Agneta Chapman, whom he often used as his model.

Besides genre and portrait painting, Van Mieris was also a skilled landscape painter, etcher, and draughtsman; moreover, he also tried his hand at history painting with remarkable results. He acted as headman and once as dean of the Leiden Guild of St. Luke in 1693. A year later, in 1694, he founded a drawing academy in Leiden together with the painters Jacob Toorenvliet (c. 1636–1719) and Carel de Moor (1655–1738), which he and de Moor directed until 1736. At that time, Van Mieris stopped working as an artist because he became partially blind and no dated work passes the 1730s.

Van Mieris was born in a family of Dutch painters. Not only his father, but also his brother and son had a background in art. Jan van Mieris (1660–1690) studied under his father Frans the Elder, as well as under Gerard de Lairesse (1641–1711), to eventually become a genre and portrait painter. Willem&#x27;s son, Frans van Mieris the Younger (1689–1763), was a pupil of his father. He worked as a genre painter and writer, and was considered a distinguished antiquary, who published works of merit on numismatics and history. Such a family background in art, good relationships with wealthy collectors and patrons, and apprenticeships with successful 17th-century masters seems to have made the choice of profession easier in families such as the Van Mierises. Willem, Jan, and Frans II, all direct descendants of the famous seventeenth century fine painter Frans I van Mieris, were bound for prestigious positions in the city, resulting in steady income from the commissions from affluent citizens.
== Artistic career ==
===Style and influences ===
The &quot;fijnschilders&quot;, whose activity was mainly concentrated in Leiden, included many of the most popular painters of the time, such as Gerard Dou and Willem&#x27;s father: needless to say, the latter had a decisive influence in shaping young Willem&#x27;s style. In fact, Frans van Mieris was among the most famous Dutch painters of the late 17th century, his popularity crossing the Netherlands&#x27; border time and again: he was highly esteemed by both Cosimo III de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and Archduke Leopold of Palatinate, who was to become Emperor Leopold I. His paintings are mostly elegant genre scenes, but they show us the main features of the conception of painting: even in scenes representing trivial subjects, the Leiden painters strove for absolute perfection in rendering details and refining features in order to achieve absolute elegance. Willem van Mieris, having been introduced to, and trained in, painting by his father, could not but be heavily influenced by the ideas, ultimately becoming a member of the second generation of Leiden fine painters.

However, Willem van Mieris soon parted ways with Frans when it came to subject matter. In fact, although he still focused on genre painting, his works usually depict scenes taken from the life of the upper class, and even when the protagonists belong to the low spheres of the society, they look much more elegant and refined than their real-life counterparts. This is mainly due to the influence exerted on Willem van Mieris by Gerard de Lairesse, whose &quot;Groot Schilderboek&quot;, published in 1707, marked the transition from the 17th to the 18th century in Dutch art. In his extensive treatise, de Lairesse stated that the aim of genre painters should no longer be representing the human figure as it is (which was one of the pivotal features of Dutch Golden Age painting), but as it ought to be according to the classical canons of beauty. More specifically, de Lairesse claimed it was necessary to ennoble genre painting, in order to take it to the same level of excellence and public admiration awarded to history painting. To achieve this purpose, the Amsterdam art theoretician proposed that the human protagonists of genre painting (especially women), no matter which social class they belonged to, be represented after classical antiquity sculptures, with their unsurpassable perfection and proportion. De Lairesse&#x27;s views fascinated Van Mieris, especially after he had the opportunity to experiment directly with classicizing figures thanks to the sculptures of the Flemish artist Francis van Bossuit, who had previously lived and worked in Italy and took inspiration from classical antiquity sculpture for his works. Van Mieris drew many illustrations after Bossuit&#x27;s sculptures, and borrowed some of their poses for his paintings.
Another distinctive feature of van Mieris&#x27;s oeuvre is the repetition of certain figures and poses in many of his paintings. This phenomenon, which was actually widespread among both Dutch 18th century history and genre painters, can yet again be tracked back to the new classicizing tendencies of Dutch art. In fact, the social scenario in the Netherlands changed dramatically after 1672, the so-called &quot;year of calamities&quot;, and the subsequent war against France, England, and several German states: the aftermath of the conflict saw most of the commercial power of Holland ending up shattered, thus drastically reducing the number of rich collectors interested in buying new works of art. Subsequently, the painters started to modify their style in order to get accustomed with the predominant taste of the few, powerful regents left in the country, who usually aimed at formally elegant and proportionate paintings rather than truthful representations of real life such as those produced during the Golden Age. Thus, artists like Willem van Mieris, who dedicated himself both to history and genre painting, started using figures taken from mythological and biblical works in genre scenes, trying to present them either as common people or, more frequently, as exponents of the nobility, of course with an appropriate background setting (e.g. a richly decorated Palladian villa). Moreover, reusing the same motifs and figures in several paintings allowed the artists to save time and energy, thus leading them to produce more works and having more possibilities of finding an interested collector.

Willem van Mieris&#x27; artistic approach to painting included the repetition of similar figures and the features of figures. This approach provided both practical and aesthetic benefits to the artist. Not only did it allow the artist to be highly productive in the studio, it also allowed him to trademark his own type of idealized female figure throughout his oeuvre. Comparisons have been drawn between Willem van Mieris and Gerard ter Borch, another Dutch genre painter of the Dutch Golden Age, who used the technique of repeating figures to realize their common goal of increasing productivity while reducing labour. Willem van Mieris has also been compared to artists like Gerard ter Borch, Gerard Dou, and Jan Steen, for their shared artistic approach to painting which involved designing a group of interacting figures first, and subsequently designing the setting which the figures occupied.

Painters like Willem van Mieris reused not only their own figures, but also those present in paintings by the masters of the previous generations. This was again due to the necessity of pleasing the few patrons and collectors, who greatly admired the works of artists such as Gerard Dou, a member of the first generation of &quot;fijnschilders&quot;. Willem van Mieris explicitly refers to Dou in two different paintings the subject of which is almost directly borrowed from the eminent master. In this respect, Van Mieris proved to be discreet enough to carefully choose which elements to take from other painters&#x27; works in order not to be accused of plagiarism, which was already an issue at the time. In fact, specific guidelines had already been established about how to refer to paintings by previous masters without ending up with mere copies of their work, which were obviously despised as signs of the painter&#x27;s incapability of producing a work on his own.

One of the major characteristics of Willem van Mieris&#x27; artistic style is his idealization of the female nude. Van Mieris&#x27; idea of beauty in genre paintings is deeply rooted in and modeled after his studies of classical sculpture. The artist&#x27;s reference to classical sculpture follows the instructions outlined by Gerard de Lairesse for the improvement of genre painting in his book Groot Schilderboek. De Lairesse suggested that artists should refer to classical sculpture to create an idealized female nude form and should adapt this form to ordinary women within the context of genre painting, a suggestion that is evidently followed by Willem van Mieris throughout his genre paintings.

One of Willem van Mieris&#x27; major influences was Francis van Bossuit (1635–1692). Van Bossuit studied Italian sculpture in Rome and was esteemed as a sculptor in Amsterdam from 1680 until his death. Willem van Mieris turned to Van Bossuit&#x27;s classicized sculptures to develop his own aesthetic for portraying idealized female nudes. Frits Scholten, the senior curator of sculpture at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, has suggested that Willem van Mieris borrowed poses and gestures directly from Francis van Bossuit&#x27;s sculptures and applied them throughout his own oeuvre. Between the years 1669 and 1702, Willem van Mieris made at least thirteen drawings on parchment modeled after van Bossuit&#x27;s sculptures, believed to have been produced as works of art rather than preparatory studies for his history paintings.

===Models===
Agneta Chapman, Willem van Mieris&#x27; wife, is considered to have acted as the artist&#x27;s first model. During the beginning stages of van Mieris&#x27; career between 1680 and 1687, the artist produced numerous paintings and drawings depicting young women often represented as mythological figures, which were modelled after his wife. In van Mieris&#x27; painting &quot;Flora&quot;, which currently resides in the Morgan Library &amp; Museum in New York, it is suggested that Agneta served as the model. In this painting, van Mieris disguises his wife as Flora, the ancient Roman goddess of flowers, fertility and spring. The inclusion of peonies helps signify feminine beauty and fertility, which is appropriate given the context of the painting&#x27;s execution taking place only one year before Willem&#x27;s and Agneta&#x27;s wedding. A similar face, suggested to be modeled after Agneta&#x27;s, reappears in many of van Mieris&#x27; early works, including &quot;Allegory of Arrogance&quot; from 1684, &quot;Old Man Seducing a Young Woman&quot; from 1683, &quot;Artemis Holding an Arrow&quot; from 1686, and &quot;Woman with a Bird Cage (Lesbia)&quot; from 1687. Comparisons have been drawn between Willem van Mieris and Rembrandt, who used his wife Saskia as the model for his depiction of the goddess Flora.
==Patrons and legacy==

===Patrons and collectors===
Willem van Mieris was supported mostly by two patrons: Johan Hendrik van Wassenaer Obdam (1683–1745) and the De la Court Family. Count Van Wassenaer Obdam was a nobleman and politician from The Hague, who also was a great art lover and collector. He was one of the most important clients of Van Mieris and showed great interest in Dutch genre paintings, also called &quot;modern&quot; pieces at the time. He appreciated paintings that represented the familiar, everyday circumstances. The 1750 sales catalogue of his collection (121 pieces) that was made after his death tells us that Van Wassenaer owned work by Adriaan van Ostade, Gerard Dou, Jan Steen, Frans I van Mieris, Gabriel Metsu, and Willem van Mieris. The catalogue mentions no fewer than 10 paintings by Willem van Mieris: seven genre paintings, one of which might be An Old Man Reading a Newspaper, and three landscapes. The most outstanding pieces are four genre paintings representing a kitchen or shop scene. The family archive of Van Wassenaer in Twickel has provided evidence that the two men had a close relationship: Van Wassenaer bought paintings directly from van Mieris, including &quot;A Kitchen with a Fishmonger&quot;, &quot;A Woman Weighing Chestnuts&quot;, &quot;A Grocer&#x27;s Shop&quot;, &quot;Interior with Monkeys&quot;, and two landscapes. However, it remains unclear whether Van Wassenaer commissioned Van Mieris to make these paintings, but the regular purchase of expensive paintings from the artist himself suggest that the two had close and regular contact. Van Mieris probably selected subject matter that appealed to Van Wassenaer in order to establish even better relations.

The arguably more important patron, however, was Pieter de la Court van der Voort (1664–1739), son of Pieter de la Court (1618–1685) and his second wife, Catharina van der Voort (1622–1674). The De la Court family were rich cloth merchants, and Pieter de la Court van der Voort was a prominent art collector. In his mansion in Leiden he devoted three separate rooms exclusively for the exhibition of his huge collection of paintings and other rooms contained more paintings. He is known to have commissioned Willem van Mieris to make paintings of all kindsgenre, portrait, landscape, history, and still life. In fact, he was so impressed by van Mieris&#x27; skill, that he did not only commission original works, but also copies of well-known and much appreciated paintings. According to Pieter&#x27;s handwritten inventory of 1731 and that of his son Allard de la Court (1688–1755) in 1749, Pieter commissioned Van Mieris to paint ten copies after the work of famous 17th-century painters, such as his father Frans I van Mieris, Gerard Dou, Ary de Vois (1632–1635 to 1680) and Philip Wouwerman (1619–1688). These works must have been accessible to him, although it is not known where the originals were located when Van Mieris copied them. Such copies functioned as high-valuable substitutes for much-loved 17th-century paintings that were unavailable to most collectors. Some of these copies were so good that both salesmen and owners would let them pass as the originals. However, the collectors eager to buy copies still held a clear distinction in value between original and copy. An average copy by Willem van Mieris commissioned by Pieter de la Court van der Voort was 60 guilders, while he was paid much more for work of his own design. In total, Pieter de la Court van der Voort commissioned at least 28 paintings, including copies, from Van Mieris. The large collection and close contact between the two men gave Van Mieris the opportunity to get inspired by the work of other artists, such as Van Bossuit&#x27;s sculptures, on which many of Van Mieris&#x27; drawings are based Besides paintings, Pieter de la Court van der Voort also commissioned four vases for the garden of his Leiden mansion (see below). The two were not only associated through business, but were also intimate friends and Pieter de la Court van der Voort was proud of that. He denied any offer on his friend&#x27;s work and protected the works themselves and their uniqueness carefully. After his death, he left his collection to his son Allard de la Court, who extended it with more, mostly commissioned, work.

No relationship between the two patrons has been established, except for an archival document from the eighteenth century, which testifies Van Wassenaer&#x27;s intention to buy Dou&#x27;s &quot;Grocer&#x27;s Shop&quot;. Allard de la Court, who inherited most of his father&#x27;s collection, describes Van Wassenaer&#x27;s efforts to acquire the painting at a hefty price. This shows how much Van Wassenaer appreciated Dou&#x27;s &quot;Grocer&#x27;s Shop&quot; and it is possible that Van Mieris made his own version modelled closely after Dou&#x27;s to please his patron.

Another collection worth mentioning is the one by Sir Matthew Decker (1669–1749). This Dutchman emigrated to London in 1702, where he made a fortune as a banker and director of the East India Company. He was a skilled buyer of art and bought paintings in the Netherlands to ship them across to England. By the end of his life, he amassed a good collection, including paintings by Dou and Willem van Mieris.
===Pupils===

Hieronymous van der Mij, born in 1687 in Leiden, was one of Willem van Mieris&#x27; pupils. Van der Mij painted mostly portraits, borrowing from van Mieris&#x27; style. His portraits were highly regarded because of how much they resembled the sitters, who were usually high status individuals including professors or regents of the armhouse.

Willem van Mieris also took care of training his son Frans in the art of painting: when the old artist was forced to retire from active work due to his progressive blindness, he passed on his studio to his son, and the two consistently worked together. However, Frans van Mieris the Younger was not nearly as successful as his father and grandfather: only very few of his works are known to us, and he never managed to gain popularity among collectors. Some of his paintings were even refused by the commissioner, as happened with the German prince of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, who decided not to accept Frans&#x27;s &quot;Diana bathing&quot; (executed in close collaboration with Willem) due to its poor quality. After these unsatisfactory results, Frans van Mieris the Younger soon quit painting to dedicate himself to antiquarian collections: he was a highly esteemed expert in numismatics, a field he wrote several renowned treatises on.

==Key works==
===Paintings===

In Willem van Mieris&#x27; painting of Bathsheba from 1708, Bathsheba is depicted in the nude sitting before King David. In October 1707, while van Mieris worked on Bathsheba, ten works by the sculptor van Bossuit were sold from the collection of van Mieris&#x27; patron Petronella Oortmans-de la Court, bringing attention to the sculptures of van Bossuit and influencing van Mieris&#x27;s work. When comparing van Mieris&#x27;s Bathsheba to two of his drawings that he produced after van Bossuit&#x27;s sculptures, namely Venus and Cupid and Diana and Callisto, the influence that van Bossuit&#x27;s sculptures played on Bathsheba becomes evident. In van Mieris&#x27;s drawing Venus and Cupid, Venus&#x27;s facial profile shows a strong resemblance to Bathsheba&#x27;s. In the painter&#x27;s drawing Diana and Callisto, the position of Diana&#x27;s body is also similar to that of Bathsheba&#x27;s. Consequently, it is believed that Bathsheba&#x27;s graceful pose and gesture, characteristic of van Mieris&#x27;s trademarked idealized female nude, is directly borrowed from van Bossuit&#x27;s sculptures. In Willem van Mieris&#x27;s Lute Player from 1711, the woman depicted in the painting strikingly resembles Bathsheba, which is representative of the painter&#x27;s repetition of figures.

In Willem van Mieris&#x27;s painting &quot;Granida and Daifilo&quot; from 1697, he depicts a scene from P.C. Hooft&#x27;s pastoral play &quot;Granida&quot;, a common choice of subject matter in Dutch 17th-century painting. In this painting, van Mieris &quot;combines the minuteness of his Leyden School with a more international late 17th-century classicism&quot;. Granida&#x27;s headgear, the shepherdess&#x27;s straw hat, as well as Daifilo&#x27;s tiger-skin are suggested to allude to the theatre. The painting was once part of the Winkler Collection at Leipzig in 1768, but was recorded for the last time when it was passed through a London sale in 1900.

Van Mieris&#x27;s painting &quot;Le Thé&quot; is mostly to be inspired Gerard de Lairesse&#x27;s idea to depict a tea party in his book &quot;Groot Schilderboek&quot; (1707), in which he translates the laws of international classicism into practical rules for artist&#x27;s to apply in their studios. &quot;Le Thé&quot; depicts a scene of a young woman offering a friend a cup of tea, while the friend refuses to accept the tea as she must leave. While van Mieris generally followed the rules for genre painting outlined by De Lairesse, he did not share De Lairesse&#x27;s belief that genre painting should be as similar to history painting as possible. An additional difference between De Lairesse and van Mieris is that van Mieris eliminates all traces of psychological tension and conflict between the figures, as well as all sense of narration and progression of time.

====&quot;De rarekiek&quot;====
Once part of the prized collection of Allard de la Court, &quot;De Rarekiek&quot; was commissioned by de la Court for 1000 guilders. It took a different, more modern approach to the concept of the quack or salesman who is exhibiting his wares, which was a common theme at the time, by replacing the salesman with a man showing off a raree-show. Van Mieris called the painting &quot;&quot; (&quot;the fine curiosity), using an expression that was common in the 18th century to refer to travelling minstrels. This painting was one of the few paintings where Van Mieris was trying to renew his repertoire of kitchen scenes and shop interiors.

====&quot;Joseph with the Wife of Potiphar&quot;====
This painting illustrates the story that Joost van den Vondel wrote about Iempsar, wife of Joseph&#x27;s patron Potiphar, attempting to seduce the pious Joseph. The scene depicts Joseph rejecting and leaving her. The figures are elegant, but not dramatic, and the classical composition seems to highlight Van Mieris&#x27; shortcoming to illustrate the dramatic nature of the story. However, the work was praised by contemporaries.

====&quot;The Death Mouse&quot;====
This painting was started by another painter, Pieter van Singelandt, but was finished by Willem van Mieris after his death. Typical for Van Mieris&#x27; work is that the woman is dressed in a rather fashionable manner, creating a striking contrast between the elegant lady in the classical interior and her feeding the cat, an act which befits a maid better. The painting bears an amorous meaning; the woman shows that a thief easily changes into a prey near her. If a man wants to steal a kiss, he will lose his heart.

====&quot;Keuken met Visboer&quot;====
This scene in the shop allows Van Mieris to display his skill at emulating reality in a large variety of subjects. Van Mieris details the different materials, creating a highly lifelike picture, but from a distance they seem to not work very well together. The female figure is rather stiff and doll-like, and the background echoes this in its mechanical nature, which leaves nothing to the imagination. This painting was well received by contemporaries, and it was viewed as natural and artistic.

===Sculptures===

It is not well known that Willem van Mieris worked with multiple media: not only painting. In fact he also worked as a designer and molder of sculptures. His career as a sculptor was, however, a short one: he only worked for a few years at the beginning of the 18th century. Nevertheless, he still did a good job that surpass his paintings in quality. The only work that has come down to us are four vases commissioned by his patron Pieter de la Court van der Voort, which were designed for the garden of his Leiden mansion. The De la Court family had an avid interest in gardening (they introduced the pineapple to Europe) and art, which explains the extensive attention for decoration of the garden. Eleven preparatory drawings for the four vases made by Willem van Mieris have been mentioned in an inventory of the collection of Pieter de la Court&#x27;s son Allard and two decades later in the auction catalogue of his widow Catherina de la Court-Backer. Willemijn Fock was able to identify six of these drawings and noticed that four vases decorating the gardens of Windsor Castle in England were signed &quot;W. van Mieris inv[enit] et fecit&quot; and Roman numerals state the year of production. After comparison of the drawings and the actual vases, there was no doubt that these were commissioned by Pieter de la Court and to later be acquired by the British royal family in 1825. The four vases portray the four seasons and the shape of the vases are classically inspired on the Medici-vase and the Borghese-vase, but also after the vases of the Versailles palace. The seasonal division is quite traditional, going back to classical literature. Willem van Mieris is likely to have read the translation of Cesare Ripa&#x27;s &quot;Iconologia&quot; and represented spring with sacrifice to Flora and Priapus, summer with the bath of Diana and a sacrifice to Ceres, autumn with a parade for Bacchus, and winter with Venus ordering weapons for Aeneas and warming herself to a fire after Ceres and Bacchus leave her. Willem van Mieris always carefully prepared his paintings in order to find the right composition and to study certain elements. Two of his spring drawings can be considered the most carefully done and may be the best work in his large oeuvre of drawings. For the vases, as a source of inspiration he used both his own work and the works of others, both Dutch and Italian, that was brought to him by De la Court especially for this project. He probably used works of Rembrandt and the Flemish Francis van Bossuit. The drawings and actual vases are not a perfect match: the composition differs at times especially by the omittance of figures or details (often because of lack of space or because of lack of space or because the overall picture or story looked better without).

Willem van Mieris was the designer and molder of the reliefs. He collaborated with his friend Filips van der Mij, who was responsible for the casting, and his son Hieronimus van der Mij would later study under van Mieris. The feet and lids of the vases were made by Giovanni Battista Lurago under the supervision of van Mieris.

Allard de la Court also commissioned van Mieris a fountain piece, again in collaboration with Filips van der Mij. The sculpture has been destroyed, but the receipts of the purchase give a detailed description of the work: Hercules strangling the head of a serpent while holding it up. The water sprayed out of the serpent&#x27;s mouth. However, the fountain has not come down to us, making the vases the only pieces of sculpture by Willem van Mieris that we can admire today.

== Criticism and appreciation==

Willem van Mieris succeeded in achieving remarkable popularity in the Netherlands, with his paintings hanging in the collections of many eminent members of the Dutch new aristocracy as well as of foreign noblemen such as the Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. However, his reputation was not held in as high esteem when it comes to later art critics: Dezallier d&#x27;Argenville, though recognizing the ability of Van Mieris as a painter, states in his Abrégé that he was never able to match the level of his father, Frans van Mieris the Elder, whose fame was still celebrated in Europe when Willem painted his major works. This opinion was reflected in the foreign market as well, as this anecdote describes; Pieter de la Court van der Voort (1664–1739) was travelling through France in 1700, intending to sell a work by Willem van Mieris. He covered up the artist&#x27;s signature to hide the fact that it was a work by Willem, not his father Frans van Mieris, as the value of the painting would be drastically lowered when it would be known that it was the son who painted it.

Much harsher is the opinion of Théophile Thoré, the major critic of Dutch art in the 19th century: in his &quot;Musées de la Hollande&quot;, a catalogue of the most important works of art exposed in the Netherlands, the French connoisseur blatantly despised Willem van Mieris, labeling his paintings as &quot;harsh, cold, piddling, and unsurpassably insipid&quot;. All things considered, no other kind of statement could be expected from Thoré on a painter such as Van Mieris: the Dutch painter embodied the new, classicizing tendency of Dutch art in the 18th century, a tendency that Thoré viewed as the death and destruction of the Golden Age. In fact, the French critic idealized Dutch 17th-century painting as the most complete expression of freedom and independence ever achieved by European art, with Rembrandt and Vermeer as icons of a popular, real and truthful way of painting. On the other hand, the Leiden &quot;fijnschilders&quot; and the Italianate painters were regarded as traitors of this exceptional artistic movement, being still imprisoned by the old and aristocratic canons of classicizing beauty.

<text>June Tabor (born 31 December 1947 in Warwick, England) is an English folk singer known for her solo work and her earlier collaborations with Maddy Prior and with Oysterband.

== Early life ==
June Tabor was born and grew up in Warwick, England. As a young woman of 18, she was inspired to sing by hearing Anne Briggs&#x27; EP &quot;The Hazards of Love&quot; in 1965.
&quot;I went and locked myself in the bathroom for a fortnight and drove my mother mad. I learned the songs on that EP note for note, twiddle for twiddle. That&#x27;s how I started singing. If I hadn&#x27;t heard her I&#x27;d have probably done something entirely different.&quot; 

Discussing in a 2008 interview how she developed her characteristic style, she said, &quot;I have no musical education whatsoever...I just learned the songs and copied the phrasing by playing those records ad nauseam, trying out both [Anne Briggs and Belle Stewart] singers&#x27; styles. Then I tried putting the two together, and missing a few bits out – and that&#x27;s approximately what I&#x27;ve been doing ever since. It&#x27;s also why I don&#x27;t do singing workshops, because that&#x27;s about as much as I can tell anyone.&quot;

Her earliest public performances were in the mid 1960s at the Heart of England Folk Club, in the Fox and Vivian pub in Leamington Spa.

She attended St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford University and appeared on &quot;University Challenge&quot; in 1968, as captain of the college team. She joined the Heritage Society at Oxford University and sang with a group called Mistral. 

After she performed at Sidmouth Folk Festival, she was booked in folk clubs and contributed to various recordings. One of her earliest was in 1972 on an anthology called &quot;Stagfolk Live&quot;. She is also featured on Rosie Hardman&#x27;s &quot;Firebird&quot; (1972) and &quot;The First Folk Review Record&quot; (1974). At the time she was singing purely traditional, unaccompanied material.

In 1976 Tabor collaborated with Maddy Prior on the &quot;Silly Sisters&quot; album and tour, with a full band that included Nic Jones. It provided the launching pad that same year (1976) for her first album in her own right, &quot;Airs and Graces&quot;. She later joined again with Prior, this time using the name Silly Sisters for their duo. 

Starting in 1977, Martin Simpson joined Tabor in the recording studio for three albums before he moved to the United States in 1987. (Since his return, Simpson has been a guest artist on albums released in the 2000s. After Simpson&#x27;s departure, Tabor started working closely with pianist Huw Warren.

After working for decades as a singer, Tabor stopped performing professionally for a time. She made some guest appearances with Fairport Convention during this period. She also worked as a librarian. With her husband David Taylor (they have since divorced), she ran a restaurant called &quot;Passepartout&quot; in Penrith, Cumbria. In the 1990s she returned to music professionally.

== Solo work ==
In 1983, Tabor had sung the title song for the BBC TV series &quot;Spyship&quot;. 

In 1990, Tabor recorded an album with the folk-rock band The Oyster Band titled &quot;Freedom and Rain&quot;. She went on tour with the Oyster Band, and the Rykodisc label published a limited-run promotional live album the following year. Many of her current fans first discovered her through this tour and album with the Oyster Band. In 1992, Elvis Costello wrote &quot;All This Useless Beauty&quot; specifically for Tabor, and she recorded it for the album &quot;Angel Tiger&quot;. Costello did not record it himself until 1996, on his album of the same name.

In 1997 she appeared in Ken Russell&#x27;s television film, &quot;In Search of English Folk Song&quot;, which was broadcast on Channel 4. 

Tim Winton, author of the novel &quot;Dirt Music&quot; (2001), which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize, made a selection of music to express the themes of the novel. The CD &quot;Dirt Music&quot; (2001) includes &quot;He Fades Away&quot; by Tabor, a tale of the slow death of a miner. (Tabor originally included this song on her 1994 CD &quot;Against the Streams.&quot;) 

In 2002 Tabor performed at the &quot;Passchendale Peace Concert&quot; in Flanders, appearing with Coope Boyes and Simpson. On 30 June 2006 BBC Radio 3 broadcast &quot;Night Waves&quot; to commemorate the anniversary of the Battle of the Somme. It was broadcast live, with Tabor singing World War I-era songs. There was also a discussion with Michael Morpurgo and Kate Adie.

Tabor has also performed jazz and art song, generally with a sparse and sombre tone to it. Her 2003 album &quot;An Echo of Hooves&quot; marked a return to the traditional ballad form after she concentrated on other styles for several years. It was highly acclaimed. AllMusic described it as, &quot;A stunning jewel in a remarkable career, and one of the best things Tabor&#x27;s ever released.&quot; She next released &quot;Always&quot; (2005), a boxed set of four CDs that span her career and contain rare recordings.

== Collaborations and recent developments ==
Her collaboration with Martin Simpson on their 1980 album &quot;A Cut Above&quot; was widely praised. The BBC&#x27;s Mike Harding said: &quot;When you get two wonderful musicians together the end result is not always the sum of the parts ... In this case they obviously pushed each other on to greater things because the end result is magnificent.&quot; 

On 24 October 2003 Tabor appeared on &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot; (BBC TV), singing &quot;Hughie Graeme&quot;. This was later issued as part of a compilation DVD from the series. 

&quot;Folk Britannia&quot; was the name of a concert at the Barbican centre, and a related TV mini-series (February 2006, repeated in October). She sang &quot;Fair Margaret and Sweet William&quot; at the Barbican, under the heading &quot;Daughters of Albion&quot;. Tabor contributed one song to Ashley Hutchings&#x27; project &quot;Street Cries&quot; (2001) and one to a collection of folk musicians singing songs by the Beatles – &quot;Rubber Folk&quot; (2006). She chose to sing Lennon&#x27;s &quot;In My Life&quot; a cappella. 

Tabor is often experimental but avoids modernism. For example, she frequently sings traditional songs with a piano accompaniment. On the album &quot;Singing The Storm&quot; (1996), she sings to the accompaniment of Savourna Stevenson&#x27;s harp, and Danny Thompson&#x27;s bass. In May 2004 she performed as part of &quot;The Big Session&quot; and sang an adaptation of &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot; as a duet with John Jones of Oysterband. In 1992, The Wire voted Tabor&#x27;s &quot;Queen Among the Heather&quot; as one of the &quot;Top 50 Rhythms of all Time&quot;.

Tabor has also performed comic work with Les Barker&#x27;s The Mrs Ackroyd Band. So far Tabor has performed on three of their albums, the 1990 &quot;Oranges and Lemmings&quot; (singing &quot;The Trains of Waterloo&quot;, a parody of the folk song &quot;The Plains of Waterloo&quot; in a duet with Martin Carthy), the 1994 &quot;Gnus and Roses&quot; (singing &quot;The January June&quot;, a send-up of her perceived sombre character), and the 2003 &quot;Yelp!&quot; (singing &quot;There&#x27;s a Hole in my Bodhran&quot;, to the tune of &quot;There&#x27;s a Hole in my Bucket&quot;). She sang two songs on &quot;Beat The Retreat&quot;, a tribute to Richard Thompson.

Topic Records issued a 70-year anniversary boxed set &quot;Three Score and Ten&quot;; in the accompanying book it lists Tabor&#x27;s &quot;Aqaba&quot; as one of their classic albums. Three tracks from it are included in the compilation. &quot;A Place Called England&quot;&#x27; from &quot;A Quiet Eye&quot; is track eight on the second CD, and two songs appear on the seventh CD: &quot;While Gamekeepers Lie Sleeping&quot; from &quot;Airs &amp; Graces&quot; is track two, and &quot;Hedger and Ditcher&quot; from the Silly Sisters album &quot;No More To The Dance&quot; is track seventeen.

<text>Maria-Hélène Schneider (27 March 1952 – 3 February 2011), known professionally as Maria Schneider, was a French actress. 

She is best known for co-starring opposite Marlon Brando in the controversial &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; (1972), which was noted for its graphic sexuality. Schneider later revealed she was not informed about a simulated rape until moments before it was filmed, an event she described as traumatic and humiliating. Although Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s &quot;The Passenger&quot; (1975) showcased her abilities, a reputation for walking out of films during production resulted in her becoming unwelcome in the industry. However, she re-established stability in her personal and professional life in the early 1980s, and became an advocate for equality and improving the conditions actresses worked under. She continued acting in film and TV until a few years before she died in 2011 after a long illness.

== Early life and family ==
Schneider was born in Paris to Daniel Gélin, a French actor, and Marie-Christine Schneider from Romania, a model who ran a bookshop in Paris. Gélin was married to actress and producer Danièle Delorme during the affair and his lack of fatherly involvement was deeply felt by his daughter. Gélin never recognised Schneider as his daughter, though he publicly acknowledged his paternity in the 1970s. Schneider was first brought up by her mother in a town near the French border with Germany. Eventually, her mother was unwilling to attend to her and entrusted her to a nurse for two years. Maria Schneider later lived for several years with her maternal uncle Michel Schneider and his wife. She reconnected with her biological father when she was sixteen, by visiting him unannounced.

Schneider later said that she had met Gélin only &quot;three times&quot;. Her cousin Vanessa Schneider wrote, in a biographical book published in 2018, that Maria Schneider had actually been in regular contact with her father during her late teens. It was he who first brought her to a film set. Over the years, Maria Schneider and her biological father met irregularly. She eventually bonded with her half-siblings (who had been unaware of her until after she starred in &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;), especially her half-sister Fiona Gélin. Her half-brothers Xavier Gélin and Manuel Gélin were also actors.

==Acting career==
=== Early years ===
As a teenager, Schneider loved films, going to the cinema up to four times a week. She left home at age 15 after an argument with her mother and went to Paris, where she made her stage-acting debut that same year. She eked out a living as a film extra and a model. While working on a film set, she met Brigitte Bardot, who having worked with her father on several productions, was &quot;horrified&quot; that the young actress was homeless and offered her a room in her house. Through Bardot, Schneider met people in the film business, including Warren Beatty, who was greatly impressed by Schneider, and introduced her to the William Morris Agency. She was 18 when she had her first break in 1970, appearing in &quot;Madly&quot;, starring Alain Delon. This was followed by relatively substantial roles in films such as Roger Vadim&#x27;s &quot;Hellé&quot; (1972); &quot;The Old Maid&quot; (&quot;La Vieille Fille&quot;) (1972) with Philippe Noiret; &quot;Dear Parents&quot; (&quot;Cari genitori&quot;) (1973) opposite Florinda Bolkan and Catherine Spaak; and &quot;Dance of Love&quot; (1973), based on a play by Arthur Schnitzler. (The latter film is also known as &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot;, which is distinct from Schneider&#x27;s 1981 film of the same name directed by Jacques Rivette.)

=== &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; and related controversies ===
Schneider gained international renown for her performance at the age of 19 in the sexually explicit &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; (1972), directed by Bernardo Bertolucci. In a graphic portrayal of anonymous sex with an older man, she performed several nude scenes, including a rape scene that Bertolucci did not reveal to her until just before the filming of it. In 2007, she said:
 In 2013, Bertolucci said he had withheld the information from her to generate a real &quot;reaction of frustration and rage&quot;. Brando alleged that Bertolucci had wanted the characters to have real sex, but Brando and Schneider both said it was simulated. Actress Jessica Tovey, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, argued that Bertolucci&#x27;s defense of pursuing an artistic vision was &quot;bogus&quot; and that what occurred was &quot;a violation.&quot; Tovey also observed that it is difficult to imagine the &quot;roles being reversed; Brando being brutalized only to discover midway through filming that Schneider and Bertolucci had conspired to add an element of humiliation.&quot;

In 2001, Schneider commented:
In the 1970s, criminal proceedings were brought against Bertolucci in Italy for obscenity; the film was sequestered by the censorship commission and all copies were ordered destroyed. An Italian court revoked Bertolucci&#x27;s civil rights for five years and gave him a four-month suspended prison sentence. In 1978 the Appeals Court of Bologna ordered three copies of the film to be preserved in the national film library with the stipulation that they could not be viewed, until Bertolucci was later able to re-submit it for general distribution with no cuts.

Schneider said that due to her experience with the film – and her treatment afterward as a sex symbol rather than as a serious actress – she decided never to work nude again. She started struggling with depression, became a drug addict and made several suicide attempts.

She later became a women&#x27;s rights advocate, in particular fighting for more female film directors, more respect for female actors, and better representation of women in film and media. 

=== 1970s, post-&quot;Last Tango&quot; ===

In 1975, Schneider was cast opposite Jack Nicholson in the well-received Michelangelo Antonioni film &quot;The Passenger&quot;, which remains one of the highlights of her career, and was the personal favorite of the actress. That same year, Schneider also starred in René Clément&#x27;s final movie, the Hitchcockian thriller &quot;&quot;, in which, according to Schneider, the director actually wanted the actress for the villainous role; yet, when Antonioni screened &quot;The Passenger&quot; for him, Clément decided that Schneider would be ideal for the heroine. The picture, produced by Carlo Ponti (as with &quot;The Passenger&quot; and &quot;Dear Parents&quot;) and also featuring Robert Vaughn, Vic Morrow, and Sydne Rome, went largely unnoticed by the public and critics alike.

During the 1970s, Schneider traveled (including to the Hopi Reservation and Navajo Nation) and lived in various parts of Europe, including Venice, Paris, and London. After &quot;The Passenger&quot; and &quot;Wanted: Babysitter&quot;, Schneider settled in Los Angeles for a year, looking around for film opportunities and being offered roles in Hollywood movies such as &quot;Black Sunday&quot; (1977) as a Palestinian guerilla terrorist, which she turned down based on what she perceived to be poor quality material. She signed up with renowned talent agent and producer Paul Kohner, and several movies were considered, but ultimately little came of this. Work became difficult for her to find, as she had become uninsurable.

Moving back to Europe, Schneider was asked by director Tinto Brass to play Drusilla, the incestuous sister of a notorious Roman emperor, opposite &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; star Malcolm McDowell, in the infamous, pornographic, multi-million dollar &quot;Penthouse&quot; production of &quot;Caligula&quot;; Schneider refused to perform nude or do graphic sex scenes, and was replaced mid-production with Teresa Ann Savoy, who had appeared in the director&#x27;s previous film &quot;Salon Kitty&quot;.
Around the same time, Schneider agreed to star in Luis Buñuel&#x27;s &quot;That Obscure Object of Desire&quot; (1977), and showed up on set, yet argued with the filmmaker over how her role would be portrayed in light of Schneider&#x27;s growing concern regarding the depiction of women in cinema , and because of excessive nudity. Schneider ultimately dropped out, and Buñuel made the creative, unusual decision to replace her with not one but two actresses for the same role: Carole Bouquet and Ángela Molina. Schneider was also asked by Bertolucci to appear in his 1976 film &quot;1900&quot;, but either turned him down or was fired. She was asked to play Mary, mother of Jesus in Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s 1979 television miniseries &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;; Schneider said she did not feel right for the part, though later regretted missing out on this opportunity, and instead eventually appeared in Zeffirelli&#x27;s 1996 film &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; in a brief appearance as Bertha Mason.

For the rest of the 1970s, Schneider opted to star in small-budgeted, independent European productions, such as the little-seen Swiss period piece &quot;Violanta&quot; (1976, with a young Gérard Depardieu), and three consciously feministic works: the Italian production &quot;I Belong to Me&quot; (&quot;Io Sono Mia&quot;) (1978, with Stefania Sandrelli); the graphic, disturbing &quot;Memoirs of a French Whore&quot; (French title: &quot;La Dérobade&quot;) (1978, alongside Miou-Miou, and for which Schneider was nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the 1980 5th César Awards); and the lesbian Dutch drama &quot;A Woman Like Eve&quot;, directed by Nouchka van Brakel, where Schneider plays the bohemian love interest of conflicted Monique van de Ven who is married to and has children with Peter Faber.

Towards the end of the decade, famed arthouse director Jacques Rivette met Schneider at a cafe on the Champs-Elysées and asked her what kind of movie she&#x27;d like to make with him, to which Schneider replied &quot;a thriller&quot;; Rivette then asked which actor she&#x27;d like to star opposite, and she suggested her friend Joe Dallesandro, renowned for his association with Andy Warhol and leading performances in Paul Morrissey&#x27;s films. The result was the vague, symbolic crime drama &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot;, a troubled production that Schneider and Rivette, both overcome by ill health and personal issues, eventually completed, and was finally released in 1981 to mediocre reviews.

=== The 1980s ===
The 1980s were a much quieter period for Schneider, both personally and professionally. Following increasing issues with her drug use (including cocaine, LSD, and heroin) and a suicide attempt in the &#x27;70s (in the looming shadow of &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;, which friend and one-time girlfriend of Marlon Brando, Esther Anderson, said &quot;ruined [Maria&#x27;s] life&quot;), Schneider once and for all overcame these problems by the early &#x27;80s - which she accredited to her &quot;angel&quot;, which may have been life-partner Maria Pia &quot;Almadio&quot; (or, according to some sources, &quot;Crapanzano&quot;). The beginning of the decade saw the actress appearing in a campy Belgian vampire comedy with Louise Fletcher, &quot;Mama Dracula&quot; (1980), which received universally negative reviews from critics. The same year, she performed alongside Klaus Kinski in the French thriller &quot;Hate&quot; (&quot;Haine&quot;).

Schneider starred in &quot;Peacetime in Paris&quot; in 1981, a Yugoslavian picture set in the French capital, which follows a documentarian researching the history of Nazism in Paris; there he meets and falls in love with Schneider&#x27;s mysterious character, who helps him out on his quest. The picture won a Special Prize at the 12th Moscow International Film Festival, and also featured Schneider&#x27;s father, Daniel Gélin, in a supporting role as a taxi driver&gt; None of his scenes, however, are shared with Maria.

In 1982, she offered performances in two comedies, the Italian &quot;Looking for Jesus&quot; (&quot;Cercasi Gesù&quot;), with Fernando Rey, and the French &quot;Stray Bullets&quot; (&quot;Balles perdues&quot;). Starting from 1984, Schneider began appearing more regularly in European television movies and shows, such as 1985&#x27;s &quot;A Song for Europe&quot; (or &quot;A Crime of Honour&quot;) with a young David Suchet of &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; fame, while doing supporting roles in cinematic turns like the Japanese production of &quot;The Princess &amp; the Photographer&quot; (1984).

Towards the end of the 1980s, Schneider had substantial roles in the French thriller &quot;Résidence surveillée&quot; (1987) and the post-apocalyptic surrealistic comedy &quot;Bunker Palace Hôtel&quot; (1989) with three other legends of French cinema: Jean-Louis Trintignant, Carole Bouquet, and Jean-Pierre Léaud (the latter of which was Schneider&#x27;s obsessive filmmaker fiancé in &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;.)

== Personal life ==
In 1973, Schneider came out as bisexual. She told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in February 1973:

In early 1976, she abandoned the film set of &quot;Caligula&quot; (reportedly due to its pornographic content, saying &quot;I am an actress, not a prostitute!&quot;) and checked herself into a mental hospital in Rome for several days to be with her lover, photographer Joan Townsend. This, coupled with her refusal to perform nude, led to Schneider&#x27;s dismissal from the film. The 1970s were turbulent years for Schneider, marked by excessive drug use and a suicide attempt. Schneider said that she disliked the instant fame accorded to her from &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;. She suffered abuse and began taking drugs.
== Death ==
Schneider died of cancer on 3 February 2011 at age 58. Her funeral was held on 10 February 2011 at the Church of Saint-Roch, Paris, attended by actors, directors, and producers in French cinema such as Dominique Besnehard, Bertrand Blier, Christine Boisson, Claudia Cardinale, Alain Delon, and Andréa Ferreol, her partner Maria Pia Almadio, half-siblings Fiona and Manuel Gélin, and her uncle Georges Schneider. Delon read a tribute from Brigitte Bardot. Schneider was cremated afterwards at Père Lachaise crematorium, and her ashes were to be scattered at sea at the foot of the Rock of the Virgin in Biarritz, according to her last wishes.

== Legacy and honours ==
In 2001, Schneider was the guest of honor at the 23rd Festival Créteil Films de Femmes. In a master class at the festival, she called film &quot;a tracing of memory&quot;, and said that women must be recognized as actors and directors. She also brought attention to the importance of assisting senior French actors who become unemployed and impoverished. Schneider was chosen the same year as vice-president of , an organization in Paris that supports senior French actors and directors. According to Schneider, Marcel Carné, director of &quot;Children of Paradise&quot; (1945) and one of the most important directors of the late 1930s, would have died in poverty but for La Roue Tourne supporting him for the last 10 years of his life.

On 1 July 2010, Schneider was awarded the medal of Chevalier, Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, for her contributions to the arts by Minister of Culture and Communication, Frédéric Mitterrand. He had acted with her in Jacques Rivette&#x27;s film, &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot; (1981).

After Schneider&#x27;s death, Patti Smith released a song on her 2012 album &quot;Banga&quot; called &quot;Maria&quot;, which was dedicated both to the actress and nostalgic memories of the 1970s.

In 2018, her cousin Vanessa Schneider published &quot;Tu t&#x27;appelais Maria Schneider&quot;, a book about her.

In 2024, her life story was adapted into the French film &quot;Being Maria&quot;, in which Schneider is portrayed by Anamaria Vartolomei.

<text>Frans van Mieris the Younger (24 November 1689 – 22 October 1763) was a Dutch painter. He was born in Leiden, the son of Willem van Mieris, and continued in the artistic traditions of his grandfather, also named Frans and known as Frans van Mieris the Elder. Willem passed down his painting studio to his son Frans. However, neither Willem nor Frans the Younger achieved the same level of artistic renown as Frans the Elder. Frans Mieris the Younger died in Leiden.

<text>The first USS &quot;Evans&quot; (DD–78) was a in the United States Navy during World War I, later transferred to the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Mansfield&quot;.

== Construction and career ==
=== United States Navy ===

Named for Robley Dunglison Evans, she was launched on 30 October 1918 by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine; sponsored by Mrs. D. N. Sewell, granddaughter of Rear Admiral Evans. The ship was commissioned on 11 November 1918.

After a training and outfitting period which included a maiden voyage to the Azores, &quot;Evans&quot; departed Newport, Rhode Island on 10 June 1919 for European waters, where she operated until 22 August, returning then to New York. She sailed once more on 11 September, and after patrolling off Central America, reached her assigned home port, San Diego, on 14 November.

Through the next two years, &quot;Evans&quot; joined in a training schedule which found her ranging the eastern Pacific from Valparaíso, Chile, to Astoria, Oregon. She was placed in reserve at San Diego 6 October 1921, and decommissioned on 29 May 1922. Recommissioned on 1 April 1930, she operated out of San Diego for six months, then was assigned to duty training members of the naval reserve out of New York City, where she arrived 6 December 1930. She returned to San Diego 26 March 1932, to sail with the Battle Fleet on training cruises and in exercises along the west coast and in Hawaiian and Alaskan waters.

Once more out of commission from 31 March 1937 to 30 September 1939, &quot;Evans&quot; arrived at Key West on 11 December 1939 for neutrality patrol duty in the Antilles, and exercises in various parts of the Caribbean. On 24 September 1940, she sailed from Key West for Halifax, Nova Scotia, where she was decommissioned 23 October 1940, and transferred to the Royal Navy in the land bases for destroyers exchange.

=== Royal Navy and Royal Norwegian Navy service ===

Commissioned as HMS &quot;Mansfield, a , the destroyer had a truly international career, for between December 1940 and March 1942; she was on loan to the exiled Royal Norwegian Navy. As HNoMS &quot;Mansfield, she raided a fish oil factory in German hands at Øksfjord near Hammerfest, Norway. Her landing party destroyed the factory&#x27;s essential machinery, and attempted to capture the local quisling leader, but he escaped. With her Norwegian crew, she also served on escort duty in the North Atlantic, continuing in this vital assignment after she returned to the Royal Navy. &quot;Mansfield&quot; was modified for trade convoy escort service by removal of three of the original 4-inch/50-caliber guns and one of the triple torpedo tube mounts to reduce topside weight for additional depth charge stowage and installation of hedgehog. In March 1942 she was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy operationally, but never commissioned, and served with the Western Local Escort Force based at Halifax and St. John&#x27;s. With newer escorts available, in November 1943 the veteran of service in four navies was reduced to care and maintenance service at Halifax, and on 22 June 1944 she was paid off (decommissioned).

Her bell, still lettered USS &quot;Evans&quot;, is preserved at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

<doc id="871153" wikidata="Q11888286" url="?curid=871153" title="Swiss Toni">
<text>Swiss Toni is a British television comedy character played by Charlie Higson. He is a 50-something car dealer, usually depicted wearing a grey suit and with his hair styled in a platinum blond bouffant quiff; his accent is reported to be based on Higson&#x27;s own poor impersonation of Sean Connery.

The character was created by Charlie Higson and Bob Mortimer, and first appeared in 1995 in a sketch in the second series of &quot;The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer&quot;, attempting to sell a car to the Bra Men. He became best known as a recurring character in another BBC comedy series, &quot;The Fast Show&quot;, debuting in the show&#x27;s third series in 1997. He featured in sketches alongside Rhys Thomas as Paul, a junior employee, in which Swiss would typically compare some activity to &quot;making love to a beautiful woman&quot;, with the use of comically exaggerated sexual innuendo.

Swiss later reappeared in a sitcom, also titled &quot;Swiss Toni&quot;, which developed both the character and his situation beyond the confines of the &quot;Fast Show&quot; sketches. The two series, produced by Tiger Aspect, ran on BBC Three in 2003 and 2004, the first three episodes of the first series also being repeated on BBC One. As well as playing the title character, Higson was the show&#x27;s main writer and one of its producers. Swiss is again portrayed as the owner of a car dealership, now going through a midlife crisis, including the apparent break-up of his marriage.

Besides Higson as Swiss, other regular cast members included:
*Rhys Thomas as Paul (as in the original &quot;Fast Show&quot; sketches), a junior salesman at the dealership
*Simon Day (another &quot;Fast Show&quot; regular) as Geoff Fowler, a salesman who is more successful than Swiss, despite problems with alcoholism (many of whose lines Day improvised)
*Matilda Ziegler as Swiss&#x27;s wife, Ruth, who breaks up with Swiss and begins a clandestine affair with Geoff
*Emma Rydal as Miranda, the dealership&#x27;s young receptionist
*Elizabeth Spriggs as Swiss&#x27;s overbearing and unsympathetic mother

<text>Benoit Lecomte (born 1967) is a French-American long-distance swimmer who swam several sections of the Atlantic Ocean in 1998. Many major media outlets initially wrongly reported that he swam the entire distance across the ocean, but the claim was dismissed and is not officially recognized by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; since there is uncertainty about the distance that Lecomte actually covered swimming due to the fact he rested and slept on a boat as it drifted and made progress towards their final destination.

== Atlantic Ocean swim ==

From 16 March to 25 September 1998, Lecomte undertook a swim in stages from Hyannis, Massachusetts to Quiberon, Brittany, France, including a one-week stop in the Azores, a Portuguese archipelago.

During his 73-day, journey, Lecomte was accompanied by a sailboat that had an electromagnetic field for to ward off sharks. He was accompanied by a crew of three aboard the sailboat, where he could rest and eat between each swimming period. Lecomte typically spent eight hours swimming each day in sessions of two to four hours.

The stated purpose of the swim was to raise money for cancer research as a tribute to his father.

=== Controversy ===

Since there is no standard definition of &quot;swimming across the Atlantic&quot;, there is uncertainty about the distance that Lecomte actually covered swimming in the water rather than riding in a boat with the prevailing currents. According to the &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot;, Lecomte would have had to average to have swum the entire distance, 3 to 4 times as fast as other long-distance swimmers.

=== Other Atlantic Ocean swim claims ===

* Guy Delage – swim from Cape Verde Islands to Barbados in 1994
* Jennifer Figge – swim from Cape Verde Islands to Trinidad in 2009

== The Pacific Swim ==
Benoit Lecomte began his swim of the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday June 5th 2018. He began in Chōshi Japan in the Kantō region, and hoped to make it to California. The distance to be covered was approximately and hoped to end up in San Francisco, California. He expected the trip to take about six months. Part of the reason for the swim was to raise awareness about sustainability and the impact of excessive human garbage polluting the world&#x27;s oceans. Lecomte said:

&quot;Before anything else I am a father and as a father the future of my children concerns me because, as we all know, our way of life is not sustainable. I don&#x27;t want to be passive and pass on to my children the liability we are tagging on to our environment. We can all make a difference once we realize how we can be better stewards of the environment and our own ecological footprint, make appropriate daily changes and inspire others to do the same. This is the first goal of this event and is intended to get people&#x27;s attention throughout the world and to understand that the solution is in our hands and that we can take action.&quot;

&quot;The second goal is to encourage and work with the education system in all countries to include classes on sustainability and what our ecological footprints are into their own curriculum, because, as we all know, sustainability starts with education.&quot;

Lecomte was accompanied by a crew and performed a &quot;staged swim&quot; (resuming the swim in the exact location in which he left the water) using a GPS tracking device, enabling him to accurately track the number of miles he completed thus enabling him to reach a new world record in open water swimming. Lecomte planned to average about a day, swimming eight hours with the help of the current.

After about 1,700 miles of swimming, the main sail of Lecomte&#x27;s assistance boat had been repeatedly torn by heavy winds. The team repaired the tears over and over, breaking nine pencil-sized needles during the trip, but Lecomte ultimately decided to cancel the swim to keep his crew safe.

<text>Shanbally Castle was located near Clogheen, County Tipperary and built for Cornelius O&#x27;Callaghan, the first Viscount Lismore, in around 1810. It was the largest house built in Ireland by the noted English architect John Nash. The castle was acquired by the Irish Land Commission in 1954. On 21 March 1960 the castle, after much controversy, was demolished.

==Destruction==
The protests against the demolition of Shanbally Castle came from some local sources, An Taisce, a few academics such as Professor Gwynn and some political voices such as Senator Sean Moylan, the Minister for Agriculture until his death in November 1957, and TD from Mitchelstown, John W Moher. Politically, the Fianna Fáil Government had no love for houses of the ascendancy and local TD Michael Davern was in favour of its demolition.

For a brief period it seemed that a purchaser could be found in the form of the London theatre critic Edward Charles Sackville-West, 5th Baron Sackville, who had a tremendous love of the Clogheen area, which he had known since childhood. He agreed to buy the castle, together with , but pulled out of the transaction when the Irish Land Commission refused to stop cutting trees in the land he intended to buy.

When this sale did not happen, the Irish Government claimed that it could not find another suitable owner for the castle.

In March 1960, &quot;The Nationalist&quot; reported the final end of a building which was once the pride of the neighbourhood. &quot;A big bang yesterday ended Shanbally Castle, where large quantities of gelignite and cortex shattered the building,&quot; it said. The explosion could be heard up to away.

A statement from the Irish Government released after the demolition of the Castle said in response to protests favouring the retention of Shanbally Castle for the nation: &quot;Apart from periods of military occupation the castle remained wholly unoccupied for 40 years&quot;.

<doc id="871161" wikidata="Q5414361" url="?curid=871161" title="Euston Films">
<text>Euston Films is a British film and television production company. It was originally a subsidiary of Thames Television, and operated from 1971 to 1994, producing various series for Thames, which were screened nationally on the ITV network. Euston Films productions include &quot;Van der Valk&quot; (1977), &quot;The Sweeney&quot; (1975–1978), &quot;Minder&quot; (1979–1994), &quot;Quatermass&quot; (1979), &quot;Danger UXB&quot; (1979), and &quot;Reilly, Ace of Spies&quot; (1983). &quot;The Sweeney&quot; had two feature film spin-offs, &quot;Sweeney!&quot; and &quot;Sweeney 2&quot;, which were also produced by Euston.

In 2014, Euston Films was revived as a production company by the owner of Thames, Fremantle.

==History==
The idea for Euston Films dated back to 1965, when writer Trevor Preston and directors Jim Goddard and Terry Green were working at ABC Television. They produced a detailed proposal for a specialist production unit that shot dramas on 16mm film, rather than standard videotape.

The company was founded in 1971 when three Thames executives, Lloyd Shirley, George Taylor and Brian Tesler realised there was a market for a new type of television drama. To facilitate this new-style of on-location action, Euston used two crews filming different scenes of the same programme at the same time, which ensured production times were quicker. Euston eschewed the studio videotape shooting more commonly used in British television drama at the time, and material was filmed on location using the more expensive but higher-quality 16mm film stock.

Initial shows such as &quot;Special Branch&quot; gained reasonable praise, but it was &quot;The Sweeney&quot; that first gave the company critical and commercial success. Using a storyline style known as &quot;kick, bollock and scramble&quot;, this formula continued in such shows as &quot;Fox&quot; and &quot;Widows&quot;. In 1979, the company created &quot;Minder&quot; as a vehicle for &quot;Sweeney&quot; star Dennis Waterman, giving the company its longest-running show. In September 1986, Euston Films announced it would increase its production of theatrical films in a joint venture with Film Four International.

With the demise of parent company Thames as an ITV broadcast franchise holder in 1992, Euston&#x27;s output reduced. It continued to make &quot;Minder&quot; for ITV franchisee Central Independent Television, but when this series was axed in 1994, further work was not forthcoming.

Euston Films was based at Colet Court in Hammersmith, London.

In September 2024, it was announced that all staff at Euston Films were laid off, with the Euston brand and IPs remaining at Fremantle.

== List of productions ==
==Revival==
In March 2014, it was announced that FremantleMedia (who had relaunched the Thames brand two years earlier) was to revive Euston Films as a production company. Former BBC drama executive Kate Harwood was recruited to take charge of the company. In December 2015, Euston announced it had secured a commission of a new drama series titled &quot;Hard Sun&quot;, written by Neil Cross, the creator of &quot;Luther&quot;. Filming took place in and around London, and the series was transmitted in early 2018. In July 2017, Channel 4 announced a new crime thriller called &quot;Baghdad Central&quot; would be produced by &quot;Euston Films.&quot;

===Euston North/Castlefield===
Euston Films launched a second production company called Euston North in January 2017. While the company carries on with their work in London and the South of England, the MediaCityUK-based Euston North focuses on productions in Manchester and the North of England. On 7 June 2019, Euston North was renamed Castlefield.

<doc id="871163" wikidata="Q13644308" url="?curid=871163" title="List of WWE Hardcore Champions">
<text>The WWE Hardcore Championship was a professional wrestling championship contested for in the United States–based World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) promotion, formerly known as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) before May 2002. The title was only contestable in matches under hardcore regulations, and could be won only by individual wrestlers. As a professional wrestling championship, it was introduced by the WWF on its television program &quot;Raw Is War&quot; on November 2, 1998, in which WWF chairman Mr. McMahon awarded Mankind the title. In 2000, the WWF instated the &quot;24/7 rule&quot;, a regulation stating that the title could be defended anywhere at any time as long as a referee was present, which led to numerous title changes in shorter time periods; the rule was discontinued in 2002. On the August 26, 2002 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Intercontinental Champion Rob Van Dam defeated Hardcore Champion Tommy Dreamer to unify both titles; the Hardcore Championship was retired shortly thereafter. The title was reactivated on two occasions afterwards, although they are not considered official reigns by WWE according to their official title history. On the June 23, 2003 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Mick Foley (who was the first champion as &quot;Mankind&quot;) was awarded the Hardcore Championship belt by the &quot;Raw&quot; brand authority figure Stone Cold Steve Austin for his contributions in hardcore wrestling. Edge and Foley then introduced themselves as co-holders of the championship in 2006, due to a storyline with alumni of the hardcore wrestling-based Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) promotion.

Over the course of the title&#x27;s 3 year, 9 month, and 25 day history, there were 230 title reigns shared among 52 wrestlers. Raven has the most reigns as champion, with 26. Big Boss Man&#x27;s fourth reign was the longest in the title&#x27;s history, at 97 days. Steve Blackman ranks first in combined reigns by length, at 172 days in six reigns. Blackman also held the record for the longest title reign under the &quot;24/7 Rule&quot; at 89 days, which was the 2nd longest. Due to the &quot;24/7 rule&quot; numerous wrestlers held the title less than one day, and because the exact times at which each wrestler held the title is unknown, it is impossible to determine who had the shortest reign. Each reign was won at WWF/E-promoted events: pay-per-view events, house shows, and on televised events.

<doc id="871165" wikidata="Q7307368" url="?curid=871165" title="Reflow oven">
<text>A reflow oven is a machine used primarily for reflow soldering of surface mount electronic components to printed circuit boards (PCBs). 

In commercial high-volume use, reflow ovens take the form of a long tunnel containing a conveyor belt along which PCBs travel. For prototyping or hobbyist use PCBs can be placed in a small oven with a door.
Commercial conveyorised reflow ovens contain multiple individually heated zones, which can be individually controlled for temperature. PCBs being processed travel through the oven and through each zone at a controlled rate. Technicians adjust the conveyor speed and zone temperatures to achieve a known time and temperature profile. The profile in use may vary depending on the requirements of the PCBs being processed at the time.

==Types of reflow ovens==

=== Infrared and convection ovens ===

In infrared reflow ovens, the heat source is normally ceramic infrared heaters above and below the conveyor, which transfer heat to the PCBs by means of radiation. 

Convection ovens heat air in chambers, using that air to transfer heat to the PCBs by means of convection and conduction. They may be fan assisted to control the airflow within the oven. This indirect heating using air allows more accurate temperature control than directly heating PCBs by infrared radiation, as PCBs and components vary in infrared absorptance.

Ovens may use a combination of infrared radiative heating and convection heating, and would then be known as &#x27;infrared convection&#x27; ovens.

Some ovens are designed to reflow PCBs in an oxygen-free atmosphere. Nitrogen (N2) is a common gas used for this purpose. This minimizes oxidation of the surfaces to be soldered. The nitrogen reflow oven takes a few minutes to reduce Oxygen concentration to acceptable levels within the chamber. Thus nitrogen ovens typically have nitrogen injection in at all times which decreases defect rates.

=== Vapour phase oven ===

The heating of the PCBs is sourced by thermal energy emitted by the phase transition of a heat transfer liquid (e. g. PFPE) condensing on the PCBs. The liquid used is chosen with a desired boiling point in mind to suit the solder alloy to be reflowed.

Some advantages of vapour phase soldering are:
* High energy efficiency due to the high heat transfer coefficient of vapour phase media
* Soldering is oxygen-free. There is no need for any protective gas (e.g. nitrogen)
* No overheating of assemblies. The maximum temperature assemblies can reach is limited by the boiling point of the medium.

This is also known as condensation soldering.

=== Pressure Curing Ovens ===
Pressure curing ovens, or Autoclave, is widely utilized to minimize voiding and improve adhesion strength in bonding processes.  Pressure cure ovens are typically employed in die attach and underfill applications.  Increasing pressure during the curing process removes voids.

In a pressure cure process, air is pressurized in a rigid vessel or chamber while heating or cooling with forced convection.  Heaters, heat exchangers, and blowers are mounted internal to the pressure vessel, continuously circulating air across the pressure chamber providing consistent heat transfer to the product.  Upon completion of the curing process, pressure is relieved and the product cools.

Pressure cure ovens can utilize air or nitrogen as the pressurizing agent. 

=== Vacuum Reflow Ovens ===
Traditional reflow can be augmented by the addition of a late-stage vacuum chamber.  Introducing a vacuum chamber to the reflow process allows voids and bubbles to escape, significantly reducing voiding in solder joints and interfaces.

During the vacuum process, the circuit board is stationary, assuring no shifting parts.  Smooth travel into and out of the vacuum chamber, minimizing vibration, is critical.

Employing heat inside the vacuum chamber allows peak temperatures to be achieved during vacuum, assuring shorter time above liquidous and greater process flexibility.  High vacuum chamber temperatures also prevent flux buildup inside the chamber.

Advanced vacuum reflow ovens employ multiple conveyor systems allowing higher throughput by optimizing transfer time into the vacuum chamber, dual rail processing, and closed-loop vacuum pumps to prevent solder and flux spatter.

=== Formic Acid Reflow Ovens ===
Formic acid reflow ovens operate similarly to a traditionally reflow oven, with the addition of formic acid vapor injection into the key soak zones for flux-free reflow and vapor soldering.  Upon injection, the formic acid removes any oxides present on the metal prior to reflow.

Formic acid concentration is maintained by a bubbler system that is monitored in real time to provide stable and consistent formic concentrations to within 0.5% in the process chamber.

Formic acid reflow ovens employ sets of double doors at the oven’s entrance and exit to dramatically reduce process gas consumption.  During production, only one door opens at a time, thus isolating the process chamber and lowering nitrogen and formic acid consumption.

==Thermal profiling==
Thermal profiling is the act of measuring several points on a circuit board to determine the thermal excursion it takes through the soldering process.
In the electronics manufacturing industry, SPC (statistical process control) helps determine if the process is in control, measured against the reflow parameters defined by the soldering technologies and component requirements.

<doc id="871169" wikidata="Q1265800" url="?curid=871169" title="Marty McSorley">
<text>Martin James McSorley (born May 18, 1963) is a Canadian former professional hockey player, who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1983 to 2000. A versatile player, he could play both the forward and defense positions. He was also head coach of the Springfield Falcons of the American Hockey League from 2002 to 2004. He was a valued teammate of Wayne Gretzky when they played together for the Edmonton Oilers and Los Angeles Kings, serving as an enforcer.

In 2000, his assault of Donald Brashear with his stick, in which Brashear suffered a severe concussion, led to McSorley&#x27;s suspension, criminal conviction, and later his retirement from hockey.

==Biography==

===Early life and hockey career===
McSorley was born in Hamilton, Ontario and grew up near Cayuga, Ontario. He made his NHL debut in October 1983 with the Pittsburgh Penguins but rose to fame after a trade in September 1985 sent him to the Edmonton Oilers. His arrival and physical presence soon made Edmonton&#x27;s incumbent enforcer Dave Semenko expendable, and McSorley became known as &quot;Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s bodyguard&quot;.

This title followed him to Los Angeles in 1988, when both he and Gretzky, along with Mike Krushelnyski, were obtained by the rival Los Angeles Kings. With the Kings, McSorley&#x27;s bruising style made him a fan favorite; but he strove to improve his game beyond his work as an enforcer, earning great respect around the league for his hard work ethic, his fine team play, and his articulate intelligence off the ice.

In the 1992–93 NHL regular season, McSorley led all defensemen in shorthanded goals with three.

The Kings reached the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals against the Montreal Canadiens, but in Game 2 with the Kings up 2–1, McSorley was caught with an illegal stick, which led to the Canadiens tying the game and winning it in overtime. Montreal eventually took the series in five games. McSorley had ten points in the playoffs and was the only King to score during the final game. Some suggested that he was the second most dominant King after Gretzky in the playoffs.

McSorley was traded in August 1993 to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for offensive forward Shawn McEachern. He had played only 47 games for Pittsburgh when the Kings re-acquired him on February 16, 1994. Back with the Kings, he assisted on Gretzky&#x27;s goal which broke Gordie Howe&#x27;s all-time goal-scoring record. On March 14, 1996, McSorley left the Kings&#x27; organization for good when he was traded to the New York Rangers in a multi-player deal.

After completing the 1995–96 season with the Rangers, McSorley returned to the West Coast upon being acquired by the San Jose Sharks in August 1996. He spent two injury-plagued seasons with the Sharks, then returned to Edmonton as a free agent in October 1998. Confined to a part-time role in his second stint in Edmonton, he left after one season and signed with the Boston Bruins in December 1999. 

====Assault conviction====
In a game between the Bruins and the Vancouver Canucks in Vancouver on February 21, 2000, McSorley swung his stick and hit Donald Brashear in the head with 4.6 seconds left in the game. Brashear fell backward and hit his head hard on the ice, losing consciousness and suffering a Grade III concussion. McSorley was charged with assault and suspended by the NHL for the remainder of the 1999–2000 season and the playoffs, missing 23 games. On October 6, 2000, Judge William Kitchen of the Provincial Court of British Columbia found him guilty of assault with a weapon for his attack on Brashear. He was sentenced to 18 months probation. The trial was the first for an on-ice attack by an NHL player since Dino Ciccarelli&#x27;s 1988 trial.

After his conviction, his NHL suspension was extended to one full year through February 21, 2001. It was the longest suspension for an on-ice incident in modern NHL history. McSorley&#x27;s contract expired during the suspension, and he would never play in another NHL game.

====United Kingdom====
During his suspension, he attempted to continue playing hockey in the United Kingdom with the London Knights, where his elder brother Chris was coaching, but this move was blocked by the International Ice Hockey Federation, in deference to the NHL. A similar intention to play in Germany for the Munich Barons also failed. He joined the Grand Rapids Griffins of the International Hockey League and dressed for 14 games.

In the autumn of 2001, following the completion of his suspension, McSorley again looked towards the other side of the Atlantic. He considered purchasing the then struggling Cardiff Devils team with his brother, to become a player-coach and to help to develop interest in the sport in the UK. He appeared as a guest player for both the Devils and the British national ice hockey team during a series of games in November 2001, but the deal to purchase the Devils failed to come through.

===Coaching career===
McSorley coached the Springfield Falcons of the American Hockey League between 2002 and 2004.

===Film and TV career===
From 1995 to 1997, McSorley appeared in four movies in small roles: &quot;Bad Boys&quot; (1995), &quot;Forget Paris&quot; (1995), &quot;Con Air&quot; (1997) and &quot;Do Me A Favor&quot; (1997).

During the 2005–06 NHL season, McSorley worked for Fox Sports West in Los Angeles, providing in-studio analysis of games involving the Los Angeles Kings or the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. He provided color commentary for the San Jose Sharks games on FSN Bay Area in 2006-07. His time in that role ended mysteriously midway through the Sharks&#x27; playoff series with Detroit when the Sharks announced McSorley would not return for the broadcast of Game 3 for personal reasons. No further explanation was given.

He appeared in one episode of &quot;CSI: Miami&quot; in 2005 as rink manager Andrew Greven. On July 30, 2007, McSorley guest starred on ABC Family&#x27;s &quot;Greek&quot; as himself playing a hockey goaltender. In February 2008, McSorley was featured as one of the pros on &quot;Pros vs Joes&quot; on Spike TV.

Canadian singer-songwriter Kathleen Edwards referred to McSorley in her song &quot;I Make the Dough, You Get the Glory&quot;, with the lyric, &quot;You&#x27;re the Great One, I&#x27;m Marty McSorley..., I make the dough, but you get the glory.&quot; McSorley appears in the song&#x27;s music video.

McSorley is currently a TV analyst for Sportsnet and occasionally &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;. He is a regular at Staples Center during Kings hockey games.

He appeared as himself in season 4, episode 1 of &quot;Shoresy&quot;.

===Personal life===
McSorley currently resides in Arizona. He married beach volleyball player Leanne Schuster in August 2002. They have three children.

<text>Paint stripper or paint remover is a chemical product designed to remove paint, finishes, and coatings, while also cleaning the underlying surface. Chemical paint removers are advantageous because they act on any kind of geometry and they are cheap. They can however be slow acting.

Paint can also be removed using mechanical methods (scraping or sanding) or heat (hot air, radiant heat, or steam).

==Types==
The selection of chemical paint removers is based on the chemical bonds that form the paint&#x27;s binder. Two basic categories of chemical paint removers are caustic and solvent.

===Caustics===
Caustic paint removers, typically aqueous sodium hydroxide (also known as lye or caustic soda), work by breaking down the chemical bonds of the paint, usually by hydrolysis of the esters that comprise the paint film. Caustic removers must be neutralized or the new finish will fail prematurely. In addition, as caustic paint strippers typically include corrosive active ingredients, several side effects and health risks must be taken into account in using. Caustic aqueous solutions are typically used by antique dealers who aim to restore old furniture by stripping off worn varnishes, for example.

===Solvents===
Solvent-base paint strippers can be complex mixtures of various organic solvents, emulsifiers, thickening agents, alkaline or acid active ingredients as well as evaporation and corrosion inhibitors. Dichloromethane, also called methylene chloride, is a popular solvent, but its use has been declining because of health concerns. Traditional solvent paint strippers penetrate the layers of paint and break the bond between the paint and the object by swelling the paint.

Aside from dichloromethane, some popular stripping solvents are N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethylformamide, benzyl alcohol, and dimethyl adipate. None of these are chlorocarbons.

Paint strippers come in a liquid, or a gel (&quot;thixotropic&quot;) form that clings even to vertical surfaces.

Solvent strippers may also have formulations with limonene (obtained from orange peels) (or other terpene solvents). Nitromethane is another commonly used solvent. Dimethyl sulfoxide is a less toxic alternative solvent used in some formulations. Unfortunately, these alternative stripping formulas are less effective compared to those based on dichloromethane.

==Alternatives==
Heat guns are an alternative to chemical paint strippers. When heated, softened paint clumps and is easier to contain. High-temperature heat guns at or more create toxic lead fumes in lead-based paint, but low-temperature heat guns and infrared paint removers do not create lead fumes. Fire is a possible hazard of using heat guns.

Steam can be used on large surfaces or items to be stripped, such as window sash, can be placed inside a steam box.

==Safety==
A product&#x27;s material safety data sheet can provides more safety information than its product labels.

Many traditional paint strippers were or are based on dichloromethane, which can pose serious health risks. and is banned in some countries for consumer use. Despite this, deaths from dichloromethane are extremely rare at fewer than 2.4 cases per year and associated mostly with users applying large amounts in confined, poorly ventilated spaces. When applied in reasonable amounts and with typical levels of ventilation, or outdoors, it is generally safe to use.

Removing old lead-based paint can disperse lead and cause lead poisoning, leading several US workplace and environmental regulations address removal of old paint that could contain lead.

<doc id="871176" wikidata="Q1700207" url="?curid=871176" title="John Gibson (sculptor)">
<text>John Gibson (19 June 1790 – 27 January 1866) was a Welsh neoclassical sculptor who studied in Rome under Canova. He excelled chiefly in bas-relief, notably the two life-size works &quot;The Hours Leading the Horses of the Sun&quot; and &quot;Phaethon Driving the Chariot of the Sun&quot;, but was also proficient in monumental and portrait statuary. He is famous for his statues of Sir Robert Peel (Westminster Abbey), William Huskisson (St George&#x27;s Square) and Queen Victoria (Houses of Parliament). Gibson was elected a Royal Academician in 1836, and left the contents of his studio to the Royal Academy, where many of his marbles and casts are currently on display.

==Life==
===Early life===
Gibson was born near Conwy, Wales, where his father was a market gardener. 
When he was nine years old the family were on the point of emigrating to America, but his mother put a stop to this plan on their arrival at Liverpool, where they settled, and where Gibson was sent to school. He became fascinated by the displays in the windows of the city&#x27;s print shops. The painter and printseller John Turmeau lent him some drawings and plaster casts to copy.

===Education===
At the age of fourteen, Gibson was apprenticed to a firm of cabinet-makers. He soon took a violent dislike to this work, however, and eventually managed to have his articles bought out by the monumental masons Samuel and Thomas Franceys. It was while apprenticed to the Franceys brothers that Gibson came to the attention of the historian William Roscoe, for whom he executed a terracotta bas-relief now in the Liverpool museum. Roscoe gave Gibson access to his library at Allerton, by which means he became acquainted with the designs of the great Italian masters.
A cartoon (now also in the Liverpool museum) of &quot;The Fall of the Angels&quot; marked this period. He studied anatomy, his lessons provided gratuitously by a medical man, and gained introductions to families of refinement and culture in Liverpool. Roscoe was an excellent guide to his protégée, pointing to the Greeks as the only examples for a sculptor. Gibson here found his true vocation. A basso rilievo of &quot;Psyche Carried by the Zephyrs&quot; was the result. He sent it to the Royal Academy, where John Flaxman, recognizing its merits, gave it an excellent place. Again he became unsettled. He conceived a wish to further his artistic education in Rome, and the first step to this goal went to go to London; there he received conflicting advice from Flaxman and from Francis Legatt Chantrey, the former urging him go to Rome as the highest school of sculpture in the world, the latter maintaining that London could do as much for him.

===Rome===

Gibson arrived in Rome in October 1817, at a comparatively late age for a first visit. There he was generously received by Antonio Canova, to whom he had introductions, the Venetian sculptor putting not only his experience in art but his purse at the English student&#x27;s service. Up to this time, though his designs show a fire and power of imagination in which no teaching is missed, Gibson had had no instruction, and had studied at no academy. In Rome he first became acquainted with the rules and technicalities of art. Canova introduced him into the academy supported by Austria, and the first sense of his deficiencies in common matters of practice was depressing to him. He saw Italian youths already excelling in the drawing of the figure. But the tables were soon turned. His first work in marble, &quot;Sleeping Shepherd Boy&quot;, was completed in 1824.

Gibson was soon launched, and distinguished patrons, initially sent by Canova, made their way to his studio in the Via Fontanella. His aim was always purity of character and beauty of form. He rarely declined into the prettiness of Canova, and if he did not often approach the masculine strength of Bertel Thorvaldsen, he more than once surpassed him even in that quality. He was essentially classic in feeling and aim, but here his habit of observation enabled him to achieve a grace beyond the reach of a mere imitator. His subjects were gleaned from the free actions of the Italian people noticed on his walks, and afterwards given such mythological names as best fitted them. Thus a girl kissing a child over her shoulder became a &quot;Nymph and Cupid&quot;; a woman helping her child with his foot on her hand on to her lap, a &quot;Bacchante and Faun&quot;; his &quot;Amazon Thrown from Her Horse&quot;, one of his most original productions, was taken from an accident he witnessed to a female rider in a circus; and &quot;Hunter and Dog&quot; was also the result of a street scene.

==Personal life==
Throughout most of his time in Rome Gibson had an alleged relationship with the Welsh artist Penry Williams.

===Death===
Gibson was elected R.A. in 1836, and bequeathed all his property and the contents of his studio to the Royal Academy, where his marbles and casts are open to the public . He died at Rome on 7 January 1866 and was buried in the Protestant Cemetery there.

==Reception==
In monumental and portrait statues for public places, necessarily represented in postures of dignity and repose, Gibson was very happy. His largest effort of this class was the group showing &quot;Queen Victoria Supported by Justice and Clemency&quot;, in the Houses of Parliament, his finest work in the round. Of noble character also in execution and expression of thought is the statue of William Huskisson with the bared arm; and no less, in effect of aristocratic ease and refinement, the seated figure of Dudley North.

Gibson&#x27;s chief excellence, however, lay in basso rilievo. His thorough knowledge of the horse, and his constant study of the Elgin Marbles, casts of which are in Rome, resulted in the two &quot;bassi rilievi&quot;, the size of life, which belonged to Lord Fitzwilliam: &quot;The Hours Leading the Horses of the Sun&quot;, and &quot;Phaethon Driving the Chariot of the Sun&quot;. Most of his memorial works are also in basso rilievo. Some of these are of a truly refined and pathetic character, such as the monument to the Countess of Leicester, wife of Thomas Coke, the 1st Earl, or that to his friend Mrs Huskisson in Chichester Cathedral, and that of the Bonomi children. Passion, either indulged or repressed, was the natural impulse of his art: repressed as in the &quot;Hours Leading the Horses of the Sun&quot;, and as in the &quot;Hunter and Dog&quot;; indulged as in the meeting of Hero and Leander, a drawing executed before he left England. Gibson was the first to introduce colour on his statues, first as a mere border to the drapery of a portrait statue of the queen, and by degrees extended to the entire flesh, as in his so-called &quot;Tinted Venus&quot; and in &quot;Love Tormenting the Soul&quot;, both now in the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool.

In all worldly affairs and the business of daily life he was simple and guileless in the extreme; but was resolute in matters of principle. He was visited by William Dean Howells in Naples who described him as &quot;dressed with extraordinary slovenliness and indifference to clothes, had no collar, I think, and evidently did not know what he had one. Everything about him bespoke the utmost unconsciousness and democratic plainness of life.&quot;

<text>Gaetano Milanesi (1813-1895) was an Italian scholar and writer on the history of art.

==Biography==
Milanesi was born at Siena, where he studied law, and in 1838 he obtained an appointment in the public library.

In 1856 he was elected member of the Accademia della Crusca, in which capacity he took part in the compilation of its famous but still unfinished dictionary, and two years later was appointed assistant keeper of the Tuscan archives, in Florence; then he took charge of the famous Medici archives, whence he collected a vast body of material on the history of Italian art, not all of which is yet published. In 1889 he became director of the archives, but retired in 1892, and died three years later.

His most important publication is his edition of Vasari&#x27;s works in nine volumes, with copious and valuable notes (Florence, 1878 1885). Of his other writings the following may be mentioned:
*&quot;Il diario inedito di Alessandro Sozzini&quot; (in the Archivio storico Italiano, 1842)
*&quot;Documenti per la storia dell&#x27; arte senese&quot;, 3 vols. (Siena, 1854-1856)

<text>The Aryan Games () were a proposed replacement for the Olympic Games in Nazi Germany. Proposed by Nazi sports organizer Carl Diem and subsequently adopted by Adolf Hitler, these multi-sport games were supposed to be housed permanently in Nuremberg at the planned &quot;German Stadium&quot;, that had been designed by Nazi architect Albert Speer, but was never built.

The idea was originally entertained in 1939 by Carl Diem, chief organiser of the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, who ahead of the 1936 Olympics was already noted for claiming that &quot;Germanics may only be defeated by other Germanics,&quot; which turned out not to be the case. The idea was subsequently adopted by Hitler, who told Albert Speer that once the German Stadium was built, there would be no more Olympic Games, only the Aryan Games.

<doc id="871185" wikidata="Q5591" url="?curid=871185" title="Pinturicchio">
<text>Pinturicchio, or Pintoricchio (, ; born Bernardino di Betto; 1454–1513), also known as Benetto di Biagio or Sordicchio, was an Italian Renaissance painter. He acquired his nickname (meaning &quot;little painter&quot;) because of his small stature and he used it to sign some of his artworks that were created during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Pinturicchio was born the son of Benedetto or Betto di Biagio, in Perugia. In his career, he may have trained under lesser-known Perugian painters such as Bonfigli and Fiorenzo di Lorenzo. According to Vasari, Pinturicchio was a paid assistant of Perugino.

The works of the Perugian Renaissance school are very similar and often paintings by Perugino, Pinturicchio, Lo Spagna, and a young Raphael may be mistaken, one for the other. In the execution of large frescoes, pupils and assistants had a large share in the work, either in enlarging the master&#x27;s sketch to the full-sized cartoon, in transferring the cartoon to the wall, or in painting backgrounds or accessories.

His assignment in Rome, to decorate the Sistine Chapel, was an experience fraught with learning from prominent artists of the time, including: Sandro Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Pietro Vanucci, and Luca Signorelli. The Sistine Chapel was where it is believed that Pinturicchio was collaborating with Perugino to some extent. Pinturicchio&#x27;s fresco, &quot;Assumption of Mary&quot;, executed in 1481 on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel, was destroyed in 1535 to make way for Michelangelo&#x27;s Last Judgement.

===Work in Santa Maria del Popolo in Rome===

After assisting Perugino in his frescoes in the Sistine Chapel, Pinturicchio was employed by various members of the Della Rovere family to decorate the Semi-Gods Ceiling of Palazzo dei Penitenzieri as well as a series of chapels in the church of Santa Maria del Popolo, where he appears to have worked from 1484, or earlier, until 1492.

Critic Evelyn March Phillipps sums up his work by saying that the basilica &quot;[w]ould be if it had been left with all its original decorations, one of the finest monuments to Pintoricchio’s art in Italy. A great deal remains, but much has been swept away&quot;.

The earliest known of his works is an altarpiece of the &quot;Adoration of the Shepherds&quot;, in the Della Rovere Chapel, the first chapel (from the west) on the south, built by Cardinal Domenico della Rovere. In the lunettes under the vault, Pinturicchio painted small scenes from the life of St. Jerome. The polychrome grotesque wall decoration on a yellow-gold background probably was inspired by the paintings of the Domus Aurea, and belongs the earliest and highest quality of their kind in Rome.

The frescos he painted in the Cybo Chapel, built by Cardinal Lorenzo Cybo de Mari in the beginning of the sixteenth century, were destroyed in 1682, when the chapel was rebuilt by Cardinal Alderano Cybo. The old fresco of the &quot;Virgin and the Child&quot; by Pinturicchio was detached from the wall and sent by the cardinal to Massa in 1687. The fragment was re-used as the altarpiece of the Ducal Chapel of the Cathedral of Massa.

The third chapel on the south is that of Girolamo Basso della Rovere, nephew of Pope Sixtus IV, and bishop of Recanati. The Basso Della Rovere Chapel contains a fine altarpiece, &quot;Madonna enthroned between Four Saints&quot;, and on the eastern side a very nobly composed fresco of the &quot;Assumption of the Virgin&quot;. The vault and its lunettes are richly decorated with small paintings of the Life of the Virgin, surrounded by graceful arabesques; and the dado is covered with monochrome paintings of scenes from the lives of saints, illusionistic benches, and very gracefully and powerfully drawn figures of women in full length, in which the influence of Luca Signorelli may be traced.

In the Costa Chapel, Pinturicchio or one of his helpers painted the &quot;Four Latin Doctors&quot; in the lunettes of the vault. Most of these frescoes are considerably injured by moisture and have suffered little from restoration. The last paintings completed by Pinturicchio in this church are found on the vault behind the choir, where he painted decorative frescoes, with main lines arranged to suit their surroundings in a skilful way. In the centre is an octagonal panel, &quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot;, and surrounding it, are medallions of the Four Evangelists. The spaces between them are filled by reclining figures of the Four Sibyls. On each pendentive is a figure of one of the Four Doctors enthroned under a niched canopy. The bands that separate these paintings have elaborate arabesques on a gold ground, and the whole is painted with broad and effective touches, very telling when seen (as is necessarily the case) from a considerable distance below.

==Works in the Vatican Library==
In 1492, Pinturicchio was summoned to Orvieto Cathedral. However, he was also commissioned by Pope Alexander VI (Borgia) to decorate a recently completed suite of six rooms, the Borgia Apartments in the Apostolic Palace of the Vatican. These rooms now form part of the Vatican Library, and five still retain a series of Pinturicchio frescoes. He worked in these rooms until around 1494, assisted by his pupils, and not without interruption. It was not until Pope Alexander VI died that Pinturicchio left Rome for Umbria, leaving much of the work in Rome to be completed by Michelangelo, Raphael, and others.

Among other important frescoes by Pinturicchio that still exist in Rome and are in good condition, are in the Bufalini Chapel in the southwest sector of Santa Maria in Ara Coeli, probably executed around 1484–1486. On the altar wall is a grand painting of St. Bernardino of Siena between two other saints, crowned by angels; in the upper part is a figure of Christ in a mandorla, surrounded by angel musicians; on the left wall is a large fresco of the miracles performed by the corpse of St. Bernardino, which includes portraits of members of the sponsoring Bufalini family.

One group of three women, the central figure with a child at her breast, recalls the grace of Raphael&#x27;s second manner. The composition of the main group around the saint&#x27;s corpse appears to have been suggested by Giotto&#x27;s painting of St. Francis on his bier that is found in Santa Croce at Florence. On the vault are four noble figures of the Evangelists, usually attributed to Luca Signorelli, but as with the rest of the frescoes in this chapel, they are more probably by Pinturicchio. On the vault of the sacristy of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere, Pinturicchio painted the Almighty surrounded by the Evangelists. During a visit to Orvieto in 1496, Pinturicchio painted in the choir of the Duomo two more figures of the Latin Doctors. For these he received fifty gold ducats. Now, like the rest of his work at Orvieto, these figures are almost destroyed. In Umbria, his masterpiece is the Baglioni Chapel in the church of S. Maria Maggiore in Spello.

Among his panel paintings the following are the most important: an altarpiece for S. Maria de&#x27; Fossi at Perugia, painted in 1496–1498, now moved to the city gallery, depicts a &quot;Madonna enthroned among Saints&quot;, very minutely painted; the wings of the retable have standing figures of St. Augustine and St. Jerome; and the predella has paintings in miniature of the Annunciation and the Evangelists. Another fine altarpiece, similar in delicacy of detail, and probably painted about the same time, is that in the cathedral of San Severino — the Madonna enthroned looks down toward the kneeling donor. In beauty of face and expression, the angels at the sides recall the manner of Lorenzo di Credi or Da Vinci.

The Vatican galleries have the largest of Pinturicchio&#x27;s panels — the Coronation of the Virgin, with the apostles and other saints below. Several well-executed portraits occur among the kneeling saints. The Virgin, who kneels at Christ&#x27;s feet to receive her crown, is a figure of great tenderness and beauty, and the lower group is composed with great skill and grace in arrangement.

In 1504, Pinturicchio designed a mosaic floor panel for the Cathedral of Siena: &quot;the Story of Fortuna, or the Hill of Virtue&quot;. This was executed by Paolo Mannucci in 1506. On top of the panel, a symbolic representation of Knowledge hands the palm of victory to Socrates.

Among the public collections holding works by Pinturicchio are, the Ashmolean Museum (University of Oxford), Biblioteca Ambrosiana (Milan), the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Courtauld Institute of Art (London), the Denver Art Museum, the Fitzwilliam Museum (University of Cambridge), the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Louvre, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the National Gallery, London, Palazzo Ruspoli (Rome), the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana (Milan), Princeton University Art Museum, Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, the Vatican Museums, and the Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest).

<doc id="871187" wikidata="Q816832" url="?curid=871187" title="Benedetto Bonfigli">
<text>Benedetto Bonfigli (c. 1420 – 8 July 1496) was an Italian Renaissance painter born in Perugia, and part of the Umbria school of painters including Raphael and Perugino. He is also known as &quot;Buonfiglio&quot;. Influenced by the style of Domenico Veneziano, Benozzo Gozzoli, and Fra Angelico, Bonfigli primarily painted frescos for the church and was at one point employed in the Vatican. His best-preserved work is the &quot;Annunciation&quot;, but his masterpiece is the decoration of the chapel of the Palazzo dei Priori. Bonfigli specialized in &quot;gonfaloni&quot;, a Perugian style using banners painted on canvas or linen. Little is known of his personal life, but he was an esteemed painter in Perugia before Perugino, who is said to be his pupil.

== Style ==
Bonfigli as a painter was heavily influenced by Fra Angelico. His attention to detail in smaller areas of his paintings, as well as his use of gold to highlight both sacred and earthly elements, can be attributed to Fra Angelico. Bonfigli frequently used backdrops of forestry and cityscapes to provide an additional sense of depth to his pieces. His backgrounds are often said to have been influenced by Domenico Veneziano, who used rolling hills and trees as backdrops to make his paintings more realistic. These stylistic influences of Angelico and Veneziano&#x27;s are particularly pertinent in Bonfigli&#x27;s &quot;Annunciation&quot; and &quot;Adoration of the Child.&quot; Most of Bonfigli&#x27;s frescos use softer colours in the fabrics on his figures, but typically highlights the Virgin Mary in blue, an expensive dye attributed with royalty and sanctity, with a gold halo. He often incorporates historical architecture from his home town Perugia in his works, sometimes meshing buildings of different eras. Bonfigli&#x27;s method is also similar to his teacher, Benozzo Gozzoli, who had been Fra Angelico&#x27;s assistant and had worked in Umbria from 1450 to 1456, in that he uses softer colours on the garments of his figures that brings additional depth to his paintings.

== Early life and first works ==
Bonfigli trained in Perugia from 1430 to 1440, while the late-Gothic style was still dominant. Bonfigli&#x27;s earliest surviving work is a dismembered polyptych, depicting &quot;Virgin and Child&quot; on the central panel, &quot;St Sebastian and a Bishop Saint&quot; on another wing, and what is believed to be &quot;St Bernardino of Siena&quot; and &quot;St Anthony Abbot&quot; on another.

The painter&#x27;s first commissioned work is attributed to the &quot;Virgin and Child with Two Angels&quot; for a chapel near S. Pietro, Perugia on 7 March 1445. He was influenced by the works of Fra Angelico, particularly during his employment in the Vatican by Pope Nicholas V in 1450, where many of Angelico&#x27;s frescoes were displayed in the Cappella Niccolina of the Palazzo Vaticano, the pope&#x27;s private chapel.

We know Bonifgli was held in high regard by the pope due to his high salary at the time (seven ducats a month). Other works, such as Fra Angelico&#x27;s Cortona Polyptych commissioned in 1437, and the works of Domenico Veneziano in Perugia also heavily influenced Bonfigli&#x27;s style. A close interpretation of Bonfigli&#x27;s style is evident in a fresco dated 1446 of &quot;SS Catherine and Clement I&quot; in S. Cristoforo, Passigano; this piece, likely not the work of Bonfigli, demonstrates the influence the painter had on the region.
== Maturity ==
Bonfigli reached maturity as an artist after returning to Perugia from Rome between 1453 and 1470. During this period, he painted the &quot;Annunciation&quot;, a smaller piece but among his most well-known and preserved, held in the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid. Bonfigli was influenced by the style of Gozzoli, a Florentine Renaissance painter; his stylistic method is evident in Bonfigli&#x27;s &quot;Annunciation with St. Luke&quot; and &quot;Virgin and the Four Saints&quot;, both held in the Galleria Nazionale dell&#x27;Umbria in Perugia, Italy. According to Giorgio Vasari, the Perugian artist painted the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; coupled with a predella of &quot;Episodes from the Life of Christ and a Miracle of St Nicholas&quot; in 1466 for the chapel of San Vincenzo in San Domenico, collaborating with Bartolomeo Caporali.

One of his masterpieces is a series of frescoes in the chapel of the Palazzo dei Priori in Perugia, which represent the &quot;Lives of St Louis of Toulouse and St Herculanus&quot;; the frescoes were commenced in 1454 and not finished in 1496, in which year Bonfigli&#x27;s will is dated. One &quot;gonfalone,&quot; or banner, was painted in 1465 for the brotherhood of San Bernardino, and represented the deeds of their patron saint. Another &quot;gonfalone&quot; was painted for the brotherhood of San Fiorenzo in 1476. He painted the &quot;Virgin of Mercy&quot; (1478) for the church of the Commenda di Santa Croce. All of these works comprised a collection of &quot;gonfaloni&quot; across Perugia.

===The Palazzo dei Priori===
Chaplain Bartolomeo da Siena commissioned Bonfigli in 1454 to decorate half of the Priori Chapel. The chaplain intended to have the chapel painted with the Crucifixion with the Virgin and SS John the Evangelist, Laurence and Herculanus on the altar wall; and four scenes from the life of St Louis of Toulouse. The commission was altered later, and the fresco of the Crucifixion on the altar wall was not painted. The other four scenes of St Louis of Toulouse were arranged counter-clockwise from the right of the altar wall. One scene shows St Louis professing the Franciscan Rule before Pope Boniface VIII; another shows St Louis posthumously reuniting a merchant, with the church of San Domenico in Perugia clearly visible in the background; the third, badly damaged, depicts a miracle performed by St Louis; and the fourth shows St Louis&#x27;s burial in a church resembling the church of St Pietro in Perugia. This half of the Priori chapel was finished in 1461, and the artist Filippo Lippi adjudicated the work and priced it at 400 Florentine florins. The works are now held in the Galleria Nazionale dell&#x27;Umbria.
==== &quot;Totila&#x27;s siege of Perugia&quot; ====
The second half of the chapel was also commissioned to Bonfigli to decorate. The frescoes in the second half depict the scenes from the life of St Herculanus. The original commission was for four frescoes, but Bonfigli only painted three. The right of the back wall was painted with the fresco &quot;Totila&#x27;s siege of Perugia.&quot; This wildly active fresco is divided into two scenes, with the siege of Totila depicted on the left and the scene after the city has fallen on the right. The left side shows Totila&#x27;s army camped out around the ruins of the amphitheatre outside Porta Marzia which effected the siege when it began in 542. The left scene takes place in 549, where the soldiers gather around an ox. This ox was thrown over the city walls by St. Herculanus to convince the army the city still had provisions, but the trick was ruined by a cleric who revealed the lie. The right side of the fresco shows a few citizens of Perugia laying a beheaded St Herculanus and a young boy into a grave after the city had fallen. The city in the background provides a depiction of the Colle Landone, a hill in Perugia occupied by the Etruscans in the 4th century B.C., before the building of the Roman wall Rocca Paolina in 1540. The fresco shows historical buildings of Perugia, including the Porta Marzia, the church of Sant&#x27; Ercolano, and the towers of Baglioni palaces.
==== &quot;Translation to San Pietro&quot; ====
Left of the altar wall in the Priori Chapel is the fresco &quot;Translation to San Pietro.&quot; The scene takes place after the fall of Perugia to Totila and the martyrdom of Herculanus. A procession carries the uncorrupt body of Herculanus, having passed Sant’ Ercolano  and San Domenico and about to enter San Pietro. Herculanus is carried on a bier, and a small boy behind him to the left represents the boy who had been buried with him and brought back to life.

==== &quot;Translation to the Duomo&quot; ====
The whole of the left wall of the Chapel was covered with a scene that has been badly damaged. The frescos depict the translation of the relics of St. Herculanus in 936 from San Pietro to the Duomo. The surviving fragments show three different scenes; a group of Dominicans entering the Duomo, the Palazzo dei Priori with city magistrates passing along the side; and a group of women passing alongside the San Domenico Vecchio. These scenes are logically the last scenes of the story of St Herculanus, but Bonfigli placed them in clockwise sequence between the &quot;Translation to San Pietro&quot; and &quot;Totila&#x27;s siege of Perugia,&quot; likely because of the expanse of the left wall.

The commission was supposed to be completed in two years, but the work took far longer because of a delay of payment by the Commune for the first commission. The contract was renegotiated in 1469 with a debt owed by one Bartolomeo di Gregorio to Bonfigli. The frescoes were not completed by Bonfigli&#x27;s death in 1496, but the painter dedicated the outstanding debt to complete the rest of the chapel frescoes.

===The Annunciation ===
One of Bonfigli&#x27;s best-preserved works, the &quot;Annunciation&quot; depicts Mother Mary receiving two small flames into her heart from the Dove of the Holy Spirit, sent down by God surrounded by cherubs. The work is believed to have been executed between 1440 and 1445. The Virgin Mary appears to pray on the right next to the Archangel Gabriel with gold wings on the left. Gabriel is kneeling with a lily in his left hand, and his right hand raised in blessing while he pronounces the phrase on the marble-panelled parapet, &quot;AVE MARIA GRATIA PLENA,&quot; or &quot;Hail Mary full of grace.&quot;

Within the open terrace enclosed by the decorated parapet is Mary&#x27;s lectern and wooden chair in the middle distance. An open prayer book rests on the lectern, which has an open cupboard containing various books. The background depicts a walled city on the shores of a lake, active with merchant vessels.

Bonfigli demonstrates his style by combining gold elements with gothic features, contrasting the divine halos and wings with the Gothic windows of the double loggia, presumed to be the Virgin&#x27;s house, on the right. Bonfigli uses gold not only to accentuate the divine elements in the piece, but also in the greater, more earthly areas of the sky and textiles worn by Mary and the angel. This use of gold is often attributed to an earlier Gothic style, but does not detract from the sense of depth or reality in the scene. Bonfigli contrasts the Gothic details of the piece with classical ones, including the low wall separating the foreground and background which appears to be more modern in material and design.

The landscape in the &quot;Annunciation&quot; is also attributed to the influence of Domenico Veneziano, another Renaissance painter who worked in Perugia from 1438 to 1454. This piece is often compared with Veneziano&#x27;s earliest dated work, &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot;, held in the Gemäldegalerie in Berlin, where Bonfigli derived the sense of depth created by the pine trees in the middle of the painting. Fra Angelico&#x27;s influence can also be noticed in the fine details of the work in the immediate foreground, such as the glass vase filled with roses.

The &quot;Annunciation&quot; belonged to the collection of Thomas Pelham Hood in Ulster during the 19th century, and was passed to another private collection in Rome before being sold on the Italian art market. In 1977, the first year the piece was on the market, it was purchased by Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza. The painting has suffered wear; the colours are rubbed and the modelling in the faces has suffered damage, and vertical cracks exist in the painted surface. The draperies and other colour losses have since been retouched. 

== Legacy ==
Benedetto Bonfigli is notable in that he is one of the Renaissance&#x27;s earliest notable painters native to Perugia, granting the city artistic credibility before Raphael began his works. Bonfigli did not rank as high as other Renaissance artists of his time, including Niccolo da Foligno, his fellow pupil under Gozzoli. As Bernhard Berenson writes in his book, &quot;far was it from [Bonfigli] to harbour a feeling... for what in painting is more essential than charming faces and pretty colour&quot;. Berenson describes the painter as &quot;a much more dependent person&quot;, and more &quot;imitative&quot;. Others argue that much of Bonfigli&#x27;s work was critical in the birth of the Umbria school of art, that had lagged behind Florence and Northern Italy until the mid 15th century, but quickly rose as a first rank with Perugino, his student, and then Raphael.

<text>Cromford () is a village and civil parish in Derbyshire, England, in the valley of the River Derwent between Wirksworth and Matlock. It is north of Derby, south of Matlock and south of Matlock Bath. It is first mentioned in the 11th-century Domesday Book as &quot;Crumforde&quot;, a (supporting farm) of Wirksworth, and this remained the case throughout the Middle Ages. The population at the 2011 Census was 1,433. It is principally known for its historical connection with Richard Arkwright and the nearby Cromford Mill, which he built outside the village in 1771. Cromford is in the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site.

The Cromford mill complex, owned and being restored by the Arkwright Society, was declared by Historic England as &quot;one of the country’s 100 irreplaceable sites&quot;. It is also the centrepiece of the Derwent Valley Mills UNESCO World Heritage Site.

In 2018, the &quot;Cromford Mills Creative Cluster and World Heritage Site Gateway Project&quot; was listed as a finalist for the &quot;Best Major Regeneration of a Historic Building or Place&quot; in the Historic England Angel Awards.

==Geography==
The River Derwent, with its sources on Bleaklow in the Dark Peak, flows southward to Derby and then into the River Trent. The geology of this section in the Derbyshire Dales is that of limestone. The fast flowing river has cut a deep valley. The A6 trunk road, which was the main road between London and Manchester in former times, the Cromford Canal and the Derwent Valley Line, linking Derby and Matlock, were all built in the river valley. The Via Gellia valley joins the Derwent at Cromford; however, the stream which runs through that valley is actually the Ivonbrook and historically the valley was called the Ivonbrook Valley. The Via Gellia is simply the name of the road which runs along it, named after the Gell family who owned many mines in the area.

==History==

It is one of the significant sites in the development of the Industrial Revolution. Here, Richard Arkwright built his cotton mill to make use of the water frame.

More specifically, according to &quot;Peak District Online&quot;, &quot;Cromford is also known as the &#x27;cradle&#x27; or `birthplace` of the Industrial Revolution for this was where Richard Arkwright (1732-1792), perhaps Britain&#x27;s first ever `industrial tycoon` and known as `The Father of the Factory System` chose to build the world&#x27;s first water-powered cotton mill in 1771.&quot;

The Gell family, who were local Hopton landowners heavily involved in the nearby Wirksworth lead mining district, had the Via Gellia built to connect Cromford and Grangemill in the late 18th century.

Various cottages and farm buildings pre-date Arkwright&#x27;s time, but a large part of the village was built to house the mill workers. One source states that these are now considered to be &quot;the first factory housing development in the world&quot;. Employees were provided with shops, pubs, chapels and a school.

Willersley Castle, now a Grade II* listed building, was also built by Richard Arkwright in 1791; after a fire in 1792, it was rebuilt and occupied by his son Richard Arkwright junior starting in 1796.

In the early 1800s, Scarthin Nick was &quot;blasted through with dynamite to make way for what later became the A6, thus annexing the Arkwright industrial mill complex on the east side of the main Derby road and the Market Place and village at the bottom of the hill which climbs steeply westward towards Wirksworth, on the other&quot;.

The 20th century saw the development of council and private housing. Dene quarry, currently operated by Tarmac Ltd for the production of aggregates and roadstone, was excavated to the south west of the village from 1942 onwards.
In December 2001 a corridor from Masson Mill in Matlock Bath to the Silk Mill in Derby and including the mills in Cromford, Milford, Belper and Darley Abbey was declared the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site. Masson Mill was described by the &quot;Peak District Online&quot; in 2006 as &quot;perhaps the most prominent of Arkwright’s constructions ... and still in use today as a heritage site museum and retailer outlet&quot;.

==Cultural references==
The 1931 novel &quot;Saturday Night at the Greyhound&quot; by John Hampson takes place over the course of one evening in the bar at the Greyhound Hotel, Cromford.

In late 2006, Anand Tucker used certain parts of Cromford, including its historic bookshop, for his film &quot;And When Did You Last See Your Father?&quot;, based on the autobiographical memoir by poet Blake Morrison. Colin Firth plays the adult Blake, with Jim Broadbent cast as his dying father.

An industrial site in the German town of Ratingen is named Textilfabrik Cromford after Cromford, as this is where the industrial pioneer Johann Gottfried Brügelmann in 1783 erected the first factory outside England, using Arkwright&#x27;s factory as an archetype. The factory today forms part of the Rheinisches Industriemuseum.

Cromford railway station is located on the Matlock–Derby Derwent Valley Line and can be seen on the cover of the 1995 Oasis single &quot;Some Might Say&quot;.

==Governance==

Historically, Cromford was part of the &quot;Wirksworth Wapentake&quot; or &quot;Hundred&quot;; this administrative area, also known as the Soke of Wirksworth (the &quot;small county of Wirksworth&quot;), soon became West Derbyshire Council and is now called Derbyshire Dales District Council. The village is run locally by the Cromford Parish Council.

==Transport==

The A6, which links Carlisle with Luton, passes just to the north of the village; it provides easy access to Manchester, Stockport, Bakewell, Matlock and Derby.

Cromford railway station is served by trains along the Derwent Valley line between Derby and Matlock. The route is operated by East Midlands Railway, with services stopping generally hourly in both directions.

==Landmarks==
The Cromford Mill (1771) buildings and accommodation for workers to staff the factories form part of the Derwent Valley Mills, which is recognised as a World Heritage Site for its importance. North Street, constructed by Arkwright, is important as a very early purpose-built industrial workers&#x27; housing, and was rescued from dereliction in the 1970s by the Ancient Monument Society who have since sold off the houses. One house in the street is now a Landmark Trust holiday cottage.

Masson Mill (1783) is on the northern fringe of the village.

Willersley Castle dominates the hill on the east side of the river, with commanding views of Masson Mill, the village, and the road from Derby. Commissioned by Richard Arkwright, building work began in 1790, but was delayed by a fire in 1791. Richard Arkwright died in 1792, and the building was occupied by his son Richard in 1796. The Arkwright family moved out in 1922, and the building was acquired by some Methodist businessmen, and opened to guests as a Methodist Guild hotel in 1928. During World War II, the building was used as a maternity hospital by the Salvation Army while evacuated from their hospital in the East End of London.

St Mary&#x27;s Church, built between 1792 and 1797 by Richard Arkwright.

The Cromford Canal – built to service the mills – is now disused, but has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The canal tow-path can be followed from Cromford Wharf to High Peak Junction, and on to Whatstandwell and Ambergate. The Cromford and High Peak Railway, completed in 1831, ran from High Peak Junction to the Peak Forest Canal at Whaley Bridge. Its trackbed now forms the High Peak Trail, a walk and cycle route which is joined by the Tissington Trail at Parsley Hay.

==Notable residents==
*Francis Hurt (1803–1861), Tory politician and member of Parliament who represented a constituency in South Derbyshire
*George Turner (1841–1910), landscape artist, was born here.
*Alison Uttley, (1884–1976), writer, was born nearby at Castle Top Farm.

<text>Lentibulariaceae is a family of carnivorous plants containing three genera: &quot;Genlisea&quot;, the corkscrew plants; &quot;Pinguicula&quot;, the butterworts; and &quot;Utricularia&quot;, the bladderworts.

The genera &quot;Polypompholyx&quot; (two species of pink petticoats or fairy aprons) and &quot;Biovularia&quot; used to be regarded as fourth and fifth members of this family. &quot;Biovularia&quot; has been subsumed into &quot;Utricularia&quot;, and &quot;Polypompholyx&quot; has been relegated to a subgenus of &quot;Utricularia&quot;. Placement of the family used to be in the Scrophulariales, which has been merged with Lamiales in the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system.

==Evolution==

Carnivory in plants appears to have evolved independently in five major angiosperm lineages and six orders: Poales, Caryophyllales, Oxalidales, Ericales, Alismatales and Lamiales.

One common trait found in several Lamiales families that may have led to carnivory is the secretion of proteinase mucilage through leaf surfaces. This mucilage is generally used to prevent insect predation by trapping and degrading potentially harmful insects. Some research suggests these glands can quite easily shift their function from secretion to absorption. This shift may have first occurred in the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the Lentibulariaceae, introducing absorptive glands that provided additional macronutrients through trapped insects. The additional source of nutrients may have increased fitness of plants growing in low-nutrient habitats which eventually caused an embrace of carnivory. Further mapping of traits also suggests the MRCA was terrestrial and possessed a basal rosette composed of flat leaves and a primary root. Phylogenetics also confirmed that the Pinguicula are sister to the other two genera.

<text>Power Big Meet (sometimes shortened &quot;Power Meet&quot;) is a classic car show held in Lidköping, Sweden, for American cars (especially those from the 1950s and 1960s). It is held each summer during the first weekend of July and is a major event for people who hold an interest for old American cars from all over the world. While initially held Friday to Sunday, it has been changed to Thursday to Saturday.

Power Big Meet is one of the biggest car events in the world. Every year between 55 and 75 thousand people visit Power Big Meet to look at other and show their own cars at Hovby airfield in Lidköping.

The Power Big Meet began in 1978, and celebrated its largest crowd on record ever in 2007 during its 30th gathering.

During the Power Big Meet 2004 the police reported that an estimated 12,000 cars had participated in the festivities, breaking all previous records. During 2014 17,000 cars participated and 200,000 visitors showed up.

The 2017 Power Big Meet in Lidköping drew approximately 22,000 automobiles. Despite this, the newly instated Västerås Summer Meet only saw a minor decrease of cars and visitors compared to the previous year.

== Move to Lidköping and Västerås Summer Meet ==
The night of July 8, 2016, during Power Big Meet, Kjell &quot;Kjelle Power&quot; Gustafsson was robbed while carrying over 1 million SEK in cash that were supposed to be deposited at a nearby bank, something he had done the previous 30 years. According to Gustafsson, who owns the Power Big Meet trademark, there would be no more Power Big Meet, and the only ones who would be able to arrange it, besides himself, would be &quot;Jesus and his buddies&quot;. A few days later Klas &quot;Brinken&quot; Brink, a local entrepreneur who had been a part of the Power Big Meet team for 15 years, hoping that Gustafsson would have a change of heart, booked the airfield for a 2017 car meet. After a week of silence from Gustafsson about Power Big Meet, Brink stated in the press that he was prepared to save PBM and hoped that Gustafsson would join him and make the 40th Power Big Meet something special. Gustafsson stated that the booking of the airfield was an act of treason, and that Brink would be unable to organize anything as big as Power Big Meet. He also claimed that Brink had used the Power Big Meet brand without permission, threatening him with a lawsuit. As of July 2017, no suit has been filed.

On July 19 Gustafsson apparently changed his mind, stating there would indeed be a Power Big Meet in Västerås 2017, on the condition that Brink, one of the contacts between PBM, its sponsors and the city of Västerås, would not be allowed to get involved in any way whatsoever.

On October 30, Gustafsson confirmed a recent rumor that Power Big Meet would move to Lidköping, stating that the event had outgrown the Johannisberg airfield. Brink then started working on bringing a car meet to Västerås, and following a public poll the name of this meet was decided November 2: Västerås Summer Meet.

<text>Pietro Perugino ( ; ; born Pietro Vannucci or Pietro Vanucci; – 1523), an Italian Renaissance painter of the Umbrian school, developed some of the qualities that found classic expression in the High Renaissance. Raphael became his most famous pupil.

== Early years ==

Pietro Vannucci was born in Città della Pieve, Umbria, the son of Cristoforo Maria Vannucci. His nickname characterizes him as from Perugia, the chief city of Umbria. Scholars continue to dispute the socioeconomic status of the Vannucci family. While certain academics maintain that Vannucci worked his way out of poverty, others argue that his family was among the wealthiest in the town. His exact date of birth is not known, but based on his age at death that was mentioned by Vasari and Giovanni Santi, it is believed that he was born between 1446 and 1452.

Pietro most likely began studying painting in local workshops in Perugia such as those of Bartolomeo Caporali or Fiorenzo di Lorenzo. The date of the first Florentine sojourn is unknown; some make it as early as 1466-1470, others push the date to 1479. According to Vasari, he was apprenticed to the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio alongside Leonardo da Vinci, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Lorenzo di Credi, Filippino Lippi, and others. Piero della Francesca is thought to have taught him perspective form. In 1472, he must have completed his apprenticeship since he was enrolled as a master in the Confraternity of St Luke.

Perugino was one of the earliest central Italian practitioners of oil painting. Some of his early works were extensive frescoes for the convent of the Gesuati fathers at San Giusto alle Mura, destroyed during the Siege of Florence; he produced many cartoons for them also, which they executed with brilliant effect in stained glass. 

== Rome ==

Perugino returned from Florence to Perugia, where his Florentine training showed in the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; for the church of Santa Maria dei Servi of Perugia (). In about 1480, he was called to Rome by Sixtus IV to paint fresco panels for the Sistine Chapel walls. The frescoes he executed there included &quot;Moses&quot; &quot;and Zipporah&quot; (often attributed to Luca Signorelli), the &quot;Baptism of Christ&quot;, and &quot;Delivery of the Keys&quot;. Pinturicchio accompanied Perugino to Rome, and was made his partner, receiving a third of the profits. He may have done some of the Zipporah subjects. The Sistine frescoes were the major high Renaissance commissions in Rome. The altar wall was also painted with the Assumption, the Nativity, and Moses in the Bulrushes. These works were later destroyed to make space for Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Last Judgement&quot;.

Between 1486 and 1499, Perugino mainly worked between Florence and Perugia, maintaining studios in each city. According to Vasari, in Florence in September 1493, Perugino married Chiara, daughter of architect Luca Fancelli. 

== Later career ==
In 1496, the guild of the &quot;cambio&quot; (money-changers or bankers) of Perugia asked him to decorate their audience hall, the &quot;Sala delle Udienze del Collegio del Cambio&quot;. The humanist scholar Francesco Maturanzio acted as his consultant. This extensive scheme, which may have been finished by 1500, comprised the painting of the vault, showing the seven planets and the signs of the zodiac (Perugino being responsible for the designs and his assistants most probably for the majority of the execution), and the representation on the walls of two sacred subjects: the Nativity and Transfiguration; in addition, the Eternal Father, the cardinal virtues of Justice, Prudence, Temperance, Fortitude, Cato as the emblem of wisdom, and numerous life-sized figures of classic worthies, prophets, and sibyls figured in the program. On the mid-pilaster of the hall, Perugino placed his own portrait in bust-form. It is possible that Raphael, who in boyhood, toward 1496, may have been placed by his uncles under the tuition of Perugino, bore a hand in the work of the vaulting.

Perugino was made one of the priors of Perugia in 1501. On one occasion Michelangelo told Perugino to his face that he was a bungler in art (&quot;goffo nell arte&quot;): Vannucci brought an action for defamation of character, unsuccessfully. Put on his mettle by this mortifying transaction, he produced the masterpiece of the &quot;Madonna and Saints&quot; for the Certosa of Pavia, now disassembled and scattered among museums: the only portion in the Certosa is &quot;God the Father with cherubim&quot;. An &quot;Annunciation&quot; has disappeared; three panels, &quot;the Virgin adoring the infant Christ, St. Michael, and St. Raphael with Tobias&quot; are among the treasures of the National Gallery, London. This was succeeded in 1504–1507 by the Annunziata Altarpiece for the high altar of the Basilica dell&#x27;Annunziata in Florence, in which he replaced Filippino Lippi. The work was a failure, being accused of lack of innovation. Perugino lost his students; and toward 1506 he once more and finally, abandoned Florence, going to Perugia, and thence in a year or two to Rome.
Pope Julius II had summoned Perugino to paint the Stanza of the Incendio del Borgo in the Vatican City; but he soon preferred a younger competitor, Raphael, who had been trained by Perugino; and Vannucci, after painting the ceiling with figures of &quot;God the Father&quot; in different glories, in five medallion-subjects, retired from Rome to Perugia from 1512. Among his latest works, one of the best is the extensive altarpiece (painted between 1512 and 1517) of the church of San Agostino in Perugia, also now dispersed.

Perugino&#x27;s last frescoes were painted in the church of the Madonna delle Lacrime in Trevi (1521, signed and dated), the monastery of Sant&#x27;Agnese in Perugia, and in 1522 for the church of Castello di Fortignano. Both series have disappeared from their places, the second being now in the Victoria and Albert Museum. He was still at Fontignano in 1523 when he died of the plague. Like other plague victims, he was hastily buried in an unconsecrated field, the precise spot now unknown. Perugino died with considerable property, leaving three sons.

Vasari is the main source stating that Perugino had very little religion and openly doubted the soul&#x27;s immortality. In 1494, Lorenzo di Credi painted Perugino&#x27;s portrait, now in the Uffizi Gallery, and into it, he introduced a scroll entitled &quot;Timete Deum&quot; (Fear God: Revelation 14:7). That an open disbeliever should be inscribed with Timete Deum seems odd. The portrait in question shows a plump face, with small dark eyes, a short but well-cut nose, and sensuous lips; the neck is thick, the hair bushy and frizzled, and the general air imposing. The later portrait in the Cambio of Perugia shows the same face with traces of added years. 
In 1495, he signed and dated a &quot;Deposition&quot; for the Florentine convent of Santa Chiara (Palazzo Pitti). Toward 1496 he frescoed a crucifixion, commissioned in 1493 for Maria Maddalena de&#x27; Pazzi, Florence (the &quot;Pazzi Crucifixion&quot;). He painted the marriage of Joseph and the Virgin Mary (the &quot;Sposalizio&quot;) now in the museum of Caen, which indisputably served as the original, to a great extent, of the still more famous &quot;Sposalizio&quot; painted by Raphael in 1504 (Brera, Milan). A further work of Perugino&#x27;s was the polyptych of the &quot;Ascension of Christ&quot; painted ca 1496–98 for the church of S. Pietro of Perugia, (Municipal Museum, Lyon); the other portions of the same altarpiece are dispersed in other galleries.

In the chapel of the Disciplinati of Città della Pieve is an &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot;, a square of 6.5 m containing about thirty life-sized figures; this was executed, with scarcely credible celerity, from March 1 to 25 (or thereabouts) in 1505, and must no doubt be in great part the work of Vannucci&#x27;s pupils. In 1507 he produced the &quot;Virgin between Saint Jerome and Saint Francis&quot;, now in the Palazzo Penna. In the church of S. Onofrio in Florence is a much lauded and much debated fresco of the Last Supper, a careful and blandly correct but uninspired work; it has been ascribed to Perugino by some connoisseurs, by others to Raphael; it may more probably be by some different pupil of the Umbrian master.

Among his pupils were likely Raphael, upon whose early work Perugino&#x27;s influence is most noticeable, Pompeo Cocchi, Eusebio da San Giorgio, Mariano di Eusterio, and Giovanni di Pietro (lo Spagna).
== Monuments ==

Perugia dedicated an important monument to Perugino built in 1923 by the sculptor Enrico Quattrini and today visible in the Carducci Gardens.

<text>Sir Joseph Archer Crowe (25 October 1825, London – 6 September 1896, Gamburg an der Tauber, today Werbach, Germany) was an English journalist, consular official and art historian, whose volumes of the &quot;History of Painting in Italy&quot;, co-written with the Italian critic Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle (1819–1897), stand at the beginning of disciplined modern art history writing in English, being based on chronologies of individual artists&#x27; development and the connoisseurship of identifying artist&#x27;s individual manners or &quot;hands&quot;.

Their multi-volume &quot;A New History of Painting in Italy&quot; continued to be revised and republished until 1909, after both were dead. Though now outdated, these are still often cited by modern art historians.

==Life==

===Early life===
Crowe was born at 141 Sloane Street, London, the son of the journalist Eyre Evans Crowe and his wife Margaret Archer. Shortly after his birth the family moved to France, where Crowe&#x27;s childhood was spent, mostly in Paris, where his father was based as the correspondent of the London &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot;; his home was the centre of a liberal and artistic circle that mixed French and expatriates.

At an early age Crowe showed considerable aptitude for painting and entered the studio of Paul Delaroche in Paris, with his brother Eyre Crowe, who was to become a painter of historical genre subjects, and the friend and amanuensis of William Makepeace Thackeray.

===Journalism===
He returned to England with his father in 1843, following him into journalism as a correspondent for the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;Daily News&quot;. During the Crimean War he worked as a correspondent for the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;. On his return from the Crimea he received an offer to direct an art school in India. He went there, but when the post did not materialise he turned to journalism again, acting as a correspondent for the &quot;Times&quot; during the Indian Mutiny. Illness cut his time in India short, and he returned to England. He was a correspondent for the &quot;Times&quot; during the Austro-Italian War in 1858, and was present at the battle of Solferino.

===Diplomatic career===
Through the influence of Lord John Russell, Crowe was appointed consul-general for Saxony in 1860, and in this capacity he represented French interests at Leipzig during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. In 1872 he was appointed consul-general for Westphalia and the Rhenish Provinces in Düsseldorf and in 1880 commercial attaché to the embassies at Berlin and Vienna. In 1882 he was promoted to be commercial attaché for the whole of Europe, based in Paris. In 1883 he was secretary to the Danube Conference in London; in 1889 plenipotentiary at the Samoa Conference in Berlin and in 1890 British envoy at the Telegraph Congress in Paris. For these services he was created a C.B. on 14 March 1885, and K.C.M.G on 21 May 1890.

===Art historical writing===
In 1846, at the suggestion of his father, Crowe began to collect materials for a history of the early Flemish painters. The next year, while travelling between Berlin and Vienna, Crowe made a chance acquaintance with a young Italian art student, Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle. This acquaintance was renewed later, and cemented into friendship in London, where Cavalcaselle had fled as a political refugee. They decided to collaborate on the work on Flemish painters, which Crowe had in hand. They visited collections and searched manuscripts together, and no detail was decided until it had been fully debated between them. The text itself was written by Crowe. They went on to collaborate on histories of Italian painting, and monographs on Titian and Raphael.

===Family===
Crowe married Asta von Barby (c.1841-1908), daughter of Baron Gustav von Barby and Eveline von Ribbentrop, in Gotha, Germany, 11 April 1861. They had three sons, including Sir Eyre Crowe and four daughters.

===Death===
He died at Schloss Gamburg in Franconia on 6 September 1896.

==Publications==
With Cavacaselle:
*
*
*&quot;Titian: his Life and Times&quot; (in two volumes, 1877)
*&quot;Raphael: his Life and Works&quot; (in two volumes 1883–5)

Crowe also edited Jakob Burckhardt&#x27;s &quot;Cicerone, or Art Guide to Painting in Italy&quot; (1873-9), and Kugler&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of Painting: the German, Flemish, and Dutch Schools&quot; (1874).

In 1865 he published an autobiography, &quot;Reminiscences of Thirty-five Years of my Life&quot;.

Crowe and Cavalcaselle&#x27;s &quot;History of Painting&quot; was under revision by Crowe up to the time of his death, and then by Sandford Arthur Strong (died 1904) and Robert Langton Douglas, who brought out first and second volumes of Murray&#x27;s new six-volume edition in 1903; the third volume, edited by Langton Douglas, appeared in 1909. A reprint of the original edition, brought up to date by annotations by Edward Hutton, was published by Dent in three volumes in 1909.

<text>A tax file number (TFN) is a unique identifier issued by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) to each taxpaying entity—an individual, company, superannuation fund, partnership, or trust. Not all individuals have a TFN, and a business has both a TFN and an Australian Business Number (ABN). If a business earns income as part of carrying on its business, it may quote its ABN instead of its TFN.

The TFN was introduced initially to facilitate file tracking at the ATO, but has since been expanded to encompass income and other data matching. The TFN consists of a nine digit number, usually presented in the format &quot;nnn nnn nnn&quot;. Strict laws require that TFNs may be recorded or used only for specifically authorised tax-related purposes.

The TFN serves a purpose similar to the American Social Security number, but its use is strictly limited by law to avoid the functionality creep which has affected the US counterpart. It also serves a similar function as national insurance in the UK.

==History==
TFNs have been used by the ATO since the 1930s. 
At some point in time between 1972 and 1983 the format of tax file numbers changed. The earlier format was still in use in 1972, and the later format was in use by 1983.

Under the later format, the TFN itself was either 8 or 9 digits, with a check digit. Individuals received a 9 digit TFN and non-individuals received an 8 digit TFN. The quote of the TFN was not obligatory when, for example, lodging a tax return, though failing to quote one may delay the processing of the tax return.


In May 1988, following the demise of the Australia Card scheme, the Treasurer Paul Keating announced that the Government intended to introduce an enhanced TFN scheme, and legislation establishing the scheme was passed that year.

When the legislation was introduced in 1988 the 8 and 9 digit TFN scheme still applied. However, as the 8 digit TFNs were becoming exhausted, all new taxpayers are issued 9 digit TFNs. The numbers now do not have any embedded meaning.

==Amnesty 1988==

One implication of the enhanced system using TFNs to match interest and dividend income with tax file numbers and their corresponding entities – or absence of TFNs/corresponding entities as the case may be – was that it would be increasingly difficult to hide such income from the ATO. There was also a risk that in cases where the undisclosed past tax liabilities were large, offenders could be identified and pursued for arrears plus severe penalties (a percentage of the arrears, plus interest on the arrears). In view of the new legislation, the ATO offered an amnesty from these penalties as incentive for affected persons to amend their returns for preceding years – by including previously undeclared interest income – pay their outstanding tax – without the available penalties being imposed on the increased tax liabilities.

Between May 1988 and October 31 1988 the ATO conducted this amnesty so that taxpayers who had previously failed to fully declare passive income such as bank interest, share dividends and so forth and other non-taxpayer persons who had failed to submit income tax returns in previous years could lodge retrospective amendments to returns or lodge retrospective returns. In such cases, persons claiming relief under the amnesty became liable for outstanding income tax, but were generally excused from fines and penalties that would have been imposed in the absence of the amnesty.

The amnesty was subsequently extended beyond October 31 1988, with late enrolled amnesty participants being given until April 15 1989 to lodge amended tax returns or lodge formerly missing returns disclosing additional previously undeclared income.

In 2014 the ATO conducted a second amnesty, known as Project DOIT (Disclose Offshore Income Today). The 2014 Amnesty was directed at income overseas. The 2014 Amnesty is said to be the ATO&#x27;s last amnesty.

== Data matching ==
The primary purpose of the enhanced TFN system is to allow the ATO to collect income and other information for taxpayers (officially known as &quot;data matching&quot;). This is done by the ATO requiring paying entities (e.g., banks, employers, public companies, superannuation funds, Centrelink and others) to electronically provide the ATO with information of certain types of payments made by them, together with the associated TFN of the recipient. When taxpayers file their income tax returns at the end of the financial year, the ATO can electronically match the income reported by the taxpayer against the payments reported by the paying entities.

The types of income payments covered by the TFN data matching rules include:

* Wages and salaries from employers (see PAYG), including fringe benefit and superannuation information
* Interest from banks and similar institutions, from all account types, including term deposits
* Interest from bonds and debentures
* Dividends from public companies
* Distributions from unit trusts, including cash management trusts
* Superannuation payments (amounts paid out to a beneficiary)
* Some government benefits, in particular unemployment benefits.

Other information provided to the ATO using the TFN includes health insurance information, as well as the purchase and sale of property, such as real estate and shares.

Because of the community backlash against the aborted Australia Card scheme, the expanded TFN rules are technically optional. The taxpayer entitled to such income payments has a choice between quoting the TFN, or not doing so. As a general rule taxpayers quote their TFN. Institutions usually help by reminding or inviting clients to do so on any new source of income (e.g., new accounts, new debentures, new shareholdings). Forms for quoting include a reminder of the key provisions of the system, for example from Computershare:

: &quot;It is not an offence to withhold your TFN or, where the securities are held for a business purpose, your ABN. However, if you do not provide your TFN or ABN, tax may be deducted from payments of interest and the unfranked portion of dividends and distributions at the highest marginal rate.&quot;

If an account is held in the names of multiple investors, each may choose whether to quote or not, but tax is withheld unless at least two have done so.

==TFN withholding tax==
In the few cases that a payee has not supplied the paying entity with their TFN by the time payment is to be made, unless if the payment is exempt, the paying entity is legally required to withhold a TFN withholding tax amount at the highest marginal tax rate (currently 47%) from the payment the paying entity is about to make. Similar but stricter rules apply to businesses which do not supply their customers with an ABN.

The paying entity would report the TFN and ABN withheld amounts on its next Business Activity Statement (BAS) and add the withheld amounts to the payment it needs to make to the ATO. The paying entity would also advise the recipient of the TFN withheld amount.

The TFN withheld amount becomes a prepayment of tax by the taxpayer whose funds have been withheld. When the taxpayer files an income tax return he or she would need to claim the so-called &quot;TFN amounts&quot; against his or her final tax liability, and any excess is refunded. The taxpayer needs to file an income tax return to get back the excess of tax.

==Exemptions==
Some people and organisations are exempt from TFN withholding; they may state their exemption category instead of quoting a TFN. This includes:

* Income tax exempt organisations (e.g., schools, museums).
* Non-profit organisations.
* Recipients of government pensions who are 80 years and older.
* Children under 16 (earning up to $420 per year of interest, in 2005).
* Foreign residents for interest and dividends (they are subject to non-resident withholding tax instead).

People and organisations in these categories may still need to submit a tax return, but generally speaking these exemptions mean those not needing to submit a tax return don&#x27;t need to get a tax file number.

The exemption for children does not apply to company dividends, and if a bank account is held in more than one name, it is only exempt if all account holders are under 16. Children can apply for a TFN and quote it in the same way as anyone else, if they wish.

For some forms of income, small earnings are exempt from TFN withholding for any account holder. For example, bank interest up to $120 per year is exempt. (However such amounts are still taxable income.)

==Issuing==
TFNs are issued by the Australian Taxation Office. A new taxpayer receives a tax file number within about a month of making an application and providing proof of identity.

Centrelink helps those applying for certain benefits to apply for a TFN at the same time, if they do not already have one. For example, unemployment benefits are subject to the TFN withholding rules if a TFN is not quoted. A young person applying for such a benefit for the first time may have never previously needed a TFN.

Foreigners in Australia whose visas permit them to work can apply for a TFN online, using their passport number and visa number. Proof of identity is established by the ATO confirming those numbers with the Department of Immigration.

==Check digit==

As is the case with many identification numbers, the TFN includes a check digit for detecting erroneous numbers. The algorithm is based on simple modulo 11 arithmetic per many other digit checksum schemes.

===Example===
The validity of the example TFN &#x27;123456782&#x27; can be checked by the following process

The sum of the numbers is 253 (1 + 8 + 9 + 28 + 25 + 48 + 42 + 72 + 20 = 253). 253 is a multiple of 11 (11 × 23 = 253). Therefore, the number is valid.

<doc id="871210" wikidata="Q161195" url="?curid=871210" title="Utricularia">
<text>Utricularia, commonly and collectively called the bladderworts, is a genus of carnivorous plants consisting of approximately 233 species (precise counts differ based on classification opinions; a 2001 publication lists 215 species). They occur in fresh water and wet soil as terrestrial or aquatic species across every continent except Antarctica. &quot;Utricularia&quot; are cultivated for their flowers, which are often compared with those of snapdragons and orchids, especially amongst carnivorous plant enthusiasts.

All &quot;Utricularia&quot; are carnivorous and capture small organisms by means of bladder-like traps. Terrestrial species tend to have tiny traps that feed on minute prey such as protozoa and rotifers swimming in water-saturated soil. The traps can range in size from . Aquatic species, such as &quot;U. vulgaris&quot; (common bladderwort), possess bladders that are usually larger and can feed on more substantial prey such as water fleas &quot;(Daphnia)&quot;, nematodes and even fish fry, mosquito larvae and young tadpoles. Despite their small size, the traps are extremely sophisticated. In the active traps of the aquatic species, prey brush against trigger hairs connected to the trapdoor. The bladder, when &quot;set&quot;, is under negative pressure in relation to its environment so that when the trapdoor is mechanically triggered, the prey, along with the water surrounding it, is sucked into the bladder. Once the bladder is full of water, the door closes again, the whole process taking only ten to fifteen milliseconds.

Bladderworts are unusual and highly specialized plants, and the vegetative organs are not clearly separated into roots, leaves, and stems as in most other angiosperms. &quot;Utricularia&quot; lack a root system.
Bladder traps are recognized as one of the most sophisticated structures in the plant kingdom.

==Description==

The main part of a bladderwort plant always lies beneath the surface of its substrate. Terrestrial species sometimes produce a few photosynthetic leaf-shoots. The aquatic species can be observed below the surfaces of ponds and streams.

===Plant structure===
Most species form long, thin, sometimes branching stems or &quot;stolons&quot; beneath the surface of their substrate, whether that be pond water or dripping moss in the canopy of a tropical rainforest. To these stolons are attached both the bladder traps and photosynthetic leaf-shoots, and in terrestrial species the shoots are thrust upward through the soil into the air or along the surface.

The name &quot;bladderwort&quot; refers to the bladder-like traps. The aquatic members of the genus have the largest and most obvious bladders, and these were initially thought to be flotation devices before their carnivorous nature was discovered.

===Etymology===
The generic name &quot;Utricularia&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;utriculus&quot;, a word which has many related meanings but which most commonly means &quot;wine flask&quot;, &quot;leather bottle&quot; or &quot;bagpipe&quot;.

===Flowers===

Flowers are the only part of the plant clear of the underlying soil or water. They are usually produced at the end of thin, often vertical inflorescences. They can range in size from wide, and have two asymmetric labiate (unequal, lip-like) petals, the lower usually significantly larger than the upper. They can be of any colour, or of many colours, and are similar in structure to the flowers of a related carnivorous genus, &quot;Pinguicula&quot;.

The flowers of aquatic varieties like &quot;U. vulgaris&quot; are often described as similar to small yellow snapdragons, and the Australian species &quot;U. dichotoma&quot; can produce the effect of a field full of violets on nodding stems. The epiphytic species of South America, however, are generally considered to have the showiest, as well as the largest, flowers. It is these species that are frequently compared with orchids.

Certain plants in particular seasons might produce closed, self-pollinating (&quot;cleistogamous&quot;) flowers; but the same plant or species might produce open, insect-pollinated flowers elsewhere or at a different time of year, and with no obvious pattern. Sometimes, individual plants have both types of flower at the same time: aquatic species such as &quot;U. dimorphantha&quot; and &quot;U. geminiscapa&quot;, for example, usually have open flowers riding clear of the water and one or more closed, self-pollinating flowers beneath the water. Seeds are numerous and small and for the majority of species are long.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Utricularia&quot; can survive almost anywhere where there is fresh water for at least part of the year; only Antarctica and some oceanic islands have no native species. The greatest species diversity for the genus is seen in South America, with Australia coming a close second. In common with most carnivorous plants, they grow in moist soils which are poor in dissolved minerals, where their carnivorous nature gives them a competitive advantage; terrestrial varieties of &quot;Utricularia&quot; can frequently be found alongside representatives of the carnivorous genera–&quot;Sarracenia&quot;, &quot;Drosera&quot; and others–in very wet areas where continuously moving water removes most soluble minerals from the soil.

&quot;Utricularia&quot; has a variety of life forms, including terrestrial, lithophytic, aquatic, epiphytic, and rheophytic forms which are all highly adapted for their environments.

About 80% of the species are terrestrial, and most inhabit waterlogged or wet soils, where their tiny bladders can be permanently exposed to water in the substrate. Frequently they will be found in marshy areas where the water table is very close to the surface. Most of the terrestrial species are tropical, although they occur worldwide.

Approximately 20% of the species are aquatic. Most of these drift freely over the surface of ponds and other still, muddy-bottomed waters and only protrude above the surface when flowering, although a few species are lithophytic and adapted to rapidly moving streams or even waterfalls. The plants are usually found in acidic waters, but they are quite capable of growing in alkaline waters and would very likely do so were it not for the higher level of competition from other plants in such areas. Aquatic &quot;Utricularia&quot; are often split into two categories: suspended and affixed aquatic. Suspended aquatics are species which are not rooted into the ground and are free-floating, often found in nutrient poor sites. Conversely, fixed aquatics are species which have at least some of their shoots rooted into the ground. These plants often have dimorphic shoots, some which are leafy, green, and often bladderless which float in the water, and others which are white and coated with bladders that affix the plant to the ground. &quot;Utricularia vulgaris&quot; is an aquatic species and grows into branching rafts with individual stolons up to one metre or longer in ponds and ditches throughout Eurasia.

Some South American tropical species are epiphytes, and can be found growing in wet moss and spongy bark on trees in rainforests, or even in the watery leaf-rosettes of other epiphytes such as various &quot;Tillandsia&quot; (a type of bromeliad) species. Epiphytic &quot;Utricularia&quot; are often known for their orchid-like flowers and are the most ornamentally sought after. Rosette-forming epiphytes such as &quot;U. nelumbifolia&quot; put out runners, searching for other nearby bromeliads to colonise.

There are also a few lithophytic species which live on wet surfaces of cliffs and mossy rocks and rheophytic species which live in shallow rivers and streams.

The plants are as highly adapted in their methods of surviving seasonally inclement conditions as they are in their structure and feeding habits. Temperate perennials can require a winter period in which they die back each year, and they will weaken in cultivation if they are not given it; tropical and warm-temperate species, on the other hand, require no dormancy. Floating bladderworts in cold temperate zones such as the UK and Siberia can produce winter buds called turions at the extremities of their stems: as the autumnal light fails and growth slows down, the main plant may rot away or be killed by freezing conditions, but the turions will separate and sink to the bottom of the pond to rest beneath the coming ice until the spring, when they will return to the surface and resume growth. Many Australian species will grow only during the wet season, reducing themselves to tubers only long to wait out the dry season. Other species are annual, returning from seed each year.

=== Dispersal and life form evolution ===
The ancestral line of Utricularia is thought to have been terrestrial. From terrestrial forms, epiphytic forms evolved independently three times and aquatic life forms arose four times in genus &quot;Utricularia&quot;.

Biogeographic patterns associated with the boreotropic hypothesis lists the origin of Lentibulariaceae to temperate Eurasia or tropical America. Based on fossilised pollen and insular separation, the last common ancestor of &quot;Genlisea-Utricularia&quot; clade was found to be a South American lineage that arose 39 mya. &quot;Utricularia&quot; probably diverged from its sister genus 30 mya and subsequently dispersed to Australia, represented by &quot;subgenus Polypompholyx&quot;, and to Africa. There were most likely other transcontinental dispersals, one of which is represented by &quot;sect. Nelipus&quot;. The colonization of &quot;Utricularia&quot; to North America probably occurred 12mya from South America. The dispersal of &quot;Utricularia&quot; to Eurasia probably occurred through the Bering Strait via long-distance dispersal 4.7 mya.

==Carnivory==

===Physical description of the trap===
Authorities on the genus, such as botanists Peter Taylor and Francis Ernest Lloyd, agree that the vacuum-driven bladders of &quot;Utricularia&quot; are the most sophisticated carnivorous trapping mechanism to be found anywhere in the plant kingdom. The bladders are usually shaped similarly to broad beans (though they come in various shapes) and attach to the submerged stolons by slender stalks.

Bladders are hollow underwater suction cups, also known as utricles, that possess a valve with bristles that open and close.
The bladder walls are very thin and transparent but are sufficiently inflexible to maintain the bladder&#x27;s shape despite the vacuum created within. The entrance, or &#x27;mouth&#x27;, of the trap is a circular or oval flap whose upper half is joined to the body of the trap by very flexible, yielding cells which form an effective hinge. The door rests on a platform formed by the thickening of the bladder wall immediately underneath. A soft but substantial membrane called the &quot;velum&quot; stretches in a curve around the middle of this platform, and helps seal the door. A second band of springy cells crosses the door just above its lower edge and provides the flexibility for the bottom of the door to become a bendable &#x27;lip&#x27; which can make a perfect seal with the velum.

The outer cells of the whole trap excrete mucilage and under the door, this is produced in greater quantities and contains sugars. The mucilage certainly contributes towards the seal, and the sugars may help to attract prey.

Terrestrial species, like &quot;U. sandersonii&quot; have tiny traps (sometimes as small as 0.2 mm; 1/100&quot;) with a broad beak-like structure extending and curving down over the entrance; this forms a passageway to the trapdoor and may help prevent the trapping and ingestion of inorganic particles. Aquatic species, like &quot;U. inflata&quot; tend to have larger bladders—up to —and the mouth of the trap is usually surrounded not by a beak but by branching antennae, which serve both to guide prey animals to the trap&#x27;s entrance and to fend the trap mouth away from larger bodies which might trigger the mechanism needlessly. Epiphytic species have unbranched antennae which curve in front of the mouth and probably serve the same purpose, although it has been observed that they are also capable of holding a pocket of water in front of the mouth by capillary action, and that this assists with the trapping action.

===Trapping mechanism===
The trapping mechanism of &quot;Utricularia&quot; is purely mechanical; no reaction from the plant (irritability) is required in the presence of prey, in contrast with the triggered mechanisms employed by Venus flytraps (&quot;Dionaea&quot;), waterwheels (&quot;Aldrovanda&quot;), and many sundews (&quot;Drosera&quot;). The only active mechanism involved is the constant pumping out of water through the bladder walls by active transport.

As water is pumped out, the bladder&#x27;s walls are sucked inwards by the negative pressure created, and any dissolved material inside the bladder becomes more concentrated. The sides of the bladder bend inwards, storing potential energy like a spring. Eventually, no more water can be extracted, and the bladder trap is &#x27;fully set&#x27; (technically, osmotic pressure rather than physical pressure is the limiting factor).

Extending outwards from the bottom of the trapdoor are several long bristle-stiff protuberances that are sometimes referred to as &quot;trigger hairs&quot; or &quot;antennae&quot; but which have no similarity to the sensitive triggers found in &quot;Dionaea&quot; and &quot;Aldrovanda&quot;. In fact, these bristles are simply levers. The suction force exerted by the primed bladder on the door is resisted by the adhesion of its flexible bottom against the soft-sealing velum. The equilibrium depends quite literally on a hair trigger, and the slightest touch to one of the lever hairs will deform the flexible door lip enough to create a tiny gap, breaking the seal.

Once the seal is disturbed, the bladder walls instantly spring back to a more rounded shape; the door flies open and a column of water is sucked into the bladder. The animal which touched the lever, if small enough, is inevitably drawn in, and as soon as the trap is filled, the door resumes its closed position—the whole operation being completed in as little as one-hundredth of a second.

Once inside, the prey is dissolved by digestive secretions. This generally occurs within a few hours, although some protozoa appear to be highly resistant and have been observed to live for several days inside the trap. All the time, the trap walls continue to pump out water, and the bladder can be ready for its next capture in as little as 15 to 30 minutes.

=== Microbial relationships ===
The bladders of &quot;Utricularia&quot; often culture a mutualistic community of microbes, which may be a very important factor in digestion of prey within Utricularia. Bacteria consume dissolved organic material which is not able to be directly ingested by larger organisms. When bacteria absorb dissolved organic material, they also release nutrients, which facilitates photo-autotrophic growth. As &quot;Utricularia&quot;″s trap is sealed and contains all the needed components of a microbial food web, one can assume that much enzyme activity and available nutrients in &quot;Utricularia&quot;″s trap fluid are derived from these microbial communities.  Additionally, &quot;Utricularia&quot; traps often collect a diversity of microplankton and detritus. When this periphyton is dissolved into basic nutrients within the bladder environment, bacterial enzymes help aid in digestion. Therefore, carbon secretion and periphyton utilization in the utricles enable &quot;Utricularia&quot; to live with relatively little competition.

Mutualism could have been an important association in aquatic &quot;Utricularia&quot; trap evolution as these microbes may have allowed these plants to acquire the needed nutrients when they lost their roots, as they may have had issues acquiring phosphorus. Phosphorus was found to be the most important factor in &quot;Utricularia&quot; nutrition, which helps explain why &quot;Utricularia&quot; bladders are found with a wide diversity of bacteria to aid in phosphorus digestion.

===Enhanced respiration===
&quot;Utricularia&quot; have significantly greater respiration rates than most vegetative tissue, primarily due to their complex energy-dependent traps. Upon triggering, prey is captured through a two-step ATP-driven ion-pumping process where organisms are sucked in by internal negative pressure achieved by pumping water out of the trap and into the external environment. Recent research suggests that COX subunit I (COX1), a rate limiting enzyme in the cellular respiration pathway associated with the synthesis of ATP, has evolved under positive Darwinian selection in the &quot;Utricularia&quot;–&quot;Genlisea&quot; clade. There appear to be adaptive substitutions of two contiguous cysteines (C-C motif) at the docking point of COX1 helix 3 and cytochrome c. This C-C motif, absent in ~99.9% of databased Eukaryota, Archaea, and Bacteria, suggests a conformational change that might decouple electron transport from proton pumping. By doing so, the intermembrane space could sequester protons are store them until the ATP is needed. Such decoupling would allow &quot;Utricularia&quot; to optimize power output (energy × rate) during times of need, albeit with a 20% cost in energy efficiency.

According to the ROS mutation hypothesis, the sequestration of these protons has cellular consequences, which could lead to nucleotide substitutions. Oxidative phosphorylation is an imperfect process, which allows electrons to leak into the lumen, and only partially reduce oxygen. This partially reduced oxygen is a reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can be very harmful, unlike its fully reduced counterpart, the water molecule. When there is greater potential change between the lumen and intermembrane space, the leakiness of the electron transport chain also increases, therefore creating a higher production of ROS in the mitochondria of &quot;Utricularia&quot;. ROS is harmful to cells, as it produces damage to nucleotides and helical DNA. Therefore, the increased cellular respiration of &quot;Utricularia&quot; bladders combined with the unique sequestration of protons could lead to its high nucleotide substitution rates, and therefore its wide diversity.

This structural evolution seems highly unlikely to have arisen by chance alone; therefore, many researchers suggest this key adaption in &quot;Utricularia&quot; allowed for radical morphological evolution of relatively simple trap structures to highly complex and efficient snares. This adaptation may have enhanced the genus&#x27; fitness by increasing its range of prey, rate of capture, and retention of nutrients during prey decomposition.

===Lloyd&#x27;s experiments===
In the 1940s, Francis Ernest Lloyd conducted extensive experiments with carnivorous plants, including &quot;Utricularia&quot;, and settled many points which had previously been the subject of conjecture. He proved that the mechanism of the trap was purely mechanical by both killing the trigger hairs with iodine and subsequently showing that the response was unaffected, and by demonstrating that the trap could be made ready to spring a second (or third) time immediately after being set off if the bladder&#x27;s excretion of water were helped by a gentle squeeze; in other words, the delay of at least fifteen minutes between trap springings is due solely to the time needed to excrete water, and the triggers need no time to recover irritability (unlike the reactive trigger hairs of Venus Flytraps, for example).

He tested the role of the velum by showing that the trap will never set if small cuts are made to it; and showed that the excretion of water can be continued under all conditions likely to be found in the natural environment, but can be prevented by driving the osmotic pressure in the trap beyond normal limits by the introduction of glycerine.

===Ingestion of larger prey===
Lloyd devoted several studies to the possibility, often recounted but never previously accounted for under scientific conditions, that &quot;Utricularia&quot; can consume larger prey such as young tadpoles and mosquito larvae by catching them by the tail, and ingesting them bit by bit.

Prior to Lloyd, several authors had reported this phenomenon and had attempted to explain it by positing that creatures caught by the tail repeatedly set off the trap as they thrash about in an attempt to escape—even as their tails are actively digested by the plant. Lloyd, however, demonstrated that the plant is quite capable of ingestion by stages without the need of multiple stimuli.

He produced suitable artificial &quot;prey&quot; for his experiments by stirring albumen (egg white) into hot water and selecting shreds of an appropriate length and thickness. When caught by one end, the strand would gradually be drawn in, sometimes in sudden jumps, and at other times by a slow and continuous motion. Strands of albumen would often be fully ingested in as little as twenty minutes.

Mosquito larvae, caught by the tail, would be engulfed bit by bit. A typical example given by Lloyd showed that a larva of a size at the upper limit of what the trap could manage would be ingested stage by stage over the course of about twenty-four hours; but that the head, being rigid, would often prove too large for the mouth of the trap and would remain outside, plugging the door. When this happened, the trap evidently formed an effective seal with the head of the larva as it could still excrete water and become flattened, but it would nevertheless die within about ten days &quot;evidently due to overfeeding&quot;.

Softer-bodied prey of the same size such as small tadpoles could be ingested completely, because they have no rigid parts and the head, although capable of plugging the door for a time, will soften and yield and finally be drawn in.

Very thin strands of albumen could be soft and fine enough to allow the trapdoor to close completely; these would not be drawn in any further unless the trigger hairs were indeed stimulated again. On the other hand, a human hair, finer still but relatively hard and unyielding, could prevent a seal being formed; these would prevent the trap from resetting at all due to leakage of water.

Lloyd concluded that the sucking action produced by the excretion of water from the bladder was sufficient to draw larger soft-bodied prey into the trap without the need for a second or further touch to the trigger levers. An animal long enough not to be fully engulfed upon first springing the trap, but thin and soft enough to allow the door to return fully to its set position, would indeed be left partly outside the trap until it or another body triggered the mechanism once again. However, the capture of hard bodies not fully drawn into the trap would prevent its further operation.

==Genetics==
Chris Whitewoods has developed a computational model of possible genetic regulation in &quot;Utricularia gibba&quot; to show how genes may control the formation of the upper and lower surfaces of flat leaves and how cup-shaped traps may have evolved from flat leaves. Changes in the gene expression of &quot;Utricularia&quot; can explain these structural changes. &quot;U. gibba&quot; leaves appear similar early in development but may develop into either a spherical trap or a cylindrical leaflet at later stages. Directional expansion of the leaf is suggested to be a crucial driver of the trap&#x27;s morphogenesis. The upper and lower faces of the leaf are differentially associated with genetic markers. The marker UgPHV1 is associated with the upper leaf face. Trap primordia become spherical in shape, due to growth in both the longitudinal and transverse directions, when UgPHV1 / PHAVOLUTA (PHV) is restricted. Expression of UgPHV1 inhibits trap development and leads to the formation of leaflets. The same model can be used to describe shape development of other leaf shapes, including the pitcher-shaped &quot;Sarracenia&quot; trap, in terms of the spatial regulation of gene expression.

Increased respiration rates caused by mutated COXI may have caused two additional traits in the &quot;Utricularia–Genlisea&quot; clade: i) greatly increased rates of nucleotide substitution and ii) a dynamic decrease of genome size, including &quot;Utricularia&quot; species with some of the smallest haploid angiosperm genomes known. A recent study conducted three cDNA libraries from different organs of &quot;U. gibba&quot; (~80Mb) as part of a large scale &quot;Utricularia&quot; nuclear genome sequencing project. They recorded increased nucleotide substitution rates in chloroplast, mitochondrial, and cellular genomes. They also recorded increased levels of DNA repair-associated proteins and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-detox. ROS is a product of cellular metabolism that can potentially cause cellular damage when accumulated in high amounts. They determined the expression of DNA repair and ROS detox was ubiquitous rather than trap-specific. Due to this ubiquitous expression, relative ROS detoxification is expected to be lower in trap structures due to the high respiratory rate caused by trap activations, eventually leading to higher toxic effects and mutagenesis. Mutagenic action of enhanced ROS production may explain both high rates of nucleotide substitution and the dynamic evolution of genome size (via double strand breaks).

The dramatic shift in genome size and high mutation rates may have allowed for the variations observed in &quot;Utricularia&quot; bladder size, root structure, and relaxed body formation. Overall, the introduction of mutated COXI and high mutation rates provide a strong evolutionary hypothesis for the variability found in &quot;Utricularia&quot; species.

== Species ==
&quot;Utricularia&quot; is the largest genus of carnivorous plants. It is one of the three genera that make up the Bladderwort family (Lentibulariaceae), along with the butterworts &quot;(Pinguicula)&quot; and corkscrew plants &quot;(Genlisea)&quot;.

This genus was considered to have 250 species until Peter Taylor reduced the number to 214 in his exhaustive study &quot;The genus Utricularia – a taxonomic monograph&quot;, published by Her Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office in 1989. Taylor&#x27;s classification is now generally accepted with modifications based on phylogenetic studies (see below).

The genus Polypompholyx, the pink petticoats, contained just two species of carnivorous plant, &quot;Polypompholyx tenella&quot; and &quot;Polypompholyx multifida&quot;, previously distinguished from the otherwise similar genus &quot;Utricularia&quot; by their possession of four calyx lobes rather than two. The genus has now been subsumed into &quot;Utricularia&quot;.

The genus Biovularia contained the species &quot;Biovularia olivacea&quot; (also known as &quot;B. brasiliensis&quot; or &quot;B. minima&quot;) and &quot;Biovularia cymbantha&quot;. The genus has been subsumed into &quot;Utricularia&quot;.

==Phylogenetics==

The following cladogram shows the relationship between various subgenera and sections. It summarizes the results of two studies (Jobson et al. 2003; Müller et al. 2004), following Müller et al. 2006. Since the sections &quot;Aranella&quot; and &quot;Vesiculina&quot; are polyphyletic, they show up multiple times in the cladogram (*). Some monotypic sections have not been included in the study, so that their place in this system is unclear. Sections that are not included below are &quot;Candollea&quot;, &quot;Chelidon&quot;, &quot;Choristothecae&quot;, &quot;Kamienskia&quot;, &quot;Martinia&quot;, &quot;Meionula&quot;, &quot;Mirabiles&quot;, &quot;Oliveria&quot;, &quot;Setiscapella&quot;, &quot;Sprucea&quot;, &quot;Steyermarkia&quot;, and &quot;Stylotheca&quot; in subgenus &quot;Utricularia&quot;; &quot;Minutae&quot; in subgenus &quot;Bivalvaria&quot;; and &quot;Tridentaria&quot; in subgenus &quot;Polypompholyx&quot;.

<text>Eyre Evans Crowe (1799February 25, 1868) was an English journalist and historian.

==Life==
The son of an Army officer of Anglo-Irish ancestry, Crowe was born in Southampton and educated at Trinity College, Dublin. In the 1820s he turned to writing novels: V&quot;ittoria Colonna, To-Day in Ireland&quot; (1825), &quot;The English in Italy&quot; (1825), &quot;Yesterday in Ireland&quot; (1829), and &quot;The English at Home&quot; (1830). In the early 1820s he became a regular contributor to &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. Alongside American John Neal, he was one of two to exhibit the publisher&#x27;s desired style notably well. Crowe commenced his work as a writer for the London newspaper press as Paris correspondent for the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; in 1832, and he afterwards became a leading contributor to &quot;The Examiner&quot; and the &quot;Daily News&quot;. Of the latter journal he was principal editor for some time previous to his death.

The department he specially cultivated was that of continental history and foreign politics. He published &quot;Lives of Foreign Statesmen&quot; (1830), &quot;The Greek and the Turk&quot; (1853), and &quot;Reigns of Louis XVIII. and Charles X.&quot; (1854). These were followed by his most important work, the &quot;History of France&quot; (5 vols., 1858–1868). It was founded upon original sources, in order to consult which the author resided for a considerable time in Paris.

==Family==
Among his children were Eyre Crowe (1824–1910), Sir Joseph Archer Crowe (1825–1896), and George Crowe (1840–1889), husband of the actress Kate Bateman.

<text>Fiorenzo di Lorenzo ( 1440 – 1522) was an Italian painter, of the Umbrian school. He lived and worked at Perugia, where most of his authentic works are still preserved in the Galleria Nazionale dell&#x27;Umbria.

Fiorenzo is known from a few signed works, including the &quot;Madonna of the Recommended&quot; (1476) and a niche with lunette, two wings and predella (1487), as well as from the documentary evidence that he was decemvir of that city in 1472, in which year he entered into a contract to paint an altarpiece for the church of Santa Maria Nuova, the pentatych of the &quot;Madonna and Saints&quot;.

Of his birth and death and pupilage nothing is known. Renaissance art biographer Giorgio Vasari does not even mention Fiorenzo&#x27;s name, though he probably refers to him when he says that Cristofano, Perugino&#x27;s father, sent his son to be the shop drudge of a painter in Perugia, who was not particularly distinguished in his calling, but held the art in great veneration and highly honoured the men who excelled therein. Certain it is that the early works both of Perugino and of Pinturicchio show certain mannerisms which point towards Fiorenzo&#x27;s influence, if not to his direct teaching.

The list of some fifty pictures which modern critics have ascribed to Fiorenzo includes works of such widely varied character that the scholars&#x27; suggestions of the masters under whom Fiorenzo is supposed to have studied varies. Pisanello, Verrocchio, Benozzo Gozzoli, Antonio del Pollaiuolo, Benedetto Bonfigli, Andrea Mantegna, Francesco Squarcione, Filippo Lippi, Luca Signorelli and Domenico Ghirlandaio have all been mentioned.

<text>Osteophytes are exostoses (bony projections) that form along joint margins. They should not be confused with enthesophytes, which are bony projections that form at the attachment of a tendon or ligament. Osteophytes are not always distinguished from exostoses in any definite way, although in many cases there are a number of differences. Osteophytes are typically intra-articular (within the joint capsule).

==Cause==

A range of bone-formation processes are associated with aging, degeneration, mechanical instability, and disease (such as diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis). Osteophyte formation has classically been related to sequential and consequential changes in such processes. Often osteophytes form in osteoarthritic joints as a result of damage and wear from inflammation. Calcification and new bone formation can also occur in response to mechanical damage in joints.

Osteophytes form naturally on the back of the spine as a person ages and are a clinical sign of degeneration in the spine. In this case, the osteophytes are commonly not the source of back pains, but instead are a sign of an underlying problem. However, osteophytes on the spine can impinge on nerves that leave the spine for other parts of the body. This impingement can cause pain in both upper and lower limbs and a numbness or tingling sensations in the hands and feet because the nerves are supplying sensation to their dermatomes.

Osteophytes on the fingers or toes are known as Heberden&#x27;s nodes (if on the distal interphalangeal joint) or Bouchard&#x27;s nodes (if on the proximal interphalangeal joints).

==Treatments==
Normally, asymptomatic cases are not treated. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and surgery are two typical options for cases requiring treatment.

<doc id="871217" wikidata="Q311082" url="?curid=871217" title="Pisanello">
<text>Pisanello (), born Antonio di Puccio Pisano or Antonio di Puccio da Cereto, also erroneously called Vittore Pisano by Giorgio Vasari, was one of the most distinguished painters of the early Italian Renaissance and Quattrocento. He was acclaimed by poets such as Guarino da Verona and praised by humanists of his time, who compared him to such illustrious names as Cimabue, Phidias and Praxiteles.

Pisanello is known for his resplendent frescoes in large murals, elegant portraits, small easel pictures, and many brilliant drawings such as those in the Codex Vallardi (Louvre). He is the most important commemorative portrait medallist in the first half of the 15th century, and he can claim to have originated this important genre.

He was employed by the Doge of Venice, the Pope in the Vatican and the courts of Verona, Ferrara, Mantua, Milan, Rimini, and by the King of Naples. He stood in high esteem in the Gonzaga and Este families.

Pisanello had many of his works wrongly ascribed to other artists such as Piero della Francesca, Albrecht Dürer and Leonardo da Vinci, to name a few. While most of his paintings have perished, a good many of his drawings and medals have survived.

==Early life==

Pisanello&#x27;s life is somewhat shrouded in mystery. He was born between 1380 and 1395 and died between 1450 and 1455 (probably between 14 July and 8 October 1455). He was a native of Pisa but spent his early years in San Vigilio sul Lago in the territory of Verona. He was probably given his early training by a Veronese painter (perhaps Altichiero or Stefano da Verona) as his early style is in the tradition of Veronese painting.

==Training==
Between 1415 and 1420, Pisanello was the assistant of the renowned painter and illuminator Gentile da Fabriano from whom he acquired his refined, delicate, detailed style. Pisanello also acquired from him a taste for precious materials and beautiful fabrics that can be found in his later paintings. The frescoes in the Doge&#x27;s Palace at Venice, on which they worked together, have perished as well as the frescoes in the Basilica of St. John Lateran and the palaces of Mantua and Pavia.

In 1422, Pisanello was reported to be in Mantua in the service of young Ludovico Gonzaga, son of the Marchese of Mantua Gianfrancesco Gonzaga. He continued to work for the Gonzaga family till the 1440s.

Giorgio Vasari, an artist and biographer of the Italian Renaissance, states that Pisanello also worked in the workshop of Andrea del Castagno, author of the painted equestrian monument of Niccolò da Tolentino (1456) in the Cathedral in Florence. He must also have known Paolo Uccello, the painter of the Battle of San Romano with its many horses. Pisanello&#x27;s love of drawing horses probably finds its origin in this relationship; but as there is so much unknown of his life, this attribution by Vasari is not reliable and may only be a legend.
Pisanello&#x27;s &quot;Madonna of the Quail&quot;, now in the Museo di Castelvecchio in Verona, is signed by &quot;Antonius Pisanus&quot;. It is tentatively dated at . The style is a blend of the styles of Gentile da Fabriano and Stefano da Verona. This might show that Pisanello was also a pupil of the latter in Verona.

Pisanello stayed again in Verona in 1424. However, according to some scholars, he painted frescoes about hunting and fishing and jousts in Pavia the same year. These were commissioned by the Duke of Milan Filippo Maria Visconti. There is no trace of these frescoes left.

Back in Mantua with the Gonzagas between 1424 and 1426, Pisanello painted one of his important surviving works: the fresco &quot;Annunciation&quot; in San Fermo, Verona. It was used to embellish the funeral monument of Nicolò di Brenzoni by the Florentine sculptor Nanni di Bartolo.

When Gentile da Fabriano died in Rome between August and October 1427, his work at the Basilica of St. John Lateran was unfinished. Pisanello completed the frescoes of his former master between 1431 and 1432. All these frescoes were destroyed when the basilica was rebuilt in the 17th century by Francesco Borromini. The Kupferstichkabinet in Berlin has a pale sketch of this fresco, drawn by Borromini. While in Rome, he became more and more influenced by the classical style of Renaissance art.

==Style==
Pisanello&#x27;s drawings are generally prized as jewels of the quattrocento, and provide evidence of the elegant garb of the time, including spectacular hats. In contrast with his contemporaries, his drawings are not drafts for future paintings but are autonomous works of art. He compiled several books of drawings, detailed and accurate studies of fauna and flora drawn with poetic naturalism, and elegant costumes.

==Nobility==
Pisanello travelled to several Italian cities and was introduced to a number of courts. He stayed for a while in Florence. In this period he painted two important portraits: &quot;Emperor Sigismund&quot;, now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (but the attribution is still contested) and &quot;Portrait of a Man&quot; (now in the Palazzo Rosso, Genoa).

Pisanello returned to Verona between 1433 and 1438. His fresco masterpiece from this period is &quot;Saint George and the Princess of Trebizond&quot; () at the Pellegrini Chapel, church of Sant&#x27;Anastasia, Verona. It had to be restored after water seepage badly damaged the fresco at the end of the 19th century. He prepared for this painting with a large number of drawings, many of which are on display in the Louvre Museum, Paris.

== Portraits and medal making ==

From 1435, Pisanello became more and more interested in portraiture and medal making. He was introduced to Leonello d&#x27;Este, Marquess of Ferrara. His famous &quot;Portrait of an Este Princess&quot; dates from this period.

Pisanello was one of the greatest medalists of all time, perhaps the greatest ever, as evidenced by art historians such as Federico Zeri. He was the first to reinvent the genre as we still understand it today: a portrait on the front and a symbolic feat on the reverse.

The medals of the lords of the Italian courts (Gonzaga, Este, Malatesta, Crown of Aragon, etc.) had an extraordinary success, thanks to the perfectly balanced combination of idealization and realism. The powerful people of his time were depicted in profile on the front, as in Roman coins, while on the reverse there were allegorical scenes or highly evocative symbolic figures. All this was often correlated by mottos, symbols and various attributes, according to a cultured, concise and never rhetorical celebratory program, which makes each specimen a true masterpiece.

Pisanello&#x27;s &quot;The Vision of Saint Eustace&quot;, now at the National Gallery in London, long ascribed to Albrecht Dürer because of its perfection of this very fine panel, shows most animals in profile or defined poses with miniature-like delicacy. The story in this small painting (egg tempera on wood) is probably only a pretext for showing &quot;noble&quot; animals (horses, hunting dogs, stag, bear...) and the noblest creature of all: the hunting courtier.

In 1439, the Council of Florence negotiated with the Byzantine Emperor John VIII Palaiologos. On this occasion, Pisanello struck a commemorative medal of the emperor, the earliest portrait medal of post-classical times. He also made some drawings with portraits of the emperor and his retinue (Louvre and Chicago), suggesting he had a commission for a painting or fresco for the Este residence.

Pisanello thus became the inventor of the fields of portrait medals and related medallic art. During his lifetime Pisanello was best known for his medals. He has been copied many times in later generations. The medalist art declined when it deviated from the art of Pisanello. Before him, the few medals made were struck like minted coins. Pisanello, on the other hand, melted his medals the same as a bronze low-relief, clearly showing the work of a painter and a modeller. He even signed his medals with &quot;Opus Pisani pictoris&quot; (made by the painter Pisano). In his view, the portraits in his medals equal the portraits in his paintings. He even adds allegories at the reverse of his medals, such as the unicorn in the Cecilia Gonzaga medal, underlying the noble character of the princess.

==Political unrest==
In 1438, a war broke out between the ruler of Milan Filippo Maria Visconti and the republic of Venice. Pisanello was in Mantua with Gianfancresco Gonzaga. They decided to play a part in the capture of Verona. Consequently, the Venetian government called him a rebel and threatened him with a stiff sentence. Only an intercession by a powerful friend could preserve him.

After a stay in Milan between 1440 and 1441, Pisanello went back to Ferrara in 1441. There he painted his acclaimed portrait of Lionello d&#x27;Este, now on display at the Accademia Carrara, Bergamo. His &quot;Madonna and Child with Two Saints&quot; (National Gallery, London) probably dated from the same period. The impressive fresco cycle &quot;Scenes of War and Chivalry&quot; in the Palazzo Ducale di Mantova, Mantua probably dates from 1447.

==Later life==
From December 1448 until the end of his life he lived in Naples, where he enjoyed great repute at the Aragon court. The poet Porcellio even wrote an ode in his honour. He may have lived five or six years longer, but there is no more mention of him in the records.

==Legacy==
Specimens of Pisanello&#x27;s work as a painter still exist in Rome, Venice, Verona, Pistoia and two in the National Gallery, London (&quot;The Vision of Saint Eustace&quot; and &quot;The Virgin and Child with Saint George and Saint Anthony Abbot&quot;). Many of his drawings can now be found at the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, Italy and the Louvre, Paris.

Pisanello influenced many of his contemporaries, but he did not create his own school. His genius shone briefly and after his death, he was quickly forgotten in the rise of the humanistic and classical culture of the Renaissance. He is now considered the last and most magnificent artist of the courtly style of the Gothic art in the 15th century, called the International Gothic style. On the other hand, he may also be considered as one of the first leaders of the Renaissance movement.

<text>Valentín Toribio Demetrio Agustin Paniagua Corazao (23 September 1936 – 16 October 2006) was a Peruvian lawyer and politician who briefly served as 55th President of Peru from 2000 to 2001. Elected President of Congress on 16 November 2000, he ascended to the presidency as incumbent Alberto Fujimori and both his Vice Presidents resigned by 22 November 2000.

Due to Fujimori shortening his presidential term in order to expire on 28 July 2001, Paniagua&#x27;s main task was to oversee the new elections. Paniagua was a longtime member of Popular Action, serving as Secretary General and Party President.

==Early life and education==
Paniagua&#x27;s father was born in Bolivia but lived most of his life in Peru. Valentín Paniagua was born in Cusco and attended high school at Salesian School of Cusco. He went on to study law at the Universidad Nacional San Antonio Abad in Cusco, and subsequently transferred to the Universidad Mayor de San Marcos in Lima, where he completed his law degree. In the following years, he worked in his private practice as a lawyer and started a political career. In addition, he completed a master&#x27;s degree in political science at the University of Indiana.

In August 1955, as a student leader, he was one of the founders of the &quot;Frente Universitario Reformista Independiente&quot;, a social-Christian reform organization, opposed to landowners&#x27; rights, to the communists and to the APRA. Paniagua became a member of the Christian Democrat Party (PDC), which was best aligned to his Roman Catholic and reformist ideals.

==Political career==
In June 1963 he was elected to Congress as a representative for Cusco in the joint list of Acción Popular (AP) and PDC, an alliance that catapulted the leader of AP, Fernando Belaúnde, to the presidency of the country. Despite Paniagua&#x27;s youth, Belaúnde appointed him Minister of Justice and Cult in his first government.

In 1966, a section of the PDC led by the then-mayor of Lima, Luis Bedoya Reyes, cut ties with the leadership of Héctor Cornejo Chávez and founded the Partido Popular Cristiano (PPC). However, Paniagua remained in the ranks of the government.

The coup d&#x27;état of General Juan Velasco Alvarado on 3 October 1968, sent Paniagua out of Congress and for some years he was left out of politics. His loyalty to the constitutional legality of Belaúnde led him to abandon the PDC on 27 July 1974, in protest of its acceptance of the military government. Some time later, he became a member of AP, and kept on a civil protest against Velasco and his 1975 successor, General Francisco Morales-Bermúdez.

In the elections of 18 May 1980, he was re-elected to Congress, and his party boss, Belaúnde, won his second presidency.

In July 1982, after being part of the Constitutional Commission of the Chamber of Deputies, he became President of the Chamber of Deputies.

On 10 May 1985, he became Minister of Education. In October of that year, he resigned to return to his parliamentary activities. He was given the Orden del Sol in the Gran Cruz grade.

The defeat of AP in the 14 April 1985 elections and arrival to power of Alan García&#x27;s APRA sent Paniagua to the opposition. Over the following five years he remained a strong foe of the government and worked as a prestigious lawyer in academic and political circles, as well as a professor of constitutional law at the universities of San Marcos, Femenina del Sagrado Corazón and Pontificia Católica.

In the national elections of 1990, together with most of Acción Popular, Paniagua supported the candidacy of Mario Vargas Llosa for president. When Alberto Fujimori was elected President, Paniagua was part of the opposition, but became a strong opponent after Fujimori&#x27;s auto-coup in April 1992.

==Presidency (2000–2001)==
Fujimori was reelected once again in the controversial national elections of 2000. Paniagua was a prominent member of the opposition.

On 14 September the nation was rocked by evidence that Fujimori&#x27;s security chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, had bribed an opposition congressman to switch to Fujimori&#x27;s party, Perú 2000. Fujimori&#x27;s support evaporated at this point, and he was forced to announce he would step down after new presidential elections in 2001. An OAS mission was sent to deal with the political crisis.

Fujimori&#x27;s allies lost control of Congress after numerous defections to the opposition. On 15 November 2000, a majority of the Congress dismissed the acting President of the Peruvian Congress, a Fujimori supporter. After an internal discussion among the political forces, Paniagua was elected the new President of the Peruvian Congress. He was elected because all parties considered him to have a fair but strong character, needed in such times of crisis.
A few days later, Fujimori submitted his resignation by fax. However, Congress voted 62-9 to reject Fujimori&#x27;s resignation and remove him from office on grounds that he was &quot;permanently morally unfit.&quot; According to the line of succession, First Vice President Francisco Tudela should have succeeded to the presidency, but he had also resigned a few days before after breaking with Fujimori. Second Vice President Ricardo Márquez then claimed the presidency. However, Congress refused to recognize him since he was one of the few who were still loyal to Fujimori. When it became apparent that Congress would not allow Márquez to take office, he resigned as well. Therefore, since the President of Congress stood third in the line of succession, Paniagua became acting president.

Paniagua formed a &quot;Unity and National Reconciliation Government&quot; that received the support of almost all the political parties of the time. He then proceeded to form a broad-based cabinet, which involved non-partisan technologists and low-profile politicians. It was headed by former UN Secretary General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar as Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, who was chosen to avoid the increasing political pressure from the different political parties. He also dismissed the remaining military commanders who had had any type of involvement with or political connection to Montesinos.

Paniagua had to work with Fujimori&#x27;s Peru 2000 party in Congress, since it still was the most important political organization (even though it no longer had a majority). Additionally, during most of his period, an important number of the infamous &quot;Vladivideos&quot; were published and investigated, since most of them recorded acts of corruption involving politicians, members of the clergy and important businessmen.

Paniagua was also involved in the repeal of much of the anti-terrorist legislation enforced by Fujimori, which included trials by faceless judges and juries. This allowed the re-trial of several members of Shining Path, who were already in prison, in civilian courts instead of military ones. Paniagua also established a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate the internal conflict in Peru.

==Post-presidency (2001–2006)==
===Later political career===
When his time as President of the Republic came to an end, he transferred the government to the democratically elected president and winner of the national elections of 2001, Alejandro Toledo. In the same year, he was elected Secretary General of Acción Popular, replacing the long-time leader Fernando Belaúnde as the national leader of the political organization.

For a brief period of time, it was speculated that the Peruvian government would support his candidacy for Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS) in the 2005 Secretary General election. He declined this in order to participate in the 2006 election, as Frente de Centro&#x27;s presidential candidate in an unsuccessful campaign, in which he came in fifth place, receiving 5.75% of the vote.

He became a member of the Club of Madrid .

===Death===
On 21 August 2006, he fell seriously ill and was hospitalized for a week with a respiratory infection. A congressman wrongly reported that he had died and Congress observed a moment of silence in his honor, but he had not died and his health had in fact improved. However, in early October 2006, the country learned from a medical spokesperson that Mr. Paniagua&#x27;s condition had not improved significantly.

Valentín Paniagua died in the early hours of 16 October 2006 in a hospital in Lima at the age of 70.

<doc id="871225" wikidata="Q596158" url="?curid=871225" title="Genlisea">
<text>Genlisea ( ) is a genus of carnivorous plants also known as corkscrew plants. The 30 or so species grow in wet terrestrial to semi-aquatic environments distributed throughout Africa and Central and South America. The plants use highly modified underground leaves to attract, trap and digest minute microfauna, particularly protozoans. Although suggested a century earlier by Charles Darwin, carnivory in the genus was not proven until 1998.

The generic name &quot;Genlisea&quot; honors the French writer and educator Stéphanie Félicité Ducrest de St-Albin, comtesse de Genlis.

Several species in the genus, including &quot;G. margaretae&quot;, &quot;G. aurea&quot;, and &quot;G. tuberosa&quot;, possess the smallest known genomes of all flowering plants.

As stated, &quot;Genlisea&quot; has a wide range of genetic diversity which can be shown in various phenotypic traits. For example, &quot;G. tuberosa&quot; develops tubers, one to three occurring per plant. This allows for carbohydrate and water storage as it is found in areas prone to fire. Other species present with a thickened stolon.

==Description==

&quot;Genlisea&quot; are small herbs, growing from a slender rhizome and bearing two morphologically distinct leaf typesphotosynthetic foliage leaves aboveground and highly modified subterranean leaves used to trap prey. The plants lack roots, although the subterranean traps perform many of the functions normally performed by roots, such as anchorage and absorption of water and nutrients.

Several to many flowers are held by a slender, erect, and often tall inflorescence. As in other members of the bladderwort family, the corolla is fused into a bilobed tube tapering to a spur, with the lower lip of the corolla having three lobes. The calyx is five-lobed, in contrast to &quot;Utricularia&#x27;s&quot; three-lobed calyx. Corolla colors are generally yellow or violet to mauve, although a few species are white or cream. The lower lip forms a palate that functions as the guide to the spur that contains the nectar by providing olfactory and mechanical stimuli for nearby pollinators like bees and flies. At a microscopic level, the palate has glandular trichomes, which are small hairs that store and secrete secondary metabolites in order to provide protection from herbivory. The glandular trichomes contain no nectar secretion, suggesting that they are scent glands. These above ground structures are not shown to be directly participating in carnivorous activities.

Depending on species, the photosynthetic leaves are linear to spatulate in shape and 0.5–5 cm (–2 in) in length.

The subterranean traps are white, lacking chlorophyll or any other pigmentation. They consist of a cylindrical stalk, widening at some distance below the surface into a hollow bulb-like utricle, and continuing as a hollow cylinder some further distance. At this point the stalk into two furrowed spirals, between which the cylinder opening acts as the trap entrance. The furrows of the spiraled trap arms are lined with hairs pointing inward and toward the bifurcation. The hollow cylinder section leading from the bifurcation to the utricle is likewise lined with upward-pointing curved hairs. Some species produce two trap forms, one shorter and one longer, which probably target different prey groups. These corkscrew-like structures passively capture protozoa and other metazoa. Since these traps occur in soil, they are continuously stimulated due to the vast microfauna found in the soil. Due to continuous stimulation, the plant actively secretes digestive enzymes in order to aid with digestion to gain more nitrogen, phosphorus, and other minerals. Phosphatase has been detected in all types of glands, allowing for the breakdown of prey and uptake of phosphorus in low-nutrient soils. Although not completely understood, the oxygen concentration inside &quot;Genlisea&quot; traps is negligible. For this reason, it is thought that anoxic conditions could be the mechanisms in which prey are killed. At the same time, anaerobic bacteria survive.

==Taxonomy==
Twenty-nine species are currently recognised in the genus. Two varieties are also considered valid: &quot;G. aurea&quot; var. &quot;minor&quot; and the autonymous &quot;G. aurea&quot; var. &quot;aurea&quot;. Intraspecific determination depends almost wholly upon the inflorescence, particularly upon the indumentum. Genetic variation is an interesting area of attention as it has an incredible high rate of nucleotide substitution rates across nucleus, chloroplast, and mitochondria when compared to other angiosperms. Due to a mutation leading to changes in phenotypic traits found in the mitochondria, reactive oxygen species are produced which ultimately lead to DNA damage and further mutations.

==Botanical history==
The genus was discovered by Augustin François César Prouvençal de Saint-Hilaire, who in 1833 described four species: &quot;G. aurea&quot;, &quot;G. filiformis&quot;, &quot;G. pygmaea&quot;, and &quot;G. violacea&quot;.

==Genome size range==
The genus has a 25-fold range in genome size among its species and notably includes some of the smallest known plant genomes. For example, the genome of &quot;G. nigrocaulis&quot; is 86 Mbp (1C; 2n = 40) while that of its close relative &quot;G. hispidula&quot; (1C; 2n = 40) is 1550 Mbp, 18-fold larger. More than one genome size has been measured in &quot;G. aurea&quot; and &quot;G. repens&quot;, suggesting that di- and tetraploid individuals exist.

== Host–microbiome interactions ==
&quot;Genlisea&quot; traps host a microbe community of bacteria (dominant species consisting of anaerobic &quot;Clostridium&quot; sp. and pectolytic &quot;Dickeya&quot; sp.), green algae, microbial fungi, protists of SAR group, and minute metazoans. Through extensive research, the trap&#x27;s bacterial community has been discovered as serving the ecological importance of being prey due to &quot;Genlisea&quot; plants relying on the digestive enzymatic systems from microbes in order to aid their own carnivorous digestion.

<text>Mare Erythraeum is a very large dark dusky region of Mars that can be viewed by even a small telescope. Its name comes from the Latin for the Erythraean Sea because it was originally thought to be a large sea of liquid water. It was included in Percival Lowell&#x27;s 1895 map of Mars.
Under the name of De La Rue Ocean it was included in Procter&#x27;s 1905 map of Mars.

<text>Maria Lynn Schneider (born November 27, 1960) is an American composer and jazz orchestra leader who has won multiple Grammy Awards.

==Biography==
Born in Windom, Minnesota, Schneider studied music theory and composition at the University of Minnesota, graduating in 1983, then earned a master&#x27;s degree in Music in 1985 from the Eastman School of Music, studying for one year as well at the University of Miami. After leaving Eastman, she was hired by Gil Evans as his copyist and assistant.

She collaborated with Evans for the next few years, working with him on music for a tour with Sting and assisting him as he scored the film &quot;The Color of Money&quot;. Before she became one of the most acclaimed composers and bandleaders of her generation, Schneider received an NEA Apprenticeship Grant to study with Bob Brookmeyer in 1985.

In 1988, Schneider formed her first band in collaboration with jazz trombonist John Fedchock, her husband at the time, and that group appeared at Visiones in Greenwich Village. Both that group and her marriage would dissolve, but Schneider followed up in 1992 by forming the Maria Schneider Jazz Orchestra, which would appear weekly at Visiones from 1993 until the venue closed in 1998. Albums by the group have been released as by the Maria Schneider Orchestra since 2000.

From 2005 through 2019, the Maria Schneider Orchestra performed an annual Thanksgiving week-long gig at the Jazz Standard in New York City. The orchestra has also performed at jazz festivals and concert halls in Europe, South America, and Asia. Schneider has performed with over 80 groups in over 30 countries and has taught at universities worldwide. In 2013, she received an honorary doctorate from the University of Minnesota.

Although three of the orchestra&#x27;s albums had been previously nominated, Schneider&#x27;s &quot;Concert in the Garden&quot; (2004) was the first to win a Grammy Award. It was also the first such award-winning album produced by ArtistShare, a fan funded platform that has (as of 2017) received 30 Grammy Award nominations and 10 Grammy Award wins. The orchestra has since won additional Grammy Awards for the large-ensemble jazz albums The Thompson Fields and Data Lords, while Schneider receive Grammy Awards for individual compositions on the albums Sky Blue and Data Lords. The orchestra performed a 30th anniversary concert in November 2024 at The Town Hall in New York City, marking 30 years since the release of their first album, Evanescence.

Aside from her jazz orchestral works, Schneider&#x27;s &quot;Winter Morning Walks&quot; (2013) album featured soprano Dawn Upshaw, the Saint Paul and Australian Chamber Orchestras, bassist Jay Anderson, pianist Frank Kimbrough, and multi-instrumentalist Scott Robinson. The album accompanied poetry written by U.S. Poet Laureate Ted Kooser and was funded by ArtistShare. It won Schneider a Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition. Dawn Upshaw also won a Grammy for her vocal performance, while the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Classical award went to David Frost, Tim Martyn, and Brian Losch.

==Advocacy for musicians==
Schneider has been a strong advocate for musicians&#x27; rights and copyright. She has testified before Congress, and has been asked to participate in several round tables conducted by the United States Copyright Office. Schneider has been outspoken against YouTube and so-called &quot;freemium&quot; streaming models. She has published several open letters and white papers on these topics.

Schneider has been a board member of the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences for the New York local chapter and has been involved in many of the NARAS advocacy initiatives, including Grammys on the Hill. In April 2014, on behalf of NARAS, Schneider testified on Section 512 of Section 17 before the House Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet.

Schneider&#x27;s advocacy against big data companies and their impact on music, culture and privacy is reflected in some of her compositions of the late 2010s, including pieces entitled &quot;Data Lords&quot;, commissioned by the U.S. Library of Congress (2016); &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Evil&quot;; and &quot;Sputnik&quot;. Several of these compositions appeared on the 2020 album &quot;Data Lords&quot;.

=== Class action lawsuit against YouTube ===
On July 2, 2020, Maria Schneider filed a class action lawsuit with Pirate Monitor Ltd. against YouTube arguing that smaller copyright holders are unable to access YouTube&#x27;s Content ID system which would allow them to publish, monetize, and block infringing material. Schneider and Pirate Monitor claimed that they and other small copyright rights holders were denied access to Content ID, leaving them only the options of self-policing or ignoring infringement of their own property. They also argued that Content ID&#x27;s weak punishments encourage repeat infringement and that YouTube did not qualify for DMCA safe harbor.

Pirate Monitor Ltd voluntarily withdrew from the class action lawsuit on March 8, 2021, while Maria Schneider continued with the case. The case was dismissed in June 2023 before going to trial.

==Personal life==
Schneider is an avid birdwatcher and enlisted band members to contribute bird calls to &quot;Cerulean Skies&quot; on her album &quot;Sky Blue&quot;. Other bird-related songs on her albums include &quot;Waxwing&quot; on &quot;Coming About&quot;, &quot;Bird Count&quot; on &quot;Days of Wine and Roses - Live at the Jazz Standard&quot;, and &quot;Arbiters of Evolution&quot; on &quot;The Thompson Fields&quot;.

<text>The Cruthin (; or ; ) were a people of early medieval Ireland. Their heartland was in Ulster and included parts of the present-day counties of Antrim, Down and Londonderry. They are also said to have lived in parts of Leinster and Connacht. Their name is the Irish equivalent of *&quot;Pritanī&quot;, the reconstructed native name of the Celtic Britons, and &quot;Cruthin&quot; was sometimes used to refer to the Picts, but there is a debate among scholars as to the relationship of the Cruthin with the Britons and Picts.

The Cruthin comprised several túatha (territories), which included the Dál nAraidi of County Antrim and the Uí Echach Cobo of County Down. Early sources distinguish between the Cruthin and the Ulaid, who gave their name to the over-kingdom, although the Dál nAraidi would later claim in their genealogies to be , &quot;the true Ulaid&quot;. The Loígis, who gave their name to County Laois in Leinster, and the Sogain of Leinster and Connacht, are also claimed as Cruthin in early Irish genealogies.

By 773 AD, the annals had stopped using the term Cruthin in favour of the term Dál nAraidi, who had secured their over-kingship of the Cruthin.

==Etymology==

In medieval Irish writings, the plural form of the name is variously spelt , , , , or (modern Irish: ). The singular form is (modern Irish: ). The adjectival form is (modern Irish: ), which is also used as a noun. It is thought to relate to the Irish word , meaning &quot;form, figure, shape&quot;. The name is believed to derive from &quot;*Qritani&quot;, a reconstructed Goidelic/Q-Celtic version of the Brittonic/P-Celtic &quot;*Pritani&quot;. Ancient Greek geographer Pytheas called the Celtic Britons the &quot;Pretanoí&quot;, which became &quot;Britanni&quot; in Latin.
It is suggested that was not what the people called themselves, but was what their neighbours called them.

The name survives in the placenames Duncrun (, &quot;fort of the Cruthin&quot;) and Drumcroon (, &quot;ridge of the Cruthin&quot;) in County Londonderry, and Ballycrune (, &quot;pass of the Cruthin&quot;) and Crown Mound (, &quot;ford of the Cruthin&quot;) in County Down. These placenames are believed to mark the edges of Cruthin territory.

==References in the Irish annals==
By the start of the historic period in Ireland in the 6th century, the over-kingdom of Ulaid was largely confined to the east of the River Bann in north-eastern Ireland. The Cruthin still held territory west of the Bann in County Londonderry, and their emergence may have concealed the dominance of earlier tribal groupings.

A certain Dubsloit of the Cruthin is said to have killed the son of High King Diarmait mac Cerbaill in 555 or 558, and Diarmait himself was killed by a Cruthin over-king of Ulster, Áed Dub mac Suibni, in 565.

In 563, according to the Annals of Ulster, an apparent internal struggle amongst the Cruthin resulted in Báetán mac Cinn making a deal with the Northern Uí Néill, promising them the territories of Ard Eólairg (Magilligan peninsula) and the Lee, both west of the River Bann in County Londonderry. As a result, the battle of Móin Daire Lothair (modern-day Moneymore) was fought between them and an alliance of Cruthin kings, in which the Cruthin suffered a devastating defeat. Afterwards the Northern Uí Néill settled their Airgíalla allies in the Cruthin territory of Eilne, which lay between the River Bann and the River Bush. The defeated Cruthin alliance meanwhile consolidated itself within the Dál nAraidi dynasty.

Their most powerful historical king was Fiachnae mac Báetáin, King of Ulster and effective High King of Ireland. Under their king, Congal Cláen, they were routed by the Uí Néill at Dún Cethirnn (between Limavady and Coleraine) in 629, although Congal survived. The same year, the Cruthin king Mael Caích defeated Connad Cerr of the Dál Riata at Fid Eóin, but in 637 an alliance between Congal Cláen and Domnall Brecc of the Dál Riata was defeated, and Congal was killed, by Domnall mac Aedo of the northern Uí Néill at Mag Roth (Moira, County Down), establishing the supremacy of the Uí Neill in the north. In 681 another Dál nAraide king, Dúngal Eilni, and his allies were killed by the Uí Néill in what the annals call &quot;the burning of the kings at Dún Cethirnn&quot;. The ethnic term &quot;Cruthin&quot; was by this stage giving way to the dynastic name of the Dál nAraide. The Annals record a battle between the Cruthin and the Ulaid at Belfast in 668, but the last use of the term is in 773, when the death of Flathruae mac Fiachrach, &quot;rex Cruithne&quot;, is noted. By the twelfth century it had fallen into disuse as an ethnonym, and was remembered only as an alternative name for the Dál nAraide.

The &quot;Pictish Chronicle&quot; names the first king of the Picts as the eponymous &quot;Cruidne filius Cinge&quot;.

==Possible relationship to other groups==
Early Irish writers used the name to refer to both the north-eastern Irish group and to the Picts of Scotland. Likewise, the Scottish Gaelic word for a Pict is or , and Pictland is . It has thus been suggested that the Cruthin and Picts were the same people or were in some way linked. Professor T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly argued that the Qritani/Pritani were &quot;the earliest inhabitants of these islands to whom a name can be assigned&quot;.

Other scholars disagree. Historian Francis John Byrne notes that although in Irish both groups were called by the same name, in Latin they had different names, with being reserved for the Picts. Professor Dáibhí Ó Cróinín says the &quot;notion that the Cruthin were &#x27;Irish Picts&#x27; and were closely connected with the Picts of Scotland is quite mistaken&quot;, while Professor Kenneth H. Jackson wrote that the Cruthin &quot;were not Picts, had no connection with the Picts, linguistic or otherwise, and are never called by Irish writers&quot;. There is no archaeological evidence of a Pictish link and in archaeology the Cruthin are indistinguishable from their neighbours in Ireland. The records show that the Cruthin bore Irish names, spoke Irish and followed the Irish system of inheritance rather than the matrilineal system sometimes attributed to the Picts.

Possible linguistic connection between Cruthin and Picts is nevertheless mentioned in St. Andomnán&#x27;s Life of St. Columba (c. 697-700 AD), in which it is stated that Columba needed to speak through an interpreter on his mission into Pictland (section XXXIII) (signifying that he could not understand the Pictish language), and that he brought with him two Irish Cruthin (St. Comgall and St. Canice) to translate for him.

Historian Alex Woolf suggested that the Dál Riata were a part of the Cruthin and that they were descended from the Epidii. Dál Riata was a Gaelic kingdom that included parts of western Scotland and northeastern Ireland. The Irish part of the kingdom was surrounded by Cruthin territory.

==Modern politics and culture==
In the 1970s, Unionist politician Ian Adamson proposed that the Cruthin were a British people who spoke a non-Celtic language and were the original inhabitants of Ulster. He argues that they were at war with the Irish Gaels for centuries, seeing the story of the &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot; as representing this; and argues that most of the Cruthin were driven to Scotland after the Battle of Moira (637), only for their descendants to return 1,000 years later in the Plantation of Ulster. Adamson suggests that the Gaelic Irish are not really native to Ulster and that the Ulster Scots have merely returned to their ancient lands. 
His theory has been adopted by some Ulster loyalists and Ulster Scots activists to counter Irish nationalism, and was promoted by elements in the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). They saw this new &#x27;origin myth&#x27; as &quot;a justification for their presence in Ireland and for partition of the country&quot;.

Historians, archaeologists and anthropologists have widely rejected Adamson&#x27;s theory. Prof. Stephen Howe of the University of Bristol argues it was designed to provide ancient underpinnings for a militantly separate Ulster identity. Historian Peter Berresford Ellis likens it to Zionism. Archaeologists such as J. P. Mallory and T. E. McNeil note that the Cruthin are &quot;archaeologically invisible&quot;; there is no evidence of them being a distinct group and &quot;there is not a single object or site that an archaeologist can declare to be distinctly Cruthin&quot;; they further considered Adamson&#x27;s claims &quot;quite remarkable&quot;.

Much of Adamson&#x27;s theories are based on the historical model put forward by Irish linguist T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly in 1946. Where Adamson differs is his claim that the Cruthin or Priteni were pre-Celtic as opposed to Celts themselves. However, this model has since been refuted by authors such as Kenneth H. Jackson and John T. Koch. There is a lack of archaeological evidence for O&#x27;Rahilly&#x27;s theory, and it was conclusively shown to be false in the landmark 2017 publication of the &quot;Irish DNA Atlas&quot;, which sets out in great detail the genealogical history and modern day makeup of the British Isles.

The asteroid 3753 Cruithne was named after the group.

Robert E. Howard&#x27;s pulp hero Bran Mak Morn was characterised as &quot;chief of the Cruithni Picts&quot;.

<text>Benozzo Gozzoli (; born Benozzo di Lese; 4 October 1497) was an Italian Renaissance painter from Florence. A pupil of Fra Angelico, Gozzoli is best known for a series of murals in the Magi Chapel of the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi, depicting festive, vibrant processions with fine attention to detail and a pronounced International Gothic influence. The chapel&#x27;s fresco cycle reveals a new Renaissance interest in nature with its realistic depiction of landscapes and vivid human portraits. Gozzoli is considered one of the most prolific fresco painters of his generation. While he was mainly active in Tuscany, he also worked in Umbria and Rome.

==Biography==

===Apprenticeship===
Gozzoli was born Benozzo di Lese, son of a tailor, in the village of Sant&#x27;Ilario a Colombano around 1421. His family moved to nearby Florence in 1427. According to the 16th century Italian biographer Giorgio Vasari, Gozzoli was a pupil and assistant of Fra Angelico in the early part of his career.

Gozzoli assisted Angelico in the execution of fresco decorations in the dormitory cells of the Convent of San Marco in Florence. Established contributions here include &quot;The Adoration of the Magi&quot; in Cosimo de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s cell and the &quot;Women at the Tomb&quot; in a larger depiction of the &quot;Resurrection of Christ&quot; in cell 8. Like many other Early Renaissance painters, Benozzo was initially trained as a goldsmith as well as a painter.

Between 1444 and 1447, he was therefore able to collaborate with Lorenzo Ghiberti on the famous Gates of Paradise of the Florence Baptistery. 

On 23 May 1447, Benozzo was with Fra Angelico in Rome, to where they were called by Pope Eugene IV to carry out fresco decorations in a chapel in the Vatican Palace. This chapel was later demolished, so nothing of these works remains. He then accompanied Angelico to Umbria, where they decorated in the &quot;Chapel of the Madonna di San Brizio&quot; in the Orvieto Cathedral.

Due to political complications in the city, they completed only two of the four vault webs and were again summoned to the Vatican, where the pair worked for Nicholas V in the Niccoline Chapel until June 1448. Gozzoli is assumed to have made significant contributions in . Furthermore, the attribution of a 1449 &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; &quot;Giving Blessings&quot; in the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva is disputed between Gozzoli and Fra Angelico. In Rome, Gozzoli also executed a fresco of &quot;St Anthony of Padua&quot; in the Basilica of Santa Maria in Aracoeli.

Both Fra Angelico and Lorenzo Ghiberti were to influence much of Gozzoli&#x27;s work for the rest of his life. From Ghiberti he learned precision in depicting the finest details and how to illustrate a story vividly, while from Fra Angelico, he took his bright color palette, transferring it to the art of fresco painting.

===In Umbria===

In 1449, Gozzoli left Angelico and moved to Umbria. In the hilltown of Narni there is an &quot;Annunciation&quot; from 1450, signed OPU[S] BENOT[I] DE FLORENT[IA]. In the monastery of San Fortunato, near Montefalco, Gozzoli painted a &quot;Madonna and Child between St. Francis and St. Bernardine of Siena&quot;, and three other works. One of these, the altarpiece &quot;Madonna of the Girdle&quot;, is now in the Vatican Museums and shows the affinity of Benozzo&#x27;s early style to Angelico&#x27;s.

In 1450, Gozzoli received his first major independent commission from the monastery of S. Francesco in Montefalco. There, he filled the choir chapel with three registers of episodes from the life of St Francis of Assisi and various accessories, including portrait heads of Dante, Petrarch and Giotto. These were completed in 1452, and are still marked by the style of Angelico, crossed here and there with a more distinctly Giottesque influence. In the same church, in the chapel of Saint Jerome, there is a fresco by Gozzoli of the &quot;Virgin and Saints&quot;, the &quot;Crucifixion&quot; and other subjects.

Gozzoli probably remained at Montefalco (with an interval at Viterbo) until 1456, employing Pier Antonio Mezzastris as an assistant. Then, he went to Perugia and painted a &quot;Virgin and Saints&quot; that is now in the local academy.

=== Return to Florence ===

That same year, Benozzo returned to his native city Florence, the epicenter of &quot;Quattrocento&quot; art. Between 1459 and 1461, Gozzoli painted what may be considered his most important works, the frescoes in the Magi Chapel of the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi. There, in his &quot;Journey of the Magi to Bethlehem&quot; and &quot;Angels in Adoration&quot;, he mastered a combination of complexity and subtlety, portraying a wealthy scene that encompasses realistic depictions of nature and vivid human portraits. In his &quot;Journey of the Magi&quot;, Gozzoli incorporated numerous portraits of his Medici patrons, their allies and prominent contemporary figures. Furthermore, he also included his self-portrait in the procession, with his name written around the rim of his cap. 
His frescoes in the Magi Chapel brought Gozzoli a great amount of fame and ensured him of new important commissions. One of these was an altarpiece for the Confraternity of the Purification in Florence, originally housed in the Convent of San Marco. The &quot;Virgin and Child Enthroned among Angels and Saints&quot; that he produced between 1461 and 1462 for this occasion now houses in the National Gallery, London.

===Late years in Tuscany===

==== San Gimignano ====
In 1463, likely in fear of the plague, Gozzoli left Florence for San Gimignano, where he executed some extensive works. Most prominent of these is his seventeen-panel fresco cycle on &quot;The Life of St Augustine&quot;, covering the entire apsidal chapel in the church of Sant&#x27;Agostino. In that same church Gozzoli also completed a composition of &quot;St. Sebastian Protecting the City from the Plague&quot;, in which he depicted St. Sebastian fully clothed and unhurt, thereby going against iconographic canon. In 1465, at the town&#x27;s heart in the Collegiate Church of Santa Maria Assunta, Gozzoli furthermore painted a fresco of the &quot;Martyrdom of Sebastian&quot;. He stayed in San Gimignano until 1467, completing some further works in the city and its vicinity.

==== Pisa ====

In 1469, Gozzoli moved to Pisa and began working on his most extensive commission: the vast series of mural paintings in the Campo Santo edifice of Pisa. There, he depicted twenty-four subjects from the Old Testament, ranging from the &quot;Invention of Wine by Noah&quot; to the &quot;Visit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon&quot;. He was contracted to paint three subjects per year for about ten ducats each. It appears, however, that this contract was not strictly adhered to, for the actual rate of painting was only three pictures in two years. Perhaps the great multitude of figures and accessories was accepted as a set-off against the slower rate of production.

By January 1470 he had executed the fresco of &quot;Noah and his Family&quot;, followed by the &quot;Curse of Ham&quot;, the &quot;Building of the Tower of Babel&quot; (which contains portraits of Cosimo de&#x27; Medici, the young Lorenzo, Angelo Poliziano and others), the &quot;Destruction of Sodom&quot;, the &quot;Victory of Abraham&quot;, the &quot;Marriages of Rebecca and of Rachel&quot;, the &quot;Life of Moses&quot;, etc. In the Cappella Ammannati, facing a gate of the Campo Santo, he also painted an &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot;, wherein appears a portrait of himself.

All this enormous mass of work, in which Benozzo was probably assisted by Zanobi Machiavelli, was performed, in addition to several other pictures during his stay in Pisa (including the &quot;Glory of St. Thomas Aquinas&quot;, now in the Louvre), in sixteen years, lasting up to 1485. This is the latest date which can with certainty be assigned to any work from his hand. Gozzoli died in Pistoia in 1497, perhaps of a pestilence.

In 1478, as a token of their regard, the Pisan authorities had given him a tomb in the Campo Santo. He likewise had a house of his own in Pisa, and houses and land in Florence.

== Trivia ==
* The painters Francesco, Gerolamo, and Alesso di Benozzo were his sons and assisted him on various commissions. 
* The &quot;Master of the Small Figures&quot; identified by Longhi is the same painter called &quot;Alunno di Benozzo&quot; (pupil of Benozzo) by Berenson. The name is based on stylistic grounds.

<text>Carnoustie (; ) is a town and former police burgh in the council area of Angus, Scotland. It is at the mouth of the Barry Burn on the North Sea coast. In the 2011 census, Carnoustie had a population of 11,394, making it the fourth-largest town in Angus.
The town was founded in the late 18th century, and grew rapidly throughout the 19th century due to the growth of the local textile industry. It was popular as a tourist resort from the early Victorian era up to the latter half of the 20th century, due to its seaside location, and is best known for the Carnoustie Golf Links course that often hosts the Open Championship.

Carnoustie can be considered a dormitory town for its nearest city, Dundee, which is to the west. It is served principally by Carnoustie railway station, and also by Golf Street railway station. Its nearest major road is the A92, north of the town.

== History ==

=== Toponymy ===

Carnoustie&#x27;s name is of uncertain origin. The first element has been linked to a variety of Gaelic words, including &quot;cathair&quot; (fort), &quot;càrr&quot; (stone), and &quot;carn&quot; (cairn), but the second has eluded interpretation. &quot;Càrn Ùstaidh&quot;, the name used by Ainmean-Àite na h-Alba, is merely a Gaelicized form of the English name. A popular theory interprets the name as &quot;craws&#x27; nestie&quot;, in reference to the large number of crows and rooks which once built their nests here, and the burgh seal displays a tree surrounded by crows in allusion to this. 

Whatever its origin, the name predates the town itself by several hundred years. It first appears as &quot;Carnowis&quot; in a charter issued by James IV to the Earl of Angus in 1510. &quot;Carnussie&quot; farm is recorded in the Balmerino Abbey register of 1575, which states that it (along with part of Grange of Barry and Badiehill) was feued to the Fairny family and &quot;Karnousty&quot; farm can be seen on Pont&#x27;s map of Lower Angus, 1583––1596. The town is seen as &quot;Carnowstie&quot; in a deed of sale from 1595, &quot;Carnushie&quot; appears in a tax roll from Balmerino Abbey in 1617, and the lands of &quot;Carnouslie&quot; are referred to in the title deeds confirming its purchase by the Earl of Panmure in 1672. Adair is perhaps the first to depict Carnoustie with the current spelling in 1703, while Roy&#x27;s military survey of Scotland, 1747–55 has it as &quot;Cornisty&quot;. In &quot;Webster&#x27;s Topographical Dictionary of Scotland&quot; (1819), Carnoustie is mentioned as &quot;Carnuistie&quot;.

=== Early history ===
The area surrounding Carnoustie has been occupied continuously since the Neolithic period, as evidenced by a Cursus monument, identified from cropmarks near Woodhill. This cursus is of a similar scale to the well characterised, mid-4th-century BC enclosure found nearby at Douglasmuir near Friockheim. Numerous stones incised with cup and ring marks have also been found in the surrounding area. An assemblage of Late Neolithic pottery fragments found at Carlogie, north of Carnoustie, has been interpreted as evidence of a settlement of that age in the area.

Bronze Age archaeology is also present in the area. Numerous short cist burials have been found in the area, including one found in 1994 at West Scryne, northeast of Carnoustie, that was radiocarbon dated to between 1730 and 1450 BC. The presence of Bronze Age round barrows at Craigmill is also indicated by cropmarks. From the Iron Age, perhaps the most prominent remains are of the Dundee Law Hill Fort, with the Iron Age fort at Craigmill Den being less well known. Near to Carnoustie can be found the souterrains at Carlungie and Ardestie, which date from around the 2nd century AD. Several brochs are also found in the area, including the ruins at Drumsturdy and at Craighill. Roman remains are also found in the area. Particularly notable are the temporary marching camps at Kirkbuddo, Marcus and Finavon, and Roman coins have periodically been found nearby.

Pictish remains are to be found in abundance in the surrounding area. Class I sculptured stones from Aberlemno and Strathmartine can be seen in the McManus Galleries in Dundee while the class I Dunnichen Stone is on loan to the Meffan Institute in Forfar. A class I stone can also be seen in situ at Aberlemno, and this stone appears to be a recycled neolithic stone, having cup and ring marks apparent on its side. Class II stones can be seen at Aberlemno and Glamis and a much-misinterpreted class III stone (known locally as the Camus Cross) can be found north of Carnoustie at Camuston Hill on Panmure Estate. Linked in misinterpretation with the Camus stone is the early Christian Pictish cemetery that was situated to the West of the Lochty burn, in the vicinity of the High Street. The soil in this vicinity is sandy and was prone to wind erosion, and periodically human remains became exposed to the surface prior to the founding of the town. Popular interpretation was that a great battle had taken place at the site, giving rise to the legend of the Battle of Barry.

The medieval period marks the earliest recorded history in the area. Arbroath Abbey was founded by William the Lion and dedicated in 1178 and the earldom of Dundee granted to David, Earl of Huntingdon around 1182 (Dundee later gained Royal Burgh status in 1292 on the coronation of David&#x27;s heir, John Balliol). Closer to Carnoustie, a number of medieval mottes can be found, including at Old Downie, where the thanage can be traced to Duncan of Downie in 1254, and at Grange of Barry, as well as the ruins of Panmure Castle where, it is said, William the Lion signed the Panmure charter granting the lands of Panmure to Philip de Valognes in 1172. The original castle was destroyed at some point in the Second War of Independence, possibly in 1336.

The Parish of Barry was bestowed to the monks of Balmerino Abbey in Fife by Alexander II in 1230. The monks managed the lands from the Grange of Barry and latterly the land was controlled by the office of the Bailies of Barry, an early holder of this position being Sir Thomas Maule of Panmure in 1511.

A number of feus were granted in the parish around that time, including Ravensby in 1539, Gedhall to David Gardyne in 1541, half of Barry Links and Cowbyres to Walter Cant in 1545 and the other half of the links to Robert Forrester in 1552. A document from around this time details the rent charged for each of the farms in the area, and it is in this that we see the first mention of Carnoustie:

&quot;The two part of Grange of Barrie 10s. land of ye same 9 aikers of badihill. And toun and lands of Carnussie set to ffairny for 25 li. 2s. 24 capons 20 puld.&quot;

The land was annexed by the state in the Protestant Reformation following an Act of Parliament in 1587 and the Bailiery of Barry was granted by James VI as a heritable gift to Patrick Maule in 1590. Ownership of the lands was granted by the King to James Elphinstone, Secretary of State in 1599 (ratified 1605), and was sold to George Maule, 2nd Earl of Panmure in 1667 (ratified in 1672) for £746 13s 4d. The land was forfeited following James Maule, 4th Earl of Panmure&#x27;s involvement in the Jacobite rising of 1715.

The first recorded owners of the Barony of Panbride was the Morham family, whose ancestral name was Malherbe. They are first mentioned in relation to Panbride in the registers of Arbroath Abbey in a charter of John Morham made in the mid-13th century. It is thought that they had possession of the land until 1309 when Robert I conferred the land to his brother in law, Alexander Fraser, Lord Chamberlain of Scotland. Fraser died at the Battle of Dupplin Moor in 1332 and it is thought that David II conferred the barony (at least in part) to the Boyce family in 1341.

The lands of Panbride were fragmented and passed through a number of hands from that point, and were gradually acquired by the Carnegie family, later to become the Earls of Northesk, in the 16th century. The lands were forfeited following the Jacobite rebellion but were bought back by James Carnegie in 1764. Carnegie used the lands to purchase lands near his main estate and the barony of Panbride passed to William Maule, linking Panbride with Panmure.

=== Origin ===
The lands of Carnoustie remained in the ownership of the Fernie family until the end of the 16th century. In 1595 they had passed into the hands of Mitchell Downie and Margaret Fernie who sold them to Robert Bultie, Burgess of Dundee for the sum of 5,000 merks. They then came into the possession of the Alexander family, probably around the beginning of the 17th century, and documents dating to the middle of that century mention a village of Carnoustie. The estate was then sold to Patrick Lyon of Strathmore around 1680, and remained in that family&#x27;s ownership, passing through marriage to James Milne, a wealthy shipmaster from Montrose around 1752.

The Barry parish register attests to a small but thriving community based largely on linen weaving existing on the land that became Carnoustie at least from the early 18th century (before then, the place of residence is not listed in the records). Around a fifth of the births registered in the parish in the mid-18th century are listed as being in the Carnoustie estate.

The stimulus that triggered the expansion of the town was undoubtedly the sudden increase in demand for linen from around 1760, caused by the population explosion of the mid-18th century. Handloom weaving was a relatively easy trade to learn and, at that time, a fairly prosperous career. In 1792 on his return from India, Major William Phillips, former valet to the Earl of Panmure, purchased Carnoustie estate from James Milne for £5,000. Phillips most likely recognised the potential of the local industry when he offered portions of the land for feu in 1797.

The first person to take up a feu was Thomas Lowson, a local loom wright, who rented of land near the new road that had been recently been marked out by David Gardyne of Ravensby. Over the next few years, more and more people settled in the immediate area The venture proved profitable and Phillips sold the property in 1808 to George Kinloch for £11,000.

Kinloch promoted the further growth of the village, setting up brickworks and granting loans to prospective feuers to allow them to settle and, by the mid-19th century, the population of the town had risen to more than a thousand. For many years, the village was known simply as &#x27;the Feus&#x27;. Perhaps the first cartographic depiction of the town is from a French maritime chart of 1803, where the village is shown as &#x27;Feux&#x27;, while Thomson&#x27;s 1832 map of the area shows &#x27;the Feus&#x27; as being a number of properties, largely concentrated in the area to the west of the Lochty burn.

=== Industrial history ===

The handloom linen weaving industry dominated Carnoustie&#x27;s economy through its early years. Flax was grown in considerable quantities in the area and supplemented imports from Riga and St Petersburg. The predominant occupation listed in the 1841 census and 1843 statistical account for Barry Parish is that of &quot;Linen Hand Loom Weaver&quot;. The expansion in the linen industry supported a population increase in the Barry Parish from 796 in 1791 to 2,124 by the time of the 1841 census.

Aside from the linen industry, the economy rested mainly on agriculture and fishing. Major crops of that period were cereal and vegetables; much of which was sold on to markets in local towns. Cattle were raised for export to England. Salmon were caught in nets on Carnoustie Beach, and the small fishing fleets of Westhaven and Easthaven caught cod for export and haddock which was largely destined for Dundee and Forfar. Lobsters were caught for live export to London and crabs were caught for local use.

The arrival of the Dundee and Arbroath Railway in 1838 encouraged major industrial growth in the town and shortly after, the Vitriol Works opened near the railway line, on ground to the west of the town, producing sulphuric acid used largely in the production of agricultural fertiliser. The Panbride Bleachfield, at which linen from the expanding local industry was bleached was opened by John Dickson in the early 1840s adjacent to the railway near the mouth of the Craigmill burn on land which is now occupied by David Murray Transport. This was supplied with water from the burn via the ponds that can now be seen in the grounds of Panbride House, now the location of the Liz McColgan Health Club.

In 1851, shoe maker John Winter opened a shop near The Cross. His business grew such that he built a large factory in 1874 at the foot of East Path (now Park Avenue/Queen Street), employing 200 people and producing 2,000 pairs of shoes and boots a week. His son, George, took over the business and built the impressive mansion, Winterdyne, that overlooks Carnoustie House Grounds at the top of Queen Street. Production ceased in 1958, and the Lousen Park sheltered housing complex was subsequently built at the site.

The linen industry in Carnoustie was modernised in 1857 with the opening of the Panmure Works by James Smieton. This factory, which at its height employed 600 employees, was a state-of-the-art facility containing 400 modern power looms and produced of linen and jute annually. Smieton also built new housing on a number of streets in the surrounding area for his employees and, in 1865, he opened the Panmure Works Institute on Kinloch Street which provided a library, billiards room and a hall for the education and recreation of his workers. The firm went through several changes of ownership through its history and was owned by W. G. Grant &amp; Co Ltd from 1932 until 1972 when it went into liquidation.

The smaller Taymouth Linen works were opened in 1867 to the west of Panmure Works and the Vitriol Works, and at its height contained 100 power looms. Again, additional housing was built by the owners, the Brodies, including Taymouth Terrace. By 1898 Taymouth Works had become home to the business of George Anderson, owner of the Arbroath Foundry. George Anderson &amp; Co. Ltd. produced for example, quarrying equipment such as channelling machines. The business evolved into Anderson-Grice Co. Ltd. which produced a range of mechanical equipment, including the short-lived Dalhousie motor car.

=== Development as a dormitory town ===

In addition to bringing industry to Carnoustie, the opening of the railway also made the town appealing to the middle classes, who used it as a commuter town for Dundee, further boosting population growth in the town. This trend has continued to the present day to the point where nearly half of the employed population now commute to Dundee for work.

=== Tourism and recreation ===
Carnoustie benefited from the 19th-century fashion for sea bathing. The arrival of the railway enabled the town to develop as a popular tourist destination; it was promoted as the &quot;Brighton of the North&quot; in the early 20th century.

While golf has been played on Barry links since the 16th century a formal 10 hole golf course was laid out in 1850 to the design of Alan Robertson of St Andrews. This was later improved in 1867 by Old Tom Morris, who added a further 8 holes. This course was redesigned in the 1920s by James Braid. In 1891, Arthur George Maule Ramsey, 14th Earl of Dalhousie, sold the links to the town on condition that they would be maintained for all time as a golf course. A three-day bazaar was held at the Kinnaird Hall in Dundee, which raised the funds for the purchase and secured the future of the links for golfing and leisure.

Tourism in Carnoustie began to decline in the latter half of the 20th century, largely due to the increased availability of package tours to warmer parts of the world. This trend has reversed somewhat with the increase in golf tourism.

== Governance ==
Carnoustie is represented within Angus Council by the Carnoustie &amp; District ward, from which three councillors are elected. The town is part of the Dundee East constituency of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which returns a Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons, at Westminster. The constituency&#x27;s MP is Stewart Hosie of the Scottish National Party.

Carnoustie is also part of the Angus South constituency of the Scottish Parliament, which has significantly different boundaries to the Westminster constituency. The constituency returns a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) to Holyrood directly, and is part of the North East Scotland electoral region with regards to additional Members of the Scottish Parliament. The constituency&#x27;s MSP is Graeme Dey of the Scottish National Party.

== Geography ==
Carnoustie occupies a seafront position on the North Sea coast of Scotland, on land immediately northeast of the Buddon Ness, ENE of Dundee, SW of Arbroath and SSE of Forfar. The town lies NNE of Edinburgh and NNW of London. The built-up area occupies a roughly rectangular shape measuring . The land is relatively flat, rising gradually to around 30 m elevation to the north of the town. The climate is typical for the east coast of Scotland, although the weather can be locally influenced by sea mist, locally known as haar.

The town straddles the border between the parishes of Barry and Panbride and incorporates a number of former villages and hamlets, including Greenlawhill, Gardynebourg and Hunterstown to the west, and Gallowlaw, Panbride and Westhaven to the east. Contiguous to the town, on the west side, is the village of Barry, and to the east, separated from the town by is the hamlet that was known as Kirkton of Panbride (now known as Panbride). To the north of the town runs the A92, between Dundee and Arbroath. east of the town lies the village of East Haven. Running through the town on the border of the two parishes is a small stream, the Lochty burn, and to the western edge of the town, runs the Barry Burn. The south-western corner of the town lies within the floodplain of the Barry Burn. east of the town runs the Craig Mill burn, which flows through Batty&#x27;s Den, into Craig Mill Den, to the sea.

The Dundee and Arbroath Railway runs along the south of the town, bisecting the former villages of Gallowlaw and Westhaven to the east of the Lochty burn. The A930 runs through the town from Barry, and is named Barry Road, Dundee Street and High Street, as it runs from west to east. It turns sharply north at Gallowlaw, where it is named Carlogie Road, and carves a path through Batty&#x27;s Den to Muirdrum, where it meets with the A92.

The part of the coast that lies to the east of the Lochty burn is a rocky shore, where the Devonian Old Red Sandstone bedrock is exposed. To the west, lies the sandy beach of Barry Sands (otherwise known as Carnoustie Beach). The soil is sandy and, prior to the founding of the town, the land resembled the sandy dunes of Barry Links. To the west of the Lochty burn, the shore is increasingly separated by the peninsula of the Buddon Ness, on which lies the three golf courses of Carnoustie Golf Links, and Panmure Golf Club. To the south of the golf courses lies the Ministry of Defence owned Barry Buddon training camp. This land is classified as a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation.

The Buddon Ness is a triangle of land around 11 km2. Its position at the estuary of the River Tay makes it prone to erosion, and the position of both the west and east facing shores have changed considerably since the founding of Carnoustie. Comparison of Ordnance Survey maps from the mid-19th century with present-day maps show the shoreline retreating on the west shore and advancing on the east shore. This is supported by comparison of old photographs of Carnoustie links with the present day situation in which the foreshore is now much further from the Beach Pavilion (now the Rugby Club) than it was 80 years ago. The concern latterly has been of the shoreline eroding from this part of the beach and rock armour was placed at the shoreline in 1994.

== Demography ==
The 2011 census gives Carnoustie&#x27;s total resident population as 11,394. This makes it the fourth largest town in Angus, after Arbroath (23,902), Forfar (14,048) and Montrose (11,955). The demographic breakdown of these figures closely follows that of the rest of Scotland. Males make up 47.4% of the population and females, 52.6%. Under-16s account for 18.2% of the population, retired people 19.6%, and economically active people make up 69.9%. 87.4% of the population were born in Scotland and 8.1% in England, with people from the rest of the United Kingdom making up 0.9%. 0.3% were from the Republic of Ireland, 0.9% from elsewhere in Europe and 2.4% from outside of Europe. 0.5% of the population speak Gaelic, whilst 32.2% of Carnoustie&#x27;s population can speak Scots. 69.9% of the working-age population were economically active, 3.4% were unemployed.

== Economy ==
The economy of Carnoustie relies to a large extent on its proximity to Dundee. In the 2001 census, 2,267 people reported commuting to Dundee for work, making up 41.4% of the economically active, working-age population.

Golf is a major tourist draw to the town, and it is estimated that the recent Open Championship contributed £14 million to the local economy. Television coverage during the event was estimated to be worth the equivalent of £34 million in advertising value, half of which was in North America. The &#x27;Carnoustie Country&#x27; golf marketing campaign is funded and promoted by Angus Council to promote the area for golfing tourism in the area.

== Landmarks ==
At the far west end of the town is the village of Barry. On the north side of the road that runs through the village, to the west of the Barry Burn is the kirkyard and ruins of the old parish church. To the immediate east of this, a road heads north towards the old A92. Half a kilometre up this road, on the left hand side is the medieval motte associated with Grange of Barry, from where the monks of Balmerino Abbey managed the parish from the 13th century. On the other side of the road, a driveway runs towards the old Upper Mill, now simply known as &#x27;Barry Mill&#x27;, a water powered corn mill dating from 1815, when it was built on the site of a much older mill dating to the 16th century. The Mill is a Category A listed building and the nearby bridge which was part of the old road from Barry Grange to Panbride is Category B listed.

Much of the western part of Carnoustie is post-war. The main road in this part of the town is known as &#x27;Barry Road&#x27; and towards its eastern end there are a group of weavers cottages that pre-date the expansion of the town and used to belong to the hamlet of Hunterstown. Leading south from here, is Panmure Street, which leads to the Panmure Institute and, behind it, the Panmure Works. The Panmure Institute is now known as the Panmure Centre and owned by Angus Council for their Community Learning and Development Centre. The factory building was restored in the late 1990s and now houses the building firm DJ Laing. At the end of Barry Road, the road diverts to the north slightly at the Corner Hotel, before continuing eastwards along Dundee Street. This corner, which used to be known as Hutton&#x27;s corner, is where a rocky outcrop blocked the path of the plough when the road was originally marked out in the 18th century.

The road heading north on the opposite side of Dundee Street is &#x27;West Path&#x27;. Its name comes from the fact it was the path that lead down to the main road from the western boundary of the grounds of Carnoustie House. Carnoustie House was built by Major William Philips in 1792 and bought by George Kinloch in 1808. It passed to Kinloch&#x27;s daughter, Cecilia Kinloch who, in turn, passed it to her niece, Helen Lingard-Guthrie. The house and lands were bought by the council in the first half of the 20th century and the house was demolished following a fire around 40 years ago. Carnoustie House Grounds is now used as a park and is where the annual town gala is held. Part of the land is now occupied by Woodlands Primary School, Woodlands Caravan Park and the town recycling centre.

Continuing eastwards along Dundee Street from the foot of West Path, on the north side of the road is the small former St Annes Roman Catholic Church. On the south side of the road, are the large grounds of Kinloch Primary School, opened in 1878 as Carnoustie Public School and last used as a school in November 2008 during renovations of Carlogie Primary School. The buildings were demolished in 2010 to make way for affordable housing.

Opposite the main part of the school is the former Erskine Free Church, which has been through a number of hands since it was sold off in the early 20th century and now houses All Stars sports bar, and beyond the school, heading south towards the beach is Links Avenue. On the left hand side of Links Avenue can be found the scout hut which, despite appearances, is the oldest school building in Carnoustie. The street passes through a narrow tunnel under the railway line to Links Parade near to Carnoustie Hotel, which was built in anticipation of the 1999 Open Championship. The hotel houses a 2.8 metre clock, weighing 450 kg, which was the largest timepiece supplied by Rolex at the time it was fitted. There are only 40 golf courses worldwide that have been given these Rolex clocks. Beyond the hotel lie the three golf courses of Carnoustie Golf Links.

Past Links Avenue on the north side of Dundee Street Carnoustie Church, which never received its steeple and, a little further past that, is the &#x27;Auld Nick&#x27; which originally housed Carnoustie&#x27;s police station. The war memorial lies adjacent to the Auld Nick and was dedicated in 1926. It features a sculpture of the Unknown Soldier by Thomas Beattie.

On the opposite side of the road from the Auld Nick is Ferrier Street and a little way down on the right hand side can be seen Thomas Lowson&#x27;s Dibble Tree. Opposite the Dibble tree is Kinloch Street and, about down that street on the north side, is the Erskine United Free Church, the oldest church building in Carnoustie, built in 1810.

A short way past the war memorial on the southern side of Dundee Street is First Feu Cottage, Thomas Lowson&#x27;s original home in Carnoustie, and beyond that is the traditional centre of the town, the Cross, marking the intersection between Dundee Street, High Street, Queens Street and Park Avenue. Meeting High Street on its north side, Lochty Street leads up to the Church of the Holyrood in Maule Street. It is a Category B listed building, the only listed building within the town, and was built on land donated by Helen Lingard-Guthrie, who had recently married one of the clergymen who ministered to the nascent Episcopalian congregation during the early summer missions, Rev. Roger Lingard.

At the easternmost end of High Street, the main road becomes Church Street, with Station Road heading south towards the main railway station and the adjacent Station Hotel, built in 1840. Opposite Station Road is the old City of Glasgow Bank building built in 1870 in Italianate style architecture that used to house the Clydesdale Bank. It is being developed into private accommodation. Church Street continues eastwards and at one time lead all the way to Newton of Panbride church in the former village of Gallowlaw. The junction with Carlogie Road was realigned some years ago and the part of Church Street east of Carlogie Road renamed Arbroath Road. Past the church, on the south side of the road, a road bridge leads to the former fishing village of West Haven, which pre-dates Carnoustie by several centuries. To the east of the town, in Panbride, is Panbride Parish Kirk. The building itself is category C(s) listed, although its burial aisle and the nearby parish school are both Category B listed The &#x27;Loupin&#x27; on Stane&#x27; a series of steps in the church courtyard that allowed churchgoers to mount their horses in a dignified manner have category B listing, as does the bridge over the Craigmill burn at the bottom of the hill. At the southern end of Craigmill Den, Panbride House has Category B listing, as does the associated stables.

== Transport ==
The A92 runs between Arbroath and Dundee about north of Carnoustie. There are several ways to reach the A92, including the main routes that run between the Upper Victoria junction and between the A930, Carlogie road and Muirdrum Junction. It is also possible to reach the west-bound carriageway of the A92 via Balmachy Road and the Grange of Barry Road.

Trains are operated by ScotRail on the Dundee-Aberdeen line. They stop at Carnoustie railway station on an approximately hourly basis. Two trains a day stop at Golf Street railway station (06:38 west-bound and 19:10 east-bound) and two at Barry Links (06:41 west-bound and 18:52 east-bound). As a result, Golf Street and Barry Links are two of the least used stations in the UK.

Buses are operated by Stagecoach East Scotland on their Arbroath or Westhaven Park to Dundee route. These are the number 73 and 73C buses. They operate on a regular half-hourly basis on weekdays and Saturdays and an hourly basis on Sundays. Fishers Tours also run coach services (222, 226, 228, 236, 252 and 272) from Carnoustie to Monififeth, Dundee, Perth, Crieff, Oban, Pitlochry, Fort William, Aviemore, Inverness, Glenrothes, Livingston, Dunblane, Glasgow Braehead, Largs, Stirling, Callander, Arbroath and many more destinations.

== Education ==

=== History of education ===
At the start of the 1870s, each church in Carnoustie had its own school. Some of these can still be seen today, in the former primary schools of Barry and Panbride, which were at that point the schools of Panbride Parish Church and Barry Free Church, and the Phillip Hall on Dundee Street, which was the school connected with the Erskine Free Church. These were supplemented with a number of private subscription schools, including a school in Links Avenue, opened in 1831, that now houses the local Scout group, and a school off Maule Street that is now used as Holyrood Church&#x27;s Hall. These were both victims of the success of Carnoustie Free Church school and were abandoned. More successful were the school linked to Panmure Works and a private girls school in Kinloch Street, but these too were made redundant by the 1872 act.

Carnoustie Public School was built in 1878 near the Free Church school on Dundee Street. It was extended several times before the secondary school pupils were decanted to the new Carnoustie High School building in Shanwell Road. The old school was renamed Kinloch Primary School, and continued until 2006, when it, along with Barry and Panbride Primary Schools, was closed as part of the reorganisation of schools in the area.
=== Schools today ===

Carlogie Primary School was opened in the mid-1970s in the new Caesar Avenue/Linefield Road housing estate and its current catchment area is all of Carnoustie East of Queen Street and the pupils from the surrounding rural area that was used to be served by Panbride Primary School, including Panbride, East Haven, Hatton, Muirdrum, Auchrennie, Pitlivie and Salmond&#x27;s Muir. The school&#x27;s buildings and grounds were extensively refurbished in 2008.

Woodlands Primary School is a building in the former caravan park in Carnoustie House Grounds. Its catchment area is the central part of Carnoustie between Burnside Street and Queen Street, plus the rural area north of the town, incorporating Clayholes, Balmachie, Pitskelly, Upper Victoria and Heugh-Head.

Burnside Primary School is a building in Thomas Street on land that had been used as football pitches. Its catchment area includes the remaining part of Carnoustie and the former rural catchment of Barry Primary, including Barry, Cotside, Balhungie, Ardestie, Woodhill, Grange of Barry and Mains of Ravensby.

Carnoustie High School is situated on Shanwell Road and takes all secondary pupils from Carnoustie and the surrounding rural area, including former pupils of Carlogie, Woodlands, Burnside, Kinloch, Panbride, Barry, Newbigging and Monikie Primary Schools. The school was almost entirely rebuilt in 2008, the only part of the previous buildings retained being the old Physical Education Department, theatre and music department.

== Religion ==

=== History of religion ===
The site now occupied by Panbride Church has been a site of worship since 1147. A series of successive buildings have been built at the site, with the present building built in 1681 by George Maule, 2nd Earl of Panmure. It was extensively repaired in 1775 and enlarged considerably by Fox Maule in 1851.

Barry Parish was founded in 1230 when Alexander II bequeathed the land to Balmerino Abbey. The earliest record of a church at Barry is from 1243 when the parish church was consecrated by David de Bernham, Bishop of St Andrews (1238–1252). The building that was Barry Parish Church up until the 1950s was built in 1800 on the site of an earlier building that was described as being &quot;old and sorry&quot;. All that remains of Barry Parish Church now is the lower portion of its walls and its kirkyard.

The first two churches within the town of Carnoustie were built in 1810 by two rival branches of the Secession Church, which had split from the Established Church in 1733 over the issue of patronage. The Anti-Burghers demolished the church they had built in 1789 near Grange of Barry Farm to rebuild it nearer the expanding village of Carnoustie. The &#x27;Red Kirk&#x27;, as it was known, was situated at Rye Park, where Thistle Street now stands. The Burghers, built their church the same year in Kinloch Street. This church later went through a series of Unions with other churches, becoming part of the United Original Secession Church in 1822 and the Free Church in 1852.

Barry Parish Church proved insufficient to house the rapidly expanding population of the parish and the refusal of the Heritors to fund its enlargement led to the building of Carnoustie church in 1837. This building was situated on the south side of Dundee street at the site on which now stands the Army and Air Cadets building. The &quot;quoad sacra&quot; parish was assigned to the church by the Presbytery of Arbroath in 1838.

The Disruption of 1843 had a profound effect on the town. A small Free Church was set up at the east end of Barry, and was replaced by a larger building in 1888, which continues as Barry Church today. The Free Church took over Carnoustie Church, and eventually built a second church immediately adjacent to it in 1850 when the Established Church claimed ownership of the building. This new building was later to become known as St Stephen&#x27;s church. The school associated with the new Free Church, The Philip Hall, is still in existence and is now used by Carnoustie Church as their church hall. In 1854, the part of the congregation of Panbride Church that had joined the Free Church built what became Newton Church at Gallowlaw after several years of being housed in a wooden building on Westhaven Farm. The building was damaged by fire in 1887 and rebuilt to a larger design.

In 1873, the congregation of the Red Kirk, which had now become part of The United Presbyterian Church, again demolished their church and, in part, used the material to build The Erskine Church on the North side of Dundee Street. This, along with St Stevens Free Church, the Free Church in Kinloch Street, Barry Free Church and Newton of Panbride Church became part of the United Free Church when the United Presbyterians and Free Church merged in 1900.

The Scottish Episcopal Church traces its history in Carnoustie to 1853 when it began meeting in an old Schoolhouse off Maule Street. It was formed into a congregation in 1877, which rapidly outgrew its premises, leading to the building of The Church of The Holyrood in 1881, the former building becoming the church hall. The church building was graded as a Category B listed building in 1971

In 1901, the established Church of Scotland built a new church, St Brides Chapel, on Carlogie Road for the burghal part of Panbride parish. This building became redundant as a place of worship in 1929 when the congregations of the Free church and Established church united, and it served for a while as the Church hall, until it was sold to the Boys Brigade in 1952. Carnoustie Church built its new, larger church in 1902, opposite its former site. This building continues today to house the congregation of Carnoustie Church. The congregations of Carnoustie Church and St Stephen&#x27;s merged in 1969, with St Stephen&#x27;s being demolished to make way for the new Health Centre.

On unification of the United Free Church with the Established Church in 1929, St Stephens and The Erskine Church&#x27;s congregations merged, using St Stephen&#x27;s as a home. The Erskine Church was sold, and since then has variously been a cinema, snooker club and pub. Those that did not agree with reunification with the Established Church formed a congregation as part of The United Free Church (Continuing), first finding a home in the YMCA building, later buying the Original Secession Church in Kinloch Street in 1934. The two churches in Barry finally completed their move to the former Free Church site in the 1950s.

The congregations of Panbride Church and Newton of Panbride Church united in 1956 and those of Carnoustie Church and Barry Church in 2003.

The Carnoustie Christian Fellowship was an independent congregation meeting in a converted former Co-op building opposite the War Memorial. They were linked to a charismatic Christian movement known as the International Association of Healing Rooms. This congregation ceased meeting in 2011 and ownership of the building was transferred to a church plant from Dundee&#x27;s Central Baptist Church that took the name of Carnoustie Community Church.

=== Religion today ===

The Church of Scotland today has three congregations that meet in Carnoustie. Carnoustie Church and Barry Church are linked under one minister, Rev. Michael Goss. During the months of July and August, they meet together in each church on alternate months. Carnoustie Panbride church meet at Newton Church during Winter months and Panbride in the Summer. The minister since January 2018 is Rev. Annette Gordon.

The Episcopalian congregation continues to meet at Holyrood church on the corner of Maule Street and Holyrood Street. The church is part of the Anglican Diocese of Brechin. Services are led by an interim pastor, Rev. John Cuthbert. Holyrood church and Holy Trinity Church in Monifieth are no longer linked. Holyrood&#x27;s origins can be traced to a summer mission established in 1864, which was organised a formal mission 12 years later. Built as the Church of the Holy Rood in 1881, the charge became an incumbency in 1898. Its archives are held by the University of Dundee.

The Roman Catholic Church meets in the modern (built 2000) building of St Anne&#x27;s Church in Thomas Street. This replaced the much smaller building the congregation had previously used in Dundee Street. The congregation is linked with St Bride&#x27;s in Monifieth and St Thomas&#x27; in Arbroath. The church is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dunkeld.

The Carnoustie Erskine United Free Church of Scotland meet at the former Original Secession Church on Kinloch street, and the Minister there is the Rev Douglas Campbell.

The Carnoustie Community Church is baptist congregation meeting in a converted former Co-op building opposite the War Memorial named &#x27;The Bridge&#x27;. This congregation began in 2011 as a church plant from Dundee&#x27;s Central Baptist Church initially meeting in hotels before moving into the building vacated by the Carnoustie Christian Fellowship. The pastor is Dr John Toller.

== Sport ==

=== Golf ===
Carnoustie is famous for golf, which is first recorded as having been played here in the 16th century. Carnoustie Golf Links has three golf courses: the Championship course, on which several international tournaments are held, the Burnside course and the Buddon course.

Carnoustie Golf Links is one of the venues in The Open Championship&#x27;s rotation. The course first played host to The Open in 1931, when it was won by Tommy Armour of the US. Subsequent winners have included Henry Cotton of England in 1937, Ben Hogan of the US in 1953, Gary Player of South Africa in 1968, Tom Watson of the US in 1975, Paul Lawrie of Scotland in 1999, Pádraig Harrington of Ireland in 2007, and Francesco Molinari of Italy in 2018.

The 1999 Open Championship is best remembered for the epic collapse of French golfer Jean van de Velde, who needed only a double-bogey six on the 72nd hole to win the Open—and proceeded to shoot a triple-bogey seven, tying with Paul Lawrie and 1997 champion Justin Leonard at 290, six over par. Lawrie won the playoff and the championship. With several experienced players running into difficulties on the course that year, the media responded by dubbing the course &#x27;Carnasty&#x27;.

Carnoustie is also one of the three hosts of the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, along with The Old Course at St Andrews and Kingsbarns.

In the early part of the 20th century, an estimated 300 golfers from Carnoustie emigrated to the United States, and were instrumental in the development of the sport there. When the Professional Golfers&#x27; Association of America was founded in 1916, nearly half of the 82 professional members were from Carnoustie.

The archives of Carnoustie Golf Club are held at the University of Dundee.

=== Football ===
Carnoustie is home to the junior football club Carnoustie Panmure F.C. Formed in 1936, they are nicknamed the Gowfers due to the town&#x27;s well-established links to the sport of golf (&quot;gowf&quot; in Scots). They play at Laing Park, to which they moved in 2004, having previously played at Westfield Park.

The club received significant investment in the late 1990s, which has allowed them to emerge as one of the stronger Tayside clubs participating in the East Region. The pinnacle of their achievements was winning the Scottish Junior Cup in 2004.

The club plays in the Scottish Junior Football Association&#x27;s East Region Premier League.

Carnoustie Panmure Youth FC, formed in 1979, is one of the biggest youth football clubs in the Tayside area, running football teams for boys from 9s to Under 19s level in the Dundee &amp; District Youth Football Association league. In 2012 the club formed a Football Academy for boys &amp; girls aged 5 to 8 years.

Carnoustie is represented by amateur football team Craws Nest.

In 2012 the main football clubs in Carnoustie came together to form Carnoustie Panmure FC as Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation. The current members are Carnoustie Panmure FC, Carnoustie YM AFC, Carnoustie Panmure Youth FC and Monifieth Ladies FC. The aim of the SCIO is to develop the Player Pathway and to provide better facilities for football in the area. In 2013 the joint club became the first to receive the Scottish FA Legacy Club Award in the SFA East Region.

=== Rugby ===
The town also has a thriving rugby club, Carnoustie HSFP, based at their clubhouse on Links Parade. The first XV team play in Division 2 (Midlands Section) of the Caledonia Regional League.

== Public services ==
Carnoustie and the surrounding area is supplied with water by Scottish Water. Water was supplied from Crombie reservoir until 1981. Since then, along with Dundee and parts of Perthshire, Angus has been supplied from Lintrathen and Backwater reservoirs in Glen Isla. Electricity distribution is by Scottish Hydro Electric plc, part of the Scottish and Southern Energy group.

Waste management is handled by Angus Council. There is a kerbside recycling scheme that has been in operation since May 2006. Cans, glass, paper and plastic bottles are collected on a weekly basis. Compostable material and non-recyclable material are collected on alternate weeks. Roughly two thirds of non-recyclable material is sent to landfill at Angus Council&#x27;s site at Lochhead, Forfar and the remainder sent for incineration (with energy recovery) outside the council area.

A recycling centre is located at Balmachie Road. Items accepted include, steel and aluminium cans, cardboard, paper, electrical equipment, engine oil, fridges and freezers, garden waste, gas bottles, glass, liquid food and drinks cartons, plastic bottles, plastic carrier bags, rubble, scrap metal, shoes and handbags, spectacles, textiles, tin foil, wood and yellow pages. Angus council publishes details of where and how each product is processed. There are also glass banks at the Co-op and Craws Nest car parks. The Angus Council area had a recycling rate of 34.7% in 2007/08.

Healthcare is supplied in the area by NHS Tayside. The nearest hospitals with accident and emergency departments are Arbroath Infirmary and Ninewells Hospital, Dundee. Primary Health Care in Carnoustie is supplied by Carnoustie Medical Group which is based at Parkview Health Centre on Barry Road, opened in May 2006. Carnoustie, along with the rest of Scotland is served by the Scottish Ambulance Service.

Law enforcement is provided by Tayside Police and Carnoustie is served by Tayside Fire and Rescue Service. The Police Station is located at 5 North Burnside Street in Carnoustie.

== Twin town ==
Carnoustie is twinned with Maule, approximately 50 km west of Paris, due to Carnoustie and the surrounding area&#x27;s long association with the Maule Family.

== Notable people ==
The 16th-century philosopher and historian, Hector Boece, was a member of the Boyce family that owned parts of Panbride parish at that time and is thought to have lived there.

Two streets in Carnoustie are named after Victoria Cross winners. Lance Corporal Charles Jarvis, Royal Engineers, was a resident of Carnoustie from 1889 until he joined the army in 1899. He was one of five men awarded the medal three weeks after the outbreak of Great War, for his role in destroying a bridge under heavy fire during the Battle of Mons on 23 August 1914. Petty Officer George Samson of the Royal Naval Reserve was born in Carnoustie in 1889, and awarded the medal for multiple acts of gallantry during the landings at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915, during which he rescued a number of his colleagues and treated their injuries under fire, before himself being hit by machine gun fire, sustaining 19 bullet wounds. His medals were sold at auction in 2007 for £247,000 to Lord Ashcroft.

The actor Ian McDiarmid, best known for his recurring role as Emperor Palpatine in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series of films, is a native of Carnoustie, where he lived before moving to Dundee as a child.

Alan Cumming, who has played starring roles in major films such as &quot;GoldenEye&quot; and &quot;X2: X-Men United&quot;, lived on Panmure Estate, to the north of Carnoustie, and attended Carnoustie High School.

Iain Macmillan, photographer, notably of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Abbey Road&quot; album cover, was born in Carnoustie and moved back there in the 1980s.

The Canadian-based poet, Stephen Scobie, was originally from Carnoustie.

A two-time winner of the U.S. Open golf championship, Alex Smith, was born in Carnoustie in 1874 and learned to play there before emigrating to the United States.

Jimmy Lawson was a professional footballer with Dundee before emigrating to the United States to become a golfer – two brothers Fred and Herbert did likewise.

Liz McColgan (born Elizabeth Lynch) is a runner, coach and Olympic athlete who lived on the outskirts of Carnoustie. At the 1988 Summer Olympic Games in Seoul, she was the Silver Medallist for the 10,000 metres. She captured the gold medal for the 10,000 metres at the 1991 World Championships in Athletics held in Tokyo. She also was the women&#x27;s champion for the 1991 New York City Marathon, the 1992 Tokyo Marathon and the 1996 London Marathon. She is a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE).

Fred Martin, who was goalkeeper for Aberdeen F.C. from 1946 to 1960 and who was in goal for Scotland&#x27;s 1954 World Cup squad, was born in Carnoustie and played for Carnoustie Panmure in his early career.

<text>Drosophyllum ( , ) is a genus of carnivorous plants containing the single species Drosophyllum lusitanicum, commonly known as Portuguese sundew or dewy pine. In appearance, it is similar to the related genus &quot;Drosera&quot; (the sundews), and to the much more distantly related &quot;Byblis&quot; (the rainbow plants).

==Description==

&quot;Drosophyllum lusitanicum&quot; is a perennial carnivorous plant with woody stems at the base, short, simple or rarely branched, tortuous or erect. Leaves are basal in a dense rosette, sessile, linear, sheathed, circinate, covered with sessile and pedunculated glands. The caulines are sessile, alternate, the upper bracteiform. Flowers are on top, racemiform or corymbiform and bear five yellow petals. The flower calyx has five lobes and is late deciduous. The plant has ten stamens and introrsal anthers. Gynoecium has five carpels. It has five styles, simple; capitate stigma. Fruit is in a unilocular capsule, and is partially divided into five locules, with irregular dehiscence by 3-5 teeth. Seeds are pear-shaped and rough, in diameter.

The glandular leaves, which uncoil from a central rosette, lack the power of movement common to most sundews, but have the unusual characteristic of coiling &#x27;outward&#x27; when immature (outward circinate vernation). Seed germination may be aided by scarification.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Drosophyllum lusitanicum&quot; is native to the western Mediterranean region, through Portugal, southwest Spain and northern Morocco), and is one of the few carnivorous plants to grow in dry soil. It grows mainly in clearings of scrub (mainly heather), pine forests, evergreen forests (e.g. open cork oak) and sunny heaths. In dry places and silicon, gravel or shale substrates, somewhat disturbed. It is a strictly calcific species, from sea level up to in altitude.

==Ecology==

The plant has a distinct sweet aroma, which attracts the insects upon which it preys. When insects land on the leaves, they find themselves stuck to the mucilage secreted by the stalked glands on the leaves. The more the insects struggle, the more ensnared they become, ultimately dying of suffocation or exhaustion. The plant then secretes enzymes which dissolve the insects and release the nutrients, which are then absorbed by the plant. The plant uses these nutrients to supplement the nutrient-poor soil in which it grows.

The genus had always been assumed to be closely allied to &quot;Drosera&quot;, and was previously placed in the Droseraceae. Recent molecular and biochemical studies, however, place it in the monotypic Drosophyllaceae, as recommended by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, and allied with the Dioncophyllaceae (&quot;Triphyophyllum&quot;) and Ancistrocladaceae.

==Classification==
The APG system (1998) and APG II system (2003) assign Drosophyllaceae to the order Caryophyllales in the clade core eudicots. &quot;D. lusitanicum&quot; had previously always been included in the family Droseraceae, as it catches insects with a method reminiscent of that used by many plants in that family.

Recent molecular and biochemical evidence (see the AP-Website) suggests the carnivorous taxa in the order Caryophyllales (the families Droseraceae, Drosophyllaceae, Nepenthaceae, and the species &quot;Triphyophyllum peltatum&quot;) all belong to the same clade, which does not consist only of carnivorous plants, but also includes some noncarnivorous plants, such as those in the family Ancistrocladaceae.

<text>Filippo Lippi ( – 8 October 1469), also known as Lippo Lippi, was an Italian Renaissance painter of the Quattrocento (fifteenth century) and a Carmelite priest. He was an early Renaissance master of a painting workshop, who taught many painters. Sandro Botticelli and Francesco di Pesello (called Pesellino) were among his most distinguished pupils. His son, Filippino Lippi, also studied under him and assisted in some late works.

== Biography ==
Lippi was born in Florence in 1406 to Tommaso, a butcher, and his wife. He was orphaned when he was two years old and sent to live with his aunt, Mona Lapaccia. Because she was too poor to rear him, she placed him in the neighboring Carmelite convent when he was eight years old. There, he started his education. In 1420, he was admitted to the novitiate of the Order of the Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel, known commonly as the Carmelites, at the priory of Santa Maria del Carmine in Florence, taking religious vows in the Order the following year, at the age of sixteen. He was ordained as a priest in approximately 1425 and remained in residence at the priory until 1432. Giorgio Vasari, the first art historian of the Renaissance, writes in his &quot;Lives of the Artists&quot; that Lippi was inspired to become a painter by watching Masaccio at work in the Carmine church. Lippi&#x27;s early work, notably the &quot;Tarquinia Madonna&quot; (Galleria Nazionale, Rome) shows the influence of Masaccio. Vasari writes of Lippi: &quot;Instead of studying, he spent all his time scrawling pictures on his own books and those of others.&quot; Due to Lippi&#x27;s interest, the prior decided to give him the opportunity to learn painting.

In 1432, Filippo Lippi quit the monastery, although he was not released from his vows. In a letter dated 1439 he describes himself as the poorest friar of Florence, charged with the maintenance of six marriageable nieces.

According to Vasari, Lippi then went on to visit Ancona and Naples, where he was captured by Barbary pirates and kept as a slave. Reportedly, his skill in portrait-sketching helped to eventually release him. Louis Gillet, writing for the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, considers this account and other details reported about Lippi, as &quot;assuredly nothing but a romance&quot;.

With Lippi&#x27;s return to Florence in 1432, his paintings had become popular, warranting the support of the Medici family, who commissioned the &quot;Annunciation&quot; and the &quot;Seven Saints&quot;. Cosimo de&#x27; Medici had to imprison him in order to compel him to work, and even then the painter escaped by a rope made of his sheets. His escapades threw him into financial difficulties from which he did not hesitate to extricate himself by forgery. His life included many similar tales of lawsuits, complaints, broken promises, and scandal.

In 1441, Lippi painted the altarpiece of the &quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot; for the nuns of Sant&#x27;Ambrogio. The painting shows the Virgin being crowned among angels and saints, including many Bernardine monks. One of these, placed to the right, is a half-length figure originally thought to be a self-portrait of Lippi, pointed out by the inscription &quot;is perfecit opus&quot; upon an angel&#x27;s scroll. Later, it was believed instead to be a portrait of the benefactor who commissioned the painting. The painting was celebrated in Robert Browning&#x27;s poem &quot;Fra Lippo Lippi&quot; (1855).

In 1452, Lippi was appointed chaplain to the nuns at the Monastery of Santa Maria Maddalena in Florence.
Fra Filippo is recorded as living in Prato (near Florence) in June 1456 to paint frescoes in the choir of the cathedral. In 1458, while engaged in this work, he set about creating a painting for the monastery chapel of Santa Margherita in that city, where he met Lucrezia Buti, a beautiful boarder or novice of the Order and the daughter of the Florentines Caterina Ciacchi and Francesco Buti. Lippi asked that she might be permitted to sit for the figure of the Madonna (or perhaps Saint Margaret). Lippi engaged in sexual relations with her and abducted her to his own house. She remained there despite efforts by the nuns to reclaim her. This relationship resulted in their son Filippino Lippi in 1457, who became a famous painter following his father, as well as a daughter, Alessandra, in 1465. Lucrezia is thought to be the model for many of Filippo Lippi&#x27;s paintings of the Madonna, as well as for Salome in one of his monumental works.

In 1457, he was appointed commendatory Rector (&quot;Rettore commendatario&quot;) of in Legnaia, from which institutions he occasionally made considerable profits. Despite these profits, Lippi struggled to escape poverty throughout his life.

The close of Lippi&#x27;s life was spent at Spoleto, where he had been commissioned to paint scenes from the &quot;Life of the Virgin&quot; for the apse of the cathedral. His son, Filippino, served as workshop adjuvant in the construction. In the semidome of the apse is the &quot;Coronation of the Virgin, with angels, sibyls, and prophets&quot;. This series, which is not wholly equal to the one at Prato, was completed after Lippi&#x27;s death by assistants under his fellow Carmelite, Fra Diamante.

Lippi died in Spoleto, on or about 8 October 1469. The mode of his death is a matter of dispute. It has been said that the pope granted Lippi a dispensation to marry Lucrezia, but before the permission arrived Lippi had been poisoned by indignant relatives of Lucrezia or, in another version, by relatives of someone who had replaced her in the painter&#x27;s affections.

== Works ==
The frescoes in the choir of the cathedral of Prato, which depict the stories of Saint Stephen and Saint John the Baptist on the two main facing walls, are considered Fra Filippo&#x27;s most important and monumental works, particularly the figure of Salome dancing, which has clear affinities with later works by Sandro Botticelli, his pupil, and Filippino Lippi, his son, as well as the scene showing the ceremonial mourning over Stephen&#x27;s corpse. This latter is believed to contain a portrait of the painter, but there are various opinions as to which is the exact figure. The figure of the dancing Salome in the scene of the Feast of Herod is believed to be a portrait of Lucrezia. On the end wall of the choir are Saint John Gualbert and Saint Alberto, while the vault has monumental representations of the four evangelists.

For Germiniano Inghirami of Prato he painted the &quot;Death of Saint Bernard&quot;. His principal altarpiece in this city is a Nativity in the refectory of San Domenico: the Christ child on the ground adored by the Virgin and Joseph, between Saints George and Dominic, in a rocky landscape, with the shepherds playing and six angels in the sky. A &quot;Vision of Saint Bernard&quot; is held in the National Gallery, London.

In the Uffizi is a fine painting of the Virgin, also called &quot;Lippina&quot;, adoring the infant Christ, who is held by two angels. The model for the Virgin is Lucrezia. A sometime lecturer at the gallery, the art historian Rocky Ruggiero identifies the painting as &quot;one of the most beautiful paintings of the Italian Renaissance&quot; and asserts that arguably, Lippi &quot;is the first Italian painter with a true sensibility for feminine beauty&quot;.

The painting of the &quot;Virgin and Child with an Angel&quot; also in the Uffizi is ascribed to Lippi, but that is disputed.
Filippo Lippi died in 1469 while working on the frescoes of scenes from the &quot;Life of the Virgin&quot; (1467–1469) in the apse of Spoleto Cathedral. The frescoes show the Annunciation, the Funeral of the Virgin, the Adoration of the Christ Child, and the Coronation of the Virgin. A group of bystanders depicted at the funeral includes a self-portrait of Lippi and his helpers, Fra Diamante and Pier Matteo d&#x27;Amelia, together with his son Filippino. Lippi was buried on the right side of the transept, with a monument commissioned by Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici.

Francesco di Pesello (called Pesellino) and Sandro Botticelli were among his most distinguished pupils who participated in his workshop.

<text>A big year is a personal challenge or an informal competition among birders who attempt to identify as many species of birds as possible by sight or sound, within a single calendar year and within a specific geographic area. Popularized in North America, big years are commonly carried out within a single U.S. state or Canadian province, or within larger areas such as the Lower 48 contiguous states, within the official American Birding Association (ABA) area, or sometimes the entire globe. The ABA big year record of 840 species was set by John Weigel of Australia in 2019. The big year world record of 6,852 species was set in 2016 by Arjan Dwarshuis of the Netherlands.

==History of North American big years==

The wide publication in 1934 of the first modern field guide by Roger Tory Peterson truly revolutionized birding. However, in that era, most birders did not travel widely. The earliest known continent-wide Big Year record was compiled by Guy Emerson, a traveling businessman, who timed his business trips to coincide with the best birding seasons for different areas in North America. During his best year, in 1939, he saw 497 species. In 1952, Emerson&#x27;s record was broken by Bob Smart, who saw 515 species.

In 1953, Roger Tory Peterson and James Fisher took a 30,000 mile road trip visiting the wild places of North America. In 1955, they told the story of their travels in a book and a documentary film, both called &quot;Wild America&quot;. In a footnote to the book, Peterson claimed &quot;My year&#x27;s list at the end of 1953 was 572 species.&quot; In 1956, a 25-year-old Englishman named Stuart Keith, following Peterson and Fisher&#x27;s route, compiled a list of 594 species, a record that stood for fifteen years.

The 1969 foundation of the American Birding Association standardized and regulated North American Big Years. The ABA Area was defined as the 49 continental U.S. states (excluding Hawaii), Canada, and the French islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, plus adjacent waters to a distance of 200 miles from land or half the distance to a neighboring country, whichever distance is less.

In 1971, 18-year-old Ted Parker, in his last semester of high school in southeastern Pennsylvania, extensively birded the eastern seaboard of North America. That September, Parker enrolled in the University of Arizona in Tucson and found dozens of Southwestern U.S. and Pacific coast specialties, ending the year with a list of 626 species.

In 1973, Kenn Kaufman and Floyd Murdoch both pursued Parker&#x27;s record. As recounted in Kaufman&#x27;s book &quot;Kingbird Highway&quot;, both broke the old record by a wide margin. Murdoch finished with 669 in the newly described ABA area to Kaufman&#x27;s 666. Murdoch&#x27;s record was broken in 1979 by James M. Vardaman, who saw 699 species that year and travelled 161,332 miles. Benton Basham, in 1983, topped Vardaman&#x27;s effort with 710 species. 1987 marked the second time that there was a competition during a single year, with Sandy Komito&#x27;s 722 species topping Steve Perry&#x27;s 711. In 1992, Bill Rydell made a serious attempt at the record and ended with 714 species for the year.

In 1998, three birders, Sandy Komito, Al Levantin, and Greg Miller, chased Komito&#x27;s prior record of 722 birds. In the end Komito kept the record, listing 745 species birds plus 3 submitted in 1998 and later accepted by state committees for a revised total of 748. Miller ended up with 715 species, and Levantin with 711. Mark Obmascik&#x27;s book about the 1998 big year birders was adapted into the 2011 20th Century Fox film &quot;The Big Year&quot;.

In 2008, Lynn Barber, at the time the Texas big year record holder, became the first woman to break the 700-species barrier with a total of 723. In 2010, North Carolina birder Chris Hitt became the first birder to see 700+ species in the lower 48 in a single year, finishing with 704. In the same year, Virginia birder Robert Ake ended the year with 731 species, an extraordinary total achieved without the benefit of the relatively unique weather effects of 1998.

In 2011, Colorado birder John Vanderpoel became the fastest birder on record to reach 700 species in a year. Ultimately he managed 743 birds, missing out on the record by five, but completing what was, at the time, the 2nd-biggest ABA year ever. Vanderpoel&#x27;s effort was the last made without the major contribution of eBird and birding groups on Facebook, which significantly enhanced the quality and quantity of rare bird alerts.

In 2013, Massachusetts birder Neil Hayward reluctantly decided to do an ABA big year. Hayward reached 700 species two weeks ahead of John Vanderpoel&#x27;s 2011 pace, and ended his year on 747 species plus 3 provisionals. Two provisionals later accepted by the ABA gave Hayward a final total of 749, which set a new ABA Big Year record.

In 2016, an unprecedented four birders attempted simultaneous ABA Area big years. A South Dakotan doctor birding as &quot;Olaf Danielson&quot; launched his &quot;Bad Weather Big Year&quot;, reaching 700 species in May. John Weigel, an Australian conservationist and Tasmanian devil activist, also launched his big year, called &quot;Birding for Devils.&quot; While not seeking to break the record, American birding activist and blogger Christian Hagenlocher&#x27;s &quot;The Birding Project&quot; aimed to attract more people to birding through a more social perspective. Hagenlocher, at age 27, also became the youngest person to break the 700-species barrier for an ABA big year. Photographer Laura Keene, conducting a 2016 photographic big year, broke Lynn Barber&#x27;s Big Year record for women in September. 2016 marked the first time four birders had each seen over 700 species in the ABA Area in a year. On 16 July 2016, Weigel saw his 750th species, a Buller&#x27;s shearwater, breaking Hayward&#x27;s previous record. All four birders would eventually surpass Hayward&#x27;s total.

In October 2016, the ABA voted to add the U.S. state of Hawaii to the countable area for ABA Big Years. All the 2016 big year birders except Hagenlocher birded Hawaii during November and December 2016, even though the &quot;New&quot; ABA checklist was not updated until November 2017. Olaf Danielson, partly due to efforts to promote bird conservation in Hawaii, incorporated Hawaii into his Big Year planning, keeping a list for the &quot;New ABA&quot; along with his Continental ABA list. John Weigel and Laura Keene subsequently birded Hawaii, with Weigel ending up with the highest total for the &quot;New ABA&quot; region (836), the Continental ABA region (784) and the United States (832). Danielson was close behind with 829 for the &quot;New ABA,&quot; while setting a new record for the Lower 48 States (723). Weigel was close with 721. Keene broke the previous record for photographed species with diagnostic photos of 792 species, and audio recordings of 10 others, out of her 815 total for the year.

2017 broke new ground, with five birders surpassing 700 species in the Continental ABA Area by September, and three breaking the 750-species barrier. Keene&#x27;s women&#x27;s record for the &quot;New ABA&quot; region was broken in 2017 by Yve Morrell. Also during 2017, Ruben and Victor Stoll became the first brothers to reach the 700 mark, and Richard and Gaylee Dean became the first married couple to reach 700.

In 2018, Nicole Koeltzow reached the 700-species milestone on July 1, while in August Gaylee and Richard Dean became the first birders to reach 700 species in consecutive years. On October 30, 2018, in Hawaii, Koeltzow became the 7th birder to reach the 800-species mark, and went on to set new ABA records for women birders. Also noteworthy in 2018 was the fact that Koeltzow and Dan Gesualdo became the 4th and 5th birders to identify 700+ species in the Lower 48 states. Gesualdo did so without a single airplane trip.

On July 4, 2019, John Weigel hit 700 for the second time, and on July 5 Gaylee and Richard Dean once again reached 700 species for the year, making them the first birders to top 700 species in the ABA Area three times. On top of that, the three years were done consecutively. At the end of July 2019 Weigel became the first birder to reach 750 species in more than one year. A trip to Alaska at the end of August 2019 allowed David and Tammy McQuade to become the 4th and 5th birders to reach 700 species during 2019. They joined the Deans as the only couples to accomplish the feat. With a trip to Maine in September Amanda Damin became the 6th birder to reach 700 for the year, an unprecedented occurrence in the history of ABA Big Years. 

In October 2019, Weigel became the first birder to have a second 800+ ABA Big Year, and Richard and Gaylee Dean became the 9th and 10th birders to have a 750+ ABA Big Year. In November 2019, David and Tammy McQuade became the 6th and 7th birders to identify 700+ species in the Lower 48, and in December 2019 Gaylee and Richard Dean became the 8th and 9th birders to accomplish that feat. A new ABA Big Year record was set on December 23, 2019, when John Weigel found a Steller&#x27;s Eider in Alaska, species #837 for the year. The same species also allowed Weigel to set a new record for a United States Big Year. At the close of the year he was at 836 for this category.

Big Years in 2020 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as tours to Alaska were cancelled, travel to and from Canada was almost non-existent, and the use of air travel was minimal. At age 21, Ben Sanders was the youngest birder to reach 680 for a Lower 48 (Contiguous) Big Year, and did it without a single airplane trip. David and Tammy McQuade had 735 species, all in the &quot;Lower 49&quot; (the Lower 48 + Hawaii). Their total of 692 for the Lower 48 tied for 13th best all-time. The highlight of the year was in the Contiguous 48 States category, where Jeremy Dominguez broke Danielson&#x27;s 2016 record; the Bar-tailed Godwit he had in Washington on December 29 was species #724 for the year.

Although the pandemic continued to affect Big Years in 2021, especially with regards to travel between the United States and Canada, five birders cracked the Top Ten for the Contiguous 48 States region. Most notably, on December 18 Tiffany Kersten tied the record for the Contiguous 48 States with Smith&#x27;s Longspur as #724. She followed it up by heading to Texas, where she got the Bat Falcon on the same day. Since the Bat Falcon was not yet listed on the ABA Checklist, she officially set the new record on December 23, with Northern Lapwing. She ended the year with 726 species. Charlie Bostwick had the 5th-highest Big Year for the ABA Region, the United States and the Contiguous 48 States. David McQuade, Tammy McQuade and Jason Vassallo also had exceptional Big Years for the Contiguous 48 States. With this, their third consecutive 700+ year, the McQuade&#x27;s matched the Deans as the only birders with three years with 700 or more species.

2022 was a notable year. In July, David and Tammy McQuade became the first birders to top 700 in four separate years. They also had the top list for the AOU Region (which includes Mexico and Central America), becoming the first birders to have the highest list in both the ABA and AOU during the same year. On July 22, Ruben and Victor Stoll had both Nelson&#x27;s and Saltmarsh Sparrows at Maine&#x27;s Scarborough Marsh, breaking Tiffany Kersten&#x27;s record for the Contiguous 48 States; they ended the year with 751 species. On October 19, Mark O&#x27;Keefe reached 700 for the ABA Region. The milestone bird was the Variegated Flycatcher in his home state of Michigan. O&#x27;Keefe ended the year with 706, while Nathan Goldberg had 702 for the ABA Region.

In 2023, for the first time, nine birders garnered over 700 species in the ABA Region. On July 30, 2023, David and Tammy McQuade reached 700 species for the fifth consecutive year. They ended the year with 798 species (plus one provisional: Cattle Tyrant). In addition to having the top ABA Big Year during 2023, they were also on top of the AOU year list for the second year in a row. Other birders who topped 700 species in the ABA Region included Gino Ellison (789 +1), Nick Komar (781 +1), Linus Blomqvist (761), Bud Younts (730 +1), Brenda and Jim Carpenter (715 +1; the third married couple to top 700), and Bill Kaempfer (708 +1). In the Continental ABA Region, the McQuades had 747 (+1), Ellison had 734 (+1), and Komar had 729 (+1). In the Lower 48 (Contiguous) Region, the McQuades had 704 (+1).

In July 2024 David and Tammy McQuade reached 700 species for the sixth consecutive year. They also had the top AOU list for the third year in a row. 19-year-old Ezekiel Dobson reached 700 in the Contiguous 48 States with a Flame-colored Tanager, becoming the first birder to join the 700 Club before the age of 20. Dobson ended the year with 758 (+1) species, all in the Contiguous 48 States, setting a new record for that category. Tim Ryan had the 5th-best Continental ABA, the 6th-best ABA and 10th-best US Big Years. Brenda and Jim Carpenter topped 700 in the ABA and US regions for the second year in a row, ending with 719 species. Ethan and Ingrid Whitaker also topped 700 for the Contiguous 48 States. 

==ABA Area big year rankings==

The ABA Area includes Canada, the 50 US states including Hawaii, the French islands of St. Pierre et Miquelon off Canada, and adjacent waters out to 200 nautical miles.

The provisional species for 2023 and 2024 is Cattle Tyrant.

==Continental ABA Area big year rankings==

This area is similar to the ABA Area (see above) but excludes Hawaii.
Prior to 2016 this was the &quot;ABA Area.&quot; All records predating 2016 are based on this definition.

The provisional species for 2023 and 2024 is Cattle Tyrant.

==United States big year rankings==

The provisional species for 2023 and 2024 is Cattle Tyrant.

The provisional species for 2023 and 2024 is Cattle Tyrant.

==World big years==

In 2008, British couple Alan Davies and Ruth Miller traveled around the world, seeing 4,341 species. In 2015, Oregon birder Noah Strycker launched a worldwide big year with the goal of seeing at least 5,000 species—roughly half of the world&#x27;s species—as he traveled around the globe. On September 16, in India, he broke Davies&#x27; and Miller&#x27;s existing record when he saw a Sri Lanka frogmouth for his 4,342nd species of the year. He finished the year with 6,042 bird species, his last species seen being an Oriental Bay Owl in Assam, India.

Strycker&#x27;s record faced an immediate challenge in 2016 when Dutch birder Arjan Dwarshuis launched an effort to break it as well as raise money for the Birdlife Preventing Extinctions Programme. On November 4, 2016, Dwarshuis saw a tody motmot in Panama, breaking Strycker&#x27;s previous record total. He finished the year with 6,852 seen bird species and this is the new World big year record.

Because Dwarshuis primarily used the IOC Checklist and Strycker the Clements Checklist, their totals are not fully compatible, as the IOC checklist lists a greater number of species. However, Dwarshuis and Strycker have both compiled checklists for each list.

Many world big year birders aim to minimize costs through a sponsorship, and their carbon footprint through a carbon offset program.

==Alternative big years==

Traditional big year birders have drawn criticism from environmentalists for failing to consider the ecological impact of their travel. Several birders have attempted &quot;green&quot;, or alternative big years to raise awareness for both birding and the environment. 
In 2005, two British cycling birders decided to have a competition. Chris Mills in Norfolk, England and Simon Woolley, Hampshire, England competed over who would see the most birds by cycling only and hence become the UK Green Year list record holder. Chris Mills won setting a record of 251 bird species.

Starting in the summer of 2007, teenager Malkolm Boothroyd and his parents, Ken Madsen and Wendy Boothroyd, attempted a big year without the use of fossil fuels by planning to bicycle over 10,000 miles to get over 400 species for the year. They started in their home province of the Yukon Territory, rode down the Pacific Coast, looping back around Arkansas to catch the Texas spring migration, then eastward to Florida. They dubbed this attempt a &quot;bird year,&quot; rather than a big year. In the end, they covered more than 13,000 miles by bicycle and tallied 548 species, raising more than $25,000 for bird conservation in the process.

2014 saw the first continent-wide &quot;green year&quot;, a big year executed with a minimum of environmental impact. In his rather extreme instance, Dorian Anderson bicycled 17,830 miles around the United States, amassing a self-powered, petroleum-free 618 species during his 365 days on America&#x27;s roads. Dorian visited 28 states (some twice) during his adventure and, beyond his species total, raised $49,000 for habitat conservation. He shunned all motorized transportation for the entire adventure, refusing even ferries that would have saved him sometimes hundreds of miles of riding around various bodies of water. He was hit by a car once, and almost hit several other times, but survived the entire year without major injury.

In 2021, Niky Carrera Levy and Mauricio Ossa, a couple of publicists and photographers made the first Big Year in Colombia, the country with the largest number of birds recorded in the world. They managed to record 1,471 species, the highest count of birds in one year in a single country. They traveled the 32 departments of Colombia in 21,974 miles. In addition to counting birds, they carried a message of conservation with the Colombian grebe, the only extinct species in Colombia and they got 789 children to take the oath of guardian of the birds.

<text>The Gambler is the sixth studio album by American singer Kenny Rogers, released by United Artists in November 1978. One of his most popular, it has established Rogers&#x27; status as one of the most successful artists of the 1970s and 1980s. The album reached many markets around the world, such as the Far East and Jamaica, with Rogers later commenting &quot;When I go to Korea or Hong Kong people say &#x27;Ah, the gambler!&#x27;&quot; (as per the sleeve notes to the 1998 released box set &quot;Through the Years&quot; on Capitol Records). The album has sold over 
5 million copies.

==History==
Rogers recorded the album at the Jack Clement Recording Studio in Nashville, Tennessee with producer Larry Butler.

The title track &quot;The Gambler&quot; was written by Don Schlitz, who was the first to record it. It was also covered by several other artists, but it was Kenny Rogers&#x27; adaptation of the tale that went on to top the country charts and won Rogers a Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in 1980, later becoming Rogers&#x27; signature song. Although Johnny Cash recorded the song first, Rogers&#x27; version was released first. Both this song and &quot;She Believes in Me&quot; became pop music hits, helping Rogers become well-known beyond country music circles. Although largely compiled from songs by some of the music business&#x27;s top songwriters, such as Alex Harvey, Mickey Newbury, and Steve Gibb, Rogers continued to show his own talent for songwriting with &quot;Morgana Jones&quot;.

In Britain, both the title cut and the album did very well in the country market, but both failed to reach the top 40 of the pop charts. In the 1980s the single of &quot;The Gambler&quot; was re-issued and made the top 100 sales list, but again charted outside the top 40. It wasn&#x27;t until the song was re-issued in 2007 when the song was adopted by the England Rugby Team at the Rugby World Cup that it charted at its #22 peak.

Its popularity has led to many releases over the years. After United Artists was absorbed into EMI/Capitol in 1980, &quot;The Gambler&quot; was reissued on vinyl and cassette on the Liberty Records label. Several years later, Liberty issued an abridged version of the album, removing the track &quot;Morgana Jones&quot;. EMI Manhattan Records released &quot;The Gambler&quot; on CD in the 1980s. An &#x27;Original Master Recording&#x27; from Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs was released on vinyl (audiophile edition vinyl). Finally, &quot;The Gambler&quot; was released on Rogers&#x27; own Dreamcatcher Records in 2001 as part of the Kenny Rogers &quot;Original Masters Series.&quot;

Additionally, &quot;I Wish That I Could Hurt That Way Again&quot; would later become a hit in 1986 for T. Graham Brown, whose version went to #3 on the country charts.

<doc id="871267" wikidata="Q717122" url="?curid=871267" title="Glove puppetry">
<text>Glove puppetry () is a type of opera using cloth puppets that originated during the 17th century in Quanzhou or Zhangzhou of China&#x27;s Fujian province, and historically practised in the Min Nan-speaking areas such as Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, the Chaoshan region of Guangdong, and other parts of southern China. It had since established itself contemporarily as a popular art form in Taiwan.

The puppet&#x27;s head uses wood carved into the shape of a hollow human head, but aside from the head, palms, and feet, which are made of wood, the puppet&#x27;s torso and limbs consist entirely of cloth costumes. At the time of the performance, a gloved hand enters the puppet&#x27;s costume and makes it perform. In previous years the puppets used in this type of performance strongly resembled &quot;cloth sacks,&quot; hence the name, which literally means &quot;cloth bag opera.&quot;

==Performances==

Glove puppetry (pò͘-tē-hì) performances, similar to some types of Chinese opera, are divided into a first half and a second half show. During the first half, known as the &quot;show platform&quot; (戲台), the audience is shown a demonstration by a master puppeteer on the stage. The second half consists of the puppet master, the orchestra, and the spoken parts. Several key points of a show to be appreciated include: the dexterity of the master puppeteer&#x27;s manipulation of the puppet, the accompaniment of the orchestra, and the poetic spoken parts of the voice actors. With few exceptions, from traditional pò͘-tē-hì to modern performances, human vocal music and operatic singing is rarely heard.

==In Indonesia==

In Indonesia, glove puppetry was popular within Chinese communities around Sumatra and Java. In Java, the interaction between Chinese and Javanese culture gave birth to new style of puppetry, called &quot;Peranakan Potehi&quot;. Today, glove puppetry is called with the term &quot;Wayang Potehi&quot; (Wayang means &quot;puppet&quot; in Javanese). The Wayang Potehi tradition is mainly preserved in Central Java (Semarang) and East Java&#x27;s () Chinese communities. Most of the dialog parts of Wayang Potehi have been narrated using Indonesian and Javanese language.

==In Taiwan==
In Taiwan Yunlin County is the center of glove puppetry with most major studios having a presence in the county.

Since 1984, Pili has been adding computer animations to their glove puppetry TV shows. Their shows continue to be popular, with the &quot;Thunderbolt Fantasy&quot; series being a collaboration with Gen Urobuchi that combines Pili style glove puppetry with anime style narrative.

<doc id="871268" wikidata="Q161174" url="?curid=871268" title="Sarracenia">
<text>Sarracenia ( or ) is a genus comprising 8 to 11 species of North American pitcher plants, commonly called trumpet pitchers. The genus belongs to the family Sarraceniaceae, which also contain the closely allied genera &quot;Darlingtonia&quot; and &quot;Heliamphora&quot;.

&quot;Sarracenia&quot; is a genus of carnivorous plants indigenous to the eastern seaboard of the United States, Texas, the Great Lakes area and southeastern Canada, with most species occurring only in the south-east United States (only &quot;S. purpurea&quot; occurs in cold-temperate regions). The plant&#x27;s leaves have evolved into a funnel or pitcher shape in order to trap insects.

The plant attracts its insect prey with secretions from extrafloral nectaries on the lip of the pitcher leaves, as well as a combination of the leaves&#x27; color and scent. Slippery footing at the pitcher&#x27;s rim causes insects to fall inside, where they die and are digested by the plant with proteases and other enzymes.

==Description ==
&quot;Sarracenia&quot; are herbaceous perennial plants that grow from a subterranean rhizome, with many tubular pitcher-shaped leaves radiating out from the growing point, and then turning upwards with their trap openings facing the center of the crown. The trap is a vertical tube with a &#x27;hood&#x27; (the operculum) extending over its entrance; and below it the top of the tube usually has a rolled lip (the peristome) which secretes nectar and scents. The hood itself frequently produces nectar too, but in lesser quantities.

The inside of the pitcher tube, depending on the species, can be divided into three to five distinguishable zones: zone 1 is the operculum (or hood), zone 2 is the peristome and rest of the trap entrance, while zones 3 and 4 (which in some species are combined) and 5 (only present in &quot;S. purpurea&quot;) are further divisions of the actual tube. Each of these zones has a specific function, with corresponding morphophysiological characteristics.

*Zone 1: &quot;Operculum&quot;. In most species the operculum covers at least part of the pitcher has an opening, preventing rain from excessively filling the pitcher, which would result in the loss of prey and dilute the digestive fluid. The operculum also serves to guide prey to the pitcher opening, using a combination of color, scent, and downward-pointing hairs to lead insects toward the trap entrance. Some species, specifically &quot;S. minor&quot; and &quot;S. psittacina&quot;, have opercula that hang low over the pitcher entrance. These are also studded with chlorophyll-free patches, translucent &quot;windows&quot; which confuse prey into attempting to fly through the operculum, thereby causing them to cascade down the pitcher tube. (A similar, better-developed mechanism is found in the closely related &quot;Darlingtonia californica&quot;).
*Zone 2: &quot;Peristome and trap entrance&quot;. This zone is composed mainly of the peristome, which produces copious amounts of nectar, luring insect prey to land or crawl onto the perilous footing surrounding the pitcher trap. This zone also includes the waxy upper portion of the pitcher tube. Footing on this zone is especially treacherous, as the waxy deposits on surface of this zone cause unwary insects to lose their footing and tumble into the pitcher depths.
*Zone 3: Located below Zone 2, this zone features a leaf surface with non-existent footing, as well as a coating of ultra-fine, downward pointing hairs. Insects that have made it this far lose any chance of escape. It is also studded with digestive glands, which secrete digestive enzymes into the digestive fluid.
*Zone 4: This is the final zone in most species. It is filled with digestive fluids, and readily absorbs nutrients released from the insects by the work of the digestive enzymes and bacteria in the pitcher fluid. Along with more digestive glands, this zone features a thick coating of coarse downward pointing hairs, which makes escape from the digestive fluids impossible.
*Zone 5: This zone, located below Zone 4 and found only in &quot;S. purpurea&quot;, is smooth, glabrous, lacks glands, and does not serve as an absorptive zone. Its function is unknown.

===Carnivorous mechanism===

All &quot;Sarracenia&quot; trap insects and other prey without the use of moving parts. Their traps are static and are based on a combination of lures (including color, scent, and nectar) and inescapability – typically the entrances to the traps are one-way by virtue of the highly adapted features listed above.

Most species use a combination of scent, waxy deposits (to clog insect feet) and gravity to topple insect prey into their pitcher. Once inside, the insect finds the footing very slippery with a waxy surface covering the walls of the pitcher. Further down the tube, downward-pointing hairs make retreat impossible, and in the lowest region of the tube, a pool of liquid containing digestive enzymes and wetting agents quickly drowns the prey and begins digestion. The exoskeletons are usually not digested, and over the course of the summer fill up the pitcher tube.

Only &quot;S. purpurea&quot; normally contains significant amounts of rainwater in its tubular pitchers. It is a myth that all species contain water. In fact, the hoods of the other species help to keep out rain water in addition to keeping flying prey from escaping.

&quot;S. psittacina&quot;, the parrot pitcher, uses a lobster-pot style trap that will admit prey (including tadpoles and small fish during floods) but not allow it to find its way out; and sharp inward-pointing hairs force the victim gradually down to the base of the pitcher where it is digested.

====Potential narcotic function of coniine====
Coniine, a toxic alkaloid also present in poison hemlock, was first detected in the nectar of &quot;S. flava&quot;. and has since been detected in 7 other species of &quot;Sarracenia&quot;. While it was demonstrated that concentrated extracts from &quot;S. flava&quot; could paralyze ants, it has not been demonstrated that coniine has narcotic effects on insects at the concentrations naturally present in pitchers of &quot;S. flava&quot;. Other authors hypothesize that coniine may function as an attractant for insects, or may function both as an attractant and a narcotic.

===Flowers and seeds===

Flowers are produced early in spring, with or slightly ahead of the first pitchers. They are held singly on long stems, generally well above the pitcher traps to avoid the trapping of potential pollinators. The flowers, which depending on species are 3–10 centimeters in diameter, are dramatic and have an elaborate design which prevents self-pollination. It consists of five sepals superintended by three bracts, numerous anthers, and an umbrella-like five-pointed style, over which five long yellow or red petals dangle. The whole flower is held upside-down, so that the umbrella-like style catches the pollen dropped by the anthers. The stigmas are located at the tips of the umbrella-like style. The primary pollinators are bees. Bees searching for nectar must force their way past one of the stigmas to enter the chamber formed by the style. Inside, they will inevitably come in contact with a lot of pollen, both from the hanging anthers and from the pollen collected by the style. Upon exiting, the bees must force their way under one of the flap-like petals. This keeps them away from the stigma, avoiding self-pollination. The next flower visited receives on its stigmata some of the first flower&#x27;s pollen, and the cycle continues.
Floral formula: Ca5 Co5 A∞ G(5)

The flowers of almost all species are scented. The scent varies, but is often strong and sometimes unpleasant. &quot;S. flava&quot; has an especially strong odor resembling cat urine.

Flowers generally last about two weeks. At the end of the flowering period, the petals drop and the ovary, if pollinated, begins to swell. The seed forms in five lobes, with one lobe producing significantly smaller numbers of seeds than the other lobes. On average, 300–600 seed are produced, depending on species and pollination success. Seed takes five months to mature, at which point the seed pod turns brown and splits open, scattering seed. The seeds are 1.5–2 mm in length and have a rough, waxy coat which makes it hydrophobic, possibly for seed dispersal by flowing water. &quot;Sarracenia&quot; seed requires a stratification period to germinate in large numbers. Plants grown from seed start producing functioning traps almost immediately, although they differ in morphology from adult traps for the first year or so, being simpler in structure. Plants require 3–5 years to reach maturity from seed.

===Growth cycle===
Pitcher production begins at the end of the flowering period in spring, and lasts until late autumn. At the end of autumn, the pitchers begin to wither and the plants produce non-carnivorous leaves called phyllodia, which play a role in the economics of carnivory in these species. Since the supply of insects during winter is decreased, and the onset of cold weather slows plant metabolism and other processes, putting energy into producing carnivorous leaves would be uneconomical for the plant.

===Genetics===
The genus has been found to have a Chromosome number of &quot;2n&quot;=26, though some earlier studies had found that number to be &quot;2n&quot;=24.

==Range and habitat==

Seven of the eight species are confined to the south-eastern coastal plain of the United States. One species, &quot;S. purpurea&quot;, continues north and west well into Canada. The typical habitat is warm-temperate; all &quot;Sarracenia&quot; are perennial and require a distinct summer and winter. A few subspecies or varieties (&quot;S. rubra&quot; subsp. &quot;alabamensis&quot;, &quot;S. rubra&quot; subsp. &quot;jonesii&quot;, and &quot;S. purpurea&quot; var. &quot;montana&quot;) can be found more inland in mountains (e.g. the Appalachian Mountains).

&quot;Sarracenia&quot; tend to inhabit fens, herb bogs, and seasonally wet grasslands. These habitats tend to be acidic (low pH) with soil made up of sand and &quot;Sphagnum&quot; moss. Frequently, the soil will be poor in nutrients, particularly nitrates, and often continuously leached by moving water or made unavailable to the plant roots by the low pH. The plants gain their advantage from their ability to extract nutrients from insect prey in this mineral-poor environment. The plants prefer strong, direct sunlight with no shade. &quot;Sarracenia&quot; habitats in the southeastern Coastal Plain consist primarily of fire-maintained pine savannas, wet prairies, or seepage bogs. Without frequent fire (1–3 years), these habitats undergo ecological succession and are quickly invaded by woody shrubs and trees, which eliminate &quot;Sarracenia&quot; by increasing shade and reducing soil moisture.

In several cases, carnivorous plant enthusiasts have introduced &quot;S. purpurea&quot; into suitable habitats outside of its natural range, where it has naturalized. Some of these populations are decades old; the oldest known occurrence in the Swiss Jura mountains is around one hundred years old. Besides Switzerland, such naturalized populations can be found in Ireland, England (Lake District), Germany (Bavaria, Lusatia) and in Mendocino County along the California coast.

==Environmental status==
&quot;Sarracenia&quot; are threatened in the wild by development and the drainage of their habitat. Estimates indicated that 97.5% of &quot;Sarracenia&quot; habitat has already been destroyed in the southeastern U.S., the home of all but one subspecies of &quot;Sarracenia&quot;. Currently the biggest threats to surviving populations are urban development, drainage of habitat for forestry, runoff of herbicides from agriculture, fire suppression, cut pitcher trade for floristry, and plant trade. The latter two threaten survival of &quot;Sarracenia&quot; not only through depletion of healthy population, but also because of the damaging effects (soil compaction and altered moisture levels) of repeated foot and vehicular traffic that comes with harvesting. The Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that approximately 1.6 million pitchers were cut for the domestic market in 1991. 
Some protective legislation exists. Several southeastern states, such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina have conservation laws which protect &quot;Sarracenia&quot;. However, most of the remaining wetlands in the southeastern U.S. are privately owned. Plants on this land are not protected by state legislation. The key states of Alabama and Mississippi have no such legislation at all, so that even plants on public land have no protection. Three &quot;Sarracenia&quot; have been listed as &quot;Federally Endangered&quot; under the USA Endangered Species Act (1973) – &quot;S. rubra&quot; subsp. &quot;alabamensis&quot; (&quot;S. alabamensis&quot;) in Alabama, &quot;S. rubra&quot; subsp. &quot;jonesii&quot; (&quot;S. jonesii&quot;) in North and South Carolina, and &quot;S. oreophila&quot; in Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina. These taxa are also on CITES Appendix I, giving them international protection by making export of wild-collected plants illegal. The other species, while appearing on CITES Appendix II, have little federal protection.

Some efforts have been made to curb the existing threats to plants. In 2003 the International Carnivorous Plant Society ran a trial distribution program in which young &quot;S. rubra&quot; subsp. &quot;alabamanensis&quot; plants were grown from seed collected from 3 of the 12 known &quot;S. alabamanensis&quot; sites, and were distributed to members in an attempt to increase availability of this plant in cultivation, with the hopes of thereby decreasing the poaching that was endangering the survival of this taxon in the wild.

In 1995, the non-profit organization Meadowview Biological Research Station was created to preserve and restore pitcher plant bogs and associated ecosystems in Maryland and Virginia.

In 2004, a number of concerned plant enthusiasts founded the North American Sarracenia Conservancy (NASC), which aims to &quot;serve as a living record of the taxonomic, morphological and genetic diversity of the genus Sarracenia for purposes of conservation and cultivation.&quot; The NASC is a grassroots Nebraska nonprofit organization working to build a genetic &quot;Sarracenia&quot; bank by overseeing the maintenance of genetic strains from all remaining wild populations in cultivation, with the eventual aim of being able to supply these strains for re-introduction in suitable habitats. A similar but centralized collection exists in the UK, with 2000+ clones representing all species (many with location data) and numerous hybrids currently being housed by &quot;Sarracenia&quot; expert Mike King. This UK collection is part of the NCCPG National Plant Collection scheme. While none of these efforts curb the biggest threats – urban development and habitat destruction – they aim to help reduce plant poaching while at the same time making these plants available to future generations.

One of the biggest challenges of reintroducing plants back into the wild is the unintended introduction of unwanted species, such as pests, diseases, and invasive weeds. Often, it is human destruction of areas in which the Sarracenia thrive that is a major killer. Aside from determining what genetic material is appropriate for reintroduction (which is up for debate), plants must be semi-aseptic to keep the habitat pristine and sustainable in the long term. Another challenge is maintaining all of the introduced plant material and determining an optimal site to plant them in. A single hurricane or storm event can change the dynamics of a field. Even within a single bog, some areas may be waterlogged, while other areas may become very dry, so identifying the right location is critical. Short term results on private property indicate planting larger specimens into the field have a higher chance of long-term survival compared to planting smaller seedlings.

==Taxonomy==

The genus &quot;Sarracenia&quot; belongs to the family Sarraceniaceae, which also contain the closely allied genera &quot;Darlingtonia&quot; and &quot;Heliamphora&quot;. Under the Cronquist system, this family was put in the order Nepenthales along with Nepenthaceae and Droseraceae. The APG II system, however, assigns Sarraceniaceae to the order Ericales and the other two families to the order Caryophyllales.

Typically anywhere from 8 to 11 species of &quot;Sarracenia&quot; are generally recognized, depending on individual opinions on the biological species concept and which among many subspecies and varieties should be elevated to species status, a common lumping and splitting problem in demarcation. Some authorities split the described subspecific taxa of &quot;S. rubra&quot; into 3 to 5 species. Similarly, &quot;S. rosea&quot; is not always recognized as a species distinct from &quot;S. purpurea&quot;. The most commonly recognized species include:
Currently, &quot;S. rubra&quot; can be described as having six subspecies, though it is sometimes argued that the subspecies should be elevated to species rank in recognition of the species complex that they are a part of. This division would yield &quot;S. alabamensis&quot;, &quot;S. gulfensis&quot;, &quot;S. jonesii&quot;, &quot;S. rubra&quot; &quot;sensu stricto&quot;, &quot;S. viatorum&quot;, and &quot;S. wherryi&quot;. Others have argued that only some of these demand recognition at the species rank.

===Hybrids===
&quot;Sarracenia&quot; species hybridize and produce fertile offspring freely, making proper classification difficult. &quot;Sarracenia&quot; hybrids are able to hybridize further, giving the possibility of hundreds of different hybrids that have multiple species in varying amounts in their ancestry. Since many species ranges overlap, natural hybrids are relatively common. As a result, initial classification included many of these hybrids as separate species. A recent census of the number of hybrids and cultivars of &quot;Sarracenia&quot; species revealed about 100 unique hybrids and cultivars in cultivation. Many hybrids of &quot;Sarracenia&quot; are still commonly referred to by their obsolete species names, particularly in horticulture. These hybrids are all popularly cultivated by carnivorous plant enthusiasts, and there are consequently a huge number of hybrids and cultivars, most bred for showy pitchers.

Some of the more common named hybrids include:

* &quot;Sarracenia&quot; × &quot;catesbaei&quot; = &quot;S. flava&quot; × &quot;S. purpurea&quot;
* &quot;Sarracenia&quot; × &quot;moorei&quot; = &quot;S. flava&quot; × &quot;S. leucophylla&quot;

* &quot;Sarracenia&quot; × &quot;formosa&quot; = &quot;S. minor&quot; × &quot;S. psittacina&quot;

==Botanical history==

&quot;Sarracenia&quot; were known to Europeans as early as the 16th century, within a century of Christopher Columbus&#x27; &quot;discovery&quot; of the New World. L&#x27;Obel included an illustration of &quot;S. minor&quot; in his &quot;Stirpium Adversaria Nova&quot; in 1576. The first description and plate of a &quot;Sarracenia&quot; to show up in botanical literature was published by Carolus Clusius, who received a partial dried specimen of what was later determined to be &quot;S. purpurea&quot; subsp. &quot;purpurea&quot;, publishing it under the name &quot;Limonium peregrinum&quot;. The exact origins of this specimen remains unknown, as few explorers are known to have collected plant specimens from the range of this subspecies before that time. Cheek and Young suggest that the most likely source is Cartier&#x27;s expeditions to what is now Quebec between 1534 and 1541. The fragile flowerless specimen that made its way to Clusius 60 years later was enough to excite his interest, but not enough for him to place it among related plants; his closest guess was the wholly unrelated Sea Lavender genus.

The name &quot;Sarracenia&quot; was first employed by Michel Sarrazin, the Father of Canadian Botany who in the late 17th century sent live specimens of &quot;S. purpurea&quot; to the Parisian botanist Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, who thereupon described the species. Linnaeus adopted this name when he published his &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; (1753), using it for the two known species at the time: &quot;S. purpurea&quot; and &quot;S. flava&quot;. The first successful flowering in culture occurred in 1773. In 1793 William Bartram noted in his book about his travels in the southeast U.S. that numerous insects were caught in the pitchers of these plants, but doubted that any benefit could be derived from them. It was not until 1887 that research by Joseph H. Mellichamp proved the carnivorous nature of this genus. This finding was supported by a study by J.S. Hepburn, E.Q. St. John and F.M. Jones in 1920. Extended field surveys and laboratory studies by Edgar Wherry in the 1930s greatly increased the knowledge of this genus, which has further been extended by the more recent works of C. Ritchie Bell (1949–52), Donald E. Schnell (1970–2002), Frederick W. Case (1970–2000s), and T. Lawrence Mellichamp (1980s-2000s).

==Cultivation==

&quot;Sarracenia&quot; are considered easy to grow and are widely propagated and cultivated by gardeners and carnivorous plant enthusiasts. Several hybrids between the very hardy &quot;S. purpurea&quot; and showy species like &quot;S. leucophylla&quot; are becoming common in garden centers in North America and Europe.

&quot;Sarracenia&quot; require constantly moist-wet, nutrient free acidic soil. This is most often achieved with a potting mix consisting of peat moss mixed with sand or perlite. As their roots are sensitive to nutrients and minerals, only pure water, such as distilled, rain, or reverse osmosis water, can be used to water them. &quot;Sarracenia&quot; prefer sunny conditions during their growing season but require a dormancy period, with decreased light and temperatures, of a few months in the winter.

===Propagation===
&quot;Sarracenia&quot; do not self-pollinate and therefore require hand pollination or access to natural pollinators such as bees. &quot;Sarracenia&quot; pollen remains potent for several weeks when refrigerated, and so is stored by cultivators and used to pollinate later-flowering species. Given that all &quot;Sarracenia&quot; hybrids are fertile and will hybridize further, this characteristic allows cultivators to produce a limitless number of variants through hybridization.
The copious seeds store well if kept dry. In climates or seasons that cannot provide the cold, damp period of stratification required by the seeds for germination, growers mimic this condition by placing the seeds in a refrigerator for 2–6 weeks, depending on species. The seeds are sown on the surface of their substrate and germinate when transferred to warmer, bright conditions. &quot;Sarracenia&quot; seedlings all look alike for the first two or three years; the plants reach maturity after four or five years. Regular fertilization (twice a month between April and September) with a balanced fertilizer at the rate of 1 teaspoon per gallon (using a 15-16-17 peat-lite or similar fertilizer) will speed their growth and time to maturity. It is advisable to leach regularly with pure water to prevent the buildup of solutes (fertilizer salts) in the soil. Deep water in a potted plant keeps the soil too waterlogged for proper root functioning.

Mature &quot;Sarracenia&quot; are commonly propagated by division. Their rhizomes extend and produce new crowns of pitchers over the course of a few growing seasons, and cultivators divide and separate the rhizomes during the plant&#x27;s winter dormancy or early in the growing season. This technique is also used to separate sections of rhizomes which have no pitchers: when re-potted, the section usually generates a new crown of pitchers. A further technique is employed to encourage new crowns to appear which does not involve division of the rhizome: small notches up to 5 mm deep are cut into the top of the rhizome, whereupon a new crown frequently develops at the site of the notch.

<text>Quatermass (also known as Quatermass IV, or The Quatermass Conclusion for its limited international theatrical release) is a 1979 British television science fiction serial. Produced by Euston Films for Thames Television, it was broadcast on the ITV network in October and November 1979. Like its three predecessors, &quot;Quatermass&quot; was written by Nigel Kneale. It is the fourth and, to date, final television serial to feature the character of Professor Bernard Quatermass, this time played by John Mills.

Influenced by the social and geopolitical situation of the early 1970s and the hippie youth movement of the late 1960s, &quot;Quatermass&quot; is set in a near future in which large numbers of young people are joining a cult known as the Planet People who gather at prehistoric sites, believing they will be transported to a better life on another planet. The series begins with Professor Quatermass arriving in London to look for his granddaughter, Hettie Carlson, and witnessing the destruction of two spacecraft and the disappearance of a group of Planet People at a stone circle by an unknown force. He investigates this force, believing that Hettie may be in danger. As the series progresses, it becomes apparent that the Planet People are being harvested by an alien force rather than transported.

&quot;Quatermass&quot; was originally conceived as a BBC production, but after the corporation lost faith in the project because of spiralling costs, work was halted. The scripts were acquired by Euston Films and Kneale, who was commissioned to rewrite the scripts into two versions: a four-part television serial and &quot;The Quatermass Conclusion&quot;, a 100-minute film, intended for international theatrical release.

Despite ITV making the series its flagship premier for its 1979 autumn schedule, the four-part serial was met with lukewarm reviews. Reasons were blamed on the plot, casting and character development. The cinematic edited version, &quot;The Quatermass Conclusion&quot;, was given a limited release due to lack of interest from distributors.

===Development===
Professor Bernard Quatermass was created by Manx writer Nigel Kneale in 1953 for the serial &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;. Its success led to two sequels, &quot;Quatermass II&quot; (1955) and &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; (1958). These three &quot;Quatermass&quot; serials are seen today as seminal 1950s television productions. Kneale, however, became disenchanted with the BBC and went freelance in the late 1950s, producing scripts for Hammer Films and Associated Television.

The notion of bringing Professor Quatermass back for a fourth adventure dated back to at least 1965 when producer Irene Shubik asked Kneale to contribute a new &quot;Quatermass&quot; story for the first season of the science fiction anthology series, &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot;. Nothing came of this but the prospect of &quot;Quatermass&quot; making a reappearance arose again when, following the success of the film version of &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; in 1967, Hammer was in discussions with Kneale for a new &quot;Quatermass&quot; adventure. Again, this did not progress beyond the initial negotiation stage. In the meantime Kneale had been coaxed back to the BBC, writing plays such as &quot;The Year of the Sex Olympics&quot; (1968), &quot;Wine of India&quot; (1970) and &quot;The Stone Tape&quot; (1972). Following completion of &quot;The Stone Tape&quot;, Kneale was commissioned on 21 November 1972 by BBC head of drama serials, Ronnie Marsh, to write a new four-part Quatermass serial.

Assigned to produce the serial was &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot; producer Joe Waters. Preliminary filming on &quot;Quatermass&quot; began in June 1973 at Ealing Studios where special effects designer Jack Wilkie and his assistant, Ian Scoones shot model footage for part one of the serial, of a space station with astronauts working on its hull. At this point the BBC got cold feet about the project; it had become concerned about the cost of mounting the production and had been refused permission to film at Stonehenge, one of the locations at which Kneale had envisaged the Planet People would gather to be reaped by the alien force. Kneale recalled that Stonehenge &quot;had become Big Business and the place was like a factory with tourists there from dawn to dusk... they weren&#x27;t going to let anyone go near it&quot;. Kneale also felt that the BBC was unhappy with the script believing it &quot;didn&#x27;t suit their image at that time; it was too gloomy&quot;. In the end, it was decided during summer 1973 that for financial reasons the BBC would not proceed with the production. However the BBC still had an option on the script until 1975, and retained this until it expired.

At this stage Kneale was working primarily at ITV, having written the play &quot;Murrain&quot; (screened in the anthology series &quot;Against The Crowd&quot;, 1975) and the anthology series &quot;Beasts&quot; (1976) for ATV. In May 1977, Euston Films—a subsidiary of Thames Television best known for &quot;The Sweeney&quot; (1975–1978)—picked up Kneale&#x27;s unmade &quot;Quatermass&quot; scripts. This new production, known either as &quot;Quatermass&quot; or &quot;Quatermass IV&quot;, would consist of a four-part serial to be broadcast by ITV which would be recut as a 100-minute film, titled &quot;The Quatermass Conclusion&quot;, for release in North America and Europe. Kneale was dubious about having to craft both a television serial version and a film version of his tale, feeling that &quot;in the end we had two versions, neither of which was the right length for the story&quot;. During the rewrites, Kneale transplanted the action at the conclusion of part three from Stonehenge to the more easily available Wembley Stadium. When asked about what differences there were between the Euston Films version and the version originally envisaged for the BBC, Kneale remarked that &quot;the BBC version would have been much more in the studio, whereas the Euston Films version was entirely shot on 35mm film with a great deal of it outside. Much more lavish than either the BBC or I had contemplated&quot;.

===Writing===
Kneale began writing the scripts, working to a delivery deadline of February 1973. Much of the setting for the story was influenced by contemporary political events such as strikes, power cuts, the oil crisis and developments in the space race, especially the planned Apollo-Soyuz missions and Skylab. Writing in the listings magazine &quot;TV Times&quot; to promote the serial, Kneale said: &quot;&quot;Quatermass&quot; is a story of the future – but perhaps only a few years from now. There are some clues already in the most obvious places: the streets. Pavements littered with rubbish. Walls painted with angry graffiti. Belfast black with smoke and rage. Worst of all, the mindless violence&quot;. Concerns about the state of society, especially the &quot;dropout&quot; culture of the youth movement, had been a theme of Kneale&#x27;s writing for some time. This was seen in such works as &quot;The Big, Big Giggle&quot;, an unmade play about a teenage suicide cult; &quot;The Year of the Sex Olympics&quot;, about the consequences of a world with no censorship or inhibitions; and &quot;Bam! Pow! Zap!&quot; (1969), about teenage delinquents, all of which fed into the world depicted in the new &quot;Quatermass&quot; serial. Kneale said: &quot;I looked at the alarming aspects of contemporary trends. Since then, we&#x27;d seen &#x27;flower power&#x27; and hippies, so all I did was bring them into the story. It was written in 1972 and it was about the sixties really&quot;. Another theme that had crept into Kneale&#x27;s writing at this time—as seen in &quot;Wine of India&quot;, about compulsory euthanasia for the elderly, and later the &quot;Beasts&quot; episode &quot;During Barty&#x27;s Party&quot;, about an elderly couple terrorised by rats—was the consequences of growing old. Kneale later recalled: &quot;The theme I was trying to get to was the old redressing the balance with the young, saving the young, which I thought a nice, paradoxical, ironic idea after the youth-oriented 60s&quot;.

Following &quot;Quatermass&quot;, writer Nigel Kneale developed the sitcom &quot;Kinvig&quot; (1981) for London Weekend Television. During the 1980s he was courted for scripts by admiring Hollywood directors and producers such as John Carpenter, John Landis and Joe Dante, but with limited success. Returning to television, he adapted Susan Hill&#x27;s novel &quot;The Woman in Black&quot; (1989) and wrote episodes of &quot;Sharpe&quot; and &quot;Kavanagh QC&quot;. He died in 2006.

===Casting and crew===
John Mills was chosen to play Quatermass (the fourth different actor to play the role in four serials on television), who had appeared in significant roles in many high-profile British films, including &quot;The Way to the Stars&quot; (1945), &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1946) and &quot;Ice Cold in Alex&quot; (1958), and had won an Academy Award for his role in &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1970). Mills, whose only previous television credit at the time was &quot;The Zoo Gang&quot; (1974), was reluctant to take the part but was persuaded by his wife, who liked the script. Following &quot;Quatermass&quot; he appeared in &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982), &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; (1994) and &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1996), working right up to his death in 2005.

Joe Kapp was played by Simon MacCorkindale, who had previously appeared in &quot;Baby&quot;, one of the episodes of Nigel Kneale&#x27;s &quot;Beasts&quot; series. MacCorkindale was delighted with the part of Joe Kapp, finding it a break from the typecast romantic roles he was used to playing. Following &quot;Quatermass&quot;, MacCorkindale appeared in &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot; (1979), and subsequently moved to the United States where, after playing a few guest roles on television, he secured a part in &quot;Jaws 3&quot; (1983) and the lead in the short-lived series &quot;Manimal&quot; (1983). He was then a series regular in &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; (1984–86), &quot;Counterstrike&quot; (1990–93) and &quot;&quot; (1999). He then returned to the United Kingdom, where he played the character of Harry Harper in &quot;Casualty&quot; between 2002 and 2008. MacCorkindale died in 2010.

Barbara Kellerman, who played Claire Kapp, had previously had a regular role in &quot;1990&quot; (1977–78) and would later portray the White Witch in the BBC adaptation of &quot;The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe&quot; (1988).

&quot;Quatermass&quot; also featured many familiar faces from British television and film in supporting roles, including Margaret Tyzack, Bruce Purchase, James Ottaway, Brenda Fricker, David Yip, Kevin Stoney, Gretchen Franklin, Brian Croucher and Chris Quinten, as well as the singer (and later television presenter) Toyah Willcox.

Director Piers Haggard, who was the great-grand-nephew of author H. Rider Haggard, had been directing since the 1960s. Prior to &quot;Quatermass&quot;, he had directed the acclaimed Dennis Potter drama serial &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; (1978). Commenting on the script, Haggard described it as &quot;a tremendous re-assertion of the importance of people, ordinary people, and how necessary they are in fighting evil&quot;. Following &quot;Quatermass&quot;, he directed &quot;The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu&quot; (1980) and the Disney Channel TV series &quot;Return to Treasure Island&quot; (1985).

Executive producer Verity Lambert had first made her mark as producer of the first two years of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (1963). Since then she had carved out an impressive career, first at the BBC with programmes such as &quot;Adam Adamant Lives!&quot; (1966–67) and &quot;The Newcomers&quot; (1965–69), and then at Thames Television with productions such as &quot;The Naked Civil Servant&quot; (TV film; 1975) and the series &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot; (1978–92). She became Chief Executive of Euston Films in 1979; &quot;Quatermass&quot; was one of the first productions she oversaw in the role, seeing it as a project to make her mark on the company. She had clashed with Nigel Kneale in 1965 on the BBC arts programme &quot;Late Night Line-Up&quot;, when he attacked her for making &quot;Doctor Who&quot; too frightening for children. Despite this she held Kneale in high esteem, describing him as &quot;a fantastic writer... hugely imaginative... considering the impact his work has had, I think he&#x27;s undervalued&quot;. Following &quot;Quatermass&quot; she produced such shows as &quot;Danger UXB&quot; (1979), &quot;Minder&quot; (1979–85; 1988–94) and &quot;Widows&quot; (1983) for Euston before in 1985 forming her own production company, Cinema Verity, which oversaw programmes including &quot;G.B.H.&quot; (1991), &quot;Eldorado&quot; (1992–93) and &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot; (1997–2004). She was awarded the OBE in 2002. She died in 2007.

Producer Ted Childs had begun his career with Euston on &quot;Special Branch&quot; (1969–74) and had produced episodes of &quot;The Sweeney&quot; and its film spin-offs &quot;Sweeney!&quot; (1977) and &quot;Sweeney 2&quot; (1978). Childs saw &quot;Quatermass&quot; as a big gamble for Euston, out of step with the company&#x27;s usual fare. Childs later remarked that Verity Lambert &quot;didn&#x27;t want to come in and just do the same old routine – the kick bollock and scramble action adventure stuff that made the early name of the company&quot;. He continues to be one of British television&#x27;s top producers, responsible for such shows as &quot;Chancer&quot; (1991), &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; (1987–2000), &quot;Sharpe&quot; (1993–2006), &quot;Kavanagh QC&quot; (1995–2001) and &quot;Lewis&quot; (2006–2015).

Script editor Linda Agran has since acted as producer of such series as &quot;Widows&quot;, &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; (1989–2013) and &quot;The Vanishing Man&quot; (1996).

The production took place between 26 August and 23 December 1978 at locations around Middlesex and Hertfordshire as well as London, including Wembley Stadium. The budget was £1.25 million (£ in 2025), making it one of the most expensive undertakings Euston had attempted at that time. Production designer Arnold Chapkis constructed several large and elaborate sets, including those for the megalithic standing stones at Ringstone Round, the Kapps&#x27; radio telescope and observatory, and the decaying urban landscape of London; Kneale quipped about the radio telescope set that &quot;it probably would have worked if they&#x27;d just aimed it properly!&quot; Associate producer Norton Knatchbull noted that the serial &quot;was the first &#x27;art department&#x27; picture Euston has ever been involved in, in the sense that major sets had to be built on location&quot;. This led Euston executive Johnny Goodman to joke: &quot;Our biggest problem was finding someone who wanted the two giant telescope dishes after we finished filming. There&#x27;s not much demand for such things&quot;. One aspect where the budget was less than generous was with the model sequences made by Clearwater Films; Johnny Goodman remarked that the cost was less than James Bond producer Cubby Broccoli &quot;would spend on cigars in a week&quot;. Post-production was completed in mid-February 1979. Unlike the original BBC &quot;Quatermass&quot; serials, which had used stock music tracks, the new serial had a specially composed soundtrack by Marc Wilkinson and Nic Rowley which made particular use of the nursery rhyme &quot;Huffity, Puffity, Ringstone Round&quot; devised by Kneale in his scripts.

==Broadcast ==
ITV intended &quot;Quatermass&quot; to air in September 1979 as the flagship of its autumn season; advertising posters announced, &quot;Earth&#x27;s dark ancestral forces awaken to a summons from beyond the stars. The legend returns on ITV – Wednesdays at 9 pm throughout September&quot;. However, industrial action began at ITV on 3 August and escalated into a full-scale blackout from 10 August, leaving the channel—and &quot;Quatermass&quot;—off the air for 75 days. Transmissions were finally restored on Wednesday, 24 October, and the first episode of &quot;Quatermass&quot; was duly broadcast that night at 9 pm. Episode two was promoted in the &quot;TV Times&quot; with a full-page article by Kneale introducing the new series and looking back on the original 1950s serials, as well as a lifestyle piece with Barbara Kellerman moving house, while episode four was promoted with a full-page profile of John Mills. Ratings, averaging 11 million viewers over the four-week run, were below expectations; the serial failed to crack the top 20 programmes in the weeks it was broadcast.

==Reception==
&quot;Quatermass&quot; met with a generally unenthusiastic critical response. Sean Day-Lewis wrote: &quot;Although Piers Haggard&#x27;s direction achieves much verisimilitude and the story is certainly enough to command some addiction; I did not feel exactly grabbed; the genre has moved some way since the 1950s and the Professor moves a little slowly for the 1970s&quot;. The reviewer in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; found Professor Quatermass &quot;far too unheroic and unresourceful to carry much interest&quot; while &quot;The Times&quot; found the serial to be &quot;a so-so affair&quot;. John Brosnan, writing in &quot;Starburst&quot; magazine, found the serial to be &quot;a bitter reaction by a member of an older generation to the younger generation whose apparently irrational behaviour makes them appear to belong to a totally different species. Naturally in the traditions of sf, these failings are exaggerated to the nth degree. Thus muggers and juvenile delinquents become armed gangs and the hippy movement with its emphasis on mysticism, becomes the Planet Church. It&#x27;s very much a story of Age versus Youth and significantly it&#x27;s the older people who are impervious to the malign alien influence&quot;. This view is echoed by filmmaker John Carpenter who said that &quot;Nigel was very embittered about the way of the world, as was shown, I think, in &quot;The Quatermass Conclusion&quot;&quot;.

Reflecting on the serial, Nigel Kneale said that he was not satisfied with that project. Although Kneale was pleased with the high production values, he was dissatisfied with the casting, believing that John Mills &quot;didn&#x27;t have the authority for Quatermass&quot;. He was similarly unimpressed with Simon MacCorkindale, noting that &quot;we had him in &quot;Beasts&quot; playing an idiot and he was very good at that&quot;. Kneale disliked the depiction of the Planet People, as his inspiration had been angry punks rather than hippies (as evidenced by his portrayal of Kickalong as a gun-toting lunatic who commits multiple motiveless murders). Producer Ted Childs thinks that &quot;the primary problems with it were (a) it was perhaps too depressing a story for a popular television audience and (b) the punters were used to a fairly high standard of technical presentation from American television... And we just couldn&#x27;t afford that&quot;. Executive producer Verity Lambert&#x27;s opinion is that it &quot;didn&#x27;t have the staying power of the originals, but then that&#x27;s almost inevitable when you try to bring something back in a slightly different form&quot;.

==Other media==
From the outset, Euston intended to create two versions of the story; a four-part serial for broadcast on UK television and a 100-minute film, &quot;The Quatermass Conclusion&quot;, for distribution abroad. While writing the scripts, Kneale was &quot;careful not to pad, because I knew that was the obvious thing, but to write in material which can be removed&quot;. There is one major plot deviation between the two versions; in the TV serial, Quatermass is separated from Annie Morgan as they transport Isabel to a London hospital, after Quatermass is dragged from the passenger seat of the moving vehicle by a member of the Blue Brigade. This scene is slightly changed in the film version so that Quatermass manages to stay on board the vehicle with Annie and Isabel, despite the Blue Brigade attack, enabling Quatermass to stay with Annie and Isabel as they go into the hospital. This meant that two versions of the hospital scene where Isabel dies were shot, one with Quatermass present (the film version) and one without (the television version), as well as an earlier scene at the hospital unique to the film version where Quatermass talks on the telephone. As Quatermass is present at the hospital in the film version, it enabled all the footage from the TV serial featuring Quatermass with people at the junkyard, following his separation from Annie and Isabel, to be cut out of the film and thus greatly help in getting &quot;The Quatermass Conclusion&quot; down to around 100 minutes. There was little interest among film distributors in &quot;The Quatermass Conclusion&quot;, and it received only a limited theatrical release.

The story was novelised by Nigel Kneale, his first book since his Somerset Maugham Award-winning short story collection &quot;Tomato Cain&quot; was published in 1949. The novelisation expanded on the backgrounds of many of the characters seen in the story, and added a deeper, more physical, relationship between Quatermass and Annie Morgan. It was this version of the story with which Kneale was most pleased.

&quot;The Quatermass Conclusion&quot; was released on VHS videotape in 1985 while the complete four-part &quot;Quatermass&quot; serial was released in 1994. &quot;Quatermass&quot;, along with &quot;The Quatermass Conclusion&quot; was released on region 2 DVD in 2003 by Clearvision in a three disc boxset; extras included a Sci-Fi Channel interview with Nigel Kneale and extensive production notes. A two disc region 1 DVD of &quot;Quatermass&quot; was released by A&amp;E Home Entertainment in 2005, and contained both the television and film versions as well as a History Channel documentary about Stonehenge. In July 2015, Network Distributing released the series on Blu-ray disc for the first time, remastered from the original 35mm film negatives. Network simultaneously released the series as a remastered DVD set. Both sets (Region B/Region 2 respectively) also contain &quot;The Quatermass Conclusion&quot; film, also remastered and presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio.

<doc id="871280" wikidata="Q1369844" url="?curid=871280" title="Observability">
<text>Observability is a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs.
In control theory, the observability and controllability of a linear system are mathematical duals.

The concept of observability was introduced by the Hungarian-American engineer Rudolf E. Kálmán for linear dynamic systems. A dynamical system designed to estimate the state of a system from measurements of the outputs is called a &quot;state observer&quot; for that system, such as Kalman filters.

==Definition==
Consider a physical system modeled in state-space representation. A system is said to be observable if, for every possible evolution of state and control vectors, the current state can be estimated using only the information from outputs (physically, this generally corresponds to information obtained by sensors). In other words, one can determine the behavior of the entire system from the system&#x27;s outputs. On the other hand, if the system is not observable, there are state trajectories that are not distinguishable by only measuring the outputs.

== Linear time-invariant systems ==
For time-invariant linear systems in the state space representation, there are convenient tests to check whether a system is observable. Consider a SISO system with formula_1 state variables (see state space for details about MIMO systems) given by

: formula_2
: formula_3

=== Observability matrix ===
If and only if the column rank of the &quot;observability matrix&quot;, defined as

:formula_4

is equal to formula_1, then the system is observable. The rationale for this test is that if formula_1 columns are linearly independent, then each of the formula_1 state variables is viewable through linear combinations of the output variables formula_8.

=== Related concepts ===

==== Observability index ====
The &quot;observability index&quot; formula_9 of a linear time-invariant discrete system is the smallest natural number for which the following is satisfied: formula_10, where

:formula_11

==== Unobservable subspace ====
The &quot;unobservable subspace&quot; formula_12 of the linear system is the kernel of the linear map formula_13 given byformula_14where formula_15 is the set of continuous functions from formula_16 to formula_17. formula_12 can also be written as 

:formula_19

Since the system is observable if and only if formula_20, the system is observable if and only if formula_12 is the zero subspace.

The following properties for the unobservable subspace are valid:
*formula_22
*formula_23
*formula_24

==== Detectability ====
A slightly weaker notion than observability is &quot;detectability&quot;. A system is detectable if all the unobservable states are stable.

Detectability conditions are important in the context of sensor networks.

== Linear time-varying systems ==

Consider the continuous linear time-variant system

: formula_25
: formula_26

Suppose that the matrices formula_27, formula_28 and formula_29 are given as well as inputs and outputs formula_30 and formula_8 for all formula_32 then it is possible to determine formula_33 to within an additive constant vector which lies in the null space of formula_34 defined by
: formula_35
where formula_36 is the state-transition matrix.

It is possible to determine a unique formula_33 if formula_34 is nonsingular. In fact, it is not possible to distinguish the initial state for formula_39 from that of formula_40 if formula_41 is in the null space of formula_34.

Note that the matrix formula_43 defined as above has the following properties:
* formula_34 is symmetric
* formula_34 is positive semidefinite for formula_46
* formula_34 satisfies the linear matrix differential equation
:: formula_48
* formula_34 satisfies the equation
:: formula_50

=== Observability matrix generalization ===
The system is observable in formula_51 if and only if there exists an interval formula_51 in formula_16 such that the matrix formula_34 is nonsingular.

If formula_55 are analytic, then the system is observable in the interval [formula_56,formula_57] if there exists formula_58 and a positive integer &quot;k&quot; such that

: formula_59

where formula_60 and formula_61 is defined recursively as

: formula_62

==== Example ====

Consider a system varying analytically in formula_63 and matricesformula_64 Then formula_65 , and since this matrix has rank = 3, the system is observable on every nontrivial interval of formula_16.

== Nonlinear systems ==
Given the system formula_67, formula_68. Where formula_69 the state vector, formula_70 the input vector and formula_71 the output vector. formula_72 are to be smooth vector fields.

Define the observation space formula_73 to be the space containing all repeated Lie derivatives, then the system is observable in formula_74 if and only if formula_75, where

:formula_76

Early criteria for observability in nonlinear dynamic systems were discovered by Griffith and Kumar, Kou, Elliot and Tarn, and Singh.

There also exist an observability criteria for nonlinear time-varying systems.

== Static systems and general topological spaces ==

Observability may also be characterized for steady state systems (systems typically defined in terms of algebraic equations and inequalities), or more generally, for sets in formula_77. Just as observability criteria are used to predict the behavior of Kalman filters or other observers in the dynamic system case, observability criteria for sets in formula_77 are used to predict the behavior of data reconciliation and other static estimators. In the nonlinear case, observability can be characterized for individual variables, and also for local estimator behavior rather than just global behavior.

<doc id="871281" wikidata="Q229775" url="?curid=871281" title="Bryce Dallas Howard">
<text>Bryce Dallas Howard (born March 2, 1981) is an American actress and director. The eldest child of filmmaker Ron Howard, she studied acting at the New York University Tisch School of the Arts. While portraying Rosalind in a 2003 production of &quot;As You Like It&quot;, Howard caught the attention of director M. Night Shyamalan, who cast her as a blind girl in the thriller film &quot;The Village&quot; (2004) and a naiad in the fantasy film &quot;Lady in the Water&quot; (2006).

Howard&#x27;s performance in Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s romance film &quot;As You Like It&quot; (2006) earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination and she subsequently appeared as Gwen Stacy in Sam Raimi&#x27;s superhero film &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; (2007). She went on to appear as Kate Connor in the action film &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot; (2009) and as Victoria in the fantasy film &quot;The Twilight Saga: Eclipse&quot; (2010). She also appeared in the drama film &quot;The Help&quot; (2011), the comedy-drama film &quot;50/50&quot; (2011), the fantasy film &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot; (2016), and the musical film &quot;Rocketman&quot; (2019). Howard gained further recognition with her role as Claire Dearing in the top-grossing &quot;Jurassic World&quot; trilogy (2015–2022).

Additionally, Howard directed the documentary film &quot;Dads&quot; (2019), and episodes of the Disney+ space western series &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; (2019–present) and &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot; (2022).

==Early life and education==
Bryce Dallas Howard was born March 2, 1981, in Los Angeles, to writer Cheryl Howard (née Alley) and actor-director Ron Howard. She has two younger sisters, including Paige, and a younger brother. Through her father, Bryce is a granddaughter of actors Rance Howard and Jean Speegle Howard, as well as a niece of actor Clint Howard. Her godfather is actor Henry Winkler, who co-starred with her father in the 1970s–1980s American comedy television series &quot;Happy Days&quot;.

Howard was raised in Armonk, New York, and on a farm in Greenwich, Connecticut. Howard and her siblings were raised away from the world of show business; their parents did not allow them access to television, and instead encouraged outdoor activities and hobbies. At the age of seven, she was permitted to be an extra in her father&#x27;s films. In a 2017 appearance on &quot;Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen&quot;, she said she and her siblings were babysat by family friend Tom Cruise on several occasions.

Howard began training as an actor at Stagedoor Manor, a performing arts camp in upstate New York, alongside Natalie Portman. She attended Greenwich Country Day School until 1996, and graduated from Byram Hills High School in 1999, after which she studied for three years at New York University&#x27;s (NYU) Tisch School of the Arts, taking classes at the Stella Adler Studio of Acting, the Experimental Theatre Wing, and the International Theatre Workshop in Amsterdam. During her schooling, Howard took part in the concept recording of the Broadway-bound musical &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;. She took a leave of absence from NYU to pursue roles without completing her degree. Almost 20 years later, she returned to NYU and completed her degree in 2020.

Howard is also an alumna of the Steppenwolf Theatre Company&#x27;s School in Chicago, and of The Actors Center in New York City. During her time in New York, Howard was also a member of Theater Mitu, a company that was in residence at New York Theatre Workshop, which is known for its exploration of theatrical forms.

==Career==
===2002–2006: Early roles and film success===

For several years, Howard appeared in New York City theatrical productions; her repertoire included &quot;House &amp; Garden&quot;–a 2002 Alan Ayckbourn production held at the Manhattan Theatre Club– and &quot;Tartuffe&quot;, a theatrical comedy staged at the American Airlines Theatre. In 2003, Howard performed as Rosalind in the William Shakespeare comedy &quot;As You Like It&quot; at The Public Theater, where she caught the attention of film director M. Night Shyamalan, who two weeks later and without an audition, cast her in his fantasy thriller &quot;The Village&quot; (2004). Howard portrayed the female lead Ivy, the chief&#x27;s blind daughter, opposite Ivy&#x27;s love interest Joaquin Phoenix. The film was a commercial success but met mixed reviews. Her performance was lauded by critics and Howard was nominated for several awards. Lars von Trier then cast Howard to replace Nicole Kidman in &quot;Manderlay&quot; (2005), the sequel to &quot;Dogville&quot; (2003); she reprised Kidman&#x27;s role as Grace Mulligan, an idealistic woman who stays at a plantation in rural Alabama and later attempts to assist a revolt against slave owners. The film garnered mixed reviews.

Howard reunited with Shyamalan for &quot;Lady in the Water&quot; (2006), a fantasy drama in which she plays Story, a naiad-like being from a bedtime story, opposite Paul Giamatti, a Philadelphia building superintendent who discovers Story in a pool. The film under-performed at the box office, failed to recoup its budget, and was largely panned by critics. Howard again portrayed Rosalind in Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s 2006 film adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;As You Like It&quot;, which was released theatrically in Europe before premiering on HBO in the United States. The film was negatively received by British media but American press coverage was positive. Howard was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film at the 65th Golden Globe Awards for her role. That year, she wrote and directed a short film called &quot;Orchids&quot; as part of &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Reel Moments&quot; series, which was funded by Cartier and FilmAid International.

=== 2007–2014: Rise to prominence and critical acclaim ===
In 2007, Howard starred in her first blockbuster film, portraying Gwen Stacy in the superhero film &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;. Howard described herself as a &quot;huge fan&quot; of the franchise and did extensive research to prepare for the role, including reading comic books and dyeing her hair blonde for the part. Howard performed many of her own stunts while filming, unaware she was a few months into a pregnancy. The film was the highest-grossing installment of the trilogy and received a mixed reception. Howard then starred in the science fiction film &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot; (2009); she replaced Claire Danes in the role of Kate Connor. Howard described her role as &quot;an emotional sounding board&quot; for other characters. The film was a financial success but was not critically well received. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described Howard&#x27;s role as &quot;winsomely&quot; while &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote she &quot;upholds the maternal side of the original Sarah Connor legacy&quot;.

Howard starred as a reluctant debutante opposite Chris Evans in &quot;The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond&quot; (2009), an independent film that is based on a 1957 screenplay by Tennessee Williams and premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. Kirk Honeycutt of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised Howard&#x27;s &quot;eye-catching performance&quot;, describing her as a &quot;must-see&quot;, while Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; called her performance &quot;affecting&quot; but not &quot;electrifying, because the material doesn&#x27;t have it&quot;. She joined the &quot;Twilight&quot; series&#x27; third installment &quot;The Twilight Saga: Eclipse&quot;, replacing Rachelle Lefevre as Victoria Sutherland, a revenge-seeking vampire. Howard was a fan of the book series and expressed admiration for her character. The film was a box office hit and drew mixed reviews, though Howard&#x27;s performance received critical acclaim; Honeycutt lauded her as &quot;the epitome of sensual, feline cunning&quot;.

Howard appeared in Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;Hereafter&quot; (2010) as a love interest of Matt Damon&#x27;s character. &quot;Empire&quot; referred to her character as &quot;twinkly&quot;, and stated Howard&#x27;s and Damon&#x27;s &quot;fine work&quot; uplift the film. &quot;Hereafter&quot; was a commercial hit but critics gave it a mixed reception. In January 2011, Howard became the first celebrity ambassador for designer Kate Spade. She appeared in Tate Taylor&#x27;s 2011 film adaptation of Kathryn Stockett&#x27;s novel &quot;The Help&quot;, in which she played Hilly Holbrook, a racist socialite who leads a Junior League chapter in 1963 Jackson, Mississippi. The film was a critical and commercial success. The &quot;Miami Herald&quot; described her role as a &quot;broadly comic villain&quot; while &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Howard for being &quot;energetic in a thankless role&quot;. Howard was nominated for numerous accolades, including an MTV Movie Award and an NAACP Image Award, winning a Critics&#x27; Choice Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award alongside the rest of the cast.

Howard, alongside her father, produced Gus Van Sant&#x27;s &quot;Restless&quot; (2011), a dark coming-of-age film about a teenage boy and girl who are engrossed with death. Howard offered considerable input on the film&#x27;s screenwriting and directorial choices. It premiered at the Cannes Film Festival to mixed reviews. She portrayed Joseph Gordon-Levitt&#x27;s on-and-off girlfriend in the cancer dramedy &quot;50/50&quot; (2011). The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival to critical acclaim and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated Howard &quot;makes a real character&quot; out of the &quot;shrewish&quot; role while &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote she was &quot;rapidly becoming today&#x27;s preeminent Queen of Mean&quot;. Howard directed the short film &quot;When You Find Me&quot;, a social film that was developed in collaboration with Canon under the premise of gathering inspiration through images selected from a photography contest. 96,362 entries were accepted while only eight were selected for use in the film.

=== 2015–present: Mainstream recognition and professional expansion ===
In 2015, Howard starred opposite Chris Pratt, in the science fiction action film &quot;Jurassic World&quot;, the fourth installment in the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; franchise. She portrayed Claire Dearing, the ambitious, accomplished operations manager at the titular theme park who undergoes development during the film. Howard performed extensive ankle exercises to complete the scenes in which her character runs in high heels through almost of mud, which she described as &quot;one of the hardest things [she&#x27;s] ever had to do&quot;. &quot;Jurassic World&quot; was a commercial and critical success, with Howard&#x27;s performance and on-screen chemistry with Pratt receiving praise. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described her portrayal as &quot;dynamo&quot; and &quot;nobody&#x27;s patsy&quot; while the Associated Press wrote; &quot;it is Howard who makes the biggest impact ... her transformation is the most convincing one in a film full of dubious evolutions&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;The Atlantic&quot; considered Dearing and her use of heels &quot;sexist&quot;, while &quot;Bustle&quot; and &quot;Inquisitr&quot; labeled Howard&#x27;s character as a &quot;feminist hero&quot;. Howard disagreed with the former view, citing the character&#x27;s detachment from reality and extensive familiarity with heels in everyday life.
In 2016, Howard starred in the fantasy adventure film &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot;, a remake of the 1977 film of the same name. &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot; was released to critical and commercial success. The same year, Howard appeared in the crime drama &quot;Gold&quot; (2016) as Kay, the protagonist&#x27;s girlfriend. &quot;Gold&quot; opened to a limited release with mixed reviews. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; dubbed her portrayal a &quot;sturdy, salt-of-the-earth&quot; type who &quot;makes [a substantial] impression&quot;. That same year, she also appeared in &quot;Nosedive&quot;, an episode of the Netflix science fiction anthology series &quot;Black Mirror&quot;. Howard gained 30 pounds for the role because body shaming is a &quot;huge part of the subtext of the story&quot;. She chose a laugh for Lacie, her character, that she meant to connote artificiality, anxiety, and dejection. Both Howard and the episode received critical praise; &quot;The Guardian&quot; lauded her portrayal as &quot;brilliantly played&quot; and &quot;The Atlantic&quot; wrote &quot;Howard&#x27;s performance is terrific–she conveys Lacie&#x27;s inner frustration while grinning cheerfully through it&quot;. Howard received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for her performance.

Howard reprised her role as Claire Dearing in the second film of the &quot;Jurassic World&quot; trilogy, &quot;Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom&quot; (2018), in which her character appears as a dinosaur-rights activist. The film was a commercial hit, although it received mixed critical reception. For accuracy, Howard trained with a veterinary surgeon who had experience with African wildlife. &quot;Variety&quot; stated Howard &quot;projects a luminous concern for God&#x27;s ancient revived creatures&quot; while &quot;Empire&quot; praised both Pratt and Howard for &quot;develop[ing] their characters beyond the archetypes they inhabited&quot;.

In 2019, Howard voiced the character Bella in the family drama film &quot;A Dog&#x27;s Way Home&quot;, which opened to critical and commercial success. Howard appeared as Elton John&#x27;s mother Sheila Dwight in the musical biopic &quot;Rocketman&quot; (2019), which was directed by Dexter Fletcher. Howard described her character as humorous and sharp-witted, and as someone who struggled with her mental health. Howard worked extensively with make-up artists to design the character&#x27;s look as she aged, and used Elizabeth Taylor as inspiration for her portrayal. &quot;Rocketman&quot; was a box-office hit and garnered critical acclaim, receiving a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. The &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praised Howard for her &quot;finely nuanced work&quot; and &quot;CinemaBlend&quot; called her performance a &quot;wicked portrayal ... that really ties a film together&quot;.

Howard made her feature film directorial debut with the documentary &quot;Dads&quot;, which premiered at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, where it was named second runner-up for the People&#x27;s Choice Award for Documentaries. &quot;Dads&quot; received critical acclaim; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote; &quot;Howard favors observation over lecture, anecdotes over numbers, showing instead of telling what equally split primary-caregiving looks like in contemporary households&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; said the film &quot;mixes the platitudinous with the genuinely moving&quot;.

She directed three episodes of the Disney+ space Western series &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; (2019–2023). Howard referred to the larger &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe as an asset to storytelling, and sought to maintain character depth and appeal to viewers. Howard&#x27;s direction received positive responses; &quot;Den of Geek&quot; said she &quot;[made] the episode pop&quot; and &quot;knows what makes &quot;Star Wars&quot; tick&quot;. Howard also directed an episode of the miniseries &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot;, which premiered on Disney+ in January 2022.

Howard reprised her role as Claire Dearing once more in &quot;Jurassic World Dominion&quot; (2022), the concluding instalment in the &quot;Jurassic World&quot; trilogy. In 2024, she starred in the lead role of the action comedy film &quot;Argylle&quot;, directed by Matthew Vaughn. She also directed episode 6 of the Disney+ science fiction series &quot;Star Wars: Skeleton Crew&quot;.

Howard is set to star in the Amazon Prime Video comedy film &quot;Deep Cover&quot;.

==Personal life==
During her senior year of high school, Howard learned of existentialism. She said: &quot;I was like, &#x27;This is it! This is my religion.&#x27; I had never felt a connection to any sort of spirituality before that. It was very basic–you&#x27;re responsible for the choices that you make–but it was mind-blowing at the time.&quot;

Howard met actor Seth Gabel at New York University; they dated for five years before marrying on June 17, 2006. Howard and Gabel had planned to start a family together in their thirties but a week after their wedding, when they were both around 25 years old, Howard learned she was pregnant with their first child. Howard gave birth to their son in 2007. Howard has talked about experiencing postpartum depression 18 months after her son&#x27;s birth, and credited her recovery to the help of a physician and a therapist. The couple had a second child, a daughter, in 2012. The family lives in upstate New York.

Howard does not drink alcohol.

<text>Edward Macnaghten, Baron Macnaghten, (3 February 1830 – 17 February 1913) was an Anglo-Irish law lord, barrister, rower, and Conservative-Unionist politician.

==Early life and rowing==
Macnaghten was born in Bloomsbury, London, the second son of Sir Edmund Workman-Macnaghten, Bt., but grew up mainly at Roe Park, Limavady. He attended school in Sunderland and university at Trinity College Dublin and Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating Bachelor of Arts in 1852. At Cambridge, he was secretary of the Pitt Club.

Macnaghten was a rower at Cambridge. In 1851, he was runner up to E. G. Peacock in the Diamond Challenge Sculls at Henley Royal Regatta, but avenged this the following year with a win. Macnaghten rowed bow for Cambridge in the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race in 1852 which was won by Oxford. Also in 1852, he turned the tables on Peacock to win the Diamond Challenge Sculls from him at Henley.

==Legal and political career==
After being called to the Bar by Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1857, Macnaghten built up a successful practice and became Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1880. That same year he was elected to the House of Commons as Conservative Member of Parliament for County Antrim, and then for North Antrim when the county was divided in 1885. In 1912 he signed the Ulster Covenant.

Having declined the offers of a judgeship from Gladstone in 1883 and the Home Secretaryship from the Conservatives in 1886, he was on 25 January 1887 appointed a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary with a life peerage as Baron Macnaghten, &quot;of Runkerry in the County of Antrim&quot;. No practising barrister who had been Queen&#x27;s Counsel for less than seven years had ever before been promoted to the House of Lords.

He was a member of the British tribunal to arbitrate the Chile-Argentina boundary dispute and helped to draft the final settlement in 1902. For his service to this project he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) by King Edward VII on 18 December 1902.

===Judgments===
*&quot;British South Africa Co v Companhia de Moçambique&quot; [1893] AC 602 – the House of Lords overturned a Court of Appeal decision and by so doing established the &quot;Mozambique rule&quot;, a common law rule in private international law that renders actions relating to title in foreign land, the right to possession of foreign land, and trespass to foreign land non-justiciable in common law jurisdictions.

==Decorations==
Lord Macnaghten was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1902 and a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the 1911 coronation honours of George V. He also succeeded his elder brother, Francis, as fourth Baronet in the latter year.

==Legacy==
Lord Macnaghten&#x27;s most famous contribution to English law was the determination of categories of charitable trusts (in the case of &quot;Commissioners for Special Purposes of Income Tax v Pemsel&quot;). He also sat in the landmark decision of &quot;Salomon v A Salomon &amp; Co Ltd&quot;. In the case of &quot;Montgomery v Thompson&quot; (Eng.), AC 225 (1891), he held that a brewery opened in the town of Stone in Staffordshire could not use the name &quot;Stone Ale&quot;, as this would infringe the rights of an existing seller of a product named &quot;Stone Ale&quot;. He famously remarked, &quot;Thirsty folk want beer, not explanations.&quot;

He is famous for the elegance of his prose. An example is given in the case of &quot;Gluckstein v Barnes&quot; [1900] AC 240, where he refused to order that fraudulent company promoters should be entitled to contribution from other participants of the fraud. He said, &quot;In these two matters Mr. Gluckstein has been in my opinion extremely fortunate. But he complains that he may have a difficulty in recovering from his co-directors their share of the spoil, and he asks that the official liquidator may proceed against his associates before calling upon him to make good the whole amount with which he has been charged. My Lords, there may be occasions in which that would be a proper course to take. But I cannot think that this is a case in which any indulgence ought to be shewn to Mr. Gluckstein. He may or may not be able to recover a contribution from those who joined with him in defrauding the company. He can bring an action at law if he likes. If he hesitates to take that course or takes it and fails, then his only remedy lies in an appeal to that sense of honour which is popularly supposed to exist among robbers of a humbler type.&quot;

He also gave an eloquent description of a floating charge in &quot;Illingworth v Houldsworth&quot; [1904] AC 335, where he said, &quot;A specific charge, I think, is one that without more fastens on ascertained and definite property or property capable of being ascertained and defined; a floating charge, on the other hand, is ambulatory and shifting in its nature, hovering over and so to speak floating with the property which it is intended to affect until some event occurs or some act is done which causes it to settle and fasten on the subject of the charge within its reach and grasp.&quot;

==Personal life==

He married, in 1858, Frances Arabella (d. 1903), the only child of Sir Samuel Martin, a baron of the exchequer; they had five sons and six daughters. His daughters remained living at Runkerry until c. 1950.

<text>The , officially nicknamed the , is a commuter rail line and service in the Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto Metropolitan Area of Japan, owned and operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West). The line connects Kizu Station in Kyoto Prefecture and Kyōbashi Station in Osaka.

The common name &quot;Gakkentoshi Line&quot;, literally &quot;Research City Line&quot;, comes from the Kansai Science City, which is located along the line around the border of Osaka and Nara prefectures.

==History==
The line was originally built and operated by the between Katamachi and Shijōnawate in 1895. Two years later, the Kansai Railway bought the line in order to have its own trunk line to Osaka from Nagoya, combined with constructing the section between Shijōnawate and Kizu. Katamachi Station was unable to be expanded, thus Amijima terminus was constructed. However Kansai Railway bought the line from Nara via Ōji to Minatomachi (present ) in downtown Osaka, and shifted its main line to the ex-Naniwa Railway line. Thereafter, the Katamachi Line became a branch of the railway network of Osaka.

The Shigino to Hanaten section was duplicated in 1927, with the Katamachi to Shigino section double-tracked in 1955, the Hanaten to Shijonawate section in 1969, extended to Nagao in 1979, to Matsuiyamate in 1989, and the balance of the section to Kyobashi double-tracked between 2007 and 2009.

The section between Katamachi and Shijōnawate became the first Japan Governmental Railways electrified line in Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto area in 1932, with electrification extended to Nagao in 1950. After privatization of the then Japanese National Railways (JNR), the line became part of the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) system, and the Kizu to Nagao section was electrified in 1989.

In 1997, the JR Tōzai Line was opened and connected to Katamachi Line at Kyōbashi, and Katamachi Station was closed (with Ōsakajō-kitazume Station becoming the replacement station). Most trains began operating through to the Fukuchiyama Line (JR Takarazuka Line).

Converted from a freight branch to a passenger route, the Osaka Higashi Line began service in 2008. Trains from Nara via Kansai Main (Yamatoji) Line began operation to Amagasaki Station. However, these through trains to Amagasaki have now ceased operation since March 2019, with the Osaka Higashi Line extension.

Station numbering was introduced to the line in March 2018 with stops being assigned station numbers between JR-H18 and JR-H41.

===Military use===
Three military/weapons-related facilities used during the early 20th century were serviced by spurs located between and Tsuda Stations (Kin-ya Ammunition Dump, where two explosions occurred in 1909 and 1939), between and Hoshida Stations (Uji Weapon Kori Factory), and the Osaka Army Arsenal warehouse between and Shigino Stations.

==Route and operation==
The line is connected via the JR Tōzai Line in downtown Osaka, at , to the Tōkaidō Main Line (JR Kobe Line) and Fukuchiyama Line (JR Takarazuka Line). This link enables trains operated from Nara to the west, as Kobe, Himeji, and Sanda.

Rapid services of several types of stops, with no surcharge, are also provided. Abbreviations are tentative for this article.
Some trains terminate at Matsuiyamate due to the single track to Kizu.
:Operated all day, most trains between Matsuiyamate and Nishi-Akashi on Sanyō Main (JR Kobe) Line. Some in busy hours to Fukuchiyama Line (JR Takarazuka Line), some terminate at Kyōbashi.
:Operated in early morning, late night, and busy hours only. Some from/to Nara, most from/to Dōshishamae or Kyōtanabe. Through to Nishiakashi or Shin-Sanda.
:Mostly through to Shin-Sanda or Sasayamaguchi on Fukuchiyama (JR Takarazuka) Line. One per 15 minutes per direction.

===Past services===
:Through trains from Osaka Higashi Line, operated only between Hanaten and Kyōbashi in this line. Four trains to Amagasaki from Nara in the morning, 4 vice versa in the evening. This service has ceased operation on the Katamachi Line starting from 16 March 2019, with the opening of the Shin-Osaka Extension of the Osaka Higashi Line.

<text>Fra Diamante (c. 1430 – c. 1498) was an Italian Renaissance painter.

==Biography==
Born at Prato, he was a Carmelite friar, a member of the Florentine community of that order, and was the friend and assistant of Filippo Lippi. The Carmelite convent of Prato which he adorned with many works in fresco has been suppressed, and the buildings have been altered to a degree involving the destruction of the paintings. He was the principal assistant of Lippi in the large frescoes at the east end of the cathedral of Prato. He also collaborated in the &quot;Funeral of St. Jerome&quot; panel in the same church.

Amid the work he was recalled to Florence by his conventual superior, and a minute of proceedings of the commune of Prato is still extant, in which it is determined to petition the metropolitan of Florence to obtain his return to Prato, a proof that his share in the work was so important that his recall involved the suspension of it. Subsequently, he assisted Filippo in the execution of the frescoes in the cathedral of Spoleto, which Fra Diamante completed in 1470 after his master died in 1469.

Lippi left a son ten years old (the future artist Filippino Lippi) to the care of Diamante, who, having received 200 ducats from the commune of Spoleto, as the balance due for the work done in the cathedral, returned with the child to Florence, and, as art biographer Giorgio Vasari says, bought land for himself with the money, giving but a small portion to the child. The accusation of wrongdoing, however, would depend upon the share of the work executed by Fra Diamante, and the terms of his agreement with Lippi. Fra Diamante must have been nearly seventy when he completed the frescoes at Spoleto, but the exact year of his death is not known.

<doc id="871297" wikidata="Q1758059" url="?curid=871297" title="Heliamphora">
<text>The genus Heliamphora ( or ; Greek: &quot;helos&quot; &quot;marsh&quot; and &quot;amphoreus&quot; &quot;amphora&quot;) contains 24 species of pitcher plants endemic to South America. The species are collectively known as sun pitchers, based on the mistaken notion that the &quot;heli&quot; of &quot;Heliamphora&quot; is from the Greek &quot;helios&quot;, meaning &quot;sun&quot;. The name instead derives from the Greek &quot;helos&quot;, meaning &quot;marsh&quot;, so a more accurate translation of their scientific name would be marsh pitcher plants. Species in the genus &quot;Heliamphora&quot; are carnivorous plants that consist of a modified leaf form that is fused into a tubular shape. They have evolved mechanisms to attract, trap, and kill insects; and control the amount of water in the pitcher. At least one species (&quot;H. tatei&quot;) produces its own proteolytic enzymes that allows it to digest its prey without the help of symbiotic bacteria.

==Morphology==
All &quot;Heliamphora&quot; species are herbaceous perennial plants that grow from a subterranean rhizome. &quot;Heliamphora&quot; species form stemless rosettes and leaf height ranges from a few centimeters (&quot;H. minor&quot;, &quot;H. pulchella&quot;) up to more than (&quot;H. ionasi&quot;, &quot;H. tatei&quot;). &quot;Heliamphora&quot; possess tubular traps formed by rolled leaves with fused edges. Marsh pitcher plants are unusual among pitcher plants in that they lack lids (opercula), instead having a small &quot;nectar spoon&quot; on the upper posterior portion of the leaf. This spoon-like structure secretes a nectar-like substance, which serves as a lure for insects and small animals. Each pitcher also exhibits a small drainage hole (W, E2a, E2b, and E3 Clades) or slit (E1 Clade) in its side that allows excess rainwater to drain away, similar to the overflow on a sink. It was inferred that the drainage structure first evolved as drainage hole in ancestral &quot;Heliamphora&quot; populations and further modified into drainage slit in the ancestors of E1 clade. This allows the marsh pitcher plants to maintain a constant maximum level of rainwater within the pitcher. The pitchers&#x27; inner surface is covered with downward-pointing hairs to force insects into the pitchers&#x27; lower parts. The morphological diversification of &quot;Heliamphora&quot; pitchers is both convergent and divergent, likely as a result of adaptive radiation in the geographically complex Guiana highland. 


===Carnivory===
Though often counted among the various carnivorous plants, with the exception of &quot;Heliamphora tatei&quot;, the vast majority of plants in the genus &quot;Heliamphora&quot; do not produce their own digestive enzymes (i.e. proteases, ribonucleases, phosphatases, &quot;etc.&quot;), relying instead on the enzymes of symbiotic bacteria to break down their prey. They do, however, attract prey through special visual and chemical signals and trap and kill the prey through a typical pitfall trap. Field studies of &quot;H. nutans&quot;, &quot;H. heterodoxa&quot;, &quot;H. minor&quot;, and &quot;H. ionasi&quot; have determined that none of these species produce their own proteolytic enzymes. &quot;H. tatei&quot; is one of the few species observed to produce both digestive enzymes and wax scales, which also aid in prey capture. The pattern of carnivory among &quot;Heliamphora&quot; species, combined with habitat data, indicates that carnivory in this genus evolved in nutrient-poor locations as a means to improve absorption of available nutrients. Most &quot;Heliamphora&quot; typically capture ants, while &quot;H. tatei&quot; can capture and absorb nutrients from more flying insects. The carnivorous habit among these species is lost in low light conditions, which suggests that certain nutrient concentrations (specifically nitrogen and phosphorus) are only limiting during periods of fast growth under normal light conditions, thus rendering most of the carnivorous adaptations inefficient and not energy cost effective.

==Distribution==

All &quot;Heliamphora&quot; species are endemic to the tepuis of the Guiana Highlands and their surrounding uplands. Most are found in Venezuela, with a few extending into western Guyana and northern Brazil. Many of the tepuis have not yet been explored for &quot;Heliamphora&quot;, and the large number of species described in recent years suggests that many more species may be awaiting discovery.

==Botanical history==

The first species of the genus to be described was &quot;H. nutans&quot;, which George Bentham named in 1840 based on a specimen collected by Robert Hermann Schomburgk. This remained the only known species until Henry Allan Gleason described &quot;H. tatei&quot; and &quot;H. tyleri&quot; in 1931, also adding &quot;H. minor&quot; in 1939. Between 1978 and 1984, Julian Alfred Steyermark and Bassett Maguire revised the genus (to which Steyermark had added &quot;H. heterodoxa&quot; in 1951) and described two more species, &quot;H. ionasi&quot; and &quot;H. neblinae&quot;, as well as many infraspecific taxa. Various exploratory expeditions as well as review of existing herbarium specimens has yielded many new species in recent years, mainly through the work of a group of German horticulturalists and botanists (Thomas Carow, Peter Harbarth, Joachim Nerz and Andreas Wistuba).

==Care in cultivation==
&quot;Heliamphora&quot; are regarded by carnivorous plant enthusiasts and experts as one of the more difficult plants to maintain in cultivation. The genus requires cool (the &quot;highland&quot; species) to warm (the &quot;lowland&quot; species) temperatures with a constant and very high humidity. An amateur botanist in New York City has shown that cultivation of the genus can be achieved with an inexpensive setup consisting of a large plastic crate, a fan, egg cartons, and water bottles filled with ice. The highland species, which originate from high on the humid tepui mountaintops, include &quot;H. nutans&quot;, &quot;H. ionasi&quot;, and &quot;H. tatei&quot;. The lowland &quot;Heliamphora&quot;, such as &quot;H. ciliata&quot; and &quot;H. heterodoxa&quot; have migrated to the warmer grasslands at the foot of the tepuis.

Shredded, long-fibered, or live sphagnum moss is preferred as a soil substrate, often with added horticultural lava rock, perlite, and pumice. The substrate must always be kept moist and extremely well drained. Misting &quot;Heliamphora&quot; with purified water is often beneficial to maintain high humidity levels.

Propagation through division only has a limited rate of success, as many plants that are divided go into shock and eventually die. Germination of &quot;Heliamphora&quot; seed is achieved by scattering it on milled sphagnum moss and keeping in bright light and humid conditions. Seed germination begins after many weeks.

==Classification==
The genus &quot;Heliamphora&quot; contains the most species in the Sarraceniaceae family and is joined by the cobra lily (&quot;Darlingtonia californica&quot;) and the North American pitcher plants (&quot;Sarracenia&quot; spp.) in that taxon.

===Species===
Twenty-four species of &quot;Heliamphora&quot; are currently recognized. Unless otherwise stated, all information and taxonomic determinations in the table below are sourced from the 2011 work &quot;Sarraceniaceae of South America&quot; authored by Stewart McPherson, Andreas Wistuba, Andreas Fleischmann, and Joachim Nerz. Authorities are presented in the form of a standard author citation, using abbreviations specified by the IPNI. Years given denote the year of the species&#x27;s formal publication under the current name, not the earlier basionym date of publication if one exists.

===Incompletely diagnosed taxa===
A further two incompletely diagnosed taxa are known that may represent distinct species in their own right.

===Varieties===
Two varieties are currently recognised in the genus: &quot;H. minor&quot; var. &quot;pilosa&quot; and &quot;H. minor&quot; var. &quot;minor&quot;. Additionally, an undescribed variant of &quot;H. pulchella&quot; , with traps lacking long retentive hairs is known from Amurí Tepui.

===Cultivars===
There are currently four registered Heliamphora cultivars including Heliamphora &#x27;Cyclops&#x27; (A. Smith), Heliamphora &#x27;Patasola&#x27; (B. Tincher &amp; J. Lei), &quot;Heliamphora&quot; &#x27;Red Mambo&#x27; (F. Boulianne), and Heliamphora &#x27;Scylla&#x27; (I. Bogdanow).

==Natural hybrids==
At least eleven natural hybrids have been recorded:

*&quot;H. arenicola&quot; × &quot;H. ionasi&quot;
*&quot;H. ceracea&quot; × &quot;H. hispida&quot;
*&quot;H. chimantensis&quot; × &quot;H. pulchella&quot;
*&quot;H. elongata&quot; × &quot;H. ionasi&quot;
*&quot;H. exappendiculata&quot; × &quot;H. huberi&quot;
*&quot;H. exappendiculata&quot; × &quot;H. pulchella&quot;
*&quot;H. glabra&quot; × &quot;H. nutans&quot;
*&quot;H. huberi&quot; × &quot;H. pulchella&quot;
*&quot;H. neblinae&quot; × &quot;H. parva&quot;
*&quot;H. purpurascens&quot; × &quot;H. sarracenioides&quot;
*&quot;H.&quot; sp. &#x27;Akopán Tepui&#x27; × &quot;H. pulchella&quot;

Additionally, putative complex hybrids occur on the Neblina Massif among populations of &quot;H. ceracea&quot;, &quot;H. hispida&quot;, &quot;H. neblinae&quot;, and &quot;H. parva&quot;. Putative crosses between &quot;H. macdonaldae&quot; and &quot;H. tatei&quot; have also been recorded in the southern part of Cerro Duida.

== Phylogeny and Diversification ==

Closely related species tend to be geographically closely distributed. Major &quot;Heliamphora&quot; clades probably emerged through both geographical separation and dispersal in the Guiana Highlands during Miocene with more recent diversification driven by vertical displacement during the Pleistocene glacial-interglacial thermal oscillations.

<doc id="871302" wikidata="Q348024" url="?curid=871302" title="Carlo Crivelli">
<text>Carlo Crivelli ( – ) was an Italian Renaissance painter of conservative Late Gothic decorative sensibility, who spent his early years in the Veneto, where he absorbed influences from the Vivarini, Squarcione, and Mantegna. He left the Veneto by 1458 and spent most of the remainder of his career in the March of Ancona, where he developed a distinctive personal style that contrasts with that of his Venetian contemporary Giovanni Bellini.

==Early life==
Crivelli was born around 1430–35 in Venice to a family of painters and received his artistic formation there and in Padua. The details of Crivelli&#x27;s career are still sparse: He is said to have studied under Jacobello del Fiore, who was painting as late as 1436; at that time Crivelli was probably only a boy. He also studied at the school of Vivarini in Venice, then left Venice for Padua, where he is believed to have worked in the workshop of Francesco Squarcione and then, after being sentenced in 1457 to a six-month prison term for an affair with a married woman, left in 1459 for Zadar in Dalmatia (now part of Croatia, but then a Venetian territory).

==Career==

He was master of his own shop when sent to prison for adultery in 1457. The dates he signed on the pictures that survive extend from 1468 on an altarpiece in the church of San Silvestro at Massa Fermana near Fermo to 1493 on &quot;The Dead Christ between St John, the Virgin and Mary Magdalene&quot; in Milan&#x27;s Brera Gallery.

Though the artist advertised his Venetian origins with his signature, often some variation on &quot;Carolus Crivellus Venetos&quot; (&#x27;Carlo Crivelli of Venice&#x27;), Crivelli seems to have worked chiefly in the March of Ancona, and especially in and near Ascoli Piceno. Only two pictures can be found today in Venice, both in the church of San Sebastiano.

He painted in tempera only, despite the increasing popularity of oil painting during his lifetime, and on panels, though some of his paintings have been transferred to canvas. His predilection for decoratively punched gilded backgrounds is one of the marks of this conservative taste, in part imposed by his patrons. Of his early polyptychs, only one, the altarpiece from Ascoli Piceno, dated 1473, survives in its entirety in its original frame, and still in its original location (the city&#x27;s Cathedral). All the others have been disassembled and their panels and predella scenes are divided among several museums.

An amorphous band of contemporaries, imitators and followers, termed &quot;Crivelleschi&quot;, reflect to varying degrees aspects of his style.

==Work==

Unlike the naturalistic trends arising in Florence during his lifetime, Crivelli&#x27;s style continues to represent the courtly International Gothic sensibility. His urban settings are jewel-like and full of elaborate allegorical detail. He favored verdant landscape backgrounds, and his works can be identified by his characteristic use of fruits and flowers as decorative motifs, often depicted in pendant festoons, which are also a hallmark of the Paduan studio of Francesco Squarcione, where Crivelli may have worked.

His paintings have a linear quality identified with his Umbrian contemporaries. Crivelli is a painter of marked individuality. Unlike Giovanni Bellini, his contemporary, his works are not &quot;soft&quot;, but clear and definite in contour with marked attention to detail. His use of &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot;, often compared with that found in the works of Northern Renaissance painters like Rogier van der Weyden, includes raised objects, such as jewels and armor modeled in gesso on the panel.

Commissioned by the Franciscans and Dominicans of Ascoli, Crivelli&#x27;s work is exclusively religious in nature. His paintings consist largely of &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; images, &quot;Pietà&quot;, and the altarpieces known as polyptychs that were increasingly unfashionable. Often filled with images of suffering, such as gaping wounds in Christ&#x27;s hands and side and the mouths of mourners twisted in agony, Crivelli&#x27;s work fulfills the spiritual needs of his patrons. These ultra-realistic, sometimes disturbing qualities have often led critics to label Crivelli&#x27;s paintings &quot;grotesque&quot;, much like his fellow Northern Italian painter, Cosimo Tura. His work attracted numerous prestigious commissions and must have appealed to the taste of his patrons.

Carlo Crivelli died in the Marche (probably Ascoli Piceno) around 1495. Vittorio Crivelli, with whom he occasionally collaborated, was his younger brother. Pietro Alemanno, a painter who immigrated to the March of Ancona from Germany/Austria, was his pupil and collaborator. Donato Crivelli, who was also a pupil of Jacobello and was working in 1459, may be of the same family as Carlo.

==Reputation==

His work fell out of favor following his death and Vasari&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&quot;, which is notably Florentine in its outlook, does not mention him. He had something of a revival, especially in the UK, during the time of the pre-Raphaelite painters, several of whom, including Edward Burne-Jones, admired his work. His reputation faded with that movement, but recent writings on his work and a rehanging of his work in the National Gallery, London, have brought him renewed attention.

Susan Sontag in &quot;Notes on &quot;Camp&quot;&quot; (1992) wrote: &quot;Camp is the paintings of Carlo Crivelli, with their real jewels and &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; insects and cracks in the masonry.&quot;

<text>Lo Spagna (died &quot;c.&quot; 1529), &quot;the Spaniard&quot; in Italian, was a painter of the Renaissance, active in central Italy. His name was Giovanni di Pietro, but he was known as &quot;Lo Spagna&quot; because he was of Spanish heritage. He was an important assistant and follower of the Umbrian painter Perugino, whose style his paintings developed. He should not be confused with Pietro di Giovanni D&#x27;Ambrogio of Siena.

Lo Spagna is known for a number of major works completed in the region, including the &quot;Birth of the Virgin&quot; from Spineta in Todi, the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; of Ferentillo and the &quot;Nativity&quot; of St Anthony in Perugia. Lo Spagna married Santina Martorelli from one of Spoleto&#x27;s leading families and here he was nominated &quot;Capitano delle Arti dei Pittori e degli Orefici&quot; in 1517. He died in 1528, possibly of the plague.

Giovanni di Pietro completed the decoration of the apse and two chapels of the church of &quot;San Giacomo&quot; in Spoleto. The records indicate that some thirty inhabitants of the parish contributed payment for the work, which was completed in 1526. The apse vault is frescoed with the &quot;Coronation of the Virgin and St James&quot;, while after Lo Spagna&#x27;s death, the chapel frescoes were completed by pupils, Dono Doni and Cecco di Bernardino of Assisi. The &quot;Madonna and Child in Glory with St Sebastian and St Rocco&quot; on the far wall of the church of Campello sul Clitunno was completed by one of his pupils from a preparatory drawing by &quot;Lo Spagna&quot;. The apse of the church of San Giovanni Battista in the small village of Eggi contains a fresco completed by a hand from &quot;Lo Spagna&quot;’s studio working from a drawing by the artist. For the church of San Martino, &quot;Lo Spagna&quot; completed the large altar-piece of &quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot;, (1522), which today hangs in the Museo Civico of Trevi. The church of &quot;Madonna delle Lacrime&quot; was &quot;Lo Spagna&quot; to complete the fresco decorations in the chapel dedicated to St Francis (1518). Around 1520 &quot;Lo Spagna&quot; decorated the first altar to the right of the church of Sant’Agostino in Visso with frescoes, now found in the &quot;Collegiata di Santa Maria&quot;. &quot;Lo Spagna&quot; painted a fresco cycle for the parish church of &quot;San Michele Arcangelo&quot; in Gavelli, a hamlet in the township of Sant&#x27;Anatolia di Narco near Perugia.

The famous &quot;Sposalizio&quot;, or Marriage of Joseph and Mary, in the museum at Caen, attributed to Perugino, has been credited to Lo Spagna by scholars in the past. The Capitoline Museums in Rome now possess a series of life-sized fresco figures by him, representing &quot;Apollo and the Nine Muses&quot;. The National Gallery, London, has three paintings by Lo Spagna, two small panels depicting &quot;Christ Carrying the Cross&quot; and &quot;Christ at Gethsemane&quot; that were once probably two wings of a portable altarpiece; and a larger panel of &quot;The Agony in the Garden&quot;, all dated to perhaps 1500-05.

Lo Spagna had various pupils and followers, among them Bernardino Campilius.

<text>The (Literally: Osaka East Line) is a railway line in Osaka, Japan, operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR-West). The line connects Ōsaka Station in northern Osaka with Kyūhōji Station in Yao, forming an arc around the northern and eastern suburbs of the city. Before being named on August 23, 2007, the line was constructed with the tentative name &quot;&quot;.

The line is constructed and owned by the as a Category-3 railway business under the Railway Business Act of Japan. JR-West and JR Freight operate trains as Category-2 railway business. The Kita-Umeda extension opened on March 18, 2023, replacing the above-ground Umeda Freight Line.

== History ==
Conceived in the 1950s during Japan&#x27;s explosive postwar economic growth, it was planned as a grand &quot;outer loop&quot; of the city, using existing freight lines to link Amagasaki with Shin-Osaka, Suita, Awaji, Hanaten, Kami, Uriwari and Sugimotochō, with a newly constructed segment into Osaka&#x27;s (then primarily industrial) Nankō Port Town. However, with JNR&#x27;s financial situation deteriorating catastrophically (culminating in its privatization) and continuing issues surrounding land acquisition and squatting by local residents on railway property, the plan was cut back to Shin-Osaka and Kami, terminating at Kyūhōji in the south. (The Hanwa Freight Line, which would have carried the southern segment from Kami to Sugimotochō, was officially abandoned by JR Freight in 2009.) The line connects Shin-Osaka Station in northern Osaka with Kyūhōji Station in Yao, forming an arc around the northern and eastern suburbs of the city.

The southern part opened on March 15, 2008. But because of problems with the illegal occupation of a site, construction of the northern part was delayed. Construction of the northern segment started in 2011 and the section between Shin-Osaka and Hanaten has opened on March 16, 2019.

Incorporated into the second phase of the Osaka Higashi Line project is the construction of underground platforms at Osaka Station (known as Umekita). The project provides the basis for the future Naniwasuji Line while also providing a small shortcut on current services on the Haruka and Kuroshio limited express trains.

In February 2023, track switching work took place between the 11th and 13th of that month. The underground platforms began operation later in the year on March 18.

<text>Fremontodendron, with the common names fremontia and flannelbush or flannel bush, is a genus of three known species of shrubs native to the Southwestern United States and northwest Mexico.

==Taxonomy==
They are within the botanical family Malvaceae. Formerly they were treated within the Sterculiaceae, tribe Fremontodendreae, together with the genus &quot;Chiranthodendron&quot;. The genus &quot;Fremontodendron&quot; was named in dedication to John C. Frémont, who first collected it during an 1846 expedition to Alta California.

==Description==
The leaves have a leathery and fuzzy texture reminiscent of flannel (hence the name), and the yellow to orange flowers are large and showy. The leaves and young shoots can cause skin and eye irritation.


===Species===
There are three species:
* &quot;Fremontodendron californicum&quot; — Californian flannelbush
* &quot;Fremontodendron decumbens&quot; (R. Lloyd) — Pine Hill flannelbush 
:: A decumbent and low spreading form, in height and in width, has yellow-orange flowers, and is endemic to the Sierra Nevada foothills, nearly all of the individuals of this subspecies are found in the Pine Hill Ecological Reserve in El Dorado County. In nature it only grows in metal-rich gabbro soil, a red weathered soil of volcanic origin. It requires fire for seed germination, but with the nature reserve is near human settlements fire ecology is suppressed. It is a federally listed endangered species.
* &quot;Fremontodendron mexicanum&quot; — Mexican flannelbush
::Endemic to the central Peninsular Ranges, known from about ten occurrences in northern Baja California state and adjacent southern San Diego County, California. However, it has most recently been confirmed to exist in only two of those locales currently.

There are a number of populations of uncertain taxonomy status. They include:
*&quot;Fremontodendron californicum&quot; ssp. &quot;napensis&quot; — Napa fremontia
::The current Jepson manual does not recognize this subspecies, using &quot;Fremontodendron californicum&quot;, but the form is different enough that it is horticulturally recognized by this name. It is typically smaller and more open in form than the species, with much smaller leaves and flowers. It grows in height and in width.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Fremontodendrons&quot; are cultivated as ornamental plants. They are valued for their bright yellow flowers, produced over a long period on a rapidly growing shrub or small tree. They are tolerant of pruning for size or shaping. They are adapted to dry, poor soils in a summer-dry, warm, sunny climate. They may succumb to root rot in heavy clay soils and/or summer irrigation.

The three species and varied hybrids/cultivars are used in native plant, water-conserving, and wildlife gardens in California. They are also planted in gardens in England.

===Hybrids===
There are several named hybrids of &quot;Fremontodendron californicum&quot; and &quot;Fremontodendron mexicanum&quot; in the horticultural trade, they include:
*&quot;Fremontodendron&quot; &#x27;California Glory&#x27; — lemon-yellow flowers with a reddish tinge, grows in height by in width. It is the winner of the Award of Garden Merit from the California Horticultural Society in 1965, and received a First Class Certificate from the Royal Horticultural Society in 1967. 
*&quot;Fremontodendron&quot; &#x27;Ken Taylor&#x27; — golden flowers with a darker orange outside petals in the spring and summer, and grows to only in height by in width.
*&quot;Fremontodendron&quot; &#x27;Dara&#x27;s Gold&#x27; — golden flowers over a long period from late winter through early summer, grows in height by in width. A hybrid between &quot;Fremontodendron decumbens&quot; and &quot;Fremontodendron mexicanum&quot;.

<doc id="871316" wikidata="Q1569921" url="?curid=871316" title="Triphyophyllum">
<text>Triphyophyllum is a monotypic plant genus, containing the single species Triphyophyllum peltatum of the family Dioncophyllaceae. It is native to tropical western Africa, in Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone and Liberia, growing in tropical forests.

It is a liana, with a three-stage lifecycle, each with a different shaped leaf, as indicated by its Greek name. In the first stage, &quot;T. peltatum&quot; forms a rosette of simple lanceolate leaves with undulate margins. At times when there is insufficient phosphorus in the soil it develops long, slender, glandular leaves, resembling those of the related &quot;Drosophyllum&quot;, which capture insects; one to three of these leaves in each rosette. In the plant&#x27;s adult liana form it has short non-carnivorous leaves bearing a pair of &quot;grappling hooks&quot; at their tips on a long twining stem which can become in length and thick. &quot;T. peltatum&quot; is the largest of all confirmed carnivorous plants in the world, but its carnivorous nature did not become known until 1979, some 51 years after the plant&#x27;s discovery. Its seeds are about in diameter, bright red in color, disc-shaped, with a peltate stalk emerging from the fruit. Most of the seed&#x27;s development occurs &quot;outside&quot; the fruit. The fruit and seed develop from an orange flower with five incurved petals. As the seed dries out, its wide umbrella shape enables it to be transported on the wind.

&quot;Triphyophylum peltatum&quot; is difficult to cultivate; it is cultivated in four botanical gardens: Abidjan, Bonn, Cambridge University and Würzburg, and is exceedingly rare in private collections.


==Uses==

&quot;Triphyophyllum peltatum&quot; is traditionally used in folk medicine. It produces many pharmaceutically active secondary metabolites, some of which have been found to have strong antiplasmodial activity. Some metabolites were found to have antitumoral and anti-multiple myeloma activity.

<text>The Gambler is a 1974 American crime drama film written by James Toback and directed by Karel Reisz. It stars James Caan, Paul Sorvino, and Lauren Hutton. 
Caan&#x27;s performance was widely lauded and was nominated for a Golden Globe.

==Plot==
Axel Freed is an English professor in New York City with a gambling addiction that begins to spiral out of control. In the classroom, Freed inspires his college students with his interpretations of Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s work. In his personal life, Axel has the affection of his beautiful girlfriend Billie and the admiration of his family, including his mother, Naomi, who is a doctor, and his grandfather, a wealthy businessman.

Axel&#x27;s gambling has left him with a huge debt. His bookie, a mafioso known as Hips, likes the professor personally but threatens grave consequences if he does not pay it soon. When Billie, having been informed by Axel that he owes $44,000, questions the wisdom of her associating with him, Axel confidently tells her she loves his life&#x27;s dangers, including &quot;the possibility of blood&quot;.

After obtaining the $44,000 from his disapproving mother, Axel goes with Billie to Las Vegas and wins a small fortune, only to lose back his last $50,000 on a last-second, incredibly lucky shot in a Lakers game.

After winning $12,000 on a fixed Lakers game—a gift from another gambler—and paying it to the bookmaker, Axel is abducted by associates of the latter. The boss asks Axel if he has family who might help him pay. Axel mentions his grandfather and mother. The boss says he had asked the grandfather, who said no.

Acting on an offer from the mob, Axel lures one of his students, a star on the college&#x27;s basketball team, into shaving points in his next game, so the mob can bet big on the game to cover Axel&#x27;s debt. The student accepts his offer of $5,000. Having set that up, Axel visits his grandfather, who, near the end of their conversation, asks if Axel needs his help. Saying he has taken care of it, Axel leaves.

Watching the game from the stands with three of the mob&#x27;s bookmakers, Axel is saved by the bribed player&#x27;s point shaving in the final minutes, which causes the team to win by only six points and thus not cover an eight-point spread. Nixing a night of post-game celebration with Hips, Axel wanders off into a neighboring black ghetto, as Hips warns him the place is a &quot;jungle.&quot;

At a ghetto bar, Axel meets a prostitute, and they go to an upstairs room of a hotel. Threatened by her pimp after refusing to pay her when she refuses to take off all her clothes, Axel eggs the pimp to cut him with his switchblade. The pimp, thinking Axel crazy, backs off, and Axel repeatedly punches him, knocks him to the floor, and kicks him over and over. Frantic, the prostitute picks up the fallen blade and slashes Axel across the face.

Bleeding from his facial wound, Axel staggers down the stairs, looks at himself in a mirror, and smiles enigmatically at his slashed cheek.

==Production==
The film was the first produced screenplay by James Toback. Toback had worked as an English lecturer at the City College of New York and had a gambling problem. He originally wrote &quot;The Gambler&quot; as a semi-autobiographical novel but halfway through started envisioning it as a film and turned it into a screenplay.

Toback completed it in 1972 and showed it to his friend Lucy Saroyan, who introduced Toback to Robert De Niro. Toback became enthused about the possibility of De Niro playing the lead. He showed the script to his literary agent who gave it to Mike Medavoy who attached director Karel Reisz. Reisz did not want to use De Niro and cast James Caan instead.

&quot;Caan became a great Axel Freed, although obviously different from the character De Niro would have created&quot;, wrote Toback later. It was filmed at a time when leading actor James Caan was battling his own addiction to cocaine. Caan says the film is one of his favorites. &quot;It&#x27;s not easy to make people care about a guy who steals from his mother to pay gambling debts.&quot;

Some see the film as a loose adaptation of the short 1866 novel &quot;The Gambler&quot; by Fyodor Dostoyevsky.

==Reception==
Roger Ebert awarded his top grade of four stars and wrote that the film &quot;begins as a portrait of Axel Freed&#x27;s personality, develops into the story of his world, and then pays off as a thriller. We become so absolutely contained by Axel&#x27;s problems and dangers that they seem like our own.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was less impressed, writing, &quot;The movie follows Axel&#x27;s downward path with such care that you keep thinking there must be some illuminating purpose, but there isn&#x27;t ... Mr. Reisz and Mr. Toback reportedly worked a couple of years putting the screenplay into this shape, which is lifeless.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and said that director Karel Reisz &quot;is most successful in presenting Axel as a true sickie and his adversaries as genuinely ruthless. The latter is no mean feat, inasmuch as ruthless movie mobsters are a dime-a-dozen in these post-&#x27;Godfather&#x27; days ... We know that the film is a success, because it doesn&#x27;t really matter whether Axel is a winner or a loser as the film ends. &#x27;The Gambler&#x27; is a personality study, and like &#x27;California Split,&#x27; its story does not hang on its ending.&quot; Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; called &quot;The Gambler&quot; &quot;way ahead as the better of two current films about the gambling compulsion. Director Karel Reisz has one of his most compelling and effective films. Title star James Caan is excellent and the featured players are superb.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; declared it &quot;a cool, hard, perfectly cut gem of a movie, as brilliant and mysteriously deep as a fine diamond. At its center is an hypnotically absorbing performance, at once charming and dismaying, by James Caan, who must certainly have an Academy Award nomination for it.&quot; Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; stated, &quot;At &#x27;The Gambler,&#x27; we&#x27;re trapped at a maniacal lecture on gambling as existential expression. And, as almost always happens when a movie is predictable and everything is analyzed and labelled, the actions and the explanations aren&#x27;t convincing. Gambling is too easy a metaphor for life; as metaphor, it belongs to the world of hardboiled fiction.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; agreed, calling it &quot;a well-made movie invalidated at every turn by a script with big, literary pretensions but little if any dramatic credibility.&quot; Jonathan Rosenbaum of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that his problem with the film &quot;is not so much a surfeit of psychological analysis—the script offers hints, not explicit causes explaining Axel&#x27;s condition—as too little to account for his behaviour naturalistically, and too much to permit any sustained acceptance of the character on an allegorical or mythical level ... there is nothing in Axel that suggests hidden depths; indeed, despite Caan&#x27;s consistent professionalism, the actor seems to be as disinterested in his character as Axel seems to be in himself.&quot;

After Caan&#x27;s death, &quot;Filmink&quot; described the film as &quot;peak ‘70s Caan with the star at his swaggering charming curly haired best.&quot;

The film holds a score of 82% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 11 reviews.

==Remake==

In August 2011, Paramount Pictures announced a remake of the 1974 film &quot;The Gambler&quot; with the original producers, Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff. Intended as a new directorial project for Martin Scorsese, it was reported that Leonardo DiCaprio was attached as the star and William Monahan would write the screenplay.

In a 2011 interview, Toback gave the story of the original film&#x27;s autobiographical background and development, and criticized the announcement of the remake.

Scorsese left the project and filmmaker Todd Phillips was in talks to take over as of August 2012.

In September 2013, Mark Wahlberg and director Rupert Wyatt expressed interest in remaking the film. The film was released on December 25, 2014.

<text>August Wöhler (22 June 1819 – 21 March 1914) was a German railway engineer, best remembered for his systematic investigations of metal fatigue.

==Life==
Born in the town of Soltau, Hanover, the son of local teacher Georg Heinrich Wöhler, he showed early mathematical ability and won a scholarship to study at the Higher Vocational College of Hannover from 1835, under the direction of Karl Karmarsch.

In 1840, he was recruited to the Borsig works in Berlin where he worked on the manufacture of rail tracks. In 1843, after a brief stay in Hannover, he started to receive instruction in locomotive driving in Belgium, returning as an engineer on the Hanover-Brunswick line of the Royal Hanoverian State Railways. By 1847, Wöhler was chief superintendent of rolling stock on the Lower Silesian-Marcher railway in Frankfurt (Oder).

The railroad was nationalised by the Prussian state railways in 1852 and Wöhler&#x27;s growing reputation led to his appointment by the Prussian Ministry of Commerce to investigate the causes of fracture in railroad axles, work that was to occupy Wöhler over the next two decades. The recognition of his keen administration and technical leadership resulted in his appointment as director of the newly formed Imperial Railways in Alsace-Lorraine in 1874, based at the board&#x27;s headquarters in Straßburg, a post he held until his retirement in 1889.

==Fatigue studies==
Wöhler started his axle investigations by research into the theory of elasticity and was led, in 1855, to a method for predicting the deflection of lattice beams that anticipated the work of Émile Clapeyron. He also introduced the practice of supporting one end of a bridge on roller bearings to allow for thermal expansion.

His work on fatigue marks the first systematic investigation of &quot;S-N curves&quot;, also known as &quot;Wöhler curves&quot;, to characterise the fatigue behaviour of materials. Such curves can be used to minimise the problem of fatigue by lowering the stress at critical points in a component. Wöhler showed clearly that fatigue occurs by crack growth from surface defects until the product can no longer support the applied load. The history of a fracture can be understood from a study of the fracture surface. He developed apparatus for repeated loading of railway axles, mainly because many accidents were caused by sudden fatigue fracture. The presentation of his work at the Paris Exposition in 1867 brought it to a wide international audience.

Wöhler was an advocate of state standardisation, testing and certification of iron and steel.

He died in Hannover in 1914.

<text>Domenico di Pace Beccafumi (1486May 18, 1551) was an Italian Renaissance-Mannerist painter active predominantly in Siena. He is considered one of the last undiluted representatives of the Sienese school of painting.

==Biography==
Domenico was born in Montaperti, near Siena, the son of Giacomo di Pace, a peasant who worked on the estate of Lorenzo Beccafumi. Seeing his talent for drawing, Lorenzo adopted him, and commended him to learn painting from Mechero, a lesser Sienese artist. In 1509 he travelled to Rome, where he learned from the artists who had just done their first work in the Vatican, but soon returned to Siena. However, while the Roman forays of two Sienese artists of roughly his generation (Il Sodoma and Peruzzi) had imbued them with elements of the Umbrian-Florentine Classical style, Beccafumi&#x27;s style remains, in striking ways, provincial. In Siena, he painted religious pieces for churches and mythological decorations for private patrons, only mildly influenced by the gestured Mannerist trends dominating the neighbouring Florentine school. There are medieval eccentricities, sometimes phantasmagoric, superfluous emotional detail and a misty non-linear, often jagged quality to his drawings, with primal tonality to his colouration that separates him from the classic Roman masters.

==Pavement of Duomo di Siena==
In addition to painting, he also directed the celebrated pavement of the cathedral of Siena from 1517 to 1544, a task that took over a century and a half. The pavement shows vast designs in commesso work—white marble, that is, engraved with the outlines of the subject in black, and having borders inlaid with rich patterns in many colours. From the year Beccafumi was engaged in continuing this pavement, he made very ingenious improvements in the technical processes employed and laid down scenes from the stories of Ahab and Elijah, of Melchisedec, of Abraham and of Moses. He made a triumphal arch and an immense mechanical horse for the procession of the emperor Charles V on his entry into Siena.

==Critical assessment and legacy==

Compared to the equilibrated, geometric, and self-assured Florentine style, the Sienese style of painting edges into a more irrational and emotionally unbalanced world. Buildings are often transected, and perspectives are awkward. The setting is often hallucinogenic; the colours are discordant. For example, in the &quot;Nativity&quot; (Church of San Martino) hovering angels form an architectural hoop, and figures enter from the shadows of a ruined arch. In his &quot;Annunciation&quot;, the Virgin resides in a world neither in day nor dusk, she and the Angel Gabriel shine while the house is in shadows. In &quot;Christ in Limbo&quot; (Pinacoteca Nazionale, Siena), an atypically represented topic, Christ sways in contrapposto as he enters a netherworld of ruins and souls. S. J. Freedberg compares his vibrant eccentric figures to those of the Florentine mannerist contemporary Rosso Fiorentino, yet more &quot;optical and fluid&quot;. While all the elements of the expected religious scenes are here, it is like a play in which all the actors have taken atypical costumes, and forgotten some of their lines.

In medieval Italy, Siena had been an artistic, economic, and political rival of Florence; but wars and natural disasters caused a decline by the 15th century. Stylistically, Beccafumi is among the last in a line of Sienese artists, a medieval believer of miracles awaking in Renaissance reality.

<text>Infinite In All Directions (1988) is a book on a wide range of subjects, including history, philosophy, research, technology, the origin of life and eschatology, by theoretical physicist Freeman Dyson. The book is based on the author&#x27;s Gifford Lectures delivered in Aberdeen in 1985. &quot;Infinite in All Directions&quot; can roughly be summarized as a treatise on the universe and humanity&#x27;s role and its responsibilities.

<text>Liu Xin (23 CE), courtesy name Zijun, was a Chinese astronomer, classicist, imperial librarian, mathematician, and politician during the Western Han and Xin dynasties. He later changed his name to Liu Xiu () due to the naming taboo of Emperor Ai of Han. He was the son of Imperial librarian Liu Xiang and an associate of other eminent thinkers such as the philosopher Huan Tan. Liu was a prominent supporter of the Old Text classics.

==Early life==
Liu Xin was the son of Confucian scholar Liu Xiang (77–6 BCE). Liu was a distant relative of Liu Bang, the founder of the Han dynasty, and was thus a member of the ruling dynastic clan (the Liu family). Liu Xin&#x27;s paternal grandfather ranked as a &quot;hou&quot; (, roughly &#x27;marquess&#x27;). As a young man, Liu helped his father in cataloguing the contents of the imperial library, and his friendship with the well-connected minister Wang Mang brought him power and rewards, rising under Emperor Ai of Han to the rank of Palace Attendant and Chief Commandant of Imperial Equipages ().

==Literary work==
===Librarian===
As a curator of the imperial library he was the first to establish a library classification system and the first book notation system. At this time the library catalog was written on scrolls of fine silk and stored in silk bags. Liu Xin&#x27;s &quot;Qilüe&quot; (; &quot;Seven Surveys&quot;) has not survived, but it formed the basis for the later bibliographic treatise &quot;Yiwenzhi&quot; (; &quot;Treatise on Arts and Letters&quot;) in the &quot;Book of Han&quot;, which acted as a model for later imperial bibliographies.

As the imperial librarian, Liu Xin both catalogued and annotated or edited ancient texts. These projects of his produced what became definitive texts of a number of orthodox canons of Chinese philosophy and history. 

Liu Xin played an important role in the transmission of the &quot;Zuozhuan&quot;. A scholar of the Old Texts school, he was attracted to the &quot;Zuozhuan&quot; earlier graphical forms, whose inaccessibility deterred the compound exegesis found in the rival &quot;Chunqiu&quot; commentarial traditions. In editing the &quot;Zuozhuan&quot; with the assistance of Yin Xian (), Liu rearranged the material into chronological order to map more neatly onto the &quot;Chunqiu&quot; chronicle as the &quot;Gongyang&quot; and &quot;Guliang&quot; commentaries did. He aimed to have an imperial academician assigned to the work, a crucial bureaucratic step towards canonization in the official orthodoxy.

Liu&#x27;s advocacy for the &quot;Zuozhuan&quot; was controversial in his own day, partly due to its lineage and prior reputation, and partly due to his own approach towards the situation. This scholarly dispute is sometimes taken as evidence for a larger dispute about classic texts written using variant scripts.

===Old Text proponent===
During Liu Xin&#x27;s career, there may have been some debate about certain texts called &quot;guwen&quot; (, &quot;Ancient Script Texts&quot;). One set of manuscripts discovered by Kong Anguo in the Western Han was consistently labeled as &quot;guwen&quot; owing to the graphical forms it preserved, a script which had diverged during the Eastern Zhou from the more conservative script of the state of Qin which became the official and only standard following their unification in 221 BCE. As a consequence of the variant graphical forms, parts of the text were already difficult to decipher for Han scholars.

It is not clear to what extent the content of &quot;guwen&quot; works differed from the transmitted versions of the same titles, nor what criteria allowed for labeling a document &quot;guwen&quot;. It may have been the case that even a handful of words would suffice to impart this characteristic upon the text that contained them.

Liu Xin was attracted to &quot;guwen&quot; texts, and his position in the imperial library meant he was well placed to ensure that these versions would officially be considered the authoritative ones.

===Integrity of transmitted literature===
From the 19th through early 20th centuries, antiquarians and historians, beginning with Kang Youwei, accused Liu of excessive editing, to the point of falsifying historical texts. These criticisms were systematically analysed by the Doubting Antiquity School of historians. According to their theory, first articulated by Qian Mu in 1930, Liu edited ancient texts for political purposes, particularly the &quot;Rites of Zhou&quot;, the &quot;Zuozhuan&quot;, and the Mao commentary to the &quot;Shijing&quot;. This accusation of forgery had legitimate precedent: in the late 17th century Yan Ruoqu demonstrated that the transmitted &quot;Classic of History&quot; was mostly a forgery dating to the 4th century. This text had been based on the Ancient Script version, and only the parts that were present in the separately transmitted New Script version could be considered authentically early.

Liu Xin was a political ally of the powerful and divisive minister Wang Mang, who would go on to usurp the Han dynasty around the turn of the millennium for a brief period known as the Xin dynasty. As the imperial librarian, Liu had the power to establish the definitive redactions of ancient texts and expunge variant versions. According to his accusers, the librarian falsified accounts of ancient historical events, and inserted into the legendary lineage of ancient rulers figures or relationships that were either invented, or borrowed from separate legends. In this way, he created a narrative of ancient rulers and successive dynasties which satisfied the &quot;five phases&quot; theory, wherein each ruler and/or dynasty represented one of the five traditional Chinese elements (&quot;wuxing&quot;) , between which the Mandate of Heaven rotated. An account thus falsified would satisfactorily explain the rule of the Han and Xin dynasties in terms of the phases they were said to represent, and according to the forgery theory, Liu Xin&#x27;s edited account conveniently showed a series of successions between various claimed ancestors of the Han and Xin houses. 

The possibility of Liu Xin&#x27;s forgeries became a crucial question for the Doubting Antiquity School in their search for a rationalist past for China. They drew evidence from discrepancies between the texts edited by Liu and earlier or contemporaneous texts. For example, figures or events appearing in Liu&#x27;s edited versions did not appear in earlier or contemporaneous texts. The forgery theory has been largely discredited.

==Scientific work==
===Calculation of pi ()===
For centuries before the usurpation of Wang Mang ( 9–23), the Chinese had used the value of 3 for their calculation of pi, the ratio of a circle&#x27;s circumference to its diameter. Some time between the years 1 and 5, Liu Xin was the first Chinese researcher to give a geometrical figure which implies the improved approximation π ≈ 3.1547, although the exact method he used to reach this figure is unknown. The original &quot;jialiang hu&quot; standard Liu Xin designed and used in his measurements is still extant. Sinologist Joseph Needham inspected it in Beijing, describing it as follows:

The standardised &quot;chia liang hu&quot; (has) a square with each side 1 &quot;chhih&quot; (foot) long, and outside it a circle. The distance from each corner of the square to the circle (&quot;thiao phang&quot;) is 9 &quot;li&quot; 5 &quot;hao&quot;. The area of the circle (&quot;mu&quot;) is 162 (square) &quot;tshun&quot; (inches), the depth 1 &quot;chhih&quot; (foot), and the volume (of the whole) 1620 (cubic) &quot;tshun&quot; (inches).

Later early Chinese mathematicians such as Zhang Heng (78–139) and Liu Hui (fl. 3rd century) would improve Liu&#x27;s calculation for pi, and were improved upon in turn by Zu Chongzhi (429–500).

===Standards and measures===
As Emperor of Xin, Wang Mang attempted to return to the lost ways of the ancient sage-kings, a legendary golden age of order and peace. Assisting him in some of the practicalities of this ambition was Liu Xin. Upon ascending the throne, Wang Mang named Liu Xin his &quot;Guoshi&quot; (, &quot;Professor Laureate&quot;), a newly created office which was one of the Four Viziers (, named after a legend about a constellation), the most powerful and exalted ministers in the empire. As part of the rebranding schema implemented across the government, Liu Xin gained the noble title &quot;Eminence of New Excellence&quot; He assisted in standardising the measures of liquid volume and the harmonic frequencies of musical instruments. The &quot;jialiang hu&quot; used to calculate pi was designed as the standard for the five measures of liquid volume stipulated by statute, and was constructed with a separate compartment for each of them. 

In the course of his scientific work, Liu wrote a treatise which survives in the &quot;Book of Han&quot;: &quot;Lüli zhi&quot; (, &quot;Treatise on Standards and Calendrics&quot;). This text records detailed information about Han dynasty mathematics, measures of length and volume, harmonics, weights and balances, and the calendar via &quot;wuxing&quot; theory.

===Astronomy and natural philosophy===
As a classicist, Liu Xin was able to support the legitimation of his patron Wang Mang as a restorer of an ancient mode of governance, and as a proponent and theorist of the &quot;generative cycle&quot; of the popular &quot;five phases&quot; theory, Liu advised the new emperor on ritual matters to better accord with these fundamental essences. Liu additionally developed a new more accurate model of astronomy, the Triple Concordance calendar (; &quot;San tong li&quot;), for predicting the motion of heavenly bodies. In the second half of the 20th century, a crater on Mars was named in his honor.

==Death==
Although Liu Xin was originally a loyal partisan of Wang Mang, after Wang&#x27;s troops suffered defeat on July 7, 23 at the Battle of Kunyang, Liu Xin plotted with others to overthrow Wang Mang. The plot was discovered, and all the conspirators committed suicide or were executed.

<doc id="871330" wikidata="Q572652" url="?curid=871330" title="Aldrovanda vesiculosa">
<text>Aldrovanda vesiculosa, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is the sole extant species in the flowering plant genus &quot;Aldrovanda&quot; of the family Droseraceae. The plant captures small aquatic invertebrates using traps similar to those of the Venus flytrap. The traps are arranged in whorls around a central, free-floating stem, giving rise to the common name. This is one of the few plant species capable of rapid movement.

While the genus &quot;Aldrovanda&quot; is now monotypic, up to 19 extinct species are known in the fossil record. While the species displays a degree of morphological plasticity between populations, &quot;A. vesiculosa&quot; possesses a very low genetic diversity across its entire range.

&quot;A. vesiculosa&quot; has declined over the last century to only 50 confirmed extant populations worldwide. These are spread across Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. However, potentially invasive populations exist in the eastern United States. It is kept by hobbyists.

==Morphology==
&quot;Aldrovanda vesiculosa&quot; is a rootless aquatic plant. Seedlings develop a short protoroot; however, this fails to develop further and senesces. The plant consists of floating stems reaching a length of . The trap leaves grow in whorls of between 5 and 9 in close succession along the plant&#x27;s central stem. The actual traps are held by petioles which have air sacs that aid in flotation. One end of the stem continually grows while the other end dies off. Growth is quite rapid ( per day in Japanese populations), so that in optimal conditions a new whorl is produced once or more each day.

===Trap===
The actual traps consist of two lobes which fold together to form a snap-trap similar to that of the Venus flytrap, except that it is smaller and located underwater. These traps, which are twisted so that the trap openings point outward, are lined on the inside by a fine coating of trigger hairs, snapping shut in response to contact with aquatic invertebrates and trapping them. The closing of this trap takes 10–20 milliseconds, making it one of the fastest examples of plant movement in the kingdom. This trapping is only possible in warm conditions of at least . Each trap is surrounded by between four and six long bristles that prevent triggering of traps by debris in the water.

=== Nutrient acquisition ===
&quot;A. vesiculosa&quot; is able to grow in nutrient-poor habitats not only due to its carnivory, but also due to its ability to re-utilize nutrients from senesced shoots, and its high affinity for mineral nutrients in water.

===Reproduction===
====Flowers====
The small, solitary white flowers of &quot;A. vesiculosa&quot; are supported above the water by short peduncles which arise from whorl axes. The flower only opens for a few hours, after which the structure is brought back beneath the water for seed production. The seeds are cryptocotylar: the cotyledons remain hidden within the seed coat and serve as an energy store for the seedling. Flowering, however, is rare in temperate regions and poorly successful in terms of fruit and seed development.

====Divisions====
&quot;Aldrovanda vesiculosa&quot; reproduces most often through vegetative reproduction. In favourable conditions, adult plants will produce an offshoot every , resulting in new plants as the tips continue to grow and the old ends die off and separate. Due to the rapid growth rate of this species, countless new plants can be produced in a short period of time in this fashion.

===Turions===
Winter-hardy &quot;Aldrovanda&quot; form turions as a frost survival strategy. At the onset of winter, the growth tip starts producing highly reduced non-carnivorous leaves on a severely shortened stem. This results in a tight bud of protective leaves which, being heavier and having released flotational gases, breaks off the mother plant and sinks to the water bottom, where temperatures are stable and warmer. Here it can withstand temperatures as low as . In the wild, &quot;Aldrovanda&quot; turions have been observed to have a relatively low rate of successful sinking. Those nutritious turions that fail to sink are then grazed by waterfowl or are killed by the onset of frost. In spring when water temperatures rise above , turions reduce their density and float to the top of the water, where they germinate and resume growth. Non-dormant turion-like organs can also form in response to summer drought.

==Distribution==
&quot;Aldrovanda vesiculosa&quot; is the second most widely distributed carnivorous plant species, only behind members of the genus &quot;Utricularia&quot;, native to Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. &quot;Aldrovanda&quot; is spread mainly through the movement of waterfowl: plants sticking to the feet of a bird are transported to the next aquatic destination on the bird&#x27;s route. As a result, most &quot;Aldrovanda&quot; populations are located along avian migratory routes. Throughout the last century the species has become increasingly rare, listed as extinct in an increasingly large number of countries. In the 1970s, carnivorous plant hobbyists introduced this species to small backyard ponds in the United States in the states of New Jersey, Virginia, and the Catskills of New York, and they may be a potentially invasive species due to their effects on aquatic invertebrates.

== Threats ==

=== Habitat degradation and modification ===
The waterwheel plant faces significant conservation threats related to habitat degradation and human-induced modifications. Residential and commercial development, along with agricultural and aquacultural activities, pose immediate risks to the species. The impacts of these activities on the plant&#x27;s aquatic habitats are of particular concern.

=== Environmental changes ===
Across Europe, the species is confronted by several environmental challenges, as identified by the Commission of the European Union. Acidification, canalization, drainage, eutrophication, pollution, and various forms of habitat modification are highlighted as threats. These changes in the natural environment have the potential to disrupt the waterwheel plant&#x27;s habitats and populations.

=== Potential illegal trade ===
While the extent and effects of illegal trade remain uncertain, it is believed that some illegal activities involving &quot;Aldrovanda vesiculosa&quot; may occur. This potential threat adds complexity to the conservation challenges faced by the species.

==Habitat==
&quot;A. vesiculosa&quot; prefers clean, shallow, warm, standing water with bright light, low nutrient levels, and a slightly acidic pH (around 6). It can be found floating amongst Juncus, reeds, and even rice.

The Waterwheel (&quot;Aldrovanda vesiculosa&quot;) thrives in a range of aquatic habitats, including small fens, peat-bog pools, billabongs, lakes, lagoons, and river deltas. It prefers oligo-mesotrophic and dystrophic systems with low nutrient levels. These plants are commonly found in shallow backwaters or the littoral zones of larger lakes, where they face less competition from other aquatic species and where water levels remain relatively stable throughout the growing season. The Waterwheel is highly intolerant of habitat degradation, and even minor changes in water chemistry can lead to local extinction.

==Botanical history==

&quot;Aldrovanda vesiculosa&quot; was first mentioned and illustrated in 1691 by Leonard Plukenet, based on collections made in India. He named the plant &quot;Lenticula palustris Indica&quot;. The modern botanical name originates from Gaetano Lorenzo Monti, who described Italian specimens in 1747 and named them &quot;Aldrovandia vesiculosa&quot; in honor of the Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi. When Carl Linnaeus published his &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; in 1753, the &quot;i&quot; was dropped from the name (an apparent copying error) to form the modern binomial.

<text>The following is a complete list of all volumes of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, with notes for each issue. The list is updated as of March 19, 2024.

==&quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15 (August 1962)==
This comic book plot is written by Stan Lee and illustrated by Steve Ditko. Features the first appearances of Spider-Man, Aunt May, Uncle Ben, Flash Thompson, and Liz Allan. High school student Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider, thus gaining the proportionate strength, speed, and agility of a spider, along with a precognitive &quot;spider-sense&quot; and later creating a web-shooting device. Peter becomes Spider-Man, an instant TV sensation, but coming out of a TV studio one day, Peter does not stop an escaping burglar, claiming it is not his problem. A few days later, he comes home to find his Uncle Ben has been shot and goes to track down the murderer, only to find that it was the same burglar that he had let escape a few days earlier. Peter blames himself for his uncle&#x27;s death and realizes that with great power there must also come great responsibility.

<doc id="871335" wikidata="Q1921993" url="?curid=871335" title="Merregnon">
<text>Merregnon is an orchestral music series that combines symphonic compositions with fantasy storytelling. Since its launch in 1999, the project has produced several albums and live concert performances. The most recent works, &quot;Merregnon: Land of Silence&quot; (2021) and &quot;Merregnon: Heart of Ice&quot; (2024), were premiered by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra and the Deutsche Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz, respectively. They were designed to introduce families and younger audiences to orchestral music, following in the tradition of The Carnival of the Animals by Saint-Saëns and Prokofiev&#x27;s Peter and the Wolf.

The &quot;Merregnon&quot; series is directed and produced by Thomas Böcker, founder of Merregnon Studios. It has involved contributions from renowned composers in the video game industry, including Nobuo Uematsu, Yoko Shimomura, Chris Hülsbeck, and Yuzo Koshiro.

== &quot;Merregnon: Heart of Ice&quot; ==

Merregnon: Heart of Ice features an original score composed by Nobuo Uematsu. The world premiere took place on February 29, 2024, in Ludwigshafen, Germany, with the Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz performing the music under the direction of Eckehard Stier. The project also includes the contributions of children&#x27;s author Frauke Angel, who wrote the story. &quot;Merregnon: Heart of Ice&quot; marks Uematsu&#x27;s first orchestral work created specifically for a concert hall setting.

=== Story ===
In the icy world of &quot;Merregnon&quot;, Kjugo, a wooden robot, and Beru, a dog, embark on a quest to find Kjugo&#x27;s creator, Nuobi, who has been kidnapped by the sinister Ice Wind Dancer, Goyakai. As they traverse the land of eternal frost, they encounter numerous dangers while pursuing their mission to confront Goyakai.

In the final battle, Kjugo&#x27;s pure soul breaks Goyakai&#x27;s freezing hold over the land. With Goyakai&#x27;s defeat, Nuobi is freed from his icy prison, and the world of &quot;Merregnon&quot; is restored, bringing back warmth, laughter, and joy.

=== Reception ===
&quot;Merregnon: Heart of Ice&quot; was described as &quot;a thrilling adventure with high drama and a fulminant battle for humanity&quot; by the German newspaper Die Rheinpfalz. Writer Ulrike Dansauer, who attended the premiere, highlighted the project&#x27;s broad appeal, noting, &quot;The story is very popular with young audiences: devout listening from even the youngest children, closed eyes from adults, completely absorbed in the tale.&quot;

Thomas Nickel, a writer for the German gaming magazine &quot;M!Games&quot;, echoed this sentiment, stating: &quot;Despite the late hour, the younger visitors are just as fascinated as the older ones.&quot; He compared the musical style of &quot;Merregnon: Heart of Ice&quot; to early &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; soundtracks, but found it &quot;fresh and original.&quot; Nickel further commented on the expressiveness of the compositions, saying that &quot;the joy of the music and composition is very evident&quot; and &quot;the compositions speak for themselves&quot; without needing to support graphics or gameplay, allowing them to &quot;convey drama and characters&quot; independently.

== &quot;Merregnon: Land of Silence&quot; ==

Merregnon: Land of Silence features original music by Yoko Shimomura and a story by children&#x27;s author Frauke Angel. This project marks Shimomura&#x27;s first concert work. It was first performed by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Andreas Hanson, and filmed at the Stockholm Concert Hall in June 2021. The video was made freely available on the orchestra&#x27;s website, premiering on September 10, 2021. Since 2022, &quot;Merregnon: Land of Silence&quot; has been performed by orchestras worldwide.

=== Story ===
In the grey world of &quot;Merregnon&quot;, the orphan Miru and her dog Mako encounter a wounded bird, Ikari, who guides them on an adventure to the north. Ikari speaks of a green region governed by the warrior Skissor, who keeps a dragon, Yamakito, captive. Miru and her friend Hikito decide to embark on the journey.

When they arrive, the group finds Yamakito, assigned to guard the lush northern region. They confront Skissor, who attempts to deter them. With Ikari’s assistance, Yamakito escapes captivity, and his song signals Skissor’s defeat. This event is followed by the unification of the land and the end of &quot;Merregnon&quot;&#x27;s long silence.

=== Reception ===
&quot;Merregnon: Land of Silence&quot; was described as a &quot;symphonic anime&quot; by the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;. &quot;Deutschlandfunk&quot; spoke with Böcker in a radio feature entitled &quot;Music education with a video game composer&quot;, and &quot;Klassik Radio&quot; elaborated on the fact that &quot;Merregnon: Land of Silence&quot; is intended to introduce children playfully to the orchestral world, on an &quot;enchanting adventure journey&quot; in a &quot;symphonic anime fairy tale for the entire family.&quot; Böcker was invited to write a guest article for &quot;Gramophone&quot; about orchestral music and its power to inspire audiences young and old. In it, he emphasises the importance of a family concert that &quot;entertains and promotes immersion&quot;, because according to him, &quot;it awakens an enthusiasm that leads to spontaneous engagement with the subject, without any finger-wagging or other overtly educational components.&quot; In an extensive article on &quot;Wired&quot;, Shimomura and Böcker were joined by Stefan Forsberg, executive director of the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra. Forsberg points out that music by game composers is &quot;a part of the daily lives of so many people around the world&quot;, and the author notes that &quot;Merregnon: Land of Silence&quot; could provide &quot;a welcome hand for struggling concert halls.&quot; In a webinar hosted by the &quot;German Embassy in Tokyo&quot;, Shimomura, Böcker, and Angel talked about the process leading up to the concert &quot;Merregnon: Land of Silence&quot;.

== &quot;Merregnon, Volumes 1 and 2&quot; ==

In 1999, Böcker&#x27;s interest in game music prompted him to approach composers around the world and invite them to collaborate on his original &quot;Merregnon&quot; CDs. &quot;Merregnon, Volume 1&quot; was released in 2000, distributed by &quot;synSoniq Records&quot;, featuring orchestral music and narration, as well as an accompanying booklet with text and illustrations. Music from &quot;Merregnon, Volume 2&quot; premiered at the first ever &quot;Symphonic Game Music Concert&quot; outside Japan in Leipzig, Germany, also produced by Böcker, before the full work was released one year later in 2004 by &quot;Totentanz Records&quot;, distributed by &quot;SoulFood / Sony Music&quot;. In 2005, &quot;Merregnon, Volume 2&quot; was published in the Japanese market by &quot;Dex Entertainment&quot;, distributed by &quot;Sony Music Japan&quot;.

&quot;Merregnon, Volume 1&quot; used almost no live instrument recordings for its soundtrack, while &quot;Merregnon, Volume 2&quot; featured 74 orchestra musicians. For most of the composers, this was new territory, so the project&#x27;s music director for the second volume, Andy Brick, had to ensure that &quot;everyone delivered a score that the orchestra could properly perform.&quot; Brick states that synthesizers and samplers, as in volume 1, &quot;can do a lot that you just can&#x27;t do with real instruments.&quot; His task was to help the composers transfer their sound visions to the orchestra. Volume 1 and 2&#x27;s principal composer, Fabian Del Priore, who developed many of the musical themes, confirmed that it gave him &quot;a lot of experience in orchestration, notation and score writing.&quot;

=== Reception ===
Both albums were highly praised by critics. The first CD was commended for its appeal in that it &quot;impressively shows how pompous melodies and complex themes are able to attract especially young people&quot;, according to the German magazine &quot;Amiga Plus&quot;. The website &quot;Epic Sound&quot; noted that &quot;Merregnon&quot; &quot;brings together some of the brightest young talents in the composing world&quot; and &quot;Music4Games&quot; attested that the project &quot;sets new standards in the world of videogame music.&quot; German gaming network &quot;Krawall&quot; found that &quot;hardly has any music CD ever succeeded in creating such opulent pictures in the mental eye.&quot; A verdict that &quot;PC Joker&quot; joined in its review: &quot;This disc is a hit!&quot;

The second CD received much acclaim as well, with the gaming website &quot;DemoNews&quot; writing that it was &quot;simply breath-taking&quot;, magazine &quot;Nautilus&quot; admiring its professionalism and going on to say that &quot;fans of the music from big silver screen epics will find a new treasure in &quot;Merregnon 2&quot;.&quot; &quot;MacLife&quot; went on to report &quot;game music of Hollywood quality&quot;, while music magazine &quot;Astan&quot;, in addition to praising the music (&quot;sounding like an epos to one of the big movies, like Troy and Gladiator&quot;), described the booklet as &quot;luxurious&quot; and &quot;simply beautiful and expensively designed.&quot; This was echoed by &quot;MangasZene&quot; (&quot;a lovingly designed booklet&quot;), additionally highlighting the &quot;first rate music.&quot; The German gaming website &quot;4Players&quot; dedicated a large special to &quot;Merregnon 2&quot; over several months, where various interviews were conducted with Böcker and the composers.

According to Böcker, working on the two &quot;Merregnon&quot; albums was a &quot;hallmark moment&quot; that eventually led to the development and production of his &quot;Game Concerts&quot; series.
