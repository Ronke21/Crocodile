He received a Purple Heart for wounds in combat.

In addition to the Purple Heart, Blocker received the National Defense Service Medal, Korean Service Medal with two bronze campaign stars, Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation, United Nations Service Medal, Korean War Service Medal, and Combat Infantryman Badge.

===Acting career===

In 1957, Blocker appeared in a Three Stooges short, &quot;Outer Space Jitters&quot;, playing the Goon, billed as &quot;Don Blocker&quot;.

He made two appearances on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. First as a cavalry lieutenant on August 24, 1956, in &quot;Alarm at Pleasant Valley&quot; (S1E39) and on October 18, 1958, in &quot;Thoroughbreds&quot;. He appeared in 1957 as Will in the episode &quot;A Time to Die&quot; of the ABC/Warner Bros. Western series &quot;Colt .45&quot;.

In 1957, Blocker was cast in episodes of David Dortort&#x27;s NBC series &quot;The Restless Gun&quot; as a blacksmith and as a cattleman planning to take his hard-earned profit to return to his family land in his native Minnesota. In 1957, he had at least two roles as a bartender in an episode of the syndicated Western-themed crime drama &quot;Sheriff of Cochise&quot;, starring John Bromfield, and in the film &quot;Gunsight Ridge&quot;. Also in 1957, he appeared in the &quot;Cheyenne&quot; episode &quot;Land Beyond the Law&quot;, playing one of the outlaw minions (Pete). He also appeared in &quot;The Rifleman&quot;.

In 1958, he played a prison guard and later had a recurring role as Tiny Budinger in the NBC Western series &quot;Cimarron City&quot;, starring George Montgomery, John Smith and Audrey Totter. He was seen in &quot;The Señorita Makes a Choice&quot;, a 1958 episode of Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Zorro&quot; series, as well as an episode, &quot;Underground Ambush&quot;, of &quot;Sergeant Preston of the Yukon&quot;, playing Mule Conklin.

In 1958, Blocker had a supporting role as Sergeant Broderick in &quot;The Dora Gray Story&quot; on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Wagon Train&quot;. That same year, he appeared in &quot;Stagecoach Episode&quot; of the NBC Western &quot;Jefferson Drum&quot;, starring Jeff Richards.

In March 1958, he appeared as Joe, a thief, in season one of &quot;Have Gun Will Travel&quot;, in the episode &quot;Gun Shy&quot;.

Blocker was cast as bearded poker-playing rodeo performer Cloudy Sims in the 1958 episode &quot;Rodeo&quot; on the David Janssen crime drama, &quot;Richard Diamond, Private Detective&quot;.

Another 1959 role was as Del Pierce in &quot;Johnny Yuma&quot;, the first episode of the ABC Western series &quot;The Rebel&quot;, starring Nick Adams.

====&quot;Bonanza&quot; (1959–1972)====

Blocker&#x27;s big break came in 1959, when he was cast as Eric &quot;Hoss&quot; Cartwright on the NBC television series &quot;Bonanza&quot;, playing that role in 415 episodes until his death. Blocker said he portrayed the gentle-natured Hoss character with a Stephen Grellet statement in mind: &quot;We shall pass this way on Earth but once, if there is any kindness we can show, or good act we can do, let us do it now, for we will never pass this way again.&quot;

In 1963, Blocker starred with Frank Sinatra in the comedy &quot;Come Blow Your Horn&quot;. He worked with Sinatra again in 1968 in the &quot;Tony Rome&quot; film sequel &quot;Lady in Cement&quot;, playing a menacing tough guy. Stanley Kubrick attempted to cast Blocker in his film &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, after Peter Sellers elected not to add the role of Major T.J. &quot;King&quot; Kong to his multiple other roles, but according to the film&#x27;s co-writer, Terry Southern, Blocker&#x27;s agent rejected the script. The role went to Slim Pickens, who played the iconic scene of riding an atomic bomb down while waving his cowboy hat.

In 1968, Blocker starred as John Killibrew, a blacksmith, who had convinced a number of settlers to follow him to California and founded the town of Arkana. This TV film, &quot;Something for a Lonely Man&quot;, also featured Susan Clark, John Dehner, Warren Oates, and Don Stroud. In 1970, Blocker portrayed a love-shy in &quot;The Cockeyed Cowboys of Calico County&quot;, with Nanette Fabray as a love prospect and a supporting cast featuring Jim Backus, Jack Elam, Noah Beery Jr., and Mickey Rooney. Blocker also appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Flip Wilson Show&quot; comedy hour.

Director Robert Altman befriended Blocker while directing episodes of &quot;Bonanza&quot;. Years later, he cast Blocker as Roger Wade in &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot;, but Blocker died before filming began. The role then went to Sterling Hayden, and the film was dedicated to Blocker.

Also in 1963, Blocker started and received partial ownership in a successful chain of Bonanza Steakhouse restaurants, in exchange for serving, in character as Hoss, as their commercial spokesman, and making personal appearances at franchises.

===Personal life===

Originally from Bowie County, Texas, Blocker arrived in Los Angeles in 1958 planning to do post-grad work at UCLA but began getting acting roles. Previously, while attending Sul Ross State College, he had a non-speaking part in a stage play and found that he was attracted to acting. He played in Summer Stock in Boston in 1950 after getting his degree at the college.

Blocker was a Free Methodist. He married Dolphia Parker, whom he had met while a student at Sul Ross State University. Their children are Hollywood actor Dirk Blocker, Hollywood producer David Blocker, and twin daughters Debra Lee (artist) and Danna Lynn. David Blocker won a 1998 Emmy for producing &quot;Don King: Only in America&quot;.

Blocker, a liberal Democrat, was among Hollywood celebrities who supported Pat Brown&#x27;s re-election in 1966 as governor of California against Ronald Reagan. In 1968, Blocker backed then-U.S. Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota for the Democratic presidential nomination. Blocker later supported the eventual Democratic Party nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, also of Minnesota, for the presidency against the Republican Richard Nixon.

Blocker kept a house in Inglewood, California, and a Tudor-style mansion in the Hancock Park area of Los Angeles.

On the 2010 PBS special, &quot;Pioneers of Television: Westerns&quot;, actor Mitch Vogel, who played adopted brother Jamie Cartwright on &quot;Bonanza&quot;, said Blocker, &quot;was so easy to get to know—the kind of guy you could go and have a beer with.&quot;

Blocker, a performance automobile fan, once owned a 1965 Chevrolet Chevelle SS396 &quot;Z-16&quot; (RPO Z16 option), as Chevrolet was the commercial sponsor of the show. He also owned a 1965 Huffaker Genie MK10 race car, nicknamed the &quot;Vinegaroon&quot;. The car was run by Nickey Chevrolet in the 1965 and 1966 U.S. Road Racing Championship series, as well as the 1966 Can-Am championship.

===Death===

On May 13, 1972, Blocker died in Los Angeles, at age 43, of a pulmonary embolism, following gallbladder surgery at Daniel Freeman hospital. A news item provides these specifics: &quot;Blocker went into the hospital for gall bladder surgery, developed a blood clot in his lung, and died&quot;.

The writers of &quot;Bonanza&quot; took the unusual step of referencing a major character&#x27;s death in the show&#x27;s storyline that autumn. A 2011 report added that &quot;this was to be the first time in television history that a show had dealt with, or even mentioned, the death of one of its characters&quot;. Specifics as to the death were not discussed in the series, but some years later, in the sequel series &quot;&quot;, one character stated that &quot;Hoss drowned trying to save another&#x27;s life&quot;.

&quot;Bonanza&quot; lasted another season without Hoss, and the 14th and final season ended on January 16, 1973. That season was &quot;by far the least popular and least requested season in the show&#x27;s rerun package&quot;. &quot;Bonanza&quot; co-star Michael Landon said years later that whenever he needed to cry for a scene, he would think of Dan Blocker&#x27;s death.

Blocker&#x27;s remains were interred in a family plot in Woodman Cemetery, in De Kalb, Texas. The common grave site is marked by a plain stone with the name &quot;B. Dan D. Blocker&quot; engraved. Three family members are buried beside him – his father, mother, and sister.

<text>The Afternoon of a Faun () is a ballet choreographed by Vaslav Nijinsky for the Ballets Russes, and was first performed in the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris on 29 May 1912. Nijinsky danced the main part himself. The ballet is set to Claude Debussy&#x27;s symphonic poem &quot;Prélude à l&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot;. Both the music and the ballet were inspired by the poem &quot;L&#x27;Après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot; by Stéphane Mallarmé. The costumes, sets and programme illustrations were designed by the painter Léon Bakst.

The style of the 12-minute ballet, in which a young faun meets several nymphs and proceeds to flirt with and chase them, was deliberately archaic. In the original scenography designed by Léon Bakst, the dancers were presented as part of a large tableau, a staging reminiscent of an ancient Greek vase painting. They often moved across the stage in profile as if on a bas relief. The ballet was presented in bare feet and rejected classical formalism. The work had an overtly erotic subtext beneath its façade of Greek antiquity and ended with a scene of graphic sexual desire. This led to a controversial reception from both audience and critics, and the quality of the ballet was debated widely through multiple news reviews. The piece also led to the dissolution of a partnership between Nijinsky and Michel Fokine, another prominent choreographer for the Ballets Russes, due to the extensive amount of time required to train the dancers in what was then an unconventional style of dance.

&quot;L&#x27;Après-midi d&#x27;un Faune&quot; is considered one of the first modern ballets and proved to be as controversial as Nijinsky&#x27;s &quot;Jeux&quot; (1913) and &quot;Le Sacre du printemps&quot; (1913).

==Creation==
===Conception===
The ballet was developed as a possible new production for Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes. Michel Fokine choreographed most of the dances that the company performed. Fokine had originally worked as a choreographer with the Imperial Russian Ballet. In addition to Fokine, all the different specialists for the new ballet company had also come from the Imperial Russian Ballet company. Initially, the Ballets Russes took advantage of the 3 months summer break when the Imperial ballet closed and its staff were free to do other things. The Ballets Russes used this time to stage their own ballets and operas in Paris. Diaghilev began looking around for an alternative to the style which Fokine customarily delivered before deciding to allow his senior male dancer, Vaslav Nijinsky, to try his hand at choreography.
Diaghilev, Nijinsky, and Bakst developed the original idea for &quot;The Afternoon of a Faun&quot;. The artwork on ancient Greek vases and Egyptian and Assyrian frescoes, which they viewed in the Louvre museum, was their source of inspiration. Bakst had previously worked with Vsevolod Meyerhold who was an innovative theatre producer and director that had introduced concepts like two-dimensionality, stylized postures, a narrow stage, and pauses and pacing to emphasise significant moments into his productions. Bakst, Nijinsky, and Diaghilev transferred these concepts to a ballet format in &quot;Faun&quot;. Nijinsky&#x27;s aim was to reproduce the stylised look of the ancient artworks on the stage. In his portrayal of the faun, Nijinsky managed to reproduce exactly the figure of a satyr shown on Greek vases in the Louvre.

===Development===
Jean Cocteau, a French poet, explained the Mallarmé poem to Nijinsky who spoke little French, and helped develop an outline for the ballet&#x27;s acts. Claude Debussy&#x27;s symphonic poem, Prélude à l&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune, was used for the orchestral music. After the summer season in Paris, Nijinsky returned to St Petersburg for the new Russian season. There, he began work on the choreography with the help of his sister, Bronislava Nijinska, who was herself a senior dancer. Bronislava would later choreograph her own ballets for the Ballets Russes.

Léon Bakst designed the stage setting which was more impressionist than representational. The splashes of muted greys, browns, and greens on the backcloth mirrored the fluid music, suggesting the scene rather than defining it precisely. It was hung at the line of the second wings rather than the back of the stage to deliberately narrow the performance space. The stage floorcloth was black as far back as the mound which the Faun lies upon. From there, it was green to the back of the stage. Baskt organized the lighting to emphasise the flattened look of the dance.
The dancers&#x27; costumes were designed to stand out against the muted background. Nijinsky wore a cream body suit with brown piebald patches to represent the coat of an animal. His faun costume was completed with the addition of a short tail, a belt of vine leaves, and a cap of woven golden hair surrounding two golden horns which gave the impression of a circlet. Nijinsky&#x27;s ears were extended with wax to look more pronounced and pointed while his makeup was designed to make his face appear more animal. The nymphs wore white muslin that was tailored into long pleated tunics and decorated with stencilled patterns in blue or rust red. Some tunics had checkered borders and others had wavy lines or leaves. The nymphs had little makeup, except that their eyes were painted in pale pink. They wore tight wigs of golden rope which hung down in long strands. The Faun and senior nymph wore golden sandals while the rest of the dancers had bare white feet with rouged toes.

===Difficulties===
Vaslav Nijinsky was an exceptional dancer but not an exceptional teacher. Nijinsky&#x27;s sister notes in her memoir that, throughout the development of all his ballets, he had difficulty explaining to others what he needed them to do and operated through demonstration rather than explanation. Bronislava notes that Nijinsky ignored the gap in ability between the dancers he directed and his artistic vision for the choreography. Nijinsky had difficulty accepting the limitations of others, expecting them to be able to perform as well as he could. Bronislava acted as his guinea-pig, trying out dances and positions. She describes the experience as feeling as though Nijinsky were a sculptor and she the clay which he positioned through each step.

Nijinsky and his sister performed the partially developed work for Diaghilev and Bakst in St. Petersburg at the start of 1911. From the beginning, the ballet&#x27;s development was kept secret until Diaghilev was ready to stage it, because he feared it would offend Fokine. The company was relying on Fokine for other ballets that were also in production, and thought that he might walk out if his position as undisputed choreographer to the company was challenged. The &quot;régisseur&quot;, Grigoriev, was let into the secret in early 1912. In March of the same year, rehearsals began with other members of the company. Fokine, who now knew about the project, resented the loss of rehearsal time for his own productions. He attacked Nijinsky&#x27;s incompetence at getting across his own ideas, claimed he only had the job because he was Diaghilev&#x27;s lover, and announced his intention to resign which confirmed Diaghilev&#x27;s fears.

The 12-minute ballet required 90 rehearsals. This led to the reduction of time Fokine received with the dancers which was the basis for many of his complaints. All the dancers suffered the same difficulties Bronislava had reported in trying to adapt to the strange new movements. Nijinsky&#x27;s choreography felt completely unnatural to them which lengthened the time they needed for training. By this time, Nijinsky had fully devised what he wanted each dancer to do, so he could focus on training them without having to work on developing the ballet at the same time. The general view amongst the dancers was that he was mad and the ballet was doomed to failure. Even Diaghilev started to have doubts and asked Nijinsky whether there might be changes to the difficult choreography. In response to this, Nijinsky threatened to resign.

==Choreography==
Much of the movement takes place with groups of dancers passing each other in parallel lines, as if in a moving frieze. As the focus of attention passes from one group to another, dancers take a stylised pose, as might be seen on an ancient vase, and become still. The music is suggestive of a languorous summer&#x27;s day in an exotic clime, and the dancers move steadily and languorously to match.
The ballet starts with the sound of a flute as the curtain rises to show the faun lying on his mound. The faun is supporting himself with his left arm while his right holds a flute to his lips. He then eats from first one and then another bunch of grapes, holding them to his face. The movements are stylised and angular, but are also suggestive of the movements of an animal. The flute music is then joined by horns and a rippling harp. As the flute tune repeats for the third time, three nymphs walk on from the left of the stage with synchronised, stylised movements. Then, two more nymphs, moving in unison but differently from the first group, join the other dancers onstage.

They perform a long arabesque to music from two flutes and a harp. These instruments are joined by strings as the music progresses while a sixth nymph walks to centre stage and holds a pose before joining the pair. The six nymphs freeze when the last nymph enters with a mechanical walk across the stage as she lets her outer veils fall to reveal a short golden garment beneath. The nymphs all begin to move. The tableau on the stage consists of a group of three, a group of two, and a single nymph who either dances with the pair to balance the scene or strikes poses at variance to the pair.

The faun remains motionless as the first six nymphs enter, but then he follows the progress of the last nymph with his eyes. A clarinet starts to play as his head begins to move, and he rises to his feet as a cello joins in. The six nymphs have begun to bathe the new arrival. Accompanied by an oboe, they move in and out, kneeling and rising with their elbows turned out from their sides as they keep their hands pointed at their waists or to the sky. Violins accompany an increase in tempo as the faun descends from his mound. The pair of nymphs depart to the left of the stage carrying one of the discarded veils while the first three nymphs carry off a second veil to the left. The music changes to a soulful clarinet solo. The sixth nymph who has been left isolated centre stage suddenly notices the faun behind her and runs off to the left, hands in air.

The faun and the last nymph are alone on stage as the music changes with a new air of excitement from the woodwind section which builds along with the violins and the harp. The faun approaches the nymph with bursts of movement, and the two dance around each other in a standoffish courting display. He executes his only jump in the ballet across an imagined stream issuing from a waterfall shown on the backdrop. The music becomes louder as the nymph becomes more enthusiastic. It subsides again as they link arms, but she breaks away and exits flat footed to the left. The faun watches her go in disappointment before smiling, then he turns back to her discarded veil. To a solo violin backed by horns, flute, and clarinet, the faun throws back his head and bares his teeth. Laughing, he takes the veil. He examines it with great delight as the harp and the flute repeat the opening melody.

The woodwind brings in staccato chords as the three nymphs return from stage left to challenge the faun who falls back from their advance. The music changes with an oboe taking up the tune as the nymphs turn back offstage again with their hands in the air. The faun examines the veil, holding it in the air against his head until the cor anglais and flutes accompany the pair of nymphs as they enter from stage left. They again challenge the faun with flapping arms, and are followed by the lagging sixth nymph who dances the same challenge just as the pair turn to leave. The faun falls back, exchanging stares with the nymphs before the last nymph breaks off and she too retires. The faun is now alone. He nods his head over the veil and returns to his mound. A cello and flute carry the tune with the harp continuing in the background. The faun holds the veil to his face before spreading it on the ground and lowering his body onto it with his head tucked in and arms to his sides. Soft horns and a harp accompany a final flute passage as his body tenses and curls back, head rising, before relaxing back onto the veil.

Lydia Sokolova, the first English dancer in the Ballets Russes, described Nijinsky&#x27;s performance as &quot;thrilling.&quot; She highlighted his powerful, animalistic movements in his handling of the nymph&#x27;s veil, and lauded his acting during this visceral scene.

==Performances==
=== Premiere and reaction ===
On 28 May 1912, an invited audience attended the dress rehearsal. There was silence as it finished. Gabriel Astruc, a French impresario who assisted Diaghilev with finance, publicity, and bookings, came on stage and announced that the ballet would be repeated. This time, there was some applause before the audience was presented champagne and caviar in the theatre foyer.

&quot;The Afternoon of a Faun&quot; was premiered on 29 May at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris. The faun was danced by Vaslav Nijinsky, senior nymph by Nelidova, and Bronislava Nijinska danced the 6th nymph. The conductor was Pierre Monteux. On the opening night, the ballet was met with a mixture of applause and booing, and again it was repeated. After the repeated performance, the audience applauded, and the sculptor, Auguste Rodin who was in the audience, stood up to cheer.

&quot;Commedia&quot; published a long article by its editor, Gaston de Pawlowski, where he praised the ballet and supported articles by Louis Vuillemain and Louis Schneider. Vuillemain wrote that this ballet had the most pleasing acting, dancing, and music he had ever seen before. &quot;Le Théâtre&quot; carried a review by Schneider where he applauded Nijinsky&#x27;s ability to accurately adapt his choreography to Debussy&#x27;s composition.

A strikingly different response appeared in &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, where the editor, Gaston Calmette, also carried a front page article on the ballet. Calmette denounced the ballet after declining to publish the favourable report of his normal theatre critic, Robert Brussel. Calmette wrote that the ballet was not artful, imaginative, nor meaningful. He then goes on to criticize the choreography of the faun as being &quot;filthy&quot; and &quot;indecent&quot;, which he argued deservedly incited the booing at the initial showings. Calmette was much more complimentary about Nijinsky&#x27;s other performances that were part of the same evening&#x27;s schedule as the showing of the &quot;Faun&quot;. He applauded Nijinsky in Le Spectre de la Rose, which Michel Fokine choreographed, and said that this was the kind of ballet that should be performed for the public.
Diaghilev responded to Calmette by forwarding letters of support to &quot;Le Figaro&quot; which they published the following day. The painter, Odilon Redon, a friend of Mallarmé, suggested how much the author of the original poem on which the ballet had been based would have approved: &quot;more than anyone, he would have appreciated this wonderful evocation of his thoughts.&quot;

In another letter that Diaghilev submitted, Auguste Rodin wrote that Nijinsky&#x27;s acting and attention to detail over the movements of his body worked wonderfully to convey the character and mind of the faun. Rodin noticed the antique forms of the frescoes and other art in Nijinsky&#x27;s display. The artist expressed the feeling that Nijinsky was a sculptor&#x27;s &quot;ideal model.&quot;

The dispute over the ballet spread, taking on a political tone. &quot;Le Figaro&quot; was accused of attacking the Ballets Russes because they opposed France&#x27;s political policy to ally with Russia, and that they represented an opening to smear all things Russian. The Russian ambassador became involved, French politicians signed petitions, and the President and Prime Minister asked a government commission to report. The Paris police attended the second night of the ballet because of its alleged obscenity, but took no action after they saw the public&#x27;s support. The ending of the ballet may have been temporarily amended to be more proper. Tickets to all performances were sold out, and Parisians clamoured to obtain them by any means.

Michel Fokine claimed to be shocked by the explicit ending of &quot;Faun&quot;, despite at the same time suggesting that the idea of the faun lying down in a sexual manner on top of the nymph&#x27;s veil had been plagiarised from his own ballet &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;. In this ballet, Fokine choreographed the hero to lie down in a comparable manner upon a woman. However, Fokine found some points to compliment in the ballet, including the use of pauses by the dancers where traditionally there would have been continuous movement, as well as the juxtaposition of angular choreography with the very fluid music.

Fokine&#x27;s animosity to &quot;Faun&quot; is partly explainable by his own difficulties in preparing &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot;, which was to premiere the week following &quot;Faun&quot; but was not complete. Diaghilev tried to cancel &quot;Daphnis&quot;; instead it was postponed to 8 June. &quot;Daphnis&quot; only received two performances even though it was considered a success by critics such as &quot;Le Figaro&quot;. The company was sharply divided into two factions by the quarrel, some supporting Nijinsky and some Fokine. The final result consisted of Fokine leaving the company on bad terms with Nijinsky regardless of the fact that the partnership between Nijinsky as dancer and Fokine as choreographer had been enormously successful for them both.

===Further performances by the Ballets Russes===

The Ballets Russes chose not to show &quot;Faun&quot; in the London season immediately following its Paris appearance. Instead, the company premiered &quot;L&#x27;Oiseau de feu&quot;, &quot;Narcisse&quot;, and &quot;Thamar&quot; for the first time in London. In the autumn, a German tour began at the Stadt-Theater in Cologne on 30 October before moving to the New Royal opera House in Berlin on 11 December. The Berlin programme included &quot;Faun&quot; which was performed before the Kaiser, the King of Portugal, and sundry dignitaries. Diaghilev reported to Astruc that this showing was a &quot;huge success&quot; which resulted in ten encores without protest. Serge Gregoriev, who had just resigned from the Mariinsky Theatre to join Diaghilev full-time as stage manager, was more sanguine, reporting that &quot;faun fell flat,&quot; but he confirmed the overall success of the German tour.

In spring 1913, the ballet was performed in Vienna, where it again had a cool reception, though not so bad as &quot;Petrushka&quot;, which the orchestra of the Vienna Opera House initially refused to play because they disliked the music. The company returned to London, where the response was completely different and both ballets were well-received. During its first performance, there was some hissing in the audience, but the majority favoured it, and it received an encore once again. &quot;The Times&quot; described Nijinsky&#x27;s performance as &quot;extraordinarily expressive,&quot; and complimented the ballet on its ability to appeal to the audience in a way the public had never seen a ballet do before. Writing in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, music critic Richard Capell said, &quot;The miracle of the thing lies with Nijinsky – the fabulous Nijinsky, the peerless dancer, who as the faun does no dancing.&quot; Capell goes on to praise his acting as well as the single leap which he deems an &quot;illumination&quot; of the faun&#x27;s dichotomy between man and animal.

===Later performances by other companies===
In 1931, shortly after the death of Diaghilev, when some of his dancers settled in London, the Rambert Ballet took &quot;L&#x27;Après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot; into its repertoire. Leon Woizikovsky, who had danced the faun in the last years of the Diaghilev company and whom Nijinsky taught, reproduced the ballet for Rambert&#x27;s company. Rambert Ballet revived &quot;Faun&quot; for several years. The reproduction met with criticism from Cyril Beaumont who commented in his book that the ballet becomes “meaningless, if given, as sometimes happens, without the essential nymphs.”

At the Nureyev Festival at the London Coliseum in July 1983, Rudolf Nureyev danced the faun as part of a Homage to Diaghilev in a mixed bill of ballets. Then, in the late 1980s, dance notation specialists Ann Hutchinson Guest and Claudia Jeschke reconstructed the ballet from Nijinsky&#x27;s own notebooks, his dance notation, and the photographs of the dancers that Baron Adolph de Meyer produced shortly after the original performance of the ballet. This reconstructed version is often presented alongside Nijinsky&#x27;s other works or repertoire from the Ballets Russes.

==Other art==

Lita Grey Chaplin, the second wife of Charlie Chaplin, notes in her memoir that the nymph dance in the dream sequence of the Chaplin film &quot;Sunnyside&quot; (1919) was a tribute to the ballet as well as to Nijinsky whom the filmmaker had met two years prior.

A pastiche of the ballet forms part of the music video for &quot;Queen&quot;&#x27;s 1984 single &quot;I Want to Break Free&quot;. Freddie Mercury dances the role of the faun, with dancers from the Royal Ballet also performing, including Jeremy Sheffield. This version also proved controversial in the US.

<text>Democratic Alliance (&quot;Alliance démocratique&quot;, AD) was a short-lived political party in Quebec, Canada, founded by the Montreal journalist and politician Nick Auf der Maur. This left-of-centre political party was mainly based among the anglophone communities in Montreal.

The Democratic Alliance was closely linked with the Montreal Citizens&#x27; Movement, a political party at the municipal level. Bob Keaton, the DA’s candidate in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce riding had served as an MCM councilor on Montreal City Council. The DA presented a center-left platform that was described by the Montreal Gazette as being &quot;complementary to that of the PQ though diametrically opposed on the issue of secession&quot;.

After the election, the DA was enthusiastic despite not winning any seats in the National Assembly and were planning to meet to discuss strategy for the next phase. The party’s best result was in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce riding where Bob Keaton placed a close third behind the Liberals and the Union Nationale.

The party was disbanded shortly after the 1976 Quebec general election, in which it won 0.53% of the popular vote.

<text>The American, often nicknamed as the American Gas, was a small gasoline-powered buggy manufactured by the American Motor Carriage Company in Cleveland from 1902 to 1903, and sold until early 1904. It was one of nearly two dozen American automobile marques to bear this name.

The company evolved in August 1901 from an interior decorating studio. Its president was George F. McKay, with F.D. Dorman as vice president and general manager, J.F. Morris acting as secretary-treasurer and George H. Wadsworth as superintendent.

The car was developed by chief engineer George W. Dunham. It was a light (1000 lb) two-passenger runabout with a water-cooled, single-cylinder engine fitted under the seat, a planetary transmission and a single chain to the rear axle. The wheel base was . The most outstanding item of the vehicle was its wheel-steering device. A 7-gallon fuel tank was fitted, which would give a driving range of about . As usual at the time, the car was right-hand driven. Minimalistic coachwork included a small compartment in front. The car came painted in &quot;French carmine&quot;, with the running gear in &quot;Valentine red&quot;, and the seat bench trimmed in black leather. The car&#x27;s initial price was $1000, and the company came never close to the targeted capacity of 200 cars per year.

In September 1903, the company came under receivership management by the Prudential Trust Company. Dunham became general manager, looking to assemble as many cars as possible from parts ready. These were sold for $750 until April 1904, when a new company named American Automobile Company moved in. They never produced a car.

Press noted that the American Motor Carriage Company was the first automobile manufacturer in Cleveland that failed. This is not true, but it was the most important by then.

<text>The Obie Awards or Off-Broadway Theater Awards are annual awards given since 1956 by &quot;The Village Voice&quot; newspaper to theater artists and groups involved in off-Broadway and off-off-Broadway productions in New York City. Starting just after the 2014 ceremony, the American Theatre Wing became the joint presenter and administrative manager of the Obie Awards. The Obie Awards are considered off-Broadway&#x27;s highest honor, similar to the Tony Awards for Broadway productions.

==Background==

The Obie Awards were initiated by critic Jerry Tallmer and Edwin (Ed) Fancher, publisher of &quot;The Village Voice,&quot; who handled the financing and business side of the project. They were first given in 1956 under the direction of Tallmer. Initially, only off-Broadway productions were eligible; in 1964, off-off-Broadway productions were made eligible. The first Obie Awards ceremony was held at Helen Gee&#x27;s cafe.

With the exception of the Lifetime Achievement and Best New American Play awards, there are no fixed categories at the Obie Awards, and the winning actors and actresses are all in a single category titled &quot;Performance.&quot; There are no announced nominations. Awards in the past have included performance, direction, best production, design, special citations, and sustained achievement. Not every category is awarded every year. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; also awards annual Obie grants to selected companies; in 2011, these grants were $2,000 each to Metropolitan Playhouse and Wakka Wakka Productions. There is also a Ross Wetzsteon Grant, named after its former theater editor, in the amount of $2,000 (in 2009; in 2011 the grant was $1,000), for a theatre that nurtures innovative new plays.

The first awards in 1955-1956 for plays and musicals were given to &quot;Absalom&quot; (Lionel Abel) as Best New Play, &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, Best All-Around Production and &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; as Best Musical.

Other awards for off-Broadway theatre are the Lucille Lortel Awards, the Drama Desk Awards, the Drama League Award, and the Outer Critics Circle Awards.

In September 2014, the American Theatre Wing joined the &quot;Village Voice&quot; as co-presenters, with the Wing having &quot;overall responsibility for running&quot; the Awards. In 2021, the Wing took over as sole presenter of the Obie Awards.

<doc id="853411" wikidata="Q3036985" url="?curid=853411" title="Dorchester, New Brunswick">
<text>Dorchester is a community in Westmorland County, New Brunswick, Canada. The community became part of the new town of Tantramar in the 2023 New Brunswick local governance reform. Originally incorporated as a town in 1911, it was converted to a village in 1966. By 1825 it had been named for Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester, an 18th-century Governor-General of the old Province of Quebec, but prior to that was called Botsford.

It is located on the eastern side of the mouth of the lush Memramcook River valley near the river&#x27;s discharge point into Shepody Bay. Dorchester is an English-speaking community but it is adjacent to French-speaking Acadian areas farther up the Memramcook River valley.

==History==

The shire town of the county, Dorchester has several fine historic homes and civic buildings most of which were built by local lawyer and Master Builder, John Francis Teed. During the 19th century, Dorchester and neighbouring Dorchester Island were important shipbuilding centres. Numerous master mariners also lived in Dorchester and vicinity during the Golden Age of Sail. Prior to rail service, it was a centre for the stagecoach, as well as a busy ship port. The community was transformed with the construction in 1872 of the Intercolonial Railway between Halifax and Rivière-du-Loup. In 1911, the village founded the Dorchester Light and Fire Company which is now known as the Dorchester Volunteer Fire Department. In 1965, the village courthouse was destroyed by arson. Many in the community came to the town square to watch the building burn. The only thing left of the courthouse was the safe. It is now used in the village hall where the courthouse once stood. The courthouse was never rebuilt, and much of the economy behind it left the community.

Dorchester was home to Edward Barron Chandler, a father of confederation and his family who built their home, Chandler House, commonly referred to as Rocklynn which is now a nationally recognized historic property.

Premier Louis Robichaud&#x27;s government during the 1960s created an industrial park and deepwater loading pier at nearby Dorchester Cape as part of a regional economic development program. Envisioned to be used by the petro-chemical industry, the government constructed a new road and railway spur along with an electrical substation and the pier as well as a building that was envisioned to be used as a fertilizer plant. The industrial park had no tenants and the pier sitting in the Memramcook River was quickly silted in by mud from the tides of the Bay of Fundy. Today all that remains are the roads and the railbed as well as some broken street lights, a deteriorating sea wall and the empty shell of the abandoned fertilizer plant.

In 1998, the Dorchester Jail was also closed. It is currently a fitness gym and a bed and breakfast.

On 1 January 2023, Dorchester amalgamated with the town of Sackville and parts of three local service districts to form the new town of Tantramar. The community&#x27;s name remains in official use.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Dorchester had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Economy==
The village&#x27;s main employer today is the Correctional Service of Canada, which operates a prison complex now comprising the medium-security (once maximum-security) Dorchester Penitentiary, and the minimum-security Westmorland Institution.

Many residents commute to work in the nearby towns of Sackville and Amherst or the cities of Moncton and Dieppe.

A recent influx of residents is creating a new demand for Dorchester.

Tourism is centred on the historic and natural features of the area. One of Dorchester&#x27;s most historic buildings houses the Keillor House Museum. The annual shorebird migration to the mud flats of nearby Johnson&#x27;s Mills is celebrated by an oversize model of a semi-palmated sandpiper situated in the village square.

==Transportation==
Although situated on the CN Rail main line between Halifax and Montreal, Dorchester no longer has a passenger station, with travellers having to entrain/detrain in Sackville or Moncton. The nearest airport is the Greater Moncton International Airport, a 40 km drive in Dieppe.

The company was never large; its peak production was 1400 vehicles built in 1920. In that same year a powerful 58 hp Herschell-Spillman six-cylinder engine replaced old 45 hp Rutenber six. American was commonly advertised as a &#x27;Smile Car&#x27; because the company believed their cars offered trouble-free miles for their owners. In 1923 the company became associated with the Bessemer Motor Truck Corporation; that October, the company became Amalgamated Motors Corporation, incorporating Northway and Winther as well. Before spring of 1924 American car was out of production. The total number of cars produced was about 6000 cars.

For a brief time, famed racing driver and future automobile designer Louis Chevrolet worked as a vice-president and the head of American&#x27;s engineering department.

<text>Shades of Black is a community organization in the Handsworth area of Birmingham, England, formed after the Handsworth riots in the mid-1980s, extending from the 1990s to work in other deprived areas including Stechford.

The group works with local schools at two large allotments in the city.

Children from disadvantaged backgrounds are taught about vegetable gardening. The produce is distributed to elderly people who cook for themselves, to elderly day care centres and any surplus used at a local catering college to help students prepare food from other cultures.

The founder, Mrs E C McGhie-Belgrave, a former probation worker, was awarded an MBE by the Queen in 2002.

<doc id="853417" wikidata="Q5587490" url="?curid=853417" title="Gossip (Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls album)">
<text>Gossip is the double LP debut album by Australian rock group Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls. Produced by Alan Thorne and Paul Kelly, it was released on Mushroom Records in September 1986, which peaked at No. 15 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart, and achieved gold record status. There was commercial success for &quot;Before Too Long&quot; which peaked at No. 15 and &quot;Darling It Hurts&quot; reached No. 25 on the related Singles Chart. &quot;Gossip&quot; was released in different forms, initially as a double album with 24 tracks, it was edited down to a single 15-track LP for North American and European release on A&amp;M Records, when released on CD in North America, it featured 17 tracks.

At the 1986 Countdown Australian Music Awards the album was nominated for Best Australian Album.

Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls had been named for a lyric in Lou Reed&#x27;s song &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;, but all North American and European releases were credited to Paul Kelly and the Messengers due to possible racist interpretations. &quot;Darling It Hurts&quot; peaked at No. 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Chart in 1987. The initial 1987 Australian CD release contained 21 tracks; in 2005, a special deluxe 2-CD version was released in Australia which contained all 24 tracks. In October 2010, it was listed at No. 7 in the book, &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;.

==Background==
After relocating from Melbourne to Sydney in 1985, Paul Kelly had recorded and released a solo album &quot;Post&quot;. Kelly then began to play and record with a full-time band, which included Michael Armiger on bass guitar, Michael Barclay on drums, Steve Connolly on guitar, eventually bassist Jon Schofield, and keyboardist Peter Bull joined. Through a joke based on Lou Reed&#x27;s song &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;, the band became known as Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls. Their first release was &quot;From St Kilda to Kings Cross&quot; but it did not chart. The line-up of the Coloured Girls changed rapidly with some stability late in 1985 as Barclay, Bull, Connolly and Schofield. Stuart Coupe, Kelly&#x27;s manager, advised him to sign with Regular Records due to difficulty re-signing with Mushroom&#x27;s Michael Gudinski. Michelle Higgins, Mushroom&#x27;s Public relations officer, was a Kelly supporter and locked herself into a Sebel Townhouse Hotel room for nearly a week in mid-1986, refusing to leave until Gudinski had signed Kelly to a two-album recording contract.

In September 1986 Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls released the 24-track double LP &quot;Gossip&quot;. The album included remakes of songs from &quot;Post&quot; and also featured &quot;Maralinga (Rainy Land)&quot;, a song about the effects of British atomic testing on the Maralinga Tjarutja – indigenous people of Maralinga, South Australia. &quot;Gossip&quot; peaked at No. 15 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Charts, with singles chart success for &quot;Before Too Long&quot; which peaked at No. 15 and &quot;Darling It Hurts&quot; reaching No. 25. A single LP version of &quot;Gossip&quot; featuring 15 tracks was released in North America and Europe by A&amp;M Records in July, 1987. Due to possible racist connotations the band changed its name, for international releases, to Paul Kelly and the Messengers. They made an American tour, initially supporting Crowded House and then head-lining, travelling across the United States by bus. &quot;Darling It Hurts&quot; peaked at No. 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart in 1987. &quot;The New York Times&quot; rock critic, John Pareles wrote &quot;Mr. Kelly sang one smart, catchy three-minute song after another - dozens of them - as the band played with no-frills directness.&quot; following the band&#x27;s performance at the Bottom Line Club in New York.

<doc id="853423" wikidata="Q179962" url="?curid=853423" title="Job (biblical figure)">
<text>Job ( ; &quot;″Īyyōv&quot;; &quot;Iṓb&quot;) is the central figure of the Book of Job in the Bible. In Islam, Job () is also considered a prophet.

Job is presented as a good and prosperous family man who is suddenly beset with horrendous disasters that take away all he holds dear—a scenario intended to test Job&#x27;s faith in God. Struggling mightily to understand this situation, Job reflects on his despair but consistently remains devout.

The language of the Book of Job, combining post-Babylonian Hebrew and Aramaic influences, indicates it was composed during the Persian period (540-330 BCE), with the poet using Hebrew in a learned, literary manner.

== In the Hebrew Book of Job ==

The Hebrew Book of Job is part of Ketuvim (&quot;Writings&quot;) of the Hebrew Bible. Not much is known about Job based on the Masoretic Text.

The characters in the Book of Job consist of Job, his wife, his three friends (Bildad, Eliphaz, and Zophar), a man named Elihu, God, and angels.

It begins with an introduction to Job&#x27;s character—he is described as a blessed man who lives righteously in the Land of Uz. The Lord&#x27;s praise of Job prompts an angel with the title of &quot;satan&quot; (&quot;Adversary&quot;) to suggest that Job served God simply because God protected him. God removes Job&#x27;s protection and gives permission to the angel to take his wealth, his children, and his physical health (but not his life). Despite his difficult circumstances, he does not curse God, but rather curses the day of his birth. And although he anguishes over his plight, he stops short of accusing God of injustice. Job&#x27;s miserable earthly condition is simply God&#x27;s will.

In the following, Job debates with three friends concerning his condition. They argue whether it was justified, and they debate solutions to his problems. Job ultimately condemns all their counsel, beliefs, and critiques of him as false. God then appears to Job and his friends out of a whirlwind. God rebukes the three friends and gives them instruction for the remission of sin, followed by Job being restored to an even better condition than his former wealthy state (). Job is blessed to have seven sons, and three daughters named Jemimah (which means &quot;dove&quot;), Keziah (&quot;cinnamon&quot;), and Keren-happuch (&quot;horn of eye-makeup&quot;). His daughters were said to be the most beautiful women in the land.

==In the Greek Old Testament Book of Job==
The Septuagint, an ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament, has a revised and updated final verse that claims Job&#x27;s genealogy, asserting him to be a grandson of Esau and a ruler of Edom.
== In other religious texts ==

=== Judaism ===
* He is mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel.
* He is cited as someone &quot;who held fast to all the ways of justice&quot; in the deuterocanonical Book of Sirach.

=== Christianity ===
* He is praised for his perseverance in the Christian Epistle of James.
* He is the protagonist of a pseudepigraphal book called the Testament of Job.

=== Mormonism ===
* He is also mentioned in the Doctrine and Covenants, one of the four sacred texts of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

=== Islam ===
* He is discussed as a prophet in the Quran by the name of Ayūb. 
The Quran describes Job as a righteous servant of Allah, who was afflicted by suffering for a lengthy period of time. However, it clearly states that Job never lost faith in God and forever called to God in prayer, asking Him to remove his affliction:

And [mention] Job, when he called to his Lord, &quot;Indeed, adversity has touched me, and you are the Most Merciful of the merciful.&quot;

— Quran, sura 21 (The Prophets), ayah 83 

=== Baháʼí ===
*In the writings of the Baháʼí Faith: A lengthy tablet was written by Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, the first part of which is focused on Job. The Tablet is often referred to as the Tablet of Patience or the Tablet of Job.

==Job in Judaism==
A clear majority of rabbis saw Job as having in fact existed as a historically factual figure.

According to a minority view, Job never existed. In this view, Job was a literary creation by a prophet who used this form of writing to convey a divine message. On the other hand, the Talmud (in Tractate Baba Batra 15a–16b) goes to great lengths trying to ascertain when Job actually lived, citing many opinions and interpretations by the leading sages.

Job is further mentioned in the Talmud as follows:

*Job&#x27;s resignation to his fate.
*When Job was prosperous, anyone who associated with him even to buy from him or sell to him, was blessed.
*Job&#x27;s reward for being generous.
*David, Job and Ezekiel described the Torah&#x27;s length without putting a number to it.
*Job was in fact one of three advisors that Pharaoh consulted, prior to taking action against the increasingly multiplying Israelites in the Book of Exodus. As described in the Talmud: Balaam urged Pharaoh to kill the Hebrew new-born boys; Jethro opposed this decree; and Job, though personally opposed to the decree, kept silent and did not protest it. It is for Job&#x27;s silence that God subsequently punishes him with his bitter afflictions. However, the Book of Job itself contains no indication of this, and to the prophet Ezekiel, Yahweh refers to Job as a righteous man of the same calibre as Noah and Daniel.

==Christian views==
Christianity accepts the Book of Job as canon in its Old Testament. In addition, Job is mentioned in the New Testament of the Christian Bible: the Epistle of James () paraphrases Job as an example of patience in suffering.

Job&#x27;s declaration, &quot;I know &quot;that&quot; my redeemer liveth&quot; (), is considered by some Christians to be a proto-Christian reference to Christ as the Redeemer, and is the basis of several Christian hymns, as well as the opening scene of Part III of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;. However, Jewish bible commentators and scholars point out that Job &quot;insists on a divine hearing in his lifetime&quot; (cf. Job 16:19–22).

=== Feast Days ===
He is commemorated by the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod in their Calendar of Saints on May 9, by the Roman Catholic Church on May 10, and by the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches on May 6.

He is also commemorated by the Armenian Apostolic Church on May 6 and December 26, and by the Coptic Orthodox Church on April 27 and August 29. The Armenian Apostolic Church commemorates Job along with John the Baptist on the Thursday after the third Sunday of the Feast of the Assumption.

==Islamic views and Quranic account==
In the Qur&#x27;an, Job () is considered a prophet in Islam. The narrative frame of Job&#x27;s story in Islam is similar to the Hebrew Bible story but, in Islam, the emphasis is paid to Job remaining steadfast to God and there is no record of his despair, or mention of discussions with friends. Some Muslim commentators also spoke of Job as being the ancestor of the Romans. 
Muslim literature also comments on Job&#x27;s time and place of prophecy, saying that he came after Joseph in the prophetic series and that he preached to his own people rather than being sent to a specified community. Tradition further recounts that Job will be the leader of the group of &quot;those who patiently endured&quot; in Heaven.

==Local traditions regarding Job==

There are at least two locations that claim to be the place of Job&#x27;s ordeal, and at least three that claim to have his tomb.

The Eyüp Sultan Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey, holds the tomb of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, a companion of Muhammad, not the biblical/Qur&#x27;anic Job (Ayyub in Arabic, Eyüp in Turkish), though some locals tend to conflate the two.

===Israel/Palestine===
In Palestinian folk tradition, Job&#x27;s place of trial is Al-Jura, or Al-Joura, a village outside the town of Al-Majdal (today&#x27;s Ashkelon, Israel). It was there God rewarded him with a fountain of youth that removed whatever illnesses he had, and gave him back his youth.

To the northwest of the depopulated Palestinian village of Dayr Ayyub is an area which, according to the village belief, contained the tomb of the prophet Ayyub, the biblical Job.

In the area of Tabgha (Greek: Heptapegon), on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, a few sites are associated by local tradition with the life of Ayyub. A small grotto near the base of what is known to Christians as the Mount of Beatitudes, or Mount Eremos, is known as Mghraret Ayub (&quot;Job&#x27;s Cave&quot;). Two of the towers built in the Byzantine period to collect the water of the Heptapegon springs are named in Arabic Tannur Ayub (&quot;Job&#x27;s Kiln&quot;) and Hammam Ayyub (&quot;Job&#x27;s Bath&quot;). Hammam Ayyub was initially called &quot;the Leper&#x27;s Bath&quot;, but the leper was later identified with Job; the nearby spring, now a waterfall, is known as Ain Ayub, &quot;Job&#x27;s Spring&quot;.

===Hauran, Syria===
The town of al-Shaykh Saad in the Hauran region in Syria has been associated with Job since at least the 4th-century AD. Karnein was mentioned in Eusebius&#x27; Onomasticon as a town of Bashan that was said to be the location of the house of Job. Egeria the pilgrim relates that a church was built over the place in March or February 384 AD, and that the place was known as the &quot;town of Job&quot;, or &quot;civitas Job&quot;. According to Egeria&#x27;s account the body of Job was laid in a stone coffin below the altar. According to tradition, &quot;Hammam Ayyub&quot; is a fountain in the town where Job washed himself when he was sick, and is reputed to have healing powers. Another holy artifact in the town is the &quot;Rock of Job&quot;, known in local folklore as the place where he sat when he was afflicted with the disease.

===Urfa, Turkey===
The city of Urfa (ancient Adma&#x27;, later Edessa) in the Şanlıurfa Province, or Harran region of southeastern Turkey, also claims to be the location at which Job underwent his ordeal in a cave. The location boasts an Ottoman-style mosque and madrasa that runs as shops today. A well exists within the complex, said to be the one formed when he struck the ground with his foot as described in the Quran. The water is considered to be miraculously curing. The whole complex underwent recent restoration. The tomb of Job is located outside the city of Urfa.

===Oman===
The Tomb of Job is also said to be situated in Jabal Qarah outside the city of Salalah in southern Oman.

===El-Chouf mountains, Lebanon===
Additionally, the Druze community also maintains a shrine for the Prophet Job in Niha village in the Chouf mountains of Lebanon. This shrine is said to be the place where Job was healed from his ailments after his wife carried his frail body up the steep mountain in a basket so he dies up there. Instead, he was healed and given an even larger wealth.

=== Ayodhya, India ===
In a 16th-century Mughal document, &quot;Ain-i-Akbari&quot;, there is mention of a tomb, in Ayodhya, commonly believed to be the resting place of the Prophet Job. The tomb of the Prophet Job in Ayodhya is also mentioned in the work &quot;India of Aurangzeb&quot; of Jadunath Sarkar.

<doc id="853434" wikidata="Q1803395" url="?curid=853434" title="School of Fish">
<text>School of Fish was an alternative rock band which formed in 1989 and disbanded in 1994. The core members were Josh Clayton-Felt (lead vocals and guitar) and Michael Ward (guitar). School of Fish released two albums and are remembered for the hit single &quot;3 Strange Days&quot; (1991).

==History==
Clayton-Felt and Ward started as a duo who would play club dates in Los Angeles, California, accompanied by programmed drums and bass.

Recruiting drummer Michael Petrak and bassist David Lipson the band signed with Capitol Records in 1990, and released their first single in that same year on 7-inch vinyl. Their self-titled debut was released in March 1991, followed by their first single, &quot;3 Strange Days.&quot; Also during the same year, they appeared on a KROQ-FM concert disc called the Acoustic Christmas. 

After the release of the first album, the rhythm section changed from Michael Petrak and Dominic Nardini to Chad Fischer and Chris MacDonald respectively. However the new members did not play on the band&#x27;s second album, which featured session musicians Josh Freese and John Pierce. Nevertheless, Chad Fischer stayed with the band to play live.

School of Fish&#x27;s second album, &quot;Human Cannonball&quot;, was released in 1993. The album did not sell well and was not as successful as the self-titled album. Shortly thereafter, the band broke up.

==Aftermath==
===Members’ careers===
Singer Josh Clayton-Felt embarked on a solo career and released two studio albums and one live album before he was diagnosed with cancer in 1999. He died on January 19, 2000, at the age of 32. His estate has since overseen three posthumous releases.

Guitarist Michael Ward went on to play with John Hiatt and eventually became a member of The Wallflowers. After The Wallflowers split, Ward spent many years as a member of Ben Harper&#x27;s band, The Innocent Criminals. He was also a sought-after session guitarist in LA, and the author of the children&#x27;s books &#x27;Mike and the Bike&#x27; and &#x27;Mike and the Bike Meet Lucille The Wheel.&#x27; Ward died on April 1, 2024.

Chad Fischer went on to form the band Lazlo Bane, known for original theme song of the TV show &quot;Scrubs&quot;. He also established himself as a record producer and composer.

Christopher MacDonald, who played bass with the band on tour, but did not play on any School of Fish recordings, records synthesizer space music under the name Telomere.

===Releases===
Two previously unreleased songs were released as downloads circa 2007. &quot;Broken Arm&quot; (recorded before the &quot;Human Cannonball&quot; sessions) and &quot;Goodbye Green World&quot; (recorded before the self-titled album sessions).

The idea of releasing a rarities compilation was in talks with surviving past members but was aborted completely.

Two songs, &quot;Goodbye Green World&quot; and &quot;Who Am I Today&quot;, performed by Josh-Clayton Felt and Michael Ward were issued on Josh&#x27;s third posthumous release, the EP &quot;The Spirit Shines Through&quot;.

In 2020 Chad Fischer reunited with the original members of School of Fish to record a new version of the song &quot;3 Strange Days&quot; which was released as a video. The track was later included on the Lazlo Bane album &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Be Together&quot;.

<text>The American Bantam Car Company was an American automobile manufacturing company incorporated in the state of Pennsylvania. American Bantam is credited with inventing the original World War II ton jeep in 1940. The company&#x27;s founders, Roy Evans and William A. Ward Jr., combined resources to purchase the assets of the bankrupt American Austin Car Company in August of 1935 during liquidation.

In 1935 the new company produced vehicles based on the American Austin tooling, operating as Evans Operations Inc. The new company was incorporated as American Bantam Car Company in June 1936. The new company launched a public fundraising campaign and redesigned their entire vehicle line to launch a completely refreshed selection of American Bantam roadsters and delivery vans in 1937. The company continued to make vehicles into 1943, until all of its production – like all the U.S. automotive industry – served the World War II efforts, with vehicles and weapons manufacturing, including (amphibious) cargo trailers, aircraft controls and other parts, and engines and tail gearing for torpedoes.

==History==

On June 2, 1936, Roy Evans and his co-founders incorporated American Bantam Car Company in Pennsylvania and transferred the assets purchased from the American Austin Car Company, along with $500 in cash to the new company. In early 1937, Evans phoned Count Alexis de Sakhnoffsky, the original Austin body designer, and asked him to design a new line of bodies improvised around the existing tooling. No funds were available for a costly styling program, much less to engineer new body dies, so the new design had to use as much of the original tooling as possible. 

In early 1937 Alexis de Sakhnoffsky visited the American Bantam factory in Butler, Pennsylvania, and designed a completely new front grille, new front fenders and new rear fenders. The Austin engine was also redesigned with a new aluminum induction system and cylinder head, retaining the 45.6 cubic inch (747 cc) displacement, but while adopting a fully pressurized oil system, increasing the compression ratio by 40% to a 7:1 ratio and implementing plain babbitt crankshaft bearings to produce 20 horsepower at 4,000 rpm, a 50% improvement over the Austin engine. American Bantam&#x27;s 1938 model was the inspiration for Donald Duck&#x27;s car which was first seen in &quot;Don Donald&quot; (1937). Despite a wide range of Bantam body styles, ranging from light trucks to woodie station wagons, only about 6,000 Bantams of all types were produced. American Bantam continued to build cars until August 18, 1943. 
==Invention of the Original Jeep ==

American Bantam is credited with the invention of the original jeep and the first serial production military jeeps ordered by the U.S. Army in 1940.

The idea of a small, durable automobile to replace the horse was championed by American Bantam salesman Navy Commander Charles &#x27;Harry&#x27; Payne (retired), working closely with Robert Brown, a civilian consultant working for the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps (QMC), American Bantam chief engineer Harold Crist and American Bantam president Frank Fenn, who together during the spring of 1940 laid out the specifications for the first Bantam Reconnaissance Car. Harold Crist did the lion&#x27;s share of specifying, conceiving, designing and building the car with Karl Probst drafting and formalizing pre-existing layout and specifications set out by Crist. 

American Bantam delivered the first jeep to the QMC on September 23, 1940, at Camp Holabird, a U.S. Army base to the east of Baltimore, Maryland. Engineers from Ford and Willys-Overland were on-hand at Camp Holabird during testing to learn more about the new vehicle. The original jeep designs were handed over to Willys-Overland and Ford and became the basis for the design of the World War II jeep. After the delivery of the first jeep, American Bantam kicked off serial production of the Mark II (also called the BRC-60) jeeps with improvements suggested by the QMC. American Bantam was the sole manufacturer of jeeps put into service by the U.S. Army during 1940. 

The word &quot;Jeep&quot; was first used to describe US Army &quot;midget cars&quot; in a January 1941 newspaper article, mentioning &quot;Bantam&quot; as the manufacturer. At the time American Bantam was the only manufacturer that had actually fulfilled purchase orders to deliver Jeeps to the US Army. Rumors say &quot;Jeep&quot; is a phonetic pronunciation of the abbreviation GP. However, GP was a Ford internal production designation, and Ford did not start delivering Jeeps to the US Army until April 1941, after news of &quot;Jeeps&quot; made by &quot;Bantam&quot; had already been widely reported in newspapers nationwide. As the US Army had not yet decided which manufacturer to choose, Ford may have chosen the letters GP to associate the Ford with the Jeep vehicle already made popular by American Bantam.

All together American Bantam built 2,675 jeeps from 1940 through 1943, with the bulk of those vehicles being delivered during 1941. More than half of the initial production went to the British Army, and some to the Soviet Union. Some of the motors and chassis were imported from Toledo, Ohio; the original bodies were made at the American Bantam factory in Butler, Pennsylvania.

The Bantam company produced the most fuel-efficient engine and first prototype under the original U.S. Army tender specifications and was awarded the first contract. However, because elements favorable to Ford within the Quartermaster Corps claimed that Bantam lacked production capacity to produce the vehicle on the scale needed by the Army, the awarding of ongoing contracts was reopened. Eventually the Army gave the BRC (Bantam Reconnaissance Car) 40 designs to Willys-Overland and awarded the bulk of orders to Willys and Ford, while Bantam went on to produce jeep trailers (T-3).

After World War II American Bantam continued to make trailers for the consumer market. In 1943 American Bantam launched an Advertising campaign boasting that &quot;Ivan got his first Jeep from Bantam&quot; in response to an application by Willys-Overland to the United States Patent and Trademark Office to trademark &quot;JEEP&quot; filed on February 13, 1943.

Trailer production continued until the company was taken over by American Rolling Mills in 1956.

<text>NRBQ is an American rock band founded by Terry Adams (piano), Steve Ferguson (guitar) and Joey Spampinato (bass). Originally the &quot;New Rhythm and Blues Quintet&quot;, the group was formed circa 1965. Adams disbanded it for a time, and the group re-formed in 1967. The quartet is known for its live performances, containing a high degree of spontaneity and levity, and blending rock, pop, jazz, blues and Tin Pan Alley styles. 

From 1974 to 1994, the band included pianist Adams, bassist Spampinato, guitarist Al Anderson, and drummer Tom Ardolino. This is considered the classic lineup of the group. Its current membership includes Adams, bassist Casey McDonough, guitarist Scott Ligon, and drummer John Perrin. Other members in the band&#x27;s long history include guitarists Kenny Sheehan and Johnny Spampinato; drummers Tom Staley, Conrad Choucroun, Bobby Lloyd Hicks and Joe Camarillo; and vocalist Frank Gadler.

==History==
NRBQ began in late 1965 as a rehearsal band in the Shively, Kentucky, home of brothers Terry and Donn Adams, and they appeared on stage for the first time in 1966. Along with drummer Charlie Craig, they made home tapes of their experiments. The first known reference to the band&#x27;s name can be heard on one of these home tapes, with Donn announcing, &quot;Here they are, the New Rhythm and Blues Quintet!&quot; as though presenting them to a live audience.

In late spring of 1966, guitarist Steve Ferguson was invited to join NRBQ after he quit Mersey Beats USA (no relation to the Liverpool group who recorded &quot;I Stand Accused&quot;). He met Adams when the latter briefly joined the Mersey Beats USA to fill in for the regular keyboard player. After playing a few live dates in Louisville, Jimmy Orten (Soul Inc) was recruited on bass and vocals and the band left for Florida in late 1966.

In Miami, early January 1967, NRBQ played six nights at The Cheetah. Soon after, Orten and Ferguson returned to Louisville. Adams stayed behind and joined The Seven of Us, a band that was playing the same club. By August, the NRBQ was Adams (keyboards), Ferguson (guitar), Spampinato (bass) and Frank Gadler (vocals) from The Seven of Us, and Tom Staley (drums).

In December 1968, they began recording with Eddie Kramer at the Record Plant and by early 1969 were signed to a two-record deal with Columbia Records. Their self-titled debut album was released that year, with songs by both Eddie Cochran and Sun Ra, and a number of similarly wide-ranging originals. The following year, the group collaborated with rockabilly legend Carl Perkins on an album titled &quot;Boppin&#x27; the Blues&quot;.

Over the next three years, the band experienced personnel shifts, with the departure of Ferguson (replaced for one year by Ken Sheehan), Gadler, and Staley, and the arrival of two new members: guitarist/singer Al Anderson formerly of The Wildweeds, known for the Connecticut and Massachusetts regional hit &quot;No Good To Cry&quot;, and drummer Tom Ardolino. The Adams / Spampinato / Anderson / Ardolino quartet stayed together longer than any other incarnation of the band (20 years, from 1974 until 1994), and was often augmented by the Whole Wheat Horns (Donn Adams, Keith Spring and others).
Starting in September 1989, NRBQ opened for R.E.M. on the &quot;Acronym Tour&quot; with the first concert taking place on the 27th at the University of Dayton Arena. The last stop on the tour was at the Shoreline Amphitheater at Mountain View in Mountain View, California on October 21. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s Sam Freedman noted that the NRBQ played a compressed 30-minute club show. He also reported that both Mike Mills and Peter Buck of R.E.M. watched each of the NRBQ&#x27;s opening sets during their portion of the tour from the edge of the stage &quot;as if to endorse NRBQ for their fans&quot;.

In 1994 Anderson departed the group. He would become an award-winning Nashville songwriter for many country and western acts. He was replaced in NRBQ by Joey Spampinato&#x27;s younger brother, Johnny Spampinato, who was (and still is) a member of power-pop band The Incredible Casuals.

On April 30 and May 1, 2004, the group celebrated its 35th anniversary with concerts at the Calvin Theater in Northampton, Massachusetts. The shows featured every former and current member of the band, as Ferguson, Gadler, Staley, Sheehan and Anderson returned for an NRBQ reunion.

==Hiatus and return==

After the Halloween engagement at Shank Hall in Milwaukee in 2004, NRBQ went on hiatus. Adams had developed stage 4 throat cancer. During this time, Ardolino and the Spampinato brothers started playing shows as a trio, under the name &quot;Baby Macaroni&quot; and as the &quot;Spampinato Bros.&quot;. After a number of months, Adams recovered and toured with former drummer Staley and Japanese rockabilly group the Hot Shots.

In June 2006, Adams and Ferguson released the album &quot;Louisville Sluggers&quot; (with Ardolino on drums, Pete Toigo on bass and other supporting musicians), and this album&#x27;s lineup performed live shows in the U.S. and Japan as &quot;The Terry Adams – Steve Ferguson Quartet&quot; and &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Summit Meeting.&quot;

Also in September 2006 came the release of a SpongeBob SquarePants album, &quot;The Best Day Ever&quot;, which included backing music by all four NRBQ members, as well as Anderson. The album, a collection of &#x27;60s-influenced pop/rock produced by Andy Paley, and co-written by Paley and the voice of SpongeBob, Tom Kenny, also included such musical luminaries as Brian Wilson, Tommy Ramone, James Burton, Flaco Jiménez and Philadelphia DJ Jerry &quot;The Geator&quot; Blavat.

In November 2007, Adams formed &quot;The Terry Adams Rock &amp; Roll Quartet&quot; with Scott Ligon on guitar and vocals, Pete Donnelly (of The Figgs) on bass and Conrad Choucroun and Ardolino on drums.

In March 2011, Adams posted an open letter to fans announcing that with the release of the upcoming album, &quot;Keep This Love Goin&quot;&#x27;, this lineup would take on the NRBQ name. He also explained that while he did have tendinitis, the real reason for the hiatus was his treatment for cancer. In May 2012, the group released a live album, &quot;We Travel the Spaceways&quot;, on Clang! records.

During September 2012, bassist Donnelly was replaced by Scott Ligon&#x27;s friend Casey McDonough. (As of 2021, Ligon and McDonough have also been members of the Flat Five, based in Chicago.)

In July 2013, NRBQ toured with drummer Joe Camarillo of The Waco Brothers and Hushdrops, where he recorded two songs on the &quot;Brass Tacks&quot; album: &quot;Greetings from Delaware&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Not Here&quot;. Bobby Lloyd Hicks became the drummer from 2013 to 2015. He played on &quot;Love In Outer Space&quot; and &quot;Let Go&quot; from the 5-CD box set &quot;High Noon&quot;. John Perrin became the drummer in 2015.

Steve Ferguson died of cancer on October 7, 2009.

Tom Ardolino died on January 6, 2012, following a long illness.

Bobby Lloyd Hicks died of bronchiectasis on February 20, 2017.

Joe Camarillo died on January 24, 2021, of a stroke after contracting COVID-19.

==Reunion shows==
On April 27 and 28 of 2007, NRBQ gave a pair of &quot;38th Anniversary&quot; performances in Northampton, Massachusetts, the first public NRBQ shows since 2004. Both Anderson and Johnny Spampinato appeared in the line-up, along with &quot;Whole Wheat Horns&quot; Donn Adams and Jim Bob Hoke, and guest appearances by John Sebastian, original NRBQ drummer Staley, and the band&#x27;s former road manager Klem Klimek on saxophone. Gadler, former lead vocalist, also appeared.

==Style and influence==
The band&#x27;s music is a blend of styles from rockabilly to Beatles-influenced pop to Thelonious Monk-inspired jazz. They have attracted fans as diverse as Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, Elvis Costello, Keith Richards, The Replacements, John Sebastian, Dave Edmunds, Yo La Tengo and Penn &amp; Teller. NRBQ songs have been performed by Bonnie Raitt, Los Lobos, and Dave Edmunds among others. Also, the group served as the unofficial &quot;house band&quot; for &quot;The Simpsons&quot; for the season 10–12 period in which NRBQ fan Mike Scully was head writer and executive producer. NRBQ allowed several of their songs to be used on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, including &quot;Mayonnaise and Marmalade&quot;, written specifically for the show. The band also appeared in animated form and on camera during the end credits to perform the show&#x27;s theme song during the episode &quot;Take My Wife, Sleaze&quot; and to perform Edmunds&#x27;s cover of &quot;Me &amp; The Boys&quot;. The band also recorded a song entitled &quot;Birdman&quot; for an episode of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; entitled &quot;Pilot&quot;. The group appeared in feature films, including &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;, &quot;Shakes the Clown&quot;, and &quot;28 Days&quot;. Their cover version of &quot;Down in My Heart&quot; appeared in the series finale of &quot;Wilfred&quot;.

NRBQ has a large following from decades of live shows. The band always performs without a set list which makes them, in the words of AllMusic&#x27;s Mark Deming, &quot;a stellar and wildly unpredictable live act.&quot; In addition to its own compositions, the band performs a broad range of cover material and audience requests.

In their nearly 50-year history, NRBQ&#x27;s records have been released by many record companies, including Columbia Records, Kama Sutra Records, Mercury Records, Virgin Records, Rhino Entertainment, Rounder Records, and more. Their song &quot;Get That Gasoline Blues&quot; (on Kama Sutra) reached No. 70 in 1974 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. Over the years, the group played sets while wearing pajamas, hired professional wrestling manager &quot;Captain&quot; Lou Albano as the band&#x27;s manager (for whom they penned a song in tribute), and exploded Cabbage Patch Dolls on stage.

&quot;To Her Door&quot; won an ARIA Award in 1988 for &#x27;Best Video&#x27; directed by Claudia Castle. In 2001, the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) listed the Top 30 Australian songs of all time, including &quot;To Her Door,&quot; written by Kelly.

==Background==
After relocating from Melbourne to Sydney in 1985, Paul Kelly began to play and record with a full-time band, which included Michael Armiger on bass guitar, Michael Barclay on drums, Steve Connolly on guitar, eventually bassist Jon Schofield, and keyboardist Peter Bull joined. Through a joke based on Lou Reed&#x27;s song &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;, the band became known as Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls. In September 1986 the band released their debut double LP &quot;Gossip&quot;. Due to possible racist connotations the band changed its name, for international releases, to Paul Kelly and the Messengers. They made an American tour, initially supporting Crowded House and then head-lining, travelling across the United States by bus. Jon Schofield replaced Armiger on bass guitar, Chris Coyne on tenor saxophone and Chris Wilson on harmonica

On the Australian albums charts, it peaked at #19 with the single &quot;To Her Door&quot; peaking at #14. First single from the album, &quot;Bradman,&quot; had been released in January 1987 as a double-A side with &quot;Leaps and Bounds&quot; from &quot;Gossip&quot; but had little chart success. The third and fourth singles, &quot;Forty Miles to Saturday Night&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Stand So Close to the Window&quot; also had little chart success. Another single, &quot;Dumb Things,&quot; peaked at #36 in early 1989 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) singles charts; it reached #16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock chart. The song was included in the soundtrack for the 1988 Yahoo Serious film &quot;Young Einstein&quot;.

In 1988, &quot;To Her Door&quot; won an ARIA Award for &#x27;Best Video&#x27; directed by Claudia Castle. In 2001, the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) listed the Top 30 Australian songs of all time, including &quot;To Her Door,&quot; written by Kelly.

&quot;Desdemona&quot; was featured in an episode of the Australian TV show &quot;Packed To The Rafters&quot;.

<doc id="853446" wikidata="Q984084" url="?curid=853446" title="Sussex, New Brunswick">
<text>Sussex is a town in Kings County, New Brunswick, Canada. 
Sussex is located in south central New Brunswick, between the province&#x27;s three largest cities, Saint John, Moncton, and Fredericton.

Sussex straddles the Kennebecasis River, northeast of Saint John, and is a major dairy product producer in the province. It is home to Atlantic Canada&#x27;s largest hot air balloon festival.

On 1 January 2023, Sussex amalgamated with the village of Sussex Corner and part of the local service district of the parish of Sussex. Revised census figures have not been released, although combining the 2016 census numbers the total population would be approximately 5,900.

==History==

In 1857, the European and North American Railway was opened, connecting the farming communities of the Kennebecasis River valley with Saint John and Moncton. Sussex was incorporated in accordance with Chapter 44 of the Town Incorporation Act of 1896 and was officially established as a Town on June 2, 1904. Prior to its incorporation, the area was known as Sussex Vale from 1810 – 1898 and was a farming community of 185 people. This grew to include the surrounding area of Lower Sussex.

The settlers were for the most part British Loyalists who had fled the American Revolution in 1776, with many Irish refugees of the Great Famine from the mid-19th century settling in the nearby farming communities.

In 1885, the Sussex Military Camp was established on the eastern edge of the town. The facility was closed following the Second World War and the town purchased the land to expand the municipal boundaries. Today the agricultural exhibition and some areas remain as open land on the former site of Camp Sussex. 

Sussex underwent several changes in the post-war period. In the early 1960s, several local roads were upgraded as part of the Trans-Canada Highway project which saw Route 2 pass immediately north of the town between Fredericton and Moncton. At the same time, a series of local roads in the Kennebecasis River valley were designated as Route 1, running from an interchange with the Trans-Canada at Sussex, southwest to Saint John.

The creation of Sussex as a highway interchange in this post-war period led to some transportation planners in New Brunswick calling for the consolidation or closure of the Fredericton, Saint John and Moncton airports to be replaced by a single airport located in Sussex to serve all three population centres of southern New Brunswick; this was before the facilities underwent considerable expansion in the late 1950s to early 1960s. 

Potash was subsequently discovered in large quantities in the area surrounding Sussex, with the deposit being the second largest in the world after an area in Saskatchewan. Three mines were built near the town, two at Penobsquis, to the east, and another at Cassidy Lake (no longer operational), to the southwest. CN Rail built track to serve both mines, which employed hundreds from the surrounding area. Since 2003, natural gas has been produced from the McCully field near Sussex. Price decreases of the potash market combined with underground structural issues caused the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan to close its Picadilly mining operation in January 2016, and then its Penobsquis mine in November 2018.


Sussex also began to see a growing tourism trade, with many flocking to see the collection of wood-constructed covered bridges throughout the central area of Kings County. 

Today, Sussex is primarily a regional service centre for the surrounding agricultural communities of the upper Kennebecasis River valley, as well as a highway service centre on Route 1, the primary highway between Moncton and Saint John, as well as being the most heavily travelled route in the Maritimes to the United States. 
Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II visited the town as part of her Golden Jubilee tour of Canada. On October 12, 2002, she attended the opening of a new wing of Sussex Elementary School, unveiling a commemorative plaque at the event. She then visited Princess Louise Park for an agricultural exhibition. While there, it was announced that the community hall would be renamed Jubilee Hall in her honour. Both appearances drew thousands of visitors from Sussex and beyond.

=== Amalgamation ===
On January 1, 2023, Sussex and the village of Sussex Corner were amalgamated. The village of Sussex Corner was incorporated into the Town of Sussex.

== Economy ==
The town is home to Sussex Golden Ginger Ale, a Maritime beverage. 

The town entered economic difficulty during the late 1990s after the Cassidy Lake potash mine flooded, resulting in hundreds of lay-offs. Another significant blow came in October 2002 with a realignment of the Trans-Canada Highway (Route 2) between Fredericton and Moncton which no longer passed through Sussex, instead carrying the province&#x27;s east–west interprovincial traffic 30 km (19 mi) north of the town. At the same time, Route 1 was extended east on the old Trans-Canada alignment to an interchange at River Glade near Three Rivers and Route 10 was extended on the old Trans-Canada from an interchange with the new Route 2 alignment at Young&#x27;s Cove Road south to Sussex.

In 2022, there were rumours that the regional potash mines might reopen, due to a substantial rise in the market price of the commodity; however, Nutrien declined to do so.

=== Media ===
Kings County Record has been in existence since 1887. It is a weekly paper which serves Sussex and the surrounding areas. The paper is published on Tuesdays. 

The town plays host to a handful of radio stations: 
*CJCW AM 590, local radio station

*CBC Radio One 106.7 FM

It doubles as a storage facility for RVs and trailers during the winter months. The centre has five barns with stalls, three riding rings, and electrical and sewage hookups.

==== Agricultural Museum of New Brunswick ====
Sussex has been home to the Agricultural Museum of New Brunswick since 1983. The museum was opened by community members and it is now maintained by a board of volunteers. The land that the museum is situated on once belonged to the 8th Hussars. The museum is closed every year from October to May.

<text>Ferny Grove railway station is the terminus station of the Ferny Grove line in Queensland, Australia. It serves the Brisbane suburb of Ferny Grove.

The Brisbane Tramway Museum is a short walk south of the station.

==History==
The station opened in 1918 as part of the extension to Samford.

The line formerly extended to Dayboro, but was cut back to Ferny Grove in 1955, as part of a larger rationalisation by the Queensland Government of its railway lines. The line now terminates here with bus services running to Samford during peak times.

The station was upgraded in 2012 as part of the Keperra-Ferny Grove duplication project. The upgrade included relocating the platform, a new station building and car park.

==Camp Mountain rail accident==
The Camp Mountain rail accident occurred in 1947 west of Ferny Grove on the Dayboro stretch of the line. It is Queensland&#x27;s worst railway accident. 16 people were killed when a picnic excursion train failed to negotiate a bend on the line between Camp Mountain and Samford. A small memorial marks the site of the accident.

==Services==
Ferny Grove is the terminus for all stops services to and from Roma Street, Park Road, Coopers Plains and Beenleigh.

==Services by platform==


==Ferny Grove Central Development ==
Honeycombes Property Group are developing the station to be Transit Oriented Development (TOD). Ferny Grove Staition is currently being redeveloped to improve parking, retail, add apartments and a public plaza directly outside of the station.

As of November 2023, the commuter car park has been completed with stage 2 construction underway, and expected to be opened in 2025.

<text>The American Chocolate, later known as the Walter, was an American automobile manufactured from 1902 to 1906 by vending machine company American Chocolate Machinery Co. in Manhattan, New York. He decided to expand his business by assembling automobiles in his factory. The cars were exhibited at the New York automobile show.

The cars were built from imported components, and were 30, 40, and 50 hp models. Production was supervised by Swiss engineer William Walter, who began building cars in 1898. The company relocated to Trenton, New Jersey in 1906, where it began producing cars under the name Walter.

After 1910 Walter was building 4 X 4 trucks, which were used by the military and municipalities. Just after World War I, Walter sub-contracted some production of its trucks to the Milwaukee Locomotive Manufacturing Company. After that, Walter switched from the brand&#x27;s own four-cylinder motor to the Waukesha engine, and the company moved to a new location on Long Island in 1923. The company would be finally absorbed by Kovatch Mobile Equipment Corp (KME) in the late 1970s.

Snow has been a contributor for &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; and &quot;Glammonitor&quot;, writing articles about the porn industry and women&#x27;s issues.

On March 6, 2014, Snow spoke at Harvard Law School on the topic of &quot;Sex, Drugs, and Rolling Dice: The Regulation of Vice.&quot; On March 19, 2015, Snow spoke at the University of South Carolina School of Law on &quot;Vice, Porn and American Culture.&quot;

The letter quickly went viral on the Internet. She gave birth to her son in December 2013. Her father stated that he was proud upon finding out about her occupation.

<text>Silas Weir Mitchell (February 15, 1829 – January 4, 1914) was an American physician, scientist, novelist, and poet. He is considered the father of medical neurology, and he discovered causalgia (complex regional pain syndrome) and erythromelalgia, and pioneered the rest cure.

==Early life==
Silas Weir Mitchell was born on February 15, 1829, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to prominent physician and writer John Kearsley Mitchell (1792–1858) and Sarah Henry Mitchell (1800–1872) . His father was a doctor and pathologist interested in snake venom, and Mitchell would continue his research later on.

Dr. Mitchell studied at the University of Pennsylvania and later earned the degree of MD at the city&#x27;s Jefferson Medical College in 1850. 

==Career==
During the Civil War, he was director of treatment of nervous injuries and maladies at Turner&#x27;s Lane Hospital, Philadelphia, and at the close of the war became a specialist in neurology. In this field Mitchell pioneered the rest cure for diseases now termed &quot;psychiatric&quot;, particularly neurasthenia and hysteria, subsequently taken up by the medical world. The treatment consisted primarily in isolation, confinement to bed, dieting, electrotherapy and massage; and was popularly known as &#x27;Dr Diet and Dr Quiet&#x27;. Mitchell advocated a high-fat diet to his patients. He believed that a diet rich in fat would &quot;fatten and redden&quot; his patients, leading to a cure. To achieve this, large quantities of milk were prescribed. He requested his patients to consume two quarts or more milk a day.

His medical texts include &quot;Injuries of Nerves and Their Consequences&quot; (1872) and &quot;Fat and Blood&quot; (1877). Mitchell&#x27;s disease (erythromelalgia) is named after him. He also coined the term phantom limb during his study of an amputee. Mitchell discovered and treated causalgia (today known as CRPS/RSD), a condition most often encountered by hand surgeons. Mitchell is considered the father of medical neurology and a pioneer of &quot;evidence-based&quot; or &quot;scientific&quot; medicine. He was a founding member of the American Anthropometric Society whose purpose was to collect the brains of eminent scientists to further brain science. He was also a psychiatrist, toxicologist, author, poet, and celebrity in Europe as well as America. His contemporaries considered him a genius no less than Benjamin Franklin.

In 1866, he published a short story in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; resting upon both somatic and psychological insights entitled &quot;The Case of George Dedlow&quot;. From that point onward, Mitchell divided his attention between scientific and literary pursuits. In the former field, he produced monographs on rattlesnake venom, intellectual hygiene, injuries to the nerves, neurasthenia, nervous diseases of women, the effects of gunshot wounds upon the nervous system, and relations between nurse, physician, and patient; in the latter, he wrote juvenile stories, several volumes of respectable verse (&quot;The Hill of Stones and Other Poems&quot; was published in 1883 by Houghton, Mifflin and Co.), and prose fiction of varying merit, which earned him a leading place among American authors at the close of the 19th century. His historical novels in particular, notably &quot;Hugh Wynne&quot; (1897), &quot;The Adventures of François&quot; (1898), &quot;The Youth of Washington&quot; (1904), and &quot;The Red City&quot; (1909), are among the best of their genre.

He would become a professor at University of Pennsylvania. In addition to that, Mitchell was president of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia. He would mentor Hideyo Noguchi, helping him get his start in Philadelphia, and co-author papers together on snake venom and toxicity for the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s medical journal.

===Prominent patients===
Although Silas Weir Mitchell was considered the most prominent doctor of the time, his female patients often suffered under his care. There was even a death due to his treatment that was not revealed to the public.

He was Charlotte Perkins Gilman&#x27;s doctor and his use of a rest cure on her provided the idea for &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot;, a short story in which the narrator is driven insane by this treatment.

His treatment was also used on Virginia Woolf, who wrote a savage satire of it in her novel &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; (1925): &quot;you invoke proportion; order rest in bed; rest in solitude; silence and rest; rest without friends, without books, without messages; six months rest; until a man who went in weighing seven stone six comes out weighing twelve&quot;.

===Influence on Freud===
Sigmund Freud reviewed Mitchell&#x27;s book on &quot;The Treatment of Certain Forms of Neurasthenia and Hysteria&quot; in 1887; and used electrotherapy in his work into the 1890s.

Freud also adopted Mitchell&#x27;s use of physical relaxation as an adjunct to therapy, which arguably led to the institutionalization of the psychoanalytic couch.

===Honors and recognition===
Mitchell&#x27;s eminence in science and letters was recognized by honorary degrees conferred upon him by several universities at home and abroad and by membership, honorary or active, in many American and foreign learned societies. In 1887 he was president of the Association of American Physicians and in 1908–09 president of the American Neurological Association.

He was a trustee of the Carnegie Institution from 1902 until he died in 1914. In 1912 he was honored by the Guggenheim Honor Cup of the Penn Club of New York.

The American Academy of Neurology award for young researchers, the S. Weir Mitchell Award, is named for him.

&quot;Crotalus mitchellii&quot;, the speckled rattlesnake, was named after Mitchell.

==Personal life==
Mitchell was twice married. His first marriage was to Mary Middleton Elwyn (1838–1862), a daughter of Dr. Alfred L. Elwyn of Philadelphia. Before her death, they were the parents of two children:

* John Kearsley Mitchell (1859–1917), a neurologist who married Anne Keppele Williams in 1890.
* Langdon Elwyn Mitchell (1862–1935), a playwright who married actress Marion Lea in 1891.

On June 23, 1875, Mitchell was married to Mary Cadwalader (1835–1914), who was from one of Philadelphia&#x27;s most prestigious families. She was a daughter of Thomas McCall Cadwalader and Maria Charlotte Gouverneur (niece of Elizabeth Kortright, who had married U.S. President James Monroe). The marriage &quot;propelled him to one of the city&#x27;s highest social circles and he became a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania the following year.&quot; Together, they were the parents of a daughter:

* Marie Gouverneur Cadwalader Mitchell (1876–1898), who died unmarried.

Mitchell died on January 4, 1914, in Philadelphia and is interred at The Woodlands Cemetery. His widow died a week after his funeral.

===Cultural Club Founder ===
Mitchell and 8 other members of the University Club at Penn founded The Franklin Inn Club in 1902.

===Art patron===
He was a friend and patron of the artist Thomas Eakins, and owned the painting &quot;Whistling for Plover&quot;. The Philadelphia Chippendale chairs seen in several Eakins paintings – such as &quot;William Rush Carving his Allegorical Figure of Schuylkill River&quot; (1877) and the bas-relief &quot;Knitting&quot; (1883) – were borrowed from Mitchell. Following Eakins&#x27;s 1886 forced resignation from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Mitchell may have recommended the artist&#x27;s trip to the Badlands of South Dakota.

The artist John Singer Sargent painted two portraits of Mitchell: one is in the collection of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia; the other, commissioned by the Mutual Assurance Company of Philadelphia in 1902, was recently sold (see External Links, below).

The sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens modeled an 1884 bronze portrait plaque of Mitchell. Mitchell commissioned Saint-Gaudens to create a monument to his deceased daughter Maria: &quot;The Angel of Purity&quot;, a white marble version of the sculptor&#x27;s &quot;Amor Caritas&quot;. Originally installed in Saint Stephen&#x27;s Church, Philadelphia, it is now at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

===Ghost story===
Some time during the late 1800s, a ghost story was published about Dr. Mitchell that he was never able to lay to rest. The story tells how a very young girl in rags and threadbare shawl came to his door in bad weather and begged him to come take care of her sick mother. The girl guided Mitchell to the sick woman, who turned out to be a former house servant of his who was suffering from pneumonia. Mitchell helped the woman, then congratulated her on having such a fine daughter, but the woman told him her daughter died a month earlier. In a cupboard, Mitchell found the shawl the girl had been wearing; it had not been worn out that night.

A 2011 study determined that the ghost story was likely originally told by Mitchell himself as entertainment at a medical meeting, then took on a life of its own. In his 1910 book &quot;Characteristics,&quot; Mitchell wrote about a man who told a story &quot;about a little dead child who rang up a doctor one night, and took him to see her dying mother;&quot; the man was then constantly bothered by believers and disbelievers, and unable to stop the story. In context, it seems that Mitchell was referring to himself.

===&quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot;===
Charlotte Perkins Gilman would claim her short story &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot; was directed at Weir Mitchell that he might reconsider the rest cure or change his treatments. Although she has claimed to have sent a copy of the story, Weir Mitchell never acknowledged his connection to the infamous story or that he ever received a copy. Perkins Gilman also claimed that Weir Mitchell altered his Rest Cure treatment after reading &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper,&quot; but there is no evidence that Weir Mitchell ever changed or altered the Rest Cure.

<text>The American Electric was an American automobile manufactured in Chicago from 1899 to 1902 and Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1902. The company was incorporated by Clinton Edgar Woods in 1895 as American Electric Vehicle Co. Chicago, and merged with Indiana Bicycle Co. to become Waverly in 1898 and later Pope-Waverley.

The company built a wide range of electric carriages - some bodied as high, ungainly-looking dos-a-dos four-seaters - these were claimed to be capable of running from to . Perhaps optimistically, the manufacturer claimed that &quot;very few private carriages would ever be subjected to such a test&quot;. The company moved to New Jersey in 1902, according to a company statement, “to find more wealthy customers,” but they shutdown operations within the year.

<text>Sky News Australia is an Australian conservative news channel owned by News Corp Australia. Originally launched on 19 February 1996, it broadcasts rolling news coverage throughout the day, while its prime time lineup is dedicated to opinion-based programs featuring a line-up of conservative commentators.

Sky News Australia is distributed on pay television in Australia and New Zealand, while a free-to-air version of the service, Sky News Regional (which features programming from Sky News Australia and Fox Sports News) is distributed on digital terrestrial television by Southern Cross Austereo and selected WIN Television stations. The channel also operates two spin-off services, Sky News Weather Channel, and public affairs service Sky News Extra (formerly A-PAC).

The channel was originally a joint venture between British broadcaster BSkyB (thus making it a spin-off of the Sky News channel in the United Kingdom), Seven Media Group, and Nine Entertainment Co., as Australian News Channel Pty Ltd. The company was acquired by News Corp Australia in 2016. With the subsequent sale of Murdoch&#x27;s remaining shares in Sky UK to Comcast, Sky News Australia no longer has any direct ties to its UK counterpart, but continues to use the Sky News branding under license from Comcast. The channel is currently exploring options to rebrand into an Australian channel of the American Fox News brand once the current legacy branding agreement comes to an end in 2026.

Especially since the acquisition of the channel by News Corp Australia, Sky News Australia has faced scrutiny from the press over its increased focus on opinion programming. Comparisons were drawn to Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s American news channel Fox News, and there have been accusations that the channel&#x27;s opinion programming has promoted misinformation and conspiracy theories.

==History==

Sky News Channel&#x27;s parent company, Australian News Channel (ANC), was owned equally by British Sky Broadcasting (now Sky Limited; which is now a division of Comcast), Seven Media Group and Nine Entertainment Co., each with a 33% stake in the company from its founding until December 2016, when it was acquired by News Corp Australia.

Sky News Australia launched at 5 pm on 19 February 1996, as the first Australian-produced television news channel. The channel aired its 50,000th unique newscast on 23 April 2003 at 11 am. Sky News was added to Austar on 1 April 2000.

In 2004, Sky News began broadcasting Sky News Active, its on-demand interactive TV news service. In 2008, Sky News launched the Sky News Business Channel, and on 20 January 2009, Sky News launched Australian Public Affairs Channel (A-PAC). It began widescreen broadcasting on 17 May 2009. Sky News Australia began broadcasting in high definition on 1 December 2015. A fourth spin-off channel, Sky News Election Channel, was launched on 1 May 2016. 

In 2013, Sky News Australia was granted 20 million in funding from its parent company to be used over three years. 

In mid-2019, the channel began expanding its digital operations. This included a content partnership with YouTube, Microsoft News, Facebook and Taboola. That led to new, opinion-focused videos being uploaded more frequently and across News Corp platforms, after having previously not uploaded any videos from February 2017 to April 2019.

In February 2018, Sky News Australia launched a digital-first brand and content platform called 2600. The online political newsletter is sent out daily with breaking news from Canberra.

In November 2018, Sky News terminated the contract of former Liberal Party MP and late-night presenter Ross Cameron for using sinophobic language to describe Chinese people.

In July 2024, it was reported that the network would relocate to the News Corp Australia headquarters in Surry Hills in 2025. It was also reported that the network&#x27;s license to the Sky News brand was expected to expire as early as late-2025, and that Sky Limited was not expected to renew the agreement due to the change in ownership and the divergence in editorial direction between Sky News UK and Sky News Australia. It was reported that News Corp were considering rebranding the network as either &quot;Australian News Channel&quot; or a name containing &quot;Fox News&quot; (derived from U.S. sister network owned by Fox Corporation) or &quot;Talk&quot; (coming from News UK brand Talkradio, which operates a spin-off internet television service).

==Programming ==

Sky News programming consists of a mix of live news bulletins, live broadcasts from events (such as Parliament Question Time and selected press conferences), original commentary panel programs and simulcasts of international sister station Sky News UK. Sky News has broadcast every sitting of Question Time from the House of Representatives since its launch in 1996.

Sky News Australia increased its primetime programming offerings, particularly its political-themed shows, significantly in 2013, when it made more obvious its right-leaning ideology, ahead of the 2013 federal election, cancelling almost entirely the slot&#x27;s rolling news block &quot;News Night&quot;. It would then regain most of its runtime in 2014. Sky News Australia rebranded itself on 19 January 2015 as &quot;Sky News Live&quot;, dropping the &quot;Sky News National&quot; branding.

On weekdays, throughout most of the day, rolling news coverage is presented from one of Sky News Australia&#x27;s studios. From 5 pm (AEST/AEDT), commentary programs begin, and continue through primetime until 11 pm AEST/AEDT. Most of these programs are presented by conservative commentators discussing the news of the day, often with a panel of other commentators, and feature a news update at the beginning of the program (and sometimes further updates during the program). Rolling news continues from 11 pm AEST/AEDT before coverage switches to an overnight simulcast of Sky News UK at 1 am AEST/AEDT.

Beginning in 2007, Sky News aired local breakaway programming for New Zealand viewers in primetime, filmed at Prime NZ&#x27;s Auckland studios and produced from Sydney. One of these programs, &quot;Prime News – First at 5:30&quot;, was also simulcast to Australian viewers. The debut of &quot;Sky News NZ Evening News&quot; was watched by just 1,500 viewers and panned by critics. Sky News Australia continued to produce news programming for Prime until 2015, when MediaWorks New Zealand took over production of Prime&#x27;s news programming via its own news department. On 16 June 2018, Sky News Australia premiered &quot;New Zealand Agenda&quot;, a political program hosted by New Zealand bureau chief James O&#x27;Doherty from Wellington, New Zealand.

==Bureaus==

Sky News Australia has a bureau in every capital city in Australia, completing this with the opening of its Hobart studio in 2013. In 2016, it opened a bureau in Cairns, making it the first non-capital city bureau. In 2017, a Gold Coast bureau was opened marking the third non-capital city studio after Cairns and Geelong.

The base of Sky News Australia is in the Sydney suburb of Macquarie Park, from which the majority of its news and programming is broadcast. Its Melbourne studio was upgraded in 2014, allowing it to be used as a secondary broadcast studio. &quot;Hinch Live&quot; became the first regular program to be broadcast from Melbourne.

The third major bureau is in Parliament House, Canberra, opened in 2000. Lyndal Curtis became Bureau Chief of in October 2015. Additionally, Sky News has a small office in the Channel Seven building in Martin Place, which includes a small street-level single camera studio which looks onto Elizabeth Street, Sydney.

Internationally, Sky News&#x27;s only foreign bureau is in Wellington, New Zealand, opened in 2015.

== Resources ==
Apart from its own resources, at launch Sky News Australia used the news resources of its former parent companies &quot;Seven News&quot;, &quot;Nine News&quot; and Sky News UK, as well as sister networks Sky News UK and Fox News Channel. ABC America and CBS were founding international partners of Sky News Australia.

In 2010 it had agreements with CCTV China, ABC America, CBS, Reuters, APTN, Bloomberg, Dow Jones and Newshub, when it signed a four-year partnership deal with CNN International, commencing on 1 January 2011.

== Content ==
In 2017, Denis Muller, a senior research fellow at the University of Melbourne&#x27;s Centre for Advancing Journalism, described the channel as having a &quot;split personality,&quot; running straight news bulletins and reporting during the day with professional and independent journalists and presenters, while moving towards &quot;right-leaning punditry&quot; in prime time.

In February 2021, Muller, commenting on former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd&#x27;s statement that Sky News was following a pattern laid down by Fox News, described the nighttime programming of Sky News as including &quot;the unconstrained peddling of extreme right-wing propaganda, lies, disinformation, crude distortion of fact and baseless assertions.&quot;

=== Political alignment and views ===

Sky News Australia has an editorial policy that follows a conservative, right-wing bias. Coverage is frequently critical of Australia&#x27;s main progressive political parties, Labor and the Greens in addition to the Moderate Faction of Liberal Party, while being supportive of right-wing parties such as the Liberal-National Coalition (except for the Moderate Faction ) and One Nation. Presenter Paul Murray has stated that &quot;Sky News at night is a Liberal echo chamber&quot;. Drawing a strong comparison to Fox News, the network began moving towards panel-based programming from 2010, with most of its highest profile prime time commentators being conservative. Hosts Andrew Bolt and Paul Murray have been compared to Fox News presenters Bill O&#x27;Reilly and Sean Hannity respectively.

As many of the channel&#x27;s primetime contributors are conservatives - many with clear career links to the Liberal Party - the Australian Labor Party and its figureheads Victorian premier Daniel Andrews, Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and Western Australian premier Mark McGowan are frequently critiqued whilst the policies of the Liberal Party and its coalition partner the Nationals are often endorsed and promoted. During the COVID-19 pandemic beginning in the year 2020, some Sky News commentators referred to Andrews as a &#x27;dictator&#x27; and a &#x27;chairman&#x27;, drawing a comparison to socialist and communist regimes when criticising Andrews&#x27; frequent use of pandemic lockdowns and public health orders.

Sky News Australia has been a frequent critic of US President Joe Biden ever since he took office on 20 January 2021. Some commentators such as Andrew Bolt and Alan Jones have frequently spread claims about Biden&#x27;s mental health, claiming it was declining, that Biden is unfit to be the President and suggesting he was suffering from dementia.

=== Misinformation and conspiracy theories ===
On 13 December 2020, Rowan Dean promoted the Great Reset conspiracy theory on Sky News Australia, claiming that &quot;This Great Reset is as serious and dangerous a threat to our prosperity – to your prosperity and your freedom – as we have faced in decades&quot;.

As of February 2021, American far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones uses segments from Sky News Australia to back up his claims.

In July 2021, Alan Jones and Craig Kelly falsely claimed that United Kingdom data proved that getting vaccinated against COVID-19 would increase the likelihood of death due to COVID-19. The claim originated in &quot;The Daily Exposé&quot;, a British website known for promoting COVID-19 and anti-vaccine misinformation. &quot;The Daily Exposé&quot;&#x27;s claim was debunked by the BBC, Full Fact and Reuters. Sky News Australia subsequently removed the broadcast and issued a correction on its website.

On 1 August 2021, YouTube barred Sky News Australia from uploading new content onto their channel for a week for breaking YouTube&#x27;s rules on posting videos containing COVID-19 misinformation. Upon the channel&#x27;s return to the platform, Sky News Australia published a piece titled &quot;Uncancelled: Sky News Australia Set Free&quot; wherein Digital Editor Jack Houghton claimed the channel&#x27;s temporary banning was the result of Silicon Valley and left-wing media attempting to stifle free speech.

A 2022 analysis by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a British think tank, found that Sky News Australia was a major source for climate change misinformation. Sky News Australia rejected the findings of the analysis, saying that they would &quot;continue to encourage debate&quot; on climate change. In 2022, Sky News Australia promoted a now retracted journal article from the European Physical Journal that claimed to have found no evidence of climate change in two video segments. The two segments were viewed more than 500 000 times.

==Reception==

===Ratings===

The highest rating broadcast on Sky News Australia was an episode of &quot;Paul Murray Live&quot; on 26 June 2013 (following the 2013 Labor leadership spill), averaging 197,000 viewers across a special two-hour broadcast. The highest audience share Sky News Australia has achieved was during coverage of the 2009 Victorian bushfires.

On 15 December 2014 during the Sydney Lindt café siege, coverage of the unfolding incident took 16 of the 20 most watched programs on the Foxtel platform. The 7 pm (AEST) hour was the highest rated at 109,000 viewers. Sky News achieved a day time share of 2.6% (behind ABC News 24&#x27;s 3.8%) and a primetime share of 1.5% (behind ABC News 24&#x27;s 2.5%).

Sky News Live rated 56,000 viewers for early evening coverage of the 2015 Queensland state election, and 83,000 viewers for later coverage, beaten by ABC News 24&#x27;s coverage which was watched by 195,000 viewers nationally. For its coverage of the failed Liberal leadership spill on 9 February 2015 between 9 am and 10 am, Sky News Live was the second most watched subscription channel and the coverage was the third most watched program of the day with 69,000 viewers.

Sky News Live reached a total audience of 700,000 viewers on 14 September 2015 (including simulcast on Sky News Business) during the 2015 Liberal leadership spill. It was the most watched subscription television channel for the evening and outrated all free-to-air television channels between 11 pm and midnight AEST. The highest rated hour of coverage was from 10pm, achieving 190,000 viewers, the second highest ratings since the 2013 Labor Party spill.

A March 2016 article in &quot;The Guardian Australia&quot; reported Sky News averages 12,000 national viewers between 6 pm and midnight, with a peak of 18,000 between 8 pm and 10 pm, although the report did not specify what days or dates this average refers to.

During the 2016 federal election, Sky News averaged 96,000 viewers, an increase of 46% from the 2013 election.

In July 2018, Sky News claimed to have achieved its highest ratings on record, with viewership up 9% overall and its weeknight primetime (6pm–11pm) viewership 25% higher on the same period last year, according to OzTAM figures.

In August 2018, coverage of the Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill, 2018 saw Sky News gain its highest Tuesday primetime audience ever with a 4.2% audience share. &quot;Speers&quot;, &quot;Credlin&quot; and &quot;Jones &amp; Co&quot; all had their highest-rated episodes on record.

===Criticism===
In August 2018, Sky News was heavily criticised for providing a platform to Blair Cottrell, leader of the far-right, Neo-Nazi organisation United Patriots Front in a one-to-one discussion about immigration on &quot;The Adam Giles Show&quot;. Sky News presenter Laura Jayes and ABC journalist David Speers were among those critical (both on-air and off-air) of his appearance on the programme due to the fact that he has expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler and claimed to have manipulated women &quot;using violence and terror.&quot; Sky News commentator and former Labor Party minister Craig Emerson resigned in protest after the interview was broadcast, stating that &quot;My father fought Nazis in WWII and was interred in a German POW camp&quot;, and that the decision to give Cottrell a platform on Sky News was &quot;another step in a journey to normalising racism &amp; bigotry in our country&quot;. The activist group Sleeping Giants Oz called on advertisers to pull advertising campaigns off Sky News in the wake of the channel&#x27;s interview with Cottrell.

Several high-profile figures have criticised Sky News, including former prime minister Kevin Rudd, who told a media inquiry in February 2021 that it was following the &quot;template&quot; of Fox News in becoming a &quot;legitimising echo-chamber for this increasingly far-right, extremist worldview&quot;. In December 2023, former Victorian premier Daniel Andrews, who was a frequent target of scorn from Sky News pundits during his premiership, referred to the channel&#x27;s after dark coverage as &quot;bullshit&quot; and &quot;the worst of American politics imported into ours&quot;.

<text>Deer Island is one of the Fundy Islands at the entrance to Passamaquoddy Bay in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. The Old Sow tidal whirlpool is the largest in the western hemisphere can be viewed from the southern tip of the island.

Settled in the 18th century primarily by Loyalists fleeing the United States, its economy is built around fishing and aquaculture, especially its well-known herring weirs.

Although it has only a third the population it had before the 1950s, Deer Island is the main centre of West Isles Parish and falls under the Southwest NB Regional Service Commission.

==History==
===Early Settlement===
There are &quot;traces&quot; of visits to the island by indigenous Passamaquoddys, although no settlement by either the natives or French appears to have ever been attempted In 1604, Samuel de Champlain noted that a crewmember, Mssr. Poutrincourt, had almost become lost on the island. A 1733 map by Cyprian Southack suggested there may have been French homes built at one time on the southern tip of Deer Island.

The origin of the name is attributed either to Estêvão Gomes having dubbed the Penobscot River the &quot;River of Deer&quot; in 1525 leading to the island&#x27;s similar naming, or a Passamaquoddy legend about the island being a deer chased by wolves represented by the Wolf Islands. The name &quot;Deer Island&quot; is found on the 1764 Mitchell&#x27;s Fieldbook, and the Passamaquoddy name is presumed to be a translation of the English. The natives referred to the lower end of the island as &quot;Peelsquess&quot;, &quot;girl&quot;, for the shape of a rock in the water.

Until the end of the French and Indian Wars in 1760, it was not considered safe for English families to settle in the region due to the French influence over the natives since at least 1704 when the Le Treille family settled Indian Island, after Cardinal Richelieu granted the region to the care of Isaac de Razilly. At this time, Col. Gorham and Col. Benjamin Church were sent to Indian Island to raid the natives and guard over the Le Treille family.

In 1762 the colony of Massachusetts, and in 1767 the colony of Nova Scotia, began cautiously settling the area as the Passamaquoddy were now friendly and open to trade. Josiah Heney, John Frost, Alexander Hodges and James Parsons were among the first Loyalist settlers in 1763, building homes near Pleasant Point although legally squatters without title. In 1964, Reginald Richardson was scuba-diving and discovered the wreck of an unidentified colony ship with its cannonade, wine and anchor near the Sandly Island ledges off Deer Island, dated between 1770-1790.

The government assigned formal ownership of Deer Island to Joseph William Gorham on August 21, 1767 on condition that he settle families there as per an agreement of Dec 2 1766. It was presumed to be influenced by Gorham being the son or grandson of the original Col. Gorham. However Gorham was appointed to command in Newfoundland and unable to keep his pledge to settle and oversee the island, so agreed on February 3, 1770 to sell the island to another officer, Thomas Farrell for 470 pounds sterling. Here, ownership became more murky and the subject of legal battles.

Farrell led a multifaceted life, gifting land and selling cheaply on the island to families that would settle there - regaling them with tales of his marriage to a Lady-in-Waiting to Queen Charlotte, his duels and time in battle as a British lieutenant. Farrell said he had served as an ensign under Gnl. Edward Braddock at the Battle of Fort Duquesne. His sword passed through hands to Viola Calder of Fairhaven.

Six months after signing the purchase of Deer Island from Gorham, Farrell listed his Montreal property for sale and in later claimed to have relocated to Deer Island as his &quot;general residence&quot; by 1772 although again it is contested as he was not listed among residents when the government surveyed all early settlers to ascertain which local river had been commonly named St. Croix to settle a boundary dispute. It was later surmised that Farrell had agreed to sell the property on January 21, 1778 to an American, Thomas Macdonald Reed of North Carolina, for the same 470 pounds sterling he&#x27;d paid himself as Farrell was himself heading to the United States to take up arms against the British as part of the American Revolution.

In 1783, John Rolf and his widowed daughter and six grandchildren moved to the island where she married John Fountain who had moved to Deer Island with his son and daughter in 1777 after nine years on Indian island. Other loyalist settlers include John Appleby who settled in Chocolate Cove, Obediah Clarke who founded Clarke&#x27;s Point at Northwest Harbour, and the Dow family. Richardsonville was founded by Isaac Richardson, who had fought alongside Gnl. Wolfe in Quebec. George Cline of Maine had been a Sergeant during the Revolutionary War and died on Bar Island. In 1809 Joseph Conley moved to the island and later piloted the ship HMS Terror in the War of 1812, prior to its later calamity. Daniel Lambert spent his post-Revolution time between Portsmouth, New Hampshire and Deer Island, founding Lambert&#x27;s Cove. Jonathan Stover was granted 25 prior to 1786 after being part of a major 1784 sawmill on the mainland. Guss Stover ran a grocery business downhill from the Fairhaven Methodist Church, and his brother John W. Stover raised three sons and a daughter in Fairhaven towards Cummings Cove.

There was a boundary dispute with the United States over ownership of nearly all the Passamaquoddy Islands, which was settled by the 1817 Passamaquoddy Bay Commission which reaffirmed an 1803 commitment that only Moose, Frederick and Dudley Islands would not be British.

Thomas Farrell re-settled in New Brunswick post-Revolution, as the southwest corner of the province was notably fluid in its allegiance between the two nations and not concerned with his American service, seeking to have Deer Island re-granted to him and not gifted in title to a number of local families now petitioning the government for relief. He claimed that Reed had never paid him in full before his death, so the earlier sale was null - and that he had been unaware of any obligation to register his initial purchase from Gorham for which he could produce the uncontested papers. Complicating matters in 1789, Reed&#x27;s surviving son David unsuccessfully filed suit claiming ownership of his late father&#x27;s island and another claimant Patrick McMaster claimed to have paid 168 out of 500 pounds sterling due to purchase it from Reed before the latter&#x27;s death in a tavern. Patrick Flinn held in 1805 that he&#x27;d been undisturbed as a squatter improving a family farm and controlling Bar Island since the 1780s, other than a brief period a Thomas Doyle had spent a season building a fishing camp on the southern tip which Flinn later sold to Warren Hathaway, claiming at no time did Thomas Farrell play any role on Bar Island. Farrell&#x27;s neighbours on the island did not participate in the lawsuit seeking title deeds, while 22 others, including boys not yet adults, collectively sought 200 acres apiece guided by lawyer Ward Chipman including ironically threatening that if not granted title deeds by the British government in Canada they would remove themselves to the United States and swear loyalty there - while still seeking to impress upon the Crown Farrell&#x27;s disloyalty in having done the same. However, since his return Farrell had now been named a Captain in the Charlotte County Militia, and was promoted to Major in January 1805 re-affirming his loyalty back to British Canada. 
Ultimately the government re-granted the land back to Thomas Farrell in 1810, denying the families&#x27; petitions - leading author Martha Barto to surmise it may have been to protect the large tracts of land held by lumber and shipping magnates in St. Andrews on the mainland, as non-petitioners, John Wilson, Thomas Wyer, Dr. John Calef, Robert and William Pagan each had a vested interest in Farrell retaining ownership. Farrell was noted to attend prominent balls in St. Andrews while wearing a tricorn, and the Pagans were listed as his trusted friends in his final will. The re-grant noted that the island comprised approximately 6,300 acres - of which 4,000 acres were unsold - recognising the sales and gifts Farrell had given over the years. Farrell built a frame house at Chocolate Cove in what is today known as Roscoe McNeill&#x27;s field across from Ron Fountain&#x27;s summer house.

In 1821, 35 petitioners on the island again brought an unsuccessful suit to the government seeking title deeds to award them each land on the island in view of having lived on the island for decades. In 1822, Thomas Farrell died and was buried on Haskins Head on the property of Herman Creamer. His will assigned half his estate to his youngest and favourite child Sophia, and half his estate to be shared between his son George and other daughter Isabella. This led to the sale of the lands on Deer Island for approximately 1,000 pounds sterling, allowing settled families to finally obtain legal title.

In 1822, brothers Coburn Leonard Cummings and William Cummings built a shipyard which became Cummings Cove, although it ceased production ceased by 1850 or 1876. In 1850, Thomas Richardson began building fishing boats at Richardson, a business turned over to his son George Everett and family who continued the business until 1965.

===Heyday of the mid-19th century===
In 1866, in response to the ongoing Fenian Raids meant to destabilise and drain British forces which resulted in a brief paramilitary venture to seize Campobello, the 3rd Battalion of Charlotte County Militia were stationed on Deer Island although primarily overseen by those from Grand Manan. Their uniform in 1867 was a scarlet tunic with yellow facings and navy blue trousers. The Clinch, Chaffey, Fountain and Leonard families were all represented within its ranks.

The first waterwheel on the island was operated by the Leemans near Lord&#x27;s Cove., although a more important tidal mill was built in Mill Cove.

The 1869 Saxby Gale destroyed a vast wharf infrastructure that covered much of the Leonardville harbour in a complex of buildings, sheds, and smokehouses; the area never recovered to the industry it had been prior to the storm.

Historians believe Lord&#x27;s Cove was the first Churches of Christ denomination in New Brunswick, As of 1876, a second Church of Christ was planted at Bar Island Harbour, with Free Will Baptist and Methodist churches elsewhere on the island. There were 800 members of the Churches of Christ, 646 Baptists, 74 Anglicans, 111 Methodist, 9 Catholics and 6 Adventists, as well as 15 professing no religion.
In 1874, Charles Dudley Warner advocated that the United States seize Deer Island and Campobello by force, to the point of war if necessary - to ensure Canada was not used against the United States.

Myer Lord lived in Northern Harbour, with his wife Eunice, and claimed to be a faith healer be right of being the seventh son of a seventh son.

===20th and 21st centuries===

The island was not easily reached except by those with private boats, until 1900 when the &quot;Deer Island and Campobello Steamboat Co. Ltd had its steamship &quot;Viking&quot; begin taking passengers from the mainland to Leonardville, after which the &quot;Grand Manan&quot; and the &quot;Connors Bros&quot; also made regular weekly stops at the island. Notable guests to attend the island formally included Governors-General Freeman Thomas Willingden and Vincent Massey, as well as William Lyon Mackenzie King. By the 1920s, a 65&#x27; sloop dubbed the &quot;Rex Mailboat&quot; was the first ship to bring mail six days a week, captained by Herbert Calder. Each day it would stop at Lord&#x27;s Cove, Richardson, Leonardville and Chocolate Cove before departing for Campobello, Eastport, back to Deer Island&#x27;s Cummings Cove, before ending at St. Andrews.

In 1903, island residents formed a joint stock company the West Isles Telephone Company Ltd, and sold 400 shares at $5 apiece, then connected the island by telephone and within a year connected to the telephone exchange in Eastport, Maine. It was taken over by the NB Telephone Company in 1953. In the 1920s, when Grace Helen Mowat was gaining fame in St. Andrews for her Cottage Craft wares, she employed Deer Island residents Floyd Doughty and James Stuart to operate the pottery wheel and kiln.

In 1913, Hartley Wentworth and Frank Macdonald started a Fairhaven oil refining business &quot;Swift Tide Oil&quot; collecting waste oil from the ten sardine factories operating on the island, refined it and sold it to the St. Croix Soap Company. Twenty years later, Wentworth patented a children&#x27;s vitamin tablet with Ganong combining fish liver with chocolate. In July 1921 a fire destroyed much of the forest southeast of Fairhaven.

In 1925, James S. Lord became the first island resident to reach provincial legislature as the representative for Charlotte County; he was also a key figure in the Ku Klux Klan&#x27;s operations in Atlantic Canada.

In 1928, the &quot;Bremen&quot; flight became the first to cross the Atlantic from Europe to North America flying over Deer Island before its crash landing in Quebec. On the return flight of its three crewmen, heavy fog required them to set down their amphibious plane just off the shore of Richardson boathouse.

In World War II, a German U-boat had placed a German espionage agent into Atlantic Canada having dropped, and later retrieved, him at Northwest Harbour on Deer Island where the ship had been spotted by Osgood Leslie.

The primary source of electricity was Richardson&#x27;s shipyard&#x27;s generator until 1938 when connection was made to the mainland. A blacksmith operation by Edward Gardener, and a shop, were situated in Richardson.

In 1959, R. Greenlaw opened the 200-seat Mayfair Theatre at Chocolate Cove, but operated only four years. As of 1963, R. Greenlaw was licensed to operate a 200-seat Mayfair Theatre on the island. The Quoddy Tides newspaper was initially typeset on Deer Island in the 1960s, with material then being sent on fishing boats to Eastport, Maine for final production. In the 1980s, aquaculture was introduced to the island which replaced some of the traditional fishing businesses. The 1993 closure of the sardine factory in Fairhaven left 20% of the island unemployed. An influx of Newfoundlanders moved to the island, driven by the cod moratorium and closing paper mills in their home province.

In 2018, the largest employer on the island, Paturel&#x27;s lobster-processing plant, burned down.

===History of Agriculture===

The island&#x27;s soil is listed as ideal for potatoes, oats and vegetables. Squire James Ward built a dam his stream between English Bar and Hersonville to harvest marsh cranberries. 

In 1851, residents were producing moderate amounts of hay, turnips and potatoes while holding 240 milk-cows producing 20,000lb of butter, and 971 sheep. By 1861, sheep had increased to 1,500, and there were 920 acres planted with hay, 103 acres with potato, 42 acres with oats, and 196 farmers now outnumbered the 144 fishermen although the latter industry still employed more labourers. While oxen were plentiful, it was a matter of note that there were no horses to be found on the island at that time, and later use of a horse by Gus Stover for deliveries was considered peculiar, although they were more common by 1908. There were also nearly 200 barrels of crude oil taken from the island. 

By 1960, there was &quot;no farming whatsoever...not a cow, sheep, pig or any other livestock remains&quot; leaving farm goods as a trade deficit for the island.

===History of Smuggling===
The Loyalist George Leonard was originally put in charge of the suppression of smuggling on the Fundy Isles, which at the time was largely coordinated by David Owen &quot;who professed that to believe that he was, by condition of his grant, exempt from the operation of New Brunswick law.&quot;. Tea-chests and American goods were smuggled into New Brunswick. Sgt. Leonard &quot;declared open war on the illicit trade of the islands&quot; in 1798. He settled on 25 acres on Deer Island in 1801, where he remained until his death. Owen, who served as a justice of the peace, wrote to judge Edward Winslow in 1802, noting his concern that &quot;the influx of strangers...on Deer Island they have actually defied the proprieter Capt. Farrell and built habitations. On one or two islands are houses erected by these aliens...[we may] prevent their smuggling to our great injury&quot;. Fromits first settlement,Deer Island proved to be a haven for smugglers.

At times, errors were made and ships were seized on the wrong side of the border, with patrols complaining that the region&#x27;s fog made it impossible to tell which side of the boundary they may find themselves. This led to the 1808 American military incursion into British waters, wrongly seizing a ship loaded with flour just off the coast of Deer Island well within Canadian waters causing Lord Erskine to demand apology from US president James Madison..

The island was historically a dry county, forbidding the sale of alcohol even outside Prohibition, with author John Lorimer noting in 1876 &quot;No license for rum-selling goes from Deer Island into the county treasure box. Prohibition is hers. The flag of total abstinence waves proudly over her rocky hills and verdant valleys. Deer Island has set an example to her sister isles worthy of all imitation&quot;, and predicting Deer Island would excel above the rest of the region due to its stance. Nonetheless, a private still created whiskey in Fairhaven for a time, and later Harry Richardson ceased his mercantile trade with St. Pierre &amp; Miquelon to smuggling alcohol to the United States during Prohibition but was caught at Mowatt&#x27;s Wharf with &quot;510 gallons of alcohol and 80 gallons of rye on-board&quot; and his ship,the Ada May, was impounded. A government investigation of the state of the Fundy fisheries in 1851 further noted &quot;the Sons of Temperance had greatly improved conditions of these [Deer] Islanders&quot;.

In 1951, Member of Parliament A. Wesley Stuart of Deer Island made headlines in his defence of free trade by noting he had been a smuggler all his life, and explaining &quot;An electric refrigerator sells for $225, if you walk across the little bridge to the other side it sells for $460...I never came through [the border] in my lifetime that I did not smuggle something. I feel it is a right.&quot;.

==Geography==

Situated exactly halfway between the Equator and North Pole, the 45th line of parallel passes through Deer Island just above Johnson&#x27;s Lake. The island is covered in pine trees, and wildlife includes partridges, rabbits, waterfowl and historically foxes which were later eradicated to protect poultry flocks. Most of its coves are named for historical residents.

Between Richardson and Lord&#x27;s Cove is a hill locally known as Daddy Good&#x27;s Mountain, after the quaint gentleman who used to own the property which offered a fire-scarred peak from which to view the Bay of Fundy. Hannah Dow Hill sits in Leonardville, named for a woman who became lost and froze to death finding her missing cow in a 4-day snowstorm in the mid-19th century.

There are eight well-sheltered harbours around its irregular coast, including Chocolate Cove, Clam Cove Head and Cummings Cove. Chocolate Cove takes its name from the abundance of &quot;Geum canadense&quot; which has roots used as a chocolate substitute.

In 1876 there was a store at Cummings Cove, another at Bar Island, another at Fairhaven and two at Lord&#x27;s Cove although mercantile trade was also operated out of private homes, and by 1908 there were two general stores in Leonardville. Following his father&#x27;s success, a son of Grand Manan&#x27;s John Cook opened a satellite lobster factory on Deer Island but it soon faltered. Although there was a single post office at Cummings Cove in 1868 it served only a quarter of the island and as late as 1870, Wealthy Brooks Butler noted most of the island relied on inconsistent monthly deliveries coming through Eastport - leading the 1876 diversion of the new mailship &quot;Stroud&quot; to stop at Campobello and Deer Island before reaching Grand Manan. From 1903-1969, a post office operated at Chocolate Cove. By 1878 there were post offices in Fairhaven and Lord&#x27;s Cove.

The south portion of the island is made of scattered hills on an inclined plane, composed of trap rock and slate. The northern portion of the island contains small deposits of magnetic iron ore, white quartz, zeolite, chlorite, greenstone (a type of trap rock containing hornblende and feldspar), toadstone and amygdaloid.

The eastern coast of the island and surrounding waters have been the perennial subject of government interest in trying to establish a national marine park, which has met strong opposition from local residents who rely on the waters for their livelihood. The island has a undeveloped traditional Clark Gregory Nature Preserve, spanning 73 acres in Chocolate Cove which contains a 19th century gravesite west of the shelter. There has also been opposition to converting public-use beaches on the island to expand the aquaculture industry. There are whales, porposises and seals present along the island&#x27;s coast.
The largest whirlpool in the Western Hemisphere, dubbed the &quot;Old Sow&quot;, is immediately off the southern tip of Deer Island, caused as tides rush past Indian Island and reach a 400&#x27; undersea trench that abuts a 281&#x27; underwater mountain. On March 28, 1830, a two-mast schooner was destroyed in the whirlpool drowning brothers Robert, James and William Stover whose widowed mother lived in Fairhaven. 

The 1803 census found Deer Island contained 32 men, 30 women and 55 children for a total population of 117. The 1840 census found 1,225 residents in addition to two &quot;persons of colour&quot; and another 200 men absent on ocean voyages. The 1851 census found 1,252 residents and five schools on the island, in addition to four churches, two sawmills, and five handmills. In 1871 there were 1,556 residents and 23 fishing vessels on the island alongside 208 smaller boats.

In 1880, the census determined there were 332 families in 286 houses, for a total population of 1,661. Of these, 1,446 identified as English, 129 Irish, 55 Scottish, 20 French, 4 Dutch, 1 German and 1 Russian.

As of 1908, there were 43 houses and a Customs Housed in Leonardville.

The only mineral rights held by the Crown are for potential finds of gold, silver or coal - although no traces of valuable minerals are known to exist. 

A nearby islet, named Pope&#x27;s Folly, saw a settler named Pope establish an ill-fated trading post. The ship &quot;New England&quot; was wrecked on the nearby Wolf Islands in 1872. The nearby Beans Island once held a number of settlers, and its own school, but has long since been abandoned. The nearby Doyle&#x27;s Island, also called Pendleton&#x27;s Island, has a 500&#x27; cliff that historically drew thrillseekers to attempt to climb. Other adventurers were prone to imagine buried pirate treasure, even from Captain Kidd locally pinpointed as somwhere behind Alonzo Calder&#x27;s house, but with little historical backing.

===Infrastructure===

The major route is New Brunswick Route 772. Two government ferries, the Deer Island Princess II and Abnaki II, connect Deer Island with L&#x27;Etete, New Brunswick on the mainland. During the summer, East Coast Ferries Ltd. operates a ferry, &quot;Hopper II&quot;, from Cummings Cove on the southern shore of Deer Island onward to Campobello Island. A defunct ferry, the &quot;Fundy Trail II&quot;, operated between Cummings Cove and the US state of Maine until 2014. Ferry service came about in 1930 after residents campaigned for reduced taxation and registration fees as they had access to only twenty kilometres of roadway which was not accessible in winter and spring - leading the Board of Trade to propose regular government ferry service.

In the 1920s, the Bank of Nova Scotia operated in the building east of the Lord&#x27;s Cove schoolhouse, following which a Deer Island Credit Union operated until its funds were depleted by a wayward employee&#x27;s embezzlement landing in front of the Supreme Court of Canada.

The road to Deer Island Point, on the southern tip of the island above the whirlpool, did not exist until 1932 previously requiring a boat to travel to the homestead of George Chaffey and his family. After the Boer War, accomplished sportsman Arnie Arneson started a Deer Island Volunteer Rifle Association which practised with .303 Lee-Enfields in Seward Welch&#x27;s field and at Cumming&#x27;s Cove, considering themselves part of a reserve militia army unaffiliated with the Canadian Army.

There are two lighthouses on Deer Island, a square frustun tower with balcony and lantern at Leonardville, and another at Deer island Point.

Herring weirs, the world&#x27;s largest lobster pound and salmon pens supplement the fishing economy.

There is a primary school on the island, while older pupils attend Fundy High School on the mainland.

There have been suggestions of building a Quoddy Power project, from the island&#x27;s southern tip with dams to the mainland of Maine and from its northern tip to the mainland of New Brunswick however they have not come to fruition.

<text>The American Simplex was an American automobile manufactured in Mishawaka, Indiana, from 1906 to 1915 by the Simplex Motor Car Company; the company shortened its product&#x27;s name to Amplex in 1910 to avoid confusion with the better-known, New York-based Simplex car, made by the Simplex Automobile Company. This change also coincided with a reorganization of the company. Originally the company manufactured a two-stroke four-cylinder 50hp model, later upsized to 6.8 liters and still rated at 50 hp. In 1910, three open-roof models and two enclosed models were offered, costing up to $5,400; the newly introduced 30/50 hp Toy Tonneau, a long, sleek four-door touring car, sold for $4,300. The Amplex&#x27;s most distinctive feature was its valveless motor, which the company claimed would offer more continuous pulling power and greater reliability. The 1910 models also offered self-starting, a feature that would not be available from major competitors, such as Cadillac, for another year or two.

They were expensive cars, a limousine being offered at as much as $5,600. Yet the firm kept using the two-stroke engine after it had become obsolete; a four-stroke was offered unsuccessfully in 1913. Gillette Motor Co took over the Amplex manufacturing facilities in 1916, but refused to manufacture conventional engine-valving, persisting with a rotary sleeve valve engine.

<text>The American Steam Car was a product of the American Steam Automobile Co, West Newton, Massachusetts, from 1924 to 1948. It was built by Thomas S. Derr, a former faculty member at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Derr specialized in servicing, modifications and improvements of Stanley steam cars. He went on to develop his own engine and boiler and offered for sale a number of cars as models of the American Steam Car, catering largely to former Stanley Steamer owners. The cars were largely conversions, the chassis, bodies, and basic components were from Hudson cars, but the hubcaps and condenser emblem bore the American name. Thomas Derr died in 1948.

<doc id="853480" wikidata="Q578359" url="?curid=853480" title="Sogdian alphabet">
<text>The Sogdian alphabet was originally used for the Sogdian language, a language in the Iranian family used by the people of Sogdia. The alphabet is derived from Syriac, a descendant script of the Aramaic alphabet. The Sogdian alphabet is one of three scripts used to write the Sogdian language, the others being the Manichaean alphabet and the Syriac alphabet. It was used throughout Central Asia, from the edge of Iran in the west, to China in the east, from approximately 100–1200 A.D.

==Structure==

Like the writing systems from which it is descended, the Sogdian writing system can be described as an abjad, but it also displays tendencies towards an alphabet. The script consists of 17 consonants, many of which have alternative forms for initial, middle, and final position. As in the Aramaic alphabet, long vowels were commonly written with matres lectionis, the consonants &quot;aleph&quot;, &quot;yodh&quot; and &quot;waw&quot;. However, unlike Aramaic and most abjads, these consonant signs would also sometimes serve to express the short vowels (which could also sometimes be left unexpressed as in the parent systems). To disambiguate long vowels from short ones, an additional aleph could be written before the sign denoting the long vowel. The alphabet also includes several diacritics, which were used inconsistently. It is written from right to left, but by the time it had evolved into its child system, the Old Uyghur alphabet, it had been rotated 90 degrees, written vertically in columns from left to right. Voiced and voiceless fricatives are consistently not distinguished in the script.

Aramaic logograms also appear in the script, remnants of adapting the Aramaic alphabet to the Sogdian language. These logograms are used mainly for functional words such as pronouns, articles, prepositions, and conjunctions.

==Letters==
==Varieties==

Three main varieties of the Sogdian alphabet developed over time: Early Sogdian, a Hindu-Buddhist archaic non-cursive type; the sutra script, a calligraphic script used in Sogdian Buddhist scriptures; and the so-called &quot;Uyghur&quot; cursive script (not to be confused with the Old Uyghur alphabet). Early Sogdian dates to the early fourth century C.E., and is characterized by distinct, separated graphemes. The sutra script appears around 500 C.E., while the cursive script develops approximately a century later. The cursive script is thus named because its letters are connected with a base line. Since many letters in the cursive script are extremely similar in form, to the point of being indistinguishable, it is the most difficult to read of the three varieties. As the Sogdian alphabet became more cursive and more stylized, some letters became more difficult to distinguish, or were distinguished only in final position, e.g. &quot;n&quot; and &quot;z&quot;.

==Source materials==

The Sogdian script is known from religious texts of Buddhism, Manichaeism, and Christianity, as well as from secular sources such as letters, coins, and legal documents. The oldest known Sogdian documents are 5 letters known as the Ancient Letters, found in 1907 by Sir Aurel Stein in a watchtower near Dunhuang, China. These letters date to approximately 312–313 C.E. and are written in Early Sogdian.

The Sogdian Buddhist texts, written in the sutra script, are younger, dating to approximately the sixth to eighth or ninth century. They were found during the first two decades of the twentieth century in one of the caves of the Thousand Buddhas in the Chinese province of Gansu. The bulk of these manuscripts reside in the British Library, the Bibliothèque nationale de France, and the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Another important discovery was of the Mug Documents in 1933 by Soviet scholars. These documents were found in the remains of a fortress on Mount Mug in northern Tajikistan. The documents, numbering over 76, were written on many different types of materials, such as paper, silk, wood, and skin. According to the dates on the documents, they date to the eighth century C.E. The majority of them were written using the Sogdian cursive script.

==Child writing systems==

The &quot;Uyghur&quot; cursive script eventually developed into the Old Uyghur alphabet, which was used to write the Old Uyghur language. This child script was, however, rotated 90 degrees, written in a vertical direction from top to bottom, but with the first vertical line starting from the left side, not from the right as in Chinese, most probably because the right-to-left direction was used in horizontal writing. The Traditional Mongolian alphabet, being an adaptation of the Old Uyghur alphabet, still uses this kind of vertical writing, as does its more remote descendant Manchu.

==Encoding==
There are fonts encoding Sogdian alphabets in Unicode – Noto Sans Old Sogdian and Noto Sans Sogdian.
In Syriac script, three additional characters were used to represent sounds of Sogdian that were not present in the Syriac language. These were included in Unicode in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;L2/02-009&quot;&gt;Bunz, Carl-Martin (2002) &quot;Meeting report: 2nd Iranian Unicode Meeting&quot; https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2002/02009-iranian.pdf &quot;For the Sogdian script (as well as the Uyghur script), two possible encoding strategies were discussed. While the soundest solution would consist in providing a code block of its own, a mapping onto the existing Unicode block of Mongolian (U+1800-18af) would be historically also adequate, given that the latter script developed from it.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

*074F ݏ Syriac Letter Sogdian Fe (compare 0726 ܦ Syriac Letter Pe)

Old Sogdian and Sogdian were added to the Unicode Standard in June, 2018 with the release of version 11.0. 

===Blocks===

The Unicode block for Old Sogdian is U+10F00–U+10F2F and contains 40 characters:

<doc id="853487" wikidata="Q5476708" url="?curid=853487" title="Fox Footy Channel">
<text>The Fox Footy Channel was a channel exclusively dedicated to Australian rules football. It was owned by Foxtel and operated out of their Melbourne-based studios. From 2002 to 2006 it was available on Foxtel, Austar, Optus Television, TransTV and Neighbourhood Cable until transmission ceased on 1 October 2006. The channel was revived as Fox Footy for the 2012 AFL season after a new broadcast agreement was reached between Fox Sports and the AFL.

==History==
The channel was created in 2002 after News Limited won the television broadcast rights to the AFL for the 2002 to 2006 seasons. It granted free to air rights to the Nine Network and Network Ten and granted the subscription rights to Foxtel. Fox Footy was originally offered by Foxtel for an additional subscription during the first two seasons of the rights agreement; however, it was moved to the Basic package in February 2004, making it available to all Foxtel subscribers without additional charge for the balance of its life.

Due to broadcasting rights, each state had a separate version of the channel to allow free-to-air right holders exclusive live coverage. For example, if Channel Nine or Channel Ten broadcast a match between the Adelaide Crows and Sydney Swans live in Adelaide, Fox Footy would have been prevented from showing the match live, whereas if Nine or Ten didn&#x27;t broadcast it in Melbourne, Fox Footy would be allowed to show it live there. Fox Footy typically repeated all matches after they were played, although often with the commentary of the free-to-air network that presented it live originally. Fox Footy only broadcast the AFL and not any state football leagues such as SANFL, WAFL or VFL.

===End of the channel===
The future of the channel was placed in doubt after the Seven Network and Network Ten were awarded the AFL rights from 2007 to 2011. On 23 August 2006, Foxtel announced the Fox Footy Channel would cease broadcasting at the conclusion of the current AFL season and be replaced with Fox Sports 3. Foxtel CEO Kim Williams stated &quot;It&#x27;s not financially viable to continue operating a 24-hour-a-day (Australian rules) football channel when we can only get three live games a week and not on the terms we have sought.&quot; The channel ended after a replay of the 2006 AFL Grand Final at 4.00am. Seven and Ten later came to terms with Foxtel and four games per round will be shown on pay-TV through the Fox Sports channels.

===Revival===

It was announced on 28 April 2011 that the channel will be revived for the 2012 AFL season. The channel returned exclusively on Foxtel and its broadcasting partners, under the proposed new name of &quot;Fox Sports AFL&quot;, which was later changed back to its original name &quot;Fox Footy&quot;. The channel relaunched on Friday 17 February 2012 with the first NAB Cup round-robin match between Hawthorn, Richmond and North Melbourne broadcast that night. &quot;Fox Footy&quot; broadcasts all NAB Challenge games exclusively, all home and away matches and all finals matches (except for the Grand Final which screens exclusively on Seven). All matches are broadcast live to air in both Standard and High Definition with no commercial breaks during play. When two live matches are being played simultaneously, Fox Sports 1 broadcasts one of the matches. Football personalities and commentators who signed or re-signed to be a part of the relaunched channel included Eddie McGuire (who commentates one non-Collingwood match a week and hosts his own talk show), Gerard Healy, Paul Roos, Jason Dunstall, Dwayne Russell, Brad Johnson, Alastair Lynch, Tony Shaw, Liam Pickering, David King, Danny Frawley, Mark Ricciuto, Glen Jakovich, Anthony Hudson and Dermott Brereton.

<text>The American Steamer was an American steam car manufactured by the American Steam Truck Co. of Elgin, Illinois, from 1922 to 1924.

The American Steamer was typical of the steam cars which flooded the market in the early 1920s. It featured a twin-cylinder compound double-acting motor deemed capable of at least . The company offered a touring car, a roadster, a coupe, and a sedan. Between 16 and 20 were built. The prototype was tested as early as 1918, but the company went bankrupt shortly thereafter.

<doc id="853491" wikidata="Q409266" url="?curid=853491" title="Airport railway line, Brisbane">
<text>Airtrain (also known as the Airport railway line) is the privately owned commuter railway line that extends northeast from Brisbane ( from Central station by rail), the state capital of Queensland, to Brisbane Airport at both its separate International and Domestic terminals. It was opened in 2001.

The line is carried on an elevated prestressed concrete viaduct for its entire length after branching off from the Queensland Rail network at Eagle Junction railway station.

Airtrain Citylink will pass ownership of the line to Queensland Rail in 2036.

==Ownership and business==
The Airtrain service is a private enterprise. The line is owned and operated by Airtrain Citylink Limited, with financial backing from Transfield Services, Macquarie Bank, Colonial First State and ABN AMRO. The first service ran on 5 May 2001. Airtrain Citylink has a licence from Queensland Transport under a BOOT scheme – build, own, operate and transfer – to build the rail line, to own and operate it, and hand entire infrastructure over to the Queensland Government after 35 years when the company will then cease to exist.

The line connects seamlessly with the Queensland Rail City network and services use City network rolling stock in a commercial agreement with QR. While City network rolling stock is used, Airtrain does not form part of the Translink integrated public transport scheme, and therefore fares are not subsidised by the government. As a result, travel between the airport and City network stations in the Brisbane central business district costs $19.80 one way and $37.60 return (as of December 2022; cheaper on-line). Travel on Airtrain services between ordinary City network stations, not involving airport travel, is charged at the normal Translink rate, including concession (pensioner) rates.

In 2008, Brisbane&#x27;s Airtrain ran an operating profit of $4.8 million, allowing Airtrain to pay dividends of $1.95 to its shareholders.
Airtain is not subsidised by the Queensland Government, and its $220 million construction cost was entirely privately financed. This makes it one of a few known profitable public transport systems.

In late 2012, UK pension fund Universities Superannuation Scheme bought Airtrain for .

In 2024, the Queensland Government announced half-price tickets to Brisbane Airport for a 6-month period after negotiating a temporary subsidy deal with Airtrain.

==Patronage==
Initial passenger numbers on the service were well below expectations and the company nearly faced voluntary administration in 2003. However, in May 2005, Airtrain operated at a profit for the first time due to significant passenger growth – 1.12 million passengers in the 2004–2005 financial year, an increase of 40% – and a complex company restructure that cut costs by nearly half.

Passenger numbers on the service have also steadily increased, now close to two million passengers each year. In 2008, 6% of visitors to the airport used an Airtrain service. This figure rose to 8% in 2011.

==Line guide and services==
Commencing at the Domestic Terminal, all services stop at the International Terminal and then all stations though the Brisbane CBD to at least Roma Street. The typical travel time between Domestic Terminal and Brisbane City is approximately 22 minutes (to Central). This travel time results in an average train speed of .

Airport line services run every fifteen minutes during the morning and afternoon weekday peak hours, and every half hour during the off-peak. Most services continue as Gold Coast line services.

Passengers for/from the Doomben, Caboolture, Shorncliffe and Redcliffe Peninsula lines change at Eagle Junction, Ferny Grove and Nambour and Gympie North lines at Bowen Hills, and all other lines at Central.

==Proposed Skygate station==
Brisbane Airport Corporation has proposed a new station at its Skygate retail park at the south-western edge of the airport. Discussions have taken place with Airtrain Holdings Limited and the Queensland Government.

==Criticism==
Brisbane Airtrain has been criticised in the media for its perceived high fares, monopoly and exclusivity rights over public transport access to Brisbane Airport, services not operating late enough into the evening, and operating significantly fewer services (632 per week) when compared against Perth&#x27;s Airport train line (1019 per week).

<doc id="853493" wikidata="Q7561194" url="?curid=853493" title="Song poem">
<text>Song poems are songs with lyrics by usually non-professional writers that have been set to music by commercial companies for a fee. This practice, which has long been disparaged in the established music industry, was also known as &quot;song sharking&quot; and was conducted by several businesses throughout the 20th century in North America.

== Production and promotion ==
From the early 20th century, the business of recording song poems was promoted through small display ads in popular magazines, comic books, tabloids, men&#x27;s adventure journals, and similar publications&quot;,&quot; soliciting lyrics for songs. Those who sent their poetry to one of the production companies usually received notice by mail that their work was worthy of recording by professional musicians, along with a proposal to do so in exchange for a fee. The early 20th century versions of this business involved setting the words to music and printing up sheet music from inexpensively engraved plates.

In producing the recordings, musicians often recorded dozens of songs per recording session using minimal resources. Using a method called &quot;sight-singing,&quot; they wrote the music as they read the lyrics and played along, sometimes finishing a song in just one take. Some of the companies recorded new vocals over pre-recorded music backing tracks, using the same music tracks hundreds of times. The recordings were then duplicated on 45 RPM vinyl singles or on individual cassette tapes, or released on compilation LPs with other song poems. Copies of the recording were sent to the customer; promises that they would also be sent to radio stations or music industry executives were rarely, if ever, kept.

==Song poem writers==

Noted examples of those who have used the song poem approach include:

*Rodd Keith (born Rodney Keith Eskelin, 1937–1974), a prolific composer and performer of song poems who has been described as the &quot;Mozart&quot; of the genre. Several compilations of his song poem recordings have been released on CD with liner notes by his son, avant-garde jazz saxophonist Ellery Eskelin.

*Caglar Juan Singletary, (born 1972) who featured in the 2003 documentary &quot;Off The Charts: The Song-Poem Story&quot;. His most famous composition is &quot;Annie Oakley&quot;, music written by artist David Fox. 

*Norridge Mayhams (1903–1988), also known as Norris the Troubadour, who issued a succession of records between the 1930s and 1980s, many produced by song-poem professionals.

*Thomas J. Guygax Sr. (1921–1999), of Springfield, Missouri, a lyricist noted for his unconventional approach to word order and syntax.

*John Trubee (born 1957), whose song &quot;Peace &amp; Love&quot; (commonly known as &quot;Blind Man&#x27;s Penis&quot;), written to test whether or not a song-poem firm would accept &quot;the most ridiculous, stupid, vile, obscene&quot; lyrics he could write, was recorded by country singer Ramsey Kearney; it has been described as &quot;the most famous song-poem recording of all time&quot;. The original lyrics referred to &quot;Stevie Wonder&#x27;s penis&quot;, but Kearney replaced all references to Wonder with the generic phrase &quot;a blind man&quot;.

==In media==

In 2003, the documentary &quot;Off The Charts: The Song-Poem Story&quot; was aired on PBS. Gene Merlino, who claimed to have sung on more than 10,000 song poems, was featured in the documentary. It has since been released on DVD, and the soundtrack was released on CD.

The 2007 Craig Zobel drama &quot;Great World of Sound&quot; depicts a modern-day version of &quot;song sharking,&quot; and featured scenes where real unsigned musicians audition for the actors portraying the ersatz music producers; these artists ultimately had their songs properly licensed and featured in the finished film.

Tom Ardolino of NRBQ curated an LP and several compilation CDs of material taken from his personal collection (&quot;The Beat of The Traps&quot;, &quot;The Makers of Smooth Music&quot;, &quot;The Human Breakdown of Absurdity&quot;, &amp; &quot;I&#x27;m Just The Other Woman&quot;). His work, along with the efforts of others such as Phil Milstein, musicologist Irwin Chusid of WFMU radio, Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo, Bob Purse, James Lindbloom, and Penn Jillette, has allowed song poems to reach a level of notoriety unthinkable in their own time.

<doc id="853494" wikidata="Q467117" url="?curid=853494" title="American Underslung">
<text>The American Underslung was an American automobile, the brainchild of Harry Stutz and designer Fred Tone, manufactured in Indianapolis from 1905 to 1914 by American Motor Car Company.

== Design ==
The American Underslung&#x27;s chassis design and huge wheels gave it a distinctive appearance and it was noticeably lower than other cars from the same era. The chassis was hung below the axles rather than set atop them, with the engine and transmission mass moved closer to the ground lowering the center of gravity and giving sports car appearance and handling. The design mounted the engine and body within the frame rails rather than on the top as with other cars of the era. Developed in collaboration with Harry Stutz, the 1905 Underslung &quot;was one of the most significant, if unsung, automobiles of this century&#x27;s first decade.&quot;

The automobiles were marketed at the upper price range of the market. Prices for the American Underslung ranged from US$1,250 to $4,000. The cars came with Teetor-Harley straight-4 engines producing , as measured by an old system, and starting in 1908 a with became available. Additionally, a six-cylinder engine was capable of , one of the strongest cars of its time.

==Versions==
The American Underslung came in several versions:
* A two door sports version, called the &quot;Scout Roadster&quot;.
* Around 1909, American introduced a four-passenger Underslung dubbed &quot;The Traveler.&quot; An example of this car, chassis #1687, is on display at the Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum in Philadelphia, PA, USA.
* The car was also available from 1905 to 1908 with a conventional chassis design; this model was called the &quot;American Tourist&quot;. It came in another version, a two door sports version, called the Scout Roadster.

Updates:
* In 1910, the horsepower rating for the engine was increased to by enlarging the cylinder bore and adding pressurized lubrication.
* In 1913, electric starters and lights became available on the Underslungs.

== Closure ==
The American Underslung marketing slogan was &quot;The Car For The Discriminating Few&quot; and apparently there were few buyers. Although new models were introduced for 1914 and the company continued to boast the American Underslung was &quot;America’s Most Luxurious Car&quot;, the end came when the firm was put into receivership in November 1913.

<doc id="853496" wikidata="Q3841571" url="?curid=853496" title="MTV (Australian and New Zealand TV channel)">
<text>MTV was a 24-hour general entertainment channel specialising in music and youth culture programming which serves Australia and New Zealand. Paramount Networks UK &amp; Australia headquartered in London with a local office at Network 10&#x27;s headquarters in Sydney is responsible for marketing and advertising in Australia and New Zealand. The channel was replaced by MTV Global in August 2023.

==History==
===MTV on the Nine Network===
The &quot;MTV&quot; brand was launched in Australia during April 1987 as a music program that aired late on Friday and Saturday nights for its full six-year run on the free-to-air Nine Network. The program was hosted by Richard Wilkins and Joy Smithers with music news from Alison Drower. Its competitors at the time were ABC TV&#x27;s &quot;Rage&quot; (which also started in April 1987) and Network Ten&#x27;s &quot;Video Hits&quot; (which started in February 1987).

MTV Australia&#x27;s focus was predominantly on Australian, British, Canadian and American artists and the program rarely played other forms of rock and pop music. The program presented a mixture of music videos, interviews and segments, and depended heavily on imported US content. In its early years it also showed the MTV USA game show &quot;Remote Control&quot;.

The program was discontinued in 1993 when Nine chose not to renew the licence with Viacom. Nine said the axing was due to high production and licensing costs. Saul Shtein brought MTV to Australia with Richard Wilkins.

===ARC Music Television===

&quot;ARC Music Television&quot;, owned by Austereo, was launched three years after MTV ended on the Nine Network on 14 June 1996 in a joint venture with, then, music giant Austereo and Village Roadshow through Optus Television to become a twenty-four-hour music channel playing pop music and airing original programming. After a year on the air the network was approached by MTV Networks in the US and through a deal once again with Austereo, Village Roadshow Entertainment and Optus vision ARC was re-branded as MTV Australia.

===Re-launch and expansion===
Five months after the initial announcement of ARC&#x27;s re-branding, MTV Australia was officially re-launched on Optus Television on 20 March 1997. The channel originally produced local programmes but due to cost cutting the channel aired mostly American content.

In December 2002 MTV was added to the Foxtel platform and was added in 2004 to the Austar platform. In the same year the channel set up MTV Networks Australia, which began work on launching its own original programming with the launch of the Australian version of the hit American show TRL on 10 September 2004 with host Kyle Sandilands from 2day fm. MTV Networks Australia launched sister channel Vh1 on 14 March 2004 when cable company Foxtel launched its digital network.
In 2005 MTV premiered more original programming with MTV Full Tank and on 3 March MTV launched the first inaugural MTV Australia Video Music Awards at Luna Park&#x27;s Big Top with hosts The Osbournes. In April 2006 SelecTV began carrying the channel. At the end of 2006 it was announced that MTV would premiere its latest original show, &quot;MTV&#x27;s The Lair&quot; which premiered on 26 January 2007 and is aired live every Thursday at The Metro Theatre. In the mid to late 2000s MTV Network took ownership of the channel from Optus. At the beginning of 2007 MTV re-located its head office from Ryde to Yurong St in East Sydney. In April MTV Networks Australia launched TMF Australia on the Optus Cable Service. In February 2010 it was announced that MTV would replace sister channel VH1 with MTV Classic which launched on 1 May 2010. On the eve of the launch for MTV Classic a spokesperson for MTV Australia announced that a third channel would be launched later in 2010. It was later revealed on 20 September 2010 that MTV would launch three new channels in Australia; MTV Hits, MTVN Live and MTVN Live HD. MTV Hits will play music 24 hours a day and MTVN Live will have concerts and festivals from around the world as well as documentaries. The channel&#x27;s are set to launch on 1 November 2010. As part of expanding its local programming, MTV Australia announced its first reality series &quot;Freshwater Blue&quot; which follows the lives of twelve Australian teenagers in the Northern Beaches suburb of Freshwater.

===2010–present===
In June 2010 the channel became available on the new FetchTV service. In 2010 the MTV Australia and MTV New Zealand feeds were merged and the combined MTV Australia and New Zealand began broadcasting out of the network&#x27;s Sydney offices.

As of Autumn 2013, Viacom International Media Networks in Sydney has relocated its MTV (for Australia and New Zealand) and Comedy Central (New Zealand) channels to VIMN in London. The channels advertising department will remain in Sydney for the time being.

In February 2018, MTV Australia was made available in HD (720p) on Fetch TV, becoming the first and only provider in Australia to do so. Sky also broadcasts the channel in HD.

On 17 September 2019, it was reported that sister channel Network 10 would launch a free-to-air MTV Australia in the coming months. A further announcement was made in May 2020 regarding a fourth multichannel from Network 10, which is expected to feature content from the back catalogue of ViacomCBS properties such as MTV and Nickelodeon. This was confirmed by the network on 13 July 2020, with the new channel launching as 10 Shake in September 2020. It will air kids content, primarily from Nickelodeon, from 6am to 6pm, with MTV, Comedy Central and CBS programming targeting young adults and adolescents airing from 6pm onwards.

On 1 August 2023, MTV was removed from Foxtel (alongside Nick and Nick Jr.), coinciding with the relaunch of 10 Shake as a free-to-air version of Nickelodeon. At the same time, a suite of MTV-branded Pluto TV FAST channels were made available on Paramount-owned BVOD service 10Play. MTV Australia and New Zealand was replaced by MTV Global in August 2023.
The decision to change the feed to the international channel was confirmed by Paramount Global in October 2023. The decision to axe Australian music and programming was criticised by the music industry in Australia. MTV will continue to operate country specific content through its Australian themed social media.

===Availability===
MTV Australia was originally only available through the Optus Television service (previously Optus Vision). This exclusivity deal was dropped in late 2002 and in 2003 MTV became available in a premium package on the Foxtel subscription TV platform. Around this time the channel also became available on the Austar platform.

Currently MTV is carried by all English-language pay TV providers. It is available as a basic channel on Foxtel, Austar, TransTV, Neighbourhood Cable and Fetch. On Optus Television the channel is available in add-on tiers. It was formerly available on SelecTV until the closure of its English service in late 2010.

==Other projects==
===MTV Australia Awards===

In 2005 MTV Australia launched the first ever MTV Australia Video Music Awards (Now known as the MTV Australia Awards), based on the VMA awards format used in Europe and the US. It was held at Luna Park in Sydney. Following suit with the location, the AVMAs had a circus theme and was hosted by various members of the Osbourne family. The awards ceremony included many international and local guests. In 2010 it was announced that MTV Networks Australia will launch &quot;MTV Classic&quot;. As part of the launch MTV will have a music event that will replace the annual awards ceremony for 2010.

===Optus ONE80PROJECT===
In a joint venture with Sony Ericsson and Optus, MTV launched the Optus ONE80PROJECT which was a competition for young writers, directors and producers to create a three-minute pilot and script to be aired on TV, mobile phone and internet. The prize was an opportunity to work with the MTV production team to create full-length dramas to air on the MTV Network. The entries opened on 11 September 2006 and closed on 24 November 2006 and the voting then commenced on 1 December 2006 and closed on 26 January 2007. The voting consisted of Viewers Choice and Judges Choice. The winners were announced on 7 February 2007 with The Viewers Choice going to &quot;Ben Briand&quot; for Hammer Bay and the Judges Choice going to &quot;Karl Mather&quot; and &quot;Zenon Kohler&quot; for Takoyaki City. In 2007 the competition ran again with the winners announced on 28 January 2008 at the ONE80PROJECT festival screening at Harmony Park in Surry Hills. The Viewers Choice Award went to &quot;Kade Robinson&quot; for Generation When and the Judges Choice went to &quot;Sarah Daggar-Nickson&quot; and &quot;Scott Otto Anderson&quot; for their co-production Dream Life. The 2008 competition is currently underway with winners to be announced early 2009.

==Controversies==
===&quot;Vote for Snoop&quot; campaign===
In 2007 rapper Snoop Dogg was to attend the MTV Australia Video Music Awards 2007 as a co-host on 29 April but a few days prior to the event it was announced that Immigration Minister Kevin Andrews would not grant him a Visa into the country because of past criminal convictions overseas. In response MTV Australia organised the &quot;Vote for Snoop&quot; campaign through MySpace which contained videos talking about how much he wants to become an Australian citizen in different situations.

== Links with free-to-air television ==
Occasionally Australian free to air television stations look at the success of shows on MTV before purchasing them for broadcast. In particular, Network Ten who purchased broadcast rights to The Osbournes from MTV Networks. Ten was required to wait until the show had aired on MTV Australia before broadcasting on their own channel. Later Ten purchased rights to Jackass, Pimp My Ride (but as of 2012, is being shown on 7mate) and Laguna Beach.

Public broadcaster ABC also purchased the rights to animation Daria, which formerly aired during its children&#x27;s programming slot, edited for content. As of September 2016, Daria is airing on SBS Viceland.

As of 2009 programmes from MTV Networks are being screened on the Nine Network Channel GO!. The Hills is currently being broadcast on the channel.

In late 2011, Network Ten bought the rights to air Geordie Shore on its channel for free to air television. It started airing on its digital channel &quot;Eleven&quot; in 2012 and continues to air as of 2013.

As of December 2019, Network 10 is now a sister operation to MTV, following the 2019 merger of CBS and Viacom.

== Website ==
The MTV Australia website has had a turbulent past. It was originally hosted without a domain name by Village Roadshow. It gained a domain name in 1998 as mtv.com.au. The website was very basic and only included information about MTV Unplugged and the American VMAs. In 1999 the website seemed to have been abandoned completely. In 2000 the website simply redirected to the American MTV site before the domain expired and was locked by a holding company. With MTV&#x27;s expansion in 2003 the site was revived but pointed towards the MTV Asia Awards. A proper MTV Australia website was launched in 2004 and has since gone through several redesigns. Mini sites for TRL Australia and the AVMAs were also set up.

The site was redesigned in 2007 and free broadband video channel MTV Overdrive launched on 19 April 2007 to coincide with the MTV Australia Video Music Awards 2007, which the Overdrive Channel is only available throughout the territory.

In 2009 the website was re-designed and now mimics mtv.com

<doc id="853501" wikidata="Q524353" url="?curid=853501" title="Erythromelalgia">
<text>Erythromelalgia, or Mitchell&#x27;s disease (after Silas Weir Mitchell), is a rare vascular peripheral pain disorder in which blood vessels, usually in the lower extremities or hands, are episodically blocked (frequently on and off daily), then become hyperemic and inflamed. There is severe burning pain (in the small fiber sensory nerves) and skin redness. The attacks are periodic and are commonly triggered by heat, pressure, mild activity, exertion, insomnia or stress. Erythromelalgia may occur either as a primary or secondary disorder (i.e. a disorder in and of itself or a symptom of another condition). Secondary erythromelalgia can result from small fiber peripheral neuropathy of any cause, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, hypercholesterolemia, mushroom or mercury poisoning, and some autoimmune disorders. Primary erythromelalgia is caused by mutation of the voltage-gated sodium channel α-subunit gene &quot;SCN9A&quot;.

In 2004 erythromelalgia became the first human disorder in which it has been possible to associate an ion channel mutation with chronic neuropathic pain, when its link to the SCN9A gene was initially published in the &quot;Journal of Medical Genetics&quot;. Later that year, in an article in &quot;The Journal of Neuroscience&quot;, Cummins et al., demonstrated, using voltage clamp recordings, that these mutations enhanced the function of NaV1.7 sodium channels, which are preferentially expressed within peripheral neurons. One year later, in an article in &quot;Brain&quot;, Dib-Hajj et al., demonstrated that NaV1.7 mutants channels, from families with inherited erythromelalgia (IEM), make dorsal root ganglion (DRG, peripheral and sensory), neurons hyper excitable, thereby demonstrating the mechanistic link between these mutations and pain, thereby firmly establishing NaV1.7 gain-of-function mutations as the molecular basis for IEM. Conversely, in December 2006 a University of Cambridge team reported an SCN9A mutation that resulted in a complete lack of pain sensation in a Pakistani street performer and some of his family members. He felt no pain, walked on hot coals and stabbed himself to entertain crowds. By 2013, nearly a dozen gain-of-function mutations of NaV1.7 had been linked to IEM. The multi-decades search which identified gene SCN9A as the cause of inherited erythomelalgia is documented in a book by Stephen Waxman, &quot;Chasing Men on Fire: The Story of the Search for a Pain Gene&quot;.

==Classification==
Primary erythromelalgia may be classified as either familial or sporadic, with the familial form inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Both of these may be further classified as either juvenile or adult onset. The juvenile onset form occurs prior to age 20 and frequently prior to age 10. While the genetic cause of the juvenile and sporadic adult onset forms is often known, this is not the case for the adult onset familial form.

In rural areas of southern China, outbreaks of erythromelalgia have occurred during winter and spring at 3-5 year intervals among secondary school students. This epidemic form of erythromelalgia has been viewed as a different form of non-inherited primary erythromelalgia and affects mainly teenage girls in middle schools. The disease is characterized by burning pain in the toes and soles of the feet, accompanied by foot redness, congestion, and edema; a few patients may have fever, palpitations, headache, and joint pain. In the 1987 epidemic in Hubei, 60.6% of patients had a common cold before the onset of erythromelalgia and 91.2% had pharyngitis.

==Symptoms and signs==
The most prominent symptoms of erythromelalgia are episodes of erythema, swelling, a painful deep-aching of the soft tissue (usually either radiating or shooting) and tenderness, along with a painful burning sensation primarily in the extremities. These symptoms are often symmetric and affect the lower extremities more frequently than the upper extremities. Symptoms may also affect the ears and face. For secondary erythromelalgia, attacks typically precede and are precipitated by the underlying primary condition. For primary erythromelalgia, attacks can last from an hour to months at a time and occur infrequently to frequently with multiple times daily. Attacks most frequently occur at night, thus having the potential to greatly interfere with sleep. Common triggers for daytime episodes are exertion, heating of the affected extremities, and alcohol or caffeine consumption, and any pressure applied to the limbs. In some patients sugar and even melon consumption have also been known to provoke attacks. Many of those with primary erythromelalgia avoid wearing shoes or socks as the heat this generates is known to produce erythromelalgia attacks. The coexistence of erythromelalgia and Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon is rare, but case studies of patients with both diagnoses have been reported in medical journals. Symptoms may present gradually and incrementally, sometimes taking years to become intense enough for patients to seek medical care. In other cases symptoms emerge full blown with onset.

Epidemic erythromelalgia is characterized by burning pain in the toes and soles of the feet, accompanied by foot redness, congestion, and edema; a few patients may have fever, palpitations, headache, and joint pain. In the 1987 epidemic in Hubei, 60.6% of patients had a common cold before the onset of erythromelalgia and 91.2% had pharyngitis.

==Cause==
In general, erythromelalgia seems to consist of neuropathological and microvascular alterations. How this occurs in secondary erythromelalgia is poorly understood and may be specific to the underlying primary condition. Primary conditions that have been shown to elicit erythromelalgia are listed in diagnosis, below.

Primary erythromelalgia is a better understood autosomal dominant disorder. The neuropathological symptoms of primary erythromelalgia arise from hyperexcitability of C-fibers in the dorsal root ganglion. Specifically, nociceptors (neurons responsible for the sensation and conduction of painful stimuli) appear to be the primarily affected neurons in these fibers. This hyperexcitability results in the severe burning pain experienced by patients. While the neuropathological symptoms are a result of hyperexcitability, microvascular alterations in erythromelalgia are due to hypoexcitability. The sympathetic nervous system controls cutaneous vascular tone and altered response of this system to stimuli such as heat likely results in the observed microvascular symptoms. In both cases, these changes in excitability are typically due to mutation of the sodium channel NaV1.7. These differences in excitability alterations between the sympathetic nervous system and nociceptors is due to different expression of sodium channels other than NaV1.7 in them.

What causes epidemic erythromelalgia in southern China remains unknown although several erythromelalgia-associated poxviruses were isolated from throat swabs of several patients at different counties and from two different seasons.

===Side effect of medication===
Several medications, including verapamil and nifedipine, as well as ergot derivatives such as bromocriptine and pergolide, have been associated with medication-induced erythromelalgia.

===Mushroom poisoning===
The consumption of two species of related fungi, &quot;Clitocybe acromelalga&quot; from Japan, and &quot;Clitocybe amoenolens&quot; from France, has led to several cases of mushroom-induced erythromelalgia which lasted from 8 days to 5 months.

===Possible infectious cause===

An epidemic form of this syndrome occurs in secondary school students in rural areas of China. A large epidemic erythromelalgia was occurred in Hubei province of China in 1987 and the disease was characterized by burning pain in the toes and soles of the feet, accompanied by foot redness, congestion, and edema; a few patients had fever, palpitations, headache, and joint pain. 60.6% of patients had a common cold before the onset of erythromelalgia and 91.2% had pharyngitis. Subsequently, a virus - erythromelalgia-related poxvirus (ERPV) - was repeatedly isolated from throat swabs of six separate patients from two different counties and Wuhan city in Hubei province. The genome of this virus has been sequenced and it appears that this virus is related to a strain of mousepox. Serological characterization can easily distinguish human ERPV from ectromelia virus and vaccinia virus by cross-neutralization and plaque reduction assays 

Since this virus has not yet been isolated from other outbreaks in other parts of southern China to date this putative association needs to be further investigated. The finding of the specific antibody conversion to ATIs of ERPV in patients&#x27; paired sera strengthens the evidence for a possible aetiological role of human ERPV in epidemic erythromelalgia.

==Pathophysiology==

There are 10 known mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel α-subunit NaV1.7 encoding gene, &quot;SCN9A&quot;. This channel is expressed primarily in nociceptors of the dorsal root ganglion and the sympathetic ganglion neurons. Nine of these mutations have received further study and they have all shown to result in similar biophysical alterations, Table 1. As can be seen from table 1, the primary effect of erythromelalgia mutations is NaV1.7 channels that activate at more hyperpolarized potentials. NaV1.7 channels act largely as threshold sensors and initiate action potentials. Consequently, this shift in their activation profile results in channels that open closer to the resting membrane potential. In many mutations, this shift of activation is accompanied by shifts in the voltage sensitivity of fast and/or slow inactivation, often in the depolarized direction. This results in channels that are open for a longer of period of time, producing larger and more prolonged changes in membrane potential.

Some of these mutant channels have been expressed in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) or sympathetic neurons. In DRG neurons expressing the F1449V mutation, a lower threshold is required for action potential creation (93.1 ± 12.0 pA) than those expressing wild-type channels (124.1 ± 7.4 pA). Furthermore, while DRG neurons expressing wild-type channels only respond with a few action potentials, those expressing F1449V channels respond with a high-frequency train of action potentials. There is a similar effect in DRG neurons expressing the L858H and A863P mutants. Here, there is also a notable change in resting membrane potential, being depolarized by 4-7 mV versus wild-type channel expressing cells. The situation is different, however, in sympathetic neurons expressing the L858H mutation. While L858H expressing sympathetic ganglion are depolarized ~5mV relative to wild-type expressing neurons, their threshold for action potential initiation is notably higher. Furthermore, while current injection of 40pA for 950ms provokes an average of 6 action potentials in sympathetic neurons expressing wild-type channels this stimulation evokes only approximately 2 action potentials with reduced overshoots in sympathetic neurons expressing L858H mutant channels. Further investigation has demonstrated that the differences in response between DRG and sympathetic neurons is due to expression of NaV1.8 in the former. Consequently, expression of NaV1.8 channels in sympathetic neurons also expressing L858H mutant NaV1.7 results in neurons with a depolarized resting membrane potential that nevertheless have a normal action potential threshold and overshoot.

An effective, though not recommended, treatment for erythromelalgia symptoms is cooling of the affected area. Activation of wild-type channels is unaffected by cooling. L858F mutant channels, however, are activated at more depolarized potentials when cooled than at normal body temperature. At 16 °C the activation V½ of the mutant channel is only 4.6mV more hyperpolarized that wild-type versus 9.6mV more hyperpolarized at 35 °C. Fast inactivation is affected in a similar manner in both wild-type and L858F mutant channel and is, thus, unlikely to contribute to symptom resolution due to cooling. While such cooling is unlikely to affect neuronal cell bodies, axons and termini express NaV1.7 and are present in the skin.

==Diagnosis==

Erythromelalgia is a difficult condition to diagnose as there are no specific tests available. However, reduced capillary density has been observed microscopically during flaring; and reduced capillary perfusion is noted in the patient. Another test that can be done is to have the patient elevate their legs, and note the reversal (from red to pale) in skin color. Tests done at universities include quantitative sensory nerve testing, laser evoked potentials, sweat testing and epidermal sensory nerve fiber density test (which is an objective test for small fiber sensory neuropathy). Due to the aforementioned factors, patients may face delays in diagnosis.

Once it has been established that it is not secondary erythromelalgia — see below — a programme of management can be put in place. Some diseases present with symptoms similar to erythromelalgia. Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), for instance, presents with severe burning pain and redness except these symptoms are often unilateral (versus symmetric) and may be proximal instead of purely or primarily distal. Furthermore, attacks triggered by heat and resolved by cooling are less common with CRPS.

Erythromelalgia is sometimes caused by other disorders. A partial list of diseases known to precipitate erythromelalgia is below.
:*Myeloproliferative disease
:*Hypercholesterolemia
:*Autoimmune disorder
:*Small fiber peripheral neuropathy
:*Fabry&#x27;s disease
:*Mercury poisoning
:*Mushroom poisoning
:*Obstructive sleep apnea
:*Sciatica
:*Some medications, such as fluoroquinolones, bromocriptine, pergolide, verapamil, and ticlopidine

==Treatment==
For secondary erythromelalgia, treatment of the underlying primary disorder is the most primary method of treatment. Although aspirin has been thought to reduce symptoms of erythromelalgia, it is rare to find evidence that this is effective. Mechanical cooling of the limbs by elevating them can help or managing the ambient environment frequently is often necessary constantly as flares occur due to sympathetic autonomic dysfunction of the capillaries. The pain that accompanies it is severe and treated separately (the pain is similar to CRPS, phantom limb or thalamic pain syndrome). Patients are strongly advised &quot;not&quot; to place the affected limbs in cold water to relieve symptoms when flaring occurs. It may seem a good idea, but it precipitates problems further down the line causing damage to the skin and ulceration often intractable due to the damaged skin. A possible reduction in skin damage may be accomplished by enclosing the flaring limb in a commonly available, thin, heat transparent, water impermeable, plastic food storage bag. The advice of a physician is advised depending on specific circumstances.

Primary erythromelalgia management is symptomatic, i.e. treating painful symptoms only. Specific management tactics include avoidance of attack triggers such as: heat, change in temperature, exercise or over exertion, alcohol and spicy foods. This list is by no means comprehensive as there are many triggers to set off a &#x27;flaring&#x27; episode that are inexplicable. Whilst a cool environment is helpful in keeping the symptoms in control, the use of cold water baths is strongly discouraged. In pursuit of added relief sufferers can inadvertently cause tissue damage or death, i.e. necrosis. See comments at the end of the preceding paragraph regarding possible effectiveness of plastic food storage bags to avoid/reduce negative effects of submersion in cold water baths.

One clinical study has demonstrated the efficacy of IV lidocaine or oral mexilitine, though differences between the primary and secondary forms were not studied. Another trial has shown promise for misoprostol, while other have shown that gabapentin, venlafaxine and oral magnesium may also be effective, but no further testing was carried out as newer research superseded this combination.

Strong anecdotal evidence from EM patients shows that a combination of drugs such as duloxetine and pregabalin is an effective way of reducing the stabbing pains and burning sensation symptoms of erythromelalgia in conjunction with the appropriate analgesia. In some cases, antihistamines may give some relief. Most people with erythromelalgia never go into remission and the symptoms are ever present at some level, whilst others get worse, or the EM is eventually a symptom of another disease such as systemic scleroderma.

Some suffering with EM are prescribed ketamine topical creams as a way of managing pain on a long-term basis. Feedback from some EM patients has led to reduction in usage as they believe it is only effective for short periods.Living with erythromelalgia can result in a deterioration in quality of life resulting in the inability to function in a work place, lack of mobility, depression, and is socially alienating; much greater education of medical practitioners is needed. As with many rare diseases, many people with EM end up taking years to get a diagnosis and to receive appropriate treatment.Research into the genetic mutations continues but there is a paucity of clinical studies focusing on living with erythromelalgia. There is much urgency within pharmaceutical companies to provide a solution to those who suffer with pain such as that with erythromelalgia.

===Pain relief===
Patients find relief by cooling the skin. All patients must be notified to not apply ice directly on to the skin, since this can cause maceration of the skin, nonhealing ulcers, infection, necrosis, and even amputation in severe cases.

Mild sufferers may find sufficient pain relief with tramadol or amitriptyline. Sufferers of more severe and widespread EM symptoms, however, may obtain relief only from opioid drugs. Opana ER has been found to be effective for many in the US, whilst in the UK slow-release morphine has proved to be effective. These powerful and potentially-addictive drugs may be prescribed to patients only after they have tried almost every other type of analgesia to no avail. (This delay in appropriate pain management can be a result of insurer-mandated or legally-required step therapy, or merely overly-cautious prescribing on the part of sufferers&#x27; doctors.)

The combination of Cymbalta (duloxetine) and Lyrica (pregabalin) has also proven to be useful in controlling pain, but many EM patients have found this combination has side effects that they are unable to tolerate.

==Epidemiology==

Only a small number of studies that have investigated the prevalence of EM, with four studies conducted to date.
The mean of all the studies combined results in an EM estimation incidence of 4.7/100,000 with a mean of 1 : 3.7 of the male to female ratio, respectively.

In 1997 there was a study conducted in Norway that estimated that the annual incidence of 2/100,000, with a 1 : 2.4 male to female ratio in this study
population, respectively. In 2009 there was a population-based study of EM in the USA (Olmsted County, Minnesota), that reported that the annual incidence was 1.3/100,000, with a 1 : 5.6 male to female ratio in this study population, respectively.
The incidence in this study of primary and secondary EM was 1.1 : 0.2 per 100 000 people per year, respectively.
A study of a single centre in the south of Sweden in 2012, showed the overall annual population-based incidence was 0.36/100,000.
In New Zealand (Dunedin) a study estimated that in 2013 the incidence of EM is 15/100,000, with a 1 : 3 male to female ratio in this study
population, respectively. This last study has an estimation that is at least ten times higher than the prevalence previously reported. This study recruited individuals based on self-identification of symptoms (after self-identification, patients were invited for an assessment of an EM diagnosis), instead of participants that are identified through secondary and tertiary referrals as in the other studies.

===Prevalence in China===

Epidemic EM appears quite common in female middle school students of southern China, most likely due to a sharp decline in temperature following by a rapid increase of temperature. It has been postulated that epidemic erythromelalgia might be related to a poxvirus (ERPV) infection. The disease was characterized by burning pain in the toes and soles of the feet, accompanied by foot redness, congestion, and edema; a few patients had fever, palpitations, headache, and joint pain. 60.6% of patients had a common cold before the onset of erythromelalgia and 91.2% had pharyngitis. For temperature-related theory, the acral (foot and hand) small superficial arteries intensely constrict and dilate during the sharp decline of temperature, whereas a sharp increase of temperature, the intense expansion of capillaries irritate the nerve endings around, and thus lead to syndromes including (first and second degree) burning pain, increased temperature, erythema and swelling.

==History==
The first reported case was in 1878 by Silas Weir Mitchell who suggested the term erythromelalgia to describe a syndrome of red congestion and burning pain in the hands and feet.
 He distinguished it from the painful red limbs seen in some patients with gout or rheumatoid arthritis. It is derived from the Greek words &quot;erythros&quot; (&quot;red&quot;), &quot;melos&quot; (&quot;limb&quot;) and &quot;algos&quot; (&quot;pain&quot;).
Some confusion was introduced when Smith and Allen suggested changing the name to erythermalgia in order to emphasise the symptoms of painful inflammation and warmth. In their paper they showed for the first time that when their patients used aspirin, this promptly relieved the burning pain for about three days. They also suggested a distinction between primary (idiopathic) erythromelalgia and secondary erythromelalgia (due to underlying neurologic, hematologic, or vascular problems).

In 1994 Drenth, van Genderen and Michiels distinguished between erythromelalgia and erythermalgia on the basis of responsiveness to aspirin. They established three categories: erythromelalgia (platelet-mediated and aspirin-sensitive), primary erythermalgia, and secondary erythermalgia.

Because of the confusion in terminology, Norton and Zager and Grady classified erythromelalgia in 1998 as either: primary/idiopathic erythromelalgia or secondary erythromelalgia. The primary/idiopathic form of erythromelalgia is not associated with any other disease process and can be either early onset (in children) or adult onset. In their paper they described secondary erythromelalgia as being associated with another disease, often related to a myeloproliferative disorder and has also seen cases of: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, astrocytoma of the brain, vasculitis, and pernicious anemia.

The following table shows the history of the nomenclature of Erythromelalgia:

===Amputation===
Because of the severity of the pain in erythromelalgia, and the lack of good pain medication then, there have been reports dating back to 1903 of amputation of the affected limb. In 1903 H. Batty Shaw reported that in three cases the pain was so severe, and that the affected extremities so useless, that amputation was performed.

===Differences with Raynaud&#x27;s disease===

Back in 1899 Thomas Barlow had already summarized with great detail the contrast between erythromelalgia and Raynaud&#x27;s disease as following: &quot;Dependence produces considerable increase of the dusky red or violaceous tint of the extremity affected; the arteries in this position of the limb may pulsate forcibly; pain is common, sometimes constant, and more especially when the limb is dependent or parts pressed upon; in wintry weather, or on the application of cold, the conditions are relieved; on the other hand, warmth and summer weather increases pain; there is no loss of sensation, but there may be increased sensitiveness; the local temperature of the affected parts may be raised or lowered; gangrene does not occur; the affection is asymmetrical; there is a certain amount of swelling, sometimes allowing pitting on pressure, sometimes not; incisions over such swelling, even down to the bone, have proved useless; excessive pain on pressure upon the nerves supplying the parts affected is not found; muscular wasting is found, but explainable by the disuse of the limb, and is not at all as severe as in cases of disease of the peripheral nerves; a reaction of degeneration in the nerves of the affected parts has not been found; the deep reflexes, with few exceptions, are not reduced.&quot;

<doc id="853502" wikidata="Q1837807" url="?curid=853502" title="Mayor of Boston">
<text>The mayor of Boston is the head of the municipal government in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. Boston has a mayor–council government. Boston&#x27;s mayoral elections are nonpartisan (as are all municipal elections in Boston), and elect a mayor to a four-year term; there are no term limits. The mayor&#x27;s office is in Boston City Hall, in Government Center.

The current mayor of Boston is Michelle Wu.

==History==
Prior to 1822, there was no Mayor of Boston, because Boston was incorporated as a town. In Massachusetts, a town is typically governed by a town meeting, with a board of selectmen handling regular business. Boston was the first community in Massachusetts to receive a city charter, which was granted in 1822. Under the terms of the new charter, the mayor was elected annually. In June 1895, the charter was amended, and the mayor&#x27;s term was increased to two years.

In 1909, the Republican-controlled state legislature enacted strong-mayor charter changes it hoped would dampen the rising power of Democratic Irish Americans. Adopted by public vote in the November 1909 general election, changes included extending the mayoral term to four years, and making the post formally non-partisan. The reforms did not have the intended effect; the first mayor elected under the new charter was Democrat John F. Fitzgerald (&quot;Honey Fitz&quot;), and every mayor since Republican Malcolm Nichols (1926–1930) has been known to be a Democrat.

In a bid to temper the rising power of James Michael Curley, the state legislature in 1918 passed legislation barring the Mayor of Boston from serving consecutive terms in office; Curley was prevented from running for re-election twice by this law (November 1925 and November 1933). The law was repealed in 1939, after Curley&#x27;s political career appeared to be in decline.

Another charter change was enacted in 1949, partly in response to Curley&#x27;s fourth term (1946–1950), during which he served prison time for crimes committed in an earlier term. Changes included adding a preliminary election to narrow the field to two mayoral candidates in advance of the general election, changing the Boston City Council from having 22 members (one from each city ward) to having nine members (elected at-large), and giving the council ability to override some mayoral vetoes. These changes went into effect in 1951, resulting in the first term of John B. Hynes being shortened to two years.

From 1951 through 1991, Boston mayoral elections were held the year before presidential elections (e.g. mayoral election in 1951, presidential election in 1952). Starting in 1993, due to the election held following Raymond Flynn&#x27;s appointment as United States Ambassador to the Holy See, Boston mayoral elections are held the year following presidential elections (e.g. presidential election in 1992, mayoral election in 1993).

===Salary===
In June 2018, the Council voted to increase the salary of the mayor to $207,000, effective after the mayoral election of November 2021 (term starting in January 2022); this increased the salary of councillors to $103,500, effective after the council elections of November 2019 (terms starting in January 2020). In October 2022, the Council voted to increase the salary of the mayor to $250,000. 

==List==
There is no official count of Boston&#x27;s mayors. The City of Boston does not number its mayors and numbering has been inconsistent over time. For example, Thomas Menino was referred to as the 47th mayor at the time he was sworn in, yet his successor, Marty Walsh, was identified as the 54th. The Walsh administration cited Wikipedia for its use of 54. That numbering scheme counted persons who served as &quot;elected&quot; mayors and counted those who served non-consecutive terms more than once; James Michael Curley served four non-consecutive terms and was counted four times. Kim Janey, who became acting mayor in March 2021, referred to herself as the 55th mayor.

&quot;Use of () in the below table denotes non-consecutive terms for a mayor.&quot;

===Mayors serving non-consecutive terms===

 died in office&lt;br&gt;
 acting mayor only&lt;br&gt;
 Native American Party and American Party were formal names of the &quot;Know Nothing&quot; movement.

===Acting mayors===
Boston&#x27;s city charter stipulates that the City Council President serves as acting mayor whenever the mayor is absent from the city, unable to serve, or the office is vacant. An acting mayor cannot make permanent appointments, and can only perform urgent tasks &quot;not admitting of delay&quot; (which is somewhat open to interpretation).

The following individuals served as acting mayor during a vacancy in the office.

<text>USS &quot;Retaliation&quot; was the French privateer &quot;Croyable&quot;, built in Maryland, that then operated out of Santo Domingo. captured her on 7 July 1798 off New Jersey. She then served in the United States Navy during Quasi-War with France. Two French frigates recaptured her on 20 November 1798. The French Navy took her into service as &quot;Magicienne&quot;. However, captured her on 28 June 1799. She served in the US Navy in the Caribbean briefly, before arriving in Philadelphia in August. She was paid off (decommissioned) there and sold on 29 November.

==Career==
The U.S. warship &quot;Delaware&quot;, commanded by Capt. Stephen Decatur Sr., was able to capture the French privateer, &quot;Croyable&quot;, off Great Egg Harbor Bay, New Jersey, on 7 July 1798. Before her capture, &quot;Croyable&quot; had been preying upon shipping off the Delaware Capes and had taken a British brigantine and a Philadelphia merchantman, &quot;Liberty&quot;. She had also boarded and robbed the coaster &quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot;, whose captain had informed Decatur of &quot;Croyable″&quot;s whereabouts. Decatur brought &quot;Croyable&quot; to Fort Mifflin in the Delaware River. She was the first American capture of the undeclared war.

The U.S. Navy purchased &quot;Croyable&quot; on 30 July 1798, manned her at Philadelphia, renamed her &quot;Retaliation&quot;, and placed her under the command of Lt. William Bainbridge.

&quot;Retaliation&quot; departed Norfolk on 28 October 1798 with and and cruised in the West Indies protecting American commerce during the Quasi-War with France. On 20 November the squadron recaptured merchantman &quot;Fair American&quot;, taken 5 days earlier by a French privateer, but before being able to make their escape with the merchantman a pair of French frigates, &quot;Insurgente&quot; and &quot;Volontaire&quot;, overtook &quot;Retaliation&quot; while her consorts were away on a chase and forced Bainbridge to surrender the hopelessly out-gunned schooner. However, even as a prisoner, Bainbridge managed to save both the &quot;Montezuma&quot; and &quot;Norfolk&quot; by convincing the senior French commander that those American warships were too powerful for his frigates and induced him to abandon their chase.

Renamed &quot;Magicienne&quot; by the French, the schooner again came into American hands on 28 June 1799, when a broadside from USS &quot;Merrimack&quot; forced her to haul down her colors. She performed convoy duty in the Caribbean before returning to Philadelphia in August. Her crew was then discharged and the schooner was sold on 29 November 1799 to Thomas and Peter Mackie.

<doc id="853512" wikidata="Q6148229" url="?curid=853512" title="Liberal League (Japan)">
<text>The Liberal League; Japanese Jiyu Rengo (自由連合); was a liberal party in Japan. It was a minor party which held one seat in the House of Representatives in the Diet at its peak. The League, whose name can also be translated as &quot;Freedom League&quot; or &quot;Libertarian Union&quot; (even though its official English translation is Liberal League), had a liberal and free market political agenda.

The party was formed in 1994 and won a few seats in its first election; however, in the 2003 parliamentary elections, it won only one. It won no seats in the July 2004 Upper House Elections.

On domestic policy, the party supported privatization and smaller government, but also called for increasing the rights of women. It supported the government on most issues, and, despite being critical of Japan&#x27;s close relationship with the United States, was supportive of the war in Iraq. It gained its base mostly from farmers. It supported the government (made up of the Liberal Democratic Party and New Kōmeitō) on most issues unofficially.

On domestic policy, the party was a liberal party.

In the 2005 lower house elections, the Liberal League&#x27;s only sitting member of parliament declined to run for reelection. The party disbanded shortly afterwards.

<doc id="853525" wikidata="Q7308352" url="?curid=853525" title="Regicides Trail">
<text>Regicides Trail is a &quot;Blue-Blazed&quot; hiking trail, about 7 miles (11 km) long, roughly following the edge of a diabase, or traprock, cliff northwest of New Haven, Connecticut. It is named for two regicides, Edward Whalley and his son-in-law William Goffe, who signed the death warrant of King Charles I of England. Upon the restoration of Charles II to the throne and the persecution of the regicides, the pair hid in Judges Cave near the south end of the trail in 1660. The Regicides is widely known to be one of the most technical trails within the CT Blue-Blazed trail system.

==Description==
The trail is a narrow footpath marked with blue blazes, sometimes rocky with difficult footing. It is roughly paralleled by Baldwin Drive, a paved road currently closed to motor vehicles, except for maintenance vehicles, named for New Haven native Simeon E. Baldwin, governor of Connecticut from 1911 to 1915. The trail is within the towns of New Haven, Hamden, Woodbridge, and Bethany, and entirely within West Rock Ridge State Park, but is maintained by a private organization, the Connecticut Forest and Park Association, in conjunction with the West Rock Ridge Park Association. At its southern end, the Regicides Trail terminates at the stone wall near a pavilion at the park&#x27;s South Overlook, which has a panoramic view of South Central, Conn., including Sleeping Giant State Park, East Rock Park, New Haven Harbor, and the Long Island Sound. At its northern end, the Regicides Trail connects with the Quinnipiac Trail. Both trails are part of the state&#x27;s system of &quot;Blue-Blazed Trails&quot; totaling more than .

There are two connecting Blue-Blazed Trails to the Regicides Trail. The Westville Feeder, which starts at a footbridge over the West River off Blake Street in the Westville section of New Haven and extends for 0.7 miles, terminating with a junction at the Regicides Trail, just south of Judges Cave. The trail is blazed Blue-Yellow. The Sanford Feeder follows an abandoned town road, running from Brooks Road in Bethany to its junction with the Regicides Trail near Baldwin Drive. The Sanford Feeder is 0.6 miles and is blazed Blue-Red.

The Regicides Trail also connects to a series of other trails within the park that are not part of the Blue-Blazed system. These trails include the Red Trail that creates a trail loop within the park; the Green Trail, connecting down to the park&#x27;s main entrance on Wintergreen Avenue; the Orange Trail, connecting to the south end of Lake Wintergreen; the Blue-White Trail, connecting to the northern end of Lake Wintergreen; the Purple Trail, connecting to Main Street in Hamden, and the Yellow Trail, connecting to Mountain Road in Hamden. The Regicides Trail has a connection to the Woodbridge trail system via the blue-yellow-blazed North Summit Trail, which intersects the Regicides, just west of Baldwin Drive near a U-shaped overlook. The North Summit Trail extends for 0.8 miles and intersects with the Bishop Estate and Darling House Trails, off Connecticut Route 69 in Woodbridge.

<doc id="853526" wikidata="Q6336974" url="?curid=853526" title="KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas">
<text>Almost Acoustic Christmas is an annual concert run by the Los Angeles radio station KROQ-FM. Like the radio station&#x27;s other festivals (including the Weenie Roast, LA Invasion and Epicenter), it is a festival organized by KROQ-FM to raise money for a charity, and promotes a variety of rock music from the radio station&#x27;s format, including alternative, indie, punk, pop, dance and hard rock/heavy metal. Since its first show in 1989, the Acoustic Christmas has traditionally been held either the second or third weekend of December, with the exception of a three-year hiatus between 2019 and 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Overview==
The festival&#x27;s origins trace back to a December 1989 concert that was called the KROQ Xmas Bash. By the mid-1990s, the festival had become bigger and attracted increasingly popular alternative rock bands and singers. The Almost Acoustic Christmas takes place over a weekend in mid-December, and has in recent years been broadcast for free on KROQ-FM&#x27;s website. The festival started off as a one-day event, and every year between 1992 and 2019 (with the exception of 1999, which was a one-day event), it was held as a two-day festival. Since its return in 2022 after a three-year hiatus, the Almost Acoustic Christmas has been held as a one-day event.

From 1989 through 2012 the show took place at the Universal Amphitheatre in Universal City, except for 1998 where it was held at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, and in 1999 where it was held at the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim. After the Universal Amphitheatre closed in September 2013, the show performed again at the Shrine Auditorium in December 2013. In 2014 the event was moved to Kia Forum (then-The Forum) in Inglewood. In 2019, the show took place at the Honda Center in Anaheim and returned to the Kia Forum in 2022.

KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas concerts benefit Para Los Ninos and the Al Wooten Jr Heritage Center, plus other local charities.

In 1999, a compilation of live recordings, &quot;The Best of KROQ&#x27;s Almost Acoustic Christmas&quot;, was released.

On December 18, 2009, KROQ-FM released a compilation called &quot;KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas 2009&quot;, a benefit album with proceeds benefiting Para Los Ninos and the Al Wooten Heritage Center.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas did not take place in 2020 and 2021.

KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas returned to the Kia Forum on December 10, 2022.

<doc id="853532" wikidata="Q213844" url="?curid=853532" title="Judith Malina">
<text>Judith Malina (June 4, 1926 – April 10, 2015) was a German-born American actress, director and writer. With her husband Julian Beck, Malina co-founded The Living Theatre, a radical political theatre troupe that rose to prominence in New York City and Paris during the 1950s and 1960s.

==Early life and education==
Malina was born in Kiel, Weimar Germany, the daughter of Polish Jewish parents: her mother, Rosel (née Zamora), was a former actress, and her father, Max Malina, a rabbi in the conservative denomination. In 1929, at the age of 3, she immigrated with her parents to New York City.

Malina&#x27;s parents influenced her deeply, leading her to find an interest in political theatre, as her father left Germany with his family, largely due to the rise of antisemitism in the late 1920s, after attempting to warn people of the threat posed by Nazism.

From 1943 until 1945, Malina worked for Valeska Gert at the &quot;Beggar Bar&quot;. There she observed many of Gert&#x27;s performances which influenced her later artistic approach. Interested in acting from an early age, she began attending the New School for Social Research in 1945 to study theatre under Erwin Piscator. Malina was greatly influenced by Piscator&#x27;s philosophy of theatre. Piscator saw theatre as a form of political communication or agitprop (&quot;Theatre interests me only when it is a matter of interest to society.&quot;). Malina, unlike Piscator, was committed to nonviolence and anarchism.

== Career ==

In 1947, Malina and her husband Julian Beck opened The Living Theatre, an experimental theatre company that focused on producing unconventional works by both American and European authors. By 1963, all three of the Living Theatre venues in New York had been shut down by authorities, in one instance by the IRS due to a tax dispute. The organization attributes this to &quot;the difficulty of operating a unique, experimental enterprise within a cultural establishment ill-equipped to accept it&quot;, though the group returned to the United States in 1968. 

Malina appeared occasionally in films, beginning in 1975, when she played Al Pacino&#x27;s mother in &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;. Using her for the role was Pacino&#x27;s idea, said its director Sidney Lumet. Lumet recalled that contacting her was difficult because she had moved to Vermont. &quot;I had no idea of what to expect,&quot; said Lumet. &quot;I didn&#x27;t even know whether she&#x27;d want to do a &#x27;commercial&#x27; film. Well, let me tell you, she is an actress. Totally professional. She also had no money, and we had to pay her fare from Vermont, but she walked in and was perfect.&quot;

She also appeared in Pacino&#x27;s &quot;Looking for Richard&quot;. Malina&#x27;s other roles in cinema include Rose in &quot;Awakenings&quot; (1990) and Granny in &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (1991). She had major roles in &quot;Household Saints&quot; (1993) and the low-budget film &quot;Nothing Really Happens&quot; (2003). She appeared in an episode of the TV series &quot;The Sopranos&quot; in 2006 as a nun, the secret mother of Paulie &quot;Walnuts&quot; Gualtieri. She also has a significant supporting role in the film &quot;Enemies, A Love Story&quot; (1989), based on the novel by Isaac Bashevis Singer. The Living Theatre and its founders were the subject of the 1983 documentary &quot;Signals Through The Flames&quot;.

Malina is the subject of the documentary &quot;Love and Politics&quot; (2012) by Azad Jafarian and took part in Rosa von Praunheim&#x27;s documentary &quot;New York Memories&quot; (2010). Von Praunheim&#x27;s film premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2010 and Jafarian&#x27;s premiered in 2012 at the Tribeca Film Festival.

Theater scholar Richard Schechner said:
==Personal life and death==

Malina met her long-time collaborator and husband Julian Beck in 1943 when she was 17 and he was a student at Yale University. Beck, originally a painter, came to share her interest in political theatre. In 1947, the couple founded The Living Theatre, which they directed together until Beck&#x27;s death in 1985. Beck and Malina had &quot;two offstage children&quot;, Garrick and Isha.

Malina&#x27;s and Beck&#x27;s marriage was non-monogamous. The bisexual Beck had a long-term male partner as did Malina. In 1988, she married her long-term partner Hanon Reznikov. They co-directed the Living Theatre&#x27;s activity in the Middle East, Europe and the United States, until Reznikov&#x27;s unexpected death in 2008.

While not on tour, Malina lived in New York City until she moved to the Lillian Booth Actors Home in Englewood, New Jersey in 2013. Malina died in Englewood, New Jersey, on April 10, 2015.

== Awards and honors ==
In 1996, Malina was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Whittier College. In 2007, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from Lehman College. In 2008 she received the Ordem do Mérito Cultural from the government of Brazil.

<text>415 Records was a San Francisco record label created in 1978. The label focused its efforts on local punk rock and new wave music acts of the late 1970s through the late 1980s, including The Offs, The Nuns, The Units, Romeo Void, and Wire Train. Its name, pronounced four-one-five (not four-fifteen), was a play on both the telephone area code for the San Francisco area and the California penal code section for disturbing the peace (indeed, in some promotional material, the phrase &quot;disturbing the peace&quot; was written underneath the 415 logo). The label had a productive partnership with Columbia Records from 1981 until shortly before it was sold in 1989 to Sandy Pearlman, who retitled the label Popular Metaphysics.

==History==
415 Records was founded in San Francisco in 1978 by entrepreneurs Howie Klein, Chris Knab, and Butch Bridges. Klein was a writer and entertainment promoter, Knab owned an eclectic record store in the Noe Valley section of San Francisco Aquarius Records, and Bridges was a music collector and retailer. Klein and Knab had become friends when Klein did some photography for his friend Harvey Milk, whose camera store was next door to Knab&#x27;s Aquarius Records on Castro Street. They worked together on various radio shows around the Bay Area, including an alternative radio show on KSAN, and they started recording and promoting local musicians out of Knab&#x27;s record store.

Klein ran the label from a tiny office on 16th Street in the Mission, a district of San Francisco, where he kept a pushpin-covered United States map on his wall, bearing a sign that read, &quot;All Bands on Tour All the Time.&quot; Klein used his own late-night weekend radio shows to showcase his artist&#x27;s records and he promoted them all over the country to nightclubs, record stores, and a newly blossoming array of other alternative radio stations. His artists were part of the 1980s San Francisco rock underground, though Klein leaned more toward the accessible, fun, new wave bands than the thrash metal and hard-core punk bands who were also part of that scene. 415 was the first North American record label to focus on punk and new wave music and they featured mostly musicians from the San Francisco region, though the label eventually also included artists from other areas. The British label Stiff Records had done similarly two years earlier; marketing England&#x27;s emergent 1970s pub rock scene as punk and new wave and releasing their first record in August 1976.

415 Records enjoyed early and sustained support from Bill Graham and from David Rubinson, owner of The Automatt recording studio on Folsom Street. Bill Graham managed many top-name acts through his management and promotion agency, Bill Graham Presents, and from the start of the label he booked 415&#x27;s artists as opening acts for major headlining bands to help them gain broader exposure. Queenie Taylor, long an employee of Bill Graham Presents, purchased Butch Bridges&#x27; share of 415 Records in 1979.

Rubinson discounted fees for 415 label bands to record at San Francisco&#x27;s The Automatt studios; sometimes recording them on speculation, such that the studio would share in the profits from those record sales. David Kahne, operating out of a closet-sized office upstairs at The Automatt, worked as 415&#x27;s A&amp;R director, performing artist development and in-house production and engineering there for 415 until 1982, when he left Automatt and went to work in Los Angeles as Vice President of A&amp;R for Columbia Records. Even so, he continued to produce records for artists on the 415 label.

415&#x27;s first release was a 1978 single by The Offs, entitled &quot;Everyone&#x27;s a Bigot&quot;, with &quot;0°&quot; on the B-side (cat#911-39, 1978). Subsequent early releases included 7-inch EPs by SVT (cat#S0005, 1979), The Nuns (cat#SUB01, 1979), and Pearl Harbor and the Explosions &quot;Drivin&#x27;&quot; (uncatalogued, 1979). Later records included a 7-inch by The Mutants (cat#34859, 1980), an album by The Units (cat#A0003, 1980), a 12-inch  rpm album by Romeo Void (cat# 415A-0007, 1981), a mini-album by New Math (cat#A0008, 1981), and various other releases for many other bands.

In 1981, 415 released Romeo Void&#x27;s successful first LP, &quot;It&#x27;s a Condition&quot; and then they built on that success by signing a co-branding contract with Columbia Records that gave Columbia first rights of refusal to produce, manufacture, and promote their artists&#x27; recordings. Many other independent labels would form similar alliances with major labels over the coming decades. 415 retained (nearly) full artistic control over which artists to sign, all recording, and the selection of songs and artwork. Columbia co-branded albums for Romeo Void, Translator, Wire Train, Until December and the Red Rockers under this arrangement; while outside the Columbia deal, Monkey Rhythm, the Pop-O-Pies, and The Uptones all recorded albums that were released and promoted independently by 415 Records. Like many other independent labels, 415 had struggled to reach a national market, but by partnering with Columbia&#x27;s knowledge and its established connections with radio, television, and retailers, they were able to bring their records to a much broader audience.

Following Kahne&#x27;s departure in 1982, local musician and producer Daniel Levitin began working in the A&amp;R department and in 1984, he became Director of A&amp;R, serving as staff engineer and handling in-house production as well as development of new artists. In the early 1980s, Queenie Taylor had begun managing Wolfgang&#x27;s nightclub in San Francisco, and later, in the early 1990s, Slim&#x27;s nightclub, owned by Boz Scaggs. Christopher Knab sold his share of the label in 1985 and he moved to Seattle, Washington to manage the University of Washington&#x27;s alternative radio station KCMU, now KEXP 90.3 fm. Klein joined Sire Records in 1987 and he was named general manager of Reprise Records in 1989.

Five artists that Levitin was supervising at 415 were turned down by Columbia for the 415/Columbia partnership: The Stir-Ups, The Big Race, The Scene, The Afflicted and Rhythm Riot. With Howie&#x27;s blessing, Levitin completed the production for the latter two and sold the distribution rights to a different independent label, San Francisco&#x27;s Infrasonic Records.

In 1989, Howie Klein was named general manager of Reprise Records in Burbank, California and Levitin stayed to help run the label after Klein left. Three months later, Sandy Pearlman and Steve Schenck bought 415. By this time, Al Teller, who had been president of Columbia Records when the 415 partnership began, was now president of MCA Records. Pearlman changed the record label&#x27;s name to Popular Metaphysics and formed a co-branding alliance with MCA, ending the 415 label.

<text>The Meander River is a major perennial river located in the central northern region of Tasmania, Australia. Until the founding of Westbury in the early 1820s, the river was known as The Western River.

==Location and features==
The Meander River rises in the Great Western Tiers and flows past its namesake town, Meander, through the major regional town of Deloraine, then eastward, where it flows into the South Esk River near Hadspen. From source to mouth, the river is joined by fourteen tributaries including the Liffey River and descends over its course.

The damming of the river in 2007 created the artificial reservoir Lake Huntsman. The Meander Hydro Dam provides both electricity and water to the region and is the second dam on the Meander River.

==Recreation==
The Meander is a popular trout fishing stream holding brown trout. The World Fly Fishing Championships organized by the International Confederation of Sport Fishing has selected the Meander as one of its venues for the 2019 championships to be held in Tasmania.

<text>Wang Bingzhang (; born December 30, 1947) is a Chinese human rights activist and founder of two Chinese pro-democracy movements. He was abducted in Vietnam in June 2002 and detained by Chinese secret police. The Chinese government announced his detention in December 2002, charging him with espionage and terrorism. He was sentenced to life in prison and is considered a political prisoner of China.

==Biography==
Wang Bingzhang was born on December 30, 1947, in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China. He graduated from Beijing Medical University and served as a doctor for eight years. In 1979, he was sponsored by the Chinese government to study abroad in McGill University, Canada where he obtained his Ph.D. degree in pathology in 1982. Wang Bingzhang is the first citizen of the People&#x27;s Republic of China to get a doctorate degree in North America.

In 1982, Wang established &quot;China Spring&quot;, the first pro-democracy Chinese magazine overseas. The next year, he launched the (translated variously as &quot;Alliance for Democratic China&quot;/&quot;China Alliance for Democracy&quot;/&quot;Union of Chinese Democracy Movement&quot;), publicly denouncing the one-party rule in China. He later traveled back to China and co-founded two opposition parties, the Chinese Freedom Democracy Party and Chinese Democracy Justice Party in 1989 and 1998, respectively. The latter led to his arrest in China. He was expelled from the country, but was not sentenced.

In June 2002, Wang went to Vietnam with Yue Wu and Zhang Qi where they were captured. In December 2002, the Chinese government announced his arrest after six months in custody.

In March 2006, Wang was punished for misbehaving when he went on hunger strike to plead for release to pay a final respect to his father at his funeral; but he was handcuffed by and locked with a jail guard in his jail cell. This resulted in prolonged punishment. Visitation rights were restored in November 2006. According to Dr. Bing Wu Wang, Wang&#x27;s younger brother, his physical health had deteriorated rapidly since the last visitation. This was due, according to Wang, to a new prison warden who served much lower food quality, harsher physical abuse and intense political study sessions.

Various international organizations, including the United Nations, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Worldrights, and the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights have voiced their opposition to Dr. Wang&#x27;s imprisonment, saying China is arbitrarily detaining him. The United States and Canadian legislatures have both passed legislative bills in support of Wang and in denunciation of the CCP&#x27;s actions. Freedom House awarded Dr Wang the 2024 Freedom Award.

<text>Absaroka was a proposed state in the United States that would have comprised parts of the states of Montana, South Dakota, and Wyoming, which contemplated secession in 1939. The movement began in 1935, during the Great Depression, as a form of protest against their respective state governments, who were criticized for failing to provide New Deal federal aid to rural ranchers and farmers. 

A. R. Swickard, a local street commissioner, served as a leader of the movement and later declared himself governor. Swickard hosted a series of public hearings regarding grievances levied against the Montana, South Dakota, and Wyoming state governments, receiving substantial media coverage and prompting the respective governments to act. This led to broader distribution of federal aid to rural regions, resulting in the secessionist movement dying out by the start of World War II. It has been debated whether the movement was a serious attempt to form a new state.

== Background ==

In 1933, the New Deal was signed into law during the Franklin D. Roosevelt presidency. This legislation was designed to alleviate the economic downturn resultant from the Great Depression. This legislation was generally considered favorable amongst the citizens of southern Wyoming, resulting in Joseph C. O&#x27;Mahoney and other Democrats winning elections in the State and Federal elections, ultimately resulting in Wyoming&#x27;s legislature being controlled by the Democratic Party. Residents of rural Northern Wyoming, as well as Southern Montana and Western South Dakota, felt discontent with the lack of federal aid they were receiving, believing that the more urban parts of their respective states were being prioritized by the New Deal.

== History ==

=== Formation (1935–1938) ===

While the exact date of origin for the Absaroka movement is not known, individuals formally began organizing behind it in 1935. This began following a series of chamber of commerce hearings in which, primarily, ranchers and independent farmers in rural parts of northern Wyoming, southern Montana, and western South Dakota levied their complainants with the state and organized a secessionist movement. In these meetings, complainants from Wyoming would claim &quot;All of the state money and attention goes to the southern part of the state&quot;, and they felt &quot;short-changed&quot; by their respective state governments. This sentiment was reflected further in local papers, including &quot;Queen City Mail&quot; in South Dakota, which stated in an editorial:

Residents of Wyoming were particularly upset by the Democratic control of the state legislature, believing that their needs were being ignored, and the state was too focused on the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad. This discontent led to rural farmers, primarily Republican-leaning regions, calling for secession from Wyoming. The initial movement began as a petition for Sheridan County, Wyoming to secede and join Montana, and was filed by A. R. Swickard, the street commissioner of Sheridan, Wyoming. The movement quickly changed to petition the formation of a new state. The Absaroka movement also began directly following another secession movement that sought to have a portion of the Black Hills secede from South Dakota and join Wyoming. Indeed, historian Watson Parker has linked the Absaroka movement, in terms of economic and geographic identity, back to an 1870s attempt to form a Black Hills-based territory out of three adjacent existing territories.

The name &quot;Absaroka&quot; is derived from the Hidatsa name for the Crow people, meaning &quot;children of the large-beaked bird&quot; and shares a similar name to the nearby Absaroka Range.

=== Height and dissolution (1939) ===
In 1939, supporters for the movement crowned Dorothy Fellows as Miss Absaroka, emulating the Miss America beauty pageant, wherein a winner is declared from each state as part of a larger national competition. Images of Miss Absaroka, alongside state automobile license plates and state coins for Absaroka, were issued soon after. A prominent supporter of the movement was C. M. Rowe, a professor at the South Dakota School of Mines. That same year, the King of Norway toured southeast Montana and Wyoming, and supporters of the secessionist movement claimed this event as official recognition of the new state. Swickard also met with the Governor of Wyoming, Nels H. Smith, on May 12, 1939, to discuss the formation of a new state. Swickard said after leaving the meeting:

Around this time, Samuel W. King, a congressional representative for the Hawaii territory, stated during a session of Congress, &quot;Hawaii is entitled by prior claim to be the 49th state. Let Absaroka be the 50th but Hawaii has claim to the 49th!&quot; Following the Miss Absaroka pageant, A. R. Swickard appointed himself &quot;governor&quot; and held a series of grievance hearings covering the perceived wrongs committed by the state of Wyoming. 

A. R. Swickard also criticized the now Republican-led Wyoming state government, which took office following the 1938 Wyoming state elections, for not providing his movement with what the Associated Press called political patronage jobs. These hearings led to increased media attention on the secessionist movement and its criticisms of the state government, prompting Wyoming, South Dakota, and Montana to spread state revenues more broadly to rural communities. This effort, ultimately, rendered the secessionist movement largely defunct by the end of 1939. The secessionists&#x27; activities ceased entirely following the onset of World War II and were largely considered forgotten by the time of the Eisenhower presidency.

== Geography and attractions ==
Swickard, alongside his supporters, drew the initial borders for the state in the basement of the Sheridan Rotary Club, which became the de facto headquarters for the movement. The boundaries of the proposed state changed a number of times, and at one point contained 10 Wyoming counties, 4 Montana counties, and 12 South Dakota counties. This proposed state is estimated to have included approximately half of Wyoming&#x27;s territory. The state&#x27;s territory would have featured a coal-rich landscape with a large number of pre-established mines, including The Black Thunder, Coal Creek, and Cordero Rojo mines. 

Increasing tourism to the region was another motivation for the proposed state because Mount Rushmore (constructed 1927–1941) would be within Absaroka according to some plans. Additionally, that region would have contained the Black Hills, Devils Tower, the Bighorn Mountains, the Teton Mountains, and Yellowstone National Park. This resulted in residents of the proposed state calling Absaroka the &quot;Nation&#x27;s Playground&quot;.

== Reception and legacy ==
The secessionist movement never achieved widespread popularity, nor pursued legal means of secession. In a 1941 publication by the Federal Writers&#x27; Project, the story of Absaroka was published as an example of Western eccentricity. The formation of Absaroka has been assessed to have been only &quot;half serious&quot; and some historians have argued that the attempt to secede was a tall tale. Another historian has stated that the movement fell &quot;into oblivion after having provided a modicum of excitement and entertainment for its participants.&quot; Contemporary coverage of the event is likewise uncertain if the secession movement was meant to be serious or started as a joke, and the press compared it to the similar Texlahoma secession movement. It has also been proposed that the movement was a &quot;fun way for cowboys to distract themselves during tough economic times&quot;. In an interview with Helen Graham, a librarian at the Sheridan Public Library and a resident of Sheridan during the 1930s, she claimed that the movement was not widely known, nor perceived to be serious. Regarding the Absaroka movement, U.S. Senator Alan Simpson stated in a 2008 interview that he had an uncle who participated in the movement. Senator Simpson went on to recount, &quot;They&#x27;re weren&#x27;t fooling around; a lot of people thought it was silliness, but to them, it wasn&#x27;t.&quot;

It has been proposed by Kirk Johnson, an expert on the American West, that the effort to secede was largely brought about by cultural and geographical differences. The region Absaroka would have occupied was settled later than most regions of the United States. Due to the American Indian Wars, the region was not safely settled till the late 1800s to early 1900s, resulting in &quot;frontier spirit of experimentation still (being) fresh&quot; during the 1930s.

The series &quot;Walt Longmire Mysteries&quot;, written by Craig Johnson, takes place in the fictional Absaroka county of Wyoming. This county was created as a reference to the Absaroka secession movement, with Johnson claiming the name choice was to &quot;make this place emblematic of the rural West and maybe of rural areas all over the world.&quot; This same county was later featured in the A&amp;E and Netflix television adaptation &quot;Longmire.&quot;

<doc id="853556" wikidata="Q2814776" url="?curid=853556" title="20th hijacker">
<text>The 20th hijacker is a possible additional terrorist in the September 11 attacks of 2001 who, for unknown reasons, was unable to participate. The 20th hijacker, though not present during the actual attacks, is said to have been deeply involved in the preparations. There were many variations of the 9/11 plot, with the number of terrorists fluctuating with available resources and changing circumstances. In the end, there were 19 hijackers: three of the planes were taken over by five members each and the fourth was hijacked by four people. The latter plane, United Airlines Flight 93, crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, due to the resistance from passengers before it could reach its target in Washington, D.C.

==Hijackers==
Ramzi bin al-Shibh allegedly meant to take part in the attacks and may have been the intended hijacker-pilot of American Airlines Flight 77, but he was repeatedly denied a visa for entry into the US. His role as one of the four hijacker-pilots preceded Hani Hanjour.

Zacarias Moussaoui, a French citizen of Moroccan origin, has widely been referred to as the 20th hijacker. Moussaoui may have been considered as a replacement for Ziad Jarrah, who at one point threatened to withdraw from the scheme because of tensions amongst the plotters. Plans to include Moussaoui were never finalized, as the al-Qaeda hierarchy had doubts about his reliability. Ultimately, Moussaoui did not play a role in the hijacking scheme. He was arrested about four weeks before the attacks. Moussaoui is now serving a life sentence for his involvement in the 9/11 attacks. He pleaded guilty in 2005 to collaborating with the other hijackers.

Mohammed al-Qahtani, a Saudi Arabian citizen, is often referred to as the 20th hijacker. It&#x27;s believed that he was sent to the U.S. to replace Moussaoui&#x27;s role in the attacks after Moussaoui&#x27;s arrest. José Meléndez-Pérez, a U.S. Immigration inspector at Orlando International Airport, refused his entry into the U.S. in August 2001. He was later captured in Afghanistan and imprisoned at the U.S. military prison known as Camp X-Ray at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In January 2009, Susan J. Crawford asserted that Qahtani&#x27;s interrogation at Camp X-Ray amounted to torture.

According to the BBC, Fawaz al-Nashimi claimed to have been the &quot;20th hijacker&quot;. An al-Qaeda video has been released from a US intelligence organization, showing al-Nashimi justifying attacks on the west. The U.S dismissed al-Nashimi&#x27;s claims as propaganda. He was also known as Turki bin Fuheid al-Muteiry and took part in a May 29, 2004, attack on oil facilities in Khobar, Saudi Arabia. He was killed in a June 2004 shootout with Saudi Arabian security forces.

The other al-Qaeda members who allegedly attempted, but were not able, to take part in the attacks were Saeed al-Ghamdi (not to be confused with the successful hijacker of the same name), Tawfiq bin Attash, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, Mushabib al-Hamlan, Abderraouf Jdey, Zakariya Essabar, Khalid Saeed Ahmad al-Zahrani, Ali Abd al-Rahman al-Faqasi al-Ghamdi, Saeed al-Baluchi, Qutaybah al-Najdi, Zuhair al-Thubaiti, and Saud al-Rashi. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the attack&#x27;s alleged mastermind, had wanted to remove at least one member – Khalid al-Mihdhar – from the operation, but he was overruled by Osama bin Laden.

==In popular culture==
The Saudi Arabian novelist Abdullah Thabit wrote a 2006 novel titled &quot;Terrorist Number 20&quot; that became a bestseller. The book recalls his teenage years as a religious extremist and was inspired in part by Ahmed al-Nami, one of the 9/11 hijackers and a fellow resident of Abha who was vaguely familiar to Thabit. In April 2006, three months after the release of the book, Thabit was forced to move from Abha to Jeddah with his family after receiving death threats.

<text>Russell Lee Arms (February 3, 1920 – February 13, 2012) was an American actor and singer.

==Career==
Arms was born on February 3, 1920 in Berkeley, California, gaining acting experience via the Pasadena Playhouse. He began his career on radio, including working at WNEW in New York City.

He moved up to minor screen roles during World War II as a contract player with Warner Bros. In his screen debut, he played Richard, the son of the Stanleys, in 1942&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot;. He later worked as a freelance performer, mostly in Westerns. Subsequently, he appeared in supporting roles in both feature films and television. In 1953 he played the role of Chester Finley, a piano instructor and hopeful suitor to Doris Day, in the film &quot;By the Light of the Silvery Moon&quot;.

From 1952 to 1957, he was best known as a vocalist on &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;, an NBC television series that reviewed the popular songs of the day and on which a regular cast of vocalists would perform the top seven songs of the week. Arms and Eileen Wilson (who starred on the show from 1950 to 1952) were the only surviving lead performers from the show until Arms&#x27; death in 2012. He authored an autobiography in 2005, &quot;My Hit Parade... and a Few Misses&quot;. During his career as a singer, he was also well known for his 1957 hit single, &quot;Cinco Robles (Five Oaks)&quot;, which entered the charts on January 12, 1957 and stayed there for 15 weeks, peaking at No. 22. In 1957, he released the album &quot;Where Can A Wanderer Go&quot;, on the Era label. The same year he was a singer on &quot;The Hidden Treasure Show&quot;, &quot;the first nationwide quiz show in which home viewers win the money...&quot;. The syndicated program was sponsored by Disabled American Veterans.

On television dramas, Arms made three guest appearances on &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, including the role of Attorney Everett Dorrell in the 1960 episode &quot;The Case of the Credulous Quarry&quot;, and as Roger Correll in the 1963 episode &quot;The Case of the Greek Goddess&quot;. Additionally, he appeared in the 1961 episode &quot;Bad Sheriff&quot; on the long-running series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, portraying a crooked lawman who tries to keep the money seized by stagecoach robbers. For the next two decades he continued to act periodically in other television series, including the CBS sitcom &quot;Ichabod and Me&quot; in 1962 and the NBC drama &quot;Gibbsville&quot; in 1976.

A 1958 newspaper story about Arms noted, &quot;Although Arms started in show business as an actor, he became a singer &#x27;by accident,&#x27; and now he can&#x27;t get anyone to believe he can act. &#x27;I&#x27;m now in the process of proving them wrong,&#x27; he said.&quot;

==Personal life==
Arms and his second wife, Mary Lynne, resided in Palm Springs, California for many years. They then moved to Hamilton, Illinois, where Arms died on February 13, 2012, aged 92.

<text>The Doomben railway line is a railway line in the City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It is the part of the Pinkenba railway line that still operates a regular passenger service. &quot;Doomben&quot;, or &quot;dumben&quot;, is the Indigenous Yuggera name for a tree fern which was prolific in the area. The railway line branches from the North Coast line at Eagle Junction, extending to the industrial suburb of Pinkenba, situated on the northern bank at the mouth of the Brisbane River. It is part of the Queensland Rail Citytrain network.

==History==
The initial section of the line opened on 3 September 1882 to Ascot (then named Racecourse) to serve the Eagle Farm racecourse, though nearby residents successfully lobbied for a regular passenger service. The line was extended to Pinkenba railway station in 1897, mainly to serve an industrial area, including wharves on the north side of the Brisbane River. The passenger service was timed to coincide with the starting and finishing times of the workers.

During World War I and World War II, with deep berthing available to ships at Pinkenba on the mouth of the Brisbane River, troops camped in the Pinkenba and Meeandah localities. Passenger ships used the Pinkenba Wharf, and special trains ran from Brisbane to Pinkenba.

Earthworks were undertaken to duplicate the line in the 1950s, hence the double sided, island platform at Clayfield. including regrading the line which eliminated the Sandgate Rd level crossing, but the program was abandoned before the second track was laid.

The line was electrified in 1988, but only to Eagle Farm, the next station after current suburban terminus Doomben; only diesel-hauled services could travel the full length of the line, and those were infrequent. All passenger services on the line were suspended in September 1993 as part of a statewide rationalisation of the rail network with the closing or suspending of under-utilised or unprofitable rail lines. Only a few special services were run on the line on days of major race events at adjoining race tracks.

Electric passenger services resumed on 27 January 1998, but only as far as Doomben, with bus connections to the stations beyond Doomben.

The Doomben to Pinkenba section is used only for freight and occasional special trains, such as heritage services described below.

===Heritage services===
QR occasionally run special steam trains on the entire Pinkenba line as part of their semi-regular &quot;Steam Train Sunday&quot; excursion service. This is the only way to travel on the full length of the line.

==Line guide and services==
All services stop at all stations to Roma Street railway station. The typical travel time between Doomben and Brisbane City is approximately 18 minutes (to Central).

Doomben line services typically terminate at Roma Street or Park Road, while some peak services continue to Kuraby or Cleveland. No rail services operate on Sundays or public holidays.

Passengers for/from the Airport, Caboolture, Nambour and Gympie North, Redcliffe Peninsula and Shorncliffe lines change at Eagle Junction, Ferny Grove at Bowen Hills, and all other lines at Roma Street.

<doc id="853576" wikidata="Q1631191" url="?curid=853576" title="Marriott World Trade Center">
<text>The New York Marriott World Trade Center, also known as 3 World Trade Center (3 WTC), was a 22-story, 825-room hotel in New York City, within the original World Trade Center complex in downtown Manhattan. It opened in April 1981 as the Vista International Hotel, the first major hotel since 1836 to open in Manhattan south of Canal Street.

The hotel was damaged in the World Trade Center bombing by al-Qaeda terrorists on February 26, 1993. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey considered demolishing the building, but instead decided to repair it. The building&#x27;s structure was reinforced, and it re-opened in November 1994. In November 1995, it was bought by Marriott Corporation and renamed the New York Marriott World Trade Center. 

In 2001, as part of the September 11 attacks by al-Qaeda, the hotel was mostly destroyed by the collapse of the World Trade Center&#x27;s Twin Towers (1 and 2 WTC), after two planes were crashed into them. 43 people inside the hotel died: 41 firefighters and two guests. Only the southern end of the building was spared, and it was eventually demolished to make way for reconstruction. The hotel was not replaced as part of the post-2001 World Trade Center complex, although its address (3 WTC) was reused for the tower at 175 Greenwich Street.

== Description ==
It was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill in 1978–79. The building was a 22-story steel-framed structure with 825 rooms and six basement levels (labeled B1 through B6). The hotel was connected to the North Tower via an underground entrance at concourse level, and a small pedestrian walkway that extended from the west promenade of the Marriott to the North Tower on plaza level.

The hotel also had of meeting space on the entire third floor. It was considered a four-diamond hotel by the American Automobile Association (AAA). It was meant for business travelers, who were offered translators and a reference library of 28 foreign-language dictionaries. The staff was also multilingual. The lobby was split between two levels, and was themed around the sea, featuring a golden sculpture of sails. On the 22nd floor, there was a gym that was the largest of any hotel in New York City at the time, with a swimming pool and a running track with views of the Hudson River and the Austin J. Tobin Plaza.

The pool was put near the top so the hotel could be flooded if a fire occurred. The hotel featured two restaurants: The Tall Ships Bar and Grill, located at street-level, and the Greenhouse Café, a restaurant on the plaza level that featured a large skylight looking up at the North and South Tower. Previously, another restaurant had operated called The American Harvest; however, it was removed following the bombing in 1993 and was renovated and remained as a rentable space called the Harvest Room.

== History ==
The hotel was first known as the Vista International Hotel, but also became known as World Trade Center 3 (WTC 3 or 3 WTC), the World Trade Center Hotel, the Vista Hotel, and the Marriott Hotel. The building was designed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill with construction beginning in March 1979. It opened on April 1, 1981, with 100 of 825 rooms available, and it was completed in July 1981. The construction cost $70 million. It was planned and managed by Hilton International, but they could not use the Hilton name for the hotel because of an agreement with Hilton Hotels to not use the name in the U.S. The Vista was the first major hotel to open in Lower Manhattan south of Canal Street since 1836. Shortly before the opening day of the hotel, a fire broke out on the 7th floor.

The Vista was first under lease to WTC Hotel Associates of Chicago. Kuo Hotel Corporation, based in Hong Kong, bought the hotel&#x27;s leasehold in 1982. The hotel was successful, creating a nightlife culture in the area and spurring development of more hotels in Lower Manhattan. In 1989, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey bought the leasehold from Kuo for $78 million, but the operating rights remained in the hands of Hilton International as management agent.

=== 1993 World Trade Center bombing ===
On February 26, 1993, the hotel was seriously damaged as a result of the World Trade Center bombing. Terrorists affiliated with al-Qaeda took a Ryder truck loaded with 1,500 pounds (682 kilograms) of explosives and parked it in the North Tower parking garage below the hotel&#x27;s ballroom. They likely viewed this as the area where an explosion would cause the most structural damage. At 12:18 p.m. (EDT), the explosion destroyed or seriously damaged the lower- and sub-levels of the World Trade Center complex. The Marriott Financial Center, a hotel located two blocks west, served as press conference area and a command post for the law enforcement response.

The city&#x27;s Port Authority considered demolishing the building for some time. The building was instead closed for 18 months while they worked on extensive repairs. Reinforcements to the hotel&#x27;s structure, including the installation of &quot;the largest steel beam ever put in a building to that point&quot;. The hotel reopened on November 1, 1994. On November 9, 1995, the hotel was sold to Host Marriott Corporation for $141.5 million. It was renamed to the New York Marriott World Trade Center. The new company managing the hotel started operations in January 1996. Security was increased at the hotel, but they were ineffective in the face of the attacks in September 2001. In January 2001, 77 New York Police Department (NYPD) police cadets graduated in a ceremony held at the hotel.

=== September 11 attacks ===

On September 11, 2001, al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four planes to crash into various targets in the U.S. Two crashed into both of the World Trade Center&#x27;s Twin Towers, which were located right next to the hotel. 43 people in the hotel died from the attacks, out of the roughly 2,753 people who died in New York City from the attacks. 41 firefighters died, along with two hotel employees who assisted them with evacuating guests. 11 guests were never identified, and it is not known if they died in the building or elsewhere in the World Trade Center complex. &quot;LDS Living&quot; claimed &quot;most likely they were in the main towers attending business meetings or shopping.&quot; 14 people survived both collapses from inside the building.

On the 11th, the hotel had 940 registered guests. The National Association for Business Economics (NABE) was holding its yearly conference at the hotel from September 8 to 11, 2001. In addition, the hotel was planned to host the Law School Admission Council&#x27;s New York City Law School Forum—a law school recruiting event—on September 14 and 15. The council was expecting 4,000 students to attend, from 160 schools. About 11 people who were planning to go to the forum were scheduled to check in to the hotel on September 11, but did not make it there before the attacks started.

==== Crashes into the Twin Towers ====
When American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the North Tower (1 WTC) at 8:46 a.m. EDT, its landing gear fell and crashed through the roof into an office next to the 22nd-floor pool, breaking the glass above the restaurant and forcing people to duck under furniture. The whole building shook, and parts of it caught on fire. Alarms went off throughout the building, and its phones and elevators shut down. The freight elevator still worked, however. Security guards escorted out the group attending the NABE conference. The hotel&#x27;s intercom told guests to be calm and stay in their rooms.

Firefighters reported human remains and corpses on the roof, from people who fell or jumped from the south face of the North Tower. At least ten firefighter companies used the lobby as a staging area; it is possible that many or all of the companies were not sent there, but instead got lost amidst the evacuation of the towers.

United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the South Tower (2 WTC) at 9:03 a.m. Some fire companies evacuated guests that were on the upper floors, being followed by elevator mechanic Robert Graff and two employees with master keys: Joseph Keller, the hotel&#x27;s executive housekeeper, and Abdul Malahi, an audiovisual technician assisting with the law school forum who was the only civilian Arab that died on 9/11. The evacuation effort was led by Keller, Richard Fetter (the hotel&#x27;s resident manager), and Nancy Castillo (human resources head at Marriot World Trade Center and Marriott Financial Center). Fetter attempted to get a new version of the hotel registry, but their computer system had shut down, so he found the most recently-printed copy and a set of emergency phone numbers.

People who were escaping the tower crashes, especially the North Tower, also stopped at the hotel; these people numbered at a thousand or more. This is in part due to a door at the north face of the building, facing the North Tower. The people in the lobby moved away from the North Tower, walking south through the hotel, until they reached the Tall Ships Bar and Grill, which opened onto Liberty Street. A police officer stood at the exit, stopping civilians from crossing the street whenever debris was falling.
==== Collapse of the Twin Towers ====
The collapse of the South Tower at 9:59 a.m. crushed the middle of the building, creating a large gap that nearly split the hotel in half. The lobby was filled with debris, but nonetheless acted as a shield for firemen, police, and hotel staff, due to its reinforcements after the bombing. Abdul Malahi was killed. Before the collapse, there were seven firemen from Engine Company No. 74 in the middle of the hotel on the 21st floor, four of whom died. Around 17 people in the evacuation effort were still alive on the 3rd and 4th floors; three firefighters on these floors went upstairs to find a fireman who was radioing a mayday signal, Michael Brennan. On the half of the building that was nearer the South Tower, three civilians and two firemen trapped on the 3rd floor escaped to a reception room on the 2nd floor by crawling through an opening in a wall on an I-beam, which probably fell from the tower. In the lobby, firefighters began exiting the building to get reinforcements. Joseph Keller and Fire Lieutenant Bob Nagel were trapped by debris, and the other firefighters began trying to cut away the debris around them using saws. While this happened, the North Tower collapsed.
The collapse of the North Tower at 10:28 destroyed the rest of the hotel, aside from a small section surrounding the southern stairwell. This section would have collapsed if not for the reinforcements made after the 1993 bombing. There were 14 survivors trapped in this section, on the 2nd floor; this included 13 firemen from Company 74 and hotel guest Frank Razzano, who had evacuated from his 19th-floor room. The group found a hole in the building, and threaded either a rug or drape through it, then climbed down onto a pile of debris. Keller and the three firefighters who went to rescue Michael Brennan died from the second collapse. Six men from the Brooklyn Heights Ladder 118 fire company (including Scott Davidson, father of celebrity Pete Davidson) died from the collapse, after saving around 900 people. All the firemen still in the lobby escaped, and Richard Fetter survived.

=== After destruction ===

Bill Marriott, the businessman who owned the hotel, delivered a speech to his employees on the 20th, where he thanked them for their work on the 11th, and announced they would be employed until at least October 5, and covered by the hotel&#x27;s health insurance for a year. The guests staying at the Marriott World Trade Center and the Marriott Financial Center, which was also damaged during the attacks, were sent to seven other Marriott hotels in the city. At those locations, security was increased and cancellation fees were waived.

In January 2002, the remnants of the hotel were dismantled to make way for reconstruction. The Marriott Corporation was then offered an opportunity to rebuild the hotel in the same location within the World Trade Center site, as its lease which was signed until 2094 had not expired. Marriott declined the offer, and in October 2003, the Port Authority voted on an agreement under which the Host Marriott Corporation would &quot;surrender the premises&quot;, resulting in termination of the lease and thus giving the land to the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum. Marriott thus did not have to fulfill its obligation to rebuild the hotel.

In August 2002, the FBI found, within their records, what is currently the only known audio recording containing both World Trade Center plane crashes in a continuous or uninterrupted audiotape. The recording is of a conversation between two men at the hotel&#x27;s outdoor cafe. One was a tax assessor for the city government who was being investigated by the FBI for allegedly taking bribes, and the other was tax consultant Stephen McArdle, who was cooperating with the investigation; Ardle was wearing a hidden wiretap recording the conversation to the audiotape, which two FBI agents were listening in on. The men on the tape and the FBI agents all survived the attacks.

==== Memorials and legacy ====
On the afternoon of the attacks, at the World Trade Center&#x27;s ruins (later nicknamed &quot;Ground Zero&quot;), photographer Thomas E. Franklin captured the now-iconic image &quot;Raising the Flag at Ground Zero&quot;. It depicts firefighters raising the American flag upon a flagpole found within the rubble; the flagpole was likely present at the Marriott. A flag displaying the Marriott company logo was found at Ground Zero in December 2001, and was displayed in a glass case at the site over the next few months. The case honored the hotel&#x27;s employees with the plaque: &quot;Our Spirit to Serve From sacrifice ... honor From adversity ... resolve From grief ... remembrance&quot;. The flag was eventually received by the 9/11 Memorial &amp; Museum.

The Ladder 118 firetruck was recovered from Ground Zero within days of the attack, and their tools were recovered two months later. A photo of the firetruck, crossing the Brooklyn Bridge to get to the World Trade Center after the second plane crash, became an iconic image of 9/11. It was taken by Aaron McLamb from his 10th-floor workplace in Brooklyn, who brought the photo to the firehouse a week later. It was then published on the front page of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; for October 15, 2001. Pete Davidson loosely based the 2020 film he starred in, &quot;The King of Staten Island&quot;, on his father&#x27;s service on 9/11.

The hotel, and those who survived the 9/11 attacks within it, were featured in the documentary film &quot;Hotel Ground Zero&quot;, which premiered on September 11, 2009, on the History Channel. Some survivors only found out after watching the documentary that others they had met during the attacks were still alive. The survivors have reunited near or at the hotel site multiple times. As of 2011, there was a &quot;Marriott Hotel 9/11 memorial group&quot; that helped survivors get in contact with each other. In 2013, there was charity run in the area to honor Ruben Correa, a firefighter who died as a part of the group on the 21st floor.

<doc id="853585" wikidata="Q147274" url="?curid=853585" title="2062 Aten">
<text>2062 Aten , provisional designation , is a stony sub-kilometer asteroid and namesake of the Aten asteroids, a subgroup of near-Earth objects. The asteroid was named after Aten from Egyptian mythology.

It was discovered on 7 January 1976, at the Palomar Observatory by American astronomer Eleanor Helin, who was the principal scientist for the NEAT project until her retirement in 2002. The S-type asteroid measures approximately 900 meters in diameter, has a longer-than average rotation period of 44.77 hours, and approaches the orbit Earth to 44.1 lunar distances.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Aten&quot; orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.8–1.1 AU once every 11 months (347 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.18 and an inclination of 19° with respect to the ecliptic. A first precovery was taken at the discovering observatory in December 1955, extending the body&#x27;s observation arc by more than 20 years prior to its official discovery observation.

=== Namesake of the Aten group ===

&quot;Aten&quot; was the first asteroid found to have a semi-major orbital axis of less than one astronomical unit and a period of less than one year. A new category of asteroids was thus created, the Atens. As of 2017, the group consists of more than 1,200 numbered members. Other groups of near-Earth objects (NEOs) are the Apollo and Amor asteroids, which are both significantly larger than the Atens, while the Atira asteroids form the smallest NEO-group by far.

=== Close approaches ===

The asteroid has an Earth minimum orbit intersection distance of which corresponds to 44.1 lunar distances.

== Physical characteristics ==

In the Tholen classification, &quot;Aten&quot; is a common S-type asteroid. In the SMASS taxonomy it is classified as an Sr-type, a subtype which transitions to the R-type asteroids.

=== Lightcurve ===

In the 1990s, Italian astronomer Stefano Mottola obtained a rotational lightcurve of &quot;Aten&quot; during the EUNEASO survey at La Silla, which was a European near-Earth object search and follow-up observation program to determine additional physical parameters. Lightcurve analysis gave a longer-than average rotation period of 40.77 hours with a brightness variation of 0.26 magnitude (). No additional lightcurves have been obtained since.

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the survey carried out by NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, &quot;Aten&quot; measures between 700 and 830 meters in diameter and its surface has a high albedo between 0.39 and 0.52.

in 1994, Tom Gehrels published a diameter of 1.1 kilometers and an albedo of 0.26 in his book &quot;Hazards Due to Comets and Asteroids&quot;. The Warm Spitzer NEO survey (&quot;ExploreNEOs&quot;) gives a diameter of 1.3 kilometers with an albedo of 0.20.

The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; agrees with a revised thermal model for asteroid diameters and albedos, and adopts an albedo of 0.28 with a diameter of 0.91 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 17.2. However, the Minor Planet Center (MPC) classifies &quot;Aten&quot; as a larger &quot;1+ KM&quot; object.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named from Egyptian mythology after Aten, the ancient Egyptian god of the solar disk, originally an aspect of the god Ra. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 August 1978 ().

<text>Mabou Mines is an experimental theatre company founded in 1970 and based in New York City.

==Founding and history==
Mabou Mines was founded by David Warrilow, Lee Breuer, Ruth Maleczech, JoAnne Akalaitis, and Philip Glass, at the house of Akalaitis and Glass near Mabou Mines, Nova Scotia. In 2020, the company announced Carl Hancock Rux and Mallory Catlett as its new co-Artistic Directors.

The company began as a resident company at Ellen Stewart&#x27;s La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in the East Village.

In 1986, the company won an Obie Award for Sustained Excellence for its theatrical contributions to the Off-Broadway community.

As the company stated in a 1990 press kit, &quot;The artistic purpose of Mabou Mines has been and remains the creation of new theatre pieces from original texts and the theatrical use of existing texts staged from a specific point of view. Each member is encouraged to pursue his or her artistic vision by initiating and collaborating on a wide range of projects of varying styles, developing them from initial concept to final performance. This process is intense and often lengthy. While the director of a Mabou Mines work is responsible for its concept and its basic structure, the ultimate production reflects the concerns and the artistic input of all its collaborators.&quot;

In 2005, Mabou Mines was among 406 New York City arts and social service organizations to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.

The company also runs a Resident Artist Program, which has included award-winning artists Lynn Nottage, Carl Hancock Rux, and Basil Twist. In 2020, Rux and his co-artistic directors formed a new arts residency program called &quot;Suite Space&quot;, dedicated to developing the work of multidisciplinary artists of color. The program convenes annually and has included the works of composer Tamar-Kali, choreographer Edisa Weeks, musicians Mary Prescott, Tariq Al-Sabir, and Marcelle Lashley, among others. The company&#x27;s associate artist-in-residence program includes Carrie Mae Weems, Nona Hendryx, Dianne Smith, Basil Twist and several others.

<text>Theodoric was an antipope in 1100 and 1101, in the schism that began with Wibert of Ravenna in 1080, in opposition to the excesses of Pope Gregory VII and in support of the Emperor Henry IV.

== Biography ==
The earliest record of Theodoric is his signature on a document of the antipope Clement III (Wibert) dated 4 November 1084, where he signs as cardinal deacon of S. Maria in Via Lata. In a letter of 29 July 1099, Clement III refers to Theoderic as one of those cardinals who anathematized Gregory VII (who died on 25 May 1085) as a heretic and simoniac.

In 1098, Cardinal Theodoric became involved in German affairs, as papal legate of Clement III. Archbishop Rothardus of Mainz had not only refused to accept the legitimacy of antipope Clement III, but was working against the Emperor Henry and his antipope by rallying the bishops of Germany to meet in a synod in Mainz on 1 December 1097. Clement had tried several times to bring the archbishop under control. First, he had Rothardus summoned to the papal court to answer charges of simony; when he refused to appear, Theodoric and another bishop summoned him; finally the Deacon Hugo also summoned him. Having failed to appear, on 29 July 1099 the people of Mainz were released from their obedience to Rothardus and warned of the interdict that would be inflicted on any who associated with him. Theodoric wrote and witnessed the papal letter. On 18 October 1099, he was in Tivoli, where he witnessed a document of antipope Clement III in favor of Cardinal Romanus of S. Ciriaco.

The legitimate pope, Urban II, died on 29 July 1099, and his successor Paschal II was elected at the church of San Clemente on 13 August 1099, and consecrated on 14 August 1099 in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. The Antipope Clement III was expelled from Rome at the same time, and died on 8 September 1100, at Civita Castellana, some 60km (37 mi) north of Rome. 

According to the &quot;Annales Romani&quot;, the followers of Clement met secretly in Rome, at night, in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, where they elected and enthroned Cardinal Theodoric, the Bishop of Albano, who may have assumed the name Sylvester III. But he did not dare to remain in the city. Forced to abandon Rome to seek protection of the emperor, Theodoric was seized by partisans of Pope Paschal II, and sent to Rome. He was convicted by judgment of the fathers, and immediately sent to the monastery of Santissima Trinità di Cava, near Salerno, where he was compelled to become a monk, or, according to the &quot;Life of Pope Paschal II,&quot; a hermit.

He died at Cava in 1102, according to the epitaph in the crypt of the monastery. A later memorial plaque in La Cava commemorates him under the pontifical name of &quot;Sylvester III&quot;, because the earlier Pope Sylvester III (Giovanni dei Crescenzi), at that time was considered an antipope. Theodoric&#x27;s successor was Antipope Albert, elected in 1101, or in February or March 1102.

<doc id="853610" wikidata="Q16821717" url="?curid=853610" title="Squib (explosive)">
<text>A squib is a miniature explosive device used in a wide range of industries, from special effects to military applications. It resembles a tiny stick of dynamite, both in appearance and construction, but has considerably less explosive power. A squib consists of two electrical leads separated by a plug of insulating material; a small bridge wire or electrical resistance heater; and a bead of heat-sensitive chemical composition, in which the bridge wire is embedded. They can be used to generate mechanical force to shatter or propel various materials; and for pyrotechnic effects for film and live theatrics.

A squib generally consists of a small tube filled with an explosive substance, with a detonator running through the length of its core, similar to a stick of dynamite. Also similar to dynamite, the detonator can be a slow-burning fuse, or as is more common today, a wire connected to a remote electronic trigger. Squibs range in size from ~ in diameter.

== Film industry ==
In the film industry, the term &quot;squib&quot; often refers to electric matches and detonators used to trigger larger pyrotechnics. They are generally (but not always) the main explosive element in an effect, and are often used in special effects to simulate bullet impacts on inanimate objects or actors. Fake blood packets are typically coupled with squibs and attached to the stage clothes worn by actors, referred to as dead-character costumes, that burst through pre-made &quot;bullet&quot; holes to simulate the appearance of a person being shot and wounded. This creates a realistic and convincing visual effect for movies, TV shows, and stage performances.

==Automotive industry==
Squibs are used in emergency mechanisms where gas pressure needs to be generated quickly in confined spaces, while not harming any surrounding persons or mechanical parts. In this form, squibs may be called gas generators. Two such mechanisms are the inflation of automobile air bags and seat belt pretensioners which sometimes use pyrotechnic devices.

Pyro fuses are also used to disconnect the vehicle&#x27;s power circuit. The pyro fuse is installed on the positive terminal of the battery and receives a signal from the vehicle&#x27;s control unit in the event of an accident. During an accident, the pyrotechnic charge in the pyrofuse is triggered, which uses a piston to break the power circuit and de-energize the vehicle&#x27;s battery.

In 2003, the European Commission adopted Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles (ELV Directive). This measure was introduced to prevent potential fires that may occur due to battery damage during an accident. Battery pyro-fuses ensure instant power disconnection, minimizing the risk of short circuits and fires

In military aircraft, squibs are used to deploy countermeasures and are also implemented during ejection to propel the canopy and ejection seat away from a crippled aircraft. They are also used to deploy parachutes.

==Other uses==
Squibs are also used in automatic fire extinguishers, to pierce seals that retain liquids such as halon, fluorocarbon, or liquid nitrogen.

==History==
Squibs were originally made from parchment tubes, or the shaft of a feather, and filled with fine black powder. They were then sealed at the ends with wax. They were sometimes used to ignite the main propellant charge in a cannon.

Squibs were once used in coal mining to break coal away from rock. In the 1870s, some versions of the device were patented and mass-produced as &quot;Miners&#x27; Safety Squibs&quot;.

=== The famous &quot;Squib Case&quot; ===
Squibs are mentioned in the prominent tort case from eighteenth-century England, &quot;Scott v. Shepherd&quot;, 96 Eng. Rep. 525 (K.B. 1773). A lit squib was thrown into a crowded market by Shepherd and landed on the table of a gingerbread merchant. A bystander, to protect himself and the gingerbread, threw the squib across the market, where it landed in the goods of another merchant. The merchant grabbed the squib and tossed it away, accidentally hitting a man in the face, putting out one of his eyes.

=== Squibs in films ===
The first documented use of squibs to simulate bullet impacts in cinema was in the 1943 US war film &quot;Bataan&quot;.

Other early films using squibs include the 1955 Polish film &quot;Pokolenie&quot; by Andrzej Wajda, where for the first time audiences were presented with a realistic representation of a bullet impacting on an on-camera human being, complete with blood spatter. The creator of the effect, Kazimierz Kutz, used a condom with fake blood and dynamite.

However, the American western, &quot;River of No Return&quot;, filmed in 1953 and released in 1954, used a blood squib to simulate realistic bullet impact in the story&#x27;s climax, when the story&#x27;s antagonist is shot dead. As such, this film precedes &quot;Run of the Arrow&quot; (1957) – often credited with being the first to use blood squibs – by three years, and &quot;Pokolenie&quot; by one.

=== Origin of the phrase &quot;damp squib&quot; ===

While most modern squibs used by professionals are insulated from moisture, older uninsulated squibs needed to be kept dry in order to ignite, thus a &quot;damp squib&quot; was literally one that failed to perform because it got wet. Often misheard as &quot;damp squid&quot;, the phrase &quot;damp squib&quot; has since come into general use to mean anything that fails to meet expectations. The word &quot;squib&quot; has come to take on a similar meaning even when used alone, as a diminutive comparison to a full explosive.

<text>Ways &amp; Means is a double album recorded by Australian artist Paul Kelly and originally released in February 2004, which peaked at #13 on the ARIA Albums Charts. It won the 2004 ARIA Music Award for Best Adult Contemporary Album. It was issued on EMI in Australia and Cooking Vinyl in the US. Kelly&#x27;s backing band were later called The Boon Companions and consisted of his nephew Dan Kelly on guitar, Peter Luscombe on drums and his brother Dan Luscombe on guitar and keyboards, and Bill McDonald on bass guitar. &quot;Beautiful Feeling&quot; was used as the theme song for the ABCTV series &quot;Fireflies&quot; (2004).

Paul Kelly &amp; the Boon Companions released a DVD titled, &quot;Ways &amp; Means&quot; later in 2004. It contained 31 tracks divided into three sections: 15 tracks subtitled, &quot;Live in Boston&quot;, 12 tracks subtitled, &quot;Musicmax Sessions - Live at the Sydney Opera House&quot; (recorded on 27 January), and four tracks subtitled, &quot;Film Clips&quot;.

==Background==
&quot;Ways &amp; Means&quot; was released by Paul Kelly on 17 February 2004, which peaked at #13 on the ARIA Albums Charts. Though identified as a solo record, it was more of a group effort, with a backing band later dubbed The Boon Companions co-writing many of the tracks. The Boon Companions consisted of Kelly&#x27;s nephew Dan Kelly on guitar, Peter Luscombe on drums and his brother Dan Luscombe on guitar and keyboards, and Bill McDonald on bass guitar. On 7 February, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation had started broadcasting the television series &quot;Fireflies&quot; which featured a score by Kelly and Stephen Rae. The associated soundtrack CD &quot;Fireflies: Songs of Paul Kelly&quot; included tracks by Kelly, Paul Kelly &amp; the Boon Companions, Professor Ratbaggy (containing Kelly and three earlier bandmates), Paul Kelly with Uncle Bill, and &quot;Los Cucumbros&quot; by the Boon Companions featuring Sian Prior, which was later a track on &quot;Stardust Five&quot; by Stardust Five (same line-up as Paul Kelly &amp; the Boon Companions).

<doc id="853622" wikidata="Q7755192" url="?curid=853622" title="The Open Theater">
<text>The Open Theater was an experimental theatre group in New York City, active from 1963 to 1973.

==Foundation==
The Open Theater was founded in New York City by a group of former students of acting teacher Nola Chilton, together with director Joseph Chaikin (formerly of The Living Theatre), Peter Feldman, Megan Terry, and Sam Shepard. Joseph Chaikin had just left the Living Theater, following the arrest of Julian Beck and Judith Malina for tax evasion. He felt that the Living Theater had become less interested in artistic exploration and experimentation, and more interested in political activism and he felt that actors needed specific training to do the sorts of pieces that the Living Theater did. The group&#x27;s intent was to continue Chilton&#x27;s exploration of a &quot;post-method&quot;, post-absurd acting technique, by way of a collaborative and wide-ranging process that included exploration of political, artistic, and social issues, which were felt to be critical to the success of avant-garde theatre. The company, developing work through an improvisational process drawn from Chilton and Viola Spolin, created well-known exercises, such as &quot;sound and movement&quot; and &quot;transformations&quot;, and originated radical forms and techniques that anticipated or were contemporaneous with Jerzy Grotowski&#x27;s &quot;poor theater&quot; in Poland. According to playwright Megan Terry, the notion of a minimalist aesthetic was fueled by the company&#x27;s quest to achieve narrative insight and political accountability through the body of the actor:

The Open Theater formed as an offshoot of the Living Theater. The Living Theater initially divided because actor Joseph Chaikin felt that the troupe had become less interested in artistic exploration and experimentation, and more interested in political activism. He felt that actors needed specific training to do the sorts of pieces that the Living Theater did.

== Theatrical explorations ==
Chaikin&#x27;s theatrical exploration came from within; he was interested in the personal experience of the actor, and of the actor&#x27;s relationship to the rest of the community. He developed improvisational exercises designed to help the actor become freer. The technique was initially inspired by method acting, in which the actor draws on his or her own experiences and emotions, but the goal of Chaikin&#x27;s work was to free the actor from the natural restraints of method acting. He called his technique the &quot;sound and movement&quot; technique. In his book entitled &quot;The Presence of the Actor&quot;, Chaikin wrote &quot;Traditional acting in America has become a blend of that same kind of synthetic &#x27;feeling&#x27; and sentimentality which characterizes the Fourth of July parade, Muzak, church services, and political campaigns.&quot; This further explains the purpose for the Open Theater and the reasoning behind opening such a space.

== Ensemble work ==
Chaikin used ensemble casts as a way to explore the relationship between the actor and the outside world. He relied on the performers to interact not as characters in fictional settings, but as real people in real situations. While the Living Theater&#x27;s ensemble was very external and audience oriented, Chaikin&#x27;s was internal and oriented within the troupe itself. In 1963, Chaikin said &quot;Working together, we teach ourselves.&quot; The ensemble worked in the &quot;poor theater&quot; style. There was no need for sets, costumes, props, or any of the other theatrical elements. There were no moving lights, only enough stationary light to be able to see. There was no music, instead, the actors would use their voices to create the sound effects. There were hardly any aspects of &quot;rich&quot; theater involved.

On his reasons for using ensembles instead of a traditional cast and show, Chaikin said:

I felt a terrific longing for a kind of ensemble. I wanted to play with actors, actors who felt a sensitivity for one another... In order to come to a vocabulary, we had to teach each other: we had no ambitions other than to meet and play around... Off-off Broadway&#x27;s impulse was a terrific dissatisfaction with what is possible on Broadway... Off-off broadway is really an attack on the fourth wall. I want to destroy the fourth-wall business. I have difficulty believing most of what happens on Broadway. Mary Martin&#x27;s like a character in a television commercial: nobody&#x27;’s like that.

== Location ==
The ensemble met on Spring Street in Lower Manhattan in a warehouse.

== Disbanding and further works ==
Chaikin disbanded the Open Theater in 1973, amid fears that it was becoming too institutionalized. He later went to work for the Public Theater. Chaikin continued to create workshops, but he was increasingly working on mainstream projects.

==Productions==
During the first two years of its existence, there were no productions performed by the Open Theater. Instead, there were occasional open rehearsals or workshops.

The first major production was &quot;The Serpent,&quot; and it toured both nationally and internationally.&quot;The Serpent&quot; typifies what is extraordinary about the Open Theater. The production is a perfect example of experimental theatre at the time and how willing the company was to employ unconventional theatre techniques that were based on improvisation in order to create a very pointed piece. According to the playwright Jean Claude Van Itallie, a member of the company, the piece was conceived with the idea that the actors would act as priests and that there would be a sense of one-ness amongst the congregation that they are questioning the same things in which the priest is questioning. Questions such as where does evil come from? What provokes people to commit murder? Is maintaining innocence a possibility within the contaminated world that which we walk upon? Though most of the piece is done in choreographed movement, mime, human sound-effects, hand-held instruments, there is text as well coming directly from the Bible along with a number of speeches written exclusively for the show.

The plot of &quot;The Serpent&quot; takes an extremely non-direct route in order to answer these questions. The play opens with a group of actors onstage where one recites a graphic description of an autopsy while the other members of the group are creating different sound effects and movements that match the text. Then the remaining members of the ensemble join the stage to partake in a stylized re-enactment of the John F. Kennedy assassination. One actor counts slowly to twelve while the other actors partake in the re-enactment in slow motion, moving to a new position and new sound effect per count. This scene is run forward, backwards, and out of order to the point that it becomes so ritualized that there is now an element of comedy in play within this depiction of someone&#x27;s untimely death. There is a sense of realization of how the horror of the murder rushes over the ensemble as they break free from their rigid formation and become instead a group of individuals fleeing from the evil that has just occurred. The ensemble then moves to the retelling of the banishment of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. Four actors take the shape of the serpent that convinces Eve to eat the forbidden fruit and are present as Eve then moves to convince Adam to partake of it. After being banished by God from the Garden, the actors then partake in a ritual enactment of the first true discovery of sexual love which takes place alongside a recitation of how the descendants of Adam begat the rest of mankind. This passionate celebration of sexuality is very much embraced onstage. The ensemble eventually collapses slowly to the floor when, at first, a hum falls over the group which soon turns into song. They eventually rise to their feet and travel down the aisles embracing audience members and smiling until the song is complete.

&quot;The Serpent&quot; aims to remind the audience of the idea that we are all caught in a neverending battle between the fact that we are neither as innocent nor as guilty as we may think we might be, having fallen victim to the at times foul planet that we reside on. The goal of the play was not to find answers the specific questions which were asked, but rather to visualize these inquiries through improvisation and to help the actors, as well as the audience members, to find their own personal truths.

Some of the company&#x27;s best known works include Terry&#x27;s &quot;Viet Rock&quot; (1966) with musical compositions by Marianne de Pury, Jean-Claude van Itallie&#x27;s &quot;America Hurrah&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Serpent&quot; (1969).

Other works included &quot;Endgame, American Hurrah, The Mutation Show, Nightwalk, and Terminal.&quot;

Members of the theatre simulated an orgy in Death Valley in a scene in the 1970 movie &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot;. The U.S. Justice Department later investigated the film questioning whether the orgy violated the Mann Act which criminalized the interstate transport of females for &quot;immoral purposes&quot;. However, the movie producers pointed out that no actual sex had taken place and that the actors had not crossed a state line since the town of Zabriskie Point is in California.

After the company&#x27;s dissolution, its members formed The Talking Band, and Medicine Show Theatre Ensemble and Spiderwoman Theater. Chaikin went on to have a celebrated career as a theatre director until his death in 2003.

<text>A Squib is a type of small racing keelboat designed in 1967 by Oliver Lee as a successor to the Ajax 23. It is a strict &quot;one-design&quot; class of boat, having a length of 19&#x27; (5.79 metres), beam of 6&#x27;1½&quot; (1.87 metres), a sail area of 170 sq. ft. (15.8 sq. mts.) upwind, 310 sq. ft. (29 sq. mts.) total and a weight of 1500 lb (680 kg) (including sails and fittings). The usual crew is two people and the boat can be cruised or raced with a Portsmouth Yardstick of 1142. The Squib has been adopted by the RYA as the National Keelboat and is big enough to race at sea and small enough to be trailed easily behind a family car.

==Early history==
Oliver Lee built the prototype Squib in 1967, using cold moulded wood. Following a succession of trials, the prototype was used as a &quot;plug&quot; from which copies of the boat could be built using glass-reinforced plastic construction. The first to be built was launched in June 1968, with sail number 11. Much later the plug was turned into a functioning boat and still sails. During 1968, a further five Squibs were built, and the first fleet began racing at the Royal Corinthian Yacht Club at Burnham-on-Crouch. Over the following few years numbers grew at Burnham and new fleets were formed at Waldringfield, Brixham, Abersoch and Aldeburgh. The Squib was granted national status by the Royal Yachting Association in 1972, when numbers exceeded 300.

In 1974, with sail numbers approaching 400, some of Britain&#x27;s yachting journalists were invited to Burnham-on-Crouch to race Squibs, in an event called the &quot;Squib Symposium&quot;. This resulted in raising the Squib&#x27;s profile with the yachting press. Around this time, the Design Centre (now retitled as the Design Council) decided to put the Squib on its index of selected designs.

==Squib builders==
Boats from number 11 to 157 were built by Oliver Lee in Burnham.

From 158 to 724, Squibs were built under licence by Hunter Boats.

Numbers 725 to 767 were built by Oliver Lee Racing Yacht.

After the death of Oliver Lee, in 1994, the licence moved to Barker Brewer Boats who built 768 to 782.

In 1997 the licence was acquired by Bruce Parker Sailboats who, by Spring 2009, had built 100 Squibs, their first being 783 and final boat 885. They were the only official builder of Squibs until they went into liquidation.

The moulds have been owned by the National Squib Owners Association since 1994 and a new deck and a new hull mould were commissioned in 2009. Strict control is kept over Squib build to ensure that older boats do not become uncompetitive as has happened in some other classes. However, there were keel mould changes in Squib number 230 and again at 465.

Older Squibs are still prized. In 1996, the National Championship winning boat was a Barker Brewer build (771 Arctic Fox.) In 1999 and 2008, Parker built Squibs won. All the other Championships since 1996 were won by older boats, nine of them by boats built before 1972.

By 2010 over 810 Squibs have been built and the National Squib Owners Association has over 640 members.

In June 2014 The National Squib Owners Association (NSOA) announced that Rondar Race Boats have been chosen to be the next builder of the National Squib and it has been decided to number all new Squibs starting at No. 900.

==The squib today==
By 2010, there are 27 local fleets in the British Isles and Ireland, 10 of which have over 20 boats. In 2008, the 40th Anniversary Regatta, with 45 entries, was held at Burnham-on-Crouch.

The Squib is not only raced. Cruising is a major feature of the life of the Squib Fleet at Newhaven and Seaford YC and a version of the Squib cruised from Glasgow to Inverness – and one crossed the Atlantic.

The Squib is a favourite boat for people with disabilities and, for example, the East Anglia Sailing Trust, an organisation aimed at providing sailing opportunities for disabled people, uses a fleet of Squibs. In 2009, the Special Olympics (for people with learning disabilities) were held in Leicester. The sailing events were at Rutland and the Squib was selected as the competition boat.

The class is beginning to have international aspirations. There is a fleet regularly raced in Malaysia. In the early days a couple of Squibs went to Tortola, in the British Virgin Islands as day charter boats and a fleet grew there but none of the boats now remain in use. Other early Squibs went to South Africa, Greece, Germany and Australia. Six brand new Squibs recently went to Germany and there is talk of the class featuring in Kiel Woche and of racing on the IJsselmeer in the Netherlands.

==Racing==
The first UK National Championship was held at Burnham, in 1972, with 29 competitors, and the event has been held at a different venue every year since then. The Nationals move around the Britain and Ireland and have been held from Dundee to Plymouth, as well as in Ireland (four times) and in Wales (eight times). The first 100 boat Nationals fleet was at Howth near Dublin in 1996 and attendance at the Nationals is regularly over 80 boats. In 2009, in Weymouth, 108 Squibs competed in the National Championship. When the UK Nationals are not held in Ireland, a combined northern and Southern Irish Championship is held. 

In 1995 Rutland Sailing Club instituted a UK Inland Championship which has proved so popular that it has been held on Rutland Water every year since with the entry limited to 55. In Ireland the Inland Championship is always held at Lough Derg Yacht Club in Dromineer. The first such event was held in 2011. There were 29 entries in 2021.

Squibs are one of the largest fleets at Cowes Week. In 2008, there were 40 Squibs racing, appropriately in the Squib’s 40th year.

Counting regional championships, invitational events and regattas, Squibs compete in 25 open events each year – all over Britain and Ireland and, occasionally, on the Continent. 
Ranked by attendance at National Championships, the Squib is consistently one of the top ten classes. In 2007, only five other classes had larger numbers than the Squib and four of these were children’s boats.

Squibs race as a class in Aldeburgh Week, Medway Week, Menai Strait Fortnight, Oulton Week and Tay Week.

In Ireland there are Squib fleets on the East coast at Howth and Dublin Bay. In the North at Cultra on Belfast Lough, and at Killyleagh on Strangford Lough. Squibs on the South coast sail from Kinsale and Glandore. The only inland freshwater fleet is at Dromineer on Lough Derg with a fleet of almost 30 Squibs.

==Related design==
The Sandhopper is a shallow draft version of the Squib, also designed by Oliver Lee. Among others, there are regular racing fleets at locations on the East Coast of England.

The Hunter 19 (Europa) is a development of the Squib, with a cabin added.

<text>A squib is a brief satirical or witty piece of writing or speech, like a lampoon, or a short, sometimes humorous piece in a newspaper or magazine, used as a filler. It can be intended to ignite thinking and discourse by others on topics of theoretical importance, but is often less substantial than this and just humorous (see The Daily Squib).

One of the most famous squibs in English literature is &quot;The Candidate&quot; by Thomas Gray.

In linguistics, the term &quot;squib&quot; is used for a very short scholarly article; this usage in the field was popularized by John R. “Haj” Ross in the 1960s. A squib may outline anomalous data but not suggest a solution, or develop a minor theoretical argument. A particularly interesting variety of squibs are the so-called snippets, which are &quot;the ideal footnote: a side remark that taken on its own is not worth lengthy development but that needs to be said&quot;. The online journal Snippets is dedicated to this type of squib.

<doc id="853631" wikidata="Q4545108" url="?curid=853631" title="...Nothing but a Dream">
<text>...nothing but a dream is a studio album recorded by Australian singer-songwriter, Paul Kelly. It was released on 13 August 2001 via EMI Records, and peaked at No. 7 on the ARIA Albums Chart and No. 46 on the Official New Zealand Music Chart. It was also released in the United States on Cooking Vinyl and included four tracks from Kelly&#x27;s earlier extended play, &quot;Roll on Summer&quot; (2000). In Australia and New Zealand the album provided three singles, &quot;Somewhere in the City&quot; (July 2001), &quot;Love Is the Law&quot; (October) and &quot;If I Could Start Today Again&quot; (January 2002).

Two days before the album appeared Kelly had issued a five-track EP, &quot;Paul Kelly Exclusive CD&quot;, which was provided free with &quot;The Weekend Australian Magazine&quot; – it has two tracks, &quot;The Pretty Place&quot; and &quot;Somewhere in the City&quot;, from the album. It was the first CD to be included with an Australian newspaper magazine, although this did cause problems with home deliveries, with many subscribers missing out. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2002 &quot;...nothing but a dream&quot; won Best Adult Contemporary Album for Kelly and he was nominated for Best Male Artist.

== Reception ==

AllMusic&#x27;s Jason MacNeil rated the US version of &quot;...nothing but a dream&quot; at four-out-of-five stars and explained, &quot;the songs speak of a certain longing and asking for redemption, but are dominantly roots pop arrangements.&quot; He observed, &quot;An added bonus is the four additional tracks from a previously released EP, with the funky duet of &#x27;Roll on Summer&#x27; being the high point of the lot.&quot;

Steve Newton of &quot;The Georgia Straight&quot; felt it, &quot;contains its share of solo, acoustic ballads, but also sees the singer-songwriter performing with the full band.&quot; Newton described the track, &quot;Would You Be My Friend&quot;, where Mick Harvey is &quot;handling guitar, organ, bass, and drums&quot; as a &quot;soothing&quot; rendition. They recorded it in Harvey&#x27;s back yard shed and Kelly explained, &quot;&#x27;He&#x27;s got a bigger shed than me, but he&#x27;s got the same eight-track tape machine, so we&#x27;ve got a similar basic setup&#x27;.&quot;

<doc id="853637" wikidata="Q435314" url="?curid=853637" title="Antipope Adalbert">
<text>Adalbert (or Albert) was elected pope of the Catholic Church in February 1101 and served for 105 days. He was a candidate of the Roman party opposed to Pope Paschal II and is regarded today as an antipope. Prior to his election he was created a cardinal by the antipope Clement III. He was captured by partisans of Paschal II and forced to live out his days as a monk.

==Cardinal==
The date of Adalbert&#x27;s birth is unknown, but he was from the town of Atella in southern Italy. He was an early supporter of Clement III, who rewarded him with the suburbicarian diocese of Silva Candida. He was among the twelve cardinals of Clement III who gathered in the Lateran Palace to underwrite a papal letter on 4 November 1084.

Adalbert can be traced at Rome throughout Clement&#x27;s pontificate. He was by the antipope&#x27;s side when Clement issued a privilege on 8 January 1089. On 7 August 1098 he was one of a group of prelates who presided over a conciliabulum convoked by Clement. The assembly condemned all the &quot;old and new&quot; heresies of the monk Hildebrand, that is, Pope Gregory VII. It also issued a summons to the &quot;schismatics&quot;, the followers of Gregory&#x27;s successor, Urban II, enjoining them to be present in Rome on 1 November. Adalbert&#x27;s name is atop the list of signatories of this letter, an indication of his importance in the &quot;curia&quot; of Clement III.

When Clement&#x27;s successor, Theodoric, was captured by his opponents in February 1101, Adalbert was elected to succeed him.

==Antipope==
The circumstances of Adalbert&#x27;s election are difficult to ascertain. It took place in the basilica of Santi Apostoli. According to the German chroniclers Frutolf of Michelsberg and Ekkehard of Aura, the Emperor Henry IV intervened to secure Adalbert&#x27;s nomination, although sources nearer in space and time to events do not mention the emperor. Although the papal electors believed they were acting in the interests of the empire, Henry IV is not known to have had any contact with Adalbert. The &quot;Annales Romani&quot;, the richest source of information on Adalbert&#x27;s pontificate, states simply that he was elected by that part of the clergy and people of Rome who had sided with Clement III.

It is clear that Adalbert was elected, consecrated and enthroned within days of Theodoric&#x27;s capture in February 1101. Modern historians have often erroneously dated his election to 1102. The speed with which he was elected indicates that the pro-Imperial Clementine party in Rome was still well organized at the time. Among his known supporters were Romano, a cardinal who had taken part in the conciliabulum of 1098, and Romano&#x27;s nephew, Giovanni Oddoline. Adalbert retained his baptismal name as pope. A pallium was made for Adalbert, although it could not be laid on Saint Peter&#x27;s tomb, because the Clementine faction did not control it.

Adalbert&#x27;s first public appearance drew a large crowd and rapidly degenerated into unrest. The situation eventually got so bad that he was forced to take refuge in the basilica of San Marcello al Corso under the protection of Romano and Giovanni Oddoline. Many clergy who tried to reach the church were beaten and stripped naked by the mob. Paschal II then bribed Giovanni to hand the antipope over. Adalbert was stripped of his pallium and handed over to Paschal&#x27;s forces. His pontificate had lasted 105 days. He was led behind a horse (as a sign of contempt) to the Lateran Palace, where Paschal was residing. He was then imprisoned in a tower. The &quot;Annales Romani&quot; and the biography of Paschal in the &quot;Liber pontificalis&quot; agree that the acceptance of the bribe and the antipope&#x27;s imprisonment took place in the space of one day.

Adalbert was eventually sent to the Benedictine monastery of San Lorenzo in Aversa, where he spent the rest of his life. The date of his death and the place of burial are not known. In 1105, the pro-Imperial party elected Maginulf as Sylvester IV in opposition to Paschal, but he was no more successful than his predecessors for he too lacked imperial support.

<text>Joseph Chaikin (September 16, 1935 – June 22, 2003) was an American theatre director, actor, playwright, and pedagogue.

==Early life and education==
The youngest of five children, Chaikin was born to a poor Jewish family living in the Borough Park neighborhood of Brooklyn. At the age of six, he was struck with rheumatic fever, and he continued to suffer from resulting heart complications throughout his life. At the age of ten, he was sent to the National Children&#x27;s Cardiac Hospital in Florida. It was during this period of isolation he began to organize theater games with other children. After two years in Florida, his health improved, and he was returned to his family, who had moved to Des Moines, Iowa, where his father had taken a job teaching.

Chaikin briefly attended Drake University in Iowa, and then returned to New York to begin a career in theater, studying with various acting coaches, while struggling to survive working a variety of jobs. He appeared as a figurant at the Metropolitan Opera, and gradually began to be cast in legitimate stage roles, going on to work with The Living Theatre before founding in 1963 The Open Theater a theater co-operative that progressed from a closed experimental laboratory to a performance ensemble.

==Career==
Open Theater allowed Chaikin and his colleagues the space to experiment with unconventional and organic drama techniques. They embraced dance and musical performance practices and encouraged actors to be more expressive in the body. When asked in a 1999 interview why he was compelled to start Open Theater, Chaikin responded, &quot;I’m not crazy about naturalism on stage. An actor is an interpretive artist. They can take their talent further. I wanted them to stretch, be creative.&quot;

The Open Theatre&#x27;s most famous and critically acclaimed production, &quot;The Serpent&quot;, was developed largely from the actors&#x27; own experiences, using the Bible as text, but incorporating current events, such as the violence of the 1960s. An Open Theatre exercise by Jean-Claude van Itallie, &quot;Interview,&quot; became part of the play &quot;America Hurrah&quot;, and Chaikin directed the &quot;Interview&quot; section when the play opened at the Pocket Theatre in 1966. In 1969 Open Theatre performed &quot;Endgame&quot; by Samuel Beckett, with Chaikin playing the role of Hamm and Peter Maloney as Clov, at the Cite Universitaire, Paris, and in 1970 at the Grasslands Penitentiary, a fulfillment of Chaikin&#x27;s desire to experiment with audiences who would be fundamentally and culturally different from cosmopolitan audiences.

In 1970-71 Open Theatre performed &quot;Terminal&quot; by Susan Yankowitz, touring the production internationally—including at the Shiraz Arts Festival in Iran (1971)--as well as to many maximum and minimum security prisons in the eastern U.S. and Canada. The Open Theater operated for about ten years. Chaikin closed the Open Theatre in 1973 because he said it was in danger of becoming an institution. Although it achieved much critical success, Chaikin said: &quot;I have rarely known a case where a critic&#x27;s response to actors, directors or writers has expanded or encouraged their talent- I &quot;have&quot; known cases where by panning or praising, the critic has crushed or discouraged creative inspiration&quot;.

In 1977, Chaikin formed an experimental workshop company called The Winter Project, whose members included Ronnie Gilbert, Corey Fischer, Robbie McCauley, Mark Samuels, Robert Montgomery, Christopher McCann, and Will Patton, as well as core members of the previous Open Theatre, among others. In the Winter Project, Chaikin proposed and participated in explorations of the boundary between life and death, the actor as storyteller, listening, found dialogue and more.

His production of &quot;The Dybbuk&quot; at the Public Theater in 1977-78 was, to some extent, influenced by some of these researches. Chaikin had a close working relationship with Sam Shepard and they co-wrote the plays &quot;Tongues&quot; and &quot;Savage/Love&quot;, both of which premiered at San Francisco&#x27;s Magic Theatre. They were commissioned to write &quot;When The World Was Green&quot; for the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, later collaborating to write &quot;The War in Heaven&quot;. Chaikin was an expert on Samuel Beckett.

Chaikin adapted &quot;Texts for Nothing&quot; with Steven Kent who directed him in a solo show based on the material which performed at the Public Theater in New York, at the Roundhouse Theatre in London, the American Center in Paris, and in Toronto. Chaikin directed a number of Beckett&#x27;s plays, including &quot;Endgame&quot; at the Manhattan Theatre Club and &quot;Happy Days&quot;&quot; at Cherry Lane Theater.

==Awards and honors==
* Chaikin received six Obie Awards, including one for Lifetime Achievement, and two Guggenheim Fellowships.
* His book &quot;The Presence of The Actor&quot; was first published in 1972 by Theatre Communications Group, and a second edition followed in 1991. Based on his experiments with actors, the book includes exemplar notes, photographs, and exercises from Open Theatre productions, and records Chaikin&#x27;s ideas about theater as a tool for social transformation.
* In 2010, he was inducted, posthumously, into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
In 1984, Chaikin suffered a stroke during his third open-heart surgery, which left him with partial aphasia. Following this, several writers, including Jean-Claude van Itallie, Susan Yankowitz, and Sam Shepard, wrote plays specifically for Chaikin to perform and direct, including &quot;The War in Heaven&quot; (by Chaikin and Shepard), which was directed by Steven Kent. Chaikin performed the piece in San Diego, Atlanta, and Parma, Italy. Samuel Beckett&#x27;s last poem, &quot;What Is the Word?&quot;, was written for and dedicated to Chaikin.

Chaikin was a lifelong teacher of acting and directing, and lived most of his adult life in New York&#x27;s West Village, at Westbeth Artists Community. His sisters included the children&#x27;s writer Miriam Chaikin, and Shami Chaikin, an actor.

<text>The National Wine Centre of Australia (commonly the &quot;Wine Centre&quot;) is a public exhibition building about winemaking and its industry in South Australia, opened in 2001. It contains an interactive permanent exhibition of winemaking, introducing visitors to the technology, varieties and styles of wine. It also has a wine tasting area, giving visitors the opportunity to taste and compare wines from different areas of Australia.

The Wine Centre is situated at the eastern end of North Terrace, Adelaide in the east parklands and adjacent to the Adelaide Botanic Gardens. The building designed by Cox Grieve Gillett uses building materials to reflect items used in making wine. The exterior of the building looks like a section of a wine barrel. Outside the building are rows of grapevines, showing seven different varieties of grapes to curious visitors who normally would not have access to a vineyard to see the differences for themselves.

==History==
Its development by the Olsen Liberal State Government was shrouded in controversy and it was labelled as a white elephant by the Opposition. It eventually opened on 6 October 2001 after enabling legislation created the concept in the National Wine Centre Act (1997). After a number of problems with funding, management and profitability, the Wine Centre operation was given to the University of Adelaide on 12 September 2003 on a 40-year lease. It now offers some of the university&#x27;s oenology courses, as well as the public face of the wine industry in Australia.

<text>The Canada Games () is a multi-sport event held every two years, alternating between the Canada Winter Games and the Canada Summer Games. They represent the highest level of national competition for Canadian athletes. Two separate programs are organized in order to cover the seasons of summer and winter: the Canada Summer Games (CSG) and the Canada Winter Games (CWG). Athlete age eligibility rules vary. The host cities have not been chosen for the games after 2025 but the provinces through 2035 have been selected. St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland will host the 2025 Canada Summer Games at the Aquarena, which is currently undergoing renovations in preparation for the event.

The first &quot;Canada Winter Games&quot; was the 1967 Canada Winter Games, marking the beginning of this important sporting event for Canadians. It has since become an integral part of celebrating Canadian talent for young amateur Canadian athletes focused on winter sports. The most recent Canada Winter Games was the 2023 Canada Winter Games which ran from February 18 – March 5, 2023 in the province of Prince Edward Island. The next Canada Winter Games, the 2027 Canada Winter Games, will be hosted in Quebec City, Quebec. The dates are yet to be announced.

The first &quot;Canada Summer Games&quot; was the 1969 Canada Summer Games. The most recent Canada Summer Games was the 2022 Canada Summer Games which took place August 6–21, 2022 in the Niagara Region. The next Canada Summer Games, the 2025 Canada Summer Games, will be hosted in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador. St. John&#x27;s Newfoundland and Labrador was named the Host Society of the 2025 Canada Summer Games as of April 22, 2021.

==History ==
The Games were first held in 1967 in Quebec City as part of Canada&#x27;s Centennial celebrations. For the first time in Canada&#x27;s history, 1,800 athletes from 10 provinces and two territories gathered to compete in 15 sports. Since 1967, over 75,000 athletes have participated in the Games. The Games have been hosted in every province at least once since their inception in Quebec City during Canada’s Centennial in 1967. Journalist Eddie MacCabe wrote a history book for the 25th anniversary of the Canada Games in 1992.

===Facility development===


==Sports==
Over the course of the history of the Canada Games, a variety of sports have been added and dropped at various points within the Summer Games and Winter Games programs. The winter games include some sports not associated with winter.

===Former sports===
Fencing was previously a Winter Games sport before it was moved to Summer program for the Sherbrooke 2013 games and then removed altogether following those games. BMX, field hockey, and water polo were formerly in the Summer program as well. Racquetball was in the 1979, 1983, and 1991 Canada Winter Games, but hasn&#x27;t been included since.

===Returning sports===
Fencing made its return to the Games during the 2023 Canada Winter Games in Prince Edward Island. Its last appearance had been during the 2013 Canada Summer Games.

Box lacrosse made its return to the Summer Games during the 2022 Canada Summer Games. It was the first time box lacrosse had been featured since the 1985 Canada Games.

==Organization==
The games are governed by the Canada Games Council, a private, non-profit organization. As the Games move from one host community to the next, the Council provides the continuity, leadership and support to Host Societies in key areas such as sport technical, organizational planning, ceremonies and protocol, marketing and sponsorship. In addition, the Canada Games Council ensures effective long-term partnerships with national sport organizations, governments and the corporate sector. The Canada Games Council is a well-established, national organization that fosters on-going partnerships with organizations at the municipal, provincial and national levels.

=== Host Society ===

The individual games are run by the local Host Society, a non-profit private organization that is established 2–4 years prior to the event. The Host Society functions in accordance with an agreement between the Canada Games Council, the government of Canada, the government of the province or territory and the government of the municipality. The Canada Games Council maintains and secures long-term partnership agreements with governments, corporations and national sport organizations.

=== Funding ===

Funding for the games comes from the several levels of government together with donations and corporate sponsorships. A considerable portion of the work during the games is performed by local volunteers.

== Hosts ==
The host cities have not been chosen for the games after 2025, but the provinces through 2037 have.

===Summer===

*The 2022 Canada Games were scheduled to be held in 2021, but were rescheduled to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="853653" wikidata="Q7866309" url="?curid=853653" title="USCG seagoing buoy tender">
<text>The USCG seagoing buoy tender is a type of United States Coast Guard Cutter used to service aids to navigation throughout the waters of the United States and wherever American shipping interests require. The U.S. Coast Guard has maintained a fleet of seagoing buoy tenders dating back to its origins in the U.S. Lighthouse Service (USLHS). These ships originally were designated with the hull classification symbol WAGL, but in 1965 the designation was changed to WLB, which is still used today.

==Ex U.S. Army mine planters==
Six U.S. Army mine planters built 1917–1919 were transferred to the U.S. Light House Service during a reduction in the Army in the early 1920s. These, after absorption into the U.S. Coast Guard, became that service&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Speedwell&quot; class&quot;:

* &quot;Acacia&quot; (WAGL-200), ex USAMP &quot;Gen. John P. Story&quot; (shelled &amp; sunk by a German U-boat on 15 March 1942)
* &quot;Ilex&quot; (WAGL-222), ex USAMP &quot;Brig. Gen. Edmund Kirby&quot;
* &quot;Lotus&quot; (WAGL-229), ex USAMP &quot;Col. Albert Todd&quot;
* &quot;Lupine&quot; (WAGL-230), ex USAMP &quot;Gen. Wallace F. Randolph&quot;
* &quot;Speedwell&quot; (WAGL-245), ex USAMP &quot;Col. John V. White&quot;
* &quot;Spruce&quot; (WAGL-246), ex USAMP &quot;Col. Garland N. Whistler&quot;

The ships were in length, beam with draft displacing 1,130 tons. Early mine planters, at first termed &quot;torpedo planters,&quot; had been modeled after USLHS vessels which had similar requirements for handling heavy loads alongside the vessels so that mine planters were easily converted to buoy work.

==Ex U.S. Army &quot;Chimo&quot;-class 188&#x27; mine planters 1942–1943==
Built from 1942 to 1943 by Marietta Manufacturing Company, Point Pleasant, West Virginia, these U.S Army mine planters were designed for diesel engines but low pressure steam plants were installed instead. Six of the vessels were transferred to the U.S. Navy as the &quot;Chimo&quot; class. Five vessels were later transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard and refitted as the &quot;Jonquil&quot; class of buoy tenders were after World War II.
* USAMP &quot;General Henry Knox&quot; (MP-1) (USS &quot;Picket&quot; (ACM-8) then USCGC &quot;Willow&quot; (WAGL / WLB-332))
* USAMP &quot;Colonel Henry J. Hunt&quot; (MP-2) (USS &quot;Bastion&quot; (ACM 6) then USCGC &quot;Jonquil&quot; (WAGL / WLB-330))
* USAMP &quot;Colonel George Armistead&quot; (MP-3) (USS &quot;Barbican&quot; (ACM-5) then USCGC &quot;Ivy&quot; (WLB-329/WAGL-329))
* USAMP &quot;1st Lt. William G. Sylvester&quot; (MP-5) (USS &quot;Obstructor&quot; (ACM 7) then USCGC &quot;Heather&quot; (WABL / WLB-331))
* USAMP &quot;Colonel John Storey&quot; (MP-8) (USS &quot;Barricade&quot; (ACM 3) then USCGC &quot;Magnolia&quot; (WAGL / WLB-328))

==180&#x27; – class ships==
Two classes of purpose-built, rather than refitted mine planters, Coast Guard seagoing buoy tenders have been produced. The first was the 180 ft-class cutters, which were long. Thirty-nine of these vessels were built from 1942–1944. All but one were constructed in the shipyards of Duluth, Minnesota. The 180 fleet, many of which served for more than 50 years, all went through different mid-life modifications that essentially resulted in three different classes of ship. All of the 180s are now retired and have been replaced with the &quot;Juniper&quot;-class cutters. The last 180-foot cutter, , was decommissioned on 7 June 2006.

==225&#x27; – &quot;Juniper&quot;-class ships==

The &quot;Juniper&quot; class ships, launched in the late 1990s, are the second class of purpose-built Coast Guard seagoing buoy tenders. They are designed and operated as multi-mission platforms. While the 180s also performed other Coast Guard missions, they lacked the speed, communications, navigation and maneuverability of the new &quot;Juniper&quot;s. Today, the &quot;Juniper&quot;s conduct almost as much law enforcement as aid to navigation work; they are also outfitted to handle oil spill recovery, search and rescue, homeland security, and some ice breaking operations. The &quot;Juniper&quot; class uses Dynamic Positioning which allows maintenance of the vessel&#x27;s position within a circle in winds of up to and waves of up to .

<doc id="853666" wikidata="Q368150" url="?curid=853666" title="Antipope Sylvester IV">
<text>Sylvester IV, born Maginulf, was a claimant to the Papacy from 1105 to 1111 in opposition to Paschal II. A priest before his election, he was probably a native of Rome. He had the backing of the Roman militia and initially of the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry IV, who later forced him to abdicate. Today he is regarded as an antipope.

==Election==
Before his election as pope, Maginulf was the archpriest of Sant&#x27;Angelo in Pescheria, which suggests that he was a native of Rome. He cannot be linked to the line of antipopes—Clement III, Theodoric and Adalbert—who opposed the Reformist papacy from 1080 to 1101. While the elections of Theodoric and Adalbert were relatively minor affairs, the election of Maginulf signalled a crisis in the pontificate of Pope Paschal II and was widely noted in contemporary chronicles: &quot;Annales Ceccanenses&quot;, &quot;Annales Leodienses&quot;, the Annalista Saxo, Ekkehard of Aura, Sigebert of Gembloux.

Members of the Roman aristocracy gathered in the Pantheon, then the church of Santa Maria Rotonda, and elected Maginulf in opposition to Paschal II in November 1105. The &quot;Annales Romani&quot; records the noblemen who supported his election: Stefano Oddone and his brothers, Nicola Cencio Baroncio and his son Pietro, Romano di Romano Baroncio and his brothers and nephews, and Enrico di Sant&#x27;Eustachio and his sons. This is the earliest record of Stefano Oddone, called the Norman, in the sources.

Margrave Werner of Ancona, in a letter to the Emperor Henry IV, describes his election as beginning with some clergy who were dissatisfied with Paschal&#x27;s simoniacal favoritism of the Colonna and Pierleoni families. This, coupled with the involvement of the Roman aristocracy in his election, suggests that the motivations were less ideological than rooted in local politics. According to Werner, there were meetings in Rome attended by bishops and cardinals, after which Maginulf, a man of learning and upright character, was elected pope. The head of the Roman militia, Berto, was required to force Maginulf to accept the honour. According to Paschal&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Liber pontificalis&quot;, Maginulf&#x27;s election was the work of the Devil. In a letter, Paschal cites his failure to give sufficient &quot;gifts&quot; to the Romans for the election of Maginulf.

==Pontificate==
After his election Maginulf took the papal name of Sylvester IV. This was a deliberate ploy to garner imperial sympathy, since it hearkened back to Pope Sylvester II, the great ally of the Emperor Otto III a hundred years earlier. The conspirators who had elevated the new pope sent word to Margrave Werner, requesting imperial support. Werner marched on Rome with imperial (German) troops and took possession of the Lateran, forcing Paschal II to flee to Tiber Island according to the &quot;Annales Romani&quot;, although Paschal addressed a letter from Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica. Sylvester IV was consecrated in the Lateran Basilica on 18 November 1105. The following day a battle broke out in the streets of Rome. There were two pitched battles: one near the Lateran Basilica and another in the Circus Maximus. Both &quot;equites&quot; (cavalry) and &quot;pedites&quot; (infantrymen) were involved in the fighting. Sylvester&#x27;s infantry are said to have chased Paschal&#x27;s cavalry throughout Santa Maria Nova, leaving over sixty horses dead.

Sylvester IV soon ran short on funds to pay his soldiers and left Rome for Tivoli with a bodyguard before finally settling in Osimo under the protection of Margrave Werner. The next five years are completely unknown. Sylvester only comes again into view in the spring of 1111, when the German king Henry V used him as a pawn in his negotiations with Paschal. Henry, who wanted Paschal to crown him emperor, forced Sylvester to renounce the Papacy on 12 or 13 April 1111.

Sylvester was allowed to live out the rest of his life in Osimo under the protection of Werner. According to the &quot;Annales Romani&quot;, Werner acted out of pity, but there was probably some political calculation involved in willingness to control an ex-pope.

<text>Professor Ratbaggy is a sometime four-piece band based in Melbourne, Australia. Sometimes thought of as a side-project of iconic Australian singer-songwriter Paul Kelly, the band is in fact its own entity: Kelly is one of the four members (song writing generally shared).

The band&#x27;s name is derived from the 1960s Australian TV character &quot;Professor Ratbaggy&quot;, who was a bumbling but kind-hearted scientist, a comical character, performed by Ernie Carroll on GTV-9 on Melbourne television.

Steve Hadley, Bruce Haymes and Peter Luscombe would frequently play as The Casuals, as well as being members of Kelly&#x27;s regular band.

Professor Ratbaggy&#x27;s songs are often instrumental and purely groove-based with reggae, dub and funk influences.

Professor Ratbaggy members and Shane O&#x27;Mara provided the original music for &quot;Lantana&quot; (2001) and are featured on the EMI soundtrack of the same name. The band&#x27;s song, &quot;Love Letter&quot; (from their self-titled 1999 album) was used on ABC-TV series &quot;Fireflies&quot; (2004) together with songs by Paul Kelly (alone and with other bands) and by other artists.

With Kelly often busy with his solo career and work in film and TV composition, Professor Ratbaggy&#x27;s live shows have all but ceased and their recorded output remains low; this is not to say that the concept has died and there remains a strong possibility of further playing and/or recording.

<doc id="853682" wikidata="Q805735" url="?curid=853682" title="Baltica">
<text>Baltica is a paleocontinent that formed in the Paleoproterozoic and now constitutes northwestern Eurasia, or Europe north of the Trans-European Suture Zone and west of the Ural Mountains.
The thick core of Baltica, the East European Craton, is more than three billion years old and formed part of the Rodinia supercontinent at 1 .

==Tectonic history==

Baltica formed at 2.0–1.7 Ga by the collision of three Archaean-Proterozoic continental blocks: Fennoscandia (including the exposed Baltic Shield), Sarmatia (Ukrainian Shield and Voronezh Massif), and Volgo-Uralia (covered by younger deposits). Sarmatia and Volgo-Uralia formed a proto-craton (sometimes called &quot;Proto-Baltica&quot;) at c. 2.0 Ga which collided with Fennoscandia c. 1.8–1.7 Ga. The sutures between these three blocks were reactivated during the Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic.

750–600 million years ago, Baltica and Laurentia rotated clockwise together and drifted away from the Equator towards the South Pole where they were affected by the Cryogenian Varanger glaciations. Initial rifting between the two continents is marked by the c. 650 Ma Egersund dike swarm in southern Norway and from 600 Ma they began to rotate up to 180° relative to each other, thus opening the Iapetus Ocean between the two landmasses. Laurentia quickly moved northward into low latitudes but Baltica remained an isolated continent in the temperate mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere, closer to Gondwana, on which endemic trilobites evolved in the Early and Middle Ordovician.

During the Ordovician, Baltica moved northward, approaching Laurentia, which again allowed trilobites and brachiopods to cross the Iapetus Ocean. In the Silurian, c. 425 Ma, the final collision between Scotland-Greenland and Norway resulted in the closure of the Iapetus and the Scandian Orogeny.

==Margins==
Baltica is a very old continent and its core is a very well-preserved and thick craton. Its current margins, however, are the sutures that are the result of mergers with other, much younger continental blocks. These often deformed sutures do not represent the original, Precambrian–early Palaeozoic extent of Baltica; for example, the curved margin north of the Urals running parallel to Novaya Zemlya was probably deformed during the eruption of the Siberian Traps in the Late Permian and Early Triassic.

Baltica&#x27;s western margin is the Caledonide orogen, which stretches northward from the Scandinavian Mountains across Barents Sea to Svalbard. Its eastern margin is the Timanide orogen which stretches north to the Novaya Zemlya archipelago.
The extent of the Proterozoic continent are defined by the Iapetus Suture to the west; the Trollfjorden-Komagelva Fault Zone in the north; the Variscan-Hercynian suture to the south; the Tornquist Zone to the southwest; and the Ural Mountains to the east.

===Northern margin===
At c. 555 Ma during the Timanian Orogeny the northern margin became an active margin and Baltica expanded northward with the accretion of a series of continental blocks: the Timan-Pechora Basin, the northernmost Ural Mountains, and the Novaya Zemlya islands. This expansion coincided with the Marinoan or Varanger glaciations, also known as Snowball Earth.

Terranes of the North American Cordillera, including Alaska-Chukotka, Alexander, Northern Sierra, and Eastern Klamath, share a rift history with Baltica and most likely were part of Baltica from the Caledonian orogeny until the formation of the Ural Mountains.
These terranes can be linked to either northeastern Laurentia, Baltica, or Siberia because of a similar sequence of fossils; detrital zircon from 2–1 Ga-old sources and evidence of Grenvillian magmatism; and magmatism and island arcs from the Late Neoproterozoic and Ordovician-Silurian.

===Southern margin===
From at least 1.8 Ga to at least 0.8 Ga the southwestern margin of Baltica was connected to Amazonia while the southeast margin was connected to the West African Craton.
Baltica, Amazonia, and West Africa rotated 75° clockwise relative to Laurentia until Baltica and Amazonia collided with Laurentia in the 1.1–0.9 Ga Grenville-Sveconorwegian-Sunsás orogenies to form the supercontinent Rodinia. When the break-up of Rodinia was complete c. 0.6 Ga Baltica became an isolated continent — a 200 million year period when Baltica was truly a separate continent.
Laurentia and Baltica formed a single continent until 1.265 Ga which broke up some time before 0.99 Ga. After the subsequent closure of the Mirovoi Ocean Laurentia, Baltica and Amazonia remained merged until the opening of the Iapetus Ocean in the Neoproterozoic.

===Western margin===
The Western Gneiss Region in western Norway is composed of 1650–950 Ma-old gneisses overlain by continental and oceanic allochthons that were transferred from Laurentia to Baltica during the Scandian orogeny. The allochthons were accreted to Baltica during the closure of the Iapetus Ocean c. 430–410 Ma; Baltica&#x27;s basement and the allochthons were then subducted to UHP depth c. 425–400 Ma; and they were finally exhumed to their present location c. 400–385 Ma. The presence of micro-diamonds in two islands in western Norway, Otrøya and Flemsøya, indicate that this margin of Baltica was buried c. for at least 25 million years around 429 Ma shortly after the Baltica-Laurentia collision.

The Baltica-Laurentia-Avalonia triple junction in the North Sea is the southwest corner of Baltica. The Baltica-Laurentia suture stretching northeast from the triple junction was deformed in the Late Cambrian in the Scandinavian Caledonides as well as in the Scandian Orogeny during the Silurian. Some Norwegian terranes have faunas distinct from those of either Baltica or Laurentia as a result of being island arcs that originated in the Iapetus Ocean and were later accreted to Baltica. The Baltica craton most likely underlies these terranes and the continent-ocean boundary passes several kilometres off Norway, but, since the North Atlantic opened c. 54 Ma where the Iapetus Ocean closed, it is unlikely the craton also reached into Laurentia. The margin stretches north to Novaya Zemlya where early Palaeozoic Baltica faunas have been found, but the sparsity of data makes it difficult to locate the margin in the Arctic. Ordovician faunas indicate that most of Svalbard, including Bjørnøya, was part of Laurentia, but Franz Josef Land and Kvitøya (an eastern island of the Svalbard archipelago) most likely became part of Baltica in the Timanide Orogeny. The Taymyr Peninsula, in contrast, never was part of Baltica: southern Taymyr was part of Siberia whilst northern Taymyr and the Severnaya Zemlya archipelago were part of the independent Kara Terrane in the early Palaeozoic.

===Eastern margin===
The eastern margin, the Uralide orogen, extends from the Arctic Novaya Zemlya archipelago to the Aral Sea. The orogen contains the record of at least two collisions between Baltica and intra-oceanic island arcs before the final collision between Baltica and Kazakhstania-Siberia during the formation of Pangaea. The Silurian-Devonian island arcs were accreted to Baltica along the Main Uralian Fault, east of which are metamorphosed fragments of volcanic arc mixed with small amounts of Precambrian and Paleozoic continental rocks. However, no rocks unambiguously originating from either Kazakhstania or Siberia have been found in the Urals.
The basement of the eastern margin is composed of an Archaean craton, metamorphosed rocks at least 1.6 Ga old, which is surrounded by the fold belt of the Timanide orogeny and overlain by Mesoproterozoic sediments. The margin became a passive margin facing the Ural Ocean in the Cambrian–Ordovician.

The eastern margin stretches south through the Ural Mountains from the northern end of the Novaya Zemlya archipelago. The margin follows the bent shape of Novaya Zemlya which was caused in the Late Permian by the Siberian Traps. It is clear from Baltic endemic fossils in Novaya Zemlya that the islands have been part of Baltica since the Early Palaeozoic, whereas the Taymyr Peninsula farther east was part of the passive margin of Siberia in the Early Palaeozoic. Northern Taymyr, together with Severnaya Zemlya and parts of the crust of the Arctic Ocean, formed the Kara Terrane.

The Urals Mountains formed in the mid and late Palaeozoic when Laurussia collided with Kazakhstania, a series of terranes. The eastern margin, however, originally extended farther east to an active margin bordered by island arcs, but those parts have been compressed, fractured, and distorted especially in the eastern Urals. The early Palaeozoic eastern margin is better preserved south of the polar region (65 °N) where shallow-water sediments can be found in the western Urals whilst the eastern Urals are characterised by deep-water deposits. The oldest known mid-ocean hydrothermal vent in the south-central part of the Urals clearly delimits the eastern extent. The straightness of the mountain chain is the result of continuous strike-slip movements during the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian (300–290 Ma).

Baltic endemic faunas from the Early Ordovician have been found in Kazakhstan near the southern end of the eastern margin, or the triple junction between Baltica, the Mangyshlak Terrane, and the accretionary Altaids. Here the Early Palaeozoic rocks are buried under the Caspian Depression.

<text>Deeper Water, the tenth studio album by Paul Kelly, was released on 12 September 1995 on White Label Records in Australia and on Vanguard Records in North America. It peaked at No. 40 on the ARIA Albums Chart and provided his second consecutive nomination as Best Male Artist at the ARIA Music Awards of 1996. In New Zealand &quot;Deeper Water&quot; reached No. 30 on the Official New Zealand Music Chart. Kelly issued its lead single, &quot;Give in to My Love&quot;, in October 1995 and followed with &quot;Deeper Water&quot; later that year.

== Background ==

Paul Kelly started recording his tenth studio album, &quot;Deeper Water&quot;, in September 1994. Two months earlier he had released his previous studio album, &quot;Wanted Man&quot;, which includes a track co-produced and co-written with Randy Jacobs (member of Was (Not Was)). For &quot;Deeper Water&quot;, Kelly and Jacobs co-wrote the title track; and they produced and wrote two further tracks, &quot;Extra Mile&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Been a Fool&quot;. Kelly used Kerryn Tolhurst (ex-The Dingoes) as producer for &quot;Difficult Woman&quot; and co-produced with him on &quot;Give in to My Love&quot;. A third co-producer, Simon Polinski (Yothu Yindi), worked on a track, &quot;Gathering Storm&quot;, which Kelly had co-written with Mart Saarelaht (leader of Jex Saarelaht Trio). All the other tracks were produced by Kelly; for the album he used the Platinum and Periscope Studios in Melbourne.

Kelly explained the title track&#x27;s symbolism: &quot;My father taught me to swim. Four of my brothers and sisters were older than me and three younger. I couldn&#x27;t wait to learn so I could join the older ones who would all rush straight up to the deep end. Deeper water to me meant danger, meant power, meant growing up ... Everytime you move through the big rituals in life it’s like a move into deeper water.&quot; One of the album tracks, &quot;Madeleine&#x27;s Song&quot;, was written for his elder daughter, Madeleine Kelly. Another track, &quot;Difficult Woman&quot;, was written for, and recorded by, Renée Geyer on her album of the same name, which had been produced by Kelly and was released in August 1994. Geyer later used the title for her autobiography, &quot;Confessions of a Difficult Woman&quot; (April 2000).

In May 1995 Kelly formed a touring backing band with Jacobs on guitar; Stephen Hadley on bass guitar; Bruce Haymes on keyboards; Graham Lee on lap and pedal steel; and Peter Luscombe on drums. They played a series of sets at the Esplanade Hotel, their performance on 25 May was recorded live for &quot;Live at the Continental and the Esplanade&quot; (late 1995). Kelly issued &quot;Deeper Water&quot;″s lead single, &quot;Give in to My Love&quot;, in October 1995 and followed with &quot;Deeper Water&quot; later that year. To promote the releases he toured Australia from January in the following year.

== Reception ==

&quot;The Canberra Times&quot;″ Sharon Palmer noticed that &quot;No real surprises or sounds appear on &quot;Deeper Water&quot;, however a number of songs are notable for the absence of back-up singers on them with Kelly providing all the vocals.&quot; William Ruhlmann of AllMusic opined that Kelly used &quot;a more consistent musical style than he had employed on &quot;Wanted Man&quot;.&quot; Ruhlmann continued &quot;most of the songs had folk-rock arrangements, and most concerned romantic subjects, within which Kelly&#x27;s primary concerns were lust and betrayal.&quot;
Mark Mordue writing in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; felt that &quot;the songs from &quot;Deeper Water&quot; have become part of our lives&quot; displaying Kelly&#x27;s &quot;poet of the common man credentials are built on both good writing and accuracy.&quot; Mordue expanded by describing its &quot;take on family, growing older and love also has a dark edge to it, something in the territory around the songs, that gives the album an unusual intensity and warmth.&quot;
&quot;Deeper Water&quot; peaked at No. 40 on the ARIA Albums Chart and provided his second consecutive nomination as Best Male Artist at the ARIA Music Awards of 1996. In New Zealand &quot;Deeper Water&quot; reached No. 30 on the Official New Zealand Music Chart. Neither of the singles, &quot;Give in to My Love&quot; and &quot;Deeper Water&quot;, appeared on the ARIA Singles Chart top 100.

<text>Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper (August 3, 1855 – March 30, 1927) was a Canadian lawyer and politician.

==Family, early career==
Tupper was the second son of Sir Charles Tupper, a physician, leading Conservative politician, and Canadian diplomat. The elder Tupper served as premier of Nova Scotia, was a Father of Confederation, and served briefly as prime minister of Canada in 1896. The younger Tupper practised law in Halifax, Nova Scotia, after articling to learn the profession; at the time there was no formal legal education in Atlantic Canada. He formed a successful partnership with Wallace Graham, and the two invited the young Robert Borden, a future prime minister who was one year older than Tupper, to join them in the late 1870s. A decade later, Borden became the firm&#x27;s senior partner after Graham was appointed a judge and Tupper entered politics.

Tupper&#x27;s younger brother William Johnston Tupper also became a Conservative politician.

==MP, Cabinet minister==
He was elected as a Conservative MP in 1882. He was appointed Minister of Marine and Fisheries by Sir John A. Macdonald in 1888, and kept that position in subsequent Conservative cabinets until 1894, under PMs Sir John Abbott and Sir John Sparrow David Thompson.

He then became Minister of Justice in the government of Sir Mackenzie Bowell and attempted, unsuccessfully, to resolve the Manitoba Schools Question by drafting a bill to restore Separate School education for Catholics in Manitoba. Tupper resigned in January 1896 to protest Bowell&#x27;s leadership, which had largely failed on this question, among others. He returned as Solicitor General of Canada in the short-lived government of his father, who became prime minister later in 1896, when Bowell stepped down. Tupper Sr. was defeated in the 1896 Canadian federal election, by Liberal Wilfrid Laurier, who became prime minister. Tupper remained an MP until his retirement from politics in 1904.

===Knighted===
In 1893, while minister of Marine and Fisheries, he was involved in the Bering Sea Arbitration between the United States and Canada as a representative of the British government, which at that time was responsible for Canadian foreign affairs. He was knighted in recognition for this service, which produced a successful outcome for Canada.

==Moves to British Columbia==
In 1897 he moved to Victoria, British Columbia, and then moved to Vancouver in 1898, but continued as the Member of Parliament for Pictou, Nova Scotia, where he was re-elected in 1900. From 1898 he practised law in Vancouver, where he served as a bencher of the Law Society of British Columbia and was elected Treasurer (chief elected officer) for 1924-25. He represented Japanese-Canadians in a series of cases opposing discriminatory practices of the provincial government. In 1923, he was involved in the creation of the short-lived Provincial Party of British Columbia.

He died in Vancouver March 30, 1927, and was buried in nearby Burnaby, in Ocean View Burial Park.

==Family==
In September 1879, Charles Hibbert Tupper married Janet McDonald, daughter of the Hon. James McDonald, Chief Justice of Nova Scotia, and his wife, Jane. The couple had four sons and three daughters. The couple lived in Parkside, Vancouver, B.C. Her sister married her brother-in-law, Mr. W. J. Tupper. Another sister married the Rev. L. H. Jordan, B.D., of Chicago.

<text>Milk delivery is a delivery service dedicated to supplying milk, typically in bottles or cartons, to customers&#x27; homes. This service is performed by a milkman, milkwoman, or milk deliverer. (In contrast, a cowman or milkmaid tends to cows.) The delivery route is a milk route or milk run.

Home milk delivery was common in many countries until the second half of the 20th century, when modern supermarkets and household refrigeration made it possible for consumers to buy and store milk on demand. Today, milk delivery still exists as a niche market in some countries.


==Delivery==

In some countries, when a lack of good refrigeration meant that milk would quickly spoil, milk was delivered to houses daily. Before milk bottles were available, milkmen took churns on their rounds and filled the customers&#x27; jugs by dipping a measure into the churn. Due to improved packaging and the spread of refrigerators in private homes, the need for milk delivery decreased from the latter part of the twentieth century. These advances contributed to the decline or loss of services in many localities, from deliveries daily to just three days a week or less in others.

Milk is usually delivered in the morning. Milk deliverers often also deliver products such as butter, cream, cheese, eggs, meat and vegetables.

In some areas, apartments and houses have small milk-delivery doors, latched but not locked, opening into small wooden cabinets built into the exterior wall of the house, with a door also on the inside, allowing groceries or milk to be put in the cabinet by the deliverer and removed by the resident.

==Vehicles==
Horse-drawn vehicles were used for local delivery from the inception of the first milk round in about 1860. These were still seen in Britain and parts of the United States in the mid-twentieth century, until replaced by motorized vehicles. First introduced in 1889, battery vehicles saw expanded use in 1931, and by 1967 had given Britain the largest electric vehicle fleet in the world.

==Around the world==
===Americas===
In 1963, nearly 29.7 percent of consumers in the US had milk delivered, but by 1975 the number had dropped to 6.9 percent of total sales.

By 2005, about 0.4% of consumers in the United States had their milk delivered, and a handful of companies had sprung up to offer the service. Some U.S. dairies have been delivering milk for about 100 years, with interest continuing to increase in the 2010s as part of the local food movement. During the 2020 coronavirus outbreak, some remaining milkmen saw demand increase suddenly (similar to other grocery delivery services) due to concerns about the infection risk involved with shopping in stores.
===Asia===
In India, milk is usually delivered using milk churns, a practice that has ceased in western countries. On the road, they are put on any kind of vehicle. In big cities such as Mumbai, milk churns are often transported in luggage compartments in local trains.

In the Philippines, the milkman or milkmaid is called &quot;lechero&quot;, as in Spanish-speaking countries. The tradition stemmed from the community production of carabao milk, which the &quot;lechero&quot; delivers fresh to their designated &quot;barangay&quot; (village). The &quot;lechero&quot; heritage used to be widely practiced in the country but declined after the introduction of store-bought milk during the American period. Nowadays, only a few communities have &quot;lecheros&quot;, notably in Nueva Ecija province, the milk capital of the Philippines.

===Oceania===
In Australia, the delivery vehicle was usually a small petrol or diesel truck with a covered milk-tray. In hotter areas, this tray is usually insulated.

In New Zealand, milk deliveries used horses until the 1960s, when trucks largely took over. Horses were still used for delivery into the 1970s in a few small areas. Originally, people paid by leaving money in the bottles, but later, payments were made using tokens, usually bought at a local dairy. Home milk deliveries died out in the 1990s after the deregulation of the milk industry, where supermarkets and other stores were permitted to sell milk.

===Europe===

Milkmen appeared in Britain around 1860, when the first railways allowed fresh milk to arrive in cities from the countryside. By 1880, the milk was delivered in bottles. By 1975, 94% of milk was in glass bottles, but in 1990, supermarkets started offering plastic and carton containers, reducing bottled milk from 94% to 3% by 2016. In the 20th century, milk delivery in urban areas of Europe has been carried out from an electric vehicle called a milk float.

==Cultural impact==

The comedy films &quot;The Milkman&quot; (1950) starring Donald O&#x27;Connor, and &quot;The Early Bird&quot; (1965), starring Norman Wisdom, portrayed the profession in the US and UK respectively.

Tevye the Dairyman (&quot;Tevye der milkhiker&quot;) is the fictional pious Jewish narrator and protagonist of a series of short stories by Sholem Aleichem, and various adaptations of them, the most famous being the stage/film musical &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;.

Stephen King&#x27;s short story &quot;Morning Deliveries (Milkman No. 1)&quot; (in the horror anthology &quot;Skeleton Crew&quot; (1985)), concerns a milkman who kills people by leaving &quot;surprises&quot; (including poison, toxic gas, and venomous spiders) in their milk cans.

The title of the pop hit &quot;No Milk Today&quot; (1966) by the British band Herman&#x27;s Hermits comes from notes left for the milkman. The title symbolizes the singer&#x27;s recent breakup with his love interest who has just moved out of his house.

The British comedian Benny Hill, himself a former milkman, had a hit novelty song called &quot;Ernie (The Fastest Milkman In The West)&quot; (1971).

Ella Mae Morse had a US top 10 hit with &quot;Milkman, Keep Those Bottles Quiet&quot;, from the film &quot;Broadway Rhythm&quot; (1944).

The (unnamed) milkwoman was an occasional character in British sitcom &quot;Open All Hours&quot;, the object of Granville&#x27;s desire. Despite working early mornings just as Granville did, she was also a part-time university student and a divorcee, representing aspirations of a life lived beyond the terraced streets of the local neighborhood.

Episode 3 of the third series of television comedy series &quot;Father Ted&quot; is titled &quot;Speed 3&quot; and centers around the lustul behavior of milkman Pat Mustard, Ted&#x27;s feud with him, and the tragic outcome.

In Raymond Briggs&#x27; graphic novel &quot;Ethel and Ernest&quot;, based on the true story of Mr. Briggs&#x27; parents, Ernest Briggs, Raymond&#x27;s father, is described as being a milkman for the &quot;R.A.C.S&quot;.

<doc id="853697" wikidata="Q61044" url="?curid=853697" title="Albert of Saxony (philosopher)">
<text>Albert of Saxony (Latin: &quot;Albertus de Saxonia&quot;; c. 1320 – 8 July 1390) was a German philosopher and mathematician known for his contributions to logic and physics. He was bishop of Halberstadt from 1366 until his death.

==Life==
Albert was born at Rickensdorf near Helmstedt, the son of a farmer in a small village. Due to his talent, he was sent to study at the University of Prague and the University of Paris.

At Paris, he became a Master of Arts (a professor), and held this post from 1351 until 1362. He also studied theology at the College of Sorbonne, although without receiving a degree. In 1353, he was rector of the University of Paris. After 1362, Albert went to the court of Pope Urban V in Avignon as an envoy of Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria to negotiate the founding of the University of Vienna. The negotiations were successful, and Albert became the first rector in 1365.

In 1366, Albert was elected bishop of Halberstadt (counted as Albert III), the diocese in which he was born. As bishop, he allied himself with Magnus with the Necklace, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, against Gerhard of Berg, Bishop of Hildesheim, and was taken prisoner by Gerhard in the battle of Dinckler in 1367.

He died at Halberstadt in 1390.

==Philosophy==
Albert was a pupil of Jean Buridan and his thoughts were shaped by Buridan&#x27;s teachings on physics and logic. As a natural philosopher, he contributed to the spread of Parisian natural philosophy throughout Italy and central Europe. Similar to Buridan, Albert combined critical analysis of language with epistemological pragmatism. Albert distinguishes, as his teacher did, between what is absolutely impossible or contradictory and what is impossible “in the common course of nature” and considers hypotheses under circumstances that are not naturally possible but imaginable given God&#x27;s absolute power. He was later regarded as one of the principal adherents of nominalism, along with his near contemporaries at Paris, namely Buridan and Marsilius of Inghen. The subsequent wide circulation of Albert&#x27;s work made him a better-known figure in some areas than contemporaries like Buridan and Nicole Oresme.

Albert&#x27;s work in logic was in part an extension of William of Ockham&#x27;s commentaries on the &quot;logica vetus&quot; (i. e. on Porphyry, and Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Categoriae&quot; and &quot;De interpretatione&quot;) which were made the subject of a series of works called &quot;Quaestiones&quot; by Albert.

Albert of Saxony&#x27;s teachings on logic and metaphysics were extremely influential. The theory of impetus introduced a third stage to the two stage theory of John Philoponus.

# Initial stage. Motion is in a straight line in direction of impetus which is dominant while gravity is insignificant
# Intermediate stage. Path begins to deviate downwards from straight line as part of a great circle as air resistance slows projectile and gravity recovers.
# Last stage. Gravity alone draws projectile downwards vertically as all impetus is spent.

This theory was a precursor to the modern theory of inertia.

Although Buridan remained the predominant figure in logic, Albert&#x27;s &quot;Perutilis logica&quot; (c. 1360) was destined to serve as a popular text because of its systematic nature and also because it takes up and develops essential aspects of the Ockhamist position. Albert accepted Ockham&#x27;s conception of the nature of a sign. Albert believed that signification rests on a referential relation of the sign to the individual thing, and that the spoken sign depends for its signification on the conceptual sign. Albert followed Ockham in his conception of universals and in his theory of supposition. Specifically, Albert preserved Ockham&#x27;s notion of simple supposition, understood as the direct reference of a term to the concept on which it depends when it signifies an extra-mental thing. Albert followed Ockham in his theory of categories and contrary to Buridan, refused to treat quantity as a feature of reality in its own right, but rather reduced it to a disposition of substance and quality. Albert established signification through a referential relation to a singular thing defining the relation of the spoken to conceptual signs as a relation of subordination. Albert&#x27;s treatment of relation was highly original. Although, like Ockham, he refused to construe relations as things distinct from absolute entities, he clearly ascribed them to an act of the soul by which absolute entities are compared and placed in relation to each other. He therefore completely rejected certain propositions Ockham had admitted reasonable, even if he did not construe them in the same way.

Albert&#x27;s voluminous collection of &quot;Sophismata&quot; (c. 1359) examined various sentences that raise difficulties of interpretation due to the presence of syncategorematic terms such as quantifiers and certain prepositions, which, according to medieval logicians, do not have a proper and determinate signification but rather modify the signification of the other terms in the propositions in which they occur. In his &quot;Sophismata,&quot; he followed William Heytesbury. In his analysis of epistemic verbs or of infinity, Albert admitted that a proposition has its own signification, which is not that of its terms: just like a syncategorematic term, a proposition signifies a &quot;mode of a thing&quot;. Albert made use of the idea of the distinguishable signification of the proposition in defining truth and in dealing with “insolubles” or paradoxes of self-reference. In this work he shows that since every proposition, by its very form, signifies that it is true, an insoluble proposition will turn out to be false because it will signify at once both that it is true and that it is false.

Albert also authored commentaries on &quot;Ars Vetus&quot;, a set of twenty-five &quot;Quaestiones logicales&quot; (c. 1356) that involved semantical problems and the status of logic, and &quot;Quaestiones&quot; on the &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot;. Albert explored in a series of disputed questions the status of logic and semantics, as well as the theory of reference and truth. Albert was influenced by English logicians and was influential in the diffusion of terminist logic in central Europe. Albert is considered a major contributor in his theory of consequences, found in his &quot;Perutilis Logica&quot;. Albert took a major step forward in the medieval theory of logical deduction.

However, it was his commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Physics&quot; that was especially widely read. Many manuscripts of it can be found in France and Italy, in Erfurt and Prague. Albert&#x27;s &quot;Physics&quot; basically guaranteed the transmission of the Parisian tradition to Italy, where it was authoritative along with the works of Heytesbury and John Dumbleton. His commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;De caelo&quot; was also influential, eventually eclipsing Buridan&#x27;s commentary on this text. Blasius of Parma read it in Bologna between 1379 and 1382. A little later, it enjoyed a wide audience at Vienna. His &quot;Treatise on Proportions&quot; was often quoted in Italy where, in addition to the texts of Thomas Bradwardine and Oresme, it influenced the application of the theory of proportions to motion.

Albert&#x27;s commentaries on the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; and the &quot;Economics&quot; also survive (both unedited), as well as several short mathematical texts, most notably &quot;Tractatus proportionum&quot; (c. 1353). Although Albert studied theology in Paris, no theological writing survived.

Albert played an essential role in the diffusion throughout Italy and central Europe of Parisian ideas which bore the mark of Buridan&#x27;s teachings, but which were also clearly shaped by Albert&#x27;s own grasp of English innovations. At the same time, Albert was not merely a compiler of the work of others. Rather, he constructed proofs of undeniable originality on many topics in logic and physics.

<text>Words And Music is an album recorded by Paul Kelly and originally released in 1998.

==Description==
The album was released on Mushroom Records in Australia and Vanguard Records in the United States. It peaked at 17 in Australia and 44 in New Zealand and was certified gold.

Kelly was nominated and won an ARIA Award in the category Best Male Artist for &quot;Words and Music&quot; in 1998.

==Songs==
The US release included one additional track, &quot;How to Make Gravy&quot;, which was released as a separate Extended Play prior to the release of &quot;Words and Music&quot; in Australia and was nominated as Song of the Year at the 1997 Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) Awards.

The song &quot;Little Kings&quot; begins &quot;I’m so afraid for my country, There’s an ill wind blowing no good, So many lies in the name of history&quot; and includes the lyrics:

The title was used for the feature-length documentary film, &quot;Land of the Little Kings&quot;, which tells the stories of Indigenous children affected by being forcibly removed from their families, through the stories of Archie Roach and Ruby Hunter, and the song is sung by Roach in the film.

<doc id="853715" wikidata="Q195544" url="?curid=853715" title="Squeeze (Squeeze album)">
<text>Squeeze is the debut studio album released by English group Squeeze. The album title was simply &quot;Squeeze&quot; in the United Kingdom, but in the United States, Canada, Australia and other countries, the album, like the band, was marketed under the name U.K. Squeeze to avoid confusion with similarly-named American and Australian groups.

The LP was produced by John Cale, except for &quot;Take Me I&#x27;m Yours&quot; and &quot;Bang Bang&quot; (also the only singles released from the LP). Those songs were produced by the band.

== Writing and recording ==
According to Glenn Tilbrook the process for making their first album was rewarding but also frustrating: &quot;For me, U.K. Squeeze wasn’t really very representative of what we were doing at the time. When we worked with John Cale in the studio, he threw out all the songs that we had written. When most bands make their first album, they go in and do a lot of stuff that’s been going down well in their sets; well, that wasn’t the case with us. He told us to write new songs – which we did. He was an inspirational guy to work with, but I felt that it was almost like we were writing for what he wanted rather than what the band itself was. When you’re in a position to be making a first album, it’s (A) awe-inspiring to be making an album, and (B) difficult to assert yourself against somebody who knows the ropes.&quot;

Chris Difford&#x27;s approach to writing the lyrics for the album was different as well. According to an interview with Bud Scoppa, Difford found the process of working with their producer John Cale to be challenging: &quot;I remember, he came up and said, &#x27;Lyrically, you’re quite soft; have you ever thought about writin’ about musclemen?&#x27; I said, &#x27;That’s never occurred to me, actually.&#x27; And he said, &#x27;Well, go away and do it – I wanna see songs like that on the album.&#x27; So my perception of what the band was at that point was completely different from the way he saw it, obviously. He had us doing some awfully strange things.&quot;

== Music ==
A record consisting of material written on the orders of producer John Cale, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that &quot;Squeeze&quot; had a &quot;chaotic&quot; sound. Robert Christgau described the record a &quot;hard rock&quot; effort.

== Release ==
The initial A&amp;M Canada and A&amp;M U.S. LP pressings were released on limited edition red vinyl.

In 1997, the CD was released in the UK with two bonus tracks, as part of the &quot;Six of One...&quot; box set. The set included the band&#x27;s first six studio albums, each digitally remastered. These CDs were made available for individual purchase in 1998.

In 2007, the album was digitally remastered and released in Japan. It contains 4 bonus tracks, one of which is a single edit of Take Me I&#x27;m Yours. The other bonus tracks are taken from B-sides from the singles of the album. It also contains the bonus tracks from the 1997 re-release.

==Critical reception ==

&quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;Musically, the instrumental is the only boring cut on the whole first side, but the record as a whole is a case study in excitingly adequate hard rock craftsmanship spoiled by trashy literature. When a band obviously influenced by &quot;Queen&quot;, &quot;Rock Scene&quot;, muscle mags, and boarding-school porn finishes off by advising their postpunk admirers to &#x27;get smart,&#x27; it sounds like they want &#x27;em to stop reading &quot;Hustler&quot; and start reading &quot;Oui&quot;.&quot;

The album received a negative retrospective review from Allmusic, who said that producer John Cale forced Squeeze to pursue a musical direction that ran contrary to their inclinations. They singled out the two tracks produced by the band themselves as the only ones which show any sign of the artistic success they would later reach.

<text>Hidden Things is an album by Australian folk rock group Paul Kelly &amp; the Messengers released in March 1992 on Mushroom Records, which reached No. 29 on the ARIA Albums Chart. It also reached the Top 40 on the New Zealand Albums Chart. It is a collection of tracks recorded by Kelly and both his backing bands, the Coloured Girls and the Messengers, from 1986 to 1991, but were not issued on previous studio albums (except for &quot;Bradman&quot; and &quot;Pastures of Plenty&quot;). The album spawned a single, &quot;When I First Met Your Ma&quot;, which was released in March. Messenger band members provide lead vocals on &quot;Hard Times&quot; from its writer Steve Connolly, and &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Soul&quot; from its writer Jon Schofield. &quot;Sweet Guy Waltz&quot; is a slower version of &quot;Sweet Guy&quot; which was on 1989&#x27;s &quot;So Much Water So Close to Home&quot;. The album was re-released in 2011 as &quot;Hidden Things: B-sides &amp; Rarities&quot;.

==Background==

Paul Kelly &amp; the Messengers gave their last performance in August 1991, with Kelly set to pursue a solo career. He justified his decision: &quot;We forged a style together. But I felt if we had kept going it would have got formulaic and that&#x27;s why I broke it up. I wanted to try and start moving into other areas, start mixing things up&quot;. To round out their career, Kelly organised &quot;Hidden Things&quot; to collect previously released B-sides, stray non-LP tracks, radio sessions, and other rarities recorded from 1986 to 1991. Except for &quot;Bradman&quot; and &quot;Pastures of Plenty&quot;, the tracks had not appeared on earlier albums by Paul Kelly &amp; the Coloured Girls or Paul Kelly &amp; the Messengers.

The album was issued in March 1992, after the group had been disbanded, and reached No. 29 on the ARIA Albums Chart. In May Kelly recorded a set of solo performances which were later released as a double live album, &quot;Live, May 1992&quot;.

==Composition and recording==

Tracks for &quot;Hidden Things&quot; were recorded between 1986 (by Paul Kelly &amp; the Coloured Girls) to September 1991 (by Paul Kelly &amp; the Messengers). The line-up of both bands was: Michael Barclay on drums and backing vocals; Peter Bull on keyboards; Steve Connolly on lead guitar (lead vocals on &quot;Hard Times&quot;); Kelly on guitar, lead vocals (except &quot;Hard Times&quot;, &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Soul&quot;) and harmonica; and Jon Schofield on bass guitar. The album includes a cover version of Australian Crawl&#x27;s 1983 number-one hit, &quot;Reckless&quot; which was recorded in 1988 and originally released by Paul Kelly &amp; the Coloured Girls as part of the 1989 &quot;Dumb Things&quot; double single. The lead single from the album, &quot;When I First Met Your Ma&quot;, describes Kelly&#x27;s courting of his first wife Hilary Brown – they met at the Kingston Hotel during an early gig by his band The Dots and were introduced by Kelly&#x27;s then-girlfriend, Juliet. &quot;Sweet Guy Waltz&quot; is a slower version of &quot;Sweet Guy&quot; which was issued as a single from 1989&#x27;s &quot;So Much Water So Close to Home&quot;.

In 1984 Kelly met Connolly when the latter was a member of The Cuban Heels, the pair would jam together, and were sometimes joined by Connolly&#x27;s friend Barclay. &quot;Hard Times&quot; was written and had lead vocals by Connolly. &quot;Other People&#x27;s Houses&quot; describes a female house cleaner who takes along her son who observes the residents&#x27; opulence. &quot;Special Treatment&quot; deals with neglect of Indigenous Australians amid claims &quot;by a Western Australian pastoralist that Aborigines receive better treatment than other Australians&quot;. &quot;Rally Around the Drum&quot;, was written by Kelly with Archie Roach, and was about an indigenous tent boxing man. &quot;Pastures of Plenty&quot; is a cover of a Woody Guthrie folk song. During the late 1980s, Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls often toured with folk rockers Weddings Parties Anything, and both groups combined for &quot;Beggar on the Streets of Love&quot;, which was recorded live in the studio of Perth radio station 96fm by Steve Gordon and Bob Vogt. This live version appeared as the B-side on the 1990 single &quot;Most Wanted Man in the World&quot;. The song had already been covered by Jenny Morris as &quot;Street of Love&quot; in December 1989.

In 1985, Kelly issued his debut solo album, &quot;Post&quot;, which spawned the single, &quot;From St Kilda to Kings Cross&quot;. A re-recorded version by Paul Kelly &amp; the Messengers was used for the B-side of their 1991 single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Start Me Talking&quot;, and appears on this album. &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Soul&quot; has lead vocals performed by its writer Schofield. &quot;Yil Lull&quot; is a cover version of Joe Geia&#x27;s 1988 song. &quot;Bradman&quot; describes the cricketer, Don Bradman, and was issued as a double-A single in January 1987 with &quot;Leaps and Bounds&quot; from the 1986 album &quot;Gossip&quot;. &quot;Elly&quot; is a cover of Kev Carmody&#x27;s song from Carmody&#x27;s 1990 album, &quot;Eulogy (For a Black Person)&quot;, which was produced by Connolly. Carmody and Kelly co-wrote &quot;From Little Things Big Things Grow&quot;, which appeared on Paul Kelly &amp; the Messengers&#x27; 1991 album, &quot;Comedy&quot; and on Carmody&#x27;s 1993 album, &quot;Bloodlines&quot;. The latter version was issued as a single in that year.

==Reception==

AllMusic&#x27;s Mike DeGagne felt &quot;Hidden Things&quot; showed &quot;Paul&#x27;s genius for telling stories behind the jingle of his acoustic guitar is pure and plentiful throughout... [Kelly&#x27;s] story telling can be likened to Harry Chapin&#x27;s, except Kelly leaves more to the imagination, adding a sturdier foundation for pondering and analysis&quot;. &quot;Green Left Weekly&quot;″s Deb Sorensen found that Kelly is &quot;a very good songwriter who has avoided just churning out &#x27;pop&#x27; music. His lyrics are meaningful and from the heart ... songs which are close to the experiences and feelings of so many Australians without ever becoming jingoistic or banal&quot;.

The album reached No. 29 on the ARIA Albums Chart and also reached the Top 40 on the New Zealand Albums Chart.

<doc id="853723" wikidata="Q2618403" url="?curid=853723" title="Betty Edwards">
<text>Betty Edwards (born April 21, 1926) is an American art teacher and author best known for her 1979 book &quot;Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain&quot; (, in its 4th edition). She taught and did research at the California State University, Long Beach, until she retired in the late 1990s. While there, she founded the Center for the Educational Applications of Brain Hemisphere Research.

==Professional life==
Edwards received a bachelor of arts from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA, 1947), a master of arts from California State University, Northridge, and a doctorate in Art, Education, and Psychology from UCLA (1976).

&quot;Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain&quot; has remained the dominant book on its subject, used as a standard text in many art schools, and has been translated and published in many foreign languages, including French, Spanish, German, Polish, Hungarian, Chinese, and Japanese. Her company, Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, develops special drawing tools, materials, and videos to help individuals learn to draw.

A painter, she taught at high school level in the Los Angeles public school district (Venice High School), then at community college, and from 1978 until her retirement in 1991, in the art department at California State University, Long Beach. All of her teaching experience has been in art: drawing, painting, art history, art-teacher training, and color theory. In addition to teaching drawing workshops around the world, she has also done business consulting with major national and international corporations to enhance creative problem solving.

===Theories on drawing and brain function===
Edwards&#x27;s method of drawing and teaching was revolutionary when she published it in 1979. It received an immediate positive response, and is now widely accepted by artists, teachers, and others around the world. Underlying the method is the notion that the brain has two ways of perceiving and processing reality – one verbal and analytic, the other visual and perceptual. Edwards&#x27; method advocates suppressing the former in favor of the latter. It focuses on disregarding preconceived notions of what the drawn object should look like, and on individually &quot;seeing&quot;. Drawing, says Edwards, has five component skills of perception and drawing:

* Edges and lines (includes copying drawings and contour drawing exercises)
* Negative space (i.e. space between items)
* Relationships (i.e. perspective and proportion between things)
* Light and shadows (shading)
* The whole: &quot;gestalt&quot; which emerges as the first four are taught 
Then there are two additional skills, numbers 6 and 7:
* Drawing from memory
* Drawing from imagination

Edwards&#x27;s early work was based in part on her understanding of neuroscience, especially the cerebral hemisphere research which suggested that the two hemispheres of the brain have different functions. To avoid the so-called &quot;location controversy&quot; (how the two major cognitive functions are distributed in the individual brain depending on handedness and other factors), she termed the modes &quot;L-mode&quot; and &quot;R-mode.&quot; These designations appeared in the original 1979 edition of &quot;Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.&quot; She described L-mode as basically a verbal, analytic, sequential mode of thinking, and R-mode as basically visual, perceptual, and global.

==Bibliography==
Edwards&#x27; major publications include:

* Dual-coding theory
* Functional specialization (brain)
* Lateralization of brain function
* Roger Sperry

<doc id="853727" wikidata="Q16982296" url="?curid=853727" title="Good conduct loop">
<text>A good conduct knot/loop is an award device of the Department of the Army which denotes additional decorations of the Army Good Conduct Medal.

==History==
Good conduct loops were first created in 1941 and were based on the concept of the enlistment bar. Good Conduct Loops have remained the primary method of displaying multiple bestowals of the Army Good Conduct Medal, and may be said to show how many &quot;hitches&quot; a soldier has served.

Good conduct loops are worn on a clasp attached to the service ribbon and suspension ribbon of the Good Conduct Medal. A Good Conduct Loop comprises a clasp with several inscribed loops. The second award of a Good Conduct Medal would display a bronze clasp with two loops, the third would show a bronze clasp with three loops, and so on. At six loops, the clasp changes to silver, and then at eleven loops the clasp changes to gold. Thus, a silver clasp with two loops would denote the seventh award of the Good Conduct Medal while a gold clasp with five loops would indicate the fifteenth award of the Good Conduct Medal, which is the highest that the regulations list.

The Army Good Conduct Medal is the only one of the service Good Conduct awards which uses Good Conduct Loops. The U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard display additional Good Conduct awards with service stars, while the U.S. Air Force uses oak leaf clusters.

<doc id="853743" wikidata="Q7968166" url="?curid=853743" title="Wanted Man (Paul Kelly album)">
<text>Wanted Man is a folk rock album by Paul Kelly and was originally released in July 1994. It was issued on Mushroom Records in Australia and was Kelly&#x27;s first solo studio album after disbanding his previous group, The Messengers. Tracks 1–10 were recorded at three Los Angeles studios while tracks 11–13 were recorded in Melbourne. It was produced by Kelly, Randy Jacobs and David Bridie. The cover art for &quot;Wanted Man&quot; is a colophon rendering of Australia&#x27;s legendary outlaw Ned Kelly (no relation) as a guitarist and was painted by David Band.

The album peaked at No. 11 on the ARIA Albums Chart and resulted in Kelly being nominated for &#x27;Best Male Artist&#x27; at the ARIA Music Awards of 1995. Three singles were issued from the album, &quot;Song from the Sixteenth Floor&quot;, &quot;Love Never Runs on Time&quot; and &quot;God&#x27;s Hotel&quot; (co-written with Nick Cave) – but none reached the ARIA Singles Chart.

==Background==
Paul Kelly&#x27;s first solo studio album after disbanding Paul Kelly &amp; The Messengers was &quot;Wanted Man&quot;. The group had given their last performance in August 1991, and Kelly resumed his solo career. He justified his decision: &quot;We forged a style together. But I felt if we had kept going it would have got formulaic and that&#x27;s why I broke it up. I wanted to try and start moving into other areas, start mixing things up&quot;. Kelly&#x27;s first post-Messengers solo release was the live double CD &quot;Live, May 1992&quot;, released in November 1992. Kelly had already relocated to Los Angeles and signed with Vanguard Records to tour the US as a solo artist. While in Los Angeles he produced fellow Australian Renée Geyer&#x27;s album &quot;Difficult Woman&quot; (1994).

==Recording and composition==
In late 1992, when living in Los Angeles, Kelly recorded ten tracks for his next album, &quot;Wanted Man&quot;, at three studios: Stagg St, Clearlake and O&#x27;Henry. Kelly returned to Australia in 1993 and had a book collection of lyrics published, aptly titled &quot;Lyrics&quot;. In Melbourne he recorded three more tracks at the Metropolis Studio. The album was produced by Kelly, Randy Jacobs (member of Was (Not Was)) and David Bridie (produced My Friend the Chocolate Cake&#x27;s 1991 self-titled album). Jacobs and Kelly co-wrote &quot;Ball and Chain&quot;. The first track, &quot;Summer Rain&quot;, deals with a man&#x27;s yearning for his girlfriend, Kelly thought the sentiment would translate well but found a curious Belgian interviewer asked, &quot;But why would anybody long for rain in summer? ... We get enough rain in winter. We don&#x27;t want the summer rain. We want the sunshine&quot;. The lead single, &quot;Songs from the Sixteenth Floor&quot; was written by Kelly with John Clifforth of Deckchairs Overboard. The next single, &quot;Love Never Runs on Time&quot; was written by Kelly. The lyrics describe a truck driver struggling to meet his commitments to work and family. Kelly uses the same protagonist from &quot;To Her Door&quot; on 1987&#x27;s &quot;Under the Sun&quot; and then again in 1996&#x27;s &quot;How to Make Gravy&quot; from the extended play &quot;How to Make Gravy&quot;. In the first song, the man moves from being newly married to having children and problems with a drug addiction and undergoing rehab to returning to the family home. By the time of &quot;How to Make Gravy&quot;, the man is in prison for assault and is writing a letter to his brother for Christmas. In 2002 Debbie Kruger of Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) interviewed Kelly and found, &quot;Kelly’s attraction to the theatrical, however unconscious, has meant occasionally a song’s character will pop up again, sometimes unintentionally&quot;. Kelly conceded the three songs were linked, I’ve got a feeling it’s the same guy. He keeps coming back&#x27;. Maybe he’ll be in a happier place next time? &#x27;Yeah, he’s a bit of a fuck-up, that guy&#x27;, Kelly laughs&quot;.

The final single, &quot;God&#x27;s Hotel&quot; was co-written with Nick Cave. Kelly had read Cave&#x27;s book of lyrics, &quot;King Ink&quot; (1988), and found &quot;God&#x27;s Hotel&quot;. When interviewing Cave for a newspaper article in &quot;The Age&quot;, Kelly asked about the lyrics, Cave said &quot;It&#x27;s just a blues ... You can use the words if you want&quot;. Kelly only used five of twelve verses and adapted the tune from the chords of &quot;Bittersweet&quot; by Hoodoo Gurus. &quot;Everybody Wants to Touch Me&quot; describes how a pregnant woman becomes the object of curiosity, wonder or revulsion, although some believe the song relates to a celebrity being the centre of attention (see Paul Kapsis&#x27; cover version). In 2000 Kelly&#x27;s friend Deborah Conway recorded her version for &quot;The Women at the Well&quot; tribute album. Kelly noted &quot;I don&#x27;t like all covers of my songs but I have to say this one&#x27;s awesome. Absolutely&quot;. &quot;Lately&quot; was co-written with Geyer and followed their work on the soundtrack for the ABC-TV mini series &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins&quot;, Geyer and Kelly sang alongside Vika Bull and Conway for the 13 tracks. The cover art for &quot;Wanted Man&quot; is a colophon rendering of Australia&#x27;s legendary outlaw Ned Kelly (no relation) as a guitarist and was painted by David Band.

==Reception and charting==

&quot;Wanted Man&quot; peaked at No. 11 on the ARIA Albums Chart and resulted in Kelly being nominated for &#x27;Best Male Artist&#x27; at the ARIA Music Awards of 1995. Three singles were issued from the album, &quot;Song from the Sixteenth Floor&quot; (January 1994), &quot;Love Never Runs on Time&quot; (May) and &quot;God&#x27;s Hotel&quot; (September) – but none reached the ARIA Singles Chart.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Paul Corio observed that having Ned Kelly on the cover &quot;makes perfect sense. Keeping a low profile Down Under, Paul Kelly periodically emerges with albums that raid the storehouse of critical praise, then he retreats to mine poetic gold&quot;. Corio felt the music was &quot;folk, reggae, midtempo rock, jazz-inflected pop and hard-edged ballads – Kelly swings them all deftly&quot;. Allmusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann was less favourable and said &quot;[it] was familiar folk-rock, with Kelly singing romantic lyrics over acoustic and electric guitars and a rhythm section. &quot;Wanted Man&quot; was less ambitious lyrically than some of Kelly&#x27;s earlier albums&quot;.

<doc id="853744" wikidata="Q622550" url="?curid=853744" title="Trailer (promotion)">
<text>A trailer (also known as a preview, coming attraction, or attraction video) is a short advertisement, originally designed for a feature film, which highlights key scenes of upcoming features intended to be exhibited in the future at a movie theater or cinema. It is a product of creative and technical work.

Movie trailers have now become popular on DVDs and Blu-ray discs, as well as on the Internet, livestreaming and mobile devices. Of some 10 billion videos watched online annually, film trailers rank third, after news and user-created video.

The trailer format has been adopted as a promotional tool for television shows, video games, books, and theatrical events/concerts.

== History ==
The first trailer shown in an American film theater was in November 1913, when Nils Granlund, the advertising manager for the Marcus Loew theater chain, produced a short promotional film for the musical &quot;The Pleasure Seekers&quot;, opening at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway. As reported in a wire service story carried by the Lincoln, Nebraska &quot;Daily Star&quot;, the practice which Loew adopted was described as &quot;an entirely new and unique stunt&quot;, and that &quot;moving pictures of the rehearsals and other incidents connected with the production will be sent out in advance of the show, to be presented to the Loew&#x27;s picture houses and will take the place of much of the bill board advertising&quot;. Granlund was also first to introduce trailer material for an upcoming motion picture, using a slide technique to promote an upcoming film featuring Charlie Chaplin at Loew&#x27;s Seventh Avenue Theatre in Harlem in 1914.

Due to trailers initially being shown after, or &quot;trailing&quot;, the feature film, the term &quot;trailer&quot; was used to describe the promotion; despite it coming before, or &quot;previewing&quot;, the film it was promoting. This practice was found to be somewhat ineffective, often ignored by audiences who left immediately after the film. Later, exhibitors changed their practice so that trailers were only one part of the film program, which included cartoon shorts, newsreels, and serial adventure episodes. Today, more elaborate trailers and commercial advertisements have largely replaced other forms of pre-feature entertainment, and in major multiplex chains, about the first 20 minutes after the posted showtime is devoted to trailers.

Until the late 1950s, trailers were mostly created by National Screen Service and consisted of various key scenes from the film being advertised, often augmented with large, descriptive text describing the story, and an underscore generally pulled from studio music libraries. Most trailers had some form of narration, and those that did featured voices, a practice that would wane in the 2000s.

In the early 1960s, the face of motion picture trailers changed. Textless, montage trailers and quick-editing became popular, largely due to the arrival of the New Hollywood and techniques that were becoming increasingly popular in television. Among the trend setters were Stanley Kubrick with his montage trailers for &quot;Lolita&quot; (1962), &quot;Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb&quot; (1964), and &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968). Kubrick&#x27;s main inspiration for the &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; trailer was the short film &quot;Very Nice, Very Nice&quot; (1961) by Canadian film visionary Arthur Lipsett. Pablo Ferro, who pioneered the techniques Kubrick required as necessary elements for the success of his campaign, created the &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; trailer, as well as the award-winning trailer for &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971).

Many home videos contain trailers for other movies produced by the same company scheduled to be available shortly after the legal release of the video, so as not to spend money advertising the videos on TV. Most VHS tapes would play them at the beginning of the tape, but some VHS tapes contained previews at the end of the film or at both ends of the tape. VHS tapes that contained trailers at the end usually reminded the viewer to &quot;Stay tuned after the feature for more previews.&quot; With DVDs and Blu-rays, and live streaming and mobile devices, trailers can operate as a bonus feature instead of having to watch through the trailers before the film.

In summer 1993, the major movie studios started to make trailers available online with the Walt Disney Company providing promotions for &quot;Guilty as Sin&quot;, &quot;Life With Mikey&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; available to Macintosh users via CompuServe and Columbia Pictures posting a trailer for &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot; available for download to AOL subscribers.

 Beginning in the mid-to-late 2010s, many trailers have begun to incorporate a short 5- to 10-second preview of the trailer, sometimes called a &quot;micro-teaser&quot;, at the very beginning of the video for the trailer itself. This has been explained as being a way to grab the viewer&#x27;s attention quickly, so that they do not choose to skip the full trailer on streaming sites.

== Definition ==
Trailers consist of a series of selected shots from the film being advertised. Since the purpose of the trailer is to attract an audience to the film, these excerpts are usually drawn from the most exciting, funny, or otherwise noteworthy parts of the film but in abbreviated form and usually without producing spoilers. For this purpose the scenes are not necessarily in the order in which they appear in the film. A trailer has to achieve that in less than 2 minutes and 30 seconds, the maximum length allowed by the MPA. Each studio or distributor is allowed to exceed this time limit once a year, if they feel it is necessary for a particular film.

In January 2014, the movie theater trade group National Association of Theatre Owners issued an industry guideline asking that film distributors supply trailers that run no longer than two minutes, which is 30 seconds shorter than the prior norm. The guideline is not mandatory, and also allows for limited exceptions of a select few movies having longer trailers. Film distributors reacted coolly to the announcement. There had been no visible disputes on trailer running time prior to the guideline, which surprised many.

Some trailers use &quot;special shoot&quot; footage, which is material that has been created specifically for advertising purposes and does not appear in the actual film. The most notable film to use this technique was &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, whose trailer featured an elaborate special effect scene of a T-800 Terminator being assembled in a factory that was never intended to be in the film itself. Dimension Films also shot extra scenes for their 2006 horror remake, &quot;Black Christmas&quot; - these scenes were used in promotional footage for the film, but are similarly absent from the theatrical release. A trailer for the 2002 blockbuster &quot;Spider-Man&quot; had an entire action sequence especially constructed that involved escaping bank robbers in a helicopter getting caught in a giant web between the World Trade Center&#x27;s two towers. However, after the September 11 attacks the studio pulled it from theaters.

One of the most famous &quot;special shoot&quot; trailers is that used for the 1960s thriller &quot;Psycho&quot;, which featured director Alfred Hitchcock giving viewers a guided tour of the Bates Motel, eventually arriving at the infamous shower. At this point, the soft-spoken Hitchcock suddenly throws the shower curtain back to reveal Vera Miles with a blood-curdling scream. As the trailer, in fact, was made after completion of the film when Janet Leigh was no longer available for filming, Hitchcock had Miles don a blonde wig for the fleeting sequence. Since the title, &quot;Psycho&quot;, instantly covers most of the screen, the switch went unnoticed by audiences for years until freeze-frame analysis clearly revealed that it was Vera Miles and not Janet Leigh in the shower during the trailer.

In the United States there are dozens of companies, many of which are in Los Angeles and New York City, that specialize in the creation of film trailers. The trailer may be created at agencies (such as The Cimarron Group, MOJO, The Ant Farm, Ben Cain, Aspect Ratio, Flyer Entertainment, Trailer Park, Buddha Jones) while the film itself is being cut together at the studio. Since the edited film does not exist at this point, the trailer editors work from rushes or dailies. Thus, the trailer may contain footage that is not in the final movie, or the trailer editor and the film editor may use different takes of a particular shot. Another common technique is including music on the trailer which does not appear on the movie&#x27;s soundtrack. This is nearly always a requirement, as trailers and teasers are created long before the composer has even been hired for the film score—sometimes as much as a year ahead of the movie&#x27;s release date—while composers are usually the last creative people to work on the film.

Some trailers that incorporate material not in the film are particularly coveted by collectors, especially trailers for classic films. For example, in a trailer for &quot;Casablanca&quot; the character Rick Blaine says, &quot;OK, you asked for it!&quot; before shooting Major Strasser; this line of dialogue is not spoken in the final film.

== Accusations of misdirection ==
Over the years, there have been many instances where trailers have been purported to give misleading representations of their films. They may give the impression that a celebrity who only has a minor part in the film is one of the main cast members, or advertising a film as being more action-packed than it is. These tricks are usually done to draw in a larger audience. Sometimes the trailers include footage not from the film itself. This could be an artistic choice, or because many times, trailer editors are given dailies, basically individual clips, instead of a cut of the whole film. Often, the film is still in production while the trailer is in the works. While the intention is not to be misleading, due to the nature of dailies being easily replaced, sometimes certain shots that are present in the trailer are nowhere to be seen in the final film.
Furthermore, trailers could be misleading in a &#x27;for the audience&#x27;s own good&#x27; kind of way, in that a general audience would not usually see such a film due to preconceptions, and by bait and switching, they can allow the audience to have a great viewing experience that they would not ordinarily have. However, the opposite is true too, with the promise of great trailers being let down by mediocre films. An American woman sued the makers of &quot;Drive&quot; because their film &quot;failed to live up to its promo&#x27;s promise&quot;, although her lawsuit was dismissed. In August 2016, an American lawyer attempted to sue &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; for false advertising over lack of scenes including Joker.

== Composition ==
Trailers tell the story of a film in a highly condensed fashion to have maximum appeal. In the decades since film marketing has become a large industry, trailers have become highly polished pieces of advertising, able to present even poor movies in an attractive light. Some of the elements common to many trailers are listed below. Trailers are typically made up of scenes from the film they are promoting, but sometimes contain deleted scenes from the film.

The key ambition in trailer-making is to impart an intriguing story that gets film audiences emotionally involved.

Most trailers have a three-act structure similar to a feature-length film. They start with a beginning (act 1) that lays out the premise of the story. The middle (act 2) drives the story further and usually ends with a dramatic climax. Act 3 usually features a strong piece of &quot;signature music&quot; (either a recognizable song or a powerful, sweeping orchestral piece). This last act often consists of a visual montage of powerful and emotional moments of the film and may also contain a cast run if there are noteworthy stars that could help sell the movie.

Voice-over narration is sometimes used to briefly set up the premise of the film and provide explanation when necessary, although this practice has declined in the years after the passing of voice-over artist Don LaFontaine. Since the trailer is a highly condensed format, voice-over is a useful tool to enhance the audience&#x27;s understanding of the plot. Hollywood trailers of the classic film era were renowned for clichés such as &quot;Colossal!&quot;, &quot;Stupendous!&quot;, etc. Some trailers have used voice over clichés for satirical effect. This can be seen in trailers for films such as Jerry Seinfeld&#x27;s Comedian and Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny.

Music helps set the tone and mood of the trailer. Usually the music used in the trailer is not from the film itself (the film score may not have been composed yet). The music used in the trailer may be:

* Music from the score of other movies.
* Popular or well-known music, often chosen for its tone, appropriateness of a lyric or lack thereof, or recognizability. The most often used of these is &quot;O Fortuna&quot; from &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; by Carl Orff, as well as the works of E.S. Posthumus and Beethoven. Popular music may be selected for its tone (i.e. hard rock for an action film, lighter pop for a romantic comedy), or to establish context (e.g. the trailer for a film set in the 1940s might use big band swing).
* &quot;Library&quot; music previously composed specifically to be used in advertising by an independent composer. There are many trailer music library companies which produce trailer music, some of the best known are audiomachine, Two Steps From Hell, Immediate Music and X-Ray Dog or SFX and Music libraries like the ones from Moss Landing, Gerrit Kinkel Productions or RedCola Music.
* Specially composed music. One of the most famous Hollywood trailer music composers, credited with creating the musical voice of contemporary trailers, is John Beal, who began scoring trailers in the 1970s and, in the course of a thirty-year career, created original music for over 2,000 film trailer projects, including 40 of the top-grossing films of all time, such as &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, &quot;Titanic&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;Braveheart&quot;, &quot;Ghost&quot;, &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; and &quot;The Matrix&quot;. He is considered by the New York Times as the pioneer of original scores for film trailer music,

A &quot;cast run&quot; is a list of the stars that appear in the movie. If the director or producer is well-known or has made other popular movies, they often warrant a mention as well. Most trailers conclude with a billing block, which is a list of the principal cast and crew. It is the same list that appears on posters and print publicity materials, and also usually appears on-screen at the beginning (or end) of the movie. Studio production logos are usually featured near the beginning of the trailer. Until the late 1970s, they were put only at the end of the trailer or not used at all; however, Paramount Pictures was the first studio to use its actual studio logo at the beginning of its trailers in the 1940s. Often there will be logos for both the production company and distributor of the film.

Many trailers are mixed in Dolby Digital or any other multichannel sound mix. Scenes including sound effects and music that are enhanced by stereophonic sound are therefore the focus point of many modern trailers.

Trailers preceding feature films are generally presented in the same format as the feature, being either 35 mm film or a digital format. High bandwidth internet connections allow for trailers to be distributed online at any resolution. Since the advent of Digital 3D, it has become common for a 3D feature film to be preceded by one or more trailers that are also presented in 3D.

One relatively recent trend among trailers is the incorporation of &quot;bumpers&quot;, which are very short fast-paced edits placed at the beginning of the trailer that give a small tease of what will be shown. Due to the spike of short videos across social media, bumpers are intended to grab the viewer&#x27;s attention quickly so they keep watching the whole trailer.

== Collections ==
National Screen Service contracts required that trailers be returned (at the cinema&#x27;s expense) or destroyed; however, it required no proof of destruction, and depositing them in a waste bin counted. A market for trailers evolved as it became clear that some had a commercial value to collectors. Many of the trailers for films like the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series reported as &#x27;destroyed&#x27; were taken back out of the bin and sold by cinema staff. As they cost about $60 each to make (1981 estimate) and were hired to the cinema for $10, such losses led to NSS increasing its rental charges, which led to a decrease in the number of trailers rented and shown to audiences.

Some cinemas also began to show &quot;trailer trash&quot; programs of trailers without a main feature. Similarly, several DVDs containing nothing but trailers for films, typically from exploitation film genres, have been produced for sale.

== Other types of trailers ==
Beginning in the late 1990s to early 2000s, and along with the development of the Internet and sites such as YouTube as well as animation techniques, more types of trailers began to be created due to easier and cheaper costs to produce and show trailers.

=== Video game trailers ===
In the late 1990s to early 2000s, more video game trailers have been produced as they become more mainstream to entice viewers to purchase the game. There are two main types of video game trailers: cinematic and gameplay. Cinematic trailers are usually made entirely separate from the game engine and rely more on CGI. Even though cinematic trailers do not represent actual gameplay and are a divisive promotional tool in the gaming community, they are commonly accepted as part of the advertising necessary to get a game to sell. Gameplay trailers, sometimes referred to as &quot;in-engine&quot; trailers, are made using the game engine and take place inside the game&#x27;s actual environment. In theory, this implies that actual game footage is recorded and acts as a &quot;what you see is what you get&quot; demonstration, though it is not always the case. For example, &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot; failed to deliver multiple features it had included in trailers, and the trailer for &quot;&quot; featured graphics that were of a higher standard than the game that was eventually sold.

=== TV spots ===

TV spots are trailers for movies shown on television that are often shortened to 30–60 seconds. These trailers are similar to green band trailers and have content &quot;appropriate&quot; for the channel.

=== TV show trailers ===

While not initially prevalent in television, TV show trailers started as a common form of advertisement in the late 2000s. They are often trailers advertising a new TV series, episode, event or marathon premiering on television. Trailers for the next episode of a TV series are often shown during or following the closing credits of the show.

=== Book trailer ===
A book trailer is a video advertisement for a book which employs techniques similar to those of movie trailers to promote books and encourage readers. These trailers can also be referred to as &quot;video-podcasts&quot;, with higher quality trailers being called &quot;cinematic book trailers&quot;. They are circulated on television and online in most common digital video formats. Common formats of book trailers include actors performing scenes from the book akin to a movie trailer, full production trailers, flash videos, animation or simple still photos set to music with text conveying the story. This differs from author readings and interviews, which consist of video footage of the author narrating a portion of their writing or being interviewed. Early book trailers consisted mostly of still images of the book, with some videos incorporating actors, with John Farris&#x27;s book trailer for his 1986 novel &quot;Wildwood&quot; incorporating images from the book cover along with actors such as John Zacherle.

In September 2007, the &quot;School Library Journal&quot; established the Trailie Award for the best book trailers. There are three categories: author/publisher created, student created and librarian/adult created. The award was announced at the &quot;School Library Journal&quot; Leadership Summit on the Future of Reading on October 22, 2010, in Chicago.

In 2014, Dan Rosen and CV Herst established BookReels, a website dedicated to allowing publishers and authors to post book trailers and other multimedia, culminating in the annual BookReels Awards. BookReels lets readers browse and rate trailers, post comments and reviews, join discussion groups, and share BookReel discoveries.

Cinematic book trailers have become standard marketing tools used by publishers to promote more commercial titles or novels with film potential.

=== Fan-made trailers ===
For popular movies, fans often make trailers on their own. These are unofficial videos by fans utilizing audio or video of a movie, studio trailer, animation techniques, or fan-acted scenes replacing the video of the official trailer.

== Awards ==
Every year there are two main events that give awards to outstanding film trailers: The Key Art Awards, presented by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, and the Golden Trailer Awards. The Golden Trailer Awards and the Key Art Awards pick winners in all creative parts of film advertising, from trailers and TV spots to posters and print ads. The Golden Trailer Awards are currently expanding to add a sister event, The World Trailer Awards, to be a kickoff to the Cannes Film Festival in France, 2013. The yearly Key Art Awards ceremony is often held at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood. &quot;The Film Informant&quot; also recognizes movie marketing media and held the first annual TFI Awards in early January 2012. The site is the first to officially start recognizing and rating movie marketing media on a daily basis.

<text>The Good Conduct Medal is one of the oldest military awards of the United States Armed Forces. The U.S. Navy&#x27;s variant of the Good Conduct Medal was established in 1869, the Marine Corps version in 1896, the Coast Guard version in 1923, the Army version in 1941, and the Air Force version in 1963; the Air Force Good Conduct Medal was temporarily discontinued from February 2006 to February 2009, followed by its subsequent reinstatement.

==Criteria==
The criteria for a Good Conduct Medal are defined by Executive Orders 8809, 9323, and 10444. The Good Conduct Medal, each one specific to one of the six branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, is currently awarded to any active duty enlisted member of the United States military who completes three consecutive years of &quot;honorable and faithful service,&quot; or the initial term of enlistment if less than three years. Such service implies that a standard enlistment was completed without any non-judicial punishment, disciplinary infractions, or court martial offenses. If a service member commits an offense, the three-year mark &quot;resets&quot; and a service member must perform an additional three years of service without having to be disciplined, before the Good Conduct may be authorized.

During times of war, the Good Conduct Medal may be awarded for one year of faithful service. The Good Conduct Medal may also be awarded posthumously, to any enlisted service member who dies in the line of duty.

===Reserve components===
Service for the Good Conduct Medal must be performed on active duty; with two exceptions, it is not awarded to enlisted members of the military reserve components, including the Army National Guard and Air National Guard, for inactive part-time (e.g., &quot;drilling&quot;) reserve duty or full-time Army Reserve Technician or Air Reserve Technician (ART) status, although enlisted reservists and national guardsmen are eligible if they complete sufficient active service via mobilization to active duty. This restriction does not apply to full-time active duty enlisted members in the Reserve Component, such as Army and Air Force personnel in an Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) status, Navy personnel in a Full Time Support (FTS), previously known as Training &amp; Administration of the Reserve (TAR), and Marine Corps Active Reserve (AR) programs.

On 1 January 2014, the Navy discontinued the Naval Reserve Meritorious Service Medal, a &quot;de facto&quot; Good Conduct Medal for Navy Reserve (formerly Naval Reserve) enlisted personnel. Since that date, all Navy enlisted personnel have received the Navy Good Conduct Medal, whether in a full-time active duty or a part-time drilling reserve status.

The various services have established separate Reserve Good Conduct Medals, albeit under various names, as a comparable award available to enlisted Reserve and National Guard members who satisfactorily perform annual training, drill duty and any additional active duty of less than 3 consecutive years duration. The exception, as previously stated, is the United States Navy, which discontinued that service&#x27;s separate award for Reserve Component enlisted personnel as of 1 January 2014. Enlisted Navy Reservists now earn time towards the Navy Good Conduct Medal, the same as the Active Component (e.g., Regular Navy) and any time previously earned towards an unawarded Naval Reserve Meritorious Service Medal is automatically carried over to the Navy Good Conduct Medal.

==Navy Good Conduct Medal==
The Navy Good Conduct Medal is the oldest Good Conduct Medal, dating back to 26 April 1869. There have been a total of four versions of the Navy Good Conduct Medal, the first version of which was issued from 1870 to 1884. The original Navy Good Conduct Medal was also not worn on a uniform, but issued with discharge papers as a badge to present during reenlistment. A sailor in the Navy received a new Good Conduct Medal for each honorable enlistment completed.

The second version of the Navy Good Conduct Medal was issued between 1880 and 1884. The medal was considered a &quot;transitional decoration&quot; and was the first of the Good Conduct Medals to be worn on a uniform. The medal was phased out by 1885 and a new medal issued between 1885 and 1961. The new medal was a Good Conduct medallion suspended from an all-red ribbon. Enlistment bars, denoting each honorable enlistment completed, were pinned on the ribbon as attachments.

There was slight oddity during the Spanish–American War when the Navy created the Specially Meritorious Service Medal which also had an all-red suspension and service ribbon. There were recorded cases of Navy enlisted personnel who were awarded both the Good Conduct Medal and the Specially Meritorious Service Medal who wore two red service ribbons on their Navy service uniforms. This is one of the rare times in the history of U.S. military awards that two awards had identical ribbons.

In the 1950s bronze and silver 3/16-inch stars, with one silver star worn in lieu of five bronze stars (e.g., six awards), replaced the enlistment bars. Although the medal itself had not changed since 1884, in 1961 a ring suspension for the ribbon and medal combination was adopted, differentiating the suspension from its Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal counterpart and standardizing it with the majority of other service medals. It is this 1961 version of the Navy Good Conduct Medal that is still in use today.
The current Navy Good Conduct Medal is issued to every active-duty enlisted sailor who completes three years of honorable and faithful service since 1 January 1996. For prior awards to personnel between 1 November 1963 and 1 January 1996, four years of service were required. The four-year requirement also applies for award of the Navy Good Conduct Medal from its original establishment until 1 November 1963.

Additional awards of the Navy Good Conduct Medal are denoted by bronze and silver 3/16-inch stars; silver stars are worn in place of five bronze ones. The reverse side of the medal has three words, &quot;FIDELITY ZEAL OBEDIENCE&quot; superimposed in a semicircle. Upon 12 years of service, sailors are also allowed to wear gold-colored version of their petty officer insignia, something usually seen with those with the rate of chief petty officer or petty officer first class and above, but occasionally petty officer second class. Prior to June 2019, those 12 years had to be infraction-free. It is extremely rare in the contemporary U.S. Navy, but provisions do allow for sailors rated petty officer third class to wear gold rate insignia, provided they meet the same requirements.

==Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal==

The Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal was established on 20 July 1896. The medal was originally a ribbon and medal suspended from a clasp bearing the words &quot;U.S. Marine Corps&quot;. The clasp was eliminated after 1935 and the medal has remained unchanged in appearance since that time. Since its inception in 1896, the name of the recipient was engraved by hand on the reverse side of the medal until stamping the name on the medal began during World War II (numbered on the rim) and was done completely by 1951.

Prior to 10 December 1945, four years of honorable creditable enlisted service was required in the Marine Corps for award of the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal. After 10 December 1945, the required period of service was reduced to three years. Since that latter date, members of the Marine Corps must have three consecutive years of honorable and faithful service in order to be eligible for the medal.

In 1953, the Marine Corps adopted bronze and silver 3/16-inch service stars to denote additional awards of the Good Conduct Medal, replacing enlistment bars showing each honorable period of service.

=== Notable recipients ===
* JD Vance: United States Senator from Ohio and 2024 Republican Vicepresidency Candidate

==Coast Guard Good Conduct Medal==
The Coast Guard Good Conduct Medal (CGGCM) was authorized by the Commandant of the Coast Guard on 18 May 1921, but not designed until 1923 and originally used enlistment bars as attachments, in the same manner as the Marine Corps and Navy Good Conduct Medals. In 1966, the Coast Guard began using bronze and silver 3/16-inch service stars to denote additional awards of the Coast Guard Good Conduct Medal. Originally, the service requirement for the CGGCM was four continuous years of service. Starting on 1 July 1983, the service requirement was reduced to three years.

==Army Good Conduct Medal==

The Army Good Conduct Medal was established by , dated 28 June 1941, and authorized the award for soldiers completing three years active service after that date.

The criteria were amended by , dated 31 March 1943, to authorize the award for enlisted soldiers having three years of service after 27 August 1940 or one year of service after 7 December 1941 while the United States is at war.

, dated 10 April 1953, revised the criteria to authorize the award for soldiers having three years of service after 27 August 1940; one year of service after 7 December 1941 while the United States is at war; and for soldiers having the first award for service after 27 June 1950 upon termination of service, for periods less than three years, but more than one year. An initial award of the Good Conduct Medal can also be awarded to soldiers with less than one year of service if the soldier was discharged due to an injury sustained in the line of duty or if died in service.

*The medal was designed by Mr. Joseph Kiselewski and approved by the Secretary of War on 30 October 1942.

::The eagle, with wings spread, denotes vigilance and superiority.
::The horizontal sword denotes loyalty,
::The book represents knowledge acquired and ability gained.
::On the reverse, the lone star denotes merit.
::The wreath of laurel and oak leaves denotes reward and strength.
*The second and subsequent awards are indicated by the wear of the clasp with loops on the ribbon.

::Bronze clasps indicate the second (two loops) through fifth award (five loops);
::Silver clasps indicate sixth (one loop) through tenth award (five loops); and
::Gold clasps indicate eleventh (one loop) through the fifteenth award (five loops).

Officially, the Good Conduct Medal is awarded for exemplary behavior, efficiency, and fidelity in active Federal Military service. It is awarded on a selective basis to each soldier who distinguishes himself/herself from among his/her fellow soldiers by their exemplary conduct, efficiency, and fidelity throughout a specified period of continuous enlisted active Federal military service. Qualifying periods of service include each three years completed after 27 August 1940 or, for first award only, upon completion of at least one year upon termination of service if separated prior to three years. Also for the first award only, for those individuals who died before completing one year of active Federal military service if the death occurred in the line of duty. The immediate commander must approve the award and the award must be announced in permanent orders.

The &quot;loops&quot; indicating subsequent awards were called &quot;hitches&quot;, a &quot;hitch&quot; being three years of service. During the Vietnam War it was known as the &quot;Dentyne wrapper&quot; (chewing gum brand) owing to it being red and white like the medal&#x27;s suspension ribbon.

==Air Force Good Conduct Medal==
The medal was authorized by Congress on 6 July 1960, but not created until 1 June 1963. Air Force personnel were issued the Army Good Conduct Medal between 1947 and 1963 and for those serving both before and after 1963, the Army and Air Force Good Conduct Medals could be worn simultaneously on an Air Force uniform.

The Air Force version is the same as the Army version, except that the suspension and service ribbons for the medals are different for each medal. The Air Force Good Conduct Medal has remained unchanged in appearance since its original design over fifty years ago. Additional awards of the Air Force Good Conduct Medal are denoted by bronze or silver oak leaf clusters.

The criteria for award of the Air Force Good Conduct medal are as follows: It is awarded to Air Force enlisted personnel during a three-year period of active military service or for a one-year period of service during a time of war. Those airmen who were awarded this medal must have had character and efficiency ratings of excellent or higher throughout the qualifying period including time spent in attendance at service schools, and there must have been no convictions of court martial or non-judicial punishment during this period.

In October 2005, the 97th Air Force Uniform Board met and considered discontinuing the Good Conduct Medal with the rationale that good conduct of airmen is the expected standard, not an exceptional occurrence worthy of recognition. The decision was finalized on 8 February 2006 and the medal was no longer issued. Those airmen who had previously earned the Good Conduct Medal were still authorized to wear it. By May 2008, however, Air Force officials began reconsidering the policy. On 11 February 2009, the medal was reinstated and made retroactive to 8 February 2006, with all eligible recipients being awarded the medal automatically.

==Space Force Good Conduct Medal==
The Space Force has a Good Conduct Medal that was approved for wear as of September 25, 2023. Prior to this date, enlisted Space Force members were awarded the Air Force Good Conduct Medal.

<doc id="853749" wikidata="Q6558273" url="?curid=853749" title="Lisa Miller (singer-songwriter)">
<text>Lisa Anne Miller is an Australian country pop singer-songwriter and guitarist. She has issued seven albums, &quot;Quiet Girl with a Credit Card&quot; (1996), &quot;As Far as a Life Goes&quot; (1999), &quot;Car Tape&quot; (2002), &quot;Version Originale&quot; (2003), &quot;Morning in the Bowl of Night&quot; (2007), &quot;Car Tape 2&quot; (2010) and &quot;Meet the Misses&quot; (2012). She has a clear, bitter-sweet voice and provides poignant semi-biographical lyrics. At the ARIA Music Awards she has been nominated nine times.

== Biography ==
Lisa Miller is the daughter of social realist painter, Peter Miller, and grew up in the Melbourne suburb of Chadstone with her elder brother Lewis Miller (born 1959), who is also a painter, and a younger brother Paul Miller. Lewis won the 1998 Archibald Prize. Miller started writing songs at fourteen and has memories of being in a folk music duo with a friend, Tracey, &quot;I played flute, she played guitar and sang, and we wore matching paisley dresses that went to the floor, and played at coffee houses where people drank hot chocolates with marshmallows.&quot; Tracey later married Miller&#x27;s brother Paul to become Tracey Miller, and, as from 2005, was also a country music singer-songwriter.

While working as a secondary school teacher, Miller&#x27;s first rock group were the Hepeleptics, in 1986. She became vocalist and rhythm guitarist for the Whole Shebang in the following year. Miller wrote their track, &quot;Another Sunday Morning&quot;, which appeared on a various artists&#x27; compilation album, &quot;The Preston Story, Vol. 1&quot;, in 1995 via Canetoad Records. She also sang in the Everlovin&#x27; O&#x27;Sheas, with Andy Baylor, Rick O&#x27;Shea and Warren Rough in 1988. In 1989 she travelled to the United States to hear music in Memphis, Nashville, Austin, New Orleans and San Francisco.

Miller returned to Melbourne in 1990 and re-joined Baylor in the Prestones, alongside Steve Mander, Victor O&#x27;Neill, Graeme Thomas and Gary Young. She formed her own roots rock band, the Trailblazers (1990–91), on lead vocals with Mark Ferrie (ex-Models, Sacred Cowboys) on bass guitar, Nick Grant on guitar, Martin Lubran on pedal steel guitar and Tony Thornton on drums. Miller and Ferrie renamed the group as Truckasaurus in 1993 with additional members, Ed Bates on guitar and Graham Lee on pedal steel guitar. They favoured original material by Miller or Ferrie and issued a self-titled album in 1993 before Miller left to be replaced by Kaarin Fairfax on lead vocals in 1994.

In 1994 Miller went solo and released two extended plays on the In-Law label: &quot;Do That for You&quot; (May 1995) and &quot;All Worked Out&quot; (November). The first EP had four tracks with co-production by Miller with Steve Hoy and Gordon Blake, and recorded at the Gershwin Room, Esplanade Hotel, Melbourne. The second EP had five tracks and was co-produced with Shane O&#x27;Mara and recorded at O&#x27;Mara&#x27;s home studio, Yikesville, &quot;[with] an ADAT recorder and a couple of cheap delay units in the spare bedroom, rather than the sophisticated backyard operation it is today. Lisa is adamant that she came up with the name &#x27;Yikesville&#x27; during this session, but Shane doesn&#x27;t believe her&quot;. O&#x27;Mara mixed it, &quot;one night when the ARIA awards were on (the year Silverchair and Tim Rogers did &#x27;New Race&#x27;). Lisa and Rebecca spent the evening glued to the telly, while Shane and Ben [Lempriere] got progressively drunker over the 8-track Mackie desk.&quot;

Her debut album, &quot;Quiet Girl with a Credit Card&quot;, followed in June 1996 on the W.Minc label and distributed by Shock Records. It had been recorded in April 1995 with former bandmate, Graham Lee, producing at Fortissimo Studios, South Melbourne. Dave Dawson of &quot;Impress Magazine&quot; observed that Miller&#x27;s US trip, &quot;with country radio as a sporadic soundtrack, was the fertile fuel which prompted her to quit teaching when she arrived home, manage stores selling Americana gear and sing for her supper in Suburban bars.&quot; He felt that, &quot;The long gestation period for this album has been a blessing – songs that began life in one guise have, by osmosis, developed new cloaks... country and western... is a far cry from Ms Miller&#x27;s eclectic mix of country, funk, folk and pop.&quot; It was also issued in the United Kingdom on Demon Records, to date her only release outside of Australia.

Three years later her second album, &quot;As Far as a Life Goes&quot; (June 1999), appeared on the W.Minc label, albeit via the now-defunct, Festival Mushroom Records. It was produced by Barry Palmer (Deadstar, Mark Seymour, Christopher Marshall) at Sing Sing Studios, Richmond in September 1998. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1999 she was nominated for Best Female Artist for &quot;As Far as a Life Goes&quot;.

After sorting out troubles with her record companies, Miller released an album, &quot;Car Tape&quot;, of cover versions in May 2002 for the fledgling Melbourne label, Raoul Records, which is run by her husband, Ben Lempriere. It found her in a country-soul vein and was a critical success. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, felt it was, &quot;a delightful and idiosyncratic collection of songs.&quot; Her material was mostly by US singer-songwriters including, Arthur Alexander, Karen Dalton, Charlie Rich and Townes Van Zandt. She also provided her rendition of Tim Rogers&#x27; &quot;Word for Sadness&quot;, which appeared on You Am I&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Deliverance&quot; in September. According to Miller it was named for, &quot;grimy cassettes which get stuck, and you have to stick a pen into the reel to wind them up. And they&#x27;re funny songs that someone puts on a tape because they&#x27;re special to them, and they&#x27;re often a bit odd.&quot;

&quot;Car Tape&quot; was produced, recorded and mixed by O&#x27;Mara at his studio, at various times during 2000 and 2001. It peaked at No. 8 on the ARIA Hitseekers Albums and No. 24 on the ARIA Alternative Albums chart. O&#x27;Mara later recalled, &quot;It was sort of when everything clicked and I found my feet or something. It was through that album that I met Tim Rogers who told me he loved what I did on Lisa&#x27;s album.&quot; She received three more ARIA Music Award nominations in 2002: for Best Female Artist, Best Independent Release and Best Adult Contemporary Album for &quot;Car Tape&quot;. It was one of the best-selling Australian independent releases of 2002.

In 2003 she released her fourth album, &quot;Version Originale&quot;, a CD of original compositions, that was also warmly received by critics. With her band, featuring guitarist and producer, O&#x27;Mara, Miller has been a sporadic live performer in and around Melbourne, with forays up the east coast of Australia, including the Byron Bay Blues Festival. She has played with Billy Bragg and toured Australia with Neil Young and Nick Cave. She has also appeared on recordings by Australian musicians David McComb, Tim Rogers, Tex Perkins, Andy Baylor, Barb Waters, Doug Mansfield, Amanda Brown (of The Go-Betweens) and David Chesworth. At one time she was managed by the late Mick Geyer (close associate of Nick Cave), but is now self-managed.

In 2004 Miller released the EP, &quot;Pushover&quot;, which features five songs recorded live on the 2003 Neil Young tour. She was again nominated in the Best Female Artist category at the 2004 ARIA Awards, at which – once again – she was beaten by Kasey Chambers. Miller collaborated with composer Amanda Brown on a number of songs for the feature film, &quot;Look Both Ways&quot;, but only one track, &quot;Eleven&quot;, made the final selection.

In 2005 she recorded a version of the Split Enz song &quot;I Hope I Never&quot; for &quot;She Will Have Her Way&quot;, a tribute album of female Australian and New Zealand artists performing the works of Tim and Neil Finn. This album was nominated for a 2006 ARIA award under &quot;Best Adult Contemporary Artist&quot;.

Her fifth album, &quot;Morning in the Bowl of Night&quot;, was released in March 2007, many of the songs focussing around the death of Miller&#x27;s mother. In early 2008, &quot;Morning in the Bowl of Night&quot;, was shortlisted for the Australian Music Prize.

<text>A trailer is an unpowered vehicle towed by a powered vehicle. It is commonly used for the transport of goods and materials.There are two general categories of trailers: the full trailer and the semitrailer. A full trailer is a type of trailer whose entire weight is supported by its own wheels, with no weight transferred to the towing vehicle. In contrast, a semi-trailer is designed so that a portion of its weight is carried by its own wheels, while the remaining weight is borne by the towing vehicle.

Sometimes recreational vehicles, travel trailers, or mobile homes with limited living facilities where people can camp or stay have been referred to as trailers. In earlier days, many such vehicles were towable trailers.

Trailers have been used for thousands of years, predating the invention of the automobile. Before the advent of the wheel, early humans employed the concept of trailering by using drag sleds to transport goods. While the two wheel war chariot is one of the earliest and simplest forms of a semi-trailer. Alexander Winston has been credited with inventing the modern semitrailer in Cleveland, Ohio.

== United States ==
In the United States, the term is sometimes used interchangeably with travel trailer and mobile home, varieties of trailers, and manufactured housing designed for human habitation. Their origins lay in utility trailers built in a similar fashion to horse-drawn wagons. A trailer park is an area where mobile homes are placed for habitation.

In the United States trailers ranging in size from single-axle dollies to 6-axle, , semi-trailers are commonplace. The latter, when towed as part of a tractor-trailer or &quot;18-wheeler&quot;, carries a large percentage of the freight that travels over land in North America.

==Types==

Some trailers are made for personal (or small business) use with practically any powered vehicle having an appropriate hitch, but some trailers are part of large trucks called semi-trailer trucks for transportation of cargo.

 toy trailers and motorcycle trailers can be towed by commonly accessible pickup truck or van, which generally require no special permit beyond a regular driver&#x27;s license. Specialized trailers like open-air motorcycle trailers, bicycle trailers are much smaller, accessible to small automobiles, as are some simple trailers, have a drawbar and ride on a single axle. Other trailers, such as utility trailers and travel trailers or campers come in single and multiple axle varieties, to allow for varying sizes of tow vehicles.

There also exist highly specialized trailers, such as genset trailers, pusher trailers and other types that are also used to power the towing vehicle. Others are custom-built to hold entire kitchens and other specialized equipment used by carnival vendors. There are also trailers for hauling boats.

=== Trackless train ===


=== Utility ===

A utility trailer is a general purpose trailer designed to by towed by a light vehicle and to carry light, compact loads of up to a few metric tonnes. It typically has short metal sides (either rigid or folding) to constrain the load, and may have cage sides, and a rear folding gate or ramps. Utility trailers do not have a roof. Utility trailers have one axle set comprising one, two or three axles.
If it does not have sides then it is usually called a flatbed or flat-deck trailer. 
If it has rails rather than sides, with ramps at the rear, it is usually called an open car transporter, auto-transporter, or a plant trailer, as they are designed to transport vehicles and mobile plant.
If it has fully rigid sides and a roof with a rear door, creating a weatherproof compartment, this is usually called a furniture trailer, cargo trailer, box van trailer or box trailer.

=== Fixed Plant ===

A Fixed Plant Trailer is a special purpose trailer built to carry units which usually are immobile such as large generators &amp; pumps

=== Bicycle ===
A bicycle trailer is a motor less wheeled frame with a hitch system for transporting cargo by bicycle.

=== Construction ===
Construction trailers are mobile structures (trailers) used to accommodate temporary offices, dining facilities and storage of building materials during construction projects. The trailers may be equipped with radios for communication.

===Travel===
Popular campers use lightweight trailers, aerodynamic trailers that can be towed by a small car, such as the BMW Air Camper. They are built to be lower than the tow vehicle, minimizing drag.

Others range from two-axle campers that can be pulled by most mid-sized pickups to trailers that are as long as the host country&#x27;s law allows for drivers without special permits. Larger campers tend to be fully integrated recreational vehicles, which often are used to tow single-axle dolly trailers to allow the users to bring small cars on their travels.

==== Teardrop ====
===Semi===

A semi-trailer is a trailer without a front axle. A large proportion of its weight is supported either by a road tractor or by a detachable front axle assembly known as a dolly. A semi-trailer is normally equipped with legs, called &quot;landing gear&quot;, which can be lowered to support it when it is uncoupled. In the United States, a single trailer cannot exceed a length of on interstate highways (unless a special permit is granted), although it is possible to link two smaller trailers together to a maximum length of .

Semi-trailers vary considerably in design, ranging from open-topped grain haulers through Tautliners to normal-looking but refrigerated x enclosures (&quot;reefers&quot;). Many semi-trailers are part of semi-trailer trucks. Other types of semi-trailers include dry vans, flatbeds and chassis.

Many commercial organizations choose to rent or lease semi-trailer equipment rather than own their own semi-trailers, to free up capital and to keep trailer debt from appearing on their balance sheet.
===Full===

A full trailer is a term used in the United States and New Zealand for a freight trailer supported by front and rear axles and pulled by a drawbar. In Europe this is known as an &quot;A-frame drawbar trailer&quot;, and in Australia it is known as a &quot;dog trailer&quot;. Commercial freight trailers are produced to length and width specifications defined by the country of operation. In America this is wide and long. In New Zealand, the maximum width is while the maximum length is , giving a 22-pallet capacity.

As per AIS 053, full trailer is a towed vehicle having at least two axles, and equipped with a towing device which can move vertically in relation to the trailer and controls the direction of the front axle(s), but which transmits no significant static load to the towing vehicle. Common types of full trailers are flat deck, hardside/box, curtainside or bathtub tipper style with axle configurations up to two at the drawbar end and three at the rear of the trailer.

This style of trailer is also popular for use with farm tractors.
===Close-coupled===

A close-coupled trailer is fitted with a rigid towbar which projects from its front and hooks onto a hook on the tractor. It does not pivot as a drawbar does.
===Motorcycle===
A motorcycle trailer may be a trailer designed to haul motorcycles behind an automobile or truck. Such trailers may be open or enclosed, ranging in size from trailers capable of carrying several motorcycles or only one. They may be designed specifically to carry motorcycles, with ramps and tie-downs, or may be a utility trailer adapted permanently or occasionally to haul one or more motorcycles.

Another type of motorcycle trailer is a wheeled frame with a hitch system designed for transporting cargo by motorcycle. Motorcycle trailers are often narrow and styled to match the appearance of the motorcycle they are intended to be towed behind. There are two-wheeled versions and single-wheeled versions. Single-wheeled trailers, such as the Unigo or Pav 40/41, are designed to allow the bike to have all the normal flexibility of a motorcycle, usually using a universal joint to enable the trailer to lean and turn with the motorcycle. No motorcycle manufacturer recommends that its motorcycles be used to tow a trailer because it results in additional safety hazards for motorcyclists.
===Livestock===

There are a number of different styles of trailers used to haul livestock such as cattle, horses, sheep and pigs. The most common is the stock trailer, a trailer that is enclosed on the bottom, but has openings at approximately the eye level of the animals to allow ventilation. The horse trailer is a more elaborate form of stock trailer. Because horses are usually hauled for the purpose of competition or work, where they must be in peak physical condition, horse trailers are designed for the comfort and safety of the animals. They usually have adjustable vents and windows as well as suspension designed to provide a smooth ride and less stress on the animals. In addition, horse trailers have internal partitions that assist the animal in staying upright during travel and protect horses from injuring each other in transit. Larger horse trailers may incorporate additional storage areas for horse tack and may even include elaborate living quarters with sleeping areas, bathroom and cooking facilities, and other comforts.

Both stock trailers and horse trailers range in size from small units capable of holding one to three animals, able to be pulled by a pickup truck, SUV or even a quad bike; to large semi-trailers that can haul a significant number of animals.

=== Boat ===
=== Roll trailer ===


=== Baggage trailer ===
Baggage trailers are used for the transportation of loose baggage, oversized bags, mail bags, loose cargo carton boxes, etc. between the aircraft and the terminal or sorting facility. Dollies for loose baggage are fitted with a brake system which blocks the wheels from moving when the connecting rod is not attached to a tug. Most dollies for loose baggage are completely enclosed except for the sides which use plastic curtains to protect items from weather. In the US, these dollies are called baggage carts, but in Europe &quot;baggage cart&quot; means passenger baggage trolleys.

=== Hydraulic modular trailer ===

A hydraulic modular trailer (HMT) is a special platform trailer unit which feature swing axles, hydraulic suspension, independently steerable axles, two or more axle rows, compatible to join two or more units longitudinally and laterally and uses power pack unit (PPU) to steer and adjust height. These trailer units are used to transport oversized load, which are difficult to disassemble and are overweight. These trailers are manufactured using high tensile steel, which makes it  possible to bear the weight of the load with the help of one or more ballast tractors which push and pull these units via drawbar or gooseneck together making a heavy hauler unit.

Typical loads include oil rig modules, bridge sections, buildings, ship sections, and industrial machinery such as generators and turbines. There is a limited number of manufacturers who produce these heavy-duty trailers because the market share of oversized loads is very thin when we talk about transportation industry. There are self powered units of hydraulic modular trailer which are called SPMT which are used when the ballast tractors can not be applied.

=== Bus trailer ===

A bus trailer is for transporting passengers hauled by a tractor unit similar like that of a truck. These trailers have become obsolete due to the issue of the communication between the driver and the conductor and traffic jams.

==Hitching==
A trailer hitch, fifth-wheel coupling or other type of tow hitch is needed to draw a trailer with a car, truck or other traction engine.

===Ball and socket===
A trailer coupler is used to secure the trailer to the towing vehicle. The trailer coupler attaches to the trailer ball. This forms a ball and socket connection to allow for relative movement between the towing vehicle and trailer while towing over uneven road surfaces. The trailer ball is mounted to the rear bumper or to a draw bar, which may be removable. The draw bar is secured to the trailer hitch by inserting it into the hitch receiver and pinning it. The three most common types of couplers are straight couplers, A-frame couplers, and adjustable couplers. Bumper-pull hitches and draw bars can exert tremendous leverage on the tow vehicle making it harder to recover from a swerving situation.

===Fifth wheel and gooseneck===

These are available for loads between . Both the hitches are better than a receiver hitch and allow a more efficient and central attachment of a large trailer to the tow vehicle. They can haul large loads without disrupting the stability of the vehicle. Traditional hitches are connected to the rear of the vehicle at the frame or bumper, while fifth wheel and gooseneck trailers are attached to the truck bed above the rear axle. This coupling location allows the truck to make sharper turns and haul heavier trailers. They can be mounted in the bed of a pickup truck or any type of flatbed. A fifth-wheel coupling is also referred to as a kingpin hitch and is a smaller version of the semi-trailer &quot;fifth wheel&quot;. Though a fifth wheel and a gooseneck trailer look much the same, their method for coupling is different. A fifth wheel uses a large horseshoe-shaped coupling device mounted or more above the bed of the tow vehicle. A gooseneck couples to a standard ball mounted on the bed of the tow vehicle. The operational difference between the two is the range of movement in the hitch. The gooseneck is very maneuverable and can tilt in all directions, while the fifth wheel is intended for level roads and limited tilt side to side. Gooseneck mounts are often used for agricultural and industrial trailers. Fifth-wheel mounts are often used for recreational trailers. Standard bumper-hitch trailers typically allow a 10% or 15% hitch load while a fifth wheel and gooseneck can handle 20% or 25% weight transfer.

==Jacks==
The basic function of a trailer jack is to lift the trailer to a height that allows the trailer to be hitched or unhitched to and from the towing vehicle. Trailer jacks are also used for leveling the trailer during storage. The most common types of trailer jacks are A-frame jacks, swivel jacks, and drop-leg jacks. Some trailers, such as horse trailers, have a built-in jack at the tongue for this purpose.

== Electrical components ==
Many older cars took the feeds for the trailer&#x27;s lights directly from the towing vehicle&#x27;s rear light circuits. As bulb-check systems were introduced in the 1990s &quot;by-pass relays&quot; were introduced. These took a small signal from the rear lights to switch a relay which in turn powered the trailer&#x27;s lights with its own power feed. Many towing electrical installations, including vehicle-specific kits incorporate some form of bypass relays.

In the US, trailer lights usually have a shared light for brake and turn indicators. If such a trailer is to be connected to a car with separate lamps for turn indicator and brake a trailer light converter is needed, which allows for attaching the trailer&#x27;s lights to the wiring of the vehicle.

Nowadays some vehicles are being fitted with CANbus networks, and some of these use the CANbus to connect the tow bar electrics to various safety systems and controls. For vehicles that use the CANbus to activate towing-related safety systems, a wiring kit that can interact appropriately must be used. Without such a towbar wiring kit the vehicle cannot detect the presence of a trailer and can therefore not activate safety features such as trailer stability program which can electronically control a snaking trailer or caravan.

By-pass systems are cheap, but may not be appropriate on cars with interactive safety features.

=== Brakes ===

Larger trailers are usually fitted with brakes. These can be either electrically operated, air operated, or overrun brakes.

== Stability ==
Trailer stability can be defined as the tendency of a trailer to dissipate side-to-side motion. The initial motion may be caused by aerodynamic forces, such as from a cross wind or a passing vehicle. One common criterion for stability is the center of mass location with respect to the wheels, which can usually be detected by tongue weight. If the center of mass of the trailer is behind its wheels, therefore having a negative tongue weight, the trailer will likely be unstable. Another parameter which is less commonly a factor is the trailer moment of inertia. Even if the center of mass is forward of the wheels, a trailer with a long load, and thus large moment of inertia, may be unstable.

Some vehicles are equipped with a Trailer Stability Program that may be able to compensate for improper loading.

<text>Guadalcanal () is a village in the province of Seville, in the autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain.

The name was given to the island of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands in 1568. The name was chosen by Pedro de Ortega Valencia who had been born in the village. He was a subordinate of Spanish explorer and navigator Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira.

== Location and population ==
In 2006 there were 2,970 inhabitants. It has an area of 275 square kilometres and a population density of 10,6 people per square-km. It is at an altitude of 662 metres, in a valley between the Sierra del Agua and the Sierra del Viento, in the region of the Sierra Norte of Seville. Guadalcanal is 80 kilometres north of Seville, it depends to the judicial party of Cazalla de la Sierra.

== Etymology ==
The name, etymologically, comes from the Arabic phrase &quot;wādī al-qanāl&quot;, meaning &#x27;river of the stalls&#x27; or &#x27;valley of stalls&#x27;, referring to the refreshment stalls set up there during the Muslim rule in Andalusia. Other names were &quot;Tereses&quot; or &quot;Tereja&quot;, or &quot;Canani&quot; with the Iberians.

==History==


It was reconquered by the Order of Santiago in 1241 from the Moors, then Guadalcanal belonged to the Kingdom of León as well as other parts of Extremadura. In ecclesiastical terms, it belonged to the Santa María de Tendudia vicary.

Guadalcanal was fortified by means of a now-ruined wall which was demolished because the village took part in the Guerra de las Comunidades de Castilla.

In the mid-16th century, the area had some silver mines financed by the Fugger family.

The village suffered a crisis in the 19th century, which caused the four nunneries in the village to close. As other rural communities in Spain, it faced a massive exodus of its inhabitants to the cities in the 20th century.

<doc id="853766" wikidata="Q6656653" url="?curid=853766" title="Live at the Continental and the Esplanade">
<text>Live at the Continental and the Esplanade is a live album by Australian rock musician, Paul Kelly, which was originally available, from late 1995, by mail order only from Mushroom Records&#x27; White Records Label in Australia. It had been recorded from two performances at the (now defunct) Continental Hotel in Prahran and one performance at the Esplanade Hotel in St Kilda, both in Melbourne. By June 1996 the album was available in Australian stores on Mushroom Records and, on 23 July, it was issued by Vanguard Records in the United States.

==Background==
In July 1994, Australian musician, Paul Kelly, released his third solo album, &quot;Wanted Man&quot;. On 19 and 20 September, Kelly and his band performed at the Continental Hotel in Prahran, the sessions were recorded live. From March to May 1995, Kelly undertook a seven-week tour of North America, appearing on several dates with Liz Phair and Joe Jackson. On 29 May 1995, Kelly had returned to Melbourne and recorded more live tracks at the Esplanade Hotel&#x27;s Gershwin Room. Kelly released his next album, &quot;Deeper Water&quot; in September. In late 1995, he issued &quot;Live at the Continental and the Esplanade&quot; on White Records Label via Mushroom Records – it was originally only available by mail order. The live recordings at the two hotels were not remixed nor overdubbed. By June 1996 the album was available in Australian stores on Mushroom Records and, on 23 July, it was issued by Vanguard Records in the United States.

==Reception==
Allmusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann felt &quot;it provides a good sampler of his work, accompanied by a full band rather than [his recent] acoustic sets&quot; and that its style was &quot;melodic folk-rock with electric guitar for bite and often caustic lyrics&quot;.

==Track listing==
All tracks are written by Paul Kelly except as shown.

<text>The World Wide Web Wanderer, also simply called The Wanderer, was a Perl-based web crawler that was first deployed in June 1993 to measure the size of the World Wide Web. The Wanderer was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Matthew Gray, who also created back in 1993 one of the 100 first web servers in history, www.mit.edu. The crawler was used to generate an index called the &quot;Wandex&quot; later in 1993. The Wanderer charted the growth of the web until late 1995.

The &quot;Wanderer&quot; was probably the first web robot, and, with its index, clearly had the potential to become a general-purpose WWW search engine. The author, Matthew Gray, does not make this claim. Elsewhere, it is stated that the purpose of the &quot;Wanderer&quot; was not to be a web search engine.

<text>In the physical sciences and electrical engineering, dispersion relations describe the effect of dispersion on the properties of waves in a medium. A dispersion relation relates the wavelength or wavenumber of a wave to its frequency. Given the dispersion relation, one can calculate the frequency-dependent phase velocity and group velocity of each sinusoidal component of a wave in the medium, as a function of frequency. In addition to the geometry-dependent and material-dependent dispersion relations, the overarching Kramers–Kronig relations describe the frequency-dependence of wave propagation and attenuation.

Dispersion may be caused either by geometric boundary conditions (waveguides, shallow water) or by interaction of the waves with the transmitting medium. Elementary particles, considered as matter waves, have a nontrivial dispersion relation, even in the absence of geometric constraints and other media.

In the presence of dispersion, a wave does not propagate with an unchanging waveform, giving rise to the distinct frequency-dependent phase velocity and group velocity.

==Dispersion==

Dispersion occurs when sinusoidal waves of different wavelengths have different propagation velocities, so that a wave packet of mixed wavelengths tends to spread out in space. The speed of a plane wave, formula_1, is a function of the wave&#x27;s wavelength formula_2:

:formula_3

The wave&#x27;s speed, wavelength, and frequency, &quot;f&quot;, are related by the identity

:formula_4

The function formula_5 expresses the dispersion relation of the given medium. Dispersion relations are more commonly expressed in terms of the angular frequency formula_6 and wavenumber formula_7. Rewriting the relation above in these variables gives

:formula_8

where we now view &quot;f&quot; as a function of &quot;k&quot;. The use of &quot;ω&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) to describe the dispersion relation has become standard because both the phase velocity &quot;ω&quot;/&quot;k&quot; and the group velocity &quot;dω&quot;/&quot;dk&quot; have convenient representations via this function.

The plane waves being considered can be described by

:formula_9

where 
*&quot;A&quot; is the amplitude of the wave,
*&quot;A&quot;0 = &quot;A&quot;(0, 0),
*&quot;x&quot; is a position along the wave&#x27;s direction of travel, and
*&quot;t&quot; is the time at which the wave is described.

==Plane waves in vacuum==

Plane waves in vacuum are the simplest case of wave propagation: no geometric constraint, no interaction with a transmitting medium.

=== Electromagnetic waves in vacuum ===

For electromagnetic waves in vacuum, the angular frequency is proportional to the wavenumber:
: formula_10

This is a &quot;linear&quot; dispersion relation, in which case the waves are said to be non-dispersive. That is, the phase velocity and the group velocity are the same:
: formula_11
and thus both are equal to the speed of light in vacuum, which is frequency-independent.

===De Broglie dispersion relations===
For de Broglie matter waves the frequency dispersion relation is non-linear:
formula_12
The equation says the matter wave frequency formula_13 in vacuum varies with wavenumber (formula_14) in the non-relativistic approximation. The variation has two parts: a constant part due to the de Broglie frequency of the rest mass (formula_15) and a quadratic part due to kinetic energy.

==== Derivation ====
While applications of matter waves occur at non-relativistic velocity, de Broglie applied special relativity to derive his waves. 
Starting from the relativistic energy–momentum relation:
formula_16
use the de Broglie relations for energy and momentum for matter waves,
:formula_17
where is the angular frequency and is the wavevector with magnitude , equal to the wave number. Divide by formula_18 and take the square root. This gives the relativistic frequency dispersion relation:

formula_19

Practical work with matter waves occurs at non-relativistic velocity. To approximate, we pull out the rest-mass dependent frequency:
formula_20

Then we see that the formula_21 factor is very small so for formula_22 not too large, we expand formula_23 and multiply:

formula_12
This gives the non-relativistic approximation discussed above. 
If we start with the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation we will end up without the first, rest mass, term.

==Frequency versus wavenumber==
As mentioned above, when the focus in a medium is on refraction rather than absorption—that is, on the real part of the refractive index—it is common to refer to the functional dependence of angular frequency on wavenumber as the &quot;dispersion relation&quot;. For particles, this translates to a knowledge of energy as a function of momentum.

===Waves and optics===

The name &quot;dispersion relation&quot; originally comes from optics. It is possible to make the effective speed of light dependent on wavelength by making light pass through a material which has a non-constant index of refraction, or by using light in a non-uniform medium such as a waveguide. In this case, the waveform will spread over time, such that a narrow pulse will become an extended pulse, i.e., be dispersed. In these materials, formula_25 is known as the group velocity and corresponds to the speed at which the peak of the pulse propagates, a value different from the phase velocity.

===Deep water waves===

The dispersion relation for deep water waves is often written as

: formula_26

where &quot;g&quot; is the acceleration due to gravity. Deep water, in this respect, is commonly denoted as the case where the water depth is larger than half the wavelength. In this case the phase velocity is

: formula_27

and the group velocity is

: formula_28

===Waves on a string===

For an ideal string, the dispersion relation can be written as

: formula_29

where &quot;T&quot; is the tension force in the string, and &quot;μ&quot; is the string&#x27;s mass per unit length. As for the case of electromagnetic waves in vacuum, ideal strings are thus a non-dispersive medium, i.e. the phase and group velocities are equal and independent (to first order) of vibration frequency.

For a nonideal string, where stiffness is taken into account, the dispersion relation is written as

: formula_30

where formula_31 is a constant that depends on the string.

===Electron band structure===
In the study of solids, the study of the dispersion relation of electrons is of paramount importance. The periodicity of crystals means that many levels of energy are possible for a given momentum and that some energies might not be available at any momentum. The collection of all possible energies and momenta is known as the band structure of a material. Properties of the band structure define whether the material is an insulator, semiconductor or conductor.

===Phonons===
Phonons are to sound waves in a solid what photons are to light: they are the quanta that carry it. The dispersion relation of phonons is also non-trivial and important, being directly related to the acoustic and thermal properties of a material. For most systems, the phonons can be categorized into two main types: those whose bands become zero at the center of the Brillouin zone are called acoustic phonons, since they correspond to classical sound in the limit of long wavelengths. The others are optical phonons, since they can be excited by electromagnetic radiation.

===Electron optics===
With high-energy (e.g., ) electrons in a transmission electron microscope, the energy dependence of higher-order Laue zone (HOLZ) lines in convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) patterns allows one, in effect, to &quot;directly image&quot; cross-sections of a crystal&#x27;s three-dimensional dispersion surface. This dynamical effect has found application in the precise measurement of lattice parameters, beam energy, and more recently for the electronics industry: lattice strain.

== History ==
Isaac Newton studied refraction in prisms but failed to recognize the material dependence of the dispersion relation, dismissing the work of another researcher whose measurement of a prism&#x27;s dispersion did not match Newton&#x27;s own.

Dispersion of waves on water was studied by Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1776.

The universality of the Kramers–Kronig relations (1926–27) became apparent with subsequent papers on the dispersion relation&#x27;s connection to causality in the scattering theory of all types of waves and particles.
