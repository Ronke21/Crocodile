<text>B.C. is a daily American comic strip created by cartoonist Johnny Hart. Set in prehistoric times, it features a group of cavemen and anthropomorphic animals from various geologic eras.

&quot;B.C.&quot; made its newspaper debut on February 17, 1958, and was among the longest-running strips still written and drawn by its original creator when Hart died at his drawing board in Nineveh, New York, on April 7, 2007. Since his death, third-generation descendant Mason Mastroianni has produced the strip, with &quot;B.C.&quot; syndicated by Creators Syndicate.

== Publication history ==
&quot;B.C.&quot; was initially rejected by a number of syndicates until the New York Herald Tribune Syndicate accepted it, launching the strip on February 17, 1958. Hart was assisted with &quot;B.C.&quot; by gag writers Jack Caprio and Dick Boland (who later joined Hart and cartoonist Brant Parker on &quot;The Wizard of Id&quot;).

When the Herald Tribune syndicate folded in 1966 due to the demise of its parent newspaper, &quot;B.C.&quot; was taken over by the Publishers Syndicate. That syndicate changed hands and names frequently — Publishers-Hall Syndicate, the Field Newspaper Syndicate, News America Syndicate, and finally North America Syndicate — eventually becoming part of King Features. At that point, in 1987, Hart changed distributors to Creators Syndicate, becoming one of Creators&#x27; first syndicated strips.

After Hart&#x27;s death in 2007, the strip began being produced by Hart&#x27;s grandsons Mason Mastroianni (head writer and cartoonist) and Mick Mastroianni (writer for both &quot;B.C.&quot; and Hart&#x27;s other creation, &quot;Wizard of Id&quot;), and Hart&#x27;s daughter Perri (letterer and colorist). (The Mastroianni brothers also created an original strip, &quot;Dogs of C Kennel&quot;, in 2009.)

==Cast of characters==
For a visual glossary, see Meet The Actors at John Hart Studios.

===Character inspiration===
Hart was inspired to draw cavemen (and many other creatures) through the chance suggestion of one of his coworkers at General Electric, and took to the idea &quot;because they are a combination of simplicity and the origin of ideas&quot;. The name for the strip &quot;may have been suggested by my wife, Bobby,&quot; Johnny recalls.

Hart describes the title character as similar to himself, playing the &quot;patsy&quot;. The other major characters — Peter, Wiley, Clumsy Carp, Curls, and Thor — were patterned after friends and co-workers. The animal characters include dinosaurs, ants and an anteater, clams, a snake, a turtle and bird duo, and an apteryx (presented in the strip as being the sole surviving specimen, and hence self-aware of its being doomed to extinction).

===Human characters===
* B.C.: An orange haired, humble, naïve slob and eternal patsy. B.C. occasionally makes nighttime rounds as his alter-ego, &quot;The Midnight Skulker.&quot;
* Peter: A yellow haired, self-styled genius and the world&#x27;s first philosophical failure, founder of the &quot;Prehistoric Pessimists Society&quot; and the &quot;Truth Pedestal,&quot; and the discoverer of oil. Peter is patterned after Hart&#x27;s friend, Peter Reuter; the two had been co-workers at General Electric.
* Thor: A brown-haired, smart, witty self-proclaimed ladies&#x27; man; inventor of the wheel and the comb. Thor was patterned after another of Hart&#x27;s friends from GE, Thornton Kinney.
* Jane: a bossy cavewoman who enjoys clobbering snakes. Until August 29, 2019, Jane was referred to in the strip as the &quot;Fat Broad&quot;. She is named after Johnny&#x27;s mother-in-law, Janie Indiana Finch.
* Grace: a quiet but intellectual giant in a world of crude men. Until August 29, 2019, Grace was referred to in the strip as the &quot;Cute Chick&quot;. She is named after Johnny&#x27;s mom Grace Anna Brown. Grace&#x27;s birthday is March 1.
* Wiley: a peg-legged, superstitious, unshaven, woman-fearing, water-hating poet and coach of the local baseball and football teams, not to mention the first bartender. Wiley was patterned after Hart&#x27;s brother-in-law, Wiley Baxter, who lost his leg in World War II.
* Clumsy Carp: a nerdy, bespectacled ichthyologist and perpetual klutz, clumsy enough to trip over a shadow, yet with some unusual skills, such as his ability to make and stack &quot;water balls&quot; (similar to snowballs). Clumsy Carp was patterned after Hart&#x27;s childhood friend, Jack Caprio.
* Curls: a master of sarcastic wit. Curls was patterned after Hart&#x27;s friend from high school, Richard (Curly) Boland.
* Grog: pure Id, a caveman&#x27;s caveman; a primitive, semi-evolved wild man with enough strength to knock the sun out of the sky using a golfball. His vocabulary was very limited until a January 1977 strip in which, to Peter&#x27;s shock, he actually spoke full sentences.
*The Guru: an unnamed, bearded wise man living like a hermit atop a mountain, whence he dispenses wisdom and sarcasm.
===Animals and other non-human characters===
* John the Turtle and the Dookie Bird: this prehistoric odd couple are inseparable friends, especially when making their annual trek south for the winter. The Dookie Bird rides on John&#x27;s back when they travel.
* The Snake: the put-upon, mortal enemy of Jane (and her club).
* The Anteater: eats ants with a sticky, elastic tongue and a &quot;ZOT!&quot; sound. Hart actually drew something of a hybrid—with the long ears of an aardvark and the bushy tail of a giant anteater. (This character was the inspiration for Peter the Anteater, the University of California, Irvine team mascot. Also served as the inspiration for the mascot of the now disestablished US Navy fighter squadron VF-114 the &quot;Aardvarks&quot;.)
* Maude: an ant, a nagging wife with a smart-alec son (Johnny) and a quarrelsome, straying husband.
* Jake: ant husband of Maude, who is always threatening to run off with Shirley.
* Queen Ida: the queen ant, an unfeeling and abusive dictator. Queen Ida was based on Hart&#x27;s wife Bobby, whose given name was Ida. She was featured every year on her birthday, December 3, until Mrs. Hart&#x27;s death in 2018. (The December 3, 2019 strip featured a parting message from the Queen to her subjects.)
* The Dinosaur: big but not too bright—a sort of sauropod with spinal plates like a stegosaurus. Sometimes called Gronk, which is the only sound he makes (although he can talk fluently in recent strips).
* The Clams: talking clams with legs, among other appendages. (Clams are also the preferred unit of currency in &quot;B.C.&quot;)
* The Apteryx (kiwi): a &quot;wingless bird with hairy feathers&quot;, as he invariably introduces himself.
* The Turkey: makes his yearly appearance at Thanksgiving time, eluding the mighty hunters.
* Oynque: the turkey&#x27;s porcine partner in crime, rarely seen without his trademark mud puddle.
* Wolf: the newest &quot;B.C.&quot; character August 24, 2009; a blissfully deviant domestication of Precambrian fur. Man&#x27;s first friend.
* Various incidental ants, including a schoolteacher and her students.
* Raptors: velociraptors that try to eat the other characters.

There are also several odd inanimate characters, including a talking Daisy and his/her friend, a talking Rock.

===Seldom-used or one-shot human characters===
Although the strip seldom expands its human cast outside of the established group of characters, there are a few exceptions.

* Anno Domini, or A.D., introduced during a weeks-long journey by Peter to discover the new world, which he successfully accomplished. His name is arguably a riff on B.C.&#x27;s name. He dresses as a caveman very much like the rest of the characters, but has a thick mustache and a stereotypical Italian accent, assuming a bit of a take on Christopher Columbus. He befriends Peter in the &quot;new world&quot;.
* Conahonty, a Native American Indian, who also appears in the &quot;new world&quot; storyline, and befriends Peter. He is a friend of A.D.&#x27;s, and speaks rather stereotypical broken English. He dresses more like a somewhat stereotyped Indian than a caveman, and at one point even specifically states that he is an American Indian. He and A.D. were not frequently seen after Peter returned from his epic journey. The two are the most oft-appearing non-regular human characters in the history of the strip other than the Guru, due to the strip&#x27;s tight focus on its core cast of humans. His name is a spoof of the name Pocahontas.
* Peter&#x27;s Pen Pal, An unseen person whom Peter corresponds with by tossing &quot;floating stone tablet&quot; letters into the ocean and receiving answers at a later time.

==Setting==
The characters live, for the most part, in caves, in what appears to be a barren, mountainous desert by an unidentified sea. Background detail is often limited to a simple horizon line broken up by the occasional silhouettes of a stray volcano or cloud. &quot;Retail stores&quot;, &quot;shop counters&quot;, and &quot;businesses&quot; are symbolized by a single boulder, labeled (for instance): &quot;Wheel Repair&quot;, &quot;Advice Column&quot;, &quot;Psychiatrist&quot;, etc. The February 5, 2012, strip gives a nearby location of , which is in present-day Dublin, Ireland.

Originally, the strip was set firmly in prehistoric times, with the characters clearly living in an era untouched by modernity. Typical plot lines, for example, include B.C.&#x27;s friend, Thor (inventor of the wheel and the comb), trying to discover a use for the wheel. Thor was also seen making calendars out of stone every December. Other characters attempt to harness fire or to discover an unexplored territory, like Peter trying to find the &quot;new world&quot; by crossing the ocean on a raft. Animals, like the dinosaur, think such thoughts as, &quot;There&#x27;s one consolation to becoming extinct—I&#x27;ll go down in history as the first one to go down in history.&quot; Grog arrived in early 1966, emerging from a miniature glacier which melted to reveal what Wiley called &quot;Prehistoric man!&quot;

&quot;B.C.&quot;, like Hart&#x27;s &quot;Wizard of Id&quot;, is a period burlesque with a deliberately broad, non literal time frame. As time went on, the strip began to mine humor from having the characters make explicit references to modern-day current events, inventions, and celebrities. Increasingly familiar visual devices, like the makeshift &quot;telephone&quot; built into a tree trunk, also started to blur the comic&#x27;s supposed prehistoric setting and make it rife with intentional anachronisms. One of the comic&#x27;s early out-of-context jokes, from June 22, 1967, was this one:
:Peter: &quot;I used to think the Sun revolved around the Earth.&quot;
:B.C.: &quot;What &quot;does&quot; it revolve around?&quot;
:Peter: &quot;The United States!&quot;

Another early example: Near Christmas time, the apteryx, dressed as Santa Claus, modified his usual spiel: &quot;Hi there, I&#x27;m an Apterclaus, a wingless toymonger with batteries not included!&quot; A devout Christian, Hart included didactic references to the death and resurrection of Jesus in Easter installments. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; columnist and comics critic Gene Weingarten suggested that &quot;B.C.&quot; is actually set not in the past but in a dystopic, post-apocalyptic future.

==Format and style==
&quot;B.C.&quot; follows a gag-a-day format, featuring (mostly) unrelated jokes from day to day, plus a color Sunday strip. Occasionally it will run an extended sequence on a given theme over a week or two. It also follows the convention of Sunday strips with a short, setup/payoff joke in the first two panels, followed by an extended gag, which allows newspapers to trim the opening panels for space. The principal cast is small and varied, with each character imbued with a developed personality. &quot;The art style, like that of Charles Schulz&#x27;s &quot;Peanuts&quot;, masks sophisticated minimalism with a casually scratchy veneer,&quot; according to comics historian Don Markstein.

Dry humor, prose, verse, slapstick, irony, shameless puns and wordplay, and comedic devices such as &quot;Wiley&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; (where common words are defined humorously with a twist, see Daffynition) make for some of the mix of material in &quot;B.C.&quot; Example: &quot;Rock &quot;(verb)&quot;: To cause something or someone to swing or sway, principally by hitting them with it!&quot;—from an early 1967 strip. Or: &quot;Cantaloupe &quot;(noun)&quot;: What the father of the bride asks after seeing the wedding estimate!&quot;

There are running gags relating to the main cast and to a variety of secondary, continuing characters. One such periodic recurring gag has Peter communicating with an unseen pen-pal on the other side of the ocean, writing a message on a slab of rock that he floats off into the horizon. It is invariably returned the same way, with a sarcastic reply written on the reverse side. These segments use silent or &quot;pantomime&quot; panels (indicating that time has elapsed; night falls and dawn rises) between the set-up and the delayed punch line—typical of Hart&#x27;s idiosyncratic use of &quot;timing&quot; in &quot;B.C.&quot;

== Controversies ==
The &quot;B.C.&quot; daily strip from December 7, 2006, attracted criticism for defining &quot;infamy&quot; as &quot;a word seldom used after Toyota sales topped 2 million.&quot; The day was the 65th anniversary of the Japanese military&#x27;s attack on Pearl Harbor, and the punchline of the strip refers to Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;Infamy Speech&quot; which requested from Congress a declaration of war against Japan. The day&#x27;s strip was pulled from at least one newspaper, the &quot;San Antonio Express-News&quot;. The paper&#x27;s managing editor said the comic was &quot;a regressive and insensitive statement about one of the worst days in American history.&quot;

On July 21, 2009, the strip presented a gag that involved the supposed suggestion of animal abuse. John Hart Studios received many angry responses from readers and issued an apology on their website.

=== Religious aspect ===

Late in the run of the strip, and following a renewal of Hart&#x27;s religious faith in 1984, &quot;B.C.&quot; increasingly incorporated religious, social, and political commentary, continuing until Hart&#x27;s death in 2007. References to Christianity, anachronistic given the strip&#x27;s supposed setting and the implications of its title, became increasingly frequent during Hart&#x27;s later years.

In interviews, Hart referred to his strip as a &quot;ministry&quot; intended to mix religious themes with secular humor. Though other strips such as &quot;The Family Circus&quot; and &quot;Peanuts&quot; have included Christian themes, &quot;B.C.&quot; strips were pulled from comics pages on several occasions due to editorial perception of religious favoritism or overt proselytizing. Easter strips in 1996 and 2001, for example, prompted editorial reaction from a handful of U.S. newspapers, chiefly the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and written and oral responses from Jewish and Muslim groups who were offended that Hart would include his own Christian beliefs in his strip.

The American Jewish Committee termed the Easter 2001 strip, which depicted the last words of Jesus Christ and a menorah transforming into a cross, &quot;religiously offensive&quot; and &quot;shameful&quot;, and accused Hart of promoting supersessionist theology. A 2003 strip depicting a character using an outhouse with a crescent symbol on the front, slamming the door shut, and declaring, &quot;Is it just me, or does it stink in here?&quot; was interpreted by some as carrying an anti-Islam message. Hart responded to the controversy, saying &quot;This comic was in no way intended to be a message against Islam — subliminal or otherwise... It would be contradictory to my own faith as a Christian to insult other people&#x27;s beliefs.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; consequently relegated strips which its editorial staff deemed objectionable to the religion pages, instead of the regular comics pages.

== &quot;B.C.&quot; in other media ==
*The characters were featured in two animated television specials:
**B.C.: The First Thanksgiving, first aired on NBC in 1973, was directed by Abe Levitow, and featured the voice talents of Daws Butler (as B.C. and Clumsy), Don Messick as Peter and Thor, Bob Holt as Wiley and Grog, and Joanie Sommers as Fat Broad and Cute Chick.
**B.C.: A Special Christmas first aired on HBO in 1981, and starred the comedy team of Bob and Ray as the voices of Peter and Wiley, respectively.
*The characters appeared in animated commercials for the U.S. federal agency ACTION in the 1970s and for Monroe shocks in the late 1980s. They were also licensed by Arby&#x27;s restaurants in 1981, which issued a collector set of 6 &quot;B.C.&quot; cartoon character drinking glasses. In the last half of the 1960s, the BC characters were used in commercials for Marathon gasoline.
*&quot;B.C.&quot; was turned into two video games for the ColecoVision console and Atari 8-bit computers, Commodore 64, and MSX home computers: &quot;B.C.&#x27;s Quest for Tires&quot; and &quot;B.C. 2: Grog&#x27;s Revenge&quot;.

== Hometown ==
Influences from &quot;B.C.&quot; are found throughout Johnny Hart&#x27;s home of Broome County, New York. A PGA Tour event, the B.C. Open, took place every summer in Endicott, New York, through 2005 (the final scheduled B.C. Open in 2006 was disrupted by flooding, prompting a change of venue to the Turning Stone Resort &amp; Casino in central New York state). Each year Johnny would bring in a group of cartoonists to play in the Pro-Am. Jim Davis, Mike Peters, Mort Walker, Paul Szep, Dik Browne, John Cullen Murphy, Dean Young, Stan Drake, Brant Parker, Lynn Johnston, and entertainer Tom Smothers would put on a free show for the community, drawing and signing autographs for golf and cartooning fans.

The Broome County parks department features Gronk the dinosaur as their mascot, and Thor riding a wheel graces every Broome County Transit bus. In the past, Hart has also left his mark, free of charge, on the logos of the Broome Dusters and B.C. Icemen hockey teams.

<text>Most regions and provinces of Europe have alternative names in different languages. Some regions have also undergone name changes for political or other reasons. This article attempts to give all known alternative names for all major European regions, provinces, and territories. It also includes some lesser regions that are important because of their location or history.

This article does not offer any opinion about what the &quot;original&quot;, &quot;official&quot;, &quot;real&quot;, or &quot;correct&quot; name of any region is or was. Regions are (mostly) listed alphabetically by their current best-known name in English, which does not necessarily match the title of the corresponding article. The English version is followed by variants in other languages, in alphabetical order by name, and then by any historical variants and former names.

Foreign names that are the same as their English equivalents may be listed.

<text>Friedrich Wilhelm von Schadow (7 September 1789 – 19 March 1862) was a German Romantic painter.

==Biography==
He was born in Berlin, the second son of the sculptor Johann Gottfried Schadow, who gave him his first lessons in drawing. He then turned to painting, and was instructed by Weitsch.

In 1806-7 Schadow served as a soldier. In 1810 he traveled with his elder brother Rudolph to Rome where he became one of the leading painters of the Nazarene movement. Following the example of Johann Friedrich Overbeck and others, Schadow, originally a Lutheran, joined the Roman Catholic Church, and held that an artist must believe and live out the truths he essays to paint. The sequel showed that Schadow was qualified to shine more as a teacher and mentor than as a painter. As an author, he is best known for his lecture, &quot;Ueber den Einfluss des Christentums auf die bildende Kunst&quot; (About The Influence of Christianity On The Visual Arts) (Düsseldorf, 1843), and the biographical sketches, &quot;Der moderne Vasari&quot; (Berlin, 1854). 

In Rome, Schadow was given one of his first major commissions when the Prussian Consul-General, General Jakob Salomon Bartholdy, befriended the young painter, and asked him and three young compatriots (Peter von Cornelius, Johann Friedrich Overbeck and Philipp Veit) to decorate in fresco a room in his house on the Pincian Hill. The overall theme selected was the story of Joseph and his brethren, and two scenes, the &quot;Bloody Coat&quot; and &quot;Joseph in Prison&quot;, were conferred on Schadow. In 1819, Schadow was appointed professor in the prestigious Berlin Academy of the Arts, and his ability and thorough training gained many devoted disciples.

It was during this period that Schadow developed his paintings for churches. In 1826 he was made director of the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf which he reoriented towards the production of Christian art, though he began a major dispute with one of its professors, Heinrich Christoph Kolbe, ending in the latter leaving the Academy in 1832. In 1837, Schadow selected, at request, those of his students best qualified to decorate the chapel of St Apollinaris on the Rhine with frescoes. When finished, they were acclaimed as the fullest and purest manifestation of the spiritual side of the Düsseldorf school. One of his famous students, Heinrich Mucke, carried on the liturgical art with emphasis both in painting and frescoes. The painting of the &quot;Wise and Foolish Virgins&quot;, considered one of his masterworks, was commissioned in 1842. Now in the Städel Museum, this large and important picture, while carefully considered and rendered, lacks the power of some of his other works.

Schadow&#x27;s fame rests less on his own artistic creations than on the school he formed. In Düsseldorf a reaction set in against the spiritual and sacerdotal style he had established and, in 1859, the party of naturalism, after a severe struggle, drove Director Schadow from his chair. He died at Düsseldorf in 1862, and a monument was erected in the square which bears his name at a jubilee held to commemorate his directorate.

The Düsseldorf School that Schadow directed became internationally renowned, attracting such American painters as George Caleb Bingham, Eastman Johnson, Worthington Whittredge, Richard Caton Woodville, William Stanley Haseltine, James M. Hart, and William Morris Hunt and producing the German emigre Emmanuel Leutze.

<text>Rudolph Schadow (also spelled Ridolfo Schadow; July 9, 1786 – January 31, 1822) was a German sculptor.

==Biography==

Born in Rome, he had his father, Johann Gottfried Schadow, at Berlin, for his first master.

In 1810 he went to Rome and received kindly help from Canova and Thorvaldsen. His talents were versatile; his first independent work was a figure of Paris, and it had for its companion a spinning girl. The latter, a portrayal of a young girl spinning, proved to be extremely popular among visitors to Rome, and even admirers of the work of Canova and Thorvaldensen acknowledged its worth. Schadow made several other versions of the work, the first probably between 1814 and 1816. The King of Prussia, Prince Esterhazy and the Duke of Devonshire all expressed a wish to include this statue in their collections. One version completed in 1820 is on display in the Hermitage, which acquired it from the Znamenka Palace, near St. Petersburg, in 1930.
Embracing the Roman Catholic faith, he produced statues of John the Baptist and of the &quot;Virgin and Child&quot;. In England he became known by bas-reliefs executed for the Duke of Devonshire and for the Marquess of Lansdowne.

His last composition, commissioned by the king of Prussia, was a colossal group, &quot;Achilles with the Body of Penthesilea&quot;; the model, universally admired for its antique character and the largeness of its style, had not been carried out in marble when in 1822 the artist died in Rome.

<text>Stanley William Fox (June 22, 1906 – March 22, 1984) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada, who served as the first leader of the Manitoba Social Credit Party, a party that supported the social credit theories of monetary reform.

The son of Thomas A. Fox and Flora McQuarrie, Fox was born in Balmoral, Manitoba. He was educated at the University of Manitoba and the Manitoba Medical College. He subsequently practiced as a doctor. He reached the rank of captain in the Canadian Army Medical Corps.

In Manitoba&#x27;s 1936 provincial election, Fox was elected as a Social Credit candidate in the riding of Gilbert Plains. The newly formed party did not have a leader during the election, and Fox was subsequently chosen to head its parliamentary caucus.

Soon after being chosen as leader, Fox offered to support the government of Liberal-Progressive Premier John Bracken, who had been reduced to a minority and was unable to find allies elsewhere. There were some discussions for a formal coalition, but these came to nothing, and Social Credit supported the minority government from the outside until 1940.

Fox stepped down as the party&#x27;s parliamentary leader in 1937, in favour of S.E. Rogers. He supported Social Credit&#x27;s decision to join the government in 1940, and was re-elected in 1941 and 1945.

In 1937, Fox was charged with performing an illegal operation on Miss Alice Bosnell. However, charges were dropped because Bosnell, married to Dr. Fox earlier that year, could not be compelled to testify against her husband.

Fox planned to run for re-election in the 1949 campaign, but lost the coalition nomination to Ray Mitchell of the Liberal-Progressive Party. He did not return to political life afterwards, and died on March 22, 1984.

<text>Peter, Sue and Marc were a Swiss music group from Bern. The members were Peter Reber (born 1949, vocals / piano / guitar), Sue Schell (born 1950 in New York, vocals), and Marc Dietrich (born 1948, vocals / guitar). They represented Switzerland at the Eurovision Song Contest four times, singing in four different languages, French in ESC 1971 with &quot;Les Illusions de nos vingt ans&quot;, English in 1976 with &quot;Djambo, Djambo&quot;, German in 1979 with &quot;Trödler und Co&quot;, Italian in 1981 with &quot;Io senza te&quot; which they also published in German. They sold over 2 million records in Switzerland. They held concerts in many countries including Germany, Austria, and Japan. Their greatest hit was &quot;Cindy&quot; in 1976 (it was released in South Africa in 1978, where it became a hit, peaking at number 3 on the charts in November of that year). The song &quot;Birds of paradise&quot; became a hit in Slovakia in 2006. Initially the song was played at the funeral of 42 military plane crash victims. Following that people flooded radio stations across the country with requests for this song.

During their career, Peter Sue and Marc made many other attempts to sing at Eurovision. They came third in the 1973 Swiss qualifier with &quot;Es kommt ein Tag&quot;. In 1974 they again missed out on a place at the final, this time with the song &quot;Frei&quot;. 1975 saw them finish in second place in the Swiss heat with &quot;Lève-toi le soleil&quot;. In 1978 they took part in the German finals, and their entry, &quot;Charlie Chaplin&quot;, was placed third. In 1987 Marc attempted to represent Switzerland with the song &quot;Nostradamus&quot;, finishing second behind Carol Rich.

In addition to his participations alongside Sue and Marc, Peter Reber also composed, co-wrote, and conducted the 1980 Swiss entry, &quot;Cinéma&quot; performed by Paola di Medico. It also makes him one of a handful of performers to have participated at Eurovision as both a performer and conductor.

&quot;The Birds of Paradise&quot; was covered by the Russian singer Dmitry Selivanov in 1987 and released in 1990.

<text>Thomas Walton Patey (20 February 1932 – 25 May 1970) was a Scottish climber, mountaineer, doctor and writer. He was a leading Scottish climber of his day, particularly excelling on winter routes. He died in a climbing accident at the age of 38. He was probably best known for his humorous songs and prose about climbing, many of which were published posthumously in the collection &quot;One Man&#x27;s Mountains&quot;.

==Early life==
Patey was born on 20 February 1932 at Ellon, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. He was educated at Ellon Academy and Robert Gordon&#x27;s College in Aberdeen. He studied medicine at the University of Aberdeen, graduating in 1955 with a MB ChB.

==Medical career==
After becoming fully registered as a doctor, he served for four years as Surgeon Lieutenant in the Royal Marines at the 42 Commando School at Bickleigh. Patey then worked for eight years as a general practitioner (GP) in Ullapool, in the far north-west of Scotland. 

==Climbing==
Patey first became interested in climbing while he was in the Scouts, but it was at University in Aberdeen, that he first revealed his full talent as an exploratory climber, captaining the Lairig Club. Much of his early exploratory routes were on Lochnagar and neighbouring Cairngorms. A dedicated climber, he often dropped all other commitments for the prospect of a good climb. Patey&#x27;s preference of travelling light extended to leaving his gloves behind on some ice climbs and he had a disrespect for climbing ropes unless they were necessary. While he was at Bickleigh, he would regularly open up new climbs on the Devon Tors. He cared little about recording these climbing details, since that way, if routes were left unblemished and apparently virgin, those following could have a similar excitement in their experience. This generosity of spirit, along with his exuberance and irrepressive energy, left a lasting memory with his companions. His irreverent climbing songs would often be accompanied at a piano by incessant humming through a comb and paper.

He climbed extensively in Scotland (making the first winter traverse of the Cuillin ridge with Hamish MacInnes, David Crabbe and Brian Robertson in 1965), as well as achieving notable ascents in the Alps and the Karakoram including the first ascent of the Muztagh Tower (7273 metres) with John Hartog, Joe Brown and Ian McNaught-Davis in 1956 and Rakaposhi (7788 m) in 1958 with Mike Banks. In 1968, he and Ian Clough were the first to climb Am Buachaille, a sea stack off the coast of Sutherland.

In July 1966 Patey, Rusty Baillie and Chris Bonington climbed to the top of the Old Man of Hoy. The three pioneered the route up which was repeated with others on a live televised BBC outside broadcast on 8–9 July 1967.

On 25 May 1970 he fell and died while abseiling from The Maiden, a sea stack off Whiten Head on the Sutherland coast.

==Personal life==
Patey married Elizabeth Davidson and they had three children.

==Awards and honours==
In 1966 he received a Queen&#x27;s Commendation for Brave Conduct, after assisting in an incident where two climbers were killed after a fall.

== Legacy ==
In 1971, the collection &quot;One Man&#x27;s Mountains&quot; was published.

In 2022 a playground was opened in Chapelton named Patey Park.

&quot;One Man&#x27;s Lecacy&quot;, written by Dave Macleod, was published in 2022.

<text>Johann Gottfried Schadow (20 May 1764 – 27 January 1850) was a German Prussian sculptor.

His most iconic work is the chariot on top of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.

==Biography==
Schadow was born in Berlin, where his father was a poor tailor.

He trained as a sculptor under Antoine Tassaert, who was patronized by Frederick the Great. Taessert offered his daughter in marriage, but the pupil preferred to elope with a Jewish girl, Marianne Devidel in Rome and Taessert not only condoned the offense but furnished money for their stay in Italy. After he married Devidel in Rome he also won the sculptors prize from the Accademia di San Luca in 1786. Having been influenced by the sculptor Antonio Canova during his stay in Rome he returned to Berlin in 1788 to succeed Tassaert as sculptor to the court and secretary to the Prussian Academy of Arts and Roral Porcelain Factory. Upon his return, his first work was the tomb of the son of the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm II, Alexander von der Mark. Over half a century he produced upwards of two hundred works, varied in style as in subjects.

Among his ambitious efforts are Frederick the Great in Stettin, Blücher in Rostock and Luther in Wittenberg. His portrait statues of Frederick the Great with the dogs and the Princess Monument Louise and her sister Frederica with the princesses Louise and Federica became very popular. The second one was copied many times illegally which lead to a temporary dispute between his gypsum modeler Beyer and the sculptor in September 1795. His busts, of which there are more than one hundred, include seventeen colossal heads in the Walhalla, Ratisbon; Goethe, Wieland, and Fichte were modelled from life.

Of church monuments and memorial works thirty are enumerated; yet Schadow hardly ranks among Christian sculptors. He is claimed by classicists and idealists: the quadriga on the Brandenburger Tor and the allegorical frieze on the facade of the Royal Mint, both in Berlin, are judged among the happiest studies from the antique. Schadow, as director of the Berlin Academy, had great influence. He wrote on the proportions of the human figure, on national physiognomy, etc.; and many volumes by himself and others describe and illustrate his method and his work.

His interest in physiognomy is documented by the drawing he made of Harry Maitey, the first Hawaiian in Prussia.

Today, some of his sculptures and busts are displayed in the Friedrichswerdersche Kirche and the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin.

Schadow developed a friendship with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe when at first Goethe&#x27;s son visited Schadow in Weimar. Schadow created 12 bronze medals of Goethe. One such medal is in the property of the British Museum.

He died in Berlin in 1850. His sons Rudolph and Friedrich Wilhelm were notable for sculpture and painting, respectively. He was the grandfather of admiral Felix von Bendemann of the German Imperial Navy.

==Family==
He was uncle to the sculptor Emil Wolff.

Banatao (born May 23, 1946) is a Filipino entrepreneur and engineer working in the high-tech industry, credited with having developed the first 10-Mbit Ethernet CMOS with silicon coupler data-link control and transceiver chip, the first system logic chipset for IBM&#x27;s PC-XT and the PC-AT, and one of the first graphical user interface (GUI) accelerators for personal computers. A three-time start-up veteran, he co-founded Mostron, Chips and Technologies, and S3 Graphics.

==Background==
Banatao was born on May 23, 1946 in Iguig, Cagayan, Philippines. His father, Salvador Banatao, was a rice farmer. His mother, Rosita Banatao, was a housekeeper.

Banatao is known for his rags to riches story. During his childhood, he walked barefoot on a dirt road just to reach Malabbac Elementary School. He pursued his secondary education at the Jesuit-run Ateneo de Tuguegarao. After high school, he pursued his Bachelor of Science in Electric Engineering from the Mapúa Institute of Technology and graduated cum laude.

After college, he turned down several job offers, including one from Meralco. He joined Philippine Airlines as a trainee pilot, and later joined Boeing. At Boeing, he worked as a design engineer for the company&#x27;s new commercial airliner and cargo transport aircraft, Boeing 747, in the United States. With the opportunity to stay in the United States, he then took his Master of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Stanford University and finished in 1972. Banatao also joined the Homebrew Computer Club, where he met Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.

After finishing his master&#x27;s degree, Banatao worked with different technology companies such as the National Semiconductor, Intersil, and Commodore International where he designed the first single chip, 16-bit microprocessor-based calculator. In 1981, he developed the first 10-Mbit Ethernet CMOS with silicon coupler data-link control and transceiver chip while working in Seeq Technology. He was also credited for the first system logic chip set for IBM&#x27;s PC-XT and the PC-AT; the local bus concept and one of the first the first GUI accelerator chips for personal computers.

==Career==
===Business===
In 1984, Banatao and his business partner Francis Siu, founded a high-technology company, Moston, starting with a capital of half a million US dollars. Mostron was launched as a manufacturer of motherboards. They also hired Ron Yara of Intel as a company executive. After he developed a five-chip set, he co-founded Chips and Technologies in 1985. The company developed system logic chip set for IBM&#x27;s PC-XT and the PC-AT. The company earned $12 million in its first four months. After 22 months, the company went public. In 1989, Banatao launched his third start-up company, S3 Graphics, with Yara in Santa Clara, California. S3 focused on enhancing the graphic capabilities in personal computers by using a graphic accelerator chip. The key to this was Banatao&#x27;s invention of a local bus. The company had an initial public offering of $30 million. In 1996, the company became the leader of the graphic-chips market, beating a strong competitor, Cirrus Logic, Inc. In the same year, Chips &amp; Technologies was sold to Intel for about $300 million. In 2000, he decided to start his own venture capital firm named &quot;Tallwood Venture Capital&quot; with a capital of US$300 million, all of which came from his own pocket. He later sold another company for more than $1 billion, where it had less than 20 employees. Dado was also part of SiRF, where it started the consumerization of GPS after it had been declassified by the US Government.

In 2010, Banatao became Ikanos Communications&#x27; CEO after Michael Gulett resigned as the company&#x27;s CEO and President.

===Philanthropy===
In the Philippines, Banatao through his Dado Banatao Educational Foundation, annually awards five educational scholarships to intelligent Filipino students who have bright futures in the field of engineering and technology. Also, with Philippine Development Foundation which he chairs, he is helping send brilliant young Filipinos to school to help them reach their full potential. PhilDev was spun off from Ayala Foundation&#x27;s program.
 Through his Banatao Filipino American Fund, he assists Californian high school students of Filipino heritage who are pursuing a college education in engineering. He also built a computer center at his grade school in his childhood town of Iguig in Cagayan Valley, making it the only public school with the most modern computer network in the Philippines.

<text>Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI, or as an acronym) is a specification for the firmware architecture of a computing platform. When a computer is powered on, the UEFI-implementation is typically the first that runs, before starting the operating system. Examples include AMI Aptio, Phoenix SecureCore, TianoCore EDK II, InsydeH2O. 

UEFI replaces the BIOS that was present in the boot ROM of all personal computers that are IBM PC compatible, although it can provide backwards compatibility with the BIOS using CSM booting. Unlike its predecessor, BIOS, which is a de facto standard originally created by IBM as proprietary software, UEFI is an open standard maintained by an industry consortium. Like BIOS, most UEFI implementations are proprietary.

Intel developed the original &quot;Extensible Firmware Interface&quot; (&quot;EFI&quot;) specification. The last Intel version of EFI was 1.10 released in 2005. Subsequent versions have been developed as UEFI by the UEFI Forum.

UEFI is independent of platform and programming language, but C is used for the reference implementation TianoCore EDKII.

== History ==
The original motivation for EFI came during early development of the first Intel–HP Itanium systems in the mid-1990s. BIOS limitations (such as 16-bit real mode, 1 MB addressable memory space, assembly language programming, and PC AT hardware) had become too restrictive for the larger server platforms Itanium was targeting. The effort to address these concerns began in 1998 and was initially called &quot;Intel Boot Initiative&quot;. It was later renamed to &quot;Extensible Firmware Interface&quot; (EFI).

The first open source UEFI implementation, Tiano, was released by Intel in 2004. Tiano has since then been superseded by EDK and EDK II and is now maintained by the TianoCore community.

In July 2005, Intel ceased its development of the EFI specification at version 1.10, and contributed it to the Unified EFI Forum, which has developed the specification as the &quot;Unified Extensible Firmware Interface&quot; (UEFI). The original EFI specification remains owned by Intel, which exclusively provides licenses for EFI-based products, but the UEFI specification is owned by the UEFI Forum.

Version 2.0 of the UEFI specification was released on 31 January 2006. It added cryptography and security.

Version 2.1 of the UEFI specification was released on 7 January 2007. It added network authentication and the user interface architecture (&#x27;Human Interface Infrastructure&#x27; in UEFI).

In October 2018, Arm announced Arm ServerReady, a compliance certification program for landing the generic off-the-shelf operating systems and hypervisors on Arm-based servers. The program requires the system firmware to comply with Server Base Boot Requirements (SBBR). SBBR requires UEFI, ACPI and SMBIOS compliance. In October 2020, Arm announced the extension of the program to the edge and IoT market. The new program name is Arm SystemReady. Arm SystemReady defined the Base Boot Requirements (BBR) specification that currently provides three recipes, two of which are related to UEFI: 1) SBBR: which requires UEFI, ACPI and SMBIOS compliance suitable for enterprise level operating environments such as Windows, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and VMware ESXi; and 2) EBBR: which requires compliance to a set of UEFI interfaces as defined in the Embedded Base Boot Requirements (EBBR) suitable for embedded environments such as Yocto. Many Linux and BSD distros can support both recipes.

In December 2018, Microsoft announced Project Mu, a fork of TianoCore EDK II used in Microsoft Surface and Hyper-V products. The project promotes the idea of firmware as a service.

The latest UEFI specification, version 2.11, was published in December 2024.

== Advantages ==
The interface defined by the EFI specification includes data tables that contain platform information, and boot and runtime services that are available to the OS loader and OS. UEFI firmware provides several technical advantages over a BIOS:

* Ability to boot a disk containing large partitions (over 2 TB) with a GUID Partition Table (GPT)
* Flexible pre-OS environment, including network capability, GUI, multi language
* 32-bit (for example IA-32, ARM32) or 64-bit (for example x64, AArch64) pre-OS environment
* C language programming
* Python programming using Python interpreter for UEFI shell
* Modular design
* Backward and forward compatibility

With UEFI, it is possible to store product keys for operating systems such as Windows, on the UEFI firmware of the device. UEFI is required for Secure Boot on devices shipping with Windows 8 and above.

It is also possible for operating systems to access UEFI configuration data.

== Compatibility ==

=== Processor compatibility ===
As of version 2.5, processor bindings exist for Itanium, x86, x86-64, ARM (AArch32) and ARM64 (AArch64). Only little-endian processors can be supported. Unofficial UEFI support is under development for POWERPC64 by implementing TianoCore on top of OPAL, the OpenPOWER abstraction layer, running in little-endian mode. Similar projects exist for MIPS and RISC-V. As of UEFI 2.7, RISC-V processor bindings have been officially established for 32-, 64- and 128-bit modes.

Standard PC BIOS is limited to a 16-bit processor mode and 1 MB of addressable memory space, resulting from the design based on the IBM 5150 that used a 16-bit Intel 8088 processor. In comparison, the processor mode in a UEFI environment can be either 32-bit (IA-32, AArch32) or 64-bit (x86-64, Itanium, and AArch64). 64-bit UEFI firmware implementations support long mode, which allows applications in the preboot environment to use 64-bit addressing to get direct access to all of the machine&#x27;s memory.

UEFI requires the firmware and operating system loader (or kernel) to be size-matched; that is, a 64-bit UEFI firmware implementation can load only a 64-bit operating system (OS) boot loader or kernel (unless the CSM-based &quot;legacy boot&quot; is used) and the same applies to 32-bit. After the system transitions from &quot;boot services&quot; to &quot;runtime services&quot;, the operating system kernel takes over. At this point, the kernel can change processor modes if it desires, but this bars usage of the runtime services (unless the kernel switches back again). As of version 3.15, the Linux kernel supports 64-bit kernels to be booted on 32-bit UEFI firmware implementations running on x86-64 CPUs, with &quot;UEFI handover&quot; support from a UEFI boot loader as the requirement. UEFI handover protocol deduplicates the UEFI initialization code between the kernel and UEFI boot loaders, leaving the initialization to be performed only by the Linux kernel&#x27;s &quot;UEFI boot stub&quot;.

=== Disk device compatibility ===
In addition to the standard PC disk partition scheme that uses a master boot record (MBR), UEFI also works with the GUID Partition Table (GPT) partitioning scheme, which is free from many of the limitations of MBR. In particular, the MBR limits on the number and size of disk partitions (up to four primary partitions per disk, and up to 2 TB per disk) are relaxed. More specifically, GPT allows for a maximum disk and partition size of 8 ZiB .

==== Linux ====

Support for GPT in Linux is enabled by turning on the option codice_1 (EFI GUID Partition Support) during kernel configuration. This option allows Linux to recognize and use GPT disks after the system firmware passes control over the system to Linux.

For reverse compatibility, Linux can use GPT disks in BIOS-based systems for both data storage and booting, as both GRUB 2 and Linux are GPT-aware. Such a setup is usually referred to as &quot;BIOS-GPT&quot;. As GPT incorporates the protective MBR, a BIOS-based computer can boot from a GPT disk using a GPT-aware boot loader stored in the protective MBR&#x27;s bootstrap code area. In the case of GRUB, such a configuration requires a BIOS boot partition for GRUB to embed its second-stage code due to absence of the post-MBR gap in GPT partitioned disks (which is taken over by the GPT&#x27;s &quot;Primary Header&quot; and &quot;Primary Partition Table&quot;). Commonly 1 MB in size, this partition&#x27;s Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) in GPT scheme is and is used by GRUB only in BIOS-GPT setups. From GRUB&#x27;s perspective, no such partition type exists in case of MBR partitioning. This partition is not required if the system is UEFI-based because no embedding of the second-stage code is needed in that case.

UEFI systems can access GPT disks and boot directly from them, which allows Linux to use UEFI boot methods. Booting Linux from GPT disks on UEFI systems involves creation of an EFI system partition (ESP), which contains UEFI applications such as bootloaders, operating system kernels, and utility software. Such a setup is usually referred to as &quot;UEFI-GPT&quot;, while ESP is recommended to be at least 512 MB in size and formatted with a FAT32 filesystem for maximum compatibility.

For backward compatibility, some UEFI implementations also support booting from MBR-partitioned disks through the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) that provides legacy BIOS compatibility. In that case, booting Linux on UEFI systems is the same as on legacy BIOS-based systems.

==== Microsoft Windows ====

Some of the EFI&#x27;s practices and data formats mirror those of Microsoft Windows. 

The 64-bit versions of Windows Vista SP1 and later and 64-bit versions of Windows 8, 8.1, 10, and 11 can boot from a GPT disk that is larger than 2 TB.

== Features ==

=== Services ===

EFI defines two types of services: &quot;boot services&quot; and &quot;runtime services&quot;. Boot services are available only while the firmware owns the platform (i.e., before the codice_2 call), and they include text and graphical consoles on various devices, and bus, block and file services. Runtime services are still accessible while the operating system is running; they include services such as date, time and NVRAM access.

; Graphics Output Protocol (GOP) services
: The &quot;Graphics Output Protocol&quot; (GOP) provides runtime services; see also Graphics features section below. The operating system is permitted to directly write to the framebuffer provided by GOP during runtime mode.

; UEFI Memory map services

; SMM services

; ACPI services

; SMBIOS services

; Devicetree services (for RISC processors)

; Variable services
: UEFI variables provide a way to store data, in particular non-volatile data. Some UEFI variables are shared between platform firmware and operating systems. Variable namespaces are identified by GUIDs, and variables are key/value pairs. For example, UEFI variables can be used to keep crash messages in NVRAM after a crash for the operating system to retrieve after a reboot.

; Time services
: UEFI provides time services. Time services include support for time zone and daylight saving fields, which allow the hardware real-time clock to be set to local time or UTC. On machines using a PC-AT real-time clock, by default the hardware clock still has to be set to local time for compatibility with BIOS-based Windows, unless using recent versions and an entry in the Windows registry is set to indicate the use of UTC.

=== Applications ===
Beyond loading an OS, UEFI can run &quot;UEFI applications&quot;, which reside as files on the EFI system partition. They can be executed from the UEFI Shell, by the firmware&#x27;s boot manager, or by other UEFI applications. &quot;UEFI applications&quot; can be developed and installed independently of the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

A type of UEFI application is an OS boot loader such as GRUB, rEFInd, Gummiboot, and Windows Boot Manager, which loads some OS files into memory and executes them. Also, an OS boot loader can provide a user interface to allow the selection of another UEFI application to run. Utilities like the UEFI Shell are also UEFI applications.

=== Protocols ===
EFI defines protocols as a set of software interfaces used for communication between two binary modules. All EFI drivers must provide services to others via protocols. The EFI Protocols are similar to the BIOS interrupt calls.

=== Device drivers ===
In addition to standard instruction set architecture-specific device drivers, EFI provides for a ISA-independent device driver stored in non-volatile memory as &quot;EFI byte code&quot; or &quot;EBC&quot;. System firmware has an interpreter for EBC images. In that sense, EBC is analogous to Open Firmware, the ISA-independent firmware used in PowerPC-based Apple Macintosh and Sun Microsystems SPARC computers, among others.

Some architecture-specific (non-EFI Byte Code) EFI drivers for some device types can have interfaces for use by the OS. This allows the OS to rely on EFI for drivers to perform basic graphics and network functions before, and if, operating-system-specific drivers are loaded.

In other cases, the EFI driver can be filesystem drivers that allow for booting from other types of disk volumes. Examples include &quot;efifs&quot; for 37 file systems (based on GRUB2 code), used by Rufus for chain-loading NTFS ESPs.

=== Graphics features ===
The EFI 1.0 specification defined a UGA (Universal Graphic Adapter) protocol as a way to support graphics features. UEFI did not include UGA and replaced it with GOP (Graphics Output Protocol).

UEFI 2.1 defined a &quot;Human Interface Infrastructure&quot; (HII) to manage user input, localized strings, fonts, and forms (in the HTML sense). These enable original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or independent BIOS vendors (IBVs) to design graphical interfaces for pre-boot configuration. UEFI uses UTF-16 to encode strings by default.

Most early UEFI firmware implementations were console-based. Today many UEFI firmware implementations are GUI-based.

=== EFI system partition ===
An EFI system partition, often abbreviated to ESP, is a data storage device partition that is used in computers adhering to the UEFI specification. Accessed by the UEFI firmware when a computer is powered up, it stores UEFI applications and the files these applications need to run, including operating system boot loaders. Supported partition table schemes include MBR and GPT, as well as El Torito volumes on optical discs. For use on ESPs, UEFI defines a specific version of the FAT file system, which is maintained as part of the UEFI specification and independently from the original FAT specification, encompassing the FAT32, FAT16 and FAT12 file systems. The ESP also provides space for a boot sector as part of the backward BIOS compatibility.

=== Booting ===

==== UEFI booting ====
Unlike the legacy PC BIOS, UEFI does not rely on boot sectors, defining instead a boot manager as part of the UEFI specification. When a computer is powered on, the boot manager checks the boot configuration and, based on its settings, then executes the specified OS boot loader or operating system kernel (usually boot loader). The boot configuration is defined by variables stored in NVRAM, including variables that indicate the file system paths to OS loaders or OS kernels.

OS boot loaders can be automatically detected by UEFI, which enables easy booting from removable devices such as USB flash drives. This automated detection relies on standardized file paths to the OS boot loader, with the path varying depending on the computer architecture. The format of the file path is defined as ; for example, the file path to the OS loader on an x86-64 system is , and on ARM64 architecture.

Booting UEFI systems from GPT-partitioned disks is commonly called &quot;UEFI-GPT booting&quot;. Despite the fact that the UEFI specification requires MBR partition tables to be fully supported, some UEFI firmware implementations immediately switch to the BIOS-based CSM booting depending on the type of boot disk&#x27;s partition table, effectively preventing UEFI booting to be performed from EFI System Partition on MBR-partitioned disks. Such a boot scheme is commonly called &quot;UEFI-MBR&quot;.

It is also common for a boot manager to have a textual user interface so the user can select the desired OS (or setup utility) from a list of available boot options.

==== CSM booting ====
To ensure backward compatibility, UEFI firmware implementations on PC-class machines could support booting in legacy BIOS mode from MBR-partitioned disks through the &quot;Compatibility Support Module (CSM)&quot; that provides legacy BIOS compatibility. In this scenario, booting is performed in the same way as on legacy BIOS-based systems, by ignoring the partition table and relying on the content of a boot sector.

BIOS-style booting from MBR-partitioned disks is commonly called &quot;BIOS-MBR&quot;, regardless of it being performed on UEFI or legacy BIOS-based systems. Furthermore, booting legacy BIOS-based systems from GPT disks is also possible, and such a boot scheme is commonly called &quot;BIOS-GPT&quot;.

The &quot;Compatibility Support Module&quot; allows legacy operating systems and some legacy option ROMs that do not support UEFI to still be used. It also provides required legacy System Management Mode (SMM) functionality, called &quot;CompatibilitySmm&quot;, as an addition to features provided by the UEFI SMM. An example of such a legacy SMM functionality is providing USB legacy support for keyboard and mouse, by emulating their classic PS/2 counterparts.

In November 2017, Intel announced that it planned to phase out support CSM for client platforms by 2020.

In July, of 2022, Kaspersky Labs published information regarding a Rootkit designed to chain boot malicious code on machines using Intel&#x27;s H81 chipset and the Compatibility Support module of affected motherboards.

In August 2023, Intel announced that it planned to phase out support CSM for server platforms by 2024.

As of today, all computers based on Intel platforms no longer have CSM support.

==== Network booting ====
The UEFI specification includes support for booting over network via the Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE). PXE booting network protocols include Internet Protocol (IPv4 and IPv6), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) and iSCSI.

OS images can be remotely stored on storage area networks (SANs), with Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) and Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) as supported protocols for accessing the SANs.

Version 2.5 of the UEFI specification adds support for accessing boot images over HTTP.

==== Secure Boot ====
The UEFI specification defines a protocol known as &quot;Secure Boot&quot;, which can secure the boot process by preventing the loading of UEFI drivers or OS boot loaders that are not signed with an acceptable digital signature. The mechanical details of how precisely these drivers are to be signed are not specified. When Secure Boot is enabled, it is initially placed in &quot;setup&quot; mode, which allows a public key known as the &quot;platform key&quot; (PK) to be written to the firmware. Once the key is written, Secure Boot enters &quot;User&quot; mode, where only UEFI drivers and OS boot loaders signed with the platform key can be loaded by the firmware. Additional &quot;key exchange keys&quot; (KEK) can be added to a database stored in memory to allow other certificates to be used, but they must still have a connection to the private portion of the platform key. Secure Boot can also be placed in &quot;Custom&quot; mode, where additional public keys can be added to the system that do not match the private key.

Secure Boot is supported by Windows 8 and 8.1, Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2, Windows 10, Windows Server 2016, 2019, and 2022, and Windows 11, VMware vSphere 6.5 and a number of Linux distributions including Fedora (since version 18), openSUSE (since version 12.3), RHEL (since version 7), CentOS (since version 7), Debian (since version 10), Ubuntu (since version 12.04.2), Linux Mint (since version 21.3)., and AlmaLinux OS (since version 8.4). , FreeBSD support is in a planning stage.

It has been observed, though, that Secure Boot causes issues with software, such as the Unity Engine, running on Linux (particularly Fedora Linux) and with the system locking up requiring a hard reboot. This issue also persists over into playing video games via Steam using Proton compatibility tools where games will crash repeatedly.

=== UEFI shell ===

UEFI provides a shell environment, which can be used to execute other UEFI applications, including UEFI boot loaders. Apart from that, commands available in the UEFI shell can be used for obtaining various other information about the system or the firmware, including getting the memory map (codice_3), modifying boot manager variables (codice_4), running partitioning programs (codice_5), loading UEFI drivers, and editing text files (codice_6).

Source code for a UEFI shell can be downloaded from the Intel&#x27;s TianoCore UDK/EDK2 project. A pre-built ShellBinPkg is also available. Shell v2 works best in UEFI 2.3+ systems and is recommended over Shell v1 in those systems. Shell v1 should work in all UEFI systems.

Methods used for launching UEFI shell depend on the manufacturer and model of the system motherboard. Some of them already provide a direct option in firmware setup for launching, e.g. compiled x86-64 version of the shell needs to be made available as codice_7. Some other systems have an already embedded UEFI shell which can be launched by appropriate key press combinations. For other systems, the solution is either creating an appropriate USB flash drive or adding manually (codice_4) a boot option associated with the compiled version of shell.

=== Extensions ===
Extensions to UEFI can be loaded from virtually any non-volatile storage device attached to the computer. For example, an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) can distribute systems with an EFI system partition on the hard drive, which would add additional functions to the standard UEFI firmware stored on the motherboard&#x27;s ROM.

=== UEFI Capsule ===
UEFI Capsule defines a Firmware-to-OS firmware update interface, marketed as modern and secure. Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and Fwupd for Linux each support the UEFI Capsule.

=== Hardware ===
Like BIOS, UEFI initializes and tests system hardware components (e.g. memory training, PCIe link training, USB link training on typical x86 systems), and then loads the boot loader from a mass storage device or through a network connection. In x86 systems, the UEFI firmware is usually stored in the NOR flash chip of the motherboard. In some ARM-based Android and Windows Phone devices, the UEFI boot loader is stored in the eMMC or eUFS flash memory.

== Classes ==
UEFI machines can have one of the following classes, which were used to help ease the transition to UEFI:

* Class 0: Legacy BIOS
* Class 1: UEFI with a CSM interface and no external UEFI interface. The only UEFI interfaces are internal to the firmware.
* Class 2: UEFI with CSM and external UEFI interfaces, eg. UEFI Boot.
* Class 3: UEFI without a CSM interface and with an external UEFI interface.
* Class 3+: UEFI class 3 that has Secure Boot enabled.

Starting from the 10th Gen Intel Core, Intel no longer provides Legacy Video BIOS for the iGPU (Intel Graphics Technology). Legacy boot with those CPUs requires a Legacy Video BIOS, which can still be provided by a video card.

== Boot stages ==
=== SEC – Security Phase ===
This is the first stage of the UEFI boot but may have platform specific binary code that precedes it. (e.g., Intel ME, AMD PSP, CPU microcode). It consists of minimal code written in assembly language for the specific architecture. It initializes a temporary memory (often CPU cache-as-RAM (CAR), or SoC on-chip SRAM) and serves as the system&#x27;s software root of trust with the option of verifying PEI before hand-off.

=== PEI – Pre-EFI Initialization ===
The second stage of UEFI boot consists of a dependency-aware dispatcher that loads and runs PEI modules (PEIMs) to handle early hardware initialization tasks such as main memory initialization (initialize memory controller and DRAM) and firmware recovery operations. Additionally, it is responsible for discovery of the current boot mode and handling many ACPI S3 operations. In the case of ACPI S3 resume, it is responsible for restoring many hardware registers to a pre-sleep state. PEI also uses CAR. Initialization at this stage involves creating data structures in memory and establishing default values within these structures.

=== DXE – Driver Execution Environment ===
This stage consist of C modules and a dependency-aware dispatcher. With main memory now available, CPU, chipset, mainboard and other I/O devices are initialized in DXE and BDS. Initialization at this stage involves assigning EFI device paths to the hardware connected to the motherboard, and transferring configuration data to the hardware.

=== BDS – Boot Device Select ===
BDS is a part of the DXE. In this stage, boot devices are initialized, UEFI drivers or Option ROMs of PCI devices are executed according to system configuration, and boot options are processed.

=== TSL – Transient System Load ===
This is the stage between boot device selection and hand-off to the OS. At this point one may enter a UEFI shell, or execute a UEFI application such as the OS boot loader.

=== RT – Runtime ===
The UEFI hands off to the operating system (OS) after is executed. A UEFI compatible OS is now responsible for exiting boot services triggering the firmware to unload all no longer needed code and data, leaving only runtime services code/data, e.g. SMM and ACPI. A typical modern OS will prefer to use its own programs (such as kernel drivers) to control hardware devices.

When a legacy OS is used, CSM will handle this call ensuring the system is compatible with legacy BIOS expectations.

== Usage ==
=== Implementations ===

Intel&#x27;s implementation of EFI is the &quot;Intel Platform Innovation Framework&quot;, codenamed &quot;Tiano&quot;. Tiano runs on Intel&#x27;s XScale, Itanium, IA-32 and x86-64 processors, and is proprietary software, although a portion of the code has been released under the BSD license or Eclipse Public License (EPL) as TianoCore EDK II. TianoCore can be used as a payload for coreboot.

Phoenix Technologies&#x27; implementation of UEFI is branded as SecureCore Technology (SCT). American Megatrends offers its own UEFI firmware implementation known as Aptio, while Insyde Software offers InsydeH2O, and Byosoft offers ByoCore.

In December 2018, Microsoft released an open source version of its TianoCore EDK2-based UEFI implementation from the Surface line, Project Mu.

An implementation of the UEFI API was introduced into the Universal Boot Loader (Das U-Boot) in 2017. On the ARMv8 architecture Linux distributions use the U-Boot UEFI implementation in conjunction with GNU GRUB for booting (e.g. SUSE Linux), the same holds true for OpenBSD. For booting from iSCSI iPXE can be used as a UEFI application loaded by U-Boot.

=== Platforms ===
Intel&#x27;s first Itanium workstations and servers, released in 2000, implemented EFI 1.02.

Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s first Itanium 2 systems, released in 2002, implemented EFI 1.10; they were able to boot Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and HP-UX; OpenVMS added UEFI capability in June 2003.

In January 2006, Apple Inc. shipped its first Intel-based Macintosh computers. These systems used EFI instead of Open Firmware, which had been used on its previous PowerPC-based systems. On 5 April 2006, Apple first released Boot Camp, which produces a Windows drivers disk and a non-destructive partitioning tool to allow the installation of Windows XP or Vista without requiring a reinstallation of Mac OS X (now macOS). A firmware update was also released that added BIOS compatibility to its EFI implementation. Subsequent Macintosh models shipped with the newer firmware.

During 2005, more than one million Intel systems shipped with Intel&#x27;s implementation of UEFI. New mobile, desktop and server products, using Intel&#x27;s implementation of UEFI, started shipping in 2006. For instance, boards that use the Intel 945 chipset series use Intel&#x27;s UEFI firmware implementation.

Since 2005, EFI has also been implemented on non-PC architectures, such as embedded systems based on XScale cores.

The EDK (EFI Developer Kit) includes an NT32 target, which allows EFI firmware and EFI applications to run within a Windows application. But no direct hardware access is allowed by EDK NT32. This means only a subset of EFI application and drivers can be executed by the EDK NT32 target.

In 2008, more x86-64 systems adopted UEFI. While many of these systems still allow booting only the BIOS-based OSes via the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) (thus not appearing to the user to be UEFI-based), other systems started to allow booting UEFI-based OSes. For example, IBM x3450 server, MSI motherboards with ClickBIOS, HP EliteBook Notebook PCs.

In 2009, IBM shipped System x machines (x3550 M2, x3650 M2, iDataPlex dx360 M2) and BladeCenter HS22 with UEFI capability. Dell shipped PowerEdge T610, R610, R710, M610 and M710 servers with UEFI capability. More commercially available systems are mentioned in a UEFI whitepaper.

In 2011, major vendors (such as ASRock, Asus, Gigabyte, and MSI) launched several consumer-oriented motherboards using the Intel 6-series LGA 1155 chipset and AMD 9 Series AM3+ chipsets with UEFI.

With the release of Windows 8 in October 2012, Microsoft&#x27;s certification requirements now require that computers include firmware that implements the UEFI specification. Furthermore, if the computer supports the &quot;Connected Standby&quot; feature of Windows 8 (which allows devices to have power management comparable to smartphones, with an almost instantaneous return from standby mode), then the firmware is not permitted to contain a Compatibility Support Module (CSM). As such, systems that support Connected Standby are incapable of booting Legacy BIOS operating systems.

In October 2017, Intel announced that it would remove legacy PC BIOS support from all its products by 2020, in favor of UEFI Class 3. By 2019, all computers based on Intel platforms no longer have legacy PC BIOS support.

=== Operating systems ===
An operating system that can be booted from a (U)EFI is called a (U)EFI-aware operating system, defined by (U)EFI specification. Here the term &quot;booted from a (U)EFI&quot; means directly booting the system using a (U)EFI operating system loader stored on any storage device. The default location for the operating system loader is codice_9, where short name of the machine type can be codice_10, codice_11, codice_12, codice_13 or codice_14. Some operating systems vendors may have their own boot loaders. They may also change the default boot location.

* The Linux kernel has been able to use EFI at boot time since early 2000s, using the elilo EFI boot loader or, more recently, EFI versions of GRUB. Grub+Linux also supports booting from a GUID partition table without UEFI. The distribution Ubuntu added support for UEFI Secure Boot as of version 12.10. Furthermore, the Linux kernel can be compiled with the option to run as an EFI bootloader on its own through the EFI boot stub feature.
* HP-UX has used (U)EFI as its boot mechanism on IA-64 systems since 2002.
* OpenVMS has used EFI on IA-64 since its initial evaluation release in December 2003, and for production releases since January 2005. OpenVMS on x86-64 also uses UEFI to boot the operating system.
* Apple uses EFI for its line of Intel-based Macs. Mac OS X v10.4 Tiger and Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard implement EFI v1.10 in 32-bit mode even on newer 64-bit CPUs, but full support arrived with OS X v10.8 Mountain Lion.
* The Itanium versions of Windows 2000 (Advanced Server Limited Edition and Datacenter Server Limited Edition; based on the pre-release Windows Server 2003 codebase) implemented EFI 1.10 in 2002. Windows XP 64-bit Edition, Windows 2000 Advanced Server Limited Edition (pre-release Windows Server 2003) and Windows Server 2003 for IA-64, all of which are for the Intel Itanium family of processors, implement EFI, a requirement of the platform through the DIG64 specification.
* Microsoft introduced UEFI for x64 Windows operating systems with Windows Vista SP1 and Windows Server 2008 however only UGA (Universal Graphic Adapter) 1.1 or Legacy BIOS INT 10h is supported; Graphics Output Protocol (GOP) is not supported. Therefore, PCs running 64-bit versions of Windows Vista SP1, Windows Vista SP2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2 are compatible with UEFI Class 2. 32-bit UEFI was originally not supported since vendors did not have any interest in producing native 32-bit UEFI firmware because of the mainstream status of 64-bit computing. Windows 8 finally introduced further optimizations for UEFI systems, including Graphics Output Protocol (GOP) support, a faster startup, 32-bit UEFI support, and Secure Boot support. Since Windows 8, the UEFI firmware with ACPI protocol is a mandatory requirement for ARM-based Microsoft Windows operating systems. Microsoft began requiring UEFI to run Windows with Windows 11, with IoT Enterprise editions of Windows 11 since version 24H2 exempt from the requirement.
* On 5 March 2013, the FreeBSD Foundation awarded a grant to a developer seeking to add UEFI support to the FreeBSD kernel and bootloader. The changes were initially stored in a discrete branch of the FreeBSD source code, but were merged into the mainline source on 4 April 2014 (revision 264095); the changes include support in the installer as well. UEFI boot support for amd64 first appeared in FreeBSD 10.1 and for arm64 in FreeBSD 11.0.
* Oracle Solaris 11.1 and later support UEFI boot for x86 systems with UEFI firmware version 2.1 or later. GRUB 2 is used as the boot loader on x86.
* OpenBSD 5.9 introduced UEFI boot support for 64-bit x86 systems using its own custom loader, OpenBSD 6.0 extended that support to include ARMv7.
* illumos added basic UEFI support in October 2017.
* ArcaOS supports UEFI booting since the 5.1 release. ArcaOS&#x27; UEFI support emulates specific BIOS functionality which the operating system depends on (particularly interrupts INT 10H and INT 13H).

=== With virtualization ===
* HP Integrity Virtual Machines provides UEFI boot on HP Integrity Servers. It also provides a virtualized UEFI environment for the guest UEFI-aware OSes.
* Intel hosts an Open Virtual Machine Firmware project on SourceForge.
* VMware Fusion 3 software for Mac OS X can boot Mac OS X Server virtual machines using UEFI.
* VMware Workstation prior to version 11 unofficially supports UEFI, but is manually enabled by editing the .vmx file. VMware Workstation version 11 and above supports UEFI, independently of whether the physical host system is UEFI-based. VMware Workstation 14 (and accordingly, Fusion 10) adds support for the Secure Boot feature of UEFI.
* The VMware ESXi 5.0 hypervisor officially supports UEFI. Version 6.5 adds support for Secure Boot.
* VirtualBox has implemented UEFI since 3.1, but is limited to Unix/Linux operating systems and Windows 8 and later (does not work with Windows Vista x64 and Windows 7 x64).
* QEMU/KVM can be used with the Open Virtual Machine Firmware (OVMF) provided by TianoCore.
* The second generation of the Microsoft Hyper-V virtual machine supports virtualized UEFI.
* Google Cloud Platform Shielded VMs support virtualized UEFI to enable Secure Boot.

== Applications development ==
&quot;EDK2 Application Development Kit&quot; (EADK) makes it possible to use standard C library functions in UEFI applications. EADK can be freely downloaded from the Intel&#x27;s TianoCore UDK / EDK2 SourceForge project. As an example, a port of the Python interpreter is made available as a UEFI application by using the EADK. The development has moved to GitHub since UDK2015.

A minimalistic &quot;hello, world&quot; C program written using EADK looks similar to its usual C counterpart:
#include &lt;Uefi.h&gt;
#include &lt;Library/UefiLib.h&gt;
#include &lt;Library/ShellCEntryLib.h&gt;

EFI_STATUS EFIAPI ShellAppMain(IN UINTN Argc, IN CHAR16 **Argv)
 Print(L&quot;hello, world\n&quot;);
 return EFI_SUCCESS;


== Criticism ==
Numerous digital rights activists have protested UEFI.
Ronald G. Minnich, a co-author of coreboot, and Cory Doctorow, a digital rights activist, have criticized UEFI as an attempt to remove the ability of the user to truly control the computer. It does not solve the BIOS&#x27;s long-standing problems of requiring two different drivers—one for the firmware and one for the operating system—for most hardware.

Open-source project TianoCore also provides UEFIs. TianoCore lacks the specialized firmware drivers and modules that initialize chipset functions, but TianoCore is one of many payload options of coreboot. The development of coreboot requires cooperation from chipset manufacturers to provide the specifications needed to develop initialization drivers.

=== Secure Boot ===

In 2011, Microsoft announced that computers certified to run its Windows 8 operating system had to ship with Microsoft&#x27;s public key enrolled and Secure Boot enabled, which implies that using UEFI is a requirement for these devices. Following the announcement, the company was accused by critics and free software/open source advocates (including the Free Software Foundation) of trying to use the Secure Boot functionality of UEFI to hinder or outright prevent the installation of alternative operating systems such as Linux. Microsoft denied that the Secure Boot requirement was intended to serve as a form of lock-in, and clarified its requirements by stating that x86-based systems certified for Windows 8 must allow Secure Boot to enter custom mode or be disabled, but not on systems using the ARM architecture. Windows 10 allows OEMs to decide whether or not Secure Boot can be managed by users of their x86 systems.

Other developers raised concerns about the legal and practical issues of implementing support for Secure Boot on Linux systems in general. Former Red Hat developer Matthew Garrett noted that conditions in the GNU General Public License version 3 may prevent the use of the GNU GRand Unified Bootloader without a distribution&#x27;s developer disclosing the private key (however, the Free Software Foundation has since clarified its position, assuring that the responsibility to make keys available was held by the hardware manufacturer), and that it would also be difficult for advanced users to build custom kernels that could function with Secure Boot enabled without self-signing them. Other developers suggested that signed builds of Linux with another key could be provided, but noted that it would be difficult to persuade OEMs to ship their computers with the required key alongside the Microsoft key.

Several major Linux distributions have developed different implementations for Secure Boot. Garrett himself developed a minimal bootloader known as a shim, which is a precompiled, signed bootloader that allows the user to individually trust keys provided by Linux distributions. Ubuntu 12.10 uses an older version of shim pre-configured for use with Canonical&#x27;s own key that verifies only the bootloader and allows unsigned kernels to be loaded; developers believed that the practice of signing only the bootloader is more feasible, since a trusted kernel is effective at securing only the user space, and not the pre-boot state for which Secure Boot is designed to add protection. That also allows users to build their own kernels and use custom kernel modules as well, without the need to reconfigure the system. Canonical also maintains its own private key to sign installations of Ubuntu pre-loaded on certified OEM computers that run the operating system, and also plans to enforce a Secure Boot requirement as wellrequiring both a Canonical key and a Microsoft key (for compatibility reasons) to be included in their firmware. Fedora also uses shim, but requires that both the kernel and its modules be signed as well. shim has Machine Owner Key (MOK) that can be used to sign locally-compiled kernels and other software not signed by distribution maintainer.

It has been disputed whether the operating system kernel and its modules must be signed as well; while the UEFI specifications do not require it, Microsoft has asserted that their contractual requirements do, and that it reserves the right to revoke any certificates used to sign code that can be used to compromise the security of the system. In Windows, if Secure Boot is enabled, all kernel drivers must be digitally signed; non-WHQL drivers may be refused to load. In February 2013, another Red Hat developer attempted to submit a patch to the Linux kernel that would allow it to parse Microsoft&#x27;s authenticode signing using a master X.509 key embedded in PE files signed by Microsoft. However, the proposal was criticized by Linux creator Linus Torvalds, who attacked Red Hat for supporting Microsoft&#x27;s control over the Secure Boot infrastructure.

On 26 March 2013, the Spanish free software development group Hispalinux filed a formal complaint with the European Commission, contending that Microsoft&#x27;s Secure Boot requirements on OEM systems were &quot;obstructive&quot; and anti-competitive.

At the Black Hat conference in August 2013, a group of security researchers presented a series of exploits in specific vendor implementations of UEFI that could be used to exploit Secure Boot.

In August 2016 it was reported that two security researchers had found the &quot;golden key&quot; security key Microsoft uses in signing operating systems. Technically, no key was exposed, however, an exploitable binary signed by the key was. This allows any software to run as though it was genuinely signed by Microsoft and exposes the possibility of rootkit and bootkit attacks. This also makes patching the fault impossible, since any patch can be replaced (downgraded) by the (signed) exploitable binary. Microsoft responded in a statement that the vulnerability only exists in ARM architecture and Windows RT devices, and has released two patches; however, the patches do not (and cannot) remove the vulnerability, which would require key replacements in end user firmware to fix.

On March 1, 2023, researchers from ESET Cybersecurity Firm reported “The first in-the-wild UEFI bootkit bypassing UEFI Secure Boot” named ‘BlackLotus’ in their public analyses findings describing the theory behind its mechanics exploiting the patches that “do not (and cannot) remove the vulnerability”.

In August 2024, the Windows 11 and Windows 10 security updates applied the Secure Boot Advanced Targeting (SBAT) settings to device&#x27;s UEFI NVRAM, which caused some Linux distributions to fail to load. SBAT is a protocol that supported in new versions of Windows Boot Manager and shim, which refuse buggy or vulnerable intermediate bootloaders (usually older versions of Windows Boot Manager and GRUB) to load in the boot process. The change was reverted the next month.

Many Linux distributions support UEFI Secure Boot , such as RHEL (RHEL 7 and later), CentOS (CentOS 7 and later), Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian (Debian 10 and later), OpenSUSE, and SUSE Linux Enterprise.

=== Firmware problems ===
The increased prominence of UEFI firmware in devices has also led to a number of technical problems blamed on their respective implementations.

Following the release of Windows 8 in late 2012, it was discovered that certain Lenovo computer models with Secure Boot had firmware that was hardcoded to allow only executables named &quot;Windows Boot Manager&quot; or &quot;Red Hat Enterprise Linux&quot; to load, regardless of any other setting. Other problems were encountered by several Toshiba laptop models with Secure Boot that were missing certain certificates required for its proper operation.

In January 2013, a bug surrounding the UEFI implementation on some Samsung laptops was publicized, which caused them to be bricked after installing a Linux distribution in UEFI mode. While potential conflicts with a kernel module designed to access system features on Samsung laptops were initially blamed (also prompting kernel maintainers to disable the module on UEFI systems as a safety measure), Matthew Garrett discovered that the bug was actually triggered by storing too many UEFI variables to memory, and that the bug could also be triggered under Windows under certain conditions. In conclusion, he determined that the offending kernel module had caused kernel message dumps to be written to the firmware, thus triggering the bug.

<doc id="866066" wikidata="Q3125114" url="?curid=866066" title="HMS Surprise (replica ship)">
<text>HMS &quot;Surprise is a modern [[tall ship]] built at [[Lunenburg, Nova Scotia]], Canada. The vessel was built in 1970 asHMS &quot;Rose to a Phil Bolger design based on the original 18th-century British Admiralty drawings of , a 20-gun sixth-rate post ship from 1757.

==As HMS &quot;Rose&quot;==
The ship was meant to be a close replica of the original &quot;Rose&quot;, but still fill a commercial function. John Fitzhugh Millar commissioned the ship&#x27;s construction in anticipation of the US Bicentennial in 1976. In conjunction with this project, he appeared on the television show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; in 1974 and stumped the panel. Millar gave Bolger copies of the original British Admiralty drawings. Bolger modified the hull shape below the water line, sharpening up her entry so she sailed to windward better. Unlike some square-riggers, she could sail two points (22-1/2 degrees) on the wind provided that seas remained under four feet or so. Bolger also changed the arrangement of her decks, at the bank&#x27;s insistence, so that she could be used as a tavern and restaurant, though she was never used as such.

&quot;Rose&quot; was built at the Smith and Rhuland shipyard in Lunenburg, a yard which had established a reputation for large and successful replicas such as HMS in 1960 and in 1963.

The ship was inspected and certified by the United States Coast Guard. She spent the first ten years of her life in Newport, Rhode Island sailing in Newport Harbor and as a dockside attraction.

In the summer of 1972, &quot;Rose&quot; was hired for the film &quot;The Man Without a Country&quot;, a made-for-television production. Norman Rosemont Productions couldn&#x27;t find the money to take the ship out sailing, so all the filming was shot with sails set, as the ship was securely moored to the pier, next to the causeway to Goat Island.

In 1984, already in serious disrepair, she was purchased by Kaye Williams and brought to Bridgeport, Connecticut, and operated as a sail training vessel in the 1980s and 1990s, run by the HMS Rose Foundation based in Bridgeport, Connecticut, United States. In her lifetime as &quot;Rose&quot;, her figurehead had to be replaced twice, each time slightly upgraded. One was damaged in a storm off Bermuda on her way to Norfolk, Virginia, in June 1998. The figurehead was named in fun as &quot;Chester&quot; by the crew.

==Transformation into HMS &quot;Surprise&quot;==

The ship was sold to the 20th Century Fox film studio in March 2001, and underwent extensive modifications to be used in the making of the film &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot;, in which she portrayed the Royal Navy frigate HMS with a story based on several of the books by Patrick O&#x27;Brian. The modifications included a reshaped stern, all deck structures removed, the single ship&#x27;s wheel replaced by a double wheel, period fighting tops fitted, new sails, and the figurehead replaced.

==Renaming as HMS &quot;Surprise&quot;==
After the film was complete, the ship was leased and then purchased by the Maritime Museum of San Diego which began restoring her to sailing condition in September 2007. The ship was officially re-registered as &quot;HMS &quot;Surprise&quot;&quot; in honor of her role in the film. She sails several times a year, often with the museum&#x27;s other tall ships, the schooner and the 1863 barque . In 2010, she portrayed HMS &quot;Providence&quot; in the Disney adventure film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides&quot;. In 2020 the deck was replanked by the museum. The ship was briefly taken off display for work done by the Pacific Maritime Group and returned to the museum in June 2022. By 2024 the ship was in a worn condition with deteriorating paint and timbers.

==Related facts==
Although she is known by the prefix HMS, meaning His (or Her) Majesty&#x27;s Ship, she has never been commissioned in the Royal Navy.

In 1991, the Connecticut General Assembly passed &quot;An Act Concerning the HMS &quot;Rose&quot;&quot; in which the ship was commissioned as a vessel of the Connecticut Naval Militia. The act stated that the H.M.S. &quot;Rose&quot; Foundation was responsible for maintaining the ship, but when the ship was sold to 20th Century Fox, the statute was not repealed and is still in effect.

<text>Andrei Donatovich Sinyavsky (; 8 October 1925 – 25 February 1997) was a Russian writer and Soviet dissident known as a defendant in the Sinyavsky–Daniel trial of 1965.

Sinyavsky was a literary critic for &quot;Novy Mir&quot; and wrote works critical of Soviet society under the pseudonym Abram Tertz () published in the West to avoid censorship in the Soviet Union. Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel were convicted of Anti-Soviet agitation in a show trial, becoming the first Soviet writers convicted solely for their works and for fiction, and served six years at a labour camp. Sinyavsky emigrated to France in 1973 where he became a professor of Russian literature and published numerous autobiographical and retrospective works.

==Early life and education==
Andrei Donatovich Sinyavsky was born on 8 October 1925 in Moscow, Russia, the son of Donat Evgenievich Sinyavsky, a Russian nobleman from Syzran who became a member of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, and a mother of a Russian peasant background. Donat was arrested several times by the Bolsheviks after the October Revolution as an &quot;enemy of the people&quot;, and during his last stay in jail the medical authorities took his electroencephalographic reading. Sinyavsky described his father&#x27;s experiences in the autobiographical novel &quot;Goodnight!&quot;

Sinyavsky&#x27;s family was evacuated to Syzran following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, where he graduated from school in 1943. Sinyavsky was drafted into the Red Army after graduation and served as a radio engineer at an airfield. In 1945, Sinyavsky became a philology student at Moscow State University, becoming a full-time student following his demobilization from the Red Army the next year, and studied the works of Vladimir Mayakovsky. Sinyavsky graduated in 1949 and attended graduate school where he successfully defended his thesis in 1952. Sinyavsky worked at the Gorky Institute of World Literature in Moscow and taught at Moscow State University&#x27;s Faculty of Journalism and the Moscow Art Theatre School. By the end of 1960, he was admitted into the Union of Soviet Writers.

Sinyavsky became one of the leading literary critics of the &quot;Novy Mir&quot; magazine, at the time headed by Aleksandr Tvardovsky. In the early 1960s, &quot;Novy Mir&quot; was considered the most liberal legal publications in the Soviet Union, and Sinyavsky began leaning towards a dissident position. In November 1962, &quot;Novy Mir&quot; became famous for publishing Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s groundbreaking &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot;, a novella about a prisoner of the Gulag. Sinyavsky, a protégé of Boris Pasternak, described the realities of Soviet life in short fiction stories which were often critical in nature. Sinyavsky published his novels in the West under the pseudonym Abram Tertz, derived from the name of a historical Russian Jewish gangster, although Sinyavsky himself was not Jewish. Sinyavsky&#x27;s works were naturally rejected for publication by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) during a time of extreme censorship.

==Sinyavsky–Daniel trial==
On 4 September 1965, Sinyavsky was arrested along with fellow-writer and friend Yuli Daniel, and tried in the first Soviet show trial during which writers were openly convicted solely for their literary work. Sinyavsky and Daniel were arrested as part of widespread political repression in the Soviet Union due to their works critical of Soviet life being published abroad. Legally, Sinyavsky and Daniel could not be charged for their publications outside the Soviet Union, and instead were charged under Article 70 of the Russian SFSR Criminal Code for producing materials labeled as &quot;Anti-Soviet agitation&quot;. This was the first time anti-Soviet laws were applied to works of fiction. Dozens of Soviet writers and intellectuals came to the defence of Sinyavsky and Daniel, and on 5 December 1965 held the Glasnost meeting in Moscow, the first spontaneous public political demonstration in the Soviet Union after the Second World War. The Sinyavsky–Daniel trial was accompanied by harsh propaganda campaigns in the Soviet media, perceived as a sign of demise of the Khrushchev Thaw which had allowed greater freedoms of expression during the late 1950s and early 1960s.

On 14 February 1966, Sinyavsky was sentenced to seven years on charges of &quot;anti-Soviet activity&quot; for the opinions of his fictional characters. After the trial, 63 supporters of Sinyavsky and Daniel signed a petition requesting their release. In response to the petition, members of the Secretariat of the Union of Soviet Writers spoke out against Sinyavsky and Daniel. As historian Fred Coleman writes, &quot;Historians now have no difficulty pinpointing the birth of the modern Soviet dissident movement. It began in February 1966 with the trial of Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel, two Russian writers who ridiculed the Communist regime in satires smuggled abroad and published under pen names... Little did they realize at the time that they were starting a movement that would help end Communist rule.&quot;

Sinyavsky was forced to work as a stevedore at the Dubravlag, a labor camp (katorga) of the Gulag system located near Yavas, Mordovian ASSR. Sinyavsky was released early in 1971 as part of an initiative by Yuri Andropov, the Chairman of the KGB and the future General Secretary of the CPSU.

==Later years and death==
In 1973, Sinyavsky was allowed to emigrate to France at the invitation of Claude Frioux, a professor at the University of Paris 8 Vincennes-Saint-Denis specializing in Russia. Sinyavsky became a professor of Russian literature at Sorbonne University, co-founded the Russian-language almanac &quot;Sintaksis&quot; with his wife Maria Rozanova, and actively contributed to Radio Liberty. Sinyavsky and Rozanova&#x27;s son, Iegor Gran, graduated from École Centrale Paris and became a novelist.

On 17 October 1991, Sinyavsky was featured in a report received by &quot;Izvestia&quot; on the review of convictions for several prominent Soviet individuals due to lack of &quot;corpus delicti&quot; in their actions. Sinyavsky, Yuli Daniel, Kārlis Ulmanis, Nikolay Timofeev-Ressovsky were considered for &quot;rehabilitation&quot; only two months before the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

In early 1996, Sinyavsky suffered a heart attack, and later that year was diagnosed with lung cancer with metastases in the brain. Sinyavsky underwent unsuccessful operations and radiotherapy at the Curie Institute. Sinyavsky died in 1997 in Fontenay-aux-Roses, near Paris, and was buried there by the Russian Orthodox priest and writer Vladimir Vigilyansky with Andrei Voznesensky in attendance.
Sinyavsky was the catalyst for the formation of the Russian-English translation team of Larissa Volokhonsky and Richard Pevear, who have translated a number of works by Mikhail Bulgakov, Anton Chekhov, Fyodor Dostoyevski, Nikolai Gogol, and Leo Tolstoy. Volokhonsky, who was born and raised in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), first visited the United States in the early 1970s and happened across Pevear&#x27;s &quot;Hudson Review&quot; article about Sinyavsky. At the time, Pevear believed Sinyavsky was still in a Russian prison; Volokhonsky had just helped him immigrate to Paris. Pevear was surprised and pleased to be mistaken: &quot;Larissa had just helped Sinyavsky leave Russia,&quot; Pevear recalled. &quot;And she let me know that, while I&#x27;d said he was still in prison, he was actually in Paris. I was glad to know it.&quot;

==Bibliography==
;Books
* &quot;On Socialist Realism&quot; (1959) criticised the poor quality of the drearily positive-toned, conflict-free structures in the style of the state-backed socialist realism, and called for a return to the fantastic in Soviet literature, the tradition, Sinyavsky said, of Gogol and Vladimir Mayakovsky. This work also drew connections between socialist realism and classicism. It asserted that greater similarities exist between Soviet literature and that predating the 19th century than exist between Soviet (socialist realist) literature and the intellectual skepticism plaguing the protagonists of 19th-century Russian novels.
* &quot;The Trial Begins&quot; (1960) is a short novel with characters reacting in different ways to their roles in a totalitarian society, told with elements of the fantastic.
* &quot;The Makepeace Experiment&quot; (1963) is an allegorical novel of Russia where a leader uses non-rational powers to rule.
* &quot;Fantastic Stories&quot; (1963) is a collection of short stories, such as &quot;The Icicle&quot;. The stories are mostly culled from the 1950s and 1960s and are written in the fantastic tradition of Gogol, E. T. A. Hoffmann, and Yevgeny Zamyatin.
* &quot;A Voice from the Chorus&quot; (1973) is a collection of scattered thoughts from the Gulag, composed in letters he wrote to his wife. It contains snippets of literary thoughts as well as the comments and conversations of fellow prisoners, most of them criminals or even German war prisoners.

<doc id="866081" wikidata="Q647138" url="?curid=866081" title="Visayan hornbill">
<text>The Visayan hornbill (Penelopides panini) is a hornbill found in tropical moist lowland forests of the Philippines in the Western Visayas region which includes the islands of Panay, Negros and formerly as well as the island of Masbate, and formerly Ticao, in the Philippines. As is the case with all five Philippine tarictic hornbills, formerly considered to be just one species.It is declining due to habitat destruction, hunting and the illegal wildlife trade.

It is illegal to hunt, capture or possess these birds under Philippine Law RA 9147.

== Description ==

The adults show sexual dimorphism. The male has a creamy-white head and neck, a white upper chest, a reddish-brown lower chest and uppertail-coverts, and a creamy-white buff tail with a broad black tip. The bill and casque are blackish; the former with yellowish ridges. The bare ocular skin is pinkish-white. The tail and bill of the female resemble that of the male, but otherwise the plumage of the female is black, and the ocular skin is blue.

Visayan hornbills live in groups and frequent the canopy of rainforests. These birds are noisy and emit an incessant sound that sounds like &quot;ta-rik-tik&quot;, hence the name. Despite their noise they are difficult to find, being well camouflaged by the dense foliage.

Diet is presumed to be similar to other hornbills namely fruit,seeds, insects and small mammals and reptiles.

==Taxonomy==
The Visayan hornbill was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot;. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot; which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Buceros panini&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. The type locality is the island of Panay in the Philippines. The Visayan hornbill is now placed in the genus &quot;Penelopides&quot; that was introduced in 1849 by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in a plate of the hornbills. The origin of the generic name is uncertain but it may be a combination of the Latin &quot;pene&quot; meaning &quot;almost&quot; or &quot;nearly&quot;, the Ancient Greek &quot;lophos&quot; meaning &quot;crest&quot; and &quot;-oideēs&quot; &quot;resembling&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;panini&quot; is a Latinized form of &quot;Panay&quot;. The common English name refers to the Visayan Islands. These are located in the central part of the Philippines and include the island of Panay.

Formerly was once a single species with the Luzon hornbill, Samar hornbill, Mindanao hornbill and Mindoro hornbill. It is differentiated from the others as it has a black tail with a broad white band. Among the tarictics it has the second highest sound frequency and rapidness in its calls after the Samar hornbill.

=== Subspecies ===
Two subspecies are recognized:
* &quot;P. p. panini&quot; – : Visayan tarictic hornbill, nominate, found on Panay, Negros, Masbate and Guimaras
* &quot;P. p. ticaensis&quot; – : Ticao tarictic hornbill, found on Ticao Island (likely extinct)

== Ecology and behavior ==
They are primarily frugivorous eating figs and berries but they are also known to eat insects, lizards and other small animals. Usually seen in pairs but can form flocks of up to 15 birds.

All hornbills are monogamous and mate for life.They are cavity nesters and rely on large dipterocarp trees for breeding. The female seals itself within the tree cavity and the male is in charge of gathering food for its mate and chicks. The male stores food in a gular pouch and regurgitates it to feed its mate and chicks. 

Cooperative breeding, wherein immature birds from previous seasons help out in feeding the female and chick has not been observed with this species so far. Among Philippine hornbills, it has only been recorded with the Rufous hornbill.

Lays eggs in March to April. Clutch size is typically 2 to 3 eggs. No studied on incubation period but based on Luzon hornbill incubation takes 28 to 31 days. The Visayan hornbill fledgeling occurs within 55 to 58 days of hatching.

==Habitat and conservation==

This is a highly endangered species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature assessment from the year 2000 estimates that there are 1,200 individuals remaining in the wild. 

This species&#x27; main threat is habitat loss with wholesale clearance of forest habitats as a result of logging, agricultural conversion and mining activities occurring within the range. Negros Island is one of the most deforested areas in the country due to its sugar industry and logging with most of its forests being totally lost before the 21st century. Forest cover on Negros and Panay is just 3% and 6% respectively and these figures are still declining.

However, there is conflicting data as the Philippine Biodiversity Conservation Foundation has counted 3,584 hornbill just on the island of Negros. More surveys are required to verify these claims. 

The subspecies &quot;ticaensis&quot; was described as &quot;abundant&quot; in 1905, but almost the entire forest on the island was replaced by plantations and settlements in the 20th century. The last time the Ticao tarictic was seen was in 1971, and it is now likely to be extinct. If confirmed, this is the first taxon of hornbill to go extinct in recorded history; many other taxa in the family are now at risk.

It occurs in a few protected areas within Mt. Kanlaon Natural Park and Northern Negros Natural Park; however, protection and enforcement against deforestation is lax. It also occurs in the proposed Central Panay Mountain Range Park which contains the largest block of remaining forest in the Western Visayas, and the tourist destination of Twin Lakes (Mount Talinis). Both sites benefit from conservation funding but are still under threat by deforestation.

==In captivity==
This bird is widely kept in captivity but due to the taxonomic reoragnization of the tarictic hornbill species complex it is unknown if these birds are of pure descent.

This species has just been imported from Panay in the Philippines by Chester Zoo, England. There are two pairs at Chester, and two pairs at Avifauna in the Netherlands, amongst other collections.

In the past, the Los Angeles Zoo has bred this species, but it is not known whether these birds were pure &quot;Penelopides panini panini&quot;, so it may not be the first captive breeding of this species; that title may go to a breeding centre on Panay, where Chester&#x27;s birds came from. The Chester zoo has bred this species.

Talarak Foundation based on Negros has bred multiple pure blooded Visayan hornbills.

<text>Jacob M. Froese (November 28, 1917 – June 14, 2003) was a politician in the Canadian province of Manitoba. He was the province&#x27;s only Social Credit MLA between 1959 and 1973, and was the party&#x27;s leader for most if not all of the period from 1959 to 1977.

The son of Jacob J. Froese and Margaret Enns, Froese was born in Winkler, Manitoba to Jacob J. and Margaret (Enns) Froese. His Father was an Old Colony Mennonite Church bishop from 1936 to 1968. He was educated in the local school system and worked as a farmer, also becoming a leading figure in the Winkler Credit Union Society. He married Mary Peters in 1941, and together they had 10 children. Early in his life, he was a Young Liberal.

Froese was elected to the Manitoba legislature for the riding of Rhineland in a November 1959 by-election, defeating a Progressive Conservative candidate by 91 votes. He was re-elected by 33 votes in the 1962 general election, and by greater margins in elections of 1966 and 1969.

The Social Credit Party of Manitoba was largely moribund in this period, and it never came close to electing a second MLA during Froese&#x27;s time in the legislature. A popular local figure, Froese was for all intents and purposes an independent parliamentarian.

Manitoba politics became increasingly polarized between the New Democratic Party and Progressive Conservative Party during the 1970s. Froese was defeated by Progressive Conservative candidate Arnold Brown in the 1973 election, and finished a poor fourth in a bid for re-election four years later. He ran as a federal Social Credit candidate in Lisgar in the 1974 Canadian election, but finished fourth in this race as well.

In the 1981 provincial election, Froese ran for provincial parliament as a member of the Progressive Party of Manitoba, founded by former NDP cabinet minister Sidney Green. He received only 349 votes, and did not attempt any further political comebacks.

Froese died at home in Winkler in 2003. His funeral was held at the Winkler Mennonite Brethren Church, of which he had long been a member.

<text>Link Access Procedure, Balanced (LAPB) implements the data link layer as defined in the X.25 protocol suite. LAPB is a bit-oriented protocol derived from HDLC that ensures that frames are error free and in the correct sequence. LAPB is specified in ITU-T Recommendation X.25 and ISO/IEC 7776. It implements the connection-mode data link service in the OSI Reference Model as defined by ITU-T Recommendation X.222.

LAPB is used to manage communication and packet framing between data terminal equipment (DTE) and the data circuit-terminating equipment (DCE) devices in the X.25 protocol stack. LAPB is essentially HDLC in Asynchronous Balanced Mode (ABM). LAPB sessions can be established by either the DTE or DCE. The station initiating the call is determined to be the primary, and the responding station is the secondary.

==Protocol structure==
===Frame types===
*I-Frames (Information frames): Carries upper-layer information and some control information. I-frame functions include sequencing, flow control, and error detection and recovery. I-frames carry send and receive sequence numbers.
*S-Frames (Supervisory Frames): Carries control information. S-frame functions include requesting and suspending transmissions, reporting on status, and acknowledging the receipt of I-frames. S-frames carry only receive sequence numbers.
*U-Frames (Unnumbered Frames): carries control information. U-frame functions include link setup and disconnection, as well as error reporting. U-frames carry no sequence numbers

===Frame format===
Flag – The value of the flag is always 0x7E. In order to ensure that the bit pattern of the frame delimiter flag does not appear in the data field of the frame (and therefore cause frame misalignment), a technique known as Bit stuffing is used by both the transmitter and the receiver.

Address field – In LAPB, this field has no meaning since the protocol works in a point to point mode and the DTE network address is represented in the layer 3 packets. This byte is therefore put to a different use; it separates the link commands from the responses and can have only two values: 0x01 and 0x03. 01 identifies frames containing commands from DTE to DCE and responses to these commands from DCE to DTE. 03 is used for frames containing commands from DCE to DTE and for responses from DTE to DCE. Therefore, one side must be configured as a Layer 2 DTE and the other as a Layer 2 DCE (you must not confuse this with the more familiar Layer 1 DCE and DTE designations).

Control field – it serves to identify the type of the frame. In addition, it includes sequence numbers, control features and error tracking according to the frame type.

Modes of operation – LAPB works in the Asynchronous Balanced Mode (ABM). This mode is balanced (i.e., no master/slave relationship) and is signified by the SABM(E)/SM frame. Each station may initialize, supervise, recover from errors, and send frames at any time. The DTE and DCE are treated as equals.

FCS – The Frame Check Sequence enables a high level of physical error control by allowing the integrity of the transmitted frame data to be checked.

Window size – LAPB supports an extended window size (modulo 128 and modulo 32768) where the maximum number of outstanding frames for acknowledgment is raised from 7 (modulo 8) to 127 (modulo 128) and 32767 (modulo 32768).

===Protocol operation===
LAPB has no master/slave node relationships. The sender uses the Poll bit in command frames to insist on an immediate response. In the response frame this same bit becomes the receivers Final bit. The receiver always turns on the Final bit in its response to a command from the sender with the Poll bit set. The P/F bit is generally used when either end becomes unsure about proper frame sequencing because of a possible missing acknowledgment, and it is necessary to re-establish a point of reference. It is also used to trigger an acknowledgment of outstanding I-frames.

==Node addressing==
The following table shows which addresses are placed into the LAPB frame when issuing commands and responses from DTE to DCE and DCE to DTE using single link operation or multilink operation:

<text>In software, a data access object (DAO) is a pattern that provides an abstract interface to some type of database or other persistence mechanism. By mapping application calls to the persistence layer, the DAO provides data operations without exposing database details. This isolation supports the single responsibility principle. It separates the data access the application needs, in terms of domain-specific objects and data types (the DAO&#x27;s public interface), from how these needs can be satisfied with a specific DBMS (the implementation of the DAO).

Although this design pattern is applicable to most programming languages, most software with persistence needs, and most databases, it is traditionally associated with Java EE applications and with relational databases (accessed via the JDBC API because of its origin in Sun Microsystems&#x27; best practice guidelines &quot;Core J2EE Patterns&quot;.

This object can be found in the Data Access layer of the 3-Tier Architecture.

There are various ways in which this object can be implemented:
* One DAO for each table.
* One DAO for all the tables for a particular DBMS.
* Where the SELECT query is limited only to its target table and cannot incorporate JOINS, UNIONS, subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
* Where the SELECT query can contain anything that the DBMS allows.

== Advantages ==

Using data access objects (DAOs) offers a clear advantage: it separates two parts of an application that don&#x27;t need to know about each other. This separation allows them to evolve independently. If business logic changes, it can rely on a consistent DAO interface. Meanwhile, modifications to persistence logic won&#x27;t affect DAO clients.

All details of storage are hidden from the rest of the application (see information hiding). Unit testing code is facilitated by substituting a test double for the DAO in the test, thereby making the tests independent of the persistence layer.

In the context of the Java programming language, DAO can be implemented in various ways. This can range from a fairly simple interface that separates data access from the application logic, to frameworks and commercial products.

Technologies like Java Persistence API and Enterprise JavaBeans come built into application servers and can be used in applications that use a Java EE application server. Commercial products such as TopLink are available based on object–relational mapping (ORM). Popular open source ORM software includes Doctrine, Hibernate, iBATIS and JPA implementations such as Apache OpenJPA.

== Disadvantages ==
Potential disadvantages of using DAO include leaky abstraction, code duplication, and abstraction inversion. In particular, the abstraction of the DAO as a regular Java object can obscure the high cost of each database access. Developers may inadvertently make multiple database queries to retrieve information that could be returned in a single operation. If an application requires multiple DAOs, the same create, read, update, and delete code may have to be written for each DAO.

Note that these disadvantages only appear when you have a separate DAO for each table and the SELECT query is prevented from accessing anything other than the target table.

* ORMLite: Lightweight object–relational mapping (ORM) framework in Java for JDBC and Android

<text>In materials science, a porous medium or a porous material is a material containing pores (voids). The skeletal portion of the material is often called the &quot;matrix&quot; or &quot;frame&quot;. The pores are typically filled with a fluid (liquid or gas). The skeletal material is usually a solid, but structures like foams are often also usefully analyzed using concept of porous media.

A porous medium is most often characterised by its porosity. Other properties of the medium (e.g. permeability, tensile strength, electrical conductivity, tortuosity) can sometimes be derived from the respective properties of its constituents (solid matrix and fluid) and the media porosity and pores structure, but such a derivation is usually complex. Even the concept of porosity is only straightforward for a poroelastic medium.

Often both the solid matrix and the pore network (also known as the pore space) are continuous, so as to form two interpenetrating continua such as in a sponge. However, there is also a concept of closed porosity and effective porosity, i.e. the pore space accessible to flow.

Many natural substances such as rocks and soil (e.g. aquifers, petroleum reservoirs), zeolites, biological tissues (e.g. bones, wood, cork), and man made materials such as cements and ceramics can be considered as porous media. Many of their important properties can only be rationalized by considering them to be porous media.

The concept of porous media is used in many areas of applied science and engineering: filtration, mechanics (acoustics, geomechanics, soil mechanics, rock mechanics), engineering (petroleum engineering, bioremediation, construction engineering), geosciences (hydrogeology, petroleum geology, geophysics), biology and biophysics, material science. Two important current fields of application for porous materials are energy conversion and energy storage, where porous materials are essential for superpacitors, (photo-)catalysis, fuel cells, and batteries.

==Scale==
At the microscopic and macroscopic levels, porous media can be classified. 
At the microscopic scale, the structure is represented statistically by the distribution of pore sizes, the degree of pore interconnection and orientation, the proportion of dead pores, etc. 
The macroscopic technique makes use of bulk properties that have been averaged at scales far bigger than pore size.

Depending on the goal, these two techniques are frequently employed since they are complimentary. It is obvious that the microscopic description is required to comprehend surface phenomena like the adsorption of macromolecules from polymer solutions and the blocking of pores, whereas the macroscopic approach is frequently quite sufficient for process design where fluid flow, heat, and mass transfer are of highest concern. and the molecular dimensions are significantly smaller than pore size of the porous system.

==Fluid flow==
Fluid flow through porous media is a subject of common interest and has emerged a separate field of study. The study of more general behaviour of porous media involving deformation of the solid frame is called poromechanics.

The theory of porous flows has applications in inkjet printing and nuclear waste disposal technologies, among others.

Numerous factors influence fluid flow in porous media, and its fundamental function is to expend energy and create fluid via the wellbore. In flow mechanics via porous medium, the connection between energy and flow rate becomes the most significant issue. The most fundamental law that characterizes this connection is Darcy&#x27;s law, particularly applicable to fine-porous media. In contrast, Forchheimer&#x27;s law finds utility in the context of coarse-porous media.

== Models ==
A representation of the void phase that exists inside porous materials using a set or network of pores. It serves as a structural foundation for the prediction of transport parameters and is employed in the context of pore structure characterisation.

There are many idealized models of pore structures. They can be broadly divided into three categories:
* networks of capillaries
* arrays of solid particles (e.g., random close pack of spheres)
* trimodal

Porous materials often have a fractal-like structure, having a pore surface area that seems to grow indefinitely when viewed with progressively increasing resolution. Mathematically, this is described by assigning the pore surface a Hausdorff dimension greater than 2. Experimental methods for the investigation of pore structures include confocal microscopy and x-ray tomography.
Porous materials have found some applications in many engineering fields including automotive sectors.

== Laws ==
One of the Laws for porous materials is the generalized Murray&#x27;s law. The generalized Murray&#x27;s law is based on optimizing mass transfer by minimizing transport resistance in pores with a given volume, and can be applicable for optimizing mass transfer involving mass variations and chemical reactions involving flow processes, molecule or ion diffusion.

For connecting a parent pipe with radius of r0 to many children pipes with radius of ri , the formula of generalized Murray&#x27;s law is: formula_1, where the X is the ratio of mass variation during mass transfer in the parent pore, the exponent α is dependent on the type of the transfer. For laminar flow &quot;α&quot; =3; for turbulent flow &quot;α&quot; =7/3; for molecule or ionic diffusion &quot;α&quot; =2; etc.

<text>Peter Karrie (born 10 August 1946, originally Peter Karagianis) is a Welsh singer and an honorary fellow of the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama. He played the lead role in the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; in various productions such as London (1991,1992), Toronto (1992,1994,1997-1998), various locations with the Canadian International Touring Company (1995,1997) and the end of the UK Millennium Tour (2000). In 1994 and 1995 members of the Phantom of the Opera Appreciation Society voted him their favourite Phantom.

Karrie was brought up in Wales, where he had radio and television shows on BBC Wales. He began his career as the lead singer of pop group &quot;Peter and the Wolves&quot;, and went on to star in several West End musical productions, including &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (as Jean Valjean) and &quot;Chess&quot; (as Freddie Trumper). He also played Che in the UK tour of &quot;Evita&quot;, and played Daddy Warbucks in &quot;Annie&quot;, Fagin in &quot;Oliver!&quot; and Tevye in &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; for Aberystwyth Arts Centre, he also has played Judas Iscariot in &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; at the Palace Theatre. In 2005 he starred with Shan Côthi in the Mal Pope musical &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; at the Wales Millennium Centre for the Wales Theatre Company. He performed alongside John Owen Jones and Nic Greenshields in the one-off &quot;Three Phantoms&quot; concert in aid of George Thomas Hospice Care. He also created roles in three Bernard J. Taylor musicals, and the title role of &quot;Nosferatu&quot; was written for him. In 2012 he appeared in the 33rd edition of The Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, where he and Brenna Conrad performed a Cole Porter tribute and a rendition of &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;.

Married with six children, Karrie is an ambassador for Bobath Children&#x27;s Therapy Centre Wales, a registered charity based in Cardiff which provides specialist Bobath therapy to children from Wales who have cerebral palsy.

In 2013 he resigned his honorary fellowship at Aberystwyth University in protest, he said, at its apparent determination to &quot;ruin one of the finest arts centres in the country&quot;, and because he was &quot;unable to support any regime that can treat their staff in such a cruel and appalling manner.&quot;

In conjunction with The Blaenavon Workmen&#x27;s Hall, one of the finest remaining mining institute&#x27;s in South East Wales, Peter has written and will produce and perform in a new Pantomime within the hall&#x27;s 350-seat Theatre in December 2017. Peter&#x27;s version of &quot;Puss in Boots&quot; will feature both professional and local amateur performers selected from his musical theatre drama school – The Blaenavon Academy of Arts.

<text>Blazing Star is a shoot &#x27;em up video game developed by Yumekobo and published by SNK in 1998 for the Neo Geo arcade and home systems. It is a follow-up to &quot;Pulstar&quot; (1995) and features side-scrolling action similar to its predecessor and different ships with varying characteristics. It was made less challenging than its predecessor, and the graphic quality was improved upon.

The game was released to mixed reviews. It was commended for its graphics and boss design, and for keeping the Neo Geo shooter scene alive. It has received greater recognition in retrospective reviews when re-released on smartphones and home consoles through the &quot;ACA Neo Geo&quot; series. Critics continued to praise the boss battles and graphics, but criticized the uneven stage design.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Blazing Star&quot; is a side-scrolling shoot &#x27;em up similar to its predecessor &quot;Pulstar&quot; (1995) and the classic shooter &quot;R-Type&quot; (1987). The story revolves around cyborgs that, remembering their humanity, team up to destroy artificial intelligence systems developing the cybernetic armies they were once a part of.

The player can choose from playing as one of these cyborgs, each piloting a ship equipped with different shot types, power, and speed. Tapping the fire button will unleash a standard shot, or it can be tapped rapidly for a different shot type, or held down for a charge attack. Upon releasing the fire button during a charge, it will unleash a powerful focused shot which can also be dispersed to cover a large area with smaller bullets. The effect and range of these attacks varies depending on the player&#x27;s ship.

Power-ups are littered across each stage that boost the power of the ship&#x27;s weaponry. There are also other items that will increase the player&#x27;s score and count towards their ranking at the end of each stage. Some of these are only revealed if the player eliminates specific waves of enemies. Some of the later stages introduce more stage hazards like narrow passages. Each stage ends with a boss fight which the player must be completed in the allotted time to get bonus points added to their score. If not completed under the time limit, the player is forced to continue to the next stage without collecting additional points.

== Development ==
&quot;Blazing Star&quot; was the first game developed by Yumekobo, a company formerly known as Aicom but rebranded to mark their new direction of working closely with SNK. Initial discussions began with the concept for a follow-up to their shooter &quot;Pulstar&quot;, however they wanted their new game to maintain a degree of independence from the original. With significant changes made to the gameplay style and setting, the team treated their new game as a gaiden and did not want to use &quot;Pulstar&quot; in the title. Yumekobo&#x27;s president at the time opposed this, wanting &quot;Pulstar&quot; in the title for business reasons. At some point the game was titled &quot;Pulstar Blast&quot;. The publisher SNK entered the dispute, saying they did not want Yumekobo&#x27;s new shooter to be associated to &quot;Pulstar&quot; in the west because it received poor reception there due to its high difficulty. The team settled on the title &quot;Blazing Star&quot; for its western release, chosen among others including &quot;Zero Hour&quot; and &quot;The Zenith&quot;. Not wanting to keep the names different between regions, Yumekobo&#x27;s president decided to make &quot;Blazing Star&quot; the title in all regions.

The team had trouble designing the attack patterns and enemy placements to establish the right level of difficulty. Interesting combat patterns made the game more difficult, but the game was boring otherwise. The director of &quot;Pulstar&quot; thought the original game was too difficult and wanted the new shooter to have a charge shot for an easier challenge. Although much of the game changed through development, the charge shot was one of the early concepts that was kept along with the goal to create impressive scenery. Yumekobo staff believed the game&#x27;s best selling point was its detailed graphics. The artists had to overcome challenges creating the textures, animation, and reducing the sprites to 16 colors each due to Neo Geo hardware limitations. The system&#x27;s sprite limit restricted the number of bullets they could place on-screen. There was still some sprite flickering in the final game due to crossing this threshold.

The character Leefa has a kogal personality and was modeled after Yuko Asahina from &quot;Tokimeki Memorial&quot; at the request of the game designers. JB was modeled after the actor Jean Reno, and Asayuki was based on a character for a previous game the character designer worked on that was never released. Unique endings were planned for each character but were later cut, the details of which were divulged in an issue of &quot;Neo Geo Freak&quot;.

== Release ==
&quot;Blazing Star&quot; was released on the Neo Geo arcade system (MVS) in 1998, and the home system (AES) on February 26, 1998. A Neo Geo CD release was planned but abandoned.

The game was re-released on iOS and Android in July 2012, and on the Wii via the Virtual Console in Japan on August 21 later that year. The smartphone versions include multiplayer support via Bluetooth and a practice mode that lets the player start from any stage they have cleared. Hamster Corporation rereleased the game for the Nintendo Switch via the eShop on May 2, 2017 as part of their &quot;ACA Neo Geo&quot; series. As with all games released under the &quot;ACA Neo Geo&quot; brand, the game includes Hamster&#x27;s additional scoring modes, screen filter options, and difficulty settings. This version later came to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One digital storefronts on February 8, 2018. &quot;Blazing Star&quot; is also included in SNK&#x27;s Neo Geo Mini dedicated console.

A port developed by DotEmu for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux and asm.js was released by SNK Playmore as part of the Humble NEOGEO 25th Anniversary Bundle on December 15, 2015. It was also released on GOG.com on May 30, 2017.

== Reception ==
Critics commended &quot;Blazing Star&quot; as a testament to SNK&#x27;s devotion to the Neo Geo hardware and keeping classic genres such as shoot &#x27;em ups alive. &quot;Edge&quot; wrote that side-scrolling shooters were rare to find, but the game should satisfy fans of the genre. They praised the colorful backgrounds and 3D special effects. &quot;Video Games&quot; agreed that the graphics were nice, but felt some of the backgrounds were pale and it ultimately did not offer &quot;The Ultimate in Neo Geo graphics&quot; as was advertised on the game&#x27;s packaging. &quot;Next Level&quot; argued that the game took better advantage of the Neo Geo hardware than &quot;Pulstar&quot; with its improved background and lighting effects. Journalists found the game similar to its predecessor, but &quot;Video Games&quot; in particular thought &quot;Pulstar&quot; was the better game. They gave &quot;Blazing Star&quot; a score of 72% and felt it was too short, not challenging enough, and lacking in sophisticated level design. They did however like the bosses, as did &quot;Next Level&quot; and &quot;Edge&quot; who both appreciated the game for carrying on the large boss trend from &quot;Pulstar&quot;. &quot;Edge&quot; ultimately felt that the &quot;frenetic, old-school gameplay...will keep the Neo Geo&#x27;s devotees happy.&quot; In 2014, &quot;HobbyConsolas&quot; identified it as one of the twenty best games for the Neo Geo AES. 

The iOS and Android ports of &quot;Blazing Star&quot; were well-received. &quot;TouchArcade&quot; commended the strategic gameplay, impressive 2D backgrounds, and felt it featured &quot;some of the most intricate shooter gameplay you can find in the vast pool of shmups available on the App Store.&quot; Their biggest criticisms were the touch screen controls which they felt were sluggish. &quot;Pocket Gamer&quot; agreed about the controls, writing that their finger would get in the way of action occasionally. They still thought the game was addictive and &quot;the equivalent of the machine in the corner that the hardened veterans congregate around, dropping in coin after coin as they inch their way up the leaderboards.&quot;

Reviewing the &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; release, &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; called it a &quot;perfect port&quot;, noting that it even retained the frame rate slowdown when the screen is filled with sprites. Their biggest complaints were the game&#x27;s aged pre-rendered graphics and the sharp difficulty increase in the latter stages, but they felt these were minor issues. They felt Hamster Corporation&#x27;s Hi-Score and Caravan modes were perfect complements to &quot;Blazing Star&quot;. &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; felt that it had an uneven level design, wishing the earlier levels had more stage hazards. They did however appreciate the game for maintaining a degree of simplicity without sacrificing gameplay depth, and called it &quot;one of the more accessible and fun shoot-em-ups out there&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Retro Gamer&quot; and &quot;Harcore Gaming 101&quot; wrote that the game is sometimes remembered for its poorly-translated English text. Some articles, including one by linguist Ben Zimmer, have cited the game&#x27;s game over message, “You fail it&quot;, as inspiring the popular interjection &quot;Fail&quot;.

<text>Edward Reynolds Price (February 1, 1933 – January 20, 2011) was an American poet, novelist, dramatist, essayist and James B. Duke Professor of English at Duke University. Apart from English literature, Price had a lifelong interest in Biblical scholarship. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

==Biography==

Price was born Edward Reynolds Price in Macon, North Carolina, on February 1, 1933, the first of two sons of William Solomon and Elizabeth Price. Both he and his mother narrowly survived an extremely taxing childbirth; family legend states that during these circumstances, Will Price prayed and made a promise to God that if his wife and son survived, he would quit drinking alcohol. Price&#x27;s family, struggling under the economic climate of the Great Depression, resided in the rural North Carolina towns of Macon, Henderson, Warrenton, Roxboro, and Asheboro throughout his childhood. Rather than joining other boys his age in sports and outdoor activities, Price developed a childhood fondness for the arts – reading, writing, painting, and opera included. He attended Broughton High School in Raleigh, North Carolina and eventually received a full scholarship to Duke University, where he continued writing, served as the editor of Duke&#x27;s literary magazine, The Archive, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa his junior year and graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot;. After graduating in 1955, Price received a Rhodes Scholarship and attended Merton College, Oxford. While at Oxford, Price formed important friendships with the poet W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender, Sir Neville Coghill and the biographer Lord David Cecil. He devoted a significant portion of his literary studies, as well as his thesis, to English poet John Milton. Upon graduation with a B.Litt. in 1958, Price secured a position in the Duke University English department, where he stayed for the rest of his career, often teaching courses on Milton, creative writing, and the Gospels.
Price made no secret from his close friends and colleagues that he was gay, but he was not open about the fact until the gay rights movement was in full swing and friends began to die of AIDS. He preferred to say he was &quot;queer&quot; in lieu of gay.

In the spring of 1984, a life-altering medical event occurred when Price reported difficulty walking and underwent testing at Duke University Hospital. James Schiff describes, &quot;He soon learned of a &#x27;pencil-thick and gray-colored&#x27; tumor, ten inches long and cancerous, which was &#x27;intricately braided in the core of [his] spinal cord&#x27;.&quot; Although surgery and radiation managed to remove the tumor from his spine, Price became a paraplegic and required a wheelchair for the rest of his life. After enduring these initial years, Price emerged from this trying period &quot;a more patient and watchful person and a dramatically more prolific writer.&quot; He still bore, however, &quot;colossal, incessant pain&quot;, as he described. He wrote about his experience as a cancer survivor in his memoir &quot;A Whole New Life.&quot; Regarding his life after this tragedy, Price explains, &quot;I&#x27;d have to say that, despite an enjoyable fifty-year start, these recent years since full catastrophe have gone still better. They&#x27;ve brought more in and sent more out – more love and care, more knowledge and patience, more work in less time.&quot;

In 1987, Duke University gave Price its highest honor when it awarded him the University Medal for Distinguished Meritorious Service.

Price died at the age of 77 on January 20, 2011, as a result of complications from a heart attack. The third volume of his three volumes of autobiography, Midstream, (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2012) was completed by his long time friend Wallace Kaufman using his journals and a large archive of Price&#x27;s letters.

==Career==

Over his career, Price produced 38 total novels, short stories, and memoirs. Price is classified as a Southern writer, as his works are often especially associated with his lifelong home of North Carolina. Price&#x27;s first ever published story, called &quot;A Chain of Love&quot;, came in 1958. He wrote his first novel, &quot;A Long and Happy Life&quot;, and witnessed its publication in 1962. The work received the William Faulkner Foundation Award (1963) and has sold over a million copies. His 1986 novel &quot;Kate Vaiden&quot; also gained immense popularity and received the National Books Critics Circle Award. Price composed a memoir entitled &quot;Clear Pictures&quot; in 1989 which directly led to the production of a Charles Guggenheim documentary about the author&#x27;s lifetime. He completed another memoir called &quot;A Whole New Life&quot; in 1994 which chronicled his journey after the discovery of cancer in his spine. &quot;The Collected Poems&quot;, containing four volumes of poetry – &quot;Vital Provisions&quot; (1982), &quot;The Laws of Ice&quot; (1986), &quot;The Use of Fire&quot; (1990), and &quot;The Unaccountable Worth of the World&quot; (1997) – was published in 1997.

Price entered the realm of pop culture with the release and Top-40 status of James Taylor&#x27;s song &quot;Copperline,&quot; which he and Taylor wrote together. Bill Clinton characterized Price as one of his favorite authors.
On the cover of the December 6, 1999 issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Price&#x27;s name appeared. Victor Strandberg explains, &quot;Price&#x27;s name was next to a Renaissance portrait of Jesus alongside a headline that reads, &#x27;Novelist Reynolds Price offers a new Gospel based on archeology and the Bible.&#x27; Inside the magazine, this cover story begins with &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s statement that &#x27;A great novelist and biblical scholar examines what faith and historical research tell us after 2,000 years and emerges with his own apocryphal Gospel&#x27;.&quot;

==Personal life==

Price lived alone, by choice, for all of his adult life and was openly homosexual. In 1957 he had an affair with the famous British poet Stephen Spender, visiting the Spender family home for Christmas.

Shortly after dawn on July 3, 1984, in the midst of treatment for his tumor, Price awoke in his bed and claimed to have had a life-changing mystic experience and vision in which he came in contact with Jesus Christ at the Sea of Galilee. Price gives an account of this occurrence in &quot;A Whole New Life&quot;:

It was the big lake of Kinnereth, the Sea of Galilee, in the north of Israel ... the scene of Jesus&#x27; first teaching and healing. I&#x27;d paid the lake a second visit the previous October. ... Still sleeping around me on the misty ground were a number of men in the tunics and cloaks of first-century Palestine. I soon understood with no sense of surprise that the men were Jesus&#x27; twelve disciples and that he was nearby asleep among them. ... Then one of the sleeping men woke and stood. I saw it was Jesus, bound toward me. ... Again I felt no shock or fear. All this was normal human event; it was utterly clear to my normal eyes and was happening as surely as any event of my previous life. ... Jesus bent and silently beckoned me to follow. ... Jesus silently took up handfuls of water and poured them over my head and back til water ran down my puckered scar. Then he spoke once—&quot;Your sins are forgiven&quot;—and turned to shore again, done with me. I came on behind him, thinking in standard greedy fashion, &quot;It&#x27;s not my sins I&#x27;m worried about&quot;. So to Jesus&#x27; receding back, I had the gall to say &quot;Am I also cured?&quot; He turned to face me, no sign of a smile, and finally said two words—&quot;That too.&quot;

==Reception==

Despite the success of his best-selling novels and nationwide recognition on the cover of &quot;Time&quot;, Price has received a lesser degree of recognition than many of his contemporaries in American literature. James Schiff explains, &quot;Despite the praise from reviewers, Price has not received a great deal of scholarly attention – certainly less than other members of his literary generation, such as John Updike, Philip Roth, Thomas Pynchon, Joyce Carol Oates, Toni Morrison, John Barth, Sylvia Plath, Susan Sontag, Don DeLillo, and Cynthia Ozick.&quot; But although he is less well-known than such writers, Price is widely celebrated by the literary community and the majority of his readers.

<text>The Civic United Front (CUF; , ) is a liberal party in Tanzania. Although nationally based, most of the CUF&#x27;s support comes from the Zanzibar islands of Unguja and Pemba. The party is a member of Liberal International.

==History==
The Civic United Front was formed on 28 May 1992 through a merger of two formerly existing movements: KAMAHURU, a pressure group for democratization in Zanzibar, and the Civic Movement, a human rights organization based on the mainland.

Many CUF leaders were former stalwarts of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), some of whom had been expelled over disputes about party and government policy. The party received full recognition on 21 January 1993.

==Leadership==
* Ibrahim Lipumba, National Chairman
* Abass Juma Muhunzi, Vice Chairman 
* Magdalena Sakaya, Deputy Secretary General (Tanzania mainland)

==Electoral performance==

The Civic United Front participated in the 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015 elections.

In the 1995 presidential election, CUF candidate Ibrahim Lipumba placed third (behind Benjamin Mkapa of the CCM and NCCR-Mageuzi candidate Augustine Mrema) winning 6.43% of the vote. In the National Assembly, the party won 24 of 232 elective seats, making it the largest opposition party in the legislature. Seif Shariff Hamad won 49.76% of the vote against 50.24% for the ruling party&#x27;s Salmin Amour in elections for the presidency of Zanzibar. The CUF also obtained 24 of 50 elective seats in the Zanzibar House of Representatives. International and domestic observers heavily criticized the conduct of the Zanzibar polls.

Following the election, the CUF boycotted the House of Representatives and refused to recognize the Zanzibari government as legitimate. In November 1997, eighteen leaders of the CUF were arrested and subsequently charged with treason. These charges were later dropped.

In the 29 October 2000 presidential election, Lipumba placed second to Mkapa, winning 16.26% of the vote. The party maintained its status as the largest opposition party in the National Assembly by winning 17 of 231 elective seats. Seif Shariff Hamad won 32.96% of the vote against 67.04% for the ruling party&#x27;s Amani Abeid Karume in elections for the presidency of Zanzibar. The CUF won 16 of 50 elective seats in the Zanzibar House of Representatives. The elections were considered largely free and fair on the mainland, but observers noted serious irregularities in the Zanzibar polls, with some calling for a complete re-run of the polls. When the electoral commission nullified the results in only 16 constituencies, the CUF announced that it would boycott the new elections conducted on 5 November 2000.
Elections for the Zanzibar Presidency and House of Representatives took place on 30 October 2005. Seif Shariff Hamad placed second to incumbent Amani Abeid Karume, winning 46.07% of the vote. The party won 19 seats in the House of Representatives.

National elections were held on 14 December 2005. Ibrahim Lipumba placed a distant second to CCM candidate Jakaya Kikwete, winning 11.68% of the vote. Out of the 232 National Assembly seats filled through direct election, the CUF won 19.

<doc id="866140" wikidata="Q1186248" url="?curid=866140" title="Democrat Party (Thailand)">
<text>The Democrat Party (; ) is a Thai political party. The oldest party in Thailand, it was founded as a royalist party; it now upholds a conservative and pro-market position.

The Democrat Party made its best showings in parliament in 1948, 1976, and 1996. It has never won an outright parliamentary majority. The party&#x27;s electoral support bases are southern Thailand and Bangkok, although the party’s strength in Bangkok has declined rapidly since the 2019 general election. Since 2004, Democrat candidates won three elections for the governorship of Bangkok. From 2005 to 2019, the Democrat Party was led by Abhisit Vejjajiva, former prime minister.

== Names ==
The Thai name of the party, &quot;Prachathipat&quot; (ประชาธิปัตย์), is derived from the word &quot;prachathipatai&quot; (ประชาธิปไตย) which means &#x27;democracy&#x27;, &#x27;democratic&#x27; or &#x27;democrat&#x27;. The party said it wanted the term to mean the people in whom democracy is vested.

==History==
===Party founding===
The Democrat Party was founded by Khuang Aphaiwong on 5 April 1946, but the party considers 6 April as the party&#x27;s founding day, to coincide with Chakri Memorial Day, as a conservative and royalist party, following the January 1946 elections. Early members included royalists opposed to Pridi Phanomyong and former Seri Thai underground resistance members. The party competed against the parties affiliated with Pridi Phanomyong and the Progressive Party of brothers Seni and Kukrit Pramoj. In the January 1946 elections, the Pridi-led coalition had won a majority in parliament. However, Pridi declined the nomination as prime minister and the parliament appointed Khuang as premier. Khuang resigned in March 1946, after being defeated on a bill, and was replaced by Pridi. The smaller Progress Party later merged with the Democrat Party.

===Accusation against Pridi Phanomyong===
After the death of King Ananda Mahidol in 1946, the Democrat Party accused Pridi of having been the mastermind behind the king&#x27;s death and spread this propaganda throughout the capital. Seni Pramoj&#x27;s wife told the US chargé d&#x27;affaires that Pridi had the king assassinated, and Democrat Party members spread the same rumor to the British Embassy. A few days after the king&#x27;s death, a Democrat MP yelled out, &quot;Pridi killed the King!&quot; in the middle of a crowded theater.

===November 1947 coup and the 1949 Constitution===

By the time of the elections of August 1946, the Democrat Party was backed by royalists like Prince Upalisarn Jubala, Srivisarn Vacha, Sridhamadibes, Borirak Vejjakarn, and Srisena Sombatsiri. Except for Prince Upalisarn Jubala, all of these figures would become Privy Councilors to King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Parties affiliated with Pridi continued to win a majority of seats in parliament. Pridi was appointed premier, but later conceded to Luang Thamrong Navasavat. A military coup led by Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram later overthrew the Thamrong government.

The palace persuaded Marshal Plaek to appoint Khuang Aphaiwong as figurehead civilian prime minister. In subsequent elections on 29 January 1948, the Democrats won a majority for the first time, and reappointed Khuang as premier. Khuang packed his cabinet with palace allies, much to the consternation of the military. The military later, claiming that they were supporters of constitutional monarchy, demanded that Khuang resign. Marshal Plaek replaced Khuang as prime minister.

Although having no representatives in the cabinet, the Democrats had key representatives in the constitution drafting committee. Headed by Seni Pramoj and dominated by royalists under the direction of Prince Rangsit and Prince Dhani, the 1949 Constitution elevated the throne to its most powerful position since the 1932 overthrow of the absolute monarchy. Among its features was a senate whose members were to be appointed directly by the king. The constitution triggered protests among much of the public. It was attacked as contrary to the purpose of the 1932 revolution. Critics were branded republicans and communists.

Subsequent elections saw military-backed parties winning the majority in the House; however the Senate was still dominated by Democrats and other royalists. As Marshal Plaek was still premier, tensions between the military and the Democrat/palace-alliance steadily increased. On 29 November 1951, the military and the police seized power, just as King Bhumibol&#x27;s ship was returning to Thai waters. Although the military&#x27;s 1952 constitution, which was similar to the 1932 Constitution, called for elections, the Democrats had been practically barred from government for the following 23 years for their anti-military stance, denying them chances to serve the people.

===Sarit Dhanarajata&#x27;s government===
Sarit Dhanarajata seized power from Marshal Plaek in 1957. Unlike Marshal Plaek, Sarit deified the throne, thus removing any advantage that the Democrats, who had previously been dominated by royalists, may have had. The junta did not immediately abrogate the 1952 constitution, but instead appointed Pote Sarasin as figurehead civilian premier. Elections were held on 15 December 1957, resulting in the Democrats losing to military-backed parties. Sarit&#x27;s ally, General Thanom Kittikachorn, was appointed premier. Sarit later went to the US to seek treatment for liver cirrhosis. Eight months later, he recovered, returned and led another coup while dissolving parliament, abrogating the constitution, and ruling by revolutionary council. For the next nine years, there were no elections in Thailand, and the Democrat Party was dormant.

===Thanom Kittikachorn&#x27;s rule through military power===
Thanom Kittikachorn, who had succeeded Sarit after his death, was pressured to promulgate a democratic constitution on 20 June 1968, and hold elections in February 1969. Parties affiliated with Thanom won the election, and the Democrats joined the opposition due to their anti-dictatorship stance. Thanom, his son Narong, and his brother-in-law Praphas Charusathien became known as the &quot;three tyrants&quot;. They later executed a coup against their own government on 17 November 1971, abrogating the constitution and running the kingdom through a National Executive Council. Beginning in 1972, popular demands for democratic freedoms began to grow. In response to the demands, the National Executive Council drafted a new charter in December 1972, which established a wholly appointed 299-member National Legislative Assembly.

===Shift to an unstable civilian government===
Opposition to the three tyrants culminated on 14 October 1973, when 400,000 persons protested at the Democracy Monument. A violent crackdown and subsequent intervention by the king led to the appointment of Privy Councilor Sanya Dhammasakdi as premier. The three tyrants left the kingdom. Sanya established a constitution drafting committee, consisting of Kukrit Pramoj (who by this time had established and defected to the Social Action Party) and many academics. The new constitution was promulgated on 7 October 1974.

Legislative elections were held in January 1975, resulting in none of the 22 parties coming close to winning a majority. The Democrats, led by Seni Pramoj, formed a coalition government in February 1974. Seni was appointed premier, but the coalition was unstable, and was replaced in less than a month by a Social Action Party-led coalition which appointed Social Action Party leader Kukrit Pramoj as premier.

===Seni Pramoj and the 6 October 1976 massacre===
The kingdom descended into political chaos, with anti-leftist groups growing increasingly violent. In January 1976, the military pressured Kukrit to dissolve parliament. Elections were scheduled on 14 April. The months leading up to the election were particularly eventful: The head of the Socialist Party was assassinated, the Red Gaur attempted to bomb the headquarters of the New Force Party (a leftist party), and the Chart Thai Party was established with the slogan &quot;Right Kills Left&quot;. Seni Pramoj&#x27;s Democrats won the most seats in the election, and formed an unstable coalition government.

Seni&#x27;s government came under great pressure. A bill to extend elections to local levels was passed by parliament 149-19, but the king refused to sign the bill or return it to parliament, effectively vetoing it. As anti-leftist sentiments mounted, Praphas Charusathien returned shortly from exile and met the king. Students protesting Praphas&#x27; return were attacked by Red Gaur paramilitary units. On 19 September 1976, Thanom also returned from exile and was immediately ordained as a monk at Wat Bovornives. Massive protests erupted. The king and queen returned from a trip to the south and visited monk Thanom, leading Seni to resign from the premiership in protest. His resignation was refused by parliament, but initial attempts to reshuffle his cabinet were vetoed by the king. The political tension finally culminated in the 6 October 1976 massacre, when Village Scouts and Red Gaur joined with some military and police to massacre at least 46 students protesting at Thammasat University. That evening, the military seized power and installed hard-line royalist Tanin Kraivixien as premier.

The military coup to restore order was endorsed by the king, who declared it was &quot;a manifestation of what the people clearly wanted.&quot; The new constitution did not express any obligation for the government to have a cabinet or elections, and gave the premier near-absolute powers.

===The Democrat Party in the 1990s===
The Democrat Party, being led by Bhichai Rattakul, became an outspoken opponent of military rule in Thai politics during the 1990s. The Democrat Party was the key member of the &quot;People Power&quot; movement in 1992.

====Chuan Leekpai====
The party&#x27;s voter base is traditionally concentrated in southern Thailand and in Bangkok, where the party relies on the support from the capital&#x27;s aristocratic, meritocratic, and educated middle and upper classes. In the 1990s, under the leadership of Chuan Leekpai, a native of Trang Province, the Democrats quickly became the dominant party in southern Thailand. The influences of provincial politicians from the south into the party created considerable tension with the party&#x27;s Bangkok establishment. Chuan&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Clean&quot; image, however, made him personally popular with Democrat Party supporters throughout Thailand, and so the party managed to stay cohesive under his leadership. The first Chuan government (1992–1995) fell when members of the cabinet were implicated in profiting from the Sor Phor Kor 4-01 land project documents distributed in Phuket Province. Chuan was again premier from 1997 to 2001, in the midst of the 1997 Asian financial crisis and its aftermath. The party lost a landslide election victory to Thaksin Shinawatra&#x27;s populist Thai Rak Thai (TRT) party, winning 128 seats compared to the TRT&#x27;s 248 in the 2001 general election.

After the election in 2001, Thaksin Shinawatra the leader of Thai Rak Thai Party, became prime minister. New Aspiration Party has joined the government. Shortly thereafter. The New Aspiration Party was merged with the Thai Rak Thai Party. Mostly to join Thai Rak Thai party (the governing party) with Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh except Lieutenant Colonel Thita Rangsitpol Manitkul, WRTA Member of the Parliament and Deputy Secretary of the party. Offset to the Democrat Party (Thailand) (Opposition Party) remains the only MPs moving from the opposition party government. During her tenure as a member of the House of Representatives.

===The Democrat Party in the 2000s===

====Banyat Bantadtan====
In 2003, Chuan retired from his position as party leader. Banyat Bantadtan, a southerner and a close aide to Chuan, succeeded him after a closely fought leadership contest with Abhisit Vejjajiva. 

Democrat Party&#x27;s candidate Apirak Kosayothin won the 2004 Bangkok gubernatorial election; the TRT Party did not submit a candidate. The Democrat Party lost further ground to Thai Rak Thai in the 2005 general election. In the election campaign, the Democrats had a populist platform, promoting job creation, universal education and health care, and law and order against crime and corruption. The party aimed to gain 201 seats, enough to launch a vote of a no confidence debate against the premier. They won 96 of 500 seats and 18.3 percent of the popular vote. The party&#x27;s leader, Banyat Bantadtan, resigned after the election.

On 6 March 2005, Abhisit Vejjajiva was elected new party leader. Upon succeeding the party&#x27;s leadership from Banyat, Abhisit noted, &quot;It will take a long time to revive the party because we need to look four years ahead and consider how to stay in the hearts of the people.&quot;

====Abhisit Vejjajiva and the Thai Rak Thai government====
The popularity of the populist Thai Rak Thai Party in Thai politics from 2001 to 2006 presented new challenges to the Democrat Party. The TRT championed populist policies with its focus on providing affordable and quality health care for all citizens, village-managed microcredit development funds, the government-sponsored One Tambon One Product program, and others. The populist policies earned the TRT enormous support from rural constituencies, unprecedented in Thailand&#x27;s history.

Opposition to the TRT government rose in Bangkok after Thaksin&#x27;s family announced their tax-free sale of their 49.6 percent stake in Shin Corp to Temasek for almost 73.3 billion baht on 23 January 2006. The People&#x27;s Alliance for Democracy began a series of anti-government protests. Several Democrat Party leaders also joined the PAD, which accused Thaksin of disloyalty to the throne and asked King Bhumibol to appoint a replacement prime minister. Thaksin Shinawatra dissolved the House of Representatives on 24 February 2006 and called for an election. On 24 March 2006, Abhisit Vejjajiva publicly backed the People&#x27;s Alliance for Democracy&#x27;s call for a royally-appointed government. Bhumibol, in a speech on 26 April 2006, responded, &quot;Asking for a royally-appointed prime minister is undemocratic. It is, pardon me, a mess. It is irrational&quot;.

Abhisit and his opposition parties allies boycotted the April 2006 elections, claiming it &quot;diverted public attention&quot; from Thaksin&#x27;s corruption charges and his sale of Shin Corp. The boycott caused a constitutional crisis, prompting Thaksin to call another round of elections in October 2006, which the Democrats did not boycott. The army seized power on 19 September and cancelled the upcoming election.

====2006 coup and military government====
Abhisit voiced displeasure at the 2006 coup that overthrew Thaksin, but otherwise did not protest it or the military junta that ruled Thailand for over a year. A fact-finding panel at the attorney-general&#x27;s office found that the Democrat Party bribed other parties to boycott the April 2006 parliamentary election, which forced a constitutional crisis, and voted to dissolve the party. It also found that Thaksin&#x27;s Thai Rak Thai party bribed other parties to contest the election. A junta tribunal acquitted Abhisit and the Democrats of the vote fraud charges, but convicted and banned the Thai Rak Thai party and its entire executive team.

Abhisit supported the junta&#x27;s 2007 Constitution, calling it an improvement on the 1997 constitution. The military junta organized general elections for 23 December 2007.

Despite being banned from politics for five years, Thaksin Shinawatra was popular in his former support bases in the central, north, and northeastern regions and attempted to maintain an active role in Thai politics by supporting the People&#x27;s Power Party, which had become the successor party of the banned TRT. Abhisit promoted populist policies in his party&#x27;s campaign as the Democrat Party&#x27;s platform in the 2007 parliamentary election. He claimed that while his platform was categorically considered to be populist, it sought to curb inflation while maintaining fiscal soundness, to apply the village-based microcredit development funds used in the Thaksin-led government, but do it as part of promoting royalist sufficiency economy policies in rural areas, and to strengthen the country&#x27;s long-term competitiveness through universal education through high school.

In the junta-administered 2007 parliamentary election, the People&#x27;s Power Party won the largest share of the vote and formed a six-party coalition government. The Democrats&#x27; populist platform was poorly received in the central, north, and northeastern regions. The Democrat Party became the opposition party as it was the second-largest party in the House of Representatives.

====People&#x27;s Alliance for Democracy and the 2008 political crisis====
The People&#x27;s Alliance for Democracy resurfaced to destabilize the People&#x27;s Power government, after having gone dormant following the 2006 coup. Several Democrat Party leaders allied themselves with PAD in the subsequent 2008–2010 Thai political crisis. PAD organized extended street protests and later led a months-long seizure of Government House, the seat of Thai government. In November 2008, PAD supporters seized and occupied Don Muang Airport and Suvarnabhumi Airport.

PAD declared that the only person they would accept as premier was Abhisit of the Democrat Party. Abhisit disapproved of the sieges, but did not stop his deputies from their PAD involvement.

====2008–2011 coalition government====

The sieges ended when the constitutional court banned the People&#x27;s Power Party and two of its coalition allies. During the critical period that followed the rulings, it is alleged that army commander and co-leader of the 2006 coup, General Anupong Paochinda, coerced former PPP MPs, mainly those of the Friends of Newin Group, to endorse a Democrat Party-led coalition, which secured enough parliamentary votes to allow Abhisit to be elected prime minister. These MPs, along with MPs of four other former PPP-coalition parties, crossed the aisle to endorse a Democrat-led coalition government. In a December 2008 parliamentary session, the Democrat-led coalition government was voted upon, with 235 to 198 votes in favor of Democrat Party leader and candidate for PM Abhisit Vejjajiva.

During Songkran (Thai New Year), anti-government UDD protesters disrupted the Fourth East Asia Summit. Violent protests then erupted in Bangkok, leading Abhisit to declare a state of emergency for three days, censoring the media, and using military force to end the protests.

Soon afterward, PAD leader Sondhi Limthongkul was the target of an unsuccessful assassination attempt. Both Sondhi&#x27;s son and Thaksin claimed that factions within the Democrat government were behind the assassination. Abhisit&#x27;s foreign minister counter-claimed that Thaksin was behind it.

==== 2011 general election ====
Abhisit dissolved parliament in early-2011 and scheduled general elections for 3 July 2011. Abhisit unveiled a slate of candidates highlighted by 30 celebrities and heirs of political families, including Chitpas Bhirombhakdi, heiress of the Singha Beer fortune and former staff member of Abhisit&#x27;s secretariat office. Abhisit promised to increase the minimum wage by 25 percent if the Democrat Party won the election.

At the general election on 3 July 2011, the Democrats were only able to defend 159 seats in the House of Representatives, while rivaling Pheu Thai Party led by Yingluck Shinawatra won an outright majority. The next day, Abhisit stepped down as the party leader. However, on 6 August, he was re-elected as the leader of the Democrat Party with the support of 96 percent of those eligible to vote at the party&#x27;s assembly—some 330 people including local branch leaders and MPs.

==== 2019 general election ====
In 2018, the Democrats held a contest for party leader in preparation for the upcoming election. Abhisit was re-elected party leader, beating former PDRC leader, Warong Dechgitvigrom, by approximately 10,000 votes.

Abhisit said that the Democrats would not form a government with Phalang Pracharat, the most prominent pro-junta party. Additionally, he said the Democrats would not support Prayut Chan-o-cha for Prime Minister. These statements was met with skepticism from both the junta and the media.

In April, Prayut responded by saying that he expected the Democrats to change their stance and work with the junta after the election. Additionally, many commentators predicted Democrats would form a government coalition with Phalang Pracharat.

The 2019 election proved to be a major upset to the party, which came in fourth place and won no seats in its traditional stronghold of Bangkok, leading to Abhisit resigning as party leader, having stated previously that he would do so if the party won fewer than 100 seats. Jurin Laksanawisit was elected to succeed him on 15 May. The Democrats then formed a pact with the Bhumjaithai Party, intending to use their combined 103 MPs as leverage for negotiations with other parties. At the first meeting of the new parliament, Democrat ex-prime minister Chuan was nominated speaker of the House of Representatives by PPRP deputy leader Nataphol Teepsuwan and was elected to that office. This move was seen by commentators as a signal that a deal had been reached and a coalition with the Phalang Pracharat party was imminent. The coalition was finally made official on 4 June, one day before the National Assembly was scheduled to vote for the prime minister, following a vote by party MPs and executives. Following this, Abhisit resigned as MP, stating that he could not break his previous stance on not supporting Phalang Pracharat.

====2022 sexual scandal====
Prinn Panitchpakdi, deputy leader of the Democrat Party was accused of many sexual misconduct cases, including rape. Senior executives such as Kanok Wongtra-ngan and Mallika Boonmeetrakul Mahasuk left the party for a moral responsibility.

==== 2023 general election ====
The 2023 election proved another setback to the party, which slipped further down to sixth place with only 25 MPs, prompting the resignation of party leader Jurin. The Democrats once again won no seats in its traditional stronghold of Bangkok and received only 2.68% of the party-list vote in the capital. This is likely due to conservatives voting for the military-backed United Thai Nation while the educated middle class (once the Democrats’ core voter base) moved to the progressive Move Forward Party. Furthermore, the party lost ground in the historically Democrat southern provinces to other conservative parties.

During the 2nd prime ministership election, 16 out of 25 Democrat MPs voted for the Pheu Thai candidate Srettha Thavisin despite agreeing to abstain. This caused a divide between the “New Democrat” MPs (who are more open to working with Pheu Thai) and the “Old Guard” MPs (who still view Pheu Thai as their historical rival.)

On 9 December 2023, a meeting was held to choose the party’s new leader with four candidates running for leadership — former prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, the party’s acting leader Chalermchai Sri-on, former Democrat MP Lt-Colonel Thita Rangsitpol Manitkul former MP and businesswoman Watanya “Madame Dear” Bunnag. Before the actual leadership vote was held, Watanya was forced out of the race due to not meeting the requirements which led to her immediately leaving the meeting in tears. After a brief chat between Abhisit and Chalermchai, Abhisit announced his decision to withdraw his candidacy and leave the party altogether. The meeting resulted in Chalermchai Sri-on being elected as the Democrat Party’s new leader.

<doc id="866141" wikidata="Q1509049" url="?curid=866141" title="Liberal Democratic Party (Turkey)">
<text>Liberal Democratic Party (, LDP) is a classical liberal party in Turkey. LDP was founded in 1994 as “&quot;Liberal Parti”&quot; by Turkish entrepreneur Besim Tibuk. According to data published in January 2024, the party has 3,601 members.

Tibuk was the advisor of Turkish President Turgut Özal until Özal died on 17 April 1993. After the death of Turgut Özal, Besim Tibuk decided to found a new party to emphasize the liberal movement in Turkey. Tibuk first founded the party as &quot;Liberal Party&quot;, but following the &quot;1994 Liberal Democratic Party Ordinary Congress&quot; the party&#x27;s name then changed from the Liberal Party to &quot;Liberal Democratic Party&quot;. After the failure of his party in the 2002 general elections, Tibuk resigned on 25 November 2002, leaving his office to Nizam Kağıtçıbaşı, who only remained 48 days in office and got voted out by Ercan Çalı. Çalı remained in office for 336 days, before eventually getting replaced by member of the Grand National Assembly Emin Şirin, who had resigned from AKP and joined the Liberal Democratic Party on 14 October 2003 in the party&#x27;s 1st Extraordinary Congress. Later on, Emin Şirin announced his resignation from the chairmanship and party membership on 13 February 2004 due to differences of opinion with the party, and thus, between 14 December 2003 and 13 February 2004, the party was represented in the Turkish Grand National Assembly for the first and last time in its history. Hakan Çizem took over the vacant seat to remain chairman of the party until 20 June 2005. Çizem was later voted out by Cem Toker who remained the leader of LDP from 20 June 2005 to 29 January 2017. Since then, Gültekin Tırpancı has been the leader of the party. Some of LDP&#x27;s current political views include reducing government spending and taxes, lowering tax rates, reducing government bureaucracy, abolishing the compulsory General Health Insurance and switching to a voluntary private health insurance system, ending compulsory military service and switching to professional military service.

LDP announced in the following years that there were no youth branches and women&#x27;s branches in the party due to the principles of not making age and gender discrimination in the administration. However, the youth group called &quot;Genç Yunuslar&quot; (Young Dolphins) continues to exist even though it is not considered an official organization by LDP. Unlike other parties in Turkish politics, the party uses a humorous language on its official Twitter accounts.

LDP is the first party in Turkey to advocate for the legalization of marijuana.

== Policies ==
=== Presidential system ===
LDP advocates changing Turkey&#x27;s parliamentary system, arguing that it brings political instability and believes that the U.S. style presidential system with two round system should be implemented. LDP also supported the &quot;No!” vote in the 2017 Turkish constitutional referendum, arguing that proposed amendments have nothing related with presidential system.

=== SMB&#x27;s ===
LDP supports low taxation. The party believes that only three types of taxes should be implemented; income tax, which it believes that it should be levied on businesses employing more than 5 people, consumption tax, which it believes that it should be levied only on the end consumer, and property tax, to finance municipal costs.

LDP supports the abolition of government agencies such as the SBB and supports the simplification of company establishment and closure procedures. LDP opposes all government agency enforced taxes. LDP supports the abolition of compulsory membership in chambers of industry and commerce.

=== LGBT rights ===
LDP believes that LGBT rights fall within the scope of individual freedoms, and advocates tax exemption for donations made to non-governmental organisations providing education on LGBT rights and supports increased penalties for violence against LGBT people. LDP has also stated that it supports pride parades in Turkey.

=== Women&#x27;s rights ===
LDP supports increased penalties for violence against women and advocates tax exemption for donations to non-governmental organisations providing education on women&#x27;s rights.

=== TRT ===
In his 1999 pre-election propaganda speech, which was going to be broadcast on TRT, LDP leader Tibuk stated he would sell everything as an election promise, including TRT. The quote later became an internet meme, mainly being used by liberals across Turkey.

== Party leaders ==
==Elections==
=== 2014 local elections ===
LDP won its first mayoralty in local elections in 2014 in the town of Konakkuran in the Malazgirt district of Muş. Bülent Ateş, who came first in the elections, stated that he did not believe in liberal ideology and that he ran as a candidate from the LDP only because its emblem was a memorable party, and later switched to the Democratic Regions Party along with his 5 council members. After 5 out of 12 council members switched to the Democratic Regions Party with Bülent Ateş, one council member in Ağrı, Patnos switched to the conservative Justice and Development Party.

=== 2023 general elections ===
For the 2023 elections, the LDP made the following statement: &quot;Although our economic views do not match, within the framework of the current conditions and discourses, we declare to the public that our support is in favor of the Nation Alliance for respect for the law, modern secular democracy and a transparent parliament.&quot;

==History of the Party==

Party was formed on Founding Congress of September 12, 1991. I.R. Markulov was selected as the first Head of the LPU.

In summer 1993 Liberal Party became all-Ukrainian. The first Congress in Kyiv adopted the program based on values of social liberalism.

In January 1995 the second Congress of LPU was held, that choose O.I. Soskin as the Head. At that time The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine was forming the liberal parliamentary fraction &quot;Socio-market choice&quot;. LPU took strong centrist stand.

The third Congress of LPU (January–April, 1996) approved new edition of party program and its new Charter. The Congress elected Volodymyr Shcherban as the Head of Liberal Party of Ukraine.

In 1997, the LPU actively enters the international scene for the first time, becomes a full member of international liberal movement and joins the Liberal International on the Congress in Oxford.
In 1998 it takes stand in elections to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine in the bloc &quot;Party of Labor and Liberal Party – Together!&quot; Bloc does not overcome 4% electoral threshold and do not get to the Verkhovna Rada.

In 1999 the Liberal Party of Ukraine supported the candidate for President of Ukraine – Leonid Kuchma.

In 2002 it took stand in parliamentary and local elections as a member of electoral bloc of Viktor Yushchenko &quot;Our Ukraine&quot;. In result of elections two members of LPU entered the Verkhovna Rada. Two liberals chaired regional councils and one member became a mayor, 600 members of LPU became members of regional, district in cities, village and town councils.
On the eve of president elections in 2004, under the pressure of the Head V.P. Shcherban, The Liberal Party of Ukraine decided to withdraw from the Our Ukraine bloc and join the coalition that supported presidential candidate V.F. Yanukovich.

On June 4, 2005, LPU political council accepted the resignation of V.P. Scherban from post of the Chairman of the Liberty Party of Ukraine. On June 25, 2005 the new Head - P.S. Tsyganka was elected. The new composition of the Political Council and Head of the Party was selected.

In 2006 The Liberal Party of Ukraine took stand in the parliamentary elections independently and failed to overcome the electoral threshold.

LPU refused to participate in early parliamentary elections in 2007 because of reasonably disbelief in the honesty and transparency of their implementation.

In 2010 the Liberal Party nominated its candidate for President of Ukraine, the first head of LPU I.Markulov, which, however, was not registered by the CEC for technical reasons.

In the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election the party won 0.07% of the national votes and no constituencies (it had competed in 3 constituencies) and thus failed to win parliamentary representation.

In the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election the party again failed to win parliamentary representation since it now won 0.05% of the national votes and again no constituencies (it had competed in 38 constituencies).

In the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election the party is again competing in constituencies. One of the candidates the party put forward is, former head of the Presidential Administration of Ukraine during the presidency of Viktor Yanukovych, Andriy Klyuyev.

<text>The Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc () was the name of the bloc of political parties in Ukraine led by Yulia Tymoshenko since 2001. In November 2011, the participation of blocs of political parties in parliamentary elections was banned. The core party of the alliance, Batkivshchyna, remained a major force in Ukrainian politics.

==Overview==

Founded for the 2002 parliamentary elections, the alliance attracted most of its voters from western Ukrainian (Ukrainian speaking) provinces (oblasts) and from central Ukraine. The alliance had low support in the east and the south of Ukraine (where the Russian language is dominant). though they did recruit several politicians from these Russian-speaking provinces like Crimea (Lyudmyla Denisova) and Luhansk Oblast (Natalia Korolevska). The alliance was often associated with the 2004 Orange Revolution (the alliance&#x27;s leader, Yulia Tymoshenko, was one of the leaders of the Orange Revolution) and thus named &quot;Orange Party&quot; in media publications. The alliance also had prominent members who had been associated with the opponents of the Orange Revolutions (the &quot;Blue camp&quot;) including Ivan Kyrylenko, the former faction leader of the Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko (BYuT) in the Ukrainian Parliament. Other notable BYuT deputies were Soviet dissident Levko Lukyanenko and former UNA-UNSO leader Andriy Shkil.

BYuT had intended to include more representatives from the education sector into its voting lists. According to Tymoshenko: &quot;Certain branches and sectors have powerful lobbies. And there are only three to four lobbyists who represent the spheres of education and health care in the Verkhovna Rada [Ukrainian parliament]. Therefore some sectors lack financing, while others have excessive funding&quot;.

According to Tymoshenko, representatives of business had no dominant influence on decision making in her political force. &quot;Business is represented in the parliament, but it doesn&#x27;t shape politics this is what distinguishes my political force from the Party of Regions for instance.&quot; Several billionaires have been members of the BYuT faction in the Verkhovna Rada.

==History==

===Creation===
In January 2001, President Leonid Kuchma dismissed Tymoshenko from the post of Deputy Prime Minister for fuel and energy sector in the cabinet of Viktor Yushchenko. Following this, and during the &quot;Ukraine without Kuchma&quot;-protests, Tymoshenko began the loose organisation the National Salvation Committee on 9 February 2001. This organisation later merged into the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc (BYuT) in November 2001.

The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe noted at the time that there were physical assaults and harassment of candidates and campaign workers associated with the BYuT, and other opposition parties leading up to the March 2002 election. The BYuT itself complained of campaign-related violations including &quot;an informal &#x27;media blackout,&#x27; [and] negatively slanted coverage&quot;.

At the parliamentary elections on 30 March 2002, the alliance comprised the following liberal and nationalist member parties:
*Fatherland Party (&quot;Partiya Bat&#x27;kivshchyna &quot;), also rendered as All-Ukrainian Union &quot;Fatherland&quot; (&quot;Vseukrajins’ke Ob’ednannja Bat’kivščyna&quot;) (13 berths)
*Ukrainian Republican Party &quot;Sobor&quot; (&quot;Ukrajins’ka Respublikanska Partija Sobor&quot;) (3 berths)
*Ukrainian Social Democratic Party (&quot;Ukrajins’ka Social-Demokratyčna Partija&quot;) (3 berths)
*Ukrainian Republican Party (&quot;Ukrajinska Respublikanska Partija&quot;) (1 berth)
*Non-partisan (2 berths)

;Top 10 members
The bloc won 7.2% of the popular vote and 22 out of 450 seats. This result was better than expected, because BYuT had limited access to the media and limited support from local authorities.

The alliance supported Viktor Yushchenko during the Ukrainian presidential election of 2004, and played an active role in the widespread acts of civil non-violent protest that became known as the Ukrainian Orange Revolution.

In January 2005, Tymoshenko became Prime Minister of Ukraine under Yushchenko&#x27;s presidency.

The party had lost a few seats in 2002 and 2003, but doubled to 40 members of parliament in September 2005.

===Electoral breakthrough===

The BYuT entered the parliamentary elections on 26 March 2006, with only Fatherland and Ukrainian Social Democratic Party after both republican parties left the alliance. Nonetheless, BYuT moved into second place with 22.27% of the vote behind Party of Regions with 33% and ahead of Our Ukraine with less than 14% support. BYuT won 129 seats out of 450.

Note that after the 2002 merger of the Ukrainian Republican Party &quot;Sobor&quot; and the Ukrainian Republican Party – which then became known as the Ukrainian Republican Party &quot;Sobor&quot; (URP Sobor) – the party went through a schism before the 2006 elections. The majority of the party led by Anatoliy Mativienko aligned with Our Ukraine Bloc, while others left the party and stayed with BYuT. After the 2006 elections, Levko Lukyanenko managed to reinstate the original Ukrainian Republican Party.

;Top 10 members
It was widely expected that a coalition between supporters of the Orange Movement would form Ukraine&#x27;s next government, but after three months of negotiations and a failure to reach an agreement the proposed coalition collapsed following the decision of the Socialist Party of Ukraine to support the formation of the &quot;anti-crisis coalition&quot; with Party of Regions and the Communist Party of Ukraine.

During the 2007 parliamentary elections, the BYuT consisted of:
*All-Ukrainian Union &quot;Fatherland&quot;
*Ukrainian Social Democratic Party
*Reforms and Order Party

The Ukrainian Republican Party &quot;Sobor&quot; was part of the Our Ukraine–People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc in this election.

;Top 10 members
In the parliamentary elections on 30 September 2007, the bloc won 156 of 450 seats (and thus 30.71% of the total votes), securing an additional 1.5 million votes (8.24%) in comparison with the 2006 election. Most of this vote swing came as a result of consolidation in regions where BYuT had already been the leading party. Statistics published by Ukraine&#x27;s Central Electoral Commission indicate that most of the swing came from minor parties with some voters turning away from the Socialist Party and to a lesser extent Our Ukraine.

On 15 October 2007, Our Ukraine–People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc and the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc agreed to form a majority coalition in the new parliament of the 6th convocation. On 29 November, a coalition was signed between the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc and Our Ukraine–People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc (OU-PSD) which together had received 45% of the national vote. On 18 December 2007 Yulia Tymoshenko, with a margin of two votes, was elected Prime Minister.

During the 2008 Ukrainian political crisis the BYuT–OU-PSD coalition faltered. There were negotiations between BYuT and Party of Regions to form a coalition but after Volodymyr Lytvyn was elected Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada (parliament) on 9 December 2008, he announced the creation of a coalition between his Lytvyn Bloc, BYuT and OU-PSD. Following negotiations, the three parties officially signed the coalition agreement on 16 December. It was unsure if this coalition would stop the snap election although Speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn predicted that the Verkhovna Rada would work until the next scheduled elections in 2012. President Viktor Yushchenko&#x27;s decree to dissolve the Verkhovna Rada (parliament) – made during the 2008 Ukrainian political crisis – was never put into action.

On 3 July 2009 the Verkhovna Rada terminated the mandate of BYuT deputy Viktor Lozinskyi. At the time there was a criminal proceeding against Lozinskyi who was suspected of deliberately inflicting grave bodily harm causing death; the Prosecutor-General&#x27;s Office had applied to the Verkhovna Rada for permission to arrest Lozinskyi. 416 out of 444 deputies registered in Parliament, including 133 deputies of the BYoT, voted for removal of the Lozinskyi&#x27;s parliamentary immunity.

===Return to opposition===
In October 2009, BYuT endorsed Yulia Tymoshenko, then incumbent Prime Minister, as their candidate for the 2010 Presidential election. She was not elected. In the second round of the election she lost to Viktor Yanukovich while gaining 45.47% of the votes; Yanukovich got 48.95% of the votes so Tymoshenko lost by 3.48%.

After the fall of the second Tymoshenko Government on 3 March 2010 (seven BYuT lawmakers had supported the motion of no confidence) BYuT moved into opposition. On 11 March 2010 BYuT appealed to the Central Election Commission of Ukraine to terminate the parliamentary mandates of six parliamentarians who had joined the new parliamentary coalition. Ten representative of BYuT joined the coalition supporting the Azarov Government as an independent MP in April 2010.

On 16 March, a shadow government including BYuT was established.

It late May 2010, BYuT deputies had to submit new applications for faction membership. On 26 June 2010 the Political Council Presidium of All-Ukrainian Union &quot;Fatherland&quot; expelled Oleksandr Feldman, a Verkhovna Rada deputy of the BYuT faction, from the party because he had joined the coalition supporting the Azarov Government the previous month. On 21 September 2010, another 28 members of the faction were officially expelled because they had joined the majority coalition.

On 16 November 2010, the ByuT faction was officially renamed &quot;Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko-Batkivschyna&quot;.

By late 2010 the BYuT faction consisted of 113 lawmakers of the original 156 elected in September 2007. Most who left BYuT had become members of the &quot;Stability and Reforms&quot; coalition supporting the Azarov Government (17 of these became founding members of Reforms for the Future in February 2011). Four joined the Party of Regions faction in October 2010 (followed by five others in March 2011). In early February 2011 seven more deputies were expelled from the faction. On 2 February 2011 party-leader Tymoshenko claimed members of the &quot;Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko-Batkivschyna&quot;-faction had been offered money and places in the election list of the Party of Regions and have been blackmailed into voting for laws introduced by the Azarov Government. In 2011, the faction of BYuT lost 11 more deputies. On 29 December 2011, it consisted of 102 deputies.

Alliance leader Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in jail in October 2011 on abuse of power charges. Ukrainian President Yanukovych and the Party of Regions have been accused of trying to create a &quot;controlled democracy&quot; in Ukraine, and as a means to this tried to &quot;destroy&quot; main opposition party BYuT, but both have denied this charges.

===Dissolution===
In November 2011, the participation of blocs of political parties in parliamentary elections was banned. The People&#x27;s Self-Defense Political Party merged with All-Ukrainian Union &quot;Fatherland&quot;.

&quot;Fatherland&quot; and Reforms and Order Party (with People&#x27;s Movement of Ukraine) announced to compete one single party list during the parliamentary elections in March 2012. On 7 April 2012 Arseniy Yatsenyuk announced his party Front for Change would join them on this (single) party list.

On 15 March 2012, the Ukrainian Social-Democratic Party was expelled from the bloc for alleged &quot;cooperation with the presidential administration and the ruling regime&quot;; the day before the Ukrainian Social Democratic Party party-leader Natalia Korolevska had been expelled from the &quot;Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko-Batkivschyna&quot;-faction. The Ukrainian Social-Democratic Party had stated in December 2011 &quot;that we are doing nothing that can harm the Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko... Our task is to collect the most votes in parliament at the 2012 parliamentary elections&quot;. On 22 March 2012 the Ukrainian Social-Democratic Party was renamed Party of Natalia Korolevska &quot;Ukraine – Forward!&quot;.
&quot;Fatherland&quot; became the &quot;umbrella&quot; party with an election list that included members of Reforms and Order Party, People&#x27;s Movement of Ukraine, Front of Changes, For Ukraine, People&#x27;s Self-Defense, Civil Position and Social Christian Party. In July 2012, members of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People joined this list. This list named themselves: United Opposition &quot;Fatherland&quot;. During the election the list won 62 seats and 25.55% of the votes under the proportional party-list system (falling from 30.71% in 2007 for BYuT) and another 39 by winning 39 simple-majority constituencies. This gave them a total of 101 seats and 22.67% of the 450 seats in the Ukrainian Parliament. The party lost about 2 million voters compared with BYuT&#x27;s results in the previous election.

By late November 2012 the BYuT faction consisted of 97 lawmakers of the original 156 elected in September 2007.

On 15 June 2013, Reforms and Order Party and Front for Change merged into &quot;Fatherland&quot;.

== Ideology ==
The official ideology of the block is solidarism. But the block includes parties with different ideologies:
Pro-Europeanism, liberal nationalism and social democracy.
The hostile parties claim that the ideology of BYuT is populism.

==Electoral results==
===Verkhovna Rada===
===Presidential elections===
==Issues==
The BYuT had advocated the following positions:

*Constitutional reform – BYuT proposed a national referendum on the system of governance (Presidential or Parliamentary) and the adoption a new constitution. 
*Justice – The bloc advocated raising salaries for judges and abolishing the requirement for them to hear specific cases. They proposed legal aid schemes for poor citizens so that income would not be the final determinant of judicial representation and consideration.
*Media – The bloc advocated for the creation of public broadcast television, greater transparency and disclosure of ownership of media interests, the establishment of agreements between owners of media outlets and journalists in order to facilitate open and honest editorial policy, and increased Internet availability.
*Corruption – The bloc proposed implementing a systematic program to combat corruption.
*Social reform – The bloc proposed to improve social welfare services while encouraging an expansion of the population. Specific plans included obligatory medical insurance, free state medical services for those in need, affordable medication, a rural doctor program, and increased payments for each newborn child. In addition, there were proposals for increased baby-care allowances and long-term low interest loans for young families.
*Education – The bloc proposed to restore the status and raise the standards of the education system to stop the brain drain problem. Measures included incentives for investment in professional and higher education and in research and development.
*Transit – The bloc proposed to build new oil and gas pipelines and expand public-private partnership investments to improve roads, railways and airports. They advocated a liberalization of the transit system.
*Business – The bloc wished to address the imbalance between large enterprises, which dominate the business sector, and small enterprises by encouraging the growth of wealth-creating small- and medium-sized enterprises. They advocated a new tax code while expanding assessment, minimizing tax remissions, abolishing VAT, and overall simplifying the process to set up and administer businesses. They advocated lower business lending rates in line with European levels, and measures to liberalize banking and insurance services and encourage longer-term lending. Shareholder rights will be protected, the permit system reformed, and the governmental bureaucracy reduced.
*Energy – The bloc sought to overturn the nation&#x27;s dependence on monopolies for importing energy while strengthening collaboration and coordination of energy policy with the EU. Specific policies included integration with the European market for the supply and consumption of electricity, measures to reduce oil and gas consumption, an increase in utilization of brown coal and the production of synthetic fuel. They wished to complete the Odessa–Brody–Plotsk (Gdańsk) transit pipeline, build a gas transit pipeline linking the Caspian Sea (running through Azerbaijan and Georgia) and the Black Sea, and encourage domestic production both onshore and offshore in the Black and Azov Seas.
*Investment – The bloc encouraged domestic and foreign investment by removing legal barriers and streamlining procedures, particularly for the technology and energy sectors. Other proposals included transparent and open privatization and tender processes and the establishment of a network of regional ombudsman to simplify processes for obtaining import certificates. All new legislation was to be in accordance with WTO practices.
*Construction – BYuT proposed a system of mortgage lending with lower interest rates for house purchases along with government targets for public housing projects. Decentralization to the regional level would facilitate these targets for both housing and commercial facilities. Special tax incentives were envisioned for industrial projects to complement planning for investment described above.
*Agriculture – The bloc advocated a stronger, more profitable and environmentally responsible agricultural sector. Crucial measures included the availability of development funds, agricultural exchanges, insurance funds and land-banks. Other initiatives involved the promotion of agricultural products to overseas markets. To facilitate a functioning land market, agricultural producers would have access to low-interest loans, with incentives for the development of cooperative banks and credit unions in rural areas.

==Relationships with other parties==

Our Ukraine has been the main ally of the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc (BYuT) during the Orange Revolution and in its aftermath.

Relations with arch-rival Party of Regions (PoR) has always been sour but at times seemed to improve. In 2009 a coalition government between these two seemed to become a reality. But early June talks to build a broad coalition to address the economic crisis collapsed; Yulia Tymoshenko accused PoR leader Viktor Yanukovych of betrayal. At that time, Ukrainian President Viktor Yuschenko showed little enthusiasm for a BYuT–PoR coalition.

Although unrelated to these developments, American analyst Ryan Renicker asserted that allegations of Tymoshenko&#x27;s alleged wrongdoings are unsubstantiated and misguided. Official documents from both the European Union and the United States suggest Tymoshenko&#x27;s prosecution and imprisonment were politically motivated.

<text>Aviva plc is a British multinational insurance company headquartered in London, England. It has about 19 million customers across its core markets of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada. In the United Kingdom, Aviva is the largest general insurer and a leading life and pensions provider. Aviva is also the second largest general insurer in Canada.

Aviva has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange, and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.

==Name==
The name of the company upon its formation in May 2000 was CGNU plc and was created when Norwich Union merged with insurer CGU. In April 2002, the company&#x27;s shareholders voted to change the company name to Aviva plc, an invented palindrome word derived from &quot;viva&quot;, the Latin for &#x27;alive&#x27; and designed to be short, memorable and work worldwide. The Norwich Union brand was retained for the UK long-term savings and general insurance business.

In April 2008, Aviva announced that it would adopt the Aviva name as its worldwide consumer-facing brand, and that the Norwich Union brand would be phased out in the United Kingdom.

==History==
Aviva can trace its history back to the establishment of the Hand in Hand Fire &amp; Life Insurance Society in London in 1696.

It was created by a merger of two British insurance firms, Norwich Union and CGU plc (itself created by the merger of 1998 of Commercial Union and General Accident) as CGNU in February 2000. The Aviva name was adopted in July 2002. Thereafter, most of the group operations, except for some strong local brands, were carried out under the uniform brand &quot;Aviva&quot;.

In 2002, Aviva purchased Abeille Vie, a French life insurance company.

In March 2005, Aviva acquired the RAC plc breakdown recovery operation for around £1.1 billion.

In July 2006, Aviva greatly increased its presence in the United States by acquiring AmerUs Group, a Des Moines based financial services company, founded as the Brotherhood of American Yeomen in 1896, in a $2.9 billion (£1.6 billion) deal.

The launch was supported by a £9 million advertising campaign to promote the rebranding (one of the most expensive ever in the insurance field), with the participation of celebrities including Bruce Willis and Alice Cooper. In June 2009, the company decided to dispose of &quot;Navigator&quot;, its Australian wealth management business, to National Australia Bank for A$825 million (£401 million).

In October 2009, the company decided to focus on its commercial insurance sector and demonstrate its commitment to brokers by launching their &#x27;find a broker&#x27; facility, using the British Insurance Brokers Association search engine. To help them with this endeavour, Paul Whitehouse was recruited to play the part of a successful hairdresser running three salons. The message of the campaign focused on business insurance through insurance brokers.

In September 2011, Aviva completed the sale of RAC plc breakdown recovery operation for £1.0 billion to The Carlyle Group. In February 2012, Aviva sold its occupational health business to the British support services company Capita.

In July 2012, Aviva announced plans to sell or close 16 non core businesses in order to simplify its activities and boost shareholder returns. As part of the plans Aviva announced the sale of its operations in South Korea and the closure to new business of its bulk buying annuity unit in the United Kingdom. In August 2012, Aviva announced that up to 800 jobs would be lost, following a reorganization caused by further turmoil in the Eurozone.

In December 2012, Aviva agreed to sell Aviva USA Corporation to Athene Holding for US$1.8 billion (£1.1 billion) as part of a plan to improve shareholder returns and reduce the group&#x27;s capital requirements, having paid $2.9 billion in 2006 and incurring a large loss on sale. Athene subsequently sold the life insurance business of Aviva to Global Atlantic.

On 13 April 2015, Aviva completed the £5.6 billion all share takeover of Friends Life Group. Andy Briggs, then group chief executive of Friends Life, became CEO of Aviva UK Life, with Mark Wilson continuing as CEO of the enlarged Aviva Group. In July 2016, Aviva froze withdrawals from the Aviva Investors Property Trust because of a lack of liquidity after Britain&#x27;s vote to leave the European Union on 23 June. In September 2017, Aviva agreed to sell its Italian joint venture Avipop Assicurazioni to Banco BPM for US$312.01 million (€265 million).

In March 2018, Aviva, controversially, announced that it &quot;had the ability&quot; to cancel its irredeemable preference shares at par. This caused a wider sell off in the preference share market in the United Kingdom. Also in March 2018 the company announced to spend around £600 million on so called &quot;bolt on&quot; acquisitions, that are in &quot;Poland, Turkey, anywhere we have existing markets&quot;.

In October 2018, Mark Wilson agreed to step down as CEO with immediate effect, with Adrian Montague taking interim control of the company, pending Wilson&#x27;s formal departure in 2019. Maurice Tulloch was appointed CEO in March 2019; however, he stood down in July 2020 for family health reasons and was replaced by Amanda Blanc, who previously served as an Independent Non-Executive Director of the company.

In November 2020, Aviva sold its stake in their Indonesian company Astra Aviva Life and their Hong Kong division.

In 2021, Aviva sold its French operations to Aéma Groupe. As part of the deal, Aviva agreed to indemnify Aéma against potential legal liabilities to Max-Hervé George. In May, Aviva completed the sale of its Turkish business, followed by businesses in Italy (Aviva Italia Holding) and Poland in December 2021.

In April 2023, Aviva terminated its membership of the Confederation of British Industry in response to allegations made by former employees of sexual harassment and rape at the business group.

In September 2023, it was announced Aviva had acquired the London-headquartered life insurance company, AIG Life Limited from Corebridge Financial for £460 million.

In November 2023, Aviva acquired a Canadian vehicle replacement insurance business, Optiom, for £100 million (US$126 million).

In December 2024, Aviva agreed to acquire Direct Line Group for £3.7 billion, nearly a month after its previous bid of £3.3bn was rejected.

==Operations==

Aviva&#x27;s main activities are the provision of general and life insurance, long term savings products and fund management services. The group has around 23,000 employees and 19 million customers. Aviva Investors has £227 billion assets under management as at 31 March 2023.

Following the completion of Friends Life Group Limited in April 2015, Friends Provident International Limited is now part of the Aviva Group.

==Senior management==
CEO Richard Harvey retired on 11 July 2007. His successor was Andrew Moss, the former group finance director. Moss was paid an annual base salary of £925,000 for his role as chief executive. Moss resigned on 8 May 2012, after shareholders voted down a proposed senior management pay deal which would have seen Moss increase his basic pay by 5% despite several years of Aviva underperformance.

Following the departure of Aviva&#x27;s CEO, Andrew Moss, McFarlane assumed the role of executive deputy chairman and became executive chairman on 1 July 2012. On 20 November 2012, Aviva announced that Mark Wilson had been appointed CEO, starting 1 January 2013.

On 12 September 2014, Aviva announced that Sir Adrian Montague would become non executive chairman, on the retirement of John McFarlane at the Aviva AGM in April 2015. On 9 October 2018, the Aviva Board announced Mark Wilson was to step down, remaining as part of the company until April 2019 though on garden leave; with Sir Adrian Montague assuming executive responsibilities in the interim whilst a replacement candidate is sought. Maurice Tulloch was appointed CEO in March 2019; however, he stood down in July 2020 for family health reasons and was replaced by Amanda Blanc, who previously served as an Independent Non-Executive Director of the company.

George Culmer took over as chairman from Sir Adrian Montague on 27 May 2020.

==Sponsorships==
In May 2008, Aviva became Norwich City Football Club&#x27;s main sponsor. In an advert from 2009 starring Paul Whitehouse, they feature a Plymouth Argyle F.C. fan who uses Aviva car insurance, followed by a Green Army chant. It also acquired the naming rights for the redeveloped Lansdowne Road stadium in Dublin, Ireland, which was renamed the Aviva Stadium. In January 2018, the naming rights were extended to 2025.

In 2023, Aviva sponsored Aviva Studios, a cultural space in Manchester. It has been designed to enable the commissioning of large scale and intimate work across different art forms, including dance, theatre, music, opera, visual arts, popular culture and digital work, plus major exhibitions and concerts.

Aviva, via its then-owned subsidiary RAC, sponsored the West Surrey Racing British Touring Car Championship team from 2006 through to 2009, and also sponsored Colin Turkington in an Aviva-branded car in the season finale of the 2007 World Touring Car Championship. Aviva again sponsored Turkington, under the banner of &#x27;Team Aviva-Cofco&#x27;, in selected races in the 2010, 2011 and 2012 WTCC.

Aviva sponsored rugby union&#x27;s English Premiership from 2010 to 2018.

== Vietnam ==
In Vietnam, Aviva started operating in the life insurance sector from July 2011, with its predecessor being Vietinbank Aviva Life Insurance Company Limited. In April 2017, Aviva Group announced the acquisition of 50% of the shares of the Vietinbank Aviva Life Insurance Joint Venture from VietinBank. On 17 July 2017, Vietinbank Aviva Life Insurance Company Limited was officially renamed Aviva Vietnam Life Insurance Company Limited (short for Aviva Vietnam).

<doc id="866154" wikidata="Q3049397" url="?curid=866154" title="Eildon Hill">
<text>Eildon Hill lies just south of Melrose, Scotland in the Scottish Borders, overlooking the town. The name is usually pluralised into &quot;the Eildons&quot; or &quot;Eildon Hills&quot;, because of its triple peak. The high eminence overlooks Teviotdale to the South. The north hilltop (of three peaks) is surrounded by over of ramparts, enclosing an area of about 16 ha (40 acres) in which at least 300 level platforms have been cut into the rock to provide bases for turf or timber-walled houses, forming one of the largest hill forts known in Scotland. A Roman army signalling station was later constructed on the same site as this hill fort.

The mid hilltop is the highest, whilst the south hilltop is the lowest. The hills are owned by the Duke of Buccleuch, Scotland&#x27;s largest private landowner. As with all land in Scotland the public have a right of responsible access to the hills, and there are many paths crossing the area and leading to all three summits.

The hills form part of the Eildon and Leaderfoot National Scenic Area, one of forty national scenic areas in Scotland, which have been defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development. The areas protected by the national scenic area (NSA) designation are considered to represent the type of scenic beauty &quot;popularly associated with Scotland and for which it is renowned&quot;. The Eildon and Leaderfoot NSA covers 3877 ha, and extends to include the town of Melrose, Scott&#x27;s View and Leaderfoot Viaduct.

==History==

It is possible that the hills were formed deep beneath the Earth&#x27;s surface as ancient laccoliths.

Excavations have revealed evidence that the hill fort was occupied by 1000 BC, in the Bronze Age. The ramparts seem to have been built and rebuilt in three phases. 296 individual hut floors have been identified within the fort, suggesting a population of around 2000, and making it one of the largest known in Scotland from this period. The hill fort is thought to have been the capital of the Selgovae, who lived in upper Tweeddale prior to the arrival of the Romans.

In the 1st century AD the Roman army built the massive fort of Trimontium at Newstead, named after the three peaks, at the foot of the hill on the bank of the River Tweed. In association with this fort they constructed a signal tower with a tiled roof in a 15 m diameter enclosure built on the summit of Eildon North Hill. The hill fort may have been abandoned by this time, as Roman archaeological finds uncovered during excavation of the site in 1986 all overlaid native finds. The tower was thought to have been constructed out of timber during the Flavian period, with a later tower being constructed out of stone during the reign of Emperor Antoninus Pius. Finds including Roman coins and pottery have suggested that some of the house platforms were again in use in the 2nd to 4th century.

There is some evidence that prehistoric peoples regarded the Eildon Hills as a holy place and scholars believe they may have been a place of ceremonial gatherings. There are several holy springs around the base of the hills, now dedicated to Christian saints, but probably originally sacred to Celtic deities.

They were once known as &quot;Eldune&quot;, derived from the 12th-century Simeon of Durham who referred to them as . The final part of the word is Old English &quot;dun&quot;, meaning a rounded hill, while the first part has been variously etymologized as Brittonic &quot;eil&quot; (referring to a fenced enclosure) or Old English &quot;ǣled&quot; (&quot;fire&quot;) or &quot;ǣlǣte&quot; (&quot;empty place&quot;).

==In folklore and media==
Eildon is said to be a &quot;hollow hill&quot;, and is mentioned in the legend of Thomas the Rhymer. Some believe Thomas went under the hill itself, and certainly part of the ballad occurs in the vicinity. Sir Walter Scott tells the tale of a horse dealer who is paid in &quot;ancient coin&quot; by an elderly buyer in old-fashioned dress and taken inside the hill at night. A host of armed knights lie asleep at their horses&#x27; feet; their sleeping leader is King Arthur. Shown a horn and a sword, in confusion the dealer blows the horn: the men begin to awake and a loud voice indicates that he has been proved a coward for not seizing the sword first. A whirlwind ejects him from the chamber and outside he tells his story to some shepherds before dropping dead of exhaustion. Scott identifies the elderly man as Thomas the Rhymer. Another legend concerns the Eildon Tree Stone, a large moss-covered boulder near Melrose, marking the spot where the Fairy Queen led Thomas into her realms in the heart of the hills.

The volcanic rock was said to have been cleft in three by the wizard Michael Scot, as relayed by Walter Scott in his 1805 poem, &quot;The Lay of the Last Minstrel&quot;:

In these far climes it was my lotTo meet the wondrous Michael Scott,A wizard, of such dreaded fame,
Than when, in Salmanca&#x27;s cave,Him listed his magic wand to wave,The bells would ring in Notre Dame!Some of his skill he taught to me;And Warrior, I could say to theeThe words that cleft Eildon hills in three,And bridled the Tweed with a curb of stone:But to speak them were a deadly sin.

James Hogg retold the legend in his 1823 novel &quot;The Three Perils of Man&quot;.

The hill was cited in the lyric of the song &quot;Eiledon&quot;, from Big Country&#x27;s &quot;The Seer&quot; album.

<doc id="866161" wikidata="Q1349705" url="?curid=866161" title="Great Ormond Street Hospital">
<text>Great Ormond Street Hospital (informally GOSH, formerly the Hospital for Sick Children) is a children&#x27;s hospital located in the Bloomsbury area of the London Borough of Camden, and a part of Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust.

The hospital is the largest centre for child heart surgery in Britain and one of the largest centres for heart transplantation in the world. In 1962 it developed the first heart and lung bypass machine for children. With children&#x27;s book author Roald Dahl, it developed an improved shunt valve for children with hydrocephalus, and non-invasive (percutaneous) heart valve replacements. Great Ormond Street performed the first UK clinical trials of the rubella vaccine, and the first bone marrow transplant and gene therapy for severe combined immunodeficiency.

The hospital is the largest centre for research and postgraduate teaching in children&#x27;s health in Europe.

In 1929, J. M. Barrie donated the copyright to &quot;Peter Pan&quot; to the hospital.

==History==
===Origins===

The Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street was founded on 14 February 1852 after a long campaign by Dr Charles West, and was the first hospital in England to provide in-patient beds specifically for children.

Despite opening with just 10 beds, it grew into one of the world&#x27;s leading children&#x27;s hospitals through the patronage of Queen Victoria, counting Charles Dickens, a personal friend of the Chief Physician Dr West, as one of its first fundraisers. The Nurses League was formed in February 1937.

===Nationalisation===
Great Ormond Street Hospital was nationalised in 1948, becoming part of the National Health Service. During the early years of the NHS, private fundraising for the hospital was heavily restricted, though the hospital was permitted to continue to receive pre-existing legacies.

Audrey Callaghan, wife of James Callaghan (prime minister of the United Kingdom from 1976 to 1979), served the hospital as Chairman of the Board of Governors from 1968 to 1972 and then as Chairman of the Special Trustees from 1983 until her final retirement in 1990. Diana, Princess of Wales, served as president of the hospital from 1989 until her death. A plaque at the entrance of the hospital commemorates her services.

===1990s===
The Charles West School of Nursing transferred from Great Ormond Street to London South Bank University in 1995.

===2000s===
In 2002 Great Ormond Street Hospital commenced a redevelopment programme which is budgeted at £343 million and the next phase of which was scheduled to be complete by the end of 2016. In July 2012, Great Ormond Street Hospital was featured in the opening ceremony of the London Summer Olympics.

In 2017 Great Ormond Street Hospital was subject to international attention regarding the Charlie Gard treatment controversy.

==Archives==
The hospital&#x27;s archives are available for research under the terms of the Public Records Act 1958 and a catalogue is available on request. Admission records from 1852 to 1914 have been made available online on the Historic Hospital Admission Records Project.

==St Christopher&#x27;s Chapel==
St Christopher&#x27;s Chapel is a chapel decorated in the Byzantine style and Grade II* listed building located in the Variety Club Building of the hospital. Designed by Edward Middleton Barry (son of the architect Sir Charles Barry who designed the Houses of Parliament) and built in 1875, it is dedicated to the memory of Caroline Barry, Edward Middleton&#x27;s sister-in-law. William Henry Barry, Caroline&#x27;s widower, provided the £40,000 required to build the chapel and a stipend for the chaplain. It was built in &quot;elaborate Franco-Italianate style&quot;. As the chapel exists to provide pastoral care to ill children and their families, many of its details refer to childhood. The stained glass depicts the Nativity, the childhood of Christ and biblical scenes related to children. The dome depicts a pelican pecking at her breast in order to feed her young with drops of her own blood, a traditional symbol of Christ&#x27;s sacrifice for humanity.

When the old hospital was being demolished in the late 1980s, the chapel was moved to its present location via a &quot;concrete raft&quot; to prevent any damage en route. The stained glass and furniture were temporarily removed for restoration and repair. It was reopened along with the new Variety Club Building on 14 February 1994 by Diana, Princess of Wales, then president of the hospital.

=== &quot;Peter Pan&quot; ===
In April 1929 J. M. Barrie gave the copyright to his &quot;Peter Pan&quot; works to the hospital, with the request that the income from this source not be disclosed. This gave the institution control of the rights to these works, and entitled it to royalties from any performance or publication of the play and derivative works. Innumerable performances of the play and its various adaptations have been staged, several theatrical and television adaptations have also been produced, and numerous editions of the novel have been published, all under licence from the hospital. The hospital&#x27;s trustees further commissioned a sequel novel, &quot;Peter Pan in Scarlet&quot;, written by Geraldine McCaughrean and published in 2006.

After the copyright first expired in the UK at the end of 1987 – 50 years after Barrie&#x27;s death – the government&#x27;s Copyright, Designs and Patents Act of 1988 granted the hospital a perpetual right to collect royalties for public performances and commercial publication of the work within the UK. This did not grant the hospital full copyright control over the work, however. When British copyright terms were later extended to the author&#x27;s life plus &quot;70&quot; years by a European Union directive in 1996, Great Ormond Street revived its full copyright claim on the work. After the copyright expired again in 2007, the terms of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act again applied.

==Great Ormond Street Hospital Children&#x27;s Charity==
The hospital has relied on charitable support since it first opened. One of the main sources for this support is Great Ormond Street Hospital Children&#x27;s Charity. Whilst the NHS meets the day-to-day running costs of the hospital, the fundraising income allows Great Ormond Street Hospital to remain at the forefront of child healthcare. The charity aims to raise over £50 million every year to complete the next two phases of redevelopment, as well as provide substantially more fundraising directly for research. The charity also purchases up-to-date equipment, and provides accommodation for families and staff.

Great Ormond Street Hospital Children&#x27;s Charity was one of the charities that benefited from the national Jeans for Genes campaign, which encourages people across Britain to wear their jeans and make a donation to help children affected by genetic disorders. All Great Ormond Street Hospital Charity&#x27;s proceeds from the campaign went to its research partner, the UCL Institute of Child Health.

On 6 August 2009, Arsenal F.C. confirmed that Great Ormond Street Hospital Children&#x27;s Charity was to be their &quot;charity of the season&quot; for the 2009–10 season. They raised over £800,000 for a new lung function unit at the hospital.

Two charity singles have been released in aid of the hospital. In 1987, &quot;The Wishing Well&quot;, recorded by an ensemble line-up including Boy George, Peter Cox and Dollar amongst others became a top 30 hit. In 2009, &quot;The X Factor&quot; finalists covered Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; in aid of the charity, reaching No.1 in the UK Charts.

On 30 March 2010, Channel 4 staged the first &quot;Channel 4&#x27;s Comedy Gala&quot; at the O2 Arena in London, in aid of the charity. The event has been repeated every year since, raising money for Great Ormond Street Hospital Children&#x27;s Charity each time.

In 2011, Daniel Boys recorded a charity single called &quot;The World Is Something You Can Imagine&quot;. It was also released as with proceeds going to the Disney Appeal at Great Ormond Street Hospital.

In 2018, celebrity supergroup The Celebs formed at Metropolis Studios to record an original Christmas song called &quot;Rock With Rudolph&quot;, written and produced by Grahame and Jack Corbyn. The song was in aid of Great Ormond Street Hospital. It was released digitally through independent record label Saga Entertainment in November 2018. The music video debuted exclusively with &quot;The Sun&quot; on 29 November 2018 and had its first TV showing on &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; on 30 November 2018. The song peaked at number two on the iTunes pop chart.

== Controversies ==

=== Peter Pan copyright ===

At various times, Great Ormond Street has been involved in legal disputes in the United States, where the copyright term is based on date of publication, putting the 1911 novel in the public domain since the 1960s. The hospital asserted that the play, first published in 1928, was still under copyright in the US until the end of 2023.

=== Gender identity ===

In January 2024 it was revealed that proposed gender service &quot;has been hit by revolt before it has opened after several experts quit over apparent concerns with staff training&quot; and that &quot;The resignations included experts who believed the training materials were not following the independent recommendations made by Dr Hilary Cass, former president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. Namely, that the service should provide an &quot;exploratory&quot; rather than &quot;affirmative&quot; approach to the child&#x27;s health&quot;. Some clinicians working on the new training materials and who did not resign are understood to have felt it important to affirm a patient’s gender identity and know that patients benefit from medication. This recommendation has also been criticised, due to ethical concerns around the nature of an &quot;exploratory&quot; approach. Specifically, that it will result in biased clinicians carrying out conversion therapy.

On 1 April 2024, despite opposition, the new Children and Young People&#x27;s Gender Service began delivering for children and young people experiencing gender related distress.

Despite resistance to the service, the hospital has assured the public that their aim &quot;is to develop a robust training and education programme that is underpinned by the latest evidence that can enable clinicians and support staff to deliver the very best care for the children and young people who urgently need this new service&quot; 

In March 2024 NHS England confirmed children attending the regional centres will no longer receive puberty blockers and will be supported in line with the recommendations made by Dr Hilary Cass by &quot;resulting in a holistic approach to care&quot;. One of the last acts of government in 2024 was to bring in an emergency ban on puberty blockers.

=== Fundraising ===

The hospital&#x27;s charity faced an investigation by the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office over potential breaches of data protection law in February 2017. The Great Ormond Street Hospital Charity was fined &quot;£11,000 for sharing 910,283 records with other charities, sending on average 795,000 records per month to a wealth screening company and using email and birthdays to find out extra information about more than 311,000 supporters&quot;.

In 2024 Fundraisers working on behalf of Great Ormond Street Hospital Children&#x27;s Charity have found themselves embroiled in controversy due to allegations of employing &quot;pressure-selling techniques&quot;. These door-to-door fundraisers have been accused of coercing people into signing up for donations. An undercover investigation exposed some concerning practices such as:

*Psychological manipulation: Fundraisers were taught to use &quot;psychological motivators&quot; and anticipate objections when interacting with potential donors at their doorsteps. This included tactics to encourage regular monthly donations via direct debit, allowing the hospital to better plan its budget.
*Emotional manipulation: One senior fundraiser even claimed the ability to cry on demand to evoke sympathy from potential donors.
*Hard-sell tactics: Trainees were armed with an array of hard-sell techniques designed to overcome any objections raised by potential donors.

=== Other ===
Great Ormond Street Hospital was involved in a scandal regarding the removal of live tissue and organs from children during surgery and onward sale to pharmaceutical companies without the knowledge of parents in 2001.

In January 2014, it was revealed that as a result of an accidental injection of glue into her brain, Maisha Najeeb brought a claim for compensation against the Great Ormond Street Hospital leading to a payment of up to £24million.

The hospital&#x27;s charity faced an investigation by the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office over potential breaches of data protection law in February 2017. The Great Ormond Street Hospital Charity was fined &quot;£11,000 for sharing 910,283 records with other charities, sending on average 795,000 records per month to a wealth screening company and using email and birthdays to find out extra information about more than 311,000 supporters&quot;.

In April 2018, it was revealed children were put at risk by being given potentially dangerous drugs.

In April 2019, following an inquiry into the death of Amy Allan, the coroner criticised the hospital for not providing a proper plan for the teenager&#x27;s recovery after surgery.

In 2019 the Great Ormond Street mortuary manager made the senior leadership aware of staffing issues. &quot;Since April 2019 GOSH mortuary has been very short staffed but somehow we have managed to keep our standards up, get through a HTA inspection and still give 100% care to our patients whilst having 50% staff. Patient first and always&quot;.

The former Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, urged Great Ormond Street Hospital to examine a possible fundamental cultural problem amid claims it prioritizes reputation over patient care in March 2020.

In March 2020, the BBC conducted an investigation into the death of a child and revealed that at least six children had died of invasive aspergillosis at Great Ormond Street since 2016.

Several leaked emails from the head of Great Ormond Street Hospital, released in November 2020, suggested that the hospital had become accustomed to some &quot;bad behaviours&quot; and that more needed to be done to ensure staff feel safe.

In June 2021, the mother of a baby questioned why action was not taken sooner for her son who died at Great Ormond Street Hospital.

Great Ormond Street Hospital entered into an agreement with Sensyne, an AI company, in September 2021. The hospital received 1,428,571 shares in the company in exchange for patient data. Sensyne has since been delisted from the London Stock Exchange leading to a loss to the hospital of around £2 million.

Following a lawsuit against Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, a family received up to £7 million after the boy was left disabled, in July 2022.

In February 2023, the mother of a sick child with cancer was shocked after hearing Great Ormond Street hospital workers making jokes about his likely death.

In March 2023, it was revealed trainee dentist doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust were going unsupervised.

In May 2023, newspapers highlighted the case of Ryan, left unattended in a lift by a Great Ormond Street hospital worker. His mother Catherine suffered a stress-induced seizure as she fell down the stairs and broke several bones after learning what happened to her son. Ryan was found again after someone needed to use the trolley he was in, around 11 hours later. A spokesperson from the hospital said that there was a situation on the day of Ryan’s arrival and that they had half the number of staff that were due to be on duty.

Hospital cleaners have made allegations of institutional racism at Great Ormond Street Hospital in March 2023. Hospital cleaners from minority ethnic groups say they were denied NHS contracts and paid less than white NHS employees. A court hearing was concluded in 2023. Each cleaner could receive between £80,000 and £190,000 if the claims are successful.

In August 2023 it was revealed a child began to experience lung complications with an invasive aspergillosis infection which led to his death.

In 2024 it was revealed that hundreds of children at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) have suffered life-altering injuries, including amputations, permanent deformities, and chronic pain, following their treatment by the consultant orthopedic surgeon Yaser Jabbar.

== Patients-led assessments ==

===Food quality===

In 2013 a survey of more than 1,300 health units revealed Great Ormond Street Hospital had the second worst score in London and the 13th lowest score overall. The hospital that treats some of the country&#x27;s most severely ill children and teenagers said it was surprised by the results of the first patient-led assessment of non-clinical issues. According to a hospital spokeswoman, the food quality has now improved &quot;after extensive taste testing.&quot;

In 2023 a new patient-led assessment released by NHS Digital revealed Great Ormond Street Hospital was still ranked amongst the worst hospitals in UK with the 40th lowest score overall. As part of the assessment of food provision, assessors were asked questions regarding the choice of food offered, the availability of food 24 hours a day, meal times, and menu accessibility. A ward-level assessment of the food was also conducted, including an assessment of taste, texture, and serving temperature.

===Cleanliness===

in 2023 the patients-led assessment data released by NHS Digital also revealed Great Ormond Street Hospital was the third worst hospital in UK for cleanliness.

<text>U.S. Highway 55 was a north–south United States highway. Though it was part of the original 1926 numbering plan, it was deleted within 10 years.

==Route description==
From its southern terminus in Davenport, Iowa, U.S. Highway 55 initially followed the route of present-day U.S. Highway 52 through Hampton, Minnesota excepting for later local improvements such as the Rochester and Decorah bypasses. It was deleted 90 years ago.

North of Hampton, Minnesota, U.S. Highway 55 headed north and west to downtown Minneapolis. Within the village of Hampton, Minnesota, U.S. Highway 55 followed along Main Street and present-day Minnesota Highway 50 to Farmington. Within Farmington, the highway had a shared segment with what was then U.S. Highway 65 (now Minnesota Highway 3) to Elm Street in Hampton.

From Farmington, U.S. Highway 55 headed westward to Burnsville via present-day 212th Street West, Lakeville Blvd, 210th Street West, Kenwood Trail, and Burnsville Parkway to Lyndale Ave (now Interstate 35W). Following the decommissioning of U.S. Highway 55, the portion of the route between Farmington and Burnsville was subsequently designated as a portion of Minnesota Highway 50, and transferred to County control in 1994 as Dakota County Road 50. From Burnsville, U.S. Highway 55 again turned northwards, following Lyndale Avenue across the Minnesota River and into Downtown Minneapolis via Lyndale Avenue, Lake Street, and 3rd Avenue.

==History==
When the route was designated in 1926, its northern terminus was in Minneapolis at an intersection with U.S. Highway 12, near the Mississippi River. Its southern terminus was in Dubuque, Iowa, at an intersection with U.S. Highway 61 (or possibly U.S. Highway 20). In 1932, US 55 was extended south to Davenport, Iowa, to another intersection with US 61. While US 61 followed a more direct route from Dubuque to Davenport, the new US 55 extension followed the western shore of the Mississippi River.

Just two years later, in 1934, US 55 was deleted entirely. U.S. Highway 67 was extended through Davenport to Dubuque, absorbing the 1932 extension of US 55. The northern half of this stretch was co-signed with an extension of U.S. Highway 52, which took over the US 55 designation to Hampton, Minnesota. From Hampton, US 52 was routed to Saint Paul via Minnesota Highway 56 to Inver Grove Heights and Robert Street into downtown Saint Paul. The remainder of U.S. Highway 55 north and west of Hampton was designated as U.S. Highway 65. The prior routing of U.S. Highway 65 into from Farmington to Saint Paul was redesignated as U.S. Highway 218 for one year, and subsequently redesignated as Minnesota Highway 218, and later as Minnesota Highway 3.

The number &quot;55&quot; was later proposed for the route which would become U.S. Highway 56.

<doc id="866165" wikidata="Q2624994" url="?curid=866165" title="Colin Pitchfork">
<text>Colin Pitchfork (born 23 March 1960) is an English child-murderer and child-rapist. He was the first person convicted of rape and murder using DNA profiling after he murdered two girls in neighbouring Leicestershire villages: Lynda Mann in Narborough in November 1983 and Dawn Ashworth in Enderby in July 1986. He was arrested on 19 September 1987 and sentenced to life imprisonment on 22 January 1988 after pleading guilty to both murders. The sentencing judge gave him a 30-year minimum term (reduced to 28 years on appeal). 

He was granted parole in June 2021 and released on licence on 1 September that year. On 19 November the same year, he was recalled to prison for breaching his licence conditions. Pitchfork was granted parole a second time in June 2023, but after intervention from the Lord Chancellor Alex Chalk, the Parole Board reviewed its decision and decided not to release him.

==Life==
Pitchfork lived at 6 Brascote Lane in Newbold Verdon, attending school in Market Bosworth and Bosworth College in Desford. He was in the 1st Newbold Verdon Scout Group, gaining the Chief Scout&#x27;s Award in September 1976. He was one of four scouts chosen in Leicestershire to go to the 14th World Scout Jamboree in Norway in August 1975, amongst 1,600 scouts from the UK. Molly Pitchfork, his mother, was the Group Scout Leader.

He married a social worker in 1981 and moved to the Leicestershire village of Littlethorpe. Before his marriage, Pitchfork had been convicted of indecent exposure and had been referred for therapy to the Carlton Hayes Hospital, Narborough.

Pitchfork had obtained work in Hampshire&#x27;s Bakery in Leicester, in 1976, as an apprentice. He continued to work there until his arrest for the murders. He became particularly skilled as a sculptor of cake decorations and had hoped, eventually, to start his own cake decorating business. According to his supervisor, he was &quot;a good worker and time-keeper, but he was moody... and he couldn&#x27;t leave women employees alone. He was always chatting them up.&quot;

== Crimes ==
In October 1977, he was fined £30 by Market Bosworth magistrates for exposing himself to a schoolgirl, pleading guilty, when aged 17.

In 1979, Pitchfork forced a 16-year-old girl into a field and sexually assaulted her.

On 14 February 1980, when aged 20, he exposed himself to two teenage girls in Earl Shilton, and was given a year&#x27;s probation by Hinckley magistrates.

On 21 November 1983, 15-year-old Lynda Mann took a shortcut on her way home from babysitting instead of taking her normal route home. She did not return and her parents and neighbours spent the night searching for her. The next morning, she was found raped and strangled on a deserted footpath known locally as the Black Pad. Using forensic science techniques available at the time, police linked a semen sample taken from her body to a person with type A blood and an enzyme profile that matched only 10% of males. With no other leads or evidence, the case was left open.

In October 1985, Pitchfork sexually assaulted another 16-year-old girl, threatening her with a screwdriver and with a knife at her throat. 

Liz Knight was picked up by Pitchfork on a Saturday in June 1986 and driven for 40 minutes from Wigston towards Great Glen. When she grabbed the steering wheel, Pitchfork&#x27;s demeanour suddenly changed, and he decided to drive to her house, and not attack. Pitchfork put his hand on her knee, saying: &quot;I haven&#x27;t hurt you yet.&quot; Pitchfork dropped Knight at her house, asking, &quot;How about a goodnight kiss?&quot; which she refused. Pitchfork said, &quot;I bet you would never accept a lift from a stranger again.&quot;

On 31 July 1986, 15-year-old Dawn Ashworth left her home to visit a friend&#x27;s house. Her parents expected her to return at 9:30 pm; when she failed to do so they called police to report her missing. Two days later, her body was found in a wooded area near a footpath called Ten Pound Lane. She had been beaten, savagely raped, and strangled. The &quot;modus operandi&quot; matched that of the first attack, and semen samples revealed the same blood type. Both girls had attended Brockington High School. Dawn&#x27;s mother worked at Next plc in Enderby; George Davies offered a £10,000 reward.

An initial suspect was Richard Buckland, a local 17-year-old with learning difficulties who, while innocent of both murders, revealed knowledge of Ashworth&#x27;s body and admitted to the Ashworth crime under questioning, denying the first murder.

===Arrest and conviction===
In early 1987, police asked every local male between the ages of 16 and 34 to voluntarily give blood samples for DNA testing. By the end of January, a thousand men had been tested. Men who declined to give blood samples found themselves under scrutiny by police.
According to 1988 news reports, one of Pitchfork&#x27;s colleagues at the bakery, 23-year-old Ian Kelly, who lived outside the area under investigation, was overheard in a pub discussing how he had provided a blood sample for Pitchfork, by using a fake passport to masquerade as Pitchfork. He had agreed to do this in exchange for £200, and taken the test on 29 January 1987. The conversation, during the lunchtime of Saturday, 1 August 1987, was overheard by other bakery colleagues, and 28-year-old Jackie Foggin (), of Fleckney, reported it to the police. This vital tip-off was later credited with enabling Pitchfork to be caught. Pitchfork had told Kelly that he wanted to avoid being harassed by police because of his prior convictions for indecent exposure. Kelly was arrested at 31 Stuart Street in Leicester on Friday, 18 September.

On Saturday, 19 September 1987, Pitchfork was arrested at 32 Haybarn Close, in Littlethorpe, by Detective Inspector Mick Thomas. Pitchfork&#x27;s wife tried to attack him, when he told her that he had killed two girls.

During questioning, Pitchfork admitted to exposing himself to more than 1,000 women, a compulsion that began in his early teens. He later progressed to sexual assault and then to strangling his victims. Pitchfork said this was in order to protect his identity. Investigators rejected this, viewing the motivation for the strangulations as &quot;perverted sadism&quot;. During his interviews with the police he admitted his crimes, but lied about the level and nature of the violence he had inflicted on his victims. 

At his trial at Leicester Crown Court, Pitchfork pleaded guilty to the two rapes and murders, in addition to sexual assault of two other girls, and conspiring to pervert the course of justice. In January 1988 he was sentenced to life imprisonment for the two murders and 10 years for raping the victims; he was also sentenced to three years for each count of sexual assault and three years for perverting the course of justice, with all sentences to run concurrently. A psychiatric report prepared for the court described Pitchfork as possessing a psychopathic personality disorder accompanied with a serious psychosexual pathology. The Lord Chief Justice at the time of his sentencing said: &quot;From the point of view of the safety of the public I doubt if he should ever be released.&quot; The Secretary of State set a minimum term of 30 years; in 2009, Pitchfork&#x27;s minimum term sentence was reduced on appeal to 28 years.

==Parole reviews==
On 22 April 2016, the Parole Board for England and Wales heard Pitchfork&#x27;s case for early release on parole. Pitchfork&#x27;s advocates presented evidence of his improved character, noting that Pitchfork had furthered his education to degree level and had become expert at the transcription of printed music into braille, for the benefit of blind people. The families of victims Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth opposed his release on parole.

On 29 April 2016, the board announced that Pitchfork&#x27;s application for release on licence had been refused, but recommended that he be moved to an open prison. In June 2016, Michael Gove, then Justice Secretary, agreed with the board&#x27;s recommendation, and at some point prior to 8 January 2017, Pitchfork was moved to an undisclosed open prison.

In November 2017, Pitchfork was seen walking around Bristol, so it was assumed that he had been moved to HM Prison Leyhill in Gloucestershire.

On 3 May 2018, Pitchfork was refused release on licence. The Parole Board said Pitchfork would be eligible for a further review within two years. Lynda&#x27;s mother said the board had &quot;listened to us before the murderer&quot;. In 2017, it emerged Pitchfork would be released from open prison on unsupervised days out.

===2021: release and recall===
On 7 June 2021, Pitchfork was granted release on conditional licence. The Secretary of State for Justice, Robert Buckland, applied for a review of the decision under the terms of the Parole Board Reconsideration Mechanism, introduced in 2019, and Pitchfork remained in custody pending the outcome. On 13 July 2021, it was reported that the review had been refused and that Pitchfork would therefore be released. He was released on 1 September 2021.

In November 2021, Pitchfork was recalled to prison for breaching his licence conditions by &quot;approaching young women&quot; while on walks from his bail hostel. His second victim&#x27;s mother, Barbara Ashworth, told BBC News that she was pleased &quot;he&#x27;s been put away and women and girls are safe and protected from him now&quot;. There are complaints that the Parole Board was insufficiently cautious in allowing Pitchfork&#x27;s release. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab promised a Parole Board review. David Baker, a former police detective who helped capture Pitchfork, believes Pitchfork could deceive the Parole Board and pretend it was safe to release him. Baker maintains Pitchfork is a psychopath and it will never be safe to release him.

===2023: consideration for release===
The Parole Board&#x27;s hearing to consider releasing Pitchfork again was postponed to 2023. His potential release was opposed by MP Alberto Costa.

In June 2023 it was announced that Pitchfork would again be released under parole. The decision was widely criticised. In July 2023, the Lord Chancellor intervened and ordered that the board reconsider their decision after a huge public outcry, particularly since Pitchfork breached his licence conditions within weeks of his initial release. Pitchfork&#x27;s new parole hearing took place on 2 and 3 October 2023. In December 2023, parole was denied, meaning that Pitchfork would remain in prison.

===2024 review===
Pitchfork challenged the Parole Board&#x27;s decision on procedural grounds, and in February 2024 the Board agreed to schedule another hearing before a different panel to consider his potential release. On 16 May 2024, the Parole Board Chair, Caroline Corby, reversed an earlier decision that Pitchfork&#x27;s parole hearing should be held behind closed doors; the next hearing was broadcast due to public interest. There will be a preliminary hearing behind closed doors to address &quot;practical matters&quot;.

==Artwork==
In April 2009, a sculpture that Pitchfork had created in prison and which was exhibited at the Royal Festival Hall, &quot;Bringing the Music to Life&quot;, depicted an orchestra and choir. The sculpture was exhibited as part of a venture by the Koestler Trust, having been purchased by the Festival Hall for £600. Following outrage in the media and from victim-advocate groups, it was removed from display.

==In popular culture==
Pitchfork’s crimes were originally chronicled in the 1989 book &quot;The Blooding&quot; by Joseph Wambaugh. 

Pitchfork&#x27;s crimes were aired on the American true crime series &quot;Forensic Files&quot; in October 1996.

The killings featured in a 2002 episode of &quot;Real Crime&quot; &quot;Cracking the Killer&#x27;s Code&quot;. Pitchfork was played by John Duttine.

In 2014, ITV commissioned a two-part television drama, &quot;Code of a Killer&quot;, based on Pitchfork&#x27;s crimes and the creation of DNA profiling. It starred John Simm as researcher Alec Jeffreys and David Threlfall as David Baker, the lead police detective. Pitchfork was played by Nathan Wright. The drama was the first broadcast in two 90-minute episodes, on 6 and 13 April 2015. It was subsequently reformatted as three episodes and released on DVD.

Pitchfork&#x27;s crimes are also the focus of an episode of the Sky series &quot;How I Caught the Killer&quot;.

<text>The Ukrainian Evangelical Baptist Convention of Canada is a Baptist Christian denomination composed of Ukrainian-speaking congregations in Canada.

==History==
Ukrainian Baptists became established in Canada early in the 20th century from two independent sources. A group of Ukrainian immigrant families laid down the foundation and established the first Ukrainian Baptist church in Canada, electing Rev. Ivan Shakotko to be the pastor in Winnipeg in 1903. Around the turn of the 20th century, English-speaking Baptists sent a missionary to labour among the growing Ukrainian population in western Canada. From this work, a church was organized in Overstone, Manitoba in 1904. Around this same time, Baptist work among Ukrainian Canadians was started in Toronto, and in Saskatchewan. John Kolesnikoff, a missionary, moved to Canada from eastern Ukraine in 1907. These churches were successful in attracting Mennonite, &quot;Shtundist&quot;, and Eastern Orthodox emigrants from Imperial Russia. The first annual conference of Ukrainian Baptists in Canada was organized by Rev. Shakotko and Rev. Kolesnikoff in Canora, Saskatchewan in 1908. It was originally called the &quot;Russian-Galician Evangelical Convention&quot; and gradually changed to &quot;Russian-Ukrainian&quot; as the name Ukrainian was popularized. For a number of years afterwards the body operated as the &quot;Federation of Ukrainian Baptist Churches in Canada&quot;. In 1961, they incorporated under the current name.

<text>Walden&#x27;s hornbill (Rhabdotorrhinus waldeni) locally called dulungan, also known as the Visayan wrinkled hornbill, rufous-headed hornbill or writhe-billed hornbill, is a critically endangered species of hornbill living in the rainforests on the islands of Negros and Panay in the Philippines. It is closely related to the writhed hornbill, but can be recognized by the yellow throat and ocular skin in the male, and the blue throat and ocular skin in the female (both throat and ocular skin are deep orange or red in both sexes of the writhed hornbill). Its binomial name commemorates the Scottish ornithologist Viscount Walden.

It is considered one of the Western Visayas Big 5 which includes the Negros bleeding-heart pigeon, Visayan spotted deer, Visayan hornbill and the Visayan warty pig.

== Description and taxonomy ==
EBird describes the bird as &quot;A large rare bird of lowland and foothill forest on Panay and Negros, although almost extinct on the latter. Mostly black with a cream-colored tail with black terminal band, an orange casque, and a wrinkled lower bill. Male has a rufous head, a yellow pouch, and yellow around the eye. Female has a black neck and head, a smaller bill and casque, and blue and yellow around the eye and on the chin. The only other hornbill in range is the Visayan hornbill but the Writhe-billed is larger, with a pale bill. Voice includes a three-noted throaty chuckle..&quot;

They exhibit sexual dimorphism with the males having a rufous head and yellow facial skin while the females having a black head and blue facial skin and a smaller bill.
Believed to form a closely related species group with the Wrinkled hornbill, Writhed hornbill and Knobbed hornbill. 

Formerly considered conspecific with the Writhed hornbill but has clear differences in voice and plummage. Male Walden&#x27;s hornbills are rufous red in comparison to the cream colored Writhed males. Walden&#x27;s females have blue facial skin in comparison to the red of Writhed.

This species is monotypic.

== Habitat ==

It inhabits closed-canopy forests, also frequenting logged areas and occasionally isolated trees in clearings at an altitudinal range of 400 to 1,200 m Panay and 350 to 950 m in Negros. It prefers areas abundant fruit-bearing trees for feeding and large trees for nesting. They are known to live in small and noisy flocks. The Walden&#x27;s hornbills are cavity nesters and use natural or carved-out hollows in tree trunks for its nest. As other hornbills, they reproduce very slowly. As lack of appropriate nesting sites is a problem, nest boxes are being attached to tree trunks in certain reserves.

== Ecology and behavior ==
Diet

They are primarily frugivorous eating figs and berries but they are also known to eat insects, lizards and other small animals. Usually encountered in small flocks but larger flocks of 25 to 30 birds have been sighted. It may make local nomadic movements in response to food availability.

Breeding

All hornbills are monogamous and mate for life.They are cavity nesters and rely on large dipterocarp trees for breeding. The female seals itself within the tree cavity and the male is in charge of gathering food for its mate and chicks. The male stores food in a gular pouch and regurgitates it to feed its mate and chicks. Cooperative breeding wherein immature birds from previous seasons help out in feeding the female and chick have not been observed with this species so far. Among Philippine hornbills, it has only been recorded with the Rufous hornbill.

Based on interviews with poachers, nests in May to July. Nests in large dipterocarp trees such as Shorea polysperma. Clutch size is typically 2 eggs but cases of 3 eggs documented.

== Conservation status ==
This is a critically endangered species, one of the three critically endangered hornbills including the Sulu hornbill and Helmeted hornbill. It is presumed extinct on Guimaras and now survives only on Negros and Panay The total population has been estimated at less than 160, though recent work from the Central Panay Mountain Range suggests 600-700 pairs may remain there. No recent figures are available for Negros, where it may be functionally extinct. The IUCN Red List estimates the population to be 1,000 to 2,499 mature individuals with the population continuing to decline. 

Walden&#x27;s hornbill reproduce very slowly and thus are unable to survive high hunting pressures coupled with heavy logging of the rainforests. By 2007, Negros and Panay had a 3% and 6% remaining forest cover with most of this being higher elevation forest where this bird does not thrive in. Despite already paltry forest cover, deforestation still continues thanks to both legal and illegal logging, conversion into farmland, mining and road development. As for the case of the Northwest Panay Peninsula Natural Park, a road was built splitting it from the Central Panay Mountain Range and has severely affected the population in the former as these roads allow for easier access by hunters and loggers.

Another huge threat is hunting and capture for the illegal wildlife trade. According to the Philippine Initiative for Environmental Conservation (Philincon), up to 50% of all nests in Central Panay Mountain Range were affected by poachers who would either climb up or cut down the nesting trees to poach the nestlings and the mother.

Due to this high poaching rate, Philincon has devised a nest guarding program where they pay locals US$20 a month to guard hornbill nests and offer an incentive of US$11 for each successful fledge. This program has been effective cutting down the poaching rate to just 5%. Philincon now guards more than 1,000 nest holes which is believed to be at least two-thirds of all nests in the Central Panay Mountain Range. In areas where their large nesting trees have been logged, Philincon installs nest boxes for these hornbills to breed in. 

The bird is listed as an EDGE species by the Zoological Society of London where it is ranked as the 50th which uses the basis of evolutionary distinctness and endangeredness.

This bird was bred in captivity for the first time by the Mari-it Wildlife and Conservation Park in 2005. As of 2010, they have bred 15 Walden&#x27;s hornbills. 
In 2019, The Talarak Foundation has also successfully bred them in captivity in their Negros facility after nine years of attempts.

Further conservation actions proposed are: more funding should be allocated primarily to in situ protection along the lines of PhilCon&#x27;s guarding scheme; conduct further surveys, particularly on Panay to identify important sites and use this data to decide further actions; continue community awareness programmes to reduce hunting and illegal logging on both Negros and Panay; work in partnership at the government level to strengthen protected area legislation and improve the network in the long term; and support the development of captive breeding and reintroduction programmes.

<text>Buckhead is the commercial and residential district of the city of Atlanta, Georgia, comprising approximately the northernmost fifth of the city. Buckhead is the third largest business district within the Atlanta city limits, behind Downtown and Midtown, and a major commercial and financial center of the Southern U.S.

Buckhead is anchored by a core of high-rise office buildings, hotels, shopping centers, restaurants and condominiums centered around the intersection of Peachtree Road and Piedmont Road near Georgia State Route 400, the Buckhead MARTA station, and Lenox Square.

==History==
In 1838, Henry Irby purchased 202 1/2 acres surrounding the present intersection of Peachtree, Roswell, and West Paces Ferry roads from Daniel Johnson for $650. Irby subsequently established a general store and tavern at the northwest corner of the intersection. The name &quot;Buckhead&quot; comes from a story that Irby killed a large buck deer and placed the head in a prominent location. Prior to this, the settlement was called Irbyville. By the late 1800s, Buckhead had become a rural vacation spot for wealthy Atlantans. In the 1890s, Buckhead was rechristened Atlanta Heights but by the 1920s it was again &quot;Buckhead&quot;.
Buckhead remained dominated by country estates until after World War I, when many of Atlanta&#x27;s wealthy began building mansions among the area&#x27;s rolling hills. Simultaneously, a number of Black enclaves began popping up in Buckhead, following events like the 1906 Atlanta race riot and the Great Atlanta fire of 1917, which drove black residents from the city center. Predominantly black neighborhoods within Buckhead included Johnsontown, Piney Grove, Savagetown, and Macedonia Park.

Despite the stock market crash of 1929, lavish mansions were still constructed in Buckhead throughout the Great Depression. In 1930, Henry Aaron Alexander built one of the largest homes on Peachtree Road, a house with 33 rooms and 13 bathrooms. During the mid-1940s, Fulton County decided to acquire the land comprising Macedonia Park to build what is now Frankie Allen Park. This process, which entailed both eminent domain and &quot;outright coercion&quot; displaced over 400 families.

During the mid-1940s, Atlanta Mayor William B. Hartsfield sought to annex Buckhead, and a number of other predominantly White suburbs of Atlanta. Fearing that the city&#x27;s &quot;Negro population is growing by leaps and bounds&quot;, and was &quot;taking more white territory inside Atlanta&quot;, Hartsfield sought to annex these communities to counteract the threat of increasing political power for the city&#x27;s Black residents. The annexation of Buckhead was put to a vote in 1947, but it was rejected by Buckhead voters. Atlanta annexed Buckhead and a number of other nearby communities in 1952, following legislation which expanded Atlanta&#x27;s city boundaries.

In 1956, an estate known as Joyeuse was chosen as the site for a major shopping center to be known as Lenox Square. The mall was designed by Joe Amisano, an architect who designed many of Atlanta&#x27;s modernist buildings. When Lenox Square opened in 1959, it was one of the first malls in the country, and the largest shopping center in the Southeastern U.S. Office development soon followed with the construction of Tower Place in 1974.

To reverse a downturn in Buckhead Village during the 1980s, minimum parking spot requirements for bars were lifted, which quickly led to it becoming the most dense concentration of bars and clubs in the Atlanta area. Many bars and clubs catered mostly to the black community in the Atlanta area, including Otto&#x27;s, Cobalt, 112, BAR, World Bar, Lulu&#x27;s Bait Shack, Mako&#x27;s, Tongue &amp; Groove, Chaos, John Harvard&#x27;s Brew House, Paradox, Frequency &amp; Havana Club. The area became renowned as a party spot for Atlanta area rappers and singers, including Outkast, Jazze Pha, Jagged Edge, Usher and Jermaine Dupri, who mentioned the neighborhood&#x27;s clubs on his song &quot;Welcome to Atlanta.&quot;

Following the events of the Ray Lewis murder case in Buckhead on the night of the 2000 Super Bowl (held in Atlanta at the Georgia Dome), as well as a series of murders involving the Black Mafia Family, residents sought to ameliorate crime by taking measures to reduce the community&#x27;s nightlife and re-establish a more residential character. The Buckhead Coalition&#x27;s president and former Atlanta Mayor Sam Massell, along with councilwoman Mary Norwood were instrumental in persuading the Atlanta City Council to pass a local ordinance to close bars at 2:30 AM rather than 4 AM, and liquor licenses were made more difficult to obtain. Eventually, most of the Buckhead Village nightlife district was acquired for the &quot;Buckhead Atlanta&quot; multi-use project, and many of the former bars and clubs were razed in 2007.

===Proposed secession from Atlanta===
In 2008, a newsletter by the Fulton County Taxpayers Foundation began circulating that proposed the secession of Buckhead into its own city after more than 50 years as part of Atlanta. This came on the heels of neighboring Sandy Springs, which finally became a city in late 2005 after a 30-year struggle to incorporate, and which triggered other such incorporations in metro Atlanta&#x27;s northern suburbs. Like those cities, the argument to create a city of Buckhead is based on the desire for more local control and lower taxes.

Discussions revolving around potential secession from Atlanta were revived in late 2021, with proponents of secession arguing that splitting from Atlanta would enable Buckhead to better tackle crime in the area. In Atlanta&#x27;s Police Zone 2, which includes Buckhead, Lenox Park, Piedmont Heights, and West Midtown, murder was up 63% in 2021 compared to the previous year, going from 8 cases to 13. However, in the same period crime overall was down by 6%, and according to police chief Rodney Bryant, Zone 2 had only a fraction of the violent crimes seen in other neighborhoods of Atlanta.

Buckhead, one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in Atlanta, would deprive the city of upwards of 40% of its tax revenue if it seceded. Political scientists and journalists have also highlighted that Buckhead is significantly more conservative and white than the rest of Atlanta. Commentators have also noted that this secession attempt is &quot;more serious&quot; than earlier efforts, due to polling data showing 54% to 70% of Buckhead&#x27;s residents favor the move, and due to pro-secession organizations raising nearly $1,000,000 to promote the split. A referendum did not occur in 2022 or early 2023, as the Georgia General Assembly tabled the bills that would have provided for this referendum during the 2022 legislative session.

During the 2023 session, on April 27, the issue of incorporation was brought to the Georgia State Senate in the form of SB114. The bill prompted a response from governor Brian Kemp on the legality and workability of incorporating Buckhead as a city, but was ultimately rejected 33-23. The against votes consists of all Democrats in the Senate, and ten Republicans who broke rank to join them. Republicans on the for side argued that the citizens of Buckhead were not being represented by their municipal government and that the decision to form their own municipality should be up to the citizens themselves. Additionally, it was noted by the media that there was no Senator from Buckhead in the Senate at the time of the vote. If the bill succeeded, it would have begun the referendum process to secede from Atlanta.

==Geography==
Buckhead was originally the central area now called &quot;Buckhead Village&quot;. The current usage of the term Buckhead roughly covers the interior of the &quot;V&quot; formed by Interstate 85 on the east and Interstate 75 on the west. Buckhead is bordered by Cumberland and Vinings in Cobb County to the northwest, the city of Sandy Springs to the north, Brookhaven and North Druid Hills in DeKalb County to the east, Midtown Atlanta to the south, and West Midtown to the west.

===Neighborhoods===
Buckhead comprises most of the neighborhoods of Atlanta&#x27;s north side, 43 in total.

==Demographics==

Since at least the 1950s, Buckhead has been known as a district of extreme wealth, with the western and northern neighborhoods being virtually unrivaled in the Southeast. In 2011, The Gadberry Group compiled the list of the 50 wealthiest zip codes in the United States, ranking Buckhead&#x27;s western zip code (30327) as the second wealthiest zip code in the South (behind Palm Beach&#x27;s 33480) and the second wealthiest zip code east of California and south of Virginia.

The same group reported the average household income at $280,631, with an average household net worth of $1,353,189. These 2011 figures are up from a similar 2005 study that pegged Buckhead as the wealthiest community in the South and the only settlement south of the Washington D.C. suburb of Great Falls, and east of the Phoenix suburb of Paradise Valley to be among the 50 wealthiest communities in the country. However, according to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, (30327) is the ninth-wealthiest zip code in the nation, with a household income in excess of $341,000.

The &quot;Robb Report&quot; magazine has consistently ranked Buckhead one of the nation&#x27;s &quot;10 Top Affluent Communities&quot; due to &quot;the most beautiful mansions, best shopping, and finest restaurants in the Southeastern United States&quot;. Due to its wealth, Buckhead is sometimes promoted as the &quot;Beverly Hills of the East&quot; or &quot;Beverly Hills of the South&quot; in reference to Beverly Hills, California, an area to which it is often compared.

==Economy==
At the heart of Buckhead around the intersections of Lenox, Peachtree and Piedmont Roads, is a shopping district with more than 1,500 retail units where shoppers spend more than $3 billion a year. In addition, Buckhead contains the highest concentration of upscale boutiques in the United States. The majority are located at Lenox Square and Phipps Plaza, sister regional malls located diagonally across from each other at the intersection of Peachtree and Lenox Roads. The malls are home to designer boutiques, mainstream national retailers, as well as six major department stores. This commercial core also has a concentration of &quot;big-box&quot; retailers. The &quot;Buckhead Atlanta&quot; mixed-use development brought even more exclusive boutiques, restaurants, hotels, condos and office space to the heart of Buckhead in 2014. The name of the project was rebranded as &#x27;Buckhead Atlanta&#x27;.
Buckhead is also a center for healthcare, and is home both to Piedmont Hospital and the private, catastrophic care hospital Shepherd Center which specializes in spinal cord injury and acquired brain injury. The two hospitals are located adjacent to one another along Peachtree Road. (This location is known as &quot;Cardiac Hill&quot; by runners of the annual Peachtree Road Race.)

Buckhead is also the location of a large share of Atlanta&#x27;s diplomatic missions. Consulates in Buckhead include the Consulate-General of Australia and the Australian Trade Commission, the Consulate-General of France and the French Trade Commission, the Consulate-General of Brazil, the Consulate-General of Japan, and the Consulate of Greece.
==Cityscape==

In 1982 the Buckhead Business Association created an official boundary map for Buckhead. The Georgia House of Representatives adopted that boundary, as did the Atlanta Regional Commission.

While much of west and north Buckhead is preserved as single-family homes in forested settings, the Peachtree Road corridor has become a major focus of high-rise construction. The first 400-foot (121 m) office tower, Tower Place, opened in 1974. Park Place, built in 1986, was the first 400+ foot (121+ m) condominium building. 1986 also saw the completion of the 425-foot (129 m), 34-story Atlanta Plaza, then Buckhead&#x27;s tallest and largest building. In 2000, Park Avenue Condominiums pushed the record to 486 feet (148 m).

Since that time, a wave of development has followed. The 660-foot (201 m) Sovereign and 580-foot (177 m) Mandarin Oriental, now renamed the Waldorf-Astoria, were completed in 2008. Many luxury high-rise apartment buildings have been built recently, including the 26-story Post Alexander High Rise in 2014 and the 26-story SkyHouse Buckhead in 2014. Today, Buckhead has over 50 high-rise buildings, almost one-third of the city&#x27;s total.

==Education==

===Elementary and secondary schools===
Public schools in Buckhead are administered by Atlanta Public Schools.

The following public elementary schools serve Buckhead:
*Morris Brandon Elementary School
*Garden Hills Elementary School
*Warren T. Jackson Elementary School
*E. Rivers Elementary School
*Sarah Rawson Smith Elementary School

The area is served by Sutton Middle School and North Atlanta High School.
By 2012, due to overall population increases in Buckhead, many schools became increasingly crowded. Brandon Elementary was at 97% capacity, Garden Hills was at 102% capacity, E. Rivers was at 121% capacity, and Sutton was at 150% capacity. In the round of school zone change proposals in 2012, Ernie Suggs of &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; said that the zones of Buckhead &quot;remained pretty much intact.&quot;

There is an area charter school, Atlanta Classical Academy.

Local private schools include the Atlanta International School, the Atlanta Speech School, Christ the King School, the Atlanta Girls School, The Galloway School, Holy Spirit Preparatory School, Trinity School, The Lovett School, Pace Academy, and The Westminster Schools.

===Colleges and universities===
Georgia State University&#x27;s J. Mack Robinson College of Business&#x27; Buckhead Center is located in the heart of Buckhead. This facility houses Georgia State&#x27;s Executive MBA program. Its &quot;Leadership Speaker Series&quot;, which showcases an agenda of executive officers from prestigious, well-known companies is also hosted at their Buckhead Center.[46]

The University of Georgia&#x27;s Terry College of Business Executive Education Center is located in Buckhead. This facility houses the university&#x27;s executive MBA program and Terry Third Thursday, a lecture series featuring business leaders.

===Public libraries===
There are two branches of the Atlanta-Fulton Public Library System in Buckhead: Northside Branch and Buckhead Branch.

==Transportation==

===Roadways===

The main north–south street of Buckhead is Peachtree Road, which extends south into the heart of the city as Peachtree Street, Atlanta&#x27;s main street. This name change is significant in that it defines a border between Buckhead and Midtown. The main east–west street is Paces Ferry Road, named for a former ferry that used to cross the Chattahoochee River. Hardy Pace, one of Atlanta&#x27;s founders, operated the ferry and owned much of what is now Buckhead. In addition to Peachtree and West Paces Ferry Roads, other arterial roads include Piedmont Road (Georgia 237), Roswell Road (Georgia State Route 9), and Northside Parkway.

===Mass transit===

In the early 1990s, after a bitter fight against GDOT by residents, Buckhead was split in two by Georgia 400, a tolled extension of a freeway connecting I-285 to I-85. However, MARTA&#x27;s Red Line extension was put in the highway&#x27;s median, providing additional mass transit to Buckhead and Sandy Springs.

MARTA operates three stations in Buckhead, the southernmost being Lindbergh Center. Just north of there, the Red and Gold lines split, with the Gold Line&#x27;s Lenox station at the southwest corner of the Lenox Square parking lot, and the Red Line&#x27;s Buckhead station on the west side of the malls where Peachtree crosses 400. A free circulator bus called &quot;the buc&quot; (Buckhead Uptown Connection) stops at all three stations. The proposed extension of the Atlanta Streetcar to Buckhead (nicknamed the &quot;Peachtree Streetcar&quot; because it would run along Peachtree Street in Downtown Atlanta and Peachtree Road in Buckhead) would provide street-level service with frequent stops all the way to downtown Atlanta, complementing the existing subway-type MARTA train service for the area.

===Pedestrians and cycling===
*North Beltline Trail (Under construction)
*Chastain Park Trail
*Mountain To River Trail
*Paces Ferry Trail
*PATH400, which provides a 5.2 mile pathway throughout the heart of Buckhead that connects different trails and parks. PATH400 connects the people of Buckhead to surrounding neighborhoods, offices, and retail locations.

Bike Share&lt;br&gt;
In 2017, the Relay Bike Share program expanded into Buckhead. Three new stations were installed with plans to add more in the future.

==Notable residents==

* Julius Erving, Basketball player, sports and business executive, and golf course manager who moved to Buckhead, Atlanta in 2009 and owns a golf and country club

* Katherine Lee, Delta Air Lines employee known as &quot;Deltalina&quot;

<text>James Litterick (born 15 July 1901; date of death unknown) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada, and was the first member of the Communist Party of Canada to be elected to that province&#x27;s legislature.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Litterick was born in Glasgow, Scotland. He received an education at Clydebrooke and Glasgow, and became a member of the British Socialist Party at age sixteen (his father was also a lifelong socialist). He was jailed for his role in a rent riot at Clydebank in 1920, and joined the newly formed Communist Party of Great Britain the same year.

===Politics===
Litterick moved to Canada in 1925 and initially worked as a miner in Alberta and British Columbia. In 1926, he became the district secretary of the Communist Party of British Columbia. He moved to Montreal in 1930, and became an organizer for the Workers Unity League, a Communist trade union umbrella designed to build a revolutionary trade union movement in Canada. When Communist Party leader Tim Buck was arrested in 1931, Litterick moved to Toronto to take over some of his responsibilities.

He soon moved to Winnipeg. In 1934, Litterick was selected as Provincial Secretary of the Communist Party of Manitoba.

He married Molly Bassin in 1936.

===MLA: 1936–40===
He was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1936, during a period of increased popularity for the party. His campaign focused on eliminating the province&#x27;s 2% wage tax.

In that election, he was very popular among Winnipeg workers. He placed second, behind Independent Socialist Lewis Stubbs, on first-preference votes. Winnipeg at the time elected ten members via Single Transferable Voting. Stubbs was declared elected and on the second count, his surplus votes were transferred away. Litterick received enough votes from him to be declared elected.

Litterick regarded himself as an ally of Stubbs, a popular left-wing judge and Independent Socialist. Litterick&#x27;s primary support base was in Winnipeg&#x27;s working-class north end. He received considerable support from the city&#x27;s Jewish community. (His wife, Molly, was Jewish.)

As MLA, he delivered a speech entitled &quot;Whither Manitoba&quot; in 1937. It was subsequently issued as a pamphlet.

Litterick was not a major figure in the national Communist Party. he did not play a significant public role in the party&#x27;s national activities.

Because of his loyalty to Moscow, Litterick expressed changing views on Canada&#x27;s involvement in World War II in late 1939. On 9 September, he urged both Premier John Bracken and Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King to give full support to Poland against Nazi Germany&#x27;s invasion. Litterick subsequently was required by the party to retract this position, and to oppose the war as an imperialist venture, in light of the Soviet Union&#x27;s neutrality in the conflict at the time. (Later the CPC put their support behind the war after Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941.)

===Later life===
He was expelled from the Manitoba legislature in 1940, after the Communist Party was declared an illegal organization. He had already gone into hiding, apparently the subject of a Royal Canadian Mounted Police manhunt.

Information about Litterick&#x27;s whereabouts after 1940 is limited. He appears in a photograph of Canada&#x27;s wartime Communist Party leaders, apparently taken in Montreal in 1942. He surrendered to the RCMP in Toronto in 1942 and was interned in the Don Jail. In 1943, it was reported that he was working at a garment factory in Toronto.

In his book, &quot;Canadian Communism&quot;, Norman Penner writes, citing as his source his father Jacob Penner&#x27;s personal notes, &quot;After the war, Litterick was expelled from the Party for &#x27;cowardice.&#x27;&quot;

<doc id="866190" wikidata="Q5138183" url="?curid=866190" title="Coast Guard Unit Commendation">
<text>The Coast Guard Unit Commendation is the highest peacetime unit award that may be awarded to military commands of the United States Coast Guard. The decoration was first created in 1963 and is presented to members of any Coast Guard unit that distinguishes itself by valorous or extremely meritorious service, not involving combat, but in support of Coast Guard operations.

It may also be awarded to units and personnel of the other U.S. armed forces, typically when in support of operations where the Coast Guard is the lead service. One example was the award of the commendation with Operational Distinguishing Device to rescue squadrons of the U.S. Air Force and maritime patrol squadrons and helicopter squadrons of the U.S. Navy, when said units assisted the Coast Guard during search and recovery operations following the January 1986 loss of the NASA Space Shuttle Challenger.

Additional awards of the Coast Guard Unit Commendation are denoted by award stars. The Operational Distinguishing Device, a 5/16 inch silver letter &quot;O&quot; centered on the unit of the uniform ribbon, is also authorized for units which are presented the decoration for field operations and conditions.

Prior to 2003, the Coast Guard Unit Commendation was subordinate to the Secretary of Transportation Outstanding Unit Award. With the transfer of the Coast Guard to the Department of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Transportation Outstanding Unit Award became obsolete, making the Coast Guard Unit Commendation the senior peacetime award, but junior to the Joint Meritorious Unit Award and the Presidential Unit Citation.

Admiral Paul Zukunft, Commandant, awarded the Coast Guard Unit Commendation to the Coast Guard Auxiliary on June 23, 2014, for members active from June 24, 2009, to June 23, 2014. 
&quot;Beyond the day to day, the Auxiliary has been there as part of the Coast Guard&#x27;s total force in every major disaster,&quot; said Coast Guard Commandant ADM Zukunft at the ceremony. &quot;During disasters, the Auxiliary takes action to provide air support, conduct search and rescue, fix aids to navigation, conduct public affairs and augment units at home stations whose responders are deployed.&quot;

On the 80th anniversary of the USCG Auxiliary, On May 16, 2019, the US Coast Guard Auxiliary was awarded the Coast Guard Unit Commendation ribbon to all Auxiliarists by Karl Schultz the Commandant of the Coast Guard.

On June 23, 2024 Admiral Linda Fagan, Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, awarded the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary the Coast Guard Unit Commendation in recognition of the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary’s 85th anniversary,

The Coast Guard Auxiliary has been awarded the Coast Guard Unit Commendation a total of seven times:

# September 9, 1993—For service period October 1991 through November 1992 while engaged in several massive operations including service during Hurricanes Andrew, Iniki, Typhoon Omar and instances of serious flooding.

<doc id="866191" wikidata="Q2907690" url="?curid=866191" title="Bob Guiney">
<text>Robert Guiney (born May 8, 1971) is an American television personality and insurance carrier consultant for Lincoln Financial. He was a contestant on the first season of &quot;The Bachelorette&quot; and later, appeared as the bachelor in the fourth season of &quot;The Bachelor&quot;. He hosted &quot;GSN Live&quot; from 2009 until the show&#x27;s ending in 2012.

==Life and career==
Guiney was born in Riverview, Michigan. He is a 1989 graduate of Riverview Community High School. In 1993, he graduated from Michigan State University, where he was a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity and a walk-on quarterback for Michigan State University&#x27;s football team.

He started his own branch of a mortgage company, Allied Home Mortgage, with a childhood friend in 1999.

==Personal life==

Guiney&#x27;s first appearance on reality television was as a contestant on &quot;The Bachelorette&quot;, where he was ultimately eliminated by Trista. Although she failed to give him a rose to advance, the two remained friends, and he was invited to her wedding to the winner Ryan Sutter. His popularity on &quot;The Bachelorette&quot; led to his being cast in 2003 as the bachelor on the fourth season of &quot;The Bachelor&quot;. In the finale, Guiney chose Estella Gardinier, a California mortgage broker, but they broke up soon after the show aired.

Only a few months later, in July 2004, Guiney married &quot;All My Children&quot; actress Rebecca Budig at his family&#x27;s home in Long Lake, Michigan.

Also from Downriver, Michigan, Grosse Ile native Maria Gladowski, then an employee of Disney Consumer Products, engaged Guiney to participate in the worldwide celebration of Mickey Mouse&#x27;s 75th birthday by asking him to design a 6 ft tall, 750 lb Mickey Mouse statue along with 74 other notable Disney legends, celebrities and sports figures, including Ben Affleck, Ellen Degeneres, Elton John, Kevin Garnett and Tony Hawk. The statue, which showcases Mickey in a Detroit Tiger&#x27;s uniform and is titled &quot;Good Catch&quot; as a nod to his days on &quot;The Bachelor,&quot; debuted at Walt Disney World and then traveled the country before it was auctioned by Sotheby&#x27;s in 2005 to benefit the charity of Guiney&#x27;s choice. The statue was purchased by Olympia Entertainment for $8,000 to benefit Starr Commonwealth. To this day, it is proudly displayed at Detroit&#x27;s Comerica Park, home of the Detroit Tigers. Joining Guiney in the celebration, Detroit native and film and television producer Jerry Bruckheimer&#x27;s &quot;Slapstick Mouse&quot; showcased Mickey as a Detroit Red Wing and sold for $11,000 to benefit Ilitch Charities for Children.

On January 13, 2010, People Magazine reported that Guiney and Budig had decided to split. In April 2010, Budig filed for divorce. On Friday, July 23, 2010, the divorce was finalized with neither side requesting spousal support or any other financial assistance. They had no children together.

In 2016 Guiney announced he was getting married for the second time to Jessica Canyon. The wedding took place on November 11, 2016 in Punta Mita, Mexico on his father&#x27;s birthday. His brother-in-law JD DeMare got ordained to marry Guiney and Canyon.

Prior to &quot;The Bachelor&quot;, Guiney was in a Lansing, Michigan-based band called &quot;Fat Amy&quot;. The band split up in 2000 but reunited as the Bob Guiney Band to record the album &quot;3 Sides&quot;, which was released in 2003. The album entered the Nielsen SoundScan album chart at 114 but by November 30, only around 21,000 copies had been sold and by December 7 the album dropped out of the chart&#x27;s top 200 list.

Guiney published a book in 2003, titled &quot;What a Difference a Year Makes: How Life&#x27;s Unexpected Setbacks Can Lead to Unexpected Joy&quot;, describing his life leading up to his appearance on &quot;The Bachelorette&quot;, and the lessons he learned from his family and friends as he went through a divorce in the previous year.

Guiney also performs with the Band From TV, a band of actors from various American television shows who donate the proceeds of their performances and recordings to charities of their choice. Members of the band include Greg Grunberg, James Denton, Hugh Laurie, Adrian Pasdar, Scott Grimes, Andy Patalan and Jesse Spencer.
Guiney currently hosts a real estate makeover show, &quot;Date My House&quot; for TLC.

<text>Upper Bann is a parliamentary constituency in Northern Ireland, which is represented in the United Kingdom House of Commons. The current MP is Carla Lockhart of the Democratic Unionist Party.

==Constituency profile==
Upper Bann includes the post-industrial towns of Portadown, Craigavon, and Lurgan.

==Boundaries==

1983–1997: The District of Craigavon, and the District of Banbridge wards of Ballydown, Central, Edenderry, Gilford, Laurencetown, Loughbrickland, and Seapatrick.

1997–present: The District of Craigavon, and the District of Banbridge wards of Ballydown, Banbridge West, Edenderry, Fort, Gilford, Lawrencetown, Loughbrickland, Seapatrick, and The Cut.

The seat was created in boundary changes in 1983, as part of an expansion of Northern Ireland&#x27;s constituencies from 12 to 17, and was predominantly made up from parts of Armagh and South Down. It was barely changed in further revisions in 1995 and covers the entirety of the district of Craigavon as well as part of Banbridge.

In 2005, the Boundary Commission published provisional recommendations for modifying the boundaries of constituencies in Northern Ireland. It proposed transferring two small parts of Upper Bann to South Down and Lagan Valley. Following public consultation, the Commission revised its proposals which were finally passed through Parliament by means of the Northern Ireland Parliamentary Constituencies Order.

==History==
For the history of the equivalent constituencies prior to 1950 please see Armagh (UK Parliament constituency) and Down (UK Parliament constituency) and from 1950 until 1983, please see also South Down.

The constituency has a unionist majority, though the combined votes for nationalist parties have reached around 35% in elections. The Ulster Unionist Party has traditionally been dominant though it has been supplanted by the Democratic Unionist Party in recent years. The constituency contains Portadown and Drumcree, key locations for the Orange Order and elections to both local councils and the Northern Ireland Assembly have seen independent candidates standing on issues related to Orange Order parades performing well.

In 1990 the sitting MP, Harold McCusker, died and the subsequent by-election was noticeable as for the first time since the early 1970s two major UK political parties stood in a Northern Ireland parliamentary election, the Conservatives and the rump of the Social Democratic Party. However the result was disappointing for the Conservatives, whilst the SDP polled a mere 154 votes. In that by-election David Trimble was elected and five years later he became leader of the Ulster Unionist Party. Trimble&#x27;s leadership came in for much criticism from the rival Democratic Unionist Party and they strongly targeted the area.

In the 2001 general election there was a strong rumour that the DUP leader Ian Paisley would contest the seat himself, in the hope of unseating Trimble, but in the event he stayed in his North Antrim constituency and the DUP instead nominated David Simpson. The campaign was amongst the most bitter in the entire province, with Trimble coming in for fierce personal attacks. He benefitted, however, from the decision of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland not to contest the seat themselves but instead support them. When the results were counted Simpson was initially ahead and many believed he had won, but Trimble pulled ahead to hold the seat on a narrow majority of 2058.

In the subsequent 2003 assembly election the DUP were only 386 votes behind the UUP. Then in the 2005 general election Trimble was defeated by Simpson. Simpson retained his seat in the 2010 general election, although the UUP vote has remained fairly static. The nationalist vote had continued to grow until the 2019 general election, which could have made this seat a possible battleground between nationalists and unionists.

==Members of Parliament==
The previous Member of Parliament, since the 2005 general election, was David Simpson of the Democratic Unionist Party. In that election he defeated David Trimble, then leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, who had held the seat since a 1990 by-election. Simpson stood down at the 2019 general election. He was succeeded by Carla Lockhart, also of the DUP.

<text>Em (М м; italics: &quot;М м&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script.

Em commonly represents the bilabial nasal consonant , like the pronunciation of in &quot;him&quot;. Common Glagolitic script is &quot;Ⰿ and Ⱞ&quot;

It is derived from the Greek letter Mu (Μ μ).

==Form==
The capital Cyrillic letter Em (М м) looks the same as the capital Latin letter M (M m) but, as with most Cyrillic letters, the lowercase form is simply a smaller version of the uppercase letter.

==Usage==
As used in the alphabets of various languages, Em represents the following sounds:
* bilabial nasal consonant , like the pronunciation of in &quot;him&quot; or meet
* palatalized bilabial nasal consonant 

The pronunciations shown in the table are the primary ones for each language; for details consult the articles on the languages.

<doc id="866201" wikidata="Q174069" url="?curid=866201" title="En (Cyrillic)">
<text>En (Н н; italics: &quot;Н н&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script.

It commonly represents the dental nasal consonant , like the pronunciation of in &quot;neat&quot;. 
And it can be palatized like in the pair of hard and soft consonnant for the word: &#x27;wife&#x27; and &#x27;wife&#x27;s&#x27;.

==Glyph==
The capital Cyrillic letter En looks the same as the capitals Greek letter Eta (Η η) and Latin letter H. 
As with most Cyrillic letters, the lowercase form is simply a smaller version of the uppercase.
However, in modern Church Slavonic publications, the old N-shaped form is still often used.

It should not be confused with the letter И (similar to a mirrored shape of the Latin letter N):
* The cursive of the capital letter is similar to the English model Copperplate script, with a modification: the line between the two columns is a rising diagonal, exactly as in letter И. And the minuscule, use quite the same ductus (without the loops), leading generally to a rising diagonal too.
* In some handwritten and typographic fonts, these two Cyrillic letters may be difficult to distinguish because they are both drawn with two wide columns (unlike modern Greek and Latin which use wide columns only on the letter H and thin columns on the letter N) and with an almost illegible line between these two columns (the letters use a different angle, but sometimes it&#x27;s too close to the horizontal and the line can be so thin that the angle is almost invisible). 
* In some context (advertising, packaging), it is frequent to see on the same page the modern shape and the previous forms (considered as &quot;Slavic&quot; or &quot;Church&quot; with the &quot;illegible&quot; line).
==History==
In the Early Cyrillic alphabet, the letter was created according to the model of the Greek letter Nu. The modifications of the glyph N over the centuries have led to the adoption of the current form of Greek letter Eta (H), a shape that has been formerly used as a model for the letter И.

===Theories===
The believing that &quot;the reason En has a horizontal bar, like H, instead of a diagonal line, is to avoid confusion with the letter И&quot; has no groundings:
* The original shapes of letters Н and И were shapes N and H, and were perfectly legibles during centuries. And the Greek and Latin glyphs N and H are both still the same today. 
* Difficult to say that the mirrored shapes N and И would be confusing in the same alphabet as Latin alphabet has many mirrored letters like b and d, or p and q, and letters very similar like O and Q, or C and G. Even Cyrillic alphabet has preserved the very similar letters Б and В (В could have turned into a Latin V) or has created a confusion between letters Л and П (formerly Л had a shape of Lambda Λ).

It seems more probable that the change of shapes in Cyrillic resulted from a cascade of consequences, apparently around the letter И, and maybe also letter І and the letter П (see these letters for details of their history).

===Initial shape===
From c. 893 in Bulgaria, the Early Cyrillic alphabet was made of uncial Greek letters and glagolitic letters. This Cyrillic uncial, called &quot;&quot; in Russian, is a style developed on the model of the Greek uncial.

The name of En was (&quot;našĭ&quot;), meaning &quot;ours&quot;.
The letter was created according to the model of the Greek letter Nu (Ν ν) as they share the same sound /n/. Therefore, the letter had a descending diagonal &quot;\&quot; between the two vertical lines.

At the same time, the letter И was created according to the model of the Greek letter Eta (Η η) for the same reason (sound /i/). Therefore, the letter had a horizontal line &quot;-&quot; between the two vertical lines.

In Cyrillic uncial style (as in Greek), for the two letters Н and И (shapes N and H), the vertical columns are drawn wide and the line between is thin.

These shapes are mainly used up to the 13th century, and since the 19th century, in academic publishing to reproduce old Slavonic texts (when ustav-style Cyrillic fonts are used). 
See for example:
The letter И like an H can still be seen in a book &quot;Arithmetic&quot; from Leonty Magnitsky published in Moscow in 1703 (see the book ШИЦГАЛ А.Г., РУССКИЙ ТИПОГРАФСКИЙ ШРИФТ, page 24), or in a book printed by order of the Tsar in 1706 (see Font of I.Kopievich in the Russian version of the article &quot;&quot;).

===First modification===
In the Cyrillic letter Н with the Greek shape N, the descending diagonal &quot;\&quot; will progressively become shorter:
* the diagonal starts either at the top of the first vertical line, or lower with a very small angle (10 to 20 degrees).
* the diagonal ends in the middle of the second vertical line;

See for example:
One of the explanations may be the management of the virtual line horizontally dividing the letters as А,Б,В,Є,Ж,З,Н,К,Х,Ч,Э,Ю. And this was also applied to the glyph N for some unknown reason (maybe a need for simplification, or to create a styling effect). For example, the scribe draws the horizontal in the glyph H higher than the middle, then the other similar letters will be drawn with a virtual line higher. Therefore, in the glyph N, the scribe must shorten the diagonal and make it end at the level of the virtual line. Then, other scribes repeat the same modifications but sometimes without respecting the same virtual line for all the letters, thus making the root cause disappear.

In uncial Greek, the shape of the letter H sometimes sees the horizontal line rise upwards, and the shape of the letter N either does not change, or moves accordingly, and sometimes we can see both versions in the same text (see Lectionary 5 and Lectionary 183).

===Second modification===
From the 15th century, the &quot;&quot; ( in Russian) a semi-uncial style developed, and is notably still used today by the Church Slavonic publishing.
This style turns into a more fluid writing: there is a slope, letters descending below the line, capital letters, transitional cursive.

In parallel, the first printing fonts are being developed. In 1517, a work of simplification and &quot;romanization&quot; of the Cyrillic alphabet by the first Belarusian printer François Skorina (Prague and Vilnius editions) will give a writing of capitals close to modern. This font was further improved thanks to the Belarusian printer Ilya Kopievich, who from 1700 to 1706, by order of Peter I, published about 25 books in Amsterdam and Danzig. The font of his publications was extremely close to the civil font adopted by the Russian emperor and printed by Pierre Mogiloy in 1708.

In the Cyrillic И with the Greek shape H, the horizontal line &quot;-&quot; has become an ascending diagonal:
* the diagonal starts at the bottom of the first vertical line, in the middle or at three-quarter;
* the diagonal ends either at the top of the second vertical line, or lower with a very small angle (10 or 20 degrees).

See for examples:
Therefore, the H-shape for the letter И became less frequent and eventually became available for another letter as... Н. Then the official Civil Script made it mandatory to use the H-shape for the letter Н (in use at that time, see Karion Istomin&#x27;s alphabet book from 1694) at the detriment of the original N-shape. No specific explanation is available for this choice and if there was a problem with readability, it could have been decided to return to the original shape as in the Greek or Latin alphabet. We can only note that the Church prefers to continue using the old shape, thus refusing to reverse two ghlyphs in the Cyrillic alphabet created specifically to translate the Bible, and thus avoiding repeating the instability of this H-shape (cf. cursive).

==Utilization==
* During the transition from Cyrillic to Latin alphabet, the Romanian transitional alphabet used the Latin glyphs N and n (or ɴ), instead of the Cyrillic glyphs Н and н starting 1846.
* In the Agatha Christie novel &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;, there is a monogrammed handkerchief, and the &quot;Н&quot; is actually a Cyrillic letter, saying that her forename is Natalia.
* The Cyrillic letter &quot;Н&quot; is one of the symbols of the movement of supporters of Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny.

<text>Pe (П п; italics: &quot;П п&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script.

It commonly represents the unaspirated voiceless bilabial plosive , like the pronunciation of in &quot;spin&quot;.

==History==

The Cyrillic letter Pe was derived from the Greek letter Pi (Π π).

The name of Pe in the Early Cyrillic alphabet was (&quot;pokoi&quot;), meaning &quot;peaceful state&quot;.

In the Cyrillic numeral system, Pe had a value of 80.

==Form==

The capital Cyrillic letter Pe looks exactly like the Greek capital Pi from which it is derived, and small Pe looks like a smaller version of the same, though with a less prominent horizontal bar (Greek Π π &gt; Cyrillic П п). Pe is not to be confused with the Cyrillic letter El (Л л; italics: &quot;Л л&quot;), which has a hook on its left leg in some fonts (in others El resembles the Greek Lambda (Λ)).

In italics and handwriting, capital Pe looks identical to the Greek capital Pi in these forms. The lowercase forms, however, differ among the languages that use the Cyrillic alphabet. Small italic Cyrillic Pe in the majority of fonts or handwritten styles looks like the small italic Latin N . In handwritten Serbian, however, it appears as a Latin U with a bar over it .

==Usage==
As used in the alphabets of various languages, Pe represents the following sounds:
*voiceless bilabial plosive , like the pronunciation of in &quot;pack&quot;
*palatalized voiceless bilabial plosive 

The pronunciations shown in the table are the primary ones for each language; for details consult the articles on the languages.

<text>Te (Т т; italics: &quot;Т т&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script. It commonly represents the voiceless dental stop , like the pronunciation of in &quot;stop&quot;. In most cursive writing, lowercase Te looks like the Latin lowercase m.

==History==
The Cyrillic letter Te was derived from the Greek letter Tau (Τ τ).

The name of Te in the Early Cyrillic alphabet was (&quot;tvrdo&quot;), meaning &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;surly&quot;.

In the Cyrillic numeral system, Te has a value of 300.

==Form==

The capital Cyrillic letter Te (Т т) looks the same as the capital Latin letter T (T t) but, as with most Cyrillic letters, the lowercase form is simply a smaller version of the uppercase letter same as М.

In italic type and cursive, the lowercase form looks like the italic form of the lowercase Latin M , except in Bulgarian, Serbian and Macedonian usage where it looks like an inverted lowercase Latin M, with a stroke above to distinguish it from the otherwise identical italic lowercase letter Sha , which is sometimes written with a stroke below. Compare the 5th letter pair in the 4th row with the last letter pair of the chart.

The cursive form of the capital letter Te can also be seen in the chart following the lower case letter.

In some old materials, the lowercase form has two variants: on the &quot;Trebnik&quot; of Metropolitan Peter and the &quot;Ostrog Bible&quot; this letter has a taller variant looks like number 7 (); on some vernacular Russian publications up to the mid-19th century, this letter have been found as a variant resembling a turned Sha (). Both of them were encoded in the Unicode Standard in June 2016 with the release of version 9.0.
==Usage==
As used in the alphabets of various languages, Te represents the following sounds:
*voiceless alveolar plosive , like the pronunciation of in &quot;tick&quot;
*palatalized voiceless alveolar plosive 

The pronunciations shown in the table are the primary ones for each language; for details consult the articles on the languages.

<doc id="866208" wikidata="Q179860" url="?curid=866208" title="Kha (Cyrillic)">
<text>Kha, Khe, Xe or Ha (Х х; italics: &quot;Х х&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script. It looks the same as the Latin letter X (X x &quot;X x&quot;), in both uppercase and lowercase, both roman and italic forms, and was derived from the Greek letter Chi, which also bears a resemblance to both the Latin X and Kha.

It commonly represents the voiceless velar fricative , similar to how some Scottish speakers pronounce the in “loch”, but has different pronunciations in different languages.

Kha is romanised as for Russian, Ukrainian, Mongolian, and Tajik, and as for Belarusian and Polish, while being romanised as for Serbo-Croatian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Kazakh.
It is also romanised as for Spanish.

==History==
The Cyrillic letter Kha was derived from the Greek letter Chi (Χ χ).

The name of Kha in the Early Cyrillic alphabet was (&quot;xěrŭ&quot;).

In the Cyrillic numeral system, Kha has a value of 600.

==Usage==
===Russian===
Kha is the twenty-third letter of the Russian alphabet. It represents the voiceless velar fricative unless it is before a palatalizing vowel, when it represents .

===Ossetian===
Kha represents the voiceless uvular fricative in Ossetian. The digraph ⟨хъ⟩ represents the voiceless uvular plosive .

===Belarusian===
Kha is also an alternative transliteration of the letter Ḫāʼ in the Arabic alphabet. This was used in Belarusian Arabic script, corresponding to the above Cyrillic letter.

===Ukrainian===
Kha is the twenty-sixth letter of the Ukrainian alphabet. It represents the voiceless velar fricative /x/.

===Aleut===
In Aleut, kha represents . Kha with inverted breve (Х̑ х̑) represents the voiceless uvular fricative ().

==Figurative meanings of &quot;хѣръ&quot;==
* Because of the shape of the letter X, its name kher was often used to refer to something cross-shaped: Dahl mentions &quot;the game of kheriki-oniki&quot; (crosses and zeros) and the expression &quot;legs like kher&quot; as the opposite of &quot;bowlegged&quot;, &quot;legs like a wheel&quot;. From this also comes the word pokherovat (originally, to cross out crosswise; cf. in N. S. Leskov: Vladika crossed out the consistory&#x27;s decision on the appointment of the investigation with a kher.
* Being the first letter of the vulgar and obscene word for the male genital organ, the word kher has been actively used as its euphemism since the 19th century. As a result, by the 1990s in the USSR, the word &quot;kher&quot; and its derivatives (e.g., &quot;pokherit&quot;) were perceived as taboo by many people, as the original names of Cyrillic letters had been forgotten by the majority of the population. This fact has also affected the use of the word &quot;kher&quot; in the post-Soviet era, despite the change of attitude towards obscene vocabulary. Nevertheless, the portal Gramota.ru notes that &quot;the word kher and all derivatives of it do not belong to obscene words&quot;.

At approximately 9 years of age, she returned to Cincinnati to attend the School for Creative and Performing Arts, which she did from grade 4 through 12, graduating in 1991. Budig then attended the University of Miami until, at her manager&#x27;s suggestion, she dropped out during her sophomore year and headed west, so as not to miss out on that pilot season&#x27;s auditions.

Budig&#x27;s first acting job was in Aerosmith&#x27;s music video &quot;Livin&#x27; on the Edge&quot;. She later had a cameo role as a teenage girl saved by Chris O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s character Dick Grayson in &quot;Batman Forever.&quot;

In 1995, Budig was about to audition for the role of Kelsey Jefferson on &quot;All My Children&quot; when she received an offer from &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, where she began her three-year stint as Michelle Bauer from (1995 to 1998).

Budig played the role of Patty in &quot;Captain Nuke and the Bomber Boys&quot; in 1995. She then portrayed Babsy in the 1996 film &quot;God&#x27;s Lonely Man&quot;, followed by &quot;James Dean: A Race with Destiny&quot; where she played actress Natalie Wood and &quot;Bonehead Detectives in the Paleo World&quot; where she played Allie. Both films were released in 1997.

Budig&#x27;s most famous role has been that of the spoiled, rich girl-turned-makeup company executive Greenlee Smythe on &quot;All My Children&quot;—a role which she originated on August 11, 1999. Greenlee was supposed to be a recurring role, but executives enjoyed Budig and offered her a three-year contract. While on &quot;All My Children&quot;, Budig garnered accolades from fans and press for her performance on the soap opera, as well as her character&#x27;s pairing with Josh Duhamel&#x27;s Leo du Pres. She was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2001 and again in 2003. Her onscreen pairing with Duhamel earned them a Daytime Emmy Award nomination as well, for America&#x27;s Favorite Couple in 2002. She was often called &quot;Little Budig&quot; by Duhamel, who had given her the nickname. In 2003, Budig won a Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Younger Lead Actress. In November 2005, Budig left the show to relocate to California.

Other notable roles include co-hosting &quot;The Sports Illustrated for Kids Show&quot;. Budig worked for the World Wrestling Federation as an interviewer for a short time on &quot;Sunday Night HEAT&quot; in 2000. She has made appearances on &quot;Out of Practice&quot;, as well as on &quot;Hope &amp; Faith&quot;. She did a movie called &quot;The Perfect Child&quot; (2007) featured on Lifetime with the leading role as Sarah Daniels. In addition, Budig has been seen on &quot;CSI&quot; playing a role as a murdered lap dancer (Season 8, Episodes 9 &amp; 10).

It was announced in late 2007 that Budig would be returning to &quot;All My Children&quot; as Greenlee Smythe, the role she originated. She had been replaced by another actress Sabine Singh earlier that year. She returned to the show in January 2008. However, she signed a limited contract with the show. Later, while rumors circulated of Budig&#x27;s departure, she confirmed in October 2008 that she would be leaving the series again in February 2009. Budig cited the reason for her departure as wanting to return to the West Coast to be with her husband. Budig returned to &#x27;All My Children in late December 2009 (when the show relocated production to Los Angeles), and remained with the series until its series finale in September 2011.

In 2010, Budig won the first and only season of the ABC show &quot;Skating with the Stars&quot;. The show paired celebrities with professional ice skaters, who competed each week. Since September 2013, she began co-hosting the syndicated lifestyle television show &quot;Better&quot;, alongside JD Roberto. In 2012, she appeared with Janeane Garofalo in the comedic movie &quot;Bad Parents&quot;. In February 2015, it was announced that Budig had been cast on &quot;General Hospital&quot; in an unknown &quot;killer&quot; role. She debuted the role of Hayden Barnes on March 20, 2015. On June 27, 2017, it was announced that Budig had been let go from &quot;General Hospital&quot;, with her dismissal cited as a &quot;storyline necessity&quot;. On May 9, 2019, it was announced that she would reprise the role of Hayden Barnes on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. On June 27, 2019, it was announced that Budig would return in July; returning during the final moments of the July 8, 2019, episode. However, on November 20, 2019, Budig&#x27;s exit was confirmed once more; she made her last appearance on November 27, 2019. 

On August 6, 2024, Budig began airing on her fourth soap opera, &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, stepping into the long-running role of Taylor Hayes.

==Personal life==
Budig is the youngest of eight children. She has five sisters and two brothers. In 2000, Budig married Dr. Daniel Geller; the marriage only lasted several months.
She met former &quot;Bachelor&quot; star Bob Guiney while hosting &quot;The Bachelor&quot; repeat shows on ABC Family. The two were married on July 3, 2004. On January 13, 2010, &quot;People Magazine&quot; reported that Budig and Guiney had decided to split, with Budig filing for divorce in April 2010.

Budig became engaged to television marketing executive Michael Benson on Christmas Day in 2010. The pair married in 2012. On May 1, 2014, Budig announced that she was five months pregnant with the couple&#x27;s first baby. On September 8, 2014, Budig gave birth to a daughter.

<doc id="866210" wikidata="Q173915" url="?curid=866210" title="Che (Cyrillic)">
<text>Che, Cha or Chu (Ч ч; italics: &quot;Ч ч&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script.

It commonly represents the voiceless postalveolar affricate , like the in &quot;switch&quot; or in &quot;choice&quot;.

In English, it is romanized typically as but sometimes as , like in French. In German, it can be transcribed as . In linguistics, it is transcribed as so &quot;Tchaikovsky&quot; (Чайковский in Russian) may be transcribed as &quot;Chaykovskiy&quot; or &quot;Čajkovskij&quot;.

==Form==
The letter Che (Ч ч) resembles an upside-down lowercase Latin h, as well as resembling the digit 4, especially in digital or open-ended form.

==History==
The name of Che in the Early Cyrillic alphabet was Чрьвь (&quot;črĭvĭ&quot;), meaning &quot;worm&quot;.

In the Cyrillic numeral system, Che originally did not have a value, however, by the 1300s it started to be used with the numeric value 90 as a replacement for Koppa, some varieties that preserved Koppa around this time used Che with the value 60 instead of the usual letter for it, Ksi. Nowadays, Koppa is not used anymore in any variety, and Che has fully replaced it as the letter with the numeric value 90.

==Usage==
===Slavic languages===
Except for Russian and Serbian, all Cyrillic-alphabet Slavic languages use Che to represent the voiceless postalveolar affricate (the ch sound in English).

In Russian, Che usually represents the voiceless alveolo-palatal affricate (like the Mandarin pronunciation of j in pinyin). It is occasionally exceptionally pronounced as:
* the voiceless retroflex affricate (like Mandarin pinyin zh), like in , or
* the voiceless retroflex fricative (like Mandarin pinyin sh), like in .

In Serbian, Che is always pronounced as (Latin: č), as the letter Tshe (Ћ/ћ; Latin: ć), which is unique to Serbian, is always used for the sound. Loanwords using /tʃ/ are typically transliterated to Che rather than Tshe.

===In China===
The 1955 version of Hanyu pinyin contained the Che for the sound [tɕ] (for which later the letter &quot;j&quot; was used), apparently because of its similarity to the Bopomofo letterㄐ.

The Latin Zhuang alphabet used a modified Hindu-Arabic numeral 4, strongly resembling Che, from 1957 to 1986 to represent the fourth (falling) tone. In 1986, it was replaced by the Latin letter X.

<text>Shcha (Щ щ; italics: &quot;Щ щ&quot;), Shta, or Scha is a letter of the Cyrillic script. In Russian, it represents the long voiceless alveolo-palatal fricative , similar to the pronunciation of in &quot;Welsh-sheep&quot;. In Ukrainian and Rusyn, it represents the consonant cluster , something like &quot;cash-chest&quot;. In Bulgarian, it represents the consonant cluster , like the pronunciation of “scht” in Borscht. Most other non-Slavic languages written in Cyrillic use this letter to spell the few loanwords that use it or foreign names; it is usually pronounced , an approximation of the Russian pronunciation of the letter, and is often omitted when teaching those languages.

In English, Russian Shcha is romanized as , , or occasionally as , all reflecting the historical Russian pronunciation of the letter (as a combined &quot;Ш&quot; and &quot;Ч&quot;). English-speaking learners of Russian are often instructed to pronounce it in this way although it is no longer the standard pronunciation in Russian (it still is in Ukrainian and Rusyn, as above). The letter Щ in Russian and Ukrainian corresponds to ШЧ in related words in Belarusian.

==History==
The Cyrillic letter Shcha was derived from the Glagolitic letter Shta ().

The name in the Early Cyrillic alphabet was (&quot;šta&quot;) and is preserved in modern Bulgarian; it is pronounced .

This letter was also used in Komi (⟨Ч⟩ was &amp; still is used for /t͡ɕ/), which is now represented by the digraph .

==Form==
The form of the letter shcha is considered to have originated as a ligature of the letters Ш and Т. However in later orthographies it began to be depicted as the letter Cyrillic Sha (Ш ш) with a descender. The descender (also used in Ц) has been reinterpreted as a diacritic and used in several letters for non-Slavic languages, such as Ң and Қ.

<text>O (О о; italics: &quot;О о&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script.

The letter most commonly represents the sound /ɔ/, like the o in &quot;off&quot;. In Russian and Serbo-Croatian, it represents the sound /o/.

==History==
The Cyrillic letter О was derived from the Greek letter Omicron (Ο ο).

==Form==
===Modern fonts===
In modern-style typefaces, the Cyrillic letter O looks exactly like the Latin letter O and the Greek letter Omicron .

===Church Slavonic printed fonts and Slavonic manuscripts===
Historical typefaces (like &quot;poluustav&quot; (semi-uncial), a standard font style for the Church Slavonic typography) and old manuscripts represent several additional glyph variants of Cyrillic O, both for decorative and orthographic (sometimes also &quot;hieroglyphic&quot;) purposes, namely:
* broad variant (Ѻ/ѻ), used mostly as a word initial letter (see Broad On for more details);
* narrow variant, being used now in Synodal Church Slavonic editions as the first element of digraph Oy/oy (see Uk (Cyrillic) for more details), and in the editions of Old Believers for unstressed &quot;o&quot; as well;
* variant with a cross inside (Crossed O), Ꚛ, used in certain manuscripts as the initial letter of words &quot;окрестъ&quot; &#x27;around, nearby&#x27; (the root of this Slavonic word, &quot;крест&quot;, means &#x27;cross&#x27;) and &quot;округъ&quot; &#x27;district, neighbourhood&#x27; with their derivatives;
* &quot;eyed&quot; variant (Monocular O) with a dot inside (Ꙩ/ꙩ), used in certain manuscripts in spelling of word &quot;око&quot; &#x27;eye&#x27; and its derivatives. In many other texts, including the birchbark letters, the monocular O was not used as a hieroglyph but largely as a synonym of Broad On signalling the word-initial position;
* &quot;two-eyed&quot; variants (Binocular O) with two dots inside (Ꙫ/ꙫ or Ꙭ/ꙭ), also double &quot;O&quot; without dots inside were used in certain manuscripts in spelling of dual/plural forms of the words with the same root &#x27;eye&#x27;;
* &quot;many-eyed&quot; variant (Multiocular O), ꙮ, used in certain manuscripts in spelling of the same root when embedded into word &quot;многоочитый&quot; &#x27;many-eyed&#x27; (an attribute of seraphim).

==Usage==
In Russian, O is used word-initially, after another vowel, and after non-palatalized consonants. Because of a vowel reduction processes, the Russian phoneme may have a number of pronunciations in unstressed syllables, including and .

In Macedonian, Bulgarian, Ukrainian and Belarusian, the letter represents the sound /ɔ/.

In Tuvan the Cyrillic letter can be written as a double vowel.
It&#x27;s the most common letter in the Russian language.

<doc id="866220" wikidata="Q442226" url="?curid=866220" title="Mary Cheney">
<text>Mary Claire Cheney (; born March 14, 1969) is the younger of the two daughters of Dick Cheney, the 46th vice president of the United States and 17th United States secretary of defense, and Lynne Cheney. She is involved with a number of political action committees. She married her wife, Heather Poe, in 2012, and was a signatory to an &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot; case in 2013.

==Early life and education==
Cheney was born in Madison, Wisconsin. She attended McLean High School in McLean, Virginia, graduating in the class of 1987. Following that, she attended Colorado College, her mother and sister&#x27;s alma mater, in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and graduated in 1991. She earned a graduate business degree from the University of Denver in 2002.

==Career==
In 1993, she became one of the first employees of the Colorado Rockies baseball team, working in promotions when the team began playing in Denver; thereafter, she was a public relations manager for the Coors Brewing Company, and worked as a gay outreach coordinator, helping to end a national Coors strike and boycott by the gay community.

She has been one of her father&#x27;s top campaign aides and closest confidantes. In July 2003, she became the Director of Vice Presidential Operations for the Bush re-election campaign in 2004.

Cheney was vice president of standards and practices at AOL, leaving in 2007.

==Personal life==
Mary Cheney has been with her wife, Heather Poe, since 1992.

Cheney has voiced support for same-sex marriage, and has been credited with encouraging her father&#x27;s approval of it, which he has publicly supported since leaving the vice presidency.

In December 2006, Mary Cheney was reported to be pregnant. She and Poe were said to be &quot;ecstatic&quot; about the baby. &quot;The vice president and Mrs. Cheney are looking forward with eager anticipation to the arrival of their sixth grandchild,&quot; spokesperson Lea Anne McBride said on December 5.

On January 31, 2007, in a forum by &quot;Glamour Magazine&quot; at Barnard College of Columbia University, Mary Cheney stated that: &quot;This is a baby... This is a blessing from God. It is not a political statement. It is not a prop to be used in a debate by people on either side of an issue. It is my child.&quot; She gave birth to her first child, Samuel, in May 2007.

Cynthia Leive, editor in chief of &quot;Glamour&quot;, asked Cheney if she had anything to say to critics like James Dobson, who has denounced same-sex marriage and LGBT people raising children. Cheney accused Dobson of distorting the research he cited, and added: &quot;Every piece of remotely responsible research that has been done in the last 20 years has shown there is no difference between children raised by same-sex parents and children raised by opposite-sex parents; what matters is being raised in a stable, loving environment.&quot; She also said that Dobson was entitled to his opinion, &quot;but he&#x27;s not someone whose endorsement I have ever drastically sought&quot;.

Cheney gave birth to her second child, Sarah, on November 18, 2009. Cheney and Poe were married on June 22, 2012 in Washington, D.C. The family resides in Great Falls, Virginia.

===Dispute with Liz Cheney===
In 2013, Mary Cheney&#x27;s older sister Liz, who was running for a Senate seat in Wyoming, stated during an interview on &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; that she did not support same-sex marriage. In response, Mary Cheney denounced her sister&#x27;s remarks, writing in a Facebook post, &quot;Either you think all families should be treated equally or you don&#x27;t. Liz&#x27;s position is to treat my family as second-class citizens.&quot; Mary subsequently said she would not support her sister&#x27;s candidacy and would boycott visiting the rest of the Cheney family for Christmas that year.

In 2013, her wife Heather Poe wrote a Facebook post stating, &quot;Liz has been a guest in our home, has spent time and shared holidays with our children, and when Mary and I got married in 2012 – she didn&#x27;t hesitate to tell us how happy she was for us. To have her now say she doesn&#x27;t support our right to marry is offensive to say the least.&quot;

In 2015, when asked if she and her sister had mended their relationship, Mary Cheney said, &quot;I don&#x27;t have to answer that.&quot; However, in 2021, Liz told &quot;60 Minutes&quot; they had reconciled after she admitted to Mary that she had been wrong in her views on same-sex marriage.

==Politics==

===2000 presidential campaign===
In 2000, the Bush-Cheney presidential campaign freely discussed Liz Cheney&#x27;s marriage and children, but were silent about Mary Cheney&#x27;s private life. Nevertheless, Cheney&#x27;s sexual orientation was publicly known, and some considered her presence during the campaign as bolstering, providing the Republican ticket with a &quot;compassionate conservative&quot; image. During an interview with Lynne Cheney, Cokie Roberts brought up the topic of Mary Cheney&#x27;s having declared herself gay. Lynne Cheney responded by stating that &quot;Mary has never declared such a thing&quot;, and criticized Roberts and the media for their interest in the story.

In 2002, Mary Cheney joined the Republican gay-straight alliance Republican Unity Coalition and said that sexual orientation should be &quot;a non-issue&quot; for the Republican Party. Cheney resigned from the RUC&#x27;s board and in July 2003 became the director of vice presidential operations for the Bush-Cheney 2004 re-election campaign.

===Federal Marriage Amendment===
In 2004, public attention focused again on Cheney&#x27;s sexuality, when the Bush administration supported the Federal Marriage Amendment, a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution that would limit marriage to heterosexual couples and ban civil unions and domestic partnership benefits. Cheney did not publicly express her opinion of the amendment at the time. In her 2006 autobiography &quot;Now It&#x27;s My Turn&quot;, Cheney stated her opposition to the amendment. However, at the time, she remained silent to support Bush&#x27;s re-election bid. In August 2004, Dick Cheney reiterated the position he took in the 2000 presidential campaign: that the issue should be handled by individual state governments. He added, though, that President Bush determined his administration&#x27;s policies, and his policy supported the Federal Marriage Amendment.

===2004 presidential re-election campaign===
During the 2004 Bush-Cheney presidential re-election campaign, Cheney served as her father&#x27;s director of vice presidential operations, which led to discussion of her sexual orientation making its way into the media again.

The 2004 presidential election debates included mentions of the same-sex marriage debate and referred, initially indirectly, to Cheney. Both Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry and vice-presidential candidate John Edwards mentioned and praised Cheney&#x27;s openness with regard to her sexual orientation when questioned regarding LGBT issues.

During the Cheney-Edwards vice-presidential debate, moderator Gwen Ifill directed a question to the Vice President in which his daughter was indirectly mentioned:

Cheney reiterated his position of four years prior, stating the issue should be left to the states but that he supports the Bush administration. He did not mention his family nor his daughter in his immediate response to the question. In his response, Edwards said:

Although he was given 90 seconds to respond to Edwards&#x27; comments, Cheney responded succinctly, &quot;Well, Gwen, let me simply thank the senator for the kind words he said about my family and our daughter. I appreciate that very much.&quot; Ifill followed up: &quot;That&#x27;s it?&quot; Cheney replied, &quot;That&#x27;s it&quot;, effectively ending the discussion of his daughter&#x27;s sexual orientation. At the end of the debate, Mary Cheney appeared on the podium with her partner and the rest of the family.

During the third and final Bush-Kerry presidential debate, moderator Bob Schieffer asked, &quot;Do you believe homosexuality is a choice?&quot; to which Kerry replied, &quot;If you were to talk to Dick Cheney&#x27;s daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she&#x27;s being who she was, she&#x27;s being who she was born as.&quot; In response, Dick Cheney stated, &quot;You saw a man who will say and do anything in order to get elected. And I am not just speaking as a father here, though I am a pretty angry father.&quot;

=== 2010 political work ===
In 2010, Mary Cheney became involved in a network of politically active nonprofit organizations. The network is illustrated in this reference: According to tax forms filed with the Internal Revenue Service, Cheney is a member of the BKM Strategies consulting firm. In 2010, Cheney and two other Republican consultants, Barry Bennett and Kara Ahern, started two nonprofits in the office of BKM Strategies: The Alliance for Freedom and the Alliance for America&#x27;s Future. In the same year, Cheney and Kara Ahern established a Super PAC, Partnership for America&#x27;s Future, which is not currently active.

=== 2014 political work ===
In 2014, Cheney&#x27;s consulting firm BKM Strategies was apparently responsible for a writing campaign in support of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. Of the nearly 125,000 comments filed with the U.S. State Department, at least 98,000 contained similar pro-pipeline language and came from individuals listing BKM Strategies as the originating organization, according to the nonprofit Sunlight Foundation.

==2006 autobiography==

Mary Cheney left the public spotlight after the 2004 election until May 4, 2006, when she was interviewed by Diane Sawyer for ABC News&#x27; &quot;Primetime&quot; program to promote her autobiography, &quot;Now It&#x27;s My Turn&quot;. In the book, published in 2006, Cheney discusses how she came out to her parents, recounting her father&#x27;s initial reaction: &quot;You know, look, you&#x27;re my daughter and I love you and I just want you to be happy.&quot; She also discusses her relationship with her partner, Heather Poe.

Gay rights advocates criticized her for waiting until after the 2004 election to voice her disapproval of the Bush administration&#x27;s positions on gay rights. During another appearance by Cheney on May 19, 2006, on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, David Letterman brought up some of the issues raised by the gay community. He asked Cheney why she had waited two years after the 2004 election to speak publicly about gay marriage and LGBT rights, and asked whether she had any input with the Bush administration regarding gay issues. Cheney responded that she did not, and that it had not been her job to do so.

==&quot;Vice&quot; portrayal==
Actress Alison Pill portrayed Mary Cheney in the 2018 film &quot;Vice&quot;, a biographical film about Dick Cheney in which Mary&#x27;s sexuality is cited as her father&#x27;s reason for not running for president, because he is portrayed as wanting to protect her from attacks by his opponents in the Republican primaries. Neither Dick nor Mary Cheney provided comments on whether this or other depictions regarding them in the film were accurate.

<text>U (У у; italics: &quot;У у&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script. It commonly represents the close back rounded vowel , somewhat like the pronunciation of in &quot;boot&quot; or &quot;rule&quot;. The forms of the Cyrillic letter U are similar to the lowercase of the Latin letter Y (Y y; &quot;Y y&quot;), with the lowercase Cyrillic letter U&#x27;s form being identical to that of small Latin letter Y.

== History ==
Historically, Cyrillic U evolved as a specifically East Slavic short form of the digraph used in ancient Slavic texts to represent . The digraph was itself a direct loan from the Greek alphabet, where the combination (omicron-upsilon) was also used to represent . Later, the o was removed, leaving the modern upsilon-only form.

Consequently, the form of the letter is derived from Greek upsilon , which was parallelly also taken over into the Cyrillic alphabet in another form, as Izhitsa . (The letter Izhitsa was removed from the Russian alphabet in the orthography reform of 1917/19.)

It is normally romanised as &quot;u&quot;, but in Kazakh, it is romanised as &quot;w&quot;.

In the Cyrillic numeral system, the Cyrillic letter U had a value of 400.

==In other languages==
In Tuvan the Cyrillic letter can be written as a double vowel.

In certain languages, U is used to mark labialization.

<text>Yeru or Eru (Ы ы; italics: &quot;Ы&quot; &quot;ы&quot;), usually called Y in modern Russian or Yery or Ery historically and in modern Church Slavonic, is a letter in the Cyrillic script. It represents the close central unrounded vowel (more rear or upper than i) after non-palatalised (hard) consonants in the Belarusian and Russian alphabets.

The letter is usually romanised , such that the family name is usually written Krylov in English and most other West European languages. That spelling matches the Latin alphabet used for the Slavic language Polish, whose letter represents the same sound. Similarly, is used for in the cyrillisation of Polish, such that the name appears as in Russian. Note, however, that the letter also appears in romanisation of other Russian letters both in isolation (such as , ) and as part of digraphs (such as , ).

In Rusyn, represents the close-mid back unrounded vowel . In most Turkic languages that use Cyrillic, such as Kazakh and Kyrgyz, is used to represent the close back unrounded vowel /ɯ/ instead.

==Origin==
Like many other Cyrillic letters, it was originally from a ligature (which is represented in Unicode as Yeru with Back Yer), formed from Yer and Dotted I (formerly written either dotless or with two dots) or Izhe ( which formerly resembled ). In Medieval manuscripts, it is almost always found as or . The modern form first occurred in South Slavic manuscripts following the loss of palatalization of word-final and preconsonantal consonants, so the letters and became confused; since the end of the 14th century, came to be used in East Slavic manuscripts.

==Usage==
While vowel letters in the Cyrillic alphabet may be divided into iotated and non-iotated pairs (for example, and both represent , the latter denoting a preceding palatalised consonant), is more complicated. It appears only after hard consonants, its phonetic value differs from , and there is some scholarly disagreement as to whether or not and denote different phonemes.

===In Russian===
There are no native Russian words that begin with (except for the specific verb : &quot;to say the -sound&quot;), but there are many proper and common nouns of non-Russian origin (including some geographical names in Russia) that begin with it: Kim Jong-un () and Eulji Mundeok (), a Korean military leader; and Ytyk-Kyuyol (), Ygyatta (), a village and a river in Sakha (Yakutia) Republic respectively.

===In Ukrainian===
In the Ukrainian alphabet, yery is not used since the language lacks the sound . In the Ukrainian alphabet, yery merged with [i] and was phased out in the second half of the 19th century. According to the Ukrainian academician Hryhoriy Pivtorak, the letter was replaced with so called &quot;Cyrillic i&quot; , which in Ukrainian represents the sound , which appeared by the merger of the earlier sounds [ɨ] and [i]. Ukrainian also had newly developed the sound [i] from various origins, which is represented by (&quot;Cyrillic dotted i&quot;). Yery could be found in several earlier versions of the Ukrainian writing system that were introduced in the 19th century among which were &quot;Pavlovsky writing system&quot;, &quot;Sloboda Ukraine (New) writing system&quot;, and &quot;Yaryzhka&quot;.

===In Rusyn===
In Rusyn, it denotes a sound that is a bit harder than and similar to the Romanian sound &quot;î&quot;, which is also written &quot;â&quot;. In some cases, the letter may occur after palatalised consonants ( &quot;blue&quot;, which never happens in Russian), and it often follows , , and .

===In Turkic languages===
The letter is also used in Cyrillic-based alphabets of several Turkic and Mongolic languages (see the list) for a darker vowel . The corresponding letter in Latin-based scripts are (dotless I), I with bowl (Ь ь), and (in Turkmen).

In Tuvan, the Cyrillic letter can be written as a double vowel.

<text>Э э (Э э; italics: &quot;Э э&quot;; also known as backwards ye, from Russian , &quot;ye oborótnoye&quot;, ) is a letter found in three Slavic languages: Russian, Belarusian, and West Polesian. It represents the vowels and , as the e in the word &quot;editor&quot;. In other Slavic languages that use the Cyrillic script, the sounds are represented by Ye (Е е), which represents in Russian and Belarusian in initial and postvocalic position or with palatalization of the preceding consonant. This letter closely resembles and should not be confused with the older Cyrillic letter Ukrainian Ye (Є є), of which Э is a reversed version.

In Cyrillic Moldovan, which was used in the Moldovan SSR during the Soviet Union and is still used in Transnistria, the letter corresponds to ă in the Latin Romanian alphabet, and the phoneme [ə]. It is also used in the Cyrillic alphabets used by Mongolian and many Uralic, Caucasian and Turkic languages of the former Soviet Union.

==Origin==
The letter originated in the thirteenth century as a variant of , at first, according to Đorđić in superscripted line-final position, but by the end of the century elsewhere as well. In the following centuries it continued to appear sporadically as an uncommon variant of , but not later than in the fifteenth century amongst the Eastern Slavs it began to be used to indicate initial (uniotated) . According to Yefim Karskiy, &quot;Western Russian ustav knows , e.g. in Miscellany of the 15th c. from the Public Library (manuscr. #391) ( etc.), chronicles of 15th-16th cc., Miscellany of Poznań (16th c.), Statut of 1588... It is difficult to say whether it has been developed here independently or it came from South Slavic manuscripts, where occurs as early as in 13-14th cc.&quot; Although the revision of Meletius Smotrytsky’s grammar published in Moscow in 1648 does not include in its alphabet, it does consistently write (&quot;Etymologia&quot;), in contrast to in the first edition of 1619. It was by no means confined to this function in the period, however, as the prevalent spellings (beside ) for modern Russian , demonstrate.

== In modern Russian==

In the specimens of the civil script presented to Peter I in 1708, forms of were included among forms of , but the latter was deleted by Peter. The former was used in some early 18th-century Russian texts, but some authorities of the period considered it superfluous, like Mikhail Lomonosov, on the grounds that &quot;the letter Е, having several different pronunciations, could serve in the pronoun and the interjection &quot; and that it was inappropriate to introduce letters solely for use in loanwords. However, the inclusion of in its modern function, in the Russian Academy&#x27;s Dictionary of 1789–94, marks the point from which it can be considered as an established part of the Russian orthographical standard.

There were still some objections to the letter even as late as 1817, when M. T. Kačenovskij was questioning whether &quot;yet another hard э&quot; was necessary when the language already had &quot;a soft ѣ and a hard е&quot;.

In contemporary Russian, is used to represent , in initial position ( &#x27;electricity&#x27;) and postvocalic position ( &#x27;duel&#x27;). Among such words are only a few native Russian roots: (это &#x27;this is&#x27;, этот/эта/это &#x27;this (m./f./n.)&#x27;, эти &#x27;these&#x27;, поэтому &#x27;thus&#x27; etc.), (экий &#x27;what a&#x27;), / (эдак/этак &#x27;that way&#x27;, эдакий/этакий &#x27;sort of&#x27;) and a few interjections like &#x27;hey&#x27;, &#x27;uh, oh&#x27;, &#x27;uh&#x27;.

Even though Russian contains a significant number of loanwords in which occurs after a hard (unpalatalised) consonant, it is still the practice to use the letter for , : (tennis, sepsis). There are few traditional exceptions to that practice among common noun loanwords:
* the original list (the first half of the 20th century) contained just three words:
** &#x27;mayor&#x27;, from French 
** &#x27;peer (a noble)&#x27;, from French 
** &#x27;sir&#x27;, from English or from Old French 
* two later additions (1950s-1960s):
** &#x27;master, skilled artist&#x27;, from French 
** , from French 
* new additions (1980s and later) are more numerous:
** &#x27;racket, racketeering&#x27;, from English
** &#x27;rap (music)&#x27;, from English
** &#x27;fantasy (literature)&#x27;, from English
** and several others; spelling of new words sometimes varies and dictionaries often give variants or contradict one another (like &#x27;hatchback (car)&#x27; in spelling dictionary vs / in explanatory dictionary ).

In proper nouns, however, may occur after consonants: &#x27;Ulan-Ude&#x27; and &#x27;Blair&#x27;. However, many such loanwords are spelled with : &#x27;Blériot&#x27; (a French aviator). That is the case especially for names that entered the language centuries ago like: , &#x27;Berlin&#x27;. The use of is much more frequent for names from non-European languages: &#x27;Mao Zedong&#x27;.

The letter is also used in Russian to render initial œ in foreign words: thus (the river in France) is written . After consonants this is transcribed as . In the 19th century, some writers used for that sound in both positions, but that was never accepted as standard orthography. (The letter was re-invented in the 20th century for Kildin Sami.) It is also used to represent a stressed in languages such as English, which can cause a problem of conflating with English (for example, &quot;Addison&quot; and &quot;Edison&quot; would be spelled the same). However, in other positions, Russian also uses for and for .

== In modern Belarusian==
Unlike Russian, Belarusian has many native words in which it occurs after a hard consonant. Moreover, its orthography was standardized later than that of Russian (which reached its present form at the beginning of the 20th century), on the basis of the spoken language rather than historical tradition. Consequently, and are written in accordance with pronunciation: for initial and after hard consonants, for initial and postvocalic and after soft consonants. That also means that is much more frequent in Belarusian than in Russian.

==In other languages==
In Tuvan the Cyrillic letter can be written as a double vowel.

In the Tajik language, the letters е and э have the same function, except that э is used at the beginning of a word (ex. Эрон, &quot;Iran&quot;).

In Mongolian, э is the standard letter to represent the /ɛ/ phoneme. It is often written doubled to represent the /eː/ phoneme. Е, however, is only used in the few Mongolian words containing it, Russian loanwords and Russian-style transcriptions of foreign names.

<text>Trebisonda &quot;Ondina&quot; Valla (20 May 1916 – 16 October 2006) was an Italian female athlete, and the first Italian woman to ever win an Olympic gold medal. She won it in the 80 m hurdles event at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, after establishing the new world record during the semi-final.

==Biography==
Born in Bologna, last after four brothers, she was named Trebisonda – a very unusual name for the country – after the Turkish town of Trabzon ( in Italian), which her father considered one of the most beautiful cities in the world. However, she was nicknamed &quot;Ondina&quot;, meaning &quot;little wave&quot;.

Ondina Valla stood out for her personality and her sports talent even as a young girl. She rivalled with Claudia Testoni at the school championships in their hometown, and they would remain opponents for the rest of their careers. Aged 13, Ondina Valla was already considered one of Italy&#x27;s top athletes. The following year she became national champion and was capped for the national team.

She was a versatile athlete, capable of excellent results in sprint events, hurdles races and jumps. She soon became a favorite with Italian sports fans. For the fascist government she was the ideal icon of the healthy, strong national youth. Media defined her &quot;the sun in a smile&quot;.

Her most important achievement was the gold medal of 80 m hurdles race at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. On 5 August she won the semi-final in 11.6, a new world record. On the following day she ran the final. It was a tight race, with four athletes rushing together at the finish line. There were no doubts about Valla&#x27;s victory, but a photofinish picture was needed to award the silver and bronze medals. Valla&#x27;s lifelong rival, Claudia Testoni, finished fourth, without a medal. Valla and Testoni were also members of the Italian 4 × 100 m relay team which finished fourth.

The victory of Valla was important for the Fascist regime and the hostility of many leaders for the participation of women in athletic competitions started to decrease. Mussolini used the victory of the Italian athlete for propaganda, as a demonstration of the strength of the Italian race.

After those Olympic Games, Ondina Valla was forced to limit her competitions because of back problems. However, she still continued to compete until the early 1940s.

<text>Camillo Castiglioni (22 October 1879 – 18 December 1957) was an Italian-Austrian Jewish financier and banker, and was the wealthiest man in Central Europe during World War I. Nicknamed &quot;Austrian Stinnes&quot;, he was active in aviation&#x27;s pioneering days and invested in the arts. Castiglioni was credited as being instrumental to the founding of what would eventually become BMW AG.

==Early life==
Castiglioni was born in Trieste, then part of Austria-Hungary, to the chief rabbi. His older brother was Arturo Castiglioni. It is not known when Camillo developed his interest in aviation, but it is known that he was passionate about flying. Camillo&#x27;s education was primarily law, gaining employment as an attorney and legal officer of a bank in Padua, quickly learning international finance and how to manage capital.

He was the son of a rubber maker, so naturally Camillo found work with the Austro-American &quot;Gummiwarenfabrik AG&quot; (rubber products) in Vienna as an agent for the Kaufmann automobile tire division in Constantinople. Camillo found great success in this position, demonstrating his abilities to negotiate and structure financial deals. In fact, Camillo was so successful, he was promoted to director of the export department of the parent company in Vienna.

Around 1901, along with Viktor Silberer and Franz Hinterstoissera Camillo helped to create the Viennese aero club (later Austrian aero club). He eventually was made deputy director, then in 1904 he was appointed to general director of the company. Through his experience in the rubber and tire production field, Camillo saw the birth of aviation as an industry, going from a ballooning hobby, to makeshift glider craft requiring tires, to fully operational aircraft operated by engines. He met many influential men in his business, and came to realize that aviation sparked not only his passion for flight, but also recognized the tremendous financial opportunity of aviation&#x27;s potential as an industry.

In order to draw from the arising enthusiasm for airplanes and ballooning, as well as to take advantage of the lucrative business the hobby generated, Camillo established one of his first companies, Luftfahrzeug-Gesellschaft, in 1907. Being a pure commercial firm – it acquired the Etrich balloon patents and sold balloon fliers in Austria Hungary. There were many contests that these inspired balloon drivers entered, and Camillo was no different- he bought his own balloon and successfully took his balloon driver examination on 24 August 1909.

==Aviation financing==
During the First World War, he became one of the richest and most influential financiers in Central Europe.

The first major investor in the series production of aircraft. In 1914, he purchased the German aircraft company Hansa- und Brandenburgische Flugzeugwerke, which employed Ernst Heinkel as its chief designer. Acquired a majority holding in Austro-Daimler with its chief designers Puch and Porsche. Press &quot;czar&quot; and sponsor of the arts (financed Max Reinhardt and helped him to organize the Salzburg Festival). After a series of setbacks, his financial empire broke up in 1926. He retired to Switzerland, then to Milan where he set up a private bank and once again amassed a considerable fortune. After the Second World War, negotiated a large US loan for his friend Josip Broz Tito in Yugoslavia. When Tito refused to pay his commission, Castiglioni succeeded in getting Yugoslavian assets in Italy worth millions sequestered. In 1916, he was awarded the Franz Joseph Order with ribbon on the Military Service Cross for his services to aviation and in 1918 with the St-Georges Order for his achievements in the war material production.

Castiglioni became rich in ventures during the period of inflation, acquiring a majority interest in Alpine Montan AG. The Austrian aviation company Österreichische Luftfahrtsgesellschaft was founded by him.

==BMW influence==
Castiglioni significantly influenced the development of BMW AG in its early years. The granting of a license agreement by Austro-Daimler to the Rapp-Werke in 1917 was partly attributable to Castiglioni. 1918 At Castiglioni&#x27;s insistence the Wiener Bankverein acquired the majority of BMW&#x27;s share capital. 1922 Castiglioni purchased all the equipment relating to engine construction, the associated know-how and the rights to the name &quot;Bayerische Motoren Werke AG&quot; from the BMW AG, which was renamed Süddeutsche Bremse AG. Castiglioni in turn renamed the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke to BMW AG and allowed the renamed company to continue production at the BFW plant. From the establishment of BMW AG until November 9, 1922 and then from 1924 to 1929, he was a member of the Supervisory Board and President of BMW AG. 1928 Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board.

His was one of the voices that urged BMW in 1928 to purchase the Eisenach Automobilwerke. Due to financial difficulties in 1929 he was obliged to surrender his holding of BMW shares to a consortium of banks (Deutsche Bank, Disconto, Bankhaus Hagen etc.).

A consortium led by the Deutsche Bank and the Diskonto-Gesellschaft purchased the BMW shares previously held by Camillo Castiglioni, who was facing problems of liquidity.

==Failed speculation and bankruptcy==
In February 1924, Castiglioni partnered with Fritz Mannheimer, and later other influential bankers to speculate on the devaluation of the French franc. They shorted hundreds of millions of franc, eventually causing the franc to drop almost 40% in less than a month. By the beginning of March 1924, one United States dollar was worth 28 francs. Then, however, investment bank Lazard, on the behalf of Banque de France and powered by J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., bought immense amounts of francs, causing the franc to rise again, to 15 franc per dollar. Castiglioni, Mannheimer and their partners lost millions.

In September 1924, the Austrian Depositenbank, of which Castiglioni had been president, collapsed. A warrant for his arrest on a charge of fraud was issued, but Castiglioni had taken care to be in Italy when the crash came. The Austrian State said that if he deposited $4,200,000 ($ in present-day value), he could return unmolested.

==Philanthropy==
Castiglioni built up a large art collection and a theatre in Vienna. He was the richest man in Central Europe and much beloved by the Viennese whom he assisted financially on Sundays and odd occasions. He was also a patron of the arts and for some time supported the famed producer Max Reinhardt, for whom he built a theater. So fond was he of appearing in the public limelight that he lived with all the pomp and ceremony of royalty, even traveling in the Kaiser Karl&#x27;s private parlor car, which he bought.

Because of his famous banking activities, his life was documented in a 1988 movie on television titled &quot;Camillo Castiglioni oder die Moral der Haifische&quot; (in English: &quot;Camillo Castiglioni, or the morality of sharks&quot;), directed by Peter Patzak.

<text>Price is a patronymic name derived from the Welsh &quot;ap Rhys&quot; meaning &quot;son of Rhys&quot;. The given name Rhys means &quot;enthusiasm&quot; in Welsh. It is a common surname among those of Welsh ancestry. At the time of the British Census of 1881, its frequency was highest in Radnorshire (38.2 times the British average), followed by Brecknockshire, Herefordshire, Monmouthshire, Flintshire, Shropshire, Denbighshire, Glamorgan, Carmarthenshire and Worcestershire. The surname has many other spellings including Priess, Priesz, and many others.

The name is thought to have originally been spelled &quot;Pryce&quot; and pronounced &quot;Preese&quot;. Name experts believe that the change of the &quot;y&quot; to &quot;i&quot; and the subsequent change in pronunciation was originally an affectation meant to make the name seem more English and therefore more prestigious.

<doc id="866242" wikidata="Q736823" url="?curid=866242" title="Serge Vohor">
<text>Rialuth Serge Vohor (23 April 1955 – 22 November 2024) was a Vanuatuan politician. He hailed from the largest island of Vanuatu, Espiritu Santo, from Port Olry.

Vohor was a member of the Union of Moderate Parties, a centrist political party, until 2022. When his party came to power in 1991, Vohor became foreign minister of Vanuatu for the first of three times, until 1993. Vohor has been Prime Minister four times, from December 1995 to February 1996; from September 1996 to March 1998; from 28 July 2004, to 11 December 2004; and from 24 April 2011 to 13 May 2011. The latter, brief term was however voided by the Court of Appeal, deeming his election unconstitutional as he had been elected only by a majority of Members of Parliament (26 out of 52), not by an absolute majority.

In October 2015, Vohor was one of 15 MPs to be convicted of bribery by the Vanuatu Supreme Court and was jailed for three years. Vohor was Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Kilman government at the time of his conviction.

==Second term as prime minister and aftermath==
In October 1996, during his second term as prime minister, he was abducted along with President Jean-Marie Léyé by members of the paramilitary Vanuatu Mobile Force, &quot;disgruntled over a pay dispute&quot;. Both men were soon released unharmed. In 1997, while still serving as prime minister, he was implicated in a scheme to sell Vanuatuan passports to foreigners, and the Office of the Vanuatu Ombudsman recommended that he resign from his post.

After the 1998 parliamentary elections the Union of Moderate Parties could not form a coalition government, but Vohor still served as a prominent member of coalition governments led by other parties much of the time, serving as foreign minister again from 1999 until 2001. His party did not regain power in the 2002 parliamentary elections, but Vohor served as foreign minister for a third time from 2002 until 2003.

==Third term as prime minister==
In the parliamentary elections of 2004, the Union of Moderate Parties lost several seats. However, Vohor managed to form a coalition including independents and members of other parties to be elected Prime Minister. Vohor was elected Prime Minister by the Parliament with 28 votes, with his opponent, Ham Lini receiving 24. The following month, Vohor formed a national unity government with Lini as deputy prime minister.

While abroad, Vohor was charged with contempt for comments he had made in parliament about Chief Justice Vincent Lunabek, but in September 2004 the Supreme Court threw out the charges on the grounds that Vohor had not been given the proper chance to defend himself in court, and that, furthermore, his comments were protected by parliamentary privilege.

Vohor gained international attention when, on 3 November 2004, while on a secret visit to Taipei, he established diplomatic relations with the Republic of China (Taiwan) without approval from the Council of Ministers. The Council of Ministers voted to void the move and asserted Vanuatu&#x27;s continued recognition of the People&#x27;s Republic of China under its terms of the One-China policy. For weeks, both the ROC and PRC had diplomatic missions in Vanuatu with disagreement in the government over which government to recognize. On 1 December, Vohor punched (or pushed) the shoulder of the new ambassador from Beijing, Bao Shusheng, after being approached to explain why the flag of the Republic of China was still flying over a hotel in Port Vila. After 16 members of parliament who had supported Vohor joined the opposition, depriving him of a majority and leaving him with 15 out of 52 seats, the opposition tried to hold a no-confidence vote against Vohor. Vohor attempted to prevent the vote in court, claiming that a new constitutional amendment barred no-confidence votes against a prime minister during his first year in office, but the Supreme Court ruled against him on 7 December, saying that the vote could go ahead because the new amendment had not yet been approved by referendum. Vohor then took the matter to the Court of Appeal, but it also ruled against him; he was defeated in the no-confidence vote and replaced by Ham Lini.

==Later career==
After then Vohor was effectively the leader of the opposition. In March 2006, Vohor led an attempt to depose Lini through a no confidence vote, focusing on accusing Lini of weakness. However, the vote was defeated as not enough Parliament members who had supported the government defected.

On 27 July 2007, Vohor, who was serving as Minister of Public Utilities, allegedly assaulted an official from the Finance Ministry due to his pay being delayed. Despite this allegation, there was no evidence to substantiate the assault ever taking place. In a cabinet reshuffle a few days later, he was one of several ministers dismissed from the government. Vohor said that one reason the UMP was being excluded from the government was because of its strength, and said that the party would try to return to the government.

After the 2 September 2008 general elections Vohor and his Union of Moderate Parties initially aligned itself with the opposition block which gave its support to Vanuatu Republican Party&#x27;s Maxime Carlot Korman for the post of Prime Minister.

When a motion of no confidence was tabled against new Prime Minister Edward Natapei, Serge Vohor and his MPs initially supported the no confidence motion; however, he eventually withdrew his signature to be in Natapei&#x27;s government as its new Minister of Infrastructure and Public Utilities.

==Fourth term as prime minister==
On 24 April 2011 (Easter Sunday), Prime Minister Sato Kilman was narrowly ousted by a parliamentary vote of no confidence, by twenty-six votes to twenty-five. Usually, the opposition, led by Edward Natapei, had not fielded a candidate to succeed him. Parliament thus elected Serge Vohor to the post.

His election was declared invalid on 13 May 2011, as he had been elected only by a relative majority in Parliament, not an absolute one.

==Subsequent career==
On 23 March 2013, new Prime Minister Moana Carcasses Kalosil appointed him Minister for Health. He lost office when the Carcasses government was brought down by a motion of no confidence on 15 May 2014.

In June 2015, following a further change of government, Vohor became Minister of Foreign Affairs in the government of Sato Kilman.

In October 2015, Serge Vohor, together with several other MPs, was convicted of bribery by the Vanuatu Supreme Court. Vohor was found to have accepted 1,000,000 vatu from Moana Carcasses MP, in return for support in a motion of no-confidence against the government of Joe Natuman. At one point during the trial, Vohor attacked a photographer outside the court house. Vohor was sentenced to three years imprisonment for his involvement in the bribery scandal. He was also convicted for conspiring to pervert the course of justice. He served 18 months in jail. He was pardoned by the President of Vanuatu, Tallis Obed Moses, in September 2021, which restores his eligibility to run for public office again.

In August 2022, he launched a leadership bid once again for the UMP, this time losing to Ishmael Kalsakau by a vote of 45 delegates to 22. After his defeat, Vohor left the party after more than 30 years and formed a new party called the Pikinini blong Graon (Children of the Land) Movement in September.

==Death==
Vohor died on Espiritu Santo on 22 November 2024, aged 69.

In human sexuality, the term scoptophilia describes the sexual pleasure that a person derives from looking at prurient objects of eroticism, such as pornography, the nude body, and fetishes, as a substitute for actual participation in a sexual relationship.

==Psychoanalysis==
As explained by psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, Sigmund Freud used the term &quot;scopophilia&quot; to describe, analyze, and explain the concept of , the pleasure in looking, a curiosity which he considered a partial-instinct innate to the childhood process of forming a personality; and that such a pleasure-instinct might be sublimated, either into Aesthetics, looking at &quot;objets d&#x27;art&quot; or sublimated into an obsessional neurosis &quot;a burning and tormenting curiosity to see the female body&quot;, which afflicted the Rat Man patient of the psychoanalyst Freud. From that initial interpretation of &quot;Schaulust&quot; arose the psycho-medical belief that the inhibition of the &quot;scopic drive&quot; might lead to actual, physical illness, such as physiologic disturbances of vision and eyesight. In contrast to Freud&#x27;s interpretation of the &quot;scopic drive&quot;, other psychoanalytic theories proposed that the practices of scopophilia might lead to madness — either insanity or a mental disorder — which is the scopophilic person&#x27;s retreat from the concrete world of reality into an abstract world of fantasy.

The theoretic bases of scopophilia were developed by the psychoanalyst Otto Fenichel, in special reference to the process and stages of psychological identification. That in developing a personal identity, &quot;a child, who is looking for libidinous purposes ... wants to look at an object in order [for it] to &#x27;feel along with him&#x27;.&quot; That the impersonal interaction of scopophilia (between the looker and the looked-at) sometimes replaced personal interactions in the psychological life of a person who is socially anxious, and seeks to avoid feelings of guilt.

Lacan&#x27;s conceptual development of &quot;the gaze&quot; linked the pleasure of scopophilia to the person&#x27;s apprehension of the Other (person) who is not the Self; that is: &quot;The gaze is this object lost, and suddenly re-found, in the conflagration of shame, by the introduction of the Other.&quot; The practice of scopophilia is how a person&#x27;s &quot;desire&quot; is captured by the imaginary representation of the Other. Theories alternative to Lacan&#x27;s interpretations of scopophilia and the gaze proposed that a child&#x27;s discovery of genital difference, and the accompanying anxiety about not knowing the difference of the Other sex, is the experience that subsequently impels the child&#x27;s scopic drive to fulfil the desire to look and to look at.

==Literary examples==
* The &quot;Satyricon&quot; (&quot;The Book of Satyr-like Adventures&quot;, AD 1st c.), by Gaius Petronius Arbiter, presents the scopophilic description of a priestess of Priapus as the woman who was &quot;the first to put an inquisitive eye to a crack she had naughtily opened, and spy on their play with prurient eagerness.&quot;
* In &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (1605) by &quot;Miguel de Cervantes&quot; Cardenio takes his false friend Fernando to Luscinda&#x27;s window so they could observe her surreptitiously: &quot;showed her to him one night by the light of a taper at a window, where we used to converse together. She appeared to him, though in an undress, so charming as to blot out of his memory all the beauties he had ever seen before&quot; For Frederick A. de Armas, the window frames a scene that recalls the erotic paintings of the Renaissance, exhibited in Spanish palaces, thus heightening the scopophilia through works of art 
* &quot;Secret Sexualities: A Sourcebook of 17th and 18th Century Writing&quot; (2003), by Ian McCormick, shows that transgressive sexuality is composed of the inter-relationships between the public and the private spheres and between the open and the secret aspects of a person&#x27;s life. The example is &quot;Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure&quot; (1749), in which the protagonist Fanny Hill gives her scoptophilic observations of two sodomites, which include descriptions of the furnishings and the &quot;décor&quot; of the room in which they are copulating: &quot; .. . at length I observed a paper patch of the same colour as the wainscot, which I took to conceal some flaw; but then it was so high that I was obliged to stand upon a chair to reach it, which I did, as soft as possible, and, with a point of a bodkin, soon pierced it, and opened myself espial room sufficient. And now, applying my eye close, I commanded the room perfectly, and could see my two young sparks romping and pulling one another about, entirely, to my imagination, in frolic and innocent play.”

==Race==
Critical race theorists, such as bell hooks, Shannon Winnubst, and David Marriott present and describe scopophilia and the scopic drive as the psychological and social mechanisms that realize the practices of Other-ing a person to exclude them from society (see also scopophobia). The social practice of scopophilia is supposed to fix the appearance and identity of the Other (person), who is not the Self, by way of the gaze that objectifies and dehumanizes them as &quot;not I&quot; and thus &quot;not one of us&quot;. In that vein, the practices of cultural scopophilia restrict the number and type of visible representations of &quot;outsiders&quot; in a society.

==Cinema==
In &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960), directed by Alfred Hitchcock, the protagonist Norman Bates is a voyeur whose motel rooms feature peepholes. In the course of the story, the motel manager Norman spies upon the anti-heroine as she undresses in her ostensibly private room. In &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; (1960), directed by Michael Powell, scopophilia is mentioned as a psychological affliction of the protagonist, Mark Lewis. As narrative cinema, &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; is a deliberate exercise in voyeurism for the protagonist and for the spectator, which demonstrates how readily the protagonist and the spectator are mentally willing and morally capable of watching atrocities (torture, mutilation, death) that should not be gazed upon as narrative movies. The mentally ill protagonist acted as he acted consequent to severe mental mistreatment in boyhood, by his film-maker father; the paternal abuse mentally malformed Mark into a reclusive, introverted man comfortable with torturing and killing people.

In the 1970s, parting from Lacan&#x27;s propositions, psychoanalysts of the cinema used the term scopophilia to identify and to describe the aesthetic and emotional pleasures (often pathological), and other unconscious mental processes that occur in the minds of spectators gazing at a film. Yet voyeurism and the male gaze are psychological practices basic to the spectators&#x27; emotional experience of viewing mainstream, commercial cinema; notably, the male gaze is fully presented, described, and explained, and contrasted with the female gaze, in the essay &quot;Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema&quot; (1975), by Laura Mulvey. Subsequent scholars have challenged Mulvey&#x27;s influential reading of scopophilia as a &quot;gross reduction of the erotic and the aesthetic to the politics of representation.&quot;

<text>Gumball 3000 is a brand known for the annual Gumball 3000 Rally, an international celebrity motor rally that takes place on public roads. The brand was founded in 1999 by English entrepreneur Maximillion Cooper, with his vision to combine cars, music, fashion and popular culture.

==Rally format==
The Gumball 3000 Rally takes approximately 120 vehicles across multiple countries on a 3,000 mile journey that takes place across 6 days – occasionally including continental travel via cargo planes to transport vehicles by air. Entrants travel on public roads and use a mixture of vehicles ranging from custom classic cars to hypercars, and attend a VIP party, dinner or event each night. The rally features a number of exclusive experiences along the route that includes lunchtime checkpoints and overnight stops in major cities, where major public roads are often closed down to traffic for access of participating vehicles. The rally was founded in 1999 by Maximillion Cooper, initially as a road trip with his friends. Organisers emphasise that the event is a road trip and in no way a race or competition, with their rally slogan reading &quot;It&#x27;s a rally, not a race&quot;.

Rally participants pay for their entry. The entry fee is cited as around $75,000 in Toronto Life, while a new participant quoted in The Globe and Mail said $85,000 and a repeat participant said their rate was around $50,000.

Rally participants are split evenly each year between new and previous participants (referred to as &#x27;alumni&#x27;). Rally participants are referred to as &#x27;Gumballers&#x27;. 

==Rally history==

=== 1999–2004 ===
The Gumball 3000 was first launched in 1999. Maximillion Cooper started the event after he and a group of friends aimed to drive their supercars across Europe on a 3,000 mile journey that they referred to as a rally. The rally was aimed at friends of Cooper, with an initial entry fee of $8,700. Participants had to use their own vehicles.

The first event took inspiration from a number of racing events throughout the world. In 1933, motorcycle racer, Erwin Baker, had crossed the United States coast-to-coast in 54 hours. He earned the nickname &quot;Cannonball&quot; which spawned a number of race events in both the United States and Europe over the next few decades in his honor. The Cannonball events were held in the 1970s, with the first prize being a gumball machine. It has been suggested that this is the origin of the Gumball 3000 brand name.

The first event took place in 1999, with the journey starting in London and heading to Rimini, Italy before returning to London. Cooper planned different events on each night of the rally, ranging from parties to dinner events. The rally received extensive coverage in the British media due to the attendance of a number of high-profile figures including Kate Moss, Guy Ritchie and Kylie &amp; Dannii Minogue. 

Following the success of the first Gumball 3000 rally, the second event in 2000 began at the Marble Arch in London, before heading to Stansted airport to fly over to Spain. The rally then continued through Bilbao, Cannes, Milan, Hotel Bühlerhöhe Castle, Nürburgring GP circuit and Hamburg, before heading back to the starting city, London.

The cars that participated in the rally were filmed by MTV for a &quot;Jackass&quot; Special, with the episode earning MTV their highest ratings for the year. Entrants who featured in the 2001 rally included Formula One World Champion Damon Hill in a Lamborghini and comedian Vic Reeves who drove a Mercedes-AMG.
In 2002, the Gumball 3000 made the first coast-to-coast journey across the contiguous United States, from New York City to Los Angeles. Checkpoints along the route included a stop at the White House in Washington, D.C.; Graceland in Memphis, Tennessee; Texas; Santa Ana Pueblo, New Mexico; the Grand Canyon; Las Vegas; and, finally, the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles. Among the participants were fashion designer Donna Karan, models Jodie Kidd and Amy Wesson, and actor Matthew McConaughey.

In 2003, &quot;Gumball 3000: The Movie&quot; was released. It was a 98-minute 2003 film feature directed by Steven Green and narrated by the late Burt Reynolds.

The fifth Annual Gumball 3000 rally began in San Francisco on the west coast of America and finished Miami, Florida. The rally passed through Reno, Nevada; Las Vegas; Tucson, Arizona; White Sands, New Mexico; San Antonio, Texas; and New Orleans. Featured participants included Travis Pastrana, professional skateboarder Tony Hawk, who drove in a Dodge Viper the late &quot;Jackass&quot;&#x27; Ryan Dunn. 2004 saw the Gumball rally commence at the Eiffel Tower in Paris proceed through Biarritz, Madrid, Marbella, across the Mediterranean Sea to Marrakesh, Morocco, before returning to Barcelona for the Grand Prix and finishing in Cannes for the Cannes Film Festival. 

===2005–2009: Event growth===

Jenson Button waved the start flag of the 2005 Gumball 3000, that travelled from London to Monte Carlo. Entrants drove through Brussels, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Dubrovnik, Sicily, Rome and Florence, before crossing the finishing line in Monte Carlo. Models Caprice Bourret and Jodie Kidd joined singer Jay Kay from Jamiroquai, British rock band The Darkness and Ken Block in the list of celebrities taking part.

The 2006 starting flag was dropped in London where participants then travelled onto Vienna, Budapest and Belgrade, before jumping on a plane in Serbia to Thailand. The route then continued through Phuket and Bangkok, before flying to Salt Lake City and finishing with a party at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles. Travis Barker was present on the 2006 rally, as well as Martine McCutcheon, who drove a pink Range Rover in an all-female team. Gumball 3000 Films also produced a movie, &quot;3000 Miles,&quot; following five other entrants: skateboarders Tony Hawk, Bam Margera and Mike Vallely, BMX rider Mike Escamilla and Margera&#x27;s &quot;Jackass&quot; co-star, Ryan Dunn.
The 2007 route was scheduled to travel from London to Istanbul, via Amsterdam, Munich, Tirana, Dubrovnik, and Athens. Over 100 contestants including actors Tamer Hassan and Danny Dyer and model and entrepreneur Caprice Bourret were scheduled to drive through 16 countries in eight days. The entrance fee for the 2007 rally was £28,000 for first-time drivers. In the 2007 event, two people in North Macedonia died in a traffic incident involving a participating rally vehicle. The incident occurred on 2 May 2007, when a TechArt Porsche 997 Turbo driven by Nicholas Morley collided with a Volkswagen Golf, whose occupants were both killed. 

The organisers of the Gumball 3000 initially continued with the rally until the facts about the incident became clear, at which point rally organisers canceled the remainder of event as a mark of respect. The subsequent court hearing found Morley guilty and convicted him of &quot;endangering traffic, leading to death&quot;; he was released from custody after receiving a two-year suspended sentence. After the verdict, Morley&#x27;s family released a statement detailing its own expert&#x27;s findings, which contradict those of the prosecution&#x27;s expert.

In 2008, the rally travelled from San Francisco to China, finishing at the Beijing Olympics. The rally passed through Los Angeles, San Diego and Las Vegas before flying to Nanjing in China and spending a night in North Korea for the Mass Games.

=== 2010–2019 ===
More than 100 cars took part in the rally in 2010. The rally began in London and ended in New York, passing through Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Boston, Quebec City and Toronto. Michael Madsen joined the rally, but was forced to leave the rally in Belgium after his driver was stopped by police for speeding. A number of other celebrities took part in the event, including Idris Elba and Cypress Hill. It was on this rally that Cooper met Grammy-winning US rapper Eve, who he later married in 2014 at the end of that year&#x27;s rally.

Starting in London&#x27;s Covent Garden, the 2011 Gumball 3000 rally saw the entrants drive through Paris, Barcelona, Monaco, Venice, and Croatia, before finishing in Istanbul. Attendees of the launch party at the Playboy Club in London included Jo Wood, The Saturdays Vanessa White and former Pussycat Doll Melody Thornton. Participants in the rally included David Hasselhoff, Eve, Xzibit and Tony Hawk.

The 2012 rally was a &#x27;Sea to Shining Sea&#x27; route in the US from New York to Los Angeles, stopping in Toronto, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Santa Fe and Las Vegas.

In 2013 Chernin Entertainment and Warner Bros acquired the rights to produce and develop a film based around the Gumball 3000 rally.

In 2014, and with a cost for participants rising to a rumoured £40,000, the rally started in the United States in Miami, before passing through Atlanta and New York City before flying to Western Europe to conclude the rally, travelling from Edinburgh and continuing through London, Paris and Barcelona, before finally culminating on the island of Ibiza. 

During the 2014 event, deadmau5 and his co-driver Tory Belleci drove a Nyan Cat inspired Ferrari 458 Spider named &#x27;Purrari&#x27; that received a cease-and-desist order from Ferrari. The car was listed on Craigslist following the rally and was sold for $380,000.

In 2015 participants followed a transatlantic route from Stockholm to Las Vegas. Stops included Norway, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Reno, San Francisco and Los Angeles, with a drive through Death Valley before reaching Las Vegas. Lewis Hamilton joined the final stage of the rally from Los Angeles to Las Vegas driving a Koenigsegg Agera HH. 

The 2016 rally was from Dublin to Bucharest. David Hasselhoff waved the start flag in Dublin to mark the beginning of the rally. The route took participants from Dublin to Edinburgh, London, Rust, Prague and Budapest before ending in Bucharest. Other famous faces that took part were F1 drivers David Coulthard and Jean Alesi, Grammy-winning rapper Eve, Dutch DJ Afrojack, Major Lazer, rapper Bun B, pop star Marlon Roudette, music producer Dallas Austin, Sullivan Stapleton, reality star Calum Best and YouTuber Calfreezy. The 2016 Gumball rally featured a one-off &#x27;Batmobile&#x27; based on a Lamborghini Gallardo, driven by Team Galag. It is estimated that over one million fans attended the 2016 rally across all locations.

In 2017, the rally began on 1 July from Riga, passing through Warsaw, Kraków, Budapest, Dubrovnik, Porto Montenegro, Tirana, Volos, then Athens, and finally to Mykonos for two days.

2018 saw the return of intercontinental travel as part of a rally route. The rally began on 5 August starting in London, passing through Domaine De Chantilly in France, Sforza Castle in Milan, Italy and heading to Bologna to fly on &quot;Gumball Air&quot; (A Malaysian Airlines airplane hired by organisers, which stopped in Kazakhstan to refuel) to head to Osaka, Japan. All participating vehicles were flown to Japan via two cargo planes. From Osaka the rally headed to Kyoto, Nanao before crossing the finish line in Tokyo. 

The 2019 Gumball 3000 Rally took place in June, starting in Mykonos, Greece, before finishing on the Spanish island of Ibiza. The rally passed through Thessaloniki, Greece, Porto Montenegro, Montenegro, Venice, Italy, Monaco and Barcelona, Spain. Dutch DJ Afrojack participated in a Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse and a Bugatti Chiron in matching blue camo livery. 

=== 2020–present ===
In 2020, the Gumball 3000 Rally was due to head from Toronto, Canada to Havana, Cuba, however the rally was cancelled due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was the first time a full rally had been cancelled in Gumball 3000&#x27;s history. The rally was eventually further postponed to May 2022 due to continued concerns surrounding the pandemic in 2021.

In May 2022 the postponed 22nd Annual Rally took place from Toronto, Canada to Miami, United States. The rally was originally intended to finish in Havana, Cuba, however organisers changed finish line locations due to concerns caused by Cuba&#x27;s relationship with Russia following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in March 2022.

The May 2022 rally began on 27 May with a free public concert in Toronto&#x27;s Yonge-Dundas Square featuring performances from local artists and headline performances from rapper Bun B and deadmau5. The flag drop event took place in the same location the following day, with David Hasselhoff returning to drop the flag. The rally then travelled via Indianapolis (the Gumball participants watched the Indy 500 race with VIP hospitality), Nashville and Atlanta before crossing the finish line at the Inter Miami&#x27;s DRV PNK Stadium, where the inaugural Gumball Goodwill Cup Charity Football Match took place, featuring the Gumball All-Stars XI facing a Laureus Sport for Good World XI. 

For the first time in Gumball 3000 history, and in reaction to the cancelled 2020 &amp; 2021 rallies, Gumball 3000 hosted two rallies in one year, with the &#x27;Middle East&#x27; rally taking place in November 2022. The rally route began in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and travelled a circular route through Oman via Jebel Akhdar, Salalah and Muscat before heading back into the UAE via Ras Al Khaimah, where Gumball 3000 joined the Global Citizen Forum Charity Gala. The rally crossed the finish line on 18 November in Abu Dhabi at the W Hotel, where Gumball participants enjoyed VIP Hospitality at the finale of the 2022 Formula One Season, the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. A number of new celebrity participants joined for this rally, including influencers Yung Filly and Michael Dapaah, and rapper French Montana, who performed at the opening concert in Dubai.

In June 2023, Gumball 3000 returned to Europe with a European Tour – the first time the rally had come to Europe for four years. The rally began on 10 June in Edinburgh, Scotland, before heading to London, England, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Verbier, Switzerland, Venice, Italy and Budapest, Hungary, before crossing the finish line in the coastal resort of Porto Montenegro.

== Apparel, brand partnerships &amp; popular culture ==
Since the establishment of Gumball 3000, the brand&#x27;s popularity led to the launch of Gumball Apparel. Apparel is designed in-house, with designs influenced by previous Gumball 3000 events and motorsport.

Since the launch of the apparel brand, there have been a number of capsule collections released in collaboration with major fashion houses. These collaborations have included Puma, Adidas and Nixon. Since 2019, Gumball 3000 has partnered with eyewear brand Carrera for a number of limited-edition eyewear releases. Adidas subsequently withdrew its multi-million dollar sponsorship following a fatal accident in 2007 which resulted in the death of a person in a car not part of the event.

<doc id="866254" wikidata="Q920503" url="?curid=866254" title="Lift Your Skinny Fists like Antennas to Heaven">
<text>Lift Your Skinny Fists like Antennas to Heaven is the second studio album by Canadian post-rock band Godspeed You! Black Emperor, released as a double album on 9 October 2000 on vinyl by Constellation and on CD by Kranky. The album consists of four 20-minute songs divided into movements, usually consisting of instrumental crescendos, with occasional use of field recordings. Though the band&#x27;s output is politically-motivated, the overall tone is more hopeful than their prior work. Recording was conducted in February 2000 in Chemical Sound Studios, Toronto, and was derived from the band&#x27;s live performances and guitarist Efrim Menuck&#x27;s experience in film-making studies. 

Packaging contains liner notes dedicating the album to prisoners, a diagram illustrating each of the movement&#x27;s sound, and William Schaff&#x27;s artwork from the zine &quot;Notes to a Friend; Silently Listening No. 2&quot;. The album has received critical acclaim, with many critics finding the composition to be beautiful and sprawling, though comparisons to the band&#x27;s prior discography were mixed. It has been listed on multiple year-end and decade-end lists.

==Background and composition==
Godspeed You! Black Emperor is a Montreal band formed in 1994; the band hails from the Canadian post-rock scene. The band&#x27;s label Constellation plays a central role, although both founder Ian Ilavsky and Godspeed You! Black Emperor guitarist Efrim Menuck have stated they see their music as more punk rock than post-rock. Godspeed You! Black Emperor&#x27;s politically motivated music output is primarily instrumental, being framed with field recordings and tape manipulation. According to &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; Andrew Paul, their early work leading up to &quot;Lift Your Skinny Fists like Antennas to Heaven&quot; &quot;[came] across like an attempt to blend divinity and human folly atop the same sonic canvas,&quot; with the music conveying humanity&#x27;s hopelessness and self-destruction.

Godspeed You! Black Emperor released three records in the 1990s: the self-released cassette &quot;All Lights Fucked on the Hairy Amp Drooling&quot; (1994), the studio album &quot;F♯ A♯ ∞&quot; (1997), and the EP &quot;Slow Riot for New Zero Kanada&quot; (1999). The band also regularly staged three-hour long live performances, including in major cities such as London, San Francisco, and New York City. During this time, they started receiving attention beyond the underground scene, with much critical analysis of their work. The band itself has typically avoided interviews and promotional material, citing concerns of misrepresentation of their work in the media and bafflement at their increased popularity. Two notable exceptions include their interviews for &quot;The Wire&quot; and &quot;NME&quot;, with the latter&#x27;s being a cover interview despite the cover not featuring a picture of the band.

&quot;Lift Your Skinny Fists like Antennas to Heaven&quot; is a post-rock album consisting of four 20-minute tracks divided into movements: &quot;Storm&quot;, &quot;Static&quot;, &quot;Sleep&quot;, and &quot;Antennas to Heaven&quot;. Godspeed You! Black Emperor recorded the album in Chemical Sound Studios, Toronto, in nine days in February 2000 with Daryl Smith, using material drawn from the band&#x27;s then-recent live performances. The instrumentation involved string instruments, guitars, pianos, and static. Most of the album is instrumental, often consisting of cresendoes from &quot;slow and vaporous&quot; music to &quot;towering waves of sound&quot; before dissipating. An exception is the use of field recordings, including a loudspeaker announcement from ARCO, a preacher&#x27;s religious rant, an old man musing about Coney Island, and a folk song performed by former band member Mike Moya. According to Menuck, the composition of the tracks drew upon his filmmaking studies, with him comparing the combining of musical pieces and field recordings to film editing. Compared to previous projects by Godspeed You! Black Emperor, &quot;Lift Your Skinny Fists like Antennas to Heaven&quot; is more progressive and hopeful. In a 2012 interview from &quot;the Guardian&quot;, the band collectively stated their intent from the beginning was to create &quot;heavy music, joyously&quot; that acknowledged yet dismissed the bleakness of contemporary times, contrary to popular belief. Jeanette Leech argued &quot;Lift Your Skinny Fists like Antennas to Heaven&quot; represented this ideal in &quot;Fearless: the Making of Post-Rock&quot;.

==Release and packaging==
&quot;Lift Your Skinny Fists like Antennas to Heaven&quot; was released as a double album on 9 October 2000 by Constellation in vinyl format and on 23 October 2000 by American record label Kranky in CD format. The typewritten liner notes jokingly refer to the band as &quot;god&#x27;s [&quot;sic&quot;] pee&quot;; refer to the songs as &quot;more awkward pirouettes in the general direction of hope [and] joy&quot; and &quot;a tentative stagger towards the pale [and] holy fading light&quot;; and dedicate the album to prisoners, alongside &quot;quiet refusals, loud refusals, and sad refusals.&quot; The inner panels of the vinyl edition and a paper insert in the CD edition uses a diagram drawn by Menuck to illustrate the album&#x27;s movements and sound. The diagram denotes the time length and name of each movement, and uses gradients to represent their intensity.

The album&#x27;s packaging contains artwork by William Schaff from a zine titled &quot;Notes to a Friend; Silently Listening No. 2&quot;, which dealt with his struggles as a young artist. Schaff first met Menuck at Hotel2Tango, bonding over their shared interests and themes of workers&#x27; plight. Later, after he left behind some of his work at Hotel2Tango, Menuck approached him for permission to use his work for the album. One image included in the packaging depicts Benjamin Franklin severing Schaff&#x27;s hands with shears as he is signing a lease, while another depicts Schaff, his wrists bandaged, witnessing George Washington and Franklin waving a pantsuit in front of a withdrawn woman. The cover art, depicting Schaff&#x27;s severed hands, was repurposed from &quot;Notes to a Friend; Silently Listening No. 2&quot; by John Arthur Tinholt.

&quot;Lift Your Skinny Fists like Antennas to Heaven&quot; entered into the UK charts, run by the Official Charts Company, on the week of 21 October 2000. The album was on the UK Independent Albums Charts for five weeks, peaking at number five, and was on two other charts for one week, peaking at number 66 for the UK Album Charts and number 69 for the Scottish Albums Charts.

==Reception==
&quot;Lift Your Skinny Fists like Antennas to Heaven&quot; garnered critical acclaim. On Metacritic, it has a score of 84 based on 13 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Critics have regarded the album to be beautiful and sprawling. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; called it &quot;a massive instrumental effort&quot; that is &quot;as skilled and musical as it is on-the-fly improvised and messy&quot;, and &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; calling it &quot;cinematic&quot; and &quot;breathtaking in its grandiose beauty&quot;. Highlighting the album&#x27;s uplifting nature and use of field recordings, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called &quot;Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas&quot; the &quot;best movie I&#x27;ve seen all year.&quot; Among more mixed reviews, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; found the album one-note but commended its compositional ambition, and &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted occasional &quot;passages of spellbinding beauty&quot; but found the listening experience uneven.

Critical comparisons with Godspeed You! Black Emperor&#x27;s prior discography were divided. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called the album &quot;as beautiful and disarming as its predecessors&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; assessed the first disc as representative of the band&#x27;s past work and the second disc to be &quot;the future&quot;, and AllMusic found the album overall to be less predictable due to its dynamic nature. In contrast, &quot;The Wire&quot; found the album to be more meaningless, with the radical nature of Godspeed You! Black Emperor&#x27;s music being &quot;reduced to rock gesture&quot; Both &quot;Spin&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; considered the album less consistent than the band&#x27;s prior work.

Retrospectively, critical reception of &quot;Lift Your Skinny Fists like Antennas to Heaven&quot; has remained positive. &quot;Tiny Mix Tapes&quot; called the album &quot;alternately hypnotic and captivating, sleepy and startling&quot; comparing its sounds to &quot;a far subtler Pink Floyd&quot;. &quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; gave the album a perfect score and, deeming the album indescribable, called upon the reader to listen to the album for themselves. In their 20th anniversary reviews, both &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; and &quot;Stereogum&quot; deemed the album as representative of the failures of capitalism in the 21st century and highly mythical and evocative. &quot;PopMatters&quot; positively emphasized the album&#x27;s instrumental and protesting nature.

The album went on to be included in numerous year-end and decade-end music lists. &quot;Magnet&quot; included it in its &quot;20 Best Albums of 2000&quot; list. &quot;NME&quot; ranked it number 16 in its &quot;Top 50 Albums of the Year&quot;. &quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; named it the 6th best album of the 2000s. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named it the 5th best album of the year and the 65th best album of the decade. They also ranked the first movement of the track &#x27;Storm&#x27; at #283 on their list of &quot;Top 500 tracks of the 2000s&quot;. Tiny Mix Tapes ranked it 7th on their &quot;Favorite 100 Albums of 2000–2009&quot; list. &quot;LAS Magazine&quot; ranked it the 14th greatest album of the decade. Gigwise included the album on its list of the 50 best albums of the 2000s. A 2020 BBC overview of double albums lists this as an &quot;honorable mention&quot; for releases that the audience needs to hear. &quot;Paste&quot; magazine placed this album on 6 in their list of 50 post-rock albums of all time.

In Vanuatu the speaker of parliament serves as the acting president when Parliament has not elected a new president, which was necessary after the impeachment of Alfred Maseng. Moli lost the position of acting president when Parliament and regional presidents were able to elect a new president on August 16, 2004. Moli was the fourth person to serve as President of Vanuatu in four months.?

He was succeeded by Kalkot Mataskelekele, who was elected president by the electoral college.
Moli also lost the position of speaker in December 2004, when the government of Serge Vohor, a member of his party, was replaced by a government under the leadership of Ham Lini. Moli is still a member of the Vanuatu parliament.

<text>In the philosophy of mind, the user illusion is a metaphor for a proposed description of consciousness that argues that conscious experience does not directly expose objective reality, but instead provides a simplified version of reality that allows humans to make decisions and act in their environment, akin to a computer desktop. According to this picture, our experience of the world is not immediate, as all sensation requires processing time. It follows that our conscious experience is less a perfect reflection of what is occurring, and more a simulation produced subconsciously by the brain. Therefore, there may be phenomena that exist beyond our peripheries, beyond what consciousness could create to isolate or reduce them.

The term &quot;user illusion&quot; was first introduced by Alan Kay, a computer scientist working on graphical user interfaces at Xerox PARC, to describe the illusion created by the user interface of a desktop computer. Tor Nørretranders explored as a metaphor for conscious experience in his book &quot;The User Illusion: Cutting Consciousness Down to Size&quot;, and the concept has been developed further by Daniel Dennett, who has also embraced the view that human consciousness is a &quot;user-illusion&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;user illusion&quot; was first used by Alan Kay, a computer scientist working on graphical user interfaces at Xerox PARC, to describe the illusion created by the user interface of a desktop computer. Kay noted that the visual metaphor of a desktop is merely a tool to create the simplified representation of the underlying complexity of the computer. This &quot;user illusion&quot; represents the computer as much simpler than it truly is, and, from the user&#x27;s perspective, is not just a human–computer interface that allows the user to not only act and make decisions when using the computer, but, in all purposes, is the computer itself. For example, computer designers create windows and folders, objects that only exist in the interface but allow the user to interact with the underlying complex programming.

==Applications==

===Information processing===
The notion that consciousness is a form of user illusion is explored by Tor Nørretranders in his 1991 book The User Illusion: Cutting Consciousness Down to Size. Norretranders approaches the problem of consciousness through the perspective of information processing, where he treats the human brain as a computer. He suggests that most of the work is taken care of at a subconscious level: we perceive around 12 million bits of information per second, among which 10 million capacity is reserved for vision, 1 million is for touch, and the rest is distributed for other senses. Despite this vast amount of information that is processed subconsciously, conscious information processing can only work at about 60 bits/sec. Thereby, consciousness acts as a filter to prune the information that is received by the senses into something a conscious experience can handle. This would also explain why we can only perceive and thus focus on a limited amount of objects at any time and why it takes great efforts to deal with something we encounter for the first time - that is because our brain has to work hard to learn how to filter new inputs. For example, it’s difficult to learn new skills in sports. Practice is necessary for your subconscious to learn the precise movement for each limb in order to coordinate. Thus, Norretranders postulates that when athletes report that they had too much time to think about their skills and mess up, it could be due to the fact that the thought process became slow enough that the conscious mind interfered and started to take over the control.

Benjamin Libet conducted an experiment that supports the idea of consciousness as a user illusion. This study investigated the relation between our conscious and unconscious mind. Subjects wired with measuring electrodes were asked to move a finger. A half-second before the decision is made to flex the muscle, an electrical signal is detected in the brain. Astonishingly, the &quot;decision&quot; seems to be made by unconscious neurons before the self becomes aware of its desire to act. This study suggests that consciousness is not the initiator. However, our subconscious minds process information and make decisions on what to distribute to our conscious mind before we are aware.

===Models of others and oneself===
Daniel Dennett suggests that although a human may not be able to understand everything that&#x27;s going on in the cell phone system, we can still use our phones smoothly by simple touches and nudges. Therefore, the user illusion simplifies life such that we are able to interact with the interface with only a few simplified steps, without knowing the underlying working principles. Thus, he claims that humans experience reality as a &quot;user-illusion&quot;, in which our conscious experience is a simplification of reality and allows us to seamlessly act in our world. Dennett claims that we benefit from this phenomenon, since &quot;It&#x27;s the brain&#x27;s &#x27;user illusion&#x27; of itself ... The brain doesn&#x27;t have to understand how the brain works&quot;. In addition, in our minds, we have developed models of others as &quot;conscious agents&quot;. When person A talks to person B, B does not have the access to A&#x27;s inner thoughts; however, B is able to gain a good sense of what&#x27;s going on in A&#x27;s mind and at the same time, A is able to convey such good ideas as well. Dennett says, &quot;Your consciousness is my user illusion of you and my consciousness is your user illusion of me.&quot; Meanwhile, humans have the model of oneself as well. Just as how A would approach B, by asking himself or herself questions and waiting for his or her own responses, A can get access to himself or herself as well such that we are probing our minds and getting ourselves to think and not think things as we wanted. By user illusion, we are manipulating our own brains.

===Evolutionary fitness===
Donald D. Hoffman explains how the user illusion may have originated from the selective pressures of Darwinism. Hoffman argues that although the classic argument is that evolutionary fitness was correlated with perceiving the truth about our environment, the fitness function need not be correlated with objective truth at all. According to Hoffman and colleague Chetan Prakash, “According to evolution by natural selection, an organism that sees reality as it is will never be more fit than an organism of equal complexity that sees none of reality but is just tuned to fitness. Never.” Hoffman explains that evolution has molded us to have perceptions and conscious experiences that allow us to survive and reproduce. Much like the computer desktop, our perception of reality is merely a tuned simplification that guides adaptive behavior, a user illusion.

== Criticism ==
===Introspection===
Critics of user illusion argue that humans are able to access the content of their brain’s representations by introspection and analysis of inner speech. These critics point out that more often humans know what is meant, although they may be wrong about what they said or how they delivered what they said. Furthermore, critics argue that inner speech episodes permit access to the content of some of our brain states, which thereby allows us to know what our brain states represent by introspection. This argument disputes the claim that consciousness is merely a simplified representation of the world in which we cannot access the full information of reality since what you introspect is what there is.

===Social behavior===
The user illusion proposes that consciousness is an evolutionary tool utilized to enhance social behavior and cooperation. Social insects provide an argument against this conclusion as these insects experience social cooperation and complex groupthink. Critics argue that the existence of social insects with extremely small brains falsifies the notion that social behavior requires consciousness, citing that insects have too small brains to be conscious and yet there are observed behaviors among them that for all functional intents and purposes match those of complex social cooperation and manipulation (including hierarchies where each individual has its place among paper wasps and Jack Jumper ants and honey bees sneaking when they lay eggs). These critics also argue that since social behavior in insects and other extremely small-brained animals have evolved multiple times independently, there is no evolutionary difficulty in simple reaction sociality to impose selection pressure for the more nutrient-consuming path of consciousness for sociality. These critics do point out that other evolutionary paths to consciousness are possible, such as critical evaluation that enhances plasticity by criticizing fallible notions, while pointing out that such a critical consciousness would be quite different from the justificatory type proposed by Nørretranders, differences including that a critical consciousness would make individuals more capable of changing their minds instead of justifying and persuading.

=== Free will ===
Free will can be defined philosophically as the ability of an individual to determine the course of their actions uninhibited by any other force. If consciousness does not exist then it can be proposed that humans have little action over their decisions and biology is the driving force behind human decision making. Daniel Dennett proposes that human experiences with conscious free will are human biological mechanisms creating a user representation. Many philosophers believe however that, while free will and consciousness are separate entities, free will may build upon the idea of consciousness. If consciousness is just the data in the human mind creating a user illusion, then this supports the theory that free will may not exist.

<text>John Calvin Brown (January 6, 1827August 17, 1889) was a Confederate Army officer and an American politician and businessman. Although he originally opposed secession, Brown fought for the Confederacy during the American Civil War, eventually rising to the rank of major general. He later served as the 19th Governor of Tennessee from 1871 to 1875, and was president of the state&#x27;s 1870 constitutional convention, which wrote the current Tennessee State Constitution.

A leader of the state&#x27;s Bourbon Democrats, Brown dedicated much of his time as governor to solving the state&#x27;s mounting debt issues. Following his gubernatorial tenure, he advocated railroad construction, briefly serving as president of the Texas &amp; Pacific Railroad in 1888, and as president of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company in 1889.

==Early life and education==
John Calvin Brown was born in Giles County, Tennessee, the son of Duncan and Margaret Smith Brown. He was the younger brother of Neill S. Brown, who served as governor of Tennessee in the late 1840s. John graduated from Jackson College in Columbia, Tennessee, in 1846. He studied law with his uncle, Hugh Brown, in Spring Hill, and was admitted to the bar in 1848. He began practicing law in Pulaski that same year.

Like his brother, Brown was a Whig prior to the American Civil War, and following the Whig Party&#x27;s collapse in the mid-1850s, he continued to support former Whig candidates. During the presidential election of 1860, he served as an elector for the Constitution Union Party candidate John Bell, who opposed secession, and took a neutral stance on the issue of slavery. In the weeks following the Battle of Fort Sumter in April 1861, however, secessionist sentiment swept across Middle Tennessee, and Brown, along with his brother and, eventually, John Bell, switched sides and supported the burgeoning Confederacy.

==American Civil War==
In May 1861, Brown enlisted as a private in the Confederate infantry, and was elected colonel of the 3rd Tennessee Infantry shortly afterward. He was later placed in charge of a brigade consisting of three Tennessee regiments.

Following the surrender of Fort Donelson, he was held as a prisoner of war for six months in Fort Warren, Massachusetts, before being exchanged in August 1862. Soon afterwards, he was promoted to brigadier-general and assigned command of a new and larger brigade composed of troops from Florida and Mississippi. He took part in Braxton Bragg&#x27;s campaigns in Kentucky and Tennessee in late 1862 through 1863. Brown was wounded in the battles of Perryville and Chickamauga while leading his brigade. His men were a part of the defensive line on Missionary Ridge in 1863.

In 1864, Brown fought in the Atlanta Campaign, at various times temporarily commanding a division. In August, he was promoted to major-general and formally assigned command of a division in Cheatham&#x27;s Corps. He was again wounded at Battle of Franklin in 1864, where six of his fellow generals were killed. He was incapacitated for several months and did not rejoin the army until the end of the Carolinas Campaign in April 1865. He surrendered with Joseph E. Johnston&#x27;s forces at Bennett Place and was paroled a month later.

==Governor of Tennessee==

Brown returned to Pulaski and resumed his law practice following the war. He was elected to the Tennessee General Assembly in 1869. In the following year, he was a delegate to the state constitutional convention, and was elected its president by his peers. This convention overhauled the state&#x27;s 1834 constitution, essentially updating it to meet post-Civil War demands. The document most notably guaranteed the right to vote to all males of at least 21 years of age, regardless of race, but also instituted a poll tax. Although it has been amended a number of times, it remains Tennessee&#x27;s current state constitution.
Although he had been a Whig before the Civil War, Brown joined the Democratic Party after the war, and was nominated as the party&#x27;s candidate for governor in 1870. Since the new constitution restored voting rights to ex-Confederates, Brown easily defeated his Republican opponent, William H. Wisener of Shelbyville, by a 78,979 to 41,500 vote. He was reelected by a narrower margin, 97,700 votes to 84,089, over Republican candidate Alfred A. Freeman in 1872.

Brown&#x27;s most pressing issue was the state&#x27;s skyrocketing debt. In previous decades, Tennessee had accumulated $43 million in bonded debt, mostly to pay for internal improvements, such as turnpike construction and loans to railroads. Governor William Brownlow exacerbated the problem by issuing more bonds to pay the interest on outstanding bonds in the late 1860s. By the time Brown took office, the state was struggling to pay the interest on this debt. Brown managed to reduce the state&#x27;s bonded debt to $20 million, and eliminated all of the state&#x27;s floating debt. His efforts proved futile, however, and the state eventually defaulted following the Panic of 1873.

Brown&#x27;s administration enacted the state&#x27;s first truly effective public school legislation, which called for the establishment of county and city school superintendents, and the creation of the office of State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Brown also advocated a board of directors to govern local school districts, and the organization of separate schools for African-American and white children. To support these schools, Governor Brown called for the Legislature to institute a small state tax and give cities and counties the power to raise additional taxes.

In 1875, along with several other former Confederate generals, he competed for an open United States Senate seat, but lost on the 54th ballot in the state legislature to former President Andrew Johnson.

==Later life==
In 1876, Brown, who supported Thomas A. Scott&#x27;s efforts to build a transcontinental railroad in the South, joined the Texas &amp; Pacific Railroad as a vice president. He was appointed receiver of this railroad in 1885, and was elevated to president in 1888. The following year, he became president of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company, which was one of the largest industrial firms in the South. Brown also served as president of the Bon Air Coal Company, a coal mining operation on the Cumberland Plateau near Crossville, in the 1880s.

Brown fell ill in the Summer of 1889, and traveled to Red Boiling Springs, a mineral springs resort in north-central Tennessee, in hopes of recovering. On August 17, 1889, however, he suffered a stomach hemorrhage and died. His body was returned to Pulaski and interred in the city&#x27;s Maplewood Cemetery.

==Personal life==
Brown&#x27;s first wife, Anne Pointer, died in 1858. They had no children. He married his second wife, Elizabeth Childress of Murfreesboro, in 1864. Her paternal aunt was First Lady Sarah Childress Polk, and her father resided at the Childress-Ray House. They had four children: Marie, Daisy, Elizabeth, and John C. Brown, Jr. Brown&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth, was among the women featured in Annie Somers Gilchrist&#x27;s 1902 book, &quot;Some Representative Women of Tennessee&quot;. The Browns&#x27; daughter, Marie, was married to Governor Benton McMillin.

<text>Krill oil is an extract prepared from a species of Antarctic krill, &quot;Euphausia superba&quot;. Processed krill oil is commonly sold as a dietary supplement. Two components of krill oil are omega-3 fatty acids similar to those in fish oil, and phospholipid-derived fatty acids (PLFA), mainly phosphatidylcholine (alternatively referred to as marine lecithin). Fishing for krill where previously the focus was on marine life of higher trophic level is an example of fishing down the food web.

==Safety and regulation==
Although there may be toxic residues present in Antarctic krill and fish, the United States Food and Drug Administration has accepted notices from krill oil manufacturers declaring that krill oil and supplement products derived from it meet the standards for generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status.

Krill oil is listed among authorized European novel foods by meeting specification limits.

==Difference between krill oil and fish oil==
Krill oil and oceanic fish oil are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, mainly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). While both contain some EPA and DHA as free fatty acids, krill oil contains particularly rich amounts of choline-containing phospholipids and a phosphatidylcholine concentration of 34 grams per 100 grams of oil.

Krill oil also contains an appreciable content of astaxanthin at 0.1 to 1.5 mg/ml, depending on processing methods, which is responsible for its red color. While fish oil is generally golden yellow, krill oil tends to be reddish. It is generally more expensive than fish oil.

<doc id="866266" wikidata="Q135611" url="?curid=866266" title="Candidatus Pelagibacter communis">
<text>&quot;&quot;Candidatus&quot; Pelagibacter&quot;, with the single species &quot;&quot;Ca.&quot; P. communis&quot;, was isolated in 2002 and given a specific name, although it has not yet been described as required by the bacteriological code. It is an abundant member of the SAR11 clade in the phylum &quot;Alphaproteobacteria&quot;. SAR11 members are highly dominant organisms found in both salt and fresh water worldwide and were originally known only from their rRNA genes, first identified in the Sargasso Sea in 1990 by Stephen Giovannoni&#x27;s laboratory at Oregon State University and later found in oceans worldwide. &quot;&quot;Ca.&quot; P. communis&quot; and its relatives may be the most abundant organisms in the ocean, and quite possibly the most abundant bacteria in the entire world. It can make up about 25% of all microbial plankton cells, and in the summer they may account for approximately half the cells present in temperate ocean surface water. The total abundance of &quot;&quot;Ca.&quot; P. communis&quot; and relatives is estimated to be about 2 × 1028 microbes.

It is rod or crescent-shaped and one of the smallest self-replicating cells known, with a length of 0.37–0.89 μm and a diameter of only 0.12–0.20 μm. The &quot;Pelagibacter&quot; genome takes up about 30% of the cell&#x27;s volume. It is gram negative. It recycles dissolved organic carbon. It undergoes regular seasonal cycles in abundance—in summer reaching ~50% of the cells in the temperate ocean surface waters. Thus it plays a major role in the Earth&#x27;s carbon cycle.

Its discovery was the subject of &quot;Oceans of Microbes&quot;, Episode 5 of &quot;Intimate Strangers: Unseen Life on Earth&quot; by PBS.

==Cultivation==
Several strains of &quot;&quot;Candidatus&quot; Pelagibacter communis&quot; have been cultured thanks to improved isolation techniques. The most studied strain is HTCC1062 (high-throughput cultivation collection).
The factors that regulate SAR11 populations are still largely unknown. They have sensors for nitrogen, phosphate, and iron limitation, and a very unusual requirement for reduced sulfur compounds. It is hypothesised that they have been molded by evolution in a low nutrient ecosystem, such as the Sargasso Sea where it was first discovered.

A population of &quot;&quot;Ca.&quot; P. communis&quot; cells can double every 29 hours, which is fairly slow, but they can replicate under low nutrient conditions.

&quot;&quot;Ca.&quot; P. communis&quot; can be grown on a defined, artificial medium with additions of reduced sulfur, glycine, pyruvate and vitamins.

==Genome==
The genome of &quot;&quot;Ca.&quot; P. communis&quot; strain HTCC1062 was completely sequenced in 2005 showing that &quot;&quot;Ca.&quot; P. communis&quot; has the smallest genome (1,308,759 bp) of any free-living organism encoding only 1,354 open reading frames (1,389 genes total). The only species with smaller genomes are symbionts and parasites, such as &quot;Mycoplasma genitalium&quot; or &quot;Nanoarchaeum equitans&quot; It has the smallest number of open reading frames of any free living organism, and the shortest intergenic spacers, but it still has metabolic pathways for all 20 amino acids and most co-factors. Its genome has been streamlined. This streamlining concept is important because it reduces the amount of energy required for cell replication. &quot;&quot;Ca.&quot; P. communis&quot; saves energy by using the base pairs A and T (≈70.3% of all base pairs) because they contain less nitrogen, a resource that is hard for organisms to acquire.

Non-coding RNAs have been identified in &quot;&quot;Ca.&quot; P. communis&quot; through a bioinformatics screen of the published genome and metagenomic data. Examples of ncRNA found in these organisms include the SAM-V riboswitch, and other cis-regulatory elements like the &quot;rpsB&quot; motif. Another example of an important ncRNA in &quot;&quot;Ca.&quot; P. communis&quot; and other SAR11 clade members is a conserved, glycine-activated riboswitch on malate synthase, putatively leading to &quot;functional auxotrophy&quot; for glycine or glycine precursors in order to achieve optimal growth.

It is found to have proteorhodopsin genes, which help power light-mediated proton pumps. Subtle differences arise in the expression of its codon sequences when it is subjected to either light or dark treatments. More genes for oxidative phosphorylation are expressed when it is subjected to darkness.

==Name==

The name of the genus (&quot;Pelagibacter&quot;) stems from the Latin neuter noun &quot;&quot; (&quot;sea&quot;) combined with the suffix -bacter (rod, bacterium), to mean &quot;bacterium of the sea&quot;. The connecting vowel is an &quot;i&quot; and not an &quot;o&quot;, as the first term is the Latin &quot;pelagus&quot; and not the Greek original &quot;πέλαγος (pelagos)&quot; (the word &quot;pelagus&quot; is a Greek word used in Latin poetry, it is a 2nd declension noun with a Greek-like irregular nominative plural &quot;pelagē&quot; and not &quot;pelagi&quot;, the Greek word being a 3rd declension neuter in -ος (pl. -η) unrelated with 2nd declension latin words in &quot;-us&quot;). The name of the specific epithet (&quot;ubique&quot;) is a Latin adverb meaning &quot;everywhere&quot;; species with the status Candidatus are not validly published so do not have to be grammatically correct, such as having specific epithets having to be adjectives or nouns in apposition in the nominative case or genitive nouns according to rule 12c of the IBCN.

The term &quot;Candidatus&quot; is used for proposed species for which the lack of information prevents it from being a validated species according to the bacteriological code, such as deposition in two public cell repositories or lack of FAME analysis, whereas &quot;&quot;Candidatus&quot; Pelagibacter communis&quot; is not in ATCC and DSMZ, nor has analysis of lipids and quinones been conducted.

HTTC1062 is the type strain of the species &quot;&quot;Ca.&quot; P. communis&quot;, which in turn is the type species of the genus &quot;&quot;Candidatus&quot; Pelagibacter&quot;, which in turn is the type genus of the SAR11 clade or family &quot;&quot;Pelagibacteraceae&quot;.

==Bacteriophage==
It was reported in &quot;Nature&quot; in February 2013 that the bacteriophage HTVC010P, which attacks &quot;Ca.&quot; P. communis&quot;, has been discovered and &quot;it probably really is the commonest organism on the planet&quot;.

<text>Slow Riot for New Zero Kanada (stylised as Slow Riot for New Zerø Kanada) is the only EP and second release by Godspeed You! Black Emperor. It was released on the Montreal-based record label Constellation Records in 1999, and was re-released by Kranky.
==Packaging==
The EP&#x27;s packaging makes only sparing reference to either the band or the EP&#x27;s title: the outer packaging does not make any reference to Godspeed, but mentions them in the liner notes; the EP&#x27;s title is only shown on the spine of the CD pressing. The song titles are not listed anywhere on the cover.

The cardboard album case is unusual in that it opens in the opposite direction of a conventional CD case; this is due to the Hebrew text being read from right to left.

The front of the EP contains Hebrew characters (). This phrase is used in both Genesis 1:2 and Jeremiah 4:23, the former to describe the Earth before God separated light from dark and the latter to describe the Earth after the Lord&#x27;s Day. The dots and dashes above the letters are called trope. They dictate the tune and intonation and are found in the Torah as well as the rest of the Hebrew Bible. On the inside cover, this text is put into greater context, with Jer 4:23–27 provided in both Hebrew and English (seemingly the Jewish Publication Society version):

:23 I beheld the earth,
:And, lo, it was waste and void;
:And the heavens, and they had no light.
:24 I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled,
:And all the hills moved to and fro.
:25 I beheld, and, lo, there was no man,
:And all the birds of the heavens were fled.
:26 I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful field was a wilderness,
:And all the cities thereof were broken down
:At the presence of the ,
:And before His fierce anger.
:27 For thus saith the :
:The whole land shall be desolate;
:Yet will I not make a full end.

The back of the EP contains a diagram with instructions in Italian on how to make a molotov cocktail.

The EP is pressed on a 12&quot; record with each side intended to be played at a different speed. Side A, &quot;Moya&quot;, is played at 45 rpm, while side B, &quot;BBF3&quot;, is played at 33 ⅓ rpm.

==Songs==
===Moya===
The song title is a reference to band member Mike Moya. Concert setlists refer to this song as &quot;Gorecki&quot; because it is a reworking of his third symphony.

===BBF3===
The song title &quot;BBF3&quot; refers to the vox pop interviewee going by the name of &quot;Blaise Bailey Finnegan III&quot;, whose eccentric ramblings form the core of the song. Finnegan recites a poem which he claims to have written himself. The poem is, in fact, mostly composed of lyrics from the song &quot;Virus&quot; by Iron Maiden that were written by their then-vocalist Blaze Bayley. Blaise Bailey Finnegan III is also heard interviewed at the beginning of the track &quot;Providence&quot; on the group&#x27;s previous release &quot;F♯ A♯ ∞&quot;, and indeed some concert performances of &quot;BBF3&quot; also incorporate that sample.

<text>Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola ( , , ; 1 October 15077 July 1573), often simply called Vignola, was one of the great Italian architects of 16th century Mannerism. His two great masterpieces are the Villa Farnese at Caprarola and the Jesuits&#x27; Church of the Gesù in Rome. The three architects who spread the Italian Renaissance style throughout Western Europe are Vignola, Serlio and Palladio. He is often considered the most important architect in Rome in the Mannerist era.

==Biography==
Jacopo Barozzi was born at Vignola, near Modena (Emilia-Romagna).

He began his career as an architect in Bologna, supporting himself by painting and making perspective templates for inlay craftsmen. He made his first trip to Rome in 1536 to make measured drawings of Roman temples, with a thought to publish an illustrated Vitruvius. Then François I called him to Fontainebleau, where he spent the years 1541–1543. Here he probably met his fellow Bolognese, the architect Sebastiano Serlio and the painter Primaticcio.

After his return to Italy, he designed the Palazzo Bocchi in Bologna. Later he moved to Rome. Here he worked for Pope Julius III and, after the latter&#x27;s death, he was taken up by the papal family of the Farnese and worked with Michelangelo, who deeply influenced his style (see Works section for details of his works in this period).

In 1558, he was in Piacenza to revise the designs of Palazzo Farnese, commissioned by Margaret of Austria, wife of the Duke Ottavio Farnese and daughter of Emperor Charles V.

From 1564 Vignola carried on Michelangelo&#x27;s work at St Peter&#x27;s Basilica, and constructed the two subordinate domes according to Michelangelo&#x27;s plans.

Jacopo Barozzi died in Rome in 1573. In 1973 his remains were reburied in the Pantheon, Rome.

==Works==

===Major architectural works===
Vignola&#x27;s main works include:

* Project for the facade of the Basilica of San Petronio (), Bologna.
*Villa Giulia for Pope Julius III, in Rome (1550–1553). Here Vignola was working with Ammanati, who designed the nymphaeum and other garden features under the general direction of Vasari, with guidance from the knowledgeable pope and Michelangelo. A medal of 1553 shows Vignola&#x27;s main villa substantially as it was completed, save for a pair of cupolas.
*Villa Farnese at Caprarola (1559–1573);
*Villa Lante at Bagnaia (1566 onwards), including the gardens and their water features and &quot;casini&quot;;
*Chiesa del Gesù, Rome, the mother church of the Jesuit order, which would become a source for Baroque church facades in the 17th century;
*Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli, Assisi (with Galeazzo Alessi);
*Church of Sant&#x27;Andrea in Via Flaminia, Rome, the first church to have an oval dome, which became a signature of the Baroque.
*Palazzo dei Banchi, Bologna
*Palazzo Farnese, Piacenza. This was a grandiose project of a vast palace on a scale paralleled only by the Vatican Palace in Italy; the rectangular plan is circa 111 metres by 88 metres. The actual construction, however, made up only less than half of Vignola&#x27;s original project and lacked many of the planned architectural features; missing elements include part of the exterior surrounding walls, the main façade, modelled on the ancient triumphal arch and with a large tower, and a theatre in the large inner courtyard.
* St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in the Vatican, assumed the role of chief architect after the death of Michelangelo Buonarroti.
* Palazzo Contrari Boncompagni, Vignola.
* Church of Santa Maria dell&#x27;Orto (1576–1578), Rome; only the facade is by Vignola.
* Orti Farnesiani to Palatine, Rome.
* Project of the Church of Sant&#x27;Anna dei Palafrenieri in Vatican City (), with the plan and oval dome inserted in a rectangle, made by Giacinto Barozzi. The scheme will be taken up by many architects baroque.

===Unbuilt works===
Like many other architects, Vignola submitted his plans for completing the facade of San Petronio, Bologna. Designs by Vignola, in company with Baldassare Peruzzi, Giulio Romano, Andrea Palladio and others furnished material for an exhibition in 2001

===Written works===

His two published books helped formulate the of classical architectural style. The earliest, &quot;Regola delli cinque ordini d&#x27;architettura&quot; [&quot;Canon of the five orders of architecture&quot;] (first published in 1562, probably in Rome), presented Vignola&#x27;s practical system for constructing columns in the five classical orders (Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite) utilising proportions which Vignola derived from his own measurements of classical Roman monuments. The clarity and ease of use of Vignola&#x27;s treatise caused it to become in succeeding centuries the most published book in architectural history. Vignola&#x27;s second treatise, &quot;Due regole della prospettiva pratica&quot; [&quot;Two rules of practical perspective&quot;], published posthumously with extensive commentary by the mathematician Ignazio Danti (Bologna 1583), favours one-point perspective rather than two-point methods such as the bifocal construction. Vignola presented— without theoretical obscurities— practical applications which could be understood by a prospective patron.

<text>Thomas Edward Siddon, (born November 9, 1941) is a Canadian aerospace engineer and politician.

==Early life and education==
Born in Drumheller, Alberta, Siddon pursued engineering, graduating from the University of Alberta in 1963, followed by earning his Masters and Doctorate in aeroacoustics from the University of Toronto, Institute of Aerospace. He became a professor at the University of British Columbia and founded an aero-acoustics firm, Siddon-Harford &amp; Associates.

Siddon married Patricia Yackimetz in 1962, with whom he has 5 children. Yackimetz is the niece of Canadian-American psychologist Albert Bandura.

==Political career==
After serving as City Councillor in Richmond, British Columbia, for two years, he was first elected to parliament in a 1978 by-election as a Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) to represent the British Columbia riding of Burnaby—Richmond—Delta. He was successively elected in five federal elections between 1978 and 1993, and worked under several prime ministers.

When Brian Mulroney became leader of the PC Party, Siddon was appointed the party&#x27;s science critic in the shadow cabinet. After the Tories won the 1984 election, he was given the post of Secretary of State for Science and Technology. During his time in this role, he established the foundation for the Canadian Space Agency and signed the International Space Station Agreement with the United States in 1984.

Siddon was promoted to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans position on in 1985, in the wake of the tunagate scandal that had forced the resignation of previous minister, John Fraser.

Siddon remained in the Fisheries post for five years, until February 23, 1990. In response to overfishing and its consequences on fish stocks, Siddon attempted to impose stiff quotas on the catch. In 1991, a complete moratorium on cod fishing had to be imposed.

In 1990, Siddon moved to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development position. Shortly after his swearing-in, Siddon worked alongside his provincial counterpart John Ciaccia, to address the Oka Crisis.

As Minister of Indian Affairs, Siddon helped conclude the agreement in 1992 to create the new territory of Nunavut, the signing of the Saskatchewan Treaty Land Entitlement Framework Agreement, the signing of the Yukon Umbrella Final Agreement, and the establishment of the British Columbia Treaty Process.

When fellow British Columbian and ally Kim Campbell became PC leader and prime minister in 1993, Siddon was promoted to the senior cabinet, becoming Minister of National Defence on June 25, 1993. In this role, he was responsible for ordering new EH-101 navy helicopters to replace the aging Sea King helicopters. The deal was finalized, but during the next election, the opposition Liberal Party of Canada argued that the helicopters were too expensive.

Siddon entered the 1993 election and ended up finishing third behind Raymond Chan of the Liberal Party and Nick Loenen of Reform.

==After federal politics==
Siddon returned to the private sector, but remained active in Tory politics. He supported Peter MacKay&#x27;s leadership bid in 2003, and later became an early advocate of union between the Tories and Canadian Alliance.

Following his federal political career, Siddon remained active as a consultant, lecturer and corporate board member. He speaks frequently on the political challenges of combating global climate change and the long range implications for water supply management. Siddon was the founding chair of the Okanagan Water Stewardship Council, and a member of the RBC Blue Water Advisory Panel. In 2007, he was awarded a Doctorate of Laws from the University of British Columbia | Okanagan, received the University of Alberta Honour Award in 2009, the 2010 UBC Alumni Award of Distinction, and was the 2017 recipient of the University of Toronto Engineering Alumni Hall of Distinction Award.

Siddon made a return to politics when he was elected to the Board of Education in Penticton, BC in November 2008. His campaign was based on more openness by the board with fewer in-camera meetings. Siddon was also a strong vocal opponent to the board&#x27;s decision to tear down a historic auditorium and gymnasium in the local high school. Following a successful three years on the School Board, in 2011 Siddon decided not to seek re-election, but rather ran for the position of Area &#x27;D&#x27; Director for the Regional District of Okanagan Similkameen. Siddon defeated his two contenders, receiving 50.5% support in ballots cast. In 2014 he was re-elected as Area &#x27;D&#x27; Director.

In February 2018, Siddon announced that he would be retiring from politics, and that he would not be seeking re-election in October 2018.

==Lawsuit==
Siddon was successful in settling out of court after suing radio commentator Rafe Mair for defamation in January 1995. Mair publicly apologized for comments made towards Siddon and settled the claims out of court.

<text>Rauli Somerjoki (born Rauli Aarre Tapani Somerjoki; August 30, 1947 – January 14, 1987), known professionally as &quot;Badding&quot;, was a Finnish rock singer born in the town of Somero into a family of five children. His records were published on such labels as Love Records.

== Career ==
Badding Somerjoki founded his first band, The Five Yes, in 1963 and also played in the group Suomen Talvisota 1939-1940. He and M. A. Numminen caused a major scandal in 1966 with provocative songs like &quot;Mitä nuoren aviomiehen tulee muistaa&quot; (&#x27;What Young Husbands Should Remember&#x27;) and &quot;Jenkka ulkosynnyttimistä&quot; (&#x27;Vulva Jenkka&#x27;), whose performance resulted in the interruption of the concert by the police although the lyrics were simply texts from factual books on marriage and sexuality available in public libraries.

Badding&#x27;s most famous songs include &quot;Fiilaten ja höyläten&quot; (originally Reelin&#x27; and Rockin&#x27; by Chuck Berry); &quot;Paratiisi&quot; (&#x27;Paradise&#x27;, a song composed by Badding himself and the lyrics written together with Arja Tiainen); &quot;Bensaa suonissa&quot; (&#x27;Gasoline in the veins&#x27;, composed by Badding himself, with lyrics written by Jarkko Laine); &quot;Ikkunaprinsessa&quot; (&#x27;Window Princess&#x27;, originally Glendora); &quot;Tähdet, tähdet&quot; (&#x27;Stars, Stars&#x27;, a song made by Somerjoki himself); and &quot;Laivat&quot; (&#x27;Ships&#x27;, &#x27;Parakhody&#x27;, originally a Russian popular song).

Badding started his solo career in 1970. He competed in the Syksyn sävel song contest with &quot;Ja rokki soi&quot; written by Matti ja Teppo.

During his later career, Badding worked with the Agents. His last gig took place in Seinäjoki on 28 December 1986. During the autumn, he had suffered many bouts of bronchitis. In January 1987, he died in Helsinki of alcohol-related ailments. He was only 39 years of age.

<doc id="866286" wikidata="Q738004" url="?curid=866286" title="Serra da Estrela">
<text>Serra da Estrela () is the highest mountain range in Continental Portugal. Together with the Serra da Lousã it is the westernmost constituent range of the Sistema Central and also one of the highest in the system. It includes mainland Portugal&#x27;s highest point at above mean sea level (although the summit of Mount Pico in the Portuguese Azores islands is higher). This point is not a distinctive mountain summit, but rather the highest point in a plateau, being known as Torre (&quot;Tower&quot; in English). Torre is an unusual summit in that it is accessible by a paved road. The peak has a topographic prominence of and its parent peak is Pico Almanzor, in Spain.

The mountain range, situated between the municipalities of Seia, Manteigas, Gouveia, Guarda and Covilhã, is about long and is across at its widest point. It is formed from a huge granite ridge that once formed the southern frontier of the country.

==Rivers==
There are three rivers that have their headwaters in the Serra da Estrela: the Mondego, which is the longest river entirely within Portuguese territory; and the Zêzere, which is a tributary of the Tagus; a tributary of the Mondego, the Alva also has its headwaters in the range.
It is high.

==Nature park==
The mountain range is now part of the Serra da Estrela Natural Park and offers skiing opportunities in the ski resort of Loriga, Seia Municipality.

==Serra da Estrela dog==
The Cão da Serra da Estrela (&quot;Estrela Mountain Dog&quot;) is a breed of livestock guardian dog that takes its name from this region.

==Serra da Estrela sheep and cheese ==
&quot;Queijo Serra da Estrela&quot; (Serra da Estrela cheese) is a soft cheese from the region of Serra da Estrela. The recipe is more than 2000 years old. It is made from cardoon thistle, raw sheep&#x27;s milk and salt. The cheese is soft and gooey. The cheese becomes harder and chewier as time goes by. The region&#x27;s ancient &quot;bordaleira&quot; sheep are also prized for their wool.

==Cuisine==
The region&#x27;s cuisine is well-regarded and includes dishes such as breaded sweet sardines and Juniper beef stew. Smoked meat (fumeiro) and traditional sausages (enchidos) are in abundance, the nettle sausage (alheira de urtiga) among them. Though the region has a very small local Jewish population, it has emerged as a center for Kosher food, with local producers launching kosher versions of their olive oil, wine and cheesemakers obtaining kosher certification for some products.

==Conchos dam==

The Serra da Estrela is also home to a hydroelectric system of dams, part of which is the Covão dos Conchos. The Covão dos Conchos looks like a natural sinkhole within the lake at first glance, but it was constructed as a spillway in 1955 and acts as a water diversion from Ribeira das Naves to Lagoa Comprida.

==History, legends and myths==
A legend associated with the mountain is mentioned in chapter 41 of the American literary classic, Moby-Dick:
:&quot;... the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface)...&quot;

Archaeological investigations have allowed a picture of life during the fifth millennium BC, the Early Neolithic to emerge, where small communities sustained themselves by small game hunting, the gathering of acorn and other winter fruits, and migratory pastoralism. The raising of sheep and goats, introduced to the region by the first Neolithic settlers - suggests that spring and summer were spent on high ground pastures and winter on the lower grounds of the river valleys. The significance of the Serra da Estrela in Neolithic culture can be seen in the discovery that megaliths in the Mondego River basin were predominantly built with an alignment that allowed the mountain range to be seen from within the inner chamber. At the same time the rise of Aldebaran, the brightest star of Taurus, behind the mountains could also be seen and its Heliacal rising in late April/early May could have been used as a temporal marker for the movement to the high pastures of Serra da Estrela. This archaeological narrative closely mirrors the local folklore that explains the name of the mountain range.

<text>Johann von Lamont, FRSE (13 December 1805 – 6 August 1879), born John Lamont, was a Scottish-German astronomer and physicist.

== Biography ==
Lamont was born at Corriemulzie near Inverey in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The son of Robert Lamont (forester to Earl Fife) and Elizabeth Ewan, his education began at the local school in Inverey, near Braemar. In 1817 his father died and John was sent to be educated at St James&#x27; monastery (Scots Benedictine College) at Regensburg, Germany.
He began to work in astronomy and joined the Bogenhausen Observatory, became its director in 1835, took his doctorate of philosophy in 1830 and became professor of astronomy in 1852 at Munich University.
At the observatory he undertook the task of creating a star catalog that had about 35,000 entries.

In 1845 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

His most important work was on the magnetism of the Earth. He performed magnetic surveys in Bavaria and northern Germany, France, Spain, and Denmark. He discovered a magnetic decennial period (ten-year cycle) and the electric current in the Earth closing the electric &quot;circuit&quot; creating the magnetic field in 1850. This roughly matched the eleven-year sunspot cycle discovered by Heinrich Schwabe.

He calculated the orbits of the moons of Uranus and Saturn, obtaining the first value for Uranus&#x27; mass. By chance he observed Neptune in 1845 and twice in 1846, but did not recognize the object as being a new planet.

He died, unmarried and without children, in Munich, Germany, on 6 August 1879. His considerable wealth was used to found scholarships in sciences. He is buried in Bogenhausen Churchyard on the edge of Munich.

== Publications ==

Lamont is the author of &quot;Handbuch des Erdmagnetismus&quot; (1849).

== Honours ==
His many honours include ForMemRS and FRSE. In 1867 he was awarded the Merit Order of the Bavarian Crown by the King of Bavaria, through which Lamont was ennobled and permitted to use the predicate &quot;von&quot;. The statue on his tomb in Munich has him with an open hand, into which the locals put small coins. In 1934 the Deeside Field Club erected a granite memorial cairn in his memory at Inverey, Scotland. It was unveiled by Sir James Jeans.

The following astronomical features were named in his honour:
* Lamont (Martian crater).
* Lamont (lunar crater).

<text>The Council of Ireland was a statutory body established under the Government of Ireland Act 1920 as an all-Ireland law-making authority with limited jurisdiction, initially over both Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland, and later solely over Northern Ireland. It had 41 members: 13 members of each of the Houses of Commons of Southern Ireland and of Northern Ireland; 7 members of each of the Senates of Southern Ireland and of Northern Ireland; and a President chosen by the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. It never met and was abolished in 1925.

==Purpose==
Under Section 2 of the 1920 Act, the Council was established with the following purpose:

Under Section 7 of the 1920 Act, the Council could make orders concerning matters which were within the remit of the respective Parliaments of Southern and Northern Ireland. The Council&#x27;s Orders required royal assent in the same way Bills of either of the Parliaments also required such assent.

==Establishment==
The Council was duly established on the &quot;Appointed Day&quot;, 3 May 1921. On 23 June 1921, the House of Commons of Northern Ireland duly elected its 13 chosen members to the Council:

*Robert Anderson
*J. M. Andrews
*Milne Barbour
*Dawson Bates
*William Coote
*James Craig
*Herbert Dixon
*William Grant
*Robert Johnstone
*Crawford McCullagh
*Samuel McGuffin
*Robert McKeown
*David Shillington

The House of Commons of Southern Ireland was a body which although established, never functioned and never elected members to the Council; most of its members instead sat in the republican Second Dáil. In fact, the Council of Ireland never met.

==Adaptation of Council under Treaty==
The Anglo-Irish Treaty made provision for the continuation of the Council of Ireland after the Irish Free State was established. Under the Treaty, if Northern Ireland chose to opt out of the Irish Free State (as in fact it subsequently did), the Council was to continue but the Council&#x27;s powers could then only be applied to Northern Ireland and not to the Irish Free State. While its functions only applied to Northern Ireland, its membership continued to be 40: 20 selected by each of the Parliaments of the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland respectively and one by the King&#x27;s representative. Therefore, after the Treaty, it was no longer the all-Ireland body originally envisaged as its powers applied only to Northern Ireland. Instead, it was a body in which the Irish Free State might influence the affairs of Northern Ireland and consequently was increasingly distrusted by the Government of Northern Ireland. The Council never met.

On 23 January 1922 Michael Collins, then head of the Provisional Government in Dublin, met Sir James Craig, then Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, in London, and they agreed amongst other matters that: &quot;The two Governments [are] to endeavour to devise a more suitable system than the Council of Ireland for dealing with problems affecting all Ireland.&quot;

==Abolition==
After the collapse of the Irish Boundary Commission in 1925, the 1921 Treaty was amended 3 December 1925 by agreement between United Kingdom, Northern Ireland and Irish Free State governments. The Council of Ireland was essentially abolished, as it was transferred to the care of the Northern Ireland government that did not intend to work towards a united Ireland in the foreseeable future. Under Article 5 of that Agreement it was declared that:

<text>Gwerful Mechain (fl. 1460–1502), is the only female medieval Welsh poet from whom a substantial body of work is known to have survived. She is known for her erotic poetry, in which she praised the vulva among other things.

==Life==
Gwerful Mechain lived in Mechain in Powys. Little is known of her life, but it is generally accepted that she was a descendant of a noble family from Llanfechain.

Her father was Hywel Fychan of Mechain in Powys, her mother was named Gwenhwyfar, and she had at least four siblings (three brothers and a sister). She married John ap Llywelyn Fychan and had at least one child, a daughter named Mawd.

==Work==
She is perhaps the most famous female Welsh-language poet after Ann Griffiths (1776–1805), who was also from northern Powys. Her work, composed in the traditional strict metres, including cywyddau and englynion, is often a celebration of religion or sex, sometimes within the same poem.

Probably the most famous part of her work today is her erotic poetry, especially &quot;Cywydd y Cedor&quot; (&quot;Poem to the Vagina&quot;), a poem praising the vulva. In it, she upbraids male poets for celebrating so many parts of a woman&#x27;s body but ignoring &quot;the girl&#x27;s middle&quot;. &quot;Let songs to the quim grow and thrive&quot;, she adjures her readers. &quot;Noble bush, may God save it&quot;.

She actively participated in the poetic culture of her day. Many of her surviving poems are examples of &quot;&quot; (poetic or bardic rivalry) with contemporaries such as Dafydd Llwyd of Mathafarn, Ieuan Dyfi and Llywelyn ap Gutun.

<text>The Collegiata di Santa Maria Assunta or Duomo di San Gimignano is a Roman Catholic collegiate church and minor basilica in San Gimignano, in Tuscany in central Italy. It contains important cycles of Renaissance frescoes by artists including Domenico Ghirlandaio, Benozzo Gozzoli, Taddeo di Bartolo, Lippo Memmi and Bartolo di Fredi. It falls within the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the &quot;Historic Centre of San Gimignano&quot;, with its frescoes being described by UNESCO as &quot;works of outstanding beauty&quot;.

==History==
The first church on the site was begun in the 10th century. During the early 12th century the importance of San Gimignano, and its principal church, grew steadily, owing to the town&#x27;s location on the pilgrimage route to Rome, the Via Francigena. The present church on this site was consecrated on 21 November 1148 and dedicated to St. Geminianus (San Gimignano) in the presence of Pope Eugenius III and 14 prelates. The event is commemorated in a plaque on the facade. The power and authority of the city of San Gimignano continued to grow, until it was able to win autonomy from Volterra. The church owned land and enjoyed numerous privileges that were endorsed by papal bulls and decrees. It was elevated to collegiate status 20 September 1471.

During the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, the church was enriched by the addition of frescos and sculpture. The western end of the building (liturgical east) was altered and extended by Giuliano da Maiano between 1466 and 1468, with the work including vestries, the Chapel of Conception and the Chapel of St Fina. The church was damaged during World War II, and during the subsequent restoration in 1951 the triapsidal eastern end of the earlier church was discovered lying beneath the nave of the present church.

The church possesses the relics of St. Geminianus, the beatified Bishop of Modena and patron saint of the town, whose feast day is celebrated on 31 January. On 8 May 1300 Dante Alighieri came to San Gimignano as the Ambassador of the Guelph League in Tuscany. Girolamo Savonarola preached from the pulpit of this church in 1497.

==Architecture==

The Collegiate Church stands on the west side of Piazza del Duomo, so named although the church has never been the seat of a bishop. The church has an east-facing facade, and chancel to the west, as at St Peter&#x27;s Basilica. The architecture is 12th and 13th century Romanesque with the exception of the two chapels in the Renaissance style. The facade, which has little ornament, is approached from the square by a wide staircase and has a door into each of the side aisles, but no central portal. The doorways are surmounted by stone lintels with recessed arches above them, unusual in incorporating the stone Gabbro. There is a central ocular window at the end of the nave and a smaller one giving light to each aisle. The facade, which is stone, was raised higher in brick in 1340, when the ribbed vaulting was constructed, and the two smaller ocular windows set in. Matteo di Brunisend is generally credited as the main architect of the medieval period, with his date of activity given as 1239, but in fact his contribution may have been little more than the design of the central ocular window. Beneath this window is a slot which marks the place of a window which lit the chancel of the earlier church, and may be the most visible sign of the church&#x27;s reorientation in the 12th century rebuilding, although this is not entirely agreed upon by scholars.

To the north side of the church, in the corner of the transept and chancel, stands a severely plain campanile of square plan, with a single arched opening in each face. The campanile may be that of the earlier church, as it appears to mark the extent of the original western facade, or it may have been one of the city&#x27;s many tower houses, pressed into service of the church. To the south side of the church is the Loggia of the Baptistry, a 14th-century arcaded cloister with stout octagonal columns and a groin vault.

Internally, the building is in the shape of a Latin Cross, with central nave and an aisle on either side, divided by arcades of seven semi-circular Romanesque arches resting on columns with simplified Corinthianesque capitals. The chancel is a simple rectangle with a single arched window at the terminal end. The roofs throughout are of quadripartite vaults which date from the mid 14th century. Although Gothic by date and decoration, the profiles of the ribs are semi-circular in the Romanesque manner. The clerestory has small windows, inserted when the nave was vaulted, along with lancet windows in the north aisle, the aisle windows were subsequently blocked for the painting of the fresco cycle, making the interior very dark.

==Decoration==

The Romanesque architectural details of the church&#x27;s interior are emphasised by the decorative use of colour, with the voussoirs of the nave arcades being of alternately black and white marble, creating stripes, as seen at Orvieto Cathedral. The vault compartments are all painted with &quot;lapis lazuli&quot; dotted with gold stars, and the vaulting ribs are emphasised with bands of geometric decoration predominantly in red, white and gold.

The church is most famous for its largely intact scheme of fresco decoration, the greater part of which dates from the 14th century, and represents the work of painters of the Sienese school, influenced by the Byzantine traditions of Duccio and the Early Renaissance developments of Giotto. The frescoes comprise a &quot;Poor Man&#x27;s Bible&quot; of Old Testament cycle, New Testament cycle, and Last Judgement, as well as an Annunciation, a Saint Sebastian, and the stories of a local saint, St Fina, as well as several smaller works.

===Old Testament cycle===

The wall of the left aisle had six decorated bays, of which the paintings of the first bay are in poor condition and those of the sixth have been damaged and in part destroyed by the insertion of the pipe organ. 
The remaining paintings, with the exception of a repainted panel in the sixth bay, are the work of Bartolo di Fredi, and, according to an inscription, were completed around 1356. The paintings are in three registers and proceed from left to right chronologically in each register.

====Upper level====
The upper register occupies the lunettes beneath the vault and depicts the story of Creation.
# Creation of the Firmament 
# Creation of Man
# Adam names the animals
# Creation of Eve
# God commands Adam and Eve not to touch the forbidden fruit
# The Original Sin (lost)

====Middle level====

The second register has ten remaining scenes, with two at the furthest right having been lost with the insertion of the organ. 
# The Expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden (very incomplete)
# Cain kills Abel (very incomplete)
# Noah and his family building the Ark
# Animals entering the Ark

# Job, plagued by boils, is visited by friends. (incomplete)
# (Lost scene)

===New Testament cycle===
The six decorated bays of the right aisle, with scenes of the New Testament, pose a problem of authorship. Giorgio Vasari states that they are the work of &quot;Barna of Siena&quot; and relates that Barna fell to his death from the scaffolding. The name &quot;Barna&quot; in relation to paintings at the Collegiate Church of San Gimignano appears to have originated in Lorenzo Ghiberti&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries&quot;. In 1927 the archivist Peleo Bacci made the suggestion that Barna had never existed and that the paintings are the work of Lippo Memmi. This hypothesis received no support and little comment for fifty years. In 1976 discussion of Bacci&#x27;s attribution was revived, with Moran suggesting that there had been a mis-transcription of &quot;Bartolo&quot; as &quot;Barna&quot;, with the name &quot;Bartolo&quot; referring to Bartolo di Fredi, painter of the Old Testament cycle.

The attribution of the New Testament cycle to Lippo Memmi, perhaps assisted by his brother Federico Memmi and father Memmo di Filippucci, is now generally agreed. Lippo Memmi was influenced by his more famous brother-in-law, Simone Martini. Lippo Memmi also painted a large Maesta in the Town Hall of San Gimignano, in imitation of that done by Simone Martini at the Town Hall of Siena. The New Testament cycle of the right aisle appears to pre-date the Old Testament cycle and is generally accepted to date from c.1335-1345.

The scenes within the New Testament cycle are organised into four separate narratives, and do not follow a clear left-to-right pattern as do those of the left aisle. As with the left aisle, they are divided into three registers, the upper being the lunettes between the vaults.

====Upper level====
The upper register shows the Birth of Christ. The series reads from right to left, in six bays.
# The Annunciation 
# The Nativity and adoration of the shepherds 
# The adoration of the Magi 
# The Presentation at the Temple 
# The Massacre of the Innocents 
# The Flight into Egypt

====Middle level====
The middle register shows scenes of the &quot;Life of Christ&quot;, beginning at the 4th bay, below the picture of the Presentation at the Temple, and reading left to right, with eight scenes. The scenes have been skilfully juxtaposed so that narrative elements may be compared or contrasted. Within the fourth bay is shown the Presentation of the Temple, Jesus sitting among the Doctors of the Temple of Jerusalem as a twelve-year-old, and Jesus before his crucifixion, enthroned, crowned with thorns and mocked.
# Jesus among the Doctors of the Temple of Jerusalem 
# The Baptism of Jesus 
# The Calling of Peter 
# The Wedding at Cana of Galilee (damaged in WWII) 
# The Transfiguration 
# The Resurrection of Lazarus 
# Jesus enters Jerusalem 
# The people welcome Jesus to Jerusalem (the final two scenes are a single event spread over two frames)

====Lower level====
The lower register, showing the Passion of Christ, continues beneath the Entry into Jerusalem, and is read from right to left in eight scenes over four bays. 
# The Last Supper
# Judas agrees to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver 
# Jesus prays in the Garden of Gethsemane 
# The Kiss of Judas 
# Jesus at the Praetorium 
# The Scourging of Jesus 
# Jesus crowned with thorns and mocked 
# Jesus carrying the cross to Calvary 

====Bays five and six====

Bay five, beneath the lunette of the Slaughter of the Innocents, has a single large scene of the Crucifixion.

Bay six, beneath the lunette of the Flight into Egypt contained four scenes (destroyed in the 15th century) of post-crucifixion events which are thought to have been: 
# The Deposition 
# The Descent into Limbo 
# The Resurrection 
# Pentecost

===The Last Judgement===
This scene is painted in fresco on the inner wall of the facade and the adjoining walls of the nave. The work was completed in 1393 by Taddeo di Bartolo, one of the foremost Sienese painters of the 14th century. The central section shows the figure of Christ as Judge, accompanied by the Virgin Mary and St John, with the Apostles. On the right wall is the image of Paradise, in a ruined state. On the left side Hell is represented, along with various depictions of the gruesome torments to be suffered by those who commit and of the Seven Deadly Sins.

===Chapel of Santa Fina===
 
This chapel off the right aisle, which has been described as &quot;one of the jewels of Renaissance architecture, painting and sculpture&quot;, is dedicated to a young girl, Serafina, known as &quot;Fina&quot; and regarded locally as a saint. Fina, a child renowned for her piety, was orphaned at an early age, and then suffered a disease which rendered her invalid. She lay each day on a wooden palette, and was nursed by two women. According to her legend, eight days before her death at the age of fifteen, Fina had a vision of Pope Gregory who told her that death was near. On the day of her death, 12 March 1253, the bells of San Gimignano rang spontaneously, and large pale mauve flowers grew around her palette. As her nurse laid out her body, her hand moved, touching the nurse and healing her of paralysis that she had suffered as the result of many hours of supporting Fina&#x27;s head. On the day of her funeral, a blind choir boy had his sight restored by touching her feet. It is said that mauve flowers bloom in San Gimignano every year on the anniversary of her death.

A chapel dedicated to St Fina was built off the right aisle by Giuliano da Maiano, and has architectural details and a finely carved altarpiece by Benedetto da Maiano. The side walls of the chapel were painted in fresco by Domenico Ghirlandaio around 1475, showing, on the walls, &quot;Santa Fina&#x27;s visitation by Pope Gregory&quot; and &quot;Santa Fina&#x27;s Funeral&quot;, with the various miracles including the two healings and an angel rings the bells in the background. The vault and spandrels were decorated by Sebastiano Mainardi and have figures of Evangelists, Prophets and Doctors of the Church.

===Chapel of the Conception===
The chapel was built in 1477 and modified in the 17th century. The side lunettes have frescoes by Niccolo di Lapi representing the &quot;Birth of the Virgin&quot; and St Philip Neri celebration mass. The vault shows the &quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot; painted by Pietro Dandini. The altarpiece is the &quot;Virgin of the Immaculate Conception&quot; by Ludovico Cardi, late 16th century.

===Other artworks===
====&quot;St Sebastian&quot;====
On the rear wall of the nave, beneath the &quot;Last Judgement&quot; is a fresco of the &quot;Martyrdom of St Sebastian&quot; painted by Benozzo Gozzoli in 1465. The work was commissioned by the people of San Gimignano as the result of a vow that they made to honour the saint, whose intervention was believed to have brought relief from an outbreak of plague in 1464. The painting shows the figure of Christ and the Virgin Mary in Glory, while below, St Sebastian, standing on a Classical plinth and bristling with arrows, suffers martyrdom and is crowned by angels.

Benozzo Gozzoli received his training under Lorenzo Ghiberti while working on the Baptistry doors. He fulfilled two other important commissions in San Gimignano. Both were at the Church of Sant&#x27; Agostino, a fresco cycle of the life of St Augustine of Hippo executed 1464-65, and another St Sebastian, showing the townsfolk sheltering beneath his cloak.

====&quot;The Annunciation&quot;====

In the Baptistery Loggia to the south of the church are several small frescoes of saints, and a major work, &quot;The Annunciation&quot;, previously attributed to Ghirlandaio but now believed to be the work of Sebastiano Mainardi and dated to 1482. In front of &quot;The Annunciation&quot; stands the font, which was removed from the church and placed in this position in 1632. It is hexagonal, with a sculptured relief on the side, that to the front being the &quot;Baptism of Christ&quot;, with the two adjoining panels containing kneeling angels. It is the work of the Sienese sculptor Giovanni di Cecco and was commissioned by the Wool-workers Guild in 1379.

====Works by Jacopo della Quercia and others====
* &quot;The Annunciate angel and the Virgin Mary&quot;, two figures carved in wood by Jacopo della Quercia stand towards the end of the nave. They were created around 1421 and later decorated with polychrome by Martino di Martolomeo. 
* &quot;Pope Gregory predicts the death of St Fina&quot;, an early 14th-century fresco in a lunette of the right nave arcade, thought to be the work of Nicolo di Segna di Bonaventura.
* The main altar of the church has a large marble ciborium and two kneeling angels with candlesticks, the work of Benedetto Maiano, created at the same time as the altarpiece and tabernacle in the Chapel of Santa Fina, 1475. 
* The crucifix of the chancel is by the Florentine sculptor, Giovanni Antonio Noferi, 1754. Noferi also designed the marble pavement of the chancel.

<text>Long-distance swimming is distinguished from ordinary swimming in that the distances involved are longer than are typically swum in pool competitions. When a given swim calls more on endurance than on outright speed, it is the more likely to be considered a long-distance swim. Long-distance swims, however, may take place in pools, such as the 1st official 24 hours World Championship in 1976 won by Peppo Biscarini with a record of 83.7 km (24 hour swims in a 50 m-long pool) or the current 25 meter pool world record of 2008 Olympic gold medalist Maarten van der Weijden. Some of the better-known long-distance swims are crossings of the English Channel, Catalina Channel, Fehmarn Belt and Cook Strait. 

Ultra-long-distance swimming is sometimes referred to as marathon swimming. The minimum distance that constitutes a marathon swim has dramatically shortened over time. Different organizations adopt various minimum distances. The swimming marathon events at the Olympic games have a distance of 10 km.

Long-distance swims tend to fall into one of two categories: (1) swims in which the start date and start time are chosen by the individual swimmer (often called solo-swims), and (2) swims that involve a group-start.

Long-distance swimming is one of the events wherein there are women&#x27;s records that beat men&#x27;s records under equal conditions.

==Organization regulations==

Swim organizations, for the purposes of their record keeping, often impose other rules. FINA and International Marathon Swimming Hall of Fame do not keep records for swims that employ thermal insulating material, drag reduction fabrics, buoyancy aids, breathing apparatus, propulsion prosthetics, etc. For major channel crossings, most organizations do allow the swimmer to use outside help, an example being that the swimmer swims alongside a boat that uses sophisticated electronics and telecommunications to help the swimmer take the easiest path through surface currents and tides. Such boats can also make the challenge easier for the swimmer by blocking wind and surface chop. Such boats also carry food and hot beverages for the swimmer to consume periodically during the swim (e.g. every 20 to 30 minutes).

In another variant, some swim organizations simply have different sets of records for different equipment scenarios (e.g. wetsuit and non-wetsuit divisions), similar to the structure of free diving record keeping.

== Long-distance swimming in the Netherlands ==

The Netherlands has a rich tradition in these races, which are known in Dutch as langebaanzwemmen (literally &quot;long-lane swimming&quot;). , some have been organised continually for over 50 years. Many Dutch competitors have also achieved prestige in the international arena, such as Herman Willemse, Judith de Nijs, Lenie de Nijs, Joke van Staveren, Monique Wildschut, Irene van der Laan, Hans van Goor, Edith van Dijk and Maarten van der Weijden (Olympic medalist).

In the Netherlands, there are three categories of &quot;langebaanzwemmen&quot;:
* &quot;Prestatietochten&quot; (lit. &quot;achievement-tour&quot;): distances over 250 m for all categories (inclusive of participants without a racing permit).
* &quot;Langeafstandzwemmen&quot; (lit. &quot;long-distance swimming): distances up to 10 km. This category includes open water events. In this category there are the &quot;Open Nationale Kampioenschappen&quot; in 5 km and 10 km freestyle, with separate events for professionals and amateurs, and
* &quot;Marathonzwemmen&quot; (lit. &quot;marathon swimming&quot;): distances over 10 km. The Nationale Kampioenschappen (national championships) in this category is a joint venture with neighbouring Belgium.

Most events are in the long-distance category, with around 25 in the Netherlands. An approximately equal number are organised in Flanders in Belgium. The waterways of the Low Countries, therefore, are some of the busiest in open-water swimming in the world.

<text>Canadian Forces Base Summerside (CFB Summerside) was an air force base located in St. Eleanors, Prince Edward Island, Canada, now part of the city of Summerside.

==RCAF Station Summerside==
===World War II===
The airfield was constructed by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) between 1940–1941 and was named RCAF Station Summerside.

It was home to No. 9 Service Flying Training School RCAF, a flight school that operated under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP). Relief or emergency airfields were located at nearby RCAF Station Mount Pleasant and Wellington. Airmen were trained on Harvards. In July 1942 No. 9 SFTS moved to RCAF Station Centralia and was replaced by No. 1 General Reconnaissance School RCAF which flew Ansons. No. 1 GRS was renamed to No. 1 Reconnaissance and Navigation School in 1945.

====Aerodrome information==== 
The airfield was constructed in the typical BCATP wartime pattern, with runways formed in a triangle.
In approximately 1942 the aerodrome was listed as RCAF Aerodrome - Summerside, Prince Edward Island at with a variation of 25 degrees west and elevation of . Six runways were listed as follows:

====Relief landing field – Mount Pleasant====
The primary relief landing field (R1) for RCAF Station Summerside was RCAF Station Mount Pleasant. The station was located east of the community of Ellerslie, Prince Edward Island.

====Relief landing field – Wellington====
The secondary relief landing field (R2) for RCAF Station Summerside was located north-east of the community of Wellington, Prince Edward Island. In approximately 1942 the aerodrome was listed as RCAF Aerodrome - Wellington, Prince Edward Island at with a variation of 24 degrees west and elevation of . Three runways were listed as follows:
===Cold War===
The station was closed in 1946 but reopened in 1947 with the formation of No. 1 Air Navigation School (ANS). This was a NATO training facility. No. 1 ANS left in 1953 and the Central Navigation School was established. In 1949 No. 2 (Maritime) Operational Training Unit started operation. The influx of personnel and their families required the building of more accommodation quarters. In 1949 the base housing was completed and named &quot;Slemon Park&quot; in honour of Air Marshal Roy Slemon.

During the Cold War, the base was home to anti-submarine and coastal patrol aircraft such as the Lancaster B.X, CP-122 Neptune, CP-107 Argus, and CP-121 Tracker. Other aircraft operated from Summerside include the CC-115 Buffalo and CH-113 Labrador. These aircraft were operated by various squadrons and units including No. 2 (Maritime) Operational Training Unit, No. 107 Rescue Unit, 413 Transport and Rescue Squadron, 420 Air Reserve Squadron, 880 Maritime Reconnaissance Squadron (Royal Canadian Navy), 31 Support Air Group (Royal Canadian Navy), and 415 Maritime Patrol Squadron.

On 1 February 1968, the merger of the three service branches into the unified Canadian Forces saw RCAF Station Summerside change its name to Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Summerside.

In 1977, the Government of Canada formally ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III), which mandated the creation of an Exclusive Economic Zone extending off all coasts. This created a requirement for military enforcement of sovereignty to protect natural resources within the EEZ, such as oil and gas reserves, and fisheries.

CFB Summerside&#x27;s primary mission evolved during the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s into providing support for Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the government department responsible for managing Canada&#x27;s ocean resources. CP-121 Trackers were used to patrol Georges Bank and the Grand Banks of Newfoundland to monitor foreign fishing fleets. Search and rescue (SAR) was a secondary role which was no less important to the civilian population of the Maritime Provinces which, relied on SAR aircraft for urgent medevac to large tertiary-care hospitals in Halifax, Nova Scotia and Moncton, New Brunswick, as well as for mariners and air crew who frequently found themselves in distress, requiring rescue.

The 1989 federal budget cuts to the Department of National Defence identified CFB Summerside as a candidate for base closure. At the time, the base employed some 1,200, and contributed about C$50 million to the province&#x27;s economy each year. Local concern groups were formed to protest the closure. On 14 May 1989, about 10,000 people (more than the population of Summerside at the time) marched in protest. City streets were festooned in yellow ribbons, a symbol of opposition to the closure. About 400 Prince Edward Islanders travelled to Ottawa in June 1989 to protest at Parliament Hill. In response to this opposition, then-minister of national defence, Bill McKnight, told the House of Commons, &quot;there is no military operational reason to maintain that base&quot;. In 1991 the base was closed and the majority of military units were transferred to CFB Greenwood in Nova Scotia.

===Past scheduled passenger airline service===

The airfield was served by Eastern Provincial Airways during the 1960s and early 1970s which operated nonstop flights to Moncton and the Magdalen Islands as well as direct service via a stop in Charlottetown to Halifax; Sydney, NS; Deer Lake, NL; Gander, NL; and St. John&#x27;s, NL with Douglas DC-3 prop aircraft and Handley Page Dart Herald turboprop aircraft.

==Current use==

The entire property including airfield, housing units, hangars and support structures was renamed Slemon Park and was transferred to a local development authority named &quot;Slemon Park Corporation&quot;. Today the site is host to a mix of public and private sector operations, including Vector Aerospace and several other aerospace companies. Employment at Slemon Park facilities now exceeds pre-1991 levels.

The airfield remains active as the Summerside Airport. Though the airfield has the longest runways in the province, it only supports general aviation with the closest scheduled passenger airline flights being offered via the Charlottetown Airport.

During its existence as an air force base, CFB Summerside was jurisdictionally situated in the township of Lot 17. In the 1995 municipal amalgamation that saw the city of Summerside created, the city&#x27;s municipal boundary was extended to divide the former base, with the Summerside Airport and the industrial facilities of Slemon Park remaining in Lot 17, while the residential area of Slemon Park was placed within the city of Summerside.

==Incidents and accidents==
* On 31 March 1977, a Canadair CP-107 Argus maritime patrol aircraft crashed while attempting to land at the base. Of the 16 crew members on board, three were killed.
* On 24 May 1986, a CF-18 fighter jet attached to 425 Tactical Fighter Squadron at CFB Bagotville crashed into Malpeque Bay shortly after taking off from CFB Summerside, killing the pilot, Captain Tristan De Koninck. It was the third crash of a CF-18.

<text>Hungary is a unitary parliamentary republic in Central Europe. It covers an area of , situated in the Carpathian Basin and bordered by Slovakia to the north, Romania to the east, Serbia to the south, Croatia to the southwest, Slovenia to the west, Austria to the northwest, and Ukraine to the northeast. With about 10 million inhabitants, Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union.

<doc id="866317" wikidata="Q1493627" url="?curid=866317" title="Gavelkind">
<text>Gavelkind () was a system of land tenure chiefly associated with the Celtic law in Ireland and Wales and with the legal traditions of the English county of Kent.

The word may have originated from the Old Irish phrases &quot;Gabhaltas-cinne&quot; or &quot;Gavail-kinne&quot;, which meant &quot;family settlement&quot; (Modern Gaelic &quot;gabhail-cine&quot;). The term came to describe all tenure and inheritance practices where land was divided equally among sons or other heirs.

Kent&#x27;s inheritance pattern was a system of partible inheritance and bears a resemblance to Salic patrimony. As such, it may bear witness to a wider Germanic tradition that was probably ancient. Over the centuries, various acts were passed to disgavel individual manors, but the custom was only fully abolished in England and Wales by the Administration of Estates Act 1925.

==Gavelkind in Kent==

Before the abolition of gavelkind tenure by the Administration of Estates Act 1925, all land in Kent was presumed to be held by gavelkind until the contrary was proved. It was more correctly described as socage tenure, subject to the custom of gavelkind. The chief peculiarities of the custom were the following:

* A tenant could pass on part or all of his lands as a fiefdom from the age of 15.
* On conviction for a felony, the lands were not subject to corruption of blood.
* The tenant could generally dispose of his lands in his will.
* In case of intestacy, the estate was passed on to all sons or their representatives in equal shares, with all sons being left equally a gentleman. Although females claiming in their own right were given a second preference, they could still inherit through representation.
* A dowager was entitled to half of the land.
* A widow who had no children was entitled to inherit half of the estate as a tenant as long as she remained unmarried.

Gavelkind, an example of customary law in England, was thought to have existed before the Norman Conquest of 1066, but was generally superseded by the feudal law of primogeniture introduced by the Normans. Its survival in Kent has been popularly attributed to favorable terms negotiated between the people of the county and William the Conqueror, who was unable to subdue them, although this suggestion has been debated by scholars.

==Gavelkind in Wales==
In medieval Wales, a legal framework had developed based on the ancient Celtic laws and traditions similar to those in Ireland. These included a custom of gavelkind inheritance known as &quot;.

&quot;Cyfran&quot; was an ancient tradition passed down orally by jurists and bards until the mid-10th century, when the laws were codified during the reign of Hywel Dda. The &quot;Cyfraith Hywel&quot; would become the most well-known and widely-adopted Welsh legal structure, and many of the laws were concerned with inheritance. The concept of &quot;cyfran&quot; stated that on a landowner&#x27;s death, his land would be divided equally among all of the sons, including those who were illegitimate.

The continual division of lands and titles with each successive generation has been seen by some historians as detrimental to the success and stability of Welsh princes and lords, especially compared to the system of primogeniture practised in Norman England and by the Marcher Lords, whose entire patrimony was often passed on directly to the eldest son. The Welsh historian Philip Yorke, writing in 1799, summarised the situation:
 
The Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542 saw the Welsh legal system being replaced with English law, and the laws associated with gavelkind were replaced with those of primogeniture. However, as in England, the custom of gavelkind was not finally abolished until the Administration of Estates Act 1925.

==Gavelkind in Ireland==

In Ireland, gavelkind was a species of tribal succession by which the land, instead of being divided at the death of the holder amongst his sons, was thrown again into the common stock and redivided among the surviving members of the sept.

Under Traditional Irish law, land was divided at the death of the holder among his sons. The Normans called the Irish inheritance law &quot;gavelkind&quot; because of its apparent similarity to Jutish gavelkind inheritance in Kent.

<doc id="866319" wikidata="Q735212" url="?curid=866319" title="Grant Sawyer">
<text>Frank Grant Sawyer (December 14, 1918 – February 19, 1996) was an American politician. He was the 21st Governor of Nevada from 1959 to 1967. He was a member of the Democratic Party.

==Early life==
Sawyer was born on December 14, 1918, in Twin Falls, Idaho. He was the son of two osteopaths, Harry William and Bula Belle Cameron Sawyer. Sawyer&#x27;s father was also a state legislator in Nevada.

Sawyer served in the U.S. Army during World War II. He married Bette Norene Hoge on August 1, 1946.

==Education==
Sawyer attended Linfield College for two years and later enrolled at the University of Nevada, Reno, where he graduated in 1941. While a student at Nevada, Sawyer was a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. Sawyer then went to The George Washington University Law School but left to enlist in the army at the beginning of World War II. After his military service he enrolled at Georgetown University, where he received a law degree in 1946.

==Political career==
He served as District Attorney for Elko County, Nevada from 1950 to 1958. Sawyer served as the governor of Nevada from 1959 to 1967. He was defeated in his attempt at a third term by Paul Laxalt.

Governor Sawyer worked to push through civil rights policies and legislation, a difficult process in a state that had been accused of being &quot;the Mississippi of the West.&quot;

He was responsible for the development of the modern casino regulatory system with the passage of the Gaming Control Act of 1959 and the formation of the Nevada Gaming Commission. Sawyer swam against the tide of history when he unsuccessfully fought to prevent corporate ownership over Nevada casinos.

Sawyer was the first western governor to endorse the fledgling presidential campaign of Massachusetts Senator John F. Kennedy in 1960.

Commentators have reflected on Sawyer&#x27;s career as follows: Grant Sawyer served two turbulent terms as Nevada&#x27;s governor from 1959 to 1967. Sawyer was an advocate of progressive change. By the late fifties he had come so far from his start in the conservative political machine of Senator Patrick McCarran that many powerful Nevadans considered his policies on education, the environment, and civil rights to be dangerously radical. When he demanded meaningful regulatory control over casino gaming and took decisive action to purge the industry of its mob connections, the establishment&#x27;s resistance stiffened. Eventually, Sawyer&#x27;s positions brought him into open conflict with special interests and led to a collision with the justice department of the federal government, but he never backed down.

==Later years==
In 1967, Sawyer co-founded Lionel Sawyer &amp; Collins. For many years, this was the largest private law firm in Nevada. The firm ceased operations on December 31, 2014, with nineteen of its lawyers joining Fennemore Craig.

Sawyer died on February 19, 1996, in Las Vegas, Nevada of complications of a debilitating stroke suffered in 1993, at the age of 77. His wife Bette, a native of Baker City, Oregon, died on September 11, 2002, at the age of 79. They are both interred at the Palm Memorial Park in Las Vegas, Nevada.

==Legacy==
The following facilities are named for the former governor:
*The Grant Sawyer Building, a state office building, located at 555 East Washington Avenue, Las Vegas
*Grant Sawyer Middle School, located at 5450 Redwood Street, Las Vegas
*The Grant Sawyer Center for Justice Studies, part of the School of Social Research and Justice Studies at the University of Nevada, Reno
