<text>The Southern Episcopal Church (SEC) is an Anglican Christian denomination established in Nashville, Tennessee in 1953, and formally organised in 1962, in reaction to liberal political and theological trends within the Episcopal Church USA. It is connected to the Continuing Anglican movement, although it was formed more than a decade before the movement began.

The SEC does not consider itself a new denomination, but rather as providing a church home for Episcopalians who wished to maintain their Anglican faith and tradition. It uses the 1928 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; for its liturgy.

The leader of the initial group was Burnice Hoyle Webster, a medical doctor who became presiding bishop. The current presiding bishop is William Martin Sloane.

The SEC has one seminary, the Holy Trinity College and Seminary, which offers classes by distance studies.

<text>Recreate for Growth (, often just Recrear) was a centre-right political party in Argentina, principally active in the Province of Buenos Aires.

It existed from 2002 to 2009 and again during 2020, from August to November.

==Ideology and principles==
López Murphy defines Recrear as &quot;simply liberal&quot;, a supporter of modern capitalism.

He maintains that he tried with Recrear &quot;to have a serious liberal party, organized as in the advanced democracies of the world, which continues with the traditions of Juan Bautista Alberdi and Leandro Alem.&quot;

López Murphy was against gay marriage, decriminalization of drug use and abortion.

==History==
The party was formed in March 2002, mostly by market-oriented members of the Radical Civic Union, headed by Ricardo López Murphy.

According to &quot;Página 12&quot;, a progressive newspaper, Recrear was a republican and honest right-wing and López Murphy&#x27;s dream was to expand the historic ten percent that the Argentine right-wing reaches in elections.

The Recrear Federal Movement is a national alliance formed in 2003 between Recrear itself and the Federal Movement of various provincial parties – the Salta Renewal Party, the Democratic Progressive Party, the Democratic Party of Mendoza, the Federal Party, the Liberal Party of Corrientes, the Democratic Party of the City of Buenos Aires, the Democratic Liberal Party of Córdoba, the Catamarca Popular Movement, the Provincial Union of Entre Ríos, the Party of the Hope of the Province of Buenos Aires, the Independent Citizens of Tucumán and the Federal North of Jujuy. López Murphy as the movement&#x27;s presidential candidate and Ricardo Gómez Diez of Salta for vice-president in the 2003 elections, ending in third place with 18%.

In 2005 the party formed an alliance with Buenos Aires&#x27; party Commitment to Change led by Mauricio Macri. The alliance has attempted to form a wide-ranging center-right front, especially with Neuquén&#x27;s party, the Neuquino People&#x27;s Movement (&quot;Movimiento Popular Neuquino&quot; - MPN), for the 2005 parliamentary elections. Recrear and its allies won nine members of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies, with those of some of Recrear&#x27;s constituent provincial parties. López Murphy subsequently fell out with Jorge Sobisch, leader of the MPN, and formally teamed up with Commitment to Change to form a new centre-right electoral front, Republican Proposal (PRO).

Following the election, López Murphy stood down from the leadership of the Party and in 2008, Congressman Esteban Bullrich was elected to replace him. Bullrich backed the ongoing alliance with Macri and PRO, whilst López Murphy had backed Castor López, calling for the autonomy of the Party. In April 2008, López Murphy resigned from the Party and later set up another new party, which has pursued closer ties with the Civic Coalition.

In August 2009, the party was finally absorbed by the Republican Proposal.

Recrear had observer status within both the Liberal International, and the conservative Union of Latin American Parties.

In August 2020, more than a decade after Recrear was dissolved, López Murphy refounded the party for the 2021 Argentine legislative election. In November, Recrear, along with the Libertarian Party of Argentina, Mejorar, and Unidos, formed the Republicanos Unidos alliance. They have considered allying themselves with libertarian economist José Luis Espert for the legislative election.

<text>The Secretary of Transportation Outstanding Unit Award is a U.S. government unit decoration which was established in 1994. The Presidential Unit Citation and Joint Meritorious Unit Award are considered senior to the Secretary of Transportation Outstanding Unit Award. Additional awards of the decoration were denoted by gold award stars.

Prior to 2003, the award was a unit award of the United States Coast Guard. During the time period issued, it was the highest Coast Guard unit award that could be awarded and was presented to those Coast Guard units which performed outstanding service to the Coast Guard as a whole.

On November 3, 1994, Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena awarded the Secretary of Transportation Outstanding Achievement Medal to the Coast Guard as a whole. The award was mounted on a plaque and presented to Admiral Robert E. Kramek, then-Commandant of the Coast Guard. In order to provide members of the Coast Guard with a device denoting this award, the Secretary of Transportation Outstanding Unit Award was issued. This award consists of the ribbon-only to the Secretary of Transportation Outstanding Achievement Medal, mounted in a gold frame.

The Secretary of Transportation Outstanding Unit Award was awarded for two periods of service to Coast Guard Units and personnel. The first was to all Coast Guard Active Duty Personnel, Reservists, Civilians, and Auxiliarists for participation in an extended period of migrant interdiction as well as natural and environmental disasters from October 1, 1993 to September 30, 1994. The second period of service was for Coast Guard Activities New York–Guarding Liberty Task Force from September 11, 2001 to October 22, 2001. This period qualifies for the Operational Distinguishing Device.

Since the transfer of the Coast Guard to the Department of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Transportation Outstanding Unit Award has only been bestowed twice. The first was in 2006 when President George W. Bush awarded it to the United States Merchant Marine Academy for all of the work the midshipmen performed in assisting with the transportation of servicemen and supplies in the years following the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center. The second occurred in 2022 when Secretary Pete Buttigieg awarded it to the United States Merchant Marine Academy midshipmen who were in attendance between March 13, 2020 and June 18, 2022. The second case was due to the regiment of midshipmen’s leadership and relentless efforts to excel on campus, but more importantly for manning the ships during the logistical crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="848148" wikidata="Q1236490" url="?curid=848148" title="Wulfstan (died 1023)">
<text>Wulfstan (sometimes Wulfstan II or Lupus; died 28 May 1023) was an English Bishop of London, Bishop of Worcester, and Archbishop of York. He is thought to have begun his ecclesiastical career as a Benedictine monk. He became the Bishop of London in 996. In 1002 he was elected simultaneously to the diocese of Worcester and the archdiocese of York, holding both in plurality until 1016, when he relinquished Worcester; he remained archbishop of York until his death. It was perhaps while he was at London that he first became well known as a writer of sermons, or homilies, on the topic of Antichrist. In 1014, as archbishop, he wrote his most famous work, a homily which he titled the &quot;Sermo Lupi ad Anglos&quot;, or the &quot;Sermon of the Wolf to the English&quot;.

Besides sermons Wulfstan was also instrumental in drafting law codes for both kings Æthelred the Unready and Cnut the Great of England. He is considered one of the two major writers of the late Anglo-Saxon period in England. After his death in 1023, miracles were said to have occurred at his tomb, but attempts to have him declared a saint never bore fruit.

==Life==
Wulfstan&#x27;s early life is obscure, but he was certainly the uncle of one Beorhtheah, his successor at Worcester but one, and the uncle of Wulfstan of Worcester. About Wulfstan&#x27;s youth we know nothing. He probably had familial ties to the Fenlands in East Anglia, and to Peterborough specifically. Although there is no direct evidence of his ever being monastic, the nature of Wulfstan&#x27;s later episcopal career and his affinity with the Benedictine Reform argue that he had once studied and professed as a Benedictine monk, perhaps at Winchester. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, Wulfstan was consecrated bishop of London in 996, succeeding Aelfstan. Besides the notice in the Chronicle, the first record of his name is in a collection of nine Latin penitential letters collected by him, three of which were issued by him as bishop of London, and one by him as &quot;Archbishop of the English&quot;. The other five letters in the collection (only one of which is addressed to Wulfstan, as archbishop) were issued by Pope Gregory V and by a Pope John (either Pope John XVII or Pope John XVIII). In the letters issued by Wulfstan as bishop of London he styles himself &quot;Lupus episcopus&quot;, meaning &quot;the bishop Wolf.&quot; &quot;Lupus&quot; is the Latin form of the first element of his Old English name, which means &quot;wolf-stone.&quot;

In 1002 Wulfstan was elected Archbishop of York and was immediately translated to that see. Holding York also brought him control over the diocese of Worcester, as at that time it was practice in England to hold &quot;the potentially disaffected northern archbishopric in plurality with a southern see.&quot; He held both Worcester and York until 1016, resigning Worcester to Leofsige while retaining York. There is evidence, however, that he retained influence over Worcester even after this time, and that Leofsige perhaps acted &quot;only as a suffragan to Wulfstan.&quot; Although holding two or more episcopal sees in plurality was both uncanonical and against the spirit of the Benedictine Reform, Wulfstan had inherited this practice from previous archbishops of York, and he was not the last to hold York and Worcester in plurality.

Wulfstan must have early on garnered the favour of powerful men, particularly Æthelred king of England, for we find him personally drafting all royal law codes promulgated under Æthelred&#x27;s reign from 1005 to 1016. There is no doubt that Wulfstan had a penchant for law; his knowledge of previous Anglo-Saxon law (both royal and ecclesiastical), as well as ninth-century Carolingian law, was considerable. This surely made him a suitable choice for the king&#x27;s legal draftsman. But it is also likely that Wulfstan&#x27;s position as archbishop of York, an important centre in the then politically sensitive northern regions of the English kingdom, made him not only a very influential man in the North, but also a powerful ally for the king and his family in the South. It is indicative of Wulfstan&#x27;s continuing political importance and savvy that he also acted as legal draftsman for, and perhaps advisor to, the Danish king Cnut, who took England&#x27;s West Saxon throne in 1016.

==Homilist==

Wulfstan was one of the most distinguished and effective Old English prose writers. His writings cover a wide range of topics in an even greater range of genres, including homilies (or sermons), secular laws, religious canons, and political theory. With Ælfric of Eynsham, he is one of the two major vernacular writers in early eleventh-century England, a period which, ecclesiastically, was still very much enamoured of and greatly influenced by the Benedictine Reform. The Benedictine Reform was a movement which sought to institute monastic standards among the secular clergy, a movement made popular by the churchmen of the Carolingian Empire in the ninth and tenth centuries. The Reform promoted a regular (i.e. based on a &quot;regula&quot;, or rule) life for priests and clerics, a strict church hierarchy, the primacy of the Roman see, the authority of codified or canonical church law, and stressed the importance of catholic, that is universal, church practices throughout all Christendom. These ideas could only thrive in a social and political atmosphere which recognised the importance of both the clergy&#x27;s and the laity&#x27;s obedience to the authority of the church on all things spiritual, and also on many things secular and juridical. This was one of the main theoretical models behind much of Wulfstan&#x27;s legal and quasi-legal writings. But Wulfstan was not blind to the fact that, in order for this Reform model to thrive in England, the English clergy and laity (especially the laity) needed to be educated in the basic tenets of the faith. Nothing less than the legitimacy of English Christendom rested on Englishmen&#x27;s steadfastness on certain fundamental Christian beliefs and practices, like, for example, knowledge of Christ&#x27;s life and passion, memorisation of the Pater Noster and the Apostles&#x27; Creed, proper baptism, and the correct date and method of celebrating Easter mass. It is towards the promotion of such beliefs and practices, that Wulfstan engaged in writing a number of homilies dedicated to educating both clergy and laity in those Christian fundamentals which he saw as so important for both the flourishing of Christian lives and the success of the English polity.

In a series of homilies begun during his tenure as Bishop of London, Wulfstan attained a high degree of competence in rhetorical prose, working with a distinctive rhythmical system based around alliterative pairings. He used intensifying words, distinctive vocabulary and compounds, rhetorical figures, and repeated phrases as literary devices. These devices lend Wulfstan&#x27;s homilies their tempo-driven, almost feverish, quality, allowing them to build toward multiple climaxes. An example from one of his earliest sermons, titled &quot;Secundum Lucam,&quot; describes with vivid rhetorical force the unpleasantries of Hell (notice the alliteration, parallelism, and rhyme):

Wa þam þonne þe ær geearnode helle wite. Ðær is ece bryne grimme gemencged, &amp; ðær is ece gryre; þær is granung &amp; wanung &amp; aa singal heof; þær is ealra yrmða gehwylc &amp; ealra deofla geþring. Wa þam þe þær sceal wunian on wite. Betere him wære þæt he man nære æfre geworden þonne he gewurde.

*&quot;Woe then to him who has earned for himself the torments of Hell. There there is everlasting fire roiling painfully, and there there is everlasting filth. There there is groaning and moaning and always constant wailing. There there is every kind of misery, and the press of every kind of devil. Woe to him who dwells in torment: better it were for him that he were never born, than that he become thus.&quot;

This type of heavy-handed, though effective, rhetoric immediately made Wulfstan&#x27;s homilies popular tools for use at the pulpit.

There is good evidence that Wulfstan&#x27;s homiletic style was appreciated by his contemporaries. While yet bishop of London, in 1002 he received an anonymous letter in Latin praising his style and eloquence. In this letter, an unknown contemporary refuses to do a bit of translation for Wulfstan because he fears he could never properly imitate the Bishop&#x27;s style. The Chronicle of Ely said of his preaching that &quot;when he spoke, it was as if his listeners were hearing the very wisdom of God Himself.&quot; Though they were rhetorically ornate, Wulfstan&#x27;s homilies show a conscious effort to avoid the intellectual conceits presumably favoured by educated (i.e. monastic) audiences; his target audience was the common English Christian, and his message was suited to everyone who wished to flock to the cathedral to hear it. Wulfstan refused to include in his works confusing or philosophical concepts, speculation, or long narratives – devices which other homilies of the time regularly employed (likely to the dismay of the average parishioner). He also rarely used Latin phrases or words, though a few of his homilies do survive in Latin form, versions that were either drafts for later English homilies, or else meant to be addressed to a learned clergy. Even so, even his Latin sermons employ a straightforward approach to sermonising. Wulfstan&#x27;s homilies are concerned only with the &quot;bare bones, but these he invests with a sense of urgency of moral or legal rigorism in a time of great danger&quot;.

The of Wulfstan&#x27;s homiletic works is somewhat ambiguous, as it is often difficult to tell if a homily in his style was actually written by Wulfstan, or is merely the work of someone who had appreciated Wulfstanian style and imitated it. However, throughout his episcopal career, he is believed to have written upwards of 30 sermons in Old English. The number of his Latin sermons has not yet been established. He may also have been responsible, wholly or in part, for other extant anonymous Old English sermons, for his style can be detected in a range of homiletic texts which cannot be directly attributed to him. However, as mentioned, some scholars believe that Wulfstan&#x27;s powerful rhetorical style produced imitators, whose homilies would now be difficult to distinguish from genuine Wulfstanian homilies. Those homilies which are certainly by Wulfstan can be divided into &#x27;blocks&#x27;, that is by subject and theme, and in this way it can be seen that at different points in his life Wulfstan was concerned with different aspects of Christian life in England. The first &#x27;block&#x27; was written ca. 996–1002 and is concerned with eschatology, that is, the end of the world. These homilies give frequent descriptions of the coming of Antichrist and the evils that will befall the world before Christ&#x27;s Second Coming. They likely play on the anxiety that surely developed as the end of the first millennium AD approached. The second &#x27;block&#x27;, written around 1002–1008, is concerned with the tenets of the Christian faith. The third &#x27;block&#x27;, written around 1008–1020, concerns archiepiscopal functions. The fourth and final &#x27;block&#x27;, written around 1014–1023, known as the &quot;Evil Days&quot; &#x27;block&#x27;, concerns the evils that befall a kingdom and people who do not live proper Christian lives. This final block contains his most famous homily, the &quot;Sermo Lupi ad Anglos&quot;, where Wulfstan rails against the deplorable customs of his time, and sees recent Viking invasions as God&#x27;s punishment of the English for their lax ways. About 1008 (and again in a revision about 1016) he wrote a lengthy work which, although not strictly homiletic, summarises many of the favourite points he had hitherto expounded upon in his homilies. Titled by modern editors as the &quot;Institutes of Polity&quot;, it is a piece of &#x27;estates literature&#x27; which details, from the perspective of a Christian polity, the duties of each member of society, beginning with the top (the king) and ending at the bottom (common folk).

==Language==
Wulfstan was a native speaker of Old English. He was also a competent Latinist. As York was at the centre of a region of England that had for some time been colonised by people of Scandinavian descent, it is possible that Wulfstan was familiar with, or perhaps even bilingual in, Old Norse. He may have helped incorporate Scandinavian vocabulary into Old English. Dorothy Whitelock remarks that &quot;the influence of his sojourns in the north is seen in his terminology. While in general he writes a variety of late West Saxon literary language, he uses in some texts words of Scandinavian origin, especially in speaking of the various social classes.&quot; In some cases, Wulfstan is the only one known to have used a word in Old English, and in some cases such words are of Scandinavian origin. Some words of his that have been recognised as particularly Scandinavian are

==Church reform and royal service==

Wulfstan was very involved in the reform of the English church, and was concerned with improving both the quality of Christian faith and the quality of ecclesiastical administration in his dioceses (especially York, a relatively impoverished diocese at this time). Towards the end of his episcopate in York, he established a small monastery in Gloucester, which had to be re-established in 1058 after being burned. In addition to his religious and literary career, Wulfstan enjoyed a lengthy and fruitful career as one of England&#x27;s foremost statesmen. Under both Æthelred II and Cnut, Wulfstan was primarily responsible for the drafting of English law codes relating to both secular and ecclesiastical affairs, and seems to have held a prominent and influential position at court. He drew up the laws that Æthelred issued at Enham in 1008, which dealt with the cult of St Edward the Martyr, the raising and equipping of ships and ship&#x27;s crews, the payment of tithes, and a ban on the export of (Christian) slaves from the kingdom. Pushing for religious, social, political, and moral reforms, Wulfstan &quot;wrote legislation to reassert the laws of earlier Anglo-Saxon kings and bring order to a country that had been unsettled by war and influx of Scandinavians.&quot; 
In 1009 Wulfstan wrote the edict that Æthelred II issued calling for the whole nation to fast and pray for three days during Thorkell&#x27;s raids on England, in a national act of penance. Only water and bread were to be eaten, people should walk to church barefoot, a payment of one penny from each hide of land was to be made, and everyone should attend Mass every day of the three days. Anyone not participating would be fined or flogged. After Cnut conquered England, Wulfstan quickly became an advisor to the new king, as evidenced by Wulfstan&#x27;s influence on the law code issued by Cnut. After the death of Lyfing, Archbishop of Canterbury in 1020, Wulfstan consecrated his successor Æthelnoth in 1020, and wrote to Cnut asking the king to grant the same rights and dignities for the new archbishop that previous archbishops had held. Wulfstan also wrote the laws that were issued by Cnut at Winchester in 1021 or 1022. These laws continued in force throughout the 11th century, as they were the laws referred to in Domesday Book as &quot;the law of King Edward&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
Wulfstan died at York on 28 May 1023. His body was taken for burial to the monastery of Ely, in accordance with his wishes. Miracles are ascribed to his tomb by the &quot;Liber Eliensis&quot;, but it does not appear that any attempt to declare him a saint was made beyond this. The historian Denis Bethell called him the &quot;most important figure in the English Church in the reigns of Æthelred II and Cnut.&quot;

Wulfstan&#x27;s writings influenced a number of writers in late Old English literature. There are echoes of Wulfstan&#x27;s writings in the 1087 entry of the &quot;Peterborough Chronicle&quot;, a version of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; written at Peterborough Abbey. This entry has long been famous as it deals with the death of King William the Conqueror, and contrasts his worldly power with his status after death. Other suggestions of Wulfstan&#x27;s writing occur in works of Old English, including the &quot;Soul&#x27;s Address to the Body&quot;. His law codes, which were written under Æthelred and Cnut, remained in effect through the reign of King Edward the Confessor, and were still being reaffirmed in 1100, when King Henry I of England swore a coronation oath to observe the laws of King Edward.

The unique 11th-century manuscript of the Early English &quot;Apollonius of Tyre&quot; may only have survived because it was bound into a book together with Wulfstan&#x27;s homilies.

==Works==
Wulfstan wrote some works in Latin, and numerous works in Old English, then the vernacular. He has also been credited with a few short poems. His works can generally be divided into homiletic, legal, and philosophical categories.

Wulfstan&#x27;s best-known homily is &quot;Sermo Lupi ad Anglos&quot;, or &quot;Sermon of the Wolf to the English.&quot; In it he proclaims the depredations of the &quot;Danes&quot; (who were, at that point, primarily Norwegian invaders) a scourge from God to lash the English for their sins. He calls upon them to repent of their sinful ways and &quot;return to the faith of baptism, where there is protection from the fires of hell.&quot; He also wrote many homilies relating to the Last Days and the coming of the Antichrist. Age of the Antichrist was a popular theme in Wulfstan&#x27;s homilies, which also include the issues of death and Judgment Day. Six homilies that illustrate this theme include: &quot;Secundum Matheum, Secundum Lucam, De Anticristo, De Temporibus Antichrist&quot;, &quot;Secundum Marcum&quot; and &quot;De Falsis Deis&quot;. &quot;De Antichristo&quot; was the &quot;first full development of the Antichrist theme&quot;, and Wulfstan addressed it to the clergy. Believing that he lived at the time right before the Antichrist was to come, he felt compelled to diligently warn and teach the clergy to withstand the dishonest teaching of the enemies of God. These six homilies also include: emphasis that the hour of the Antichrist is very near, warnings that the English should be aware of false Christs who will attempt to seduce men, warnings that God will pass judgement on man&#x27;s faithfulness, discussion of man&#x27;s sins, evils of the world, and encouragement to love God and do his will. He wrote the &quot;Canons of Edgar&quot; and &quot;The Law of Edward and Guthrum&quot; which date before 1008. The &quot;Canons&quot; was written to instruct the secular clergy serving a parish in the responsibilities of their position. &quot;The Law of Edward and Guthrum&quot;, on the other hand, is an ecclesiastical law handbook. Modern editors have paid most attention to his homilies: they have been edited by Arthur Napier, by Dorothy Whitelock, and by Dorothy Bethurum. Since that publication, other works that were likely authored by Wulfstan have been identified; a forthcoming edition by Andy Orchard will update the canon of Wulfstan&#x27;s homilies. Wulfstan was also a book collector; he is responsible for amassing a large collection of texts pertaining to canon law, the liturgy, and episcopal functions. This collection is known as Wulftan&#x27;s &quot;Commonplace Book.&quot; A significant part of the Commonplace book consists of a work once known as the &quot;Excerptiones pseudo-Ecgberhti&quot;, though it has most recently been edited as Wulfstan&#x27;s Canon Law Collection (a.k.a. &quot;Collectio canonum Wigorniensis&quot;). This work is a collection of conciliar decrees and church canons, most of which he culled from numerous ninth and tenth-century Carolingian works. This work demonstrates the wide range of Wulfstan&#x27;s reading and studies. He sometimes borrowed from this collection when he wrote his later works, especially the law codes of Æthelred. There are also a number of works which are associated with the archbishop, but whose authorship is unknown, such as the &quot;Late Old English Handbook for the Use of a Confessor&quot;.

==Style==

Wulfstan&#x27;s style is admired by many sources, easily recognisable and exceptionally distinguished. &quot;Much Wulfstan material is, more-over, attributed largely or even solely on the basis of his highly idiosyncratic prose style, in which strings of syntactically independent two-stress phrases are linked by complex patterns of alliteration and other kinds of sound play. Indeed, so idiosyncratic is Wulfstan’s style that he is even ready to rewrite minutely works prepared for him by Ǣlfric&quot;. From this identifiable style, 26 sermons can be attributed to Wulfstan, 22 of which are written in Old English, the others in Latin. However, it&#x27;s suspected that many anonymous materials are Wulfstan&#x27;s as well, and his handwriting has been found in many manuscripts, supplementing or correcting material. He wrote more than just sermons, including law-codes and sections of prose.

Certainly he must have been a talented writer, gaining a reputation of eloquence while he still lived in London. In a letter to him, &quot;the writer asks to be excused from translating something Wulfstan had asked him to render into English and pleads as an excuse his lack of ability in comparison with the bishop’s skill&quot;. Similarly, &quot;[o]ne early student of Wulfstan, Einenkel, and his latest editor, Jost, agree in thinking he wrote verse and not prose&quot; (Continuations, 229). This suggests Wulfstan&#x27;s writing is not only eloquent, but poetic, and among many of his rhetorical devices is marked rhythm (229). Taking a look at Wulfstan&#x27;s actual manuscripts, presented by Volume 17 of Early English Manuscripts in Facsimile, it becomes apparent that his writing was exceptionally neat and well structured – even his notes in the margins are well organised and tidy, and his handwriting itself is ornate but readable.

<doc id="848152" wikidata="Q3472399" url="?curid=848152" title="Hillsboro, New Mexico">
<text>Hillsboro is an unincorporated community in Sierra County, New Mexico, United States, located in the southwestern part of the state. It was founded in 1877, following the discovery of gold. The community was the county seat of Sierra County from 1884 until 1936, when Hot Springs (now called Truth or Consequences) became the county seat.

The town was named Hillsborough by prospectors in December 1877, but later shortened to Hillsboro. By 1880, the town had four companies of soldiers and 400 miners, but the population soon grew to 700. A county courthouse was built in 1892. By 1907, the population was 1200. A flood on 10 June 1914 caused considerable damage to many town buildings. New Mexico State Road 152 and NM 27 intersect in and bisect the town.

==Geology==
The first house was built in August 1877 after two prospectors, Dan Dugan and Dave Stitzel, working in the area of the future Opportunity Mine, collected loose pieces of rock (float is the geologic term) assayed at $160 per ton in gold and silver. Soon, ore was discovered at the nearby Rattlesnake vein (geology) by Dugan and Frank Pitcher, and a placer deposit of gold was found in November at the Rattlesnake and Wicks gulches. Ore was pulverized with arrastres located in Hillsboro, including a 10-stamp mill built in 1878. Total production prior to 1904 was about $6,750,000. Between 1911 and 1931, total production of gold ore was 836 tons, gold-copper-silver ore was 5,470 tons, and copper ore was 200 tons.
In his report, Harley wrote, &quot;The ore deposits of the Hillsboro or Las Animas mining district are of four general types as follows: (1) fissure veins in andesite flows, (2) disseminated deposits in monzonite porphyry, (3) replacement deposits in limestone, and (4) placer gold deposits.&quot;

The Copper Flat volcano to the northeast of Hillsboro is the source of the gold in the area. The 4 mile wide volcano is characterized by a Cretaceous quartz monzonite stock within a topographic depression, surrounded by surface andesite flows at least 2,300 feet thick, and radial quartz latite or rhyolite dikes. The stock generated the porphyry copper deposits, gold-bearing veins, and gold placers. There are about 26 major veins forming a radial pattern from the stock. The Golddust Camp placer deposits are found in the alluvium of the dry gulches radiating off Copper Flat and the andesite flows. The fissure veins produced 51,000 ounces of gold, while the placer deposits produced 110,000 ounces.

The Sternberg Mine at Copper Flat produced 200 tons of copper ore between 1911 and 1934. By 1959, Bear Creek Mining Company had discovered a mineralized breccia pipe within the stock. Quintana Minerals Corporation started open-pit mining in 1980, averaging 0.45 per cent copper. Ore minerals include pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite and galena.

==Climate==

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Hillsboro has a cold semi-arid climate, abbreviated &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps. The hottest temperature recorded in Hillsboro was on June 15–16, 1896, June 22, 1981, and June 26, 1994, while the coldest temperature recorded was on January 11, 1962.

==Education==
Truth or Consequences Municipal Schools is the school district for the entire county. Truth or Consequences Middle School and Hot Springs High School, both in Truth or Consequences, are the district&#x27;s secondary schools.

==Notable people==
* Physician and American Civil War veteran C.C. Crews
* Future justice of the New Mexico Supreme Court Frank W. Parker. He presided over the 1899 murder trial of Albert J. Fountain.

<text>Fiesole () is a town and &quot;comune&quot; of the Metropolitan City of Florence in the Italian region of Tuscany, on a scenic height above Florence, 5 km (3 miles) northeast of that city. It has structures dating to Etruscan and Roman times.

Founded in the seventh century BC as Vipsul, the city became one of the most important and earliest urban centres of the Etruscan civilisation. Since the fourteenth century, the city has always been considered a getaway for members of the upper class of Florence and, up to this day, Fiesole remains noted for its very expensive residential properties, just as well as its centuries-old villas and their formal gardens. The city is generally considered to be the wealthiest and most affluent suburb of Florence. In 2016, the city had the highest median family income in the whole of Tuscany.

Fiesole is a centre of higher education. The campus of the European University Institute is situated in the suburb and uses several historical buildings including the Badia Faesolina and the Villa Schifanoia. Additionally, the American universities, Harvard, Georgetown, and Saint Mary&#x27;s of Minnesota all maintain campuses at Fiesole.

== History ==

Fiesole (Latin Faesulae from the Etruscan Viesul, Viśl, Vipsul) was probably founded sometime during the ninth century BC, as it was an important member of the Etruscan confederacy. The remains of its prehistoric walls and ancient structures have been preserved and an archaeological museum in the town presents artifacts from and information about these cultural periods.

The earliest known recorded mention of the town dates to 283 BC, when the Etruscan town, then known as Faesulae, was conquered by the Romans. In Roman antiquity, it was the seat of a famous school of augurs and, every year, twelve young men were sent there from Rome to study the art of divination. 

The old town was either destroyed in the Social War or alternatively by Sulla in 80 BC, in reprisal for supporting the populares faction in Rome. Sulla later colonized it with veterans. This colony who afterward, under the leadership of Gaius Mallius, supported the cause of Catilina.
The Roman theatre, below the cathedral to the northeast, has 19 tiers of stone seats and is in diameter. It has been restored partially enough to provide a good idea of its structure. Above it is an embanking wall of irregular masonry, and below it some remains of Roman baths, including five parallel vaults of concrete. More than 1,000 silver denarii, all coined before 63 BC, were found at Faesulae in 1829. A small museum contains the objects found in the excavations of the theatre.

Fiesole was the scene of Stilicho&#x27;s great victory over the Germanic hordes of the Vandals and Suebi under Radagaisus in 406. During the Gothic War (536–553), the town was besieged several times. In 539, Justin, the Byzantine general, captured it and razed its fortifications.

It was an independent town for several centuries in the early Middle Ages, no less powerful than Florence in the valley below, and many wars arose between them. In 1010 and 1025, Fiesole was sacked by the Florentines. Later, it was conquered by Florence in 1125, when its leading families were obliged to take up their residence in Florence. Dante reflects this rivalry in his &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; by referring to &quot;the beasts of Fiesole&quot; (Inferno XV.73).

By the fourteenth century, rich Florentines had countryside villas in Fiesole, and one of them is the setting of the frame narrative of the Decameron. Boccaccio&#x27;s poem &quot;Il Ninfale fiesolano&quot; is a mythological account of the origins of the community.

It is also documented that the artist and scientist Leonardo da Vinci experimented for the first time with early flying models on the hills of Fiesole.

<text>Meridiana Fly S.p.A., operating as Meridiana (formerly named &quot;Meridiana S.p.A.&quot;), was a privately owned Italian airline headquartered in Olbia with its main base at Olbia Costa Smeralda Airport. It operated scheduled and charter flights to domestic, European and intercontinental destinations from several Italian bases. Some of its operations were carried out by the old Air Italy under the Meridiana brand. It was owned by Qatar Airways through AQA Holding (49%) and Alisarda S.p.A. (51%), who rebranded the airline as the new Air Italy effective 1 March 2018.

==History==
===Early years===
The company was set up with the name of Alisarda on 29 March 1963 by Aga Khan Prince Karīm al-Hussaynī with the aim of promoting tourism in Sardinia. Scheduled flights commenced in 1964.

On 3 May 1991 in an Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting, the name of the company was changed to Meridiana S.p.A., and a new logo was created. These changes were made to reflect the expansion of the company&#x27;s operations to Europe.

===Merger with Eurofly to create Meridiana fly===

In December 2006, Meridiana acquired the majority package of the airline company Eurofly, with a 29,95% share. During the year, further important investments were made aiming to develop Meridiana, which also closed 2006 with the historical record of 4,6 million passengers carried with an approximate 15% increase compared to 2005.

At the end of February 2010, Meridiana fly, the second-largest carrier in Italy, was created by the merger of Eurofly, a company specialized in long-haul charter flights to holiday destinations, and Meridiana, a scheduled operator of national and European flights, with the primary objective of connecting the main Italian airports with Sardinia and Sicily.

=== Meridiana&#x27;s acquisition of Air Italy ===
In October 2011, Meridiana fly completely acquired Air Italy, an Italian charter airline.

On 16 January 2013, the Board of Directors of Meridiana S.p.A. acknowledged the agreement for the purchase by Meridiana S.p.A. of all the Meridiana fly ordinary shares held by the former shareholders of Air Italy Holding S.r.l. Today the group is run by Meridiana S.p.A. Holding, which controls 89% of Meridiana fly including 100% of Air Italy; the remaining part is quoted to the Milan Stock Exchange but a tender offer was recently launched to delist the company.

===Redevelopment into the new Meridiana===

In April 2013, when the Air Italy merger was completed, Meridiana Fly returned to its former, shorter name, &quot;Meridiana&quot;.

On 16 May, it launched the new frequent-flyer program Meridiana Club in partnership with Avios.

In mid-2013, Meridiana offered national and international scheduled flights from the main Italian airports to Sardinia (Olbia, Alghero, and Cagliari), Sicily and Naples as well as holiday destinations such as the Canary Islands, Greece, and the Red Sea. It also serviced the long-haul destinations of the Maldives, Mauritius, Kenya, Zanzibar, Santo Domingo, and Brazil mainly from Milan Malpensa and/or Rome Fiumicino.

In 2014, the airline continued to reposition its brand by launching international flights to Moscow Domodedovo, London Gatwick, Kyiv, Tel Aviv and Nice from Naples and to Brussels, Geneva, London Gatwick, Tel Aviv, Nice, Hamburg, Paris CDG, Moscow Domodedovo and Kyiv from Olbia; reconfirming its leadership in Sardinia and its focus on Naples, Catania, Milan Linate and Verona airport for domestic Italian flights.

Since 18 November 2014 Meridiana Club frequent flyers have been able to earn Avios points on British Airways and from 23 March 2015 on Iberia.

In December 2014, Meridiana retired its last Airbus aircraft, two A320-200s, to pursue the aim of operating an all Boeing fleet together with Air Italy.

=== Meridiana ownership under AQA Holding ===
On 2 September 2017 it was announced that Qatar Airways had bought 49% of AQA Holding, the new shareholder of Meridiana. On 7 November 2017 it was announced that Qatar Airways would merge Air Italy with the current Meridiana subsidiary under the Meridiana AOC.

In December 2017, Meridiana announced a restructuring of its route network. While all routes from Milan-Linate except the services to its base in Olbia will be terminated, Meridiana will start year-round long-haul services from Milan-Malpensa to New York City and Miami using Airbus A330-200 aircraft inherited from Qatar Airways. Meridiana further announced that it would become the first Italian airline to take delivery of Boeing 737 MAX 8s. It was also reported that new full-flat business class seats and in-flight Wi-fi would be installed on the new Airbus A330s to be received from Qatar Airways.

In February 2018, Meridiana rebranded as Air Italy and announced a plan to expand its fleet and destinations to become Italy&#x27;s flagship carrier. Air Italy ceased operations in early 2020.

== Corporate affairs ==

=== Head Offices ===

Meridiana&#x27;s head offices are located at Olbia Costa Smeralda Airport in Olbia, Italy.

=== AQA Holding ===
AQA Holding is the parent company of Meridiana, which was founded on 2 September 2017 after Qatar Airways purchased a 49% stake in Meridiana, with Alisarda keeping the 51% stake that it previously owned, which subsequently created the new holding company.

=== Subsidiaries ===
Meridiana currently has three subsidiaries. One subsidiary Meridian owns is Meridiana Maintenance S.p.A. (operated as Meridiana Maintenance). The airline maintenance company was founded after Meridiana merged with eurofly (another Italian airline). Their hangar is located at Olbia Costa Smeralda Airport in Olbia, Italy next to the Meridiana Head Offices. Wokita S.i.r (operated as Wokita) is another subsidiary Meridiana owns. Wokita is a tour operator that offers a wide and extensive range of tourism products such as package tours, flights, hotels, and resorts in seaside areas, yachting, and activity holidays since 2006. Since April 2013 Meridiana owns Air Italy (2005–2018) and operates on behalf of Meridiana.

==Destinations==
===Codeshare agreements===
Meridiana codeshared with the following airlines:

*Air Malta
*Air Moldova
*Blue Air
*Blue Panorama Airlines
*British Airways
*Iberia
*S7 Airlines
==Fleet==

===Current fleet===
At the time of the merger, the Meridiana fleet consisted of the following aircraft:

===Fleet development===
In April 2017, it was announced that, due to Qatar Airways purchasing a stake in the airline, the airline is to complete a fleet modernization with 20 Boeing 737 MAX 8 to be delivered from the second quarter of 2018, taken from Qatar&#x27;s orders from Boeing. In October 2017, it was announced that the airline would replace its long-haul fleet with new aircraft transferred from Qatar Airways&#x27; new orders. It was announced that the airline would operate a mix of Boeing 787 and Airbus A330. The fleet development plan was later Transferred to Air Italy.

===Historical fleet===
Meridiana previously operated the following aircraft types:

<text>In a patent or patent application, the claims define in technical terms the extent, i.e. the scope, of the protection conferred by a patent, or the protection sought in a patent application. The claims particularly point out the subject matter which the inventor(s) regard as their invention. In other words, the purpose of the claims is to define which subject matter is protected by the patent (or sought to be protected by the patent application). This is termed as the &quot;notice function&quot; of a patent claim—to warn others of what they must not do if they are to avoid infringement liability. The claims are of paramount importance in both prosecution and litigation.

For instance, a claim could read:
* &quot;An apparatus for catching mice, said apparatus comprising a base, a spring member coupled to the base, and ...&quot;
* &quot;A chemical composition for cleaning windows, said composition substantially consisting of 10–15% ammonia, ...&quot;
* &quot;Method for computing future life expectancies, said method comprising gathering data including X, Y, Z, analyzing the data, comparing the analyzed data results...&quot;

== Background ==

In most jurisdictions, a patent is a right to exclude others from making, using, importing, selling or offering for sale the subject matter defined by the claims when the claim is for a thing (apparatus, composition of matter, system, etc.). If a claim is for a method, the right to exclude would be to exclude any single party from carrying out all the steps of the claim. In order to exclude someone from using a patented invention, the patent owner, or patentee, needs to demonstrate in a court proceeding that what the other person is using falls within the scope of a claim of the patent; therefore, it is more valuable to obtain claims that include the minimal set of limitations that differentiate an invention over what came before (&quot;i.e.,&quot; the so-called prior art). But the fewer the limitations in a claim, the more likely it is that the claim will cover, or &quot;read on&quot;, what came before and be rejected during examination or found to be invalid at a later time for obviousness or lack of novelty.

== History ==

Patents have not always contained claims. In many European countries, patents did not contain claims until the 1970s. Before that time, it was often difficult to decide whether a product infringed a patent, since the sole basis to know the extent of protection was the description, in view of the prior art.

Interestingly, American inventors started using claims in their patent applications decades before the authorities (either judicial or legislative) started to require claims in patents. The first person who used in a US patent application the term &quot;claim&quot; in its current meaning is believed to be Isaiah Jennings in 1807. Claims were recommended in published patents in the Third Patent Act (1836) and finally became mandatory in the Fourth Patent Act (1870).

However, even among patent legal systems in which the claims are used as the reference to decide the scope of protection conferred by a patent, the way the claims are used may vary substantially. Traditionally, two types of claiming systems exist:
* the &quot;central claiming system&quot;, according to which the claims identify the &quot;centre&quot; of the patented invention. The exact scope of the protection depends on the actual nature of the inventor&#x27;s contribution to the art in the concerned technology.
* the &quot;peripheral claiming system&quot;, according to which the claims identify the exact periphery, or boundary, of the conferred protection. In this system, the burden of drafting good claims is much higher on the patent applicant (or on his or her counsel). The applicant receives the protection he or she requested and almost nothing more, provided that the invention is new and non-obvious. This theoretically makes it easier for third parties to examine whether infringement may exist or not.

No patent system today is a purely either &quot;central&quot; or &quot;peripheral&quot;, but the system used in Germany and most of the other countries of continental Europe is considered more central than the system currently used in the United Kingdom, the United States, and especially Japan, which are more peripheral. In recent years, Japan&#x27;s system has become more peripheral, while the system used in the United States was becoming more central because of the increasing resort in US patent litigation to the doctrine of equivalents to expand claim scope unpredictably, until the US Supreme Court reversed that trend in the &quot;Warner-Jenkinson&quot; case in 1997.

== Requirements and structure ==
In most modern patent laws, patent applications must have at least one claim, which are critical defining elements of the patent and the primary subject of examination. In some patent laws however, a date of filing may be obtained for an application which does not contain any claim.

===European Patent Convention===

Under the European Patent Convention (EPC), a claim must define the matter for which the protection is sought in terms of technical features. The convention itself pertains to a procedure to secure a European patent. These technical features can be either structural (e.g. a nail, a rivet) or functional (e.g. fastening means).

Regarding the structure of a claim, under the EPC, what is called the &quot;preamble&quot; is different from the meaning the &quot;preamble&quot; has under U.S. patent law. In an independent claim in Europe, the preamble is everything which precedes the expression &quot;characterized in that&quot; or &quot;characterized by&quot; in a claim written according to the so-called &quot;two-part form&quot;, and therefore everything which is regarded as known in combination within one prior art document, namely the closest prior art document. For this reason, in Europe, the preamble of a claim is sometimes also called &quot;pre-characterizing portion&quot;.

===United States===
A claim may include the following parts:

* A preamble that recites the class of the invention, and optionally its primary properties, purpose, or field: &quot;An apparatus...&quot; &quot;A therapeutic method for treating cancer...&quot; &quot;A composition having an affinity for protein X...&quot; This preamble may also reference another claim and refine it, e.g., &quot;The method of claim 1...&quot; (See &quot;dependent claim&quot; below.).
* A &quot;transitional&quot; phrase that characterizes the elements that follow. The phrases &quot;comprising&quot;, &quot;containing&quot; and &quot;including&quot; are most often used and (under some patent laws, specifically US) preferable, as it means &quot;having at least the following elements...&quot; and are therefore open (inclusive) and do not exclude additional limitations. The phrases &quot;consisting of&quot; and &quot;consisting essentially of&quot; are (under some patent laws, specifically US) more limiting, as they mean &quot;having all and only&quot; or &quot;virtually only&quot; and are therefore closed (exclusive). In the US, the phrase &quot;consisting of&quot; excludes additional limitations, while the phrase &quot;consisting essentially of&quot; excludes additional limitations that would &quot;materially affect the basic and novel characteristic(s) of the claimed invention&quot;.
* A set of &quot;limitations&quot; that together describe the invention: &quot;an X, a Y, and a Z connected to the X and the Y.&quot; The elements should be described as though they interact or cooperate to achieve the desired result. 
* Optionally, a purpose clause that further describes the overall operation of the invention, or the goal that the invention achieves (&quot;wherein the Z simultaneously controls the X and Y,&quot; or &quot;wherein the Z accomplishes purpose W by controlling X and Y,&quot; etc.). &quot;Wherein&quot; clauses limit the scope of the claim. Other forms of purpose language are &quot;whereby&quot; and &quot;thereby&quot; clauses, similar to the &quot;wherein&quot; clauses just described, and statements of intended use in a claim preamble (depending on facts of case, preamble may or may not limit claim scope; in this case it was the &quot;essence of the invention&quot;).

== Basic types and categories ==

There are two basic types of claims:
* the independent claims, which stand on their own, and
* the dependent claims, which depend on a single claim or on several claims and generally express particular embodiments as fall-back positions.

The expressions &quot;in one embodiment&quot;, &quot;in a preferred embodiment&quot;, &quot;in a particular embodiment&quot;, &quot;in an advantageous embodiment&quot; or the like often appear in the description of patent applications and are used to introduce a particular implementation or method of carrying out the invention. These various embodiments may or may not each be claimed with specificity. They might serve as multiple examples of a more general &quot;genus&quot; that is claimed. In some cases the examiner might declare that what the applicant presented as variations of one invention are actually separate inventions that need to be examined individually.

An independent (&quot;stand alone&quot;) claim does not refer to an earlier claim, whereas a dependent claim does refer to an earlier claim, assumes all of the limitations of that claim and then adds restrictions (e.g. &quot;The handle of claim 2, wherein it is hinged.&quot;) Each dependent claim is, by law, narrower than the independent claim upon which it depends. Although this results in coverage narrower than provided by the independent claim upon which the second claim depends, it is additional coverage, and there are many advantages to the patent applicant in submitting and obtaining a full suite of dependent claims:

:* Clarification/broadening of the independent claim: Independent claims are typically written with broad terms, to avoid permitting competitors to circumvent the claim by altering some aspect of the basic design. But when a broad wording is used, it may raise a question as to the scope of the term itself. If a dependent claim is specifically drawn to a narrower interpretation, then, at least in the U.S., the doctrine of claim differentiation states that the scope of the independent claim is strongly presumed be different from, and therefore broader than, the scope of the dependent claim. The doctrine dictates that it &quot;is improper for courts to read into an independent claim a limitation explicitly set forth in another claim.&quot; This means that if an independent claim recites a chair with a plurality of legs, and a dependent claim depending from the independent recites a chair with four legs, the independent claim is not limited to what is recited in the dependent claim. The dependent claim protects chairs with four legs, and the independent claim protects chairs with four legs as well as chairs having two, three, five or more legs. Similarly, it may be unclear whether a &quot;base&quot; includes a &quot;set of legs.&quot; A dependent claim, including the phrase, &quot;wherein said base comprises a set of legs,&quot; if allowed by the patent examiner, clarifies that the word &quot;base&quot; in the independent claim does not necessarily include legs. In practice, dependent claims are often used to home in on the inventor&#x27;s preferred embodiment of the invention (e.g., the actual product design that the inventor intends to use.) The independent claim broadly describes the invention; dependent claim #1 describes the invention in a narrower aspect that more specifically describes the preferred embodiment; dependent claim #2 is narrower still; etc.

:* Possible invalidity of independent claim: It is impossible to know, when beginning the application process and even at the time of patent issuance, if a patent claim is valid. This is because any publication dated before the application&#x27;s priority date and published anywhere in any language can invalidate the claim (excluding publications by the inventor published during the grace period in certain countries such as U.S., Canada and Japan). Furthermore, even applications that were not yet published at the time of filing, but have a priority date prior to the priority date of the application, can also invalidate the claim. As it is impossible to gain an absolute and complete knowledge of every publication on earth, not to mention unpublished patent applications, there is always some degree of uncertainty. If the independent claim is determined to be invalid, however, a dependent claim may nevertheless survive, and may still be broad enough to bar competitors from valuable commercial territory.

Under the European Patent Convention, when a claim in one particular category (see below), e.g. a process claim, depends on a claim from a different category, e.g. a product claim, it is not considered to be a dependent claim but an independent claim. Under U.S. law, this is still counted as a dependent claim, regardless of the class change.

The rules of claim drafting also permit &quot;multiple dependent claims&quot; that reference more than one other claim, e.g.: &quot;3. Method of claim 1 or 2, further comprising...&quot; The rules for this are quite specific: specific claims must be referenced (&quot;the method of any of these other claims&quot; is incorrect); the claims must be referenced in the alternative (&quot;the method of claims 1 and 2&quot; is incorrect); etc. While still acceptable, this claim style is seldom used in the U.S. because it is counted for filing fee purposes according to the number of claims that it references. Thus, if the claim depends from three former claims, it is counted for fee purposes as three dependent claims. In light of the &quot;excess claim&quot; fees currently imposed by the USPTO, this tactic can quickly become expensive. Multiple dependent claims are, however, very commonly used in other jurisdictions, including Europe.

Claims can also be classified in categories, i.e. in terms of what they &quot;claim&quot;. A claim can refer to
* a physical entity, i.e. a product (or material) or an apparatus (or device, system, article, ...). The claim is then called respectively &quot;product claim&quot; or &quot;apparatus claim&quot;; or
* an activity, i.e. a process (or method) or a use. The claim is then called respectively &quot;process claim&quot; (or method claim) or &quot;use claim&quot;.
In the United States, these categories are referred to as the four statutory categories of invention, and they are: processes, machines, manufactures, and compositions of matter. Notably, printed matter (including data stored on a computer drive) and signals (such as transient electromagnetic waves, (see in Re Nujten).) do not belong to any of the four statutory categories and are not patentable in US. However, such signals are considered patentable by the European Patent Office (EPO).

The &quot;process&quot; claims have been the most controversial, particularly in cases, when processes involve transformations of non-statutory (and/or non-physical) entities, such as data into data, or electronic money exchange. Three US Supreme Court justices (Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer) in their concurring opinion in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International suggested, that all business methods should be excluded from patentability: &quot;[A]ny claim that merely describes a method of doing business does not qualify as a process under § 101.&quot; However, the SCOTUS refused to accept this position so far, and some business method patent claims are possible in the US, although the case law in the area is still evolving (see Software patents under United States patent law).

=== Special types of claims ===

In addition to aforementioned four statutory categories of claims, there are also many other &quot;flavours&quot; of claims, which are used in different circumstances. Sometimes a particular claim form is required by law if a patent is to be granted for a particular invention, such as for a second medical use of a known substance where the &quot;Swiss-type&quot; claim might be required. Another reason to use a particular claim might be to catch a particular class of infringer.

== Interpretation or claim construction ==

The claims often use precise language. Certain words commonly used in claims have specific legal meanings determined by one or more court decisions. These meanings may be different from common usage. For instance, the word &quot;comprises&quot;, when used in the claims of a United States patent, means &quot;consists at least of&quot;. By contrast, the word &quot;consists&quot; means &quot;consists only of&quot;, which will lead to a very different scope of protection.

In U.S. patent practice at least, inventors may &quot;act as their own lexicographer&quot; in a patent application. That means that an inventor may give a common word or phrase a meaning that is very specific and different from the normal definition of said word or phrase. Thus a claim must be interpreted in light of the definitions provided in the specification of a patent. The specification of a patent is a written description of how to make and use the invention (see also: sufficiency of disclosure). 

Traditionally the USPTO used for claims interpretation during patent examination a &quot;broadest reasonable interpretation consistent with specification&quot; standard, while the US courts in suits for patent infringement, during a Markman hearing, a claim is interpreted using a narrower standard. This duality (broader during examination, narrower during litigation) is used to prevent patentees from enforcing in courts broader claims than were examined by the USPTO. However, on November 13, 2018 the USPTO switched to the claim construction standard established by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303 (Fed. Cir. 2005)

<doc id="848171" wikidata="Q5164595" url="?curid=848171" title="Consultation on Church Union">
<text>The Consultation on Church Union (COCU) was an effort towards church unity in the United States, that began in 1962 and in 2002 became the Churches Uniting in Christ. It was a significant part of the Christian movement towards ecumenism. This effort can be seen in the context of the worldwide ecumenical attitude that was manifested in the 1948 formation of the World Council of Churches, the 1950 formation of the National Council of Churches, the 1957 formation of the United Church of Christ, and the formation of the Roman Catholic Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity during the Second Vatican Council (which occurred from 1962 to 1965). The original task of COCU was to negotiate a consensus between its member denominations (originally the Protestant Episcopal Church, the Methodist Church, the United Church of Christ, and the UPCUSA).

==Origin==
On December 4, 1960, Eugene Carson Blake, the stated clerk of the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A., on the invitation of Episcopal Bishop James Pike, delivered a sermon at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, in which he proposed the creation of a Protestant &quot;superchurch&quot;. In response, the UPCUSA&#x27;s General Assembly, approved an overture at its General Assembly meeting to work together with the Protestant Episcopal Church in order to invite the Methodist Church and the United Church of Christ to explore the concept of union. The Episcopal church accepted the invitation. Representatives from the four churches met in Washington, D.C. in 1961 and proposed a first official meeting of the churches for the following year at the College of Preachers and Wesley Theological Seminary. It was at that 1962 meeting that the group, which had come to include the Presbyterian Church in the United States, the mainline &quot;Southern Presbyterians&quot;, first called itself the &quot;Consultation on Church Union&quot;. The first churches to be invited to join COCU beyond the first four were the International Convention of Christian Churches (Disciples), the Polish National Catholic Church, and the Evangelical United Brethren Church, which later merged with the Methodist Church to form the United Methodist Church. All North American churches were invited to send observers. At the next meeting, in 1963, the Disciples of Christ joined, and it was decided to stop sending individual invitations and instead simply accept applications. 16 other churches attended the 1963 meeting as observers.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that a meeting in Dallas in May 1966 produced a timetable for merger that called for &quot;creation and ratification of a union plan within 13 years, followed by some 30 years of federation during which a constitution will be prepared.&quot; Among delegates from the eight churches then involved were Methodist theologian Albert Outler, Episcopal bishop Robert Gibson of Virginia, and United Church of Christ minister David Colwell. By 1967, ten churches (including two pairs, Presbyterian and Methodist, which later merged) were members of the consultation:

* African Methodist Episcopal Church
* African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church
* Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)
* Christian Methodist Episcopal Church
* Episcopal Church
* Evangelical United Brethren Church
* Methodist Church
* Presbyterian Church in the U.S.
* United Church of Christ
* United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.

===Churches of Christ Uniting===
Churches of Christ Uniting was a proposed name for a body growing out of the Consultation on Church Union which began in 1962 among ten predominantly &quot;mainline&quot; U.S. Protestant denominations. The consolidation proposed in the original scheme was overwhelmingly rejected when put to a vote of the constituent denominations in 1969, so the leaders, unwilling to abandon totally this effort, adopted more of a &quot;go slow&quot; approach. Groups within the Consultation began closer contacts, and in some instances full communion, with each other, and the idea to call the group that was hoped to be formed in the long term &quot;Church of Christ United&quot; was proposed, with the interim name while the process was ongoing to be &quot;Church of Christ Uniting&quot;. (These names had the additional advantage of having the same initials as the initial Consultation on the Church Union.)

Opposition within the component denominations, particularly the United Presbyterian Church, caused any plan for a full merger to be put on hold, and a new name, seemingly implying that &quot;uniting&quot; is a presently-ongoing but perhaps long-term goal, was adopted, Churches Uniting in Christ. (This name also had the advantage of not sounding as much like one of the existing constituent groups, the United Church of Christ, nor like an entirely unrelated one, the Church of Christ.)

==The 1970 Plan of Union==
Despite intense negotiations, membership of the denominations overwhelmingly rejected the &quot;Plan of Union&quot; when it was proposed in 1970. Much agreement was reached on the first six and a half chapters of the proposal (&quot;From Unity to Union&quot;, &quot;What it Means to be God&#x27;s People&quot;, &quot;To Be Members in This Community&quot;, &quot;The Living Faith&quot;, &quot;This People at Worship&quot;, and the first half of &quot;To Be Ministers of Christ&quot;), but when specifics of ministry came up, there was significant disagreement.

In 1972 after the devastation caused by Hurricane Agnes in the Wilkes-Barre/Kingston, Pennsylvania, area, the Methodist Church and Presbyterian Church, one block apart in Kingston, considered the wisdom of spending so much money to reconstitute two expensive buildings. Quickly the discussion moved from &quot;Should we merge?&quot; to a discussion of &quot;Is there any reason we should NOT merge?&quot; The pastors talked with denominational leaders and worked on a plan after chatting extensively with COCU in Princeton, NJ, and receiving excellent direction for their idea. In October 1973, the new entity came into existence: The Church of Christ Uniting in Kingston, PA. More information can be obtained from The Church of Christ Uniting, Market Street, Kingston, PA, 18704.

==Intercommunion==
A key phrase associated with COCU was “catholic and reformed” (later, “catholic, evangelical, and reformed”). With the failure of the Plan of Union that had become clear by 1972, COCU turned in 1973 to negotiating &quot;intercommunion&quot;, whereby each member church would retain its own autonomy and identity, while recognizing the validity of the rites, membership, and ministry of the others and accepting them as true churches. This proposal, submitted to the churches in 1979, was titled &quot;The COCU Consensus: In Quest of a Church of Christ Uniting&quot;. It was one part of a three part proposal; the other two parts were first published as &quot;Covenanting Toward Community: From Consensus to Communion&quot; and later republished with revisions in 1989 as &quot;Churches in Covenant Communion&quot;.

==Episcopal structure==
The proposal contained in &quot;Churches in Covenant Communion&quot; was to be done on the historic episcopal model of bishop, presbyter and deacon. The document was approved by seven churches: the ICC (1989), the CME church (1994), the Disciples of Christ (1995), the AME church, AMEZ church, UCC, and UMC (1996). However, the Presbyterian Church USA was unwilling to implement some of the changes to its internal rules that this model would require and had concerns over the role of elders (presbyters), and the Episcopal Church did not feel able to participate at the time, having concerns about the role of bishops (episcopacy). It was then proposed that intercommunion be established without a resolution of the ministry issue. It was stated that &quot;full reconciliation of ministries, as well as resolution of any remaining challenges, is a goal we seek to accomplish and proclaim by the time of the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity 2007.&quot;

==Dissolution==
After forty years of talks, COCU voted (in 1999) to dissolve in 2002 and to reconstitute itself as Churches Uniting in Christ (CUIC).

==Documents==

<text>Mohammedia (), known until 1960 as Fedala (), is a port city on the west coast of Morocco between Casablanca and Rabat in the region of Casablanca-Settat. It hosts the most important oil refinery of Morocco, Samir Refinery, which makes it the center of the Moroccan petroleum industry. It has a population of 208,612 according to the 2014 Moroccan census.

==History==
=== Early history ===

The harbor, which is now Mohammedia, was originally named Fedala (). The name comes from the Arabic words &quot;Fadl Allah&quot; () which means &quot;favor of God&quot;. According to Graberg de Hemsö, it comes from &quot;Fayḍ Allāh&quot;, meaning &quot;bounty of God&quot;. Traces still exist of its business role under the Almoravid dynasty. It was frequented in the 14th and 15th centuries by merchant ships from Europe seeking cereals and dried fruits.

In 1773, the Sultan Sidi Mohammed ben Abdallah made of Fédala a grains warehouse of Tamasna province and built the Kasbah to protect the shops for traders. He built the white mosque Al Atik as well.

===French Protectorate===

During the precolonial period, competition between the Western powers to ensure the economical exploitation of Africa was behind the merger of Europeans interests in the ports of Morocco. In the region of Fédala, the German family Mannesmann acquired a large area of land.

The Treaty of November 4, 1911 between France and Germany on the partition of Africa forced the Mannesmann family to abandon the lands they held for Georges and Jacques Hersent, two French industrialists, who noticed the existence of a natural bay, valuable for the creation of a large port at low cost.

The group Hersent created the Franco-Moroccan company in 1912 and founded the port company in 1914 that took a leading part in the development of Fédala. The rapid growth of the city started around the port, which allowed the development of various industries such as canning fishery products, agro-industry plants, tannery, textile, etc..

The seaside town took shape in 1925 and the Esplanade was built in 1938. The construction of the sea line in 1951 made of Fédala the first and most modern oil port in North Africa.

The church of Saint James (Saint Jacques), which overlooks the main square, was erected in 1934 by Jean and Georges Hersent, in memory of their son and nephew Jacques (3 February 1893 - 26 July 1917), who died at the Marne during the First World War.

====Battle of Fedala====
US Army invaded Fédala from the Atlantic on November 8, 1942, as part of operation Torch. The invasion was carried out by the Center Attack Group of the Western Task Force which landed on the Atlantic coast of Morocco. The landing began at 4 AM.

===New city===
Fédala was renamed Mohammedia on 25 June 1960 in honor of King Mohammed V, the restorer of Moroccan independence, on the occasion of laying the foundation stone of the Samir oil refinery. The new name indicates the modern character of this city. Today, the city serves as both a seaside resort and a manufacturing center.

Mohammedia is also a resort city containing a golf and tennis club, casino and many other recreational activities. In addition, people call it which means &quot;city of flowers and sports&quot;.

Within the past decade, Mohammedia&#x27;s beaches &quot;Sablet &amp; Mimosa&quot; have drawn many people from Casablanca, and its nearby cities. Sablet and Mimosa have been under development, building new beach condos, villas, as well as more investments in small businesses which creates more jobs. Summer is simply the best season in Mohammedia being that there is more involvement due to an increase of the population. There is a wide range of outdoor activities including basketball, soccer, surfing, and fishing. The night life is a great experience to be part of, including several cafes, restaurants, clubs, and a boardwalk. A couple of beach residential areas that are good places for vacation are &quot;Residence of Oubaha&quot; and &quot;Palm Beach.&quot; There are several other projects going on in the city of Mohammedia as well as infrastructure throughout the city.

On 22 December 2022, a huge explosion erupted after a gas storage facility went up in flames. Authorities claimed to have no casualties. Families and citizens living near the facility have evacuated the surroundings. After 2 hours of the incident, local authorities contained the fires caused by the explosion.

==Geography==

=== Location ===
Mohammedia lies along the Atlantic Ocean Northeast of Casablanca. It is located between the outlets of the Rivers Oued El-Maleh and Oued Nfifikh and is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the North, Ben Slimane Province to the East and South, and the prefecture of Sidi Bernoussi-Zenata to the West.

===Climate===
Mohammedia has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa). The moderating effect of the Atlantic Ocean influences strongly on the city climate and makes its winter soft and warm, and its summer hot and cool. Mohammedia enjoys plenty of sunshine throughout the year with measurable precipitation annually.

The period of November through April is mild and rainy with average high temperatures of and lows of , however temperatures can occasionally drop to around in the morning, or be as high as for a few days during winter.

The period of May through October is warm to hot and dry with average high temperatures of and lows of , but temperatures can exceed and occasionally reach .

Most rainfall occurs from November to April, and the average annual precipitation is around 432 mm. Precipitation is most commonly in the form of light rain showers, but sometimes there is heavy rainfall and thunderstorms.

==Subdivisions==
The province is divided administratively into the following:

==Demographics==
The population of Mohammedia is growing at a fast rate. The city, which had a population of only 500 people in 1914, is currently home to about 204,000 people. The population of the prefecture of Mohammedia is estimated at 336,000 inhabitants with an average population density of .
All population groups of the Moroccan Kingdom are represented in this region. The first inhabitants of the city were the Zenata tribes, of which only few remain, divided territorially between Mohammedia and neighboring prefectures. Another Arab tribe of Mauritania, called Mjedba, settled between Fédala and Mediouna three centuries ago and are now twice as many as Zenata.

==Education==

The city has a French international school, Groupe Scolaire Claude Monet, serving &quot;moyenne section&quot; through &quot;collège&quot; (junior high school).

==Municipality==
Mohammedia, whose size has increased significantly during the second half of the 20th century, is becoming one of the biggest cities in Morocco. New neighborhoods are built in all the parts of the city and more people live in town.

The city is divided into 2 major distinct areas, the Kasbah area, the Al-Alia district.

===Kasbah area===

This area where stands the Kasbah extends from Souss Street to the Al-Wafaa subdivision. It represents the historical heart of the city and has marked a transitional compromise between an urbanism of modern buildings and monuments, and the forms of ancient old Medina. Many commercials and services exist along the narrow streets of the Kasbah and the boulevards of the surrounding area, such as clothing merchants, wool merchants and fruit sellers. This area, which represents the city center, hosts many administrations, mosques, restaurants, hotels and parks as well.
* Subdivisions: The Kasbah, Al-Wafaa, Al-Marsa, Dyour Al-Qraii.
* Famous places: Twin Towns Park, Mohamed V boulevard, the Corniche.
* Infrastructures and mobility : The railway station, Moulay Abdellah Hospital, the Prefecture, Bachir Stadium.

===Al-Alia===

This district is located southern in the city on a gentle hill slope, which gives it the name Al-Alia that means the upper side. It was built in 1948 as a solution to the shantytowns problem, where rural population were living, attracted by the industrial development of the city and looking for a job.

Today, the district equals a small city in continuous expansion, equipped by all necessary facilities.
* Ancient subdivisions: El Hassania, Derb Marrakech, Diour Doukkala, Derb Jamila, Derb Ourida, Derb Fath, Derb Douchmane, Riyad Salam, Derb Laâyoune, Hay Al-Houria.
* New subdivisions : Hay El-Falah, Anfa, Rachidia, Hay Reda, Hay Nasr, Hay el-Fajr, La Colline, Hay Al-Wahda.
* Infrastructures and mobility: The Municipal Theater, the Coach Station.

==Economics and transport==
===Port===
The port of Mohammedia specialises in liquid bulk and petro-chemicals. Mohammedia imports crude oil and it gets refined upon arrival. The port exports fish, chlorine, and sodium carbonate from large factories within the city.

<text>The Cessna 150 is a two-seat tricycle gear general aviation airplane that was designed for flight training, touring and personal use. In 1977, it was succeeded in production by the Cessna 152, a minor modification to the original design.

The Cessna 150 is the fifth most produced aircraft ever, with 23,839 produced. The Cessna 150 was offered for sale in named configurations that included the Standard basic model, the Trainer with dual controls, and the deluxe Commuter, along with special options for these known as Patroller options. Later, these configurations were joined by the top-end Commuter II and the aerobatic Aerobat models.

In 2007, Cessna announced a successor to the Model 150 and 152, the Model 162 Skycatcher.

==Development==
In the mid-1950s, Cessna Aircraft Company began development of a successor to the popular Cessna 140 which finished production in 1951. The resulting 142 was based on the 140, but had tricycle landing gear, which gives the aircraft more docile ground handling than the tailwheel landing gear of the 140; Cessna also replaced the rounded tips of the wings and empennage with more modern-looking, squared-off tips, and the narrow, hinged wing flaps of the 140 were replaced by larger, far more effective Fowler flaps.

The Cessna 142 prototype first flew on September 12, 1957, shortly before the aircraft was renamed to Model 150 in October. Production commenced in September 1958 at Cessna&#x27;s Wichita, Kansas, plant. 1,764 aircraft were also produced by Reims Aviation under license in France. These French manufactured 150s were designated Reims F150 or Reims-Cessna F150, the &quot;F&quot; indicating they were built in France.

American-made 150s were all produced with the Continental O-200-A engine of . Most Reims-built aircraft are powered by a Continental O-200-A built under license by Rolls-Royce, but some have the Rolls-Royce-built version of the Continental O-240-A.

All models from 1966 onwards have larger doors and increased baggage space. With the 1967 Model 150G, the doors were bowed outwards on each side to provide more cabin elbow room.

The 150 was succeeded in the summer of 1977 by the closely related Cessna 152. The 152 is more economical to operate due to the increased TBO (time between overhaul) of the Lycoming O-235 engine. The 152 had its flap travel limited to 30 degrees, from the 150&#x27;s 40 degree flap deflection, for better climb with full flaps and the maximum certified gross weight was increased from 1,600 lb (726 kg) on the 150 to 1670 lb (757 kg) on the 152. Production of the 152 ended in 1985 when manufacturing of all Cessna piston singles was suspended.

==Production==
A total of 22,138 Cessna 150s were built in the United States, including 21,404 Commuters and 734 Aerobats. Reims Aviation completed 1,764 F150s, of which 1,428 were Commuters and 336 were Aerobats. A Reims affiliate in Argentina also assembled 47 F150s, including 38 Commuters and 9 Aerobats.

Of all the Cessna 150/152 models, the 1966 model year was the most plentiful with 3,067 1966 Cessna 150s produced. This was the first year the aircraft featured a swept tail fin, increased baggage area and electrically operated flaps.

==Variants==
&quot;Cessna has historically used model years like the U.S. automobile industry, with new models typically being introduced a few months prior to the actual calendar year.&quot;
:The sole Model 142 prototype, registered N34258 (c/n 617), was built in 1957 as a tricycle landing gear development of the Cessna 140. Other changes included the addition of &quot;Para-Lift&quot; flaps and squared wingtips and tail surfaces. The aircraft was powered by a Continental O-200-A engine, was of an all-metal construction, and had a gross weight of . First flown on September 12, 1957, the aircraft was subsequently redesignated to Model 150.
;
:Introduced for the 1959 model year, the production 150 was largely identical to the 142/150 prototype. The 1959 150 was offered in three configurations; the Standard, the most basic level with the fewest features; the upgraded Trainer, with dual flight controls, a more complete set of flight instruments for instrument flight rules operation, a radio, a landing light, and a few other features; and the top-of-the-line Inter-City Commuter (often called simply the Commuter), which added an engine vacuum pump, vacuum-driven heading and attitude indicators, and a revolving anti-collision beacon mounted on the vertical fin, along with all of the Trainer&#x27;s features except for the dual flight controls.
:For the 1960 model year, the generator in the Commuter was upgraded to 35 amperes. All 150s for 1959 had included a 20-ampere generator, and this was retained in the Standard and Trainer for 1960; the 35-ampere generator was offered as an option for these configurations. Also for 1960, the Patroller configuration was introduced for patrol-type work. These could be added, either together or selectively, to any 150 configuration, and included a &quot;Patroller&quot; wing with long-range fuel tanks that held a total of , instead of the standard in the normal wing; Patroller doors, with extra acrylic glass windows in the lower half for better visibility; and a message drop tube, for dropping messages and other small items through the cabin floor to the ground.
:A total of 1017 were built, not including the 1957 prototype; 683 in 1959 and 334 in 1960.
;
:1961 model year with 15% larger rear side windows, which offered slightly better rear visibility. The landing gear was also redesigned, shifting the main wheels aft by , but not changing the gear leg mountings. This shift of the main wheels made the aircraft less likely to tip back onto its tail during loading, and it also made the nose wheel bear more weight, which increased its steering effectiveness. Other new features in the 150A included an instrument panel with a completely redesigned layout; flush inside door handles and nearly flush window latches, which made the 150&#x27;s narrow cabin a bit less cramped, and optional individually adjustable seats. 332 built.
;
:1962 model year with a new McCauley 1A100/MCM6950 propeller replacing the Sensenich M69CK-52 of previous versions. The new propeller had the same diameter of , but its blade pitch was reduced, which increased the maximum cruise speed by about and slightly improved the climb rate and service ceiling. The original metal wingtips were replaced by more smoothly contoured fiberglass ones with a different shape, increasing the wingspan by about . The optional two-passenger child seat for the baggage compartment, available from the first 150, was completely redesigned for the 150B. A new option was a simple autopilot, specifically for the Commuter version, called &quot;Nav-O-Matic&quot;, a single-axis heading-hold type. Also newly offered for the 150B were optional &quot;courtesy lights&quot; in the underside of the wings to light the area around the doors when on the ground. The Patroller message drop tube option, on the other hand, was eliminated. 350 built.
:1963 model year with a quick drain added to the fuel strainer, optional larger 6.00×6 inch (150×150 mm) main wheels and tires to replace the standard 5.00×5 inch (125×125 mm) size, and an optional child seat. The optional landing gear &quot;speed fairings&quot; were also changed to a sharp-nosed design compatible with those used for other single-engine Cessna models. 387 built.
;
:1964 model year with a cut down rear fuselage and a wraparound &quot;Omni-Vision&quot; rear window, following the pattern already set by other Cessna models. The new rear window improved rearward visibility, and many people found the new cabin more &quot;airy&quot; and pleasant, due to the increased light. Useful load was increased by , and the gross weight of the aircraft was correspondingly increased to , where it would stay for all later 150 models.
:Because of the higher gross weight with the same engine power, Cessna&#x27;s claimed performance figures for the 150D and later models are worse than for earlier models: maximum and cruise speeds are reduced, range is shortened, takeoff and landing distances are lengthened, and climb rate and service ceiling are lower. Such changes are only to be expected, because performance is weight-dependent and is normally specified at maximum gross weight. Cruise performance may also have been lessened because the new rear window made the 150D&#x27;s rear fuselage less well streamlined than the former &quot;fastback&quot; fuselage.
:The 150D retained the straight tailfin and rudder of previous years. However, to lighten control loads, aerodynamic balance horns were added to the rudder and the elevator. These horns also contained weights (mass balances) to eliminate any possible control flutter that might be induced by the changed aerodynamics of the rear fuselage.
:The 150D moved the heavy electrical battery from the previous rear location, behind the baggage compartment, to the front, just ahead of the engine firewall. It had a broader range for its center of gravity than earlier models, which allowed more flexibility in loading. The 150D also had more permissive airspeed limits for its never-exceed speed, its maneuvering speed, and particularly its maximum flaps-extended speed, which was raised from to .
:Partway through the 150D&#x27;s production, an option was added for a heavy-duty nose landing gear with a larger 6.00×6 inch (150×150 mm) nosewheel; this had a tire whose tread was wider than standard but was only slightly larger in diameter. The folding torque links on this heavy-duty nose gear were also reversed, being mounted in front of the nosewheel strut instead of behind it.
:A total of 686 aircraft were built; one prototype (c/n 644) and 685 production aircraft.
:1965 model year with only minor changes, like the addition of an optional rear-view mirror. 760 built, plus one prototype converted from the 150D prototype (c/n 644).
;
:1966 model year with a new vertical tail that was swept back 35 degrees, with a short dorsal strake at its base, matching the styling of the Cessna 172 and other models. The cabin doors were widened, with 23% more area, and while the old doors were tapered at the bottom, the new doors were square, making it easier to get in and out of the cabin. The new doors also had larger windows and better latches. The baggage compartment was extended aft to the bottom of the rear window, giving 50% more room, although its load limit remained at . The cabin floor was now flat, with no hump for routing control cables. The old manual flaps were replaced by electrically driven flaps activated by a switch on the instrument panel; other former floor controls (the elevator trim wheel and fuel shutoff valve) were now on a small vertical console beneath the panel. The electric flaps now had a flap position indicator above the left door. The 6.00×6 inch (150×150 mm) main wheels with large low-pressure tires were now standard rather than optional, and they had new brakes. The stall warning alert, previously an electric beeper, was now a pneumatic reed horn that would work even if electrical power failed. The pointed propeller spinner and rear-view mirror options became standard for the Commuter and Trainer. Other newly standard features for the Commuter were dual controls (previously restricted to the Trainer), wheel speed fairings, and an electric heater for the pitot tube and stall warning sensor. The old optional Patroller-type door (with an extra window in the lower half) was dropped along with the name &quot;Patroller&quot;, though long-range fuel tanks were still offered. The courtesy light option was also discontinued.
:Cessna greatly expanded 150 production for the 150F; a total of 3,000 of this model were produced. The 1966 model year was also the first production of French Reims-built F150s, with 67 built as the F150F.
;
:1967 model year with the doors bowed outward to make the cabin about wider, and a lowered floor to add head room. Rubber sound isolators were added to the engine cowling to reduce vibration and noise in the cabin. The cabin heating system now allowed heated air to be mixed with fresh air and had a new windshield defroster outlet. The instrument panel&#x27;s layout was changed, and the control yokes now had open tops. The stroke of the nosewheel&#x27;s oleo strut was shortened from to . Both of the old electrical generators, 20-ampere and 35-ampere, were replaced by a new 60-ampere alternator. The anti-collision beacon (standard on the Commuter, optional elsewhere) was changed from the old motorized revolving type to a new flashing type. Separately adjustable bucket seats were now standard for the Commuter and could be either fabric or vinyl-covered. The Commuter got standard wall-to-wall carpet. Tinted windows were a new option. The 150G was also the first Cessna 150 variant certified for floats. For floatplane operation it used a larger diameter propeller and had a gross weight of .
:A total of 2,666 150G models were built by Cessna; one prototype (c/n 649) and 2,655 production aircraft. Another 152 were built by Reims in France as the F150G. Unlike the F150F, which was powered by a Continental-built engine, the engines of the F150G and subsequent Reims-built F150s were license-built by Rolls-Royce.
:1968 model year with streamlined speed fairings at the ends of the wing struts. The electric flap switch was now a three-way switch: when pushed upward to raise flaps, it would stay in that position, making this operation &quot;hands-off&quot;, but lowering the flaps still required holding the switch downward. The flap position indicator was now vertical, on the left front doorpost, and the center console was narrowed to improve legroom. A new wing leveler option could automatically control the ailerons and rudder to keep the aircraft on course. 2,110 were built, plus one prototype converted from the 150G prototype (c/n 649). Reims also built 170 aircraft as the F150H.
:The &quot;I&quot; model was skipped to avoid confusion with a numeral 1.
:1969 model year an improved instrument panel layout, which finally adopted the &quot;basic-T&quot; arrangement that would be used for all later 150 models. The 150J also had rocker-style electrical switches instead of the former pull-type ones, and a new key-operated combined magneto/starter-switch replaced the old &quot;pull-style&quot; starter. The new starter was more &quot;car-like&quot; but not as reliable as the old one and also more expensive to repair. New options were a map light under the control wheel and a ground power plug, and extra steps and handles were added to the floatplane version to make fueling easier. 1,820 built, plus 140 built by Reims as the F150J.
;
:1970 model year with a split master switch that could turn off the alternator separately, a ground-adjustable rudder trim tab, a new molded cabin headliner, and new seats with greater legroom. New options included tinted dual overhead skylights for upward visibility, extra steps and handles to aid in fueling, whitewall tires, and &quot;conically cambered&quot; wingtips that curved downward toward the trailing edge. On the 150K Commuter, the cambered wingtips were standard.
:In addition to the standard 150K, the 1970 model year introduced a version certified for aerobatics as the A150K Aerobat. The Aerobat retained the normal 150&#x27;s Continental O-200 engine, but structurally it was stronger than the normal 150K, being rated for load factors of +6.0/−3.0 &quot;g&quot; (vs. +4.4/–1.76 &quot;g&quot; for the normal 150K) and having higher limits for its maneuvering and never-exceed speeds. Other Aerobat standard features included the dual skylights already mentioned, shoulder harnesses for both occupants, removable seat backs and cushions to make room for a back-pack or seat-pack parachute, jettisonable doors, and a special checkerboard paint scheme; there was also an optional accelerometer for the instrument panel. The Aerobat was approved for a variety of maneuvers that were not permitted for normal 150s, but it still had the normal 150&#x27;s gravity-fed fuel system, so sustained inverted flight was not possible. A 1970 A150K Aerobat cost $12,000 as opposed to the $11,450 price for a 150K Commuter model.
:A total of 1101 were built; 875 as the 150K and 226 as the A150K. Reims also built a total of 210 aircraft; 129 as the F150K and 81 as the FA150K Aerobat.
:Introduced for the 1971 model year with tubular landing gear legs replacing the previous flat steel leaf spring gear. Also in 1971, the landing and taxi lights were moved from the wing leading edge to the nose bowl to better illuminate the ground. The 150L also introduced a longer dorsal strake that reached to the rear window. The 1972 model year the received new fuel filler caps to reduce moisture seepage, and better seats and seat tracks. 1973 brought in lower seats to provide more headroom for taller pilots. 1974 introduced a new propeller with a Clark Y airfoil on the A150L Aerobat, which increased cruise by .
:In 1972, Reims introduced the FRA150L Aerobat, which was powered by a Rolls-Royce O-240-A engine; the first engine change for the 150 type since production began. The FRA150L was produced alongside the O-200-powered F150L and FA150L Aerobat, and could be converted to FA150L standard with an FKA150-2311 or FKA150-2316 kit.
:Cessna built a total of 4,074 aircraft; 625 (1971 150L), 50 (1971 A150L), 1,030 (1972 150L), 66 (1972 A150L), 1,192 (1973 150L), 87 (1973 A150L), 931 (1974 150L), and 93 (1974 A150L). Reims built a total of 665 aircraft; 485 (F150L), 39 (FA150L), and 141 (FRA150L). DINFIA also produced a total of 48 150L/A150Ls in Argentina as the A-150L and A-A150L; 39 (A-150L), 6 (1972 A-A150L), and 3 (1973 A-A150L).
;
:Introduced for the 1975 model year, the 150M was the final Cessna 150 model before the type was replaced by the 152. The primary change was a redesigned vertical tail that was taller, narrower, and had an overall larger area. Inertia-reel restraints were also offered as an option. The 150M introduced the Commuter II upgrade package that included many optional avionics and trim items as standard. The 1976 model year introduced redesigned wheel fairings, a suite of electrical circuit breakers to replace the previous fuses, and a fully articulated pilot seat as standard equipment (this seat had been optional on some earlier models).
:The 1977 model year was the last for the Cessna 150. It added only &quot;pre-select&quot; flaps, allowing the pilot to set the flaps to any position without the pilot having to hold the switch during flap travel, enabling the pilot to concentrate on other flying duties. Only 427 1977 model 150Ms were built as production shifted to the improved Cessna 152 in the early part of 1977.
:The many refinements incorporated into the 150 over the years had cost the aircraft a lot of useful load. The very first 150 weighed empty, whereas the last Commuter II had an empty weight of . This increase in empty weight of was offset only by a gross weight increase of in 1964. The 152 would bring a much-needed increase in gross weight to .
:A total of 3,836 aircraft were built; 1,224 (1975 150M), 87 (1975 A150M), 1,500 (1976 150M), 75 (1976 A150M), 900 (1977 150M), and 50 (1977 A150M). Reims built a total of 360 aircraft as the F150M, FA150M, and FRA150M; 285 (F150M) and 75 (FA150M/FRA150M).

==Modifications available==
There are hundreds of modifications available for the Cessna 150. Some of the most frequently installed include:
* Vortex generators and STOL kits that reduce the stall speed of the plane.
* Flap gap seals to reduce drag and increase rate of climb.
* Different wing tips, some of which claim various cruise speed increases and stall speed reductions.
* Auto fuel STCs, which permit the use of automobile fuel instead of the more expensive aviation fuel.
* Larger engines, up to .
* Taildragger landing gear.
* Auxiliary fuel tanks for larger capacity.
* Door catches to replace the factory ones that often fail in service.
* Belly fuel drain valves to drain fuel from the lowest point in the fuel system.

The Aviat 150 is an overhauled and rebuilt Cessna 150 by Aviat.

==Noteworthy flights==
* On September 12, 1994, Frank Eugene Corder intentionally crashed a Cessna 150L onto the South Lawn of the White House against the south wall of the Executive Mansion, in an apparent suicide. Corder was killed, but no one else was injured and damage to property on the ground was minimal.
* In 1996, a Cessna 150 was flown from the United States to South Africa in several stages, crossing the Atlantic along the way. An extra 60 gallon fuel tank was installed (beyond the standard 22.5 gallons) and the plane took off over gross weight.

==Notable accidents==
*27 March 1968: Ozark Air Lines Flight 965, a Douglas DC-9-15, collided with a 150F, aircraft registration &quot;N8669G&quot;, approximately north of Lambert–St. Louis Municipal Airport (Lambert Field), St. Louis, Missouri, while both aircraft were approaching runway 17. The Cessna was destroyed and both of its occupants were killed. The DC-9 sustained light damage and was able to land safely; none of its 44 passengers or five crewmembers were injured. The accident was attributed to inadequate visual flight rules (VFR) procedures at the airport, the failure of the DC-9 pilots to notice the Cessna, and poor communications between air traffic control and the Cessna pilots.
* 4 August 1968: Cessna 150F &quot;N8742S&quot; collided with North Central Airlines Flight 261, a Convair CV-580, southwest of General Mitchell Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at , as the northbound Convair was on approach to runway 7R. The cabin section of the Cessna became embedded in the Convair&#x27;s forward baggage compartment. The Convair lost electrical power and its right engine was shut down due to a damaged propeller; the captain completed a successful emergency landing six minutes later. All three occupants aboard the Cessna were killed and the first officer on the Convair was seriously injured, but the other three crew and eight passengers were uninjured. The accident was attributed to the inability of the Convair 580 flight crew to see the Cessna in sufficient time to take evasive action, despite having been provided with three radar traffic advisories. Contributing factors were heavy insect smears on the Convair&#x27;s cockpit windows, haze, smoke and sun glare, and the Cessna&#x27;s inconspicuous color and its lack of relative motion as the two aircraft converged.
* 9 January 1971: 150J &quot;N60942&quot; collided with American Airlines Flight 30, a Boeing 707-323C, at about Edison, New Jersey, while the 707 was on approach to Newark Airport. The Cessna ran head-on into the 707&#x27;s outer left wing and went out of control due to impact damage, crashing and killing both its occupants. The 707, although itself damaged, landed safely in Newark; there were no injuries among its 14 passengers and 7 crew. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found the cause to be &quot;the inability of the crews of both aircraft to see and avoid each other while operating in a system which permits VFR aircraft to operate up to 3,000 feet on random headings and altitudes in a congested area under conditions of reduced visibility.&quot;
* 4 August 1971: 150J &quot;N61011&quot; collided with Continental Air Lines Flight 712, a Boeing 707-324C, at about over Compton, California, while the 707 was making a nighttime approach into Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). The 150 hit the 707&#x27;s outer right wing and was severely damaged, but the instructor pilot retained enough control to make a successful forced landing near a lighted golf course; although the Cessna was destroyed, its pilots both survived with injuries. The 707&#x27;s outer right wing was damaged, but the aircraft landed safely at LAX, and none of its 87 passengers and 9 crew were injured. According to the NTSB, the cause was &quot;the minimum opportunity for the flightcrews [sic] to see and avoid the other aircraft due to the background lights behind the Cessna and the decrease in the Cessna pilots&#x27; visual field resulting from the aircraft&#x27;s wing while turning&quot;.
* 9 January 1975: 150H &quot;N50430&quot; collided with a United States Air Force Convair VT-29D at night over the James River off Newport News, Virginia, while the Convair was on an instrument landing system approach to Langley Air Force Base. The collision killed all aboard both aircraft: the Cessna&#x27;s pilot and passenger and the Convair&#x27;s five crew and two passengers. The NTSB found the probable cause to be &quot;the human limitation inherent in the see-and-avoid concept, which can be critical in a terminal area with a combination of controlled and uncontrolled traffic&quot;, and recommended stricter traffic control procedures for the high-traffic area around Newport News and Langley.
*9 January 1975: Golden West Airlines Flight 261, a de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter, collided with 150 &quot;N11421&quot; at Whittier, California, while on approach to LAX, killing all 14 people on both planes.
*7 July 2015: 150M &quot;N3601V&quot; was involved in a mid-air collision with a General Dynamics F-16CJ Fighting Falcon over Moncks Corner, South Carolina. Both occupants of the Cessna were killed; the pilot of the F-16 ejected safely.

<doc id="848181" wikidata="Q781607" url="?curid=848181" title="Free Officers movement (Egypt)">
<text>The Free Officers () were a group of revolutionary Egyptian nationalist officers in the Egyptian Armed Forces and Sudanese Armed Forces that instigated the Egyptian revolution of 1952. Initially started as a small rebellion military cell under Abdel Moneim Abdel Raouf, which included Gamal Abdel Nasser, Hussein Hamouda, Khaled Mohieddin, Kamal el-Din Hussein, Salah Nasr, Abdel Hakim Amer, and Saad Tawfik, it operated as a clandestine movement of junior officers who were veterans of the Palestine War of 1948–1949 as well as earlier nationalist uprisings in Egypt in the 1940s.

The nationally respected Arab-Israeli War veteran Mohamed Naguib joined the Free Officers in 1949. Naguib&#x27;s hero status, and influence within the army, granted the movement credibility, both within the military and the public at large. He became the official leader of the Free Officers during the turmoil leading up the revolution that toppled King Farouk in 1952. The Movement was succeeded by the Revolutionary Command Council after the overthrow of Farouk that was later succeeded by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces.

==Background ==

The Great Depression affected national economies around the globe, including those of Egypt and Sudan. During this time, the Great Powers in the Arab World and Middle East began removing institutions for economic development after some positive advancement became evident. This encouraged many political groups to organize against the politicians who dominated the parliamentary politics of the time. Workers had become accustomed to development efforts which were meant to stabilize the economies of the region. These state-led initiatives set the standard for what the people expected of their government, including the regulation of imports, industrial investment, commodity distribution, production supervision.

==Formation==
Politicians and government bodies were forced to respond to the demands of groups who were directly affected by the initiative changes and withdrawals. Some of these groups included military officers. While the first military coups began in Syria in the late 1940s, it was the Free Officers coup in Egypt and the revolution of 1952 that would have the greatest impact, and encourage later movements. The members were not from the wealthy elite, but rather the middle class, young workers, government officials and junior officers. The movement, which began and spread throughout the 1940s, came to fruition with the leadership of Gamal Abdel Nasser. Nasser, who commanded the loyalty and respect of the other members, formed a coordinating committee (1949), which he was later asked to lead (1950).

Coming from a modest background, he represented the group&#x27;s majority: the hard-working middle class. The Free Officers consisted of urban dwellers and educated militants with a lower-middle-class upbringing. Nasser was a war hero who rose quickly in military rank to colonel. He, like many others, dedicated his time and energy to reversing the corruption seen on the part of the government throughout the 1947–1949 Palestine war by restoring a democracy. He saw the problem of domestic passivity towards imperialism as being as much a problem as imperialism itself. The Free Officers strengthened a &quot;new&quot; middle class. Due to this dedication to change, the Free Officers referred to their group and its entirety as simply a &quot;movement.&quot; Later however, it would become a revolution.
The Free Officers Committee enlisted General Muhammad Naguib as a public figurehead in preparation for the successful coup of 23 July 1952. The men who had constituted themselves as the Committee of the Free Officers Movement and led the 1952 Revolution were Lieutenant Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser (1917–70), Major Abdel Hakim Amer (1919–67), Lieutenant Colonel Anwar El-Sadat (1918–81), Major Salah Salem (1920–62), Major Kamal el-Din Hussein (1921–99), Wing Commander Gamal Salem (1918–2001), Squadron Leader Hassan Ibrahim (1917–90), Major Khalid Mohieddin (1922–2018), and Wing Commander Abdel Latif Boghdadi (1917–99); Major Hussein el-Shafei (1918–2005) and Lieutenant Colonel Zakaria Mohieddin (1918–2012) joined the committee later.

==World War II==
Anwar Sadat, in his autobiography &quot;In Search of an Identity,&quot; described how the Free Officers movement attempted to defect to the Nazis in advance of the Battle of El Alamein. The Free Officers took aerial photographs of British positions and sent this intelligence along with a letter offering allegiance to Axis in a British warplane headed to Erwin Rommel in El Alamein. &quot;The general feeling in Egypt was against the British and, naturally, in favor of their enemies.&quot; The plan was stifled when the Germans failed to recognize the sign of friendship and shot down the British warplane, a Gloster Gladiator, killing the pilot.
 
The Free Officers continued to try to contact the Germans, and found a pair of German spies who gave Sadat a broken German radio transmitter. However, Sadat, the German spies, and other Free Officers were caught by the British and imprisoned for treason. Sadat was stripped of rank. The Allied victory at the Battle of Alamein put the question to rest and Sadat and other imprisoned Free Officers were granted leniency. Nasser returned from his mission in Sudan in 1943 and assumed control over the Free Officers organization while Sadat was in prison.

==Rise==

In 1951, while operating covertly within the military, the Free Officers formulated a six-point plan to direct their administration following the coup. The program called for the overthrow of British rule in Egypt, the elimination of Egyptian feudalism, the end of the political control of Egypt&#x27;s government by foreign capital, the establishment of social justice, the formation of a strong national army and the creation of a healthy democratic society.

The continued agitation within Egypt as a result of British control led to a series of skirmishes in which British military outposts were attacked. During 1950–52, Arab &quot;fedayeen&quot; in the Suez Canal Zone engaged in guerilla operations against British forces. The pro-British Egyptian government in Cairo issued a public warning to &quot;fedayeen&quot; not to continue their activities. Despite this, attacks were made against the British garrison and the Egyptians who worked with them. At this point, Egyptian nationalist groups were divided and disorganised. The military was the only area that still held some sort of organised mission, which led to the revolution of 1952. The revolutionaries publicised the need for reform and social justice, marched on Cairo and forced King Farouk to abdicate his throne. The revolution led to the end of British control over Egypt, which had begun in 1882 during the Anglo-Egyptian War.

==Legacy==
Similar movements were organised by other groups of junior officers seeking to mimic the Free Officers&#x27; ascent to power. In Iraq, a faction of Arab and Iraqi nationalist officers, who referred to themselves as the &quot;Free Officers&quot;, toppled the pro-British Hashemite government of Nuri al-Said and Faisal II in 1958. Said and Faisal, Nasser&#x27;s chief regional rivals at the time, were both killed during the coup. In 1963 some of the same officers aligned themselves with the Ba&#x27;ath Party and overthrew the government of Abd al-Karim Qasim, who was killed by the organizers of the coup.

In Syria a coalition of Arab nationalist officers, including Nasserists, Ba&#x27;athists and independents, toppled the secessionist government of Nazim al-Qudsi in 1963 and vowed to restore the union with Egypt in the United Arab Republic (1958–1961). In Saudi Arabia during the 1960s the Prince Talal invoked a similar idea, the Free Princes Movement, in an unsuccessful effort to overthrow his country&#x27;s conservative monarchy. He was exiled to Egypt as a result and was given asylum by Nasser.

Then Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi used a similar group to overthrow the Libyan King Idris in 1969.

The anniversary of the Egyptian revolution of 1952 led by the Free Officers is commemorated as Revolution Day, an annual public holiday in Egypt on 23 July.

The name was consciously assumed by the Free Officers and Civilians Movement, led by Brigadier-General Najib al-Salihi who opposed Saddam Hussein.

<doc id="848183" wikidata="Q1995569" url="?curid=848183" title="Thrashcore">
<text>Thrashcore (also known as fastcore) is a fast-tempo subgenre of hardcore punk that emerged in the early 1980s. Thrashcore is essentially sped-up hardcore, adopting a slightly more extreme style by means of its vocals, dissonance, and occasional use of blast beats. Songs are usually very brief, and thrashcore is in many ways a less dissonant, minimally metallic forerunner of grindcore. The genre is sometimes associated with the skateboarder subculture.

==Terminological ambiguity==
Thrashcore is often confused with crossover thrash and sometimes thrash metal. Further confusion is added by the fact that many crossover bands, such as D.R.I., began as influential thrashcore bands. Throughout the &#x27;80s, the term &quot;thrash&quot; was in use as a synonym for hardcore punk (as in the &quot;New York Thrash&quot; compilation of 1982). It eventually came to be used for the faster, more intense style of hardcore punk. The term thrashcore is of recent vintage but dates from at least 1993. The &quot;-core&quot; suffix is necessary to distinguish it from the thrash metal scene, which is also referred to as &quot;thrash&quot; by fans. Still more confusingly, the term &quot;thrashcore&quot; is occasionally used by the music press to refer to thrash metal-inflected metalcore.

==History==

===Origins===
Just as hardcore punk groups distinguished themselves from their punk rock predecessors by their greater intensity and aggression, thrashcore groups (often identified simply as &quot;thrash&quot;) sought to play at breakneck tempos that would radicalize the innovations of hardcore. Early American thrashcore groups included Cryptic Slaughter (Santa Monica), D.R.I. (Houston), HYPE (Toronto, Canada), Septic Death (Boise, Idaho) and Siege (Weymouth, Massachusetts). The British Electro Hippies, the Dutch Lärm, the Italian Raw Power, and the Japanese S.O.B. also practiced important examples of the style. Some of Negative Approach&#x27;s later work was influential on the scene.

===Powerviolence===

The powerviolence scene grew out of thrashcore as an American counterpart to the British grindcore scene, which had emerged from crust punk, with bands such as Septic Death, Infest and Siege being the first to move towards the style. Powerviolence groups saw themselves as distinct from grindcore because of the increasing proximity of grindcore groups to the death metal being performed in Florida, Sweden, and Brazil. Powerviolence groups wished to avoid the association with heavy metal music and culture that crossover thrash, thrash metal, and grindcore had made, while also incorporating &quot;tempo changes with droney and sludgey down tempo parts&quot;. As well as from thrashcore, powerviolence groups also took inspiration from crust punk, and eventually from noise music. Main groups associated with powerviolence included No Comment, Hellnation, Man Is The Bastard, Crossed Out, Charles Bronson, Spazz and Rorschach.

===Grindcore===

Thrashcore groups such as S.O.B., Cryptic Slaughter, Siege and Deep Wound were major influences on early grindcore acts such as Napalm Death, Carcass and Repulsion. Grindcore is considered to be more metallic, due to its influence from crust punk.

===Revival===
The &#x27;90s saw a revival of the thrashcore style, as groups that had previously been associated with powerviolence or grindcore began to explore their debt to this earlier form of extreme music such as rock and metal. This was sometimes referred to as bandana thrash, in reference to the headgear preferred by many of the performers. Prominent &#x27;90s thrashcore groups included Code 13, MK-ULTRA, Guyana Punch Line, What Happens Next? and R.A.M.B.O. (from the United States), Vitamin X (from the Netherlands), Vivisick (from Japan) and Voorhees (from the UK). These groups sometimes felt a greater association with other elements of &#x27;80s hardcore punk, such as straight edge, anarcho-punk, youth crew, or crust punk, than most initial thrashcore groups did.

<text>Kurt Zeitzler (9 June 1895 – 25 September 1963) was a Chief of the Army General Staff in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; of Nazi Germany during World War II. 

Zeitzler was almost exclusively a staff officer, serving as chief of staff in a corps, army, and army group. In September 1942, he was selected by Adolf Hitler as Chief of the Army General Staff, replacing Franz Halder. In early 1943 he was one of the key figures in the decision to launch Operation Citadel, the last major German attack on the Eastern Front, which ended in defeat. Zeitzler lost faith in Hitler&#x27;s judgement, and abandoned his position in July 1944 after suffering a nervous breakdown. Zeitzler was regarded as an energetic and efficient staff officer, noted for his ability in managing the movement of large mobile formations.

==World War I and interwar period==
Born in Goßmar in the Province of Brandenburg, Zeitzler came from a family of pastors. At the age of 18 he joined the 4th Thuringian Infantry Regiment of the German Army on 23 March 1914. Five months later Germany was at war. Zeitzler was promoted to lieutenant in December 1914, and commanded various units, including a pioneer detachment. At the end of the war he was a regimental adjutant.

Zeitzler was chosen as one of the 4,000 officers selected to serve in the Reichswehr, the small German army permitted under the limits of the Treaty of Versailles. He was promoted to captain in January 1928. In 1929 he began three years of service as a staff officer of the 3rd Division. In February 1934 he was transferred to the &quot;Reichswehrministerium&quot; (&quot;Defense Ministry&quot; of the Weimar Republic) and promoted to major. In 1937 he became a staff officer in the operations office for the &quot;Oberkommando des Heeres&quot; (OKH), the headquarters of the German Army. In April 1939 he took command of Infantry Regiment 60, and was promoted to full colonel in June.

==World War II==
During the invasion of Poland in September 1939, Zeitzler was chief of staff to General Wilhelm List, commanding the XXII (Motorized) Corps in the 14th Army. In March 1940 he became chief of staff to General von Kleist, commanding Panzergruppe A, later redesignated 1st Panzer Army. During the Battle of France, Zeitzler brilliantly organized and managed the panzer drive through the Ardennes. He continued in this post through the successful invasion of Yugoslavia and Battle of Greece. On 18 May 1941 Zeitzler was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross.

His greatest success came during Operation Barbarossa, the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union. During the first two months of &quot;Barbarossa&quot;, 1st Panzer Army plunged east into Soviet territory, then moved south to the Black Sea to cut off Soviet forces in the Battle of Uman, then north to encircle Soviet forces around Kiev, then south again across the Dnieper River, and then further south to cut off Soviet forces near the Sea of Azov. Through all this strenuous campaigning, Zeitzler kept 1st Panzer Army moving smoothly and ensured that supplies arrived. In appreciation of Zeitzler, Kleist commented &quot;The biggest problem in throwing about armies in this way was that of maintaining supplies.&quot;

In January 1942, Zeitzler was made chief of staff to General Gerd von Rundstedt, OB West (Commander in Chief West) and commander of Army Group D. He played an important role in responding to the Canadian raid on Dieppe on 19 August 1942.

===Chief of Staff, OKH===
On 24 September 1942 Zeitzler was promoted to &quot;General der Infanterie&quot; (&quot;General of the Infantry&quot;) and simultaneously appointed Chief of the OKH General Staff, replacing Franz Halder. Hitler had been impressed by Zeitzler&#x27;s optimistic and vigorous reports, and chose him over several higher-ranked and more senior officers. Albert Speer states Hitler wanted a reliable assistant who &quot;doesn&#x27;t go off and brood on my orders, but energetically sees to carrying them out.&quot; 

Following Zeitzler&#x27;s promotion, Hitler was initially impressed with his dedication to his task and fighting spirit. In November 1942, Soviet counterattacks surrounded the German Sixth Army in Stalingrad. Zeitzler recommended that Sixth Army immediately break out and withdraw from Stalingrad to the Don bend, where the broken front could be restored. Hitler instead became enraged, overruled Zeitzler, and personally ordered the Sixth Army to stand fast around Stalingrad, where it was destroyed.

During early 1943 Zeitzler developed the initial plans for Operation Citadel, the final major German offensive in the east, and convinced Hitler to undertake the offensive despite the objections raised by several other senior officers. This battle ended in a strategic defeat for the Germans, and a series of defensive battles ensued.

Zeitzler&#x27;s relationship with Hitler deteriorated during 1944. Hitler blamed him for the German defeat in the Crimea during April and May. This caused Zeitzler to signal his desire to resign. By the middle of the year Zeitzler had lost all faith in Hitler&#x27;s tactics as a result of the deteriorating situation in Western Europe after the Allied landing at Normandy and Hitler&#x27;s refusal to allow Army Group Centre to withdraw to more defensible positions on the Eastern Front. On 1 July Zeitzler suffered a nervous breakdown, and fled Hitler&#x27;s Berghof residence. Hitler never spoke to him again, and had him dismissed from the Army in January 1945, refusing him the right to wear a uniform.

==Postwar life==
At the end of the war, Zeitzler was captured by British troops. He was a prisoner of war until the end of February 1947. He appeared as a witness for the defense during the Nuremberg trials, and worked with the Operational History Section (German) of the Historical Division of the U.S. Army.

Zeitzler died of lung cancer in 1963 in Hohenaschau in Upper Bavaria.

<text>Strigiphilus garylarsoni is a species of chewing louse found only on owls. The species was first described by biologist Dale H. Clayton in 1990, who named it after cartoonist Gary Larson.

Its type host is the Northern white-faced owl (&quot;Ptilopsis leucotis&quot;). The type location is Ndola, Zambia.

==Etymology==
It was named after Gary Larson, creator of the syndicated cartoon &quot;The Far Side.&quot; In a letter to Larson, Clayton praised the cartoonist for &quot;the enormous contribution that my colleagues and I feel you have made to biology through your cartoons.&quot; In his 1989 book &quot;The Prehistory of the Far Side&quot;, Larson stated, &quot;I considered this an extreme honor. Besides, I knew no one was going to write and ask to name a new species of swan after me. You have to grab these opportunities when they come along.&quot; Clayton wrote he honored Larson &quot;in appreciation of the unique light he has shed on the workings of nature.&quot;

<doc id="848195" wikidata="Q1463270" url="?curid=848195" title="Perfect Day (Lou Reed song)">
<text>&quot;Perfect Day&quot; is a song written by American musician Lou Reed in 1972. It was originally featured on &quot;Transformer&quot;, Reed&#x27;s second post-Velvet Underground solo album, and as B-side of his major hit, &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;. Its fame was given a boost in the 1990s when it was featured in the 1996 film &quot;Trainspotting&quot; and after a star-studded version was released as a BBC charity single in 1997, reaching number one in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Norway. Reed re-recorded the song for his 2003 album &quot;The Raven&quot;.

==Recording and composition==
The original recording, as with the rest of the &quot;Transformer&quot; album, was produced by David Bowie and Mick Ronson (who also wrote the string arrangement and played piano on the track). The song has a sombre vocal delivery and a slow, piano-based instrumental backing.

The song was written after Lou Reed and his then fiancée (later his first wife), Bettye Kronstad, spent a day in Central Park. The lyric is often considered to suggest simple, conventional romantic devotion, possibly alluding to Reed&#x27;s relationship with Kronstad and Reed&#x27;s own conflicts with his sexuality, drug use and ego.

Some commentators have further seen the lyrical subtext as displaying Reed&#x27;s romanticized attitude towards a period of his own addiction to heroin. This popular understanding of the song as an ode to addiction led to its inclusion in the soundtrack for &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, a film about the lives of heroin addicts. However, this interpretation, according to Reed himself, is &quot;laughable&quot;. In an interview in 2000, Reed stated, &quot;No. You&#x27;re talking to the writer, the person who wrote it. No that&#x27;s not true. I don&#x27;t object to that, particularly...whatever you think is perfect. But this guy&#x27;s vision of a perfect day was the girl, sangria in the park, and then you go home; a perfect day, real simple. I meant just what I said.&quot;

==In other media==
The song has featured in commercials such as an AT&amp;T advertisement which ran during the 2010 Olympics, and an advertisement by Sony for the launch of the PlayStation 4 in October 2013, two weeks before Reed&#x27;s death. The song has also appeared in TV shows including &quot;Fear the Walking Dead,&quot; 
&quot;The Tenth Meal&quot; the season one finale of &quot;The Mist&quot;, &quot;Doom Patrol&quot;, and &quot;Our Flag Means Death.&quot; In 2015, the song appeared as ironic counterpoint to the main character Jim Gordon (Ben McKenzie)&#x27;s demotion in the season 2 premiere &quot;Damned If You Do...&quot; of the TV series &quot;Gotham&quot;. The song was also featured in the 2020 TV series, &quot;Brave New World&quot;, based on the book by Aldous Huxley.

In 2020, the song was performed by a choir of past and present cast members of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on the show&#x27;s April 11 episode as a tribute to the show&#x27;s longtime music producer Hal Willner, following his death from COVID-19 earlier in the week. In 2021, a cover version by Scala &amp; Kolacny Brothers was used in the trailer for the 2021 film &quot;Spencer&quot;.

An orchestral version of the song by composer Ramin Djawadi was featured in &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; the 5th episode of season 4 of &quot;Westworld&quot;. The original version is also used in the teaser trailer.

The song is featured in the 2023 film &quot;Perfect Days&quot; by Wim Wenders.

==Live performances and cover versions==

In the 1980s, Heaven 17 covered this song on their third B.E.F. album &quot;Music of Quality and Distinction Volume One&quot; in 1982 with the track credited to lead singer Glenn Gregory, and the early Human League performed it live numerous times, but the first significant cover came in the 1990s.

==Duran Duran version==
A cover version of &quot;Perfect Day&quot; was the first single from the Duran Duran covers album &quot;Thank You&quot; (1995). It was released in the United Kingdom on March 13, 1995 by EMI and Capitol Records, and reached number 28 on the UK Singles Chart the same month. The cover was also released to US radio on May 23, 1995.

The song featured a then rare appearance by Duran Duran&#x27;s first drummer Roger Taylor. He also appeared in the music video and in a promotional appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. The video was filmed in February 1995 by director Nick Egan, and first aired in March. It shows clips of the band performing, interspersed with surreal images.

The single was released in several versions, including numerous different remixes of the title track and other Duran Duran songs. In addition to the single and the &quot;Thank You&quot; album, the song also appeared in Duran Duran&#x27;s &quot;Singles 1986–1995&quot; box set, released in 2004. On Duran Duran&#x27;s episode of &quot;Behind the Music&quot;, Reed described the Duran Duran version as being potentially the best rerecording of any of his songs. 

===Critical reception===
Pete Stanton from &quot;Smash Hits&quot; gave Duran Duran&#x27;s version four out of five, writing, &quot;&#x27;Perfect Day&#x27; just could get everyone excited again. It&#x27;s a haunting melody with a cheery message like &quot;feed animals in the zoo&quot;.&quot;
==Kirsty MacColl and Evan Dando version==

In 1994, British singer-songwriter Kirsty MacColl and American musician Evan Dando recorded the song as a duet. It was included as one of two new tracks on MacColl&#x27;s 1995 compilation album &quot;Galore&quot; and reached number 75 in the UK Singles Chart when released as a single on June 12, 1995 by Virgin Records.

MacColl has described the song as &quot;glorious and tragic at the same time&quot;. Speaking of her collaboration with Dando, she told Steve Harris in 1995: &quot;I met Evan a couple of years ago and we sort of talked about possibly doing something together. When I was recording the new tracks for [&quot;Galore&quot;], I thought &quot;Perfect Day&quot; would be a really good song to do as a duet [and that] he would be the ideal person to sing it with me.&quot; MacColl was initially unsure of how to contact Dando, but decided to record the backing track in anticipation of being able to add his contribution at a later date. By coincidence, Dando phoned MacColl two days after the backing track was recorded to let her know he was performing in London with his band The Lemonheads and he agreed to provide vocals on the track while in the UK. In 2022, Dando recalled to &quot;Stereogum&quot; that collaborating with MacColl was &quot;great&quot; and &quot;really fun&quot;.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Music Week&quot; described &quot;Perfect Day&quot; as a &quot;hugely sentimental ballad&quot; with Dando &quot;shockingly in deep-voiced crooner mode&quot;. Nick Marshall of the &quot;Hull Daily Mail&quot; considered the version to be &quot;very moody&quot; and remarked about Dando&#x27;s vocals, &quot;If you think Bob Geldof has attitude, listen to Dando.&quot; He felt that MacColl &quot;fits well into this serene ballad, but battles in sharp contrast to her spritely lyrics she has become renowned for&quot;. Caitlin Moran of the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; praised it as &quot;a languorous version&quot; on which MacColl and Dando duet &quot;beautifully&quot;. 

Anthony Barnes of the &quot;Sunderland Echo&quot; called it a &quot;faithful rendition in the wake of the dreadful Duran Duran version&quot; and a &quot;perfect pairing of vocal talents for this sombre classic&quot;. Jennifer Nine of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; was critical of what she felt was a &#x27;pablum-smooth rendition&quot;, in which &quot;every last bit of menace, irony and life has been sucked out&quot; and MacColl and Dando sound &quot;Prozac-ed into a coma&quot;. Mark Sutherland from &quot;Smash Hits&quot; gave it four out of five, writing, &quot;It&#x27;s a lovely song. Kirsty has one of the most beautiful voices in pop and even old bonkers Lemonhead Evan relocates the plot for long enough to make a husky-but-lovely contribution to the tune. If you&#x27;re gonna duet, duet right — and these two certainly duet fantastically.&quot;
==BBC corporate film and charity release==

In 1997, the BBC made a version of the song in a lengthy corporate promotion of its diverse music coverage which was broadcast on BBC channels, in cinemas, and at major events organised by the BBC such as the Eurovision Song Contest 1998. It featured Lou Reed himself and other major artists in what the &quot;Financial Times&quot; described as &quot;an astonishing line-up of world class performers&quot;. In reference to the licence fee, the film ends with the message &quot;Whatever your musical taste, it is catered for by BBC Radio and Television. This is only possible thanks to the unique way the BBC is paid for by you. BBC. You make it what it is.&quot; This message appears over the repeated words &quot;You&#x27;re going to reap just what you sow&quot; which &quot;The Guardian&quot; described as &quot;a none too subtle message: keep writing the cheque.&quot; In response to accusations from commercial competitors that the corporation had wasted vast sums on the film, Steve Kelynack, the film&#x27;s executive producer, revealed that each artist received a &quot;token&quot; £250, which was at the time the minimum pay for a performance on BBC.

Prompted by huge public demand, the track was released on November 17, 1997, as a charity single for Children in Need, and Reed commented, &quot;I have never been more impressed with a performance of one of my songs.&quot; It was the UK&#x27;s number one single for three weeks, in two separate spells. The record contributed £2,125,000 to the charity&#x27;s highest fundraising total in six years, and, as of November 2016, has sold 1.54 million copies. The release featured two additional versions of the song: one entirely sung by female performers, one by male performers. The BBC also produced a Christmas version of the accompanying music video.

In Ireland, the song was a huge success, remaining at number one for seven weeks and becoming 1997&#x27;s Christmas number one. The single also topped the Norwegian Singles Chart for seven weeks in late 1997 and early 1998, spending 17 weeks on the chart in total. Elsewhere in Europe, it reached number four in Finland, number six in the Netherlands, number seven in Flemish Belgium and number 10 in Iceland. It was also a top-thirty hit in Austria, New Zealand and Walloon Belgium.

The song has not been digitally released to digital music platforms as the &quot;single [is] unusable again in a commercial context due to the specific nature of the clearances for Children In Need at the time&quot;.

===Sequels===
Following the success of the &quot;Perfect Day&quot; music video, the BBC produced three further similar campaigns. The first, &quot;Future Generations&quot;, in December 1998, did a similar multi-celebrity montage with favourite BBC children&#x27;s programmes. The second, called &quot;Shaggy Dog Story&quot;, featured various comedians and comic actors telling a long-winded shaggy dog story, with each one sharing a line or phrase. A second, shorter shaggy dog story, entitled &quot;Mammals vs. Insects&quot;, was also broadcast on January 4, 2000. Seventeen years after &quot;Perfect Day&quot;&#x27;s release, the BBC produced a campaign for their new music division where 27 musicians (labelled &quot;The Impossible Orchestra&quot;) covered the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;God Only Knows&quot;. The only person to appear in both campaigns is Sir Elton John.

The cover was parodied on a 1997 special &quot;Harry Enfield and Chums&quot;, as well as by Matt Lucas and David Walliams.

The single inspired Sony Music to release a various artists compilation album, &quot;Perfect Day&quot;, in early 1998. It reached number 7 in the UK Compilation Chart. It featured Reed&#x27;s original version of the song instead of the Various Artists version.

===Music Live 2000===
A BBC live television event in 2000, which consisted of music programs around the clock, ended in another round-robin performance of &quot;Perfect Day&quot;. Although watched by millions, the recording of the show that was released as a single was not a chart success, reaching only number 69 in mid-June 2000.

This line-up included Rolf Harris and a beginning and ending performance from Lou Reed himself.

==Susan Boyle version==
Scottish recording artist Susan Boyle covered the song on her second album, &quot;The Gift&quot; (2010), and also released it on November 8, 2010, as a single by Syco/Columbia Records.

On November 19, 2010, she performed the song on &quot;Children in Need&quot;. She also performed this again at the 82nd Royal Variety Performance, performed on the December 9, 2010.

===Conflict with Lou Reed===
In September 2010, Susan Boyle had to cancel a performance on &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; at the last minute. She had planned to sing &quot;Perfect Day&quot;, but two hours before the show, she was told that Lou Reed had intervened, refusing her permission to perform his song and to include it on her forthcoming album &quot;The Gift&quot;. As she and her choir did not have time to rehearse another number, she decided to cancel her performance. A couple of days later, representatives of Reed stated that he had nothing to do with the decision and that it was just a licensing glitch.

A couple of weeks later, Reed agreed not only to let her include the song on &quot;The Gift&quot;, but also to produce her music video of the song. It was shot on the banks of Loch Lomond and premiered on November 7, 2010.

===Charts===
==Vatican tweet==
Soon after Reed&#x27;s death in 2013, Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, the Vatican&#x27;s culture minister, made news by tweeting lyrics from the song:
&lt;poem&gt;Oh, it&#x27;s such a perfect day
I&#x27;m glad I spent it with you
Oh, such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on&lt;/poem&gt;

As the song is widely interpreted by listeners to be drug-related, the cardinal later clarified that he did not condone drug use.

<doc id="848200" wikidata="Q676152" url="?curid=848200" title="Quad flat package">
<text>A quad flat package (QFP) is a surface-mounted integrated circuit package with &quot;gull wing&quot; leads extending from each of the four sides. Socketing such packages is rare and through-hole mounting is not possible. Versions ranging from 32 to 304 pins with a pitch ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 mm are common. Other special variants include low-profile QFP (LQFP) and thin QFP (TQFP).

The QFP component package type became common in Europe and United States during the early nineties, even though it has been used in Japanese consumer electronics since the seventies. It is often mixed with hole mounted, and sometimes socketed, components on the same printed circuit board (PCB).

A package related to QFP is plastic leaded chip carrier (PLCC) which is similar but has pins with larger pitch, 1.27 mm (or 1/20 inch), curved up underneath a thicker body to simplify socketing (soldering is also possible). It is commonly used for NOR flash memories and other programmable components.

==Limitations==
The quad flat-pack has connections only around the periphery of the package. To increase the number of pins, the spacing was decreased from 50 mil (as found on small outline packages) to 20 and later 12 (1.27 mm, 0.51 mm and 0.30 mm respectively). However, this close lead spacing made solder bridges more likely and put higher demands on the soldering process and alignment of parts during assembly. The later pin grid array (PGA) and ball grid array (BGA) packages, by allowing connections to be made over the area of the package and not just around the edges, allowed for higher pin counts with similar package sizes, and reduced the problems with close lead spacing.

==Variants==
The basic form is a flat rectangular (often square) body with leads on four sides but with numerous variation in the design. These differ usually only in lead number, pitch, dimensions, and materials used (usually to improve thermal characteristics). A clear variation is bumpered quad flat package (BQFP) with extensions at the four corners to protect the leads against mechanical damage before the unit is soldered.

Heat sink quad flat package, &quot;heatsink very thin quad flat-pack no-leads&quot; (&quot;HVQFN&quot;) is a package with no component leads extending from the IC. Pads are spaced along the sides of the IC with an exposed die that can be used as ground. Spacing between pins can vary.

A thin quad flat pack (TQFP) provides the same benefits as the metric QFP, but is thinner. Regular QFP are 2.0 to 3.8 mm thick depending on size. TQFP packages range from 32 pins with a 0.8 mm lead pitch, in a package 5 mm by 5 mm by 1 mm thick, to 256 pins, 28 mm square, 1.4 mm thick and a lead pitch of 0.4 mm.

TQFPs help solve issues such as increasing board density, die shrink programs, thin end-product profile and portability. Lead counts range from 32 to 176. Body sizes range from to . Copper lead-frames are used in TQFPs. Lead pitches available for TQFPs are 0.4 mm, 0.5 mm, 0.65 mm, 0.8 mm, and 1.0 mm. &quot;PQFP&quot;, or plastic quad flat pack, is a type of QFP, as is the thinner TQFP package. PQFP packages can vary in thickness from 2.0 mm to 3.8 mm. A low-profile quad flat package (LQFP) is a surface mount integrated circuit package format with component leads extending from each of the four sides. Pins are numbered counter-clockwise from the index dot. Spacing between pins can vary; common spacings are 0.4, 0.5, 0.65 and 0.80 mm intervals.

Some QFP packages have an exposed pad. The exposed pad is an extra pad underneath or on top of the QFP that may act as a ground connection and/or as a heat sink for the package. The pad is typically 10 or more mm2, and with the pad soldered down onto the ground plane, heat is passed into the PCB. This exposed pad also gives a solid ground connection. These type of QFP packages often have a -EP suffix (e.g. a LQFP-EP 64), or they have an odd number of leads, (e.g. a TQFP-101).

==Ceramic QFP package==
Ceramic QFP packages come in two variants, CERQUAD and CQFP:

===CERQUAD packages===
Hereby the leadframe is attached between two ceramic layers of the package. The leadframe is attached using glass. This package is a variant of the CERDIP package. CERQUAD packages are the &quot;low cost&quot; alternative for CQFP packages, and are mainly used for terrestrial applications.
Main ceramic package manufacturers are Kyocera, NTK... and offer the full pincount range

===CQFP packages===
Hereby the leads are soldered on top of the package. The package is a multilayer package, and is offered as HTCC (high temperature co-fired ceramic). The number of bonding decks can be one, two or three. Package is finished with a nickel plus a &quot;thick&quot; gold layer, except where the leads are soldered and decoupling capacitors are soldered on top of the package. These packages are hermetic. Two methods are used in order to make the hermetic sealing: eutectic gold-tin alloy (melting point 280°C) or seam welding. Seam welding gives rise to significantly less temperature rise in the internal of the package (e.g., the die attach). This package is the main package used for Space projects.

Due to the large body size of CQFP packages, parasitics are important for this package. Power supply decoupling is improved by having the decoupling capacitors mounted on top of this package. E.g. TI offers 256-pin CQFP packages where decoupling capacitors can be soldered on top of the package E.g. Test-expert 256-pin CQFP packages where decoupling capacitors can be soldered on top of the package.

The main ceramic package manufacturers are Kyocera (Japan), NTK (Japan), Test-Expert (Russia), etc. and offer the full pincount range. Maximum pin count is 352 pins.

<text>A blank is a firearm cartridge that, when fired, does not shoot a projectile like a bullet or pellet, but generates a muzzle flash and an explosive sound (muzzle report) like a normal gunshot would. Firearms may need to be modified to allow a blank to cycle the action, and the shooter experiences less recoil with a blank than with a live round. Blanks are often used in prop guns for shooting simulations that have no need for ballistic results, but still demand light and sound effects, such as in historical reenactments, special effects for theatre, movie and television productions, combat training, for signaling (see starting pistol), and cowboy mounted shooting. Specialised blank cartridges are also used for their propellant force in fields as varied as construction, shooting sports, and fishing and general recreation.

While blanks are less dangerous than live ammunition, they can still be dangerous and can still cause fatal injuries. Beside the explosive gases, any objects in the cartridge (like wadding that may be keeping the propellant in place, or objects lodged in the barrel) will be propelled at high velocity and cause injury or death at close range.

Blank cartridges differ from the inert/fake ammunitions such as dummy cartridges and snap caps, which contain no primer or gunpowder to even produce flash and sound and are used for &quot;cold&quot; training or function-testing firearm actions. They are also different from the percussion caps used in cap guns, which also produce a sound of gunfire but only consist of the equivalent of the primer with no propellant, so they sound much quieter.

== Applications ==
Blanks are commonly used when the sound and flash of gunfire is needed, but a projectile would not be safe, such as in military training manoeuvres or funeral honours, in movies or live theatre that require gunfights, in starter pistols to signal the beginning of races, and in the equestrian sport of cowboy mounted shooting.

Standard firearms that are self-loading require modification to their mechanism, or else a blank firing adapter to allow the action to cycle. This is because in the absence of a projectile to oppose the force of the gases, the lower pressures and lower recoil generated by a blank cartridge are insufficient to cycle the gun’s mechanism in the same way that a standard live round would.

For military applications, blanks are typically used with a special blank-firing adaptor in the firearm that constricts the barrel, keeping chamber pressures created by the blank high enough and for long enough to cycle the firearm&#x27;s gas-operated action. In the case of non-crimped blanks, it also serves to pulverise the plug to prevent it leaving as a projectile.

Specially designed blank-firing prop firearms are sometimes used for movies, thereby avoiding gun control legislation and increasing the margin of safety because they cannot be loaded with live ammunition. 5-in-1 blanks are specifically made for theatrical use and are commonly used in real firearms for dramatic effect. 5-in-1 blanks can function in a variety of different calibres, hence the name.

Special blank cartridges are also used when the explosive power of a cartridge is needed, but a projectile is not. Blank cartridges were commonly used for launching a messenger line, tear-gas or rifle grenades, though some types of grenades are capable of trapping the bullet of a live round. Larger blanks are also used for line launching guns, such as the line launching kit for the Mossberg 500 shotgun.

Blank rimfire cartridges, commonly called &quot;power loads&quot;, are also used in some nail guns (powder-actuated tools), where the power is tapped to force a heavy piston into the nail, with enough force to bury its full length into steel or concrete.

Some forms of fast draw competitions use special blanks that are loaded with a layer of slow burning rifle powder on top of a thin layer of faster-burning pistol powder. The pistol powder ignites the slower burning rifle powder, and fires it out of the barrel much like a shotgun shell. The burning powder only travels a few yards before it completely combusts, but that is far enough to burst the balloon used as a target for those competitions. Wax bullets are also commonly used for competitions and training where a non-lethal projectile is required.

A blank cartridge was sometimes also issued to a randomly selected shooter in an execution by firing squad, on the theory that each of the shooters would take comfort in the fact that they may not have fired a live round. This tradition dates back to before cartridge arms, when a muzzle loading musket would be loaded without a ball.

Some abattoir captive bolt pistols are powered by blank cartridges.

Blank 12-gauge shotgun cartridges are also used in &quot;alarm mines&quot;, devices that use a tripwire to produce an extremely loud report in order to alert people in the vicinity.

Blank rounds have been used to contain the propellant within an empty cartridge, or in some cases as a piston to unlock the bolt and operate the weapon. These types of rounds are rarely used and are mostly found on spotting rifles.

==Safety== 
The appearance of a blank cartridge can give a false sense of safety. Although blank cartridges do not contain a bullet, precautions are still required because fatalities and severe injuries have resulted on occasions when blank cartridges have been fired at very close ranges.

Blank cartridges frequently contain a paper, wood or plastic plug called a &quot;wad&quot; that seals the powder in the case. This wad can cause severe penetrating wounds at close range and bruising at medium ranges. There is also &quot;muzzle blast&quot; – a jet of hot, expanding gas expelled at extremely high velocity from the muzzle of the firearm. This high-velocity gas can inflict severe injury at close ranges. In addition, if there is any small debris lodged inside the barrel, it will be expelled at a velocity similar to that of a bullet, with the ability to inflict a severe or lethal wound. Furthermore, the extremely loud noise of blanks being fired can damage the hearing of people in the immediate area.

Cartridges loaded with wadcutter target bullets can be mistaken for blanks because the bullet does not protrude past the mouth of the cartridge casing. Shotshell cartridges known as &quot;snake shot&quot; or &quot;rat-shot&quot; used in rifles or handguns for pest control often have the shot charge sealed with cardboard or plastic wads or the ends may be crimped or folded in a manner similar to that of blank cartridges.

===Fatal accidents===
Actors in particular are at serious risk of injury from blank cartridges used on movie sets. Several actors have been killed in such mishaps:
*Brandon Lee was killed while filming a scene for the 1994 film &quot;The Crow&quot; by a .44-caliber S&amp;W Model 629 revolver used as a prop that still contained a bullet from a squib load. A dummy round used during an earlier shoot was handloaded by someone other than a firearms expert, who removed the propellant powder, but unknowingly left a live primer in place, resulting in the bullet being separated from its casing with insufficient energy to exit the barrel. The gun was not properly checked for a retained bullet prior to the incident, and then subsequently fired with a blank cartridge. The blank charge propelled the lodged bullet out the barrel, fatally injuring Lee.
*Jon-Erik Hexum accidentally killed himself on the set of the TV series &quot;Cover Up,&quot; after he placed a blank-loaded .44 Magnum revolver to his right temple and pulled the trigger as a joke — the powerful shockwave from the blank cartridge caused a depression fracture to the skull, sending bone fragments deep into his brain and causing severe intracranial hemorrhage. He died a few days after the accident.
*Johann Ofner, a professional stunt double, was killed by a shotgun wad in 2017 while filming a scene for Bliss n Eso music video &quot;Dopamine&quot; in the Brooklyn Standard bar in Brisbane when an actor fired directly at him.
*In 2015, a 17-year old was playing with a gun used in a St. George, Utah, high school theatre program to be used in a production of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and accidentally killed himself, thinking that &quot;blank&quot; cartridges were harmless.

<doc id="848214" wikidata="Q1053525" url="?curid=848214" title="Blank expression">
<text>A blank expression, also known as a poker face, is a facial expression characterized by neutral positioning of the facial features, implying a lack of strong emotion. It may be caused by emotionlessness, depression, boredom or slight confusion, such as when a listener does not understand what has been said.

Another possible cause for a blank expression is traumatic brain injury such as a concussion. If someone has just been hit on the head and retains a blank or dazed expression, this can warn of concussions early.

Psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, facial paralysis, and post-traumatic stress disorder, may also cause a blank expression.

== Poker face ==
The term &quot;poker face&quot; is described as a deliberately induced blank expression meant to conceal one&#x27;s emotions, referring to the common practice of maintaining one&#x27;s composure when playing the card game poker. This term comes from the special language used in poker, and is not only about a person&#x27;s facial expression but also other extraneous movements that could give insight into what they are feeling, such as clenching fists, bouncing a leg, or constant repositioning of their body and or cards.

The first recorded publication of the term &quot;poker face&quot; is from the 1875 book &quot;Cavendish.&quot; &quot;Round games at cards&quot;, which reads &quot;It follows that the possession of a good poker face is an advantage. No one who has any pretensions to good play will betray the value of his hand by gesture, change of countenance, or any other symptom.&quot;

The term &quot;poker face&quot; was used outside the game of poker by American sportswriters in the 1920s to describe a competitor who appeared unaffected by stressful situations (an important skill when playing poker for money, to avoid giving an opponent any tells about one&#x27;s hand). It is similarly used with reference to marketers and salespeople during business negotiations.

<doc id="848217" wikidata="Q744068" url="?curid=848217" title="Persian alphabet">
<text>The Persian alphabet (), also known as the Perso-Arabic script, is the right-to-left alphabet used for the Persian language. It is a variation of the Arabic script with five additional letters: (the sounds &#x27;g&#x27;, &#x27;zh&#x27;, &#x27;ch&#x27;, and &#x27;p&#x27;, respectively), in addition to the obsolete that was used for the sound . This letter is no longer used in Persian, as the -sound changed to , e.g. archaic &gt; &#x27;language&#x27;.

It was the basis of many Arabic-based scripts used in Central and South Asia. It is used for both Iranian and Dari: standard varieties of Persian; and is one of two official writing systems for the Persian language, alongside the Cyrillic-based Tajik alphabet.

The script is mostly but not exclusively right-to-left; mathematical expressions, numeric dates and numbers bearing units are embedded from left to right. The script is cursive, meaning most letters in a word connect to each other; when they are typed, contemporary word processors automatically join adjacent letter forms. Persian is unusual among Arabic scripts because a zero-width non-joiner is sometimes entered in a word, making a letter becoming not connected by others.

== History ==
The Persian alphabet is directly derived and developed from the Arabic alphabet. The Arabic alphabet was introduced to the Persian-speaking world after the Muslim conquest of Persia and the fall of the Sasanian Empire in the 7th century. Following this, the Arabic language became the principal language of government and religious institutions in Persia, which led to the widespread usage of the Arabic script. Classical Persian literature and poetry were affected by this simultaneous usage of Arabic and Persian. A new influx of Arabic vocabulary soon entered the Persian language. In the 8th century, the Tahirid dynasty and Samanid dynasty officially adopted the Arabic script for writing Persian, followed by the Saffarid dynasty in the 9th century, gradually displacing the various Pahlavi scripts used for the Persian language prior. By the 9th-century, the Perso-Arabic alphabet became the dominant form of writing in Greater Khorasan. 

Under the influence of various Persian Empires, many languages in Central and South Asia that adopted the Arabic script use the Persian Alphabet as the basis of their writing systems. Today, extended versions of the Persian alphabet are used to write a wide variety of Indo-Iranian languages, including Kurdish, Balochi, Pashto, Urdu (from Classical Hindustani), Saraiki, Panjabi, Sindhi and Kashmiri. In the past the use of the Persian alphabet was common amongst Turkic languages, but today is relegated to those spoken within Iran, such as Azerbaijani, Turkmen, Qashqai, Chaharmahali and Khalaj. The Uyghur language in western China is the most notable exception to this.

During the colonization of Central Asia, many languages in the Soviet Union, including Persian, were reformed by the government. This ultimately resulted in the Cyrillic-based alphabet used in Tajikistan today. See: .

== Letters ==
Below are the 32 letters of the modern Persian alphabet. Since the script is cursive, the appearance of a letter changes depending on its position: isolated, initial (joined on the left), medial (joined on both sides) and final (joined on the right) of a word. These include 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet, in addition to 4 other letters.

The names of the letters are mostly the ones used in Arabic except for the Persian pronunciation. The only ambiguous name is , which is used for both and . For clarification, they are often called (literally &quot;-like &quot; after , the name for the letter that uses the same base form) and (literally &quot;two-eyed &quot;, after the contextual middle letterform ), respectively. There are eight Persian letters that are mainly used in Arabic or foreign loanwords and not in native words: , , , , , , , and . These eight letters are also common used in proper names only. Unlike Arabic, the Persian language absolutely does not have pharyngealization at all. Although the letter is mainly used in Arabic loanwords, there are some native Persian words with this letter: , , etc. The pronunciation of these letters in Persian can differ from their pronunciation in Arabic. For example, the letter ث is pronounced as /s/ in Persian, while it is pronounced as /θ/ in Arabic.

=== Overview table ===
Historically, in Early New Persian, there was a special letter for the sound . This letter is no longer used, as the -sound changed to , e.g. archaic /zaβān/ &gt; &#x27;language&#x27;.
Another obsolete variant of the twenty-sixth letter is which used to appear in old manuscripts.

Another obsolete variant of the twenty-fifth letter is which used to appear in old manuscripts.

The archaic letter was also used as a substitute for the twenty-sixth letter of the Persian alphabet, , which was used to appear in the older manuscripts of Persian in the late 18th century to the early 19th century.
==== Variants ====
==== Letter construction ====
 The i&#x27;jam diacritic characters are illustrative only; in most typesetting the combined characters in the middle of the table are used.

 Persian &quot;yē&quot; has 2 dots below in the initial and middle positions only. The standard Arabic version always has 2 dots below.

=== Letters that do not link to a following letter ===
Seven letters (, , , , , , ) do not connect to the following letter, unlike the rest of the letters of the alphabet. The seven letters have the same form in isolated and initial position and a second form in medial and final position. For example, when the letter is at the beginning of a word such as (&quot;here&quot;), the same form is used as in an isolated . In the case of (&quot;today&quot;), the letter takes the final form and the letter takes the isolated form, but they are in the middle of the word, and also has its isolated form, but it occurs at the end of the word.

=== Diacritics ===
Persian script has adopted a subset of Arabic diacritics: ( in Arabic), ( in Arabic), and or ( in Arabic, pronounced in Western Persian), and (gemination). Other Arabic diacritics may be seen in Arabic loanwords in Persian.

==== Short vowels ====
Of the four Arabic diacritics, the Persian language has adopted the following three for short vowels. The last one, sukūn, which indicates the lack of a vowel, has not been adopted. 
 There is no standard transliteration for Persian. The letters &#x27;i&#x27; and &#x27;u&#x27; are only ever used as short vowels when transliterating Dari or Tajik Persian. See Persian Phonology

 Diacritics differ by dialect, due to Dari having 8 distinct vowels compared to the 6 vowels of Farsi. See Persian Phonology 

In Farsi, none of these short vowels may be the initial or final grapheme in an isolated word, although they may appear in the final position as an inflection, when the word is part of a noun group. In a word that starts with a vowel, the first grapheme is a silent which carries the short vowel, e.g. (, meaning &quot;hope&quot;). In a word that ends with a vowel, letters , and respectively become the proxy letters for , and , e.g. (, meaning &quot;new&quot;) or (, meaning &quot;package&quot;).

==== Tanvin (nunation) ====

Nunation (, ) is the addition of one of three vowel diacritics to a noun or adjective to indicate that the word ends in an alveolar nasal sound without the addition of the letter nun.

====Tašdid====

=== Other characters ===
The following are not actual letters but different orthographical shapes for letters, a ligature in the case of the . As to (&quot;hamza&quot;), it has only one graphical form since it is never tied to a preceding or following letter. However, it is sometimes &#x27;seated&#x27; on a , or , and in that case, the seat behaves like an ordinary , or respectively. Technically, &quot;hamza&quot; is not a letter but a diacritic.

Although at first glance, they may seem similar, there are many differences in the way the different languages use the alphabets. For example, similar words are written differently in Persian and Arabic, as they are used differently.

Unicode has accepted in the Miscellaneous Symbols range. In Unicode 1.0 this symbol was known as .
It is a stylization of () used as the emblem of Iran. It is also a part of the flag of Iran.

The Unicode Standard has a compatibility character defined that can represent , the Persian name of the currency of Iran.

=== Novel letters ===
The Persian alphabet has four extra letters that are not in the Arabic alphabet: , (&quot;ch&quot; in &quot;chair&quot;), (&quot;s&quot; in &quot;measure&quot;), . An additional fifth letter was used for (&quot;v in&quot; Spanish ) but it is no longer used.

=== Deviations from the Arabic script ===

Persian uses the Eastern Arabic numerals, but the shapes of the digits &#x27;four&#x27; (), &#x27;five&#x27; (), and &#x27;six&#x27; () are different from the shapes used in Arabic. All the digits also have different codepoints in Unicode:


=== Comparison of different numerals ===

== Word boundaries ==
Typically, words are separated from each other by a space. Certain morphemes (such as the plural ending &#x27;-hâ&#x27;), however, are written without a space. On a computer, they are separated from the word using the zero-width non-joiner.

== Cyrillic Persian alphabet in Tajikistan ==
As part of the russification of Central Asia, the Cyrillic script was introduced in the late 1930s. The alphabet has remained Cyrillic since then. In 1989, with the growth in Tajik nationalism, a law was enacted declaring Tajik the state language. In addition, the law officially equated Tajik with Persian, placing the word &quot;Farsi&quot; (the endonym for the Persian language) after Tajik. The law also called for a gradual reintroduction of the Perso-Arabic alphabet.

The Persian alphabet was introduced into education and public life, although the banning of the Islamic Renaissance Party in 1993 slowed adoption. In 1999, the word &quot;Farsi&quot; was removed from the state-language law, reverting the name to simply &quot;Tajik&quot;. the &quot;de facto&quot; standard in use is the Tajik Cyrillic alphabet, and only a very small part of the population can read the Persian alphabet.

<doc id="848218" wikidata="Q449743" url="?curid=848218" title="Always (1989 film)">
<text>Always is a 1989 American romantic fantasy film directed and produced by Steven Spielberg. It is a remake of the 1943 romantic drama &quot;A Guy Named Joe&quot;, which was set during World War II. The main departure from the 1943 film is changing the setting from wartime to a modern aerial firefighting operation. It, however, follows the same basic plot line: the spirit of a recently dead expert pilot mentors a newer pilot, while watching him fall in love with the girlfriend he left behind. The names of the four principal characters of the earlier film are all the same, except the Ted Randall character, which is called Ted Baker in the remake, and Pete&#x27;s last name is Sandich instead of Sandidge. The film stars Richard Dreyfuss, Holly Hunter, John Goodman, Brad Johnson, and Audrey Hepburn in her final film role. &quot;Always&quot; was released in the United States by Universal Pictures on December 22, 1989.

== Plot ==
Pete Sandich is an aerial firefighter whose excessive risk-taking in the air deeply troubles his girlfriend, Dorinda Durston, a pilot who doubles as an air traffic controller for the firefighters. It also concerns Pete&#x27;s best friend, Al Yackey, a fellow firefighter pilot.

After yet another risky and nearly fatal flight that Pete casually shrugs off, Al suggests he accept a safer job training firefighting pilots in Flat Rock, Colorado. He refuses until Dorinda tearfully confronts him, confessing her perpetual fear and anguish that he will be killed. Pete relents and tells her he will take the training job.

Pete flies one last mission, despite Dorinda&#x27;s gloomy premonition. During the firebombing run, Al&#x27;s engine catches fire and is about to explode. Pete makes a dangerously steep dive and skillfully douses Al&#x27;s engine with a fire-retardant slurry, saving him. As Pete struggles to regain control from the dive, he flies directly through the forest fire, igniting his engine and causing the aircraft to explode.

Pete strolls through a burned-out forest. Coming to a small clearing, he meets Hap, who explains Pete died in the explosion and now has a new purpose: As spirits did for him during his lifetime, he will provide &quot;Spiritus&quot; (&quot;the divine breath&quot;) to guide others who will interpret his words as their thoughts.

Although time is non-linear from Pete&#x27;s perspective, six months have elapsed in the real world and Al wants a grieving Dorinda to move past Pete&#x27;s death. He takes her with him to Colorado to work at the flight school where Pete is to lead pilots who will be training to fight fires, one of which is Ted Baker. More months pass and, to Pete&#x27;s anguish, Ted falls in love with Dorinda as she begins emerging from her year-long mourning. Pete attempts to sabotage the budding romance, but Hap reminds him that his life ended; he was sent to inspire Ted but also to bid Dorinda farewell.

Ted, with Pete&#x27;s inspiration, plans a dangerous rescue mission for trapped firefighters. Unable to bear another loss, Dorinda takes his aircraft to do the job herself. Pete, unseen by Dorinda, fails to dissuade her. However, with Pete&#x27;s guidance, she can save the firefighters who are trapped on the ground. On the return flight, Pete tells Dorinda everything he wants to say in life.

Dorinda makes an emergency water landing in a lake. As the sinking plane&#x27;s cockpit floods, she seems reluctant to escape. Pete appears before her and, offering his hand, leads her to the surface. As Dorinda wades ashore, Pete releases her from his heart for allowing Ted to be replaced. Dorinda walks back to the airbase where she accepts Ted and embraces him. Pete appreciates, smiles, and walks in the opposite direction to assume his place in the afterlife.

== Cast ==

In addition, singer-songwriter JD Souther plays the pianist-singer at the dance near the start of the film.

== Production ==
Steven Spielberg confided that while making &quot;Jaws&quot; in 1974, he and Richard Dreyfuss had traded quips from &quot;A Guy Named Joe&quot;, considered a &quot;classic&quot; war film, that they both wanted to remake. Originally intended to be an MGM project, the film underwent a protracted 10-year gestation, with Tom Cruise reputedly being considered for the Ted Baker role. Dustin Hoffman was offered a role but turned it down.

Dreyfuss had seen the 1943 melodrama &quot;at least 35 times.&quot; For Spielberg, who recalled seeing it as a child late at night, &quot;it was one of the films that inspired him to become a movie director,&quot; creating an emotional connection to the times that his father, a wartime air force veteran had lived through. The two friends quoted individual shots from the film to each other and when the opportunity arose, years later, were resolved to recreate the wartime fantasy.

Principal photography began on May 15, 1989; production took place in northwestern Montana in the Kootenai National Forest, with some scenes filmed in and around Libby. Some 500 of its residents were recruited for the film as extras to act as wildland firefighters. The scenes where the plane flies over the lake at the beginning and lands in the lake at the end of the movie were filmed at Bull Lake, south of Troy. The scenes set in &quot;Flat Rock, Colorado,&quot; were filmed at and around the Moses Lake airport in eastern Washington. The scene where Pete and Hap are walking through the wheat field was filmed at Sprague, southwest of Spokane, where they spent two weeks filming in June. Footage of Yellowstone National Park&#x27;s 1988 fires was used for the fire sequences. Production wrapped in August 1989.

Audrey Hepburn appeared in &quot;Always&quot; in her last film role. Her cameo was an opportunity to raise money for her favorite cause; much of Hepburn&#x27;s one million dollars plus salary was donated to UNICEF.

=== Aircraft used ===
Two Douglas A-26 Invader fire bombers (Douglas B-26C Invader No.57] and Douglas TB-26C Invader No. 59) were prominently featured in &quot;Always&quot;. The flying for the film was performed by well-known film pilot Steve Hinton and Dennis Lynch, The owner of the A-26s. A combination of aerial photography, rear projection, and models was used to create the aerial sequences.

A number of other aircraft also appeared in &quot;Always&quot;: Aeronca 7AC Champion, Bellanca 8KCAB Super Decathlon, Beechcraft Model 18, Cessna 337 Super Skymaster, Cessna 340, Consolidated PBY-5A Catalina, de Havilland Canada DHC-6-300 Twin Otter, Douglas C-54 Skymaster, Fairchild C-119C Flying Boxcar, McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and North American B-25J Mitchell. Two helicopters were also seen: Bell 206 JetRanger and Bell UH-1B Iroquois.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Always&quot; was released the same day as &quot;Tango &amp; Cash&quot; and grossed $3.7 million in its opening weekend, finishing fifth behind &quot;Christmas Vacation&quot;, &quot;Tango &amp; Cash&quot;, &quot;The War of the Roses&quot;, and &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot;. It went on to gross $43.9 million in the U.S. and $30.3 million in foreign territories, for a worldwide total of $74.1 million.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 68% based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Its central romance takes occasional dives into excessive sentimentality, but &quot;Always&quot; otherwise flies high thanks to director Steven Spielberg&#x27;s rousing feel for adventure.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 50 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; considered it &quot;dated&quot; and more of a &quot;curiosity,&quot; calling it Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;weakest film since his comedy &quot;1941&quot;&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; gave it a more generous review: &quot;&quot;Always&quot; is a relatively small scale, engagingly casual, somewhat silly, but always entertaining fantasy.&quot;

== Awards and nominations ==
&quot;Always&quot; was nominated in 1991 for the Saturn Award as Best Fantasy Film, while Jerry Belson was nominated for the Best Writing category of the award at the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films (USA). Several critics have now considered the film as the progenitor of a new crop of &quot;ghost&quot; genre films, including &quot;Ghost&quot; (1990).

<text>Charlotte Gentry Burks (born October 3, 1942) is a farmer and Democratic party politician in Tennessee who represented the 15th district as State Senator from 1998 until 2015.

Burks was born in 1942 in Gainesboro, Tennessee, and lives in Monterey, Tennessee. She was married to Tommy Burks, a Tennessee State Senator. They had three children together, one of whom is former Putnam County Executive Kim Blaylock. She also has 11 grandchildren.

== Career ==
In 1998, after Burks&#x27; husband was assassinated during an election campaign by his Republican challenger Byron (Low-Tax) Looper, she became a write-in candidate for his seat. Although she did not campaign, family members and friends campaigned extensively on her behalf, and she defeated Looper by a landslide margin, receiving 95% of the vote and becoming the first write-in candidate to win a seat in the Tennessee State Senate. She began her Senate service with the 101st General Assembly.

Burks was reelected in 2002 and 2006 with no substantive opposition. In 2010, when Republicans picked up many seats in the General Assembly, Burks won re-election to a fourth four-year term by a margin of just 183 votes over her Republican opponent, Gary Steakley. Burks carried five of the six counties in the largely rural district, losing only in Cumberland County. An independent candidate placed third in the vote. Steakley challenged the results, claiming irregularities on election day, but a State Senate committee found that there was insufficient evidence to question the outcome.

In the Senate, Burks served as the secretary of the education committee; as a member of the joint study economic development; government operations; select on children and youth; and the environment, conservation, and tourism committees. On September 8, 2013 she announced that she would not run for reelection the following year. On Election Day, the Republican candidate won the seat.

<text>The Neptunalia was an obscure archaic two-day festival in honor of Neptune as god of waters, celebrated at Rome in the heat and drought of summer, probably 23 July (Varro, &quot;De lingua Latina&quot; vi.19). It was one of the &quot;dies comitiales&quot;, when committees of citizens could vote on civil or criminal matters. In the ancient calendar this day is marked as &quot;Nept. ludi et feriae&quot;, or &quot;Nept. ludi&quot;, from which Leonhard Schmitz (in Smith, see link) concluded that the festival was celebrated with games (&quot;ludi&quot;). Respecting the ceremonies of this festival nothing is known, except that the people used to build huts of branches and foliage (&quot;umbrae&quot;, according to Festus, under &quot; Umbrae&quot;), in which they probably feasted, drank, and amused themselves (Horace &quot;Carmina&quot; iii.28.1, &amp;c.; Tertullian &quot;De Spectaculis&quot; (&quot;On Celebrations&quot;) 6).

== In Tunisia ==

Neptunalia is still celebrated in the city of Sousse, Tunisia under the name Carnival of Awussu. The celebration transformed as time unfold and lost all religious connotations.

<text>was a ceremony undergone by apprentice () and some (apprentice geisha) as part of their coming of age ceremony and graduation.

For , who had often already lost their virginity, a patron would pay for the exclusive privilege of being a new &#x27;s first customer; for who underwent , it formed part of a number of ceremonies and occasions used to mark graduation into geishahood, including symbolic changes in hairstyle and official visits to benefactors. Before the outlawing of prostitution in Japan, who underwent would see patrons and benefactors bid large sums of money for the privilege of taking their virginity, a sum of money the (the geisha house an apprentice was affiliated to) would take entirely.

In the present day, a &#x27;s graduation is known as , and is entirely non-sexual, though some older sources – such as the autobiography of Mineko Iwasaki, the geisha that inspired the character Sayuri in the novel &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; by
author Arthur Golden refer to the non-sexual graduation of to geishahood as . , and courtesans as an extension, exist in a wholly non-sexual capacity in modern-day Japan; re-enactment parades are performed by actors, and perform their profession&#x27;s traditional arts without the inclusion of sex work. In both capacities, the of both (who are merely actors in a parade) and (for whom the role is a profession) do not engage in sex work as part of a &#x27;graduation&#x27; out of apprenticeship.

==History==
 has been long connected with the loss of virginity of a , because some did undergo ceremonies to lose their virginity. for a would also include monetary sponsorship by the patron, intended to support and promote the &#x27;s debut to geisha status. Through this sponsorship of the apprentice, a patron would essentially purchase the right to take the &#x27;s virginity. The patron would often have no further relations with the young woman in question.

In the modern day, is a contentious issue, both within the geisha communities of Japan and elsewhere. The practice was outlawed following the introduction of the Anti-Prostitution Law in 1956, categorised under the &quot;traffic in human flesh&quot;. Many geisha who came of age before the passing of the law went through the experience of , and though most geisha had no choice in the patron who took their virginity, with some instances of geisha being sold more than once, the practice of formed an important initiation into womanhood and the role of an independent geisha; according to the research of anthropologist Liza Dalby, though this process was generally not pleasant, for many, it was perceived as a natural stage in growing up, with trainees in the same age cohort who had not graduated viewed by their peers as having been somewhat left behind.

==Post-1956==
Mineko Iwasaki, former high-ranking Gion geisha, detailed her experience of in her autobiography, &quot;Geisha, a Life&quot;. Describing her experience of graduation to geishahood with the term , Iwasaki described her experience as a round of formal visits to announce her graduation, including the presentation of gifts to related geisha houses and important patrons, and a cycle through five different hairstyles before graduating. This set of graduation experiences is generally referred to as in the modern day.

Dalby relays the change between pre- and post-1956 attitudes to within the geisha community through her first-hand accounts with the geisha mothers of Ponto-chō:

All modern and geisha have full control over their personal choices regarding sex, and most begin training, attending banquets, and interacting with customers aged 18 – though they may start living at the as a (maids) for a few years before graduation to and then status.

Though customers attending geisha parties and banquets generally expect some level of convivial and low-key flirtation, a is likely to be considered off-limits as a younger and more vulnerable participant to such gatherings. are instead treated with generosity by guests cognisant of their relative inexperience at geisha parties.

== In literature ==
Arthur Golden&#x27;s novel &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; portrays as a financial arrangement in which a girl&#x27;s virginity is sold to a &quot; patron&quot;, generally someone who particularly enjoys sex with virgin girls, or merely enjoys the charms of an individual .

Former geisha Sayo Masuda describes in her 1957 autobiography &quot;Autobiography of a Geisha&quot; as sexual exploitation. Masuda describes being sold multiple times by her to men, ostensibly for the purposes of taking her virginity, under the pretence that she had not yet lost it. The transaction was explicitly a sexual arrangement, far removed from the ceremony of graduating into geishahood, netting the a large profit. Despite her personal experiences, Masuda argued against the outlawing of sex work in Japan, explaining that it provided a way for women to make an independent living when chosen as a profession, and through criminalisation, would merely be driven underground.

<doc id="848238" wikidata="Q7303184" url="?curid=848238" title="Rectilinear locomotion">
<text>Rectilinear locomotion or rectilinear progression is a mode of locomotion most often associated with snakes. In particular, it is associated with heavy-bodied species such as terrestrial African adders, pythons and boas; however, most snakes are capable of it. It is one of at least five forms of locomotion used by snakes, the others being lateral undulation, sidewinding, concertina movement, and slide-pushing. Unlike all other modes of snake locomotion, which include the snake bending its body, the snake flexes its body only when turning in rectilinear locomotion.

==Biomechanics of rectilinear locomotion==
Rectilinear locomotion relies upon two opposing muscles, the costocutaneous inferior and superior, which are present on every rib and connect the ribs to the skin. Although it was originally believed that the ribs moved in a &quot;walking&quot; pattern during rectilinear movement, studies have shown that the ribs themselves do not move, only the muscles and the skin move to produce forward motion. First, the costocutaneous superior lifts a section of the snake&#x27;s belly from the ground and places it ahead of its former position. Then the costocutaneous inferior pulls backwards while the belly scales are on the ground, propelling the snake forwards. These sections of contact propagate posteriorly, which results in the ventral surface, or belly, moving in discrete sections akin to &quot;steps&quot; while the overall body of the snake moves continuously forward at a relatively constant speed.

== Uses of rectilinear locomotion ==
This method of locomotion is extremely slow (between ), but is also almost noiseless and very hard to detect, making it the mode of choice for many species when stalking prey. It is primarily used when the space being traversed is too constricting to allow for other forms of movement. When climbing, snakes will often use rectilinear locomotion in conjunction with concertina movements to exploit terrain features such as in the surfaces they are climbing.

Rectilinear locomotion may also be useful after snakes eat. Snakes have more difficulty bending their spines after consuming large prey, and rectilinear movement requires less flexing of the spine than other locomotion types.

== In robotics ==
The development of rectilinear movement in robotics is centered around the development of snakelike robots, which have significant advantages over robots with wheeled or bipedal locomotion. The primary advantage in the creation of a serpentine robot is that the robot is often capable of traversing rough, muddy, and complex terrain that is often prohibitive to wheeled robots. Secondly, due to the mechanisms responsible for rectilinear and other forms of serpentine locomotion, the robots tend to have repetitive motor elements, which makes the entire robot relatively robust to mechanical failure.

<text>The United Civic Party (UCP; ; ) is a banned liberal-conservative and liberal political party in Belarus. The party opposes the government of Alexander Lukashenko and has participated in the country&#x27;s elections on a few occasions, but it did not have a single member in the Belarusian parliament until one member was elected during the 2016 elections. It claims that its lack of seats is due to the unfairness of the election process.

Famous party members are former Prime Minister Michaił Čyhir, the mysteriously disappeared politicians Jury Zacharanka and Viktar Hančar, and Hienadź Karpienka, who died prematurely.

==History==
The party was established in 1995 as a result of a merger of two like-minded parties, the &quot;United Democratic Party&quot; (formed in 1990) and the &quot;Civil Party&quot; (formed in 1994). The party&#x27;s chairman is Mikałaj Kazłoŭ; deputy chairmen are Alaksandar Dabravolski and Jarasłaŭ Ramančuk.
At the legislative elections, 13–17 October 2004, the party was part of the People&#x27;s Coalition 5 Plus, which did not secure any seats. According to the OSCE/ODIHR Election Observation Mission, these elections fell significantly short of OSCE commitments. Universal principles and constitutionally guaranteed rights of expression, association and assembly were seriously challenged, calling into question the Belarusian authorities’ willingness to respect the concept of political competition on a basis of equal treatment. According to this mission principles of an inclusive democratic process, whereby citizens have the right to seek political office without discrimination, candidates to present their views without obstruction, and voters to learn about them and discuss them freely, were largely ignored.

In the 2008 elections, the party ran on its own, finishing in third place with 2.33 percent of the official vote and no seats gained. As with most of the opposition parties, the UCP boycotted the 2012 election, urging its supporters to abstain from voting as to not give credence to the process.

For the 2016 elections, the party formed an alliance with the BPF Party, the Belarusian Christian Democracy, the Social Democratic Party (Assembly), the &#x27;Za svabodu&#x27; movement, the Green Party, the BLPFP, the Trade Union of Electric Industry and independent candidates. Party candidate Hanna Kanapackaja won a seat in the 97th electoral district in the Kastryčnickaja district of Minsk, making her and one other independent candidate the first opposition MPs represented in parliament since 2004. The party didn&#x27;t win any seats in the 2019 Belarusian parliamentary election, and with the loss of the other pro-opposition independent, left it and the opposition without any representation within the House of Representatives once again.

On 15 August 2023, the United Civic Party was banned by the Supreme Court of Belarus.

==Structure==
UCP has an organisation for women and a youth organisation in its structure.

In 1995-2000, the youth organisation of the UCP was &quot;Civil Forum&quot;, which left UCP during parliamentary elections of 2000, when the UCP boycotted it against the wishes of Civil Forum. Uładzimier Navasiad, chairman of Civil Forum, ran and won a seat in Parliament.

In 2000, the youth organisation was &quot;UCP Youth&quot;, created to replace Civil Forum, but was rather an artificial structure in the party.

From later that year until 2009, YCSU Young Democrats was officially a youth wing of UCP, but in February 2009 at the congress of YCSU Young Democrats, a decision to stop cooperating with the party was taken. Some members did not support the decision to restrain cooperation with United Civic Party and left, staying as UCP Youth.

<text>Kotex () is an American brand of menstrual hygiene products, which includes the Kotex maxi, thin and ultra-thin pads, the Security tampons, and the Lightdays pantiliners. Most recently, the company has added U by Kotex to its menstrual hygiene product line. Kotex is owned and managed by Kimberly-Clark, a consumer products corporation active in more than 80 countries.

==History==

The modern, commercial, disposable pads started in the late nineteenth century with the company in Germany, and Johnson &amp; Johnson in the United States. In the UK, the Birmingham firm of Southall Brothers &amp; Barclay was advertising &quot;sanitary towels&quot; in &quot;The Family Doctor and Home Medical Adviser&quot; in the early 1890s.

In the United States, Kotex was launched in 1920 by Kimberly-Clark to make use of leftover cellucotton (wood pulp fiber) from World War One bandages. An employee noted that the pads had a &quot;cotton-like texture&quot; which was abbreviated to &quot;cot-tex&quot; and then made the product name with alternate spelling.

In the 1920s, Kimberly-Clark placed advertisements in the women&#x27;s magazines &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; and &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;. Although some readers were offended by the ads, the product&#x27;s success led to more advertisements. Kimberly-Clark also promoted Kotex in &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; by using intimate advice columnist Mary Pauline Callender.

Originally sold in a hospital blue box at 12 for 60 cents, Victorian sexual prudishness caused slow acceptance until Montgomery Ward began advertising them in its 1926 catalog, reaching $11 million sales in 1927 in 57 countries. It became one of the first self-service items in American retailing history after it was strategically placed on countertops with a special payment box so that the woman didn&#x27;t have to ask a clerk for it and touch hands. Tampax appeared in 1936. Belts were needed until the 1970 introduction of Stayfree by Personal Products Co. and New Freedom Pads by Kimberly-Clark.

New Freedom is a former brand in the Kotex family. New Freedom was one of the first beltless pads manufactured in the early 1970s.

==Product line==
In August 2009, Kotex launched a premium sub-brand called Kotex Luxe in Singapore. It launched U by Kotex Tween, products aimed at girls aged 8–12 in the US in 2011.

==Recalls and defects==
In September 2012, Kimberly-Clark issued a warning regarding a shipment of rejected Kotex tampons stolen and sold to the public. The company said the defective products posed only a minor health risk to consumers.

In December 2018, Kimberly-Clark issued a recall of U by Kotex Sleek tampons due to findings that the product would sometimes break apart during removal, leaving behind fragments in the body that could require medical attention for removal.

<doc id="848251" wikidata="Q59759" url="?curid=848251" title="Survivor Series">
<text>Survivor Series, branded as Survivor Series: WarGames since 2022, is a professional wrestling event produced annually since 1987 by WWE, the world&#x27;s largest professional wrestling promotion. Held in November generally the week of Thanksgiving, it is the second longest-running pay-per-view (PPV) event in history, behind WWE&#x27;s flagship event, WrestleMania. In addition to traditional PPV since the inaugural 1987 event, it has aired via livestreaming since the 2014 event. It is also considered one of the company&#x27;s five biggest events of the year, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Money in the Bank, referred to as the &quot;Big Five&quot;.

From 1987 to 2021, the event was characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which were tag team elimination matches that typically featured teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. Stipulations had also been added to these matches, such as members of the losing team being (kayfabe) fired. During these years, only two events did not feature Survivor Series matches: the 1998 event, which hosted an elimination tournament for the vacant WWF Championship (now WWE Championship), and the 2002 event, which saw the debut of the Elimination Chamber, a type of six-person steel cage match won by eliminating all other opponents. Since 2022, the event has been based around WarGames matches for the men and women. WarGames is a team-based steel cage match where the roofless cage surrounds two rings placed side by side and the two teams typically have four to five members each but it is decided by one fall instead of eliminating all opponents. As a result, the events since 2022 have also not featured Survivor Series matches.

After WWE reintroduced the brand extension in 2016, the events from 2016 until 2021 centered around competition between wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brands for brand supremacy; NXT was also involved in 2019. In addition to Survivor Series matches between the brands, the champions of each brand faced off in non-title matches. In 2022, the brand supremacy concept was dropped and the event was rebranded as &quot;Survivor Series: WarGames&quot;, marking WWE&#x27;s first main roster event to feature the match; NXT had its own WarGames event from 2017 to 2021 and it was discontinued after the match was moved to Survivor Series in 2022.

==Origins and changes==

The first Survivor Series, held in 1987, came on the heels of the success of WrestleMania III, as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) began to see the lucrative potential of the pay-per-view (PPV) market. The first event capitalized on the big time feud between André the Giant and Hulk Hogan, who wrestled each other at WrestleMania III. Survivor Series was originally created to counter WCW&#x27;s Starrcade. The first eight Survivor Series events took place on either Thanksgiving Day (1987–1990) or Thanksgiving Eve (1991–1994). Beginning with the 1995 event, Survivor Series was held on various Sundays before Thanksgiving. The 2005 and 2006 events were held on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, while the 2022 and 2023 events were held on the Saturday after Thanksgiving. The 1997 event was notorious as it featured the Montreal Screwjob. Survivor Series was going to be discontinued and rebranded in 2010, but following fan outcry, the company decided to continue with the event. Survivor Series became the second longest running PPV event in history (behind WrestleMania), and is also regarded as one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, the promotion&#x27;s original four annual events and their four biggest events of the year. From 1993 to 2002, it was considered one of the &quot;Big Five&quot;, including King of the Ring, but that PPV event was discontinued after 2002. In August 2021, Money in the Bank became recognized as one of the &quot;Big Five&quot;.

In May 2002, the WWF was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) following a lawsuit with the World Wildlife Fund over the &quot;WWF&quot; initialism. In April 2011, the promotion ceased using its full name with the &quot;WWE&quot; abbreviation becoming an orphaned initialism. Also in March 2002, the promotion introduced the brand extension, in which the roster was divided between the Raw and SmackDown brands where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform—ECW became a third brand in 2006. The first brand extension was dissolved in August 2011, but it was reintroduced in July 2016. Survivor Series, along with the other original &quot;Big Four&quot; events, were the only PPVs to never be held exclusively for one brand during either brand split periods. In 2014, Survivor Series began to air on WWE&#x27;s online streaming service, the WWE Network, which launched in February that year, and in 2021, the event became available on Peacock as the American version of the WWE Network merged under Peacock in March that year.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, WWE had to present the majority of its programming for Raw and SmackDown from a behind closed doors set at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida, beginning mid-March. In August, these events were relocated to WWE&#x27;s bio-secure bubble, the WWE ThunderDome, hosted at Orlando&#x27;s Amway Center. The 2020 Survivor Series was in turn produced from the ThunderDome and was WWE&#x27;s final PPV to present the ThunderDome from the Amway Center, as in early December, the ThunderDome was relocated to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida. In July 2021, WWE resumed live touring with fans.

===Brand competition (2016–2021)===
During the first brand extension period (2002–2011), there were only a few Survivor Series matches that were held between wrestlers of the two brands (e.g., Team Raw vs. Team SmackDown), but it was not the focus of the event. However, with the return of the brand split in 2016, Survivor Series took on the theme of direct competition between the Raw and SmackDown brands for brand supremacy, similar to the former Bragging Rights events held during the first brand split in 2009 and 2010. In addition to traditional Survivor Series matches pitting the men and women from the two brands against each (2016 and 2018 also featured matches with the brands&#x27; tag teams going against each other), there were interpromotional matches that featured the brands&#x27; champions against each other in non-title matches (e.g., the Raw Women&#x27;s Champion vs. the SmackDown Women&#x27;s Champion).

The 2016, 2017, and 2018 events were contested between Raw and SmackDown. The 2016 event was the genesis for what became the theme of brand supremacy that began in 2017. In 2017 and 2018, Raw won the competition with a score of 4–3 and 6–1, respectively (SmackDown&#x27;s one point in 2018 occurred on the Kickoff pre-show). The 2019 event saw the addition of the NXT brand, which previously served as WWE&#x27;s developmental territory but became one of WWE&#x27;s three main brands in 2019, and in turn featured the first three-way Survivor Series elimination matches for men and women. NXT subsequently won that year&#x27;s competition with a 4–2–1 victory, with SmackDown having 2 points, and Raw&#x27;s sole win occurring on the pre-show. NXT would not compete at the 2020 event due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Outbreaks of the virus had occurred at both of NXT&#x27;s home arenas, Full Sail University and the WWE Performance Center, prompting WWE to exclude NXT wrestlers from the event to avoid potential transmission of the virus to members of the Raw and SmackDown rosters. Raw would win that year&#x27;s competition with a 4–3 victory over SmackDown. The 2021 event also did not include NXT as the brand reverted to its status as WWE&#x27;s developmental territory in September of that year. At the 2021 event, Raw again won the competition with a 5–2 victory over SmackDown.

===WarGames (2022–present)===
On September 19, 2022, WWE executive Triple H announced that the 2022 Survivor Series would not be based on the brand supremacy concept. Additionally, he announced that the event would feature two WarGames matches, one each for the men and women, marking the first time for a main roster WWE event to feature the match. The 2022 event was in turn renamed as Survivor Series: WarGames, and it was also the first Survivor Series held on a Saturday. The NXT brand previously held an annual WarGames event from 2017 to 2021. With the WarGames match moving to the main roster for Survivor Series, this subsequently ended NXT&#x27;s WarGames event, which was replaced by Deadline.

In an interview with &quot;The Ringer&quot; in regards to WarGames at Survivor Series, Triple H said:

During the Survivor Series: WarGames post-event press conference, Triple H was asked if the WarGames match would become a permanent fixture at Survivor Series and he said &quot;we&#x27;ll see&quot;, citing the success of the 2022 event. In regards to the event not including a traditional Survivor Series match, he was asked if the match was done for good and he said they &quot;weren&#x27;t done with anything&quot;, noting that this year was the time to freshen up the event but the traditional match could see a return at future events. Triple H also revealed that the 2022 event was the highest-grossing Survivor Series of all time as well as the most viewed. The 2023 and 2024 events would also retain the WarGames concept.

==Survivor Series match==
From 1987 to 2021, the event was traditionally characterized by having the Survivor Series match, a type of tag team elimination match that typically featured two teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. In a Survivor Series match, each member of a team had to be eliminated to win. The name of the match stemmed from this stipulation, as the winners were the &quot;survivors&quot;, and in some cases, there was only one survivor. On occasion, there were additional stipulation placed on the Survivor Series match, such as members of the losing team being (kayfabe) fired. While typically contested between two teams, the 2019 event had three teams against each other in three-way Survivor Series matches.

The promotion had several tag team elimination matches earlier in 1987, albeit with three-man teams and the feuds loosely related. In an early break from the norm, the 1992 event had only one Survivor Series match. As of 2024, five Survivor Series events have not featured any Survivor Series matches. The 1998 event, which was the first without any Survivor Series matches, instead focused on an elimination tournament for the vacant WWF Championship (now WWE Championship). The 2002 event was the second event to not include any Survivor Series matches. Instead, it had an elimination tables match and a triple threat elimination tag team match (in which only one member of a team had to be eliminated to eliminate the whole team), but most notably, the event saw the debut of the Elimination Chamber, a type of six-person steel cage match where each opponent had to be eliminated to win.

The 2022, 2023, and 2024 events are the most recent to not include any Survivor Series matches, or any type of elimination stipulations, as they instead featured two WarGames matches, one each for the men and women, with the 2022 event also notable for being WWE&#x27;s first main roster event to feature the WarGames match. WarGames is a team-based steel cage match where the roofless cage surrounds two rings placed side by side and the two teams typically feature four to five wrestlers each but it is decided by one fall instead of eliminating all opponents.

<doc id="848252" wikidata="Q728405" url="?curid=848252" title="Georges Eekhoud">
<text>Georges Eekhoud (27 May 1854 – 29 May 1927) was a Belgian novelist of Flemish descent, but writing in French.

Eekhoud was a regionalist best known for his ability to represent scenes from rural and urban daily life. He tended to portray the dark side of human desire and write about social outcasts and the working classes.

==Early life and works==
Eekhoud was born in Antwerp. A member of a fairly well-off family, he lost his parents as a young boy. When he came into his own he started working for a journal. First as a corrector, later he contributed a serial. In 1877, the generosity of his grandmother permitted young Eekhoud to publish his first two books, &quot;Myrtes et Cyprès&quot; and &quot;Zigzags poétiques&quot;, both volumes of poetry. In the beginning of the 1880s Eekhoud took part in several of the modern French-Belgian artist movements, like &quot;Les XX&quot; (The Twenty) and &quot;La Jeune Belgique&quot; (Young Belgium). &quot;Kees Doorik&quot;, his first novel was published in 1883, about the wild life of a tough young farmhand who committed a murder. The renowned free-thinking publisher Henri Kistemaeckers brought out a second edition three years later. Eekhoud received some guarded praise by famous authors like Edmond de Goncourt and Joris-Karl Huysmans who both sent Eekhoud a personal letter. For his second prose book, &quot;Kermesses&quot; (Fairs, 1884), not only Goncourt and Huysmans praised him, but also Émile Zola, about whom Eekhoud had written an essay in 1879.

In 1886 his novel &quot;Les milices de Saint-François&quot; (The Soldiers of Saint Francis Xavier) was published. By now Eekhoud&#x27;s established subject was the rural Campine, a poor farmers&#x27; district east of Antwerp. He had a distinct style permeated with enthusiasm for the roguish young farm labourers and their rough-and-tumble lives. His most famous novel, &quot;La nouvelle Carthage&quot; (The New Carthage) was published in its definitive form in 1893, and many times reprinted. It has also been translated in English, German, Dutch, Russian, Romanian and Czech. The rustic Campine was in this book replaced with the brutal life of love and death in the Antwerp dockland metropolis and its dirty industry.

Eekhoud published two volumes of short stories:  &quot;Cycle patibulaire&quot; in 1892 (Brussels, Kistemaeckers), reedited in 1896 as &quot;Le Cycle patibulaire&quot; (Paris, Mercure de France) and in 1895 &quot;Mes communions&quot; (Brussels, Kistemaeckers), reedited in 1897 (Paris, Mercure de France). Many of these stories contain brazen love stories between men, and Eekhoud even defended Oscar Wilde in &quot;Le Tribunal au chauffoir&quot;, first published in the literary periodical &quot;L’Art Jeune&quot; in September 1895, just a few months after Wilde&#x27;s conviction, and then in the 1896 edition of &quot;Le Cycle patibulaire.&quot;

==Escal-Vigor==
In 1899 Eekhoud offered to his readers a new and daring novel, &quot;Escal-Vigor&quot;. This is the name of the castle of its protagonist, count Henry de Kehlmark, but it conveys the name &#x27;Escaut&#x27;, French for the river Scheldt, and &#x27;Vigor&#x27;, Latin for Power. Many of these readers were shocked, because the book is concerned with love between men. According to Eekhoud&#x27;s biographer Mirande Lucien, &quot;Escal-Vigor&quot; was the book of a man who wanted to speak about himself in all freedom. &quot;Escal-Vigor&quot; is a homogeneous, linear text. The story goes without detours to its final scene of the martyrdom, the moment that the tortured bodies testify of the justness of their cause. As for its composition, &quot;Escal-Vigor&quot; is the least decadent of Eekhoud&#x27;s works. Eekhoud makes much less use of the elaborate and old-fashioned words that make the reader stop and wonder.

A clear and resolute novel about homosexuality, &quot;Escal-Vigor&quot; was heading towards trouble. Although it was well received by most critics, like Rachilde and Eugène Demolder, a lawsuit was launched against it. However, a storm of protest, especially vociferous because of numerous literary celebrities, and a cunning lawyer with literary aspirations, Edmond Picard, did their part in acquitting Eekhoud.

&quot;Excal-Vigor&quot; was translated and published in English in 1909 under the title &quot;&quot;, with a militant foreword, probably written by Eekhoud himself, or by his publisher Charles Carrington. This translation is subsequently published in the US under the title &quot;A Strange Love. A Novel of abnormal passion&quot; by Panurge Press in 1930 and in 1965 by Guild Press under the title &quot;A Strange Love. Escal-Vigor.&quot;

==Eekhoud&#x27;s later years==
Later novels and stories, like his 1904 novel &quot;L’Autre vue&quot;, (Paris, Mercure de France) reedited in 1926 under the title &quot;Voyous de velours ou L&#x27;autre vue&quot; (Brussels, Renaissance du Livre) and &quot;Les Libertins d&#x27;Anvers&quot; ( Antwerp libertines, 1912) also contain notions of queer love or sometimes only hints of admiration for masculinity, e.g. &quot;Dernières Kermesses&quot; (1920). Eekhoud corresponded with Jacques d&#x27;Adelswärd-Fersen and contributed to his sumptuous literary monthly &quot;Akademos&quot; (1909). He also befriended and influenced young Jacob Israël de Haan, who authored several poems on themes of his older Belgian colleague, especially &quot;La Nouvelle Carthage&quot; and &quot;Les Libertines d&#x27;Anvers&quot;. Eekhoud for his part wrote the preface of De Haan&#x27;s sadomasochist novel &quot;Pathologieën&quot; (Pathologies, 1908). The two authors kept in contact by letter.

Eekhoud continued to be a well-respected author until he put on a firmly pacifistic stance in World War I that ravaged Belgium, after which his star declined. In the twenties his books started to be reprinted again, although he died in 1927 at Schaerbeek.

Eekhoud left a voluminous diary (1895–1927) of some 5000 pages, that has been bought by the Royal Library of Brussels in 1982. Various Belgian libraries contain extensive collections of correspondence.

==Modern interest==
Nowadays, especially the queer aspect of his works has enjoyed attention. &quot;Escal-Vigor&quot; has been reprinted in 1982, and Eekhoud&#x27;s love letters to the journalist Sander Pierron were edited by Mirande Lucien and published in 1993 under the title &quot;Mon bien aimé petit Sander&quot;. Mirande Lucien also published a biography of Georges Eekhoud: &quot;Eekhoud le rauque&quot; (1999).

<text>A crescograph is a device for measuring growth in plants. It was invented in the early 20th century by Jagadish Chandra Bose.

The Bose crescograph uses a series of clockwork gears and a smoked glass plate to record the movement of the tip of a plant (or its roots). It was able to record at magnifications of up to 10,000 times through the use of two different levers. One lever records at 100 times magnification while the other lever takes that image and records at another 100 times magnification. Marks are made on the plate at intervals of a few seconds, demonstrating how the rate of growth varies under varying stimuli. Bose experimented with temperature, chemicals, gases, and electricity.

The electronic crescograph plant movement detector is capable of measurements as small as 1/1,000,000 of an inch. However, its normal operating range is from 1/1000 to 1/10,000 of an inch. The component which actually measures the movement is a differential transformer along with a movable core hinged between two points. A micrometer is used to adjust and calibrate the system. It can record plant growth, magnifying a small movement as much as 10,000,000 times. This machine is highly sensitive; Bose padded the legs of the table on which the Crescograph is being used with India-rubber sponges. This negated any vibration which could affect results.

<text>The Bloch MB.150 (later MB.151 to MB.157) was a French fighter aircraft developed and produced by &quot;Société des Avions Marcel Bloch&quot;. It featured an all-metal construction, complete with a retractable undercarriage, low cantilever wing and a fully enclosed cockpit.

The MB.150 was originally developed to conform with the requirements of the 1934 French Air Ministry competition seeking a new fighter design. Despite the competition being won by the competing Morane-Saulnier M.S.406, it was decided to proceed with development. Initially proving unable to attain flight, the modified prototype conducted its maiden flight in October 1937. Service trials of the MB.150 determined the aircraft to hold sufficient promise to warrant further work, leading to the adoption of an expanded and strengthened wing and a more refined Gnome-Rhone 14N-7 engine. During spring 1938, following the completion of further proving trials, an order for a pre-production batch of 25 aircraft was placed.

Redesigns of the MB.150 design led to the improved MB.151 and MB.152 which entered squadron service with the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot;. By the outbreak of the Second World War, around 120 aircraft had been delivered to the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; but most were not sufficiently equipped to be considered operational. An improved MB.155 had greater range. Ordered into production in 1940, only ten aircraft had been completed by the Fall of France. The MB.157, a further improved model with a heavier and more powerful engine, was completed during the Vichy era. Though it demonstrated promising performance, it did not enter production.

==Development==
===Origins===
On 13 July 1934, the &quot;Service Technique Aéronautique&quot; (Aeronautical Technical Service) of the French Air Force issued the &quot;C1 design&quot; requirement for a new and completely modern single-seat interceptor fighter. Envisioned to make use of a monoplane layout and a retractable undercarriage, the prospective fighter aircraft was to serve as a replacement for the French Air Force&#x27;s existing inventory of Dewoitine D.371, Dewoitine D.500, and Loire 46 aircraft. Amongst the various aviation companies who took interest in the specification, to which the potential for a large production order was attached, was French aircraft manufacturer Société des Avions Marcel Bloch.

The design team, headed by Maurice Roussel, was assembled at Bloch&#x27;s Courbevoie facility in Paris. They designed an all-metal stressed skin monoplane, powered by a single 930 hp Gnome-Rhône 14Kfs radial engine and armed with a pair of wing-mounted Hispano-Suiza-built HS.404 cannon. During September 1935, construction of the type&#x27;s first prototype, designated as the &quot;Bloch 150-01&quot;, commenced.

Although the C.1 competition was ultimately won by a rival design, the Morane-Saulnier M.S.406, it was decided to independently continue with the design&#x27;s development. During 1936, these efforts culminated in the first attempted flight of the &quot;MB.150.01&quot; prototype; unfortunately, the aircraft proved unable to leave the ground during the attempt. In the ensuing disappointment work on the design was temporarily halted, but development was resumed during early 1937. Following the implementation of various modifications, consisting of a strengthened wing of greater area, revised undercarriage arrangement and the installation of a Gnome-Rhone 14N-0 radial engine with a three-blade constant speed propeller, on 29 September 1937, the MB.150 finally conducted its maiden flight.

Months later, the MB.150.01 was handed over to the &quot;Centre d&#x27;Essais du Materiel Aerien&quot; (CEMA) for service trials; during one such official test flight in December 1937, a maximum recorded speed of 434 km/h (269 mph) was attained. As a result of the CEMA flights, the prototype&#x27;s performance proved to be sufficiently interesting as to warrant further development. This brought, at the beginning of 1938, a small increase in the aircraft&#x27;s wing span, the replacement of the twin wing-mounted radiators by a single unit installed between the wheel wells, and the installation of an improved 14N-7 engine, which led to the prototype being re-designated as the &quot;MB.150.01M&quot; (&quot;M&quot; standing for &quot;modified&quot;). During spring 1938, further trials of the modified aircraft were performed by CEMA.

By this point, wider circumstances within France, such as the declining diplomatic situation between the European powers and the enactment of several urgent re-equipment programmes for the French Air Force, proved favourable for the MB.150. Specifically, on 15 March 1938, one such programme, referred to as &quot;Plan V&quot;, was adopted, calling for the near-unrealistic delivery of 940 modern fighter aircraft to the Air Force within the space of a year. Even the most optimistic projections saw 285 M.S.406 fighters delivered; while the MB.150 was deemed to have not yet completed development, it was decided to include the type within the production.

Accordingly, on 7 April 1938, upon the completion of trials in late spring 1938, the newly formed manufacturing consortium SNCASO received an initial order for a pre-production batch of 25 aircraft which, upon successful completion of the MB.150&#x27;s development programme, was followed by the confirmation of a sizable order for 450 aircraft. Initially, 300 aircraft were to be delivered to the French Air Force by 1 April 1939; this was later cut down to 206 aircraft. In reality, only a single aircraft had been delivered by the prescribed deadline; other aircraft types also proved similarly unable to attain the tight delivery dates.

===Further development===
However, there was no direct production of the &quot;MB-150.01&quot; as the aircraft having been deemed to be unsuitable for mass production. Amongst other changes needed, the structure of the airframe had to be redesigned in order to suit mass production. During early April 1938, an order was received for a three further prototypes; these were to explore the possibilities for installing more powerful engines of both French and American origins, such as the Hispano-Suiza 14AA, Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp, and further derivatives of the Gnome-Rhône 14N engine. Accordingly, this design effort led to the production of the &quot;MB.151.01&quot; and &quot;MB.152.01&quot; prototypes, which were developed and produced in parallel.

The first pre-production prototype, the MB.151.01, was quickly assembled at Courbevoie using the new simplified construction methods developed. This aircraft, which was fully armed, performed its first flight at Villacoublay Airfield, Île-de-France, on 18 August 1938. According to Christesco, the performance of the MB.151.01 was initially disappointing, leading to efforts to rectify performance issues. Development, and thus mass production, was delayed by the overheating of the engine (resulting in oil cooler types being tested and the most efficient of these adopted) and the aircraft being poorly balanced on its pitch axis at high speeds; neither the prototype nor the production MB.151 were able to attain 480 km/h, the design&#x27;s estimated maximum speed.

According to Christesco, the MB.152.01 was &quot;the first true aircraft&quot; of the series. This model was equipped with a more powerful 1,030 hp Gnome-Rhône 14N-21 engine, capable of a speed of 520 km/h and equipped with a revised armament arrangement. On 15 December 1938, the MB.152.01 prototype performed its maiden flight. During January 1939, it was refitted with a more production-representative 1,000 hp Gnome-Rhône 14N-25 engine; various alternative engine cowlings and propellers were also tested to address engine overheating. To prevent further delays to the production aircraft, a large cowling was adopted, which increased drag and reduced the MB.152&#x27;s flight performance.

The manufacturing of the fighter was divided amongst the various branches comprising SNCASO. Aside from a handful that were assembled at Courbevoie early on, roughly half of all aircraft produced were manufactured at Châteauroux, Berry while the other half were built at Bordeaux–Merignac, Nouvelle-Aquitaine. From January 1940 onwards, production was centered at Châteauroux alone. During December 1938, the first of the pre-production aircraft were completed; on 7 March 1939, the first production fighter was delivered to the French Air Force. By mid-May 1939, only 22 aircraft, a combination of MB.151s and MB.152s, had been dispatched; of these, only 10 had been accepted by the Air Force.

The &quot;MB.153&quot; and &quot;MB.154&quot; were intended as testbeds for American engines but only the MB.153 flew and when it crashed a few days later as damaged beyond repair, pursuit of these alternatives also ceased. Attention shifted to extending the range of the MB.152 by moving the cockpit aft to make room for a new fuel tank; other modifications included a slightly broader wing and revised aerodynamics around the cowling. The resulting &quot;MB.155&quot;, performed favourably in flight tests and was ordered into production in 1940 but only 10 aircraft had been completed by the Fall of France. Under the terms of the armistice, the remaining 25 on the production line were completed and delivered into Vichy service. From there, some eventually made their way into the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; after 1942.

The final member of the family, the &quot;MB.157&quot; had a far more powerful engine and eventually became a very different aircraft as the design evolved from the MB.152 to accommodate the larger and heavier 1,590 hp Gnome-Rhône 14R-4 motor. Unfinished at the time of the armistice, it was ordered to be completed and flown under German supervision. Demonstrating superb performance, it was taken to Orly where the power plant was removed for testing within a wind tunnel. The excellence in the design was confirmed by Germans when they completed and tested it in 1942, reaching up to flat speed. It was later destroyed in an Allied air raid.

==Operational history==

Upon evaluation, early deliveries were deemed unsuitable for combat operations, principally due to issues with the tailplane; thus, plans were laid for the first 157 production fighters to be stored awaiting modification, while additional production examples were built with the correction made. Furthermore, the type was initially confined to performing training duties alone; prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, only a single squadron, allocated to the 1st Escadre de Chasse, received the type. Upon the eve of the conflict, around 249 aircraft had been manufactured; of these, roughly 123 aircraft had been accepted by the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot;. However, few of these were considered to be flyable, the majority missing their gunsights and propellers.

On 26 September 1939, the first modified MB.152s were delivered to the French Air Force; the first of these fighters were allocated to active squadrons by early October and, by mid-November 1939, two separate &quot;Groupes de Chasse (fighter groups)&quot; had been equipped with 26 MB.152s each. At this point, the type still demonstrated some unfavourable flight characteristics, such as during steep dives. Meanwhile, increasing numbers of MB.151 aircraft were being delivered to be squadrons for training purposes in advance of their anticipated conversion to the MB.152. During the initial stage of the conflict, known as the Phoney War, very few engagements between the MB.152 and the aircraft of the Luftwaffe occurred; in this period, only a single kill of a Junkers Ju 88 was recorded.

During the Battle of France, a mixture of MB.151s and MB.152s equipped nine Groupes de Chasse; the MB.152 was the most numerous aircraft remaining in service during the final weeks prior to the signing of the Armistice of 22 June 1940. They proved to be tough aircraft, able to withstand considerable battle damage, rapidly reach high speeds during a dive, and functioned well as a gunnery platform. In air combat they were outmatched by the Messerschmitt Bf 109E on almost every count and proved slower than the twin-engined Messerschmitt Bf 110. All Bloch units suffered heavy losses. In the week of heavy air fighting between 10 and 17 May, it was almost commonplace for a Bloch squadron to take off with eight or nine aircraft and come back with only two or three. On their side, the pilots of Bloch MB.152s claimed at least 188 enemy aircraft, for the loss of about 86 Blochs. In the third week in May the Bloch units had suffered severe losses and were pulled back to the Paris area to reform.

In comparison with its French contemporaries, according to aviation author Michel Cristesco: &quot;the MB.152 was the least successful in combat and the one that suffered the heaviest losses&quot;. The type had numerous shortcomings; these problems included lack of manoeuvrability, unreliable guns, a relatively low range ( compared to 660 km for the Bf 109E) and being considerably underpowered. Writing of its faults, Cristesco attributed two major points for its performance shortcomings; its inadequate manoeuvrability and its range.

Following the Armistice, six groups continued to fly in the Vichy French Air Force until this was disbanded on 1 December 1942, the aircraft being passed over to the Royal Romanian Air Force by the Germans. By April 1941, the German Armistice Commission had agreed with a proposal to standardise the Vichy Air Force onto the Dewoitine D.520, resulting in all other single-engine fighters being phased out. The Germans seized around 173 fighters, 83 of which being reportedly serviceable, which were pressed into service with the Luftwaffe. Chrisesco alleged that around 95 MB.152s were secretly modified during late 1941 – early 1942 with a rear-fuselage fuel tank, giving them the range to cross the Mediterranean Sea to freedom.

Though the Greek government had ordered 25 MB.151s, only nine of these were actually exported to Greece by the time of the Armistice being signed. Those that were delivered were still in the process of working up when the Greco-Italian War broke out, leading to the wider Balkan Campaign between the major European fighters. The MB.151 fighters flew with the 24th Moira Dioxis (Fighter Squadron) of the Hellenic Royal Air Force, stationed at Elefsina against the Italians and Germans, scoring several air-to-air victories until 19 April 1941, when the last of Greece&#x27;s MB.151s was shot down. At one stage, the Bulgarian government was in the process of negotiating the acquisition of MB.152 fighters with the Vichy government. During February 1943, a contract for delivery of 20 aircraft was signed, but this was vetoed by the German authorities, which by now had a controlling say within Vichy French politics. Instead, Bulgaria later received a series of Dewoitine D.520s to meet their needs.

<text>The Enciclopedia universal ilustrada europeo-americana (also called Enciclopedia Espasa, or Enciclopedia Espasa-Calpe, after its publisher, founded by José Espasa Anguera) is a Spanish encyclopedia. It comprises 72 volumes (numbered from 1 to 70, with parts 18 and 28 consisting of two volumes each) published from 1908 to 1930 plus a ten-volume appendix published 1930–33. Between 1935 and 2003, 33 supplemental volumes were published plus an index, another A–Z appendix, and an atlas, for a total of 118 volumes. Each of the volumes vary in length. As of 1986, it is the longest printed encyclopedia with 105,000 pages and 165,200,000 words.

&quot;Encyclopaedias: Their History Throughout The Ages&quot; regards the &quot;Espasa&quot; as one of the greatest encyclopedias, along with the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition&quot; and the &quot;Enciclopedia Italiana&quot; (p. 147). &quot;This work is remarkable for its detail: maps and plans of even remote and obscure places; reproductions and descriptions of works of art entered under their titles; lengthy bibliographies, international in scope; full dictionary treatment of individual words with, in many cases, foreign equivalents; and usually affording full scope to lengthy treatment of important subjects.&quot; (201) The authors of the work, as an example of its scope, mentioned in the preface (vii) that all botanical genera known at the time were covered in the work. Common words (not proper names) are translated into English, French, German, Esperanto and other languages.

The aim of the publishers was to produce an encyclopedia reference book in Spanish that covered scientific and technological knowledge as well as history, biographies, geography, arts, and the literature of Spain and Latin America.

According to calculations made by its publishers, the encyclopaedia has more than 165,000 pages and 200 million words. The 82-volume version is also estimated to have over 1,000,000 articles (Kister 450).

Only minor revisions have been made to the original volumes, such as the rewrite of a part of the 1910 &quot;bicicleta&quot; (bicycle) article which had enumerated a &quot;pistol or revolver&quot; as one of the things to be taken on a bicycle tour.

In 2003 a repackaged version was published in 90 volumes, consisting of the original 82 volumes plus a new 8-volume &quot;Complemento Enciclopédico 1934–2002&quot; update. The old supplements will not be republished.

<text>The Party for Freedom and Progress (; ; ; PVV-PLP) was a liberal political party in Belgium which existed from 1961 until 1992. The party was the successor of the Liberal Party, which had roots dating back to 1846. It was succeeded in the Flemish Community of Belgium by the Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD) and in the French Community by the Liberal Reformist Party, &quot;Parti des Réformes et des Libertés de Wallonie&quot; and the current-day Reformist Movement. In the German-speaking Community, it continued to exist as the Party for Freedom and Progress up to 2023.

== History ==
=== Foundation of a new party===

In 1961, Omer Vanaudenhove, leader of the Liberal Party, reorganised it into the Partij voor Vrijheid en Vooruitgang/Parti de la Liberté et du Progrès (PVV/PLP). The new party, among other things, jettisoned the Liberals&#x27; traditional anti-clericalism. In 1965, the party obtained a victory in the general elections with 21.6% of the votes. In 1966, the PVV joined the government of Paul Vanden Boeynants. The liberal ministers during this period were Willy De Clercq, Jacques Van Offelen, Frans Grootjans, Herman Vanderpoorten, Charles Poswick and August De Winter.

=== Separation between PVV and PRL ===

On 27 June 1971, the party was split up in a Flemish (PVV) and Walloon party (the Liberal Reformist Party, PRL). Only a few months later, on 24 September 1971, the parliament was dissolved. In the elections which followed The Flemish PVV gained votes, but the Walloon PRL lost in the elections.

In this period (1971–1992), the PVV ministers in the government were: Willy De Clercq, Herman Vanderpoorten, Herman De Croo, Karel Poma, Alfred Vreven, André Kempinaire, Guy Verhofstadt, Louis Waltniel, Jean Pede, Patrick Dewael, Ward Beysen, and Jacky Buchmann.

The PRL ministers in the government were: André Damseaux, François-Xavier de Donnea, Jean Gol, Louis Olivier, Charles Poswick, and Michel Toussaint.

=== Flanders: VLD ===

In Flanders, the PVV ceased to exist in 1992. On 15 November 1992, the Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD) was founded.

=== French-speaking Community: MR ===

In 1976, the name of the party was changed into Parti des Réformes et des Libertés de Wallonie|Parti de Réformes et de la Liberté en Wallonie (PRLW). In 1979, the name was changed to Liberal Reformist Party (PRL) after the merger with the Liberal Party of Brussels. In March 2002, the PRL merged with the German-speaking Party for Freedom and Progress (PFF) of the East Cantons, the Democratic Front of Francophones (FDF) and the Citizens&#x27; Movement for Change (MCC) into the Reformist Movement (MR).

<text>Yves Michaud (; February 13, 1930 – March 19, 2024) was a Canadian politician in Quebec who was a sovereigntist and &quot;pur et dur&quot; supporter of the Parti Québécois.

==Background==
Yves Michaud was born in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, Canada on February 13, 1930. In 1959, he received a Canada Council grant to study journalism in France at the Université de Strasbourg. He then began a career as a journalist for the &quot;Clairon&quot; in Saint-Hyacinthe. He was later chief editor of &quot;La Patrie&quot; and also had a chronicle for the magazine &quot;7 jours&quot;.

Michaud died in Montreal on March 19, 2024, at the age of 94. No official cause of death was given, but it was reported in 2022 that he had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==Member of the legislature==
Michaud joined the ranks of the Liberal Party of Quebec and was elected in the Gouin riding in the 1966 provincial election, which the Liberals lost. He became friends with fellow Liberals René Lévesque and Robert Bourassa, who would both later become Premiers of Quebec.

In 1969, Michaud left the Liberal Party and sat as an Independent to protest against the passage of &quot;Bill 63&quot;, a controversial language legislation. He ran for re-election as a Liberal candidate in the 1970 election, but was defeated by 12 votes by Parti Québécois candidate Guy Joron.

==Parti Québécois supporter==
Michaud joined the Parti Québécois in the subsequent years and ran as a candidate of this party in the district of Bourassa in the 1973 Quebec general election. He lost against Liberal candidate Lise Bacon.

Michaud then founded &quot;Le Jour&quot;, the first daily newspaper promoting Quebec independence. In 1979, he was in charge of the Quebec Government House of Paris.

Michaud called the English language a scar and disfigurement on the face of Montreal. He also described the language situation in Quebec as a cancer that occasionally goes into remission.

==Robin Hood of the banks==
Often called &quot;Robin des banques&quot; (Robin Hood of the banks), Yves Michaud is known by the people of Quebec for his crusade against the practices of large corporations. In 1993, he founded the &quot;Association des petits épargnants et investisseurs du Québec&quot; (Association of small savers and investors), and won a number of victories in court.

==The Michaud Affair==

In December 2000 Yves Michaud announced that he would seek the Parti Québécois nomination for a by-election in the district of Mercier. However, his candidacy was plagued with controversy, after he made sensitive comments about the Jewish community in a radio interview.

One recollection of his comments, amongst other things, was that he stated that the Jewish people had suffered, but that other peoples had also endured great tragedies. (&quot;The Jews weren&#x27;t the only people to have suffered.&quot;) However, as the affair went along, due notably to Michaud&#x27;s open defence of Quebecker nationalism, he was increasingly portrayed by some as an anti-semite and denier of the Shoah, which he always categorically said he was not.

It culminated in a motion of censure from the National Assembly of Quebec. Lucien Bouchard is also said to have been influenced by the weight of the affair (which received extremely negative coverage in the international press) to resign as Premier of Quebec in 2001 (although he did not admit it). Michaud fought to the end for recognition of the motion of censure as an &quot;anti-democratic mistake&quot;.

Also, Bouchard announced that he would block Michaud&#x27;s candidacy. Claudel Toussaint received the nomination. Michaud&#x27;s faction ran its own candidate: Paul Cliche. Both sovereigntist candidates lost the by-election against Liberal nominee Nathalie Rochefort.

<text>The Saab 105 is a Swedish high-wing, twinjet trainer aircraft developed in the early 1960s as a private venture by Saab AB. The Swedish Air Force, which had opted to procure the type for various roles, designated the aircraft SK 60. The SK 60 entered service in 1967, replacing the ageing De Havilland Vampire fleet.

The Swedish Air Force bought 150 aircraft and another 40 were exported to Austria, designated Saab 105Ö. The Saab 105 was the aircraft used by Swedish Air Force display team Team 60 and was formerly used by two display teams of the Austrian Air Force, &quot;Karo As&quot; and &quot;Silver Birds&quot;.

==Development==
In 1959, development of the Saab 105 was initiated by Saab. The company decided to develop the aircraft as a private venture and intended for it to serve in a wide variety of military and civil capacities. In a military capacity, the 105 can be operated as a jet trainer, conduct aerial reconnaissance and ground attack, and in a limited interceptor capability. Among the diverse roles planned for the aircraft, Saab proposed a four-to-five seat business jet cabin configuration which was intended for corporate customers.

At the time, the 105 was one of the only small European aircraft to be equipped with turbofan, which was reported as of interest to prospective business customers. The 105 was intended to launch Saab into the business jet market. Ultimately no such customers emerged for the type and thus Saab elected to focus its interest upon military customers instead.

Early on, the Swedish Air Force had formed a commitment with Saab that, contingent upon satisfactory performance of the prototype during flight testing, an order for at least 100 aircraft would be placed. In December 1961, the Swedish Government authorized the Swedish Air Force to sponsor the development and manufacture of a single prototype Saab 105 in a training configuration. On 29 June 1963, this first prototype conducted its maiden flight. The flight test program soon revealed the type&#x27;s good handling qualities and capability of performing aerobatic maneuvers. In March 1965, a single prototype was dispatched to Turbomeca&#x27;s facilities in Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, Aquitaine, France, for further flight testing of its Turbomeca Aubisque powerplant.

On 6 March 1965, the Swedish Air Force received authorisation from the Swedish Government to place an order for an initial quantity of 130 Saab 105 aircraft. The Swedish aircraft were divided into three principal variants, these being the &quot;SK 60A&quot; for training and liaison duties using a four-seat configuration, the &quot;SK 60B&quot; for light attack missions in a twin side-by-side seating configuration, and the &quot;SK 60C&quot; dual-role attack and reconnaissance aircraft, for the latter role equipped with various cameras in the aircraft&#x27;s nose.

An improved version, designated as the Saab 105Ö, was procured by Austria as a lightweight multi-role aircraft, with the intention to deploy them in trainer, reconnaissance, interception and ground attack roles. To meet the requirements specified by the Austrian Air Force, the 105Ö features several key differences, which includes some avionics changes, the adoption of a strengthened wing for carrying greater quantities of munitions and equipment upon the underwing hardpoints, and a more powerful version of the Turbomeca Aubisque powerplant, providing superior performance when operated from air bases at high altitude.

==Design==
The Saab 105 was developed to function as a small and inexpensive multirole aircraft, which has been most typically used in a training capacity. It is an all-metal twin-jet aircraft with a pressurized cabin. It features a T-tail configuration, modestly swept wings, and a pair of engines mounted on either side of the fuselage just underneath the wing.

The 105 can be outfitted with various armaments and equipment to perform a wide range of duties, mostly installed upon the aircraft&#x27;s six underwing hardpoints. In a ground-attack/close air support capacity, the 105 can employ a combination of 135 mm, 127 mm, and 75 mm unguided rockets, air-to-ground missiles and assorted bombs, including napalm bombs. A pair of 30 mm cannon or 7.62 mm guns may be installed via gun pods.

In the air defense role, AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles can be employed in addition to the cannons. For the purpose of carrying a maximum of two passengers, smaller ejector seats can be installed for the pilot and co-pilot, while a small bench directly behind them can be used by passengers. Generic and more specialized surveillance/reconnaissance missions can be performed by the Saab 105, having the option of being fitted with radiation detection equipment for atmospheric sampling. With suitable equipment, the 105 could be readily converted between trainer and light attack roles.

As built, the Saab 105 was typically powered by a pair of Turbomeca Aubisque low-bypass turbofan engines, licence-manufactured by Volvo Flygmotor as the &quot;RM9&quot;. The Aubisque engine reportedly provided favourable engine-out characteristics, allowing the aircraft to successfully takeoff in the event of a single engine failing at the critical point. This has not been the sole powerplant for the type, as a number of 105 aircraft have been powered by the General Electric J85 engine instead. Swedish Air Force aircraft were remanufactured during the 1990s to use the newer Williams International FJ44, which was designated as the &quot;RM15&quot;.

==Operational history==


In July 1967, the first Swedish Air Force student pilots started training on the Saab 105. In July 1970, Austrian Air Force pilot training activities on the type began. In August 2010, 22 of Austria&#x27;s Saab 105 aircraft remained operational, attaining a combined total flight time of roughly 1,500 flying hours per year.

During the 1990s, by which point the existing engines of the Swedish Air Force&#x27;s SK 60 fleet were considered to be towards the end of their technical and economic lifespan, it was decided to replace the Turbomeca Aubisque engines with newly built Williams International FJ44 engines, which are lighter and less costly to operate. In November 1993, a contract was signed for the re-engining of 115 aircraft. The number of aircraft to be upgraded was subsequently reduced as a result of cuts to the defence budget. The replacement was performed as a low-cost measure to fulfill the Swedish Air Force&#x27;s continuing requirement for a primary trainer aircraft. In September 1996, the first of these upgraded aircraft, which was redesignated as the &quot;SK 60W&quot;, was re-delivered to the Swedish Air Force.

In June 2007, Saab signed a long term service agreement with the Austrian Air Force to provide logistics and technical support for their Saab 105Ö fleet for a further 10–15 years. Austria retired the Saab 105 in December 2020. In December 2008, Saab received a SKr900 million ($115 million) contract to support extended operations of Sweden&#x27;s 105 trainer fleet up to mid-2017. In September 2009, a SKr130 million ($18.8 million) contract to deliver a package of cockpit and system upgrades for the SK 60 aircraft was signed. One goal of this modernisation was increased compatibility with the Saab JAS 39 Gripen, the primary combat aircraft of the Swedish Air Force.

In October 2009, Saab proposed replacing the Swedish Air Force&#x27;s SK 60 trainers with the Embraer Super Tucano. In March 2014, the Swedish Air Force publicly acknowledged that it was to begin studying replacement options for the Saab 105. Major General Micael Bydén observed that multinational training opportunities were being examined and that prospective replacement aircraft included the Alenia Aermacchi M-346, BAE Systems Hawk and Pilatus PC-21. In March 2014, Saab and Pilatus Aircraft signed a memorandum of understanding to offer the PC-21 to the Swedish Air Force.

In April 2015, a request for information (RFI) was issued by the Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) for a new Military Flying Training System, to provide long term basic and advanced training fleet functions. The advanced trainer requirements specify the presence of an embedded training capability, including simulated radar and weapons use, as well as tactical displays in both cockpit positions resembling fourth and fifth-generation jet fighter aircraft.

In 2020, Saab signed a new service agreement with the Swedish Armed Forces to provide support for the Saab 105 to 2025, with one year option to 2026. However, the type was officially retired 18 June 2024.

In May 2021, the Grob G 120TP was chosen as the new basic trainer for the Swedish Air force, with first airplanes to be operational in 2023.

==Variants==
; Saab 105
: Prototype. Two built.
; SK 60A
: Two-seat jet trainer, liaison aircraft for the Swedish Air Force. 149 built as SK 60A.
; SK 60B
: Two-seat attack version for the Swedish Air Force, modified from SK 60A with new weapons sight.
; SK 60C
: Two-seat ground attack/reconnaissance version for the Swedish Air Force with extended camera nose. One new-build prototype and 29 conversions from SK 60A.
; SK 60D
: Saab had also designed the Saab 105 for use as a four-seat liaison transport: the two ejection seats could be removed and quickly replaced with four airline-type seats, with no provision for wearing a parachute, or four more austere seats that allowed the wearing of parachutes. In the mid-1970s, ten SK 60A aircraft were permanently configured as transports and given the designation of &quot;SK 60D&quot;. Some were painted in the light green/dark green/tan &quot;splinter&quot; camouflage associated with the Saab Viggen fighter.
; SK 60E
: This variant was a similar four-seat SK 60A conversion, but featured commercial-type instruments, including an instrument landing system. It was used to help train Flygvapnet reserve pilots in flying commercial aircraft. The SK 60E machines were eventually used as SK 60D liaison transports.
; SK 60W
: In 1993, another upgrade program was initiated to modernize the SK 60, the most important improvement being fit of twin Williams Rolls FJ44 turbofans with 8.45 kN (861 kgp/1,900 lbf) each and digital engine controls. The new engines provide more thrust, and are quieter, cleaner, and easier to maintain. The first Williams-powered SK 60—known informally as the &quot;SK 60(W)&quot;—performed its initial flight in August 1995. About 115 conversions of SK 60A, 60B, and 60C aircraft were performed in the late 1990s. No conversions were performed of the SK 60D/E, with all such aircraft grounded and used as spares hulks.
; Saab 105XT
: Export demonstrator. An improved version of the SK 60B, re-engined with 12.68 kN (2,850 lbf) General Electric J85 turbojets. Prototype converted from second Saab 105 prototype.
; Saab 105D
: A refined business jet variant was considered, but the idea was out of date and there were no takers.
; Saab 105G
: Revised version of 105XT with new avionics, including precision nav/attack system, more powerful J85 engines and modified wing. One converted from 105 XT prototype.
; Saab 105H

<doc id="848276" wikidata="Q1318118" url="?curid=848276" title="Last Christmas">
<text>&quot;Last Christmas&quot; is a song by British pop duo Wham!. Written and produced by George Michael, it was released on 3 December 1984 via CBS Records internationally and as a double A-side via Epic Records with &quot;Everything She Wants&quot; in several European countries. The song has been covered by many artists including Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Whigfield, Crazy Frog and Billie Piper.

Upon its initial release in 1984, &quot;Last Christmas&quot; spent five consecutive weeks at number two in the UK singles chart—it was held off the top spot at Christmas by Band Aid&#x27;s &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; (on which Michael also performed). After many chart runs in subsequent years, which included three more weeks at number two, and which saw the recording become part of RCA Records&#x27; catalogue, the song finally reached number one in the UK Singles Chart on New Year&#x27;s Day 2021 (chart week ending date 7 January 2021), more than 36 years after its initial release; in doing so, it became the fifth UK number one single for the duo. Prior to it reaching number one, &quot;Last Christmas&quot; had for many years held the record as the highest-selling single never to top the charts by the Official Charts Company (OCC) with 1.9 million copies sold (not including streams). This record is now held by &quot;Mr. Brightside&quot; by The Killers. The song reached number one in the UK after it was streamed 9.2 million times in the last week of 2020 and sold 1,555 downloads, resulting in a total of 40,149 combined sales. Having been the Christmas number two again in 2022, &quot;Last Christmas&quot; finally achieved the accolade of Christmas number one in 2023, 39 years after its initial release, and, in 2024, became the first song to be the Christmas number one in back-to-back years. Combining sales and streams, it also became the third biggest song on record in the UK.

Outside the United Kingdom, the song topped the charts in fifteen countries and peaked within the top ten of the charts in several countries including Australia, Canada and the United States. It also reached number two on the Billboard Global 200 in January 2021. Wham! donated all of their royalties to relief efforts for the Ethiopian famine. In a UK-wide poll in December 2012, it was voted eight on the ITV television special &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Favourite Christmas Song&quot; and was voted most popular song of the 1980s in Channel 5&#x27;s Christmas 2020 countdown &quot;Britain&#x27;s Favourite &#x27;80s Songs&quot;. It was the most-played Christmas song of the 21st century in the UK until it was overtaken by &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; in 2011.

==Development==

&quot;Last Christmas&quot; had its beginnings in February 1984, while George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley were visiting Michael&#x27;s parents. The song, concerning a Christmas-time breakup and the singer&#x27;s recovery from it, was written by Michael in his childhood bedroom. Michael played Ridgeley the introduction and chorus melody to &quot;Last Christmas&quot;, which Ridgeley later called &quot;a moment of wonder&quot;.

===Recording===
The song was recorded in August 1984, at Advision Studios, London, England. George Michael wrote, performed, produced and played every single instrument on the track. With a LinnDrum drum machine, a Roland Juno-60 synth and sleigh bells, they began recording the song in the summer, Michael having &quot;plastered [the studio] in Christmas decorations to set the mood&quot;. The only other people in the studio were engineer Chris Porter and two assistants, Paul Gommersal and Richard Moakes. According to Porter, lyrically &quot;you&#x27;ve got the happiness of the rhythm track, but against that you&#x27;ve got the sadness of the unrequited love&quot;.

==Chart performance==
===United Kingdom===

Wham! already had two number one singles on the UK singles chart during 1984, and news that they were planning a Christmas single meant that a battle for the coveted Christmas number one spot in Britain seemed set to be between Wham! and the year&#x27;s other big act, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, who had achieved a third No. 1 in early December with &quot;The Power of Love&quot;. The Band Aid single written by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, produced the No. 1 single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, while Wham!&#x27;s offering peaked at No. 2 for much of the period. Wham! donated all &quot;Last Christmas&quot; / &quot;Everything She Wants&quot; royalties, the former of which exceeded £250,000 (), to the Ethiopian famine relief fund.

In subsequent years, the song entered the UK Top 40 on 15 occasions, reaching the Top 10 six times (including a run of five consecutive years between 2016 and 2020). In 1985 and 2017 it equalled its best ever chart position of number two, before finally topping the charts on 1 January 2021, 36 years after its original 1984 release. In the process, &quot;Last Christmas&quot; achieved the chart record for the longest time taken for a single to peak at the top of the UK singles chart after its first release, a feat that had previously been held by &quot;(Is This The Way To) Amarillo? by Tony Christie, which topped the chart in March 2005, 33 years and four months after its initial release in November 1971. The record has since been surpassed in June 2022 by Kate Bush with &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;, which took 37 years.

According to analysis of PRS for Music figures, it was estimated that the song generates £300,000 of royalties per year. 
, &quot;Last Christmas&quot; had sold over 1.90 million copies, being at that time the biggest-selling single in UK chart history not to reach number one, and the 10th best-selling UK single overall. As of December 2023, &quot;Last Christmas&quot; has sold over 1.93 million physical copies and downloads, becoming the eighth best-selling single of all time in the UK overall. It was certified sextuple platinum in December 2023.

In December 2019, it peaked at No. 1 on both the UK Official Vinyl Singles Chart and on the Official Video Streaming Chart. The following week, the song set a new UK chart record and was streamed 17.1 million times, the most number of plays in a week. It became the UK&#x27;s best-selling vinyl single release in 2019. In December 2023, for the first time in the song&#x27;s history, it won the coveted Christmas number 1 spot on The Official Chart Show with Jack Saunders.

===Other territories===
In Germany, the song is the most successful Christmas single of all time, having spent 169 weeks on the German Singles Chart and attained a peak position of No. 1 on 24 December 2021. It has charted every year since 1997. In January 2008, the song fell from No. 4 to No. 64 there, also making it the biggest fall out of the top 10 on the singles chart.

In Ireland the single went to number one for one week in December 1984 before being replaced at the top by Band Aid&#x27;s &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;. It also went back to number one in Ireland at the end of December 2022.

The single was originally released in two different formats in Japan with different cover art, a 7-inch and 12-inch vinyl (Long version) both with &quot;Credit Card Baby&quot; as their B-side. The former entered the top 20 of the Oricon Singles Chart peaking at No. 15, while the latter reached No. 47. The single was released in 1993 on CD single in the country and peaked at No. 17, selling nearly 40,000 copies that week. It was reissued in November 2001 and 2004 as a two-track CD with the single edit and the &quot;pudding mix&quot;.
As a result of the success, &quot;Last Christmas&quot; is the eighth best-selling single of all time in Japan released by a non-Japanese act, with total physical sales of 683,000 units.

In the Netherlands, the song never reached No. 1, peaking at No. 2 in January 1985 (behind Band Aid&#x27;s &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;). In the Dutch Singles Top 100 (one of three charts in the Netherlands that claims to be the &quot;official&quot; chart, but it is the only one that is not broadcast and remains unpublished except on its own official web page), the song has now entered on 16 different occasions, including every year since 2006. Its highest position after 1984 was No. 4 (during the 2016 and 2018 Christmas season). In the Dutch Mega Top 50 (which was first published in 1993), the song re-appeared in 1997, 2000, 2007, 2008, and 2013.

&quot;Last Christmas&quot; was not released commercially as a single in the United States until November 2014, when it was made available on 12&quot; vinyl as a Record Store Day exclusive. Since then, the song has re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Holiday 100 chart on a regular basis, peaking at No. 3 on 7 December 2019.

In November 2016, total US sales of the digital track stood at 751,000 downloads according to Nielsen SoundScan, placing it 10th on the list of best-selling Christmas/holiday digital singles in US SoundScan history. The song debuted at No. 50 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the chart dated 7 January 2017, after George Michael died. In December 2018, the song re-entered the Hot 100, reaching No. 25 in January 2019, and then a new peak of No. 11 in the first issue of 2020. On the issue dated 2 January 2021, &quot;Last Christmas&quot; reached No. 9 on the Hot 100, its first foray into the top 10 and returning Wham! to the top 10 after a 35-year break. The following year, on the issue dated 1 January 2022, the song reached No. 7. On the issue dated 24 December 2022, the song reached a new peak of No. 6 on the Hot 100. On the year&#x27;s last issue of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, dated 31 December 2022, &quot;Last Christmas&quot; reached the top five. In 2024, the song became the first Christmas single to chart during the year-end holiday season, debuting at No. 38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for the week ending 23 November. On &quot;Billboard&quot;″s 50th issue of 2024, dated 14 December, the song reached a new peak position of No. 3 on the Hot 100. On 10 December 2024, the digital single was certified 7× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), indicating US sales of 7 million digital units.

In 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2021, &quot;Last Christmas&quot; reached No. 1 in the Swedish singles chart.

==Music video==
The music video to &quot;Last Christmas&quot; directed by British commercial, film and music video director Andrew Morahan, shows Wham! members Michael and Ridgeley accompanying girlfriends to see friends at an unspecified ski resort cottage; the cable-car that is visible in two shots is from Saas-Fee, Switzerland, where the video was filmed on 21 November 1984. It becomes clear early on that the character of Ridgeley&#x27;s girlfriend (played by model Kathy Hill) was previously in a relationship with Michael and that the song is aimed at her. 

There is a brief flashback to a prior Christmas, showing Michael&#x27;s character presenting Kathy Hill&#x27;s character with a jewelled brooch. In the present time, Ridgeley is wearing the brooch, suggesting that Hill gave the same gift (perhaps by regifting it) to her new love after she and Michael parted ways. When Hill wears the brooch after receiving it from Michael&#x27;s character, it is &quot;right side up&quot;, and when Ridgeley&#x27;s character wears it, he wears it &quot;upside down&quot;. On numerous occasions, Michael presents a thoughtful expression, suggesting his conflicting emotions. As Michael is decorating the Christmas tree some decoration falls to the floor where Michael&#x27;s ex-girlfriend is sitting and the ex-couple shares a few seconds of a knowing look at each other.

At the end of the video, everyone leaves the cottage and when the group get out of the cable-car, they are all properly &quot;paired off&quot; with Michael and his new girlfriend played by actress Debbie Killingback, looking happy.

The video also featured the duo&#x27;s backing singers Pepsi and Shirlie.

===Chalets===
The music video was shot across two Saas-Fee chalets. One—Chalet Schliechten—was used for the external shots, including the snowball fight. The other—Chalet Steinmatte—was used for the tree-decorating and dinner scenes.

===Restoration===
The music video, originally shot on 35mm film, was re-released on 13 December 2019 in 4K Ultra HD resolution. The music video&#x27;s original film director Andy Morahan had found seven out of the eight rolls of original 35mm rushes and worked with teams at Cinelab London and VFX artist Russ Shaw at Nice Biscuits post production to recreate the video using the higher-resolution film.

===&quot;Last Christmas Unwrapped&quot;===
A sixty-minute TV documentary about the story of &quot;Last Christmas&quot; aired on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer in December 2024 to mark the 40th anniversary of its release. It features Ridgeley, Shirlie, Pepsi and other close friends from the original music video, and revisits Saas-Fee in Switzerland where the music video was made, as well as looking into the creation of the song.

==Release history==
==In other media==
The film &quot;Last Christmas&quot; (2019) prominently features the music of George Michael, including this song.

==Plagiarism allegations==
On behalf of the writers of the song &quot;Can&#x27;t Smile Without You&quot;, made popular by Barry Manilow, publishing company Dick James Music sued Michael for plagiarism in the mid-1980s, claiming that &quot;Last Christmas&quot; lifted its melody from the former. The case was dismissed when a musicologist presented 60-odd songs from the past century that had a comparable chord sequence and melody.

==Whigfield version==
Italian dance act Whigfield covered &quot;Last Christmas&quot; and released it as a double A-side with &quot;Big Time&quot; in the UK in December 1995. The single was also released as a double A-side single in Germany with &quot;Close to You&quot;. In other countries, &quot;Last Christmas&quot; was released on its own with various remixes. The single was produced by Larry Pignagnoli and reached number 21 in the UK, which was Whigfield&#x27;s final release on Systematic Records. It also appears on various Special Edition versions of her debut album, &quot;Whigfield&quot; (1995), and also on &quot;Whigfield II&quot; (1997). The accompanying music video for Whigfield&#x27;s cover was directed by Italian director Giacomo De Simone, featuring the singer performing the song in a winter landscape.

===Chart performance===
Whigfield&#x27;s cover of &quot;Last Christmas&quot; climbed into the top 10 in both Denmark and Spain, peaking at numbers six and five, respectively. It was also a top-20 hit in Finland and a top-30 hit in Ireland and the United Kingdom. In the latter country, &quot;Last Christmas&quot; / &quot;Big Time&quot; peaked at number 21 during its first week on the UK singles chart, on 10 December 1995. It was additionally a top-40 hit in Belgium, as well as on the European Hot 100 Singles, on which the song reached number 38.

===Critical reception===
John Perry from &quot;NME&quot; named &quot;Last Christmas&quot; by Whigfield Single of the Week, writing, &quot;Gird your loins and don that silly party hat, pop-pickers, because what we have here is &quot;the&quot; classic Christmas single. [...] The Whigster has taken what was a definitive Christmas song and given it a monster &#x27;I Feel Love&#x27; hi-NRG fuel-injection that will have the nation stomping those accursed parsnips into Auntie Mabel&#x27;s best rug in front of The Queen...&quot; Gill Whyte from &quot;Smash Hits&quot; gave it two out of five, describing it as &quot;a cover of the George Michael swoon choon for the festive season, given the usual tinny pop Whiggers treatment, with lots of bingy-bongy synths. A classic song, so you can&#x27;t go wrong, um, only she has, &#x27;cos it just ain&#x27;t as good as the original.&quot;

==Carly Rae Jepsen version==
&quot;Last Christmas&quot; was covered by Canadian singer Carly Rae Jepsen in 2015 and was released to digital retailers on 20 November 2015 through 604 Records (in Canada) and Interscope Records and School Boy Records (internationally). Jepsen&#x27;s rendition was praised by critics for combining stylistic elements similar to the original with modern production. She performed the song live at the annual NBC television special Christmas in Rockefeller Center airing on 2 December 2015, and on the episode of &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot; airing on 16 December 2015.

Bianca Gracie of Idolator described the song as &quot;quintessential Carly&quot; for highlighting Jepsen&#x27;s unique vocals and synth production and wrote that her cover will &quot;charm your... socks off&quot;. Nolan Feeney of &quot;Time&quot; echoed those sentiments, noting that &quot;Last Christmas&quot; is &quot;the kind of brokenhearted yet warm and sweet song [Jepsen] excels at&quot;. Jackson McHenry of &quot;Vulture&quot; applauded Jepsen for her straightforward approach to the song and avoiding the &quot;vocal gymnastics&quot; that bog down some Christmas covers.

A more critical review came from music blog &quot;Popcrush&quot;, who deemed the cover overproduced, saying &quot;The slick production is a disservice to both Jepsen&#x27;s vocals and the original&#x27;s emotional heft.&quot;

<text>Chenopodium album is a fast-growing annual plant in the flowering plant family Amaranthaceae. Though cultivated in some regions, the plant is elsewhere considered a weed. Common names include lamb&#x27;s quarters, melde, goosefoot, wild spinach and fat-hen, though the latter two are also applied to other species of the genus &quot;Chenopodium&quot;, for which reason it is often distinguished as white goosefoot.

==Description==
It tends to grow upright at first, reaching heights of , rarely to 3 m); it then typically becomes recumbent after flowering (due to the weight of the foliage and seeds) unless supported by other plants. The leaves are alternate and varied in appearance. The first leaves, near the base of the plant, are toothed and roughly diamond-shaped, 3–7 cm long and 3–6 cm broad. The leaves on the upper part of the flowering stems are entire and lanceolate-rhomboid, 1–5 cm long and 0.4–2 cm broad; they are waxy-coated, unwettable and mealy in appearance, with a whitish coat on the underside. The small flowers are radially symmetrical and grow in small cymes on a dense branched inflorescence 10–40 cm long. Further, the flowers are bisexual and female, with five tepals which are mealy on outer surface, and shortly united at the base. There are five stamens.

===Similar species===
Poisonous black nightshade looks similar to this species when young, but the leaves of &quot;C. album&quot; have a white mealy texture and its axils have a red streak.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Chenopodium album&quot; has a complex taxonomy and has been divided into numerous microspecies, subspecies and varieties, but it is difficult to differentiate between them. The following varieties are accepted by &quot;Plants of the World Online&quot;:
* &quot;Chenopodium album&quot; var. &quot;album&quot; – temperate Eurasia and Indian subcontinent, North Africa, and Ethiopia
* &quot;Chenopodium album&quot; var. &quot;missouriense&quot; (synonym &quot;Chenopodium missouriense&quot; ) – eastern and central United States
* &quot;Chenopodium album&quot; var. &quot;reticulatum&quot; (synonym &quot;Chenopodium reticulatum&quot; ) – France and Great Britain

== Distribution and habitat ==
Its native range is obscure due to extensive cultivation, but includes most of Europe, from where Carl Linnaeus described the species in 1753. Plants native to eastern Asia are included under &quot;C. album&quot;, but often differ from European specimens. According to &quot;Plants of the World Online&quot;, the species&#x27; natural distribution includes temperate Eurasia from western Europe to China and the Russian Far East, the Indian subcontinent, North Africa, Ethiopia, and the eastern and central United States.

It is widely naturalized elsewhere, such as in Africa, Australasia, North America, and Oceania, and now occurs almost everywhere (except Antarctica) in soils rich in nitrogen, especially on wasteland.

== Cultivation ==

===Regions===
The species are cultivated as a grain or vegetable crop (such as in lieu of spinach), as well as animal feed in Asia and Africa, whereas in Europe and North America, it is commonly regarded as a weed in places such as potato fields, while in Australia it is naturalised in all states and regarded as an environmental weed in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. While var. &quot;album&quot; is considered invasive in some regions of the U.S., var. &quot;missouriense&quot; is native.

===Potential impact on conventional crops===
It is one of the more robust and competitive weeds, exceptionally capable of colonizing new areas. It may produce up to 50 million seeds per hectare, its seeds remain viable 30 to 40 years in the soil, and it exhibits high phenotype plasticity, modifying its growth form for the conditions it is in. It may be controlled by dark tillage, rotary hoeing, or flaming when the plants are small. Crop rotation of small grains will suppress an infestation. It is easily controlled with a number of pre-emergence herbicides. Its pollen may contribute to hay fever-like allergies.

===Pest control===
&quot;Chenopodium album&quot; is vulnerable to leaf miners, making it a useful trap crop as a companion plant. Growing near other plants, it attracts leaf miners which might otherwise have attacked the crop to be protected. It is a host plant for the beet leafhopper, an insect which transmits curly top virus to beet crops.

==Uses==

===Nutrition===

Raw lamb&#x27;s quarters are 84% water, 7% carbohydrates, 4% protein, and 1% fat. In a 100 gram reference amount, lamb&#x27;s quarters provide 43 calories, and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin C (96% DV), vitamin A (73% DV), riboflavin (37% DV), vitamin B6 (21% DV), manganese (37% DV), and calcium (31% DV), with several other dietary minerals in lesser amounts.

===Culinary uses===
The young shoots may be eaten raw or cooked. The leaves are preferable cooked.

The flower buds and flowers can also be eaten cooked. Each plant produces tens of thousands of black seeds. Quinoa, a closely related species, is grown specifically for its seeds. The Zuni people cook the young plants&#x27; greens.

Archaeologists analysing carbonized plant remains found in storage pits and ovens at Iron Age, Viking Age, and Roman sites in Europe have found its seeds mixed with conventional grains and even inside the stomachs of Danish bog bodies.

In India, the plant is called &quot;bathua&quot; and is found abundantly in the winter season. The leaves and young shoots of this plant are used in dishes such as soups, curries, and paratha-stuffed breads, common in North India. The seeds or grains are used in &quot;phambra&quot;, gruel-type dishes in Himachal Pradesh, and in mildly alcoholic fermented beverages such as&quot; soora&quot; and &quot;ghanti&quot;. In Haryana state, the &quot;bathue ka raita&quot; i.e. the raita (yogurt accompaniment) made with bathua, is commonly eaten in winters.

In Nepal, it is known as &quot;bethe&quot; or &quot;bethu&quot;. It is used to make a dish known as &quot;saag&quot;. The leaves are stir-fried with spices, chilli and diced garlic. A fermented dish known as &quot;masaura&quot; is also made by dipping the leaves in a lentil batter with spices and then dried in sun for some days. The fermented &quot;masaura&quot; can be made into a curry and served with rice.

===Animal feed===
As some of the common names suggest, it is also used as feed (both the leaves and the seeds) for chickens and other poultry.

===Construction===
The juice of this plant is a potent ingredient for a mixture of wall plaster, according to the Samarāṅgaṇa Sūtradhāra, which is a Sanskrit treatise dealing with Śilpaśāstra (Hindu science of art and construction).

===Ayurveda===
In Ayurveda traditional medicine, bathua is thought to be useful for treating various diseases, although there is no clinical evidence such uses are safe or effective.

<text>Whigfield is an Italian dance act fronted by Danish singer, former model, songwriter, and record producer Sannie Charlotte Carlson (born 11 April 1970), known by her various stage names, including Whigfield, Sannie, or simply Naan. She is best known for her 1993 single &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, which became an international hit the following year.

Based in Italy at the time, Carlson collaborated with Italian producer Larry Pignagnoli, and &quot;Saturday Night&quot; entered the top five in Italy. The single &quot;Another Day&quot; also peaked at number three in Italy. Additionally, the single &quot;Sexy Eyes&quot; charted in various markets, along with &quot;Another Day&quot; and &quot;Think of You&quot;, both of which entered the top ten in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, and her native Denmark.

She competed in the &quot;Dansk Melodi Grand Prix 2018&quot; with the song &quot;Boys on Girls&quot; but did not qualify for the superfinal.

==Early life== 
Carlson was born in Skælskør, Denmark. As a child, she spent several years in Africa before returning to her native country. Prior to her singing career, Carlson worked as a model and studied music. She performed in a duo before meeting producer Larry Pignagnoli, at which point she adopted the name &quot;Whigfield&quot;.

<text>The Tales of Beatrix Potter (US title: &quot;Peter Rabbit and Tales of Beatrix Potter&quot;) is a 1971 ballet film based on the children&#x27;s stories of English author and illustrator Beatrix Potter. The film was directed by Reginald Mills, choreographed by Sir Frederick Ashton (who danced the role of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle), and featured dancers from The Royal Ballet. The musical score was arranged by John Lanchbery from various sources, such as the operas of Michael Balfe and of Sir Arthur Sullivan, and performed by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House conducted by Lanchbery. It was produced by Richard Goodwin with John Brabourne as executive producer. The stories were adapted by Goodwin and his wife designer Christine Edzard.

&quot;The Tales of Beatrix Potter&quot; is the only feature film directed by Mills, who is best remembered as a film editor. Mills edited &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (1948) and other films directed and produced by Powell and Pressburger that incorporated ballet.

==Production==
===Development===
The idea started in 1968 when Christine Edzard travelled from Paris, where she was assistant to the designer Lila de Nobili, to work on the sets of Zeffirelli&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1968) in Rome. There she met Goodwin, associate producer for John Brabourne who was making the film, and the two became a couple. They decided they would do something together and while in Britain meeting Goodwin&#x27;s mother, Edzard saw and heard Beatrix Potter for the first time as Mrs. Goodwin read &quot;The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle&quot; to her grandchildren. Edzard showed the “thoroughly English” book to Nobili, who was in Covent Garden with &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; ballet, which featured dancing animals, mice and a cat. Nobili suggested it as a project for the couple, and &quot;the Tales&quot; as a ballet was born. 

Lila de Nobili had brought Rostislav Doboujinsky over from Paris to make animal masks for the first act of &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; and Doboujinsky talked with Goodwin and Edzard. In October 1969, he agreed to make a sample mask for mouse character &#x27;Hunca Munca&#x27; whose face is “perhaps the most appealing in the film”. 

Conceived of as a filmed ballet, Goodwin and Edzard approached Frederick Ashton, former director of the Royal Ballet, to choreograph. Ashton later said: &quot;I was not certain that with films dominated by violence and sex the time was right for such an explosion of sheer charm. But now I think the public is more than ready for something like this.&quot;

The couple&#x27;s first approach to Frederick Warne, Beatrix Potter&#x27;s publisher, was turned down firmly. (The estate had turned down an approach from Walt Disney because they were worried he would distort the work.) However, their ideas and Christine&#x27;s initial sketches began to win them over and while both Warne and Ashton were still considering the proposed project, and terms being agreed, preparations for filming took place over the following year. It was a risk, and Goodwin acknowledged that had Warne in the end still refused, they would have “been ruined.” 

Goodwin succeeded in getting the film rights from Potter&#x27;s estate. According to Bryan Forbes they only paid £5,000 for the rights.

The film was given the go ahead by Forbes during his period as head of production at EMI Films. Forbes recalled that the EMI Board were not enthusiastic, and Nat Cohen had never heard of Beatrix Potter, but Forbes had complete artistic control for any movie made with a budget under £1 million so could easily gain approval. &quot;We were extremely lucky,&quot; said Brabourne about Forbes. Forbes later called it &quot;one of the most original movies ever made&quot;.

Instead of a conventional screenplay, Edzard, who co-wrote the screenplay as well as designing the production and costumes, produced over two hundred sketches. The sketches were used to create the film&#x27;s working script from a juxtaposition of five of Beatrix Potter&#x27;s Tales - &quot;The Tale of Jemina Puddleduck&quot;, &quot;The Tale of Pigling Bland&quot;, &quot;The Tale of Jeremy Fisher&quot;, &quot;The Tale of Two Bad Mice&quot; and &quot;The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin&quot;. The film deviates at times from the plots but retains the authenticity of Potter&#x27;s original, and features visitors such as Peter Rabbit from other books. 

It was the first collaboration with Goodwin by Edzard, who is known for her meticulous filmmaking, often based on Victorian English sources. The couple went on to found Sands Films. Their productions since include &quot;Stories from a Flying Trunk&quot; (1979), &quot;The Nightingale&quot; (1981), &quot;Biddy&quot; (1983), &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; (1987), &quot;The Fool&quot; (1990), &quot;As You Like It&quot; (1991), &quot;Amahl and the Night Visitors&quot; (1996), &quot;The IMAX Nutcracker&quot; (1997), &quot;The Children&#x27;s Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (2001) and &quot;The Good Soldier Schwejk&quot; (2018).

John Brabourne said Goodwin and Edzard &quot;made all the costumes in their own house and we used my production company. Christine brought in that fantastic man, Rostislav Doboujinsky, who did the masks. It was all their conception, their idea, so I got behind it and pushed it but I thought it only fair that Richard should have the Producer credit.&quot;

With Christine Edzard, Doboujinsky made the masks “on which much of the picture&#x27;s success depended”. Doboujinsky&#x27;s original masks for the film, made of bike helmets, polystyrene, hand-sewn hair and vision holes covered in gauze, had to be recreated for the stage, with a larger field of vision for the dancers. The artist used moulds of the originals, drilling hundreds of holes at the front and covering the mask in nylon hair “using electrostatic charges.”

The music was arranged by John Lanchbery, who had previously worked with Ashton on &quot;La fille mal gardée&quot;, &quot;Les Deux Pigeons&quot; and &quot;The Dream&quot;, based on themes by Balfe, George Jacobs, Ludwig Minkus, Jacques Offenbach, Arthur Sullivan and others.

Producer Richard Goodwin called the film &quot;a diversion... a souffle... it is an entertainment.&quot; The costumes travelled to the US as an exhibition on board the &quot;QE2&quot; in the year the film was released.

===Shooting===
Filming started in May 1970 at EMI&#x27;s Elstree Studios where the unit was based for five weeks. There had already been second unit photography done at the Lakes District.

==Release==
The film was given a Royal premiere in front of Queen Elizabeth II on 1 April 1970.
==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was one of the most successful of the Forbes regime at EMI Films. It was one of the most popular movies in 1971 at the British box office. By June 1972 it earned EMI a profit of £18,000.

In 1994 Bryan Forbes confirmed the film was very profitable.

===Critical===
A 1971 review by Roger Ebert was favourable: &quot;The stories are told simply and directly and with a certain almost clumsy charm. Instead of going for perfection in the dancing, the Royal Ballet dancers have gone for characterizations instead. The various animals have their quirks and eccentricities, and they are fairly authentic: The frog dances like a frog, for example, and not like Nureyev.&quot; 

Anthony Nield wrote in 2011, &quot;&quot;Tales of Beatrix Potter&quot; is one of British cinema&#x27;s true one-offs, a film quite unlike any other. Ostensibly aimed at children, this adaptation of Potter’s various animal-centric stories was mounted by the Royal Ballet and choreographed by Sir Frederick Ashton. The tales are rendered as a series of dances, loosely interconnected by the author as a young girl (played by Érin Geraghty) and her active imagination. There are no words, only music and movement as the performers of the Royal Ballet—in full animal costume—interpret her stories&#x27; simple narratives.&quot;
==Awards==
The film&#x27;s designer, Christine Edzard, was nominated for BAFTA awards for Best Art Direction and for Best Costume Design.
==Legacy==
John Braborne says Agatha Christie let him have the screen rights to &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; because she liked &quot;Tales of Beatrix Potter&quot;.

The same team made a movie based on Hans Christian Andersen stories, &quot;Stories from a Flying Trunk&quot; (1979).

In 1992, Anthony Dowell, then Director of The Royal Ballet, produced a stage version of the film.

==Home media==
The film was released to DVD in 2004 and 2009. A digitally restored version was released as a Blu-ray DVD in 2011, in commemoration of the film&#x27;s 40th anniversary.

<doc id="848300" wikidata="Q2653155" url="?curid=848300" title="Liberal Party (Brazil, 1985)">
<text>The Liberal Party (&quot;Partido Liberal&quot;, PL) was a conservative political party of Brazil, active from 1985 to 2006. The Pentecostal Universal Church of the Kingdom of God heavily influenced the party after 1999. In the 2002 election, José Alencar of the PL was elected vice president as the running mate of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. At the legislative elections on 6 October 2002, the party won 26 out of 513 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and three out of 81 seats in the Senate of Brazil and supported Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&#x27;s government. Some of its members were investigated following corruption allegations and suspected involvement in the so-called &quot;Mensalão scandal&quot;. The Universal Church-led faction then left the PL to create a new party named Brazilian Republican Party (PRB) in 2005.

At the last elections the party contested, in October 2006, it won 23 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and one seat in the Senate for a total of three senate seats. The party did not run candidates in presidential or gubernatorial elections.

On 21 December 2006, the Liberal Party merged with the Party of the Reconstruction of the National Order (&quot;Partido da Reedificação da Ordem Nacional&quot;, PRONA) to create the Party of the Republic (&quot;Partido da Republica&quot;, PR). In 2019, the Party of the Republic renamed itself to the Liberal Party.

<text>Jon Spencer (born February 5, 1965) is an American singer, composer and guitarist. He has been involved in multiple musical acts, such as Pussy Galore, Boss Hog, Heavy Trash and The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion.

== History ==
Jon Spencer was born on 5 February 1965 in Hanover, New Hampshire, to a university professor and a cardiology technician. He attended Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, where he was part of the noise rock band Shithaus, which included future Cop Shoot Cop vocalist Tod Ashley. The band was short lived and had a musical style reminiscent of the industrial music of Einstürzende Neubauten. He moved to Washington, D.C., and formed Pussy Galore, who quickly relocated to New York.

He is also known for bringing attention to and popularizing the blues artist R. L. Burnside, who started touring and working with The Blues Explosion in the mid-1990s after playing and living in obscurity for three decades.

In 2022, he announced the end of the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion and the debut of his new band, Jon Spencer &amp; the Hitmakers, which includes Quasi&#x27;s Sam Coomes and Janet Weiss.

He joined up with bassist Kendall Wind and drummer Macky Spider Bowman of The Bobby Lees in 2023 and released &quot;Sick Of Being Sick!&quot; in 2024.

<text>Popstars is an international reality television franchise aimed to find new singing talent. Serving as a precursor to the &quot;Idol&quot; franchise, &quot;Popstars&quot; first began in New Zealand in 1999 when producer Jonathan Dowling formed the girl group TrueBliss. Despite all shows in the &quot;Popstars&quot; franchise having been off air in recent years, it remains one of the most successful TV show formats of all time with the format being sold to more than 50 countries, and producing groups such as Girls Aloud that had success on the UK charts for the next ten years after winning. The show was the inspiration for Simon Fuller&#x27;s &quot;Idols&quot; franchise.

==History==

The series originated in New Zealand, broadcast on TV2 in 1999, where producer Jonathan Dowling formed the five member all-girl group TrueBliss. Dowling then licensed the concept to production company Screentime in Australia, who then on sold it to TresorTV in Germany before taking it worldwide. Despite all versions now being cancelled, &quot;Popstars&quot; remains very successful, with the format being sold to over 50 countries.

The show was the inspiration for Simon Fuller&#x27;s &quot;Pop Idol&quot; franchise which would dominate reality TV, (along with &quot;Big Brother&quot; and &quot;Survivor&quot;) for the next few years.

Although &quot;Popstars&quot; started successfully in most countries during the early 2000s, the shows gradually began to fail and were dropped by many broadcasters due to poor ratings. The last country where &quot;Popstars&quot; was still popular and successful – besides other casting shows such as &quot;The X Factor&quot; and &quot;Got Talent&quot;, as well as &quot;Idol&quot; – was Germany. This is where ProSieben produced the ninth season in 2010 because of the show&#x27;s massive success in the ratings, but in 2012, &quot;Popstars&quot; was finally cancelled due to the short success of the groups formed throughout the episodes. In 2007, the show returned to France on M6 for one season. A new version of &quot;Popstars&quot; started in 2008 in the Netherlands and ran for three seasons. Germany&#x27;s version returned for an eleventh season in 2015, but would later get cancelled following poor ratings. In 2021, a revamped version of the original New Zealand series returned to TVNZ. The new series focuses on individual artists and songwriting development and does not involve putting together a pop group.

<doc id="848304" wikidata="Q1771223" url="?curid=848304" title="Culture of Nauru">
<text>The displacement of the traditional culture of Nauru by contemporary western influences is evident on the island. Little remains from the old customs. The traditions of arts and crafts are nearly lost.

==Arts and crafts==

The inhabitants of Nauru wear the usual tropical clothes: short trousers and light shirts. Fishing still follows a traditional method: the island anglers wait in small light boats for fish to arrive. The custom of fishing by trained frigatebirds has been preserved.

Nauruan folk songs existed as of 1970, while &quot;Oh Bwio Eben Bwio&quot; is a noticeable folk song.

Whilst the traditional culture rapidly gives way to the contemporary, as elsewhere in Micronesia, music and dance still rank among the most popular art forms. Rhythmic singing and traditional &quot;reigen&quot; are performed particularly at celebrations. At least, a historical form of a Nauruan dance called &quot;fish dance&quot; in English was record in a form of photographs. Known contemporary dances are the frigate bird dance and the dogoropa.

Craftsmen make articles of clothing and fans of &quot;Kokosfasern&quot; and the sheets of the screw tree and use geometrical samples, which resemble those of the Indonesian culture. Also the wood of the &quot;kokospalme&quot; is used for the production of arts and crafts.

==Language and education==
The language of Nauru, Dorerin Naoero, is a Micronesian language. English is understood and spoken widely.

Education is compulsory from 4 to 16, in all the schools on the island. The University of the South Pacific has a centre in Nauru located in the Aiwo District and offers pre-school teacher education, nutrition and disability studies and will offer the Community Workers Certificate. The campus offers Audio and video conferencing facilities, library and computer laboratory as well as internet and email access via USPNet are available for students. For secondary and university education, most Nauruans&#x27; children must go abroad. During its prosperous years these children were sent to Australia but now were sent to Fiji.

The official national holiday is the independence day on 31 January, but Angam Day, 26 October, is considered as an additional national holiday.

The Nauruan words of the national anthem were written by Margaret Hendrie and adopted in 1968 upon the Republic of Nauru&#x27;s independence.

==Sport==

The most popular in Nauru is Australian rules football. A 12-team senior league operates in the country, see Australian rules football in Nauru and it is a popular spectator sport. Nauru has competed internationally in Australian rules football at the Arafura Games, Australian Football International Cup and Barassi International Youth Tournament. The national team, the &quot;Chiefs&quot;, ranked 8th in the International Cup in 2002 and gold medal at the Arafura Games.

Nauru&#x27;s national basketball team made the headlines internationally at the 1969 Pacific Games when it beat the Solomon Islands, which have almost 60 times of Nauru&#x27;s population, and Fiji, which has almost 100 times of Nauru&#x27;s population.

Nauruans also play soccer, softball, tennis, sailing, and swimming. Golf is accessible in Menen Hotel. There are only a few sport grounds in Nauru. The only stadium is in Yaren, but it is obsolete and fails to meet international standards. A larger and more modern sports stadium is being built in Meneng, however lack of money has caused the project to stall. The current stadia are:
* Aida Oval
* Denig Stadium in Denigomodu 
* Linkbelt Oval in Aiwo
* Menen Stadium in Meneng 
* National Stadium in Yaren

A traditional &#x27;sport&#x27; is catching birds (Black Noddy) when they return from foraging at sea to the island towards sunset. The men then stand on the beach ready to throw their lasso. The Nauruan lasso is supple rope with a weight at the end. When a bird comes over they throw their lasso up, it hits and or drapes itself over the bird, which then falls down and is seized and are roosted as pets.

Eakabarere is a traditional form of Nauruan wrestling. Weightlifting is also one of the more traditional sports in Nauru.

==Radio==
The island features in the 1941 radio play &quot;Drift&quot;.

<doc id="848305" wikidata="Q2366265" url="?curid=848305" title="Social Liberal Party (Brazil)">
<text>The Social Liberal Party (, PSL) was a far-right political party in Brazil, that merged with the Democrats and founded the Brazil Union. Founded in 1994 as a social-liberal political party, the PSL was registered on the Superior Electoral Court in 1998.

In January 2018, former Social Christian Party politician Jair Bolsonaro joined the party and later converted it into an economically liberal, Brazilian nationalist, radically anti-communist and social conservative party. The original name remained after the ideological shift, and after Livres (the party&#x27;s original main wing) left the party and formed their own political movement to continue the party&#x27;s original goals. Bolsonaro became the party&#x27;s nominee for the 2018 Brazilian general election and won in both rounds. Bolsonaro left the party in 2019 after disagreements with its president, Luciano Bivar, and then founded Alliance for Brazil.

On 6 October 2021, the party voted to merge with the Democrats to establish the Brazil Union party.

== History ==

PSL was originally founded on 30 October 1994 by businessman Luciano Bivar as a social liberal party. It was registered on the Superior Electoral Court on 2 June 1998.

In the 2002 legislative elections, PSL won 1 out of 513 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and no seats in the Federal Senate. In the 2006 legislative elections, the party won no seats in the Chamber of Deputies or the Federal Senate. In the 2010 legislative elections, PSL won 1 seat in the Chamber of Deputies and no seats in the Federal Senate, maintaining the same results in the 2014 legislative elections.

In 2015, PSL underwent a reform led by the internal social liberal wing Livres, with names such as political scientist and journalist Leandro Narloch reinforcing the party&#x27;s affiliation with social liberal policies. PSL also supported the impeachment of former president Dilma Rousseff.

On 5 January 2018, conservative and former Social Christian politician Jair Bolsonaro became a member of the party, which prompted the Livres wing to leave the party in protest of Bolsonaro&#x27;s social conservative views. After the exit of Livres, the party followed a national conservative path, changed its colors from purple to the more nationalist blue, yellow and green (the colors of Brazil&#x27;s flag) and since then has discussed a name change either to Republicans (&quot;Republicanos&quot;) or Mobilize (&quot;Mobiliza&quot;). On 5 March 2018, Bivar stepped down from party&#x27;s presidency and Gustavo Bebianno was appointed as acting president.

Bolsonaro eventually became PSL&#x27;s nominee for the 2018 presidential election, exceeding polling forecasts to receive 46% of the popular vote in the first round. Bolsonaro&#x27;s coattails helped elect 52 deputies and 4 senators from PSL, which made it the second largest political party in the post-2018 Chamber of Deputies. It also became the largest single party in the legislative assemblies of both Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. On 28 October 2018, Bolsonaro was elected president with 55.13% of the votes, defeating Workers&#x27; Party&#x27;s Fernando Haddad. He took office on 1 January 2019.

On 29 October 2018, Bivar was re-appointed as party&#x27;s president. On 12 November 2019, Bolsonaro announced his departure from the party following disagreements with the national executive.

On 6 October 2021, the party voted to merge with the Democrats (DEM) to establish the Brazil Union party. The new party plans to use the number 44 as its electoral number. The merger was approved by the Superior Electoral Court and officially became registered on 8 February 2022. As such, both PSL and DEM were disbanded.

== Organization ==
=== Ideology and policies ===
Since Bolsonaro&#x27;s entrance in the party, PSL has changed much of its ideologies. It went from a social-liberal party with an economic liberal group Livres to a far-right and right-wing populist party, abandoning its former cultural liberalism and keeping its economic liberal policies, supporting privatisation and decentralisation, while at the same time adopting cultural conservatism as well as social-conservative policies regarding abortion, legalization of marijuana, and teaching of gender identity in schools.

<text>Koo Vi Kyuin (; January 29, 1888 – November 14, 1985), better known as V. K. Wellington Koo, was a Chinese diplomat and politician of the Republic of China.

Born in Shanghai, Koo studied at Columbia University in the United States, where he obtained a PhD in international law and diplomacy. On his return to China in 1912, he became Yuan Shikai&#x27;s secretary for foreign affairs, and in 1919, was a member of China&#x27;s delegation at the Paris Peace Conference, where he unsuccessfully demanded the return of Shandong. Between 1922 and 1927, Koo successively served the Beiyang government as minister of foreign affairs, minister of finance, acting premier, and president. After the Northern Expedition toppled the government in 1928, Koo joined the Nationalist government and continued his diplomatic career. In 1931, he represented China at the League of Nations to protest the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. He served as China&#x27;s ambassador to France and Great Britain during World War II, and in 1945 represented China at the signing of the Charter of the United Nations. From 1946 to 1956, he served as the Republic of China&#x27;s ambassador to the United States, and sat as a judge on the International Court of Justice in The Hague from 1957 to 1967. He retired in New York City and died at the age of 97.

== Early life and career (1888–1912) ==

Born in Jiading, now a suburb of Shanghai, in 1888, Koo grew up in an upper-class cosmopolitan family and was fluent in both English and French, which greatly aided his diplomatic career. In 1895, he was greatly affected by China&#x27;s defeat at the hands of Japan, which led to the humiliating Treaty of Shimonoseki. Koo later wrote: &quot;Ever since I was seven years old, when I heard with depressed heart the news of China&#x27;s defeat by Japan, I had desired to work for China&#x27;s recovery and the removal of the Japanese menace&quot;. Koo&#x27;s father resolved to give him a &quot;modern&quot; education to help him prepare for the coming 20th century and to work for China&#x27;s modernization. The naval battles during the recent war where the modern British-built warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy had blown out of the water the antiquated junks of the Imperial Chinese Navy had dramatically shown that modern, industrial powers had the advantage over backward nations. In 1897, Germany occupied the Shangdong Province after a short campaign, which again showed to the young Koo that as long as China was backward, it would be bullied by stronger powers.

Aged 11, Koo was sent to be educated at the Anglo-Chinese Junior College in Shanghai, where he was taught in English various subjects such as modern science and geography, though his studies were cut short when he contracted typhoid fever. While at the college, Koo once rode a bicycle down the streets of Shanghai into the International Settlement and followed an English boy also riding a bicycle onto the sidewalk, where an Indian policeman allowed the English boy to continue while stopping Koo to give him a fine for riding his bicycle on the sidewalk. Koo was shocked to discover that owing to extraterritoriality, the laws and rules that applied to Chinese in China did not apply to British subjects—in this instance, laws prohibiting riding a bicycle on the sidewalk—and that a foreign policeman had power over the Chinese police. Koo was left with a lifelong desire to end the status of extraterritoriality that had been imposed by the 19th-century &quot;unequal treaties&quot;.

Koo studied at Saint John&#x27;s University, Shanghai from 1901 to 1904, and Columbia University in New York City, where he was a member of the Philolexian Society, a literary and debating club, editor-in-chief of the &quot;Columbia Daily Spectator&quot;, and graduated with a BA in Liberal Arts (1908) and an MA in Political Science (1909). In 1912 he received his PhD in international law and diplomacy from Columbia.

== Return to Beijing ==
Koo returned to Beijing in 1912. He served the Republic of China as English Secretary to President Yuan Shikai. In 1915, Koo was made China&#x27;s Minister to the United States and Cuba.

==At the Paris Peace Conference==
In 1919, he was a member of the Chinese delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, led by Foreign Minister Lu Zhengxiang. In 1897, China had been forced to sign a treaty that gave a 99-year lease giving sovereignty over the city of Qingdao to Germany while also giving Germany various special rights and economic control over the Shandong peninsula. Qingdao became the principal German naval base in Asia. In 1914, Japan entered World War I on the Allied side and seized Qingdao after a siege. The Japanese made it very clear that they wished to take over the German rights in Shandong province by right of conquest, a demand that the Chinese vehemently rejected. In January 1915, Japan presented the 21 Demands that if accepted would have turned China into a virtual Japanese protectorate, warning in a note presented to the Chinese that Japan would take &quot;vigorous methods&quot; if the 21 Demands were rejected. Following protests from the United States that the 21 Demands would negate the Open Door policy towards trade with China, the Japanese dropped the more extreme of the 21 Demands. On 25 May 1915, the Japanese forced the Chinese to agree that after the war ended, the Japanese would take over all of the German rights in the Shandong peninsula, which caused protests all over China over what was deemed &quot;National Humiliation Day&quot;.

As a young diplomat, Koo was strongly opposed to the acceptance of the Japanese demands. Koo had become close to President Woodrow Wilson, who invited him to visit the White House, where he was given to understand that the United States would support China&#x27;s demands regarding the Shandong peninsula against Japan at the Paris Peace Conference. Wilson asked for Koo to attend the peace conference in Paris, and moreover, Koo travelled on the same ship that took Wilson and the rest of the American delegation to France in December 1918. The Canadian historian Margaret MacMillan wrote: &quot;Koo, who was only thirty-two in 1919, was a forceful and distinguished personality...At Columbia University, in New York, where he earned an undergraduate and graduate degree, he had been an outstanding student...He had also been on the university debating team, as the Japanese delegates would learn to their cost&quot;.

The Chinese delegation stayed at the Hotel Lutétia, though the Australian journalist George Ernest Morrison who also served with the Chinese delegation stayed at the MacMahon Palais. On 22 January 1919, Alfred Sao-ke Sze of the Chinese delegation arranged for a dinner attended by Koo where Ronald Macleay of the British delegation frankly told that Britain &quot;could not do much&quot; in the matter of the Shandong. During the First World War, hundreds of thousands of Chinese coolies went to France where they dug the trenches for both the British and French armies, often under German fire. Koo argued very forcefully that though no Chinese troops had fought in Europe, the sacrifices of the Chinese coolies who dug the trenches amid appalling conditions on the Western Front entitled China to be treated as one of the powers that made an important contribution to the Allied victory. When Macleay suggested that Britain would probably favor the Japanese claims on the Shandong Peninsula because Japan had done more for the Allied victory than China, Koo countered him with saying that besides for expelling the Germans from the Shandong in 1914 that Japan had done nothing for the Allied cause while Chinese coolies had dug the trenches from the fall of 1914 onward until the end of the war in 1918.

Before the Western powers and Japan, he demanded that Japan return Shandong to China. On 27 January 1919, the peace conference turned towards Asia. Makino Nobuaki of the Japanese delegation tried to lump in Shandong with the Marshall Islands, Carolina islands and the Mariana Islands, which the Allies had already agreed would go to Japan. However, it was decided to sever Shandong from the Pacific islands. The next day, Lu disappeared and Koo took charge of the Chinese delegation. At the Quai d&#x27;Orsay, Makino gave a speech making Japan&#x27;s case for the Shandong that made a poor impression owing to his haltering delivery with Wilson commenting afterwards that it had been &quot;painful&quot; to listen to Makino&#x27;s speech.

On the morning of 29 January 1919, Koo gave a rebuttal speech in English that MacMillan described as &quot;...a dazzling speech replete with learned references to international law and Latin tags&quot;. Koo argued that under international law that treaties signed under threats of violence were invalid, and as such the Sino-Japanese treaty of 25 May 1915 was invalid as China had signed under duress as Japan was threatening war if its terms were not met. He further stated that the original Sino-German treaty of 1897 was also invalid as Germany was threatening war unless the &quot;Reich&quot; was granted special rights in the Shandong. Koo stated that all the people of China were grateful to the Japanese for ending the harsh German rule over the Shandong in 1914, but noted: &quot;But grateful as they are, the Chinese delegation felt that they would be false in their duty to China and to the world if they did not object to paying their debts of gratitude by selling the birthright of their countrymen and thereby sowing the seeds of discord in the future&quot;. Koo noted that under Wilson&#x27;s 14 Points, the basis of the peace was to be national self-determination, which led him to argue that Japan had no right to the Shandong as its people were overwhelmingly Han and wanted to be part of China. Koo stated that the Shandong &quot;was the cradle of Chinese civilization, the birthplace of Confucius and Mencius and a Holy Land for the Chinese&quot;. The French Premier Georges Clemenceau praised Koo for his eloquent speech. The American secretary of state, Robert Lansing, wrote that Koo had crushed the Japanese with his speech. The Canadian prime minister, Sir Robert Borden, called Koo&#x27;s speech &quot;very able&quot;.

Clemenceau described Koo as &quot;a young Chinese cat, Parisian of speech and dress, absorbed in the pleasures of patting and pawing the mouse, even if it was reserved for the Japanese&quot;. Through mostly at odds with the Japanese delegation, Koo supported and voted for the Japanese-sponsored Racial Equality Proposal. On 12 April 1919, the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George bluntly asked Koo: &quot;Which would China prefer-to allow Japan to succeed to the German rights in Shandong as stated in the treaty between China and Germany or to recognize Japan&#x27;s position in Shandong as stipulated in the treaties between China and Japan?&quot; Koo replied in English: &quot;Both alternatives are unacceptable&quot;. Koo seized upon the 14 Points, which stated that secret treaties were invalid, to argue that the secret treaties in 1917 under which Great Britain, France and Italy all agreed to support Japan taking over the German rights in the Shandong peninsula, were invalid. Koo was greatly hurt when Lloyd George casually told him that China had made only the most &quot;minimal&quot; contributions to the Allied cause as he dismissed the work of the Chinese coolies in digging the trenches on the Western Front as unimportant. Lloyd George finally dismissed Koo&#x27;s concerns about the 21 Demands under the grounds that he never heard of the 21 Demands. On 22 April 1919, in what Koo always saw as a betrayal, Wilson—whom he had invested such hopes in—came out in support of Japanese claims on the Shandong as he stated that &quot;the war had been fought largely for the purpose of showing that treaties cannot be violated&quot; and it was &quot;better to live up to a bad treaty than tear it up&quot; as he argued that China was bound by the 1915 treaty.

Koo&#x27;s forceful advocacy of the Chinese case made him internationally famous while his status as a widower whose wife had just died of the &quot;Spanish flu&quot; conveniently ensured that he was free to marry again. The Oei family, a wealthy &quot;huaren&quot; (ethnic Chinese) family from the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia), had decided that Koo should marry Oei Hui-lan. During the last months of the Paris peace conference, Koo was often seen with Oei at dinners and social receptions. Koo&#x27;s romance with Oei, whom he showered with flowers and gifts, distracted from his work at the conference. Oei complained in her memoirs that Koo spent his days pursuing her instead of engaging in his &quot;important work as the second Chinese delegate&quot;.

On 4 May 1919, it was decided that the former German rights in the Shandong province would go to Japan, sparking the May Fourth Movement in China as hundreds of thousands of Chinese university students demonstrated against the decision. Koo found himself bombarded with telegrams from Chinese university students asking him not to sign the Treaty of Versailles if it meant ceding the Shandong, at one point receiving 7,000 such telegrams in a single day. Koo also called for an end to imperialist institutions such as extraterritoriality, tariff controls, legation guards, and lease holds. The Western powers refused his claims and, consequently, the Chinese delegation at the Paris Peace Conference was the only nation that did not sign the Treaty of Versailles at the signing ceremony. Initially, Koo had planned to sign the Treaty of Versailles as long he could insert reservations stating his government was opposed to the Japanese gaining the German rights in the Shandong. Clemenceau however told Koo that this procedure was unacceptable and that the Chinese could either sign the Treaty of Versailles or not sign. Koo was keen to have China be one of the founding members of the League of Nations, which would signify its desire to be treated as an equal by the other nations of the world. The possibility of not signing the Treaty of Versailles and being excluded from the League were major concerns for him, which led him to discover a loophole in the Treaty of St. Germain, which also included the Covenant of the League of Nations in its first section. In this way, Koo could avoid signing the Treaty of Versailles whilst he signed the Treaty of St. Germain, which made China automatically a member of the League of Nations.

Koo and Oei remained in Paris after the conference ended, and at an especially sumptuous ball attended by the elite of Paris society announced in French their engagement on 10 October 1919. By this time, many had assumed that Koo was already married to Oei as the fact that Koo&#x27;s first wife had died in January of that year was not well known.

==Political career==
Koo also was involved in the formation of the League of Nations as China&#x27;s first representative to the newly formed League. In 1921, Koo became the Chinese minister to Britain. Much to his displeasure, &quot;Punch&quot; published a ballad that &quot;welcomed&quot; Koo to London that read: &quot;&#x27;Morality, heavenly link&#x27;/I&#x27;m sure you will never taboo,/Through to it, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll &#x27;eternally drink&#x27;/Temperate Wellington Koo/It is rather malicious, I own/To play with a name that is true/But I hope you&#x27;ll condone my irreverent tone/Generous Wellington Koo&quot;. The implication of the ballad that Koo was a not a diplomat representing China who was worthy of respect, but rather just a foreigner with a &quot;funny&quot; name who existed to amuse the British greatly offended him. To make up for the slight, King George V invited Koo and his glamorous young wife, Hui-lan Oei, as the guests of honor at a reception at Buckingham Palace for the visiting King Albert I of Belgium. At the reception, the fluently English-speaking and youngish couple made a great impression on the high society of London.

In October 1921, Koo was reassigned as the Chinese minister in Washington. Koo was to represent China at the Washington Naval Conference, hence his sudden reassignment to Washington just after his arrival in London. Koo&#x27;s principal opponent at the Washington conference was Kijūrō Shidehara, the Japanese ambassador in Washington. The Washington conference proved to be Koo&#x27;s triumph as the conference ended with Japan renouncing its claims to the Shandong and the attending powers all signing the Nine-Power Treaty affirming the independence of China. After the conference, Koo returned to China a national hero.

From 1922, Koo served successively as Foreign Minister and Finance Minister. On 15 May 1924, he was the target of assassination attempt when an ornate gift package arrived at his house addressed to him, which Koo&#x27;s servants opened instead. Upon opening the package, a bomb exploded, killing one of the servants while another two were badly wounded by the blast. The man who sent the package fled to Japan, which led Koo to conclude that the Japanese were behind the attempt on his life. Later that month, Koo signed a treaty with the Soviet Union under which the Soviet Union renounced all &quot;Unequal treaties&quot; that China had signed with Imperial Russia in exchange for which Koo recognized the &quot;de facto&quot; independence of Outer Mongolia, which until then he had claimed as part of China. Koo opened up talks with the British for the return of the British colony of Weihaiwei, which the British had signed a 25-year lease on in 1898, which led Koo to argue as 1923 had already passed, the lease had expired. There was much spirited disagreements as the British were unwilling to consider returning the colony, despite the fact the 25-year lease had expired in 1923.

The talks were broken off when the warlord General Feng Yuxiang, aka &quot;the Christian General&quot; seized Beijing, forcing Koo to flee for his life. Much to Koo&#x27;s own humiliation, he was forced to take refuge in Weihaiwei. The British authorities in Weihaiwei refused Feng&#x27;s demand to hand over Koo to his men, who would almost certainly had executed him. Feng&#x27;s rule over Beijing did not last long as the capital was soon taken by the army of another warlord, Marshal Zhang Zuolin, the &quot;Old Marshal&quot; of Manchuria. With Beijing in the hands of Zhang, Koo returned to the city. Koo disliked Zhang, an illiterate bandit turned warlord who professed to be fighting to restore the &quot;Great Qing Empire&quot;, but was willing to work with him as Zhang favored diplomacy to revise the &quot;Unequal treaties&quot; instead of war, a choice of options that coincided with Koo&#x27;s own preferences. Zhang had a reputation as one of China&#x27;s most brutal warlords, but his inability to read and write led him to crave the approval of intellectuals. Zhang appointed Koo as his premier and foreign minister, hoping this would add luster to his regime and would lead to foreign governments recognizing his government. Ominously, for Zhang, the British refused to recognize his government and dropped hints that they favored the rival government based in Guangzhou led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen.

He was twice Acting Premier, in 1924 and again in 1926 during a period of chaos in Beijing under Zhang Zuolin in 1926–7. Koo was Acting Premier from 1 October 1926 and acted concurrently as Interim President. (On March 12, 1925, Sun Yat-sen died in Wellington Koo&#x27;s home in Beijing, where he had been taken when it was discovered he had incurable liver cancer.) As Foreign Minister, he often clashed with Sir Miles Lampson, the British minister-plenipotentiary in Beijing over his demands that China have the right to control its own tariffs and the end of British extraterritoriality, demands that Lampson vehemently rejected. Lampson had essentially Victorian views of China and his relations with Koo were stormy. Lampson reported to London that after one meeting that he had &quot;harangued Koo till I had exhausted my vocabulary&quot;.

He served as Premier from January until June 1927, when he resigned after Zhang organized a military government. After the Northern Expedition toppled the government in Beijing in 1928, he was briefly wanted for arrest by the new Nationalist government in Nanjing, but through Zhang Xueliang&#x27;s mediation he was reconciled with the new government and returned to the diplomatic service. He represented China at the League of Nations to protest the Japanese invasion of Manchuria.

Much to Koo&#x27;s fury, the British Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon, was able to insist the League not take action against Japan, and instead appoint a commission to examine whether Japan had committed aggression or not. Koo was assigned to the League&#x27;s Lytton Commission-so called after its chairman, Lord Lytton-that was sent in December 1931 to go to Manchuria to investigate if Japan was an aggressor or not.

==Ambassador in Paris==
In August 1932, Koo arrived in Paris as the Chinese minister-plenipotentiary. Koo also concurrently served as the chief of the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations when it was holding its sessions in Geneva.

When Lord Lytton finally presented his report to the League in February 1933 concluding that Japan had indeed committed aggression, it was the subject of much debate within the League. In March 1933, Koo gave what was described as a very strong speech, urging the League to finally act against Japan, now that it was established by the Lytton commission that Japan had committed aggression. The Japanese delegate to the League, Yōsuke Matsuoka, promptly announced that his government did not accept the Lytton report and was leaving the League, effective immediately.

During the Abyssinia Crisis caused by the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1935, Koo was a strong supporter of having the League of Nations apply sanctions against Italy, believing this was a hopeful precedent that might led to the nations that belonged to the League supporting China should Japan invade. In May 1936, the Italians took the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa and Benito Mussolini proclaimed victory in Rome. Though the Italians never fully controlled the Ethiopian countryside, the conquest of Ethiopia was a major blow to the prestige of the League of Nations. Koo wrote at the time that at the League&#x27;s headquarters in Geneva there was &quot;a general sickening atmosphere at the impotence and cowardice&quot; of the League in face of the Italian aggression against Ethiopia. On a more hopeful note for Koo, he met the Soviet foreign commissar Maxim Litvinov who often attended the sessions of the League and discussed with him the possibility of Soviet aid to China.

In 1936, France and China upgraded their relations from the legation to embassy level, and Koo thus became the first Chinese ambassador to France. Fluent in French, Koo and his wife tried very hard to join the high society of Paris, believing it was the best way to make China&#x27;s case to the French elite. At one party, a French society hostess who believed him to the Japanese ambassador told him: &quot;Japan is a big power, becoming more powerful by the day. You will surely be able to shallow up China&quot;. Koo was forced to tell her that he was actually the Chinese ambassador and the last thing he wanted to see was his country being &quot;shallowed up&quot; by Japan. Likewise, Madame Koo tried to leave a party by asking her hosts to call for her chauffeur and her limousine, only for the Japanese ambassador&#x27;s limousine and chauffeur to appear, as her hosts did not know the difference between Japanese and Chinese. Koo&#x27;s two teenage sons embarrassed him by throwing deck chairs in a lake in a Paris park, and tried to claim diplomatic immunity when a French gendarme ordered them to stop. The incident attracted much adverse comment in the French newspapers about the badly behaving sons of the Chinese ambassador who were trying to abuse diplomatic immunity.

The Chinese diplomats in Europe together with their families formed a closely knit group who frequently met to discuss matters of common concern. Koo together with Guo Taiqi (the ambassador in London), Tsiang Tingfu (the ambassador in Moscow), Tsien T&#x27;ai (the minister-plenipotentiary in Brussels) and Liang Long (the minister-plenipotentiary in Prague) formed an informal group of intellectuals-turned-diplomats who had similar values and beliefs. The Chinese diplomats stationed in Europe were all intellectuals who given up promising careers in academia to pursue careers in diplomacy in order to best serve China. Cheng Tien-fong, the ambassador in Berlin, was considered to be the &quot;weakest link&quot; amongst the Chinese diplomats with the feeling being that he was unqualified to be a diplomat.

==The Sino-Japanese war==
In July 1937, Japan invaded China. On 7 July 1937, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident occurred, and the Japanese promptly sent 5 divisions into northern China that advanced on Beijing. Koo spent many sleepless nights in the summer of 1937 as he worried deeply about the crisis. Koo met several times with diplomats from the Japanese embassy in Paris in an attempt to find a diplomatic solution, but the Japanese kept making extreme demands that Koo rejected. Koo wrote in his diary that the news from China was &quot;depressing&quot; as he expressed dismay at the news that the Japanese had taken Beijing, adding in &quot;I felt no face to see anybody. China has become a joke&quot;. Koo broke off talks with the Japanese who had rejected his demand that Beijing be returned to China. Koo wrote in his diary that reports that the Japanese were heavily bombing Tianjin &quot;made his hair stand up&quot; with fear. Later that same month, the Japanese took Tianjin, which Koo called his diary the &quot;most depressing and sickening news&quot;.

As China had hardly an arms industry at the time and needed to import arms, the Chinese were at a disadvantage against the better armed Japanese, whose more industrialized nation did have an arms industry. Koo&#x27;s principal duty in Paris was to secure the supply of arms into China via a railroad that ran from the French colony of Indochina (modern Vietnam) into China. The arms that were carried into China were not just French, but also came from the Soviet Union. Several times, the French cabinet considered closing the railroad following complaints from the Japanese embassy in Paris and dark hints that Japan might invade Indochina if the railroad were not closed, but Koo was always able to persuade the French to keep the railroad running. Koo felt that the best response to the Japanese invasion was a Sino-Soviet alliance with &quot;Anglo-American-French material co-operation in the background&quot;. Koo believed that as the victors of World War I that both Britain and France had a vested interest in upholding the international order created after that war with &quot;the moral sympathy and support of the United States&quot;. Koo argued that the Franco-Soviet alliance provided for a certain stability in Europe, and the lack of the same stability in Asia was what explained why &quot;Japan could run amuck&quot;. Koo felt it was in their own interests of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States to support China, and he was gravely disappointed when he discovered that his viewpoint was not as widely shared as he had assumed.

As the chief of the Chinese delegation, Koo went to Geneva to lodge a formal complaint at the League of Nations, arguing that Japan was guilty of aggression and the League should impose sanctions on Japan, just as it had imposed sanctions on Italy for its aggression against Ethiopia in 1935. Koo did not expect the League to take action, and the failure of the League to save Ethiopia was hardly an auspicious precedent. However, Koo thought an appeal to the League might win public sympathy in the West. At a meeting with the French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos, Koo learned that the French &quot;advised delay&quot;. Koo in turn told Delbos: &quot;The aggression of Japan against China was too flagrant, and if the League should refuse to take cognizance of it, the League would become a complete farce&quot;. Delbos cynically told Koo that the League was useless and that &quot;You might as well call for the moon for help as much as the League of Nations&quot;. In September 1937, Koo gave a speech to the League, asking for Japan to be declared the aggressor. Koo reported to Nanjing that it was clear that &quot;the League could not do much&quot; and that &quot;the matter hinged with Britain and France&quot;, the two veto-holding members of the League Council. Both the British and French delegations advised Koo not to ask for sanctions against Japan, warning that the United States was not a member of the League and that sanctions against Japan would only work if the Americans also applied sanctions. Koo himself thought that calling for sanctions would be a mistake as American &quot;collaboration&quot; with imposing sanctions was essential, but the Waichiaopu insisted that Koo ask for sanctions against Japan.

Koo was urged to take his case to the League&#x27;s Far Eastern Advisory Committee instead of the League Assembly, advice he was predisposed to accept. Koo wrote it &quot;was useless to force things if the powers were unwilling&quot; and it was better to &quot;work with them instead of against them&quot;. The Waichiaopu rejected his advice and ordered him to make a case for sanctions. On 16 September 1937, Koo gave a speech at the League&#x27;s Far Eastern Advisory Committee, asking for the League to declare Japan the aggressor, impose wide-ranging sanctions to cripple the Japanese economy and provide China with economic support. In his appeal, Koo listed a number of war crimes committed by the Japanese, being careful to only quote from reports from Europeans and Americans in order to avoid accusations of bias. Speaking with great anger, Koo stated: &quot;In Tianjin, the most crowded parts of the Chinese city were bombed by Japanese aeroplanes, killing hundreds of people for no other reason than to terrorize civilians. The sight of mangled bodies and the cries of the maimed and wounded were so sickening to the hearts of the foreign Red Cross doctors that they voiced the fervent wish that the governments of the civilized Powers would make an effort to stop the carnage&quot;. As Koo had predicted, both Britain and France used their veto powers to prevent Japan from being declared the aggressor. In his speech, Koo declared that every day the Japanese were indiscriminately bombing Chinese cities, killing hundreds of innocent people and declared: &quot;Public opinion everyway in the world was indignant, and expected the League to do something&quot;. All that Koo achieved was a resolution from the League criticizing the Japanese policy of indiscriminate bombing of Chinese cities, and instead asked for the Japanese to engage in discriminate bombing of Chinese military targets.

On 1 October 1937, at a meeting of the Far Eastern Advisory Committee, the British delegate to the League, C.A. Edmond, announced that his government wanted to see a Nine-Power conference to be held in Brussels about seeking a diplomatic solution to the Sino-Japanese war. Koo wrote the British offer &quot;fell like a bomb, deafening the senses&quot;. In an attempt to involve the United States, the British resolution called all the powers that signed the Nine-Power Treaty of 1922 (which included the United States) to attend a conference in Brussels to discuss a solution to the war. On 5 October 1937, the Far Eastern Advisory Committee submitted to the League Assembly a resolution criticizing the Sino-Japanese war in general without saying which power was responsible, and merely asked that all of the League members not to take any steps that might weaken China&#x27;s ability to resist. Koo was dissatisfied with the attempt to shift the onus on action from the League to the signatory powers of the Nine-Power Treaty, saying that: &quot;the Washington Treaty cannot relieve League members of their obligations under the Covenant&quot;. Koo was chosen to head the Chinese delegation to the Brussels conference, which took place in November 1937. Koo believed that American involvement in the Brussels conference signaled a determination on the part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt to take action, saying he believed that &quot;the United States...would not like to see the conference fail and admit defeat&quot;. However, Koo&#x27;s hopes were dashed by a meeting with William Christian Bullitt Jr., the American ambassador to France, who was a close friend of President Roosevelt. Koo was warned that the United States was unwilling to take a leadership role at the conference and would prefer that Koo not attend to provide &quot;full liberty of discussion&quot;. Before departing, Koo told Delbos: &quot;China did not want peace at any price, but only peace with justice&quot;. In the meantime, the Japanese had threatened to bomb French Indochina if the French continued to allow arms to be imported into China. On 17 October 1937, Koo was informed that France would continue to allow arms to be sold to China, but none could be taken in via the Indochinese railroad, which in effect cut China off from French arms. In response to vehement criticism from Koo, the French reversed their position and agreed to reopen the railroad, albeit on a &quot;temporary&quot; basis.

On 31 October 1937, Koo left Paris for Brussels, and his train took him through a number of battlefields of World War One. Koo later wrote that as he watched from his train the still recovering French countryside that it &quot;led me to reflect that although the youthfulness of the trees and the relative newness of the buildings still told the story of the war, the world had learned little from it. A new war was in the atmosphere everywhere&quot;. On November 3, 1937, the conference opened and Koo gave a speech accusing Japan of aggression. Japan was invited to attend the conference, but the Japanese chose to boycott it instead. Norman Davis, the head of the American delegation, took the viewpoint that it was up to Britain and France to confront Japan and that the United States would only do the barest minimum possible to restrain Japan. Koo who had expected more of the Americans was deeply discouraged. The French were only prepared to act if the United States was willing to take the lead as the French saw Franco-American co-operation in Asia as a way of bringing the United States into European affairs to restrain Germany. The British likewise would only act in Asia if the United States were willing to take the lead. On 12 November 1937, Japan issued a statement firmly ruling out taking part in the Brussels conference and refused the offer of mediation, claiming that the war was a defensive struggle as the Japanese maintained that China was the aggressor. After the conference, Koo met with the American and British delegations, saying that all he wanted was for the United States and the United Kingdom to ship arms on a massive scale to China while offering up a &quot;guarantee&quot; to protect French Indochina from a Japanese attack. Koo argued that: &quot;just as domestic order requires more than laws on the statute books, mere words are insufficient to restore peace and order in the face of international violence&quot;. At a press conference, Koo stated that at the conference Britain had acted like a &quot;friend&quot; towards China while the United States had not, a remark that infuriated Davis. However, Koo continued to invest his hopes in the United States, writing &quot;that the United States could save the situation if it only act quickly and energetically&quot;.

In December 1937, Koo&#x27;s spirits sank to a new low by the news that the Japanese had taken Nanjing, the capital of China, which was promptly followed up by the infamous Nanjing Massacre. That same month, the Japanese sank the American gunboat U.S.S. &quot;Panay&quot; on the Yangtze river and in the process killed several American sailors. Koo hoped that the &quot;Panay&quot; incident might lead to the United States taking action against Japan, and he was disappointed when Roosevelt chose instead to accept the Japanese apology that the sinking of the &quot;Panay&quot; was a mistake, despite the fact the &quot;Panay&quot; was flying the US flag at the time the Japanese aircraft bombed the gunboat. Koo noted in his reports that the French were worried that keeping the Indochinese railroad open would lead to a Japanese invasion of Indochina. Koo countered this thesis by arguing that if the Japanese conquered China, it would be likely that they would try to conquer Indochina, and it was in France&#x27;s own interest to assist China. Despite their fears, the Indochinese railroad remained open.

==From the Sudetenland crisis to the Danzig crisis==
During the Sudetenland crisis of 1938, Koo favored having the idea of deterring Germany from invading Czechoslovakia by involving the League of Nations, whose charter called for &quot;collective security&quot; in the event of aggression. Koo believed that this represented a precedent that could be applied to China. The French cabinet minister that Koo was most close to was Georges Mandel, the minister of the colonies. As the colonial minister, Mandel was in charge of French Indochina and thus had the power to allow or deny arm shipments to China. By contrast, Koo had difficult relations with Georges Bonnet, the foreign minister who was in favor of ceasing arm shipments to China to improve relations with Japan. Through Mandel did not always the authority, he continued to allow Soviet arms to be transshipped via Indochina to China over the protests of both Bonnet and the Japanese. Koo reported that through the French Premier Édouard Daladier did not always support the anti-appeasement faction in his cabinet led by Mandel, but that Daladier was sympathetic towards China and overruled Bonnet when he pressed to have the Indochinese railroad closed. French premiers in the Third Republic had powers analogous to the chairmen of a committee as cabinets in the Third Republic were coalition governments. The Daladier cabinet was divided into three factions with the &quot;peace lobby&quot; (appeasement) faction led by Bonnet; the &quot;firmness&quot; (anti-appeasement) faction led by Mandel; and Daladier leading another faction that rested uneasily between the other two.

The ambassador that Koo spoke with the most was William Christian Bullitt Jr., the American ambassador to France. Bullitt was a close friend of President Franklin D. Roosevelt who had appointed him ambassador to France in 1936 to serve as his personal representative in Paris as Bullitt completely by-passed the Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, and instead sent his reports straight to the president, whom he also spoke to by telephone at least once every week. Koo had hopes that speaking to Bullitt would influence Roosevelt. In July 1938 when the Treasury Secretary, Henry Morgenthau Jr., visited Paris, Bullitt introduced him to Koo, whom spoke about the need for American economic aid to China. Through Morgenthau could make no promises on behalf of Congress, he promised to use his influence in Washington to lobby for financial aid to China.

In September 1938, Koo attended the fall session of the League of Nations in Geneva, where he pressed for sanctions against Japan. In his speech, Koo complained at the previous sessions of the League in September 1938 and in May 1938, all China had received were &quot;nicely-worded resolutions&quot;, going on to say &quot;The resolutions remain nothing, but empty words.&quot; Citing the Sudetenland crisis, both the British and French delegations asked for Koo not to speak about the Sino-Japanese war, saying this was not an opportune time to speak of the issue, but Koo ignored their objections.

After the Munich Agreement, Koo reported to Chongqing that Germany was now the dominant power in eastern Europe, which he felt had important ramifications for China. Koo wrote that the result of the Sudetenland crisis had badly damaged the prestige of France, which led him to predicate that the French would become more preoccupied with European affairs at the expense of Asian affairs. Koo wrote that the way that Czechoslovakia—a major French ally since 1924—had been forced to accept a highly unfavorable settlement in the form of the Munich Agreement, had left France&#x27;s other allies in eastern Europe such as Poland, Yugoslavia and Romania &quot;fearful&quot; of the future. Koo predicated that the French would either accept eastern Europe as being in the German sphere of influence or make an attempt to retain influence in eastern Europe by strengthening their existing alliances, arguing that the latter was the more likely of the two scenarios. Koo described the British prime minister Neville Chamberlain as an &quot;old man&quot; who ignored &quot;obligations under international law or the principle of international morality&quot; during the crisis. Koo wrote that Chamberlain wanted to revive the 19th century Concert of Europe by creating an Anglo-German duumvirate that would &quot;dominate and control the smaller and weaker powers&quot;. Koo argued that Chamberlain&#x27;s attempts to create an Anglo-German dominated new Concert of Europe had finished off the League of Nations as a force in world politics and would have a disastrous impact on Anglo-Soviet relations, which had never been friendly to begin with. Finally, Koo concluded that Joseph Stalin was angry at the way that the Soviet Union had been snubbed during the Sudetenland crisis, which he argued would focus Soviet attention on Europe at the expense of Asia. He felt that the possibility of an Anglo-German new Concert of Europe would greatly strain Anglo-Soviet relations. Koo stated that he believed that the Soviet Union would never a risk a war with Japan as long as Germany continued to expand into Eastern Europe and would hence limit the amount of aid it would provide China to avoid a war with Japan, through he also predicated that the Soviets would not cut off aid to China as they preferred to keep the Japanese engaged in the war.

On 3 November 1938, the Japanese Prime Minister, Prince Fumimaro Konoe, called a press conference in Tokyo where he proclaimed the &quot;New Order in Asia&quot; as he made a statement to the effect that Japan was now the hegemonic power in Asia and that China was in the Japanese sphere of influence. The American, British and French governments all issued statements rejecting the Japanese claim to the &quot;New Order in Asia&quot;, which encouraged Koo. Koo was especially encouraged by the American statement, which he felt reflected &quot;a hardening of the American attitude vis-á-vis Japan&quot;. Koo noted that the French were still permitting military supplies to be sent to China through French Indochina, and his thesis that helping China was a way of helping France by keeping the Japanese engaged was winning him friends in Paris.

On 15 March 1939, Germany occupied the Czech part of Czecho-Slovakia, creating the Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia. In response, a new Anglo-French policy of creating a &quot;peace front&quot; to deter Germany from further aggression was inaugurated. During the Danzig crisis, Koo supported the policy of the &quot;peace front&quot;, believing that it would benefit China by preventing a war in Europe that would benefit Japan by distracting Anglo-French attention away from Asia. Koo tried to associate China with the &quot;peace front&quot;, arguing that supporting China would benefit both Britain and France by keeping the Japanese engaged in China, which in turn would limit the possibility of the Japanese attacking the British and French colonies in Asia. Koo described Japan as a nation bent &quot;on the conquest of China, subjection of Asia and finally domination of the world&quot;. Somewhat paradoxically, Koo found himself defending the &quot;unequal treaties&quot; that he was normally opposed to as he argued to French leaders that the Japanese conquest of China would &quot;make it impossible to safeguard legitimate western rights and interests, and that respect for China&#x27;s sovereignty and maintenance of the open door&quot;.

In June 1939, Koo discovered a senior Chinese diplomat, Huang Zheng, had been selling visas to Jewish refugees from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia. Koo recorded the incident: &quot;Apparently an agreement was signed between a travel agency and the visa office of the consulate-general to secure Chinese government passports for Jews who had fled by the hundreds, if not the thousands, from the Fascist- and Nazi-dominated parts of Europe...and the applicants were charged 800 francs upon receiving a visa, which was well above the regular fee, and, as was reported to me, the money was divided between one certain travel agency, through which only the Jewish applicants could get the passports from the consulate-general annex, and the Chinese consulate-general. It was evidently an illicit, unauthorized and unjustifiable attempt by the issuing group to exploit the situation of the Jews&quot;.

Huang was suspended and the Waichiaopu told Koo that the visas were invalid. The leaders of several French Jewish groups met with Koo to ask him to lobby the Waichiaopu to allow the Jewish refugees to travel with the visas, arguing that though Huang was corrupt, that the refugees had purchased the visas in good faith to escape Europe. Koo did press the Waichiaopu to allow the Jewish refugees to go to China. On 22 June 1939, Koo stated he read reports in the French press of a plan to settle Jewish refugees in Yunnan province, leading him to ask his superiors what was the Chinese attitude towards accepting Jewish refugees. Koo also noted the refugees wanted to settle in Shanghai, which was the largest and wealthiest city in China, and which had been occupied by the Japanese in November 1937. Koo argued it was not clear if the Japanese would actually allow the Jews to settle in Shanghai, but that allowing Jewish refugees to travel to Shanghai with visas issued by the Republic of China was an important symbolic gesture that the Republic was still the legitimate government of all China.

==War in Europe==
On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland and on 3 of September, Britain and France declared war on Germany. Koo wrote in his diary on 3 September 1939: &quot;These are momentous days in history, the beginning of a war which may alter the face of the world and of civilization itself&quot;. Shortly afterwards, Koo suggested in a message to Chiang Kai-shek that China formally declared its wish to align with the Allied powers and to offer Chinese resources and manpower to aid the Allied cause in Europe. On 30 November 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Finland, leading to calls to expel the Soviet Union from the League of Nations. At the session of the League Assembly when a vote was taken to expel the Soviet Union, Koo as the chief of the Chinese delegation chose to abstain from the vote, which ended with the Soviet Union become the first and only member to be expelled from the League.

On 18 June 1940, the Japanese submitted an ultimatum threatening to invade Indochina if the French did not end all arms sales to China at once. On 20 June 1940, the government of Philippe Pétain submitted to the ultimatum and ended all arms sales to China. On 21 June 1940, an armistice was signed, taking France out of the war. Koo briefly served as the Chinese ambassador in Vichy, where he was forced to live under reduced conditions. Under the armistice signed on 21 June 1940, Germany imposed harsh reparations on France while the franc was artificially devalued in regard to the &quot;Reichsmark&quot;, which essentially allowed the occupiers to loot France. Owing to the shortage of food in occupied France, Koo&#x27;s wife observed that he was forced to eat canned food for the first time in his entire life. Koo spent the rest of the summer of 1940, trying to persuade Vichy officials to resume arms shipments. Koo reported to Chongqing that France was &quot;powerless&quot; in Asia as he stated that he had information on good authority that the Germans had ordered that the French should not &quot;provoke&quot; the Japanese. In July 1940, the British submitted to a Japanese ultimatum and closed the Burma Road, though the road was reopened again in October 1940. In September 1940, the Japanese occupied the northern half of French Indochina. For Koo, the only hopeful news that the United States reacted sharply to the Japanese advance into Indochina, warning Tokyo that this was regarded in Washington as an extremely unfriendly act, and that the Japanese should not occupy the southern half of French Indochina under any conditions.

==Ambassador in London==

In 1941, Koo was appointed Chinese ambassador in London. He remained the Chinese ambassador to the Court of St James&#x27;s until 1946. Koo decided that wartime London was too dangerous for his family to live, and sent his wife and children to New York. Madame Koo had wanted to go to London and went to New York most unwillingly. Many in the Foreign Office disliked Koo as one of Britain&#x27;s &quot;bitterest enemies&quot; in the 1920s, charging that he was a Chinese nationalist who rejected the &quot;white man&#x27;s burden&quot; view of Britain&#x27;s role in the world. Koo&#x27;s main role in London was in seeking British support for China and especially to ensure that the British did not close the Burma Road, which was China&#x27;s lifeline following the closure of the French railroad to China. In July 1941, the Japanese occupied the southern half of French Indochina, giving Japan the ability to project air and naval power well into the South China Sea. In response, the American, British and Dutch governments imposed an oil embargo on Japan and froze all Japanese assets in their countries. The Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden chose not to inform Koo of these steps, who first learned of these British moves from reading the newspapers. Koo was deeply worried about a possible Japanese invasion of Burma, which would close the Burma Road. Koo pressed for more British aid to China, only to be told that the British were fully committed to the struggle against Germany and had little to spare to assist China. In the summer and fall of 1941, Koo offered to have Chinese troops sent to reinforce the garrison in Hong Kong, only to be politely rebuffed as the Foreign Office told him that the existing Anglo-Indian-Canadian garrison could hold Hong Kong against any Japanese attack.

Following the Japanese attack on the British empire in December 1941, the Japanese invaded the British colony of Burma in January 1942 from Thailand. As an ambassador in London, Koo played a critical role in the talks that saw the British grant the Chinese permission to send two armies into Burma to assist the British in the defense of Burma. The British prime minister, Winston Churchill, was opposed to accepting the Chinese offer, preferring that Burma be defended by only British troops or Indian troops under the command of British officers. Much to Koo&#x27;s pleasure, the dire situation in Burma with the British being defeated by an invading Japanese force that consisted of only 2 divisions forced Churchill to accept the Chinese offer of help. For Koo, the fact that Britain was being forced to accept Chinese help symbolized how the Second World War was changing the face of world politics. However, the Chinese intervention did not stem the Japanese advance and by May 1942 the Japanese had occupied all of Burma, reaching the frontiers of India.

Koo noted that the Japanese victories in southeast Asia were further cutting off China from the rest of the world, but at least had the benefit of making British officials more respectful as he noted after the fall of Singapore, the British lost their customary disdain for Asians. The way that only four divisions of the Imperial Japanese Army who despite being outnumbered three to one by an Anglo-Indian-Australian force opposing them had been able to conquer Malaya and Singapore, billed at the time as the &quot;Gibraltar of the East&quot;, in less than two months both astonished and shocked British officials. Koo noted that though Churchill was firmly committed to the &quot;Europe First&quot; strategy that the Japanese victories in southeast Asia that had pushed the Imperial Japanese Army right to the frontiers of India increased the importance of keeping China in the war. From 1937 to 1945, 38 of the 51 divisions of the Imperial Japanese Army were fighting in China with only 9 divisions being used for the conquest of southeast Asia in late 1941 and early 1942. In December 1941, the Japanese sent 1 division to conquer the British colony of Hong Kong; 4 divisions to conquer the British colonies of Malaya and Singapore; another 2 divisions to conquer the American colony of the Philippines; another 3 divisions to conquer the Dutch colony of the Netherlands East Indies (modern Indonesia); and finally assigned 2 divisions to the conquest of the British colony of Burma. The Special Landing Force of the Imperial Japanese Navy was assigned the task of taking Wake island and Guam. From the British perspective, it was crucial that the Chinese continued to fight the Japanese, which improved the Chinese bargaining position in London. Koo noted that paradoxically the Allied defeats in 1941–1942 had improved China&#x27;s bargaining position as both the British and the Americans very much wanted to keep the Chinese fighting in order to keep the 38 Japanese divisions in China from being used against their forces.

Koo also pressed hard to end the 19th century &quot;unequal treaties&quot; and especially wanted the end of British extraterritorial rights in China. On 11 January 1943, Koo signed in London a new Sino-British treaty that saw Britain renounce all of its extraterritorial rights in China, through the British refused to return Hong Kong as the Chinese had wanted. Through Koo failed to secure the return of Hong Kong, he called the new Sino-British treaty in his diary &quot;a really an epoch-making event—the biggest treaty in a century&quot;. In 1943, Madame Koo and her children finally arrived in London, but this time a rift had developed in the marriage as Koo was most unhappy with the ghost-written autobiography that his wife had just published prior to leaving New York.

In 1943, Chiang Kai-shek visited India, where he caused a storm in the British press by his statements in favor of Indian independence, saying he wanted to see India &quot;free now and independent after the war&quot;. However, Chiang also voiced support for India continuing in the war as he warned that the Japanese were not liberators, and stated he envisioned a free India as an ally of China against Japan, which Chiang called a brutally imperialistic power. Chiang ordered Koo to provide him with an assessment of British public opinion regarding India. Chiang also instructed Koo that his answers to the British protests regarding his statements were to state that China wanted India to be granted Dominion status, which he believed would lead to the Indians of their own choice continuing the war. Koo reported that on the basis of statements made in the House of Commons and in the British press that only a minority in Britain favored independence for India with the majority favoring continuing the rule of the Raj after the war. Koo followed his orders by stating to British officials that China only wanted to see India to become a Dominion, and was shocked to hear various British officials insist that to give India Dominion status would lead to &quot;twenty years of anarchy and disorder&quot;. When Koo asked why the Indians could not be trusted to govern themselves, he was told that &quot;occidental influence had only penetrated the top strata of Indian society&quot;. The Foreign Office officials told Koo that they thought that China was suffering from a &quot;persecution complex&quot;. Koo met Churchill at 10 Downing street, where he found the prime minister to be &quot;a little peeved and sullen&quot;. Churchill told Koo that &quot;the British were not decadent and defeatist&quot; as was being said in the Chinese newspapers, and then returned to a genial mood.

In late July 1943, the Chinese Foreign Minister, T. V. Soong, visited London, where he met with Eden and Koo to discuss plans for a British offensive from India into Burma with the aim of reopening the Burma Road. Soong reported to Chiang that based on his talks with Eden and Koo that the British did not regard China as a serious military power and that Churchill was far interested in the war against Germany than with Japan. Soong&#x27;s assumptions were proved correct when he met with Churchill on 4 August 1943. Churchill listed a number of ways to defeat Japan such as a strategical bombing offensive, having the Soviet Union declare war on Japan, invading Japan via the Aleutian islands, and an offensive by the Chinese, but notably did not mention any offensive into Burma. After the Cairo conference of 1943, Eden told Koo that he rather liked Chiang and his American-educated wife, Soong Mei-ling, who served as his translator as Chiang only spoke Mandarin. Koo reported to Chongqing that Eden was the only member of the British cabinet who was sympathetic towards China, and expressed regret that Eden was not the prime minister, writing that Anglo-Chinese relations would be much better if Eden instead of Churchill were the prime minister. Wang Shih-chieh, a member of Chiang&#x27;s staff, told Koo after the Cairo conference that Chiang and Churchill disliked each other, and Roosevelt was forced to play the peace-maker. Eden told Koo that Churchill had tried to explain British grand strategy to Chiang as he maintained that the British were committed to defeating Japan, but had to devote most of their resources towards the war against Germany as the British were fighting in Italy and were due to take part in an invasion of France the next year. Most notably, Churchill had changed his position, agreeing that the Anglo-Indian-African 14th Army would launch an offensive into Burma in 1944, but Chiang continued to mistrust him, believing that Churchill was not being sincere.

Unlike Chiang, who had a deep mistrust of Britain, Koo favored an Anglo-Chinese alliance after the war, preferably with the United States also joining. During a visit to China in 1943, Koo told Chiang that Churchill was strongly anti-communist and did not expect the wartime alliance with Soviet Union to continue after the war. Koo stated he felt with the long-standing vexatious issue of extraterritorial rights finally settled in China&#x27;s favor, it would be possible to make an alliance with the United Kingdom against the Soviet Union after the war. Chiang was opposed to Koo&#x27;s ideas, believing that such an alliance would limit his ability to deal with the Soviets by committing China to a rigidly anti-Soviet line, and would only agree to such an alliance if the United States also joined in, which he thought was unlikely. Chiang expected the United States to return to isolationism after the war, just as it had done after the First World War. Chiang told Koo that &quot;English diplomacy&quot; was &quot;shrewd and cunning&quot; and that British would &quot;adhere stubbornly to their traditional polices&quot;.

In the summer of 1944, Koo was contacted by agents of Charles de Gaulle, who wanted an agreement that China would support restoration of French rule in Indochina after the war. Koo advised Chiang to accept the French offer, stating that France would probably become a major power again after the war.

==United Nations==
In 1945, Koo was one of the founding delegates of the United Nations, and the first signer—the &quot;John Hancock&quot;—of the United Nations Charter. He later became the Chinese Ambassador to the United States and focused on maintaining the alliance between the Republic of China and the United States as the Kuomintang began losing to the Communists and had to retreat to Taiwan.

Koo retired from the Chinese diplomatic service in 1956. and in the same year he became a judge of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, and served as vice-president of the Court during the final three years of his term. In 1967, he retired and moved to New York City, where he lived until his death in 1985.

In an interview conducted in 1969 on the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Versailles, Koo stated that the Paris peace conference, which launched the May 4th movement, was a turning point in Chinese views of the West as he observed that many Chinese intellectuals believed the victorious powers of 1918 would allow China to be treated as an equal, and the outcome of the Paris peace conference had turned public opinion against the Western powers. There was a widespread feeling in China that given the suffering of the Chinese coolies on the Western Front that France, Great Britain and the United States would reward China for its sacrifices. Koo stated: &quot;Looking back at China&#x27;s stand at the Paris peace conference and the developments preceding, it appears that these events are...a turning point in China&#x27;s history, both from the domestic and international point of view...One could wonder what would be the situation in China [today] either if China had succeeded in settling the Shandong question in Paris to her satisfaction or if she had signed the treaty without the reservation. These are questions which probably can never be fully answered now&quot;. Koo noted that the new Communist government in Russia, which denounced liberalism as a device for Western imperialism and renounced all of the special Russian rights in China gained under the Tsarist regime, won tremendous prestige in China as the one power that seemed willing to treat China as an equal, which led directly to the founding of the Chinese Communist Party in 1920.

==Personal life==

In 1908, Koo married his first wife, Chang Jun-o (). They divorced in 1912.

Koo&#x27;s second wife, Tang Pao-yueh &quot;May&quot; (; c. 1895–1918), was one of the illegitimate daughters of the former Chinese prime minister Tang Shaoyi and a concubine Mai-Mai Sze. Their marriage took place soon after Koo&#x27;s return to China and divorced his first wife in 1912. She died in the U.S. during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. They had two children: a son, Teh-chang Koo (1916–1998), and a daughter, Patricia Tsien (1918–2015).
Koo&#x27;s third wife was the socialite and style icon Oei Hui-lan (1889–1992). She married Koo in Brussels, Belgium, in 1921. She was previously married, in 1909, to British consular agent Beauchamp Stoker, by whom she had one son, Lionel, before divorcing in 1920. Much admired for her adaptations of traditional Manchu fashion, which she wore with lace trousers and jade necklaces, Oei Hui-lan was the favorite daughter of &quot;Peranakan&quot; tycoon &quot;Majoor&quot; Oei Tiong Ham, and the heiress of a prominent family of the &quot;Cabang Atas&quot; or the Chinese gentry of colonial Indonesia. She wrote two memoirs: &quot;Hui-Lan Koo (Mrs. Wellington Koo): An Autobiography&quot; (written with Mary Van Rensselaer Thayer, Dial Press, 1943) and &quot;No Feast Lasts Forever&quot; (written with Isabella Taves, Quadrangle/The New York Times, 1975). Koo had two sons with her: Yu-chang Wellington Koo Jr. (1922–1975) and Fu-chang Freeman Koo (1923–1977).

On September 3, 1959, Koo married his fourth wife Yen Yu-yun (1905–2017), the widow of Clarence Kuangson Young, who had been his long-term mistress since the 1930s while her husband was still alive. He had three stepdaughters from this marriage: Genevieve (wife of American photographer and film director Gordon Parks), Shirley, and Frances Loretta Young (wife of Oscar Tang).

==Death==
Though he outlived two of his sons, Koo died surrounded by his family on the night of 14 November 1985, aged 97. Wellington Koo was survived by his fourth wife, two children, nineteen grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

Dying older than the 87-year-old Qianlong Emperor, the 87-year-old Republic of China President Chiang Kai-shek, the 92-year-old People&#x27;s Republic paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, and the 96-year-old People&#x27;s Republic paramount leader Jiang Zemin, Koo holds the distinction of being the longest-lived person to ever lead China. Despite this, both his third and fourth wives lived even longer than he did—Oei Hui-lan died at the age 103 and Juliana Koo died aged 111.

<doc id="848311" wikidata="Q1124341" url="?curid=848311" title="Harriet (tortoise)">
<text>Harriet (formerly Harry; – 23 June 2006) was a Galápagos tortoise (&quot;Chelonoidis niger&quot;, specifically a western Santa Cruz tortoise &quot;C. n. porteri&quot;) who had an estimated age of 175 years at the time of her death in Australia. Harriet is one of the longest-lived known tortoises, behind Tu&#x27;i Malila, who died in 1966 at the age of 188 or 189; Jonathan, who remains alive at an age of , and possibly Adwaita, who died in 2006 at an estimated age of between 250 and 255 years. At the time of her death, she lived at the Australia Zoo which was owned by Steve and Terri Irwin.

Harriet was reportedly collected by Charles Darwin during his 1835 visit to the Galápagos Islands as part of his round-the-world survey expedition, transported to England, and then taken to her final home, Australia, by John Clements Wickham, the retiring captain of the &quot;Beagle&quot;. However, doubt is cast on this story by the fact that Darwin had never visited Santa Cruz, the island that Harriet originally came from.

==HMS &quot;Beagle&quot;==

In August 1994, a historian from Mareeba, Ed Loveday, published a letter in the local newspaper about two tortoises he remembered at the Botanic Gardens in 1922 and that the keepers of the time were saying that the tortoises had arrived at the Gardens in 1860 as a donation from John Clements Wickham, who was the first lieutenant (and later captain) of under Fitzroy during the voyage of the &quot;Beagle&quot; in 1835.

Wickham actually brought three tortoises (named Tom, Dick and Harry) to Australia when he arrived after retiring from the Royal Navy in 1841; these lived at Newstead House from 1841 to 1860. Records show that the tortoises were donated to the Botanic Gardens in 1860 when Wickham retired as Government Resident of Moreton Bay (now Brisbane) and left Australia for Paris.

Some researchers claim that Wickham was in Australia in 1841 and did not visit England that year to pick up the tortoises. This differs from information published by Dr. C.G. Drury Clarke and others, who list him as being in England in 1841. Furthermore, the British Hydrographic Department published maps of Wickham&#x27;s surveys in 1841, indicating that he was in London that year. In addition, John Lort Stokes, who assumed command of &quot;Beagle&quot; after Wickham, explicitly states in his book &quot;Discoveries in Australia, Volume 2&quot; that Wickham departed to England after resigning his position as captain.

There is evidence from letters that Charles Darwin was aware that Wickham had these tortoises, as he sent a letter to Huxley in 1860 informing him that he should speak with Wickham in Paris about the last of the tortoises from the 1835 expedition because he had them. This makes it at least possible that the three tortoises at the Brisbane Botanic Gardens were personally collected by Darwin.

It is thought that as many as 40 tortoises were stowed aboard &quot;Beagle&quot;. Some were slaughtered for food, others were kept as souvenirs by crew members, a few as scientific specimens. Once &quot;Beagle&quot; returned to England, the care of these large creatures became burdensome, so they were adopted by a local museum. There is no evidence that Darwin kept any of them as a pet in his home.

==Harriet&#x27;s species==
Darwin definitely collected tortoises on San Cristobal, San Salvador, and Santa Maria; however, the species on Santa Maria (&quot;C. n. niger&quot;) was already nearing extinction when Darwin visited the islands, having been killed and eaten by prisoners on the prison colony there. The tortoises he collected there had been taken by the prisoners from other islands for food, and Darwin collected some of them before they could be eaten. Hence they were a mixture of subspecies from a number of islands. Harriet, as a &quot;C. n. porteri&quot;, is from Santa Cruz. One of the other tortoises (Tom) is still in the Queensland Museum and has been identified as a &quot;C. n. chathamensis&quot; (from San Cristobal). 

==Other theories==

An initial analysis of Harriet&#x27;s DNA was unable to identify her subspecies in a cross section of 900 animals representing 26 extant and extinct populations. After reanalysis she was assigned to &quot;C. n. porteri&quot;. However, her genetic diversity and other factors in her DNA sequence data indicated she was most likely at least two generations removed from the oldest specimens of her species in the dataset. The oldest &quot;C. n. porteri&quot; in the dataset were collected as adults in 1907 and, hence, this would require Harriet to be hatched by 1860.

This dating rules out many alternative possibilities for Harriet as, prior to 1900, Australia was a very difficult place to get to. There were only two imports of Galápagos tortoises prior to 1900, and four of the five animals involved have been accounted for and are still represented by museum material. The suggestion in some quarters that Harriet was collected by whalers and brought to Australia is not likely, as Australia had its own whaling industry and whaling ships from South America did not visit Australia.

The tortoises collected by Darwin were all recorded in Fitzroy&#x27;s journals of the voyage, including their measurements. As they averaged in length, and this represented an approximate age of 5 years for the species, Harriet&#x27;s year of birth was estimated by Scott Thomson to 1830, with a margin of error of two years, in the 1995 paper describing the events of Harriet&#x27;s life and the results of the research.

Some also believe that Harriet was left with the Yabsley family of Coraki who were also on the &quot;Beagle&quot;.

==Later life==
In 1874, Harriet who &quot;had been in the Botanic Garden 50 years&quot; was reported to have been regularly burying herself during the summer months.

In 1934 in the City Botanic Gardens, Harriet kicked and injured a man who prodded her with his finger. She was described &quot;as entering on its second 100 years of life&quot;.

Harriet was thought to be male for many years and was actually named Harry after Harry Oakman, the creator of the zoo at the Brisbane Botanic Gardens, but this was corrected in the 1960s by a visiting director of Hawaii&#x27;s Honolulu Zoo (as it happens, Tom, the specimen in the Queensland Museum, was also a female).
On 15 November 2005, her much-publicised 175th birthday was celebrated at Australia Zoo. This event was attended by Scott Thomson (the researcher on Harriet&#x27;s history), three generations of the Fleay family, Robin Stewart (author of &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Tortoise&quot;), and many hundreds of others who knew this tortoise during the latter part of her life.

Harriet died in her enclosure on 23 June 2006 of heart failure following a short illness.

==In popular culture==
Harriet&#x27;s story was told in Robin Stewart&#x27;s book &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Tortoise: The Amazing True Story of Harriet, the World&#x27;s Oldest Living Creature&quot;. She appears as one of the protagonists in the &quot;Curious Science Quest&quot; series of children&#x27;s time-travel adventures co-written by Julia Golding which explore the history of science. &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;″s &quot;Emma Stone/Noah Kahan&quot; (2023) episode included a skit titled &quot;Question Quest&quot;, in which Harriet was the answer to the question, &quot;What do Charles Darwin and Steve Irwin have in common?&quot;.

<text>Groombridge 1830 (also known as 1830 Groombridge or Argelander&#x27;s Star) is a star in the constellation Ursa Major.

==Description==
It is a yellow-hued class G8 subdwarf catalogued by British astronomer Stephen Groombridge with the Groombridge Transit Circle between 1806 and the 1830s and published posthumously in his star catalog, &quot;Catalogue of Circumpolar Stars&quot; (1838). Its high proper motion was noted by Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander in 1842.

It is from the Sun as measured by the Gaia spacecraft, which, as the distance is nearly 10 parsecs, means its absolute magnitude is almost equal to its apparent magnitude. It is a member of the galactic halo; such stars account for only 0.1 to 0.2 percent of the stars near the Sun. Like most halo stars, it has a low abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium—what astronomers term a metal-poor star.

Once suspected of being a binary star with a period of 175 days, current consensus is that it is single. Previous suspected observations of a stellar companion were probably &quot;superflares&quot;—analogous to the Sun&#x27;s solar flares, but hundreds to millions of times more energetic. It had one of the first nine identified superflares.

==Proper motion==
When discovered, it had the highest proper motion of any star known, replacing 61 Cygni in that department. Later it dropped to second place after the discovery of Kapteyn&#x27;s Star, and still later to third place after the discovery of Barnard&#x27;s Star. It is considerably farther away than either of those stars, however, which means its transverse velocity is greater.

<doc id="848317" wikidata="Q2905210" url="?curid=848317" title="Violence in sports">
<text>Violence in sports usually refers to violent and often unnecessarily harmful intentional physical acts committed during, or motivated by, a sports game, often in relation to contact sports such as American football, ice hockey, rugby football, lacrosse, association football, boxing, mixed martial arts, wrestling, and water polo and, when referring to the players themselves, often involving excessively violent or potentially illegal physical contact beyond the normal levels of contact expected while playing the sport. These acts of violence can include intentional attempts to injure a player or coach by another player or coach, but can also include threats of physical harm or actual physical harm sustained by players or coaches by fans or those engaging in the spectating of sports, or threats and acts of violence performed by fans or spectators upon opposing fans or other spectators.

==Causes==
There are two major theories on the cause of violence in sports. One theory holds that humans have an instinct for violence, developed during a time when early human ancestors had to resort to violence and aggressiveness to survive and reproduce. Another theory deals with the sociological aspects of violence in sports, stating that sports are &quot;mock battles&quot; which can become actual battles due to their competitive nature.

==Violence by athletes==
Through a &quot;civilizing process&quot;, many modern sports have become less tolerant of bloodshed than past versions, although many violent aspects of these sports still remain.
Athletes sometimes resort to violence, in hopes of injuring and intimidating opponents. Such incidents may be part of a strategy developed by coaches or players.

In boxing, unruly or extremely violent behavior by one of the contestants often results in the fighter breaking the rules being penalized with a points reduction, or, in extreme cases, disqualification. Outlawed tactics in boxing include hitting the opponent on the back of the head, under the belly during clinching, and to the back. Other tactics that are outlawed, but less seen, are pushing an opponent with forceful intent to the floor or ground, kicking, or hitting repeatedly after the round has ended. Similar actions have also happened in ice hockey and Australian Football League matches.

===Ritual violence===
High school, college, and even professional sports teams often include initiation ceremonies (known as hazing in the USA) as a rite of passage. A 1999 study by Alfred University and the NCAA found that approximately four out of five college US athletes (250,000 per year) experienced hazing. Half were required to take part in alcohol-related initiations, while two-thirds were subjected to humiliation rituals.

==Fan violence==

Violence may also be related to nationalism or as an outlet for underlying social tensions. It is often alcohol-related.

Violence by supporters of sports teams dates back to Roman times, when supporters of chariot racing teams were frequently involved in major riots, leading Roman authorities to frequently cancel sporting events. Usually, underlying political and/or theological issues helped fuel riots related to sporting events in the Roman era. The Nika riots of 532 were especially deadly, with tens of thousands reportedly killed.

In periods when theatre was considered a form of mass entertainment, there were phenomena of rival fans supporting rival actors or theatrical teams, occasionally leading to violent outbursts having many similarities to present-day violence of sports fans – the Astor Place Riot in 1849 New York City being a conspicuous example.

The actions of English football hooligans and firms in the 1980s caused English teams to be banned from European competition for six years after the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985. Although the level of football-related violence was significantly reduced in England after this event, in the Euro 2004 tournament, England was publicly warned that any violence by supporters at matches could result in their ejection from the tournament. Many known hooligans were prevented from traveling to the tournament in Portugal. There was a collective sigh of relief from security experts in the USA when England failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Alan Rothenberg (chairman of the World Cup organizing committee in the United States in 1994) said:

===Notable examples of fan violence===

* In AD 59, a gladiator show in Pompeii led to a riot involving residents of Pompei and neighboring Nuceria, leading to numerous deaths. After an investigation by the Roman Senate, the town of Pompeii was banned from holding gladiator shows for 10 years.
* In 532, the rivalry between supporters of the &quot;Blue&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; chariot-racing teams in Constantinople led to 30,000 deaths in the Nika riots.
* The first meeting in the American football rivalry between Brigham Young University and the University of Utah took place in April 1896, when BYU was known as Brigham Young Academy. The two schools disagree to this day as to whether this game was official, but it mattered greatly to the spectators—at the end of the game, the two sets of fans fought one another.
* In the second edition of the Tour de France in 1904, as the riders climbed the Col de la République in the Loire department, supporters of regional favorite Antoine Faure physically attacked several of his opponents. The repercussions of this incident continue to this day—the Tour did not return to Loire until 1950, and although the Tour has returned to the République (the first pass of 1,000 metres ever climbed in the Tour) 11 times since then, its appearances in the 1903 and 1904 Tours are no longer officially recognized as Tour climbs.
* In 1972, Oregon pummeled Oregon State 30–3 in their annual &quot;Civil War&quot; football rivalry game, held this season at Oregon State&#x27;s Parker Stadium. After the game, jubilant Oregon fans rushed the field and tore down the south goal post. They then turned to do the same to the north goal post, but were met by Oregon State fans who had come on the field, resulting in a major brawl.
* In 1975, cyclist Eddy Merckx was viciously punched by a spectator as he climbed the Puy-de-Dôme in the Tour de France. Merckx, who had won the Tour de France five times previously and at the time was in the leader&#x27;s yellow jersey, finished the stage barely able to breathe, and went on to finish the tour in second place overall.
* The 1980 Scottish Cup Final between bitter Old Firm rivals Celtic and Rangers was marred by an on-pitch riot between rival fans. The result was the banning of alcohol from Scottish football and rugby matches.
* After Marvin Hagler knocked out Alan Minter in three rounds to win boxing&#x27;s world middleweight title at Wembley Arena in 1980, many of Minter&#x27;s supporters began to throw beer cans, bottles and other objects into the ring. Both Hagler and Minter, along with their respective handlers, had to be escorted out by Scotland Yard.
* On August 12, 1984, during a game between the Atlanta Braves and San Diego Padres that degenerated into a beanball war:
** At least five fans were dragged from the field at Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium in handcuffs after participating in a bench-clearing brawl.
** One of the fans was charged with assault for throwing a full beer mug at the Padres&#x27; Kurt Bevacqua, hitting him in the head, as he was returning to the dugout.
** The game ended with police riot squads on top of both dugouts in an obvious attempt to keep fans away from the players.
* At the end of the same season, violence erupted outside of Tiger Stadium in Detroit after the Detroit Tigers defeated the Padres in the World Series. A well known photo from the riot shows a Tigers fan holding a World Series pennant in front of an overturned burning Detroit Police car.
* Heysel Stadium disaster – 39 people died when a wall collapsed under pressure of Juventus supporters fleeing from &#x27;football hooligans&#x27; supporting Liverpool during the 1985 European Cup Final.
* Dinamo–Red Star riot – a 1990 football match between Red Star Belgrade and Dinamo Zagreb was abandoned after ten minutes with thousands of fans fighting each other and the police. One of the Zagreb players, Zvonimir Boban, was seen to kick a policeman, and after an hour long riot, the stadium was set on fire. Dinamo fans saw the riot as the beginning of the Croatian War of Independence.
* In 1993, a mentally ill tennis fan stabbed Monica Seles during a changeover at a tennis match in Germany.
* In 1994, Vancouver Canucks fans rioted in the streets of Vancouver after their team lost in the Stanley Cup finals.
* During the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Colombian football (soccer) player Andrés Escobar accidentally scored an own goal in a match against the United States, a match which Colombia lost 2–1. On his return to Colombia, Escobar was confronted outside a bar in Medellín by a gunman who shot the player six times, killing him. The gunman reportedly shouted &quot;¡Gol!&quot; (&quot;Goal!&quot;) for each bullet fired.
* Rioting Indian fans at the Eden Gardens stadium in Calcutta forced the end of the semi-final match between India and Sri Lanka during the 1996 Cricket World Cup. Fans started rioting when the home team, seemingly on the way to victory, underwent a dramatic batting collapse. Match referee Clive Lloyd brought the teams off the ground for their safety, then attempted to restart the match. When the fans remained throwing projectiles and damaging stadium facilities, the match was called off and awarded to Sri Lanka (who went on to win the World Cup).
* In 1996 during a night Australian Football League match at Waverley Park in Melbourne between Essendon and St Kilda, a pitch invasion occurred when the lights went out during the third quarter. Initially, a serious car crash into power lines in the nearby area was reported to have caused the blackout, although it was later confirmed to be a major electrical fault. In the midst of the chaos, fans rioted and stormed the ground, some lighting bonfires in the centre square, and removing two of the behind posts. The incidents were filmed on Network Seven, and the remaining quarter and a half was played three nights later.
* In 1998, Denver Broncos fans rioted in the streets of Denver after their team won Super Bowl XXXII. Near-riots happened when the team won the Super Bowl again the following year and after the Colorado Avalanche&#x27;s Stanley Cup wins in 1996 and 2001.
* A similar incident occurred in Oakland, California in 2003 when fans rioted and destroyed property after the Oakland Raiders lost to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl XXXVII.
* In July 2000, 13 people were trampled to death in a riot at a 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying match in Harare, Zimbabwe after South Africa took a 2–0 lead over Zimbabwe.
* In June 2000, Los Angeles Lakers fans stormed the streets of Los Angeles after the Lakers&#x27; victory over the Indiana Pacers in the 2000 NBA Finals. Fans briefly celebrated by starting bonfires, but it soon turned into a riot, with fans dancing and stomping on parked cars, and even turning a news van over.
* In May 2001 during an Australian Football League match between Geelong and Carlton at Optus Oval, Geelong&#x27;s Darren Milburn executed a very late and illegal bump on Carlton&#x27;s Steven Silvagni, collecting Silvagni&#x27;s head with his hip, knocking Silvagni unconscious and leaving him having to be carried from the field by trainers. Milburn then proceeded to clap towards the crowd after being substituted, further igniting the situation; Carlton fans threatened Milburn, attempted to enter the interchange box to assault him, and attempted to attack Milburn&#x27;s police escort in the car park after the match. Milburn was suspended for three matches for the incident.
* In May 2004 after an Australian Football League Friday Night Football match between Adelaide and St Kilda at AAMI Stadium which St Kilda won by 32 points, field umpires were booed and abused by Adelaide fans, and a drink bottle was thrown which hit a 12-year-old St Kilda fan. One fan was ejected and banned for one year from the arena.
* In September 2004 in the Cairns Australian Football League Grand Final between the North Cairns Tigers and the Port Douglas Crocs at Cazaly&#x27;s Stadium, a wild and violent 15 minute bench-clearing brawl erupted after Tigers players charged at the Crocs pre-match huddle at the end of the national anthem, and escalated when fans and team officials became involved. One fan was arrested and another five were ejected, while three Crocs players and a Crocs runner were left unconscious and having to be carried from the arena on stretchers. After a lengthy AFL investigation, the instigator, North Cairns Tigers coach and former VFL/AFL player Jason Love, was suspended for eight years, and the 22 North Cairns players were suspended for a total of 400 matches (suspensions ranging from 10 matches to five years) on a string of charges in relation to starting the brawl; the Tigers were forced to forfeit their first match of 2005 as a result of these suspensions. AFL Cairns declared the Grand Final a &quot;no result&quot; and withheld the 2004 premiership.
* In October 2004, after the Boston Red Sox defeated the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium in Game 7 of the American League Championship Series, Red Sox fans rioted near Fenway Park in Boston. Police used &quot;pepper guns&quot; in some cases, and an Emerson College student, Victoria Snelgrove, was killed by a paintball-like projectile that hit her in the eye.
* On November 19, 2004, near the end of an NBA game between the Indiana Pacers and Detroit Pistons, a brawl erupted between Pacers players and Pistons supporters.
* On April 12, 2005, the UEFA Champions League quarterfinal between intracity rivals A.C. Milan and Inter Milan was abandoned after Inter fans threw missiles and flares on to the pitch at the San Siro stadium, with A.C. Milan goalkeeper Dida hit by a flare.
* In May 2006 during an Australian Football League match between North Melbourne and St Kilda, a North Melbourne fan had a provocative confrontation with coach Dean Laidley, to which Laidley responded with a verbal barrage, inviting the fan to the club rooms to see how badly the players were feeling due to their consistently poor on-field performance. The incident was captured on Australian national television. The fan committed suicide by throwing himself in the path of an oncoming train the next morning.
* On June 6, 2010, the final game of the Greek Basket League finals between ancient rivals Olympiacos and Panathinaikos (PAO), also respectively known as the &quot;Reds&quot; and &quot;Greens&quot; from their club colors, degenerated into what one commentator called a &quot;night of shame&quot; for Greek basketball. Panathinaikos entered the game, held at Olympiacos&#x27; home of Peace and Friendship Stadium, with a 2–1 lead in the best-of-5 series. The homestanding Reds fans were reportedly incensed at what they considered to be biased officiating in the Greens&#x27; favor in Game 3. The violence began even before tipoff, with police forced to use tear gas on rioting Reds fans; the game started 40 minutes late. In the third quarter, with PAO leading 50–42, the game was halted for about an hour after Olympiacos fans threw various incendiaries at the PAO bench, with one smoke bomb exploding next to the bench. By the time the teams resumed play, all but about 2,000 fans had left. Then, with little over a minute left in the game and PAO ahead 76–69, many of the remaining Reds fans began throwing objects on the court, leading the officials to suspend play and forfeit the game to PAO, giving the Greens the title. The new champions had to be escorted off the floor by riot police. The league organizer, HEBA, fined Olympiacos €111,000 and required them to play their first nine home games of the 2010–11 season behind closed doors and without live TV coverage.
* The next meeting between the two teams, this time hosted by Panathinaikos on January 12, 2011, saw Olympiacos win 65–61, followed by a rain of incendiaries from Greens fans at the Reds.

* The 2011 Vancouver Stanley Cup riot immediately followed the loss of the Vancouver Canucks hockey team to the Boston Bruins in the deciding Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals in June of that year.
* Later in the same month, major violence broke out involving supporters of historic Argentine football club River Plate during and after their promotion/relegation playoff with Belgrano. The first leg on June 22 in Córdoba was delayed for 20 minutes after River Plate hooligans tore through a fence and stormed the field to verbally and physically attack River players. The second leg, on June 26 at El Monumental in Buenos Aires, had what was reported to be the largest security presence for any match in the country&#x27;s history, with over 2,200 police called in. However, it was not enough to keep River hooligans, angered at what became the club&#x27;s first relegation from the top flight in their history, from rushing the field. Violence quickly spread, with fires set in the stadium, pitched battles between hooligans and police, and looting in nearby areas. At least 35 police and 55 civilians were reported to have been injured.
* On December 21, 2011, a fourth round match in the 2011–12 KNVB Cup between Eredivisie clubs Ajax and AZ at Ajax&#x27;s home of Amsterdam Arena was marred by a violent fan incident. In the 36th minute, Ajax held a 1–0 lead when a fan ran on the pitch and launched a karate kick from behind at AZ goalkeeper Esteban Alvarado. The player responded by kicking the fan several times before security arrived. When Alvarado was sent off for retaliating against his attacker, AZ left the pitch, and the match was abandoned. The KNVB rescinded the red card and ordered the match replayed in its entirety behind closed doors on January 19, 2012. Ajax was also fined €10,000 for failing to prevent the fan—who was supposed to be serving a 3-year stadium ban—from entering the pitch, and given a suspended one-match spectator ban (not including the replay). Ajax accepted the penalties, and announced that it had given the fan a 30-year stadium ban and a lifetime ban from the club and its season ticket list.
* In 2021, fans of the NHL&#x27;s Montreal Canadiens rioted on the streets of Downtown Montreal after the Canadiens defeated the Vegas Golden Knights in Game 6 of their best-of-seven series by a score of 3–2 in overtime to advance to their first Stanley Cup Finals since the 1992-1993 season. Fans set off fireworks, flipped and vandalized police cars, assaulted police officers, threw projectiles, and broke other municipal bylaws in the process, which forced the Bell Centre into a lockdown, locking down the 3,500 fans who saw the game live until police gave the all-clear. The situation was also notable for the fact that it happened on Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day (June 24), Quebec&#x27;s national holiday, in addition to happening less than one month following the end of the first province-wide curfew in Quebec imposed by Premier François Legault in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Quebec, which lasted from the beginning of January to the end of May of that year. The Canadiens would eventually fall to the Tampa Bay Lightning in the 2021 Stanley Cup Finals in five games, and would finish in last place in the NHL the following season.
* In 2024, following the AFC Divisional Round NFL playoff game between the Buffalo Bills and Kansas City Chiefs at Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park, New York where the Chiefs defeated the Bills 27–24, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was pelted with snowballs from the fans as was star tight end Travis Kelce and star linebacker Drue Tranquill. Coming into the game, Buffalo had two previous postseason encounters with Mahomes and Kansas City, both of them resulting in losses, in 2021 and in 2022, albeit at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City. The Buffalo region also had to deal with heavy snowfalls in the days leading up to the game, a situation that also occurred prior to the Bills’ previous playoff game against the Pittsburgh Steelers the preceding week. In both situations, the team had to hire fans to shovel snow out of the stadium’s walkways and paid them $20 per hour for doing so. Following the game, Tranquill took to social media, calling out the fan who threw a snowball at him, claiming that he caught the snowball and was ready to retaliate had it not broken in his hand upon catching it.

== Athlete violence ==

===American football===
* In a National Football League game on November 1, 1970, the Kansas City Chiefs led the Oakland Raiders 17–14, and a long run for a first-down run by quarterback Len Dawson apparently sealed victory for the Chiefs in the final minute when Dawson was speared by Raiders defensive end Ben Davidson, who dove into Dawson with his helmet as he lay on the ground, provoking Chiefs’ receiver Otis Taylor to attack Davidson. After a bench-clearing brawl, Taylor and Davidson were ejected, and the penalties that were called nullified the first down under the rules in effect at that time. The Chiefs were obliged to punt, and the Raiders tied the game on a George Blanda field goal with eight seconds to play. Taylor&#x27;s unwise retaliation against Davidson&#x27;s foul play not only cost the Chiefs a win, but Oakland won the AFC West with a season record of 8–4–2, while Kansas City finished 7–5–2 and out of the playoffs. See also Chiefs–Raiders rivalry.

===Association football===
* 17 March 1971: Boca Juniors and Sporting Cristal met at the 1971 Copa Libertadores. At the final minutes of match, Boca Juniors Roberto Rogel fell to the floor in the penalty area, but the Uruguayan referee Alejandro Otero dismissed their penalty appeal. Boca Junior&#x27;s player Rubén Suñé retaliated by violently shin-kicking Sporting Cristal&#x27;s Alfredo Quesada during the next passage of play. The contact between both players soon escalated and involved both teams violently fighting each other. 19 red cards were issued, 10 Peruvian and 9 Argentine players were arrested after the incident.
* April 2, 2005: Newcastle United teammates Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer were sent off after fighting one another near the end of the team&#x27;s 3–0 loss to Aston Villa. Several Newcastle players and a Villa player separated the two before either was seriously hurt, but Bowyer&#x27;s shirt was ripped.
* March 12, 2020: the first Grenal derby match between Grêmio and Internacional at a Copa Libertadores (nicknamed &quot;O Grenal das Américas&quot;) resulted in a major brawl with 9 red cards issued.

===Australian rules football===
* In 1994 Swans recruit Dermott Brereton was suspended for 7 weeks for standing on Hawthorn player Rayden Tallis&#x27; head during a practice match; he was suspended for another 7 matches later in the season for elbowing Richmond captain Tony Free and breaking his jaw. When Brereton transferred to Collingwood at the end of 1994 the AFL decided that his 7-week suspension was no longer applicable as it was applied to the club (Sydney) and not to the player (Brereton). St Kilda forward Tony Lockett was suspended for 8 matches during the season for elbowing Sydney&#x27;s Peter Caven and breaking his nose.
* Perhaps the most violent match in AFL history took place on June 5, 2004 Round 11, at the MCG between Hawthorn and Essendon. The final score was Hawthorn 12.8 (80) to Essendon 24.10 (154). During halftime, Brereton, by now Hawthorn club director, allegedly told Hawks players to draw a &quot;line in the sand&quot; and take a physical stand against the Bombers. In the third quarter, a number of on-field incidents led to several fights around the ground, culminating in a five-minute bench-clearing brawl. The incidents led to record penalties from the AFL Tribunal, with five players suspended for a combined total of 16 matches and players involved in the melee fined a combined total of A$70,700, the most from a single match in VFL/AFL history. The fracas was described by Tribunal Chairman Brian Collis, QC, as bringing &quot;football into disrepute&quot;. This match would enter AFL lore as the Line in the Sand Match.

===Badminton===
* Thai badminton players Bodin Isara and Maneepong Jongjit got into a fist fight after the 2013 Canada Open Grand Prix men&#x27;s double final match. Both players received a sanction from the Badminton World Federation and from the Badminton Association of Thailand in aftermath of the brawl.

===Baseball===

* The first contest in what would become one of the most intense rivalries in U.S. college sports, an 1895 baseball game between Brigham Young Academy, now Brigham Young University, and the University of Utah, ended in a scoreless tie, immediately followed by a bench-clearing brawl.
* This was far from the last violent incident in the baseball version of the BYU–Utah rivalry:
** In one 1966 game, a Utah batter intentionally hit BYU&#x27;s catcher with his bat.
** In another game in the mid-1980s, a number of BYU players were heckling Utah&#x27;s pitcher. The pitcher went into his stretch, and then turned and fired a fastball into the BYU dugout, leading to a bench-clearing brawl.
** Yet another game in the same era saw a Utah player get a base hit with two outs and two on in the bottom of the ninth inning in a tied game. The lead runner could have scored the winning run uncontested—but he instead went out of his way to run over BYU&#x27;s catcher, who was standing on the first-base side of home plate (the opposite side from a runner heading for home). The runner was called out and ejected, and BYU went on to win in extra innings.
* On August 22, 1965 in Candlestick Park in San Francisco, California, in what is considered to be one of the most violent on-field brawls in sports history, pitcher Juan Marichal of the San Francisco Giants hit catcher John Roseboro of the Los Angeles Dodgers on the head with a bat, opening a gash on Roseboro&#x27;s head starting a 14-minute brawl between the teams in the middle of a heated pennant race. Marichal was subsequently suspended for eight games and fined him a then-NL record $1,750 (equivalent to $ in ).
* On August 12, 1984, a game between the Atlanta Braves and San Diego Padres turned into what writers Bruce Nash and Allan Zullo later called &quot;one of the worst beanball wars of modern times&quot;, starting with Braves pitcher Pascual Pérez hitting Alan Wiggins with the game&#x27;s first pitch, followed by four attempts by Padres pitchers to hit Pérez in retaliation, and ending in Braves reliever Donnie Moore hitting Graig Nettles. The chaos led to four bench-clearing incidents, one of which lasted at least 10 minutes; ejections of both managers and 12 players and coaches; multiple suspensions of individuals involved in the fracas; and fan involvement (see above).

===Basketball===

* In a 1972 college basketball game, Ohio State University were leading the University of Minnesota 50–44 with 36 seconds left to play in the game. Ohio State&#x27;s Luke Witte was fouled hard going to the basket by Minnesota&#x27;s Corky Taylor, who punched the dazed Witte in the face and kneed him in the groin. Gopher reserve Ron Behagen then stomped on Witte&#x27;s neck and head. Witte was not the only victim of violence, as a larger brawl broke out, with two other Gophers, Jim Brewer and future Baseball Hall of Famer Dave Winfield, attacking other Ohio State players. Witte was taken off the court on a stretcher and booed by Minnesota fans. He was the most seriously injured among three Buckeyes players taken to hospitals.
* In an NBA game on December 9, 1977, Kermit Washington of the Los Angeles Lakers was already fighting with Kevin Kunnert of the Houston Rockets when Rudy Tomjanovich of the Rockets came running toward them. Seeing a man in an opponent uniform rushing at him, Washington instinctively turned and punched Tomjanovich in the face, resulting in a near-fatal season-ending injury to Tomjanovich. The NBA suspended Washington for 60 days (26 games) and fined him $10,000. A civil jury awarded Tomjanovich $3.2 million. This incident is the subject of the book &quot;The Punch&quot; by John Feinstein.
* On November 19, 2004, the infamous Malice at the Palace between the Detroit Pistons and the Indiana Pacers players, as well as spectators, took place in Auburn Hills, Michigan. It ranks among the worst episodes of sports violence in American sports history.
* On August 19, 2010, the final game of the Acropolis International Tournament between Greece and Serbia at the Olympic Indoor Hall in Athens ended in a bench-clearing brawl with 2:40 left and Greece leading 74–73. The melee started when Greece&#x27;s Antonis Fotsis moved threateningly toward Serbia&#x27;s Miloš Teodosić after a hard foul. Teodosic responded by punching Fotsis in the face while Nenad Krstić also tried to grab the Greek player. Greece&#x27;s 360 lb center Sofoklis Schortsanitis joined the fight attacking multiple Serbian players and spreading havoc. Krstic punched Schortsanitis several times in his back. When he started pursuing the retreating Krstić, the Serbian player responded by throwing a chair at him. The chair missed Schortsanitis but hit his teammate Ioannis Bourousis in the head, drawing blood. Players from both teams fought in the tunnel leading from the arena before being separated, and a few fans joined the fight but were quickly taken from the arena. Krstić was arrested by Greek police, but was released the following day. FIBA responded by suspending two players from each team for part of the subsequent FIBA World Championship. For Serbia, Krstić was suspended for the tournament&#x27;s first three games and Teodosić for two games; Greece&#x27;s Fotsis and Schortsanitis were also suspended for two games each.
* Later that year, on October 12, an exhibition match between the China and Brazil national teams in Xuchang was marred by rough play from both sides before escalating into open exchanges of kicks and punches, followed by a bench-clearing brawl. After the teams were separated, China players attacked the Brazilians as they were heading to the locker room. Brazil refused to return to the court or to play the fourth and final match in their scheduled series. The Chinese national federation issued an official apology to Brazil the following day. This was the latest in a series of incidents involving the China team that had already resulted in tens of thousands of US$ in fines from both FIBA and FIBA Asia. Ultimately, China head coach Bob Donewald Jr. was suspended for China&#x27;s next three FIBA matches; three China players drew suspensions of one or two games; and the three match officials were suspended from FIBA matches for one year.
*On August 18, 2011, another Chinese team, the Bayi Rockets of the Chinese Basketball Association, was involved in a major scuffle with the touring Georgetown University men&#x27;s team. After three quarters of highly physical play from both sides, the game turned ugly with the teams tied at 64 with 9:32 remaining in the final quarter. At that point, both benches emptied and the teams began fighting one another. One Georgetown player had a chair thrown at him by an unidentified individual, with reports differing on whether he was hit. Another Georgetown player who had been struck during the brawl picked up a chair in apparent self-defense. As the brawl progressed, some fans joined in the action, with one wielding a stanchion. Hoyas coach John Thompson III pulled his team from the court; the team had to dodge water bottles and other objects thrown by fans, and one Georgetown fan was reportedly knocked to the ground by a thrown bottle.
* On July 2, 2018, a bench-clearing brawl broke out between the Australia and Philippines men&#x27;s national teams during a World Cup qualifier in Bocaue. With Australia leading by over 30 points with just over 4:00 left in the third quarter, play was halted for a foul. Australia&#x27;s Daniel Kickert then swung his elbow at an unsuspecting Philippines player, immediately leading to both benches clearing and a melee spreading from the bench to one of the baskets. When order was restored and game officials reviewed video of the incident, a total of 13 players were ejected—four from Australia (including Kickert) and nine from the Philippines. This left the hosts with only three players to resume the game; after two of the remaining Philippines players fouled out, leaving that team with only one player, the officials called the game, with Australia winning 89–53.

===Ice hockey===

Violence has been a part of ice hockey since at least the early 1900s. According to the book &quot;&quot;, in 1904 alone, four players were killed during hockey games from the frequent brawls and violent stickwork. Fighting in ice hockey is an established tradition of the sport in North America, with a long history involving many levels of amateur and professional play and including some notable individual fights. While officials tolerate fighting during hockey games, they impose a variety of penalties on players who engage in fights. Unique to North American professional team sports, the National Hockey League (NHL) and most minor professional leagues in North America do not eject players outright for fighting but major European and collegiate hockey leagues do.

The debate over allowing fighting in ice hockey games is ongoing. Despite its potentially negative consequences, such as heavier enforcers (or &quot;heavyweights&quot;) knocking each other out, some administrators are not considering eliminating fighting from the game, as some players consider it essential. Additionally, the majority of fans oppose eliminating fights from professional hockey games.
* In an NHL preseason game between the Boston Bruins and St. Louis Blues on September 21, 1969, Bruins defenseman Ted Green and Blues left wing Wayne Maki, attacking Green, engaged in a bloody stick-swinging fight that resulted in Green sustaining a skull fracture and brain damage, forcing him to miss the entirety of the 1969–70 NHL season, with Maki emerging uninjured. As a result of the fight, Green played for the remaining nine years of his professional career with a pioneering variety of hockey helmet in both the NHL and WHA.
* April 20, 1984 – A bench-clearing brawl broke out at the end of the second period of a second-round playoffs matchup between the Quebec Nordiques and the Montreal Canadiens, after many smaller-scale battles had occurred throughout the game. A second bench-clearing brawl erupted before the third period began, provoked by the announcement of penalties; a total of 252 penalty minutes were incurred and 10 players were ejected. This game prompted referee Bruce Hood to retire from the NHL once the playoffs ended, and is commonly referred to as the &quot;Good Friday Massacre&quot;.
* On January 4, 1987, the final game of the World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, involving Canada and the Soviet Union, saw intense physical (and often dirty) play by both sides, culminating in a bench-clearing brawl that lasted over 20 minutes. Event organizers, in a futile attempt to stop the fighting, turned the arena lights off. Eventually, the game was declared null and void, and both teams were ejected from the competition, costing the Canadians a medal. Virtually all of the players on the Canadian team got suspended for 18 months, while the Soviet Union players were permanently banned from international competition, and the coaching staffs of both teams were fired. The match referee, widely blamed for losing control of the game, never worked another international match. A book by Gare Joyce was written regarding the event.
* February 9, 2001 – A game between the Nottingham Panthers and the Sheffield Steelers in the British Superleague saw &quot;one of the worst scenes of violence seen at a British ice hockey rink&quot;. When Sheffield enforcer Dennis Vial crosschecked Nottingham forward Greg Hadden, Panthers enforcer Barry Nieckar subsequently fought with Vial which eventually escalated into a 36-man bench-clearing brawl. Referee Moray Hanson sent both teams to their locker rooms and delayed the game for 45 minutes while tempers cooled and the officials sorted out the penalties. Eight players and both coaches were ejected, and a British record total of 404 penalty minutes were incurred during the second period. The league handed out 30 games in suspensions to four players and Steelers coach Mike Blaisdell and a total of £8,400 in fines.
* March 5, 2004 – A Philadelphia Flyers – Ottawa Senators game resulted in five consecutive brawls in the closing minutes of the game, including fights between many players who are not known as enforcers and a fight between Flyers goalie Robert Esche and Senators goalie Patrick Lalime. The game ended with an NHL record 419 penalty minutes, and an NHL record 20 players were ejected, leaving five players on the team benches. The officials took 90 minutes to sort out the penalties that each team had received.
* January 9, 2010 – In a Kontinental Hockey League game between Vityaz Chekhov and Avangard Omsk, a bench-clearing brawl broke out in the 4th minute of the first period, and a bench- and penalty-box-clearing brawl broke out 39 seconds later, forcing officials to abandon the game as there were only four players left. Thirty-three players and both teams&#x27; coaches were ejected, and a world-record total of 707 penalty minutes were incurred during the game. The KHL imposed fines totaling 5.7 million rubles ($191,000), suspended seven players, and counted the game as a 5–0 defeat for both teams, with no points being awarded.

===Rugby===

* During their 1974 tour to South Africa the Lions had a &quot;99 call&quot; that was a policy of simultaneous retaliation, and on the same tour the &quot;Battle of Boet Erasmus Stadium&quot; was one of the most violent matches in rugby history,
* In 2010, South African lock Bakkies Botha head-butted New Zealand halfback Jimmy Cowan during a Tri-Nations tournament match and was subsequently suspended for 9 weeks.

===Other sports===
*On 6 December 1956, at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics and shortly after the Hungarian Revolution, players at the semi-final water polo match between Hungary and the USSR would use any form of violence they could manage whenever the players of opposing teams came in contact. In the closing minutes of the match, Soviet player Valentin Prokopov punched Hungarian player Ervin Zádor, and it was coined as the Blood in the Water match after Zádor emerged with blood pouring from above his eye. Tensions were at an all-time high between the competing teams; the Soviet armed forces had violently suppressed the Hungarian Revolution just weeks before. Most of the Revolutionaries consisted of civilians, a majority factory workers and students, who constructed Molotov cocktails against the formal armed forces of the USSR. Throughout the match, players would use any form of violence they could manage whenever the players of opposing teams came in contact. Zador’s injury occurred in the closing minutes of the match. Chaos ensued with the crowd booing the Russians.
*On 24 August 2008, during the Olympics, Ángel Matos of Cuba angrily kicked a referee after being told he was disqualified in the bronze medal match. World Taekwondo later banned Matos for life, along with his coach.

<text>Jennifer Rush (born Heidi Stern; September 28, 1960) is an American pop and rock singer. She achieved initial success during the mid-1980s with several singles and studio albums, including the million-selling single &quot;The Power of Love&quot;, which she co-wrote and released in 1984. Her initial greatest success came in Europe. Other successful singles from that period include &quot;Ring of Ice&quot;, &quot;Destiny&quot;, &quot;I Come Undone&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re My One and Only&quot;, &quot;Higher Ground&quot;, &quot;25 Lovers&quot;, &quot;If You&#x27;re Ever Gonna Lose My Love&quot;, &quot;Heart over Mind&quot; and &quot;Flames of Paradise&quot;, a duet with Elton John. In the 1990s she had several charting singles, including &quot;Tears in the Rain&quot;.

==Early life==
Rush was born Heidi Stern in the New York City borough of Queens to Barbara and Maurice Stern. She has two older brothers, Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Stern and Stephen Stern (both professional musicians), and a younger sister. Rush and her brothers lived with their mother until she was a toddler, and then with their father and his second wife on the Upper West Side of the borough of Manhattan. Rush studied violin at the Juilliard School and also took piano lessons, although she did not enjoy these instruments and instead took to playing the guitar in private. When Rush was nine, the Stern family moved to Germany. Rush returned to the United States a few years later to live with her mother&#x27;s family. She also lived for a time in Seattle, Washington, when her father was briefly a professor of voice at the University of Washington.

==Career==
Rush&#x27;s debut studio album, titled with her legal name of Heidi Stern, was released locally in Seattle, Washington, in 1979. After meeting singer, songwriter, and producer Gene McDaniels in Seattle, she went to Los Angeles to record demo songs with him. She credits McDaniels as being her first and most influential mentor as a songwriter and a singer. In 1982, following McDaniels&#x27;s persistence, Rush moved to Wiesbaden, Germany, where her father was an opera singer for a short period of time. She was then advised to change her name which she did legally.

Rush was first signed to CBS Songs Publishing Company as a songwriter in Frankfurt, Germany. At that time she was working for almost two years full time in the military in Munich. She has never had vocal training, however she is proficient in music theory due to her two years in the children&#x27;s orchestra as first violinist.

=== CBS Records (1982–1991) ===
==== Early singles and debut album (1984) ====
Rush&#x27;s debut single with CBS Records International was &quot;Tonight&quot;, which was released in West Germany under her birth name of Heidi Stern in 1982. The single did not enter any charts and she changed her stage name to Jennifer Rush the following year. In 1983, Rush released her first two singles under her new stage name, titled &quot;Into My Dreams&quot; and &quot;Come Give Me Your Hand&quot;, both of which Rush co-wrote with producers Gunther Mende and Candy DeRouge. However, neither song entered the music charts. In February and March 1984, Rush toured with the Berlin Philharmonic on a series of James Bond-themed concerts. She performed covers of &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;, &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; and &quot;Thunderball&quot; at the concerts and astonished the audience with her singing.

Rush&#x27;s chart breakthrough came with the single &quot;25 Lovers&quot;, which entered the West Germany singles chart in June 1984, spending 20 weeks on the chart and reaching its highest position at number 25. Her next hit single was &quot;Ring of Ice&quot;, which entered the German singles chart in October 1984 and peaked at number 22. Like with her first two singles, these songs were co-written by Rush with producers Gunther Mende and Candy deRouge. Mende and DeRouge were the producers behind Rush&#x27;s debut album &quot;Jennifer Rush&quot;, released in West Germany in October 1984. Rush herself co-wrote eight of the ten songs on the album, and other songwriters included Mary Susan Applegate, Patrick Henderson, Richard Feldmann, Marcy Levy and Eric Klapperton.

The most famous song from the album was &quot;The Power of Love&quot;. Initially this song was released as the fifth and final single from the album in January 1985 in West Germany, where it initially peaked at number 16. However, it found greater success in the United Kingdom, where it was released in June 1985. The song was a &quot;sleeper hit&quot;, spending sixteen weeks on the chart before finally hitting number 1 in October. It spent five consecutive weeks at the top and ultimately became the best-selling single of 1985 in the United Kingdom. It was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records at the time as the best-selling single by a female solo artist in the history of the British music industry. &quot;The Power of Love&quot; held that status until 1992, when it was outsold by Whitney Houston&#x27;s &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;.

Following the song&#x27;s success in the United Kingdom, &quot;The Power of Love&quot; was released as single throughout the rest of the world in 1985 and 1986. It reached number one on the charts in Australia, Austria, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal and South Africa, as well as in Spain with a Spanish re-recording titled &quot;Si Tu Eres Mi Hombre Y Yo Tu Mujer&quot;. The single additionally reached the top 10 of the charts in Belgium, Finland, Greece, Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. The single was however less successful in the United States, where it peaked at number 57 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

Rush&#x27;s debut album was a big success in West Germany, where it spent 97 weeks on the chart and peaked twice at number 2 throughout its chart run. The album hit number one in both Spain and Norway, spending five and ten weeks at the top respectively. The album additionally achieved top 10 placements in Australia, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. By late 1988, the album sold three million copies worldwide.

==== &quot;Movin&quot;&#x27; (1985) ====
Rush&#x27;s second album, titled &quot;Movin&#x27;&quot;, was released in West Germany in October 1985. She again worked with producers Gunther Mende and Candy DeRouge, as well as songwriter Mary Susan Applegate, and herself co-wrote eight of the ten songs on the album. Other writers were Tony Carey, Mark Mangold and Suzanne Mangold. Additionally, the album contained a cover of the song &quot;Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday&quot;, originally by Stevie Wonder.

The album was a huge success in West Germany, where it stayed at number 1 for thirteen consecutive weeks and spent 65 weeks on the chart in total. It was certified triple platinum for shipments of 1.5 million copies and was the most successful album in the country of 1986. The album also found success throughout the rest of Europe. It reached number 1 in Norway, Sweden and Switzerland and attained a gold or platinum certification in all three countries. The album was also in the top 10 of the charts in Austria and Finland, the top 30 in the Netherlands and top 40 in the United Kingdom.

The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Destiny&quot; was top 5 hit in West Germany, Austria and Switzerland. It also reached the top 30 in Belgium and Netherlands, but performed poorly in the United Kingdom. The second and final single &quot;If You&#x27;re Ever Gonna Lose My Love&quot; charted in the top 20 in Austria and Finland, and the top 30 in West Germany. This song was Rush&#x27;s second single to be re-recorded in Spanish, and was re-titled &quot;No Me Canso De Pensar En Ti&quot;.

==== &quot;Heart over Mind&quot; (1987) ====
For the recording of her third album &quot;Heart over Mind&quot;, Rush relocated from Germany to the United States. On this album Rush worked with American producers and songwriters Desmond Child, Bruce Roberts, Andy Goldmark, Ellen Shipley, Morrie Brown, Taylor Rhodes, Tom DeLuca, Tom Whitlock, Rick Nowels, Mark Radice and Michael Bolton. Additionally, German producer Harold Faltermeyer and British producer Gus Dudgeon also worked on the album. There was also guitar work from Richie Sambora of Bon Jovi and British singer-songwriter Elton John performed a duet with Rush titled &quot;Flames of Paradise&quot;.

In her most successful market, West Germany, &quot;Heart over Mind&quot; was her second number 1 album, and stayed at the top position for nine consecutive weeks and stayed on the charts for 53 weeks. It was the second most successful album of 1987 in the country, behind U2&#x27;s &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;. The album was also certified double platinum for shipments of 1 million copies.

The album also found success in other European countries. In Switzerland, the album was number 1 for three weeks and certified Platinum. The album was also certified Platinum in Sweden. Top 10 positions were achieved in Austria, Finland and Norway. The album also managed to reach the top 40 in Canada and received a Gold certification there. However, the album failed to make a large impact in the United States, where it only reached number 118 on the Billboard 200.

The album&#x27;s first single was a cover of the Ellen Shipley song &quot;I Come Undone&quot;, which reached the top 10 in Poland, Switzerland and South Africa, and the top 20 in Finland and West Germany. The second single was the Elton John duet &quot;Flames of Paradise&quot;, which became the album&#x27;s biggest hit. It reached the top 10 in Switzerland and West Germany, and the top 20 in Canada and New Zealand. It was also Rush&#x27;s highest charting single on the Billboard Hot 100, reached number 36. The album&#x27;s third single &quot;Heart over Mind&quot; reached the top 30 in Austria, West Germany and Switzerland, and also entered the dance charts in the United States.

==== &quot;Passion&quot; (1988) and &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; (1989) ====
Rush&#x27;s last studio two albums with CBS Records International were &quot;Passion&quot; in 1988 and &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; in 1989.

For &quot;Passion&quot;, Harold Faltermeyer and Michael Bolton once again produced and/or co-wrote some songs for Rush. Most writers and producers however had not worked on Rush&#x27;s previous albums. These included Bob Halligan Jr., Chuck Wild, Ric Wake, Michael Omartian, Diane Warren, Keith Forsey and Jellybean.

CBS initially had high expectations for &quot;Passion&quot;. The album had 340,000 pre-release orders in Germany, the largest ever ship-out for an album released by CBS records at the time. In the long run, the album ultimately shipped 500,000 copies, achieving a Platinum certification but falling short of the 1 to 1.5 million copies shipped individually by the first three albums. &quot;Passion&quot; peaked at number 3 in West Germany and stayed on the albums chart for 22 weeks. Outside of Germany, the album was most successful in Switzerland where it reached number 4 and achieved a Gold certification. The album also reached the top 10 in Sweden, the top 20 in Finland and the top 30 in Austria.

The only charting single from &quot;Passion&quot; was &quot;You&#x27;re My One and Only&quot;, which reached the top 30 in Switzerland and West Germany. The second and third singles, &quot;Keep All the Fires Burning Bright&quot; and &quot;Love Get Ready&quot;, failed to enter any music charts.

In 1989, Rush recorded a duet with Placido Domingo titled &quot;Till I Loved You&quot;. The single reached the top 30 in the United Kingdom, Rush&#x27;s first top 40 entry in the country since &quot;Ring of Ice&quot;.

Her next studio album &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; worked with new writers and producers who were not involved on earlier albums, with the exception of Michael Bolton and Bob Halligan Jr.. Producers on this album were Christopher Neil, Phil Ramone and Michael J. Powell. Songwriters included Amy Sky, Bruce Gaitsch, Jackie Rawe, Alfie Zappacosta, Graham Shaw, Tomas Ledin, Felix Weber and David Palmer.

A compilation album titled &quot;The Power of Jennifer Rush&quot; was released in 1991.

=== EMI and Virgin (1992–1999) ===
Through the 1990s, Rush released four albums, three with EMI. Between her leaving CBS and signing with EMI - Rush studied micro and macro economics at Harvard University in Boston. At that time she was considering a different career path.

By the late 1990s, Rush had hit the US Hot 100 chart two times; &quot;The Power of Love&quot; reaching number 57 in 1985 and &quot;Flames of Paradise&quot; (a duet with Elton John) reaching number 36 in 1987. She publicly acknowledged that being less known as a singer in the United States, allowed her to raise her daughter in the US with a more stable and somewhat private environment. She could still travel and perform, but also enjoyed the luxury of songwriting with colleagues based on the East Coast and being available to her daughter as a single mother. A series of greatest-hits compilation albums comprising most of her European hit songs followed in the 2000s.

=== 2000 to present ===
A box set titled &quot;Stronghold – The Collector&#x27;s Hit Box&quot; was released in August 2007. This compilation included all of Rush&#x27;s singles from 1982 to 1991 (with the first record company that signed her), and in their extended versions as available. It also included all the B-sides and other rare or unreleased tracks (among them four James Bond theme songs, recorded live in 1984 and only released in a very limited edition by the Berlin Philharmonic).

In March 2009, she announced on her official website that she had signed a recording contract with Sony Music/Ariola for one album. That album would be &quot;Now Is the Hour&quot;, released in 2010. This marked a return to the recording label where she had made her international breakthrough in the 1980s and on which she had released the first five studio albums of her career. &quot;Now Is the Hour&quot; was released on March 5, 2010, in most of Europe, with minimal input from the label and on March 8, 2010, in the UK. The album failed to chart in the US or the UK, but reached number twenty-one on the German Albums charts.

<text>Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Naxalbari was an underground Maoist political party in India. The party was founded in 1998, following the expulsion of Rauf from the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Red Flag, on the basis of the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka party units of CPI(ML) Red Flag. CPI(ML) Naxalbari was in contact with the Maoist Unity Centre, CPI(ML) (which had been formed by the remnants of the Central Reorganisation Committee, Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist)), and in 1999 MUC, CPI(ML) merged into CPI(ML) Naxalbari. Rauf led the CPI(ML) Naxalbari as its secretary until resigning in 2006 due to old age. Kannamballi Murali (&#x27;Ajith&#x27;) took over post of party secretary after Rauf.

CPI(ML) Naxalbari were members of Revolutionary Internationalist Movement and Coordination Committee of Maoist Parties and Organizations of South Asia. The RIM membership was inherited from CRC, CPI (ML), which was one of three founding organisations of RIM. CPI(ML) Naxalbari advocated armed struggle and they only recognised groups such as Communist Party of India (Maoist) as truly communist.

On 1 May 2014 the merger of CPI(ML) Naxalbari into the CPI (Maoist) was publicly announced.

<text>The Caenophidia are a derived clade of alethinophidian snakes, which contains over 80% of all the extant species of snakes. The largest family is Colubridae, but it also includes at least seven other families, at least four of which were once classified as &quot;Colubridae&quot; before molecular phylogenetics helped us understand their relationships. It has been found to be monophyletic.

Although the Caenophidia previously was held to exclude Acrochordidae, researchers have recognized that acrochordids share several traits with the other caenophidians. Hence Caenophidia is usually considered to comprise Acrochordidae plus the more derived snakes classified as Colubroidea. Recent molecular studies have also found the families Xenophidiidae and Bolyeriidae to be closely related to caenophidians, forming the sister group to Caenophidia rather than being part of Henophidia.

Below is a phylogeny of the Caenophidia based on analyses from several studies:

<text>Heriot, from Old English &quot;heregeat&quot; (&quot;war-gear&quot;), was originally a death-duty in late Anglo-Saxon England, which required that at death, a nobleman provided to his king a given set of military equipment, often including horses, swords, shields, spears and helmets. It later developed into a kind of tenurial feudal relief due from villeins. The equivalent term in French was &quot;droit du meilleur catel&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word derives from Old English &quot;here-geatwa&quot;, meaning the arms and equipment (&quot;geatwa&quot;) of a soldier or army (&quot;here&quot;).

==History==
An example of heriot was the right of a lord in feudal Europe to seize a serf&#x27;s best horse, clothing, or both, upon his death. It arose from the tradition of the lord lending a serf a horse or armour or weapons to fight so that when the serf died the lord would rightfully reclaim his property. In England, heriot is first mentioned in the wills of West-Saxon nobles in the mid-tenth century, such as that of Æthelmær the Stout. Large bequests were made to the king, especially of war gear, in return for the king&#x27;s permission to make a will and for his support in ensuring that the provisions of the will were carried out. The regulation of levels of heriot is the subject of a clause in Cnut&#x27;s secular law-code (II Cnut § 71), drawn up between 1020 and 1023. The form of this duty depended on the rank of the nobleman (earl, king&#x27;s thegn, median thegn) and on his region (Danelaw, Wessex). 

When knights as a class emerged and were later able to acquire their own fighting instruments, the lord continued to claim rights to property upon death, extending sometimes to everyone and not just the fighting knights. Serfs could make provisions for heriot in their wills, but death in battle often meant no heriot was required, because the winner of a fight would often take horse and armour anyway as was often the custom. By the 13th century the payment was made either in money or in kind by handing over the best beast or chattel of the tenant. The enlightened cleric Jacques de Vitry called lords who imposed heriots &quot;vultures that prey upon death... worms feeding upon the corpse.&quot; 

Heriot came in many varieties. G. G. Coulton reports a curious case of heriot in modern times: 

Heriot is one of the many curious laws from feudal times that started because of a logical need between two parties, and persisted because a lord&#x27;s customary rights tended to continue on even when their original reason no longer existed. This law and many others, such as the noble right not to pay taxes, have a long and contentious history in Europe. It was legally abolished in Britain in 1922.

<doc id="848336" wikidata="Q5168045" url="?curid=848336" title="Codava National Council">
<text>Codava National Council, is a social, political and cultural organisation in the Indian state of Karnataka. Formerly CNC (Codava National Council) was known as KRMM (Kodagu Rajya Mukti Morcha). The KRMM demanded a separate statehood status for Kodagu until the 1990s. Later they scaled down their demand. Ever since they have been demanding a Kodava hill council in Kodagu. The CNC Organisation&#x27;s President is Nandineravanda U. Nachappa Codava. CNC is the largest political group in the Kodagu district. CNC urges for geo-political autonomy for indigenous Kodavas and their lands and recognition of their cultural heritage and rights. 

==Demands==

The CNC struggle is asking for:

1. Codava land autonomous region under the 6th schedule of the Constitution and constitutional special guarantee for Kodava

2. Jamma land and Jamma malai land (traditional sedentary farming and hill farming lands of Kodavas) under Article 370 and 371 of the Constitution, as has been done in relation to the lands of State of Jammu and Kashmir and North Eastern states of India (and to some extent in other states also),

3. Ethno linguistic tribal minority nationality status to Codavas under Article 340 and 342 of the Constitution, inclusion of Kodava Thakk in the 8th schedule of the Constitution,

4. Constitution special guarantee for Kodava customary personal laws and heritage, on the lines of Mizos and Nagas.

5. Also exemption to carry weapons (due to martial traditions similar to Sikhs and Nagas) should be guaranteed under the Constitution of India without any hindrance for ever.

The Kodavas compulsorily worship arms (guns and swords) as it is part of their religious traditions. From 1600 they have held guns and swords as they were the militia of Kodagu and every Kodava compulsorily served in the Raja&#x27;s and the Nayaka&#x27;s (chieftain&#x27;s) army. However the Kodavas have traditional rules which strictly forbid even the pointing of a gun or a sword at another person especially a civilian, except for one&#x27;s defence. Usually the gun&#x27;s bore is never pointed in the direction of a person.
6. Also universal recognition for Kodava race and internal political self-determination rights for Kodavas.
Until 2000 the name of CNC was &quot;Kodagu Rajya Mukti Morcha&quot; (KRMM or Kodagu State Liberation Front). The CNC is asking for a Kodava hill council in Kodagu and for the protection of the rights of the Kodavas, an ethnic and linguistic minority in South India. CNC has been demanding an Autonomous Hill Council on the lines of Ladakh and Darjeeling.

===Caste Reservations===

Around the early 2000&#x27;s, the Kodava people were included in the Other Backward Classes list of Karnataka. The Kodavas were listed as &quot;Kodagaru&quot; (a derogatory term) under the &quot;Category III A&quot; of the Other Backwards Caste (OBC) List of Karnataka State Government. The CNC had appealed to the State Government to correct this and mention them as Kodavas and to include them in the &quot;Central Government Other Backward Castes (OBC) List&quot;.

<doc id="848340" wikidata="Q371507" url="?curid=848340" title="Cleveleys">
<text>Cleveleys is a town on the Fylde Coast of Lancashire, England, about north of Blackpool and south of Fleetwood. It is part of the Borough of Wyre. With its neighbouring settlement of Thornton, Cleveleys was part of the former urban district of Thornton-Cleveleys and is part of the Blackpool Urban Area. In 2011 the Cleveleys Built-up area sub division had a population of 10,754.

==History==
At the start of the Second World War, several departments of the Ministry of Pensions, the Ministry of Education and the Board of Trade were moved to the Cleveleys area. Some were housed in the Rossall School briefly. An extensive site was developed for the Ministry of Pensions in the Norcross section of Carleton and all the government departments moved out in 1940.

On 1 February 2008, the &quot;MS Riverdance&quot; ferry, while undertaking a regular sailing from Northern Ireland to Heysham under severe stormy conditions, ran aground on Anchorsholme beach, close to the boundary with Cleveleys 

==Transport==

Cleveleys is served by Blackpool Transport, which operates to Blackpool town centre, Mereside, Lytham, Bispham and Fleetwood, by Stagecoach North West, Cumfybus and Classic Bus Northwest, via Cleveleys bus station.

Cleveleys is on the Blackpool Tramway. The tramway runs from Starr Gate in Blackpool to Fleetwood via Bispham and Cleveleys. There are five tram stops in the area, between the stops of Rossall School (Southern Fleetwood) and Little Bispham (Northern edge of Blackpool).

The nearest railway station to Cleveleys is Poulton-le-Fylde, away.

==Media==
Local television news programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. The local television station That&#x27;s Lancashire also broadcasts to the area. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Lancashire, Heart North West, Smooth North West, Greatest Hits Radio Lancashire, Dune Radio, and Blackpool-based stations: Coastal Radio and Fylde Coast Radio. 

The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Blackpool Gazette&quot;.

==Amenities==
Cleveleys has a number of pubs, including The Victoria Hotel, The Shipwreck Brewhouse, and The Jolly Tars, all on Victoria Road.

Between 1961 and 2004, the Children&#x27;s Corner amusement park stood on Cleveleys Promenade at the end of Victoria Road West. It was demolished in the early 21st century as part of work on the town&#x27;s sea defences.

<text>Wheelchair basketball is a style of basketball played using a sports wheelchair. The International Wheelchair Basketball Federation (IWBF) is the governing body for this sport. It is recognized by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) as the sole competent authority in wheelchair basketball worldwide. FIBA has recognized IWBF under Article 53 of its General Statutes.

The IWBF has 95 National Organizations for Wheelchair Basketball (NOWBs) participating in wheelchair basketball throughout the world, with this number increasing each year. It is estimated that more than 100,000 people play wheelchair basketball from recreation to club play and as elite national team members.

Wheelchair basketball is included in the Paralympic Games. The Wheelchair Basketball World Championship is played two years after every Paralympic Games. Major competition in wheelchair basketball comes from Canada, Australia, the United States, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Japan.

==History==

===1940s to 1960s===
In 1944, Ludwig Guttmann, through the rehabilitation program at the Stoke Mandeville Hospital, in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England, adapted existing sports to use wheelchairs. It was known as wheelchair netball.

At around the same time, starting from 1946, wheelchair basketball games were played primarily between American World War II disabled veterans. It was used as a way for these soldiers to rehabilitate and socialize with other disabled veterans. Wheelchair basketball helped the veterans become more physically active and improve in skills such as coordination and communication. This began in the United States at the University of Illinois. Dr. Timothy Nugent founded the National Wheelchair Basketball Association in 1949 and served as commissioner for the first 25 years.

The Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Games, held in 1947, were the first games to be held and included only a handful of participants (26), and a few events (shot put, javelin, club throw, and archery).

The number of wheelchair events and participants grew quickly. Wheelchair netball was introduced in the 1948 Games. In 1952, a team from the Netherlands was invited to compete with the British team. This became the first International Stoke-Mandeville Games (ISMG), an event that has been held annually ever since.

Wheelchair basketball, as it is known now, was first played at the 1956 International Stoke-Mandeville Games. The US &quot;Pan Am Jets&quot; team won the tournament.

===1970s to present===


In 1973, the International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation (ISMGF) established the first sub-section for wheelchair basketball. At that time, ISMGF was the world governing body for all wheelchair sports.

In 1989, ISMGF accepted for its former wheelchair basketball sub-section to be named International Wheelchair Basketball Federation (IWBF).

Full independence came in 1993 with the IWBF becoming the world body for wheelchair basketball with full responsibility for development of the sport. Over the following years, IWBF membership grew in size, and based on the number of National Organizations for Wheelchair Basketball (NOWBs) with active programs, the international federation configured itself into four geographical zones: Africa, Americas, Asia/Oceania and Europe.

===Wheelchair Basketball World Championship===
World championships for the sport have been held since 1973, with Bruges, Belgium being the first host city. Great Britain won the first world championship for men. Of the first 11 men&#x27;s world championships, six were won by the United States (1979, 1983, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002), two were won by Great Britain (1973, 2018), two were won by Australia (2010, 2014); and once by Israel (1975), France (1990) and Canada (2006). Canada has won five of the women&#x27;s world championship titles (1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2014), the United States two (1990, 2010) and the Netherlands one (2018).

==Rules==

Wheelchair basketball retains most major rules and scoring of basketball, and maintains a 10-foot basketball hoop and standard basketball court. The exceptions are rules which have been modified with consideration for the wheelchair. For example, &quot;travelling&quot; in wheelchair basketball occurs when the athlete touches their wheels more than twice after receiving or dribbling the ball. The individual must pass, bounce, or shoot the ball before touching the wheels again.

In some countries, such as Canada, Australia, and England, non-disabled athletes using wheelchairs are allowed to compete alongside other athletes on mixed teams.

===Classifications===

Classification is an international regulation for playing wheelchair basketball to harmonize players&#x27; different levels of disabilities. All teams which compete above a recreational level use the classification system to evaluate the functional abilities of players on a point scale of 1 to 4.5. Minimally disabled athletes are classified as a 4.5, and an individual with the highest degree of disability (such as a paraplegic with a complete injury below the chest) would be classified as a 1.0. Competitions restrict the number of points allowable on the court at one time. The five players from each team on the court during play may not exceed a total of 14 points. In places where teams are integrated, non-disabled athletes compete as either a 4.5 in Canada or a 5.0 in Europe; however, non-disabled athletes are not allowed to compete internationally.

===Basketball chair design===
Basketball wheelchairs are designed for enhanced stability. The center of gravity is where the chair and the athlete&#x27;s mass are equally distributed in all directions. Points at which the wheelchair can tip over sideways are the fulcrum. A wheelchair with a higher seat is easier to tip. Basketball chairs have lower seats and wheels that are angled outward so that the center of gravity has to move a greater distance before it passes over the fulcrum and tips the chair. Guards use wheelchairs different from those of centers and forwards. Forwards and centers are typically under the net, so their chairs have higher seats and therefore less stability, but the height increases the player&#x27;s reach for shots at the hoop and for rebounds. Guards have lower seats and therefore greater stability for ball handling and getting down the court as quickly as possible.

===Wheelchair 3x3===
Wheelchair 3x3 started in 2019.

<text>The Curtiss-Wright XP-55 Ascender (company designation CW-24) is a 1940s United States prototype fighter aircraft built by Curtiss-Wright. Along with the Vultee XP-54 and Northrop XP-56, it resulted from United States Army Air Corps proposal R-40C issued on 27 November 1939 for aircraft with improved performance, armament, and pilot visibility over existing fighters; it specifically allowed for unconventional aircraft designs. An unusual design for its time, it had a canard configuration with a rear-mounted engine, and two vertical tails at end of swept wings. Because of its pusher design, it was satirically referred to as the &quot;Ass-ender&quot;. Like the XP-54, the Ascender was designed for the 1,800 hp Pratt &amp; Whitney X-1800 24-Cylinder H-engine, but was redesigned after that engine project was canceled. It was also the first Curtiss fighter aircraft to use tricycle landing gear. Development of the Ascender was cancelled when testing revealed it to be inferior to conventional fighter aircraft, and the first jet fighters were operational.

==Design and development==
In June 1940, the Curtiss-Wright company received an Army contract for preliminary engineering data and a powered wind tunnel model. The designation &#x27;P-55&#x27; was reserved for the project. The exhaustive wind-tunnel tests that from November 1940 through January 1941 left the USAAC dissatisfied with the results of these tests.

Accordingly, Curtiss-Wright built at their St Louis division a flying full-scale mockup they designated CW-24B. The flying testbed was powered by a Menasco C68-5 inline engine. It had a fabric-covered, welded steel tube fuselage with a wooden wing. The undercarriage was non-retractable. The canard did not carry load but only trimmed flight. The CW-24B model completed its maiden flight in December 1941. From November 1941 to May 1942, the Model 24B logged 169 flights at Muroc Dry Lake, California. The tests appeared to show potential. The CW-24B then went to NACA at Langley Field for wind tunnel tests.

On 10 July 1942, the United States Army Air Forces issued a contract for three prototypes under the designation XP-55. Serial numbers 42-78845 through 42-78847 were assigned to the aircraft. During this time, the Pratt &amp; Whitney X-1800 H-block sleeve valve engine was delayed, and was eventually canceled. Curtiss decided to switch to the Allison V-1710 (F16) liquid-cooled inline engine because of its proven reliability. Armament was to be two Hispano autocannon and two M2 Browning heavy machine guns. During the mock-up phase, engineers switched to the V-1710-95. The 20 mm cannons were also replaced by 0.50 in machine guns.

One feature of the XP-55 was a propeller jettison lever inside the cockpit to prevent the pilot from hitting the propeller during bailout. The jettison device was invented by W. Jerome Peterson while working as a design engineer for Curtiss-Wright.

==Operational history==

Three XP-55 prototypes were built. Two were destroyed during flight testing, as a result of their propensity for sudden wing stalls.

The first XP-55 (42-78845) was completed and delivered on 13 July 1943, with the same configuration as the final prototype CW-24B. The aircraft made its first flight on 19 July 1943 from the Army&#x27;s Scott Field near the Curtiss-Wright plant in St Louis, Missouri. The pilot was J. Harvey Gray, Curtiss&#x27; test pilot. Testing revealed the takeoff run was excessively long. To solve this problem, the nose elevator size was increased and the aileron up-trim was interconnected with the flaps so it operated after the flaps were lowered.

In 15 November 1943, test pilot Harvey Gray, flying the first XP-55 (S/N 42-78845), was testing the aircraft&#x27;s stall performance at altitude. Suddenly, the XP-55 inverted into an uncontrolled descent. The engine failed &quot;making recovery impossible&quot; and it fell out of control for before Gray was able to parachute to safety. The aircraft was destroyed and &quot;left a smoking hole in the ground&quot;.

The second XP-55 (serial 42-78846) was similar to the first, but with a slightly larger nose-elevator, modified elevator-tab systems, and a change from balance tabs to spring tabs on the ailerons. It flew for the first time on 9 January 1944. All flight tests were restricted so the stall-zone was avoided; included no stalling below 20,000 ft.

The third XP-55 (serial 42-78847) flew for the first time on 25 April 1944. Modifications resulting from the investigation of the crash of the first prototype were introduced during construction; the addition of four-foot wingtip extensions to improve the stall characteristics and increasing the limits of the nose elevator travel to improve recovery if a stall did occur. It was the only prototype to be fitted with armament - four 0.5-inch machine guns.

After the second XP-55 (42-78846) was given the same modifications as the third prototype, it underwent official USAAF flight trials between 16 September and 2 October 1944.

The third prototype XP-55 (s/n 42-78847) was lost on 27 May 1945, during the closing day of the Seventh War Bond Air Show at the Army Air Forces Fair at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio. After a low pass in formation with a Lockheed P-38 Lightning and a North American P-51 Mustang on each wing, its pilot, William C. Glasgow, attempted a slow roll, but lost altitude and crashed, sending flaming debris into occupied civilian ground vehicles on a highway near the airfield. The crash killed Glasgow and four civilians on the ground.

In test flights the XP-55 achieved 390 mph at 19,300 feet but there were engine cooling problems. In terms of overall performance, testing of the XP-55 revealed it to be inferior to conventional fighter aircraft. In addition, by the end of 1944, German and British jet-powered fighters were fully operational, and the Lockheed XP-80 was about to commence operational trials with USAAF units in Italy. Development of completely new piston-engine fighter designs was regarded as redundant; further development of such aircraft was terminated, including the XP-55.

<text>A cover in foreign, military or police human intelligence or counterintelligence is the ostensible identity and/or role or position in an infiltrated organization assumed by a covert agent during a covert operation.

==Official cover==

In espionage, an official cover operative is one who assumes a position in an organization with diplomatic ties to the government for which the operative works such as an embassy or consulate. This provides the agent with official diplomatic immunity, thus protecting them from the steep punishments normally meted out to captured spies. Upon discovery of an official cover agent&#x27;s secret hostile role, the host nation often declares the agent &quot;persona non grata&quot; and orders them to leave the country.
Official cover operatives are granted a set of governmental protections, and if caught in the act of espionage, they can request diplomatic protection from their government. In other words, official cover operatives are agents officially recognized by their country.

==Non-official cover==
In espionage, operatives under non-official cover (NOC) are operatives without official ties to the government for which they work who assume covert roles in organizations.

This is in contrast to an operative with official cover, where they assume a position in their government, such as the diplomatic service, which provides them with diplomatic immunity if their espionage activities are discovered. Operatives under non-official cover do not have this &quot;safety net&quot;, and if captured and charged as spies are subject to severe criminal punishments, up to and including execution. Operatives under non-official cover are also usually trained to deny any connection with their government, thus preserving plausible deniability, but also denying them any hope of diplomatic legal assistance – or official acknowledgment of their service. Such an operative or agent may be referred to as a &quot;NOC&quot; (pronounced ) or as an &quot;illegal&quot; (see Clandestine HUMINT operational techniques). Sometimes, front companies or strawman entities are established in order to provide false identities for agents.

==History==

An agent sent to spy on a foreign country might, for instance, work as a businessperson, a worker for a non-profit organization (such as a humanitarian group), or an academic. For example, the CIA&#x27;s Ishmael Jones spent nearly two decades as a NOC.

Many of the agents memorialized without names or dates of service on the CIA Memorial Wall are assumed to have been killed or executed in a foreign country while serving as NOC agents. In nations with established and well-developed spy agencies, the majority of captured non-native NOC agents have, however, historically been repatriated through prisoner exchanges for other captured NOCs as a form of gentlemen&#x27;s agreement.

Some countries have regulations regarding the use of non-official cover: the CIA, for example, has at times been prohibited from disguising agents as members of certain aid organizations, or as members of the clergy.

The degree of sophistication put into non-official cover stories varies considerably. Sometimes, an agent will simply be appointed to a position in a well-established company which can provide the appropriate opportunities. Other times, entire front companies can be established in order to provide false identities for agents.

Examples include Air America, used by the CIA during the Vietnam War, and Brewster Jennings &amp; Associates, used by the CIA in WMD investigations and made public as a result of the Plame affair.

==Examples==
Former MI6 officer &quot;Nicholas Anderson&quot; wrote an account of his service in a fictionalized autobiography (as per British law) entitled &quot;NOC: Non-Official Cover: British Secret Operations&quot;, and two sequels: &quot;NOC Twice: More UK Non-Official Cover Operations&quot; and &quot;NOC Three Times: Knock-On Effect (Last of the Trilogy)&quot;.

Michael Ross, a former Mossad officer, operated as a Mossad NOC or &quot;combatant&quot; as described in his memoir, &quot;The Volunteer: The Incredible True Story of an Israeli Spy on the Trail of International Terrorists&quot; (Skyhorse Publishing, September 2007, ).

Fictional notable examples include Chuck Barris, who made a satirical claim to have been a NOC with 33 kills in his book and movie &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot;. Other examples are featured in the books &quot;Debt of Honor&quot; and &quot;The Eleventh Commandment&quot;; the films &quot;&quot;, &quot;Spy Game&quot;, &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;, &quot;Safe House&quot;, and &quot;The Recruit&quot;; and the television shows &quot;The Americans&quot;, &quot;Burn Notice&quot;, &quot;Spooks&quot;, &quot;The Night Manager&quot;, &quot;Covert Affairs&quot;, &quot;The Spy&quot;, and &quot;Patriot&quot;.

<text>&quot;Be Thou My Vision&quot; ( or &quot;Rob tú mo bhoile&quot;) is a traditional Christian hymn of Irish origin. The words are based on a Middle Irish poem that has traditionally been attributed to Dallán Forgaill. 

The best-known English version, with some minor variations, was translated in 1905 by Mary Elizabeth Byrne, then made into verse by Eleanor Hull and published in 1912. Since 1919 it has been commonly sung to an Irish folk tune, noted as &quot;Slane&quot; in church hymnals, and is one of the most popular hymns in the United Kingdom.

==Text==

The original Old Irish text, &quot;Rop tú mo Baile&quot;, is often attributed to Saint Dallán Forgaill in the 6th century. However, scholars believe it was written later than that. Some date it to the 8th century; others put it as late as the 10th or 11th century. A 14th-century manuscript attributed to Adhamh Ó Cianáin contains a handwritten copy of the poem in Middle Irish, and is held at the National Library of Ireland. A second manuscript is at the Royal Irish Academy, dating from about the 10th or 11th century.

The text of &quot;Rop tú mo Baile&quot;/&quot;Be Thou My Vision&quot; reflects aspects of life in Early Christian Ireland (c.400-800 AD). The prayer belongs to a type known as a &quot;lorica&quot;, a prayer for protection. The symbolic use of a battle-shield and a sword to invoke the power and protection of God draws on Saint Paul&#x27;s Epistle to the Ephesians (), which refers to &quot;the shield of faith&quot; and &quot;the sword of the Spirit&quot;. Such military symbolism was common in the poetry and hymnnology of Christian monasteries of the period due to the prevalence of clan warfare across Ireland. The poem makes reference to God as &quot;King of the Seven Heavens&quot; and the &quot;High King of Heaven&quot;. This depiction of the Lord God of heaven and earth as a chieftain or High King () is a traditional representation in Irish literature; medieval Irish poetry typically used heroic imagery to cast God as a clan protector.

In 1905, &quot;Rop tú mo Baile&quot; was translated from Old Irish into English by Mary Elizabeth Byrne in &quot;Ériu&quot;, the journal of the School of Irish Learning. The English text was first versified in 1912 by Eleanor Hull, president of the Irish Literary Society, and this is now the most common text used.

==Musical accompaniment==
The hymn is sung to the melody noted as “Slane” in hymnals, an Irish folk tune in time, first published as &quot;With My Love on the Road&quot; in Patrick Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Old Irish Folk Music and Songs&quot; in 1909. The tune is a more elemental distillation of earlier forms, such as &quot;The Hielan&#x27;s o&#x27; Scotland&#x27; and &quot;By the Banks of the Bann,&quot; also compiled in Joyce (1909). The words of &quot;Be Thou My Vision&quot; were first combined with this tune in 1919 (harmonised by Leopold L Dix, 1861-1935), and in a new version harmonised by David Evans in 1927. A further version was harmonised by Erik Routley for the English Hymnal.

It was common practice to attribute hymn tune names to the place where they were collected by folk song collectors, such as Ralph Vaughan Williams who co-edited &quot;The English Hymnal&quot;, published in 1906. Slane is a village in Ireland.

Four more 20th century hymns have been set to the same tune. The first was &quot;Lord of All Hopefulness&quot; written by Jan Struther around 1931. The second was &quot;Lord of Creation, to Thee be All Praise&quot; written by J. C. Winslow and first published in 1961. The third was a popular wedding hymn, &quot;God, In the Planning and Purpose of Life&quot;, written by John L. Bell and Graham Maule and first appearing in publication in 1989. The fourth is &quot;Wake Now My Senses,&quot; written by Thomas Michaelson and published in &quot;Singing the Living Tradition Hymnal&quot; 1994, by the Unitarian Universalist Association.

&quot;Gå inte förbi&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t Walk Past&quot;) is a duet-single set to the tune, recorded by Swedish singer Peter Jöback and Norwegian singer Sissel Kyrkjebø and written by Ulf Schagerman. Jöback sings the lyrics in Swedish while Sissel sings in Norwegian. It was released as a single in 2003 and at an extended reissue of Jöback&#x27;s Christmas album Jag kommer hem igen till jul. It was a hit in Norway and Sweden in the Christmas time of 2003 and a music video directed by Mikadelica was made in Denmark. Norwegian newspaper VG gave it 4 out of 6.

==Lyrics==
The original texts of the now-called &quot;Be Thou My Vision&quot; are in Old Irish similar still in style to Modern Irish. The hymn has been translated into Modern Irish many times. The most popular is that by Aodh Ó Dúgain of Gaoth Dobhair, County Donegal. Two verses of his translation were recorded by his granddaughter Moya Brennan – the first time any part of his text has been publicly recorded. Since then, those two verses have been recorded by many artists, including Roma Downey and Aoife and Iona. These verses are very close translations to the first two of the Old Irish text above.

With Old Irish being the ancestor language of Modern Scottish Gaelic, the song was translated by Céitidh Mhoireasdan and published by Sabhal Mòr Ostaig.

Two variants of Eleanor Hull&#x27;s 1912 English translation exist; one version, commonly used in Irish and Scottish hymnals (including the Hymnbooks of the Church of Scotland), fits the metre 10.10.10.10, while a paraphrased version that is used in English books (such as the &quot;New English Hymnal&quot;) is suitable to an anacrucial metre 10.11.11.11.


===Original Old Irish Text===
Rop tú mo baile, a Choimdiu cride:
ní ní nech aile acht Rí secht nime.

Rop tú mo scrútain i l-ló &#x27;s i n-aidche;
rop tú ad-chëar im chotlud caidche.

Rop tú mo labra, rop tú mo thuicsiu;
rop tussu dam-sa, rob misse duit-siu.

Rop tussu m&#x27;athair, rob mé do mac-su;
rop tussu lem-sa, rob misse lat-su.

Rop tú mo chathscíath, rop tú mo chlaideb;
rop tussu m&#x27;ordan, rop tussu m&#x27;airer.

Rop tú mo dítiu, rop tú mo daingen;
rop tú nom-thocba i n-áentaid n-aingel.

Rop tú cech maithius dom churp, dom anmain;
rop tú mo flaithius i n-nim &#x27;s i talmain.

Rop tussu t&#x27; áenur sainserc mo chride;
ní rop nech aile acht Airdrí nime.

Co talla forum, ré n-dul it láma,

Rop tussu t&#x27; áenur m&#x27; urrann úais amra:
ní chuinngim daíne ná maíne marba.

Rop amlaid dínsiur cech sel, cech sáegul,
mar marb oc brénad, ar t&#x27; fégad t&#x27; áenur.

Do serc im anmain, do grád im chride,

Tabair dam amlaid, a Rí secht nime,

Go Ríg na n-uile rís íar m-búaid léire;

A Athair inmain, cluinte mo núall-sa:
mithig (mo-núarán!) lasin trúagán trúag-sa.

A Chríst mo chride, cip ed dom-aire,
a Flaith na n-uile, rop tú mo baile.

===English translation by Mary Byrne (1905)===
Be thou my vision O Lord of my heart
None other is aught but the King of the seven heavens.

Be thou my meditation by day and night.
May it be thou that I behold ever in my sleep.

Be thou my speech, be thou my understanding.
Be thou with me, be I with thee

Be thou my father, be I thy son.
Mayst thou be mine, may I be thine.

Be thou my battle-shield, be thou my sword.
Be thou my dignity, be thou my delight.

Be thou my shelter, be thou my stronghold.
Mayst thou raise me up to the company of the angels.

Be thou every good to my body and soul.
Be thou my kingdom in heaven and on earth.

Be thou solely chief love of my heart.
Let there be none other, O high King of Heaven.

Till I am able to pass into thy hands,
My treasure, my beloved through the greatness of thy love

Be thou alone my noble and wondrous estate.
I seek not men nor lifeless wealth.

Be thou the constant guardian of every possession and every life.
For our corrupt desires are dead at the mere sight of thee.

Thy love in my soul and in my heart --
Grant this to me, O King of the seven heavens.

O King of the seven heavens grant me this --
Thy love to be in my heart and in my soul.

With the King of all, with him after victory won by piety,
May I be in the kingdom of heaven, O brightness of the sun.

Beloved Father, hear, hear my lamentations.
Timely is the cry of woe of this miserable wretch.

O heart of my heart, whatever befall me,
O ruler of all, be thou my vision.
===Modern Irish translation===
Bí Thusa ’mo shúile a Rí mhór na ndúil
Líon thusa mo bheatha mo chéadfaí ’s mo stuaim
Bí thusa i m&#x27;aigne gach oíche ’s gach lá
Im chodladh nó im dhúiseacht, líon mé le do ghrá.

Bí thusa ’mo threorú i mbriathar ’s i mbeart
Fan thusa go deo liom is coinnigh mé ceart
Glac cúram mar Athair, is éist le mo ghuí
Is tabhair domsa áit cónaí istigh i do chroí.

===English version by Eleanor Hull (1912)===
Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art.
Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son;
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

Be Thou my battle Shield, Sword for the fight;
Be Thou my Dignity, Thou my Delight;
Thou my soul’s Shelter, Thou my high Tow’r:
Raise Thou me heav’nward, O Pow’r of my pow’r.

Riches I heed not, nor man’s empty praise,
Thou mine Inheritance, now and always:
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,
High King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art.

High King of Heaven, my victory won,
May I reach Heaven’s joys, O bright Heav’n’s Sun!
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.

(The English Methodist version from 1964 omits verse 3.)

===Alternative English version by Eleanor Hull (1912)===
Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;
Be all else but naught to me, save that Thou art;
Be Thou my best thought in the day and the night,
Both waking and sleeping, Thy presence my light.

Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;
Be Thou ever with me, and I with Thee, Lord;
Be Thou my great Father, and I Thy true son;
Be Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

Be Thou my Breastplate, my Sword for the fight;
Be Thou my whole Armour, be Thou my true Might;
Be Thou my soul&#x27;s Shelter, be Thou my strong Tow’r,
O raise Thou me heav’nward, great Pow’r of my pow’r.

Riches I heed not, nor man&#x27;s empty praise;
Be Thou mine inheritance, now and always;
Be Thou and Thou only the first in my heart,
O high King of heaven, my Treasure Thou art.

High King of heaven, Thou heaven&#x27;s bright Sun,
O grant me its joys, after vict&#x27;ry is won;
Great Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
Still be Thou my vision, O Ruler of all.

===Modern Scottish Gaelic translation===
Dèan dhòmh-sa tuigse,
Cuir soills’ air mo smuain;
Dh’iarrainn gur Tu
Bhiodh ’gam stiùreadh gach uair;
Làmh rium ’s an oidhche
Is romham ’s an tràth,
Réidh rium ’sa mhadainn
Agus glèidh mi tro’n latha.

Ceartas do m’ bhriathran
Agus fìrinn do m’ bheul,
Thusa toirt iùil dhomh
’S mi dlùth riut, a Dhè.
Athair, thoir gràdh dhomh,
Gabh mis’ thugad fhéin;
Cum mi ri d’ thaobh
Is bi daonnan ’nam chrè.

Dìon mi, a Thighearna,
Ri mo chliathaich ’s gach feachd;
Cùm mi fo d’ sgiath
’S thoir dhomh misneachd is neart,
Fasgadh do m’ anam
Is mi ri d’uchd dlùth;
Treòraich mi dhachaigh,
Dhè chumhachdaich Thu.

Beartas cha’n fhiach leam;
No miann chlann ’nan daoin’,
Thusa na m’ fhianais
Fad làithean mo shaogh’il
Thusa, Dhè ghràsmhoir,
A-mhàin na mo chrìdh’,
Le blàths is gràdh sìorraidh,
Mo Thighearna ’s mo Rìgh.

<text>Sarah Louise Whatmore (born 21 September 1981) is an English singer-songwriter, best known for appearing in the first series of the British TV series &quot;Pop Idol&quot;. Whatmore later went on to launch her own solo career.

==Early life==
Whatmore was born in Salford and raised in Walkden.

== Career ==
===&quot;Pop Idol&quot;===
Sarah Whatmore rose to fame in the first series of the British television show &quot;Pop Idol&quot;. Simon Fuller signed her to RCA Records including a worldwide management deal with 19 Entertainment.

===Music career===
In 2002 and 2003 she released two singles &quot;When I Lost You&quot; and &quot;Automatic&quot;, respectively, which both reached the Top 20 in the UK Singles Chart. Whatmore was writing for fellow &quot;Pop Idol&quot; alumni, and spent time working on her debut album, &quot;Living Proof&quot;.

A third single failed to materialise, and the release of &quot;Living Proof&quot; was cancelled. Several recordings were leaked over the years, including &quot;Close To Me&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Go&quot;.

Turning down the opportunity to become a backing singer for Kylie Minogue to concentrate on her own solo career, Whatmore spent the next five years honing her craft. During the years she wrote more than two hundred songs with various collaborators including Greg Fitzgerald and Peter John Vettese. Whatmore continued to record and write for herself as well as other musicians.

In 2008, she came up with an album of new material. The first single was titled &quot;Smile&quot;, and was released on 22 September 2008. It contained a sample of Hall &amp; Oates&#x27; &quot;Sara Smile&quot;. The single included remixes by Bimbo Jones and Vito Benito. The album, &quot;Time To Think&quot;, was released on 23 March 2009. Her next single from the album was &quot;Undefined&quot;.

In 2016 Whatmore started to officially release music again and published 3 tracks throughout the year, Whatmore released her first EP &quot;Full Circle&quot; on 24 March 2016.
