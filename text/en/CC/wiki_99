<text>Pontypridd Rugby Football Club () is a rugby union team from Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Wales. It won the Indigo Group Premiership for four consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2015 as well as the WRU National Cup on 6 different occasions, most recently in 2014.

Established in 1876, Pontypridd RFC play their home games on the banks of the River Rhondda at Sardis Road, Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taf in Wales, with their age-grade section playing at Taff Vale Park in Pontypridd, and Pontypridd High School Fields in nearby Cilfynydd.

Pontypridd RFC experienced a successful period during the 1990s—referred to as the club&#x27;s &quot;Golden Age&quot;—under head coach Dennis John, and they enjoyed further success between 2001 and 2003 with the appointment of head coach Lynn Howells. The transition to Regional Rugby in Wales in 2003 saw the downgrading of Pontypridd to a semi-professional team, followed by financial difficulties for the club and the eventual demise of Pontypridd&#x27;s &quot;Celtic Warriors&quot; region.

Pontypridd RFC has since refinanced and restructured and, despite a mooted stadium sale, continues to be regarded as a relatively successful rugby team in the South Wales Valleys.

Pontypridd RFC has produced several players who went on to play for the Wales national rugby union team.

==Club history==

=== Early history ===
Pontypridd RFC were formed in 1876 by a number of young local men who moved into the area during the Industrial Revolution. However, the first reported match involving Pontypridd was played on 18 December 1873 against Roath (Cardiff). They were represented at a meeting in Tenby in 1880 that would later lead to the formation of the Welsh Rugby Union in 1881. Pontypridd&#x27;s Edward Treharne, who also played for Cowbridge Grammar School as a student, was named in the first Welsh International side in 1881. Pontypridd supplied two more players to the Welsh team before the turn of the 19th century, Tom Williams and Ernie George.

In their early days, Pontypridd RFC played their home games at Taff Vale Park in Treforest, the current home of their junior section, before moving to the &quot;People&#x27;s Park&quot; alongside the River Rhondda. However, in 1908 they moved once more to a new home in Ynysangharad Park in Pontypridd itself, where they would stay for 65 years.

===1945–1989===
Pontypridd has historically been considered a club with a lower profile compared to some of the more prominent Welsh rugby clubs. Players at Pontypridd sometimes faced challenges in breaking into the national team while playing for the club, which led some to join higher-profile teams. Despite this, the club secured a series of top-ten finishes in the unofficial Welsh league, and winning the competition in the 1962/1963 season.

However the 1970s would bring Pontypridd its first period of real success. Following the redevelopment of the A470 trunk road near their home ground, the team moved to its current home of Sardis Road in Pontypridd in 1974. This move was immediately followed by success in the unofficial league championship, winning it in 1975–76, 1977–78 and 1978–79 whilst never falling from the top four for seven years under the captaincy of Bob Penberthy and Tommy David.

===1990–2002===
The 1990s saw a large change in Welsh rugby, especially with the inauguration of the first official Welsh leagues in 1990. Pontypridd were placed in the top division for that season and have until now never been out of the top-level in the Welsh game. They secured third places in 1991–92, 1993–94 and 1995–96 plus a runner up finish to Cardiff RFC.

During the 1993–94 season there was speculation about the possibility of Anglo-Welsh competition containing only the &#x27;Big Four&#x27; Welsh clubs of Cardiff, Neath, Swansea and Llanelli. Pontypridd&#x27;s 27–12 victory over Neath in November was considered to have made the case for a &#x27;Big Five&#x27;, and coach Dennis John expressed pleasure at having put an end to such speculation later in the season following a narrow defeat to Cardiff in the Welsh Cup semi-final.

In 1996 the club won its first official major honour, beating Neath RFC in the final of the Welsh Cup. They repeated this achievement again in 2002 and 2006. The following season (1997) saw them win the Welsh League, narrowly over the same opponents. Both of these successes were obtained by what many consider Pontypridd&#x27;s best ever team, led by Nigel Bezani and including players such as Richie Collins, Neil Jenkins, Paul John and Dale McIntosh.

During the 2001–02 season, Pontypridd enjoyed a successful campaign, winning the Principality Cup and narrowly losing to Sale Sharks in the final of the Parker Pen Shield competition.

From then until 2003 Pontypridd consistently finished in the top five of the league but failed to challenge for top spot (and to qualify for the Heineken Cup – Europe&#x27;s top tournament) as they struggled to cope with the added financial pressures of the newly professional game, losing a number of players to larger clubs and relying heavily upon their much admired youth academy system. However, in 2003 the Welsh Rugby Union would change the game in Wales forever with the advent of Welsh Regional Rugby.

===2003–present===

After much negotiation and rumour of a merger with local rivals Cardiff RFC, Pontypridd finally found themselves in a partnership with Bridgend RFC, forming the Celtic Warriors that would represent the whole of the South Wales Valleys region.

However financial difficulties at Pontypridd lead the team to sell its stake in the Warriors to Bridgend RFC benefactor Leighton Samuel and all games were moved away from Sardis Road before the club was dissolved by the WRU in the summer of 2004.

They were then reformed as Ponty Rugby Ltd playing at a semi professional level in the newly formed Welsh Premiership and unpopularly placed under the umbrella of local rivals Cardiff Blues by the WRU, Pontypridd continue to be the top team in the Glamorganshire south Wales Valleys and are considered by many of their fans to be the Valleys&#x27; regional representative side, with Cardiff still perceived by the residents of the Valleys as rivals.

In 2005 Pontypridd were the beaten finalists in the WRU Challenge Cup, narrowly losing to Llanelli 24–25, having led 24–8 with only 10 minutes remaining until a former Pontypridd player Neil Boobyer was brought into the game and helped turn the game around in Llanelli&#x27;s favour.

The following year they would surpass their previous season&#x27;s record as Saturday 6 May 2006 Pontypridd beat Neath 26–25 to win the WRU Challenge Cup (then called the Konica Minolta Cup, and currently called the SWALEC Cup after the sponsors of the tournament) in a final at the Millennium Stadium. Neath were pre-match favourites having recently secured the Welsh Premier league by a large points margin, and going into the game chasing a league and cup &#x27;double&#x27;. This was a replay of the 1996 final, when Pontypridd had also stopped Neath RFC &#x27;doing the double&#x27;.

17 May 2008 saw Pontypridd enter a repeat performance against Neath at the Millennium Stadium. The score, however, was not to be repeated, as Neath beat Pontypridd 28–22.

In the 2010–11 season, Pontypridd secured the Swalec Cup with a 35–24 victory over Aberavon at the Millennium Stadium. They also finished first in the Principality Premiership with 107 points. However, with the introduction of play-offs to determine the overall league champions, they were defeated in the final at Sardis Road by third-placed Llanelli, preventing a potential double. Additionally, they reached the semi-finals of the British &amp; Irish Cup, where they were eliminated by eventual winners Bristol.

The club reached two finals in the following season. On 7 May 2012, they were defeated by Cross Keys in the Swalec Cup final, with a score of 32–19. However, they were crowned Welsh Champions for the first time in 15 years after securing a second consecutive first-place finish in the Principality Premiership. This led to a play-off final victory over Llanelli at Sardis Road on 18 May. The club also made the Quarter-Finals of the British &amp; Irish Cup, losing away to Leinster &#x27;A&#x27;.

The 2012–13 season was one of the most successful in the club&#x27;s history, as Pontypridd won both the league and cup, completing a historic double. First beating Neath in the final of the Swalec Cup on 4 May 2013, 34–13 and then after finishing 23 points clear in the Principality Premiership with 21 wins from 22 matches they secured the title by defeating Llanelli in the Play-Off Final at Sardis Road on 18 May by 47–15.

The 2013–14 season saw Pontypridd repeat their success from the previous year, winning both the Swalec Cup and the Principality Premiership title. They claimed the Swalec Cup on 4 May 2014, defeating Cross Keys 21–8 at the Millennium Stadium. After finishing at the top of the Principality Premiership for the fourth consecutive season, they secured a third successive league title on 18 May 2014 with a 38–17 victory over Cross Keys in the play-off final at Sardis Road. The club also defeated London Welsh, London Scottish and Cornish Pirates on the way to the British &amp; Irish Cup Semi-Finals before exiting the competition against Leinster &#x27;A&#x27; following a defeat on try count following a 22–22 draw. The 2014–15 season saw Pontypridd reach a fifth consecutive Swalec Cup final, but they were defeated by Bridgend. However, they finished first in the Principality Premiership for the fifth successive season and secured a fourth consecutive league title with a 28–14 victory over Ebbw Vale in the play-off final at Sardis Road on 17 May 2015.

Despite playing at the highest level attainable by a non-regional side, Pontypridd RFC has experienced a decline in its fan base, partly due to the shift of Welsh rugby supporters in the Valleys to Cardiff Blues as their regional team. Nevertheless, Pontypridd retains one of the largest club followings in Wales.

Former Pontypridd players seen wearing the red of Wales in recent years include Gethin Jenkins, Kevin Morgan, Richard Parks, Michael Owen, Martyn Williams, Dafydd James, Mefin Davies, Brent Cockbain, Robert Sidoli, Sonny Parker, Ceri Sweeney, Ian Evans, Matthew Rees, Morgan Stoddart, Cory Hill, Kristian Dacey, Seb Davies, Dillon Lewis, Tomos Williams and Jarrod Evans.

==Club shield==

The club shield denotes the town of Pontypridd&#x27;s famous arched bridge – once the largest single-span bridge in Europe – built by William Edwards in 1756 and known as the &quot;Old Bridge&quot;.

The chevrons are an interpretation of the ancient arms of Iestyn ap Gwrgant, the last ruler of the Kingdom of Morgannwg. The de Clare family – Norman Lords of the Welsh Marches, under whose authority the ancient shire of Glamorgan was placed – used a similar design to Gwrgant&#x27;s arms. Both sets of chevrons were once seen on the coat of arms of Mid Glamorgan County Council, in which the town of Pontypridd was situated prior to the Local Government Act of 1994.

An identical chevron design is now seen in the coat of arms of Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council, which superseded Mid Glamorgan.

The black and white colours are the team colours of Pontypridd RFC.
== Sponsorship ==

Pontypridd&#x27;s most notable main sponsor was local company, Buy As You View. The company began life as Just Rentals in Tonypandy in 1976, and sponsored Pontypridd RFC from the early nineties until 2004. It employed numerous former players, including Neil Jenkins and Lee Beach and ran the Buy As You View Schools Rugby Initiative, working in partnership with Pontypridd RFC.

Pontypridd&#x27;s main sponsor from 2004 to 2009 was Pontypridd-based environmental and waste management company, Egan Waste Services.

In 2009, Pontypridd-based company Amber Electrical become the club&#x27;s main sponsors in a highly publicised partnership deal.

2010 saw Egan Waste Services step up their support of Pontypridd by becoming the club&#x27;s main sponsors once more.

Club kit has been supplied by numerous firms, including Umbro, Hogger Sports, Cica, Rossco, Canterbury of New Zealand, Kukri Sports, Errea, Rhino Rugby and Mizuno. Kappa became the club&#x27;s kit suppliers for the start of the 2018–19 season.

==Cup Final history==
==Team management, players and former players==

===Team management===
Pontypridd RFC have been led by a number of high-profile coaches since the 1980s, Clive Jones – a prominent figure in Treorchy RFC&#x27;s 1993/94 Heineken League successes – was instrumental in ensuring Pontypridd&#x27;s place in the top tier during the latter part of the eighties.

In 1992, Dennis John took over as head coach, assisted by former Pontypridd flanker, Lynn Howells, and led Pontypridd into what is widely regarded as their &quot;Golden Age&quot;, with Ponty winning the Welsh Cup Final in the 1995–96 season, and winning the Welsh Premier League in the 1996–97 season.

With the departure of John in 1999, former Pontypridd and Wales flanker, Richie Collins became head coach, and while some significant scalps – notably a win over Heineken Cup winners Leicester in 2000 – came his way, his tenure in charge was short-lived.

In September 2001, Clive Jones rejoined Pontypridd as director of rugby, and had, by December 2001, brought Lynn Howells back from Cardiff, who then proceeded to marshal the club to become Principality Cup winners in May 2002 and guided the team to the final of the Parker Pen European Shield days later.
The advent of Regional Rugby in 2003 saw Howells depart to become coach of parent-region, the Celtic Warriors, with former Pontypridd flanker, Justin Burnell filling the void.

Burnell&#x27;s departure in 2004 was followed by the appointment of former Pontypridd flanker, Simon King who, along with assistant coach, former Pontypridd and Wales captain and scrum-half Paul John, guided Pontypridd to the final of the Konica Minolta Cup in 2004–05, before winning it in 2005–06.

Paul John took over as head coach in at the commencement of the 2006–07 season, and, assisted by former Pontypridd and Wales back row, Dale McIntosh, led the club to the final of the Konica Minolta Cup in 2007/08.

During May 2010, it was decided that Paul John and Dale McIntosh would switch roles, as the demands on John in his capacity as head coach of the Wales Sevens team were becoming too great. Dale McIntosh therefore leads Pontypridd into the 2010–11 season as head coach, while Paul John assumes the mantle of assistant coach.

McIntosh left his role in October 2013 to take up a full-time position with the Cardiff Blues, leading to a restructure of the Pontypridd coaching team with Paul John as head coach, being backed up by Gareth Wyatt and Geraint Lewis with another former Wales international Garin Jenkins also joining the backroom staff. After playing his part in continuing the club&#x27;s success, Lewis has since departed to become a full-time WRU skills coach being replaced as forwards coach by another former Pontypridd player in Robert Sidoli.

Justin Burnell returned to Pontypridd as director of rugby in the summer of 2017, replacing the previous coaching team of John and Sidoli, whilst Paul Matthews replaced Wyatt, who departed to join up with the Wales Women&#x27;s team the following year.

The current team manager is former Pontypridd player, Dan Godfrey, and the Forwards coach is Lee Davies.

==Pontypridd youth and junior teams==
With the loss of their extremely successful Academy set up that was handed over to their Cardiff rivals by the WRU, Pontypridd RFC re-formed a Youth side in 2006, coached by Sean Oliver and Wayne Gristock (formerly Porth Harlequins RFC).

Starting in the bottom division of the Blues league, the side made progress that saw them earn the nickname the &#x27;Upstarts&#x27;, when after a successful first season that saw them promoted seven divisions to the BB League (Blues Second Division).

The following season saw the formation of a second Youth team who again had to start in the bottom league and were coached by former Pontypridd players Dai Legge and Mike Kelleher. By the end of the 2007/8 season both youth teams had won their respective leagues outright and earned automatic promotion, with the senior youth now playing in the top division in only their third season since forming. Several youth players have gained honours, including representative honours with Welsh Crawshays and Welsh Schoolboys, with players in the Cardiff Blues Academy and several older players now training with Pontypridd RFC&#x27;s senior team.

Behind this youth setup is the Pontypridd Mini &amp; Junior Section that was formed in 1997, the section started out with just a handful of junior players and volunteer coaches, but has grown into one of the biggest junior sections in Wales. The section contains every age group from under 7s to under 16s, with the youth sides containing players under the age of 19; with almost 300 young players in their ever-swelling ranks. The section has been successful, winning multiple tournaments and competing successfully in international tournaments throughout Europe.

At the commencement of the 2008–09 season, it was decided that both Senior and Junior Youth teams would merge, forming a large and capable new Pontypridd Youth section. The new season will see a single squad of 35 players being selected, playing in the 2008–09 RAF Youth League: Blues Region. The squad is coached by Wayne Gristock and Sean Oliver, and managed by Chris Kingsbury MBE.

Prior to the commencement of the 2010–11 season, notification was given of a major change in the running of the Youth section, as it was decided that the section would transfer from the hands of the Mini &amp; Junior Rugby section, and would instead fall under the remit of the senior Team Management. The hope is to discover new stars of the future, who will regularly train alongside the main body of the senior XV, echoing the past achievements of the Pontypridd Youth setup in bringing Michael Owen, Gethin Jenkins and Ceri Sweeney, amongst others, to the attention of the World.

<doc id="872918" wikidata="Q5631235" url="?curid=872918" title="HMS Agincourt (1865)">
<text>HMS &quot;Agincourt&quot; was a armoured frigate built for the Royal Navy during the 1860s. She spent most of her career as the flagship of the Channel Squadron&#x27;s second-in-command. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, she was one of the ironclads sent to Constantinople to forestall a Russian occupation of the Ottoman capital. &quot;Agincourt&quot; participated in Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee Fleet Review in 1887. The ship was placed in reserve two years later and served as a training ship from 1893 to 1909. That year she was converted into a coal hulk and renamed as &quot;C.109&quot;. &quot;Agincourt&quot; served at Sheerness until sold for scrap in 1960.

==Design and description==
The three &quot;Minotaur&quot;-class armoured frigates were essentially enlarged versions of the ironclad with heavier armament, armour, and more powerful engines. They retained the broadside ironclad layout of their predecessor, but their sides were fully armoured to protect the 50 guns they were designed to carry. Their plough-shaped ram was also more prominent than that of &quot;Achilles&quot;.

The ships were long between perpendiculars and long overall. They had a beam of and a draft of . The &quot;Minotaur&quot;-class ships displaced . Their hull was subdivided by 15 watertight transverse bulkheads and had a double bottom underneath the engine and boiler rooms.

&quot;Agincourt&quot; was considered &quot;an excellent sea-boat and a steady gun platform, but unhandy under steam and practically unmanageable under sail&quot; as built. The ship&#x27;s steadiness was partially a result of her metacentric height of .

===Propulsion===

&quot;Agincourt&quot; had one 2-cylinder horizontal return connecting rod-steam engine, made by Maudslay, driving a single propeller using steam provided by 10 rectangular fire-tube boilers. It produced a total of during the ship&#x27;s sea trials on 12 December 1865 and &quot;Agincourt&quot; had a maximum speed of . The ship carried of coal, enough to steam at .

&quot;Agincourt&quot; had five masts and a sail area of . &quot;Agincourt&quot; only made under sail mainly because the ship&#x27;s propeller could only be disconnected and not hoisted up into the stern of the ship to reduce drag. Both funnels were semi-retractable to reduce wind resistance while under sail. 

In a series of technical articles he wrote on the armoured vessels of the mid-Victorian Navy, for the quarterly &quot;Mariner&#x27;s Mirror&quot;, Admiral George A. Ballard described &quot;Agincourt&quot; and her sisters as &quot;the dullest performers under canvas of the whole masted fleet of their day, and no ships ever carried so much dress to so little purpose.&quot; In 1893–1894, after her withdrawal from active service, &quot;Agincourt&quot; had two masts removed and was re-rigged as a barque. In 1907 the upper portions of one of her masts was installed at the shore establishment HMS &quot;Ganges&quot; for use in the training of boy seamen.

===Armament===

The armament of the &quot;Minotaur&quot;-class ships was intended to be 40 rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns on the main deck and 10 more on the upper deck on pivot mounts. The gun was a new design from Armstrong, but proved a failure a few years after its introduction. The gun was withdrawn before any were received by any of the &quot;Minotaur&quot;-class ships. They were armed, instead, with a mix of and rifled muzzle-loading guns. All 4 nine-inch and 20 seven-inch guns were mounted on the main deck while 4 seven-inch guns were fitted on the upper deck as chase guns. The ship also received eight brass howitzers for use as saluting guns. The gun ports were wide which allowed each gun to fire 30° fore and aft of the beam.

&quot;Agincourt&quot; was rearmed in 1875 with a uniform armament of 17 nine-inch guns, 14 on the main deck, 2 forward chase guns and 1 rear chase gun. The gun ports had to be enlarged to accommodate the larger guns by hand, at a cost of £250 each. About 1883 two breech-loading guns replaced 2 nine-inch muzzle-loading guns. Four quick-firing (QF) 4.7-inch (120 mm) guns, eight QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns, eight machine guns and two torpedo tubes were installed in 1891–1892.

===Armour===
The entire side of the &quot;Minotaur&quot;-class ships was protected by wrought-iron armour that tapered from at the ends to amidships, except for a section of the bow between the upper and main decks. The armour extended below the waterline. A single 5.5-inch transverse bulkhead protected the forward chase guns on the upper deck. The armour was backed by of teak.

==Construction and service==
HMS &quot;Agincourt&quot;, named after the victory at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, was originally ordered on 2 September 1861 as HMS &quot;Captain&quot;, but her name was changed during construction. She was laid down on 30 October 1861 by Laird&#x27;s at its shipyard in Birkenhead. The ship was launched on 27 March 1865, commissioned in June 1868 for sea trials and completed on 19 December. The lengthy delay in completion was due to frequent changes in design details, and experiments with her armament and with her sailing rig. The ship cost a total of £483,003.

&quot;Agincourt&quot;″s first assignment, together with her half-sister , was to tow a floating drydock from England to Madeira where it would be picked up by and and taken to Bermuda. The ships departed the Nore on 23 June 1869, loaded down with of coal stowed in bags on their gun decks, and transferred the floating dock 11 days later after an uneventful voyage. &quot;Agincourt&quot; was assigned to the Channel Squadron upon her return and she became the flagship of the second-in-command of the fleet until she began a refit in 1873.

===1871 grounding on Pearl Rock===

It was during this assignment that she suffered a near-catastrophe when she ran aground on Pearl Rock, near Gibraltar on 1 July 1871 and nearly sank. &quot;Agincourt&quot; was leading the inshore column of ships, contrary to normal practice where the senior flagship lead the inshore column, and gently ran aground sideways when the senior flagship&#x27;s navigator failed to compensate for the set of the tide. &quot;Warrior&quot;, immediately following her, nearly collided with her, but managed to sheer off in time.

&quot;Agincourt&quot; was stuck fast and had to be lightened; her guns were removed and much of her coal was tossed overboard before she was towed off by , commanded by Lord Gilford, four days later. Heavy weather set in the night after &quot;Agincourt&quot; was freed and it would have wrecked her if she had still been aground. Both the fleet commander and his deputy were relieved of their commands as a result of the incident. The ship was repaired in Devonport at a cost of £1,195 and Captain J.O. Hopkins assumed command in September with Commander Charles Penrose-Fitzgerald as his executive officer. Hopkins later commented: &quot;We turned the &quot;Agincourt&quot; from the noisiest and the worst disciplined ship in the squadron into the quietest and the smartest; and a few months after we commissioned we went out to the Mediterranean for the &quot;Lord Clyde&quot; court-martial, and beat the whole Mediterranean fleet in their drills and exercises, which was a great triumph.&quot;

In 1873, Vice Admiral Sir Geoffrey Hornby, commander of the Channel Squadron, transferred his flag to &quot;Agincourt&quot; as her sister &quot;Minotaur&quot;, his former flagship, was taken in hand for a refit that lasted until 1875. That year &quot;Agincourt&quot; was paid off in turn for a refit and re-armament that lasted until 1877. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, the government became concerned that the Russians might advance on the Ottoman capital of Constantinople and ordered Hornby to form a Particular Service Squadron to show the flag at Constantinople and deter any Russian threat. &quot;Agincourt&quot; served as the flagship for his second-in-command and the squadron sailed up the Dardanelles in a blinding snowstorm in February 1878. After those tensions faded, the ship returned to the Channel, where she served as second flag until 1889 including during Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee Fleet Review in 1887. Over her active career, she served as flagship to no fewer than 15 admirals. That year she was again paid off and was subsequently held in reserve at Portsmouth until 1893, when she was transferred to Portland for use as a training ship.

&quot;Agincourt&quot; served twelve years at Portland, as a depot ship for boys. She was renamed &quot;Boscawen III&quot; in March, 1904. In 1905 she was moved to Harwich and renamed as &quot;Ganges II&quot;. After four years at Harwich, the ship was towed to Sheerness in 1909. After her arrival the old ship was converted into a coal hulk known simply as &quot;C.109&quot;. After five ignominious decades as what naval historian Oscar Parkes called &quot;a grimy, dilapidated and incredibly shrunken relic&quot; of her former self, she was scrapped beginning on 21 October 1960.

<doc id="872919" wikidata="Q7304229" url="?curid=872919" title="Red Hat, Inc. v. SCO Group, Inc.">
<text>Red Hat v. SCO is a lawsuit filed by Red Hat against The SCO Group on August 4, 2003. Red Hat was asking for a permanent injunction against SCO&#x27;s Linux campaign and a number of declaratory judgments that Red Hat has not violated SCO&#x27;s copyrights.

==Background==
Beginning in 2003, SCO Group has initiated a number of lawsuits and claims that Linux infringed SCO&#x27;s copyrights and that users and vendors of Linux should be held accountable for these infringements. Some statements even suggest that users of Linux could expect legal action from The SCO Group. Red Hat is a long time Linux vendor.

==The lawsuit==
As a response to these allegations, Red Hat filed suit against SCO in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on August 4, 2003. According to the filing, Red Hat has requested that the court make:
* a permanent injunction against SCO&#x27;s campaign against Linux 
* 2 declaratory judgments, that Red Hat has not violated SCO&#x27;s copyrights, that Red Hat has not violated SCO&#x27;s trade secrets and several other claims for relief

SCO replied with both a press release and two letters to Red Hat on the same day; their claims are reiterated in the press release (&quot;Linux includes source code that is a verbatim copy of UNIX and carries with it no warranty or indemnification. SCO&#x27;s claims are true and we look forward to proving them in court.&quot;), and the allegations made by Red Hat are denied (&quot;SCO has not been trying to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt to end users.&quot;). The letters to Red Hat also hint at possible legal retaliations against Red Hat, saying:

On September 15, 2003, SCO filed a motion to dismiss, claiming there is no actual controversy between SCO and Red Hat and that Red Hat could not establish a reasonable apprehension that SCO will sue it for copyright infringement or misappropriation. In fact they claimed that the statements made by SCO representatives in the press that lead Red Hat to believe so were either misquoted or taken out of context. On the question of false advertising, SCO defended themselves by claiming that its statements were fully protected by the first amendment.

Red Hat wanted to proceed as quickly as possible and start discovery. Red Hat sent their first interrogatories, but on October 2, 2003, The SCO Group also filed a motion to stay discovery until the motion to dismiss is heard. Additionally they filed a motion asking for more time to answer Red Hat&#x27;s first interrogatories.

For over 4 months, both parties waited for a response of the judge. Finally, Red Hat filed a motion to supplement the record with additional information. The additional information contained two letters sent by The SCO Group to Lehman Brothers, a Red Hat customer. In the first letter SCO once again claims ownership of Unix and that certain portions of Linux infringe on its Unix copyrights. In the second letter SCO threatened legal action if Lehman Brothers did not remedy the infringement. A letter sent by Lehman Brothers&#x27; counsel instructed SCO to take this matter up with Red Hat, their supplier of Linux products.

During the next 2 months, Red Hat and SCO fought about whether or not this additional, potentially damaging, information should be entered into the record. That fight came to an end when the judge finally made a decision.

In her opinion, dated April 6, 2004, Judge Robinson denied SCO&#x27;s motion to dismiss. Additionally she stayed the lawsuit pending the resolution of the SCO v. IBM lawsuit, which makes the motion to supplement the record, the motion to stay discovery and the motion for more time to answer Red Hat&#x27;s first interrogatories moot.

On April 21, 2004, Red Hat filed a motion to reconsider the stay, claiming SCO never asked for a stay and that a stay was inappropriate because the issues in the SCO v. IBM case would not solve the issues in the Red Hat v. SCO case. The SCO Group filed several memoranda in opposition of this motion.

On March 31, 2005, Red Hat&#x27;s motion was denied, so the case now remains stayed until SCO v. IBM is resolved. The parties have to submit a letter to the court every 90 days.

On October 11, 2007 the case was closed with leave to reopen after the SCO group leaves Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

On April 18, 2008, Red Hat filed a claim with the court handling the SCO bankruptcy to have potential libel damages recognized by SCO as a liability if SCO loses future legal action. SCO objected and Red Hat filed again in pursuit of their claim.

<text>HMS &quot;Agincourt&quot; was a 64-gun third-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched on 23 July 1796 at Blackwall Yard, London. The Admiralty bought her on the stocks from the East India Company in 1796, who had called her &quot;Earl Talbot&quot;.

&quot;Agincourt&quot; served in the navy&#x27;s Egyptian campaign between 8 March 1801 and 2 September, which qualified her officers and crew for the clasp &quot;Egypt&quot; to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty authorized in 1850 to all surviving claimants.

She was at Gibraltar 7 November 1803.

She and HMS Argo arrived at Malta from Egypt 15 March 1804 under command of Capt. Briggs.

She was decommissioned in 1809 and converted to a troop ship on 6 January 1812 under the name HMS &quot;Bristol&quot;.

==Fate==
&quot;Bristol&quot; was sold on 15 December 1814 on condition that she be broken up immediately. She sold for £4,510.

<doc id="872922" wikidata="Q7389252" url="?curid=872922" title="SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc.">
<text>SCO v. Novell was a United States lawsuit in which the software company The SCO Group (SCO), claimed ownership of the source code for the Unix operating system. SCO sought to have the court declare that SCO owned the rights to the Unix code, including the copyrights, and that Novell had committed slander of title by asserting a rival claim to ownership of the Unix copyrights. Separately, SCO was attempting to collect license fees from Linux end-users for Unix code (that they alleged was copied into Linux) through their SCOsource division, and Novell&#x27;s rival ownership claim was a direct challenge to this initiative. Novell had been increasing their investments in and support of Linux at this time, and was opposed to SCO&#x27;s attempts to collect license fees from Novell&#x27;s potential customers.

The case hinged upon the interpretation of asset-transfer agreements governing Novell&#x27;s sale of their Unix business to one of SCO&#x27;s predecessor companies, the Santa Cruz Operation. The original APA explicitly excluded all copyrights from the assets transferred from Novell to the Santa Cruz Operation. The second amendment to the APA amended the agreement to exclude all copyrights, &quot;except for the copyrights required for the Santa Cruz Operation to exercise its rights&quot; under the APA. The list of included assets was never amended, which caused ambiguity years after the deal was signed. At trial, Novell successfully argued that they had retained copyrights to protect their 95% ownership of Unix SVRX royalties, and that the amendment to the exclusion clause was merely affirming that the Santa Cruz Operation had a license to the Unix code.

Novell counter-sued with their own duelling slander of title claim and several additional claims against SCO related to the APA and asked the Court to find that SCO had breached the agreements by signing Unix license agreements with Sun Microsystems and Microsoft without paying Novell the agreed percentage of those agreements. Novell further asked the court to find that Novell retained the right to direct SCO to waive rights under existing Unix licenses at &quot;Novell&#x27;s sole discretion&quot;, and that they had the right to take the action on SCO&#x27;s behalf if SCO refused (a purported right that Novell had used repeatedly in the months leading up to the lawsuit to waive SCO&#x27;s claims against IBM and others). Additional claims and counterclaims were added by the parties before resolution of the case.

Novell was found to be the owner of the Unix copyrights, to have the right to direct SCO to waive its claims against IBM and other Unix licensees (and to do so on behalf of SCO if they refused), and SCO was found to have breached the asset-transfer agreements and to have committed conversion of Novell&#x27;s property. SCO prevailed on none of their claims against Novell.

== Background ==

Novell, a vendor of proprietary network operating systems, acquired the rights to the original Unix source code when it purchased Unix System Laboratories from Unix&#x27;s creator, AT&amp;T Corporation, on June 14, 1993. Novell&#x27;s rights to parts of the Unix source code were established as part of the settlement in &quot;USL v. BSDi&quot;.

On September 19, 1995, Novell entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) with the Santa Cruz Operation, a Unix vendor. The APA transferred certain rights regarding Unix, and Novell&#x27;s UnixWare version of Unix, from Novell to the Santa Cruz Operation. These rights included the right to develop and market new versions of UnixWare, and the right to license SVRX (System V Release X) UNIX incidentally or with Novell&#x27;s permission. It also required the Santa Cruz Operation to act as Novell&#x27;s agent for the collection for certain royalties due under such licenses.

In 2000, Caldera Systems acquired the Server Software and Services divisions of the Santa Cruz Operation, as well as the UnixWare and OpenServer Unix technologies. Caldera Systems thus became the legal successor to the Santa Cruz Operation for the purposes of the APA. A year later Caldera Systems changed its name to Caldera International in 2001 and to The SCO Group (SCO) in 2002. Although the Santa Cruz Operation was colloquially known as &quot;SCO&quot;, legally The SCO Group is a different company from the Santa Cruz Operation.

=== SCO goes on the offensive ===
In 2003, SCO initiated a campaign to compel Linux users to pay them software license fees, claiming that unspecified SCO intellectual property had been improperly included in Linux. As part of this campaign, SCO made several statements that they were the owners of Unix, implying that they held the copyright for the original AT&amp;T source code of Unix, and derivatives of that code. After SCO filed suit against IBM, claiming that IBM had violated SCO&#x27;s copyrights to Unix, Novell publicly responded to these allegations.

=== Novell asserts it owns the copyrights ===
On May 28, 2003, Novell issued a press release titled &quot;Novell Challenges SCO Position, Reiterates Support for Linux&quot; where they publicly challenged SCO&#x27;s assertions that Unix code had been copied into Linux, or that SCO owned the Unix copyrights.

On June 6, 2003, SCO held a press conference in which it revealed a second amendment to the &quot;asset purchase agreement between Novell and Santa Cruz Operation&quot;. SCO claimed this amendment supported its claim to the Unix copyrights. This amendment did not change the included assets list (which still did not list copyrights), but instead amended the excluded assets list to continue to exclude copyrights, except those &quot;required&quot; by SCO. In response, Novell issued a press release in which it stated:

While SCO publicly claimed victory, behind the scenes SCO and Novell traded a series of heated letters. In a flurry of private letters, Novell continued its claim that they still were the legal owner of the Unix copyrights, and exercised a series of rights under the APA over the following months (including issuing waivers of SCO&#x27;s claims against certain parties, auditing SCO&#x27;s collection of Unix SVRX royalties, demanding access to all versions of Unix code under SCO&#x27;s control per the APA&#x27;s related Technology License Agreement and issuing a cease and desist against SCO for seeking information from former Novell executives). The relationship between the companies quickly deteriorated.

On October 14, 2003, Novell registered several key Unix copyrights with the United States Copyright Office and submitted declarations for recordation against SCO&#x27;s own Unix copyright registrations. These declarations stated: &quot;The SCO Group, Inc. ... has failed ... to demonstrate that any of the Unix copyrights owned by Novell are required for SCO to exercise its rights...&quot; and that &quot;Novell hereby declares that it retains all or substantially all of the ownership of the copyrights in Unix, including [SCO&#x27;s] U.S. Copyright Registration referenced above&quot;.

After the registrations became public knowledge, Novell issued a press release on December 22, 2003, stating:

On January 13, 2004, Novell announced that it was indemnifying Linux users, agreeing to protect them from lawsuits by third parties, like SCO, on the basis of violating the copyrights claimed by Novell. The same day, Novell released over 30 letters that SCO and Novell had exchanged in the previous months. SCO immediately responded with a press release reiterating its earlier claim, and announcing that it was preparing to file a lawsuit against Novell.

== The lawsuit ==
=== Utah state court ===
SCO filed a &quot;slander of title&quot; lawsuit against Novell on January 20, 2004. Filed in Utah state court, the lawsuit requested both preliminary and permanent injunctions assigning all of Novell&#x27;s Unix copyright registrations to SCO and forcing Novell to retract all of their claims to the Unix code.

=== United States District Court for the District of Utah ===
Novell removed the lawsuit to the Federal court system on February 6, 2004. This removal was upheld in the court&#x27;s June 9 ruling.

On February 10, 2004, Novell filed a motion to dismiss the case. Novell requested dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Novell argued that:

* SCO did not show a valid transfer of copyright ownership, because the Asset Purchase Agreement was merely a &quot;promise&quot; to assign under specific circumstances (SCO&#x27;s demonstration that copyrights were &quot;required&quot; to exercise other rights under the contract), and that the Agreement is therefore—by law—not sufficient to transfer the copyrights to SCO; and
* SCO did not specify specific special damages required for such a claim.

In response, SCO filed several memoranda opposing Novell&#x27;s motion to dismiss the case. Additionally, SCO filed a motion to remand the case back to State court. Novell countered that, because the case would hinge upon interpretation of federal copyright law, it should be tried in federal court.

On May 9, 2004, federal Judge Dale A. Kimball heard both parties&#x27; arguments and took both motions under advisement. Judge Kimball denied SCO&#x27;s motion to remand and partially granted Novell&#x27;s motion to dismiss on June 9, 2004, on a pleading technicality. The case was dismissed without prejudice, which allowed SCO to amend their complaint to include properly pleaded special damages.

==== Novell&#x27;s countersuit ====
On July 29, 2005, Novell filed a countersuit against SCO claiming slander of title, breach of contract, failure to remit royalties, and failure to conduct audit obligations. Novell sought damages in excess of SCO&#x27;s net worth, and, as SCO was quickly burning through its assets and cash on hand, Novell asked the court to sequester this money from SCO so that it would not be spent before the resolution of the case. Novell also asked the court to attach SCO&#x27;s assets pending adjudication of their claims. Novell accused SCO of licensing Unix System V Release 4 to Microsoft and Sun Microsystems without then sending Novell the 95% of the license fees as required by the APA.

In the counter-claim, Novell stated that SCO had asked Novell to participate in the SCO&#x27;s Linux IP infringement licensing plan. When Novell refused, SCO asked Novell to turn the Unix copyrights over to SCO, a request Novell also refused.

==== SuSE arbitration ====
SCO filed a second amended complaint on February 6, 2006, containing the original slander of title claim as well as several new claims, including unfair competition, copyright infringement (for Novell&#x27;s distribution of SUSE Linux), and breaching a purported non-compete agreement (again, related to SUSE Linux).

On April 10, 2006, Novell&#x27;s SuSE division (a European vendor of Linux operating systems) filed a request for arbitration against SCO with the Secretariat of the International Chamber of Commerce&#x27;s International Court of Arbitration in Paris, France. Years earlier, while still known as Caldera International, SCO had signed contracts with then-independent SuSE, among others, involving the United Linux product. The United Linux members agreed that each member would have broad licenses to exploit and distribute Linux products that included United Linux technology. These agreements included clauses requiring the members to use an arbitration process to resolve disputes.

SuSE&#x27;s arbitration request was a response to SCO&#x27;s amended complaint against Novell. The arbitration process has relatively strict timelines, unlike the U.S. courts&#x27; procedures. Novell filed a &quot;Motion to Stay Claims Raising Issues Subject to Arbitration&quot; in the U.S. courts, saying that four of SCO&#x27;s five claims had been brought to arbitration, including the claim of copyright infringement, and thus should be stayed until the arbitration tribunal rendered its decision. Novell also filed an &quot;Answer to SCO&#x27;s 2nd Amended Complaint and Counterclaims&quot;, claiming a large number of affirmative defenses, including a claim that SCO committed fraud upon the U.S. copyright office.

==== Licensing agreements and Novell&#x27;s motion for summary judgement ====
On September 22, 2006, Novell sought leave to file amended counterclaims. Through discovery, Novell had obtained copies of SCO&#x27;s Unix licensing agreements with Microsoft and Sun. Upon reviewing the agreements, Novell claimed that they breached the APA. The added claims were conversion and breach of fiduciary duties. SCO stipulated to Novell&#x27;s motion, and therefore Judge Kimball granted it.

Novell filed a motion on September 29, 2006, asking for summary judgment, or if that was rejected, then for a preliminary injunction. Novell alleged that SCO, through their agreements with Sun and Microsoft, licensed Novell&#x27;s property without paying Novell the royalties it was due under the APA. Novell asked the court to force SCO to turn the royalties over to Novell or, in the alternative, be forced to put the money into a collective trust, where neither party would be able to access it until the issue was decided by the courts.

On August 10, 2007, Judge Kimball ruled that &quot;...Novell is the owner of the Unix and UnixWare Copyrights.&quot; Novell was awarded summary judgment on a number of its claims, and a number of SCO&#x27;s claims were denied. SCO was instructed to account for, and pass to Novell, an appropriate portion of its income from the Sun and Microsoft licenses.

Judge Kimball&#x27;s ruling stated that &quot;SCO is obligated to recognize Novell&#x27;s waiver of SCO&#x27;s claims against IBM and Sequent,&quot; referring to other cases SCO had filed against those companies for allegedly violating SCO&#x27;s intellectual property rights in Unix. After the ruling, Novell announced they had no interest in suing people over Unix, stating &quot;We don&#x27;t believe there is Unix in Linux.&quot;

=== SCO&#x27;s bankruptcy ===
The parties were expected to go to trial on September 17, 2007, in order to determine exactly how much money SCO owed Novell. However, on September 14, the SCO Group filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. As SCO was a Delaware corporation, the bankruptcy filing was made with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The filing caused all pending litigation to be automatically stayed as required by the United States Code.

On November 27, 2007, United States Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross lifted the automatic stay so as to allow the Utah court to determine how much money SCO owed Novell, but the bankruptcy court retained jurisdiction over any constructive trust that the Federal court might create.

=== Trial to determine damages ===
For the purposes of the trial to determine how much money SCO owed Novell, SCO was named the defendant and Novell was named the plaintiff, because SCO had not prevailed on any of its initial claims. The trial commenced April 30, 2008. Novell sought the recovery of $19,979,561 from SCO based on its licenses to Microsoft, Sun, and others.

On July 16, 2008, the Utah court awarded 

The decision, which SCO could appeal, granted Novell the asked-for $2,547,817 award due to the 2003 Sun Agreement&#x27;s modification of the 1994 confidentiality provisions. These modifications permitted the release of OpenSolaris.

On November 20, 2008, Kimball&#x27;s final judgment in the case affirmed his August 10, 2007 ruling, granting Novell the award plus interest of $918,122, plus $489 additional interest for every day after August 29, 2008, should SCO fail to pay the award by that date. The ruling also ordered a constructive trust of $625,486.90. Judge Kimball dismissed the case with no possibility to re-file the suit with an amended complaint, restricting SCO to pursue the case only in appeals.

=== Circuit Court appeal ===
On August 24, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit partially reversed Kimball&#x27;s August 10, 2007, summary judgement, insofar as Kimball had found that Novell owned the copyright to Unix. The portion dealing with the 2003 Sun agreement was upheld by the appeals court. As a result, SCO could pursue its ownership of the Unix copyrights at trial. However, it remained liable for the $2,547,817 royalty award.

Novell filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on March 4, 2010, seeking intervention by the Supreme Court of the United States. Novell argued that there is a circuit split on the correct interpretation of the Copyright Act&#x27;s transfer requirements, and that the correct requirements are more strict than the Tenth Circuit&#x27;s holding in this case. The petition was dismissed by the Supreme Court.

=== Trial on remand for copyright issues ===
The jury trial on the remanded copyright issues began on March 8, 2010, before Judge Ted Stewart. It was expected to last three weeks. On March 30, the jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of Novell. On June 10, Judge Stewart ruled in favor of Novell on all issues, closing the case. The court found that Novell had not committed slander of title, was not now required to transfer the copyrights under the APA, that its copyright waivers issued to IBM were authorized, and that they did not violate the covenant of good faith.

SCO appealed the district court judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on July 7, 2010.

On August 30, 2011, the Appeals Court affirmed the trial decision.

<doc id="872925" wikidata="Q7389250" url="?curid=872925" title="SCO Group, Inc. v. DaimlerChrysler Corp.">
<text>SCO Group v. DaimlerChrysler was a lawsuit filed in the United States, in the state of Michigan. In December 2003, SCO sent a number of letters to Unix licensees. In these letters, SCO demanded that the licensees certify certain things regarding their usage of Linux. DaimlerChrysler, a former Unix user and current Linux user, did not respond to this letter. On March 3, 2004, SCO filed suit against DaimlerChrysler for violating their Unix license agreement, by failing to respond to the certification request made by SCO. The parties agreed to a stipulated dismissal order on December 21, 2004. The case was dismissed without prejudice, but if SCO wished to pursue the timeliness claim again, would have had to pay DaimlerChrysler&#x27;s legal fees since August 9. On December 29, 2004, SCO filed a claim of appeal notice. On January 31, 2005, the claim of appeal was dismissed.

==History==
For use on their Cray supercomputer, Chrysler Corporation bought a Unix source license from AT&amp;T on September 2, 1988. A source license allows the licensee to view, modify and use the Unix source code on a number of specific machines (designated CPUs).

Through a number of acquisitions, The SCO Group became the licensing agent that handled Unix source licenses. Chrysler Motors Corporations merged with Daimler-Benz in 1998 forming DaimlerChrysler.

==Background information==
The licenses sold by AT&amp;T allow the licensor to ask for certification regarding the use of the licensed product.

:&quot;On [SCO&#x27;s] request, but not more frequently than annually, LICENSEE shall furnish to [SCO] a statement, certified by an authorized representative of LICENSEE, listing the location, type and serial number of all DESIGNATED CPUs hereunder and stating that the use by LICENSEE of SOFTWARE PRODUCTS subject to this Agreement has been reviewed and that each such SOFTWARE PRODUCT is being used solely on DESIGNATED CPUs (or temporarily on back-up CPUs) for such SOFTWARE PRODUCTS in full compliance with the provisions of this Agreement.&quot;

The SCO Group invoked their right to ask for certification on December 18, 2003. In addition to the certification specified in the license, SCO also instructed the Unix licensees to certify their use of Linux, a competing operating system.

DaimlerChrysler did not respond to this letter. In fact, it is possible that DaimlerChrysler never received it; it was addressed to Chrysler Motors Corporation at 12800 Oakland Avenue in Highland Park, Michigan, but Chrysler Corporation (as it was then known) had announced the move of its Highland Park headquarters in 1992, and famously moved
 into a massive, headquarters complex (1000 Chrysler Drive) in nearby Auburn Hills between 1993-1996. The company closed down its Highland Park facilities in 1997.

The name of the company, too had changed: &quot;Chrysler Motors Corporation&quot; had become part of DaimlerChrysler when it merged with Daimler-Benz AG in 1998. The former Chrysler operations were now referred to informally as &quot;the Chrysler Group&quot;, but were legally known as DaimlerChrysler Motors Company LLC.

==The lawsuit==
On March 3, 2004, The SCO Group filed a breach of contract lawsuit against DaimlerChrysler in the Circuit Court for Oakland County. In its complaint, SCO claimed that DaimlerChrysler refused to comply with the terms of the license. SCO also speculated that DaimlerChrysler broke the licensing agreement when they moved to the Linux operating system and that this is the reason why they refused to certify.

DaimlerChrysler responded with a motion for summary judgment on April 15, 2004. DaimlerChrysler claimed that the letter sent by SCO asked for certifications that were not agreed upon in the original licensing agreement, such as certifications about the use of Linux. Additionally DaimlerChrysler claimed that the original licensing agreement does not mention a specific time in which a licensee should respond to a certification request. DaimlerChrysler also told the court that it had not been contacted by SCO after receiving the letter, instead SCO filed suit without further attempts to receive any certifications.

At the same time, DaimlerChrysler also responded by certifying their use of Unix, according to the provisions specified in the original licensing agreement. In this certification DaimlerChrysler revealed that they have not used Unix for over 7 years.

On August 9, 2004, Judge Chabot granted the summary disposition almost completely. The only remaining issue on the case was whether DaimlerChrysler&#x27;s response was submitted in a timely manner. On November 17, 2004, SCO moved to stay its suit pending SCO v. IBM case, but was denied.

The parties agreed to a stipulated dismissal order on December 21, 2004. The case was dismissed without prejudice, but if SCO wishes to pursue the timeliness claim again, it must pay DaimlerChrysler&#x27;s legal fees since August 9. On December 29, 2004, SCO filed a claim of appeal notice. On January 31, 2005, the claim of appeal was dismissed.

<text>The Battle of Berne (, , , , , ) was a football match at the 1954 World Cup between Hungary and Brazil, a quarter-final played on 27 June 1954 at the Wankdorf Stadium in Bern, Switzerland.
Violent conduct and fighting prompted English referee Arthur Ellis to send off three players during the match. Fighting between the teams continued in the dressing rooms after the final whistle.

==Background==
Brazil had scored six goals in two group games, and Hungary had scored 17. Brazil had a reputation for attractive and attacking football; in their games in group 1, they beat Mexico 5–0, and drew the other 1–1 with Yugoslavia after extra time.

Hungary had revolutionized football tactics and coaching in Europe. Their fluid and open style of play – an early form of total football – meant that they were unbeaten for 2 years, since defeat to Soviet Union in 27 May 1952. Hungary were clear winners of group 2, winning both of their group games – they beat South Korea 9–0, and West Germany 8–3.

For each of the first two quarter-finals, one team progressing from group 1 was drawn at random against one team progressing from group 2. Brazil were drawn to play against Hungary, while West Germany drew Yugoslavia.

==The match==
The match was played in driving rain, producing slippery conditions and a hard to control ball. Hungary took the lead in the third minute, with Nándor Hidegkuti scoring. Four minutes later, Sándor Kocsis made it 2–0 to Hungary. Brazil was awarded a penalty; Djalma Santos scored to make it 2–1 at half time.

In the second half, Hungary was awarded a penalty; Mihály Lantos scored to make the score 3–1. The penalty award was the cue for a pitch invasion by Brazilian journalists and officials, who had to be ushered off by police. The game then degenerated into a series of increasingly violent fouls and cynical tactics, with Brazilian forward Julinho scoring to bring the score to 3–2. After this, József Bozsik was fouled by Nilton Santos; the two men started fighting, and both were sent off. Hungary scored a fourth goal via Sándor Kocsis to make the score 4–2 to Hungary. The last moments of the game was little more than a running battle between the two teams; Brazilian forward Humberto Tozzi kicked Hungary&#x27;s Gyula Lóránt prior to the final whistle and was sent off.

In total, 42 free kicks and 2 penalties were awarded, with 4 cautions and 3 dismissals issued.

The ill-temper continued after the game, with the Brazilian players invading the Hungarian dressing room and continuing the on-pitch fighting. They were driven off by the notorious Hungarian AVH security police with batons and guns drawn. Despite evidence from independent witnesses of violent conduct from both sides, football&#x27;s governing body FIFA did nothing, leaving discipline to the respective countries.

==Post-match commentary==
The game&#x27;s referee Arthur Ellis commented: &quot;I thought it was going to be the greatest game I&#x27;d ever see. I was on top of the world. Whether politics and religion had something to do with it I don&#x27;t know, but they behaved like animals. It was a disgrace. It was a horrible match. Certainly British players and fans would never act in such a most reprehensible manner. In today&#x27;s climate so many players would have been sent off the game would have been abandoned. My only thought was that I was determined to finish it.&quot; Ellis later wrote, &quot;Those people must learn sportsmanship and we must teach them. South Americans are more excitable and more passionate than we are. Even more so than the Italians. Unlike the British, they do crazy things, impulsively, then a few minutes later they are genuinely and deeply sorry&quot;.

&quot;The Times&quot; newspaper correspondent on 28 June 1954 drew a similar conclusion; &quot;Never in my life have I seen such cruel tackling, the cutting down of opponents as if with a scythe, followed by threatening attitudes and sly jabs when officialdom was engaged elsewhere.&quot; Ellis’s officiating and gentlemanly conduct was commended by the Daily Mail.

&quot;This was a battle; a brutal, savage match,&quot; recalled Hungary manager Gusztáv Sebes, who needed four stitches for a facial wound received during the fighting. &quot;At the end we had won 4–2 but it wasn&#x27;t over yet. Brazilian photographers and fans flooded on to the pitch and police were called to clear it. Players clashed in the tunnel and a small war broke out in the corridor to the dressing rooms - everyone was having a go; fans, players and officials.&quot;

The draw for the semi-finals, held on Sunday 27 June, was delayed by a complaint from the Hungarian team concerning the manner in which the quarter-final against Brazil had been played.

<doc id="872930" wikidata="Q65178198" url="?curid=872930" title="Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction">
<text>Pakistan is one of nine states that possess nuclear weapons. Pakistan began developing nuclear weapons in January 1972 under Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who delegated the program to the Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) Munir Ahmad Khan with a commitment to having the device ready by the end of 1976. Since PAEC, which consisted of over twenty laboratories and projects under reactor physicist Munir Ahmad Khan, was falling behind schedule and having considerable difficulty producing fissile material, Abdul Qadeer Khan, a metallurgist working on centrifuge enrichment for Urenco, joined the program at the behest of the Bhutto administration by the end of 1974. Producing fissile material was pivotal to the Kahuta Project&#x27;s success and thus to Pakistan obtaining the capability to detonate a nuclear weapon by the end of 1984.

The Kahuta Project started under the supervision of a coordination board that oversaw the activities of KRL and PAEC. The Board consisted of A G N Kazi (secretary general, finance), Ghulam Ishaq Khan (secretary general, defence), and Agha Shahi (secretary general, foreign affairs), and reported directly to Bhutto. Ghulam Ishaq Khan and General Tikka Khan appointed Major General Ali Nawab as the ranking engineer on the program. Moderate uranium enrichment for the production of fissile material was achieved at KRL by April 1978. Eventually, the supervision passed to Lt General Zahid Ali Akbar Khan in President General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq&#x27;s administration.

Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear weapons development was in response to the loss of East Pakistan in 1971&#x27;s Bangladesh Liberation War. Bhutto called a meeting of senior scientists and engineers on 20 January 1972. Bhutto was the main architect of this programme, and it was here that Bhutto orchestrated the nuclear weapons programme and rallied Pakistan&#x27;s academic scientists to build an atomic bomb in three years for national survival.

At the meeting, Bhutto also appointed Munir Ahmad Khan as chairman of PAEC, who, until then, had been working as director at the nuclear power and Reactor Division of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in Vienna, Austria. In December 1972, Abdus Salam led the establishment of Theoretical Physics Group (TPG) as he called scientists working at ICTP to report to Munir Ahmad Khan. This marked the beginning of Pakistan&#x27;s pursuit of nuclear deterrence capability. Following India&#x27;s surprise nuclear test, codenamed Smiling Buddha in 1974, the first confirmed nuclear test by a nation outside the permanent five members of the United Nations Security Council, the goal to develop nuclear weapons received considerable impetus.

Finally, on 28 May 1998, a few weeks after India&#x27;s second nuclear test (Operation Shakti), Pakistan detonated five nuclear devices in the Ras Koh Hills in the Chagai district, Balochistan. This operation was named &quot;Chagai-I&quot; by Pakistan, the underground iron-steel tunnel having been long-constructed by provincial martial law administrator General Rahimuddin Khan during the 1980s. The Pakistani Atomic Energy Commission reported that the five nuclear tests conducted on May 28 generated a seismic signal of 5.0 on the Richter scale, with a total yield of up to 40 KT (equivalent TNT). Dr. A.Q. Khan claimed that one device was a boosted fission device and that the other four were sub-kiloton nuclear devices. The last test of Pakistan was conducted at the sandy Kharan Desert under the codename Chagai-II, also in Balochistan, on 30 May 1998. Pakistan&#x27;s fissile material production takes place at Nilore, Kahuta, and Khushab Nuclear Complex, where weapons-grade plutonium is refined. Pakistan thus became the seventh country in the world to successfully develop and test nuclear weapons, although according to a letter sent by A.Q. Khan to General Zia, the capability to detonate a nuclear bomb using highly enriched uranium as fissile material produced at KRL had already been achieved by KRL in 1984.

== History ==

After the Partition of India in 1947, India and Pakistan have been in conflict over several issues, including the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir. The uneasy relationships with India, Afghanistan, and the former Soviet Union explain its motivation to become a nuclear power as part of its defence and energy strategies.

===Initial non-weapon policy===

On 8 December 1953, Pakistan media welcomed the US Atoms for Peace initiatives, followed by the establishment of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) in 1956. In 1953, Foreign minister Muhammad Zafarullah Khan publicly stated that &quot;Pakistan does not have a policy towards the atom bombs&quot;. Following the announcement, on 11 August 1955, the United States and Pakistan reached an understanding concerning the peaceful and industrial use of nuclear energy which also included a pool-type reactor worth $350,000. Before 1971, Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear development was peaceful but an effective deterrent against India, as Benazir Bhutto maintained in 1995. Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear energy programme was established and started in 1956 following the establishment of PAEC. Pakistan became a participant in US President Eisenhower&#x27;s Atoms for Peace program. PAEC&#x27;s first chairman was Dr. Nazir Ahmad. Although proposals to develop nuclear weapons were made in the 1960s by several officials and senior scientists, Pakistan followed a strict non-nuclear weapon policy from 1956 until 1971, as PAEC under its chairman Ishrat Hussain Usmani made no efforts to acquire nuclear fuel cycle technology for the purposes of an active nuclear weapons programme.

In 1961, the PAEC set up a Mineral Center at Lahore and a similar multidisciplinary Center was set up in Dhaka, in the then East Pakistan. With these two centres, the basic research work started.

The first thing that was to be undertaken was the search for uranium. This continued for about three years from 1960 to 1963. Uranium deposits were discovered and the first-ever national award was given to the PAEC. Mining of uranium began in the same year. Dr. Abdus Salam and Dr. Ishrat Hussain Usmani also sent a large number of scientists to pursue doctorate degrees in the field of nuclear technology and nuclear reactor technology. In December 1965, then-foreign minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto visited Vienna where he met IAEA nuclear engineer, Munir Ahmad Khan. At a Vienna meeting on December, Khan informed Bhutto about the status of India&#x27;s nuclear program.

The next landmark under Dr. Abdus Salam was the establishment of PINSTECH – Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology, at Nilore near Islamabad. The principal facility there was a 5MW research reactor, commissioned in 1965 and consisting of the PARR-I, which was upgraded to 10 MWe by Nuclear Engineering Division under Munir Ahmad Khan in 1990. A second Atomic Research Reactor, known as PARR-II, was a Pool-type, light-water, 27–30 kWe, training reactor that went critical in 1989 under Munir Ahmad Khan. The PARR-II reactor was built and provided by PAEC under the IAEA safeguards as IAEA had funded this mega project. The PARR-I reactor was, under the agreement signed by PAEC and ANL, provided by the US Government in 1965, and scientists from PAEC and ANL had led the construction. Canada built Pakistan&#x27;s first civil-purpose nuclear power plant. The Ayub Khan Military Government made then-science advisor to the Government, Abdus Salam, head of the IAEA delegation. Abdus Salam began lobbying for commercial nuclear power plants, and tirelessly advocated for nuclear power in Pakistan. In 1965, Salam&#x27;s efforts finally paid off, and a Canadian firm signed a deal to provide the 137MWe CANDU reactor in Paradise Point, Karachi. The construction began in 1966 as PAEC its general contractor as GE Canada provided nuclear materials and financial assistance. Its project director was Parvez Butt, a nuclear engineer, and its construction completed in 1972. Known as &quot;KANUPP-I&quot;, it was inaugurated by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto as president, and began its operations in November 1972. Currently, Pakistan Government is planning to build another 400MWe commercial nuclear power plant, known as &quot;KANUPP-II&quot;; the PAEC completed its feasibility studies in 2009. However, the work has been on hold since 2009.

In the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, which was the second of four openly declared Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts, Pakistan solicited Central Treaty Organization (CENTO) assistance, but came under arms supply embargo in United Nations Security Council Resolution 211. Foreign minister (later Prime minister) Zulfikar Ali Bhutto aggressively began the advocating the option of &quot;nuclear weapons programmes&quot; but such attempts were dismissed by Finance minister Muhammad Shoaib and chairman Ishrat Hussain Usmani. Pakistani scientists and engineers&#x27; working at IAEA became aware of advancing Indian nuclear program towards making the bombs. Therefore, In October 1965, Munir Khan, director at the Nuclear Power and Reactor Division of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), met with Bhutto on an emergency basis in Vienna, revealing the facts about the Indian nuclear programme and Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Trombay. At this meeting Munir Khan concluded: &quot;a (nuclear) India would further undermine and threaten Pakistan&#x27;s security, and for her survival, Pakistan needed a nuclear deterrent...&quot;.

Understanding the sensitivity of the issue, Bhutto arranged a meeting with President Ayub Khan 11 December 1965 at Dorchester Hotel in London. Munir Khan pointed out to the President that Pakistan must acquire the necessary facilities that would give the country a nuclear weapon capability, which was available free of safeguards and at an affordable cost, and there were no restrictions on nuclear technology, that it was freely available, and that India was moving forward in deploying it, as Munir Khan maintained. When asked about the economics of such a programme, Munir Ahmad Khan estimated the cost of nuclear technology at that time. Because things were less expensive, the then costs were not more than US$150 million. After hearing the proposal President Ayub Khan swiftly denied the proposal, saying that Pakistan was too poor to spend that much money and that, if Pakistan ever needed the atomic bomb, it could somehow acquire it off the shelf.

Pakistan&#x27;s weaker conventional weapon military in comparison to India and the Indian nuclear programme that started in 1967 prompted Pakistan&#x27;s clandestine development of nuclear weapons. Although Pakistan began the development of nuclear weapons in 1972, Pakistan responded to India&#x27;s 1974 nuclear test (see &quot;Smiling Buddha&quot;) with a number of proposals for a nuclear-weapon-free zone to prevent a nuclear arms race in South Asia. On many different occasions, India rejected the offer.

In 1969, after a long negotiation, the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) signed a formal agreement to supply Pakistan with a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant capable of extracting of weapons-grade plutonium annually. PAEC selected a team five senior scientists, including geophysicist Dr. Ahsan Mubarak, who were sent to Sellafield to receive technical training. Later Mubarak&#x27;s team advised the government not to acquire the whole reprocessing plant, only key parts important to building the weapons, while the plant would be built indigenously.

The PAEC in 1970 began work on a pilot-scale plant at Dera Ghazi Khan for the concentration of uranium ores. The plant had a capacity of 10,000 pounds a day.
In 1989, Munir Ahmad Khan signed a nuclear cooperation deal and, since 2000, Pakistan has been developing a two-unit nuclear power plant with an agreement signed with China. Both these reactors are of 300 MW capacity and are being built at Chashma city of Punjab province. The first of these, &quot;CHASNUPP-I&quot;, began producing electricity in 2000, and &#x27;CHASNUPP-II&#x27;, began its operation in fall of 2011. In 2011, the board of governors of International Atomic Energy Agency gave approval of Sino-Pak Nuclear Deal, allowing Pakistan legally to build the 300-MW &#x27;CHASNUPP-III&#x27; and &#x27;CHASNUPP-VI&#x27; reactors.

=== Development of nuclear weapons ===

The Bangladesh Liberation War was a defeat for Pakistan, which led to it losing roughly of territory as well as losing more than half its population to the newly independent state of Bangladesh. In addition to the psychological setback for Pakistan, it had failed to gather any significant material support or assistance from its key allies, the United States and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Pakistan seemed to be isolated internationally, and in great danger; it felt that it could rely on no one but itself. Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was &quot;obsessed&quot; with India&#x27;s nuclear program. At a United Nations Security Council meeting, Bhutto drew comparisons between the Instrument of Surrender that ended the 1971 war, and the Treaty of Versailles, which Germany was forced to sign in 1919. There, Bhutto vowed never to allow a repeat.

At the Multan meeting on 20 January 1972, Bhutto stated, &quot;What Raziuddin Siddiqui, a Pakistani, contributed for the United States during the Manhattan Project, could also be done by scientists in Pakistan, for their own people.&quot; Siddiqui was a Pakistani theoretical physicist who, in the early 1940s, worked on both the British nuclear program and the Manhattan Project.

In December 1972, Dr. Abdus Salam directed a secretly coded memo to Pakistani scientists working at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Italy to report to the Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), Munir Ahmad Khan, informing them about the program what was to be equivalent of the US &quot;Manhattan Project.&quot; In an effort to instill a sense of pride, Salam noted that the heads of the Manhattan Engineer District were theoreticians, and informed the scientists at ICTP that a similar division was being established at PAEC; this marked the beginning of the &quot;Theoretical Physics Group&quot; (TPG). Other theoreticians at Quaid-e-Azam University would also join the TPG, then led by Salam who had done ground-breaking work for TPG. Among them was Riazuddin, Fayyazuddin, Masud Ahmad, and Faheem Hussain who were the cornerstone of the TPG.

Tedious mathematical work on fast neutron calculations, relativity, complex hydrodynamics and quantum mechanics were conducted by the TPG led by Salam until 1974 when he left Pakistan in protest, though he kept close contact with TPG. No such endeavours of the kind had taken place in the country and computerized numerical control (CNC) and basic computing facilities were non-existent at that time (though later acquired). For this purpose, the calculations on the high-performance computing and numerical analysis were performed by Dr. Tufail Naseem, a PhD graduate in mathematics from Cambridge University, assisted by other members of Mathematics Division– the division of pure mathematics at PAEC under Dr. Raziuddin Siddiqui and Asghar Qadir. About the lack of CNC facilities, Munir Ahmad Khan famously marked: &quot;If the Americans could do it without CNC machines in the 1940s, why can&#x27;t we do the same now.&quot;. With Abdus Salam departing, Munir Ahmad eventually led the TPG and assisted in the calculations. Two types of weapon design were analyzed: the Gun-type fission weapon and the implosion nuclear weapon. The program turned to the more technically difficult implosion-type weapon design, contrary to the relatively simple &#x27;gun-type&#x27; weapon.

In 1974, Abdul Qadeer Khan a metallurgist, joined the program and pushed for the feasibility of highly enriched uranium (HEU) fissile material and collaborated under Bashiruddin Mahmood at the PAEC– a moved that irked Khan. Preliminary studies on gaseous centrifuge were already studied by PAEC in 1967 but yielded few results. Khan advanced uranium enrichment from the expertise he had from the Urenco Group in the Netherlands. Under Khan&#x27;s supervision, the Kahuta Research Laboratories (KRL) was set-up and engaged in clandestine efforts to obtain the necessary materials technology and electronic components for its developing uranium enrichment capabilities.

The TPG succeeded in the earlier implosion-type weapon design in 1977–78, with the first cold test conducted in 1983 by Ishfaq Ahmad. The program evolved towards the boosted fission weapon designs that were eventually used in the Chagai-I tests in 1998. Enormous production was undertaken by the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission for feasibility of weapons grade plutonium but parallel efforts were mounted toward weapons-grade uranium after India&#x27;s test, the Smiling Buddha, in 1974.

In 1983, Khan was convicted in absentia by the Court of Amsterdam for stealing centrifuge blueprints, though the conviction was overturned on a legal technicality. A nuclear proliferation ring was established by Khan through Dubai to smuggle URENCO nuclear technology to KRL after founding the Zippe method for the gas centrifuge

On 11 March 1983, PAEC, led by Munir Ahmad Khan, carried out its first subcritical testing of a working nuclear device. This is also called a cold test, and was codenamed &quot;Kirana-I&quot;. There were 24 more cold tests from 1983 to 1994.

Coordination between each site was overseen by the Directorate of Technical Development (DTD) under Dr. Zaman Sheikh (a chemical engineer) and Hafeez Qureshi, a mechanical engineer. The DTD was established by Munir Ahmad Khan in 1974 and was tasked with development of tampers, reflective and explosive lenses, optics, and triggering mechanisms that are crucial in atomic weapons. First implosion design was built by TPG in 1977 and the DTD eventually conducted the cold-test on 11 March 1983, codename &quot;Kirana-I&quot;. Between 1983 and 1990, PAEC carried out 24 more cold tests of various nuclear weapon designs and shifted its focused towards tactical designs in 1987 that could be delivered by all Pakistan Air Force fighter aircraft.

Dr. Ishrat Hussain Usmani&#x27;s contribution to the nuclear energy programme is also fundamental to the development of atomic energy for civilian purposes as he, with efforts led by Salam, established PINSTECH, that subsequently developed into Pakistan&#x27;s premier nuclear research institution. In addition to sending hundreds of young Pakistanis abroad for training, he laid the foundations of the Muslim world&#x27;s first nuclear power reactor KANUPP, which was inaugurated by Munir Ahmad Khan in 1972. Scientists and engineers under Khan developed the nuclear capability for Pakistan within the late 1970s, and under his leadership PAEC had carried out a cold test of nuclear devices at Kirana Hills, evidently made from non-weaponized plutonium. The former chairman of PAEC, Munir Khan, was credited as one of the pioneers of Pakistan&#x27;s atomic bomb by a study from the London International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), on Pakistan&#x27;s atomic bomb program.

In his semi-official works of the Pakistani nuclear program history, &quot;Eating Grass: The Making of the Pakistani Bomb&quot;, Major General Feroz Hassan Khan wrote that Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz al Saud visits to Pakistan&#x27;s atomic facility were not a proof of the agreement between the two countries. However, Feroz Hassan acknowledged in his own words, that &quot;Saudi Arabia provided generous financial support to Pakistan that enabled the nuclear program to continue.&quot;.

=== Alleged Israeli interference ===

In 1981, three West German engineering firms were targeted in bomb attacks and several others received threatening phone calls, allegedly carried out by the Israeli secret service. All of the companies were suspected of selling dual use technology to Pakistan for use in their nuclear weapons program. Former Pakistan Army brigadier Feroz Hassan Khan alleged that in 1982 India worked with Israel to plan an attack similar to the previous year&#x27;s surprise airstrike on Iraq&#x27;s nuclear reactor, where Israeli F-16 fighters bombers escorted by F-15 air superiority aircraft would take off from Udhampur Air Force Station in Indian administered Kashmir and then fly low over the Himalayas to avoid early radar detection before attacking the Pakistani uranium enrichment centrifuge complex in the Rawalpindi city of Kahuta. Israel F-16 aircraft were also allegedly twice spotted in Pakistani air space in the days before the 1998 nuclear tests were carried out. Pakistan was so alarmed by the sighting that their then ambassador to the UN, Ahmed Kamal, held an emergency meeting with the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan to seek reassurance from the international community that an attack was not imminent.

=== Policy ===

Pakistan acceded to the Geneva Protocol on 15 April 1960. As for its Biological warfare capability, Pakistan is not widely suspected of either producing biological weapons or having an offensive biological programme. However, the country is reported to have well-developed bio-technological facilities and laboratories, devoted entirely to the medical research and applied healthcare science. In 1972, Pakistan signed and ratified the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) in 1974. Since then Pakistan has been a vocal and staunch supporter for the success of the BTWC. During the various BTWC Review Conferences, Pakistan&#x27;s representatives have urged more robust participation from state signatories, invited new states to join the treaty, and, as part of the non-aligned group of countries, have made the case for guarantees for states&#x27; rights to engage in peaceful exchanges of biological and toxin materials for purposes of scientific research.

Pakistan is not known to have an offensive chemical weapons programme, and in 1993 Pakistan signed and ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), and has committed itself to refrain from developing, manufacturing, stockpiling, or using chemical weapons.

Pakistan is not a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and is not bound by any of its provisions. In 1999, Prime Ministers Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan and Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India signed the &quot;Lahore Declaration,&quot; agreeing to a bilateral moratorium on further nuclear testing. This initiative was taken a year after both countries had publicly tested nuclear weapons. (See Pokhran-II, Chagai-I and II)

Since the early 1980s, Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear proliferation activities have not been without controversy. However, since the arrest of Abdul Qadeer Khan, the government has taken concrete steps to ensure that Nuclear proliferation is not repeated and have assured the IAEA about the transparency of Pakistan&#x27;s upcoming Chashma Nuclear Power Plant. In November 2006, The International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors approved an agreement with the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission to apply safeguards to new nuclear power plants to be built in the country with Chinese assistance.

=== Protections ===
In May 1999, during the anniversary of Pakistan&#x27;s first nuclear weapons test, former Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif claimed that Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear security is the strongest in the world. According to Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear safety program and nuclear security program is the strongest program in the world and there is no such capability in any other country for radical elements to steal or possess nuclear weapons. This claim is strongly disputed by foreign experts, citing the precedent of previous attacks of Pakistani military facilities and the nation&#x27;s high level of instability.

=== Modernisation and expansion ===
A Washington-based &quot;Nuclear Watch&quot; think tank of Boston University has reported that Pakistan is increasing its capacity to produce plutonium at its Khushab nuclear facility. The sixth nuclear test (codename: Chagai-II) on 30 May 1998, at Kharan was quite a successful test of a sophisticated, compact, but &quot;powerful plutonium bomb&quot; designed to be carried by aircraft, vessels, and missiles. These are believed to be tritium-boosted weapons. Only a few grams of tritium can result in an increase of the explosive yield by 300% to 400%.&quot; Citing new satellite images of the facility, the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) said the imagery suggests construction of the second Khushab reactor is &quot;likely finished and that the roof beams are being placed on top of the third Khushab reactor hall&quot;. A third and a fourth reactor and ancillary buildings are observed to be under construction at the Khushab site.

In an opinion published in &quot;The Hindu&quot;, former Indian Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran wrote that Pakistan&#x27;s expanding nuclear capability is &quot;no longer driven solely by its oft-cited fears of India&quot; but by the &quot;paranoia about US attacks on its strategic assets.&quot; Noting recent changes in Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear doctrine, Saran said &quot;the Pakistan Military and civilian elite is convinced that the United States has also become a dangerous adversary, which seeks to disable, disarm or take forcible possession of Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear arsenals and its status as nuclear power.&quot;

, Pakistan has been reportedly developing smaller, tactical nuclear weapons for use on the battlefield. This is consistent with earlier statements from a meeting of the National Command Authority (which directs nuclear policy and development) saying Pakistan is developing &quot;a full-spectrum deterrence capability to deter all forms of aggression.&quot;

=== Arms control proposals ===
Pakistan has over the years proposed a number of bilateral or regional non-proliferation steps and confidence building measures to India, including:

* A joint Indo-Pakistan declaration renouncing the acquisition or manufacture of nuclear weapons, in 1978.
* South Asian Nuclear Weapons Free Zone, in 1978.
* Mutual inspections by India and Pakistan of each other&#x27;s nuclear facilities, in 1979.
* Simultaneous adherence to the NPT by India and Pakistan, in 1979.
* A bilateral or regional nuclear test-ban treaty, in 1987.
* A South Asia Zero-Missile Zone, in 1994.

India rejected all six proposals.

However, India and Pakistan reached three bilateral agreements on nuclear issues. In 1989, they agreed not to attack each other&#x27;s nuclear facilities. Since then they have been regularly exchanging lists of nuclear facilities on 1 January of each year. Another bilateral agreement was signed in March 2005 where both nations would alert the other on ballistic missile tests. In June 2004, the two countries signed an agreement to set up and maintain a hotline to warn each other of any accident that could be mistaken for a nuclear attack. These were deemed essential risk reduction measures in view of the seemingly unending state of misgiving and tension between the two countries, and the extremely short response time available to them to any perceived attack. None of these agreements limits the nuclear weapons programs of either country in any way.

=== Disarmament policy ===
Pakistan has blocked negotiation of a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty as it continues to produce fissile material for weapons.

In a recent statement at the Conference on Disarmament, Pakistan laid out its nuclear disarmament policy and what it sees as the proper goals and requirements for meaningful negotiations:

* A commitment by all states to complete verifiable nuclear disarmament;
* Eliminate the discrimination in the current non-proliferation regime;
* Normalize the relationship of the three ex-NPT nuclear weapon states with those who are NPT signatories;
* Address new issues like access to weapons of mass destruction by non-state actors;
* Non-discriminatory rules ensuring every state&#x27;s right to peaceful uses of nuclear energy;
* Universal, non-discriminatory and legally binding negative security assurances to non-nuclear weapon states;
* A need to address the issue of missiles, including development and deployment of Anti-ballistic missile systems;
* Strengthen existing international instruments to prevent the militarisation of outer space, including development of ASATs;
* Tackle the growth in armed forces and the accumulation and sophistication of conventional tactical weapons.
* Revitalise the UN disarmament machinery to address international security, disarmament and proliferation challenges.

Pakistan has repeatedly stressed at international fora like the Conference on Disarmament that it will give up its nuclear weapons only when other nuclear armed states do so, and when disarmament is universal and verifiable. It rejects any unilateral disarmament on its part.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Uranium ===
Pakistan&#x27;s uranium infrastructure is based on the use of gas centrifuges to produce highly enriched uranium (HEU) at the Khan Research Laboratories (KRL) at Kahuta. Responding to India&#x27;s nuclear test in 1974, Munir Khan launched the uranium program, codename &quot;Project-706&quot; under the aegis of the PAEC. Physical chemist, Dr. Khalil Qureshi, did most of the calculations as a member of the uranium division at PAEC, which undertook research on several methods of enrichment, including gaseous diffusion, jet nozzle and molecular laser isotope separation techniques, as well as centrifuges. Abdul Qadeer Khan officially joined this program in 1976, bringing with him centrifuge designs he mastered at URENCO, the Dutch firm where he had worked as a senior scientist. Later that year, the government separated the program from PAEC and moved the program to the Engineering Research Laboratories (ERL), with A.Q. Khan as its senior scientist. To acquire the necessary equipment and material for this program, Khan developed a procurement ring. Electronic materials were imported from the United Kingdom by two liaison officers posted to the High Commission of Pakistan in London and Bonn Germany. The army engineer and ex-technical liaison officer, Major-General Syed Ali Nawab discreetly oversaw KRL operations in the 1970s including procuring the electronics that were marked as &quot;common items.&quot; This ring was also illicitly used decades later, in the late 1980s and 90s to provide technology to Libya (under Muammar Gaddafi), North Korea, and Iran. Despite these efforts, it is claimed Khan Research Laboratories suffered setbacks until PAEC provided technical assistance. Although, A.Q. Khan disputes it and counter claims that PAEC is merely trying to take credit for KRL&#x27;s success and that PAEC hindered progress at KRL after the two programs had been separated by Bhutto in 1976. In any case, KRL achieved modest enrichment of Uranium by 1978 and was ready to detonate an HEU uranium bomb by 1984. In contrast PAEC was unable to enrich any Uranium or produce weapons grade fissile material until 1998.
The uranium program proved to be a difficult, challenging and most enduring approach to scale up to industrial levels to military-grade. Producing HEU as a fissile material is even more difficult and challenging than extracting plutonium and Pakistan experimented with HEU as an implosion design as contrary to other nuclear states. Little and rudimentary knowledge was available of gas centrifuges at that time, and HEU fissile material was only known to the world for nuclear power usage; its military applications for HEU were non-existent. Commenting on the difficulty, mathematician Tasneem Shah; who worked with A.Q. Khan, was quoted in the book &quot;Eating Grass&quot; that &quot;hydrodynamical problem in centrifuge was simply stated, but extremely difficult to evaluate, not only in order of magnitude but in detailing also.&quot; Many of Khan&#x27;s fellow theorists were unsure about the feasibility of the enriched uranium on time despite Khan&#x27;s strong advocacy. One scientist recalled his memories in &quot;Eating Grass&quot;: &quot;No one in the world has used the [gas] centrifuge method to produce weapon grade material... [T]his was not going to work, he [A.Q. Khan] is simply wasting time.&quot; Despite A.Q. Khan having difficulty getting his peers to listen to him, he aggressively continued his research and the program was made feasible in the shortest time possible. His efforts won him praise from Pakistan&#x27;s politicians and military science circles, and he was now debuted as the &quot;father of the uranium&quot; bomb. On 28 May 1998, it was the KRL&#x27;s HEU that ultimately created the nuclear chain reaction which led the successful detonation of boosted fission devices in a scientific experiment codenamed Chagai-I.

=== Plutonium ===
In July 1976 Abdul Qadeer Khan told leading Pakistani politicians that the Pakistani Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) was completely incapable of meeting a deadline of December of that year for producing enough plutonium for a nuclear weapon. Shortly thereafter, he was placed in charge of a new organization independent of the PAEC tasked with producing plutonium for nuclear weapons. At that point, Pakistan had not yet completed the less difficult step of subcritical, cold testing, and would not do so until 1983 in Kirana Hills.

PAEC continued its research on plutonium and built the 40–50 MW (megawatt, thermal) Khushab Reactor Complex at Joharabad. In April 1998, Pakistan announced that the nuclear reactor was operational. The Khushab reactor project was initiated in 1986 by Munir Khan, who informed the world that the reactor was totally indigenous, i.e. that it was designed and built by Pakistani scientists and engineers. Various Pakistani industries contributed in 82% of the reactor&#x27;s construction. The Project-Director for this project was Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood. According to public statements made by the US Government officials, this heavy-water reactor can produce up to 8 to 10 kg of plutonium per year with increase in the production by the development of newer facilities, sufficient for at least one nuclear weapon. The reactor could also produce  if it were loaded with , although this is unnecessary for the purposes of nuclear weapons, because modern nuclear weapon designs use directly. According to J. Cirincione of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Khushab&#x27;s Plutonium production capacity has allowed Pakistan to develop lighter nuclear warheads that would be easier to deliver to any place in the range of the ballistic missiles.

PAEC also created a separated electromagnetic isotope separation program alongside the enrichment program, under Dr. G D Allam, a theoretical physicist. The plutonium electromagnetic separation takes place at the &quot;New Laboratories&quot;, a reprocessing plant, which was completed by 1981 by PAEC and is next to the Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology (PINSTECH) near Islamabad, which is not subject to IAEA inspections and safeguards.

In late 2006, the Institute for Science and International Security released intelligence reports and imagery showing the construction of a new plutonium reactor at the Khushab nuclear site. The reactor is deemed to be large enough to produce enough plutonium to facilitate the creation of as many as &quot;40 to 50 nuclear weapons a year.&quot; The &quot;New York Times&quot; carried the story with the insight that this would be Pakistan&#x27;s third plutonium reactor, signalling a shift to dual-stream development, with Plutonium-based devices supplementing the nation&#x27;s existing HEU stream to atomic warheads. On 30 May 1998, Pakistan proved its plutonium capability in a scientific experiment and sixth nuclear test: codename Chagai-II. There is controversy regarding environmental damage caused by the test, which dismissed by Balochistan media which worked with the government as misinformation, since the test were carried out hundred meters underground of Ras Koh hill and the explosions were not damaging any environment of the any areas in Pakistan or India.

=== Stockpile ===


Estimates of Pakistan&#x27;s stockpile of nuclear warheads vary. The most recent analysis, published in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in 2010, estimates that Pakistan has 70–90 nuclear warheads. In 2001, the US-based Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) estimated that Pakistan had built 24–48 HEU-based nuclear warheads with HEU reserves for 30–52 additional warheads. In 2003, the US Navy Center for Contemporary Conflict estimated that Pakistan possessed between 35 and 95 nuclear warheads, with a median of 60. In 2003, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace estimated a stockpile of approximately 50 weapons. By contrast, in 2000, US military and intelligence sources estimated that Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear arsenal may be as large as 100 warheads. In 2018, the Federation of American Scientists estimated that the arsenal was about 120-130 warheads.

The actual size of Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear stockpile is hard for experts to gauge owing to the extreme secrecy which surrounds the program in Pakistan. However, in 2007, retired Pakistan Army&#x27;s Brigadier-General Feroz Khan, previously second in command at the Strategic Arms Division of Pakistans&#x27; Military told a Pakistani newspaper that Pakistan had &quot;about 80 to 120 genuine warheads.&quot;

Pakistan&#x27;s first nuclear tests were made in May 1998, when six warheads were tested under codename Chagai-I and Chagai-II. It is reported that the yields from these tests were 12 kt, 30 to 36 kt and four low-yield (below 1 kt) tests. From these tests Pakistan can be estimated to have developed operational warheads of 20 to 25 kt and 150 kt in the shape of low weight compact designs and may have 300–500 kt large-size warheads. The low-yield weapons are probably in nuclear bombs carried on fighter-bombers such as the Dassault Mirage III and fitted to Pakistan&#x27;s short-range ballistic missiles, while the higher-yield warheads are probably fitted to the Shaheen series and Ghauri series ballistic missiles.

=== Second strike capability ===
According to a US congressional report, Pakistan has addressed issues of survivability in a possible nuclear conflict through second strike capability. Pakistan has been dealing with efforts to develop new weapons and at the same time, have a strategy for surviving a nuclear war. Pakistan has built hard and deeply buried storage and launch facilities to retain a second strike capability in a nuclear war. In January 2000, two years past after the atomic tests, US intelligence officials stated that previous intelligence estimates &quot;overstated the capabilities of India&#x27;s homegrown arsenal and understate those of Pakistan&quot;. The United States Central Command commander, General Anthony Zinni told the NBC that longtime assumptions, that &quot;India had an edge in the South Asian strategic balance of power, were questionable at best. Don&#x27;t assume that Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear capability is inferior to the Indians&quot;, General Zinni quoted to NBC.

It was confirmed that Pakistan has built Soviet-style road-mobile missiles, state-of-the-art air defences around strategic sites, and other concealment measures. In 1998, Pakistan had &#x27;at least six secret locations&#x27; and since then it is believed Pakistan may have many more such secret sites. In 2008, the United States admitted that it did not know where all of Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear sites are located. Pakistani defence officials have continued to rebuff and deflect American requests for more details about the location and security of the country&#x27;s nuclear sites.

=== Personnel ===
In 2010, Russian foreign ministry official Yuriy Korolev stated that there are somewhere between 120,000 and 130,000 people directly involved in Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear and missile programs, a figure considered extremely large for a developing country.

=== Alleged foreign co-operation ===
Historically, the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) has been repeatedly charged with allegedly transferring missile and related materials to Pakistan. Despite China strongly dismissing the charges and accusations, the United States alleged China to have played a major role in the establishment of Pakistan&#x27;s atomic bomb development infrastructure. There are also unofficial reports in Western media that the nuclear weapon technology and the weapon-grade enriched uranium was transferred to Pakistan by China. China has consistently maintained that it has not sold any weapon parts or components to Pakistan or anyone else. In August 2001, it was reported that US officials confronted China numerous times over this issue and pointed out &quot;rather bluntly&quot; to Chinese officials that the evidences from intelligence sources was &quot;powerful.&quot; But they had been rebuffed by the Chinese, who have retorted by referring to the US support for Taiwan&#x27;s military build-up which Beijing says is directed against it.

The former US officials have also disclosed that China had allegedly transferred technology to Pakistan and conducting putative test for it in 1980. However, senior scientists and officials strongly dismissed the US disclosure, and in 1998 interview given to Kamran Khan, Abdul Qadeer Khan maintained to the fact that, &quot;due to its sensitivity, no country allows another country to use their tests site to explode the devices,&quot; although the UK conducted such tests in Australia and the United States. His statement was also traced by Samar Mubarakmand who acknowledged that cold tests were carried out, under codename &quot;Kirana-I&quot;, in a test site which was built by the Corps of Engineers under the guidance of the PAEC. According to a 2001 Department of Defense report, China has supplied Pakistan with nuclear materials and has provided critical technical assistance in the construction of Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear weapons development facilities, in violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, of which China is a signatory. In 2001 visit to India, the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress Li Peng rejected all the accusations against China to Indian media and strongly maintained on the ground that &quot;his country was not giving any nuclear arms to Pakistan nor transferring related-technology to it.&quot; Talking to a media correspondents and Indian parliamentarians, Li Peng frankly quoted: &quot;We do not help Pakistan in its atomic bomb projects. Pakistan is a friendly country with whom we have good economic and political relations.&quot;

In 1986, it was reported that both countries have signed a mutual treaty of peaceful use of civil nuclear technology agreement in which China would supply Pakistan a civil-purpose nuclear power plant. A grand ceremony was held in Beijing where Pakistan&#x27;s then-Foreign Minister Yakub Khan signed on behalf of Pakistan in the presence of Munir Khan and Chinese Prime Minister. Therefore, in 1989, Pakistan reached agreement with China for the supply of the 300-MW commercial &quot;CHASHNUPP-1&quot; nuclear reactor.

In February 1990, President François Mitterrand of France visited Pakistan and announced that France had agreed to supply a 900 MWe commercial nuclear power plant to Pakistan. However, after the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was dismissed in August 1990, the French nuclear power plant deal went into cold storage and the agreement could not be implemented due to financial constraints and the Pakistani government&#x27;s apathy. Also in February 1990, Soviet Ambassador to Pakistan, V.P. Yakunin, said that the Soviet regime was considering a request from Pakistan for the supply of a nuclear power plant. The Soviet and French civilian nuclear power plant was on its way during the 1990s. However, Bob Oakley, the US Ambassador to Pakistan, expressed US displeasure at the recent agreement made between France and Pakistan for the sale of a nuclear power plant. After the US concerns the civilian-nuclear technology agreements were cancelled by France and Soviet Union.

Declassified documents from 1982, released in 2012 under the US Freedom of Information Act, said that US intelligence detected that Pakistan was seeking suspicious procurements from Belgium, Finland, Japan, Sweden and Turkey.

According to more recent reports, it has been alleged that North Korea had been secretly supplying Pakistan with ballistic missile technology in exchange for nuclear weapons technology.

Some reports also reveal continued supply of dual-use items from China to Pakistan in recent times. In February 2020, India caught the transshipment of an industrial autoclave from Jiangyin Port, China to Karachi. The shipment was stopped at Kandla Port in India on February 3, 2020. The autoclave on the ship was identified as an industrial dryer, a dual-use technology with relevance in the production of rocket motors for ballistic missiles. On January 23, 2024, India intercepted a Malta flagged ship, CMA CGM-Attila, at Mumbai’s Nhava Sheva Port, for carrying a “dual-use consignment” identified as a computer numerical control (CNC) machine, produced by an Italian company, from China to Pakistan. The shipment was being sent to “Pakistan Wings Pvt. Ltd.” in Sialkot and part of the consignment was for “Cosmos Engineering,” a Pakistani defense supplier.

=== Doctrine ===
Pakistan refuses to adopt a &quot;no-first-use&quot; doctrine, indicating that it would strike India with nuclear weapons even if India did not use such weapons first. Pakistan&#x27;s asymmetric nuclear posture has significant influence on India&#x27;s decision and ability to retaliate, as shown in 2001 and 2008 crises, when non-state actors carried out deadly attacks on Indian soil, only to be met with a relatively subdued response from India. A military spokesperson stated that &quot;Pakistan&#x27;s threat of nuclear first-use deterred India from seriously considering conventional military strikes.&quot; India is Pakistan&#x27;s primary geographic neighbour and primary strategic competitor, helping drive Pakistan&#x27;s conventional warfare capability and nuclear weapons development: The two countries share an 1800-mile border and have suffered a violent history—four wars in less than seven decades. The past three decades have seen India&#x27;s economy eclipse that of Pakistan&#x27;s, allowing the former to outpace the latter in defence expenditure at a decreasing share of GDP. In comparison to population, &quot;India is more powerful than Pakistan by almost every metric of military, economic, and political power—and the gap continues to grow,&quot; a Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs report claims.

=== Theory of deterrence ===
The theory of &quot;N-deterrence&quot; has been frequently being interpreted by the various government-in-time of effect of Pakistan. Although the nuclear deterrence theory was officially adopted in 1998 as part of Pakistan&#x27;s defence theory, on the other hand, the theory has had been interpreted by the government since in 1972. The relative weakness in defensive warfare is highlighted in Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear posture, which Pakistan considers its primary deterrent from Indian conventional offensives or nuclear attack. Nuclear theorist Brigadier-General Feroz Hassan Khan adds: &quot;The Pakistani situation is akin to NATO&#x27;s position in the Cold War. There are geographic gaps and corridors similar to those that existed in Europe ... that are vulnerable to exploitation by mechanized Indian forces ... With its relatively smaller conventional force, and lacking adequate technical means, especially in early warning and surveillance, Pakistan relies on a more proactive nuclear defensive policy.&quot;

American political scientist Vipin Narang, however, argues that Pakistan&#x27;s asymmetric escalation posture, or the rapid first use of nuclear weapons against conventional attacks to deter their outbreak, increases instability in South Asia. Narang supports his arguments by noting to the fact that since India&#x27;s assured retaliation nuclear posture has not deterred these provocations, Pakistan&#x27;s passive nuclear posture has neutralised India&#x27;s conventional options for now; limited retaliation would be militarily futile, and more significant conventional retaliation is simply off the table.&quot;

The strategists in Pakistan Armed Forces has ceded nuclear assets and a degree of nuclear launch code authority to lower-level officers to ensure weapon usability in a &quot;fog of war&quot; scenario, making credible its deterrence doctrine. On further military perspective, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), has retrospectively contended that &quot;theory of defense is not view to enter into a &quot;nuclear race&quot;, but to follow a policy of &quot;peaceful co-existence&quot; in the region, it cannot remain oblivious to the developments in South Asia.&quot; The Pakistan Government officials and strategists have consistently emphasised that nuclear deterrence is intended by maintaining a balance to safeguard its sovereignty and ensure peace in the region.

Pakistan&#x27;s motive for pursuing a nuclear weapons development program is never to allow another invasion of Pakistan. President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq allegedly told the Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1987 that, &quot;If your forces cross our borders by an inch, we are going to annihilate your cities.&quot;

Pakistan has not signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) or the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). According to the United States Department of Defense report cited above, &quot;Pakistan remains steadfast in its refusal to sign the NPT, stating that it would do so only after India joined the Treaty. Pakistan has responded to the report by stating that the United States itself has not ratified the CTBT. Consequently, not all of Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear facilities are under IAEA safeguards. Pakistani officials have stated that signature of the CTBT is in Pakistan&#x27;s best interest, but that Pakistan will do so only after developing a domestic consensus on the issue, and have disavowed any connection with India&#x27;s decision.&quot;

The Congressional Research Service, in a report published on 23 July 2012, said that in addition to expanding its nuclear arsenal, Pakistan could broaden the circumstances under which it would be willing to use nuclear weapons.

=== Nuclear Command and Control ===
The government institutional organisation authorised to make critical decisions about Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear posturing is the Pakistan National Command Authority (NCA), the genesis of which was in the 1970s and has been constitutionally established since February 2000. The NCA is composed of two civic-military committees that advises and console both Prime minister and the President of Pakistan, on the development and deployment of nuclear weapons; it is also responsible for war-time command and control. In 2001, Pakistan further consolidated its nuclear weapons infrastructure by placing the Khan Research Laboratories and the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission under the control of one Nuclear Defense Complex. In November 2009, Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari announced that he will be replaced by Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani as the chairman of NCA. The NCA consists of the Employment Control Committee (ECC) and the Development Control Committee (DCC), both now chaired by the Prime Minister. The Foreign minister and Economic Minister serves as a deputy chairmen of the ECC, the body which defines nuclear strategy, including the deployment and employment of strategic forces, and would advise the prime minister on nuclear use. The committee includes key senior cabinet ministers as well as the respective military chiefs of staff. The ECC reviews presentations on strategic threat perceptions, monitors the progress of weapons development, and decides on responses to emerging threats. It also establishes guidelines for effective command-and-control practices to safeguard against the accidental or unauthorised use of nuclear weapons.

The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee is the deputy chairman of the Development Control Committee (DCC), the body responsible for weapons development and oversight which includes the nation&#x27;s military and scientific, but not its political, leadership. Through DCC, the senior civilian scientists maintains a tight control of scientific and ethical research; the DCC exercises technical, financial and administrative control over all strategic organisations, including national laboratories and scientific research and development organisations associated with the development and modernisation of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems. Functioning through the SPD, the DCC oversees the systematic progress of weapon systems to fulfil the force goals set by the committee.

Under the National Command Authority, its secretariat, Strategic Plans Division (SPD), is responsible for the physical protection and to ensure security of all aspects of country&#x27;s nuclear arsenals and maintains dedicated force for this purpose. The SPD functions under the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee at the Joint Headquarters (JS HQ) and reports directly to the Prime Minister. The comprehensive nuclear force planning is integrated with conventional war planning at the National Security Council (NSC). According to the officials of Pakistan&#x27;s military science circles, it is the high-profile civic-military committee consisting the Cabinet ministers, President, Prime minister and the four services chiefs, all of whom who reserves the right to order the deployment and the operational use of the nuclear weapons. The final and executive political decisions on nuclear arsenals deployments, operational use, and nuclear weapons politics are made during the sessions of the Defence Committee of the Cabinet, which is chaired by the Prime minister. It is this DCC Council where the final political guidelines, discussions and the nuclear arsenals operational deployments are approved by the Prime minister. The DCC reaffirmed its policies on development of nuclear energy and arsenals through the country&#x27;s media.

=== US security assistance ===

From the end of 2001 the United States has provided material assistance to aid Pakistan in guarding its nuclear material, warheads and laboratories. The cost of the program has been almost $100 million. Specifically the United States has provided helicopters, night-vision goggles and nuclear detection equipment. In addition, the US has funded the creation of a nuclear security training center, fencing, intrusion detectors, and identification systems.

During this period Pakistan also began to develop a modern export control regulatory regime with US assistance. It supplements the US National Nuclear Security Administration Megaports program at Port Qasim, Karachi, which deployed radiation monitors and imaging equipment monitored by a Pakistani central alarm station.

Pakistan turned down the offer of Permissive Action Link (PAL) technology, a sophisticated &quot;weapon release&quot; program which initiates use via specific checks and balances, possibly because it feared the secret implanting of &quot;dead switches&quot;. But Pakistan is since believed to have developed and implemented its own version of PAL and US military officials have stated they believe Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear arsenals to be well secured.

==== Security concerns of the United States ====
Since 2004 the US government has reportedly been concerned about the safety of Pakistani nuclear facilities and weapons. Press reports have suggested that the United States has contingency plans to send in special forces to help &quot;secure the Pakistani nuclear arsenal&quot;. In 2007, Lisa Curtis of The Heritage Foundation, while giving testimony before the United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, concluded that &quot;preventing Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear weapons and technology from falling into the hands of terrorists should be a top priority for the US.&quot; However Pakistan&#x27;s government has ridiculed claims that the weapons are not secure.

Diplomatic reports published in the United States diplomatic cables leak revealed US and British worries over a potential threat posed by Islamists. In February 2009 cable from Islamabad, former US Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson said &quot;Our major concern is not having an Islamic militant steal an entire weapon but rather the chance someone working in [Pakistani government] facilities could gradually smuggle enough material out to eventually make a weapon.&quot;

A report published by &quot;The Times&quot; in early 2010 states that the United States is training an elite unit to recover Pakistani nuclear weapons or materials should they be seized by militants, possibly from within the Pakistani nuclear security organisation. This was done in the context of growing Anti-Americanism in the Pakistani Armed Forces, multiple attacks on sensitive installations over the previous 2 years and rising tensions. According to former US intelligence official Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, US concerns are justified because militants have struck at several Pakistani military facilities and bases since 2007. According to this report, the United States does not know the locations of all Pakistani nuclear sites and has been denied access to most of them. However, during a visit to Pakistan in January 2010, the US Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates denied that the United States had plans to take over Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear weapons.

A study by Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University titled &#x27;Securing the Bomb 2010&#x27;, found that Pakistan&#x27;s stockpile &quot;faces a greater threat from Islamic extremists seeking nuclear weapons than any other nuclear stockpile on earth&quot;.

According to Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a former investigator with the CIA and the US Department of Energy there is &quot;a greater possibility of a nuclear meltdown in Pakistan than anywhere else in the world. The region has more violent extremists than any other, the country is unstable, and its arsenal of nuclear weapons is expanding.&quot;

Nuclear weapons expert David Albright author of &#x27;Peddling Peril&#x27; has also expressed concerns that Pakistan&#x27;s stockpile may not be secure despite assurances by both the Pakistani and US governments. He stated Pakistan &quot;has had many leaks from its program of classified information and sensitive nuclear equipment, and so you have to worry that it could be acquired in Pakistan,&quot;
However the U.S. intelligence official said there is no indication that terrorists have gotten anything from Pakistan, and added there is confidence right now in Pakistan&#x27;s security apparatus. The Pakistanis store their nuclear stockpile in a way that makes it difficult to put the pieces together; that is, components are located in different places. The official said Pakistan has put the appropriate safeguards in place.
A 2010 study by the Congressional Research Service titled &#x27;Pakistan&#x27;s Nuclear Weapons: Proliferation and Security Issues&#x27; noted that even though Pakistan had taken several steps to enhance Nuclear security in recent years &#x27;Instability in Pakistan has called the extent and durability of these reforms into question.&#x27;

In April 2011, IAEA&#x27;s deputy director general Denis Flory declared Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear programme safe and secure. According to the IAEA, Pakistan is currently contributing more than $1.16 million in IAEA&#x27;s Nuclear Security Fund, making Pakistan the 10th largest contributor.

In response to a November 2011 article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; written by Jeffrey Goldberg highlighting concerns about the safety of Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear weapons program, the Pakistani Government announced that it would train an additional 8,000 people to protect the country&#x27;s nuclear arsenal. At the same time, the Pakistani Government also denounced the article. Training will be completed no later than 2013.

Pakistan consistently maintains that it has tightened the security over the several years. In 2010, the Chairman Joint Chiefs General Tariq Majid exhorted to the world delegation at the National Defence University that, &quot;World must accept Pakistan as nuclear power.&quot; While dismissing all the concerns on the safety of country&#x27;s nuclear arsenal, General Majid maintains to the fact: &quot;We are shouldering our responsibility with utmost vigilance and confidence. We have put in place a very robust regime that includes &quot;multilayered mechanisms&quot; and processes to secure our strategic assets, and have provided maximum transparency on our practices. We have reassured the international community on this issue over and over again and our track record since the time our atomic bomb programme was made overt has been unblemished.&quot;

On 7 September 2013, the US Department of State said &quot;Pakistan has a professional and dedicated security force that fully understands the importance of nuclear security.&quot; Pakistan had earlier rejected claims in US media that the Obama administration was worried about the safety of Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear weapons, saying the country has a professional and robust system to monitor its nukes.

=== Land ===
, Pakistan possesses a wide variety of nuclear-capable medium range ballistic missiles with ranges up to 2750 km. Pakistan also possesses nuclear-tipped Babur cruise missiles with ranges up to 700 km. In April 2012, Pakistan launched a Hatf-4 Shaheen-1A, said to be capable of carrying a nuclear warhead designed to evade missile-defense systems. These land-based missiles are controlled by Army Strategic Forces Command of Pakistan Army.

Pakistan is also believed to be developing tactical nuclear weapons for use on the battlefield with ranges up to 60 km such as the Nasr missile. According to Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Non-proliferation Program at the Monterey Institute of International Studies, citing a Pakistani news article, Pakistan is developing its own equivalent to the Davy Crockett launcher with a miniaturised warhead that may be similar to the W54.

=== Air ===
The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) is believed to have practiced &quot;toss-bombing&quot; in the 1980s and 1990s, a method of launching weapons from fighter-bombers which can also be used to deliver nuclear warheads. The PAF has two dedicated units (No. 16 &quot;Black Panthers&quot; and No. 26 &quot;Black Spiders&quot;) operating 27 aircraft in each squadron (78 aircraft total) of the JF-17 Thunder, believed to be the preferred vehicle for delivery of nuclear weapons. These units are major part of the Air Force Strategic Command, a command responsible for nuclear response. The PAF also operates a fleet of F-16 fighters, of which 18 were delivered in 2012 and confirmed by General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, are capable of carrying nuclear weapons. With a third squadron being raised, this would bring the total number of dedicated nuclear capable aircraft to a total of 75. The PAF also possesses the Ra&#x27;ad air-launched cruise missile which has a range of 350 km and can carry a nuclear warhead with a yield of between 10kt and 35kt.

A 2016 report by Hans M. Kristensen stated that &quot;The F-16s were considered to be the first planes that are nuclear-capable in the Pakistan arsenal and the French Mirage III was upgraded as well to carry a new air launch cruise missile. But the United States made its case. What Pakistan does once they get the planes is inevitably up to them,&quot; he said. The report also stated that Pakistan is obliged under the terms of its contract to ask the US for permission before the fighters are converted. To date, the US has given only two countries (Pakistan and Israel) implicit permission to modify their F-16s to carry nuclear warheads.

It has also been reported that an air-launched cruise missile (ALCM) with a range of 350 km has been developed by Pakistan, designated Hatf 8 and named Ra&#x27;ad, which may theoretically be armed with a nuclear warhead. It was reported to have been test-fired by a Mirage III fighter and, according to one Western official, is believed to be capable of penetrating some air defence/missile defence systems.

=== Sea ===
The Pakistan Navy was first publicly reported to be considering deployment of nuclear weapons on submarines in February 2001. Later in 2003 it was stated by Admiral Shahid Karimullah, then Chief of Naval Staff, that there were no plans for deploying nuclear weapons on submarines but if &quot;forced to&quot; they would be. In 2004, Pakistan Navy established the Naval Strategic Forces Command and made it responsible for countering and battling naval-based weapons of mass destruction. It is believed by most experts that Pakistan is developing a sea-based variant of the Hatf VII Babur, which is a nuclear-capable ground-launched cruise missile.

On 9 January 2017, Pakistan conducted a successful launch of the Babur III missile from an underwater mobile platform. The Babur-III has a range of 450 km and can be used as a second-strike capability. It has been speculated that the missile is ultimately designed to be incorporated with (Under construction) Hangor-class submarine and the Agosta 90B class submarine which has been reported to have been modified. However no such tests have been carried out yet. On 29 March 2018, Pakistan reported that the missile had again been successfully tested.

With a stockpile of plutonium, Pakistan would be able to produce a variety of miniature nuclear warheads which would allow it to nuclear-tip the C-802 and C-803 anti-ship missiles as well as being able to develop nuclear torpedoes, nuclear depth bombs and nuclear naval mines.

==== Nuclear submarine ====
In response to INS &quot;Arihant&quot;, India&#x27;s first nuclear submarine, the Pakistan Navy pushed forward a proposal to build its own nuclear submarine as a direct response to the Indian nuclear submarine program. Many military experts believe that Pakistan has the capability of building a nuclear submarine and is ready to build such a fleet. In February 2012, the Navy announced it would start work on the construction of a nuclear submarine to better meet the Indian Navy&#x27;s nuclear threat. According to the Navy, the nuclear submarine is an ambitious project, and will be designed and built indigenously. However, the Navy stressed that &quot;the project completion and trials would take anywhere from between 5 to 8 years to build the nuclear submarine after which Pakistan would join the list of countries that has a nuclear submarine.&quot;

<text>Directory Services Markup Language (DSML) is a representation of directory service information in an XML syntax. 

The DSML version 1 effort was announced on July 12, 1999 by creator Bowstreet (subsequently acquired by IBM in 2005). Initiative supporters include AOL-Netscape, Sun Microsystems, Oracle, Novell, Microsoft, and IBM. It resulted in a Document Type Definition for a file containing the XML representation of entries in the LDAP data model, similar in spirit to LDIF. The DSML version 2 effort was promulgated in OASIS in 2001. It resulted in an XML schema for the representation of directory access operations based on that of LDAP, that could be carried in SOAP. 

The Service Provisioning Markup Language (SPML) also from OASIS is based on the concepts of DSMLv2, but does not have such a tight coupling to the LDAP information model.

DSML is often pronounced &quot;dismal&quot;.

<doc id="872934" wikidata="Q2321041" url="?curid=872934" title="Donabate">
<text>Donabate () is an outer suburb of Dublin, Ireland, about north-northeast of Dublin, within the local government area of Fingal. The town is on a peninsula on Ireland&#x27;s east coast, between the Rogerstown Estuary to the north and Broadmeadow Estuary to the south. Donabate is a civil parish in the ancient barony of Nethercross.

==Geography==
The Portrane–Donabate peninsula forms a distinctive hammer-head shape. This is because each of the mouths of both estuaries surrounding the peninsula are partially closed by large sand spits stretching north to south. The northern spit contains Portrane beach which almost touches Rush South Beach but for a narrow channel entering the Rogerstown Estuary. A stretch of low limestone cliffs to the south of Portrane beach leads to Balcarrick or Corballis Beach, which is the east face of the southern spit. The southern Broadmeadow estuary is likewise almost completely enclosed and is fed by the Broadmeadow River. The shelter provided by the spits makes the estuaries important wildlife habitats and both are protected under the international Ramsar Convention.
==History==
The 1911 census recorded that the town had a population of 734 people who lived in 150 dwellings. It remained a small village for more than a century. In recent years, the area&#x27;s access to the capital city of Dublin has improved with upgraded roads and the re-opening of a former railway station. The census of 1996 recorded that the population was 1,868; by the time of the 2002 census it had doubled to 3,854. The most recent 2022 census results record a population of 9,669.

&quot;Donabate &amp; Portrane - a history&quot; was first written and published in 1988 by Peadar Bates, Donabate/Portrane historian, at the promptings of the local Historical Society (p. 4). The book was revised with added knowledge in 2001. It includes information on the beginnings of Donabate in Turvey around the 7th century AD (p. 12), the building of Lanistown Castle, probably around 1376 when the Bathe family first came into the possession of the lands (p. 99), the building of Newbridge House between 1698 and 1705 (p. 113) and the subsequent purchase of 1490 acres of land, including the house, by the Cobbe family in 1736 (p. 88). In 1846, Charles Cobbe forwarded a petition for the establishment of a relief committee during the Great Famine (pp. 147–150). The book includes the reproduction of maps, photos, paintings, letters (pp. 154–168), as well as other documents.

In July 2022, a tunnel was found by accident in the Corballis area of Donabate, on land subject to a planning application later granted in November 2022, when a farmer turned a stone on his field. The stone covered the entrance of a chamber and a tunnel, possibly dating from the early medieval period, 7th century AD to about 1100 AD.

==Representation==

The Donabate–Portrane peninsula is in the local electoral area of Rush–Lusk, which elects five councillors to Fingal County Council. Donabate is in the Dáil constituency of Dublin Fingal, which elects five TDs to Dáil Éireann. From the 2024 general election, it will be part of the three-seat constituency of Dublin Fingal East.

Donabate Portrane Community Council is the community council for the Donabate Portrane Peninsula.

Donabate Portrane Community and Leisure Centre is the area&#x27;s newest public building, that opened in 2001. The town has an active Chamber of Commerce, Scout Group (63rd Dublin 14th Port Donabate), and two soccer clubs (St Ita&#x27;s AFC and Portrane Athletic), a G.A.A club (St Patrick&#x27;s), Karate and Tae-Kwon Do clubs, a snooker club, a Historical and Folklore Society, and a Tidy Towns Committee, among other groups.

==Education==
National schools (primary schools) serving the area include Donabate Portrane Educate Together National School, St Patrick&#x27;s Girls National School, and St Patrick&#x27;s Boys National School. Donabate Community College VEC is a local post-primary school (secondary school). Donabate opened its first Gaelscoil primary school, Gaelscoil na Mara, in 2020.

==Religion==
Donabate was a distinct parish in the Fingal North deanery of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin. It is currently part of the grouped parishes of Donabate, Portrane and Balheary. It is served by the church of St Patrick.

Other churches in the area include: Church of Ireland (St Patrick&#x27;s Church), since 1968 it is part of the Group of parishes which include Swords and Kilsallaghan (Donabate having also been merged with St. Catherine&#x27;s Church, Portrane, since 1835) and Donabate Presbyterian Church, which meets at Donabate Portrane Community Centre.

==Sport==

===Golf===
There are five courses on the peninsula: The Island Golf Club, Beaverstown Golf Club, Balcarrick Golf Club, Donabate Golf Club (a 27-hole course) and Corballis Links Golf Club (a public course). The peninsula was once home to a sixth club, Turvey Golf Club, situated on the former Turvey estate, that has since closed. Many of these have views of the estuaries or the open sea, including links courses such as The Island, which is ranked as one of the top 20 courses in Ireland.

===GAA===
St Patrick&#x27;s GAA (Cumann Lúthchleas Gael, Naomh Pádraig) club in Donabate dates from 1924. It is an active club with a membership of over 300 . The club play at Robbie Farrell Park,
Ballymastone in Donabate. Gaelic Football and Hurling are played at adult level as well as at under-age levels from an expanding nursery section. The club colours are green and black.

===Football===
St. Ita&#x27;s Athletic Football Club (AFC) has been active in Donabate Portrane from the early 20th century. They currently play in the Leinster league and field many underage players.

The main pitch is the grounds of the St. Ita&#x27;s Hospital and they also play on pitches in Portrane and Balcarrick Road. Club colours are green and white.

===Water sports===

Although Ireland&#x27;s east coast is not ideal for surfing, surfers are regularly seen at Balcarrick / Corballis beach. Kayaking, sailing and wind surfing are popular water sports especially in the Broadmeadow estuary with access from Donabate and Malahide. There are marinas in Rush and Malahide. Kite surfing is rising in popularity on the beaches of Portrane, Rush and Skerries. The use of jet skis and fast powerboats is restricted by law in the estuaries and beaches and regulated by permit.

Both Balcarrick / Corballis and Portrane beaches are staffed by lifeguards during the summer months. In 2009 Portrane beach was among several Irish beaches to lose its blue flag status for beach excellence due to poor water quality, but subsequently regained blue flag status and from 2011 to 2015 had a status of Good or Excellent. Corballis / Balcarrick beach has an area used by naturists.

===Hockey===
Portrane Hockey Club was founded in 1919 and plays in the Leinster senior league. The club suffered from the introduction of compulsory synthetic pitches in the 1990s as they were unable to continue using their grass pitch in St. Ita&#x27;s Hospital. However, the club had remained active and hoped to move to an all-weather pitch on the site of the Secondary School scheduled for September 2010. But a flood caused the pitch to be unsafe for play. In 2015 the pitch was up and running again.

===Equestrian===
The hunter trials of the Ward Union Hunt are held at Corballis Farm in Corballis Donabate.

===Bouldering===
The cliffs between Donabate and Portrane have recently become known as a site for bouldering.

==Culture==

===Newbridge Estate===

Donabate has a fine historical &quot;Big House and Estate&quot; at Newbridge Estate. Newbridge House is a Georgian mansion built for Charles Cobbe, Archbishop of Dublin in 1736. It sits on of eighteenth-century landscaped parklands with perimeter woodland belts and fine vistas across lawns and wildflower meadows. The grounds also include a late medieval castellated tower house named Lanestown Castle. The estate was bought by Fingal County Council in a unique arrangement with the Cobbe family in 1985 and is now a public park, playground and model farm, while the family continue to maintain an apartment within the main building on a part-time basis. The park is a popular recreational area all year round, and also contains playing pitches used by local sports clubs. Donabate has had a traditional market sale of lemon drizzle cakes by the church since 1969.

Newbridge House was a location for the 1965 film &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot;. In 2009 a previously unrecognised rare portrait of William Shakespeare was found to have been hanging in the drawing-room of the house.

The Farm at Newbridge can be found to the west and north of Newbridge House and beside the Walled Garden. Between 1989 and 1990 the County Council Parks Department undertook the renovation, reconstruction and restoration of the Courtyard, Haggard and adjoining buildings restoring it to its 19th-century Victorian character. A wide range of farm animals and fowl are now housed here, including many rare or show breeds, and it is a popular visitor attraction.

=== Transition Town Donabate Portrane ===

Donabate has a vibrant Transition Town movement. There are currently a number of projects running in the Donabate area including a local weekly food market, and also to transform the disused St. Ita&#x27;s Gardens &amp; Farm into a working community farm and orchard.

==Wildlife==
In 2008 Fingal County Council published an ambitious plan to develop a large wildlife park and natural amenity that would span both sides of the Rogerstown Estuary. Fingal Parks Department gave a summary of some of the features of the plan as:
The proposed development will include new entrances, a car park with 120 car parking spaces, 250 allotments,
 of walkways, a new bridge adjacent to the railway bridge, woodland and hedgerow planting, hay meadows,
reintroduction of cattle to graze the grasslands and interpretative facilities.

The plan includes: bridges over the estuary; pedestrian links with Newbridge and the village; parking facilities; allotments; look-out towers; a new park on the old baleally landfill on the north side of the estuary; picnic areas; and of woodland and grassland trails.

===Rogerstown Estuary===
Rogerstown Estuary is an important wetland habitat. It has several designations in recognition of this including that of Statutory Nature Reserve. BirdWatch Ireland owns land on both the north and south shores of the inner estuary and played a large role in preserving the area in its natural state in spite of its proximity to large urban areas by purchasing tracts of land and entering into management agreements with the Council and landowners. The Fingal Branch of BirdWatch Ireland operates two hides in Rogerstown which are wardened at weekends during certain times of the year.

===Broadmeadow Estuary===
Broadmeadow Estuary, like the Rogerstown Estuary, is designated a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) and Special Protection Area (SPA). The estuary has an internationally important population of Brent Goose and nationally important populations of other species of birds.

==Transport==

===Rail===

Donabate railway station, in the centre of the town, is on the Belfast–Dublin line and is served by Northern Commuter line trains between Dublin and Dundalk. The Transport 21 infrastructure plan envisaged electrification north of Malahide and through Donabate as far as Balbriggan by 2015, though this was subsequently indefinitely deferred.
There is a possible chance that the proposed Metrolink runs through Donabate.

===Viaduct collapse===

On 21 August 2009 the 18:07 train from Balbriggan to Connolly was passing over the viaduct when the driver noticed subsidence and the embankment giving way on the northbound track. The train passed over the bridge before it collapsed and the driver alerted authorities. This was later determined to be caused by scour A major catastrophe was avoided but commuters faced significant subsequent disruption. A bus service was added between Donabate and Malahide train stations to facilitate passenger transport.

===Road===
The R126 regional road, connecting Portrane to the R127 and the M1 motorway, runs through the town. Go-Ahead Ireland service 33B from Swords to Portrane and Dublin Bus service 33D from Custom House Quay to Portrane serve Donabate. During the morning peak times some service 33 routes serve Donabate.

Owing to the proximity of the area to Dublin city, Dublin Airport and major national road networks, the area houses Tesco Donabate Distribution Centre which is the eleventh largest building in the world by usable volume.

<text>&#x27;Biocomplexity&#x27; is a multidisciplinary field that examines and investigates emergent properties arising from the interaction of multiple biological agents, phenomena, and systems, which may range in spatiotemporal scales, biological relationships,interactions and levels from molecules to ecosystems. Research in this area investigates the nonlinear or chaotic dynamics, unpredictable behavior, self-organization, and adaptation of living systems, aware that biological systems can display characteristics that cannot be understood through the study of individual properties alone.

Biocomplexity sheds light on the interconnectedness of life, recognizing that the behavior of biological entities emerges from the intricate interplay of countless biotic and abiotic factors. This understanding enables us to grasp how living systems can exhibit properties that go beyond the mere sum of their elements, opening up new possibilities for addressing real-world challenges in diverse fields such as medicine, ecology, and biotechnology.

To answer questions about system resilience, self-organization and adaptation, new modelling approaches have been developed and researchers are transitioning to more quantitative methods in order to better understand and analyze complex human and natural systems. These approaches focus on questions about system properties and interactions that create self-organizing or emergent behavior, and the circumstances in which unexpected system responses may occur. Analyzing the state of these systems can provide insight into system resilience, vulnerability, and management.

Primarily as a result of funding policy changes at the American National Science Foundation around 2000, some researchers have begun to use the term biocomplexity in a narrower sense to denote the complex behavioral, biological, social, chemical, and physical interactions of living organisms with their environment. This relatively new subfield of biocomplexity encompasses other domains such as biodiversity and ecology.

<doc id="872941" wikidata="Q7774612" url="?curid=872941" title="The Whitlams">
<text>The Whitlams are an Australian Indie rock band formed in late 1992. The original line-up was Tim Freedman on keyboards and lead vocals, Andy Lewis on double bass and Stevie Plunder on guitar and lead vocals. Other than mainstay Freedman, the line-up has changed numerous times. From 2001 to 2022, he was joined by Warwick Hornby on bass guitar, Jak Housden on guitar and Terepai Richmond on drums – forming the band&#x27;s longest-lasting and best-known line-up. Four of their studio albums have reached the ARIA Albums Chart top 20: &quot;Eternal Nightcap&quot; (September 1997, No. 14), &quot;Love This City&quot; (November 1999, No. 3), &quot;Torch the Moon&quot; (July 2002, No. 1) and &quot;Little Cloud&quot; (March 2006, No. 4). Their highest charting singles are &quot;Blow Up the Pokies&quot; (May 2000) and &quot;Fall for You&quot; (June 2002) – both reached number 21. The group&#x27;s single, &quot;No Aphrodisiac&quot; was listed at number one on the Triple J Hottest 100, 1997 by listeners of national radio station, Triple J. In January 1996 Stevie Plunder was found dead at the base of Wentworth Falls. Andy Lewis died in February 2000.

==History==
===1992–1995: Formation and early years ===
Tim Freedman (ex-Penguin on Safari, Olive Branch) and Anthony Hayes a.k.a. Stevie Plunder (ex-the Plunderers, New Christs) met at the Big Day Out Sydney concert in January 1992. While missing Nirvana performing inside the arena, the two planned to form a group. The Whitlams were formed as a pop band by September that year, with Freedman on keyboards and lead vocals, Andy Lewis on double bass (also ex-The Plunderers, The Gadflys, Olive Branch) and Plunder on guitar. Freedman named the band after the former Prime Minister of Australia, Gough Whitlam, although Plunder had sought to call themselves, &#x27;The Three Nice Boys&#x27;. According to Freedman &quot;I loved the family names—the Smiths, the Reivers. I thought, the Whitlams, no-one&#x27;s done that. I&#x27;ll be able to steal all the goodwill that Australia holds in reserve for Gough Whitlam.&quot; Initially, without a drummer, the band developed their material acoustically at the Sandringham Hotel, Newtown. Australian music critic, Ed Nimmervoll, felt that they were &quot;a sideline band formed by two Sydney songwriters in search of a bit of extra action.&quot; In December 1992 they played a gig in Canberra supporting the Gadflys.

This line-up released their debut album, &quot;Introducing the Whitlams&quot;, in August 1993 on Black Yak/Phantom Records. The album was recorded in January and March 1993 at the Skyhigh Studios in Newcastle; for the recording sessions they used Louis Burdett and Nick Cecire on drums, with Rob Taylor producing. The album features a mix of original and cover songs, including tracks written by Justin Hayes a.k.a. Stanley Claret (Plunder&#x27;s brother). The album comprises three studio tracks, five live takes and two songs from their first demo, including a tribute song to the band&#x27;s namesake, &quot;Gough&quot;, which was written by Freedman. The lead single, &quot;Woody&quot;, detailed Woody Allen&#x27;s break up with Mia Farrow and was followed by their second single, &quot;Gough&quot;. Plunder described their sound to Naomi Mapstone of &quot;The Canberra Times&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;d been lots of rap and lots of thrash and that&#x27;s all very good, but we just have a different style of music and I think people appreciated hearing something a bit different [... it&#x27;s] sort of happy, sensitive, not that loud... much more acoustic.&quot; &quot;The Canberra Times&quot;″ reporter, Nicole Leedham felt it was &quot;sublime and ridiculous, the band&#x27;s bluesy, country, jazzy, punky, folky pop swings from bleeding sensitivity to drunken hilarity.&quot; Oz Music Project described the album as being &quot;very different to later recordings, with the band sounding a little bit country and a little bit rock and roll. A far cry from the lush orchestration of recent recordings.&quot;

Stuart Eadie (The Clouds, Olive Branch) became the band&#x27;s first permanent drummer. During 1993 to 1994 they performed over 300 shows along the Australian east coast. At first they travelled in Freedman&#x27;s Holden Kingswood station wagon before using a tour bus, which was used for the 1994 feature film, &quot;Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot;. The group recorded their second album, &quot;Undeniably the Whitlams&quot;, from April to May 1994 at the 48V Studio in Sydney, with Taylor and Freedman co-producing. The songwriting for the album was shared between Freedman and Plunder, with significant contributions by Lewis. It was released by Black Yak/Phantom in February 1995 and sold approximately 8,000 copies. Ahead of the album, in October 1994, they issued a single, &quot;Met My Match&quot;. Late that year Lewis had left to return to the Gadflys, with Mike Vidale brought in as his replacement. Their next single, &quot;I Make Hamburgers&quot;, was released in October 1995 and received airplay on national radio stations, including Triple J.

===1996–2000: &quot;Eternal Nightcap&quot; and &quot;Love This City&quot;===
The Whitlams&#x27; &quot;I Make Hamburgers&quot; was listed on the Triple J Hottest 100, 1996 on Australia Day (26 January). That same day, Stevie Plunder was found dead at the base of Wentworth Falls; according to Nimmervoll, he was &quot;either the victim of suicide, or of an accidental fall after a night out.&quot; The death of Plunder was the make it or break it moment for the band. After several months Freedman reformed the Whitlams with new members; another round of line-up changes occurred later in that year. In August 1996 they issued a nine-track live EP, &quot;Stupor Ego&quot;, with material recorded from performances at the Harbourside Brasserie in mid-1994 and at Goosens Hall on 30 July 1995 (part of national radio station Triple J&#x27;s &#x27;Real Appeal&#x27; broadcast), with the earlier three-piece line-up of Freedman, Lewis and Plunder.

The Whitlams recorded their third album, &quot;Eternal Nightcap&quot;, with Freedman and Taylor co-producing. Freedman &quot;chose musicians to fit each song, rather than have the same band through the whole album.&quot; The album was recorded on an extremely limited budget of $18,000. In a later interview Freedman reflects &quot;The band became a revolving door because I had no money to pay anyone. I actually made the album, &quot;Eternal Nightcap&quot;, during that most difficult period, that was a really tough year in which to keep my focus and keep my head up, but it ended in September 1997 when I put the record out and it just started selling itself.&quot; Jonathan Lewis of AllMusic described it as being &quot; full of gentle, well-crafted, piano-driven pop songs.&quot; Singles from the album include &quot;You Sound Like Louis Burdett&quot; (May 1997), &quot;Melbourne&quot; (January 1998) and &quot;No Aphrodisiac&quot; (February).

&quot;No Aphrodisiac&quot; was released independently by Freedman&#x27;s own label, had no film clip, no commercial radio airplay and no marketing budget however it reached the top 60 on the ARIA Singles Chart, and top 50 in New Zealand. &quot;No Aphrodisiac&quot; sold more than 80,000 copies and was listed at number one in the Triple J Hottest 100, 1997. The success of the single translated into sales of over 200,000 copies of the album, with it peaking at No. 14 on the ARIA Albums Chart in February 1998. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1998 The Whitlams won Best Independent Release (for &quot;Eternal Nightcap&quot;), Song of the Year (for &quot;No Aphrodisiac&quot;) and Best Group. The &#x27;Best Group&#x27; award was presented by Gough Whitlam, who announced the winners as &quot;It&#x27;s my family&quot;. At the conclusion of the ARIA Awards ceremony the Whitlams performed a cover of the Skyhooks&#x27; &quot;Women in Uniform&quot;, this was subsequently released in March 1999 as a limited edition single. In mid-1999 the group signed a distribution deal with Warner Music Australasia, and toured Canada.

The group&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Love This City&quot;, was released in November 1999, which peaked at No. 3 on the ARIA Albums Chart. It was recorded with the line-up of Freedman with Ben Fink on guitar, Bill Heckenberg on drums and Cottco Lovett on bass guitar, together with a large cast of guest musicians including Marcia Hines, Jackie Orszaczky, Chris Abrahams, Garry Gary Beers and members of Machine Gun Fellatio. The album had four producers: Freedman, Taylor, Daniel Denholm and Joe Hardy and was recorded in Sydney and Memphis (a reflection of the considerably larger budget that Freedman had to work with). The three singles from the album &quot;Thank You (For Loving Me at My Worst)&quot; (January 2000), &quot;Blow Up the Pokies&quot; (May) and &quot;Made Me Hard&quot; (September 2001) all charted in the top 100 singles charts in Australia. &quot;Blow Up the Pokies&quot; was their highest charting single – it peaked at No. 21.

AllMusic&#x27;s Jonathan Lewis compared &quot;Love This City&quot; to their previous album, &quot;this disc is less cohesive, covering a wide range of subject matter. The song style is different here, too, as Freedman allows his piano to take a back seat to guitars or brass on a number of tracks. The city of the title is Sydney, and many of these songs relate to its changing face.&quot; He described &quot;You Gotta Love This City&quot; as &quot;less-than-complimentary reaction to the commercialism of the Olympic Games&quot; and &quot;Blow Up the Pokies&quot; as detailing the &quot;infiltration of gambling machines into suburban bars and clubs.&quot; Nimmervoll described how the album &quot;was again recorded in a number of studios, with a changed line-up, leaning on the same and new songwriting collaborations. It couldn&#x27;t match the emotional charge that came with &quot;Eternal Nightcap&quot; but did enough to ensure The Whitlams&#x27; survival.&quot;

Former founding member, Andy Lewis committed suicide in Sydney in February 2000. A month after Lewis&#x27; death a benefit concert was held at the Metro club in Sydney to raise money for his wife and child. The event was hosted by Paul McDermott, Mikey Robins and Steve Abbott (The Sandman), and performers included Max Sharam, and The Gadflys. During the Whitlam&#x27;s Canadian tour in April, supporting Blue Rodeo, they received word that Lewis was dead. &quot;Blow Up the Pokies&quot; had been co-written by Freedman and Greta Gertler before Lewis&#x27; death – as a statement about the destruction in Lewis&#x27; life due to gambling. Freedman wrote &quot;The Curse Stops Here&quot; to describe being the &#x27;last one&#x27; of the original line-up and voicing his determination to survive. &quot;The Curse Stops Here&quot; was included as a B-side track on the single version of &quot;Blow Up the Pokies&quot;.

During the broadcast of the 2000 Sydney Olympics in September, the Whitlams&#x27; track, &quot;Sydney 2000 Olympic Theme&quot;, was played – it is a B-side from their 1995 single, &quot;I Make Hamburgers&quot;. The track was reworked as &quot;You Gotta Love This City&quot; on &quot;Love This City&quot;. Its choice for the Sydney Olympics is an irony, as the song&#x27;s protagonist commits suicide by jumping in the Harbour at the end of the song, disgusted at the city&#x27;s crass pursuit of money: &quot;It dawns on him / The horror / We got the Olympic Games&quot;.

===2001–2006: &quot;Torch the Moon&quot; and &quot;Little Cloud&quot;===
&quot;Torch the Moon&quot;, the Whitlams&#x27; fifth studio album, was released in July 2002, which debuted at No. 1. ARIA Reported that the group are &quot;one of the great underdog success stories of recent Aussie rock history, [they] have immortalized themselves, by becoming the latest Australian act to debut at # 1.&quot; For the album the line-up were Freedman with Warwick Hornby on bass guitar (ex-Max Sharam, Paul Mac), Jak Housden (ex-the Badloves) on guitar and Terepai Richmond (dig, Tina Arena) on drums. The producers were Denholm and Atomica. Clayton Bolger of AllMusic described the &quot;strong album from a promising lineup&quot; which &quot;only falls when the band significantly stray from their classic rock/pop sound.&quot;

It provided the singles &quot;Fall for You&quot; (June 2002, which became their equal highest single at No. 21), &quot;Best Work&quot; (September, No. 35), &quot;Royal in the Afternoon&quot; (July 2003, No. 66) and their cover version of Icehouse&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe Anymore&quot; (February, No. 47). Another track on the album, &quot;I Will not Go Quietly (Duffy&#x27;s Song)&quot;, had been written and performed by Freedman for the Australian TV series, &quot;Love Is a Four Letter Word&quot;, &quot;Episode 21: Oval&quot; (June 2001).

The band&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Little Cloud&quot; (consisting of two CDs: &quot;Little Cloud&quot; and &quot;The Apple&#x27;s Eye&quot;), was released on 19 March 2006 in Australia, which peaked at No. 4. Ian Hockley of Beyond the Pale website described the &quot;return to basics with few overdubs and often just a voice and piano base&quot; where the first disc &quot;deals with John Howard&#x27;s re-election and the bleak feelings that event engendered&quot; and the second one &quot;is more hopeful and life-affirming with bigger, more elaborate productions.&quot; Several tracks received considerable airplay, including &quot;I Was Alive&quot;. Three of the songs on the album have been released as radio-only singles, with a fourth, &quot;Beautiful as You&quot;, released as a CD single.

The album was followed up with almost non-stop touring around Australia, including performances at political and university events. Freedman released &quot;Little Cloud&quot; outside Australia under his own name. The band made the news in September 2006 when, for political reasons, Freedman refused to perform to troops in Iraq, he told Peter Holmes of &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, &quot;I was asked, and decided not to go. ... I went to East Timor and enjoyed the experience. I understand how hard the soldiers do it. In this instance, I don&#x27;t agree with the war.&quot;

===2007–2010: Sydney Symphony to &quot;Truth, Beauty and a Picture of You&quot;===

The Whitlams performed an orchestral tour from September to November 2007, performing shows with the Sydney Symphony, the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra, the West Australian Symphony Orchestra and The Queensland Orchestra. In mid-2008 they gave away 700,000 copies of &quot;The Whitlams &amp; The Sydney Symphony Live in Concert&quot;, as a free CD with various newspapers: &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; (1 June), &quot;The Australian&quot; (26 July) and &quot;The Mercury&quot;. It contains material from their four live performances with the Sydney Symphony at the Sydney Opera House in the previous September.

The Whitlams released a compilation album, &quot;Truth, Beauty and a Picture of You&quot; in August 2008, which peaked at No. 3. As part of it promotion the group performed on TV programs including Nine&#x27;s &quot;Footy Show&quot; (NRL), Seven&#x27;s &quot;Sunrise&quot; and &quot;The Morning Show&quot;. The Whitlams performed with the Sydney Symphony in 2009 to celebrate the 12th anniversary of the release of their breakthrough album, &quot;Eternal Nightcap&quot;.

===2011–2016: &quot;Australian Idle&quot;===
From 2011 to 2013 the Whitlams were on hiatus. On 11 November 2011 (the anniversary of Gough Whitlam&#x27;s dismissal), Freedman released a solo album, &quot;Australian Idle&quot;, which featured his new backing band The Idle. The line-up was Heath Cullen on guitar, Zoe Hauptmann on bass guitar, Dave Hibbard on drums and Amy Vee on guitar and keyboards. The Whitlams reunited in 2013, with a performance schedule reduced to around four weeks each year. They performed an outdoor concert with West Australian artist, Jason Ayres, in March 2015 at the Mundaring Weir Hotel

===2017–present: Anniversary tours, &quot;Sancho&quot;, Hornby&#x27;s departure and &quot;Kookaburra&quot;===
To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the band, the Whitlams performed six shows with the symphony orchestras of each capital city in Australia for an Anniversary tour. Taking place in April and May 2017, the tour visited Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, Canberra and Adelaide. In each city, they were backed by a 50-piece orchestra using performers from each city. Tim Freedman said that &quot;It is an honour to play with these musicians who in some cases have been playing their instruments since they were in the womb.&quot;

In 2020, the band released their first new song in almost 15 years, &quot;Ballad of Bertie Kidd&quot;. The six-minute song was written from the perspective of a would-be criminal, enlisted by Kidd for an art gallery heist in Gosford. The single was later revealed to be the lead single from the band&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;Sancho&quot;, which was released on 28 January 2022. A further four singles were released from the album: &quot;Man About a Dog&quot;, &quot;(You&#x27;re Making Me Feel Like I&#x27;m) 50 Again&quot;, &quot;Cambridge Three&quot; and &quot;Nobody Knows I Love You&quot;.

In April 2022, Freedman launched a country music off-shoot of the band, billed as The Whitlams Black Stump Band. The band is composed of Freedman, Richmond, banjo player Rod McCormack, pedal steel player Ollie Thorpe and bassist Matt Fell. Freedman began the project after discovering that &quot;Man About a Dog&quot; had been added to country radio. A new version of &quot;No Aphrodisiac&quot; by the Black Stump Band was released in July.

In June 2022, the band announced a 25th anniversary tour for &quot;Eternal Nightcap&quot;. With the announcement came the band&#x27;s first line-up change since 2001: the departure of bassist Warwick Hornby, who was replaced by &quot;Sancho&quot; session bassist Ian Peres. In a statement shared to the band&#x27;s social media, Freedman confirmed that Hornby had retired:

In May 2023, the band announced a national tour for October that saw them focus on the early years of The Whitlams&#x27; material, between 1993 and 1997. To replicate the sound of these albums, the band was joined by double bassist Scott Owen of The Living End.

In February 2024, it was announced that The Whitlams Black Stump Band had changed its name to The Whitlams Black Stump, and would release the album &quot;Kookaburra&quot; in March 2024.

<text>Minchinhampton is a Cotswolds market town and a civil parish in the Stroud District of Gloucestershire, South West England. The town is located on a hilltop, south-east of Stroud. The common offers wide views over the Severn Estuary into Wales and further into the Cotswolds. It is an ancient town which was recorded in the Domesday Book.

==Toponymy==
The place-name &#x27;Minchinhampton&#x27; is first attested as &quot;Hantone&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086. It appears as &quot;Minchenhamtone&quot; in the Assize Rolls of 1221. The name was originally the Old English &quot;Heatun&quot;, meaning &quot;high town or settlement&quot;. The additional element is the Old English &quot;mynecen&quot;, meaning a nun, which is related to the modern word &quot;monk&quot;. Minchinhampton at one time belonged to the nunnery in Caen in Normandy, France. Thus the name means &quot;the nuns&#x27; high town or settlement&quot;. On a map of 1825 (published 1828) the town is labelled &quot;Minching-Hampton&quot; (see external links).

==Amenities and features==

The main square has a war memorial, and a 17th-century Market House, given to the town in 1919 by the Lord of the Manor, Lt Col. H. G. Ricardo, and restored in 1944.

A market is held on the first Saturday of each month. There is a twice-yearly craft fair at Gatcombe and an annual summer visit by Gifford&#x27;s Circus. Minchinhampton Country Fayre is held every other year in the High Street.

The small high street includes Henry&#x27;s Dairy, The Amalfi coffee shop (previously &#x27;The Kitchen&#x27;), The Crown Pub and Restaurant and a corner shop. There is also a post office, and Boots pharmacy. The Crown building dates back to 1715, where it was used for public meetings and assemblies before it became a beer house.

== History ==
Across the town, many plaques displaying &#x27;West Country Ales- Best in the West- 1760&#x27; are situated on the walls of buildings. These were given to pubs at the time in relation to Stroud Brewery. In 1958, Stroud &amp; Cheltenham Breweries merged to form West Country Breweries Ltd, and the plaques were replaced to say &#x27;West Country Ales&#x27;. The 1760 date shown is in relation to the year that both Stroud Brewery and Cheltenham Brewery were established. These plaques can be seen outside The Crown, Market Place, Ram Inn (pub now closed), Swan Inn at West End (pub now closed), Trumpet Inn at West End (pub now closed).

==Sports facilities==
===Horse trials===
Minchinhampton is near to the main home of the Princess Royal, Gatcombe Park, which hosts the Gatcombe Horse Trials in late summer each year.

===Rugby===

The rugby club has three adult teams, minis and juniors from under 6 to under 16, and a large touch-rugby section. Minchinhampton RFC plays in the league Gloucester 2 North. In 2014, the club&#x27;s players were joined by Gatcombe Park resident Mike Tindall, a 2003 Rugby World Cup winner and ex-England and Gloucester RFC rugby international married to Zara Phillips, the daughter of the Princess Royal.

===Golf===
Minchinhampton Golf Club has three courses. The Cherington and Avening courses lie near villages of the same names, south-east of Minchinhampton. The Old Course is on Minchinhampton Common.

=== Football ===
The Minchinhampton Rangers are a Youth Football Club for boys and girls, aged 5 to 17. It was founded in 1998 and have over 300 registered players.

===Tennis===
The Minchinhampton Tennis Club is situated on the Stuart Playing Fields in Minchinhampton. The Team often competes in regional/national events.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Mendip TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Gloucestershire, Heart West and Greatest Hits Radio South West. The town is served by the local newspapers: &quot;Stroud News &amp; Journal&quot; and &quot;Gloucester Citizen&quot;.

==Governance==
The Minchinhampton electoral ward stretches eastwards to Aston Down. It had a population of 4,357 according to the 2011 census. The town is twinned with Nkokoto, Tanzania.

In the 2024 General Election, Minchinhampton was part of the North Cotswolds Constituency.

==Churches==

Minchinhampton has two places of worship: the Anglican parish church, Holy Trinity, and Minchinhampton Baptist Church.

The spire of the parish church was pulled down for safety reasons in 1563, after the nave arches supporting it were found to be failing. The stub was then surmounted by a coronet structure. James Bradley, the third Astronomer Royal, was buried in the churchyard in 1762.

Minchinhampton Baptist Church in Tetbury Street dates from 1834. The original Chapel Lane Baptist chapel, dating from 1765, is now a private house.

==Minchinhampton Common==

Minchinhampton Common is a common used by walkers and golfers, and is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. It has been owned by the National Trust since 1913, but only managed by it since 2000. It has long, parallel ditches and mounds known as the Bulwarks, which formed part of a large Iron Age fort. There are wide views from the Common, west over the Severn estuary into Wales, and east to the Golden Valley and further into the Cotswolds.

The limestone Longstone of Minchinhampton is supposedly the burial site of a Danish leader. As a standing stone it more probably dates back to the Bronze Age.

The Common is also well known in the local area for its cows and wild horses, which use the land to graze from May to October. These animals are also free to roam the town itself, often resulting in traffic and tourists.

==Aston Down==

Minchinhampton is close to the former Royal Air Force airfield, Aston Down, formerly a major employer, but now closed and used only for gliding. In 2005, after a Freedom of Information request, the local newspaper revealed that Aston Down is contaminated with arsenic, hydrocarbons and radium. Since the site lies above a vulnerable aquifer, local residents have formed an Aston Down Action Group aimed at persuading local and central government agencies to implement more stringent safety regulations.

==Discoveries==

One of the world&#x27;s oldest tyrannosaurs, &quot;Proceratosaurus&quot;, was excavated from Minchinhampton reservoir. The only known example of it is now in the Natural History Museum, London.

<doc id="872956" wikidata="Q318317" url="?curid=872956" title="Columella">
<text>Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella (, Arabic: ) was a prominent Roman writer on agriculture in the Roman Empire.

His in twelve volumes has been completely preserved and forms an important source on Roman agriculture and cuisine, together with the works of Cato the Elder and Marcus Terentius Varro, both of which he occasionally cites. A smaller book on trees, , is usually attributed to him.

In 1794 the Spanish botanists José Antonio Pavón Jiménez and Hipólito Ruiz López named a genus of Peruvian asterid &quot;Columellia&quot; in his honour.

==Life==
Little is known of Columella&#x27;s life. He was probably born in Gades, Hispania Baetica (modern Cádiz), possibly to Roman parents. After a career in the army (he was tribune in Syria in 35 AD), he turned to farming his estates at Ardea, Carseoli, and Alba in Latium.

==Works==

===&quot;De re rustica&quot;===
In ancient times, Columella&#x27;s work &quot;appears to have been but little read&quot;, cited only by Pliny the Elder, Servius, Cassiodorus, and Isidorus, and having fallen &quot;into almost complete neglect&quot; after Palladius published an abridgement of it.

This book is presented as advice to a certain Publius Silvinus. Previously known only in fragments, the complete book was among those discovered in monastery libraries in Switzerland and France by Poggio Bracciolini and his assistant Bartolomeo di Montepulciano during the Council of Constance, between 1414 and 1418.

Structure of (&quot;On Agriculture&quot;):
*soils
*viticulture
*fruits
*olive trees
*big animals: cattle, horses and mules
*small animals: asses, sheep, goats, pigs, dogs , such as his canine companion named Paco
*fish and fowl: chickens, doves, thrushes, peacocks, Numidian chicken and guineafowl, geese, ducks, fish ponds
*wild animals: enclosures for wild animals, beekeeping, production of honey and wax
*gardens
*personnel management
*calendars
*household management

Book 10 is written entirely in dactylic hexameter verse, in imitation of, or homage to, Virgil. It may initially have been intended to be the concluding volume, books 11 and 12 being perhaps an addition to the original scheme.

A complete, but anonymous, translation into English was published by Andrew Millar in 1745. Excerpts had previously been translated by Richard Bradley.

===&quot;De arboribus&quot;===

The short work &#x27;, &quot;On Trees&quot;, is in manuscripts and early editions of Columella considered as book 3 of &#x27;. However, it is clear from the opening sentences that it is part of a separate and possibly earlier work. As the anonymous translator of the Millar edition notes, in &#x27; there is no mention of the Publius Silvinus to whom the &#x27; is addressed. A recent critical edition of the Latin text of the &#x27; includes it, but as &#x27;, by an unknown hand. Cassiodorus mentions sixteen books of Columella, which has led to the suggestion that &quot;&quot; formed part of a work in four volumes.

===Sources===
In addition to Cato the Elder and Varro, Columella used many sources that are no longer extant and for which he is one of the few references. These include works by Aulus Cornelius Celsus, the Carthaginian writer Mago, Tremellius Scrofa, and many Greek sources. His uncle Marcus Columella, &quot;a clever man and an exceptional farmer&quot; (VII.2.30), had conducted experiments in sheep breeding, crossing colourful wild rams, introduced from Africa for gladiatorial games, with domestic sheep, and may have influenced his nephew&#x27;s interests. Columella owned farms in Italy; he refers specifically to estates at Ardea, Carseoli, and Alba, and speaks repeatedly of his own practical experience in agriculture.

===Editions===
The earliest editions of Columella group his works with those on agriculture of Cato the Elder, Varro and Palladius. Some modern library catalogues follow Brunet in listing these under &quot; or &quot;.

<text>Duncan William Ferguson Lamont (17 June 1918 – 19 December 1978) was a British actor. Born in Lisbon, Portugal, and brought up in Scotland, he had a long and successful career in film and television, appearing in a variety of high-profile productions.
==Career==

He trained as an actor at RADA in London, and had a considerable amount of stage experience before the Second World War. He acted in repertory, and at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon. During the War he served as a sergeant pilot in the Glider Pilot Regiment of the British airborne forces. He resumed acting after the War, and entered films in the early 1950s.

On film, he appeared in &quot;The Man in the White Suit&quot; (1951, as Harry), &quot;The Adventures of Quentin Durward&quot; (1955, as the villain De La Marck), &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; (1959, as Kennedy), &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959, as Marius, an associate of Messala), &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1962, as John Williams), &quot;Arabesque&quot; (1966, as Kyle Webster) and &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; (1969, as Flight Sergeant Arthur). Lamont is particularly memorable in his role as the wry, urbane Viceroy in Jean Renoir&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Coach&quot; (1952).

From 1958 to 1960, Lamont was a semi-regular as David MacMorris in the CBS western television series, &quot;The Texan&quot;, starring Rory Calhoun.

Lamont also appeared in guest roles in a range of popular British programmes from the 1950s to the 1970s, including &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;, &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;, &quot;Danger Man&quot;, &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;Callan&quot;, &quot;Secret Army, Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)&quot;, &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

In 1953, he appeared in the major role of astronaut Victor Carroon in Nigel Kneale&#x27;s ground-breaking BBC science-fiction serial &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;, and fourteen years later returned to the series when he played the role of Sladden in the Hammer Films version of the third serial, &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;.

He died in 1978 in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, of a heart attack at the age of 60. He was working at the time on &quot;Hostage&quot;, an episode of the BBC science-fiction series &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;. Although he had completed location work for the episode, he died before the studio scenes had been shot, necessitating a re-mount of the location material performed by his replacement John Abineri.

He was married to the Irish actress Patricia Driscoll until his death in 1978. They had two children together.

<text>The Battle of Bordeaux (, , ) is an informal name for the World Cup football match between Brazil and Czechoslovakia on 12 June 1938 in the Parc Lescure in Bordeaux, France, one of the quarter-finals of the 1938 World Cup finals. The match had a series of brutal fouls by both sides, due to the lax officiating of Hungarian referee Pál von Hertzka.

==Overview==
At the match, which also opened the rebuilt Stade du Parc Lescure, Brazil took the lead 1–0, with Czechoslovakia equalizing on a penalty kick for ball handling by Domingos da Guia. The Brazilian Zezé Procópio was sent off after fourteen minutes. The Brazilian Arthur Machado and the Czechoslovak Jan Říha were sent off just before full time. It was the first time that three players were sent off in a World Cup match, a record that was equaled at the Battle of Berne 1954 between Hungary and Brazil, and exceeded at the 2006 World Cup match between Portugal and Netherlands. Captain František Plánička and Oldřich Nejedlý from Czechoslovakia suffered a broken right arm and right leg respectively in the mayhem. Their teammate Josef Košťálek was injured in the stomach. 

The match was drawn 1–1 after 90 minutes of full-time, and a 30-minute extra time had to be played. Nejedlý had abandoned the game before the end of regulation time due to his injury, but Plánička stayed at the Czechoslovak goal in pain through the rest of the second half and the extra time. Three other Brazilians, including Leônidas and Perácio, also left the field with injuries.

The match eventually ended 1–1 after extra time, and had to be replayed 2 days later, with both teams having to field several reserves. Brazil won the replay 2–1, eliminating Czechoslovakia and advancing to semifinals, where they faced eventual champions Italy.

<doc id="872972" wikidata="Q7355990" url="?curid=872972" title="Rocky River (Tennessee)">
<text>The Rocky River is a stream in the east-central portion of Middle Tennessee in the United States. It is a tributary of the Caney Fork River, and is part of the Cumberland, Ohio and Mississippi watersheds. The lower portion of the river is part of the reservoir created by Great Falls Dam, which is located near the river&#x27;s confluence with the Caney Fork.

==Course==
The Rocky River rises on the slopes of Jakes Mountain, a summit north of the Cagle community atop the Cumberland Plateau in Sequatchie County. Just below its source, the stream enters its Studer Lake impoundment as it flows northward through a rugged area of abandoned surface mines. Beyond this lake, the river crosses into Van Buren County, where it continues northward through rugged hills.

After passing the historic &quot;Rocky River Crossing&quot; (once part of the Trail of Tears) along Pleasant Hill Cemetery Road, the river begins its descent to the Highland Rim, losing 900 feet in elevation in less than four miles before steadying in the White Hill area. Flanked by the walls of the Cumberland Plateau and Barnett Mountain, the river continues northward through the Riverview and Laurelburg communities. At the latter, the river veers westward toward Warren County, then again turns northward, forming the boundary between Warren and Van Buren for the remainder of its course.

Just before reaching the Goodbars community, the river passes under State Highway 30 (Spencer Road). Beyond Goodbars, the river flows through a series of oxbow bends, one of which nearly forms a meander cutoff. After passing under Bone Cave Road and U.S. Highway 70, the river flows just east of the Rock Island community as it enters the slack waters of Great Falls Lake. The river empties into the Caney Fork about a mile upstream from Great Falls Dam. Its confluence with the Caney Fork marks a three-way junction between Warren, Van Buren, and White counties.

==Watershed==
The drainage area of the Rocky River covers 111 square miles. The Tennessee Valley Divide, which separates the Cumberland and Tennessee watersheds, crosses Jakes Mountain a few hundred yards south of the source of the Rocky River. Streams on the north side of the mountain flow into the Rocky, while streams on the south side are part of the Sequatchie River watershed. A string of ridges extending from the Cumberland Plateau, among them Long Mountain and Barnett Mountain, split the watershed of the Rocky from the watershed of the Collins River to the west.

Important tributaries of the Rocky include Harper Branch, Sycamore Branch, and Dyer Gulch Creek, which flow into the river from the west, and Samples Fork, Rocky Branch, and Pine Branch, which join the river from the east. Laurel Creek, which empties into the river&#x27;s eastern bank just downstream from Goodbars, drains part of the town of Spencer.

==History==
Rock Island, a small island at the confluence of the Rocky River and Caney Fork, was an important early landmark and river ford for settlers in the eastern Highland Rim region. Two Indian trails, the Chickamauga Trail (later the Old Kentucky Road) and the Black Fox Trail, intersected near the island. Historian J. G. M. Ramsey reports a battle taking place at the island in 1793, near the end of the Cherokee–American wars.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, Higgenbotham&#x27;s Trace (or Rainey&#x27;s Turnpike), a major road connecting McMinnville with the Sequatchie Valley, crossed the Rocky River near Pleasant Hill Cemetery, just north of Van Buren-Sequatchie county line. In 1838, the northern route of the Trail of Tears, the path over which the Cherokee were removed from the eastern mountains to Oklahoma, followed this road. While the procession camped at the Rocky River, the Cherokee leader Junaluska and several supporters deserted and attempted to return to the east. They were eventually arrested and incarcerated. The Rocky River Crossing and the adjacent roadbed, which look much as they did 170 years ago, have since been added to the National Register of Historic Places.

Historian Arthur Weir Crouch reported several early fords along the Rocky River, most notably Brights Ford at the river&#x27;s Laurel Creek confluence, and Hash Ford, or Indian Ford, near its mouth. A wooden bridge was built at the latter ford in the mid-19th century, but was destroyed by a flood in 1872. As part of its Great Falls Dam project, the Tennessee Electric Power Company built the Yost Bridge about a mile above the river&#x27;s mouth in 1915, and the Blanks Bridge about three miles above the river&#x27;s mouth in 1916. A bridge for Tennessee Highway 30 was built in the early 1920s.

==Ecology and habitat improvement==
Siltation from surface mining conducted in the upper Rocky River basin during the early and mid-20th century damaged several sections of the river, and threatened two federally-listed species that live in the river, the bluemask darter and the slender chub. Restoration efforts have focused on the erection of livestock exclusion fences to create a reforested riparian zone along the river, and backfilling and revegetating abandoned surface mines.

<text>Cornwallis Island is one of the Queen Elizabeth Islands, part of the Arctic Archipelago, in the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut in the Canadian Arctic. It lies to the west of Devon Island, the largest uninhabited island in the world, and at its greatest length is about . At in size, it is the 96th largest island in the world, and Canada&#x27;s 21st largest island. Cornwallis Island is separated by the Wellington Channel from Devon Island, and by the Parry Channel from Somerset Island to the south. Northwest of Cornwallis Island lies Little Cornwallis Island, the biggest of a group of small islands at the north end of McDougall Sound, which separates Cornwallis Island from nearby Bathurst Island.

Cape Airy is located at the island&#x27;s southwestern extremity. Also on the southwestern coast, Griffith Island lies directly across from the island&#x27;s only hamlet, Resolute (Qausuittuq), separated by the wide Resolute Passage.

The first European to visit Cornwallis Island was the British Arctic explorer and naval officer Sir William Edward Parry in 1819. The island is named for Royal Navy admiral Sir William Cornwallis.

Cornwallis Island is also home to microbiological colonies known as hypoliths, from their tendency to take hold under (&quot;hypo&quot;) stones (&quot;lith&quot;).

Several sites on Cornwallis Island including Char Lake and Meretta Lake were key research locations in the International Biological Program and proved foundational to the development of high-latitude limnology.

==Demographics==
Resolute is Canada&#x27;s second most northerly public community, after Grise Fiord, and has a population of 183 in 2021. Resolute Bay Airport acts as a transportation hub for the central islands of the high Arctic of Nunavut.

==Climate==

The island has a polar arctic climate (ET) with long cold winters and short cool summers. Resolute, which lies on the south coast of the island, has an annual average temperature of , with an average high for the year of and the average low for the year is . Resolute has a very dry climate with an average precipitation of a year, most of it falling as snow from September to November. The record high for Resolute is on July 2, 2012 and the record low for Resolute is on January 7, 1966.

Resolute has never experienced an above-freezing temperature between October 20 and May 6.

Between around April 30 and August 13, Resolute experiences midnight sun; whilst between around November 7 and February 4 there is polar night. Between late November and mid-January, the sun is so low that there is not even civil twilight, with the only exception from complete darkness being a deeper-blue sky called &quot;nautical twilight&quot; at noon, but there is no true experience of 24 hours of pitch black darkness around noon. For about two weeks before and after the midnight sun in Resolute, the nights are still quite bright since it does not get any darker than civil twilight (this is the twilight where surrounding objects are still visible and outdoor activities can go on without the need for artificial lighting). Resolute, however, does not experience night (the phase of day) from about March 14 to September 29.

Resolute does experience thunderstorms during the summer, but they are typically rare in the region.

<text>Sir David Geoffrey Manning, (born 5 December 1949) is a former British diplomat, who was the British Ambassador to the United States from 2003 to 2007. He authored the so-called &quot;Manning Memo&quot;, that summarized the details of a meeting between American president George W. Bush and British prime minister Tony Blair during the run-up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Until 2019, he was appointed to the Household of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.

==Life and career==

Manning was educated at Ardingly College and went on to study at Oriel College, Oxford, and at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies of the Johns Hopkins University. He began his career as a civil servant in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in 1972. He has served in UK Embassies in Warsaw, New Delhi, Paris, and Moscow, and within the FCO he has worked on the Central American desk, the Russian desk and held several senior positions. He has represented the UK in Brussels and also at the International Conference on the former Yugoslavia in 1994.

Between 1995 and 1998, he was British Ambassador to Israel; from 2001, he was a foreign policy adviser to British prime minister Tony Blair. During this time he developed a close relationship with his counterpart, then US National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice. Blair selected him to replace Christopher Meyer as the British Ambassador to the United States. Manning took up the post in 2003. Ambassador Manning visited numerous states, as well as the US territory of Puerto Rico, during his term as Ambassador to the United States and was instrumental in planning Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s most recent visit.

===2003 Iraq War===
In the weeks before the United States-led invasion of Iraq, as the United States and Britain pressed for a second United Nations resolution condemning Iraq, President Bush met with Tony Blair. During a private two-hour meeting in the Oval Office on 31 January 2003, Bush made it clear to Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain that he, Bush, was determined to invade Iraq without the second resolution, or even if international arms inspectors failed to find unconventional weapons, stated a confidential memo about the meeting written by Manning and reviewed by &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

At their meeting, Bush and Blair candidly expressed their doubts that chemical, biological or nuclear weapons would be found in Iraq in the coming weeks, the memo said. The president spoke as if an invasion was unavoidable. The two leaders discussed a timetable for the war, details of the military campaign and plans for the aftermath of the war.
The memo also says the president raised three possible ways of provoking a confrontation, including the most controversial:

&quot;The U.S. was thinking of flying U2 reconnaissance aircraft with fighter cover over Iraq, painted in U.N. colours,&quot; the memo says, attributing the idea to Mr. Bush. &quot;If Saddam fired on them, he would be in breach&quot;.

His close relationship with the Prime Minister suggests he has been a key figure in driving British foreign policy in respect of the United States, particularly in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks and the decision to invade Iraq.

On 30 November 2009, Manning gave evidence to The Iraq Inquiry.

===Later life===
He was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in the 2008 New Year Honours. Manning retired from Her Majesty&#x27;s Diplomatic Service in January 2008. Six months later, he joined BG Group (formerly British Gas plc) on a part-time basis at a reported annual salary of £80,000. In 2008 he became a non-executive director of Lockheed Martin and joined the advisory board of Hakluyt &amp; Company, an intelligence company partly staffed by former SIS officers.

At the beginning of 2009, Manning was appointed by the Queen to a &quot;part-time, advisory role&quot; in the newly formed household of Prince William and Prince Harry.

Manning has been elected to the Council of Lloyd&#x27;s as an external member.

In 2010 Manning formed Gatehouse Advisory Partners Limited in partnership with Sir Jeremy Greenstock. Gatehouse works with organisations to factor geopolitics into their decision making.

He was appointed Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in the 2015 New Year Honours.

<doc id="872991" wikidata="Q371948" url="?curid=872991" title="Serge Lang">
<text>Serge Lang (; May 19, 1927 – September 12, 2005) was a French-American mathematician and activist who taught at Yale University for most of his career. He is known for his work in number theory and for his mathematics textbooks, including the influential &quot;Algebra&quot;. He received the Frank Nelson Cole Prize in 1960 and was a member of the Bourbaki group.

As an activist, Lang campaigned against the Vietnam War, and also successfully fought against the nomination of the political scientist Samuel P. Huntington to the National Academies of Science. Later in his life, Lang was an HIV/AIDS denialist. He claimed that HIV had not been proven to cause AIDS and protested Yale&#x27;s research into HIV/AIDS.

==Early life==
Lang was born in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, close to Paris, in 1927. He had a twin brother who became a basketball coach and a sister who became an actress. Lang moved with his family to California as a teenager, where he graduated in 1943 from Beverly Hills High School. After completing his undergraduate education at the California Institute of Technology in 1946, he received a PhD in mathematics from Princeton University in 1951. He held faculty positions at the University of Chicago, Columbia University (from 1955, leaving in 1971 in a dispute), and Yale University.

Lang studied at Princeton University, writing his thesis titled &quot;On quasi algebraic closure&quot; under the supervision of Emil Artin, and then worked on the geometric analogues of class field theory and diophantine geometry. Later he moved into diophantine approximation and transcendental number theory, proving the Schneider–Lang theorem. A break in research while he was involved in trying to meet 1960s student activism halfway caused him (by his own description) difficulties in picking up the threads afterwards. He wrote on modular forms and modular units, the idea of a &quot;distribution&quot; on a profinite group, and value distribution theory. He made a number of conjectures in diophantine geometry: Mordell–Lang conjecture, Bombieri–Lang conjecture, Lang–Trotter conjecture, and the Lang conjecture on analytically hyperbolic varieties. He introduced the Lang map, the Katz–Lang finiteness theorem, and the Lang–Steinberg theorem (cf. Lang&#x27;s theorem) in algebraic groups.

==Mathematical books==
Lang was a prolific writer of mathematical texts, often completing one on his summer vacation. Most are at the graduate level. He wrote calculus texts and also prepared a book on group cohomology for Bourbaki. Lang&#x27;s &quot;Algebra&quot;, a graduate-level introduction to algebra, was a highly influential text that ran through numerous updated editions. His Steele prize citation stated, &quot;Lang&#x27;s &quot;Algebra&quot; changed the way graduate algebra is taught...It has affected all subsequent graduate-level algebra books.&quot; It contained ideas of his teacher, Artin; some of the most interesting passages in &quot;Algebraic Number Theory&quot; also reflect Artin&#x27;s influence and ideas that might otherwise not have been published in that or any form.

==Awards as expositor==

Lang was noted for his eagerness for contact with students. He was described as a passionate teacher who would throw chalk at students who he believed were not paying attention. One of his colleagues recalled: &quot;He would rant and rave in front of his students. He would say, &#x27;Our two aims are truth and clarity, and to achieve these I will shout in class.&#x27;&quot; He won a Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition (1999) from the American Mathematical Society. In 1960, he won the sixth Frank Nelson Cole Prize in Algebra for his paper &quot;Unramified class field theory over function fields in several variables&quot; (&quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot;, Series 2, volume 64 (1956), pp. 285–325).

==Activism==

Lang spent much of his professional time engaged in political activism. He was a staunch socialist and active in opposition to the Vietnam War, volunteering for the 1966 anti-war campaign of Robert Scheer (the subject of his book &quot;The Scheer Campaign&quot;). Lang later quit his position at Columbia in 1971 in protest over the university&#x27;s treatment of anti-war protesters.

Lang engaged in several efforts to challenge anyone he believed was spreading misinformation or misusing science or mathematics to further their own goals. He attacked the 1977 Survey of the American Professoriate, an opinion questionnaire that Seymour Martin Lipset and E. C. Ladd had sent to thousands of college professors in the United States. Lang said it contained numerous biased and loaded questions. This led to a public and highly acrimonious conflict as detailed in his book &quot;The File : Case Study in Correction (1977-1979)&quot;.

In 1986, Lang mounted what the &quot;New York Times&quot; described as a &quot;one-man challenge&quot; against the nomination of political scientist Samuel P. Huntington to the National Academy of Sciences. Lang described Huntington&#x27;s research, in particular his use of mathematical equations to demonstrate that South Africa was a &quot;satisfied society&quot;, as &quot;pseudoscience&quot;, arguing that it gave &quot;the illusion of science without any of its substance.&quot; Despite support for Huntington from the Academy&#x27;s social and behavioral scientists, Lang&#x27;s challenge was successful, and Huntington was twice rejected for Academy membership. Huntington&#x27;s supporters argued that Lang&#x27;s opposition was political rather than scientific in nature. Lang&#x27;s detailed description of these events, &quot;Academia, Journalism, and Politics: A Case Study: The Huntington Case&quot;, occupies the first 222 pages of his 1998 book &quot;Challenges&quot;.

Lang kept his political correspondence and related documentation in extensive &quot;files&quot;. He would send letters or publish articles, wait for responses, engage the writers in further correspondence, collect all these writings together and point out what he considered contradictions. He often mailed these files to mathematicians and other interested parties throughout the world. Some of the files were published in his books &quot;Challenges&quot; and &quot;The File : Case Study in Correction (1977-1979)&quot;. His extensive file criticizing Nobel laureate David Baltimore was published in the journal &quot;Ethics and Behaviour&quot; in January 1993 and in his book &quot;Challenges&quot;. Lang fought the decision by Yale University to hire Daniel Kevles, a historian of science, because Lang disagreed with Kevles&#x27; analysis in &quot;The Baltimore Case&quot;.

In the last twelve years of his life, Lang challenged the scientific consensus on the connection between HIV and AIDS. He argued that existing data did not support the conclusion that HIV causes AIDS. A portion of &quot;Challenges&quot; is devoted to this issue.

<text>Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger (19 November 1775 – 10 May 1813) was a German entomologist and zoologist. He founded the entomological periodical &quot;Magazin für Insektenkunde.&quot; The plant genus &quot;Illigera&quot; is named in his honour.

== Biography ==
Illiger was the son of a merchant in Braunschweig. He studied under the entomologist Johann Hellwig, and later worked on the zoological collections of Johann Centurius Hoffmannsegg. He was educated at the University of Helmstedt and at Gottingen. He was unable to pursue medical studies due to tuberculosis. Illiger was invited to Berlin by Alexander von Humboldt and he became professor and director of the &quot;zoological museum&quot; (which is the Natural History Museum of Berlin in the present day) from its formation in 1810 until his death three years later from tuberculosis.
He was the author of &quot;Prodromus systematis mammalium et avium&quot; (1811), which was an overhaul of the Linnaean system. It was a major influence on the adoption of the concept of the family. He also edited the &quot;Magazin für Insektenkunde&quot;, widely known as &quot;Illiger&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. This journal would lead him to receive an honorary doctorate from the University of Kiel in 1806.

In 1811 he introduced the taxonomic order Proboscidea for elephants, the American mastodon and the woolly mammoth. He also described the subspecies &quot;Odobenus rosmarus divergens&quot;, commonly known as the Pacific walrus. He created the order Sirenia based on his opinion that the manatee appeared like a mermaid. Illiger&#x27;s macaw (&quot;Primolius maracana&quot;; ) and Illiger&#x27;s saddle-back tamarin (&quot;Leontocebus illigeri&quot; ) commemorate his name. The botanical genus &quot;Illigera&quot; (family Hernandiaceae) also bears his name.

<text>The Northern Ireland Labour Party (NILP) was a political party in Northern Ireland which operated from 1924 until 1987.

== Origins ==
The roots of the NILP can be traced back to the formation of the Belfast Labour Party in 1892. Previously, in 1885, Alexander Bowman had stood in North Belfast as an independent labour candidate, supported by the Belfast Trades Council. 

Six Labour candidates were elected to Belfast Corporation in 1897 – the first Labour councillors in Ireland. There continued to be Labour representation on Belfast Corporation up to the 1911 elections when no Labour candidates were returned. The 1920 elections to Belfast Corporation, held in the aftermath of a mass strike wave that gripped Belfast in 1919, saw Labour return with 12 seats after winning over 14% of the vote.

William Walker stood as the Labour candidate in the Belfast North by-election in 1905 coming a close second with 47% of the vote. 

When the British Labour Party decided not to contest the 1921 elections to the first Northern Ireland Parliament, local party activists independently stood Belfast Labour candidates.

== After partition ==
After the partition of Ireland in 1921, the NILP was founded as a socialist political party by groups such as the Belfast Labour Party and found its main bed of support amongst working class voters in Belfast. Over 40 delegates attended the founding conference of the Labour Party of Northern Ireland held on 8 March 1924. It initially declined to take a position on the &quot;Border Question&quot; and instead sought to offer itself as an alternative to both nationalism and unionism.

In the 1925 Northern Ireland general election, the party won 6% of the total vote and secured three seats in Belfast, including William McMullen elected in Belfast West, as well as Sam Kyle (Belfast North) and Jack Beattie (Belfast East); this was the last election for the Northern Ireland Parliament using the single transferable vote system.

In 1934, those in the Independent Labour Party who refused a British national directive to disaffiliate from the NILP (in line with the ILP&#x27;s break with the Labour Party in Britain) formed the Socialist Party of Northern Ireland (SPNI). A mainly Protestant organisation, It had about 150 members in the Shankill and Newtownards Road districts of Belfast, and included Winifred Carney, Jack Macgougan, secretary from 1935 onwards, and Victor Halley.

In 1944, with other Protestant trade unionists in west Belfast, Halley joined Nationalist Party dissidents around Harry Diamond, and ex-IRA volunteers in forming the Socialist Republican Party. He stood for the party at the 1946 Belfast Central by-election for the party, but was defeated by Frank Hanna of the NILP by 5,566 to 2,783 votes.

The NILP had a Westminster Member of Parliament on only one occasion, when Jack Beattie won the 1943 Belfast West by-election, retained the seat in 1945, but lost it in 1950. He regained the seat as an Irish Labour Party candidate in 1951.

In the 1945 election to the Stormont parliament, held in the aftermath of the second world war, the NILP polled 66,503 votes, 18.6% of the total votes cast.

In 1949, following the declaration of a Republic in the south, the Northern Ireland Labour Party&#x27;s conference voted in favour of the Union with Great Britain. The NILP abandoned its neutral position on the border, adopting a pro-union position that the “Northern Ireland Labour Party will maintain unbroken the connection between Great Britain and Northern Ireland”. 

Many anti-partition Labour activists drifted out of the NILP and joined the Irish Labour Party. The result was a sharp decline in the party&#x27;s already limited electoral success, as Catholic voters deserted, and the Irish Labour Party attempted to organise in Northern Ireland.

An earlier refusal to adopt a pro-union policy had split the party, with leader Harry Midgley forming his own strongly Unionist Commonwealth Labour Party in 1942.

In the 1949 elections to the Stormont Parliament, Labour’s vote fell to 26,831 votes, 7% of the total votes cast. This was a dramatic decline from the 18.5% share of the vote in the 1945 election.

Later in the 1950s, the party began to gain ground amongst unionist voters and, after the breakup of the Irish Labour Party&#x27;s new attempts to organise in Northern Ireland, among some nationalists. The NILP campaign to highlight the failure of the Unionist Government to respond effectively to the growing problem of unemployment led to the NILP attracting more support form both Protestant and Catholic working class voters. In the 1953 elections to the Stormont Parliament the NILP recovered to a 12% share of the vote. 

The NILP saw its greatest period of success between 1958 and 1965. In 1958 the party won nearly 16% of the vote. Four NILP MPs were elected to Stormont for Belfast constituencies: Tom Boyd (Pottinger), Billy Boyd (Woodvale), Vivian Simpson (Oldpark), and David Bleakley (Victoria). The NILP then became the official opposition at Stormont.

In the 1962 Stormont elections the NILP won 76,842 votes, over 25% of the total votes cast. In the 1964 UK General Election the NILP polled 102,759 votes – its highest ever popular vote.

Success came despite continued divisions over such matters as Sunday Observance – two NILP Belfast councillors voted to close the city&#x27;s park playgrounds on Sundays (as demanded by hard line Calvinists but opposed by Catholics) and were expelled as a result.

During this period the NILP maintained its pro-union stance. Despite this, the NILP was winning support from the Catholic working class who were voting on “bread and butter” issues. Paddy Devlin, previously an Irish Labour councillor, joined the NILP in 1958: “the only party that filled my need was the NILP, which was then going from strength to strength. With active trade union backing it was climbing back into the natural position for a local Labour Party: chief challenger of Unionist Party dominance.”

==Civil rights==
In the early to mid 1960s, the NILP was a leading voice in the calls for civil rights and an end to discrimination. When the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) was formed in 1967, NILP members were prominent in the organisation with Paddy Devlin elected to its Executive. But, despite the involvement of many Labour members in the civil rights movement, the NILP felt more comfortable confronting the Unionists at Stormont over civil rights than taking part in the street protests that soon became violent confrontations due to the RUC&#x27;s brutal enforcement of the state ban on many civil rights marches.

==The Troubles==
In 1969 the situation in Northern Ireland worsened as the violent response by the RUC and loyalists to the civil rights marches led to the Battle of the Bogside in Derry and sectarian clashes in working class areas of Belfast.

The growing sectarian polarisation in working class areas in the late 1960s damaged the NILP’s project of building a Labour alternative to Unionism. However, even by 1970 the NILP was still able to poll nearly 100,000 votes across Northern Ireland in the UK General Election.

Any hopes of keeping the cross-community Labour coalition together were damaged by the NILP publicly distancing itself from Paddy Devlin’s lobbying for action to protect Catholic working class communities. The NILP expelled Paddy Devlin in August 1970 for his links with civil rights politicians who would go on to form the SDLP. The NILP also expelled Eamonn McCann, who was chairman of Derry Labour Party, for supporting Bernadette Devlin who had recently been elected as an MP.

With the onset of the Troubles, new parties emerged that appealed to the party&#x27;s support base, including the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland and the Democratic Unionist Party. Once again the polarisation of politics around partition deprived the party of a critical mass.

== Decline ==
In 1971 the new Prime Minister of Northern Ireland Brian Faulkner appointed NILP former Stormont MP David Bleakley to his Cabinet as Minister of Community Relations, in an attempt to bring reforms to Northern Ireland. However, the following year the Stormont Parliament was suspended when it resisted the London government request to take over responsibility for public order. In the 1973 referendum on the border, the NILP campaigned for Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom. 

By 1973 the NILP was in a serious decline with the party only achieving 2.5% of the vote in the local council elections and a similar 2.6% in the Northern Ireland Assembly election. In contrast, Alliance won 13.7% of votes in the local elections and 9.2% in the Assembly elections, and the SDLP achieved its best results so far by polling more than 22% of the votes in the Assembly election. David Bleakley was the only NILP representative elected to the 1973 Assembly and 1975 Forum for East Belfast.

The Northern Ireland Labour Party continued to contest elections but with a dwindling support base. Alan Carr became its leading figure from the mid-1970s until the early 1980s, by which point it had only about 200 members, and just a single councillor was elected for the party in 1981. A party conference in 1983 narrowly failed to secure a necessary two-thirds majority to wind up the party, but it stood no candidates in the 1983 general election, its Chairman and Party Secretary having resigned just beforehand, and by the 1985 Northern Ireland local elections, its three candidates received no support from the central body.

==Labour &#x27;87==
In March 1987, the remains of the party merged with the Labour Party of Northern Ireland (formed in 1985 by former SDLP leader Paddy Devlin), the Ulster Liberal Party and the United Labour Party to form the Labour &#x27;87 group. This group also gained the support of the Newtownabbey Labour Party. They contested local elections and Mark Langhammer contested the 1989 European Elections unsuccessfully.

<text>Nuri Bilge Ceylan (; born 26 January 1959) is a Turkish director, screenwriter, photographer and actor. His film &quot;Winter Sleep&quot; (2014) won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 67th Cannes Film Festival, while six of his films have been selected as Turkey&#x27;s submission for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film.

== Early life and education ==
Ceylan was born in Bakırköy, Istanbul, Turkey on 26 January 1959, to Mehmet Emin Ceylan, an agricultural engineer, and Fatma Ceylan. Ceylan spent most of his childhood in his father&#x27;s hometown of Yenice, Çanakkale. He completed his primary education in Yenice before finishing high school in Istanbul. In 1976, Ceylan started studying chemistry at Istanbul Technical University; in 1978, he transferred to Boğaziçi University in order to study electrical engineering.

During his time at Boğaziçi University, Ceylan began to receive recognition for his work as a photographer; in 1982, he was featured in an article in the arts and culture magazine &quot;Milliyet Sanat&quot; on young Turkish photographers. During the 1980s, photographs by Ceylan were featured in magazines including &quot;Gergedan&quot;; in 1989, he won a national competition to represent Turkey at an international event organised by Kodak, and took part in shoots in London and Kathmandu. After returning to Turkey, he completed military service in Mamak, Ankara. After completing his military service, Ceylan studied film at Mimar Sinan University.

== Career ==
=== 1993–2006 ===
In 1993, he acted in Mehmet Eryılmaz&#x27;s short film &quot;Seviyorum Ergo Sum&quot;, where he also helped with the film&#x27;s production. After the production of &quot;Seviyorum Ergo Sum&quot;, Ceylan bought the camera used to film it and subsequently used it in the production of his own short film, &quot;Koza&quot; (English: &quot;cocoon&quot;). The film, which Ceylan directed, wrote, and produced, became the first Turkish short film to be screened at the 48th Cannes Film Festival in 1995.

In 1997, Ceylan&#x27;s first feature film &quot;Kasaba&quot; screened at various international film festivals including the Berlin International Film Festival. The film, which has been called the first in Ceylan&#x27;s &quot;provincial trilogy&quot; (Turkish: &quot;taşra üçlemesi&quot;) of films (alongside &quot;Mayıs Sıkıntısı&quot; and &quot;Uzak&quot;) has been considered a sequel to &quot;Koza&quot;, with Ceylan doing much of the production roles, including screenwriting and cinematography in addition to directing; it also features a cast consisting primarily of his family members.

Ceylan&#x27;s next film &quot;Mayıs Sıkıntısı&quot; (1999) screened in competition at the Berlin International Film Festival, while &quot;Uzak&quot; (2003) competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 56th Cannes Film Festival; it ultimately won the Grand Prix, while its stars Muzaffer Özdemir and Mehmet Emin Toprak (who died shortly after the film&#x27;s production) were jointly awarded the Best Actor prize. Ceylan subsequently published a novelisation of &quot;Uzak&quot; in 2004.

&quot;Climates&quot; (2006) marked Ceylan&#x27;s first film in which he did not act as cinematographer, with it instead being his first collaboration with Gökhan Tiryaki. Ceylan also did not act as producer, and the film was produced by Zeynep Özbatur Ataken. Ceylan appeared in the leading role in &quot;Climates&quot; alongside his wife, Ebru Ceylan. The film premiered in competition at the 59th Cannes Film Festival.

=== 2008–present ===
Ceylan&#x27;s 2008 film &quot;Three Monkeys&quot; marked his first time working with professional actors. He was awarded the Best Director prize at the 61st Cannes Film Festival, and the film was shortlisted for Best International Feature Film at the 81st Academy Awards, although was not ultimately nominated. Ceylan served as a member of the jury at the 62nd Cannes Film Festival in 2009. In 2011, his film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Anatolia&quot; won the Grand Prix at the 64th Cannes Film Festival, alongside &quot;The Kid with a Bike&quot;. Critic Roger Ebert praised the director, writing: &quot;The Turkish director doesn&#x27;t slap us with big dramatic moments, but allows us to live along with his characters as things occur to them.&quot;

His next film, &quot;Winter Sleep&quot; (2014), premiered at the 67th Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Palme d&#x27;Or, becoming the first Turkish film to win the award since &quot;Yol&quot; in 1982. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the film as &quot;chilly but touching&quot; adding, &quot;[it&#x27;s] a huge, sombre and compelling tragicomedy set in Turkey&#x27;s vast Anatolian steppe&quot;. His film &quot;The Wild Pear Tree&quot; (2018) competed at the 71st Cannes Film Festival. The film is a character study involving a writer who returns to his hometown after graduating, where he seeks sponsors to publish his book while dealing with his father&#x27;s deteriorating indulgence into gambling. Pat Brown of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; praised it as a &quot;rich, textured film, [which] is ostensibly about patrimony—namely, what sons inherit from and owe to their fathers. In many ways it&#x27;s a coming-of-age story, featuring a protagonist whose immature callousness gradually gives way to a more mature openness to his family.&quot;

Ceylan&#x27;s film &quot;About Dry Grasses&quot; competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 76th Cannes Film Festival. Merve Dizdar won the Best Actress award for her performance in the film. The film involves a young teacher hoping to be appointed to Istanbul after mandatory duty at a small village. Siddhant Adlakha of &quot;IndieWire&quot; wrote of the film: &quot;Your mileage may vary, but &#x27;About Dry Grasses&#x27; is among the most brilliantly off-putting works to be featured at Cannes in recent years, with so rotten a core that every hint of virtue or even normalcy in the camera’s peripheral vision becomes a tragedy unto itself, simply by way of being ignored.&quot;

== Styles and themes ==
Recurring themes in Ceylan&#x27;s films include estrangement, existentialism, monotony, and the human experience. He often features static shots and long takes, usually in natural settings and without the use of staged sets. Ceylan&#x27;s use of sound includes using silence to cause unease. He has been noted for filming his protagonists from behind, which he has stated is in order to leave the audience speculating on their motives and emotions. Ceylan&#x27;s earlier films were made on low budgets with casts consisting primarily of amateur actors, often family members and neighbours of Ceylan himself.

== Personal life ==
Ceylan is married to filmmaker, photographer and actress Ebru Ceylan, with whom he co-starred in &quot;Climates&quot;. Ceylan&#x27;s cousin Mehmet Emin Toprak featured in three of his films, most notably &quot;Uzak&quot;; he died in 2002 following a car crash in Çan.

In &quot;Sight and Sound&quot;&#x27;s 2012 poll of the world&#x27;s greatest films, Ceylan named his ten favourite films as being &quot;Andrei Rublev&quot; (1966), &quot;Au hasard Balthazar&quot; (1966), &quot;L&#x27;Avventura&quot; (1960), &quot;L&#x27;Eclisse&quot; (1962), &quot;Late Spring&quot; (1949), &quot;A Man Escaped&quot; (1956), &quot;The Mirror&quot; (1975), &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot; (1973), &quot;Shame&quot; (1968), and &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; (1953).

<doc id="873007" wikidata="Q312009" url="?curid=873007" title="Death's-head hawkmoth">
<text>The name death&#x27;s-head hawkmoth refers to any of three moth species of the genus Acherontia (&quot;Acherontia atropos&quot;, &quot;Acherontia styx&quot; and &quot;Acherontia lachesis&quot;). The former species is found throughout Africa and in Europe, the latter two are Asian; most uses of the common name refer to the African species. These moths are easily distinguishable by the vaguely human skull-shaped pattern of markings on the thorax. They are large nocturnal moths with brown and yellow or orange coloring, and all three species are fairly similar in size, coloration and life cycle.

==Description==

The African death&#x27;s-head hawkmoth (&quot;Acherontia atropos&quot;) is the largest moth in the British Isles (though not in Africa), with a wingspan of ; it is a powerful flier, having sometimes been found on ships far from land. The forewings are a mottled dark brown and pale brown, and the hind wings are orangey-buff with two narrow dark bands parallel with the hind margin. The abdomen is a similar orangey-brown, with a broad, dark dorsal stripe. The most notable feature is a patch of short yellowish hairs on the thorax that gives the impression of depicting a human skull. It is a striking insect, but is seldom seen because it flies late in the night.

A 2020 study describes how, when viewed upside-down, &quot;Acherontia atropos&quot; creates an illusion of a head with eyes: the mark on its thorax likened to a human skull is the &quot;nose&quot;, with the skull&#x27;s eye-sockets resembling nostrils. Spots on its forewings can be seen as eyes, and various other markings and features can be interpreted as ears, muzzle and lips. This illusion is also present in &quot;Agrius convolvuli&quot; (convolvulus hawk-moth) and five other species, with the study author suggesting that the function of the illusion of an eyed head is &quot;almost certainly to deter, distract or otherwise deceive predators&quot;.

The caterpillar of the African death&#x27;s-head hawkmoth is also sturdy and somewhat variable in colour, being some shade of buff, green or brown, with seven diagonal blue lines. At the rear is a curved, thornlike horn. It can attain a length of . The other two species of death&#x27;s-head hawkmoth similarly have three larval color forms: typically, green, brown and yellow. The pupa is stout and reddish-brown, and is formed under the ground in a chamber the size of a large hen&#x27;s egg.

==Development==
Eggs are laid singly under old leaves of a host plant and are green or greyish-blue. In the greater death&#x27;s-head hawkmoth the host plant is usually the potato, but may also be tomato, woody nightshade, jasmine or common buckthorn.
None of the three species is restricted to a single family of host plant, but hosts are typically in the families Solanaceae, Verbenaceae, Oleaceae, Bignoniaceae and others. The larvae are stout, reaching 120–130 mm, with a prominent tail horn. Larvae do not move much, and will click their mandibles or even bite if threatened. When mature, they burrow underground and excavate a chamber where they pupate.

==Behaviour==
These moths have several unusual features. All three species have the ability to emit a loud chirp if irritated. The sound is produced by inhaling and expelling air, which vibrates the epipharynx like an accordion, often accompanied by flashing of the brightly colored abdomen in a further attempt to deter predators. The chirp of the death&#x27;s head hawkmoth takes approximately one-fifth of a second. A study by &quot;National Geographic&quot; found that the epipharynx was originally built to suck up honey, but later evolved to produce sound.

Adults of all three species are commonly observed raiding beehives of different species of honey bee; &quot;A. atropos&quot; only invades colonies of the well-known western honey bee, &quot;Apis mellifera&quot;, and feeds on both nectar and honey. They can move about in hives without being disturbed because they mimic the scent of the bees and are not recognised as intruders. If their disguise is discovered, the moth&#x27;s thick waxy cuticle helps to protect it against stings.

Leaves of the potato plant contain calystegines, a group of polyhydroxy alkaloids, which are toxic. The larva of &quot;A. atropos&quot; feeding on potato foliage accumulates these alkaloids.

==In popular culture==
The species names &quot;atropos&quot;, &quot;lachesis&quot; and &quot;styx&quot; are all from Greek myth and related to death. The first refers to the member of the three Moirai who cuts the threads of life of all beings; the second to the Moira who allots the correct amount of life to a being; and the last refers to the river of the dead. In addition the genus name &quot;Acherontia&quot; is derived from Acheron, a river of Greek myth that was said to be a branch of the river Styx.

According to John Jarvis Bisset in his 1875 work &quot;Sport and War in South Africa&quot;, &quot;The death&#x27;s-head moth, as found in South Africa, is about the size and length of a man&#x27;s finger, and it has a most perfect death&#x27;s-head-and-marrowbones painted by Nature with all her beauty on its back. The legend both amongst the Dutch and the natives of the Cape of Good Hope, is, that this moth has a sting, and that a puncture from it causes instant death. This moth is generally found in beehives, particularly when they are in the ground or in decayed trees.&quot;

The skull-like pattern and its fanciful associations with the supernatural and evil have fostered superstitious fears of &quot;Acherontia&quot; species, particularly &quot;Acherontia atropos&quot;, perhaps because it is the most widely known. The moths&#x27; sharp, mouse-like squeaking intensify the effect. Nor is this a new attitude: during the mid-19th century, entomologist Edward Newman, having earlier mentioned the mark on the thorax wrote: &quot;However, let the cause of the noise be what it may, the effect is to produce the most superstitious feelings among the uneducated, by whom it is always regarded with feelings of awe and terror.&quot;

According to legend, the species (&quot;atropos&quot;) was first seen in Britain at the time of the execution of King Charles I, but it is more likely to have simply become more common by that time, having arrived with the first transportation of potatoes some decades earlier. Though rarer, it is still occasionally sighted in the country.

Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s short story &quot;The Sphinx&quot; describes a close encounter with a death&#x27;s-head sphinx moth, describing it as &quot;the genus Sphinx, of the family Crepuscularia of the order Lepidoptera.&quot;

These moths have often been featured in art, such as by German artist Sulamith Wülfing and English artist William Holman Hunt in his 1851 painting &quot;The Hireling Shepherd&quot;.

Films such as &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot; (1929, by Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí) and the 1991 film &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (and in Chapter 33 of the source novel, whereas in Chapter 14 a different moth species is used, the black witch moth) feature the moth. The death&#x27;s-head moth also featured in the 1968 horror film &quot;The Blood Beast Terror&quot; starring Peter Cushing. The species &quot;Acherontia atropos&quot; is mentioned, though the costume of the human-moth hybrid creature is not an accurate representation of the moth. The moth plays a central role in the 2015 Taiwanese horror film &quot;The Tag-Along&quot;.

In 2018 survival horror game, &quot;&quot; by Italian artist Chris Darril, they represent both the transformation and the human psyche. They also work as a parasite which interfere with people&#x27;s memories, old repressed events, and feelings of guilt.

<text>Januarius ( ; ; Neapolitan and ), also known as , was Bishop of Benevento and is a martyr and saint of the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, and Armenian Apostolic Church. While no contemporary sources on his life are preserved, later sources and legends claim that he died during the Great Persecution, which ended with Diocletian&#x27;s retirement in 305.

Januarius is the patron saint of Naples, where the faithful gather three times a year in Naples Cathedral to witness the liquefaction of what is claimed to be a sample of his blood kept in a sealed glass ampoule.

==Life==
Little is known of the life of Januarius, and what follows is mostly derived from later Christian sources, such as the &quot;Acta Bononensia&quot; (BHL 4132, not earlier than 6th century) and the &quot;Acta Vaticana&quot; (BHL 4115, 9th century), and from later folk traditions.

===Legend===

According to various hagiographies, Januarius was born in Benevento to a rich patrician family that traced its descent to the Caudini tribe of the Samnites. At a young age of 15, he became local priest of his parish in Benevento, which at the time had only a small Christian community. When Januarius was 20, he became Bishop of Naples and befriended Juliana of Nicomedia and Sossius whom he met during his studies for the priesthood. During the -year-long persecution of Christians by Emperor Diocletian, he hid some of his fellow Christians and prevented them from being caught. But while visiting Sossius in jail, he too was arrested. He and his colleagues were condemned to be thrown to wild bears in the Flavian Amphitheater at Pozzuoli, but the sentence was changed due to fear of public disturbance, and they were instead beheaded at the Solfatara crater near Pozzuoli. Other legends state either that the wild beasts refused to eat him, or that he was thrown into a furnace but came out unscathed.

===History===
The earliest historical reference to Januarius is contained in a letter by Uranius, bishop of Nola, dated to c.e 432 on the death of his mentor Paulinus of Nola, where it is stated that the ghosts of Januarius and Martin of Tours had appeared to Paulinus three days before his death in 431. About Januarius, the account says only that he was &quot;bishop as well as martyr, an illustrious member of the Neapolitan church&quot;. The Acta Bononensia says that &quot;At Pozzuoli in Campania [is honored the memory] of the holy martyrs Januarius, Bishop of Beneventum, Festus his deacon, and Desiderius lector, together with Sossius deacon of the church of Misenum, Proculus, deacon of Pozzuoli, Eutyches, and Acutius, who after chains and imprisonment were beheaded under the emperor Diocletian&quot;.

==Legacy==
===Celebrations===
The Feast of San Gennaro is celebrated on 19 September in the General Roman Calendar of the Catholic Church. In the Eastern Church, it is celebrated on 21 April. The city of Naples has more than fifty official patron saints, although its principal patron is Saint Januarius.

In the United States, the Feast of San Gennaro is also a highlight of the year for New York&#x27;s Little Italy, with the saint&#x27;s polychrome statue carried through the middle of a street fair stretching for blocks.

===Relics===

According to an early hagiography, Januarius&#x27;s relics were transferred by order of Severus, Bishop of Naples, to the Neapolitan catacombs &quot;outside the walls&quot; (&quot;&quot;). In the early ninth century the body was moved to Beneventum by Sico, prince of Benevento, with the head remaining in Naples. Subsequently, during the turmoil at the time of Frederick Barbarossa, his body was moved again, this time to the Territorial Abbey of Montevergine where it was rediscovered in 1480.

At the instigation of Cardinal Oliviero Carafa, his body was finally transferred in 1497 to Naples, where he is the city&#x27;s patron saint. Carafa commissioned a richly decorated crypt, the &quot;Succorpo&quot;, beneath the cathedral to house the reunited body and head properly. The &quot;Succorpo&quot; was finished in 1506 and is considered one of the prominent monuments of the High Renaissance in the city.

===Blood===
Saint Januarius is famous for the annual liquefaction of his blood, which, according to legend, was saved by a woman called Eusebia just after the saint&#x27;s death. A chronicle of Naples written in 1382 describes the cult of Saint Januarius in detail, but mentions neither the relic nor the miracle. The first certain date is 1389, when it was found to have melted. Then, over the following two and a half centuries official reports began to appear declaring that the blood spontaneously melted, at first once a year, then twice, and finally three times a year. While the report of the very first incidence of liquefaction did not make any explicit reference to the skull of the saint, soon afterwards assertions began to appear that this relic was activating the melting process, as if the blood, recognizing a part of the body to which it belonged, &quot;were impatient while waiting for its resurrection&quot;. This explanation was definitively abandoned only in the eighteenth century.

Thousands of people assemble to witness this event in Naples Cathedral three times a year: on 19 September (Saint Januarius&#x27;s Day, commemorating his martyrdom), on 16 December (celebrating his patronage of Naples and its archdiocese), and on the Saturday before the first Sunday of May (commemorating the reunification of his relics).

The blood is also said to spontaneously liquefy at certain other times, such as papal visits. It supposedly liquefied in the presence of Pope Pius IX in 1848, but not that of John Paul II in 1979 or Benedict XVI in 2007. On March 21, 2015, Pope Francis venerated the dried blood during a visit to Naples Cathedral, saying the Lord&#x27;s Prayer over it and kissing it. Archbishop Sepe then declared that &quot;The blood has half liquefied, which shows that Saint Januarius loves our pope and Naples.&quot;

====Ritual liquefaction====

The blood is stored in two hermetically sealed small ampoules, held since the 17th century in a silver reliquary between two round glass plates about 12 cm wide. The smaller, cylindrical ampoule contains only a few reddish spots on its walls, the bulk having allegedly been removed and taken to Spain by Charles III. The larger, almond-shaped ampoule, with a capacity of about 60 ml, is about 60% filled with a dark reddish substance. Separate reliquaries hold bone fragments believed to belong to Saint Januarius.

For most of the time, the ampoules are kept in a bank vault, whose keys are held by a commission of local notables, including the mayor of Naples; the bones are kept in a crypt under the main altar of Naples Cathedral. On feast days, all these relics are taken in procession from the cathedral to the Monastery of Santa Chiara, where the archbishop holds up the reliquary and tilts it to show that the contents are solid, then places it on the high altar next to the saint&#x27;s other relics. After intense prayers by the faithful, including the so-called &quot;relatives of Saint Januarius&quot; (&quot;parenti di San Gennaro&quot;), the content of the larger vial typically appears to liquify. The archbishop then holds up the vial and tilts it again to demonstrate that liquefaction has taken place. The announcement of the liquifaction is greeted with at the 13th-century Castel Nuovo. The ampoules remain exposed on the altar for eight days, while the priests move or turn them periodically to show that the contents remain liquid. Sir Francis Ronalds gives a detailed description of the May 1819 ritual in his travel journal.

The liquifaction sometimes takes place almost immediately, but can take hours or even days. Records kept at the Duomo tell that on rare occasions the contents fail to liquify, are found already liquified when the ampoules are taken from the safe, or liquify outside the usual dates.

====Scientific studies====

While the Catholic Church has always supported the celebrations, it has never formulated an official statement on the phenomenon and maintains a neutral stance about scientific investigations. It does not permit the vials to be opened, for fear that doing so may cause irreparable damage. This makes close analysis impossible. Nevertheless, a spectroscopic analysis performed in 1902 by Gennaro Sperindeo claimed that the spectrum was consistent with hemoglobin. A later analysis, with similar conclusions, was carried out by a team in 1989. However, the reliability of these observations has been questioned. While clotted blood can be liquefied by mechanical stirring, the resulting suspension cannot solidify again.

Measurements made in 1900 and 1904 claimed that the ampoules&#x27; weight increased by up to 28 grams during liquefaction. However, later measurements with a precision balance, performed over five years, failed to detect any variation.

Various suggestions for the content&#x27;s composition have been advanced, such as a material that is photosensitive, hygroscopic, or has a low melting point. However, these explanations run into technical difficulties, such as the variability of the phenomenon and its lack of correlation to ambient temperature.

A recent hypothesis by Garlaschelli &amp; al. is that the vial contains a thixotropic gel, In such a substance viscosity increases if left unstirred and decreases if stirred or moved. Researchers have proposed specifically a suspension of hydrated iron oxide, FeO(OH), which reproduces the color and behavior of the &#x27;blood&#x27; in the ampoule. The suspension can be prepared from simple chemicals that would have been easily available locally since antiquity.

In 2010, Giuseppe Geraci, a professor in the Department of Molecular Biology at Naples&#x27;s Frederick II University, conducted an experiment on a vial containing old blood—a relic dating back to the 18th century from the &quot;Eremo di Camaldoli&quot; near Arezzo in Tuscany—having the same characteristics of the blood of St. Januarius. Prof. Geraci showed that the Camaldoli relic also contains blood that can change its solid-liquid phase by shaking. He further reproduced the phenomenon with his own blood stored in the same conditions as the Camaldoli relic. He stated that, &quot;There is no univocal scientific fact that explains why these changes take place. It is not enough to attribute to the movement the ability to dissolve the blood, the liquid contained in the Treasure case changes state for reasons still to be identified.&quot;
 He ultimately argued that &quot;there&#x27;s blood, no miracle&quot;.

A book by the historian of science Francesco Paolo de Ceglia recently traced the research of various scientists over the centuries to explain the phenomenon, which, according to him, has a thermal origin, since the (alleged) blood, in September, when the temperature is highest, is already extracted in liquid form from the tabernacle that stores it. In May it takes longer. And in December it takes much longer. This last annual ‘miracle’ did not take place for many years, but lately, with climate change and the rising temperature in Naples, it is happening more and more frequently. 

====Similar rites====
Although Naples became known as &quot;City of Blood&quot; (&quot;&quot;), legends of blood liquefaction are not a unique phenomenon. Other examples include vials of the blood of Saint Patricia and Saint John the Baptist in the monastery of San Gregorio Armeno, and of Saint Pantaleon in Ravello. In all, the church has recognized claims of miraculous liquefying blood for seven or about twenty saints from Campania and virtually nowhere else. The blood cults of the other saints have been discontinued since the 16th century, which noted skeptic James Randi takes as evidence that local artisans or alchemists had a secret recipe for manufacturing this type of relic. A team of three Italian chemists managed to create a liquid that reproduces all the characteristics and behavior of the liquid in the vial, using only local materials and techniques that were known to medieval workers. Jordan Lancaster leaves open the possibility that the practice was a Christian survival of a pagan ritual intended to protect the locals from unexpected eruptions from Mount Vesuvius.

===Museum of the Treasure of St. Januarius===
The Treasure of St. Januarius is a collection of magnificent works and donations collected in seven centuries from popes, kings, emperors, famous and ordinary people. According to studies done by a pool of experts who have analyzed all the pieces in the collection, the Treasure of St. Januarius is of higher value than the crown of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and the Tsar of Russia. The Treasure is a unique collection of art masterpieces, kept untouched thanks to the Deputation of the Chapel of St Januarius, an ancient secular institution founded in 1527 by a vote of the city of Naples, still existing.

Today, the Treasure is exhibited in the Museum of the Treasure of St. Januarius, whose entrance is located on the right side of the Dome of Naples, under the arcades. By visiting the museum, the Chapel of San Gennaro is accessible even when the cathedral is closed.

<text>Graham Island () is the largest island in the Haida Gwaii archipelago (previously known as the Queen Charlotte Islands), lying off the mainland coast of British Columbia, Canada. It is separated by the narrow Skidegate Channel from the other principal island of the group to the south, Moresby Island (&quot;T&#x27;aaxwii X̱aaydag̱a Gwaay.yaay linag̱waay&quot; in the language of the Haida people). It has a population of 3,858 (2016 census), an area of , and is the 101st largest island in the world and Canada&#x27;s 22nd largest island.

Graham Island was named in 1853 by James Charles Prevost, commander of HMS &quot;Virago&quot;, for Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet, who was First Lord of the Admiralty at the time.

<doc id="873021" wikidata="Q193168" url="?curid=873021" title="Present">
<text>The present is the period of time that is occurring now. The present is contrasted with the past, the period of time that has already occurred, and the future, the period of time that has yet to occur.

It is sometimes represented as a hyperplane in space-time, typically called &quot;now&quot;, although modern physics demonstrates that such a hyperplane cannot be defined uniquely for observers in relative motion. The present may also be viewed as a duration.

==Historiography==
Contemporary history describes the historical timeframe immediately relevant to the present time and is a certain perspective of modern history.

==Philosophy and religion==
===Philosophy of time===
&quot;The present&quot; raises the question: &quot;How is it that all sentient beings experience &quot;now&quot; at the same time?&quot; There is no logical reason why this should be the case and no easy answer to the question.

===In Buddhism===
Buddhism and many of its associated paradigms emphasize the importance of living in the present moment—being fully aware of what is happening, and not dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. This does not mean that they encourage hedonism, but merely that constant focus on one&#x27;s current position in space and time (rather than future considerations, or past reminiscence) will aid one in relieving suffering. They teach that those who live in the present moment are the happiest. A number of meditative techniques aim to help the practiser live in the present moment.

=== Christianity and eternity ===
Christianity views God as being outside of time and, from the divine perspective past, present and future are actualized in the now of eternity. This trans-temporal conception of God has been proposed as a solution to the problem of divine foreknowledge (i.e. how can God know what we will do in the future without us being determined to do it) since at least Boethius. Thomas Aquinas offers the metaphor of a watchman, representing God, standing on a height looking down on a valley to a road where past, present and future, represented by the individuals and their actions strung out along its length, are all visible simultaneously to God. Therefore, God&#x27;s knowledge is not tied to any particular date.

==Physical science==

===Special relativity===

 The original intent of the diagram on the right was to portray a 3-dimensional object having access to the past, present, and future in the present moment (4th dimension).
It follows from Albert Einstein&#x27;s Special Theory of Relativity that there is no such thing as absolute simultaneity. When care is taken to operationalise &quot;the present&quot;, it follows that the events that can be labeled as &quot;simultaneous&quot; with a given event, can not be in direct cause-effect relationship. Such collections of events are perceived differently by different observers. Instead, when focusing on &quot;now&quot; as the events perceived directly, not as a recollection or a speculation, for a given observer &quot;now&quot; takes the form of the observer&#x27;s past light cone. The light cone of a given event is objectively defined as the collection of events in causal relationship to that event, but each event has a different associated light cone. One has to conclude that in relativistic models of physics there is no place for &quot;the present&quot; as an absolute element of reality, and only refers to things that are close to us. Einstein phrased this as: &quot;People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion&quot;.

===Cosmology===

In physical cosmology, the present time in the chronology of the universe is estimated at 13.8 billion years after the singularity determining the arrow of time.
In terms of the cosmic expansion history, it is in the dark-energy-dominated era, after the universe&#x27;s matter content has become diluted enough for dark energy to dominate the total energy density. It is also in the universe&#x27;s Stelliferous Era, after enough time for superclusters to have formed (at about 5 billion years), but before the accelerating expansion of the universe has removed the local supercluster beyond the cosmological horizon (at about 150 billion years).

===Archaeology, geology, etc.===
In radiocarbon dating, the &quot;present&quot; is defined as AD 1950.

== Grammar ==
In English grammar, actions are classified according to one of the following twelve verb tenses: past (past, past continuous, past perfect, or past perfect continuous), present (present, present continuous, present perfect, or present perfect continuous), or future (future, future continuous, future perfect, or future perfect continuous). The present tense refers to things that are currently happening or are always the case. For example, in the sentence, &quot;she walks home everyday,&quot; the verb &quot;walks&quot; is in the present tense because it refers to an action that is regularly occurring in the present circumstances.

Verbs in the present continuous tense indicate actions that are currently happening and will continue for a period of time. In the sentence, &quot;she is walking home,&quot; the verb phrase &quot;is walking&quot; is in the present continuous tense because it refers to a current action that will continue until a certain endpoint (when &quot;she&quot; reaches home). Verbs in the present perfect tense indicate actions that started in the past and is completed at the time of speaking. For example, in the sentence, &quot;She has walked home,&quot; the verb phrase &quot;has walked&quot; is in the present perfect tense because it describes an action that began in the past and is finished as of the current reference to the action. Finally, verbs in the present perfect continuous tense refer to actions that have been continuing up until the current time, thus combining the characteristics of both the continuous and perfect tenses. An example of a present perfect continuous verb phrase can be found in the sentence, &quot;she has been walking this route for a week now,&quot; where &quot;has been walking&quot; indicates an action that was happening continuously in the past and continues to happen continuously in the present.

<doc id="873027" wikidata="Q1674067" url="?curid=873027" title="Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego">
<text>Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego (English: &quot;Big Island of the Land of Fire&quot;) also formerly &quot;Isla de Xátiva&quot; is an island near the southern tip of South America from which it is separated by the Strait of Magellan. The western portion (61.4%) of the island () is in Chile (Province of Tierra del Fuego and Antártica Chilena Province), while the eastern portion (38.6%, ) is in Argentina (Tierra del Fuego Province). It forms the major landmass in an extended group of islands or archipelago also known as Tierra del Fuego.

The island has an area of , making it the largest island in South America and the 29th largest island in the world. Its two biggest towns are Ushuaia and Río Grande, both in Argentina. Other towns are Tolhuin, Porvenir, Camerón, and Cerro Sombrero. The Argentine side, Tierra del Fuego Province, has 127,205 inhabitants (2010), whereas the Chilean side has only 6,656 (2012), almost all located in the Tierra del Fuego Province.

Its highest point is unofficially named Monte Shipton (), in Chile. Nearby Mount Darwin was previously thought to be the tallest mountain on the island, but is just less than a hundred metres shorter. The northern parts of the island have oil deposits; Cerro Sombrero in Chile is the main extraction centre in the island.

On 17 December 1949, an earthquake occurred in the Chilean portion, near the Argentine border. Recorded as 7.8 on the moment magnitude scale, it was the most powerful ever recorded in the south of Argentina.

==Geography==

Tierra del Fuego is bounded on the east by the South Atlantic, on the north by the Magellan Straits and on the south and west by a series of fjords and channels linked to the Pacific Ocean. One of the few prominent features of the northeast shore is San Sebastián Bay. To the south the island is bounded by the Beagle Channel, south of which lie a series of islands included in Chilean territory. To the west the island has two major inlets, Inútil Bay and Almirantazgo Fjord. The latter lies along the Magallanes–Fagnano Fault and is a continuation of the Cami Lake depression in southern Tierra del Fuego.

The southwest part of the island, between the Almirantazgo Fjord and the Beagle Channel and extending west to end at Brecknock Peninsula on the Pacific Ocean, is mountainous with a heavily indented coastline, dominated by the Cordillera Darwin. Most of this part of the island is included in the Alberto de Agostini National Park of Chile.

==History==

The earliest human settlement occurred more than 10,000 years ago, as people migrated from the mainland, perhaps under pressure from competitors. The Yaghan people were some of the earliest known humans settling in Tierra del Fuego. Certain archeological sites at locations such as Navarino Island, within the islands of Tierra del Fuego, have yielded artifacts and evidence of their culture from the Megalithic era.

The name Tierra del Fuego derives from Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, who was the first European to visit these lands in 1520, on his voyage to the Philippines from Spain. He believed he was seeing the many fires (fuego in Spanish) of the Amerindians, which were visible from the sea and that the &quot;Indians&quot; were waiting in the forests to ambush his armada. These were fires lit by the Yamana Indians who live in the northern part of the island, to ward off the low temperatures in the area. Originally called the &quot;Land of Smoke&quot;, it was later changed to the more exciting &quot;Land of Fire&quot;.

The British commander Robert Fitzroy, on his first voyage aboard in 1830, captured four native Fuegians after they stole a boat from his ship. The men included &quot;Orundellico,&quot; later named Jemmy Button by his crew. Fitzroy taught them English and took them with him on his return to England, where he took them to Court to meet the King and Queen in London. They became early celebrities. The surviving three were returned to Tierra del Fuego on the second voyage of &quot;Beagle&quot;, which included the naturalist Charles Darwin, who made extensive notes about his visit to the islands.

In July 1881 the island was divided between Argentina and Chile, each having previously claimed it entirely during the East Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego and Strait of Magellan Dispute.

The 1949 Tierra del Fuego earthquake took place on 17 December 1949, at 06:53:30. It recorded magnitude 7.8 in the Richter scale. Its epicenter was located in the east of the Chilean Tierra del Fuego Province, close to the Argentine border, at a depth of 30 km (19 mi).

This was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in the south of Argentina. It was felt with grade VIII in the Mercalli intensity scale, and affected the settlements and some others like Punta Arenas and Río Gallegos. Due to low population density, damage was limited.

==Climate==
The region has a subpolar oceanic climate and a mild tundra climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfc&quot; and &quot;ET&quot;) with short, cool summers with a mean at around and long, cool and wet winters with a mean at around . The northeast is characterized by strong winds and little precipitation, while in the south and west it is very windy, foggy, and wet most of the year, with precipitation levels averaging a year. The permanent snow line begins at . Places in the world with comparable climates are the Aleutian Islands, Iceland, Kuril Islands, Campbell Island, the Kerguelen Islands, the Scottish Highlands, and coastal areas of Norway.

In August 1995 the island was hit by an event of intense winds, cold and snowfall known as the White Earthquake. This caused the ferry service across Primera Angostura to be suspended, as well as the international road to Río Gallegos to be closed. In Timaukel alone the mayor reported that 150,000 sheep and 6,500 heads of cattle were threatened by the event.


==Flora==

Only 30% of the islands have forests, which are classified as Magellanic subpolar; the northeast is made up by steppe and cool semidesert.

There are six species of tree found in Tierra del Fuego: Canelo or Winter&#x27;s Bark (&quot;Drimys winteri&quot;), &quot;Maytenus magellanica&quot;, &quot;Pilgerodendron uviferum&quot; the southernmost conifer in the world, and three kinds of southern beech; &quot;Nothofagus antarctica&quot;, &quot;Nothofagus pumilio&quot; and the evergreen &quot;Nothofagus betuloides&quot;. Edible fruits grow in open spaces in these forests, such as beach strawberry (&quot;Fragaria chiloensis&quot; var. chiloensis forma chiloensis) and calafate (&quot;Berberis buxifolia&quot;), which have been collected by Indians and residents alike. These forests are unique in the world for having developed in a climate with such cold summers. Tree cover extends very close to the southernmost tip of South America. Winds are so strong that trees in wind-exposed areas grow twisted by the force of winds, and people call the trees &quot;flag-trees&quot; for the shape that they need to take in the fight with the wind. Tree vegetation extends as far south as the Isla de los Estados, Navarino Island and the north of Hoste Island. At altitudes above, dwarf &quot;Nothofagus&quot; communities are found. Going further south, Wollaston Islands and the south of Hoste Island are covered by subantarctic tundra.

The forests of Tierra del Fuego have been a source of trees that have been planted abroad in places with a similar climate but that were devoid of trees, such as the Faroe Islands and nearby archipelagos. Most species were gathered from the coldest places in Tierra del Fuego bordering the tundra. This resulted in positive changes, as the heavy winds and cool summers in the Faroe Islands had not formerly allowed the growth of trees from other regions in the world. In the Faroe Islands, the imported trees are used ornamentally, as curtains against wind, and for fighting erosion caused by storms and grazing.

==Economy==

The main industries are oil, natural gas, sheep farming and ecotourism. On the Argentine side several electronics companies have been established. Ushuaia is home to the small brewing company Cervecería Fueguina, which produces three beers under the Beagle brand name.

<text>The dissolution of Czechoslovakia (, ), which took effect on December 31, 1992, was the self-determined secession of the federal republic of Czechoslovakia into the independent countries of the Czech Republic (also known as Czechia) and Slovakia. Both mirrored the Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist Republic, which had been created in 1969 as the constituent states of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic until the end of 1989.

It is sometimes known as the Velvet Divorce, a reference to the bloodless Velvet Revolution of 1989, which had led to the end of the rule of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.

==Background==
Czechoslovakia was created with the dissolution of Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I. In 1918, a meeting took place in the American city of Pittsburgh, at which the future Czechoslovak President Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk and other Czech and Slovak representatives signed the Pittsburgh Agreement, which promised a common state consisting of two equal nations: Slovaks and Czechs. However, the Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920 specified a single &quot;Czechoslovak nation&quot;. 

In subsequent years, there were political tensions in the new country between Czechoslovakists and those seeking greater autonomy for the Slovaks in particular. 
In March 1939, with pressure from Adolf Hitler, the First Slovak Republic was created as a satellite state of Germany with limited sovereignty. The alignment with the Soviet Union after World War II oversaw the reunification into the Third Czechoslovak Republic.

In 1968, the Constitutional Law of Federation reinstated an official federal structure of the 1917 type, but during the Normalization Period in the 1970s, Gustáv Husák, despite being a Slovak himself, returned most control to Prague. That approach encouraged a regrowth of Slovak separatism after the fall of communism.

==Partition into two entities==

By 1991, the Czech Republic&#x27;s GDP per capita was some 20% higher than Slovakia&#x27;s. Transfer payments from the Czech budget to Slovakia, which had been the rule in the past, were stopped in January 1991.

Many Czechs and Slovaks desired the continued existence of a federal Czechoslovakia. Some major Slovak parties, however, advocated a looser form of coexistence and the Slovak National Party sought complete independence and sovereignty. For a few years, political parties re-emerged, but Czech parties had little or no presence in Slovakia and vice versa. To have a functioning state, the government demanded continued control from Prague, but Slovaks continued to ask for decentralisation.

In 1992, the Czech Republic elected Václav Klaus and others, who demanded either an even tighter federation (&quot;viable federation&quot;) or two independent states. Vladimír Mečiar and other leading Slovak politicians wanted a kind of confederation. Both sides opened frequent and intense negotiations in June. On July 17, the Slovak parliament adopted the declaration of independence of the Slovak nation. Six days later, Klaus and Mečiar agreed to secede Czechoslovakia into two separate states at a meeting in Bratislava. Czechoslovak President Václav Havel resigned, rather than oversee the secession, which he had opposed. In a September 1992 opinion poll, only 37% of Slovaks and 36% of Czechs favoured dissolution.

The goal of negotiations switched to achieving a peaceful division. Peaceful division was prioritized as the process ran in parallel with the violent breakup of Yugoslavia (another formerly socialist, Slavic federal state created after the dissolution of Austria-Hungary). On November 13, the Federal Assembly passed Constitution Act 541, which settled the division of property between the Czech lands and Slovakia. With Constitution Act 542, passed on November 25, they agreed to the secession of Czechoslovakia into two entities as of December 31, 1992.

The partition occurred without violence and so was thus said to be &quot;velvet&quot;, much like the &quot;Velvet Revolution&quot;, which had preceded it and had been accomplished by massive peaceful demonstrations and actions. In contrast, other post-communist breakups (such as the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia) involved violent conflict. Czechoslovakia is the only former Eastern Bloc state that had an entirely peaceful breakup. In the following years, as Slovakia&#x27;s economy struggled, Slovaks began to describe the dissolution as a &quot;sandpaper divorce&quot;.

==Causes==

A number of reasons have been given for the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, with the main debates focusing on whether dissolution was inevitable or whether dissolution occurred in conjunction with or even in contrast to the events that occurred between the Velvet Revolution of 1989 and the end of the joined state in 1992.

Those who argue from the inevitability stance tend to point to the differences between the two nations, which date back to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and to other issues. There are differences between the Czechs and Slovaks, such as problems with the shared state during communism, the success of the state in the Czech lands, its failure in the Slovak lands that still resulted in the adoption of communism since the Czechs were more influential in the running of the state than Slovaks, and the 1968 constitution with its minority veto.

Those who argue that events between 1989 and 1992 led to the dissolution point to international factors such as the breakaway of the Soviet satellite nations, the lack of unified media between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and most importantly the actions of the political leaders of both nations like the disagreements between Prime Ministers Klaus and Mečiar.

==Legal aspects==

===National symbols===
Since the coat of arms of Czechoslovakia was a composition of those of the historic geographic areas forming the country, each republic simply kept its own symbol: the Czechs the lion and the Slovaks the double cross. The same principle was applied to the two-part bilingual Czechoslovak national anthem that comprised two separate pieces of music, the Czech stanza Kde domov můj and the Slovak stanza Nad Tatrou sa blýska. Disputes occurred only with respect to the Czechoslovak flag. During the 1992 negotiations on the details of dissolution of Czechoslovakia, as demanded by Vladimír Mečiar and Václav Klaus, a clause forbidding the use of the state symbols of Czechoslovakia by its successor states was inserted into the constitutional law on the dissolution of Czechoslovakia.

From 1990 to 1992, the red and white flag of Bohemia (differing only slightly from the Polish flag by proportion and tone) officially served as the flag of the Czech Republic. Eventually, after a search for new symbols, the Czech Republic unilaterally decided to ignore the aforementioned law and to keep the Czechoslovak flag, with an altered meaning. Slovakia, meanwhile, adopted its traditional flag; however, just before independence, on September 3, 1992, the coat of arms was added in order to prevent confusion with the similar flags of Russia and Slovenia.

===Territory===
The national territory was divided along the existing internal borders, but the border was not clearly defined at some points and, in some areas, the border cut across streets, access roads and communities that had coexisted for centuries. The most serious issues occurred around the following areas:

*U Sabotů or Šance (:cs:Šance (Vrbovce)) – historically part of Moravia, awarded to Slovakia in 1997
*Sidonie or Sidónia (:cs:Sidonie) – historically part of Hungary (which contained all present-day Slovak territory until 1918), awarded to the Czech Republic in 1997
*Kasárna (:cs:Kasárna (Makov)) recreational area – historically Moravian, disputed between Moravia and Hungary since the 16th century, formally part of Hungary since 1734; accessible by car only from the Czech side until early 2000s; remained in Slovakia despite heavy objections from the mostly-Czech property owners, whose real estate effectively fell into a foreign country.

The new countries were able to solve the difficulties via mutual negotiations, financial compensation and then an international treaty covering the border modifications.

People living or owning property in the border area, however, continued to experience practical problems until both new countries entered the Schengen Agreement Area in 2007, rendering the border less significant.

===Division of national property===
Most federal assets were divided in a ratio of two to one, the approximate ratio between the Czech and Slovak population in Czechoslovakia, including army equipment, rail and airliner infrastructure. Some minor disputes, such as gold reserves stored in Prague and federal know-how valuation, lasted for a few years after the dissolution.

===Currency division===
Initially, the old Czechoslovak currency, the Czechoslovak koruna, remained in use by both countries. Czech fears of an economic loss caused the adoption of two national currencies as early as February 8, 1993. On February 2, 1993 Act No. 60/1993 Coll. came in effect in the Czech Republic to create a separate currency that was already envisaged in the Czech Constitution and in Act No. 6/1993 Coll. that created the Czech National Bank by stamping Czechoslovak banknotes. The stamps had already been prepared in secret in 1992 after the decision about the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. In December 1992 some of the reserve banknotes started to be stamped in the selected banks in secret. From 8 February to 12 February old banknotes of 100, 500 and 1,000 Kčs (Czechoslovak crowns) were exchanged for the stamped ones in the Czech Republic and a new 200 Kč banknote was introduced. Each person over 15 could exchange banknotes up to 4,000 crowns, and minors below 15 years of age up to 1,000 crowns. Banknotes of lower denominations and coins remained until new ones were printed and minted. Banks in the Czech Republic converted all money on 8 February 1993 from Kčs to Kč. In Slovakia stamps were also applied on banknotes, and a new 10 SK coin was introduced. At the beginning, the currencies could be exchanged at par, but later the value of the Slovak koruna was usually lower than that of the Czech koruna (in 2004, around 25–27% lower). On August 2, 1993, both currencies were distinguished by different stamps that were first affixed to and then printed on old Czechoslovak koruna banknotes. New Czech and Slovak coins replaced old ones during 1993.

On January 1, 2009, Slovakia adopted the euro as its currency, with a conversion rate of 30.126 SK/€, and the €2 commemorative coin for 2009, Slovakia&#x27;s first, featured the 20th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution in remembrance of the common struggle of the Czechoslovaks for democracy. By a quirk of fate, the welcoming speech on the behalf of the European Union on the occasion of Slovakia&#x27;s entry to the eurozone was delivered by Mirek Topolánek, the prime minister of the presiding country, the Czech Republic, naturally in his native language, but the other guest speakers used English. The Czech Republic continues to use the Czech koruna, or crown, but are bound to switch to the Euro in the future.

===International law===
Neither the Czech Republic nor Slovakia sought recognition as the sole successor state to Czechoslovakia. This can be contrasted to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, when the Russian Federation was recognized as successor state not only to the Russian SFSR but also to the Soviet Union itself, and also contrasts with the dissolution of Yugoslavia, where the rump Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, dominated by Serbia and encompassing only it and Montenegro, unsuccessfully demanded recognition as the sole successor to the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, even though the four remaining ex-Yugoslav states, now independent, collectively encompassed around three-fifths of former Yugoslavia, both in population and in territory. Therefore, Czechoslovakia&#x27;s membership in the United Nations ceased upon the dissolution of the country, but on January 19, 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia were admitted as new, separate states.

With respect to other international treaties, the Czechs and the Slovaks agreed to honour the treaty obligations of Czechoslovakia. The Slovaks transmitted a letter to the Secretary General of the United Nations on May 19, 1993, to express their intent to remain a party to all treaties signed and ratified by Czechoslovakia and to ratify treaties signed but not ratified before dissolution of Czechoslovakia. The letter acknowledged that under international law, all treaties signed and ratified by Czechoslovakia would remain in force. For example, both countries are recognized as signatories of the Antarctic Treaty from the date that Czechoslovakia had signed the agreement in 1962.

Both countries have ratified the Vienna Convention on Succession of States in respect of Treaties, and it was not a factor in the dissolution of Czechoslovakia since it did not come into force until 1996.

==Aftermath==
===Economy===

The dissolution had some negative impact on the two economies, especially in 1993, as traditional links were severed to accommodate the bureaucracy of international trade, but the impact was considerably less than expected by many people.

A customs union between the Czech Republic and Slovakia remained in place from the dissolution until May 1, 2004, when both countries entered the European Union (EU).

Many Czechs hoped that dissolution would quickly start an era of high economic growth in the Czech Republic, which no longer had to sponsor the &quot;less-developed Slovakia&quot;. Similarly, others looked forward to an independent unexploited Slovakia that might become a new &quot;economic tiger&quot;.

According to &quot;The Prague Post&quot;, &quot;Slovak GDP reached 95 percent of the Czech GDP, and it is likely to draw level with it. The Slovak gross national product (GNP), which includes citizens&#x27; incomes abroad and deducts the money multinational companies move out of the country, is higher than the Czech one. Old-age pensions are more or less at the same level in both countries, and the consumption per capita is slightly higher in Slovakia. However, salaries are 10 percent lower on average in Slovakia than in the Czech Republic&quot;.

However, Martin Filko, the head of the Institute of Financial Policy of the Slovak Finance Ministry, pointed out that Slovakia is among the EU countries whose salaries form the lowest portion of their GDP. In other words, some of people&#x27;s incomes come from sources other than their main employment, which reduces the real difference between the Czech and the Slovak salaries.

Until 2005, the GDP of the two countries was growing at a similar rate. However, from 2005 to 2008, the Slovak economy grew faster than the Czech economy.

===Citizenship===

Since federalisation in 1968, Czechoslovakia had divided citizenship, either of the Czech Socialist Republic or of the Slovak Socialist Republic, the word Socialist being dropped from both names shortly after the Velvet Revolution. That distinction, however, had little effect on citizens&#x27; life. On January 1, 1993, all Czechoslovak citizens automatically became citizens either of the Czech Republic or the Slovak Republic, based on their previous citizenship, permanent residence address, birthplace, family ties, job and other criteria. Additionally, people had one year&#x27;s time to claim the other citizenship under certain conditions.

Slovak legislation allowed dual citizenship until 2010, when it was abolished under the Citizenship Act. Only a handful of people have exercised that right, but its significance is lessened by both nations&#x27; membership in the EU as the freedom of movement for workers, a policy that guarantees EU citizens the right to work and to live anywhere in the Union. In the case of movement between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the policy took effect from 2004.

By contrast, the Czech Republic has prohibited dual citizenship for naturalized citizens and requires them to give up existing citizenship(s) prior to receiving citizenship of the Czech Republic. That requirement can be waived only if giving up an existing citizenship might put the applicant or their relatives in danger of persecution in their homeland, which was not the case of applicants from Slovakia. That situation changed with the new Citizenship Act of 2013 (186/2013 Sb.), in force since January 1, 2014. However, most Slovak citizens are still unable to become dual citizens of both the Czech Republic and Slovakia since they automatically lose Slovak citizenship upon voluntarily acquiring another one (see previous paragraph). Exempt from that law are only Slovak citizens who obtain a foreign citizenship by virtue of marriage with a foreign national. Some Slovak politicians have speculated in the media about softening the Citizenship Act, but no change has yet materialised as of January 2015.

Citizens of both countries were allowed to cross the border using an ID card instead of a passport and were allowed to work anywhere without the need to obtain an official permit. Border checks were completely removed on December 21, 2007, when both countries joined the Schengen Agreement.

Under the current European regulations, citizens of either country are entitled to the diplomatic protection of any other EU country and so both have been considering merging their embassies, together with nations of the Visegrád Group, to reduce costs.

====Roma people====
One of the problems not solved during dissolution was the question of a large number of Romani living in the Czech Republic born and officially registered in today&#x27;s Slovakia. Most of them did not re-register their official place of stay during the months before dissolution and so the question of their citizenship was left open. The 1992 Czech Nationality Act allowed a grant of automatic citizenship only to those who were born on Czech territory. For others, the right to citizenship required proof of a five-year period of residence, an &quot;unobjectionable&quot; criminal record, significant fees and a complicated bureaucratic process, which reportedly excluded a rather large percentage of Roma.

The Slovak government did not want to grant citizenship to nonresidents. Significant numbers of Roma living in Czech orphanages did not have their legal status clarified and were released from care as adult noncitizens without any right to work or live in the Czech Republic. Under pressure from the European Union, the Czech government made amendments to its nationality law in 1999 and 2003, which effectively solved the problem, but compensation has not been provided to those rendered stateless in 1992.

===Language contacts===

In the former Czechoslovakia, the first television channel was a federal one, and the Czech and Slovak languages were used in equal ratios in the television news there, but foreign films and television series were almost exclusively dubbed into Czech, for example. That and the great similarity of the two languages made almost all people of both nations passively bilingual: they could understand but not necessarily speak the other language. After the dissolution in 1990s, the new television channels in the Czech Republic practically stopped using Slovak, and young Czech people now have a much lower understanding of Slovak. Also, the number of Slovak-language books and newspapers sold in the Czech Republic dropped drastically. The Czech television news, however, started to reintroduce Slovak-language coverage from Slovakia and Slovak television (STV2) rebroadcasts the Czech television newscast &quot;Události ČT&quot; daily, ten minutes after midnight.

On the public Radio and Television of Slovakia, it is common to have at least one daily newscast from the Czech Republic during prime time news. Furthermore, many programmes on Slovak television channels are still dubbed into Czech, some films in cinemas are subtitled in Czech and there are far more Czech-language books and periodicals on the market than there were before the dissolution. The major boost for the language interchange has come from private television channel providers like CS Link (Czech Republic) and Sky Link (Slovakia) that offer Slovak channels in the Czech Republic and vice versa. Additionally, several channels, regardless of their national origin, offer programs both in Czech and Slovak (CSFilm, TV Barrandov) or even mix like TV Nova&#x27;s Nova Sport coverage of the English Premier League. New impulses to mutual contacts coming via television are also common shows like the Intelligence Test of Nations, Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Got Talent, and Masked Singer broadcast by PRIMA and TV JOJ, and Czecho-Slovak SuperStar, the latter being the first international edition of the Pop Idol song contest broadcast by TV Nova and Markíza (both owned by CME), which also organized joint versions of MasterChef and The Voice in 2012. Also, the New Year&#x27;s Eve Program for 2009 was prepared and broadcast jointly by ČT and STV and for 2010 by the Czech TV PRIMA and the Slovak TV JOJ, this time even including the singing of the Czechoslovak national anthem.

Young Slovak people still have the same knowledge of Czech as their predecessors, if not better. In Slovakia, Czech may still be used automatically in all judicial proceedings, and all documents written in Czech are acknowledged by Slovak authorities and vice versa. Further, the Slovak Official Language Act, passed in 2009, reconfirmed the right of Czechs to use their language in all official communication when dealing with Slovak authorities although it explicitly limited the use of Czech in Slovakia to persons with Czech as their mother tongue. The same is true about using Slovak in the Czech Republic under the Administration Procedure Act of 2004. Gustáv Slamečka, a Slovak citizen who was the Czech transport minister (2009–2010), used only Slovak exclusively during his official communication.

===Sport===
The official breakup occurred right in the middle of the 1993 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, which took place in Sweden. The team representing Czechoslovakia was renamed &quot;Czech–Slovak&quot; on January 1. In international ice hockey tournaments, the Czech Republic took over Czechoslovakia&#x27;s place in the A-groups, and Slovakia had to start in the lower divisions.

During the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1993 in Falun, Sweden, the ski jumping team competed as a combined Czech–Slovakia team in the team large hill event and won silver. The team had been selected before the dissolution. Jaroslav Sakala won two medals in the individual hill events for the Czech Republic at those games along with his silver in the team event.

In their qualifying section for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the Czechoslovakia national football team competed under the name RCS, which stood for &quot;Representation of Czechs and Slovaks&quot;. In their last game as &quot;Representation of Czechs and Slovaks&quot;, the team failed to qualify after it got only a draw in its final match against Belgium, a match that it had to win to qualify. It was afterward that it was officially split up into Czech and Slovak national teams, with both being declared successors to Czechoslovakia.

The mutual encounters between the national teams of both countries in many sports are followed by most of the populations, and the number of players and coaches active in the other republic is significant. Martin Lipták, a Slovak handball coach, successfully led the Czech national team to the EHF 2010 Handball European Championship in Austria. A Slovak team under his coaching, Tatran Prešov, won the Czech national league in 2008 and 2009. Czech ice hockey coach Vladimír Vůjtek led the Slovak national team to the silver medal at the 2012 IIHF World Championship, having beaten the Czech team in the semifinals.

Several sports have featured a common league, and discussions about having a common football or ice hockey league continue.

The road cyclist Ján Svorada earned Slovak citizenship in 1993. In 1994, he became the first Slovak rider ever to win a Tour de France stage. Two years later, he earned Czech citizenship, and he became the first Czech rider ever to win another Tour de France stage in 1998.

===Telecommunications===
The two successor states continued to use the country code +42 until February 1997, when it was replaced by two separate codes: +420 for the Czech Republic and +421 for Slovakia. Since then, telephone calls between both countries have required international dialing.

==Legacy==
===Referendum controversy===
Soon after the dissolution, public contentment was at relatively low levels with high shares of the population on both sides of the border protesting the fact that the dissolution of the common state was not put towards a vote, as described by politologist Lubomír Kopeček of Masaryk University. A March 1993 study conducted by Martin Bútora and his wife Zora indicated that in case of a referendum about 50% of the population would&#x27;ve voted against the dissolution of the state with only about 30% in favour of the dissolution.

Former Slovak Minister of Culture Marek Maďarič, pointed out, in January 2023, that the dissolution without a referendum reflected the historic practice and a tradition of constitutional stately affairs decided without a referendum in Czechoslovak history. Namely, both the formation of the First Czechoslovak Republic from the rubbles of Austria-Hungary in 1918 as well as the reunion of the Protectorate and Slovak State to form a Third Republic in 1945 after the conclusion of the World War II were achieved without a referendum, solely through the pursuit of political representatives of the era.

===Public polling===
Public perception of the dissolution has not changed much, with a December 2017 poll showing that just 42% of Czechs and 40% of Slovaks agree with what happened (compared to 36% and 37% in 1992, respectively). Surveys from 2010 showed that the majority of the population of Prague (Czechs) still considers the division of the country a mistake; similarly, the general representative survey in Slovakia (from 2008) showed that society is still divided in opinion on the dissolution, with 47% favouring the dissolution and 44% considering it a mistake. A 2023 poll from the Czech republic has shown that 50% of Czechs consider the dissolution a correct decision, 39% consider it wrong and 11% are neutral or undecided.

===Reactionary movements===
In 2015, a Slovak movement called &quot;Czechoslovakia 2018&quot; was established to try to get a referendum by 2018. Its leader, Ladislav Zelinka, said that he had received thousands of emails and calls from supporters, but it was unable to reach the necessary 350,000 petition signatures. The younger generations of both countries are largely indifferent to the issue since they never experienced the previous period themselves, and older generations are more focused on present issues such as immigration and favour their own separate nationalism.

===Governmental cooperation===
Political influences between the countries are minimal, but social democrats tend to cooperate very closely on regional and European topics in recent years. Furthermore, it has become customary that the elected presidents pay their first and last official foreign visits during their term to the other republic of the former Czechoslovakia. Appointed foreign ministers tend to follow that unwritten rule. On October 29, 2012, to commemorate Czechoslovakia&#x27;s declaration of independence, which occurred on October 28, 1918, the Czech and the Slovak governments held, for the first time, a joint cabinet meeting in the communities of Trenčín and Uherské Hradiště, near the common border.

===Military cooperation===
Peacekeeping troops stationed in the former Yugoslavia were put under joint command on several occasions. For example, from 2002 to July 2005, the Czech Armed Forces joined with the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic to form a joint Czech–Slovak KFOR battalion in Kosovo, which contributed to the Multinational Brigade CENTRE.

===Trade and tourism===
Trade relations were re-established and stabilised, and the Czech Republic continues to be Slovakia&#x27;s most important business partner. After a short interruption, Slovakia&#x27;s resorts in the Carpathian mountains, especially High Tatras and Low Tatras are again the destination of a growing number of Czech tourists.

===Commemorations===
Following the death of the last Czechoslovak (and the first Czech) president, Václav Havel, on December 18, 2011, both the Czech Republic and Slovakia observed a day of national mourning. During the funeral mass in Prague&#x27;s St. Vitus Cathedral, prayers were recited in an equal ratio in Czech and Slovak.

<text>To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar is a 1995 American road comedy film directed by Beeban Kidron and starring Wesley Snipes, Patrick Swayze, and John Leguizamo as three New York City drag queens who embark on a road trip. Its title refers to an iconic autographed photo of Julie Newmar they carry with them on their journey. Newmar also has a cameo appearance in the film as herself.

The film was released on September 8, 1995, and held the number one spot in the North American box office for two weeks with a worldwide gross of $47.8 million. Critical response was mixed, with particular criticism towards the plot and its familiar elements, but the performances of Swayze, Snipes, and Leguizamo were lauded. At the 53rd Golden Globe Awards, Swayze was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, and Leguizamo was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture.

==Plot==
After tying for the win in New York City&#x27;s &quot;Drag Queen of the Year&quot; contest, Noxeema Jackson and Vida Boheme win a trip to Hollywood to take part in the even bigger &quot;Miss Drag Queen of America Pageant&quot;. Before they depart, Vida persuades Noxeema to take along the inexperienced &quot;drag princess&quot; Chi-Chi Rodriguez as their protégé (they initially refer to him simply as a &quot;boy in a dress&quot; rather than as a full-fledged drag queen). To do this, they cash in their plane tickets to a friend, John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt (a &quot;Camp&quot; name, which in reality is the title of a song), and use the money to buy a yellow convertible 1967 Cadillac DeVille. They set off for Los Angeles in it, carrying with them an iconic autographed photo of Julie Newmar (signed &quot;To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar&quot;) that Vida took from a restaurant wall.

While on the road, they are pulled over by Sheriff Dollard, who hurls racial slurs then forces Vida out of the car and tries to rape her. Vida strikes him, and he is knocked unconscious. He is presumed dead, and the queens drive off. At a rest stop, they recover from the incident, but their car breaks down. Bobby Ray, a young man from the nearby small town of Snydersville, happens to pass by and gives them a ride to a bed and breakfast inn. The inn is owned by Carol Ann and her abusive car repairman husband, Virgil.

They are stranded in the town for the weekend waiting for the replacement part for their car. Chi-Chi is harassed by a group of rednecks but is saved by Bobby Ray. While volunteering to help with the town&#x27;s Strawberry Social, they decide the town&#x27;s women need a day with them getting their hair done, picking out new outfits, and talking in a café. While searching for the new outfits, they are ecstatic to find vintage fashions from the 1960s in the town&#x27;s clothing store and give the female residents (and themselves) a makeover.

Following their makeover, they are abused by the same rednecks that attempted to harass Chi-Chi. Fed up, Noxeema handles the situation in a typically New York City manner and teaches their ringleader a lesson in manners. Vida, Noxeema, and Chi-Chi do what they can to be positive, and they set out to improve the lives of the townspeople, including offering assistance in organizing the Strawberry Social. Meanwhile, Sheriff Dollard is ridiculed by his colleagues, who believe he was beaten up by a girl. He goes in search of the drag queens.

Vida becomes acutely aware of Carol Ann&#x27;s abuse at the hands of Virgil and, one night, decides to intervene, beating Virgil up before throwing him out of the house. Carol Ann is able to repair their car, but they remain for the Strawberry Social. Carol Ann reveals to Vida that she knew she was a drag queen all along due to her Adam&#x27;s apple.

Virgil runs into Sheriff Dollard at a bar, and they realize that the newcomers are the same people Dollard has been searching for. They head back to Snydersville, and Dollard demands that the townspeople turn them over. The other townspeople, who now realize that their new friends are not women, devise a ruse to protect them. One by one, they confront Dollard, each one claiming to be a drag queen (in a similar fashion to &quot;Spartacus&quot;). Dollard is humiliated and flees. The Strawberry Social commences with everyone dressed in vibrant red outfits. The townspeople then say goodbye to Noxeema, Vida, and Chi-Chi as they prepare to leave. In honor of their friendship, Vida gives Carol Ann the autographed photo of Julie Newmar that has accompanied them on their trip.

They eventually make it to Los Angeles where Chi-Chi, after having received many tips from Vida and Noxeema during their ordeal, wins the title of Drag Queen of the Year. The crown is presented by Julie Newmar herself.

==Cast==
===Cameo appearances===
==Production==
===Development===
Writer Douglas Carter Beane originally envisioned the script as a stage play but changed his mind when he realized putting a car on stage might not work. Beane was inspired by an anti-gay propaganda film called &quot;The Gay Agenda&quot;. Of that film, Beane said, &quot;There&#x27;s a scene where they show drag queens going through a town, and the narrator is warning the viewers that these people will take over your town, and I thought, &quot;Well, that would be fun&quot;.&quot;

The script found its way to Mitch Kohn, then a development executive at Amblin Entertainment. Kohn passed the script along to his boss Steven Spielberg, who &quot;loved it&quot;. Spielberg had his friend Robin Williams do a humorous cold reading of the script while on a plane, which &quot;mesmerized&quot; the director. Williams expressed interest in a possible role but did not want to distract from the three leads, so he opted for a small cameo appearance.

When the script officially went into development at Amblin, multiple unnamed male directors passed on directing. British director Beeban Kidron begged Spielberg to let her direct, and he accepted. Though advertising companies wanted to change the film&#x27;s title to the shorter &quot;Ladies&#x27; Night&quot; or &quot;She&#x27;s a Lady&quot;, Beane&#x27;s script managed to keep the original title, which came from an autographed picture of Julie Newmar that Beane saw on the wall of a Times Square Chinese restaurant in the mid-1980s. Beane said Wong Foo is meant to be a metaphor for God, &quot;because you have to thank God for everything. You have to be grateful for life. You just have to stop where you are and say thank you for everything.&quot; A scene was filmed where the characters provide more context, but it was deleted.

=== Casting ===
When it came to casting the leading men, Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo (for whom the role of Chi-Chi Rodriguez was specifically written) both immediately said yes. Many actors were considered for the role of Vida Boheme, including Robert Downey Jr., William Baldwin, Gary Oldman, Matthew Broderick, James Spader, John Cusack, Mel Gibson, Robert Sean Leonard, Willem Dafoe, John Turturro, Matt Dillon, Rob Lowe, Johnny Depp, Tom Cruise, and Robin Williams (who has a brief cameo in the finished film). Patrick Swayze was one of the last actors to audition for Vida. Director Beeban Kidron said that it was ultimately Swayze&#x27;s walk that sealed the deal, saying &quot;Swayze had his own makeup people transform him into a woman, and he insisted that he and Beeban take a walk around the city to prove he could pass as a woman&quot; and &quot;With his beauty and dancer&#x27;s grace, he did just that. He had the job.&quot;

The film featured dozens of New York City&#x27;s drag performers and underground stars in small roles or as featured extras. Included in the mix were RuPaul, Joey Arias, Lady Bunny, Miss Understood, Candis Cayne, Flotilla DeBarge, Miss Coco Peru, Lady Catiria, and Quentin Crisp. The three lead actors spent time in the local drag scene while researching their roles and were each given a drag mentor to work with in developing their characters. Costume designer Marlene Stewart had the leads&#x27; wardrobes, including the shoes and corsets, custom-made.

=== Filming ===
Filming took place from July to October 1994. The drag contest seen in the beginning scene was filmed at Webster Hall in New York City. The John Shaffer Phipps Estate in Old Westbury, New York, now known as Old Westbury Gardens, was the site of the Miss Drag Queen USA contest at the end of the film. Film locations in New Jersey included Jersey City (site of the Canton Restaurant in which the opening restaurant scenes were shot) and Montclair. Much of the film was shot on location in Nebraska in the areas of Loma, Lincoln, and Omaha. Though greatly faded, a &quot;Welcome to Snydersville&quot; outdoor mural remains in Loma.

In interviews and recollections with actors and crew after the film, the production of &quot;To Wong Foo&quot; has been described as &quot;a tough shoot&quot;, partly due to the discomfort the male leads experienced with their extensive makeup and costumes. On location filming and a 4½-month-long shoot also contributed to friction among cast and crew.

Kidron was pregnant when she accepted the directing job. As her due date drew nearer, Spielberg offered to step in and direct for her if needed. Kidron ultimately completed principal photography and gave birth immediately after filming wrapped.

A scene involving the drag trio dining at a McDonald&#x27;s was scrapped after the company told producers they did not want to be associated with drag queen culture. Coca-Cola agreed to product placement, and a billboard for the soda company is featured in a prominent scene in the film.

The Australian film &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot; was released in 1994 and became an international and critical hit. &quot;To Wong Foo&quot; shares certain plot details with &quot;Priscilla&quot;, which also concerns two drag queens and a transgender woman on a road trip who manage to win over the locals of a small town. Despite the similarities, &quot;To Wong Foo&quot; had already been in production by the time &quot;Priscilla&quot; was released. The crew of &quot;Priscilla&quot; had heard about the film while shooting their own, and though a producer was initially worried the films might be too similar, after reading &quot;To Wong Foo&quot;&#x27;s script, producers decided it was sufficiently different from &quot;Priscilla.&quot; The success of &quot;Priscilla&quot;, along with the popularity of drag queens like RuPaul and the 1990 documentary &quot;Paris Is Burning&quot;, is credited with helping pave the way for &quot;To Wong Foo&quot;.

==Music==

The film&#x27;s soundtrack was released on August 29, 1995. It consists of eleven tracks:

Music and songs not included in the soundtrack:

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;To Wong Foo&quot; was released wide in North American theaters on September 8, 1995. It opened at the number-one position with $9 million and remained at the top in its second week with a gross of $6.5 million. Its lifetime box-office gross revenue totaled worldwide. Professional golfer Chi-Chi Rodríguez sued the production company and distributor over the use of his name in the film, eventually settling on undisclosed terms.

===Home media===
The film was released on VHS after its theatrical release and on DVD on January 7, 2003, with several deleted scenes. It was released as a special collector&#x27;s edition Blu-ray by Shout! Factory on May 28, 2019. The edition includes the behind-the-scenes documentary &quot;Easy Rider in Dresses: A Look Back at the Making of To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar&quot;, which features interviews with screenwriter Douglas Carter Beane, director Beeban Kidron, and John Leguizamo. In Sweden the film was titled &quot;High Heels&quot; and released in May 1996 on VHS.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 48% based on 46 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar&quot; seeks to celebrate individuality, but is too timid and predictable to achieve its admittedly noble aims.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 60 based on reviews from 24 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B+&quot; on scale of A to F.

Though critical reviews were mixed, the performances of the three leads were roundly praised. Joe Brown of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;fiercely funny&quot; and wrote, &quot;Three snaps up for Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo, who walk the walk, and work it.&quot; Emanuel Levy of &quot;Variety&quot; gave a mixed review but wrote, &quot;Sporting blond wigs, Snipes admirably wiggles his hips while wearing high-heeled red shoes. Using a low register, Swayze also excels as a man still suffering from parental rejection. Shining throughout is the brilliant Leguizamo, as the Latino spitfire who needs to prove to his comrades that he&#x27;s more than &#x27;a mere boy in a dress.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote, &quot;What is amazing is how the movie manages to be funny and amusing while tippy-toeing around (a) sex, (b) controversy and (c) any originality in the plot. Credit for that belongs to Swayze, Snipes and Leguizamo, who are surprisingly good at playing drag queens.&quot; While Ebert gave the film stars out of four, his colleague Gene Siskel gave a more positive review and predicted an Oscar nomination for Swayze.

Multiple critics pointed out the film&#x27;s similarities to &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot; and said &quot;To Wong Foo&quot; was subpar in comparison due to the predictability of its plot, script and tonal unevenness. The decision to have the leads spend most of the film in drag, even going to bed in their wigs and makeup, was also criticized as straining credulity. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote screenwriter Beane and director Kidron &quot;don&#x27;t seem to know any way to emphasize the humanity of their characters except by swaddling them in mushy cliches&quot;. Actor and writer Michael Kearns argued the film and its promotion is &quot;eager to wink and snicker at homosexuality&quot;. The film&#x27;s omission of &quot;any hint of gay sexuality&quot; was noted by Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, as well as Brown of the &quot;Post&quot;, who decried the fact that &quot;always in the (admittedly few) mainstream movies with gay characters, [the film&#x27;s] hero-ines&quot; do not get to partake in the film&#x27;s romantic story arcs, and appear to only function as asexual fairy godmothers for the townspeople of Snydersville.

In a positive review, Edward Guthmann of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s a distant cry from the reality of gay bashings, poverty and evictions that real-life drag queens suffer—which may be part of its point. Imagine, &quot;Wong Foo&quot; suggests, a world where people stopped judging one another and simply surrendered to the silliness that&#x27;s dormant inside us.&quot;

&quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;″s Alison Macor shared a similar sentiment, writing that while the film&#x27;s sentimentality may go too far for some, &quot;To Wong Foo&quot; &quot;is such a delight that it&#x27;s easy to overlook the few awkward moments&quot;, adding, &quot;The film camps it up but still allows us to believe in the characters.&quot;

Emanuel Levy concluded though the film &quot;is not as outrageous or funny as [&quot;Priscilla&quot;]...it still offers some rewards as mainstream entertainment&quot; and that &quot;ultimately, the comedy comes across as a celebration of openness, alternative lifestyles and bonding, all life-affirming values that in the 1990s are beyond reproach—or real controversy&quot;.

===Accolades===
Swayze and Leguizamo were nominated at the 1996 Golden Globe Awards, for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and Best Supporting Actor, respectively.

The film was nominated for Outstanding Film at the 1996 GLAAD Media Awards.

=== Legacy ===
&quot;To Wong Foo&quot; is considered groundbreaking for being the first mainstream Hollywood production to depict drag queens. Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that in comparison to previous films that featured cross-dressing like &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; or &quot;Tootsie&quot;, &quot;The heroines [in &quot;To Wong Foo&quot;] aren&#x27;t cross-dressing to escape the mob or to prove a point, they&#x27;re just being true to their nature.&quot;

In a 2019 retrospective piece about the film, writer Naveen Kumar noted &quot;the film&#x27;s language and understanding of gender variance is undoubtedly limited as a product of its time&quot; and that the film &quot;[blended] iterations of queer experience that tend to have clearer distinctions in the real world, and for which we have more nuanced language today&quot;. Among the film&#x27;s language and concepts that are now considered problematic is the terminology used by the characters to describe the differences in queer identities.

Of the leads being in drag for the duration of the film, some critics said this was an intentional part of the film&#x27;s camp element. Kumar added, &quot;That &quot;To Wong Foo&quot;″s drag performances remain completely unbroken throughout the film&#x27;s entirety heightens the movie&#x27;s extreme emphasis on beauty and artifice&quot; and that the film is very &quot;conscious of its ironies [as] Swayze and Snipes were both box-office draws known for hypermasculine and romantic leading roles; the perceived incongruity of dressing them in drag is part of what fuels the comedy&quot;. In this way, Kumar wrote, &quot;&quot;To Wong Foo&quot; plays on viewers&#x27; suspension of disbelief (Swayze and Snipes, in particular, are clearly recognizable under their women&#x27;s garb)&quot; and that the &quot;movie&#x27;s own characterizations tend to blur the lines between drag as a conscious performance and their desire to actually be seen, day and night, as women&quot;.

Of the characters staying in drag, Douglas Carter Beane said his intent was to create an illusion, saying, &quot;It is about fantasy and the illusion. It&#x27;s about the work that goes into the art form. It was never meant to be an absolutely truthful documentary look at drag.&quot; Candis Cayne, who appears in the film, said its fantasy element can also be seen as problematic, &quot;[perpetuating] an idea that transgender identity is nothing but make-believe&quot;. Drag queen Alaska Thunderfuck said that what the film does best is &quot;the camaraderie between the girls... the way they look out for each other and protect one another. The movie also illustrates the transformative power of drag. It helps people become empowered, no matter where they come from or what kind of life they lead&quot;.

==Musical==
In 2017, it was announced that Douglas Carter Beane and his husband Lewis Flinn were working on a musical adaptation for Broadway. In an interview, Beane stated that he had originally written &quot;To Wong Foo&quot; for the stage and had retained stage rights when the screenplay was produced. The musical premiered at the Hope Mill Theatre in Manchester on October 21, 2023.

<text>Melbourne Central railway station is a commuter railway station on the Burnley, Caulfield, Clifton Hill and Northern group lines, serving the Melbourne CBD in Victoria, Australia. Melbourne Central is an underground premium station on the City Loop, featuring four platforms, two island platforms on two floors connected to street level by a shopping and commercial precinct. It opened on 24 January 1981, with station refurbishments underway as of June 2024.

Initially opened as Museum, the station was given its current name of Melbourne Central on 16 February 1996, after the Melbourne Central Shopping Centre, which it is beneath.

The station is located under La Trobe Street, between Swanston and Elizabeth Streets, on the northern edge of the central business district (CBD). It feeds into Melbourne&#x27;s main metro network station, Flinders Street, and also Southern Cross, Melbourne&#x27;s main regional terminus. In 2023-24, it was the third-busiest station on the Melbourne metropolitan rail network, with 11.177 million passengers.

== History ==
The station was built using cut and cover construction. In December 1973, to permit excavation of the station, La Trobe Street and its tram tracks were temporarily relocated to the south, onto the site of what is now the Melbourne Central Shopping Centre, and moved back on completion of the work in 1978. The pit was long and wide, deep at the Swanston Street end and deep at the Elizabeth Street end. Seven layers of struts were used to support the excavation, with 2,600 tonnes of steel temporary supports required.

The station was designed by architectural firm Perrott Lyon Mathieson, with initial layout by associate David Simpson, followed by detailed design by Graeme Butler. The design included the two pairs of platforms, a spacious concourse directly under La Trobe Street, with entries facing the Elizabeth Street and Swanston Street corners. The Swanston Street corner included a set of raised circular platforms above the entry; during a Royal Visit, Queen Elizabeth was shown around the not yet operational station on 28 May 1980, and unveiled a plaque naming it the Queen Elizabeth Plaza.

The station was finally opened on 24 January 1981, and opened as Museum, after the adjacent National Museum of Victoria and Science Museum of Victoria, in the State Library of Victoria complex on the opposite side of Swanston Street. It was the first station to open on the City Loop. Initially, the station was only used by trains on the Burnley and Caulfield groups, using platforms 2 and 4, with services from the Clifton Hill group beginning to use platform 1 on 31 October 1982, and trains from the Northern group beginning to use platform 3 on 1 May 1984. The Elizabeth Street entrance to the station opened on 5 April 1982.

The adjoining Melbourne Central Shopping Centre opened in 1991, being built around the existing escalators to street level, with only minor integration between the station concourse and shopping centre. The station was renamed after the shopping centre on 16 February 1997, and a few months later on 13 July, the National Museum of Victoria closed at the State Library site, in preparation for its relocation to Carlton, where it reopened as the Melbourne Museum in 2000.

The station concourse was extensively redeveloped in 2002/2003, as part of a redevelopment of the shopping centre, integrating it into the complex. The direct escalators from the concourse to Swanston Street closed in November 2003, and were replaced by escalators rising into the atrium under the cone in the centre of the shopping centre, making the path for rail passengers more convoluted. The concourse under La Trobe Street was integrated into the shopping centre with the installation of numerous shops.

In 2025, as part of the Metro Tunnel project, the Pakenham, Cranbourne and Sunbury lines will cease to stop at Melbourne Central. However, they will use the connected State Library station when it opens with the Metro Tunnel.

== Facilities ==
Melbourne Central has an underground concourse and two levels of platforms below it (2 island platforms with four faces and tracks). Each platform serves a separate group of rail lines that leave the Loop and radiate out into the city&#x27;s suburbs. At peak times, with a train arriving every 2.5 minutes, the station has a passenger flow of 30,000 per hour. Three elevators were initially provided, as well as 21 escalators. Melbourne Central is a premium station, meaning that it is staffed from first to last train and provides extra customer services.

The concourse has two sections separated by the shopping centre food court:

* The Elizabeth Street concourse has stairs and three escalators providing access to the street, a walkway to the Swanston Street concourse, a booking office, ticket barriers, toilets, and stairs and five escalators leading down to the platforms.
* The Swanston Street concourse was altered in the early 2000s, when redevelopment works were carried out at the adjacent Melbourne Central Shopping Centre. Inside the ticket barriers there are toilets, and two lifts and five escalators going to the platforms. Outside is a food court, an exit to La Trobe Street and Level LG of the shopping centre (which passes under Little Lonsdale Street). There is also a lift and four escalators to the shopping centre level above. On the next level up (Level G), there is access to Little Lonsdale and La Trobe Streets via the shopping centre. Access to Swanston Street is via three escalators rising another floor (or the lift to Level 1 and a walk), and a walk through the shopping centre past the shot tower.

<doc id="873034" wikidata="Q7805905" url="?curid=873034" title="Timeline of SCO–Linux disputes">
<text>Beginning in 2003, The SCO Group was involved in a dispute with various Linux vendors and users. SCO initiated a series of lawsuits, the most known of which were &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; and &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot;, that had implications upon the futures of both Linux and Unix. SCO claimed that Linux violated some of SCO&#x27;s intellectual properties. Many industry observers were skeptical of SCO&#x27;s claims, and they were strongly contested by SCO&#x27;s opponents in the lawsuits, some of which launched counter-claims. By 2011, the lawsuits fully related to Linux had been lost by SCO or rendered moot and SCO had gone into bankruptcy. However the &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; suit continued for another decade, as it included contractual disputes related to both companies&#x27; involvement in Project Monterey in addition Linux-related claims. Finally in 2021 a settlement was reached in which IBM paid the bankruptcy trustee representing what remained of SCO the sum of $14.25 million.

==Timeline==
;June 2002
:On 27 June 2002, Caldera International has a change in management, with Darl McBride, formerly an executive with Novell, FranklinCovey, and several start-ups, taking over as CEO from Ransom Love. Caldera International had completed its purchase of Unix assets from The Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) the previous year. From the start of his time as CEO, McBride considers the possibility of claiming ownership of some of the code within Linux.
;August 2002
:On August 26, 2002, Caldera International changes its name back to SCO, in the form of the new name The SCO Group.
;October 2002
:McBride creates an internal organization &quot;to formalize the licensing of our intellectual property&quot;.

;January 2003
:SCO retains lawyer David Boies, announcing that they would be investigating infringement on their intellectual property pertaining to their ownership of UNIX. Over the next several months, the executives of SCO issue a number of press releases and public statements alleging unspecified violations of their UNIX intellectual property rights in Linux. They also begin to raise questions of the validity of the GPL.
;March 2003
:In &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot;, SCO sues IBM over its contributions to Linux, claiming that IBM stole UNIX trade secrets and gave them to Linux kernel developers. The suit was filed originally in the Utah State Court, but was immediately removed to Federal Court.
;May 2003
:The SCO Group says they sent letters to 1,500 of the world&#x27;s largest corporations, including the Fortune 500 companies, alleging that the use of Linux may infringe a copyright they hold on the original UNIX source code. They say that the Linux kernel, the core of the operating system contains copyrighted SCO source code. In this letter they also announce the suspension of their own Linux-related activities.
;July 2003
:The SCO Group files an amended complaint.
;August 2003
:SCO announces that they intend to issue invoices to companies using Linux.
:In &quot;Red Hat v. SCO&quot;, Red Hat files suit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware asking for a permanent injunction blocking SCO from asserting that Red Hat infringed on SCO&#x27;s intellectual property with their Linux product. 
:IBM files its counterclaims, alleging that SCO has violated the GPL, several patents, and the Lanham Act by falsely accusing IBM of violating SCO&#x27;s IP rights.
;September 2003
:SCO CEO, Darl McBride, writes an open letter to the free software community. In this letter he accuses the free software community of being responsible for recent DDoS attacks on the SCO website and once again asserts that Linux violates SCO&#x27;s intellectual properties.
:IBM files amended counterclaims, including a claim of copyright infringement.
;October 2003
:BayStar Capital and Royal Bank of Canada invest $US50 million in SCO to support the legal cost of the SCOsource program.
:SCO announces that it would not attempt invoicing Linux users after being threatened with mail fraud.
;December 2003
:SCO sends a letter to all Unix licensees asking them to certify certain questions regarding the use of Linux.
:SCO sends a letter claiming ownership of the Linux ABI code.

;January 2004
:SCO sends a letter to the United States Congress, raising issues such as the economics of open source development and the legality of the GPL.
:In, &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot;, SCO files slander of title suit against Novell.
;February 2004
:The SCO Group becomes the target of the Mydoom computer worm, which was programmed to launch a denial of service attack on the company&#x27;s website beginning on February 1, 2004. The Group has also been the subject of a Google bomb campaign. Google returns SCO&#x27;s website as the number one hit for the phrase &quot;litigious bastards.&quot;
:SCO files a second amended complaint against IBM. It drops the trade secret claims, but adds claims of copyright infringement.
;March 2004
:In &quot;SCO v. AutoZone&quot;, SCO files suit against AutoZone in Nevada state court.
:In &quot;SCO v. DaimlerChrysler&quot;, SCO files suit against DaimlerChrysler.
:IBM files second amended counterclaims.
;April 2004
:The &quot;Red Hat v. SCO&quot; case is stayed until resolution of the &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; case.
;May 2004
:IBM files a motion for partial summary judgment on a claim for declaratory judgment of non-infringement. This would confirm that IBM has not infringed on any SRVx code in its Linux activities.
;June 2004
:The &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot; case is dismissed due to inadequate pleading of special damages. 
;July 2004
:The &quot;SCO v. AutoZone&quot; case is stayed pending the outcome in &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot;.
:All claims in the &quot;SCO v. DaimlerChrysler&quot; case are dismissed except on the matter of breach of section 2.05, in that DC did not submit their response in a timely manner.
:SCO files an amended complaint in &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot;.
;August 2004
:IBM files motion for partial summary judgment on breach of contract claims in &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot;. This judgment would confirm that the AT&amp;T license agreement placed no restrictions on derivative works.
:IBM files motion for partial summary judgment on its counterclaim for copyright infringement in SCO v. IBM. This judgment would find SCO guilty of copyright infringement of IBM&#x27;s contributions to Linux.
:Randall Davis (MIT) files his second declaration on behalf of IBM. In it, he describes his examination of SCO&#x27;s claims of infringement, using both the &quot;COMPARATOR&quot; and &quot;SIM&quot; tools. He concluded that, &quot;Despite an extensive review, I could find no source code in any of the IBM Code [including AIX, Dynix, Linux, or JFS] that incorporates any portion of the source code contained in the Unix System V Code or is in any other manner similar to such source code. Accordingly, the IBM Code cannot be said, in my opinion, to be a modification or a derivative work based on Unix System V Code.&quot;
:Novell files a motion to dismiss.
;December 2004
:&quot;SCO v. DaimlerChrysler&quot; case is dismissed without prejudice based on stipulation of the parties. If SCO wishes to pursue the remaining claim (i.e. whether DaimlerChrysler replied in a timely manner) again, they must pay DaimlerChrysler&#x27;s legal fees from August 9, 2004.
:SCO appeals to Michigan Court of Appeals.

;January, 2005
:SCO&#x27;s appeal of the DaimlerChrysler case is dismissed.
;February, 2005
:IBM&#x27;s motions for partial summary judgment are denied without prejudice, to be refiled after the close of discovery.
;June 2005
:On June 20, expert Brian W. Kernighan filed a declaration on behalf of IBM. He testified that he had performed an analysis of SCO&#x27;s specific claims and that there was no similarity between the portions of Linux identified by SCO and the allegedly copyrighted works.
;July 2005
:On July 1, U.S. Federal Judge Dale A. Kimball denied The SCO Group&#x27;s motion to amend their claim against IBM again (a third amended complaint) and include new claims regarding Monterey on the PowerPC architecture. In the same decision, the five-week jury trial date was set for February 2007.
:Novell files its answer with the court, denying SCO&#x27;s claims. 
:Novell files counterclaims asking the court to force SCO to turn over the revenues it had received from UNIX licenses, less a 5% administrative fee. Additionally, Novell asks the court to place the funds in a &quot;constructive trust&quot; in order to ensure that SCO can pay Novell since the company&#x27;s assets are depleting rapidly.
:On July 14, Groklaw obtained an email from Michael Davidson to SCO Group senior vice president Reginald Broughton sent on August 13, 2002. In it, Davidson describes The Santa Cruz Operation&#x27;s own investigation into whether or not Linux contained proprietary UNIX source code. &quot;At the end, we had found absolutely &quot;nothing&quot;, i.e., no evidence of any copyright infringement whatsoever&quot;, Davidson concluded. At which time SCO presented as evidence an e-mail from a Robert Swartz, a consultant hired by SCO to compare UNIX and Linux source files, that copyright infringement could exist.
;December 2005
:Final deadline passes in &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; to disclose allegedly misused material with specificity. SCO provides IBM with a list of 294 alleged violations.

;January 2006
:SCO files a second amended complaint against Novell. It adds claims of copyright infringement, unfair competition and breach of a non-compete agreement.
;April 2006
:SuSE (now owned by Novell) files an arbitration request with the ICC International Court of Arbitration. It asks to preclude SCO from asserting proprietary rights to any code in Linux.
:Novell files a motion to stay the case pending the resolution of SuSE arbitration.
;May 2006
:SCO and IBM exchange initial expert reports.
;June 2006
:Most of the items on SCO&#x27;s list of allegedly misused material are stricken by the magistrate judge in SCO v. IBM due to lack of specificity.
;November 2006
:On November 29, Judge Kimball affirmed Magistrate Judge Brooke Wells&#x27; June 28, 2006 Order striking most of SCO&#x27;s claimed evidence of code misuse as being too vague to be worth adjudicating. 
;December 2006
:On December 1, Wells ruled from the bench in accepting IBM&#x27;s motion to limit SCO&#x27;s claims to those supported by evidence submitted by December 22, 2005 and not rejected by the court. SCO stock subsequently lost roughly 50% of its value in three days of exceptionally heavy trading.

;April 2007
:SCO brings Pamela Jones of Groklaw into both &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; and &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot; cases. They claim that they have attempted to serve Jones although she denies knowledge of any such attempts.
;August 2007
:On August 10, Judge Dale Kimball issued a ruling in &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot; which found that &quot;Novell is the owner of the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights&quot; and SCO to be in breach of its SVRX licensing agreement with Novell. The ruling also cast further doubt on SCO&#x27;s claims that IBM and Linux infringe against any SCO source code, and upheld Novell&#x27;s right to force SCO to waive its copyright claims against IBM and Sequent. In response, on Monday, August 13, SCO stock fell over 70%, to 44 cents a share.
;September 2007
:The trial in &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot; was due to start on Monday September 17, in order to determine how much money SCO owed Novell. On September 14, SCO Group filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the petition for bankruptcy, all pending litigation was automatically stayed as per U.S.C. § 362. On September 27, NASDAQ issued SCO a notice of potential delisting, under their discretionary authority. SCO appealed this decision, but on September 19, it received another delisting warning for an insufficient bid price. On October 23, SCO announced that they had reached an agreement with York Capital Management. Pending Bankruptcy Court approval, York was to purchase most of SCO&#x27;s business for a total of approximately $36 million, including financing. After Novell, IBM, and the United States Trustee objected to the deal, SCO withdrew the proposed sale on November 20, without prejudice.
;November 2007
:Novell succeeded in getting a court to lift SCO&#x27;s Chapter 11 immunity from legal action and will continue with legal action against SCO.
;December 2007
:SCO stock is delisted from the NASDAQ stock exchange.

;July 2008
:Novell granted award of 2.5 million against SCO.

;August 2009
:On August 24, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit partially reverses summary judgment in SCO v. Novell, deciding that an issue of fact was present that should have been reserved for a trial. It affirmed the judgment on royalties due, while reversing the summary judgments on ownership of UNIX and UnixWare copyrights, SCO&#x27;s claim seeking specific performance, the scope of Novell&#x27;s rights under Section 4.16 of the APA, and the application of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing to Novell&#x27;s rights under Section 4.16 of the APA. The reversed judgments were remanded to trial.
;October 2009
:On October 14, 2009, SCO Group announced that the company had terminated CEO Darl McBride&#x27;s contract.

;March 2010
:The SCO Group&#x27;s case against Novell for slander of title is heard by a jury in Utah, which ruled in favor of Novell. The jury determines that the Unix copyrights never transferred to SCO. A lawyer for SCO responds that the court still needed to rule on whether Novell had the right to waive SCO&#x27;s claims against IBM in a related suit and whether Novell is obligated by the sales contract to transfer the copyright to SCO. And SCO decides to continue the lawsuit against IBM for causing a decline in SCO revenues.
;May 2010
:Remaining issues in &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot; settled by the District Court in favor of Novell and against SCO.
;June 2010
:Judge Ted Stewart decides that SCO is obligated to recognize Novell&#x27;s waiver of SCO&#x27;s purported claims against IBM and Sequent. The Court also judges in favor of Novell and against SCO on SCO&#x27;s claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, ordering the case to be closed.
;December 2010
:SCO files an appeal of &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot;, scheduled to be heard on January 20, 2011.

;April 2011
:Having sold off its operating assets other than the lawsuits, The SCO Group, Inc. then renames itself TSG Group, Inc.
;August 2011
:On August 30, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirms SCO&#x27;s loss to Novell in the second jury/bench trial. SCO&#x27;s appellate brief had argued that there were evidentiary errors and other issues at trial. The affirmed verdict held that Novell did not transfer the UNIX copyrights to SCO in the amended asset purchase agreement, and that Novell has the right to waive certain alleged license violations.

;August 2012
:TSG Group, Inc. files to convert from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to Chapter 7 liquidation stating &quot;There is no reasonable chance of rehabilitation&quot; and that it is looking to reduce bankruptcy costs on itself while continuing to pursue the &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; suit.

;June 2013
:On June 14, 2013, Judge David Nuffer rules on &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; motions, granting SCO&#x27;s motion for reconsideration and reopening the case.

;June 2015
:Magistrate Judge Paul M. Warner was added to the case, to oversee settlement discussions.

;February 2016
:On February 26, 2016, SCO and IBM filed a joint motion for final entry of judgement against SCO. This enables SCO, if it wishes, to appeal the partial summary judgements in favor of IBM. Due to its bankruptcy, its only remaining asset is its right to appeal the failure of its legal claims against IBM.

;October 2017
:On October 30, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit issues a ruling partially in favor of the SCO Group, saying that SCO&#x27;s claims that, as part of Project Monterey, IBM misappropriated SCO&#x27;s proprietary code in relation a &quot;sham&quot; version of Monterrey for IBM AIX for PowerPC, could go forward. The case is remanded to Judge Nuffer in U.S. federal court.

;February 2018
:SCO and IBM restate their remaining claims before Judge Nuffer and discuss a plan to move toward final judgement.

;May 2020
:Magistrate Judge Warner was no longer assigned to overseeing settlement discussions.

;March 2021
:On March 31, 2021 Xinuos, Inc., the company that develops and markets the Unix-based OS&#x27;s previously maintained by SCO, filed a copyright infringement and antitrust lawsuit against International Business Machines Corp. and Red Hat, Inc. in the United States District Court of the Virgin Islands, St. Thomas and St. John Division alleging that IBM and Red Hat, using wrongfully copied software code, have engaged in additional, illegal anti-competitive misconduct to corner the billion-dollar market for Unix and Linux server operating systems. IBM rejected the claims as &quot;without merit&quot; and &quot;defying logic&quot;.

;August 2021
:Word came of a possible final settlement in the &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; case, wherein documents filed in the case indicated that the bankruptcy trustee for TSG Group and IBM appeared to be on the verge of settling the outstanding, Project Monterey-based, claims in the matter for $14.25 million. As part of this, the trustee would give up any future related claims against IBM.

;November 2021
:The settlement was made under those terms, with IBM paying the TSG bankruptcy trustee $14.25 million and the trustee giving up all future claims and with each party paying their own legal costs.

<doc id="873037" wikidata="Q5440668" url="?curid=873037" title="Federally Qualified Health Center">
<text>A Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) is a community-based health care organization that provides comprehensive primary care and support services to underserved populations in the United States. These centers serve patients regardless of immigration status, insurance coverage, or ability to pay. FQHCs are a key component of the nation&#x27;s primary care safety net and aim to reduce barriers to health care access for low/moderate-income and minority populations. The majority of FQHCs are local health centers operated by non-profits, but public agencies, such as municipal governments, also operate clinics, accounting for 7% of all FQHCS. Consumer governance is a defining feature of FQHCs, mandating that at least 51% of governing board members must be patients of the center.

Defined by Medicare and Medicaid statutes, FQHCs include organizations i) receiving grants under Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), ii) clinics meeting certification requirements (known as FQHC &quot;Look-Alikes&quot;), and iii) outpatient facilities operated by tribal or urban Indian organizations. FQHC services, as outlined by Medicare, include rural health clinic services (such as physician services, those provided by physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, visiting nurses, clinical psychologists, social workers, and related services and supplies), diabetes self-management training, medical nutrition therapy, and preventive primary health services mandated under Section 330 of the PHSA.

== History ==
Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) were established in 1965 as part of President Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s War on Poverty to improve health care access in low-income and medically underserved areas.

During the 1980s, local health centers faced challenges in securing reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid due to restrictive state payment rates and eligibility criteria, limiting their financial resources. A major turning point came at the end of the decade with the creation of the Federally Qualified Health Center designation, under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. Introduced for Medicaid in 1989 and Medicare in 1990, this designation allowed HRSA-funded health centers to receive cost-based reimbursement rates. Covered services included those provided by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, clinical psychologists, and clinical social workers. The FQHC designation also introduced &quot;Health Center Program look-alikes,&quot; which meet all HRSA funding requirements under Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act but do not receive direct HRSA funding. These look-alikes are eligible for FQHC reimbursement rates and other benefits available to HRSA-funded centers.

FQHCs demonstrated notable success in delivering high-quality, cost-effective health care to vulnerable populations despite the challenges involved. In recognition of this, Congress permanently authorized the program. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) significantly expanded FQHCs by allocating $11 billion through the Community Health Center Fund between 2011 and 2015, supporting the establishment and expansion of delivery sites. By 2014, the number of FQHCs grew by 82.7% to 6,376, with most new sites in urban areas. A 2019 study shows that new markets were less likely to serve rural or high-poverty populations compared to earlier ones.

FQHCs have evolved into comprehensive medical homes offering person-centered care and addressing disparities among low/moderate-income and minority populations. Federal initiatives, including the Health Center Growth Initiative in 2002, the $11 billion Community Health Center Fund under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and subsequent investments, have further increased the number of FQHC sites to over 8,000, serving approximately 1 in 13 Americans.

In June 2011, the Department of Health and Human Services announced the Federally Qualified Health Center Advanced Primary Care Practice (FQHC APCP) demonstration project. This demonstration project is conducted under the authority of Section 1115A of the Social Security Act, which was added by section 3021 of the ACA and establishes the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (Innovation Center). The CMS and Innovation Center in partnership with HRSA would operate the demonstration. The initiative was designed to evaluate the impact of the advanced primary care practice (APCP) model, also referred to as the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) on improving health, quality of care and lowering the cost of care provided to Medicare beneficiaries.

Before FQHCs were established in the 1980s, structural factors such as redlining-perpetuated segregation, contributing to ongoing inequities in healthcare access for communities that historically faced barriers and were excluded from quality, trustworthy medical services.

== Overview ==
FQHCs adhere to an &quot;open door&quot; policy, offering care regardless of patients&#x27; financial ability to pay, and predominantly serve low-income and uninsured individuals and Medicaid beneficiaries. As defined under Medicare and Medicaid statutes, FQHCs include organizations receiving grants under Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), FQHC Look-Alikes (certified clinics meeting Section 330 requirements but without HRSA funding), and outpatient facilities operated by tribal or urban Indian organizations. These centers provide a range of services, including those offered by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, clinical psychologists, social workers, and other health professionals. They also deliver diabetes self-management training, medical nutrition therapy, and preventive primary health services mandated by Section 330.

FQHCs serve as essential health care providers, offering medical, dental and behavioral health care to individuals irrespective of their insurance status or income. They also address non-financial barriers to health care through enabling services, such as housing support, transportation, and nutritional assistance. FQHCs must comply with standards set by the HRSA, including governance, quality reporting, and operational criteria, and ensure accessibility through a sliding fee scale based on patients&#x27; income. Federal regulations partially determine FQHC locations, requiring them to be situated in medically underserved areas (MUAs) or regions with medically underserved populations. According to the HRSA, MUAs are characterized by a shortage of primary care providers, elevated infant mortality rates, high poverty levels, or a significant elderly population. However, many MUAs lack FQHCs, likely due to insufficient investment at the state and health system levels in developing FQHC networks.

FQHCs are a key recruitment stream of underrepresented biomedical research participants.

== Organization ==
Consumer governance is a defining feature of FQHCs, mandating that at least 51% of governing board members must be patients of the center. According to the HRSA, which administers the FQHC program:&quot;Since the intent is for consumer board members to give substantive input into the health center’s strategic direction and policy, these members should utilize the health center as their principal source of primary health care…[Additionally,] the board should be composed of members with a broad range of skills and expertise. Finance, legal affairs, business, health, managed care, social services, labor relations and government are some examples of the areas of expertise needed by the board to fulfill its responsibilities (Bureau of Primary Health Care 1998a: 22).&quot;This structure, inspired by the participatory democracy ethos of the Civil Rights Movement and a strong sentiment of &quot;antiprofessionalism&quot; aimed at empowering the poor, seeks to make FQHCs more attuned to community needs by amplifying the voices of underrepresented patients. The principle of consumer governance emphasizes that representatives who share key characteristics with those they serve (descriptive representation) are more likely to advocate effectively for their interests (substantive representation). Challenges such as socioeconomic disparities among board members and gaps in the technical expertise needed for governance have complicated its implementation. A 2012 study indicated that while many board members are FQHC patients, a notable portion did not reflect the socioeconomic profile of typical FQHC users. Despite this, FQHCs have achieved a degree of descriptive representation, with approximately 20-25% of board members being representative of the patient population.

Health centers face challenges in care integration, particularly in coordination with hospitals. Federally required governance by independent, community-based boards can impede consolidation with larger health systems, leaving health centers reliant on formal agreements for coordination. Studies suggest that better integration of care processes between hospitals and health centers enhances communication during acute care episodes, but many centers struggle to establish effective notification agreements. Improved electronic health record sharing and health information exchange capabilities could bolster these efforts. Integration levels vary by health center size and market competitiveness, with greater integration activity linked to improved communication during and after inpatient stays and emergency visits. New payment models may provide additional incentives to strengthen care coordination between health centers and hospitals.

== Funding ==
The federal government serves as the primary funder of FQHCs, providing reimbursement through Medicaid and Medicare for comprehensive primary care services. FQHCs are reimbursed by Medicare on a cost-based system, subject to a per-visit payment cap and productivity standards. Payments are made on an all-inclusive per-visit rate, except for certain vaccines, which are reimbursed at cost. Final payment rates are calculated by dividing total allowable costs by the total number of visits, capped by an annual payment limit adjusted by the Medicare Economic Index (MEI) and differentiated between urban and rural centers.

While the majority of FQHCs are operated by non-profits, public agencies, such as municipal governments, also operate clinics. Federal health center grants for public agencies are capped at 5% under Section 330 of the US Public Health Service Act (as of 2022), though the rationale for this limit is unclear. Publicly operated FQHCs, accounting for 7% of all FQHCs, serve 1.8 million patients and receive 5% of federal health center grants. These entities include local health departments, city/county governments, public hospital systems, and universities. Public and private FQHCs serve similar numbers of patients and share comparable proportions of racial/ethnic minorities and individuals below the federal poverty line, although public FQHCs tend to serve a higher proportion of uninsured patients, fewer Medicare patients, and slightly fewer individuals with diabetes and hypertension.

Medicaid is the largest revenue source for FQHCs, but Medicare offers financial incentives, such as higher per-visit fees compared to non-FQHC providers, making FQHC status attractive. Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicare transitioned to a Prospective Payment System (PPS) in 2014, offering additional payments for preventive services and new Medicare patients. With an aging U.S. population, FQHCs are expected to play a growing role in caring for elderly Medicare beneficiaries, particularly those with chronic conditions. Between 2005 and 2014, the number of FQHC patients aged 55–64 and 65–74 increased by 132% and 92%, respectively.

To achieve FQHC certification, health centers must apply for grants from the HRSA Health Center Program. Certified FQHCs often operate multiple delivery sites. Data on FQHC expansion is typically organized by grantee rather than service site, limiting insights into individual delivery locations.

Billions of federal dollars have been allocated through the Affordable Care Act&#x27;s Community Health Center Fund and the American Rescue Plan to establish, expand, and sustain FQHCs nationwide.

==Funded programs==
Health programs funded include:

*Community Health Centers which serve a variety of federally designated Medically Underserved Areas/Populations (MUA or MUP). 
*Migrant Health Centers which provide culturally competent and primary preventive medical care to migrant and seasonal agricultural workers.
*Health Care for the Homeless Programs which reach out to homeless individuals and families and provide primary and preventive care and substance abuse services and
*Public Housing Primary Care Programs that serve residents of public housing and are located in or adjacent to the communities they serve.

== Geographic and demographic reach ==
Throughout the United States, FQHCs are strategically located in high-poverty and/or medically underserved areas, frequently serving as the sole source of care for the communities they support. They provide services to approximately 30 million individuals annually across the U.S. In 2019, more than 91% of patients reported incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level (i.e., $27,180 for an individual and $55,500 for a family of four), with 48% enrolled in Medicaid and 23% uninsured. According to a 2018 study, although the majority of patients served annually by FQHCS are low-income individuals, the number of Medicare low/moderate income beneficiaries receiving care from FQHCs more than doubled since 1996 and accounted for approximately 1.5 million individuals.

Many FQHCs are strategically located in rural areas or areas with persistent socioeconomic disadvantages, such as historically redlined neighborhoods. They are situated primarily in areas limited health care access, and elevated rates of chronic conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. 63% of FQHC patients belong to racial or ethnic minority groups, with 37% identifying as Hispanic/Latino and 22% as African American.

In Puerto Rico, FQHCs operate a network of 20 local centers across more than 90 locations, serving over 350,000 individuals, or more than 10% of the island&#x27;s population.

== Challenges ==
FQHCs face challenges such as high patient loads, limited resources, and a focus on acute care. Serving undocumented and uninsured minorities, who represent a significant portion of their patient base and are excluded from many health care reforms, further strains their capacity. The lack of on-site specialty services, such as Pap tests, mammography, or colonoscopy referrals, creates barriers for patients, particularly Spanish-speaking individuals. Having Spanish-speaking staff and educational materials, along with on-site services, helps overcome communication challenges and improve access to care. Federal incentives predominantly target acute treatment, leaving limited support for preventative screening services. However, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has shifted incentives toward preventive care, requiring clinics to report outcomes through standardized measures like the Uniform Data System and Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set.

The expansion of FQHCs has resulted in more people seeking services at FQHCs. However, the geographic patterns of expansion found in a 2019 study indicate that the pattern of expansion may not be optimal for directing these important primary care resources to financially disadvantage populations. Outdated underserved designation and a bureaucratically burdensome process of being certified and being financially supported by federal grants are two fundamental factors that could directly affect FQHC expansion to new areas.

=== Collaboration with academic medical centers ===
Innovative care delivery models have integrated FQHCs with academic medical centers (AMCs) to enhance care quality. For example, Johns Hopkins Medicine implemented an AMC-FQHC collaboration in East Baltimore, which resulted in increased staffing, new wraparound services, improved funding access, and decreased out-of-pocket costs for eligible patients.

== Impact ==

=== Quality of care ===
FQHCs, often the sole providers of primary care in the most vulnerable communities, consistently deliver high-quality care that leads to better disease outcomes. They have been instrumental in expanding access to health care for medically underserved and rural areas, low-income groups, and racial and ethnic minorities. FQHCs are key to reducing health care disparities and improving health outcomes for underserved populations by preventing and managing chronic illnesses and have been shown to reduce emergency room visits and hospitalizations, and enhance overall community health.

FQHCs are particularly effective in managing ambulatory care-sensitive conditions and providing preventive care, resulting in fewer emergency department visits and hospitalizations among their patients.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
A 2022 study found that a higher penetration of FQHC services was associated with reduced COVID-19 mortality rates in major U.S. cities.

=== Opioid use disorder ===
FQHCs have increasingly focused on the overdose crisis and treating opioid use disorder (OUD), which disproportionately affects their patient base. Nearly 20% of adults with OUD are uninsured, and 60% are low-income, aligning closely with the populations FQHCs serve. Federal funding has bolstered efforts to expand substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, including medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), the most effective therapy. However, as of 2019, 34% of FQHCs still did not offer MOUD.

==Look-Alikes==
The government also designates a category of health centers as &quot;FQHC Look-Alikes.&quot; These health centers do not receive grants under Section 330 but are determined by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to meet the requirements for receiving a grant based on the Health Resources and Services Administration recommendations. Also, FQHC Look-Alikes receive cost-based reimbursement for their Medicaid services, but do not receive malpractice coverage under FTCA or a cash grant. Look-Alikes also qualify as health professional shortage areas (HPSA) automatically.

==Services under Medicare==
FQHC benefit under Medicare became effective October 1, 1991, when Section 1861(aa) of the Social Security Act was amended by Section 4161 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. FQHCs provide Medicare beneficiaries with preventive primary health services such as immunizations, visual acuity and hearing screenings, and prenatal and post-partum care. However, eyeglasses, hearing aids, and preventive dental services are not covered under the FQHC preventive primary services. A FQHC Prospective Payment System (PPS) was scheduled to be implemented in 2014. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandates that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) collect and analyze health services data prior to developing and implementing the new payment system. This requires that the appropriate revenue code and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code be listed with each service provided. Currently, Medicare pays FQHC directly based on an all-inclusive per visit payment.

<doc id="873038" wikidata="Q1595961" url="?curid=873038" title="K's Choice">
<text>K&#x27;s Choice is a Belgian rock band from Antwerp, formed in 1994. The band&#x27;s core members are brothers Sam (lead vocals, guitar) and Gert Bettens (guitar, keyboard, vocals). Since 2014, the Bettenses have been joined by Bart van Lierde (bass), Tom Lodewyckx (lead guitar), Reinout Swinnen (keys) and Wim van der Westen (drums). The band have released seven studio albums to date, several of which have been certified Gold and Platinum by the Belgian Entertainment Association.

==Band history==
In the early 1990s, Sam (then known as Sarah) and Gert Bettens played in a band together called The Basement Plugs. During this time, Sam appeared on several movie soundtracks as a vocalist including &quot;I&#x27;m So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot; (originally by Hank Williams) for the movie &quot;Vrouwen Willen Trouwen&quot; (&quot;Women Want To Marry&quot;) and a duet with Frankie Miller, &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Try Me&quot;, (originally by Ry Cooder) for the movie &quot;Ad Fundum&quot;. He was offered a recording contract, and formed a new band with Gert in order to fulfil it. The band was originally named The Choice, recording and releasing their debut album &quot;The Great Subconscious Club&quot; in 1994.

During the initial formation of the band, the Bettens were joined by Jan van Sichem, Jr. (guitar), Bart van der Zeeuw (drums) and Erik Verheyden (bass). This iteration of the band toured Germany and the United States in support of the Indigo Girls. While in the U.S., the band discovered another identically-named act and changed their name to avoid legal problems. They decided upon &quot;K&#x27;s Choice&quot; by going through the alphabet to see which letter would sound best in front of the word &quot;choice&quot;. Since they thought they needed a story behind the new name, they initially claimed that the K referred to Joseph K. from Franz Kafka&#x27;s novel &quot;The Trial&quot;, but later the band revealed the arbitrariness of choosing the &quot;K&quot;.

=== &quot;Paradise in Me&quot; and &quot;Not An Addict&quot; ===
In 1995, they released &quot;Paradise in Me&quot;. &quot;Not an Addict&quot;, the first single taken from this album, was successful and brought international fame. For the next year (1996–1997) they toured supporting Alanis Morissette, who heard the band playing on a European festival and handpicked them as her support band.

=== &quot;Cocoon Crash&quot;, &quot;Almost Happy&quot; and split===
In 1998, the band released their third studio album &quot;Cocoon Crash&quot;. Meanwhile, American Eric Grossman had become the permanent bass player. In 1999, the band appeared on &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; in the episode &quot;Doppelgängland&quot; performing their song &quot;Virgin State Of Mind&quot;. The song appeared on the soundtrack &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Album&quot;. It was at this point that their drummer Bart van der Zeeuw had been replaced by Koen Lieckens. In 2000, their next studio album &quot;Almost Happy&quot; was finished and released in Europe in September.

In 2001, &quot;Live&quot; (a 2-CD collection of live recordings) was in stores in Europe while &quot;Almost Happy&quot; was released in the US with another cover and a second CD of some songs from &quot;Live&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Ten&quot; (a collection of ten years of singles and songs that did not appear on their albums, plus the brand new single &quot;Losing You&quot;) was released, accompanied by a DVD bearing the same name.

In October 2002, the band decided to go on a sabbatical. Gert and Sam both wanted to try out some solo work. Gert produced an album for a Belgian band, Venus in Flames, and Sam recorded a solo mini-CD &quot;Go&quot; and appeared on several movie soundtracks with songs of his own (&quot;All of This Past&quot; for &quot;Underworld&quot; and &quot;Someone to Say Hi To&quot; for &quot;Zus and Zo&quot;).
In addition to four full albums, a live album, and a best-of, they also produced four limited edition and fan club CDs: &quot;Extra Cocoon&quot;, &quot;2000 Seconds Live&quot;, &quot;Home&quot; and &quot;Running Backwards&quot;.

=== More solo projects ===
In 2005, Sam released his solo album &quot;Scream&quot; in both Europe and the U.S., accompanied by a tour. Gert, having flirted for a while with the band name Moon Brigade, announced his new band is called Woodface (which is also the name of one of his favorite albums from Crowded House). Woodface released its first album &quot;Good Morning Hope&quot; on 19 September 2005. Sam released another solo album called &quot;Shine&quot; and Gert another Woodface Album &quot;Comet&quot; in 2007. In 2008, Sam released another album, &quot;Never Say Goodbye&quot;. Gert and his band Woodface opened at several of Sam&#x27;s shows in 2007 and 2008.

In an 7 October 2008, interview with &quot;Austin Sound Check&quot;, Sam confirmed plans for a new album in 2009. On 8 June 2009, six years after K&#x27;s Choice announced their indefinite hiatus, the band&#x27;s official website announced they will perform at the 35th edition of Folk Dranouter on 7 August 2009. In 2009, to celebrate the return of K&#x27;s Choice on the international level, Sony Music released the compilation album &quot;The Essential K&#x27;s Choice&quot;.

=== Return and &quot;Echo Mountain&quot; ===

K&#x27;s Choice recorded their fifth studio album &quot;Echo Mountain&quot; in the Echo Mountain Studios in Asheville, North Carolina. On 22 February 2010, they confirmed on their website that the new album will be released on 26 March 2010. &quot;When I Lay Beside You&quot; and &quot;Come Live The Life&quot; were released as singles.
In 2011, Sam and Gert recorded a follow-up to &quot;Echo Mountain&quot; in the form of an acoustic CD called &quot;Little Echoes&quot;. For this album and the following tour, the both of them were only joined by pianist Reinout Swinnen.

In 2013, Sam and Gert returned to Echo Mountain Studios to record an album as a side project under the name &quot;Bettens&quot; for a 3D documentary about an expedition to Antarctica, &quot;Beyond the Challenge&quot;. The album titled, &quot;Waving at the Sun&quot; was eventually released under the K&#x27;s Choice name in the U.S. and other countries in 2014.

=== &quot;Private Revolution&quot; ===

On 6 February 2015, K&#x27;s Choice released the first single &quot;Private Revolution&quot; of their latest studio album &quot;The Phantom Cowboy. A&quot; teaser video for &quot;Private Revolution&quot; was released to YouTube on 5 February 2015. The video features concert and prior video footage of Sam and Gert. A video for the track &quot;Bag of Concrete&quot; was released on 12 June 2015. The album was released on 5 February 2015 in much of Europe by Wallaby Records, LLC and distributed by Sony, and on 18 September 2015 in the US, UK, Canada, and Ireland by MPress Records. In September 2015 the band released &quot;Perfect Scar&quot; as a single and video. The album was a Top 3 hit in Belgium. 

In March 2016, K&#x27;s Choice embarked on their first US tour in a decade in support of &quot;The Phantom Cowboy&quot; with longtime friends and, more recently, labelmates A Fragile Tomorrow.

=== &quot;The Backpack Sessions&quot;, &quot;Liefde Voor Muziek&quot; and 30th anniversary ===
In late 2016 the band released &quot;The Backpack Sessions&quot;, as a companion album to the tour of the same name. It featured acoustic re-workings of songs from albums like &quot;The Great Subconscious Club&quot;, &quot;Cocoon Crash&quot; and &quot;The Phantom Cowboy&quot;. The album also featured cover versions of Aretha Franklin&#x27;s &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman&quot; and Justin Bieber&#x27;s &quot;Love Yourself&quot;.

In January 2017, the band released a stripped-back re-recording of &quot;Not an Addict.&quot; It featured Skin of Skunk Anansie as a guest vocalist, who had previously performed the song live with the group on several occasions. 

On 24 March 2017, the band released an album entitled &quot;25&quot; as a retrospective of their 25 years as a group. The album included new song &quot;Resonate&quot; and the new version of &quot;Not an Addict&quot;. The album went to #4 on The Belgian album charts. 

On 16 March 2018, the band released a concert album entitled &quot;Live at the Ancienne Belgique&quot;, a double live album recorded in Brussels on 13 December 2017 during the 25th Anniversary tour.

In 2018 Sam and Gert participated in the popular Belgian TV show &quot;Liefde Voor Muziek&quot;, in which they performed songs by Jasper Steverlinck, Within Temptation and Helmut Lotti a.o. Belgian singer Niels Destadsbader sang K&#x27;s Choice&#x27;s &quot;Believe&quot; on the show, re-worked to &quot;Verover Mij&quot;, which became a top-five single nationally. At the same time the album &quot;Love = Music&quot; was released, featuring all Liefde Voor Muziek covers, which reached the top 10 on Belgium&#x27;s album charts. 

In December 2022 the band announced a 30th anniversary tour, a vinyl box-set and a brand new single &quot;Time Is A Parasite&quot;, which was pronounced Catch Of The Day on Studio Brussel on the day of release.

After a series of sold-out birthday concerts in 2023, K&#x27;s Choice are returning to an acoustic setting in theatres in 2024.

<text>A tachograph is a device fitted to a vehicle that automatically records its speed and distance, together with the driver&#x27;s activity selected from a choice of modes. The drive mode is activated automatically when the vehicle is in motion, and modern tachograph heads usually default to the other work mode upon coming to rest. The rest and availability modes can be manually selected by the driver whilst stationary.

A tachograph system comprises a sender unit mounted to the vehicle gearbox, the tachograph head and a recording medium. Tachograph heads are of either analogue or digital types. All relevant vehicles manufactured in the EU since 1 May 2006 must be fitted with digital tachograph heads. The recording medium for analogue heads are wax coated paper discs, and for digital heads there are two recording mediums: internal memory (which can be read out with one of a variety of download devices into a so-called .ddd file) and digital driver cards containing a microchip with flash memory. Digital driver cards store data in a format that can later also be read out as a .ddd file. These files – both those read from internal memory with a download device, and those read from the driver cards – can be imported into tachograph analysis/archival software.

Drivers and their employers are legally required to accurately record their activities, retain the records (files from internal memory and from driver cards must both be retained) and produce them on demand to transport authorities who are in charge of enforcing regulations governing drivers&#x27; working hours.

They are also used in the maritime world, for example through the Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine.

== Origins ==
The tachograph was originally introduced for the railways so that companies could better document irregularities. The inventor was Max Maria von Weber, a civil servant, engineer and author. The Daniel Tachometer has been known in the railway industry since 1844. The Hasler Event recorder was introduced in the 1920s.

== Regulations ==
For reasons of public safety, many jurisdictions have limits on the working hours of drivers of certain vehicles, such as buses and trucks. A tachograph can be used to monitor this and ensure that appropriate breaks are taken.

=== In Germany (historical) ===
The &quot;Verkehrs-Sicherungs-Gesetz&quot; (German Traffic Safety Law) of 19 December 1952, made tachographs mandatory in Germany for all commercial vehicles weighing over 7.5 tonnes. Since 23 March and 23 December 1953, all new commercial vehicles and buses must be equipped with the device per law &quot;Straßenverkehrs-Zulassungs-Ordnung&quot; § 57a.

Tachographs are mandatory for vehicles allowed to carry a total weight of over 3.5 tonnes and vehicles built to carry at least 9 passengers, if the vehicle is used for commercial purposes. They are used to review the driving and rest time of drivers during reviews by traffic standards organizations or accident investigation. A driver must carry the tachograph records with him for all days of the current week and the last day of the previous week that he drove. Companies must keep the records for 1 year. In Germany, § 16 of the work time regulations lengthens this time to 2 years if the records will be used as proof of work time.

===Russia===
In Russia, buses with more than 8 seats and trucks with a permitted gross weight of more than 3.5 tons (Order of the Ministry of Transport of Russia dated 13 February 2013, No. 36) must be equipped with tachographs in order to ensure safe conditions. A tachograph is mandatory for vehicles of class M2, M3, N2, N3. Vehicles must be equipped with on-board monitoring devices in accordance with regulatory documents.

From 1 April 2014, in the absence of a tachograph, fines will be applied to the following types of transport: - buses with more than 8 seats; - vehicles used to transport dangerous goods; — According to the order of the Ministry of Transport dated 17 December 2013 No. 470, Moscow &quot;On Amendments to the Order of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation dated 13 February 2013 No. 36&quot;, penalties will be applied to freight vehicles with a gross weight of over 15 tons engaged in intercity transportation starting 1 July 2014, penalties will be applied to freight vehicles with a gross weight of over 12 tons engaged in intercity transportation starting 1 September 2014, and penalties will be applied to freight vehicles with a gross weight of over 3.5 tons engaged in intercity transportation starting 1 April 2015.

Russian tachographs use a cryptographic information protection tool (CIPF). Requirements for the use of the CIPF unit as part of tachographs are established by Order of the Ministry of Transport of Russia No. 36 dated 13.02.2013.

====Digital tachograph====

Digital tachographs appeared in Russia on 16 June 2010 (digital tachographs appeared before the specified date). Starting from 16 June 2010, the Russian Federation was supposed to implement the European digital tachography system on its territory for international transportation, but by that date the digital tachography infrastructure was not ready, as was the case in a number of other countries, as a result the first AETR digital tachograph cards were issued at the end of 2010 in accordance with the international agreement of the countries that joined the AETR. Before that date, no later than 3 months, all interested parties (drivers, inspectors, mechanics, administrators of motor transport enterprises) must be provided with special cards.

Unlike analogue devices, the disks of which were easily counterfeited, this device cannot be opened or the recorded information changed in any way. All information is recorded on an individual driver card and transmitted to the central computer of the motor transport enterprise.

Since 23 January 2012, the tachograph in Russia has become mandatory for installation and use when transporting passengers and dangerous goods. This is evidenced by the Technical Regulations on the Safety of Wheeled Vehicles in the latest edition. And since 1 April 2013, the presence of a digital tachograph has become mandatory for all wheeled transport owned by legal entities and individual entrepreneurs (including GAZelles and taxis), which is in operation on the territory of Russia, as reported in Federal Law No. 78-FZ adopted on 14 June 2012 (Article 1 and Article 12).

In accordance with Order No. 36 dated 13.02.13 of the Ministry of Transport of Russia, the following categories and types of vehicles issued for circulation and in operation on the territory of the Russian Federation are equipped with tachographs:

*Vehicles used to carry passengers, having, in addition to the driver&#x27;s seat, more than eight seats, the maximum mass of which does not exceed 5 tons (category M2);
*Vehicles used to carry passengers, having, in addition to the driver&#x27;s seat, more than eight seats, the maximum mass of which exceeds 5 tons (category M3);
*Vehicles intended to carry goods, having a maximum mass of over 3.5 tons, but not more than 12 tons (category N2);
*Vehicles intended to carry goods, having a maximum mass of over 12 tons (category N3).

On 16 December 2015, the Order of the Ministry of Transport of Russia No. 348 was published, which amends order No. 273. Order No. 348 changes the deadline for equipping vehicles of categories N2, N3, M2, M3 with digital tachographs. Now vehicles must be equipped with digital tachographs by 1 July 2016.

=== European Union ===

EEC regulation 3821/85 on recording equipment in road transport from 20 December 1985 made tachographs mandatory throughout the EEC as of 29 September 1986. (Regulation 1463/70 amended by regulation 2828/77 made tachographs mandatory by 1 July 1979, reference to these regulations can be found in Regulation 3821/85).

A &quot;European arrangement in regard to the work of driving personnel engaged in international traffic&quot; (AETR, from French ) became effective on 31 July 1985.

Regulation 561/2006/EC of the European Union, adopted on 11 April 2007, specified the driving and rest times of professional drivers. These time periods can be checked by the employers, police and other authorities with the help of the tachograph. Regulation (EU) 165/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on tachographs in road transport, issued on 4 February 2014, repealed Regulation 3821/85 and amended Regulation 561/2006. The 2014 regulation introduced the specification for a so-called &quot;smart&quot; tachograph. A &quot;smart&quot; tachograph records the position of a vehicle automatically via a global navigation satellite system at the places where the daily working period begins and ends, and at every three hour interval of accumulated driving.

== Analogue tachographs ==
Most tachographs produced prior to 1 May 2006 were of the analogue type. Later analogue tachograph head models are of a modular design, enabling the head to fit into a standard DIN slot in the vehicle dashboard. This would enable a relatively easy upgrade to the forthcoming digital models, which were manufactured to the same physical dimensions.

The analogue tachograph head uses styli to trace lines on a wax coated paper disc that rotates throughout the day, where one rotation encompasses a 24-hour period. If the disc is left in the head over 24 hours, a second trace will be written onto the first, and so on until the disc is removed. It is an infringement of EU Regulation 561/2006 to use a disc for a period longer than it is designed for. Multiple overlapping traces may still be deciphered in the speed and distance fields, but it is far more difficult for the activity field where one trace can easily be obliterated by another. Analogue tachograph heads provide no indication to the driver of the need to change the disc.

Analogue data is retrieved visually, and can be assisted by manual analysis tools. Analogue discs can also be electronically scanned and analysed by computer, although this analogue to digital conversion process still requires human expert interpretation for best results, due to imperfections in the source disc such as dirt and scratch marks in the wax surface that can be incorrectly read as trace marks.

=== The analogue chart (EU) ===

The analogue chart must be EU type approved. The country of type approval can be found on the rear of the chart, i.e. a mark of E11 would indicate the chart to have been approved in the UK for use in the EU. The chart is manufactured out of heavyweight paper with a black printed face that is thinly coated with a white wax, upon which is printed a number of features. The surface can be scratched or rubbed to reveal the black paper underneath. This enables the traces to be made without the use of ink. The chart features a pear-shaped aperture in the centre, ensuring it is perfectly aligned upon insertion into the tachograph head. There is no facility to prevent it being inserted back to front, where the styli would be prevented from making contact with the wax surface.

The centrefield is used by the driver to store certain handwritten information. This includes the drivers name, the date(s) the disc refers to, the start and end odometer readings and the registration mark of the vehicle.

Three traces are made in the wax surface by the head. These traces are either made by three separate styli or a single multipurpose stylus.

The trace closest to the centrefield is the distance trace. The stylus moves up and down with distance travelled, producing a zig-zag pattern, often referred to as a &#x27;V&#x27; trace. A complete deflection is created every 5 kilometres, and therefore each completed &#x27;V&#x27; represents 10 kilometres travelled. By counting the zig-zags, the total distance travelled can be calculated and compared against the stated odometer readings in the centrefield. By comparing the end position of the trace for a particular day against the start position for the following day, it can be seen if the vehicle has moved in the intermediate period.

The trace in the central area is the mode trace. The driver&#x27;s activity is displayed in this area, and is always displayed as either drive, other work, availability or rest. Earlier tachograph heads displayed the mode as a thin line in one of four concentric tracks within the activity band. These heads are known as manual heads as the activity was manually selected using the mode switch. Automatic heads succeeded manual heads, and differ from them in two main areas. Firstly, the automatic head will always display the drive mode when the vehicle is in motion, regardless of the setting of the mode switch. For this reason, the drive mode is no longer available to be selected by the mode switch. Secondly, the activity is displayed on the chart as a sequence of block traces of differing thickness. The rest mode appears as a thin line, availability as a slightly thicker line, other work as slightly thicker again and the drive trace being the thickest.

The trace closest to the outer edge is the speed trace. The disc is preprinted with a speed scale and the stylus produces a mark corresponding with the speed of the vehicle at any given time. It is important that the maximum speed (Vmax) specification of the chart matches that of the tachograph head for the speed to be correctly recorded. It can be expected that a high speed trace will correlate with a tightly spaced zig-zag pattern within the distance trace.

The disc is preprinted with a 24-hour scale that completes the outer circumference.

The rear face of the chart is printed with a grid that enables the driver to make handwritten additions or amendments to the information on the front.

== Its use in accident investigation ==
Apart from enforcing regulations, tachographs are often used in Germany to investigate and punish speeding. This practice was approved by the German high regional court in the 1990s. Also, after an accident, the discs are often examined with a microscope to discover the events that took place at a collision site.

== Tampering ==
Tachographs can be tampered with in various ways, such as slightly twisting the marker, blocking the path of the arm with a piece of rubber or foam, short-circuiting the unit for short periods, intentionally preventing the detection of gear movement with a magnet, or interrupting the (older analogue) tachograph&#x27;s power supply with a blown fuse to stop operation completely thus recording no information whatsoever. There is also &quot;forgetting to insert&quot; the chart when beginning duty. Unauthorized changing of the discs (and then discarding one of the two, so that some activities are &quot;forgotten&quot;) is well known throughout Europe. &quot;Ghosting&quot; is another common trick when false driver information is entered onto a second chart to give the appearance that there is a second driver present in the cab for long-distance runs that cannot be completed within a single driver&#x27;s daily driving period.

== Digital tachographs ==
=== Introduction of the digital tachograph in the EU===
Digital tachographs make tampering much more difficult by sending signals in an encrypted manner. EU regulation 1360/2002 makes digital tachographs mandatory for all vehicles described in the above section &quot;Regulations&quot; and manufactured after 1 August 2005. Digital tachographs have been required as of 1 May 2006 for all new vehicles for which EWG regulation VO(EWG)3820/85 applies, as was published in the official newsletter of the European Union L102 from 11 April 2006.

Digital tachographs have been implemented in Mexico since 1994, but this is not a federal regulation. The last implementations developed in Mexico have GPS capabilities such as mapping, altitude and location-activated video triggering.

<doc id="873053" wikidata="Q550218" url="?curid=873053" title="Alexandre Tansman">
<text>Alexander Tansman (, French: Alexandre Tansman; 12 June 1897 – 15 November 1986) was a Polish composer, pianist and conductor who became a naturalized French citizen in 1938. One of the earliest representatives of neoclassicism, associated with École de Paris, Tansman was a globally recognized and celebrated composer.

==Early life and heritage==
Tansman was born and raised in Łódź, Congress Poland. His parents were of Lithuanian Jewish ancestry. His father Moshe Tantzman (1868–1908) died when Alexander was 10 and his mother Hannah (&quot;née&quot; Gourvitch, 1872–1935) reared him and his older sister Teresa alone.

Tansman later wrote:
Tansman explained his later Francophile tendencies:
==Career==
Among his first music teachers were Wojciech Gawronski (a student of Zygmunt Noskowski, Moritz Moszkowski and Theodor Leschetizky) and Naum Podkaminer (a student of Hermann Graedener and Richard Hofmann).

Although he began his musical studies at the Lodz Conservatory, his study was in law at the University of Warsaw. On January 8, 1919, Tansman won the first composers&#x27; competition held in independent Poland, and gave a series of concerts at the Warsaw Philharmonic in the following months. In the fall of 1919, encouraged by his mentors Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Henryk Melcer-Szczawinski and Zdzisław Birnbaum, Tansman decided to continue his musical career in Paris. The first artists he was fortunate to meet shortly after his arrival were Moritz Moszkowski and Sarah Bernhardt. In Paris, his musical ideas were appreciated, influenced and favoured by composers Maurice Ravel, Albert Roussel, Jacques Ibert, Igor Stravinsky, musicologists and critics Émile Vuillermoz, Boris de Schloezer, Alexis Roland-Manuel, Arthur Hoérée, conductors André Caplet, Gaston Poulet, Vladimir Golschmann. Though Arthur Honegger and Darius Milhaud tried to persuade him to join &quot;Les Six&quot;, he declined, stating a need for creative independence. Nevertheless, he was one of the earliest and leading representatives of neoclassicism, along with Stravinsky, Les Six, Sergei Prokofiev, Paul Hindemith, Alfredo Casella. He was also one of the most respected members of the international music group École de Paris, along with Bohuslav Martinů, Tibor Harsányi, Alexander Tcherepnin, Marcel Mihalovici, Conrad Beck.
From the 1920s Tansman&#x27;s rise to fame was meteoric, with works conducted and championed by such world-famous baton masters as Arturo Toscanini, Tullio Serafin, Willem Mengelberg, Walter Damrosch, Sir Henry Wood, Serge Koussevitzky, Pierre Monteux, Otto Klemperer, Rhené-Baton, Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht, Walther Straram, Hermann Abendroth, Leopold Stokowski, Erich Kleiber, Sir Adrian Boult, Dimitri Mitropoulos, Frederick Stock, Eugene Ormandy. Tansman follows Paderewski as the second Polish composer whose theatre piece – ballet &quot;Sextuor&quot; – was staged by the Metropolitan Opera (1927).

As early as the first half of the 1920s, Belgian music critic and composer Georges Systermans wrote that Tansman&#x27;s musical personality &quot;combines poetic genius with Latin culture&quot;. Tansman&#x27;s works started to be frequently performed in programs with pieces by Maurice Ravel, Igor Stravinsky and Gian Francesco Malipiero on the one hand, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Carl Maria von Weber and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov on the other. Each time he visited Germany, he was invited to Arnold Schönberg&#x27;s home, who at that time lectured in Berlin. In 1927 Nicolas Slonimsky called Tansman a &quot;musical plenipotentiary of Poland in the Western World&quot;.

From the mid-1920s, and into the decades that followed, Tansman&#x27;s works were performed in some of the best concert halls in the world, such as Salle Gaveau, Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie, Carnegie Hall, Opéra National de Paris, New York Philharmonic, Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, Salle Pleyel, Boston Symphony Hall, Théâtre Mogador, Opéra National de Lyon, Château Royal de Laeken, Théâtre de la Ville, Palais-Royal, Berlin State Opera, Royal Albert Hall, Metropolitan Opera, Severance Hall, Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels, Concertgebouw, Amsterdam, DAR Constitution Hall, Cologne Opera, Tokyo Hibiya Public Hall, Berlin Philharmonic, Oslo National Theatre, Wigmore Hall, La Fenice, Academy of Music (Philadelphia), De Doelen, Teatro Nacional de São Carlos, Opéra de Nice, Orchestra Hall, Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier, Hollywood Bowl, Powell Hall, Mann Auditorium, Johannesburg City Hall, Teatro Colón, Grand Auditorium, Royce Hall.
In 1931, a book authored by Irving Schwerke and titled &quot;Alexandre Tansman. Compositeur polonais (Alexander Tansman. The Polish Composer)&quot; was published in Paris. The book was devoted to the work of Tansman until 1930 and its reception, to his individual style and the aesthetics of his oeuvre. It also contained Tansman&#x27;s short biography and the first catalogue of his works and their European and American premieres. Tansman&#x27;s music – according to Schwerke – &quot;is undoubtedly the most complete homage that any Polish composer of his generation has paid to his country. It occupies a prominent place among the most important artistic manifestations of the present day&quot;.

In 1932–1933, Tansman made an unprecedented artistic tour around the world – starting with the United States, through Japan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore, Ceylon, India and Egypt, to Italy. He was honored by Mahatma Gandhi and Emperor Hirohito of Japan. In Tokyo, Tansman was granted honorary membership of the Imperial Academy of Music and awarded Golden Ji Ji Shimpo Medal in recognition of his notable contribution to the world of arts.

As Marcel Mihalovici noted, Tansman was one of the most prominent contemporary representatives of the centuries-old tradition of École de Paris: &quot;This included musicians at Notre-Dame Cathedral during the Renaissance, and later Lully, Mozart, and Wagner. Not to mention Chopin, Falla, Enescu, Honegger, Stravinsky, Prokofiev, Copland, and certainly our old colleague Alexander Tansman&quot;.

In June 1938, four years after Stravinsky and in the same year as Bruno Walter, Tansman was granted French citizenship by the last president of the Third Republic Albert Lebrun. Tansman fled Europe as his Jewish background put him in danger with Hitler&#x27;s rise to power. He moved to Los Angeles, thanks to the efforts of his friend Charlie Chaplin in founding a committee visa. In 1941 he could join there the circle of famous emigrated artists and intellectuals that included Igor Stravinsky, Thomas Mann, Arnold Schoenberg, Alma Mahler, Franz Werfel, Emil Ludwig, Aldous Huxley, Lion Feuchtwanger, Man Ray, Eugène Berman, Jean Renoir. During this time, he also met and befriended Golo Mann as well as Sholem Asch.
During his American years Tansman toured extensively as pianist and conductor and wrote a wealth of music, e.g. three symphonies, two quartets, works for piano. In 1944 he accepted Nathaniel Shilkret&#x27;s invitation to co-create &quot;Genesis Suite&quot;, alongside Arnold Schoenberg, Darius Milhaud, Igor Stravinsky, Ernst Toch, Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco. In the 1940s, he also wrote a few scores for Hollywood movies: i.e. &quot;Flesh and Fantasy&quot;, starring Barbara Stanwyck, a biopic of the Australian medical researcher Sister Elizabeth Kenny, starring Rosalind Russell, and &quot;Paris Underground&quot;, starring Constance Bennett. For the 1946 Academy Awards ceremony, he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture, for &quot;Paris Underground&quot;. In 1948, Tansman published a book on Igor Stravinsky, the result of a friendship between the two composers during the years of exile in the United States.

In 1946 Tansman returned to Paris and his musical career started again all over Europe. His works, with performances at times reaching over 500 a year, were performed by the best orchestras and conductors, such as Jascha Horenstein, Rafael Kubelik, André Cluytens, Carlos Chávez, Paul Kletzki, Charles Munch, Bruno Maderna, Paul van Kempen, Sir Malcolm Sargent, Ferenc Fricsay, Charles Bruck, Øivin Fjeldstad, Eugène Bigot, Franz André, Jean Fournet, Franz Waxman, Georges Tzipine, Pedro de Freitas Branco, Alfred Wallenstein, Eduard Flipse, Robert Whitney, Manuel Rosenthal, Roger Wagner, Jean Périsson, Vassil Kazandjiev.

Despite Tansman’s numerous performances far away from his home in France, he did not return to the United States after the 1946 end of his California residency. This eventually reduced the number of Americans who knew who he was.
As a ballet composer, for decades Tansman collaborated with the most eminent choreographers like Olga Preobrajenska, Rudolf von Laban, Jean Börlin, Adolph Bolm, Kurt Jooss, Ernst Uthoff, Françoise Adret.

In 1966, he was awarded the Hector Berlioz Prize. In 1977, in recognition of his contribution to European culture, Tansman was granted membership (after the late Dmitri Shostakovich) of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium. In 1978, he was awarded the Music Prize of the Académie Française, and in 1986 – the highest Commander grade of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.

Notable students of Tansman include Cristóbal Halffter, Leonardo Balada, Carmelo Bernaola, Yüksel Koptagel.

During the last period of his life, he began to reestablish connections to Poland, though his career and family kept him in France, where he lived until his death in Paris in 1986. Since 1996, in his native city of Łódź, Alexander Tansman Association for the Promotion of Culture has been organizing the Alexander Tansman International Festival and Competition of Musical Personalities (Tansman Festival).

Twenty years after the composer&#x27;s death, in 2006 Henryk Górecki wrote his long-awaited 4th Symphony, which he named &quot;Tansman Episodes&quot; by no accident. Górecki left a cryptogram that explains the way he created the theme for the symphony, using musical letters from the first and last names of &quot;Aleksander Tansman&quot;.

==Private life==

Tansman&#x27;s first wife was Anna E. Broçiner of Romanian-Swiss descent, whose family served to Royal Household of the Romanian ruling dynasty. They divorced in 1932. In 1934 he fell in love with the princess Nadejda de Bragança, daughter of Miguel, Duke de Viseu. They remained a couple until 1936. In 1937 he married a noted French pianist Colette Cras, student of Lazare Lévy and the daughter of Jean Cras, rear admiral and major general of the port of Brest, who was also a composer. They had two children.

==Music==
Tansman was not only an internationally recognized composer, but was also a virtuoso pianist and conductor. From the 1920s, he regularly performed as pianist at Carnegie Hall and Salle Pleyel, Wigmore Hall, Salle Gaveau. He performed five concert tours in the United States, the first one as a soloist under Sergei Koussevitzky with the Boston Symphony Orchestra (1927–1928).

Many musicologists have demonstrated that Tansman&#x27;s music is written in the French neoclassical style of his adopted home and the Polish national style of his birthplace, also drawing on his Jewish heritage and American dance idioms. What has often escaped attention is the significance of Edvard Grieg in the development of Tansman&#x27;s earliest musical thought, which gave him the notion of &quot;purity of design and bequeathed to him heed for folk tunes&quot;, and later on – the influence of Albert Roussel and on the other hand of Paul Dukas, which was sometimes even more distinctive than that of Igor Stravinsky, who helped him recover an absolute music form and traditional pre-Romantic aesthetics. In his departure from conventional tonality, Tansman was compared to Alexander Scriabin, whom he met personally in 1914. He adopted the extended harmonies of Maurice Ravel, since 1919 a central figure in his musical career. Furthermore, Tansman emphasized that &quot;Ravel helped me develop a sense of economy of means, cultivate an intimate relationship between line and means of expression, and resist empty musical prattle&quot;. The composer himself also admitted and pointed to the significance and influence of Béla Bartók and Arnold Schoenberg as well, but he stressed that it should not be considered from a systematic point of view. However, both influences, that of Ravel and at the same time that of Schoenberg, were noticed by Alexis Roland-Manuel in Tansman&#x27;s &quot;Little Suite&quot; (1919), a piece already stamped with a clear mark of the composer&#x27;s ever stronger personality.
Despite his accession to the musical avant-garde, Tansman&#x27;s style was never characterised by any particular radicalism, though he applied polytonality as early as 1916 (&quot;The Polish Album&quot;) and in the following years strongly contributed to its popularization worldwide. His original style, that has already manifested in the early 1920s – what was especially emphasized after the Paris premiere of his String Quartet No. 2 (1922) – was often characterised as a combination of expressive colouring, intense lyrical qualities and prolific melodic inventiveness with the ideal clarity, aristocratic elegance and precision of structure. A number of French, Belgian, Dutch, German, Austrian, Italian, Spanish and American critics admired his mastery in orchestration, instrumentation and the use of counterpoint. They spoke of the &quot;Tansman phenomenon&quot; and pointed to his sophisticated music language, including such of his trademarks as individual approach to form, where he introduced the so-called &quot;bridges&quot; or &quot;pliers&quot;, his own expanded harmonic structures called &quot;Tansman chords&quot; or &quot;the skyscrapers&quot; and later the characteristic Tansmanian rhythmic structures.

According to Alejo Carpentier, Tansman was &quot;one of the most gifted musical personalities of our times&quot;.

A Polish artist whose music had a global influence, Tansman interwove Polish music with a new modern language and aesthetics of the 20th century. Karol Szymanowski, fifteen years older than Tansman, also mixed Polish influences with other ethnic influences, but Tansman transcended 19th-century musical poetics and German patterns much more than Szymanowski. Moreover, Tansman became the first composer in the history of Polish music to combine an overt and predominantly classicist orientation with such a wide output and substantial achievements in contemporary art.
Tansman always described himself as a Polish composer: &quot;It is obvious that I owe much to France, but anyone who has ever heard my compositions cannot have doubt that I have been, am and forever will be a Polish composer&quot;. After Frédéric Chopin, Tansman may be considered as one of the leading proponents of traditional Polish forms such as the mazurka or the polonaise. They were often inspired by and written in homage to Chopin. For these works, which ranged from light-hearted miniatures to virtuoso show-pieces, Tansman drew on traditional Polish folk themes, adapted them to his style, thus enriched melodic and harmonic means of modern music language, as well as its instrumental colour and rhythmic variation. However, he did not write straight settings of the folk songs, but followed the path of Bela Bartók and Manuel de Falla, as he states in an interview:
As Irving Schwerke concluded: &quot;Deeply Polish, thanks to France, Tansman became universal&quot;.
The key determining Tansman&#x27;s artistic stance, was his constantly repeated efforts to create a new classical style. It rather meant a broader concept of being a modern classicist than sticking to neoclassical current or any other exclusive system. Although the discrepancy between Tansman&#x27;s composing practice and the basic principles of neoclassicism could be observed in the 1940s, the signs of such an attitude were clearly present in his earlier works. Nevertheless, after World War II, Tansman implemented more radical techniques. The afterwar European premiere of his &quot;Sextuor à cordes&quot; (1940) heralded a &quot;new Tansman style&quot;. He introduced more textural contrasts and metro-rhythmical complexity (&quot;Musique pour orchestre – Symphony No. 8&quot;, 1948), applied clusters (opera &quot;Sabbataï Zevi&quot;, 1957–1958), experimented with new genres and was interested in purely qualitative characteristics of sounds. The coexistence of various constructing principles in one form – an idea of integrating musical material, which he had applied and developed in his composing practice already before the war – led to the clash of different types of expression, which strengthened the drama, dynamics and power of presentation of his music. All this without breaking up with the ceaseless pursuit of his music: to find a new classical style.

When reviewing Tansman&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Isaiah, the Prophet&quot; in 1955, Alfred Frankenstein and Herbert Donaldson considered it &quot;should be counted among major works of religious music&quot; and admired &quot;the composer&#x27;s genius&quot;.
Tansman composed prolifically in most genres and wrote more than 300 works, including 7 operas, 10 ballets, 6 oratorios, 80 orchestral pieces (with 9 symphonies), virtuoso concertos and substantial body of chamber music, among them 8 string quartets, tens of pieces for piano, as well as pieces for the radio theatres and pedagogical works. He is also known for his guitar pieces, mostly written for Andrés Segovia – in particular the &quot;Mazurka&quot; (1925), &quot;Cavatine&quot; (1950), &quot;Suite in modo polonico&quot; (1962), &quot;Variations sur un theme de Scriabine&quot; (1972). Segovia frequently performed the works in recordings and on tour; they are today part of the standard repertoire. Tansman&#x27;s music has been performed by such artists as singers Marya Freund, Jane Bathori, Madeleine Grey, Fanély Revoil, Suzanne Danco, Jean Giraudeau, Denise Duval, Freda Betti, Xavier Depraz, Jane Rhodes, Andrée Esposito, flautists Louis Fleury, Maxence Larrieu, clarinetist Louis Cahuzac, harpsichordist Marcelle de Lacour, pianists Marie-Aimée Roger-Miclos, Léo-Pol Morin, Mieczysław Horszowski, Walter Gieseking, Youra Guller, Jan Smeterlin, Robert Schmitz, Dimitri Tiomkin, Nicole Henriot-Schweitzer, José Iturbi, Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, Alicia de Larrocha, violinists Stefan Frenkel, Bronisław Huberman, Hélène Jourdan-Morhange, Joseph Szigeti, Alexander Mogilevsky, Henri Temianka, Jascha Heifetz, cellists Pablo Casals, Gregor Piatigorsky, Maurice Maréchal, Enrico Mainardi, Gaspar Cassadó, organist Marie-Louise Girod, quartets Pro Arte, Burgin, Budapest, Calvet, Paganini, Pascal, Parrenin, trio Pasquier.

<text>The Great Subconscious Club is the debut album of the Belgian band K&#x27;s Choice recorded in 1994. It was originally produced under the name The Choice, but the band changed names. &quot;Me Happy&quot;, &quot;Breakfast&quot;, &quot;I Smoke a Lot&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of Lea &amp; Paul&quot; were released as singles. The name of the album is taken from the lyrics to the song &quot;Try To Get Some Sleep&quot;, the B-side of &quot;I Smoke a Lot&quot;, which also appeared on the compilation &quot;Extra Cocoon&quot;. At this time the band merely existed out of Sam (then Sarah) and Gert Bettens, who were joined by others (who didn&#x27;t return for any of the later albums of K&#x27;s Choice).

<doc id="873067" wikidata="Q63380" url="?curid=873067" title="Edgar Jung">
<text>Edgar Julius Jung (pen name: Tyll; 6 March 1894 – 1 July 1934) was a German lawyer born in Ludwigshafen in the Kingdom of Bavaria. He was a leader of the conservative revolutionary movement in Germany that stood in opposition to not only the Weimar Republic, whose parliamentarian system he considered decadent and foreign-imposed, but also National Socialism. Jung was murdered in the 1934 Night of the Long Knives purge.

==Career==
At the onset of World War I, Jung voluntarily joined the imperial armies and reached the rank of lieutenant. After the war, he participated in the suppression of the Bavarian Soviet Republic in the spring of 1919 and in the resistance against the French occupation of the Palatinate, during which he participated in the assassination of Franz Josef Heinz. Expelled by the French authorities, Jung moved to Munich, where in 1925 he opened a law firm and dampened his political activism slightly.

Like Carl Schmitt, Jung believed the breakdown of liberal parliamentarism to be inevitable as the instability of Weimar Germany was unfolding before his eyes. Jung regarded Weimar Germany as teetering on the brink of revolutionary turmoil with the very real prospect of a &quot;Red Revolution&quot; sponsored by the Soviet Union or a &quot;Brown Revolution&quot; by the Nazi Party. Jung claimed that &quot;the Jew&quot; had sided with Enlightenment and individualism since the beginning of the emancipation debate &quot;in order to undermine the edifice of German state building from within&quot;. Now, it was &quot;no longer a question of faith, but of ethnicity&quot;, and so for the Jews in Germany, only two options remained: emigrate or be reduced to the status of a &quot;national minority&quot;.

After the formation of the &quot;government of national concentration&quot; under the leadership of Adolf Hitler on 30 January 1933, Jung became a political consultant and speechwriter for the vice-chancellor of the coalition cabinet, Franz von Papen.

==Marburg speech==
In 1934, Jung wrote the Marburg speech that was delivered on 17 June by Papen at the University of Marburg. The speech articulated the conservative establishment&#x27;s criticism of the violence of Nazism. The text sought to reassert the Christian foundation of the state and the need to avoid agitation and propaganda: &quot;It is time&quot;, the speech declared, &quot;to join together in fraternal friendship and respect for all our fellow countrymen, to avoid disturbing the labours of serious men and to silence fanatics&quot;. The speech was banned by the NSDAP from being printed in the press.

==Death==
Hitler personally ordered the arrest of Jung. He was arrested in his Berlin apartment by the Gestapo; he had been packing bags in an attempt to flee to Switzerland. Jung was transferred to Gestapo headquarters at Prinz-Albrecht-Straße. He was murdered by the SS shortly thereafter, being shot in the cellar at Gestapo headquarters. His body was found dumped in a ditch near the town of Oranienburg near Berlin on 1 July.

==Works==
&quot;The Rule of the Inferiour: Its Disintegration and Removal Through a New Reich&quot; is his major political treatise which was originally published in 1930 as &quot;Die Herrschaft der Minderwertigen, ihr Zerfall und ihre Ablösung durch ein neues Reich&quot; (&quot;Inferiour&quot; is an obsolete spelling of &quot;Inferior&quot;). The translator, Alexander Jacob, produced the first and only English edition in 1995 with a large introduction and notes, sold in two volumes; the first volume being 428 pages and the second 396 pages.

Jung expressed his views in a condensed form in his book &quot;An der Schwelle einer neuen Zeit&quot; (&quot;On the Threshold of a New Era&quot;). In its 21 chapters, Jung covered various topics, including the family, the economy, and demographic policy. A translation of the book by Victor Van Brandt was published by the far-right publisher &quot;Imperium Press&quot; in 2023.

In &quot;Sinndeutung der deutschen Revolution&quot; (1933), written less than year before he was murdered, Jung declared that &quot;violence is an element of life&quot; and that &quot;a nation that has become incapable of employing violence must be suspected of biological decline&quot;. A translation, also by Alexander Jacob, was published by Arktos Media in 2022.

<text>Michael Fitzhardinge Berkeley, Baron Berkeley of Knighton, (born 29 May 1948) is an English composer, broadcaster on music and non-party political member of the House of Lords, speaking as an advocate for the arts, contemporary music and music education.

==Early life==
Berkeley is the eldest of the three sons of Elizabeth Freda (née Bernstein) (1923–2016) and the composer Sir Lennox Berkeley. He was educated at The Oratory School, in Woodcote, and Westminster Cathedral Choir School. He was a chorister at Westminster Cathedral, and he frequently sang in works composed or conducted by his godfather, Benjamin Britten. He studied composition, singing and piano at the Royal Academy of Music. He also played in a rock band, Seeds of Discord. In his twenties, when he went to study with Richard Rodney Bennett, he concentrated on composition.

==Works==
Berkeley&#x27;s compositions include &quot;Meditations for Strings&quot; (1975), String Trio (1976) and an oratorio &quot;Or Shall We Die?&quot; (libretto by Ian McEwan, 1982). His orchestral works include &quot;Flames&quot; (RLPO/Atherton 1981), &quot;Gregorian Variations&quot; (Philharmonia/Pittsburgh/Previn 1984), &quot;Secret Garden&quot; (LSO/Davis, Barbican 1997) and &quot;The Garden of Earthly Delights&quot; (NYO/Rostropovich, Proms 1998) plus concerti for clarinet, violin, oboe, &#x27;cello and organ.

He has written three operas. &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot; (libretto by David Malouf) is based on the childhood of Rudyard Kipling and was recorded by the Opera North Chorus and English Northern Philharmonia in 1993. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (2000, libretto also by David Malouf), premiered at the Cheltenham Music Festival by Music Theatre Wales and subsequently toured around the UK. The Australian premiere took place in Canberra and the American in St. Louis where it was directed by Colin Graham. The original drafts for &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, representing one year&#x27;s worth of work and the only copy of them, were stolen from outside his London home in May 1999. The chamber opera &quot;For You&quot;, with Ian McEwan the librettist, was premiered by Music Theatre Wales in the Linbury Theatre, Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. A proposed opera of McEwan&#x27;s novel &quot;Atonement&quot; with libretto by Craig Raine for Dortmund Opera was set for premiere in 2013, but was shelved.

Berkeley has written scores for films including &quot;Captive&quot; (with the Edge of U2, 1986), &quot;Goldeneye&quot; (1989) and &quot;Twenty-One&quot; (1991). He arranged the choral sequences for Hello Earth, a song written by Kate Bush which appeared on her studio album &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; in 1985.

Berkeley has written a considerable amount of chamber music for artists including Julian Bream (&quot;Guitar Sonata&quot;, Edinburgh Festival, 1980), the Takas Quartet (&quot;Torque and Velocity&quot;, 1997) and Nicholas Daniel with the Carducci Quartet (&quot;Into the Ravine&quot;). The harpsichordist Mahan Esfahani premiered Berkeley&#x27;s &quot;Haiku 2: Insects&quot;, composed for Esfahani, at the Snape Maltings Concert Hall in April 2023.

Berkeley has written much choral music, including the specially commissioned &quot;Listen, listen O my child&quot; for the enthronement of Justin Welby as Archbishop of Canterbury in 2013 and the &quot;Magna Carta Te Deum&quot;, for the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta in 2015 in Lincoln Cathedral. He wrote &quot;This Endernight&quot; for the 2016 King’s College Festival of nine Lessons and Carols and &quot;Super Flumina Babylonis&quot; for the St. Cecilia Day Service in Westminster Cathedral in 2017.

In June 2024 Orchid Classics released &quot;Collaborations&quot;, a CD of Berkeley&#x27;s music featuring artists he had worked closely with and written for. These included Mahan Esfahani, Clare Hammond, Madeleine Mitchell, Alice Coote, Julius Drake and the BBC Singers. The album includes a song for Ukraine, Zero Hour, with lyrics and vocals from Neil Tennant and guitar solos from David Gilmour.

==Broadcasting==
Berkeley is also known as a television and radio broadcaster on music. Between 1974 and 1979 he worked for BBC Radio 3 as a staff continuity announcer. Also on Radio he contributed to &quot;Record Review&quot; (1972–77) and was a regular presenter of &quot;Mainly for Pleasure&quot; (1980–92) and &quot;In Tune&quot; (1992–93).

Since 1995 Berkeley has presented BBC Radio 3&#x27;s &quot;Private Passions&quot;, in which celebrities are invited to choose and discuss several pieces of music. In December 1997, one of his guests was a 112-year-old Viennese percussionist called Manfred Sturmer, who told anecdotes about Brahms, Clara Schumann, Richard Strauss, Arnold Schoenberg and others so realistically that some listeners did not realise that the whole thing was a hoax perpetrated by Berkeley and John Sessions. On 30 December 2018, King Charles, when Prince of Wales, was the guest on &quot;Private Passions&quot;, in order to mark the passing of over one thousand editions of the programme, and to celebrate the prince&#x27;s 70th birthday.

==Prizes and posts==
In 1977 he was awarded the Guinness Prize for Composition. In 1979, the Scottish Chamber Orchestra appointed Berkeley its associate composer. Berkeley was composer-in-association with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales from 2000 until 2009. He also acted as visiting professor in Composition at the Royal Welsh College of Music &amp; Drama and was artistic director of the Cheltenham Music Festival from 1995 to 2004. In 2002 and 2003 he was international guest curator of chamber music programs at the Sydney Festival, Australia&#x27;s largest arts festival. He has served as a trustee of the Koestler Trust which puts music and the arts into prisons.

Berkeley was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to music. He was awarded an honorary doctor of music degree by Aberdeen University in 2022.

Berkeley is a Fellow of the Royal Northern College of Music and an honorary Doctor of Music from the University of East Anglia and a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Music. He is President of the Presteigne Festival of Music and is also a Vice-President of the Joyful Company of Singers.

==Membership of the House of Lords==
In February 2013, it was announced that he would be made a life peer and enter the House of Lords as a crossbencher and on 26 March 2013 he was created Baron Berkeley of Knighton, of Knighton in the County of Powys.

In 2018 Michael Berkeley successfully instigated and steered through the House of Lords an Amendment to the Children Act 1989. This corrected an oversight in the law that meant that, while the Family Court could issue a Care Order for a child at risk of forced marriage or from a habitually drunk and violent father, it could not issue an Order for a child at risk of Female Genital Mutilation. The bill received unanimous backing in the House of Lords but, on reaching the House of Commons, where it was sponsored by Zac Goldsmith, it was twice objected to by Christopher Chope. This led to national outrage, and several cabinet ministers condemned Chope&#x27;s actions. Subsequently, first the Home Secretary and then the Prime Minister told parliament that they would find Government time for the Bill, which finally received Royal Assent on 15 March 2019. Berkeley has consistently spoken in support of music and music education.

==Personal life==
Berkeley has been married twice. His first marriage was to the literary agent Deborah Rogers. The marriage lasted from 1979 until her death in April 2014. The couple adopted a daughter, Jessica. Berkeley composed his Violin Concerto (in memoriam D.R.), premiered in July 2016 at The Proms, in tribute to Rogers. In June 2016, Berkeley married Elizabeth West. Berkeley has a residence in London and a farm in Wales.

<text>Taillefer (, meaning &quot;hewer of iron&quot;) was the surname of a Norman &quot;jongleur&quot; (minstrel), whose exact name and place of birth are unknown (sometimes his first name is given as &quot;Ivo&quot;). He travelled to England during the Norman conquest of England of 1066, in the train of William the Conqueror. At the Battle of Hastings, Taillefer sang the &quot;Chanson de Roland&quot; at the English troops while juggling with his sword. An English soldier ran out to challenge him and was killed by Taillefer, who then charged the English lines alone while singing and was engulfed, killing at least four more English in the process. Taillefer is not depicted, by name at least, on the Bayeux Tapestry due to this some people do not believe in Taillerfer.

Wace mentions Taillefer in the &quot;Roman de Rou&quot; (c. 1170):

The story of Taillefer is told by Geoffrey Gaimar, Henry of Huntingdon, William of Malmesbury and in the &quot;Carmen de Hastingae Proelio&quot;. The accounts differ, some mentioning only the juggling, some only the song, but have elements in common. The story was the subject of an 1816 ballad by the German poet Ludwig Uhland, set to music for soprano, tenor, baritone, eight-part chorus and orchestra by Richard Strauss in 1903, Op. 52, named after the protagonist Taillefer. The work received a rare performance on 13 September 2014 at the Last Night of the Proms.

A version drawn from all of the sources can be found in Winston Churchill&#x27;s &quot;A History of the English-Speaking Peoples&quot;.

Near the end of the 3rd volume of his works, Robert Ripley mentions Taillefer under the heading &quot;General Eisenhower&quot;, pointing out the coincidences between the Allied general and the Norman knight. Taillefer embarked from the shore of Normandy where the Allies landed on D-Day in World War II. The Battle of Hastings was on 14 October 1066, and Taillefer died on that day; Eisenhower was born on 14 October 1890; and &quot;Eisenhower&quot; can be translated from German as &quot;hewer of iron&quot;.

It is weakly attested in Burke&#x27;s 1853 work &quot;Burke&#x27;s Landed Gentry for 1853, Vol. IV, p. 237ff&quot; that the descendants of Taillefer included a local Baron of Oapenge, Kent, named &quot;Hanger Taylifer&quot; born circa 1256. Further attestations eventually state his direct descendants include Rowland Taylor (1510 - 1555), Martyr.

<doc id="873080" wikidata="Q39040" url="?curid=873080" title="Battle of Yamazaki">
<text>The was fought in 1582 in Yamazaki, Japan, located in current-day Kyoto Prefecture. This battle is sometimes referred to as the Battle of Mt. Tennō (天王山の戦い &quot;Tennō-zan no tatakai&quot;).

In the Honnō-ji Incident, Akechi Mitsuhide, a retainer of Oda Nobunaga, attacked Nobunaga as he rested in Honnō-ji, and forced him to commit &quot;seppuku&quot;. Mitsuhide then took over Nobunaga&#x27;s power and authority around the Kyoto area. Thirteen days later, Oda&#x27;s forces under Toyotomi Hideyoshi met Mitsuhide at Yamazaki and defeated him, avenging his lord (Nobunaga) and taking Nobunaga&#x27;s authority and power for himself.

==Background==
===Honnō-ji Incident===
When Nobunaga died, Hideyoshi was busy fighting the Mōri clan in the Siege of Takamatsu. After betraying and defeating Nobunaga at Honnō-ji, Mitsuhide sent a letter to the Mōri. The letter contained a request for an alliance to crush Hideyoshi, but the letter&#x27;s messenger was intercepted by Hideyoshi&#x27;s forces and the plot was revealed.

===Great Chugoku retreat===
Upon hearing news that Nobunaga had been killed, and that Akechi Mitsuhide had not taken command of his possessions, Hashiba Hideyoshi immediately negotiated a peace treaty with the Mōri by demanding the seppuku of Shimizu Muneharu from Takamatsu, and remained careful to keep Nobunaga&#x27;s death a secret. Once the treaty was secured, on 25 June, Hideyoshi&#x27;s forces retreated from Chugoku region and he led his troops on a forced march towards Kyoto, covering up to 40 km a day, spending the night at his Himeji Castle, and reaching Amagasaki on 29 June. Niwa Nagahide and Oda Nobutaka joined him as he passed through Osaka.

==Prelude==
Akechi Mitsuhide controlled two castles (Shōryūji and Yodo) in the Yamazaki region. Learning of the size of Hideyoshi&#x27;s army and not wanting to be caught inside a castle with his force divided, Mitsuhide resolved to prepare for battle somewhere to the south. Due to its position between a river and a mountain, Yamazaki provided Mitsuhide with choke points that could ease the number of enemies his forces would have to face at any one time.

Meanwhile, Hideyoshi decided that a wooded area called Mount Tennōzan, just outside the town of Yamazaki, was key to strategic control of the road to Kyoto. He sent a detachment under Nakagawa Kiyohide to secure this area, while he led the majority of the army to Yamazaki himself. His forces took over the mountain and gained a significant advantage.

Mitsuhide arranged his army behind a small river (the Enmyōji-gawa), which provided an excellent defensive position. On the night of 1 July, Hideyoshi&#x27;s generals Nakamura Kazuuji and Horio Yoshiharu sent a number of &quot;ninja&quot; into the Mitsuhide camp, setting fire to buildings and generally causing fear and confusion, and therefore robbing the enemy of their sleep for most of the night.

==Battle==
On the following morning, 2 July, the main fighting began as Hideyoshi&#x27;s men began to form up along the opposite shore of the Enmyōji-gawa from the enemy, and a portion of Mitsuhide&#x27;s samurai, led by Matsuda Masachika and Nabika Kamon, crossed the river, seeking to make their way up the wooded Tennōzan hill. They were driven back by arquebus fire, and so Hideyoshi felt confident enough to launch the right wing of his forces, under the command of Kato Mitsuyasu and Ikeda Tsuneoki, across the river, and into Mitsuhide&#x27;s front lines. They made some progress, and were soon joined by the left wing, with support from atop Mount Tennōzan. The majority of Mitsuhide&#x27;s men fled, with the exception of the 200 men under Mimaki Kaneaki, who charged and were destroyed by Hideyoshi&#x27;s larger force.

Soon, panic set in among the Akechi army, and Hideyoshi&#x27;s army chased them back to Shōryūji, where the garrison collapsed. Mitsuhide himself fled much further, to the town of Ogurusu, where he was killed by a gang of bandits. Mitsuhide is thought to have been killed by a bandit known as Nakamura about two weeks after the battle.

==In popular culture==
The Battle of Yamazaki is the final stage of Akechi Mitsuhide in &quot;Samurai Warriors&quot; and the first stage of Toyotomi Hideyoshi in &quot;Samurai Warriors 2&quot;. It also features as a campaign map in &quot;The Conquerors&quot; expansion of the real-time strategy game &quot;Age of Empires II&quot;.

The battle is also the basis for the Sonny Chiba martial arts film &quot;Shogun&#x27;s Ninja&quot;.

<text>The history of rugby league as a separate form of rugby football goes back to 1895 in Huddersfield, West Riding of Yorkshire when the Northern Rugby Football Union broke away from England&#x27;s established Rugby Football Union to administer its own separate competition. Similar schisms occurred later in Australia and New Zealand in 1907. Gradually the rugby played in these breakaway competitions evolved into a distinctly separate sport that took its name from the professional leagues that administered it. Rugby league in England went on to set attendance and player payment records and rugby league in Australia became the most watched sport on television. The game also developed a significant place in the culture of France, New Zealand and several other Pacific Island nations, such as Papua New Guinea, where it has become the national sport.

==Rugby union before the schisms ==
Although many forms of football had been played across the world, it was only during the second half of the 19th century that these games began to be codified. In 1871, English clubs playing the version of football played at Rugby School, which involved much more handling of the ball than in association football, met to form the Rugby Football Union. Many new rugby clubs were formed, and it was in the Northern English counties of Lancashire and Yorkshire that the game really took hold. Here rugby was largely a working class game, whilst the south eastern clubs were largely middle class.

Rugby spread to Australasia, especially the cities of Sydney, Brisbane, Christchurch and Auckland. Here too there was a clear divide between the working and more affluent upper-class players.

The strength of support for rugby grew over the following years, and large paying crowds were attracted to major matches, in particular in Yorkshire, where matches in the Yorkshire Cup (&quot;T&#x27;owd Tin Pot&quot;) soon became major events. England teams of the era were dominated by Lancashire and Yorkshire players. However these players were forbidden to earn any of the spoils of this newly-rich game. Predominantly working class teams found it difficult to play to their full potential because in many cases their time to play and to train was limited by the need to earn a wage. A further limit on the playing ability of working class teams was that working class players had to be careful how hard they played. If injured, they had to pay their own medical bills and possibly take time off work, which for a man earning a weekly wage could easily lead to financial hardship.

==The schism and the birth of rugby league==

In 1892, charges of professionalism were laid against rugby football clubs in Bradford and Leeds, both in Yorkshire, after they compensated players for missing work. This was despite the fact that the English Rugby Football Union (RFU) was allowing other players to be paid, such as the 1888 British Isles team that toured Australia, or the account of Harry Hamill of his payments to represent New South Wales (NSW) against in 1904.

In 1893 Yorkshire clubs complained that southern clubs were over-represented on the RFU committee and that committee meetings were held in London at times that made it difficult for northern members to attend. By implication they were arguing that this affected the RFU&#x27;s decisions on the issue of &quot;broken time&quot; payments (as compensation for the loss of income) to the detriment of northern clubs, who made up the majority of English rugby clubs. Payment for broken time was a proposal put forward by Yorkshire clubs that would allow players to receive up to six shillings (equivalent to £ in present-day terms) when they missed work because of match commitments. The idea was voted down by the RFU.

In August 1893, Huddersfield signed star players George Boak and John &#x27;Jock&#x27; Forsyth from Carlisle-based club, Cummersdale Hornets. The transfer was sudden and both men were summoned to appear before Carlisle Magistrates&#x27; Court for leaving their jobs without giving proper notice. Huddersfield was also accused of offering cash inducements for the players to move clubs contrary to the strict rules of the RFU. After an investigation, Huddersfield eventually received a long suspension from playing matches.

The severity of the punishments for &quot;broken time&quot; payments and their widespread application to northern clubs and players contributed to a growing sense of frustration and absence of fair play. Meanwhile, there was an obvious comparison with the professional Football League which had been formed in 1888, comprising 12 association football clubs, six of whom were from Northern England. In this environment, the next logical step was for the northern rugby clubs to form their own professional league.

On 27 August 1895, as a result of an emergency meeting in Manchester, prominent Lancashire clubs Broughton Rangers, Leigh, Oldham, Rochdale Hornets, St. Helens, Tyldesley, Warrington, Widnes and Wigan declared that they would support their Yorkshire colleagues in their proposal to form a Northern Union.
 
Two days later, on 29 August 1895, representatives of twenty-two clubs met in the George Hotel, Huddersfield, to form the Northern Rugby Football Union, usually called the Northern Union (NU). This was effectively the birth of rugby league, the name adopted by the sport in 1922. Twenty clubs had agreed to resign from the Rugby Union, but Dewsbury felt unable to comply with the decision. The Cheshire club, Stockport, had telegraphed the meeting requesting admission to the new organisation and was duly accepted with a second Cheshire club, Runcorn, admitted at the next meeting.

The twenty-two clubs and their years of foundation were Batley 1880; Bradford 1863; Brighouse Rangers 1878; Broughton Rangers 1877; Halifax 1873; Huddersfield FC 1864; Hull F.C. 1865; Hunslet 1883; Leeds 1870; Leigh 1878; Liversedge 1877; Manningham 1876; Oldham 1876; Rochdale Hornets 1871; Runcorn 1895; Stockport 1895; St Helens 1873; Tyldesley 1879; Wakefield Trinity 1873; Warrington 1876; Widnes 1875; and Wigan 1872.

The rugby union authorities took drastic action, issuing sanctions against clubs, players and officials involved in the new organisation. This extended even to amateurs who played with or against Northern Union sides. Consequently, northern clubs that existed purely for social and recreational rugby began to affiliate to the Northern Union, whilst retaining amateur status. By 1904 the new body had more clubs affiliated to it than the RFU.

The separate Lancashire and Yorkshire competitions of the NRFU merged in 1901, forming the Northern Rugby Football League. Also in 1901, James Lomas became the first £100 transfer, from Bramley to Salford. The NRFU became the Northern Rugby Football League in the summer of 1922.

Similar schisms in football were threatened by the formations of the British Football Association in 1884 and the Amateur Football Association in 1907, but were averted.

The historic events that led to the 1895 rugby split were the subject of Mick Martin&#x27;s play &quot;Broken Time&quot;, the first dramatic treatment of rugby league.

==Development of rugby league in Great Britain==

The first international rugby league match took place in 1904 between England and an Other nationalities team, mostly made up of Welsh players.

Initially the Northern Union continued to play under existing RFU laws. The first minor change (awarding a penalty for a deliberate knock-on) was introduced during the first season of the game. Other new laws were gradually introduced until, by the arrival of the All Golds in 1907 the major differences between the games had been introduced. These major differences were:
* 13 players per team as opposed to 15 in union (the two &quot;missing&quot; are the flankers)
* The &quot;play the ball&quot; (heeling the ball back after a tackle) rather than a ruck
* The elimination of the line-out
* A slightly different scoring structure, with all goals only being worth 2 points

&quot;See:&quot; Rugby league gameplay for more on the current game.

During this period the Northern Union began to develop the British game&#x27;s major tournaments. The league championship, after initially being played as one competition, was split into two sections, the Lancashire and Yorkshire leagues, with only a limited number of inter-county games. This necessitated a play-off structure to determine the overall champions. A nationwide cup, the Challenge Cup was introduced, and soon became the biggest draw in the sport. Finally, in 1905, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Cups were introduced, thus completing a structure that was to last until the 1960s. There were therefore four trophies on offer to any one club, and the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; was to win &quot;All Four Cups&quot;.

As it became obvious that two codes of rugby were going to co-exist for the foreseeable future, those interested in the game needed to be able to distinguish between them. It became customary to describe those teams affiliated to the NU as &#x27;playing in the league&#x27; hence &quot;rugby league&quot; while those which remained affiliated to the RFU (who did not play in a league) as playing &quot;rugby union&quot;.

==Introduction to New Zealand==

In 1905, as New Zealand&#x27;s rugby union team, the All Blacks, toured Britain, they witnessed first-hand the growing popularity of the Northern Union games. In 1906, All Black George William Smith, while on his way home, met an Australian entrepreneur, J. J. Giltinan to discuss the potential of professional rugby in Australasia.
In the meantime, a less-well known New Zealand rugby union player, Albert Henry Baskerville (or Baskiville), was about to recruit a group of players for a professional tour of Great Britain. It is believed that Baskerville first became aware of the profits to be made from such a venture while he was working at the Wellington Post Office in 1906: a colleague had a coughing fit and dropped a British newspaper. Baskerville picked it up and noticed a report about a Northern Union match that over 40,000 people had attended. Baskerville wrote to the NRFU asking if they would host a New Zealand touring party. George Smith learned of Baskerville&#x27;s activities and they joined forces to recruit a team.

All Golds tour

When the All Golds stopped off in Australia, three games were played at the Sydney Showground, against a professional NSW rugby team. These games were played under rugby union laws, as no copies of the Northern Union laws were available. Baskerville was greatly impressed by Dally Messenger, and persuaded him to join the touring party. For this reason, the All Golds are sometimes known as Australasia, rather than New Zealand, although Messenger was the only Australian in the touring team.

The All Golds arrived in Britain late in 1907 having never even seen a match played under the new Northern Union laws. They undertook a week&#x27;s intensive coaching in Leeds to bring them up to speed, and after playing a number of touring matches the first true rugby league test was played, with the team going down 8–9 to Wales in Aberdare on 1 January 1908. The All Golds gained revenge however, defeating the full Great Britain side in two of the three Test matches, which were played at Leeds, Chelsea and Cheltenham; a surprising choice of venues given rugby league&#x27;s northern base. The tour was a great success, and gave a much needed boost to the game in Britain, which was struggling financially against the rise of association football.

Baskerville died from illness on the Australian leg of the tour, but the professional rugby movement lived on, pushing forward in New Zealand despite strong opposition from the rugby union establishment.

Early setbacks for the game in New Zealand

Apart from the blow presented by the sudden and premature death of Baskerville, other difficulties would soon trouble the game in New Zealand. In some ways, the All Golds were too successful for the good of New Zealand rugby league, as many team members soon accepted lucrative contracts with British clubs. Baskerville&#x27;s game would soon establish a strong following, especially in Auckland, but rugby union&#x27;s strong grassroots organisation and finances in New Zealand—its &quot;veiled professionalism&quot; in the eyes of many observers at the time—meant that rugby league was unable to become quite as dominant there as in some regions of Australia and England.

==Introduction to Australia==
=== New South Wales ===
In the Australian rugby stronghold of Sydney, issues of class and professionalism were beginning to cause friction. Rumours and claims of &quot;shamateurism&quot; (see Amateur sports) in the New South Wales Rugby Union were circulating. The growing tension was exacerbated by an incident in 1907, when a working class player, Alex Burdon, broke his arm while playing for the New South Wales team, and received no compensation for his time off work.

George Smith cabled a friend in Sydney to enquire whether there might be any support for a tour by his New Zealand professional team. Word reached Giltinan, who took great interest. Giltinan announced that he had invited Baskerville&#x27;s team to play three matches in Sydney. The Australian press responded by dubbing the travelling New Zealand team &quot;All Golds&quot;, a sardonic play on the nickname of the existing amateur New Zealand rugby team, the &quot;All Blacks&quot; and the supposed &quot;mercenary&quot; nature of the new code. The games were a great success; leaving the rugby rebels of Australia with much needed funds which soon proved to be vital for rugby league in Australia.

A meeting was held at Bateman&#x27;s Crystal Hotel in Sydney on 8 August 1907, to organise professional rugby in Australia. Giltinan, Burdon and the Test cricketer Victor Trumper were among those who attended. The meeting resolved that a &quot;New South Wales Rugby Football League&quot; (NSWRFL) should be formed, to play the Northern Union rules. This was the first time that the words &quot;rugby&quot; and &quot;league&quot; were used in the name of an Australian organising body. Players were soon recruited for the new game; despite the threat of immediate and lifetime expulsion from the New South Wales Rugby Union. The NSWRFL managed to recruit Herbert &quot;Dally&quot; Messenger, the most famous rugby player in Sydney at the time.

The first season of the NSWRFL competition was played in 1908, and has continued to be played every year since (despite changes in administration and name), eventually going national and becoming the world&#x27;s premier rugby football club competition.

In September 1909, when the new &quot;Northern Union&quot; code was still in its infancy in Australia, a match between the Kangaroos and the Wallabies was played before a crowd of around 20,000, with the Rugby League side winning 29–26. That year rugby union and rugby league had similar gate receipts. By 1910 league&#x27;s had doubled and by 1913 rugby union&#x27;s receipts were less than 10% of its competitors&#x27;. Union had to relinquish leases on major sporting grounds, with most being taken over by rugby league.

===Queensland===
The All Golds tour also served to kick start the game in the Australian state of Queensland, the great rival of NSW in rugby. On 16 May 1908, the returning New Zealanders played a hastily assembled Queensland team in Brisbane. Observers of the new game were shocked when Albert Baskerville fell ill in Brisbane and died of pneumonia. Test series between Great Britain and New Zealand are played for the Baskerville Shield, named in his memory.

A Queensland Rugby Football Association was founded, and in early July, informal club games were played in Brisbane. Later that month there were three representative games against NSW, and these acted as selection trials for a national team. The first game was also notable for a Queensland tackle which rendered one NSW player, Ed &quot;Son&quot; Fry, completely naked from the waist down—an event which did not stop him from scoring a try.

The Brisbane Rugby League premiership began in 1909. On 8 May the first match was played in Brisbane between Norths and Souths before a handful of spectators at the Gabba.

By the 1920s the Queensland Rugby League had established itself as a force to rival the NSWRL.

===Rugby league&#x27;s &quot;Ashes&quot;===

Also in 1908, the Australian rugby union team returned from a tour of the British Isles, for which the team had received three shillings a day, for out-of-pocket expenses. Thirteen of the players immediately joined rugby league teams. By the northern winter of 1908–09, an Australian touring party was heading for Great Britain, and the test series was dubbed &quot;The Ashes&quot; by the press, in imitation of The Ashes cricket matches, contested by Australia and England.

Later in 1909, when New Zealand toured Australia, the home team&#x27;s jersey featured a kangaroo for the first time, giving them the enduring nickname of &quot;The Kangaroos&quot;.

==Pre-war developments==
The early years of the 20th century also saw attempts to establish the game in Wales, with several teams being formed in the country. None of these ventures lasted long, however Wales remained a source of playing talent for rugby league. Over the years many hundreds of Welsh rugby union players &quot;moved north&quot; to the major English clubs, attracted by the opportunity to earn money playing rugby. (It was not until rugby union officially allowed professionalism, in the late 20th century that this supply of talent ceased.)

The 1910 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, the first ever, took place after the 1909–10 Northern Rugby Football Union season and featured a number of Welsh former rugby union internationals. Several Wallabies players changed codes to play against this touring team, which was anticipated to be one of the best sides ever to visit Australasia.

In Australasia, the game centred around local, regional or statewide leagues, and there were no national competitions in either country until late in the 20th century. In both Australia and New Zealand, club championships were based on one set of home and away matches leading to a play-off, rather than the multiplicity of trophies available to British clubs. Rugby league quickly took over from rugby union as the most popular form of football in New South Wales and Queensland. The rest of the country was already dominated by Australian rules football. The amateur code still held sway in New Zealand, although the emergence of rugby league meant that it was no longer unrivalled in popularity.

Sport in general suffered as a result of the First World War, and rugby league was no exception. In Britain, the government discouraged all professional sports, and the major competitions were abandoned. In Australia, the situation was slightly less serious, and rugby league continued. The rugby union authorities opted to suspend play throughout the war, and this decision is often cited as one of the prime reasons for the traditional dominance of rugby league over rugby union in Australia. 

Although the clubs continued to play, many of them were short of players due to the fighting. In 1917, Australia&#x27;s first rugby league club, the Glebe &quot;Dirty Reds&quot; (founded on 9 January 1908), unleashed controversy when it fielded a player named Dan &quot;Laddo&quot; Davies. Local rivals Annandale protested that Davies lived within their designated recruiting area. Glebe were deducted two competition points and Davies received a lifetime ban. Many Glebe players already believed the NSWRL was biased against them and they went on strike; the league responded by suspending the first grade team until the following April. Davies returned to his native Newcastle, where his previous club, Western Suburbs—not to be confused with the Sydney club of the same name—sought to use him in the local league. They tried repeatedly to have Davies&#x27; suspension lifted, but the NSWRL refused. When Western Suburbs fielded him in a match the NSWRL disqualified most of the local officials for a year. Disgruntled Novocastrians formed a breakaway competition, which lasted until 1919. The fortunes of Glebe, both on the field and financially, did not improve greatly after the Davies affair, and it was expelled from the main NSWRL competition in 1929.

In November 1921 in England, the first £1,000 transfer fee took winger Harold Buck from Hunslet to Leeds.

Internationally, the game had settled into a steady pattern of alternating tours, with either Australia or New Zealand visiting Britain once every two years, and Britain reciprocating in the southern hemisphere. The war had intervened, but the schedule was picked up again after hostilities ceased.

An increasing number of Australian and New Zealand players headed for the bigger pay packets on offer in England, many of them destined never to be seen again on the playing fields of their home countries.

In 1933 a proposed hybrid sport of rugby league and Australian rules football was trialled only once.

==Inter-war years==

For many years, the rugby union authorities had suspected that the French rugby union was abusing the idea of amateurism, and in the early 1930s the French Rugby Union was suspended from playing against the other nations.
In 1932 the first rugby league match under floodlights is played between Leeds and Wigan at White City in London.
Following development work by both Harry Sunderland (on behalf of the Australian Rugby League) and the Rugby Football League based in England, the Australian and Great British Test teams played an exhibition game at Stade Pershing in Paris in late December 1933.
The French Rugby League was formed on 6 April 1934.

Looking round for an alternative, many French players turned to rugby league, which soon became the dominant game in France, particularly in the south west of the country. The arrival of a French team on the international scene allowed more variety in the touring pattern, and also for the introduction of a European Championship.

During the Second World War, the British government took a more benign view of professional sports, viewing them as a vital aid to public morale. Although normal leagues were suspended, a War Emergency League was established, with clubs playing separate Yorkshire and Lancashire sections to reduce the need for travel. This period also saw a temporary relaxation of the regulations prohibiting rugby union players from contact with rugby league. In an extraordinary development a team representing rugby league met a rugby union equivalent in two matches, held to raise money for the Red Cross. Both games were held under rugby union rules; both were won by the rugby league side.

In Australia, the war years produced large crowds, and financially at least, the sport did not suffer the hardships endured during the First World War. Nonetheless, the loss of many young men in fighting undoubtedly weakened the talent pool available.

The defeat of France had serious implications for rugby league in France. The Vichy regime banned rugby league and forced players, clubs and officials to switch codes to union. Assets of the rugby league and its clubs were handed over to union.

The consequences of this action still reverberate; the assets were never returned, and although the ban on rugby league was lifted, it was prevented from calling itself rugby from 1949 to the mid-1980s, having to use the name Jeu à Treize (&quot;Game of Thirteen&quot;, in reference to the number of players in a rugby league side).

==Post-war developments==
The rules of the sport had continued to evolve, and until the 1940s there was no world governing body to oversee this and ensure consistency. Negotiations between the respective governing bodies were required to fix rules to be used for tours, though generally the other nations took their lead from the British authorities. For example, the field goal was banned by the New South Wales Rugby League in 1922, however this method of scoring was not officially recognised as being removed from the game until 1950, when the British authorities banned it.

This situation endured until 1948, when at the instigation of the French, the Rugby League International Federation (RLIF) was formed at a meeting on 25 January 1948 in Bordeaux. The 1947–48 Northern Rugby Football League season&#x27;s Challenge Cup Final was the first rugby league match to be televised. All spectator sports in the United Kingdom experienced a surge in interest in the years following the end of World War II and rugby league boomed. Large crowds came to be expected as the norm for a period of around 20 years. The total crowds for the British season hit a record in 1949–50, when over 69.8 million paying customers attended all matches. On Saturday 10 November 1951 the first televised international rugby league match was broadcast from Station Road, Swinton, where Great Britain met New Zealand in the second Test of that 1951 series.

The surge in public interest in the sport was further demonstrated by the 1954 Challenge Cup Final Replay between Halifax and Warrington, held at Odsal Stadium, Bradford on Wednesday, 5 May 1954. The officially recorded attendance was at 102,569 (a record for a single match of rugby league that stood until 107,999 watched Melbourne Storm defeat St George Illawarra Dragons at Stadium Australia in 1999). It is estimated that a further 20,000 spectators were present, as many got in free after a section of fencing collapsed. Warrington beat Halifax 8–4.

This period also saw growth in crowds in Australia, New Zealand and France. This was a golden age for the French, who led by the incomparable Puig Aubert, travelled to Australia and defeated their host in a three test series in 1951. On their return to France the victorious team were greeted by an estimated 100,000 fans in Marseille. They repeated the feat in France 1952–53 and again in Australia in 1955.

==Birth of the World Cup==
The French were the driving force behind the staging of the first Rugby League World Cup (also the first tournament to be officially known as the &quot;Rugby World Cup&quot;) in 1954. This competition has been held intermittently since then, in a variety of formats. Unlike many other sports the World Cup has never really been the pinnacle of the international game, that honour falling to international test series such as the Ashes.

In 1956, the state government of New South Wales legalised the playing of poker machines (&quot;pokies&quot;) in profit clubs, and this rapidly became the major source of income for NSW &quot;leagues clubs&quot;, some of which became palatial &quot;homes away from home&quot; for their supporters. The pokie windfall stemmed the steady trickle of Australian players to the better-financed clubs in England, and led to increased recruiting of rugby union and league players from Queensland and overseas by New South Welsh clubs. Within the space of several years, the Sydney-based league had come to dominate the code within Australia. The large profits accrued from gambling have always been controversial; many questioned the morality of such an income stream and felt that it would inevitably lead to financial turmoil and scandal.

1961 saw the first televised game of rugby league in Australia. In the UK live coverage of professional rugby league began in the early 1960s, exposing the game to a national audience. David Attenborough, then controller of BBC2, made the decision to screen rugby league games from a new competition specially designed for evening televising, the &quot;BBC2 Television Floodlit Trophy&quot;. Although it was widely seen as a gimmick, it proved a success, and rugby league has featured on television ever since, to the point where (like most sports) income from selling broadcasting rights is the single greatest source of revenue for the game. In Australia the 1967 NSWRFL season&#x27;s grand final became the first football grand final of any code to be televised live in Australia. The Nine Network had paid $5,000 for the broadcasting rights.

This period also saw further alterations to the rules of the sport. In 1964 substitutes were allowed for the first time, but only for players injured before half-time. In 1966 limited tackles were introduced. In 1967 professional matches were first allowed on Sundays. Also this year the number of times a team could retain possession after a play-the-ball was limited to four tackles. The concept of limited tackles had existed in American football since the 1880s, and it was hoped that this would encourage more attacking play, and prevent teams from simply playing to maintain possession of the ball at all costs. Although successful in this respect, it was felt that four tackles did not give sufficient time to develop an attack, with play often being characterised by pure panic. In 1971, the number of tackles allowed was increased to six, and has remained so ever since. That year the value of field goals was reduced as well, from 2 to 1.

In Britain&#x27;s 1971–72 season, sponsors first entered the game: brewers Joshua Tetley and cigarette brand John Player. In 1976 Sydney club Eastern Suburbs set a precedent with a major sponsor, City Ford appearing on their jersey.

In 1977 Australian forward Graham Olling made headlines when he became the first rugby league player to admit to taking anabolic steroids, which at the time were not illegal in the sport.

In 1980 the first State of Origin match was played in Australia. This pitted teams representative of Queensland and New South Wales against each other. Although matches between the two had taken place for many years, the &quot;origin&quot; concept (borrowed from Australian rules football) meant that for the first time players were selected based on where they first played the game, rather than where they were currently playing. This had an immediate effect, evening up the competition, which had come to be dominated by New South Wales because of the financial strength of the Sydney clubs, and rousing greater pride in spectators as their players were considered more truly representative of their respective states. State of Origin matches are now some of the biggest and most keenly fought contests in Australian sport.

The 1980s also saw attempts to improve rugby league&#x27;s popularity outside its traditional geographical boundaries. In Great Britain a new team from London (Fulham) was admitted to the professional ranks. In Australia, the first sides from outside the Sydney metropolitan area entered the top-flight competition in. In 1982 the Illawarra Steelers (based in Wollongong) and the Canberra Raiders (based in the national capital, Canberra) entered the competition. As a result of a lucrative illegal betting market having developed since the Second World War, FootyTAB was founded in 1983 to develop legal betting on rugby league, and was a resounding success.

In 1981 the &#x27;Sin Bin&#x27; rule was introduced in rugby league in Australia. Newtown hooker Barry Jensen became the first player sent there.
In 1983 the number of points awarded for scoring a try increased from three to four. Also in 1983, the Australian ABC-TV current affairs programme &quot;Four Corners&quot;, aired an episode entitled &quot;The Big League&quot;. The programme was to have repercussions throughout Australian sport, and in the wider community. Reporter Chris Masters (the brother of league identity Roy Masters) described allegations of corruption within the NSWRL, including suggestions that officials were siphoning funds from particular clubs and international matches while players and spectators endured sub-standard facilities. As a result of the programme, a Royal Commission (the &quot;Street Royal Commission&quot;) was called. It led to the New South Wales chief magistrate Murray Farquhar being jailed, the end of NSWRL president Kevin Humphreys&#x27; career and the ABC being sued for libel by NSW State Premier, Neville Wran (who eventually settled out of court). Masters, &quot;Four Corners&quot; and the commission are widely credited with widespread improvements in the administration of rugby league in Australia.

In the late 1980s, rugby league competitions were launched or continued to expand in Russia, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific islands.

A further expansion to the NSWRL in 1988 saw the first Queensland teams added to the league: Brisbane Broncos and Gold Coast Giants, as well as another team from outside Sydney, Newcastle Knights. Expansion occurred again in 1995, with the addition to the League of teams from Perth, Townsville and Auckland.

In 1995 Ian Roberts became the first high-profile Australian sports person and first rugby footballer in the world to come out to the public as gay.

The 1990s saw the importance of television income to the sport continue to rise, and a battle for control of television rights led to the infamous Super League war, which saw the game split between rival competitions. This event affected the sport across the world during the middle of decade, and the damage done is only now being undone.

==Switch to Summer Rugby and World Cup Expansion==

While the Super League war was being fought in Australia, Rupert Murdoch approached the English clubs with a view to forming a Super League, primarily as a way to gain the upper hand during his battle with Kerry Packer for broadcasting rights for the sport in Australia. A large sum of money from News Corporation&#x27;s UK subsidiary, BSkyB, helped fund the proposal. The new competition got under way in 1996. As part of the deal, rugby league switched from a winter to a summer season. The British, Australian and New Zealand seasons are now played concurrently from March to October, and major international tournaments are now largely played in November. The French, however, have continued to play a winter season.

After the 1997 season in Australia the Super League war came to an end, with News International and the Australian Rugby League agreeing to merge their competitions to create the National Rugby League, which commenced in 1998. The first ever team from Victoria, the Melbourne Storm entered the competition. Several clubs were either forced to merge (e.g. St. George Dragons and Illawarra Steelers became St George Illawarra Dragons), or folded. The omission of South Sydney Rabbitohs, one of the founding members of the original NSWRL, led to mass protests. Although Souths did not participate in the NRL during 2000 and 2001, a Federal Court decision in July 2001 paved the way for them to return to the league in 2002.

In 1995, rugby union went professional, and those who had long derided rugby league as merely a professional version of that game were soon predicting the demise of the sport. The Super League war, the financial problems of the 2000 Rugby League World Cup and the signing of several high-profile rugby league stars by the union game gave ammunition to this claim.

With the professionalism of rugby union, several high-profile league players changed codes, with varying degrees of success. Australian RU administrators appeared to be targeting league internationals when in 2001/02 Kangaroos Wendell Sailor, Mat Rogers and Lote Tuqiri all switched and soon represented the Wallabies. Other high-profile players, such as Jason Robinson, Iestyn Harris and Henry Paul followed. However press claims at the time that the &quot;flood-gates&quot; had opened proved to be more sensational than portentous. By the end of the decade, the flow of league players moving on big-money contracts to union seemed to have stabilised, and in fact in many cases this actually proved to be positive for rugby league, with the money gained from transfer fees being used to fund expansion and additional youth development in Britain and with many of the star crossover players returning to rugby league in Australia.

In Britain, the ending of discrimination against rugby league resulting from professionalism in rugby union led to an increase in numbers in the amateur game, with many rugby union amateurs keen to try out the other code. In 2004 the Rugby Football League was able to report a return to profitability, a reunified structure and a 94% increase in registered players in just two years. 

In 2008, rugby league held its first World Cup since the disastrous 2000 tournament. The 2008 competition was heralded as a great success, turning a significant profit, and was generally seen as a major step forwards in the development of the international game. In addition, the Rugby League European Federation was set up during the decade and as a result the game saw massive advances in both the quality and quantity of international competition. The game in France saw a renaissance, largely as a result of the Catalans Dragons entry into Super League, while large advances were made in other countries such as Wales and New Zealand, who finished the decade as world champions.

In Australia in 2009, rugby league&#x27;s popularity was confirmed as it had the highest official television ratings figures of any sporting event.

The 2013 Rugby League World Cup was held in Europe, with the final played at England&#x27;s Old Trafford in front of 74,468, the largest crowd to attend an international fixture.

The 2014 National Rugby League Grand Final was the highest rated television show for the year in Australia.

In 2015, the league went through a structure change with promotion and relegation reintroduced between Super League and the Championship. It also saw rugby league pull 4 of the top 5 highest rated television broadcasts in Australia.

In 2017 rugby league saw its first professional club outside of Europe or Australasia/Oceania when the Canadian side Toronto Wolfpack entered the British Rugby League system in the third division. Toronto won League One in their first season and won promotion to the Championship, the second tier of British Rugby League for 2018. As of October 2018, Toronto&#x27;s owner stated his intention of setting up a new franchise in Canada, whilst a New York City based team expressed their interest to join Toronto in the British rugby league system.

<text>Collingbourne Ducis is a village and civil parish on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire, England, about south of Marlborough. It is one of several villages on the River Bourne which is a seasonal river, usually dry in summer. The parish includes the hamlets of Cadley and Sunton.

==History==
From the Domesday Book we know Earl Harold held the manor, and in 1086 a large settlement of 87 households was recorded. In 1256 the village was named Collingbourne Earls after the Lord of the Manor, the Earl of Leicester, who also held neighbouring Everleigh. John of Gaunt inherited the manor, became the Duke of Lancaster, and the village was thus known as Collingbourne Ducis or Dukes.

Sunton House is a Grade II* listed seven-bay house from c. 1710.

The architect C.E. Ponting was born in Collingbourne Ducis in 1850. The restoration of St. Andrew&#x27;s parish church in 1856 by G.E. Street made a lasting impression on him.

The Bourne Iron Works in the village was established by James Rawlings in the 1860s and made agricultural implements until the outbreak of World War II.

The Swindon, Marlborough and Andover Railway was opened through the Bourne valley in 1882, becoming the Midland and South Western Junction Railway in 1884 and part of the Great Western Railway in 1923. The line passed close to the east of Collingbourne Ducis and Collingbourne station was close to the village centre, south of the Cadley road. The station closed when the line was closed to passengers in 1961, and subsequently the track was removed.

Sunton, and the northern part of Cadley, were transferred to the parish from Collingbourne Kingston in 1934.

In 1974 a Saxon cemetery of archaeological significance was discovered in Cadley, including one bed burial. In 1998 a Saxon settlement was found in Saunders Meadow during the construction of a housing estate.

The Post Office at Collingbourne Ducis was mentioned by Sir Anthony Hopkins&#x27; character, Mr. Stevens, in the 1993 film &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot;. The village has one of the few surviving original Victorian post boxes inset to a flint cobble wall at &quot;Sally Lunn&#x27;s&quot; Cottage.

== Religious sites ==
The Church of England parish church of St Andrew (St Mary&#x27;s until some time before 1786) is from the early 13th century. Alterations in the 14th century included the addition of the tower, which was rebuilt in the 15th. In 1856 the chancel was narrowed and a vestry added, to designs of G.E. Street; further restoration in 1877 was by Sir Arthur Blomfield. The church is a Grade II* listed building.

The parish was united with Everleigh in 1977 after the closure of St Peter&#x27;s, Everleigh. It forms part of the Savernake team ministry.

A Primitive Methodist chapel was built at Cadley in 1880. The building was sold for residential use in 1988.

==Local government==
Collingbourne Ducis is a civil parish with an elected parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions.

== Amenities ==
Collingbourne Church of England Primary School serves the parish and surrounding area, including Collingbourne Kingston. Its building opened in 2004 at a new site on the northwest outskirts of the village; until then it occupied a National School building dating from 1859, close to the church.

Near the school is a village hall with playing fields. The village has two pubs: The &quot;Tipple Inn&quot;, an 18th-century building (formerly the &quot;Railway Hotel&quot; and the &quot;Blue Lion&quot;) on the A4 road, and &quot;The Shears Inn&quot; at the far end of Cadley Road.

==Twinning Association==
 Collingbourne and District is twinned with Le Merlerault in Normandy, France. The twinning agreement was made in 1992.

<text>Ahnatal is a municipality in the district of Kassel, in Hesse, Germany. It is situated roughly 9 km northwest of Kassel, Germany.

== Division of the municipality ==
It consists of three constituent villages, Weimar, Heckershausen, and Kammerberg.

== Notable places ==
Although not famous for any particular sights, the &quot;Bühl&quot; in Weimar attracted geological interest at the beginning of the 20th century as it is one of the very few places where elementary iron (i.e. no iron compounds) can be found. The former mine is now a lake which is popular as a swimming pool.

== Politics ==
From 1945 till 2008, Ahnatal has always had a social-democratic government. However, in the most recent elections of a mayor, the Christian-democratic candidate Michael Aufenanger was elected.

<text>Bennett Coleman and Company Limited (BCCL), d/b/a the Times Group, is an Indian media conglomerate based in Mumbai. Notable media properties owned and operated by the group include India&#x27;s largest selling daily English-language newspaper &quot;The Times of India&quot;, television channels such as Times Now, the radio station network Radio Mirchi, and magazines &quot;Filmfare&quot; and &quot;Femina&quot;.

The Sahu Jain family owns a majority of the stake in the group. In May 2023, the Times Group was split into two separate business entities between brothers Vineet Jain and Samir Jain, such that its radio and broadcast properties would remain with Vineet Jain and its print properties would be under the ownership of Samir Jain.

== History ==
The &quot;Bombay Times and Journal of Commerce&quot; was first published on 3 November 1838 as a predecessor to what would become &quot;The Times of India&quot;. While starting as a biweekly paper, it was converted to a daily in 1850. In 1859 the paper was merged with two other papers into the &quot;Bombay Times and Standard&quot; under editor Robert Knight. Two years later, in 1861, the paper got a more national scope with the title &quot;The Times of India&quot;. Subsequently the paper saw its ownership change several times until 1892 when an English journalist named Thomas Jewell Bennett along with Frank Morris Coleman (who later drowned in the 1915 sinking of the SS &quot;Persia&quot;) acquired the newspaper through their new joint stock company, &quot;Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co. Ltd&quot;. (BCCL). At the time, some 800 people were employed by the paper.

The company, by that time consolidated in the Times of India Group, was taken over from its British owners in 1946 by industrialist Ramkrishna Dalmia.

Ramkrishna Dalmia (7 April 1893 – 26 September 1978) was a pioneer industrialist and founder of the Dalmia-Jain group or Dalmia Group and the Times Group. The name is variously written as Ram Krishan Dalmia and Ram Kishan Dalmia. In 1947, Dalmia engineered the acquisition of the media giant Bennett, Coleman by transferring monies from a bank and an insurance company of which he was the Chairman. In 1955, this came to the attention of the socialist parliamentarian Feroze Gandhi who was part of the ruling Congress party headed by his estranged father-in-law Jawaharlal Nehru. In December 1955, he raised the matter in the Parliament, documenting extensively the various fund transfers and intermediaries through which the acquisition had been financed. The case was investigated by the Vivian Bose Commission of Inquiry.

In the court case that followed, where he was represented by the leading British attorney Sir Dingle Mackintosh Foot, he was sentenced to two years in Tihar Jail. But for most of the jail term he managed to spend in hospital. During this period the company was run by his son-in-law Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain.

Upon his release his son-in-law Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain to whom he had entrusted running of Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co. Ltd. rebuffed his efforts to resume command of the company. Jain would buy the company a few years later and the company would be primarily run by his family in the years after. The company expanded its presence in the Indian media sphere by founding different papers and local editions of &quot;The Times of India&quot;.

==Decline and revival==

The Times of India press published a number of influential English (e.g. Illustrated Weekly of India 1880-1993) and Hindi magazines (e.g. Dharmyug 1949-1997, Sarika, Dinaman 1965-1990s, Parag 1958-1990s), edited by distinguished authors including Khushwant Singh, Dharmveer Bharti, Agyeya and Sarveshwar Dayal Saxena. However, the organisation faced financial difficulties, and most of them were closed down during the 1990s.

The sons of Sahu Ashok Jain, Sahu Samir Jain and Vineet Jain are credited with reviving the financial success of the group with newer and more profitable ventures.
